The nucleotide sequence of the two minor SV40 DNA restriction fragments Hind L and Hind M is here reported. For this purpose we used 5'-32p-labeled DNA fragments either partially digested with snake venom diesterase for analysis by the wandering spot method or partially degraded with the base specific reagents dimethylsulphate or hydrazine for direct sequence analysis on gel. In the former procedure the strands were separated before degradation, while in the latter the strands were separated after modification but before the degradation. Due to the presence of several termination codons, the region Hind L - Hind M cannot be translated in a polypeptide. Also, no initiation codons for protein synthesis are present in this region.
