The isolation of a cDNA clone containing the complete coding region for human purine nucleoside phosphorylase (PNP) has been described previously. In this report we present the nucleotide sequence of this cDNA clone and compare the derived amino acid sequence, encoding a protein of 32 kilodaltons, with the published amino acid composition. Using a fragment of the cDNA clone as a probe, human PNP genomic clones from a bacteriophage lambda library have been isolated and the structural organization of the wild type PNP gene determined.
