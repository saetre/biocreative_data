The nucleotide sequence of the dnaA gene and the first 10% of the dnaN gene was determined. From the nucleotide sequence the amino acid sequence of the dnaA gene product was derived. It is a basic protein of 467 amino acid residues with a molecular weight of 52.5 kD. The expression of the dnaA gene is in the counterclockwise direction like the one of the dnaN gene, for which potential startsites were found.
