We have cloned chromosomal DNA bordering an insert that inactivates mutM. Sequencing of this clone has revealed that the insertion element is located between the promoter and structural gene for formamidopyrimidine-DNA glycosylase (Fapy-DNA glycosylase). An overproducing clone of Fapy-DNA glycosylase complements the original mutM strain that had been isolated after EMS mutagenesis. Thus, we conclude that MutM is actually Fapy-DNA glycosylase. mutM has previously been characterized as a mutator strain that leads specifically to G.C----T.A transversions. This in vivo characterization correlates well with the mutagenic potential of one of the lesions Fapy-DNA glycosylase removes, 8-oxo-7,8-dihydro-2'-deoxyguanine (8-OxodG).
