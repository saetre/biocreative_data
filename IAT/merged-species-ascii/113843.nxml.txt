We analyzed the ability of various cell extracts to extend a radiolabeled primer past an N-2-acetylaminofluorene (AAF) adduct located on a primed single-stranded template. When the 3' end of the primer is located opposite the lesion, partially fractionated human primary fibroblast extracts efficiently catalyzed primer-terminus extension by adding a ladder of about 15 dGMPs, in an apparently non-templated reaction. This activity was not detected in SV40-transformed fibroblasts or in HeLa cell extracts unless purified human DNA polymerase mu (Pol micro) was added. In contrast, purified human Pol micro alone could only add three dGMPs as predicted from the sequence of the template. These results suggest that a cofactor(s) present in cellular extracts modifies Pol micro activity. The production of the dGMP ladder at the primer terminus located opposite the AAF adduct reveals an unusual ability of Pol micro (in conjunction with its cofactor) to perform DNA synthesis from a slipped intermediate containing several unpaired bases.

Recently, a systematic screening of human sequence databases allowed the identification of DNA polymerase mu (Pol micro) (1,2). This novel DNA polymerase belongs to the X-family, whose members are structurally related to Pol beta, a non-processive enzyme with no proofreading activity that is involved primarily in base excision repair. In vertebrates, the X-family includes also terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase (TdT), a DNA-independent DNA polymerase whose expression is restricted to primary lymphoid tissues, and the recently identified Pol lambda, predicted to be involved in DNA repair synthesis during meiotic recombination (3) and base excision repair (4). The N-terminal portion of Pol micro, Pol lambda and TdT contain a BRCT motif (identified initially at the C-terminal domain of BRCA1 protein) that have no counterpart in Pol beta (1-3). This BRCT motif is proposed to mediate protein-protein or DNA-protein interactions (5,6) and may specifically modulate the activity of these homologous DNA polymerases, thereby defining their biological function.

Preferential expression of Pol micro in secondary lymphoid organs led to the hypothesis of a specific involvement of this error-prone DNA polymerase in somatic hypermutation of the V regions of immunoglobulin genes (2,7). However, recent data indicate that a combination of several error-prone DNA polymerases might contribute to this process: Pol zeta (8), Pol eta and Pol kappa (9,10) as well as Pol iota (11) are potential candidates (for a review on new eucaryotic DNA polymerase, see ref. 12). Further investigations are required to determine whether Pol micro is also involved in this process.

Pol micro has also been proposed to be the DNA polymerase responsible for DNA synthesis during the repair of double-strand breaks by non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ) (7,13). NHEJ is the predominant form of repair of double-strand breaks occurring in vertebrate mitotic cells exposed to oxidation or ionizing radiation, particularly in the G1 phase (14,15). NHEJ is  also an essential mechanism that repairs DNA segments during V(D)J recombination of the immunoglobulin and T cell-receptor genes. During this process, TdT contributes to antigen-receptor diversity by adding nucleotides to DNA ends. The interaction of TdT with the Ku70/86 heterodimer that binds to DNA ends may target the enzyme to the recombination sites (16). In agreement with the structural similarity of Pol micro and TdT (41% overall amino acid identity), it has been speculated that Pol micro is also able to interact with the Ku subunits and play a general role in NHEJ (7). The potential role of the DNA polymerases that could be involved in this process in mammalian cells has been investigated recently (17). In yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the pol beta-related POL IV was found to be required for NHEJ (18).

Recent data show that human Pol micro is able to efficiently extend mismatched bases by annealing the primer end with a microhomology region in the template 3 or 4 nt downstream (13). In the work reported here, we present evidence that Pol micro in conjunction with additional factor(s) present in the cellular extract, and most likely recruited at an N-2-acetylaminofluorene (AAF)-adduct lesion, is able to perform DNA synthesis from a slipped intermediate containing several looped-out bases. This property of promoting DNA synthesis despite the presence of mismatched nucleotides near the primer terminus is also consistent with a role in processing DNA ends during NHEJ.

Construction of single-stranded plasmid with a unique AAF adduct, pUC3G1.ss, has been extensively described previously (22). The site-specific modified template was mixed with a 5'-32P-labeled primer (5'-AGTGCCAAGCTTAGTCGATGTCCC-3') whose 3' end is opposite to the lesion (see Fig. 1A). That primer is protected in 3' and 5' with phosphorothioate bonds to prevent nucleotidyl degradation by exonuclease activities in the cellular extracts. Annealing of the primer was achieved by heating the template/primer mixture (ratio 4/1) to 70degreesC and allowing it to cool to room temperature for several hours. The annealed template/primer (3 fmol) was incubated in the presence of 5 microg of cell extracts in a 2 microl reaction volume containing 50 mM HEPES, 7 mM MgCl2, 1 mM DTT and 1 mM dNTPs. When indicated, 1 ng of purified Pol micro supplemented with 5 microg of BSA was used instead of the cell extracts. After 30 min at 37degreesC the reaction was stopped by addition of 2 microl of stop mix (100% formamide, 10 mg/ml xylene blue, 10 mg/ml bromophenol blue). 32P-labeled products were analyzed by electrophoresis through 20% polyacrylamide/7 M urea gels. Radiolabeled incorporation was visualized by phosphorimaging (Molecular Dynamics). For data presentation, gels were edited with Adobe Photoshop 5.5. Human purified Pol micro was purified as described previously (2).

Escherichia coli cells expressing human Pol micro, obtained as described (2), were grounded with alumina for 20 min at 4degreesC, the resulting lysate was resuspended in buffer A (50 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 1 mM DTT, 1 mM EDTA, 4% glycerol, 0.1 mg/ml BSA) supplemented with 0.5 M NaCl (6 vol/g of cells), and centrifuged for 15 min at 15 000 g to separate alumina and insoluble proteins (debris) from the soluble extract. All the following purification steps were carried out at 4degreesC. The supernatant was diluted with buffer A + 0.5 M NaCl to reach 120 OD260 U/ml, and the DNA present in the soluble extract was removed by polyethyleneimine (PEI) precipitation. By adding 0.3% PEI (10% stock solution, in water, at pH 7.5) and stirring for 10 min, DNA forms a white precipitate that sediments by centrifugation at 15 000 g for 20 min. The resulting supernatant was treated with ammonium sulfate at 50% saturation to obtain a PEI-free precipitate containing most of the Pol micro. Afterwards, this precipitate was resuspended in buffer A + 50 mM NaCl and loaded in a phosphocellulose column equilibrated in the same buffer. Pol micro eluted at an ionic strength corresponding to 0.3-0.5 M NaCl. This Pol micro-enriched fraction was diluted in buffer A up to 0.3 M NaCl, loaded in a HiTrap heparin column (Pharmacia Biotech) and eluted at 0.4 M NaCl. The final fraction contained highly purified Pol micro (>95%) in soluble form. To assess that Pol micro is the only DNA polymerase present, the final heparin-Sepharose fraction was loaded onto a 5 ml glycerol gradient (15-30%) containing 20 mM Tris-HCl pH 8, 200 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA and 1 mM DTT, and centrifuged at 62 000 r.p.m. (Beckman SW.50 rotor) for 24 h at 4degreesC. After centrifugation, 20 fractions were collected from the bottom of the tube, examined in Coomassie Blue-stained gels and tested for DNA polymerase activity on activated DNA. A single peak of DNA polymerase activity perfectly co-sedimented with the Pol micro (approximately55 kDa) polypeptide.

Rabbit polyclonal antibodies specific for Pol micro were developed via innoculation of the complete human Pol micro enzyme overproduced in E.coli cells (300 microg). The IgG fraction was purified by chromatography on protein A-Sepharose (Bio-Rad), dialyzed for 2 h against 30 mM HEPES, 1 mM DTT, 100 mM glutamic acid and 10% glycerol, and stored at -70degreesC. The sensitivity of the rabbit antisera was tested by dot blotting, using different amounts of purified Pol micro as antigen. (The antibody, at a dilution of 1:10.000, was able to detect 50 pg of purified Pol micro using the ECL detection system.) The specificity of the Pol micro antibodies was confirmed by western blotting of different protein extracts, and also by dot blotting. Using this method, cross-reactivity with Pol lambda was estimated to be <1%.

Variable amounts of cDNA were amplified by PCR in a reaction mixture (20 microl) that contained 2.5 mM MgCl2, 0.25 microM of each primer and 2 microl of LC FastStart DNA Master Mix SYBR Green I (Roche Diagnostics). The primers (OligoExpress) used for the amplification were as follows: Pol micro forward, 5'-AGGCTGTCGTCCCAATGCTC-3' (located in exon 1); Pol micro reverse, 5'-CAGGCATAGGCAGGCATCCA-3' (located in exon 3); GAPDH forward, 5'-GTTCGACAGTCAGCCGCATC-3' (located in the 5' untranslated region); and GAPDH reverse, 5'-TTGAGGCTGTTGTCATACTTCTCAT-3' (located in exon 6). The following LightCycler run program was used: denaturation step (95degreesC for 10 min), amplification step 45 times (95degreesC for 15 s, 60degreesC for 10 s, 72degreesC for 20 s) with a single fluorescence measurement per cycle, melting step (95degreesC for 10 s, 72degreesC for 10 s, 98degreesC with a heating rate of 0.1degreesC per s) with a continuous fluorescence measurement. Melting curve analysis and electrophoresis on a 1.8% Metaphor agarose gel (FMC Bioproducts) were performed to check the Tm and the size of the PCR products.

For a mathematical analysis of the quantitative RT-PCR, we determined the crossing points (CP) by the second derivative maximum method in the LightCycler 3.5 software (23). The CP is the point where the fluorescence rises above the background signal, indicating the beginning of the exponential phase of the PCR. Log cDNA quantity was plotted against CP. The efficiency (E) of amplification for each cDNA was calculated according to the equation E = 10[-1/slope]. CP deviation (DeltaCP) of each strain (sample) versus 1BR cells (control) was determined. Relative expression (R) of Pol micro transcript was calculated by using the equation 1. GAPDH transcript was used as a reference. The results are expressed as a percentage of Pol micro mRNA content in 1BR cells.

In the course of experiments aimed at understanding the role of various proteins in the extension step of translesion synthesis, we developed a primer elongation assay using a specific template/primer containing a single AAF adduct. The modified G-AAF single-stranded template was annealed to a primer whose 3' end is located opposite the lesion (Fig. 1A) thus forming a replication intermediate referred to as the LT. Upon incubation of the template/primer with cellular extracts in the presence of dGTP only, incorporation of three dG residues was expected (at the most) given the template sequence context of three dC residues located 5' to the AAF adduct. Surprisingly, a specific fraction (fraction B, see Materials and Methods) from normal (1BR) or XP6DU primary fibroblasts extracts extended very efficiently the LT, by adding a ladder of about 15 dGMP residues (Fig. 1B). In contrast, incorporation of dGMP was reduced in equivalent extracts from MRC5, CTAg and HeLa cells (Fig. 1B).

Normal and XP6DU (deficient in Pol eta) (24,25) fibroblasts showed the same pattern of elongation, clearly indicating that the dG ladder-synthesizing activity is not mediated by DNA Pol eta but by another DNA polymerase that remained to be identified.

In order to characterize further the enzymatic properties of the fractionated 1BR extract, its ability to elongate an oligonucleotide in the absence of a template was investigated. As shown in Figure 2A, no elongation could be detected with any of the nucleotides tested. Conversely, in the presence of the corresponding non-modified template and dGTP, three guanine residues were incorporated, as predicted by the sequence context (Fig. 2B). Only a faint signal of incorporation was detected when the other three dNTPs were assayed individually. In these cases, the mobility of the extended products is identical to the one of the dG-extended products, suggesting that they correspond to accurate elongation mediated by low endogenous levels of dGTP present in the extract. As an exception, by adding dCTP, a 'true' dCMP-extended product is observed at the +1 position.

In the presence of the AAF-modified substrate, 1BR extract catalyzed the aberrant primer extension of the LT by using exclusively dGTP (Fig. 2C). The extension pattern obtained in the presence of all four dNTPs was identical, suggesting that, in this particular sequence context, dGTP is the only nucleotide selected even when a pool of the four dNTPs is provided (Fig. 2D).

Taken together, these results indicate that fraction B of human primary fibroblasts contains a DNA-dependent polymerase that displays a dG ladder-synthesizing activity, only in the presence of the AAF adduct. This aberrant reaction may be triggered by the strong distortion that a G-AAF adduct imposes upon the DNA template (26). The specificity and reiteration of the end-addition reaction being restricted to dGMP suggest that it is driven by the run of three Cs downstream to the AAF adduct on the template strand.

The observations mentioned above are consistent with the possibility that the LT extension observed when using extracts from fibroblasts is mediated by a DNA polymerase related to TdT. However, as TdT expression is restricted to primary lymphoid cells at a precise stage of their differentiation, it is unlikely that the observed LT extension in fibroblast extracts is due to TdT. We decided to test Pol micro, which shares a 41% amino acid identity with TdT. In vitro, the purified enzyme displays intrinsic terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase activity but, unlike TdT, the catalytic efficiency of polymerization carried out by Pol micro was strongly enhanced by the presence of a template strand (2). These biochemical properties of Pol micro were tested using the same template/primer structures as above. As shown in Figure 3A, 1 ng of purified Pol micro was able to catalyze the addition of one dTMP to a DNA primer in the absence of a template. This nucleotide preference has been described previously (2). In the presence of the non-modified primer/template substrate, template-directed insertion of three dGMPs occurred. The enzyme was also able to add dTMP and dCMP but less efficiently than dGMP (Fig. 3B). These observations are consistent with the biochemical properties of Pol micro, including an optimal activity in the presence of a template/primer and low fidelity (2). When the reaction was carried out using the AAF mono-modified template (Fig. 3C), Pol micro is able to catalyze template-directed addition of three dGMPs more efficiently than misincorporation of dTMP and dCMP. Besides, the primer appears to be more efficiently elongated (number of primers extended), but the proportion of primer molecules stalled at position +2 in the presence of dGTP is higher when using the AAF mono-modified template. The extension catalyzed by Pol micro stops after three dGMPs have been incorporated even though all the four dNTPs are included in the reaction, suggesting that the presence of the AAF adduct hinders further progression of the DNA polymerase (Fig. 3D). A similar inhibition of elongation can be observed when dTMP and dCMP are independently provided.

A dramatically different result was obtained when Pol micro activity was assayed in the presence of a cellular extract that was defective in the dG ladder-synthesizing activity, such as a HeLa total extract (Fig. 3E). In this case, the specificity of the nucleotide insertion was very strict, and no other dNTP but dGTP could be incorporated. Moreover, a run of about 15 dGMPs was incorporated instead of the three dGMP residues obtained when purified Pol micro was used alone. This extension pattern was identical to that observed by using primary fibroblast extracts.
###end p 35

The ability of Pol micro to complement a deficient extract suggests that a cofactor(s) present in the extract modulates the activity of the DNA polymerase, modifying its incorporation pattern. This cofactor(s) is specific for Pol micro, as purified Pol beta, although being as efficient as Pol micro for the extension of the LT by three dGMPs failed to restore the dG ladder-synthesizing activity in the deficient extract (data not shown). These results demonstrate that Pol micro and Pol beta are not interchangeable and that the dG ladder-synthesizing activity specifically results from an interaction between Pol micro and cofactor(s) present in the extracts.

To further confirm that the dG ladder-synthesizing activity can be attributed to Pol micro, LT extension was assayed in the presence of either native or heat-denatured antibodies raised against human Pol micro. Native antibodies inhibited the catalytic activity of purified Pol micro (Fig. 4A). The level of inhibition quantified by phosphorimagery varied from 14- to 5-fold depending to the concentration of IgG used. LT extension catalyzed by a primary fibroblast extract (1BR; Fig. 4C), as well as that of a reconstituted extract (MRC5 extract supplemented with Pol micro; Fig. 4B), were also inhibited by the antibody in a dose-dependent manner. Inhibition was not observed with an unrelated antibody (data not shown) or when using heat-inactivated anti-Pol micro antibodies (Fig. 4). The data provided evidence that Pol micro is indeed the DNA polymerase responsible for the observed dG-ladder formation. Furthermore, IgG anti-Pol micro failed to inhibit DNA polymerase activity of Pol beta (Fig. 4D) showing that the antibody specific for DNA polymerase micro has no effect on other polymerase.

The LT primer elongation assay used in this study allowed a clear distinction between primary cell extracts which displayed an efficient dG-ladder formation and transformed cell extracts which hardly incorporate >4 nt. In order to compare the expression of Pol micro in these different cell strains, real-time quantitative RT-PCR was performed using serially diluted cDNA. Amplification of the GAPDH gene was used to normalize the results. The specificity of the PCR products was documented by electrophoresis and Tm determination. Cycle number of CP versus cDNA input were plotted to calculate the slope (Fig. 5A-C). The average PCR efficiencies using the cDNA from the various cell lines were identical for GAPDH (1.87 +/- 0.06) and for Pol micro (1.87 +/- 0.15). By using the established mathematical model of Pfaffl (23), we determined that Pol micro expression in XP6DU cells was almost identical to that observed in 1BR cells (66.7%). In contrast, Pol micro expression was significantly down regulated in CTAg (13.7%), MRC5 (4%) and HeLa cells (2.6%). Thus, modulation of Pol micro mRNA expression correlates with the detection of LT elongation in cell extracts, which is consistent with the implication of Pol micro in this process.

We show that the Pol micro present in human primary fibroblast extracts is able to extend efficiently the LT formed by a primer whose 3' end anneals opposite an AAF adduct. The purified enzyme was unable per se to extend the primer by >3 nt. In marked contrast, in the presence of a cellular extract, Pol micro efficiently catalyzed LT extension by producing a ladder of about 15 dGMPs. It is unlikely that the TdT-like activity of DNA Pol micro could be involved in the production of the dG ladder. Indeed it has been shown that DNA Pol micro is able to catalyze polymerization of any of the four dNTPs to a single-stranded DNA primer in the absence of a template, dTTP and dCTP being inserted more efficiently. We prefer to propose the following model (Fig. 6): (i) Pol micro extends the primer with one, two or three dGMPs; (ii) incorporation of additional nucleotides appears to be impeded by the presence of the AAF adduct in the primer binding cleft of the DNA polymerase; (iii) asymmetric translocation of the primer strand (slippage) repositions its 3' end such that further extension by Pol micro occurs again opposite the dC repeat; (iv) several cycles of slippage/extension produce a loop of unpaired bases on the neosynthesized strand; (v) the process stops, probably when the bulge in the primer strand gets too big to support stably DNA polymerase binding.
###end p 42
###begin p 43
The entire process is strictly dependent upon the presence of a cellular extract that provides a cofactor(s) for dG-ladder formation. We propose that, by means of either a post-translational modification of Pol micro or a protein-protein interaction, the cofactor may allow the DNA polymerase to be more tightly associated with the DNA despite the presence of several unpaired bases. Alternatively, the slippage reaction may occur upon DNA polymerase dissociation from the template after pausing at the AAF site. In this case, the cofactor may facilitate the remodeling of the substrate and reloading of the polymerase to the distorted primer terminus.

The assay described here provides an unique opportunity to identify the cofactor(s) that is likely to have an important regulatory role of the biological function of Pol micro. DNA-PK modifies TdT activity in vitro by limiting both the length and composition of nucleotide addition (27). As TdT and Pol micro share a 41% overall amino acid identity in both their BRCT and Pol beta core domains, we tested the influence of DNA-PK on Pol micro activity. Until now, we failed to demonstrate any functional interactions between the purified proteins to produce the dG ladder.

Pol micro has the peculiar capacity of accepting distortions in both primer and template strands, being able to extend realigned mismatched primer terminus, and to produce misinsertions on the same basis (13). Such a feature, together with the biochemical properties reported in this paper, could be especially useful for the proposed function of Pol micro in NHEJ (7). This DNA polymerase could produce insertions or deletions resulting from template/primer misalignments due to replication blockage by either a secondary structure or a chemical lesion.
