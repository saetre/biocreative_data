During mammalian spermiogenesis, the post-meiotic stage of spermatogenesis, histones are replaced by protamines on the DNA. Despite this histone elimination, novel polyadenylated histone transcripts were detected in mouse round spermatids. Sequence analysis of a spermatid-specific H2a cDNA clone indicated that it was derived from a mRNA of a replication-dependent histone gene even though its transcript was not polyadenylated in somatic and earlier spermatogenic cells. In round spermatids, both the hairpin and purine-rich elements in the 3' untranslated region of the somatic pre-mRNA were retained in the mature poly(A)+ mRNA transcripts. Polyadenylation occurred downstream of the purine-rich element and was not preceded by the somatic AATAAA polyadenylation signal sequence. While polyadenylated histone transcripts from replication-dependent genes have been observed previously in somatic cells, characteristics of this type of 3'-end formation in mammalian round spermatids were unique. In particular, a specific replication-dependent H2a gene was transcribed either as a polyadenylated or non-polyadenylated transcript in these cells, suggesting that the type of transcript present was dependent on the RNA sequence. Finally, both poly(A)- and poly(A)+ mRNAs were found on polyribosomes from round spermatids, indicating that histones were being translated in these cells and that the polyadenylation status of these transcripts did not affect their translatability.
