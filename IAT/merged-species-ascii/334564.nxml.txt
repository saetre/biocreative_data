Nucleotide sequence comparison of the related 13513-bp plasmid pFV1 and the 11014-bp plasmid pFZ1 from the thermophilic archaeon Methanobacterium thermoformicicum THF and Z-245, respectively, revealed a homologous, approximately 8.2 kb backbone structure that is interrupted by plasmid-specific elements. Various highly conserved palindromic structures and an ORF that could code for a NTP-binding protein were identified within the backbone structure and may be involved in plasmid maintenance and replication. Each plasmid contains at comparable locations a module which specifies components of different restriction-modification (R/M) systems. The R/M module of pFV1 contained, in addition to the genes of the GGCC-recognizing R/M system MthTI, an ORF which may be involved in repair of G-T mismatches generated by deamination of m5C at high temperatures.
