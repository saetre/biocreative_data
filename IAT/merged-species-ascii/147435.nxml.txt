Direct amplification of length polymorphisms (DALP) uses an arbitrarily primed PCR (AP-PCR) to produce genomic fingerprints and to enable sequencing of DNA polymorphisms in virtually any species. Oligonucleotide pairs were designed to each produce a specific multi-banded pattern and all the fragments thus generated can be directly sequenced with the same two universal M13 sequencing primers. This strategy combines the advantages of a high resolution fingerprint technique and the possibility of characterizing the polymorphisms. The use of family members as templates in the multi-locus detection step allows a direct test of allele transmission, as well as early mapping of the markers or selection of loci associated with some traits or diseases. We used this method to detect micro-deletions/insertions and microsatellite DNA loci useful in population genetics studies, but it could be applied in many other fields of biology, such as genome mapping for definition of polymorphic sequence tagged sites, directly localized on a genetic map.
