c-Jun/AP-1 has been linked to invasive properties of aggressive breast cancer. Recently, it has been reported that overexpression of c-Jun in breast cancer cell line MCF-7 resulted in increased AP-1 activity, motility and invasiveness of the cells in vitro and tumor formation in nude mice. However, the role of c-Jun in metastasis of human breast cancer in vivo is currently unknown.

Ectopic overexpression of c-Jun promoted the growth of MCF-7 cells and resulted in a significant increase in the percentage of cells in S phase and increased motility and invasiveness. Introduction of c-Jun gene alone into weakly invasive MCF-7 cells resulted in the transfected cells capable of metastasizing to the nude mouse liver following tail vein injection.

The present study confirms that overexpression of c-Jun contributes to a more invasive phenotype in MCF-7 cells. It indicates an interesting relationship between c-Jun expression and increased property of adhesion, migration and in vivo liver metastasis of MCF-7/c-Jun cells. The results provide further evidence that c-Jun is involved in the metastasis of breast cancer. The finding also opens an opportunity for development of anti-c-Jun strategies in breast cancer therapy.

The composite transcription factor activating protein-1 (AP-1) is thought to participate in fundamental cellular processes and control cellular responses to stimuli that regulate proliferation, differentiation, oncogenic transformation and apoptosis [1-5]. AP-1 proteins are composed principally of homodimers of Jun family members (c-Jun, JunB, JunD) or heterodimers of the Jun family members with the Fos family members (c-Fos, FosB, Fra-1, and Fra-2) [6-9]. These homodimers or heterodimers bind to specific DNA sequences, known as 12-Otetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate response elements (TRE), in the promoter regions of target genes and activate transcription [10-13]. Among them, c-Jun is the major component of the AP-1 complex and c-Fos is its best-known partner. In vitro studies have demonstrated that Fos/Jun heterodimers are more stable and efficient in driving transcriptional activation than a Jun/Jun homodimer [14].

c-Jun is frequently overexpressed in human cancers. Increased c-Jun transcriptional activity and AP-1 mediated gene expression are correlated with ras-transformation [15-18]. Since tumor formation and TPA-induced invasion of malignant epidermal cell lines could be blocked in mice expressing a dominant negative transactivation mutant of c-Jun (TAM67), the role of c-Jun in carcinogenesis has been suggested [19,20]. In liver tumors, c-Jun antagonizes p53 by protecting tumor liver cells from apoptosis. It was further demonstrated that c-Jun deletion led to the accumulation of p53, the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21 and retinoblastoma (Rb), and apoptosis in experimentally induced c-Jun-/- liver tumors [21,22]. The role of c-Jun on angiogenesis in rodents was also described [23].

Recently, it was reported that overexpression of c-Jun in breast cancer cell line MCF-7 resulted in increased AP-1 activity, motility and invasiveness of the cells in vitro and tumor formation in nude mice [25]. The cells expressing dominant-negative c-Jun fail to invade in response to EGF [28]. However, the association of c-Jun overexpression with tumor metastasis in vivo has not been demonstrated.

The process of invasion and metastasis depends on the co-ordinate expression and function of a number of gene products conferring the ability of tumor cells to successfully complete a series of events that include breaking away from the primary tumor, invading through basement membrane barriers and the extracellular matrix (ECM) to colonize distant sites in the organism [29]. In the present study, involvement of c-Jun in invasiveness and metastasis both in vitro and in vivo was investigated by ectopic overexpression of c-Jun in breast cancer cell line MCF-7 and MCF-7/c-Jun xenograft model.

In order to investigate the effects of c-Jun on tumorigenesis and metastasis of breast cancer cells, pCDNA3.1/c-Jun was transfected into MCF-7 cells. The transfected MCF-7 cells were selected in levels of Geneticin (G418) up to 800 mug/ml for stable c-Jun expression. Individual neomycin-resistant colonies (MCF-7/c-Jun) from pCDNA3.1/c-Jun transfections were isolated, expanded and analyzed for c-Jun expression. Western blot analysis of expression of c-Jun protein in individual clones of stable transfectants is illustrated in Fig. 1. Compared to mock transfection, a considerable increase of c-Jun expression with an apparent molecular weight 39 kDa was observed in MCF-7/c-Jun cells. A significant difference in the increase of c-Jun protein expression was found in clones 1 and 4 of stable MCF-7/c-Jun transfectants. Clone 1 was then used in the following experiments.

The process of tumor cell invasion involved in tumor cell adhesion to the basement membrane, degradation/proteolysis of the basement membrane and tumor cell migration into secondary sites. Cell movement is generally a continuous and dynamic interplay of adhesions at the leading edge and deadhesions at the rear portion of the cells. A certain degree of cell attachment to ECM substrates is necessary for cell motility. Tumor cell lines that are highly invasive and metastatic exhibit a higher degree of adhesion and motility than their lower metastatic counterparts. To investigate the effect of c-Jun expression on the adhesion and motility of MCF-7 cells, the adhesive ability of MCF-7/c-Jun cells was compared with MCF-7/pCDNA3.1 cells. As shown in Fig. 3A, expression of c-Jun effectively increased adhesion of transfected MCF-7 cells to dishes coated with the Matrigel (P < 0.05).

Next the cell motility and the invasive capacity of MCF-7/c-Jun cells were analyzed in a classical wound migration assay. Cell motility into the Matrigel-coated area was determined from micrographs taken at various time points. Compared with the control cells, the motility MCF-7/c-Jun cells was significantly increased (Fig. 3B and 3C), indicating that ectopic expression of c-Jun promoted cell movement (p < 0.01).

The effect of c-Jun overexpression on tumor formation in nude mice was investigated by injecting 2 x 107 cells subcutaneously into mice. The tumor growth was observed in 4/6 mice injected with MCF-7/c-Jun cells, but parental MCF-7 cells did not produce tumors. Histologically, the tumors were composed of relatively large cells that differ in size and displayed areas with glandula-like arrangement of tumor cells (Fig. 4A). The overall tumor morphology was essentially similar to that observed in poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma. The tumor cells were separated by bundles of extracellular matrix and blood vessels visualized. The tumors were highly invasive in the surrounding muscle tissue (Fig. 4B and 4C). Mitosis could be found.

Then the effect of c-Jun overexpression on the metastatic potential was investigated by injecting MCF-7/c-Jun cells intravenously into nude mice. Six mice were monitored for lung and liver metastases. Metastatic colonization was evaluated by gross examination and microscopic inspection of tissue sections. Three of six mice developed visible liver metastases within 30 days. Livers with MCF-7/c-Jun cell derived metastases were enlarged. A clear external image of multiple metastatic lesions of livers was observed in the mice injected with MCF-7/c-Jun cells by gross examination, but no visible metastatic nodules in the livers of mice injected with MCF-7 cells (Fig. 5A). The livers from each group were removed and processed for histological examination. Microscopic examination of liver tissue sections revealed a massive infiltration of the liver by MCF-7/c-Jun derived tumor cells (Fig. 5B), but no liver infiltration by parental cells was observed (Fig. 5C). The tumor morphology was comparable to that observed in sections from subcutaneous tumors. Tumor cells in metastatic foci included a heterogeneous population of cells consisting of tumor epithelial cells, as well as associated endothelial cells and stroma cells. Large metastases showed central necrosis. Lung metastasis was not observed either by gross or by microscopic examination.

c-Jun has been demonstrated to transduce a mitogenic response and to involve in promoting cell growth as a single gene or in cooperation with an activated ras gene [15,16]. A critical role for c-Jun in the migration and invasion characteristics of human breast cancer cell line in in vitro experiment has been demonstrated [25]. The contribution of c-Jun to metastatic phenotype in breast cancer cells has also been studied in in vitro studies [25]. However, the role of c-Jun in metastasis of human breast cancer in vivo is currently unknown. In the present study, by utilizing MCF-7 cell line as a cell model the effects of c-Jun overexpression were studied in both in vitro and in vivo experiments to further investigate the direct involvement of c-Jun in tumorigenesis and metastasis.

c-Jun acts as a positive regulator of the cell cycle [30,31]. Our data indicated that ectopic overexpression of c-Jun promoted the growth of MCF-7 cells and led to a significant increase in the percentage of cells in S phase. It is possible that uncontrolled cell proliferation is an important first step in tumorigenesis. Overexpression of c-Jun in transfected MCF-7 cells results in increased motility and invasiveness. Interestingly, introduction of c-Jun gene alone into weakly invasive MCF-7 cells led to the transfected cells capable of metastasizing to the nude mouse liver following tail vein injection. For many years it had been reported that many malignant human tumors did not metastasize in the nude mouse. The production of metastasis mostly depends on the intrinsic tumor cell properties. Our data confirms that overexpression of c-Jun contributes to a more invasive phenotype in MCF-7 cells. This study is the first reported example of c-Jun overexpression inducing liver metastasis of MCF-7 cells in nude mice.

Progression of breast cancer is often accompanied by changes of gene expression pattern and requires an accumulation of metastasis supporting genetic modifications. AP-1 is thought to play a central role in reprogramming of the gene expression pattern and regulating the expression of genes directly necessary for cell invasion [27,32]. Several AP-1-responsive genes with roles in facilitating the invasion of malignant cells have been described [33-35]. The critical target genes activated by c-Jun/AP-1 in metastasis of MCF-7/c-Jun cells remain to be defined.

Conclusion
###end title 54
###begin p 55
In summary, the present study demonstrates an interesting relationship between c-Jun expression and increased property of adhesion, migration and liver metastasis of MCF-7 breast cancer cells. The results provide further evidence that c-Jun alone affects many aspects of the breast cancer phenotype and is involved in the metastasis of breast cancer. This finding also opens an opportunity for development of anti-c-Jun strategies in breast-cancer therapy.
