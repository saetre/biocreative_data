A cloned gliadin gene was isolated from a wheat genomic library, and 2.4 kb of its primary sequence determined. The gene, alpha-1Y, was found by Southern analysis to be located on chromosome 6A, and its derived amino acid sequence identifies it as a member of the A-gliadin subgroup of alpha-gliadins located on the short arm of that chromosome. alpha-1Y is apparently functional, and contains consensus TATA and CAAT boxes, and polyadenylation signals. This gliadin gene has no introns, and its noncoding flanking regions contain several short repeats and inverted sequences. The gene is contained in a 6.2 kb EcoRI genomic fragment whose apparent copy number varies in different wheat cultivars.
