Replication Factor C (RFC) is a five-subunit protein complex required for eukaryotic DNA replication and repair. The large subunit within this complex contains a C-terminal DNA binding domain which provides specificity for PCNA loading at a primer-template and a second, N-terminal DNA binding domain of unknown function. We isolated the N-terminal DNA binding domain from Drosophila melanogaster and defined the region within this polypeptide required for DNA binding. The DNA determinants most efficiently recognized by both the Drosophila minimal DNA binding domain and the N-terminal half of the human large subunit consist of a double-stranded DNA containing a recessed 5' phosphate. DNA containing a recessed 5' phosphate was preferred 5-fold over hairpined DNA containing a recessed 3' hydroxyl. Combined with existing data, these DNA binding properties suggest a role for the N-terminal DNA binding domain in the recognition of phosphorylated DNA ends.
