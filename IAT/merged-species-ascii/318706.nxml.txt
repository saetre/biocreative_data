The gamma-subunit of mouse 7S nerve growth factor (gamma-NGF) is a member of a family of closely related serine proteases that includes kallikreins and tamases. We have isolated from a DBA/2J male submaxillary gland cDNA library a clone, pSM676, which codes for gamma-NGF. Sequence analysis of the clone shows that it codes for the C-terminal 138 amino acids of the protein plus 23 bases of the 3'-nontranslated portion of the message. The predicted amino acid sequence agrees with that determined by Thomas et al. (1) for the gamma-subunit of nerve growth factor from Swiss Webster mice except for the single, conservative substitution of glutamate for aspartate at amino acid 175. When used as a probe for Southern blot analysis, pSM676 hybridizes to at least twelve fragments of restricted mouse genomic DNA which correspond to several different serine protease genes. Using mouse-hamster hybrid cell lines and recombinant inbred strains of mice, we have demonstrated that all of the genes which show homology to pSM676 are located on mouse chromosome 7, clustered at or near the Tam-1 locus.
