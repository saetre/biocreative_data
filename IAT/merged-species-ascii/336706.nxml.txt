By using the cDNA clone containing the sequence for the L1 ribosomal protein gene of Xenopus laevis as probe (1), we have isolated positive phages from a Drosophila melanogaster genomic library. The Drosophila genomic fragment, which gives the hybridization signal with the Xenopus cDNA, was sequenced: a region of 369 bp is 70% homologous to the sequence of X. laevis L1 cDNA. The gene was localized in situ at position 98AB of the right arm of the third polytene chromosome. By S1 mapping and heteroduplex analysis we have found that the gene is interrupted by three introns. A Drosophila cDNA embryonic library was screened and three cDNA clones were isolated (900, 1400 and 1500 nt long). By Northern analysis the cDNAs identify a 1400nt transcript present at every stage of development. By the features described, the clones we have isolated identify the Drosophila rp gene homologous to the L1 rp gene of Xenopus and could code for the L1 ribosomal protein described in D. melanogaster.
