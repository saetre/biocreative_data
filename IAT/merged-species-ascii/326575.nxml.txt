A genomic clone that contains the human gastrin gene was isolated from a human gene library. Restriction endonuclease mapping and DNA sequencing analysis revealed that this gene is about 0.7 kb long, and has an intron. The intron is located at a position that separates the coding region into the peptide region essential for biological activities of gastrin and the non-essential, N-terminal peptide region.
