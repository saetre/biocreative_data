The DNA sequence of the phage lambda genome between PL and the gene bet.

###begin p 1
We have determined 3,400 base pairs of DNA sequence from the phage gamma genome which starts to the right of PL and runs to the left into the gene bet. The sequence thus includes the genes, N, ral, Ea10, cIII, kil and gam, as well as the transcription terminators TL1 and TL2. One surprising feature of the sequence is the presence in the region expected to be occupied by ral of a long open reading frame that, if it is expressed, would have to be transcribed from left to right, or counter to transcription from PL.
