Here, we found that Aurora-A overexpression was closely correlated with clinic stage and lymph node metastasis in tongue carcinoma. Aurora-A inhibitory VX-680 suppressed proliferation, induced apoptosis and markedly reduced migration in cancer cells. We further showed that insulin-like growth factor-1, a PI3K physiological activator, reversed VX-680-decreased cell survival and motility. Conversely, wortmannin, a PI3K inhibitor, combined with VX-680 showed a synergistic effect on inducing apoptosis and suppressing migration. In addition, Aurora-A inhibition suppressed Akt activation, and VX-680-induced apoptosis was attenuated by Myr-Akt overexpression, revealing a cross-talk between Aurora-A and PI3K pathway interacting at Akt activation. Significantly, we showed that suppression of Aurora-A decreased phosphorylated Akt and was associated with increased IkappaBalpha expression. By contrast, Aurora-A overexpression upregulated Akt activity and downregulated IkappaBalpha, these changes were accompanied by nuclear translocation of nuclear factor-kappaB and increased expression of its target gene Bcl-xL. Lastly, Aurora-A overexpression induced IkappaBalpha reduction was abrogated by suppression of Akt either chemically or genetically.

Mammalian Aurora kinases, including Aurora A, B, and C, represent a new family of serine/threonine kinases crucial for several physiological processes including cytokinesis and chromosome segregation [1-3]. Aberrant expression and activity of Aurora kinase lead to formation of abnormal spindle in mitosis and aneuploidy which are closely associated with genomic instability [1,4]. Indeed, Aurora-A (Aur-A) is frequently overexpressed in various cancer types, such as ovarian, breast, colorectal, pancreatic, bladder and gastric cancer [5-7]. Overexpression of Aur-A induces tumorigenesis, metastasis and chemoresistance, correlating with its pro-survival function in cancer cells. Thus, Aurora kinase has been considered to be an oncoprotein and a promising molecular target for cancer therapy.

We and others previously reported that Aur-A-induced cell survival and migration were correlated with Akt activation [8,9]. Phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt signaling pathway is involved in survival and invasion in human cancers [10-12]. Akt, which consists of a family of highly conserved serine/threonine kinases, plays a key role in mediating insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1)-stimulated cell survival response. Many pro-apoptotic proteins have been identified as direct or indirect Akt substrates, including glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK-3), Bad and forkhead transcription factors [13]. In addition, Aur-A was reported to up-regulate NF-kappaB signaling by phosphorylation of IkappaBalpha(IkappaBalpha) [14]. NF-kappaB stimulates proliferation and blocks apoptosis via modulating transcription of pro-survival genes such as Bcl-xL and Bcl-2 in a number of cancer cell types [15]. Intra-cellular negative regulation of NF-kappaB is controlled primarily through interactions with IkappaB family, which prevent nuclear translocation and DNA binding of NF-kappaB. The exact mechanism and pathway by which Aur-A promotes cancer cell survival and anti-apoptosis however remain unclear.

Tongue squamous cell carcinoma (TSCC), the common type of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, is associated with a high mortality rate. The poor survival of tongue cancer is mainly due to tumor recurrence and regional lymph node metastasis, the most reliable prognostic indicators for patients [16]. Enhanced cytotoxicity has been observed when anti-EGFR monoclonal antibody cetuximab (Erbitux, C225) is used in combination with a number of conventional cytotoxic therapies, including cisplatin and paclitaxel to avoid the severe side-effect. Thus designing new drugs or combined chemotherapy aiming to enhance cytotoxicity and attenuate side-effect becomes urgent and challenging tasks.

In this study, we first showed that Aur-A was overexpressed in TSCC tissues and closely correlated with lymph node metastasis in patients. Aur-A inhibitory VX-680 [17,18] demonstrated a potent anti-tumor activity against various aspects of TSCC tumor progression, offering an opportunity for target therapy. More interestingly, we showed that activation of PI3K signaling by IGF-1 abrogated Aur-A inhibitory VX-680 induced apoptosis, whereas combination of VX-680 and PI3K inhibitor induced synergistic effects on inducing apoptosis and reducing migration in cancer cells. These data suggested a cross-talk between Aur-A and PI3K signaling pathway in regulating cell survival and migration. More importantly, we found that Aur-A downregulated IkappaBalpha via Akt activation, and subsequently induced NF-kappaB p65 translocated to nuclei where expression of its target gene Bcl-xL was increased, pointing that Aur-A promoted cell survival via Akt-mediated IkappaB kinase (IKK)/NF-kappaB signaling pathway. Taken together, understanding the mechanism underlying the pro-survival activity of Aur-A and the link between Aur-A and PI3K pathway provide a new insight and rationale for future combined molecular targeting therapeutics.

We used the immunohistochemical analysis to investigate Aur-A expression in primary tumor tissues. Results showed that only a few (7/30, 23.3%) matched adjacent normal tissues displayed Aur-A positive staining (Fig. 1a). However, Aur-A was significantly elevated in majority (36/55, 65.5%) of pathologically confirmed tumor specimens (Fig. 1b). Aur-A was uniformly cytoplasmic positive staining, uncoupled with its normal mitosis-related expression pattern.

We further analyzed the relationship between Aur-A expression and clinical characteristics (Table 1). Aur-A was more frequently expressed in high-grade tumors (stage III and IV, 77.8%) compared with low-grade (stage I and II, 42.1%) tumors (p = 0.008). Moreover, we observed preferential expression of Aur-A in tumor with positively (87.5%) versus negatively (56.4%) lymph node metastasized samples (p = 0.028). No significant correlation was found between Aur-A expression and other clinical characteristics including age, gender and differentiation status. Thus, the potential association between tumor overexpression of Aur-A and clinic stage or lymph node metastasis raises the possibility of specific inhibition of Aurora kinase in treatment of tongue cancer cells.

To evaluate the inhibition of Aurora kinase in TSCC cells, we used a small molecule inhibitor VX-680. Figure 2a showed that the percentage of abnormal spindle as was markedly increased in VX-680 treated mitotic cells (22.39 +/- 0.98%) compared to the control mitotic cells (4.21 +/- 0.91%). The abnormal spindle characterized as mono-polarity consistent with a known Aur-A inhibition phenotype [19]. Phosphorylation inhibition of histone H3 at Ser10, an in vivo substrate of Aur-B was significantly reduced in Tca8113 cells treated with VX-680 at 1 nM (12.00 +/- 3.06) or 5 nM (5.80 +/- 0.08), compared to the control cells (30.20 +/- 8.62, Fig. 2b).

Using a serum-free system, we examined cell apoptosis by Western blot and flow cytometry assay. IGF-1 increased the phosphorylation of Akt at Ser473 and its downstream target GSK3 at Ser 21/9. Expression of IkappaBalpha was however decreased by IGF-1 treatment (Fig. 3a), which also prevented VX-680 (5 nM)-induced apoptosis (Fig. 3b). Interestingly, VX-680 and an irreversible PI3K inhibitor wortmannin in combination displayed a dramatic effect in inhibiting Akt and GSK3 activity, elevating IkappaBalpha expression (Fig. 3a), and increasing cell apoptosis, compared with either VX-680 (about 7.90 +/- 2.54-fold) or wortmannin (about 18.49 +/- 2.88-fold) alone (Fig. 3b). We calculated the cooperative coefficient of VX-680 and wortmannin was 6.09 +/- 0.35, suggesting wortmannin synergized VX-680 mediated apoptosis by inhibiting PI3K. Meanwhile, elevated levels of cleaved PARP and cleaved caspase-3 and reduction of Bcl-2 expression were observed in cells treated with VX-680 and/or wortmannin (Fig. 3a). These data together indicated that there was an intracellular cross-talk between Aurora kinases and PI3K pathway in regulating cancer cell survival. We conducted Western blot with another squamous carcinoma KB cells and observed similar results (Additional file 1).

We have showed that overexpression of Aur-A was positively correlated with lymph node metastasis (Table 1), and cell migration was closely associated with potential of tumor invasiveness and metastasis. We showed that VX-680 potently induced a dose-dependent inhibition in the migration of Tca8113 cells (Additional file 2). Similar inhibition of cell motility was also induced by Akt/protein kinase B signaling inhibitor-2 (API-2) at dose of 1 muM.

We then conducted the transwell migration assay in serum-free condition. Compared with the control cells, IGF-1 significantly enhanced migration of Tca8113 cells (about 3.5-fold), while either VX-680 or wortmannin alone at low dose could partially reduce the cell mobility induced by IGF-1 (Fig. 4). Moreover, the combination of VX-680 and wortmannin efficiently abrogated IGF-1 induced cell migration in a synergic manner. Meanwhile we performed MTT assay to detect the cell viability in the same system. These results showed that the suppression of migration by VX-680 and/or wortmannin were not due to inducing apoptosis in Tca8113 cells (data not shown). Thus, these data indicated the interaction between Aurora kinases and PI3K pathway also played a key role in cancer cell migration.

Based on above findings, we hypothesized that Aur-A and PI3K pathway might interact at Akt. The level of pAkt was decreased in cells treated with increasing concentration of VX-680 (Fig. 5a). We further overexpressed a constitutively active form of Akt (Myr-Akt1) in Tca8113 cells (Fig. 5b). MTT assay showed that the survival rate of Myr-Akt1 transfected cells was (46.43 +/- 7.95% and 38.11 +/- 6.16%), obviously higher than that of empty vector pUSE transfected cells (31.5 +/- 1.67% and 18.93 +/- 2.90%) when treated with VX-680 at 5 nM and 10 nM respectively (Fig. 5c). We performed Aur-A RNAi in vector or Myr-Akt1 transfected cells and observed similar results (Additional file 3). Together, these data suggested that Akt was a potential downstream target of Aurora kinases in enhancing cancer cell survival.

A recent study reported that Aur-A regulated NF-kappaB via phosphrylation of IkappaBalpha [14]. We further studied whether Aur-A regulated IkappaBalpha and its downstream targets via Akt pathway. Decreased pAkt and elevated IkappaBalpha were detected when cells were transfected with siRNA toward either Akt (Additional file 4) or Aur-A (Fig. 6a), compared with cells transfected with their scramble control respectively. Inhibition of Aur-A chemically also up-regulated IkappaBalpha level (Fig. 6b). Conversely, overexpression of Aur-A increased Akt activity and decreased IkappaBalpha level compared with the vector control (Fig. 6a). We then analyzed the expression of Bcl-xL, which is known as a NF-kappaB target gene closely associated with cell proliferation and apoptosis. Bcl-xL was down-regulated in Aur-A and Akt depleted cells (Fig. 6a). Immunofluorescence staining of NF-kappaB p65 showed that Aur-A overexpression was significantly associated with p65 nuclear translocation whereas p65 was mainly expressed in the cytoplasm in cells transfected with empty vector pCS2+ (Fig. 6c). We further showed that inhibition of PI3K with wortmannin did not prevent either an increase of pAkt and Bcl-xL or a decrease in IkappaBalpha caused by Aur-A overexpression (Fig. 6d). Interestingly, in cells incubated with Akt inhibitor API-2 or siRNA against Akt, overexpression of Aur-A however failed to reduce IkappaBalpha or raise Bcl-xL expression in comparison to the vector control (Fig. 6e and 6f). This suggested that Akt, but not PI3K, was involved in the down-regulation of IkappaBalpha by Aur-A. These results revealed that Aur-A, via its downstream target Akt, down-regulated IkappaBalpha, which then led to NF-kappaB nuclear translocation and subsequently activating NF-kappaB target gene Bcl-xL in enhancing cancer cell survival (Fig. 6g).

Aur-A kinase plays a critical role in tumorigenesis as an oncogenic protein. However, the exact pathway by which Aur-A enhances cell survival has not been well defined. In this study, we showed that Aur-A, via activating Akt pathway, induced NF-kappaB nuclear translocation to promote cell survival. Indeed, overexpression of Aur-A was positively associated with clinic stage and lymph node metastasis in TSCC patients. Moreover, we established a cross-talk between mitotic Aurora kinase and IGF-1-induced PI3K survival pathway, interacting at Akt activation. Combined inhibition of both Aur-A and PI3K led to a synergistic effect on inducing apoptosis and suppressing migration, reassuring an emerging theme of combination therapy in cancer treatment.

Aur-A, a key regulator of mitosis, is essential for centrosome function, spindle assembly, and mitotic entry [1-3]. Dysregulation of Aur-A has been linked to tumorigenesis. Previous studies have also shown that Aur-A functions as a pro-survival protein that counteract apoptosis and induce drug resistance in tumour cells [20]. We and others demonstrated that Aur-A promoted cell survival and migration by Akt activation, and Aur-A activated NF-kappaB via IkappaBalpha phosphorylation [8,9,14]. Nevertheless, a clear pathway from Aur-A activation to cell survival remains to be elucidated. In this study, we showed that inhibition of Aur-A induced cell apoptosis accompanied with suppressing Akt activation, increasing IkappaBalpha level and down-regulating Bcl-xL expression. On the contrary, overexpression of Aur-A led to Akt activation and IkappaBalpha down-regulation, subsequently induced NF-kappaB p65 nuclear translocation to enhance cell survival. Moreover, suppression of Akt by either API-2 or siAkt prevented Aur-A-induced IkappaBalpha reduction and Bcl-xL elevation. Thus, our data demonstrated that Aur-A downregulated IkappaBalpha via Akt activation, triggering NF-kappaB p65 nuclear translocation, and subsequently activating target gene Bcl-xL to promote survival in cancer cells.

Inactivation of PTEN leads to constitutively activate PI3K/Akt pathway. Recently, Aur-A was found to abrogate the DNA-binding and transactivation activity of p53 and subsequently inhibit its downstream target genes including PTEN by phosphorylating Ser 215 [21]. PTEN expression was significantly reduced in Aur-A overexpressed cells with activated Akt activity [22]. Here, we showed that overexpression of Aur-A increased the phosphorylation of Akt at Ser 473 (Fig. 6a). Consistently, previous report showed that Aur-A activated Akt in a p53-dependent manner to induce cell survival and chemoresistance in ovarian cancer cells [9]. Thus, it is conceivable that Aur-A activates Akt via inhibiting PTEN.

Akt promotes cell survival by its ability to phosphorylate and inactivate several pro-apoptotic targets including GSK-3. We showed that inhibition of Aur-A resulted in suppressed phosphorylation of both Akt and GSK-3, according with one recent study that Aur-A promoted cell proliferation by increasing the phosphorylation of GSK-3beta [23]. On the other hand, another work reported that Akt inhibitor A-443654 interfered with mitotic progression by decreasing Aur-A expression, suggesting Akt acts upstream of Aur-A by regulating its transcription level [24]. We and others showed that Aur-A contributed to cell survival, chemoresistance and migration via activation of Akt, suggesting a positive feedback interplaying between Aur-A and Akt.

Akt plays a part in activation of NF-kappaB signaling pathway and exerts a positive effect on NF-kappaB function by phosphorylation and activation of IKK, a kinase that phosphorylates and induces proteolytic degradation of the NF-kappaB inhibitor, IkappaBalpha [25]. Interestingly, several recent reports have suggested that Aur-A kinase may serve both upstream and downstream of the IKK complex components [14,26]. IKK complex includes two catalytic components, IKKalpha and IKKbeta. As a downstream target, Aur-A was phosphorylated by IKKalpha at threonine residue 288, a site which is important for its kinase activity [26]. Depletion of IKKbeta resulted in the up-regulation of Aur-A protein, and IKKbeta functioned as an antagonist of Aur-A signaling during mitosis in normal cells [27]. On the other hand, we showed that Aur-A promoted cell survival through activated IKK/NF-kappaB signaling pathway, consistent with previous reports [14,28]. Thus, there may be a reciprocal regulation between Aur-A and IKK complex.

Activation of Akt was associated with adverse outcome in tongue cancer patients, serving as a significant prognostic factor in TSCC [29]. Multiple growth factors such as IGF-1, VEGF, and EGF facilitate the development and progression of cancer by activating PI3K pathway leading to cell survival and therapeutic resistance [30-32]. Here, we showed that Aur-A was overexpressed in tongue cancer tissue and tightly correlated with clinical stage and lymph node metastasis in patients (Fig. 1 and Table 1). Thus, dysregulation of mitotic Aur-A kinase and abnormal activation PI3K survival pathway are two essential but distinct biological processes in cancer progression. As tumorigenesis is a multiple process, combination therapeutic strategies have shown substantially enhanced anti-tumor effects and reduced side-effects both in vitro and in vivo. A recent study reported that combined treatment with the pan-histone deacetylase inhibitor vorinostat and Aur-A kinase inhibitor MK-0457 (VX-680) showed a synergistic anti-leukemia activity in cultured and primary AML and CML cells [33]. Here, we demonstrated that Aur-A inhibitory VX-680 could markedly reduce IGF-1 induced survival and migration. Furthermore, combinational inhibition of Aur-A and PI3K showed a synergic effect in causing apoptosis and suppressing migration in cancer cells (Fig. 3, 4 and Additional file 1).
