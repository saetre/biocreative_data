69 consecutive patients from Northern Italy (mean age 64.1 +/- 14.6 yy) with recent RVO, were tested for plasma levels of homocysteine (tHcy: fasting and after loading with methionine), cyanocobalamine and folic acid levels (CMIA-Abbot) and looking for MTHFR C677T mutation (Light Cycler-Roche) and compared to 50 volunteers, enrolled as a control group.

Fasting levels of tHcy were significantly higher in patients than in controls: mean value 14.7 +/- 7.7 vs 10.2 +/- 8 nmol/ml. Post load levels were also significantly higher: mean value 42.7 +/- 23.7 vs 30.4 +/- 13.3 nmol/ml; Total homocysteine increase was also evaluated (i.e. Delta-tHcy) after methionine load and was also significantly higher in patients compared to control subjects: mean Delta-tHcy 27.8 +/- 21.5 vs 21.0 +/- 16 nmol/ml (normal value < 25 nmol/ml). Furthermore, patients affected by RVO show low folic acid and/or vitamin B12 levels, although differences with control group did not reach statistical significance. Heterozygous and homozygous MTHFR mutation were respectively in study group 46% and 29% vs control group 56% and 4%.

Conclusion
###end title 10
###begin p 11
our data confirm that hyperhomocysteinaemia is a risk factor for RVO, and also that TT genotype of MTHFR C677T is more frequently associated with RVO: if the mutation per se is a risk factor for RVO remains an open question to be confirmed because another study from US did not reveal this aspect.

Hyperomocysteinemia is modifiable risk factor for thrombotic diseases. Therefore, a screening for tHcy plasma levels in patients with recent retinal vein occlusion could allow to identify patients who might benefit from supplementation with vitamins and normalization of homocysteine levels, in fasting and after methionine load.

Retinal vein occlusion (RVO) is a multifactorial disease which may affect small, medium and large ocular vessels; central vein occlusion represents the most dangerous clinical entity [1]. However, RVO is considered an unusual site of thrombosis [2]. Pathogenesis of RVO may recognise a local disease such as glaucoma, ocular hypertension, optical neuropathy [3] and/or an underlying systemic disease such as hypertension, diabetes, atherosclerosis, dyslipidemia, hyperviscosity syndrome, local or systemic vasculytis [4-8]. Yet, also impairment of normal haemostasis with a trend toward hypercoagulable state has been described. Blandello et al. described increased levels of prothrombin fragment 1+2 and d-dimer [9] and Lijima et al. reported increased levels of thrombin-antithrombin complexes in subjects affected by RVO [10]. Inherited thrombophilia related to clotting inhibitors deficiency (i.e. protein C, Protein S and Antithrombin III deficiencies) [11,12] has been rarely reported such as clotting XII deficiency [13], while data on the role of factor V Leiden are still matter of discussion [14-18] and few data are available on the role of prothrombin A20210G gene polymorphism in RVO pathogenesis [17,19]. Acquired thrombophilia due to the presence of antiphospholipid syndrome (primary or secondary to immunopathological disease) is an established risk factor for RVO [20,21]. Also hypofibrinolysis is a thrombotic risk factor for RVO. Plasminogen deficiency and 4G/5G gene polymorphism of plasminogen activator inhibitor type 1, in fact, have been recently described as risk factors for RVO [22,23].

Homocysteine is a sulphur-containing amino acid, which results from the hydrolysis of S-adenosyl-homocysteine in the methionine metabolic cycle. Several condition may determine an increase of blood homocysteine such as an inadequate folate intake with diet, smoking, drugs (i.e. methotrexate, hormones, antiepileptic), renal failure and inherited gene polymorphism of methylene-tetra-hydro-folate-reductase (MTHFR). Increase in circulating homocysteine may trigger endothelial dysfunction through oxidative damage therefore inducing increased oxidation of low density lipoprotein, stimulation of smooth muscle cell proliferation and hypercoagulable state. Hyperhomocysteinemia has been reported as risk factor for arterial and/or venous thrombosis [24,25]. Yet, hyperhomocysteinaemia has also been described as risk factor for RVO [26], but data on large based population are still lacking.

RVO is a multifactorial disease which includes also retinal vein thrombosis and its pathophysiology may be due to local and/or systemic risk factor [1]. We may recognise several types of RVO depending on the site of occlusion (branch RVO, central RVO, hemicentral RVO) and for localisation in large, medium or small-calibre veins; from a clinical point of view RVO is usually associated with visual loss of variable degree. An association of RVO with impairment of haemostasis with a trend toward hypercoagulable state has frequently been ruled out in case of retinal vein thrombosis by several reports, but a clear relationship seems to have been established only for antiphospholipid syndrome [1,6,19]; other conditions, such as inherited thrombophilia, are less commonly described and the real incidence in these cases seems to be different in several studies [13-18]. A possible explanation could also be related to an ethnic background and to the inclusion criteria of selected patients in the related studies. However, according to available data thrombophilia seems to be more frequent in young patients affected by RVO [28].

In this field, hyperhomocysteinemia has recently been identified as an emerging risk factor for RVO. Several reports in last few years, in fact, described frequently hyperhomocysteinemia in patients affected by RVO [29-34]. In the same reports the real incidence seems to differ not only for ethnical reasons but also for the difference in the criteria used for the inclusion. A relationship between hyperhomocysteinemia and RVO is well established for young subjects, but a lot of available studies focused on patients younger than 55 years [31,32]. Moreover, only a few studies on this topic enrolled more than 50 patients, such as the Blue Mountain Eye Study [28] and a meta-analysis by Cahill et al from US [30], this being a possible cause of underestimation of this issue. On the other hand, only few studies evaluated homocysteine metabolism in a more systematic way [31-35]. Although most studies focused, in fact, on MTHFR C677T gene polymorphism, not all researchers considered folate and vitamin B 12 serum levels.

In the present study we investigated homocysteinemia and MTHFR C677T gene polymorphism and other common variables associated to homocysteine metabolism, such as folate and vitamin B 12 serum levels.

We found data that patients affected by RVO had hyperhomocysteinemia, detected as fasting homocysteinemia and as post-load homocysteinemia, and the differences reached statistical significance (table 2). These data seem to be in agreement with those previously reported by other studies. However, this is the first report also showing total increase of homocysteinemia (i.e. Delta-Hcy) evaluated in patients affected by RVO and this difference also reached statistical significance (table 2).

Serum folate and vitamin B12 levels were also tested because strongly associated to homocysteine metabolism, in terms of a possible therapeutical role. Although serum folate and vitamin B12 levels were lower in patients compared also to control subjects, these differences did not reach statistical significance; however, also these data are in agreement with data reported by Yildirim et al on small population [33].

Yet, our data clearly show that hyperhomocysteinemia is more frequent than other common known risk factors for RVO, apart from hypertension and glaucoma (i.e. diabetes, dyslipidemia, smoking, hyperviscosity syndrome, vasculytis) (table 1). Only glaucoma and hypertension reached, in fact, statistical significance in patients affected by RVO versus control subjects in our study (table 1), confirming a frequent and an interesting possible pathophysiological role of homocysteine metabolism in RVO.

Moreover, the role of hyperhomocysteinemia in patients affected by RVO seems to be confirmed also by the high frequency of MTHFR C677T homozigosity in patients affected by RVO compared to control group (table 2). The TT genotype, in fact, has been associated more frequently to hyperhomocysteinemia, although this high incidence of TT genotype could be associated also to an ethnic background. This could be relevant because an epidemiological study written by Cappuccio et al underlined that TT genotype is more frequent in Caucasian subjects compared to Asian subjects [36] and a previous study by Cahill et al. [30] on subjects from US revealed that hyperhomocysteinemia but not TT genotype of MTHFR was a risk factor for RVO. So, although further studies on large based population should be performed also from a genetic point of view; our data suggest a prompt screening for homocysteine metabolism and MTHFR C677T gene polymorphism (in particular for Caucasian subjects) in patients affected by RVO. Further studied could also be addressed to understand also the role of another emerging MTHFR gene polymorphism (i.e. A1298C) sometime associated to hyperhomocysteinemia [37], alone and/or in association with MTHF C677T gene polymorphism, in large based population affected by RVO.

In conclusion, based on this study, we suggest a careful investigation on several metabolic parameters related to homocysteine metabolism in patients affected by RVO. A screening for hyperhomocysteinemia should be promptly performed particularly in patients without other common risk factors for RVO. These studies could have in fact a deep impact also on therapeutical aspects in order to better understand a possible role of folic acid and vitamin B12 fortification in the management of RVO.
