Background and aims
###end title 1
###begin p 2
Little is known about the intestinal epithelial expression and secretion of CXCL10 (IP-10), a chemokine involved in recruiting T cells and monocytes. We aimed to study CXCL10 gene expression and regulation by the pro-inflammatory cytokines interleukin (IL)-1beta, interferon (IFN)-gamma and tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha in intestinal epithelial cell lines.

CXCL10 expression and secretion kinetics were assessed in Caco-2, HT-29 and DLD1 human colon epithelial cells, treated with IL-1beta, TNF-alpha, IFN-gamma alone or in combination with each other by real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR), Northern blotting and enzyme-linked immunoabsorbent assay (ELISA). Transient transfections with TGL-IP10 (CXCL10 promoter) and TGL-IP10-kappaB2 mutant promoter and gelshifts and supershifts for nuclear factor (NF)-kappaB were also performed.

###begin p 6
Real-time PCRs and ELISA experiments revealed that IL-1beta was the strongest and earliest inducer of CXCL10 messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) expression and protein secretion in Caco-2 cell line, whereas INF-gamma had a delayed kinetics. There was a strong synergistic effect of either TNF-alpha or IL-1beta with IFN-gamma both on CXCL10 mRNA expression and protein secretion in all three cell lines. Real-time PCR and ELISA experiments using a specific NF-kappaB inhibitor and transfection experiments with a NF-kappaB-binding defective CXCL10 promoter construct revealed that the induction of CXCL10 by IL-1beta and its synergism with IFN-gamma is NF-kappaB dependent.

Conclusion
###end title 7
###begin p 8
These data demonstrate that in colonic epithelial cells, depending on the cellular context and utilizing the NF-kappaB pathway, IL-1beta alone and/or in synergism with IFN-gamma may play a major role in the induction of CXCL10.

Intestinal epithelial cells (IECs) form the first immunologic barrier of the organism while the villus surface is continuously in contact with various agents. IEC gene expression is tightly regulated to induce appropriate responses to pathogens and to avoid deleterious reactions to microbial flora. When stimulated with pro-inflammatory cytokines or infected with microbial pathogens, IECs may secrete chemokines, a set of low-molecular weight cytokines, directing migration and activation of leucocytes, which play a major role in the perpetuation of inflammatory processes [1-5]. The final composition of leucocytes present in the inflamed intestine is most likely due to both secreted chemokines and the relative expression of chemokine cell surface receptors on different cell types. Chemokine production by colonic epithelial cells is thought to contribute to the characteristic increased infiltration of selected populations of leucocyte cells in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) [6, 7].

CXCL10 is a CXC chemokine, known to be secreted by endothelial cells [8], keratinocytes [9], eosinophils [10] and neutrophils [11]. It is also constitutively expressed by normal human colon epithelium [12] and chemoattracts activated T cells as well as monocytes by binding to the CXCR3 receptors present on the respective cells [13, 14]. While CXCL10 up-regulation may occur in acute inflammation in response to pathogens, it is also known to be permanently over-expressed in IBD patients [15, 16]. Blocking CXCL10 could prevent mice from acute colitis, suggesting this chemokine to play an important role in IBD pathogenesis [17]. Moreover, CXCL10 is believed to possess anti-tumoural properties by promoting anti-tumour T cell immunity [18, 19]. Knowledge of its regulation in colonic cell lines may therefore give also insight into the pathobiology of colorectal cancer.

Most previous studies on chemokine expression in IEC concentrated on CXCL8 (interleukin [IL]-8), a neutrophil chemoattractant [20, 21], but there were only few studies regarding the expression and secretion of CXCL10 in IECs [12]. Although it is well known that interferon (IFN)-gamma is a major inducer of CXCL10 and that CXCL10 expression may be enhanced by pathogens and other inflammatory cytokines, the relative contribution of cytokines on CXCL10 induction, their synergistic action and the kinetics of cytokine-induced CXCL10 expression in intestinal epithelial cells has not been fully elucidated. Especially, the role of IL-1beta in CXCL10 gene regulation in IECs and also in other cell types has not been fully evaluated so far. Intestinal mucosa is composed of cell populations in continuous change from a proliferative and undifferentiated stage in the basal parts of crypts to mature surface villus epithelial cells [22, 23]. Little is known about the alteration of immunological functions as IECs mature. It has been shown that cellular differentiation affects IEC responsiveness to IL-1beta [24].

In the present study, we aimed to elucidate the role of the pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-1beta, tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha and IFN-gamma, which have established role in IBD pathogenesis, in inducing CXCL10 gene expression in IEC lines. Especially, the role of IL-1beta, one of the most abundantly expressed cytokines, both in normal and inflamed mucosa [25], in inducing CXCL10 expression by IECs and its possible signalling mechanisms was given importance. To consider possible influences of cellular differentiation on cytokine responsiveness, we performed studies on three different colonic epithelial cell lines. Our findings will get an insight into the role of intestinal epithelium in immune responses and in evaluating pathways, which might be targets of present and future pharmacotherapy of IBD and possibly colorectal cancer.

Ribonucleic acid (RNA) was isolated by using Qiagen RNeasy mini kit according to the manufacturer's protocol. The RNA concentrations were determined photometrically using a Gene Quant RNA/deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) calculator (Pharmacia, Freiburg, Germany). RNA was subsequently used for real-time PCR and Northern blot analysis. Reverse transcription of messenger RNA (mRNA) was performed using 1 mug of total cellular RNA. To determine the mRNA expression of CXCL10, real-time PCR was carried out using gene-specific primers for human CXCL10 (Invitrogen GmbH, Karlsruhe) forward 5'-CCA GAA TCG AAG GCC ATC AA-3', reverse 5'-CAT TTC CTT GCT AAC TGC TTT CAG-3' and beta-actin (Invitrogen GmbH) forward 5'-CTG GCA CCC AGC ACA ATG-3', reverse 5'-CCG ATC CAC ACG GAG TAC TTG-3' in an ABI Prism 7000 sequence detection system. PCR reaction was set up with Sybr(R) Green PCR Master mix (Invitrogen) containing 0.3 mumol/l primers each and 1 mul of RT-product in 25 mul volume. A two-step amplification protocol was chosen consisting of initial denaturation at 95degreesC for 10 min followed by 45 cycles with 15 s denaturation at 95degreesC and 30 s annealing/extension at 60degreesC. Finally, a dissociation protocol was performed to control specificity of amplification products.

Relative expression of CXCL10 was then calculated using the comparative threshold-cycle (CT) method. The amount of target mRNA in each sample was normalized to the amount of beta-actin mRNA designated as calibrator, to give DeltaCT (CT beta-actin - CT CXCL10). The relative expression of CXCL10 was calculated as the . MRNA expression is presented as fold increase calculated in relation to unstimulated cells after normalization to beta-actin.

Caco-2, HT29 and DLD1 cells were tested for their ability to respond to pro-inflammatory cytokines by the induction of CXCL10 mRNA expression. Cells were stimulated for 4 h with various concentrations of cytokines, and CXCL10 expression was analysed by real-time PCR. In response to IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha, Caco-2, HT29 and DLD1 cells showed a dose-dependent induction of CXCL10 mRNA (Fig. 2). Increased expression of CXCL10 mRNA was observed when 2 ng/ml IL-1beta was used, while a higher concentration did not further enhance expression. Further, we checked the response of IECs to lower doses of IL-1beta showing a dose response in the range of 0.1 to 1 ng/ml in the induction of CXCL10 mRNA. IL-1beta at a concentration of 0.5 ng/ml was able to induce maximum expression of CXCL10 mRNA at 4 h (data not shown).

Once we confirmed the responsiveness of IECs to pro-inflammatory cytokines, we next examined the mRNA kinetics of CXCL10 induced by the cytokines alone or in combination with each other. Each cell line had a different time course of response when stimulated with respective cytokines and their combinations (Fig. 3a-c). In Caco-2, stimulated with IL-1beta or TNF-alpha, CXCL10 mRNA was induced within the first 40 min, and the induction reached to a peak after 4 h, while IFN-gamma had a later initial effect inducing CXCL10 mRNA after 2 h and reached to a maximum at 8 h. Combination of IL-1beta + IFN-gamma had a stronger synergistic effect in the induction of CXCL10 mRNA within 20 min and reaching to maximum after 4 h, whereas TNF-alpha + IFN-gamma synergistically led to a later induction of CXCL10 mRNA starting at 40 min but had a strong synergistic effect after 8 h when compared to IL-1beta + IFN-gamma (Fig. 3a). In HT29 (Fig. 3b) and DLD1 (Fig. 3c), CXCL10 mRNA time kinetics deviated from that in Caco-2 (Fig. 3a). CXCL10 mRNA was induced after 1 h of stimulation with the respective single cytokines in DLD1. In case of HT29, either TNF-alpha or IFN-gamma alone led to delayed induction of CXCL10 mRNA after 1 h, whereas IL-1beta alone led to an induction starting at 2 h. HT29 and DLD1 cells treated with combinations of IL-1beta + IFN-gamma showed a strong synergistic induction of CXCL10 mRNA within 40 min, whereas the TNF-alpha + IFN-gamma combination led to an even stronger induction of CXCL10 mRNA within 20 min in HT29 and within 40 min in DLD1. IL-1beta + TNFalpha in combination had no synergistic effect on CXCL10 mRNA induction in all the cell lines used for this study. The real-time PCR results could be confirmed by Northern blot analysis in Caco-2 and HT29 cells. However, the detection threshold was not low enough to display basal and single cytokine-induced CXCL10 mRNA (data not shown). Fig. 3Time kinetics of CXCL10 mRNA expression in IECs stimulated with cytokines. a Caco-2, b HT29 and c DLD1 cells were plated at a density of 5 x 105 cells in six-well plates and grown for 24 h and then stimulated with respective cytokines and their combinations.

Real-time PCR was performed for CXCL10, and beta-actin was used as an internal control. Graphs represent the mean +/- SEM of three to five experiments. IFN-gamma led to a significant increase in CXCL10 expression from 2 h onwards. A significant increase (p < 0.05) from control was observed in all expect in those marked as N.S. (non-significant).

To test whether cytokine stimulation of IECs would lead not only to the induction of CXCL10 mRNA but also to the synthesis and secretion of the protein, Caco-2, HT29 and DLD1 cells were incubated with respective cytokines (from 3 to 24 h), and secretion of CXCL10 was detected by ELISA. Under basal conditions, Caco-2 cells secreted 0.012 +/- 0.003 ng/ml CXCL10. Treatment with IL-1beta, TNF-alpha and IFN-gamma led to a time-dependent increase in CXCL10 protein, with IL-1beta being the most potent stimulus during the first 6 h (Fig. 4a). Of importance, after 12 h, CXCL10 secretion was stimulated strongly by IFN-gamma. Co-incubation of Caco-2 with respective cytokines revealed a synergistic effect of IL-1beta + IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha + IFN-gamma on CXCL10 secretion, reaching levels of 3.354 +/- 0.690 and 7.808.1 +/- 0.173 ng/ml after 24 h. The combination of IL-1beta + TNF-alpha had no synergistic effect on CXCL10 secretion when compared to the respective cytokines alone. These time kinetic studies revealed that in Caco-2, IL-1beta alone or in combination with IFN-gamma induced the secretion of CXCL10 very early compared to the combination of TNF-alpha + IFN-gamma, which induced a delayed but stronger synergistic secretion of CXCL10 protein, suggesting that in case of IL-1beta + IFN-gamma, a synergism could take place very early, e.g., at the level of intracellular signal cascades. In HT29 cultures, CXCL10 secretion was not detectable under basal condition. TNF-alpha or IFN-gamma alone led to an induction of CXCL10 protein secretion within 3 h (0.0172 +/- 0.005 and 0.011 +/- 0.001 ng/ml), whereas IL-1beta could not induce the secretion of CXCL10 protein. IL-1beta, TNF-alpha and IFN-gamma led to a time-dependent increase in CXCL10 concentrations in HT29 cell supernatants reaching maximum levels of 0.039 +/- 0.0057, 0.632 +/- 0.0222 and 19.929 +/- 0.838 ng/ml showing that IFN-gamma is the strongest inducer of CXCL10 protein secretion when compared to other two cytokines in this cell line (Fig. 4b). The combinations of TNFalpha + IFN-gamma and IL-1beta + IFN-gamma induced CXCL10 protein secretion to 1.822 +/- 0.109 and 0.410 +/- 0.027 ng/ml within 3 h and led to a maximum of 492.728 +/- 83.776 and 87.158 +/- 7.913 ng/ml after 24 h (Fig. 4b). Fig. 4Time kinetics of CXCL10 protein secretion in Caco-2 and HT29 cells stimulated with cytokines. 5 x 105 cells were plated into six-well plates and grown for 24 h and then stimulated with IL-1beta, TNF-alpha and IFN-gamma as indicated.

TGL-IP10, a promoter-reporter containing 435 bp of human CXCL10 sequence upstream of the transcriptional start site, was used to evaluate the role of IL-1beta, TNF-alpha and IFN-gamma alone or in combination with each other in the transcription of CXCL10. When TGL-IP10-transfected Caco-2 cells were stimulated with single cytokines, IL-1beta (1 ng/ml) led to a stronger induction (6.53 +/- 1.65-fold increase) than TNF-alpha (50 ng/ml) and IFN-gamma (50 ng/ml) alone (2.76 +/- 0.53 and 3.14 +/- 1.2-fold increase). The combination of IL-1beta + IFN-gamma showed a stronger synergistic induction (26.18 +/- 11.68) than the combination of TNF-alpha + IFN-gamma (13.97 +/- 3.25-fold increase) (Fig. 5a). In HT29 cells, when stimulated with single cytokines, IFN-gamma (50 ng/ml) led to a maximum induction (6.52 +/- 0.58-fold increase), followed by TNF-alpha (4.44 +/- 0.16-fold increase) and IL-1beta (1.43 +/- 0.05-fold increase). The combination of IL-1beta + IFN-gamma synergistically led to 12.76 +/- 3.21-fold induction, and TNF-alpha + IFN-gamma led to 26.70 +/- 7.5-fold induction of promoter activity (Fig. 5b). In DLD1 cells (Fig. 5c), IFN-gamma (50 ng/ml) led to a maximum induction (8.06 +/- 0.51-fold increase) of CXCL10 promoter activity followed by TNF-alpha (50 ng/ml) induction (3.59 +/- 0.08-fold increase) and IL-1beta (1 ng/ml) induction (2.32 +/- 0.12-fold increase). The combination of IL-1beta + IFN-gamma led to a 40.72 +/- 12.19-fold induction, and TNF-alpha + IFN-gamma led to a 20.56 +/- 6.27 fold induction. In all three cell lines, the combination of IL-1beta + TNF-alpha had no synergistic effect on CXCL10 promoter activity. Fig. 5Transient transfection analysis of TGL-IP10 in IECs. The CXCL10 promoter containing reporter construct, pTGL-IP10 and pRL-TK (renilla) plasmids, was transiently transfected into a Caco-2, b HT29 and c DLD1 cells. 24 h after transfection, cells were stimulated with cytokines as indicated for 24 h, harvested, and promoter activity was monitored by luciferase assay. Data were normalised with renilla luciferase values and included as fold increase vs control. Data represent the means +/- SEM of three to five independent experiments done in duplicates for each sample. Asterisk indicates an induction significantly different (p < 0.05) from control (C).

Evaluating the role of NF-kappaB in CXCL10 gene expression
###end title 51

To evaluate the possible role of NF-kappaB in cytokine-induced CXCL10 gene expression, experiments with a specific NF-kappaB inhibitor were performed. The effect of BAY 11-7082 on NF-kappaB inhibition was evaluated by reporter assays. BAY11-7082 was able to dose-dependently inhibit IL-1beta-induced pNF-kappaB-SEAP gene reporter activity in Caco-2 cells (data not shown). Based on this experiment, we could determine that 10 muM of BAY11-7082 was sufficient to inhibit the NF-kappaB activation.

The induction of CXCL10 gene expression by cytokines was inhibited by addition of the NF-kappaB-specific inhibitor BAY11-7082 in Caco-2, HT29 and DLD1 cells, with a varying degree of inhibition in the individual cell lines. Inhibition of NF-kappaB led to almost complete inhibition (approximately 90-95% inhibition) of CXCL10 mRNA and protein secretion induced by cytokines in Caco-2 and DLD1 cells (Fig. 6a and c). In DLD1 cells, IL-1beta (1 ng/ml) did not have any inducing effect on CXCL10 secretion. In HT29, inhibition of NF-kappaB had approximately 60-75% inhibitory effect on cytokine-induced CXCL10 mRNA expression and secretion (Fig. 6b). Fig. 6Role of NF-kappaB in cytokine-induced CXCL10 mRNA expression by IECs. 5 x 105 cells were plated and grown for 24 h. Then, the cells were pre-treated with 10 muM of BAY 11-7082 for 1 h and then stimulated with respective cytokines and their combinations as stated in the figure for 2 and 24 h.

To further evaluate the role of NF-kappaB, transient transfections were done with a CXCL10 promoter construct bearing a mutated NFkB-binding site (TGL-IP10 kappaB2 Mut). In Caco-2 cells, TGL-IP10 kappaB2 Mut was not responsive to any of the cytokines and their combinations, suggesting that CXCL10 gene induction is strongly dependent on NF-kappaB in this cell line (Fig. 7a). In HT29 and DLD1 cells, the combination of TNF-alpha + IFN-gamma led to 6.49 +/- 2.13 and 4.87 +/- 1.43-fold increase, and the combination of IL-1beta + IFN-gamma led to 2.26 +/- 0.63 and 4.75 +/- 0.53-fold increase of the TGL-IP10 kappaB2 Mut promoter activity (Fig. 7b and c), revealing that a smaller portion of CXCL10 gene expression might be regulated independently from NF-kappaB.

To confirm further our results from promoter and inhibitor studies, we did gel-shift and super shift assays to show that NF-kappaB is activated by cytokines and that the activated NF-kappaB complex contains the NF-kappaB functional sub-unit p65. In the nuclear extracts of Caco-2 cells, we could clearly see a shift in the samples treated with IL-1beta, TNF-alpha alone or the combinations of IL-1beta + IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha + IFN-gamma. The protein-DNA complex was efficiently competed by unlabelled kappaB oligonucleotides. There was no shift in the samples treated with the NF-kappaB inhibitor BAY11-7082, stating that the shift was indeed because of NF-kappaB binding. Furthermore, antibody super shift assay using anti-p65 antibody had clearly shown that the complex contains NF-kappaB functional sub-unit, p65 (Fig. 8).

Caco-2 cells were seeded and grown for 24 h before pre-treating with BAY 11-7082 (10 muM) for 1 h and then stimulated with respective cytokines for 30 min; cells were then harvested, and nuclear extracts were prepared. 5 mug of nuclear extracts were used for gel shifts with a wild-type kappaB oligonucleotide.

In addition to its many homeostatic functions such as barrier protection, mucus production and resorption, the intestinal epithelium plays an important role in regulating local inflammation and immune responses. The intestinal epithelium participates in inflammatory responses in part through the generation of numerous cytokines and chemokines that mediate recruitment and activation of inflammatory cells. The epithelium is involved in local cytokine networks allowing first response to noxious agents as well as cross-talk with immune cells to help provide an effective inflammatory response. These bi-directional inflammatory communications are necessary for normal host defence, but they also play an important role in the pathogenesis of IBD and might be also of importance in modulating anti-tumoural immunity in colonic malignancies. In this report, we demonstrate that pro-inflammatory cytokines, which may be produced by sub-mucosal immune cells, can differentially and co-ordinately regulate CXCL10 gene expression in IECs.

CXCL10 is one of several chemokines produced by IEC. Previous studies could show that IFN-gamma in combination with TNF-alpha caused induction of RANTES (regulated upon activation, normal t-cell expressed, and secreted protein) and monocyte chemotactic protein-1 in colorectal tumour cell lines, while IFN-gamma had no effect on CXCL8 (IL-8) secretion [27], the latter observation being confirmed in all three cell lines in the present study (data not shown).

Dwinell et al. [12] had previously shown that stimulation of IECs with TNF-alpha or IL-1alpha strongly potentiated IFN-gamma-induced CXCL10. It is well known that among IL-1alpha and IL-1beta, the latter is secreted and has an active role in inflammation. Importantly, IL-1beta was shown to be over-expressed in IBD patients [25, 28]. This makes IL-1beta an interesting cytokine to study its effect on CXCL10 gene regulation. Although the synergistic effects of TNF-alpha + IFN-gamma on CXCL10 gene expression and the signalling mechanisms involved were studied in astrocytes [26] and their synergistic effect on inducible nitric oxide synthase expression in IECs and macrophages [29] had been studied in detail, the synergistic action of these cytokines on CXCL10 gene expression and the signalling mechanisms involved have not been evaluated in IECs. Especially, the role of IL-1beta alone and its synergism with both TNF-alpha and IFN-gamma on CXCL10 gene expression in IECs has been given no attention.

Previously, it has been shown that IECs may express elevated levels of CXCL10 [12], and its expression is increased in the mucosa of patients with IBD [16]. A critical role for CXCL10 in IBD has also been shown in animal models [30, 31]. Apart from this, CXCL10 has been shown to be expressed constitutively in colorectal carcinomas and primary metastatic sites exerting anti-tumour activity by recruiting mononuclear cells via the CXCR3 receptor. However, at the same time, it has also been shown that CXCL10 promoted metastatic adhesion and tumour cell migration [32] so that care should be taken considering CXCL10 as an anti-tumoural therapy option.

In light of these findings, we assessed whether stimulation of IECs in culture by inflammatory mediators could induce CXCL10 gene expression. All three IEC lines we used expressed CXCL10 mRNA in a concentration-dependent manner when stimulated with IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha alone. These data support a vast body of evidence that demonstrates that IFN-gamma can induce CXCL10 expression in a variety of cells types, including granulocytes, T lymphocytes, bronchial epithelial cells and keratinocytes [33, 34], while TNF-alpha is a potent inducer for CXCL10 in hepatocytes [17]. Importantly, in addition to these data, we could also show that Caco-2 cells stimulated with IL-1beta up-regulate CXCL10 mRNA to a significant level, whereas in HT29 and DLD1 cells, induction of CXCL10 mRNA was less pronounced.

A number of authors have reported functional synergy between TNF-alpha and IFN-gamma in promoting gene expression for proteins such as RANTES, IFN regulatory factor 1 (IRF-1), MIG and intercellular adhesion molecule-1[35-38] in a variety of cell types and have demonstrated that this synergy depends on the co-existence of TNF-alpha-responsive NF-kappaB-binding sites and IFN-gamma-responsive signal transducers and activators of transcription (STAT) protein-binding elements within the promoters of the genes of interest [35, 36]. In our study, when IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha were combined, the accumulation of CXCL10 mRNA and protein was elevated compared to unstimulated cells or cells stimulated with either cytokine alone, implying a synergistic effect on transcription of the CXCL10 gene. A synergistic effect by these two cytokines on CXCL10 expression was also demonstrated in astrocytes, and this synergy has been shown to be at least in part dependent on NF-kappaB activation and binding to a NF-kappaB-binding site within the CXCL10 promoter [26].

The synergistic action of IL-1beta with IFN-gamma in IECs has not been characterised so far. Recently, Takami et al. [39] showed the synergistic induction of hepatocyte growth factor in human skin fibroblasts by IL-1beta + IFN-gamma+ IFN-gamma [39]. We here report for the first time that in intestinal epithelial cell lines, IL-1beta alone or in combination with IFN-gamma induced CXCL10 gene expression. In Caco-2 cells, the combination led to an early synergistic induction of both CXCL10 mRNA and protein compared to the combination of IFN-gamma+TNF-alpha. This early induction of CXCL10 mRNA and protein by IL-1beta+IFN-gamma in Caco-2 might be due to the early convergence of signalling pathways that activates transcription factors like NF-kappaB, IRF-1, STAT1 or other factors that mediate transcription factor interactions.

Transient transfections with human CXCL10 promoter [26], in Caco-2, HT29 and DLD1 cells, showed that the synergistic effect of IL-1beta + IFN-gamma and IFN-gamma + TNF-alpha on CXCL10 gene expression in these cell lines was indeed because of the transcriptional synergy employed at the level of the CXCL10 promoter. A number of studies had revealed that cytokines like IL-1beta, TNF-alpha or enteroinvasive bacteria and the bacterial cell wall product lipopolysaccharide induce the expression of several inflammatory genes through the transcription factor NF-kappaB in IECs [40-43]. To find out the signalling mechanism involved in CXCL10 gene expression in IECs, we explored the role of transcription factor NF-kappaB. Inhibition of NF-kappaB with BAY11-7082 clearly inhibited both CXCL10 mRNA and protein induced by single cytokine alone or in combinations in Caco-2, HT29 and DLD1 cells. Gel shift in Caco-2 could confirm that NF-kappaB is activated and binds to consensus kappaB oligonucleotides in cells treated with either IL-1beta or TNF-alpha alone and in combination with IFN-gamma. It was shown previously that the binding complex of NF-kappaB to the kappaB2-binding site of the CXCL10 promoter contains the homodimer of p65 [26]. In our study, super shift assays in Caco-2 cells treated with IL-1beta alone or in combination with IFN-gamma confirmed the presence of p65 in the complexes bound to the consensus kappaB oligo nucleotides. In addition to these experiments, transient transfection experiments with a kappaB2 mutant of the CXCL10 promoter [26] clearly showed that in Caco-2 cells, none of the cytokines and their combinations were able to induce the CXCL10 promoter activity. In HT29 cells, the combination of IFN-gamma + TNF-alpha led to a weaker induction of TGL-IP10kappaB-2 mutant activity, whereas in DLD1cells, the combination of IL-1beta + IFN-gamma and IFN-gamma + TNF-alpha led to a weak induction of TGL-IP10 kappaB-2 mutant activity. Based on these data, we can conclude that NF-kappaB plays a critical role in CXCL10 gene expression induced by cytokines in IECs, and this is mainly dependent on the kappaB-2 site present in its promoter. Moreover, IFN-gamma-induced CXCL10 mRNA and protein secretion was inhibited upon NF-kB inhibition.

Although the present results may reflect only a small aspect in the overall concert of chemokines, it seems apparent that the basic regulatory principles elucidated here might be shared also by a number of other chemokine genes like that of CCL19, which has recently been shown to be regulated by multiple NF-kappaB and IRF family transcription factors in human monocyte-derived dendritic cells [44]. Recently, Hiroi M et.al. [45] showed that co-operation between IFN-gamma induced STAT1, and the constitutively active or inducible NF-kappaB is necessary for the transcriptional activity of IFN-gamma-inducible genes like MIG and CXCL10. Therefore, we suggest a similar mechanism for IFN-gamma-induced CXCL10 in IECs.

The responsiveness to cytokines might depend on the state of differentiation. Schlottmann et. al. [46] recently showed that in contrast to HT29 where IFNgamma up-regulated CXCL8 secretion, the same was unaffected in Caco-2 cells or even down-regulated in primary colonic epithelial cells. Future studies on chemokine regulation should therefore include primary cells, keeping well in mind that the presence of contaminating immune cells, culture conditions and cell stress during isolation may influence results.

Taken together, our data suggest that while IFN-gamma, TNF-alpha and IL-1beta may work individually through disparate signalling pathways in CXCL10 gene regulation, a combination of these cytokines enhances transcription of the CXCL10 gene in an NF-kappaB-dependent manner. The fact that IL-1beta via activation of NF-kappaB is able to mimic the effect of TNF-alpha in augmenting CXCL10 expression might be of importance in patients with IBD, who do not respond to anti TNF-alpha antibody therapy. In those cases, an additional inhibition of IL-1beta might be desirable as a future therapy option in treating IBD.
