The SR protein family is involved in constitutive and regulated pre-mRNA splicing and has been found to be evolutionarily conserved in metazoan organisms. In contrast, the genome of the unicellular yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae does not contain genes encoding typical SR proteins. The mammalian SR proteins consist of one or two characteristic RNA binding domains (RBD), containing the signature sequences RDAEDA and SWQDLKD respectively, and a RS (arginine/serine-rich) domain which gave the family its name. We have now cloned from the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe the gene srp1. This gene is the first yeast gene encoding a protein with typical features of mammalian SR protein family members. The gene is not essential for growth. We show that overexpression of the RNA binding domain inhibits pre-mRNA splicing and that the highly conserved sequence RDAEDA in the RBD is involved. Overexpression of Srp1 containing mutations in the RS domain also inhibits pre-mRNA splicing activity. Furthermore, we show that overexpression of Srp1 and overexpression of the mammalian SR splicing factor ASF/SF2 suppress the pre-mRNA splicing defect of the temperature-sensitive prp4-73 allele. prp4 encodes a protein kinase involved in pre-mRNA splicing. These findings are consistent with the notion that Srp1 plays a role in the splicing process.
