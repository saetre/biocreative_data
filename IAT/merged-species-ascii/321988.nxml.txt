A cDNA clone covering the whole coding region for a glycinin subunit precursor containing the A1a acidic subunit, one of the A2 family, has been identified from a library of soybean cotyledonary cDNA clones using a mixed oligonucleotide probe. Analysis of the cDNA insert revealed that it contained 1746 nucleotides of mRNA sequence with a 5'-terminal nontranslated region of 54 nucleotides, a signal peptide region corresponding to 19 amino acids, an acidic subunit region (A1a) corresponding to 291 amino acids followed by a basic subunit region corresponding to 185 amino acids, and a 3'-terminal nontranslated region of 207 nucleotides. By comparing the predicted protein sequence of this precursor with that of the legumin A precursor of pea, it was found that glycinin A2 subunit family appeared to be more closely related to the legumin than to the A3 subunit family, and that the evolutional rearrangement of glycinin genes has occurred.
