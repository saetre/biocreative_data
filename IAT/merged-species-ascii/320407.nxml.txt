Whey acidic protein (WAP), a hormonally-regulated 14,000 dalton cysteine-rich protein, is the principal whey protein found in rodent milk. Genomic clones encompassing both the 2.8 Kb rat and 3.3 Kb mouse WAP genes have been characterized. The genes consist of four exons and three introns. The middle two exons encode the two cysteine-rich regions which probably form separate protein domains. Homology in the 5' flanking DNA of the mouse and rat extends at least 325 bp upstream of the putative CAP site, including a precisely conserved stretch of 50 bp around the unusual TATA and CAAT sites. The homology previously observed between the 3' noncoding sequences of the rat and mouse mRNAs extends at least 20 bp into the 3' flanking region. Several potential glucocorticoid receptor binding sites have been found in the 5' flanking region of the WAP gene. The conservation of the 5' flanking region of the WAP genes may be related to regulation of expression of WAP by peptide and/or steroid hormones.
