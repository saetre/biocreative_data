The oncogenic isoform of the p63 protein, delta Np63 (DeltaNp63), plays an important role in the pathogenesis of many epithelial carcinomas, and emerging evidences suggest that DeltaNp63 is a promising drug target. However, the functions of DeltaNp63 in transitional cell carcinoma of bladder (TCCB) are poorly defined. In this study, a DeltaNp63 shRNA expression vector was transfected into TCCB cell line 5637 and cell cycling, cell proliferation and protein expression were assessed by flow cytometry and 3-(4, 5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2, 5-dimethyl tetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay, and immunohistochemistry, respectively. The DeltaNp63 shRNA expression vector was also injected into 5637 cell xenograft tumors in nude mice, and tumor size was measured, tumor tissue morphology was assessed by immunohistopathology and transmission electron microscopy. In the in vitro study, DeltaNp63 shRNA transfection caused successful DeltaNp63 gene silencing and resulted in significant arrest of cell cycling and cellular proliferation (p<0.05) as well as cyclin D1 expression. In the nude mouse xenograft model, DeltaNp63 shRNA greatly inhibited tumor growth, induced tumor cell apoptosis (p<0.05) and resulted in cyclin D1 downregulation. Our data suggest that DeltaNp63 may play an oncogenic role in TCCB progression through promoting cell survival and proliferation. Intratumoral administration of DeltaNp63-specific shRNA suppressed tumor DeltaNp63 expression and cellular proliferation while promoted tumor cellular apoptosis, and therefore inhibited tumor growth and improved survival of xenograft-bearing mice, which was not accompanied by significant signs of systemic toxicity.

The p63 gene is a member of the p53 gene family and it shares a high degree of homology and remarkable structural similarity with p53 gene (1, 2). Therefore, the p63 protein was originally thought to be another tumor suppressor functioning in a similar capacity to p53. However, p63 has been demonstrated to have divergent roles. It is a key transcriptional regulator of the proliferation and differentiation cascade in stratified epithelia (3), it exhibits tissue-specific roles in normal development and a complex contribution to tumorigenesis which is due to its expression as multiple protein isoforms (4). According to different amino terminals, p63 has two major isoforms: TAp63 and DeltaNp63. TAp63 has a transactivating amino terminal while DeltaNp63 has a dominant negative activating amino terminal (5-8). In general, the TAp63 isoform behaves like p53 because they transactivate various p53 downstream targets and induce apoptosis, mediate cell cycle control. In contrast, the DeltaNp63 isoform has been shown to display functions opposite to that of the TAp63 isoform, including acting as oncoproteins (9-12). DeltaNp63 overexpression is often observed in and enhances oncogenic growth of squamous cell carcinomas (11, 13). DeltaNp63 could function as dominant-negative molecule against the p53 tumor suppressor activities (5). DeltaNp63 overexpression induces nuclear accumulation of beta-catenin and activates beta-catenin signaling that promotes cell proliferation (12). Nowadays, many researchers tend to agree with the concept that TAp63 plays a more p53-like role, whereas DeltaNp63 has an antagonistic or even oncogenic role in cancer progression (11, 14-17).

Our previous study demonstrated that DeltaNp63 was overexpressed in human transitional cell carcinoma of bladder (TCCB) tissues at both mRNA and protein levels, so we hypothesize that DeltaNp63 promotes the survival and proliferation of both epithelial stem cells and TCCB cells. However, the specific role of DeltaNp63 in TCCB development remains largely unclear and the mechanisms by which DeltaNp63 promotes cell survival remain to be elucidated. Understanding the regulation and mechanistic contributions of DeltaNp63 in TCCB may ultimately provide new therapeutic opportunities for this disease. Thus, the objective of this study was to better understand the functions of DeltaNp63 in TCCB with a human TCCB cell line 5637 in vitro and in a nude mouse xenograft model where the expression of DeltaNp63 was silenced by RNA interference (RNAi) technology.

A pair of effective short hairpin RNA (shRNA) against DeltaNp63 mRNA was selected from a preliminary experiment. The pair of shRNA forms a structure consisting of two 19-bp stem targeting DeltaNp63 mRNA, a 9-bp loop and a short poly(A)6 sequence. Two oligonucleotides, forward, 5'-GATCCGTGCCCAGACTCAATTTAGTTTCAAGACGACTAAATTGAGTCTGGGCATTTTTTGTCGACA-3', reverse, 5'-AGCTTGTCGACAAAAAATGCCCAGACTCAATTTAGTCGTCTTGAAACTAAATTGAGTCTGGGCACG-3', were synthesized and ligated directly into BamHI and HindIII linearized genesil-1 plasmid (Jingsai Inc, Wuhan, China). The recombinant DeltaNp63-shRNA expression construct, pDeltaNp63-shRNA, was confirmed by using PstI+SalI double digestion and by gene sequencing. The negative control plasmid, termed pDeltaNp63-cRNA has an sequence insert at the same place from the following two oligonucleotides: forward, 5'-GATCCGACTTCATAAGGCGCATGCTTCAAGACGGCATGCGCCTTATGAAGTCTTTTTTGTCGACA-3'; reverse, 5'-AGCTTGTCGACAAAAAAGACTTCATAAGGCGCATGCCGTCTTGAAGCATGCGCCTTATAAGTCG-3'.

Human TCCB cell line 5637 was purchased from the Institute of Cell Research, Shanghai, Chinese Academy of Sciences. The cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium (Gibico, Shanghai, China) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS, Sijixin Inc., Beijing, China) and 1% penicillin-streptomycin (Invitrogen, Shanghai, China). All cells were cultured at 37℃ with 5% CO2. For transfection, cells were seeded in 6-well plates at 1 x 106 cells per well and allowed to grow overnight to approximately 80% confluence. For each well, cells were transfected with the mixture of 0.4 microg pDeltaNp63-shRNA or pDeltaNp63-cRNA or 0.4 microL phosphate-buffered solution (PBS) and 10 microL Effectene transfection reagent (Qiagen, Shanghai, China) in 600 microL fresh 1640 culture medium. Forty-eight hours after transfection, cells were harvested for immunocytochemistry, reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) or flow cytometry analysis as described below.

Female BALB/c nude mice, 4 weeks of age, weighting 13+/-0.5 g, were purchased from Experimental Animal Center of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shanghai, China. Mice were housed in microisolator cages in a specific pathogen-free (SPF) condition with 12-hr light-dark cycles. Mice were subcutaneously implanted with 2 x 106 5637 cells. Once tumors reached approximately 60 microL in volume, the mice were allocated to receive either pDeltaNp63-shRNA or pDeltaNp63-cRNA vector or PBS. Complexes of 20 microg vector (or PBS)+4 microL in vivo-jetPEItrade mark (polyplus-transfection Inc., Shanghai, China)+160 microL 5% glucose were directly injected into the tumor once a week for five weeks. Tumor dimensions were measured weekly and the tumor volumes calculated using the formula: [1/2] x a x b2, where a and b, respectively, represented the larger and smaller tumor diameter. At the end of the five week treatment, mice were killed by overdose of ketamine (400 mg/kg) and xylazine (50 mg/kg) and necropsy was performed. Tumor tissue samples were prepared for immunohistochemistry or RT-PCR or transmission electron microscopy. Tumor growth inhibition (TGI) was calculated using the formula TGI (%)=(1-MT/MC) x 100, where MT and MC are the mean tumor masses in the treatment group, and control group, respectively.

As previously reported (18), TCCB cell line 5637 inherently expresses high levels of DeltaNp63. Following transfection of pDeltaNp63-shRNA, at 48 hr later, the relative DeltaNp63 mRNA expression levels (DeltaNp63/beta-actin) were 0.156+/-0.07 for cells transfected with pDeltaNp63-shRNA, 0.749+/-0.02 for cells transfected with the control vector, and 0.786+/-0.04 for cells transfected with PBS. Compared with the control RNA vector, the expression levels of DeltaNp63 mRNA were significantly inhibited by DeltaNp63 shRNA (p<0.05) (Fig. 1).

The expression levels of DeltaNp63 protein were detected at 48 hr post-transfection by immunocytochemistry. DeltaNp63 proteins positive cells should be stained brown in the nuclei. Cells transfected with PBS or the control vector were strongly stained in the nuclei (Fig. 2A, B), while cells transfected with pDeltaNp63-shRNA were only weakly stained in the nuclei (Fig. 2C). These demonstrated that DeltaNp63 shRNA inhibited DeltaNp63 protein expression significantly.

Proliferation of 5637 cells was evaluated with the MTT assay (Fig. 4). The absorbance-time curves showed that the absorbance of cells transfected with pDeltaNp63-shRNA was significantly lower than that of cells treated with the control vector or PBS. The difference is especially significant at 120 hr post-transfection. The result indicated that the proliferation of TCCB cell line 5637 was significantly inhibited by DeltaNp63 gene silencing.

The effects of DeltaNp63 gene silencing on the expression of cyclin D1 was evaluated by immunochemistry staining which was performed both in 5637 cell line in vitro and in nude mouse xenograft tumor. Cells with positive cyclin D1 protein expression should be stained brown in the nuclei. Both in 5637 cells in culture (Fig. 5) and in its nude mouse xenograft tumor (Fig. 6), cells transfected with pDeltaNp63-shRNA were stained weakly positive in the nuclei, while cells treated with PBS or the control vector were stained strongly positive in the nuclei. These results suggested that silencing of DeltaNp63 expression is associated with downregulation of cyclin D1 expression in 5637 cells.

Histological assessment revealed that, compared to control shRNA and PBS treated mice, more inflammatory cells and sometimes zones of necrosis were found in tumor tissues of mice treated with pDeltaNp63-shRNA (data not shown). Transmission electron microscopy indicated that disintegration of nucleolus, vacuoles in cytoplasm, inflammatory cell infiltration and apoptotic body formation could be observed in tumor tissues treated with PDeltaNp63-shRNA (Fig. 8A, B) which were rarely seen in tumor tissues treated with the PDeltaNp63-cRNA or PBS (Fig. 8C, D)

The ability of RNAi mediated by shRNA to silence individual gene expression with a high degree of specificity presents a unique opportunity to study gene functions (19, 20). Plasmid and viral vectors producing shRNA using the polymerase III promoter offer efficient and stable gene silencing (21, 22). In this study, we constructed a DeltaNp63 shRNA expression plasmid, which achieved efficient and specific DeltaNp63 gene silencing in human TCCB cell line 5637 following transfection both in vitro and in a nude mouse xenograft model. With DeltaNp63 gene silencing, the cell cycle of 5637 cells was arrested in G0/G1 phase and cellular proliferation was significantly suppressed. DeltaNp63 gene silencing by specific shRNA in the nude mouse xenograft tumor resulted in marked retardation of tumor growth and increase in tumor cell apoptosis. Our data suggested that DeltaNp63 might play an oncogenic role in TCCB progression through promoting cell survival and proliferation. Therefore, DeltaNp63 might be a new target gene for TCCB gene therapy, and DeltaNp63 shRNA might be a novel and promising approach for silencing DeltaNp63 expression.

One interesting new finding in our study is that cyclin D1 expression was downregulated after silencing of DeltaNp63 expression in 5637 cells both in vitro and in vivo, indicating cyclin D1 might be a target gene of DeltaNp63. DeltaNp63 shares homology with the DNA-binding domain of p53, and numerous studies have reported that DeltaNp63 proteins could bind to p53 consensus DNA sequences (23, 24). Cyclin D1 had previously been identified to have a p53 binding site. Cyclin D1 is a key regulator of cell cycle progression and a proven oncogene in several cancers, including urinary bladder carcinoma (25). It regulates cell cycle progression by activating cyclin-dependent kinases 4 and 6 (CDK4 and CDK6), which in turn phosphorylates the retinoblastoma protein (Rb), leading to the inactivated pRB, releasing of transcription factor E2F and cell progression through G1/S checkpoint (26-30). The strong positive correlation between DeltaNp63 and cyclin D1 expression found in our study suggests that DeltaNp63 might regulate TCCB cell cycle through regulating the expression of cyclin D1 which leads to less efficient phosphorylation of Rb which is a key condition for cells to pass G1/S regulation point (31, 32). Therefore, cyclin D1 downregulation could lead to cell cycle arrest in G0/G1 phase, inhibition of cellular proliferation and promotion of apoptosis.

In conclusion, this study demonstrated that DeltaNp63 plays an oncogenic role in TCCB cells. Targeting this oncoprotein using a shRNA expressing vector induced specific silencing of the gene. Suppression of DeltaNp63 expression impaired TCCB tumor growth in vivo and improved the survival of tumor-bearing nude mice. These effects are associated with impaired cellular proliferation and increased apoptosis. At the molecular level, our study suggests that cyclin D1 might be one of the target genes of DeltaNp63.
