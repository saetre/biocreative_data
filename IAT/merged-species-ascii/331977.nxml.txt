The 5'-flanking region of the bovine prolactin gene was cloned and sequenced. The expression of chimeric gene constructs containing 5'-flanking DNA fragments from the prolactin gene joined to a reporter gene encoding human growth hormone (hGH) was examined using transiently transfected rat pituitary cells. Prolactin nucleotide sequences located at position -1213 to -925 enhance the basal level of expression of growth hormone by 5-fold and function in a position- and orientation-independent fashion. In addition to increasing the basal level of growth hormone expression, this enhancer element also responds to induction by epidermal growth factor. The nucleotide sequence of the bovine prolactin gene enhancer element is highly similar to an enhancer element located approximately -1.5 kb from the rat prolactin transcription initiation site. Deletion analysis of the enhancer region shows that sequences -1124 to -985 are necessary and sufficient for enhancer activity.
