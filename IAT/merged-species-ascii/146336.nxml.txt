Transcription factor E4TF1 is the human homolog of GABP and has been renamed hGABP (human GABP). hGABP is composed of two types of subunits; hGABP beta1/E4TF1-53 and the ets-related protein hGABP alpha/E4TF1-60. Both bind together to form an (alpha)2(beta1)2 heterotetrameric complex on DNA and activate transcription at specific promoters in vitro. Tetramer formation depends on two regions of hGABP beta1; the N-terminal region containing the Notch/ankyrin-type repeats is necessary for binding to hGABP alpha and the C-terminal region is necessary for homodimerization. In this report, we constructed various deletion mutants of hGABP beta1 in order to delimit the functional regions required for nuclear localization and transcription activity. We found that hGABP beta1 localization in the nucleus is dependent on a region located between amino acids 243 and 330 and that the presence of hGABP beta1 influences the efficiency of hGABP alpha transport into the nucleus. Next, we demonstrated that the hGABP complex composed of alpha and beta1 subunits activates transcription from the adenovirus early 4 promoter in vivo. This transcription activation needs the C-terminal region of hGABP beta1 and is consistent with results obtained with the in vitro assay. Furthermore, site-directed mutagenesis analysis of the C-terminal region reveals that the alpha-helix structure and the leucine residues are important for formation of a heterotetrameric complex with hGABP alpha in vitro and for transcription activation in vivo. These results suggest that hGABP beta1 stimulates transcription as part of a heterotetrameric complex with hGABP alpha in vivo.
