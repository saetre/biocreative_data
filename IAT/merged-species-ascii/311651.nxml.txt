The TRP4 gene of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, encoding the anthranilate phosphoribosyl transferase, was isolated and subcloned by functional complementation in yeast. A 2 kb fragment containing information for a polypeptide of 380 amino acids and the 5'- and 3'-flanking regions was sequenced. The TRP4 transcript was identified and mapped with S1 nuclease. Homologies to two prokaryotic genes encoding the same function, and sequences potentially involved in transcription start and termination and in regulation of TRP4 gene expression are discussed.
