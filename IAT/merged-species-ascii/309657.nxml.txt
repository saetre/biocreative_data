We have identified a second DNA-binding protein in sea urchin embryo mitochondria, which interacts with a binding site in the major replication pause region, at the junction of the genes for ATP synthase subunit 6 and cytochrome c oxidase subunit III (COIII). We provisionally designate this protein mtPBP2, to distinguish it from the previously characterized mitochondrial pause-region binding protein mtPBP1, whose properties and binding site are quite distinct. The high-affinity binding site for mtPBP2 lies at the 5' end of the COIII gene, and exhibits partial dyad symmetry, although modification interference analysis indicates that recognition is complex. Binding of mtPBP2 to this site induces a bend of approximately 45 degrees in the DNA. Southwestern blots show that mtPBP1 and 2 are both single polypeptides, of apparent molecular weights 25 kD and 18 kD respectively. In vitro, mtPBP1 and mtPBP2 bind independently to their high-affinity sites, which are separated by about 50 bp.
