A recombinant human DNA library was screened using probes corresponding to the chick alpha 1 (II) procollagen gene. This resulted in the isolation of 2 different genomic clones, LgHCol(II)a and LgHCol(II)b. LgHCol(II)a was identified as corresponding to the alpha 1(II) gene by comparative hybridization and DNA sequence analysis. DNA sequence established that LgHCol(II)a extends at least from amino acid 694 of the triple helix through 54 amino acids of the COOH-propeptide. Hybridization with a probe containing only the exon at the 3' end of the chicken gene suggests that the clone contains the 3' end of the human gene. Thus LgHCol(II)a contains approximately 40% of the coding sequences of the human type II collagen gene.
