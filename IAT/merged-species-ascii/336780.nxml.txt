Although pancreatic ribonucleases are extensively studied proteins, little information is available on nucleic acids coding for these enzymes. Here, for the first time, the structure of a gene coding for such an enzyme, the well known bovine pancreatic ribonuclease, is reported. The coding region of this gene is devoid of introns, whereas the 5' untranslated sequence of the pancreatic transcript contains an intron of 735 nucleotides. This intervening sequence is endowed with signals (CAAT and TATA boxes) which might act as regulatory elements. The structural organization of this gene suggests that the sequence coding for the bovine pancreatic ribonuclease might be expressed under the control of two different promoters.
