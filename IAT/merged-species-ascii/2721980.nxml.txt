Background

###begin p 3
We have recently reported that mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) JNK1 downregulates beta-catenin signaling and plays a critical role in regulating intestinal homeostasis and in suppressing tumor formation. This study was designed to determine whether JNK2, another MAPK, has similar and/or different functions in the regulation of beta-catenin signaling.

We used an in vitro system with manipulation of JNK2 and beta-catenin expression and found that activated JNK2 increased GSK3beta activity and inhibited beta-catenin expression and transcriptional activity. However, JNK2-mediated downregulation of beta-catenin was blocked by the proteasome inhibitor MG132 and GSK3beta inhibitor lithium chloride. Moreover, targeted mutations at GSK3beta phosphorylation sites (Ser33 and Ser37) of beta-catenin abrogated JNK2-mediated suppression of beta-catenin. In vivo studies further revealed that JNK2 deficiency led to upregulation of beta-catenin and increase of GSK3-beta phosphorylation in JNK2-/- mouse intestinal epithelial cells. Additionally, physical interaction and co-localization among JNK2, beta-catenin and GSK3beta were observed by immunoprecipitation, mammalian two-hybridization assay and confocal microscopy, respectively.

In general, our data suggested that JNK2, like JNK1, interacts with and suppresses beta-catenin signaling in vitro and in vivo, in which GSK3beta plays a key role, although previous studies have shown distinct functions of JNK1 and JNK2. Our study also provides a novel insight into the crosstalk between Wnt/beta-catenin and MAPK JNKs signaling.

The Wnt/beta-catenin signaling plays a critical role in embryonic development and the regulation of homeostatic self-renewal in a number of adult tissues [1]. However, an aberrant activation of Wnt/beta-catenin signaling, such as beta-catenin accumulation and nuclear translocation, leads to transactivation of transcription of a broad range of genes and contributes to carcinogenesis, although this signaling pathway could be regulated by other signaling, molecules or pathways, including a destruction complex consisting of casein kinase Ialpha (CKIalpha), glycogen synthase kinase 3beta (GSK3beta), adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) and Axin. We recently reported that mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) JNK1 interacts with and negatively regulates beta-catenin signaling through GSK3beta [2], and that the beta-catenin alteration is likely to be associated with intestinal tumor formation induced by JNK1 inactivation [2].

Recently, an increasing body of evidence supported the crosstalk between MAPK and Wnt/beta-catenin signaling [3]-[8]. It was reported that p38 MAPK regulates canonical Wnt/beta-catenin signaling by inactivation of GSK3beta [7], [8]. However, JNK1, another important member of MAPK, was suggested to antagonize Wnt/beta-catenin signaling by activating GSK3beta [2].

The JNKs are encoded by three genes, namely JNK1, JNK2, and JNK3. JNK1 and JNK2 are ubiquitously expressed, whereas the expression of JNK3 is largely restricted to brain, heart, and testis [9]. Numerous studies have reported distinct functions of JNK1 and JNK2, for example, mice harboring JNK1 or JNK2 inactivation exhibited opposite susceptibility to tumor formation induced by 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA) [10], [11]. In this study, we found that, like JNK1, JNK2 interacts with and inhibits beta-catenin signaling, in which GSK3beta functions upstream of proteasome pathway and plays a critical role in JNK2-mediate beta-catenin degradation.

The studies from us and others have demonstrated that JNK1 can antagonize the canonical Wnt/beta-catenin signaling [2], [4]. To elucidate the potential role of JNK2 in the regulation of Wnt/beta-catenin signaling, constitutively active JNK2 (MKK7-JNK2) was co-transfected with beta-catenin into HEK293T cells. As shown in figure 1A (Lane 3 versus lane 1), beta-catenin protein level was dramatically reduced in MKK7-JNK2-transfected HEK293T cells, even to a greater extent than that in MKK7-JNK1-transfected cells (Figure 1A, lane 3 versus 2), suggesting that both JNK1 and JNK2 activation downregulate beta-catenin expression although to a different extend.

To determine whether activated JNK2 can inhibit the aberrantly accumulated nuclear beta-catenin in cancer cells, a human lung cancer cell line A549 was transfected with MKK7-JNK2. Immunoblotting analysis showed a reduction of endogenous beta-catenin protein (Figure 1B), which is consistent with the observation made in HEK293T cells. However, the degree of beta-catenin suppression in A549 was less than that in HEK293T cell, which might be a result of biological differences between HEK293T cells and the transformed human lung cancer cells.

beta-catenin interacts with TCF-4 and stimulates gene expression. To determine whether JNK2 activation can affect the beta-catenin-driven gene transription, MKK7-JNK2 was co-transfected with beta-catenin into HEK293T cells along with TCF-4 reporter plasmid TOPFLASH or the inactive control FOPFLASH. TOPFLASH includes a luciferase reporter driven by three copies of TCF binding elements upstream of the thymidine kinase (TK) minimal promoter, and is specifically regulated by Wnt/beta-catenin signaling [18]. TOPFLASH used here is different from LEF1-Luciferase reporter used in a recent report [6]. The latter contains seven LEF1 binding sites, in p301fosCAT plasmid, containing the minimal fos promoter linked to the chloramphenicol accetyltransferase (CAT) gene [19]. Upon transfection of beta-catenin, the TOPFLASH reporter activity increased by about 10-fold (Figure 1C), although no change was observed in the cells transfected with the empty pcDNA3-HA control vector. However, MKK7-JNK2 transfection strongly suppressed the beta-catenin-induced TOPFLASH reporter activity even to a greater extent than MKK7-JNK1 (Figure 1C). The similarities between the regulations of beta-catenin-driven transactivation and beta-catenin protein level by JNK1 and JNK2 activation implicates that, the inhibitory effect of activated JNK2 on beta-catenin-driven transactivation is probably attributed to the downregulation of beta-catenin protein. Taken together, these data demonstrate for the first time a negative regulation of Wnt/beta-catenin signaling by JNK2 activation.

To confirm the suppression of Wnt/beta-catenin signaling by JNK2 activation, a constant level of beta-catenin was co-transfected with increasing amounts of MKK7-JNK2 into HEK293T cells. The alterations of exogenous beta-catenin were assessed by immunoblotting. As shown in figure 2A, a slight decrease in beta-catenin protein level was seen with 810 ng of pMKK7-JNK2, and a dramatic reduction in beta-catenin protein level was observed with higher amounts of pMKK7-JNK2. The effect of increasing amounts of MKK7-JNK2 on beta-catenin-induced transaction was also evaluated using a luciferase activity assay. As shown in figure 2B, co-transfection of 150 ng of pMKK7-JNK2 suppressed the TOPFLASH reporter activity by 50% and 300 ng suppressed it by 65%. Taken together, these data demonstrate a dose-dependent inhibition of Wnt/beta-catenin signaling by JNK2 activation.

Cytoplasmic beta-catenin protein levels are regulated by ubiquitination and subsequent proteasomal degradation. To determine whether the decrease of beta-catenin protein induced by JNK2 activation is due to increased proteasomal degradation, a proteasomal inhibitor MG132 [20] was used to treat HEK293T cells after transfection with MKK7-JNK2 and beta-catenin. As shown in figure 3A, MG132 blocked JNK2-induced beta-catenin inhibition (lane 4 versus 3), demonstrating that JNK2-caused beta-catenin degradation was through proteasomal degradation system.

Multiple pathways have been reported to mediate beta-catenin degradation by the proteasome, such as p53/Siah-1/APC, Wnt/GSK3beta/APC, and retinoid X receptor (RXR)-mediated pathway [21]. To determine the role of the most common GSK3beta-regualated pathway in the downregulation of beta-catenin by JNK2 activation, we detected the phosphorylation status of GSK3beta. GSK3beta could be inactivated by phosphorylation at Ser-9 by serine/threonine kinases, such as Akt, protein kinase A (PKA), and protein kinase C (PKC), followed by decreased activities [22]-[24]. Thus, GSK3beta phosphorylation at Ser-9 has been used as an indirect marker of decreased GSK3beta activity. As shown in figure 1A, Ser-9 phosphorylation of GSK3beta (p-GSK3beta) was indeed decreased in MKK7-JNK2-transfected HKE293T cells, which meant that GSK3beta activity was increased by activated JNK2. The expression pattern of p-GSK3beta is similar to that of beta-catenin, leading us to postulate that the beta-catenin degradation is attributed to the increased GSK3beta activity induced by JNK2 activation. In fact, increased GSK3beta activity and corresponding downregulation of beta-catenin were also seen in A549 cells (Figure 1B).

To further test our hypothesis, GSK3beta inhibitor lithium chloride (LiCl) was used to suppress GSK3beta activity and the effect of activated JNK2 on beta-catenin expression was analyzed. As shown in figure 3B, LiCl inhibited GSK3beta activity which was indicated by an increase of GSK3beta phosphorylation (lane 2 versus 1; lane 4 versus 3). The ability of activated JNK2 to downregulate beta-catenin was almost completely abrogated upon LiCl treatment (lane 4 versus 3), suggesting that GSK3beta is required for JNK2-mediated beta-catenin degradation.

Post-translational modifications play critical role in the regulation of the beta-catenin turnover by GSK3beta [25]. To further confirm the role of GSK3beta in beta-catenin degradation induced by JNK2 activation, we generated series of constructs expressing beta-catenin mutants [2] and co-transfected them with pMKK7-JNK2 into HKE293T cells. As shown in figure 3C, S33Y, S33F, or S37A mutation endowed beta-catenin with less susceptibility to degradation induced by JNK2 activation, further demonstrating the requirement of GS3beta for JNK2-mediated degradation of beta-catenin.

Besides the indirect phosphorylation and degradation of beta-catenin by JNK2 via GSK3beta from our present study, a recent study has identified three more phosphorylation sites in beta-catenin protein, two of them (Ser-191 and Ser-605) are critical for beta-catenin stabilization and nuclear localization, and could be directly phosphorylated by JNK2, providing more evidences of the different roles of JNK2 in Wnt/beta-catenin signaling [6]. However, JNK1 is not likely to have such a strong influence to phosphorylate Ser-191/605 of beta-catenin [6].

To validate the regulation beta-catenin by JNK2 in vivo, JNK2-/- and +/+ mice were dissected. As shown in figure 4, beta-catenin and its downstream target CDK4 were upregulated in intestinal epithelial cells from JNK2-/- mice, compared to the JNK2+/+ mice. Consistently, phosphorylated GSK3beta was upregulated although total GSK3beta was not changed. The in vivo data provided additional evidence that GSK3beta is involved in JNK2-mediated beta-catenin regulation.

Although our data strongly demonstrate that JNK2 suppresses beta-catenin signaling through GSK3beta-proteasome pathway, the mechanism underlying the regulation of GSK3beta activity by active JNK2 remains elusive. In addition, we can not exclude the possibility that JNK2 can directly interact with beta-catenin. Therefore, immunoprecipitation assays were carried out to test a potential interaction between JNK2, GSK3beta, and/or beta-catenin. As shown in figure 5A, both beta-catenin and GSK3beta can be seen in the precipitate by anti-Flag tag antibody (lane 2), but they were absent in the cells without Flag-tagged constitutively active JNK2 (lane 1), indicating that active JNK2 indeed interacted with GSK3beta and beta-catenin. It is possible that JNK2, GSK3beta and beta-catenin form a multi-protein complex since cytoplasmic interaction of GSK3beta and beta-catenin has been found [26], [27]. The interaction between JNK2 and beta-catenin was further validated by mammalian two-hybridization system (Figure 5B) and co-localization analysis (Figure 5C), as we reported recently [2]. As shown in figure 5C, active JNK2 was co-localized with beta-catenin in the nucleus and cytoplasm, consistent with the results from the immunoprecipitation assays.

Since overexpressed beta-catenin is mainly restricted in the nucleus as shown in figure 5C and reported previously [2], [4], it is postulated that activated JNK2 promotes beta-catenin degradation by increasing GSK3beta and proteasome activity and potentially degrading beta-catenin in the cytoplasm by driving beta-catenin translocation. In fact, JNK1 was also reported to antagonize Wnt/beta-catenin signaling by expelling beta-catenin out of nucleus [4] and promoting its degradation [2]. However, a recent report revealed that JNK2 interacts with beta-catenin and mediates the phosphorylation of beta-catenin by Rac1, which is critical for the nuclear accumulation of beta-catenin in response to Wnt signaling [6]. Comparing the present study to our recent findings and other studies, we postulate that the role of JNK1 or JNK2 in canonical Wnt signaling depends on the duration, degree, tissue, and/or subcellular location of its activation.

In conclusion, our present data demonstrate that activated JNK2 promoted beta-catenin degradation and inhibited the canonical Wnt/beta-catenin signaling in vitro, and that JNK2 deficiency upregulated beta-catenin signaling in vivo, in which GSK3beta is likely to play a critical role. Our study also provides a novel insight into the crosstalk between Wnt/beta-catenin and MAPK JNKs signaling.
