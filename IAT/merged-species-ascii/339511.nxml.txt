5-Aminolevulinate synthase, the first and rate-controlling enzyme of heme biosynthesis, is regulated in the liver by the end-product heme. To study this negative control mechanism, we have isolated the chicken gene for ALA-synthase and determined the nucleotide sequence. The structural gene is 6.9 kb long and contains 10 exons. The transcriptional start site for ALA-synthase was determined by primer extension analysis. A fragment of 291 bp from the 5' flanking region including 34 bp of the first exon shows promoter activity when introduced upstream of a chicken histone H2B gene and injected into the nuclei of Xenopus laevis oocytes.
