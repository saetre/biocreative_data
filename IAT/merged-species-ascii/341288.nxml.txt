We have determined the sequence coding for human alpha 1-acid glycoprotein from two independently isolated cDNA clones and a genomic clone. The aminoacid sequences deduced from the three clones, deriving from three different individuals, are identical. Southern blot analysis on human DNA indicates that there are at least two genes coding for alpha 1-AGP. We propose that alpha 1-AGP found in plasma is a mixture of the products of these two different genes. This is the simpler explanation for the heterogeneity in the aminoacid composition in purified alpha 1-AGP observed by Schmid et al. (1). DNA sequence comparison with cDNA clones coding for human alpha 1-antitrypsin and haptoglobin shows a conserved sequence within the 5' untranslated region which may play a role in the acute phase response.
