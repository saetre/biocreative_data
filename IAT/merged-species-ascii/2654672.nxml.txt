Background
###end title 2
###begin p 3
The pathophysiology of obesity and type 2 diabetes mellitus is associated with abnormalities in endocrine signaling in adipose tissue and one of the key signaling affectors operative in these disorders is the nuclear hormone transcription factor peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma (PPARgamma). PPARgamma has pleiotropic functions affecting a wide range of fundamental biological processes including the regulation of genes that modulate insulin sensitivity, adipocyte differentiation, inflammation and atherosclerosis. To date, only a limited number of direct targets for PPARgamma have been identified through research using the well established pre-adipogenic cell line, 3T3-L1. In order to obtain a genome-wide view of PPARgamma binding sites, we applied the pair end-tagging technology (ChIP-PET) to map PPARgamma binding sites in 3T3-L1 preadipocyte cells.

Methodology/Principal Findings
###end title 4
###begin p 5
Coupling gene expression profile analysis with ChIP-PET, we identified in a genome-wide manner over 7700 DNA binding sites of the transcription factor PPARgamma and its heterodimeric partner RXR during the course of adipocyte differentiation. Our validation studies prove that the identified sites are bona fide binding sites for both PPARgamma and RXR and that they are functionally capable of driving PPARgamma specific transcription. Our results strongly indicate that PPARgamma is the predominant heterodimerization partner for RXR during late stages of adipocyte differentiation. Additionally, we find that PPARgamma/RXR association is enriched within the proximity of the 5' region of the transcription start site and this association is significantly associated with transcriptional up-regulation of genes involved in fatty acid and lipid metabolism confirming the role of PPARgamma as the master transcriptional regulator of adipogenesis. Evolutionary conservation analysis of these binding sites is greater when adjacent to up-regulated genes than down-regulated genes, suggesting the primordial function of PPARgamma/RXR is in the induction of genes. Our functional validations resulted in identifying novel PPARgamma direct targets that have not been previously reported to promote adipogenic differentiation.

The pathophysiology of obesity and type 2 diabetes mellitus is associated with abnormalities in endocrine signaling in adipose tissue and one of the key signaling affectors operative in these disorders is the nuclear hormone transcription factor peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma (PPARgamma) [1]-[4]. PPARgamma has pleiotropic functions affecting a wide range of fundamental biological processes including the regulation of genes that modulate insulin sensitivity, adipocyte differentiation, inflammation and atherosclerosis. Recent evidence has also implicated PPARgamma in cell cycle control and cancer progression [5]-[9]. PPARgamma is activated by several naturally occurring compounds, and synthetic molecules, such as thiazolidinediones, which are actively used in the therapy of type 2 diabetes [8], [10]-[12]. To date, only a limited number of direct targets for PPARgamma have been identified through research using the well established pre-adipogenic cell line, 3T3-L1.

Recently, in silico analysis of the human genome sequence has been carried out to identify direct target genes of PPARgamma [13]. In addition, a model for PPARgamma binding preferences using position weight matrices derived from all published Peroxisome Proliferator Response Elements (PPREs) has been reported [14]. Upon activation, PPARgamma heterodimerizes with the retinoid X receptor (RXR) and transcriptionally regulates target genes by binding to response elements (PPRE) consisting of a hexameric DNA core recognition motif spaced by one nucleotide (DR-1, PPREs; 5'-AGGTCANAGGTCA-3'), where PPARgamma occupies the 5'-half of the motif [15], [16]. However, in silico predictions poorly correlate with in vivo transcription factor binding, and as such, this approach has limited ability to predict bona fide PPARgamma binding.

To better define the transcriptional control functions of PPARgamma and its heterodimerization partner, RXR, during adipogenesis, we employed the paired-end ditag (PET) technology to characterize chromatin immunoprecipitated (ChIP)-enriched DNA fragments and mapped, in an unbiased manner, the binding sites of these nuclear hormone receptors (NHR) on a genome-wide scale. Previous work from our group has shown the utility of this approach in assessing transcription factor control mechanisms, and the potential advantages of sequenced based methodologies over hybridization approaches in mapping transcription factor binding sites [17]. Combining the ChIP-PET identification of PPARgamma and of RXR binding sites with PPARgamma dependent gene expression analysis of cells undergoing adipogenesis, we have comprehensively assessed their binding site usage and the regulatory mechanisms governing the transcriptional control of direct target genes. Our genomic scale data suggests that RXR is the major heterodimeric partner for PPARgamma during adipocyte differentiation and maturation. Additionally, we find that PPARgamma/RXR association is enriched within the proximity of the 5' region of the transcription start site and is significantly associated with transcriptional up-regulation of genes confirming the role of PPARgamma as the master transcriptional regulator of adipogenesis. Interestingly, we observed that during the early stages of adipocyte differentiation (fibroblasts to preadipocytes), the proportion of repressed genes were higher to those of genes that were induced. This relation was reversed after day 3, suggesting a concomitant with the switch from early to terminal adipocyte differentiation and marked by the induction of adipogenic maintenance genes.

We used the well established 3T3-L1 cell line as a model system for adipocyte differentiation. Following a protocol schematically outlined in Figure 1C, 3T3-L1 cells were differentiated into adipocytes 4 days post treatment with dexamethasone and IBMX, followed by insulin and rosiglitazone after two days. Differentiation was verified both by western blot for adipocyte specific markers and accumulation of lipids within the cells as detected by Oil-Red O staining. 3T3-L1 cell transfected with PPARgamma specific siRNA prior to differentiation completely abolished this process (Figures 1 A, B).

We followed gene expression changes during adipogenesis of 3T3-L1 cells treated with PPARgamma-specific siRNA (PPARgamma knock down (KD)) and those treated with control non-targeting siRNA using Illumina Sentrix BeadhipsRef-8. RNA was extracted at each timepoint (everyday). Analysis using all time-points (days -2 to 6) revealed that 1845 probes (correspond to about 1700 genes) were differentially expressed between PPARgamma KD and control siRNA (Spreadsheet S1). After hierarchical clustering, two distinct expression patterns were observed with approximately 40% down and 60% up-regulated in the PPARgamma KD. Henceforth, we will refer to genes down-regulated and up-regulated in the PPARgamma KD as induced and repressed by PPARgamma respectively. Analyzing the expression profile day 4-6 separately, however, provided us with 760 probes differentially expressed with the majority of genes induced by PPARgamma (Spreadsheet S2), 222 probes of which were not present in the set including all time-points. The global expression profile changed over the course of differentiation. During the early stages of adipocyte differentiation, the proportion of PPARgamma repressed genes (difference to control >1.5 fold) was higher than that of genes induced by PPARgamma (Figure S1 A). This relation was reversed at day 3, concomitant with the switch from early to terminal adipocyte differentiation and marked by the induction of adipogenic maintenance genes. Gene ontology analysis for the combined set (day (-2 to 6) and (4 to 6); 1656 genes with annotation) of differentially expressed genes using PANTHER [18], [19] showed an enrichment of genes involved in lipid, fatty acid and steroid metabolism, amino acid metabolism and generally genes with metabolic function. Only PPARgamma induced genes were significantly associated with metabolic processes while PPARgamma repressed genes were enriched in processes associated with development and cell division (Figure S1 B).

Having identified genes whose expression is PPARgamma dependent during adipogenesis, we aimed to further uncover genes directly regulated by PPARgamma through mapping PPARgamma binding sites on a genome-wide scale. As RXR has been shown to be a heterodimerization partner of PPARgamma [20], we also independently mapped RXR direct binding sites. We posited that the overlay of the RXR sites onto the PPARgamma sites could potentially improve the identification of functional PPARgamma binding sites. In addition, from our previous work, the digital count of ditags at binding loci is well correlated with the transcription factor occupancy. Thus, the combined analysis of PPARgamma and RXR binding ditag counts at close locations may be an indication of the importance of specific PPARgamma:RXR interactions during PPARgamma induced differentiation at a genome-wide level.

In order to identify binding sites, we collected chromatin immunopreciptation (ChIP) material from differentiated 3T3-L1 cells using PPARgamma and RXR specific antibodies. To maximize ChIP enrichment, the samples were harvested on day 6 post induction, when PPARgamma levels were found to be highest during the differentiation process (Figure 1A). PPARgamma and RXR bound DNA fragments were isolated from 3T3-L1 cells. Immunoprecipitated DNA fragments were sequenced using the pair-end-tagging approach and mapped to reference genome (mm8) [21], [22]. 3,211,429 of clone equivalents (ditags) were sequenced from the PPARgamma ChIP-PET library and 1,646,083 ditags were sequenced from the RXR library. Both libraries reached approximately 63-65% sequencing saturation (see saturation analysis in supplementary material, Figure S2).

Overlapping PET fragments were clustered as before [23], [24] to form ChIP-PET clusters. The resultant ChIP-PET clusters were then stratified based on the maximum number of overlapping fragments within each cluster. For example, a non-overlapping fragment is labeled as a moPET1 cluster, and as before, these are considered background/noise [21], while a moPET3 cluster is one where the maximum number of PET fragments overlapping at any location within the cluster is three. (moPETn+ clusters is the set of moPETi clusters, where i>/=n). Applying the adaptive thresholding method [25], 2953 PPARgamma ChIP-PET clusters and 5142 RXR ChIP-PET clusters were found to be statistically significant (FDR of </=0.01) and henceforth referred to as putative binding regions (Figure 2).

Similar to other nuclear hormone receptors such as the estrogen receptor, the majority (75-88%) of the bona fide binding regions of PPARgamma and RXR are within genes or within 100 kb of their 5' and 3'end; with the plurality being within the genes (39-43%) (Figure 3 A).

Such a coarse analysis, however, will not reveal potentially significantly but less frequent positional clustering of binding sites. To address this possibility, we assessed whether PPARgamma or RXR would bind at a frequency greater than chance vis-a-vis specific gene boundaries such as the transcriptional start site (TSS). We found that the proportion of binding sites of either NHR within 5 kb of the TSS was significantly higher than downstream of a gene. When we mapped the frequency contours for PPARgamma and RXR binding within 100 kbp 5' and 3' of TSS, we found a distinct enrichment within approximately 5-10 kb of the TSS (Figure 3B). No such bias was observed when the 3' prime end of genes was assessed.

The heterodimerization between PPARgamma and RXR has been previously determined on a small number of individual binding sites and is thought to be the exclusive biochemical configuration for transcriptional activation by PPARgamma [26], [27]. Our data allowed us to examine this issue at a genome-wide scale. Taking the middle of ChIP-PET overlap region (i.e., a PET cluster) as the proxy for actual binding site locations, as in [28], we plotted the ratio of the observed distance distribution between binding sites of PPARgamma and RXR (Figure 3C) and what would be expected in case of random binding. We observed a significant co-localization of PPARgamma and RXR binding sites within distances of 500 bp or less. A Monte-Carlo assessment further confirmed that the enrichment of paired PPARgamma/RXR binding sites is significant at FDR<0.05 when these bona fide individual binding sites are separated by <300 bp (Figure 3C). We call these PPARgamma/RXR site-pairs identified by our ChIP-PET sequencing as ChIP-PET heterosites, as they are the likely DNA interaction sites of putative PPARgamma:RXR heterodimers (Henceforth, we would also use the term monosites to refer to binding sites of PPARgamma (or RXR) where no RXR (or PPARgamma) present within the specified distance).The interval size is most likely determined by the number of fragments constituting a cluster and the initial shear size of the DNA fragments. As such, we considered a maximum interval of 200 bp in identifying heterosites. Individual NHR binding sites without another binding cluster within 200 bp are called monosites. Validations of these PPARgamma and RXR binding at the monosites and heterosites by ChIP-qPCR (Figure 4) found that heterosites had a significantly greater degree of occupancy than the monosites. Furthermore, this degree of occupancy for any individual site was not observed in undifferentiated cells (fibroblasts), where RXR is abundantly expressed but PPARgamma is not (Figure S3). We then took 157 ChIP-PET determined mono- and heterosites and subjected them to ChIP-q-PCR validation for binding of PPARgamma and RXR (Figure 4). The results of this validation first showed that on average, the moPET counts correlated with the qPCR outcomes: the higher the moPET, the greater the fold enrichment by qPCR. The second observation is that almost all of the monosites as determined by ChIP-PET for PPARgamma were also bound by RXR in qPCR validation. The reverse was also true in that almost all ChIP-PET based monosites for RXR also bound PPARgamma by qPCR. This is supported by the fold enrichment levels of PPARgamma or RXR at any binding site that exceeded the adaptive threshold cutoff. Regardless of whether monosites or heterosites are used, both NHR bound with the same relative degree to each binding site (Table S4).What discrepancies were attributable to a small number of low order binding sites of approximately 1.5-2 fold enrichment where occupancy of the heterodimer partner could not be detected. Given that each of the ChIP-PET sequencing runs were only 63-65% saturated (Figure S2), we believe that the heterosite calls missed by ChIP-PET is a function of sampling error of sites with weaker NHR occupancy. Highly enriched sites are most likely present in both libraries and sites with lower enrichment are more likely to be present in only one of the libraries. Supporting this, we found that the ChIP-PET monosites had a lower level of enrichment for PPARgamma and RXR as compared to the ChIP-PET heterosites upon ChIP-qPCR validation (3.5-5.4 average fold enrichment for the monosites vs. 14.4-16.1 average fold enrichment for the strong heterosites;Wilcoxon's one-tailed test p<1E-4 in all cases) (Table S4). The combination of our genome-wide ChIP-PET data and the ChIP qPCR validation therefore suggest that PPARgamma and RXR interact on the same DNA binding sites throughout the genome though of differing intensities. This is consistent with the biochemical evidence that PPARgamma and RXR act together as a heterodimer in PPARgamma action. Our work extends this observation on a genome wide scale. Combining both the PPARgamma and RXR sites we identified a total of 7821 binding sites throughout the genome (PPARgamma/RXR heterosites are counted as one) (Figure 2 and Spreadsheets S3, S4 and S5).

ChIP Q-PCR was used for validation of binding sites. 4 populations of binding sites were chosen for validation: PPARgamma monosites (no RXR sites within 200 bp), RXR monosites (no PPARgamma sites within 200 bp), low confidence PPARgammamoPET2:RXR heterosites (within 200 bp) and high confidence PPARgamma:RXR heterosites (within 200 bp). High confidence PPARgamma:RXR heterosites shows, on average, higher ChIP-qPCR enrichment than PPARgamma or RXR monosites and PPARgammamoPET2:RXR heterosites. Shown is the enrichment over an unspecific antibody control. Each data point represents mean value of 3 biological replicates, with error bars indicating the standard deviation.

These sites therefore represent a substantial part of the genome-wide pool of PPARgamma /RXR binding sites operative during adipogenesis. Based on the validation rate we conclude that sites with higher occupancy are more likely to be present in this pool.

Advancing a major aim of this study of identifying direct PPARgamma/RXR target genes, we sought to further combine PPARgamma dependent expression profiles with the genome-wide PPARgamma:RXR binding site data. We extracted 278 probes on the Illumina expression array which had PPARgammamoPET2+/RXR ChIP-PET heterosite(s) within 5 kb of the TSS, and 424 and 1494 probes had respectively a PPARgamma or RXR site within 5 kb of their TSS (Spreadsheets S3, S4 and S5). Based on our earlier analysis, the ChIP-PET determined monosites would collectively represent sites with a lower level of occupancy by the heterodimer than the ChIP-PET heterosites. Of the 278 probes in proximity to a heterosite, more than 31% (88) were regulated by PPARgamma activation (P = 1.91E-38). This compares to 14% (54) in proximity to PPARgamma ChIP-PET monosites (P = 2.57E-07), 13% (192) for RXR ChIP-PET monosites (P = 2.61E-16), and 9% for all probes on the expression array (i.e., background). More specifically, probes induced by PPARgamma are more commonly associated with RXR/PPARgamma binding sites in proximity of the TSS, whereas there is no association seen with genes repressed by RXR/PPARgamma activation (Table 1). Thus, proximity of a binding site with a high level of heterodimer occupancy to a TSS significantly increases the likelihood that an adjacent gene will be up-regulated by PPARgamma activation.

In an attempt to improve the identification of true target genes and making use of true PPARgamma sites that went undetected (false-negatives), we reasoned that RXR ChIP-PET monosites supported by lower confidence PPARgamma binding (as defined by moPET threshold of >/=2) would also identify good PPARgamma:RXR overlap binding sites. Using the RXR monosites to catch PPARgamma sites that were not called using the adaptive thresholding methods (false negatives) (Figure S10). Indeed, qPCR validation of RXR monosites that were also identified by a lower threshold moPET2 PPARgamma site gave us approximately91% success rate for co-occupancy (Figure 4S7, S8 and Table S4).

To examine this more closely, we collapsed the array probe sets onto genes and classified a gene as target if it is both regulated during adipogenesis and has at least one binding site (PPARgamma and RXR) within 5 kb of the gene's TSS. Since it is highly possible that binding sites farther away from the TSS may also regular its proximate gene, these criteria are likely to be more stringent. We identified 75 high confidence target genes as defined by association with heterosites and 180 lower confidence targets defined by association with monosites (Table S2). Further, we assessed their expression dynamics after PPARgamma activation (Figure 5). Our analysis revealed that high confidence targets were induced at significantly higher levels than lower confidence target genes. Genes induced by PPARgamma are more commonly associated with RXR/PPARgamma binding sites in proximity of the TSS (P = 2.57E-07 to P = 1.91E-38) (Table 1). No significant association is seen with genes repressed by PPARgamma activation.

To confirm that the PPARgamma binding sites identified by ChIP-PET can regulate gene expression, we tested the ability of 6 putative PPARgamma DNA binding regions to mediate activation by PPARgamma directly with reporter constructs (Figures 6C and S6). These binding regions were selected based on ChIP q-PCR validation and proximity to the TSS (Figure 6 A, B). Enrichment of these binding regions by ChIP q-PCR was only observed in adipocytes when compared with fibroblast (Figure S3). The PPARgamma binding regions were cloned into a PGL3 vector with a TATA box [23]. PPARgamma binding region from the known target gene PLIN served as a positive control and the empty vector (TATA alone) as the negative control. Reporter constructs were transfected into 3T3-L1 fibroblasts without induction of endogenous PPARgamma expression either alone or together with a PPARgamma expression plasmid. 24 hrs after transfection, cells were stimulated with 1 uM rosiglitazone or vehicle. Luciferase activity was measure 24 h after stimulation. Four out of the six binding sites tested showed substantial luciferase activity in PPARgamma transfected cells over empty vector transfected cells. The two remaining sites tested showed only modest increase in luciferase activity. Further increase in luciferase activity was observed in cells treated with rosiglitazone. We have previously shown that the center of a PET cluster represents the precise position of transcription factor binding site in vivo [23]. By mutating an element which closely resembled the PPARgamma/RXR binding consensus motif in one of the binding regions adjacent to the pim3 and Sncg genes (Table S5 and Figure S6), respectively, the reporter gene activation by PPARgamma was markedly decreased. This suggests that the binding sites tested can directly induce transcription in a ligand inducible manner and that this induction is likely to be dependent on the specific PPARgamma/RXR binding.

Putative PPARgamma/RXR binding regions in proximity to Plin, PCX, Mgst1, Gpd1, Cops7b, Sncg and Pim3 were cloned into TATA box containing pGL3 reporter construct. Reporter constructs were co-transfected with PPARgamma expression vector or empty vector as control. Putative PPRE in binding region adjacent to Pim3 and SNCG were mutated to confirm functionality. Samples were treated with 1 uM Rosiglitazone or DMSO for 24 h prior to quantization. Luciferase activity was measured and normalized to renilla. Mutation of putative PPARgamma/RXR binding motif within the binding region abrogates PPARgamma dependent activation of the luciferase reporter construct. Shown is the average of two biological replicates each run in triplicates; with the standard deviations indicated as error bars.

Applying de-novo motif discovery algorithm, Weeder [29] on the heterosites and further refining the results, akin to what was done in [28], we were able to uncover a weight matrix (A/GGGNCAAAGGTCA) similar to the known weight matrix of PPRE {(A/G)GGTCAAAGGTCA}, a direct hexad repeat that represents PPARgamma:RXR joint binding motif. However, the conspicuous absence of the consensus T in the calculated left repeat and the attenuation of the signal from the T from the right repeat from our genome wide data suggest that the earlier derived consensus may have been a special case. Using the RXR monosites we found a similar structure with two direct repeats, but the T is absent in both sites (AGGGCAAA GGGCA).The PPARgamma monosites, however, showed only a signal for a half-site that, though more degenerate, resembles the AGGGCA motif (Figures S4 and S9). In an alternative analysis, we screened the center of the PPARgamma and RXR monosites and PPARgammamoPET2+/RXR binding regions for the frequency of occurrence of a reported PPARgamma/RXR binding motif using previously described PWMs [15], [30], [31]. All categories showed significant enrichment of motif occurrence compared to background genomic regions (Table S3). Comparing consensus motif occurrence in binding regions adjacent to genes down-regulated and up-regulated by PPARgamma, we found that repressed genes were less significantly associated with a motif as compared to induced genes (Table S3). Our results show that motif occurrence, like binding site distribution itself, appears to be strongly biased towards regulated genes, more specifically towards genes induced by PPARgamma.

Conservation of short sequence sites can be assessed using different metrics. In this study, we examined whether the sequences around the different categories of murine PPARgamma and/or RXR binding sites would be conserved in the human. 200 bp interval around the binding sites was chosen to evaluate association with conserved elements (100 bp up- and downstream of the middle of the binding region). We observed that between 29-33% of the PPARgamma/RXR heterosites and RXR monosites were conserved between mouse and human whereas PPARgamma sites showed little diference from background in terms of conservation (20% and 19% respectively). This low sequence conservation at the binding sites is consistent with our experience with the majority of transcription factors. When we examined the conservation of binding sites within 5 kb of the TSS of PPARgamma regulated vs. non-regulated genes, we found a significant enrichment of conserved heterosites with upregulated genes (65% upregulated vs. 42% down regulated, Figure S5). There was no such enrichment with RXR or PPARgamma monosites or with RXRPET1 sites which represent background. However, RXR monosites and heterosites of lower quality showed increased association with conserved elements as compared to both RXR and PPARgamma:PET1 clusters. This suggests that a conserved function of PPARgamma action is the induction of a number of specific downstream genes.

Assuming that direct PPARgamma/RXR targets are responsible for a large part of the observed biological effects of PPARgamma, we characterized these targets using PANTHER. As before, we considered genes with at least one heterosite or monosite within 5 kb of their TSS a potential target gene. This restrictive classification will leave out a considerable number of true target genes containing a binding site further away than 5 kb, however it will prevent the "dilution" of the true effectors of PPARgamma by including a large number of false-positive targets. When all PPARgamma and RXR binding sites are taken into consideration, the top functional category that is overrepresented is lipid, fatty acid and steroid metabolism (P = 6.61E-08) followed by nucleic acid metabolism (P = 1.95E-06) and cell proliferation and differentiation (P = 7.02E-05) (Tables S1, S6, S7 and S8). When only the high quality heterosites were considered, lipid, fatty acid and steroid metabolism again was the top category, followed by apoptosis, and then fatty acid metabolism. Gratifyingly, when compared to the ontology of genes regulated by PPARgamma as assessed by expression arrays (Figure S1B), the top intersects were lipid, fatty acid and steroid metabolism and fatty acid metabolism. Thus by two different approaches, one based on expression, and the second solely on binding site association, PPARgamma primarily regulates a transcriptional cassette that is involved in lipid and fatty acid metabolism.

To assess the function of selected direct PPARgamma targets during adipogenesis, we carried out gene knockdown experiments using siRNA in 3T3-L1 cells. Adipogenic potential of the selected target genes was evaluated by quantifying the reduction of lipid accumulation in differentiated adipocytes in the absence of the respective gene. Evaluated genes were selected from the high confidence target genes defined by a transcriptional unit with heterosites within 5 kb of their TSS and showing differential expression pattern during adipogenesis. After Oil Red O staining, lipid accumulation in cells was measured using a spectrometer set at 540 nm. Level of lipid accumulation inhibition ascribed to PPARgamma KD was used as the positive control (40% reduction compared with untreated adipocytes). A knockdown was considered affecting lipid accumulation if it did not produce significantly higher lipid accumulation (one-tailed t-test p>0.02) than that of PPARgamma KD. The level of lipid accumulation of untransfected cells undergoing adipogenesis after chemical stimulation was taken arbitrarily to exhibit 100% adipogenesis. Whereas non-targeting siRNA had no effect on the adipogenic phenotype, 6 of the 20 (30%) tested siRNAs showed a reduction of lipid accumulation similar to that of PPARgamma knockdown. The knockdowns that were biologically effective were Pim3, Mnk2, Agt, Fsp27, Smaf1(adipogenin) and Pdzrn3, while other targets showed no or very modest levels of inhibition of lipid accumulation (Figure 7). These affects on lipogenesis are not due to non specific cellular toxicity (data not shown).

Undifferentiated 3T3-L1 cells were transfected with siRNAs that targeted genes that were selected on the basis of ChIP-PET binding for both PPARgamma and RXR, and expression data. Transfected cells were brought to confluence and then treated with IBMX/DEX for 48 hrs, and then stimulated with insulin and rosiglitazone. Cells were stained after 4 days of treatment using Oil Red O stain, and quantified for lipid accumulation using a spectrophometer set at an absorbance of 540 nM. Percentage of adipogenesis, as measured by Oil Red O staining, was compared for each siRNA target to that of the non-transfected differentiated cells (set at 100% adipogenesis). Non-targeting siRNA served as a control, while siRNA targeting PPARgamma served as a threshold for adipogenesis inhibition. A gene target was considered affecting lipid accumulation if it did not produce significantly higher lipid accumulation (one-tailed t-test p>0.2) than that of the PPARgamma KD. Starred bars represent genes that meet the criteria. Confluent fibroblasts, as well as differentiated 3T3-L1 cells, that were not transfected with siRNA also served as controls to compare the effects of non-targeting siRNA on adipocyte differentiation. Results indicate two biological replicates, each of which was transfected with siRNA to a final concentration of 50 nM.

That PPARgamma with its heterodimerization partner, RXR, are key regulators of adipogenesis [20], [32]-[34]. Herein, we sought to detail the transcriptional regulatory configuration of PPARgamma-RXR-DNA interaction on a genome-wide scale using an established ChIP-PET sequencing approach. Such genome-wide analysis of bona fide NHR binding sites provides sufficient numbers to achieve statistical power to uncover core characteristics of specific transcription factor-DNA interaction by examining the population characteristics of the DNA binding sites in a genome-wide scale. By comprehensively assessing the binding profiles of each heterodimer partner separately and then mapping their intersects, we were able to assess the functional importance of the heterodimer in PPARgamma signaling and function.

The observation of consistent PPARgamma/RXR interaction at almost all high quality RXR binding sites was unexpected since such exclusive interaction would not be expected given the promiscuous nature of RXR as a heterodimerization partner [35]. In seeking an explanation for these findings, we constructed potential mechanistic models based on the composite configuration of the "population" of binding sites. This approach was used to uncover the cooperation between Oct4 and Sox2 in regulating genes involved in stem cell biology. The Oct4 and Nanog transcription network regulates pluripotency in mouse embryonic stem cells. [28]. Based on our data, we posit that true monosites are fundamentally very weak binders and account for a small proportion of the binding sequences. This is especially true for PPARgamma where there were a significantly greater proportion of weak occupancy sites (as measured by the ratio low/high confidence sites) than with RXR (PPARgamma = 62783/2953 = 21.3 vs. RXR =  33882/5142 = 6.6).We also observed that experimental heterosites are associated with consistently higher NHR occupancy and more likely associated with genes induced by PPARgamma. One plausible model is that our ChIP-PET experiments were performed at day 4 post induction, where PPARgamma levels are the highest and in the presence of the potent PPARgamma agonist rosiglitazone, thus represents a cellular milieu that favors the full utilization of the PPARgamma/RXR heterodimers in adipocyte differentiation. We surmise that, under these conditions, the excess PPARgamma could titer out the limited pool of RXR molecules from its other heterodimeric partners during the course of adipogenesis. Consistent with this observation is that despite similar levels of RXR in undifferentiated 3T3L1 cells, the binding of RXR to high confidence sites was uniformly lower than that seen after adipogenic induction when PPARgamma expression is dramatically induced (Figure S3). This suggests that the efficiency of RXR binding at PPARgamma sites is augmented in the presence of its heterodimerization partner. Though this mechanism has been suggested in studies involving individual binding sites, our genome-wide analysis suggests that the PPARgamma/RXR heterodimer is a general requirement for optimal DNA binding throughout the genome.
###end p 58
###begin p 59
In addition, our data suggest asymmetric requirements for PPARgamma and RXR in this heterodimerization process. RXR appeared to have an almost 4 fold higher ratio of high quality to lower confidence occupancy sites than PPARgamma. Moreover, de novo motif analysis showed RXR binding sites gave a robust direct repeat that resembled the canonical PPRE whereas the PPARgamma motif appeared more degenerate.
###end p 59
###begin p 60
Our global results have revealed other general characteristics of PPARgamma/RXR binding as it relates to downstream function. First, that proximity of a binding site to the TSS along with the level of occupancy of the heterodimer predicts for association with regulated genes, and in particular upregulated genes. We have observed this with other transcription factors such as ERalpha, Myc, and p53 in that proximity to the TSS (up to 50 kb) is statistically associated with upregulated genes. Downregulated genes do not have this position association with binding sites of their cognate transcription factors. When coupled with the observation that the evolutionary conservation of PPARgamma/RXR binding sites is greater when adjacent to upregulated genes than downregulated genes suggest that the primordial function of PPARgamma/RXR is the induction of genes involved in lipid and fatty acid metabolism.

Extending the functional importance of PPARgamma/RXR transcriptional regulation to adipogenesis, our assessment of the ontologic classification of the genes in proximity to PPARgamma/RXR heterosites shows significant enrichment for three major classes. The most enriched are genes involved in lipid, fatty acid, and steroid metabolism, and then genes involved in apoptosis. In a broader analysis of all PPARgamma and RXR binding sites, lipid, fatty acid, and steroid metabolism cluster remains the most enriched, with other metabolic processes following. This suggests a transcriptional network with PPARgamma/RXR at its core mediating an appropriate transcriptional response to changing ligand (i.e. fatty acids) concentration by fine tuning the levels of enzymes involved in metabolic processes associated with fatty acid and lipid metabolism. A comparison of the functional classification of downstream targets of different transcription regulators is also informative. The function of downstream targets of transcription factors such as ERalpha, Oct4-Nanog, p53 and RELA [21], [23], [28], [36] include a significant number of other transcription factors suggesting a "cascade" effect on transcription as a result of the induction of a series of other transcriptional regulators. By contrast, however, transcription factors are not overrepresented among direct PPARgamma targets. While this is not ruling out any crucial function for TFs in the process of adipogenesis downstream of PPARgamma as was shown for C/EBPa and Stat5a, the enrichment of enzymes involved in metabolic processes is very significant.

Only a limited number of genes are known to date to be direct targets of PPARgamma, with the majority being involved in lipid metabolism [27]. In this study we extended this number to about 250 putative target genes (Spreadsheets S3 and S6). On the assumption that these direct target genes may have a central role in the adipogenic action of PPARgamma/RXR activation, we examined the biological significance of a number of direct target genes identified in our study in the adipocyte differentiation process. We hypothesized that by suppressing these direct targets of PPARgamma using siRNAs targeted against them, we would be able to inhibit adipogenesis, hence justifying the importance of these direct targets in the PPARgamma adipogenic cascade. Indeed, of the 20 putative direct targets genes assessed using siRNA approaches, we found that 6 or 30% showed inhibition of adipocyte differentiation of 3T3-L1 cells when expression was attenuated using gene specific siRNAs. Using this approach, we have demonstrated that selective inhibition of PPARgamma direct targets do in fact play a crucial role in the PPARgamma adipogenic cascade, even in the presence of endogenous PPARgamma. These putative targets include genes previously associated with obesity, while others have not been well characterized. Pim3, which we demonstrate here as being a direct target of PPARgamma is a serine threonine kinase that is evolutionarily highly conserved. Mice lacking expression of Pim1, Pim2, and Pim3 although viable and fertile show profound reduction in body size at birth and throughout postnatal life [37]. Although the contribution of Pim3 in mammalian development needs further investigation, its role as an oncogene is well documented. Aberrant Pim3 expression in cancer cells mediates its anti-apoptotic effects by phosphorylating Bad [38], [39]. This is potentially significant, since PPARgamma is also highly expressed in many cancers [40] and therefore may play a role in inhibiting apoptosis via Pim3 expression. Additionally we have identified novel PPARgamma direct targets that have previously been demonstrated to promote lipid accumulation, regulate lipolysis and promote triglyceride accumulation. These include FSP27/Cidec, which has previously been reported to be regulated by C/EBP and other C/EBP-like proteins and functions in regulating adipocyte metabolism and enhancing triglyceride storage. FSP27 is expressed at high levels in brown adipose tissue (BAT), liver and white adipose tissue (WAT), and its expression is enhanced during adipogenesis in primary rodent and human preadipocytes. In addition, insulin exposure enhanced FSP27 transcript levels [41], [42]. Recent evidence suggests FSP27 regulates lipid accumulation and triacylglycerol storage by binding to lipid droplets and regulating their enlargement [42], [43]. Adipogenin (SMAF1, BC054059), another direct PPARgamma target, stimulates adipocyte differentiation and development and is exclusively expressed in adipocytes isolated from primary adipose tissues [44]. Recent evidence suggests transmembrane proteins play a vital role in the development of adipose tissue and obesity. The expression of adiponutrin, a transmembrane protein, is regulated in human adipose tissue by the level of energy balance in the body [45]. Adipogenin may function in a similar manner by regulating levels of lipid stores during adipogenesis. We have shown that the downregulation of angiotensinogen (Agt) inhibits adipogenesis in 3T3-L1 cells. AGT is secreted by WAT, is induced during adipogenic conversion, and may contribute to the elevation of blood pressure and several cardiovascular risk factors in obese patients [46], [47]. Lipid accumulation and adipocyte differentiation is severely impaired when angiotensinogen levels are reduced. Though the role of angiotensinogen in the differentiation of adipoblasts has not been elucidated, angiotensinogen signaling has been linked to leptin/leptin receptor signaling, insulin receptor signaling and the metabolism of complex and glycerolipids, via serpine1 [48]. GPRK7 (Mnk2), which phosphorylates eukaryotic initiation factor 4E and which we show here as being a direct target, also inhibits adipogeneis. The role of G-protein coupled receptors in adipocyte biology is unclear. Of the numerous GPR expressed, GPR120 and 43 has been linked with a possible physiological role in adipose tissue development and adipocyte differentiation. The levels of both receptors are highly expressed in adipose tissues of mice fed on a high fat diet, and siRNA targeting these receptors inhibited adipocyte differentiation [44], [49]. In addition to the gene targets that were transcriptional upregulated by the PPARgamma/RXR heterodimer, we also investigated whether KD of target genes that were transcriptionally downregulated by the heterodimer could enhance adipogenesis. For this, we targeted PDZRN3, which contained a heterosite within its promoter and was downregulated by PPARgamma during the course of adipogenesis. PDZRN3 is a PDZ domain containing RING finger 3 (PDZRN3) that potentially has E3 ubiquitin ligase activity. Previous studies have shown that PDZRN3 is expressed in the heart, skeletal muscle and liver. Up-regulation of PDZRN3 during differentiation of myoblasts into myotubes, and injury induced muscle regeneration has been described [50].

Although PDZRN3 has a role in myoblasts differentiation, we observe a paradoxical finding during adipocyte differentiation. We postulated that KD of PDZRN3 could enhance adipogenesis. Our siRNA screen for PDZRN3 resulted in a decrease in adipogenesis. This observation suggests a complex role for PDZRN3 in adipocyte differentiation which will require further study. The remaining direct targets of PPARgamma/RXR that were tested showed no changes in lipid accumulation when targeted by their respective siRNAs. These targets may not contribute directly to the accumulation of lipids during the adipogenic process, but may play a role in other metabolic processes or may play a redundant role during adipocyte lipid accumulation and differentiation. Of the interesting targets that showed no phenotypic changes include, Mgst1 (MAPEG, Membrane Associated Proteins in Eicosanoid and Glutathione metabolism family member) that may be involved in inflammation and cellular defense and ECH1 (enoyl Coenzyme A hydratase 1) which is involved in fatty acid beta-oxidation [51]. The rest of the targets that were screened have not previously been reported to play a role in metabolic processes related to obesity. Our study provides a comprehensive source of PPARgamma direct targets to the scientific community studying adipogenesis to further investigate the importance of this cascade sequence.

Taken together, our genome-wide analysis of the comprehensive DNA interaction of PPARgamma and its heterodimerization partner, RXR provides an enhanced understanding of global functions of this NHR pair. Such a "population" approach helps resolve the core actions by filtering the evolutionary noise inherent in short motif recognition systems. Our observations suggest several models for PPARgamma/RXR function that can now be tested using the comprehensive binding database that we are providing.

ChIP was performed as previously described [23] using antibodies for RXR and PPARgamma (Santa Cruz, CA, USA). The ChIP-PET analysis was performed as previously described [21] using the UCSC mm8 genome as the reference genome. The locations of the ChIP-enriched DNA present in the two libraries were visualized using our in-house genome browser (T2G browser) which was implemented in the context of the University of California, Santa Cruz (UCSC) genome browser. ChIP-PET fragments overlapping by at least 1 basepair were iteratively clustered. Binding regions of PPARgamma and RXR were identified from the set of all ChIP-PET clusters using adaptive thresholding method similar to [25]. In brief: the adaptive threshold method is based on a Monte-Carlo simulation. Significance for a binding site was determined by computing the probability of a peak with a certain size being observed in the library occurring by random chance, given the total number of peaks in a defined interval. The cut-off is therefore not fixed to a certain moPET number, for the entire library, but changes depending on the background in any given region.

ChIP-PET clusters that did not meet the adaptive thresholding criteria but were at least of moPET2 and above are considered low confidence sites.

To assess the sampling adequacy of our libraries, we carried sequencing saturation analyses on both the PPARgamma and RXR ChIP-PET libraries. A total of 3,211,429 and 1,646,083 PET reads were generated for the PPARgamma and RXR libraries respectively, which identified around 549,000 unique ChIP fragment locations for PPARgamma library and around 348,000 unique ChIP fragment locations for RXR library. Using the chronological information available from the sequencing pipeline coupled with Monte Carlo simulations and similar to what was done in [21]. We fitted a Hill Function to each empirical sequencing saturation curve to estimate the asymptotic identifiable unique locations. The saturation level was computed by taking the ratio of identified unique locations over the total identifiable unique locations. A saturation level of approximately63% and approximately65% were reached for PPARgamma and RXR libraries respectively. The saturation curves are shown in Figure S2.

Genomic proximity between distinct elements can be used as a good proxy for functional interplays between the elements. We were interested to ascertain: (i) whether the identified PPARgamma and RXR binding sites are preferentially concentrated around Transcription Start Sites (which suggests direct gene regulatory role), and (ii) whether the reported cooperation of PPARgamma and RXR is evident at the genome scale. For the first task, we compiled the distances of all sites to all TSS (based on UCSC knownGene database) within 100 kbp away and grouped them into 5 kbp bins. As a control, the same amount of sites was randomly distributed in the genome and their distances to all TSS were similarly compiled and binned. Plotted in Figure 3B is the ratio, for each distance bin, of the binding site density from the actual data to that of the randomly distributed control.

The binding site predictions are based on a position weight matrix algorithm and to compute the statistical significance, we generated a background sequence set of 10,000 randomly selected 500 bp sequences, roughly matching the 9002 binding sites identified in the PPARgamma and RXR ChIP-PET experiments. The analyzed ChIP-PET cluster sequences were 500 bp long, and defined using the center of the PET cluster as the middle of the cluster and then expanding 250 bp on each side.

Luciferase assays showing PPARgamma dependent activation of luc reporter in 3T3-L1 fibroblasts. Putative PPARgamma/RXR binding regions in proximity to Plin, PCX, Mgst1,Gpd1, Cops7b, Sncg and Pim3 were cloned into TATA box containing pGL3 reporter construct. Reporter constructs were co-transfected with PPARgamma expression vector or empty vector as control. Putative PPRE in binding region adjacent to Pim3 and SNCG were mutated to confirm functionality (primers used in PCR amplification and cloning are listed in Table S5, together with their genomic locations). Samples were treated with 1 uM Rosiglitazone or DMSO for 24 h prior to quantization. Luciferase activity was measured and normalized to Renilla and cells transfected with minimal TATA luciferase construct. Mutation of putative PPARgamma/RXR binding motif within the binding region abrogates PPARgamma dependent activation of the luciferase reporter construct (mutations sites are highlighted in red). Shown is the average of two biological replicates each run in triplicates; with the standard deviations indicated as error bars. Asterix denotes p-values<0.05 (Student T-test, two tailed distribution).

Distance between middle of PPARgamma and RXR moPET clusters and heterosites correlates with Chip enrichment and PET count. Enrichment in qPCR as well as moPET count for both PPARgamma and RXR for heterosites is negatively correlated with the distance between the two binding partners. This is a qualitative statement to illustrate the characteristics of the heterosites. It suggests however that the observed distance between the peaks of the two binding sites decreases as the enrichement (occupancy) gets better. Essentially, the better the resolution at the individual binding site the better the overlap. Ideally the peak of two binding sites should overlap.

Binding sites close to regulated genes show a higher degree of motif occurrence. We scanned PPARgamma, RXR binding regions and PPARgamma/RXR binding regions (1 kb with the middle of the moPET region in the centre) for the occurrence of a published PPARgamma consensus motif (AGGTCAAAAGGTCA) while allowing for up to 3 mismatches. Ideally the motif is to be expected to be located at the center of the cluster overlap (i.e. at the middle of the peak). However, depending on the cluster size the resolution might decrease. In addition, not all sites contain a motif or the motif is degenerated. When plotting the motif occurrence over the 1 kb window as density function, we found that RXR binding sites as well as PPARgamma/RXR binding regions showed a marked peak in motif density around the centre of the binding regions. PPARgamma binding regions showed a motif enrichment around the centre of the binding region as well, however this enrichment appeared to be somewhat weaker. When considering binding regions closer to genes all binding regions showed further increase in motif occurrence with the maximum for binding sites within 5 kb of regulated genes.

RXR binding sites are used to improve grading of PPARgamma binding sites and reduce false negative rate in PPARgamma data. Schematic illustration of our approach to consider PPARgammaPET2+/RXR heterosites as high confidence sites: RXR is used as quality binding site to 'fish' for a PPARgamma site within close proximity that was not detected using the adaptive threshold method. This helps to utilize the PPARgamma PET2+ cluster and hence reduces the false negative rate. We used these sites to identify direct targets.

Biological process analysis of direct PPARgamma target genes. Results of biological process analysis for direct PPARgamma target genes using PANTHER []. Genes were considered putative direct targets if at least one binding site from any category (heterosites, PPARgamma monosites, RXR monosites) was found within 5 kb of their TSS. TSS coordinates were extracted from UCSC database KnownGenes. Statistical significance was computed by comparing the number of genes in each category to expected number derived from the total number of genes in each process using NCBI mus musculus Ref Seq as reference. P-values were Bonferroni corrected for multiple hypotheses testing. Genes were categorized as repressed or induced according to their average fold change throughout the time course.
