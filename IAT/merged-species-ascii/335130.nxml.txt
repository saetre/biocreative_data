Type IIB intracisternal A-particle (IAP) elements have undergone marked amplification and transposition in the genomic DNA of some mouse myelomas. We have made a cDNA library from one such myeloma, MOPC 315, to determine whether some property of the elements themselves has a role in this process. Sequencing of several type IIB cDNAs and one genomic type IIB IAP element has shown that they are nearly identical (greater than 99%) and contain 2 open reading frames (ORFs). ORF2 is capable of encoding the IAP integrase, an enzyme which catalyzes integration of proviral DNA into the genome. An antiserum to a synthetic peptide based on the IAP integrase gene sequence reacted with ORF2 product expressed in bacteria as a fusion protein, and detected a 47 kDa protein, predicted from the size of ORF2, in myeloma cell fractions by Western blotting.
