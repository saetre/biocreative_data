PSP is the most abundant translation product of mouse parotid glands where its production is co-ordinated with that of salivary amylase. The synthesis of these two proteins apparently is restricted to this tissue. In order to enable us to study common regulatory elements in the genes of the two proteins, double stranded cDNA, synthesized for parotid gland poly (A)+ RNA, was cloned. DNA sequencing of three clones complementary to the most abundant messenger indicated overlap and resulted in a total sequence of 867 nucleotides. Translation of this sequence revealed that at one end the amino acid sequence was the same as the N-terminal sequence of PSP. The sequence contains 60 nucleotides coding for part of or the complete signal peptide, 645 nucleotides coding for the PSP protein, and 162 nucleotides that apparently are not translated. Southern blot analysis suggests a simple structure for the PSP gene in mouse and man.
