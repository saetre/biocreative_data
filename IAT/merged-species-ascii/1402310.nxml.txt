###begin p 3
Hypoxia-inducible transcription factor-1alpha (HIF-1alpha), which plays an important role in controlling the hypoxia-induced glycolysis pathway, is a "master" gene in the tissue hypoxia response during tumor development. However, its role in the apoptosis of non-small cell lung cancer remains unknown. Here, we have studied the effects of HIF-1alpha on apoptosis by modulating HIF-1alpha gene expression in A549 cells through both siRNA knock-down and over-expression.

Methods

###begin p 5
A549 cells were transfected with a HIF-1alpha siRNA plasmid or a HIF-1alpha expression vector. Transfected cells were exposed to a normoxic or hypoxic environment in the presence or absence of 25 mM HEPES and 2-deoxyglucose (2-DG) (5 mM). The expression of three key genes of the glycolysis pathway, glucose transporter type 1(GLUT1), phosphoglycerate kinase 1(PGK1), and hexokinase 1(HK1), were measured using real-time RT-PCR. Glycolysis was monitored by measuring changes of pH and lactate concentration in the culture medium. Apoptosis was detected by TUNEL assay and flow cytometry.

Knocking down expression of HIF-1alpha inhibited the glycolysis pathway, increased the pH of the culture medium, and protected the cells from hypoxia-induced apoptosis. In contrast, over-expression of HIF-1alpha accelerated glycolysis in A549 cells, decreased the pH of the culture medium, and enhanced hypoxia-induced apoptosis. These effects of HIF-1alpha on glycolysis, pH of the medium, and apoptosis were reversed by treatment with the glycolytic inhibitor, 2-DG. Apoptosis induced by HIF-1alpha over-expression was partially inhibited by increasing the buffering capacity of the culture medium by adding HEPES.

Hypoxic regions are a common feature within rapidly growing malignant tumors such as non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Tissue hypoxia caused by inadequate blood supply occurs very early during tumor development, usually when the tumor diameter is just a few millimeters [1]. Therefore, over-expression of hypoxia-inducible transcription factor-1 (HIF-1), a "master" gene in the hypoxic response, is a frequent occurrence in many tumor cells, including NSCLC [2]. However, the role of HIF-1 in NSCLC remains controversial. The HIF-1 complex is a heterodimer consisting of a constitutively expressed HIF-1beta subunit and a HIF-1alpha subunit, which is highly transcriptionally regulated, as well as being susceptible to oxygen-dependent degradation of the protein [3]. Giatromanolaki et al [4] reported that HIF-1alpha over-expression is common in NSCLC, and that this is related to the up-regulation of various angiogenic factors and associated with poor prognosis. They also suggested that HIF pathway might be an important therapeutic target for NSCLC. However, these results are at odds with those of Volm et al [5], who demonstrated that NSCLC patients with HIF-1alpha-positive carcinomas had significantly longer median survival times than patients with HIF-1alpha-negative carcinomas. Yet another group [6] confirmed that down-regulation of HIF-1 abrogates hypoxia-induced cell growth arrest. More recently, Yu et al [7] reported that HIF-1alpha exerted an anti-apoptotic role in human umbilical vascular endothelial cells (HUVECs) under anoxic stress. As apoptosis is one of the most important mechanisms mediating cancer remission, investigation into the role of HIF-1alpha in apoptosis of lung cancer may provide useful information for the resolution of these controversies.

As a key mediator of the hypoxic response in animal cells, HIF-1 plays an important role in controlling the glycolysis pathway when cells are exposed to low oxygen tension. During hypoxia, cells shift to a primarily glycolytic metabolic mode by up-regulating HIF-1-dependent glycolytic genes, such as glucose transporter type 1(GLUT1), phosphoglycerate kinase 1(PGK1), hexokinase 1(HK1), etc [3,8,9]. In addition, intracellular pH decreases as a result of lactate acid accumulation caused by accelerated glycolysis. Because intracellular acidosis triggers apoptosis [10], blocking increased glycolytic activity by down regulating HIF-1alpha may reduce apoptosis of the hypoxic cells.

We investigated whether controlling HIF-1alpha expression regulated apoptosis of the lung adenocarcinoma cell line, A549, during hypoxia, and whether this effect of HIF-1alpha was dependent upon glycolysis. The research presented in this report addresses these fundamental questions about the role of HIF-1 in the pathophysiology of NSCLC.

siRNA plasmid vectors were constructed as previously described [11]. Pairs of annealed DNA oligonucleotides were inserted between the BglII and HindIII restriction sites of the EGFP-pSUPER vector (a gift from Dr. Chunlin Chen, the third Military Medicine University, China) in order to express short hairpin small interfering RNA (siRNA) under the control of the polymerase-III H1-RNA promoter. A nineteen-nucleotide (nt) target sequence derived from human HIF-1alpha mRNA (accession #U22431; bp 1470-1489) was selected as previously described [11]. A set of 64-nt oligos containing this sequence are described below: HIF-1alpha siRNA forward oligo,5'-gatccccATCCAGAGTCACTGGAACTttcaagaga AGTTCCAGTGACTCTGGATtttttggaaa-3'; reverse oligo, 5'-agcttttccaaaaa ATCCAGAGTCACTGGAACTtctcttgaaAGTTCCAGTGACTCTGGAggg-3'.

The target sequences of the HIF-1alpha siRNA and scrambled HIF-1alpha control siRNA were BLAST searched against the GenBank database. The HIF-1alpha targeting sequence matched exactly with partial sequences of the human HIF-1alpha gene, but not with any other genes. The scrambled control did not match any known human gene. Constructs expressing HIF-1alpha (wildtype) were a gift from Professor Cormac T. Taylor (University College, Dublin, Ireland).

A549 cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection, (Manassas, VA, USA). Cells (at 1 x 105 cells/ml) were plated in tissue culture flasks and incubated in normoxia (21% O2,74% N2 and 5% CO2) at 37degreesC in DMEM medium (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) supplemented with 10% heat-inactived fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen) and penicillin-streptomycin (50 mug/ml, Invitrogen). A549 cells were then plated onto 6-well, flat-bottom tissue culture plates (Becton Dickinson and Co., NJ, USA) at a density of 1 x 105 cells/well in DMEM medium. Hypoxic conditions were achieved by culturing cells in an incubator (Jouan, Saint-Nazaire, France.) with a 1% O2, 5% CO2, and 94% N2 atmosphere. Acidosis was neutralized by addition of 25 mM HEPES (Sigma-Aldrich Corp. St. Louis, MO, USA) buffer so as to increase the buffering capacity of the culture media[10].

Transient transfections were performed using the cationic lipid, Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen), according to the manufacturer's specifications. All of these experiments were performed in 6-well tissue culture plates with cells plated to reach 50-60% confluence on the day of transfection. Transfection efficiency averaged between 60-70%, as measured by green fluorescent protein expression. Cells were allowed to recover in DMEM for 20 h after transfection, and then the medium was changed and the culture was exposed to normoxia, hypoxia, or the glycolytic inhibitor 2-DG (5 mM, Sigma-Aldrich Corp [12] for 24 h before assays were performed.

RNA extraction and real-time PCR were performed as previously described [13-15]. Briefly, total cellular RNA was extracted using an acid guanidinium-phenol-chloroform method (TRIzol(R); Invitrogen). RNA integrity was confirmed by electrophoresis on ethidium bromide-stained 1% agarose gels. Total cellular RNA, 1 mug, was reverse transcribed at 37degreesC for 70 min in 20 mul containing 2.5 U reverse transcriptase (Fermentas Inc. Unit A Hanover, MD, USA), 10 mM dithiothreitol, 1 mM each of deoxyadenosine triphosphate (dATP), deoxythymidine triphosphate (dTTP), deoxycytidine triphosphate (dCTP), and deoxyguanidine triphosphate (dGTP), and 5 mug/ml oligo-dT primer (Fermentas Inc.). Reactions were stopped by heat inactivation for 10 min at 85degreesC. Primers were synthesized and HPLC purified (Takara, Dalian, China). Primer sequences used for amplification were as follows: HIF-1alpha: upstream primer, 5'-CTG ACC CTG CAC TCA ATC AA-3'; downstream primer, 5'-CTT TGC TTC TGT GTC TTC AGC AGC A-3'; HIF1-1alpha probe: 5'-FAM-CAC CTG AGC CTA ATA GTC CCA G-3'; GLUT1: upstream primer, 5'-CTTTGTGGCCTTCTTTGAAGT-3'; downstream primer, 5'-CCACACAGTTGCTCCACAT-3'; GLUT1 probe: 5'-FAM-CAGGCT TCTCCAACTGGACCTC-TAMRA-3'; HK1: upstream primer, 5'-TCCGTAGTGGGAAAAAGAGAA-3'; downstream primer, 5'-GACAATG TGATCAAACAGCTC-3'; HK1 probe: 5'-FAM-CACAACAAGATCTACGC CATTCC-TAMRA-3'; PGK1: upstream primer, 5'-CCACTTGCTGT GCCA AATGGA-3'; downstream primer, 5'-GAAGGACTTTACCTTCCAG GA-3'; PGK1 probe: 5'-FAM-CCAGTGCTC ACATGGCTGAC-3'; beta-actin: upstream primer, 5'-GCCAACACAGTGCTGTCT-3'; downstream primer, 5'-AGGAGC AATGATCTTGATCTT-3'; beta-actin probe: 5'-FAM-ATCTCCTTCTGCATCCT GTC-3'. Real-time PCR was performed on an ABI Prism 7700 sequence detection system (PE Applied Biosystems). The reactions were cycled 40 times after initial denaturation (95degreesC, 2 min) using the following parameters: denaturation, 95degreesC for 15 s and annealing and extension, 60degreesC for 1 min. The threshold cycle (Ct) was recorded for each sample to reflect the mRNA abundance level. The mRNA expression indexes of the three target genes were calculated as previously described [15].

For Western blot analysis, normoxic or hypoxic cells were scraped from dishes and cellular protein extracts were prepared by homogenization in ice cold lysis buffer (0.5 M Tris, 250 mM NaCl, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 0.2 M Na3VO4, 0.2 M NaF) containing a protease inhibitor cocktail (Sigma-Aldrich Chemie GmbH, Deisenhofen, Germany). Forty micrograms of protein were separated per lane by 12% sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). After electrophoretic transfer of proteins to a polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membrane (Millipore, Bedfordshire, United Kingdom), HIF-1alpha specific bands were detected by reaction with a rabbit antibody against HIF-1alpha (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA, USA), followed by horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit secondary antibody. Bands were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL, Amersham, Freiburg, Germany). Immunoblots were stripped using mild antibody stripping solution and re-probed with an anti-actin antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.). For quantification purposes, densitometric measurements were performed using the Quantity One image analysis software for Windows (Bio-Rad, Alfred Nobel Drive Hercules, CA, USA). All HIF-1alpha values were normalized to actin levels.

Adherent cells were released from the plate with 5 mM EDTA and collected. Floating cells were also recovered and included with the formerly adherent cells for the apoptosis assay. Following two washes by PBS, cells were permeabilized in 100 mug/ml digitonin solution at 4degreesC for 20 min. Cells were then washed and stained with 2 mug/ml of Apo2.7 monoclonal antibody for 15 min. The Apo2.7 antibody (Coulter Corp, Cedex, France) reacts with a 38-kDa mitochondrial membrane protein (7A6 antigen), which is expressed at an early stage of apoptosis, thus marking the process of apoptosis itself rather than simply the end point of dead cells [16]. Cells were finally washed with 1.0 ml of PBS with 2.5% fetal calf serum and stored in the dark on ice until assayed.

As shown in Figure 1, in A549 cells transfected with the siRNA EGFP-pSUPER vector system, the hypoxia-induced expression of HIF-1alpha mRNA was significantly suppressed. Accordingly, protein levels were likewise decreased in cells receiving this siRNA (Figure 2 and 3). Conversely, transfection of A549 with a HIF-1alpha expression vector led to up-regulation HIF-1alpha at both the mRNA and protein level during hypoxia (Figure 1, 2 and 3).

To investigate the role of HIF-1alpha in the regulation of glycolysis during hypoxia, message levels three key genes in this pathway were quantitated by real-time RT-PCR. Hypoxia increased the abundance of HIF-1alpha mRNA, as well as three key glycolysis genes, GLUT1, HK1, and PGK1. When HIF-1alpha expression was knocked-down with specific siRNA, expression of all three glycolytic genes was inhibited. In contrast, when the reverse condition, over-expression of HIF-1alpha, was applied, expression of these three genes increased in A549 cells (Figure 4).

To further investigate the role of HIF-1alpha in glycolysis of A549 cells during hypoxia, we monitored pH and the final product of glycolysis, lactate, in the cell culture medium. A hypoxic environment decreased the pH of the culture medium, while increasing the concentration of lactate. Consistent with a role for HIF-1alpha in this process, transfection with siRNA specific for this gene significantly restored normal pH and decreased lactate levels compared to a scrambled siRNA control. However, under normoxia, over-expression of HIF-1alpha in A549 cells led to decreased pH and increased lactate concentration in the culture medium (Figures 5 and 6). Under hypoxic conditions, addition of 2-DG prevented both acidification of the medium and the accumulation of lactate induced by over-expression of HIF-1alpha. The pH of medium supplemented with 25 mM HEPES was higher than un-supplemented medium after 24 h exposure to hypoxia.

Hypoxic conditions induced apoptosis of A549 cells, as detected by flow-cytometry and TUNEL assays. Over-expression of HIF-1alpha further exacerbates hypoxia-induced apoptosis. In contrast, siRNA-mediated suppression of HIF-1alpha expression rescued A549 cells from apoptotic death induced by hypoxia (Figure 7, 8, 9, 10). The pro-apoptotic activity of HIF-1alpha was effectively countered by the glycolytic inhibitor, 2-DG (Figure 7, 8, 9, 10), as well as by increasing the buffering capacity of the culture medium (Figure 7, 8, 9, 10).

HIF-1alpha is a "master" gene controlling the hypoxic response in mammalian cells and thus plays an important role in tumor growth. In this study, we demonstrated that modulating the expression level of HIF-1alpha was able to increase or decrease apoptosis of a tumor cell line, A549, under hypoxic stress. Furthermore, this effect of HIF-1alpha was dependent upon the glycolysis pathway and pH changes of the culture medium, both of which appear to be regulated by HIF-1alpha during hypoxia.

During hypoxia, transportation of glucose into the cell and glycolytic enzyme activity are enhanced. Consistent with previous studies, we also found that hypoxia up-regulated expression of two key genes in the glycolysis pathway, HK1 and PGK1, as well as a glucose transportation gene, GLUT1 [3,8,9]. These genes were responsive to the level of HIF-1alpha, as down-regulation of HIF-1alpha with siRNA decreased their expression, while up-regulation of HIF-1alpha with an expression vector similarly increased expression of GLUT1, HK1, and PGK1. Taken together, our results indicate that the expression of key genes controlling glucose transportation and glycolysis are under the control of HIF-1alpha during hypoxia. Furthermore, over-expression HIF-1alpha in hypoxic A549 cells resulted in increased accumulation of lactate and decreased pH in the culture medium. When HIF-1alpha expression was inhibited with siRNA during hypoxia in the converse experiment, lactate levels instead decreased, accompanied by a restoration of normal pH in the culture medium. As lactate is the final product of glycolysis, increased glycolysis is expected to lead to acidosis of cell culture medium during hypoxia. Therefore, lactate accumulation and acidic pH may be an indicator of increased glycolytic activity. Thus, based on the result showing that HIF-1alpha regulates the expression of genes involved in both glucose transportation and glycolysis described above, we conclude that HIF-1alpha regulates the glycolysis pathway of A549 cells during hypoxia.

It is important to note that in another model, hypoxic rat cardiomyocytes, glucose-uptake and metabolism was found to be protective against hypoxia-induced apoptosis [17]. In that study, glycolysis was shown to account for the protective effects, but other metabolic substrates provided no such protection from apoptosis [17]. In contrast to this, the study presented here found that HIF-1alpha contributes to up-regulation of the glycolysis pathway of A549 cells during hypoxia. Furthermore, this increased metabolic activity leads to hypoxia-induced apoptosis in this lung cancer cell line. Although HIF-1alpha was found to be protective against hypoxia-induced apoptosis in cardiomyocytes, we instead found that increased HIF-1alpha expression further exacerbated apoptosis in A549 lung adenocarcinoma cells. We also found that inhibition of glycolysis with 2-DG attenuated HIF-1alpha-induced apoptosis in these cells during hypoxia. Both increased glycolysis and the resulting apoptosis could be inhibited by knocking-down HIF-1alpha expression with siRNA. Together, our results strongly implicate HIF-1alpha in the hypoxia-induced apoptosis of A549 cells, which depends on the glycolysis pathway and acidosis of the culture medium.

Despite examples to the contrary, this effect is not entirely unprecedented. In another relevant study, Schmaltz et al [10] reported that apoptosis in hypoxic cultures was primarily due to decreased pH of the culture medium, most likely caused by lactic acidosis. Here, we also observed that decreased pH triggered apoptosis in A549 cells. We were able to partially inhibit HIF-1alpha-induced apoptosis by increasing the buffering capacity of the medium to reduce acidosis. Further pointing to a role for HIF-1alpha in these processes, siRNA-knockdown of HIF-1alpha significantly blocked by the decrease of pH and apoptosis induced by hypoxia.

Consistent with our results, Krick et al [18] recently reported that hypoxia suppressed alveolar epithelial cell proliferation and enhanced alveolar type II cell apoptosis through activation of the HIF-1alpha/HRE axis and BNIP3, but they did not further investigate the role of acidosis in the action of BNIP3. Kubasiak et al [19], however, demonstrated that BNIP3 protein accumulated more rapidly under acidic pH and peaked at a significantly higher level than at neutral pH when cells were exposed to hypoxia. Acidosis was found to increase binding of BNIP3 to mitochondrial membranes, leading to apoptosis of hypoxic cells.
###end p 49
###begin p 50
Taken together, when the cells are exposed to hypoxia, up-regulated expression of HIF-1alpha accelerates the glycolysis, which leads to the intracellular acidosis. Intracellular acidosis may activate the BNIP3 and promoted the hypoxic cell apoptosis. But this mechanism of HIF-1alpha on the hypoxia induced cell apoptosis needs further studies.

Our findings indicate that HIF-1alpha plays a role in hypoxia-induced A549 apoptosis, and that this influence is dependent upon up-regulation of the glycolysis pathway and the resultant drop in pH of the culture medium.
