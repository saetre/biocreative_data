We generated normal and tumour cell lines conditionally expressing Sp3. Cell growth was analyzed in vitro and after inoculation in nude mice. Apoptosis was assessed by pan- caspase activity assays, by counting fragmented nuclei and by determination of caspase 9 cleavage. Gene expression was determined by quantitative PCR. Cleavage by different caspases was performed after in vitro translation of the Sp3 cDNA in the presence of [S35] labelled methionine. Different tumour cell lines and head and neck tumour samples were tested for the presence of Sp3 by western blots. Correlation between Sp3 expression and overall survival has been statistically determined.

Conditional over-expression of Sp3 induces apoptosis and modifies expression of genes implicated in the regulation of cell cycle and pro and anti apoptotic genes. Sp3 over-expression strongly reduces the development of tumours in nude mice confirming its pro-apoptotic potential in vivo. However, cells can survive to apoptosis through selective Sp3 cleavage by caspase. Sp3 induction in established tumours resulted in transient regression then progression. Progression coincides with re-accumulation of the full length form of Sp3. Sp3 is over-expressed in tumour cell lines of different origins. The presence of high levels of the full-length form of Sp3 indicates a poor prognosis for overall survival of patients with head and neck tumours.

Sp3 is a zinc finger transcription factor that belongs to the Sp transcription factor family comprising Sp1, 2 and 4. Sp3 can act as an activator or a repressor of transcription depending on sumoylation processes [1]. It is expressed as a full-length 110 kDa protein but internal initiation of translation results in shorter Sp3 isoforms [2]. The relationship between Sp1 and tumourigenesis depends on the expression of genes implicated in growth control, apoptosis resistance and angiogenesis [3]. Moreover, down-regulation of over-expressed Sp1 protein in human fibrosarcoma cell lines inhibits tumour formation [4]. Sp1 is over-expressed in different types of tumour [5]. A relationship between Sp3 and cancer has also been suggested in recent studies [6] but has not been fully addressed. The above data have demonstrated the importance of Sp1 and Sp3 for tumour formation. However, over-expression of Sp1 results in apoptosis in different cell types [7]. This is controversial since Sp1 and Sp3 protect cortical neurons against apoptosis [8] and induce genes implicated in survival [9]. Moreover, betulinic acid, a natural product with anti-tumour activity, induces apoptosis by degrading Sp1 and Sp3 [10]. These data encouraged us to address the role of Sp3 in apoptosis and to evaluate its prognosis value in highly aggressive head and neck tumours.

The role of Sp3 in apoptosis regulation was analysed in Chinese hamster lung fibroblasts (R443) and colon carcinoma cells (LS174) conditionally expressing full-length Myc-tagged Sp3 [11]. Both cells were chosen in order to determine the effect of Sp3 over-expression in a normal and a tumour cell line. Figure 1 shows that exogenous Sp3 was induced by tetracycline stimulation in the different cell types. Two independent LS174 clones (clone 25 (S25) and clone 27 (S27)) and one R443 clone conditionally expressing Sp3 were tested. Western blot experiments with an anti-Sp3 antibody showed that exogenous Sp3 was over-expressed compared to the endogenous form in both cell lines. Moreover, endogenous Sp3 was more highly expressed in LS174 than in R443 cells. Note that following over-expression, extra bands were detected at 60 and 35 kDa with both anti-Sp3 and anti-Myc antibodies. These bands were also observed in extracts from control LS174 cells after a longer exposure. Figure 1 also shows that overexpression of Sp3 do not significantly affect the Sp1 endogenous levels. Figure 2A shows that tetracycline induction of Sp3 resulted in decreased accumulation of both R443 and LS174 cells in a time dependent manner. Figure 2B shows that lower concentrations of tetracycline still induce cell death in R443 and S27 cells. The same effects were observed at concentrations of 1 or 0.1 microg/ml tetracycline since induction of Sp3 is equivalent at such concentrations as already described [11]. At a tetracycline concentration of 0.01 microg/ml Sp3 levels are significantly decreased while inexistent at 0.001 microg/ml.

A) Cells were cultivated in the presence or absence of tetracycline (1 microg/ml) and counted every day for three days. Each day, cell number in absence of tetracycline was taken as the reference value (100%). The percentage of cells remaining in the presence of tetracycline is plotted. For LS174 cells, two independent clones (S25 and S27) expressing different amounts of Sp3 were evaluated. For R443 cells, a previously described representative clone [11] was compared to control cells. These results are the mean of three independent experiments. Significant modifications (* p<0.05) are indicated. B) R443/Sp3 cells and LS174 cells (S27) were incubated in the absence (0) or in the presence of the indicated tetracycline concentrations for 72 hours. Cell amount in the absence of tetracycline was taken as the reference value (100%). The percentage of cells remaining in the presence of tetracycline is plotted. These results are the mean of three independent experiments. Significant modifications (* p<0.05) are indicated.

Prevention of cell accumulation can be attributed to cell cycle arrest or induction of apoptosis. We carefully addressed the apoptosis mechanisms by three independent methods: measurement of pan-caspase activity, evaluation of the number of fragmented nuclei and cleavage of caspase 9. Figure 3A shows that induction of Sp3 resulted in increased pan-caspase activity. The specific pan-caspase inhibitor Z-VAD-FMK inhibits both basal and Sp3-dependent caspase activation which was stronger in LS174 cells (clone S27), probably reflecting the higher basal amounts of Sp3 in the absence of tetracycline. We have then more carefully addressed the apoptotic potential of Sp3 in the LS174 tumour cells. A quantitative analysis of fragmented nuclei upon Sp3 induction presented in Figure 3B illustrates that more than 50% cells were apoptotic following 72 hours of Sp3 induction and that the increased number of apoptotic cells paralleled the cleavage/activation of caspase 9 and PARP cleavage (Figure 3C), two substrates for active caspase 3 [12]. Sp3 effects on cell accumulation are partially inhibited by the pan-caspase inhibitor Z-VAD-FMK indicating that Sp3 induces a caspase-dependent apoptosis. Such reversion is coherent with the results of Deniaud et al who has observed the same effects of Z-VAD-FMK on Sp1-induced apoptosis [7]. Also note that Z-VAD-FMK treatment by itself results in cell accumulation suggesting that the basal caspase activity observed in figure 3A has been inhibited. Altogether our data clearly show that Sp3 over-expression is pro-apoptotic.

Cells described in Figure 1 were tested for Sp3-mediated apoptosis by different methods. A) Pan-caspase activity was measured in R443 and LS174 cells expressing Sp3 (S27 for LS174) in the presence or absence of 50 microM Z-VAD-FMK as indicated in materials and methods. Results are the mean of three independent experiments performed in duplicate and significant modifications (* p<0.05) are indicated. B) Control or Sp3 expressing LS174 (S27) cells were cultivated in the absence (-Tet) or presence (+Tet) of tetracycline then stained with DAPI. At least ten photographs for each condition (twenty nuclei per photograph) were examined for the presence of fragmented nuclei. The percentage of cells with fragmented nuclei is plotted. The results are representative of three independent experiments. A significant increase of cell number with fragmented nuclei (* p<0.05) is indicated.

The involvement of Sp3 in cell death was further evaluated by testing the expression of different specific transcripts involved in apoptosis and survival. We focused on a limited number of major pro- or anti-apoptotic genes (88) (File S1). Of these, 11 were up-regulated and only one (Bcl-2) was down-regulated. Figure 4 shows that both pro- (TGF beta, GADD45, MyD88, DR3, Puma, Fas caspase 9) and anti-apoptotic (Egr-1, IEX-1, STAT-5, Bcl2) genes were modulated by Sp3. p21/WAF1 is not directly implicated in apoptosis but regulates cell cycle. Regulation of p21/WAF1 by Sp3 has already been described [13]. It suggests that the decrease in cell number observed in figure 2 is a combination of Sp3-induced apoptosis and cell cycle arrest. Since p27 expression is induced upon Sp3 down-regulation by siRNA [14] we have tested its amounts in both R443 and LS74 cells upon Sp3 induction. No modifications were observed in both cell lines (File S2). This complex set of regulated genes may explain the contradictory functions of Sp3 in the regulation of cell death and cell growth.

After extensive apoptosis, a few cells became progressively resistant to Sp3 induction. Figure 5A shows the two main Sp3 degradation products of 60 and 35 kDa (cleaved product 1 and 2, (CP1, CP2)) detected with the Myc antibody in all the resistant clones. This suggests a cleavage mechanism at specific proteolytic sites. Note that both fragments were observed in control cells at a lower intensity, probably reflecting the high basal caspase activity of LS174 cells (Figure 1). In vitro cleavage assays on in vitro translated protein (Figure 5B) or on cell extracts from tetracycline-induced cells (Figure 5C) demonstrated that Sp3 is cleaved by caspase 3 and/or caspase 6 but not caspase 7. Such cleavage generates two fragments equivalent to those detected by western blot in control and tetracycline-resistant clones. Our results strongly suggest that Sp3 is a caspase substrate.

LS174 cells conditionally expressing Sp3 were sub-cutaneously injected into nude mice. Figure 6A shows that injection of LS174 cells resulted in the formation of tumours two weeks following inoculation. Doxycycline-mediated induction of Sp3 prevented tumour development throughout the 60 days of follow-up. Only one mouse out of twelve developed a tumour upon doxycycline treatment. Western blot analysis revealed the absence of full-length Sp3 and the presence of Sp3 degradation products (Figure 6B, lane 5, Cont'). This suggests that Sp3-mediated cell death was bypassed by Sp3 cleavage. Interestingly, Sp3 induction in established tumours resulted in regression at first, but after two weeks progression was observed. Analysis of tumour extracts from tumours in the progression phase revealed the presence of Sp3 degradation products CP1 and CP2, but small amounts of exogenous full-length Sp3 were also detectable (Figure 6B, lanes 6 to 9, Cont+DOX). As expected, the full length form of Sp3 was undetectable in extracts from tumours that have grown in the absence of doxycycline (Figure 6B, lanes 1 to 4, Cont). Specific pan caspase activity in the control tumours and in the tumours that have grown in the presence of doxycycline (Figure 6C) is at least ten times lower than in the original cells (see figure 3A). Moreover, pan caspase activity has a trend to be superior in the control tumours than in tumours that have grown in the presence of doxycycline (Figure 6C, p = 0.084). These results suggest in vivo selection of mutant tumour cells with less caspase activity than the original cells. This lower caspase activity highlighted by Sp3 accumulation is a hallmark of aggressive tumour cells. In the adapted cells, full-length active Sp3 could stimulate transcription of genes involved in activation of the cell cycle [15] and angiogenesis [11]. Hence, the observed tumour progression could be the result of decrease apoptotic capacity and increased proliferation and angiogenic potential of the adapted cells.

A) Nude mice were inoculated with cells conditionally expressing Sp3 (LS174 clone S27). Comparison of the size of the tumours in animals receiving doxycycline in drinking water (DOX) or normal water (Cont). 37 days following inoculation, half of the control mice were treated with doxycycline (Cont+DOX). Tumour size was measured at the indicated times and tumour volume was calculated and plotted+/-SD. Statistically significant differences (p<0.05) between controls and doxycycline treated mice (*, immediate treatment after inoculation; **, treatment after development of the tumours) are indicated.

The relevance of Sp3 expression for tumour aggressiveness was first evaluated in different tumour cell lines. Sp3 was more highly expressed in tumour than in normal cell lines (fibroblast, endothelial cells) (Figure 7A). We then tried to extrapolate these results to human head and neck carcinomas (H&N). As in colon cancer, H&N tumours have mutations in ras and over-expression of EGF receptors leading to activation of the ERK pathway. We unsuccessfully tried to constitutively express Sp3 in H&N tumour cells, suggesting that the pro-apototic potential of Sp3 is also efficient in these cells. Sp3 levels in 52 H&N tumour samples were previously analysed by our team [16]. The median follow-up for all patients was 60 months. Table 1 and Figure 7B show that Sp3 expression is a factor of poor prognosis for overall survival (p = 0.043). Moreover, patient age, tumour size and nodal status were also significantly correlated with overall survival (p<0.05) and serve as positive controls. A multivariate Cox regression model showed that Sp3 expression is an independent prognosis parameter for overall survival (Table 2, p = 0.038). Western blot analysis on 16 tumours samples shows that Sp3 and Sp1 follow the same expression profile (low expression of Sp3/low expression of Sp1; high expression of Sp3/high expression of Sp1) which is consistent with the prognostic role of Sp1 described for other tumour types (File S3). It is interesting to note that the amount of CP2 in human and experimental tumours upon progression (Figure 6B) is more abundant than in cells stimulated by tetracycline for a few hours. This suggests that the phenomenon of adaptation has been induced progressively after a first round of degradation by caspases.

Identification of new prognostic markers for tumour aggressiveness is important for optimising treatments. For this reason we analysed the relevance of the transcription factor Sp3 as an indicator of tumour aggressiveness. Our study was based on previous observations describing Sp1 as an indicator of poor prognosis for pancreatic cancers [17]. However, the Shi et al study was contradicted by the results of Deniaud et al. [7], which showed that Sp1 over-expression induces apoptosis. Although it is over-expressed in tumour cells and tumour samples, Sp3 also induces apoptosis. One part of the puzzle has been elucidated since increased Sp3 expression seems progressive from benign to aggressive tumours [18]. The present data have highlighted that accumulation of Sp3 is progressive all along the tumour process. This mechanism of adaptation apparently depends on a balance between reduced of Sp3 cleavage and increased Sp3 expression and/or stability. Hence, the presence of the full-length active form of Sp3 results in increased transcription of many genes related to tumour growth [19] and angiogenesis [11]. The use of an inducible cellular system has allowed evaluation of the initiation of apoptosis related to Sp3 accumulation, a mechanism mimicking the first steps that potentially happen in vivo. In the case of tumour development, Sp3 could first be considered as a tumour suppressor during the initial steps, then as an oncogene, since it boosts growth and angiogenesis. Accumulation of Sp3 could be the result of increased ERKs activity since ERKs-induced Sp3 phosphorylation results in increased half-life [11]. The initiation of tumour development by oncogenes would allow adjustment of Sp3 levels, thus controlling the balance between growth and apoptosis. The latter (i.e. apoptosis) has been addressed by evaluating the genes activated upon Sp3 induction. Only 12 genes were modulated. While TGFbeta [20], Egr1 [21], p21 [13], IEX1 [22], STAT5 [23], PUMA [24], FAS [25], BAK [26], Caspase 9 [27] and Bcl2 [28] contain active Sp3 binding sites in their promoters suggesting direct regulation, GADD45 (a target of p53 [29] and FOXO [30]) and MyD88 (a target of STAT-1 and IRF-1 [31]) do not, suggesting indirect regulation. Since TGFbeta was maximally induced upon Sp3 overexpression and because its role on apoptosis was highly described, we tried to inhibit its action with blocking antibodies. No modification was observed suggesting that it is not the "master factor" implicated in Sp3-dependent apoptosis. The cell growth step of the mechanism has been addressed in two ways: 1) the possibility of obtaining cells resistant to Sp3-induced apoptosis through specific cleavage by caspase; the presence of a putative consensus cleavage site (DSSD) in the Sp3 sequence supports our results but the cleavage at this specific site needs to be confirmed; 2) formation of tumours in nude mice has highlighted in vivo selection processes. After an initial regression phase, a progression phase is observed. This progression coincides with an accumulation of the full-length form of Sp3. We hypothesised that the two phases observed in mice mimic the process which happens in human tumours resulting in in vivo selection of aggressive tumour cells with decrease apoptotic potential and increased growth and angiogenic capacities.

Following subcloning of Sp3 cDNA into the pCDNA3 vector [11] it was translated in vitro and cleaved with recombinant caspases (BD PharMingen; San Diego, CA, USA) as previously described [34]. Long and short forms of Sp3 can be produced from this cDNA. The effect of the pan-caspase inhibitor Z-VAD-FMK (50 microM) was also monitored in vitro. The same protocol was applied to Sp3 obtained from cells stimulated by tetracycline for 24 hours. Following caspase treatment, proteins were run on 10% polyacrylamide gels.

Animal experiments were performed in accordance with the regulations of our institute's ethics committee. LS174 cells conditionally expressing Sp3 were injected subcutaneously into the flank of 6 week-old nude (nu/nu) mice (Harlan, Gannat, France). Doxycycline (750 microg/ml) was added to the drinking water from day 3 after the injection or when tumour volume reached an average of 600 mm3. Care of the animals was provided according to institutional guidelines: European Directive 86/609/EEC.

50 microg of whole cell extracts from the different cell types or cytosolic extracts from tumour homogenates [16] were subjected to western blotting using anti-Sp3 (D 20, Santa Cruz, CA). The level of Sp3 in each cell or tumour sample was quantified with a GeneGnome imaging system (Syngene, Frederick, MD, USA) and normalised to the signals of beta-actin and Sp3 present in LS174 cell extracts.

Quantitative data were analysed using one-way ANOVA. Data were expressed as means+/-SEM. P<0.05 was considered to be significant. For tumour analysis, all categorical data were described using numbers (n.) and percentages (%). Quantitative data were presented using median and range or mean and standard deviation. Censored data were described using Kaplan Meier estimation including median survival, and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI). Statistical analysis was two-sided and performed using R-2.5.0 for Windows. For univariate analysis, statistical comparisons were performed using the Chi-squared test or Fisher exact test for categorical data, the Student T test or Wilcoxon test for quantitative data, and Log-Rank test or Peto and Peto modification of the Gehan-Wilcoxon test for censored data. Multivariate analysis was performed by creating a Cox proportional hazards model. All variables associated with p<0.05 in the univariate analysis were included in the model. Proportional hazards tested for all entered variables using graphical (Schoenfeld residuals, log-log plot of cumulative hazard) and statistical methods. The search for interactions was automated using the R-2.5.0 stepAIC procedure, with interactions considered significant if p<0.01. Overall survival (OS) was defined as the interval between first diagnosis of cancer and death related to any cause. Follow-up was limited to 60 months for all patients. Patients lost to follow-up were censored after 60 months or at the date of their last known contact.

Sp3 overexpression do not affect p27 expression. Control R443 and LS 174 cells (C) or their derivatives expressing Sp3 (S and S 27 for LS 174) were cultivated in the presence or absence of tetracycline for 24 hours and analysed for the presence of full-length form of Sp3 (FL Sp3) and p27 (Ref antibodies;K25020,Transduction Laboratories (Mississauga, ON,Canada)).Total Erk 2 is shown as a loading control. This experiment is representative of two independent experiments.
