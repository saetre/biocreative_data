The complete nucleotide sequence of the maize chlorotic mottle virus (MCMV) genome has been determined to be 4437 nucleotides. The viral genome has four long open reading frames (ORFs) which could encode polypeptides of 31.6, 50, 8.9 and 25.1 kd. If the termination codons, for the polypeptides encoded by the 50 and 8.9 kd ORFs are suppressed, readthrough products of 111 and 32.7 kd result. The 31.6 and 50 kd ORFs overlap for nearly the entire length of the 31.6 kd ORF. Striking amino acid homology has been observed between two potential polypeptides encoded by MCMV and polypeptides encoded by carnation mottle virus (CarMV) and turnip crinkle virus (TCV). The 25.1 kd ORF most likely encodes the capsid protein. The similar genome organization and amino acid sequence homology of MCMV with CarMV and TCV suggest an evolutionary relationship with these members of the carmovirus group.
