The human pS2 gene, whose expression is restricted to breast cancer cells, and whose transcription is induced by oestrogen in the human breast cancer cell line MCF-7, has been cloned from both placental and MCF-7 cell DNA. The exon-intron organization has been established by electron microscopy using genomic DNA-cDNA or -mRNA hybrid duplexes and by sequencing the exons and exon-intron junctions. The overall organization within and around the pS2 gene is the same in placental and MCF-7 cell DNA and the exonic sequences are identical to those previously determined from the cDNA. The 5'-flanking region of the pS2 gene is also identical (with the exception of two base transitions) in the two tissues. Thus no gene rearrangement nor sequence modification has occurred in the pS2 gene of the malignant and polyploid MCF-7 cells. A TATA-box, a CAAT-box and a GC-rich motif are present in the 5'-flanking region of the pS2 gene, but the latter motif is unusually located between the TATA-box and the capsite. No significant homology could be detected between the 5' flanking sequences of the pS2 gene and those of other oestrogen-responsive genes from different species.
