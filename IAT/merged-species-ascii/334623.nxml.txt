The complete infectious genome of a South African isolate of the geminivirus maize streak (MSV-S) has been cloned, characterized, and sequenced. Using an A. tumefaciens Ti plasmid delivery system, the cloned -2.7 kb single circular MSV component was shown to be necessary and sufficient for infection of maize. Based on sequence analysis of the infectious clone, MSV-S is highly homologous to the previously characterized Kenyan and Nigerian isolates. While the genomic organization of MSV-S has elements in common with each of these previously characterized isolates, it is identical to neither and its analysis addresses the discrepancies between them. The result is a somewhat simplified and unified picture of the viral genome, the structural organization of which is essentially identical to that of wheat dwarf virus.
