Ovaries of neonatal and adult sheep were examined for expression of the TGF-betas 1-3 and their receptors (RI and RII) by in situ hybridization using ovine cDNAs. The effects of TGF-beta 1 and 2 on proliferation and differentiation of ovine granulosa cells in vitro were also studied.

The expression patterns of TGF-beta 1 and 2 were similar in that both mRNAs were first observed in thecal cells of type 3 (small pre-antral) follicles. Expression of both mRNAs continued to be observed in the theca of larger follicles and was also present in cells within the stroma and associated with the vascular system of the ovary. There was no evidence for expression in granulosa cells or oocytes. Expression of TGF-beta 3 mRNA was limited to cells associated with the vascular system within the ovary. TGFbetaRI mRNA was observed in oocytes from the type 1 (primordial) to type 5 (antral) stages of follicular growth and granulosa and thecal cells expressed this mRNA at the type 3 (small pre-antral) and subsequent stages of development. The TGFbetaRI signal was also observed in the ovarian stroma and vascular cells. In ovarian follicles, mRNA encoding TGFbetaRII was restricted to thecal cells of type 3 (small pre-antral) and larger follicles. In addition, expression was also observed in some cells of the surface epithelium and in some stromal cells. In granulosa cells cultured for 6 days, both TGF-beta 1 and 2 decreased, in a dose dependent manner, both the amount of DNA and concentration of progesterone.

In summary, mRNA encoding both TGF-beta 1 and 2 were synthesized by ovarian theca, stroma and cells of the vascular system whereas TGF-beta 3 mRNA was synthesized by vascular cells. Luteinizing granulosa cells also responded to both TGF-beta 1 and beta 2 in vitro. These findings in sheep are consistent with TGF-beta potentially being an important autocrine regulator of thecal cell function and possibly a paracrine regulator of ovarian cell function at various development stages.

Members of the transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) superfamily are important intraovarian growth factors [1-6]. Three key members of the TGF-beta subfamily, namely TGF-beta1, TGF-beta2 and TGF-beta3, have been shown to be produced by ovarian cells [7-13]. However, the cellular distribution of these proteins varies between species. Likewise, the effects of TGF-betas on granulosa cell function also vary between species. In rodents, TGF-betas are potent stimulators of granulosa cell proliferation [14-16] whereas in other species, such as cattle and pigs, these growth factors have only a mild stimulatory or even inhibitory effect [17-20]. Likewise, TGF-betas stimulate progesterone synthesis from rodent granulosa cells [21-23] where inhibitory effects are observed in granulosa cells collected from sheep, cattle and pigs [17,24-26]. Exceptional ovulation rates and sterility have been observed in lines of sheep with mutations in two members of the TGF-beta superfamily, namely growth differentiation factor 9 or bone morphogenetic protein 15 or one of their receptors, activin like kinase-6 [6,27]. However, little is known about the roles of other members of the TGF-beta superfamily in sheep and thus the potential interactions of members of the TGF-beta superfamily are unclear. The objectives of this study in sheep were to localize the ovarian cellular types expressing mRNA encoding TGF-beta1, TGF-beta2, TGF-beta3, TGFbetaRI and TGFbetaRII and to determine the effects of TGF-beta1 and TGF-beta2 on granulosa cell proliferation/survival and progesterone production in vitro.

Total cellular RNA was isolated from ovine ovary using TRIzol according to manufacturer's instructions. First strand cDNA was produced from total cellular RNA using a poly t primer. Complementary DNAs encoding a portion of the coding sequence of the genes were isolated using standard PCR techniques. For individual cDNAs generated, primer sequences and annealing temperature are given in table 1. Resulting PCR products were ligated into appropriate vectors and their nucleotide sequence determined by automated sequence analysis (Waikato DNA Sequencing Facility; The University of Waikato; Hamilton, New Zealand). These sequences were compared with known sequences to confirm identity using the GAP program of GCG (Wisconsin Package Version 10.2, Genetics Computer Group; Madison, Wisconsin). All sequences were >80% identical to those listed as reference sequences in table 1 indicating that the ovine homologue of the respective genes had been obtained.

All experiments were performed in accordance with the 1999 Animal Welfare Act Regulations of New Zealand. All animals had ad lib access to pasture and water and lambs were kept with their mothers until just prior to tissue collection. Romney ewes and lambs were killed by administration of a barbiturate overdose (Pentobarbitone; 200 mg/kg, Southern Veterinary Supplies, Christchurch, New Zealand). Recovered ovaries were fixed in 4% (w/v) phosphate-buffered paraformaldehyde and embedded in paraffin wax.

Cellular localization of mRNAs was determined using the in situ hybridization protocol described previously with minor modifications [28]. Sense and anti-sense RNA probes were generated from cDNA encoding the gene of interest with T7, T3 or SP6 RNA polymerase using the Riboprobe combination system (Promega, Dade Behring Diagnostics Ltd., Auckland, New Zealand). For all in situ hybridizations, 4-6 mum tissue sections were incubated overnight at 55degreesC with 45,000 cpm/mul (approximately 48,000 dpm/mul) of 33P-labelled antisense RNA. Non-specific hybridization of RNA was removed by RNase A digestion followed by stringent washes (2 x SSC, 50% formamide, 65degreesC and 0.2 x SSC at 37degreesC). Following washing, sections were dehydrated, air dried and coated with autoradiographic emulsion (LM-1 emulsion; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, New Zealand). Emulsion-coated slides were exposed at 4degreesC for 3 weeks, developed for 3 1/2 minutes in D19 developer (Eastman Kodak, Rochester, NY), development was stopped using a 1 minute incubation in 1% acetic acid and slides were fixed with a 10 minute incubation in Ilfofix II (Ilford Limited, Cheshire, England). Sections were stained with hematoxylin and then viewed and photographed using both light and dark field illumination on an Olympus BX-50 microscope (Olympus New Zealand Ltd., Lower Hutt, New Zealand). Non-specific hybridization was monitored by hybridizing at least two tissue sections from each age group (lamb and adult) with approximately equal concentrations of the sense RNA for each gene. Hybridization was considered to be specific when the intensity of silver grains, as measured by visual assessment, over a cellular type was greater than that observed in the area of the slide not containing tissue. For all genes, hybridization of the sense RNA over the tissue section was similar or lower in intensity to that observed on the areas of the slide not containing tissue of both the sense and antisense hybridized slides and thus was considered non-specific.

Classification of follicles was based on the system outlined by Lundy et al. [29]. Briefly, type 1/1a follicles consist of an oocyte surrounded by a single layer of flattened or mixed flattened and cuboidal cells. Type 2 follicles contain 1 < 2 layers of cuboidal granulosa cells whereas type 3 follicles contain 2 < 4 layers of cuboidal granulosa cells. Type 4 follicles have >4 layers of granulosa cells and a well defined theca but have not yet formed an antrum. Type 5 follicles have multiple layers of granulosa cells, a well defined theca and a defined antrum. All follicles with signs of degeneration (i.e. pyknotic granulosa cells, lack of a distinct basement membrane or degenerate oocytes) were excluded from the study. Ovarian sections from a minimum of eight animals, including at least three lambs and three adults, were examined for each gene studied. In addition, each follicle class was observed in a minimum of three animals. No differences in expression patterns between lamb and adults ovaries were noted in this study.

Ovaries were collected from ewes following slaughter at the local abattoir, transported back to the laboratory at room temperature, washed in 3% bleach solution in PBS for 5 minutes, rinsed twice in PBS and stored in Leibovitz media containing 0.1% BSA, 100 U/ml penicillin and 100 mug/ml streptomycin. Follicles approximately 1-2 mm in diameter were dissected away from the ovaries and stored in Leibovitz media until collection of granulosa cells. The granulosa cells were collected by cutting follicles in half followed by manual scraping of cells from the follicular wall using a wire loop. Oocytes and follicular debris were removed from the cells using a micro-glass pipette. Remaining cells were collected by centrifugation at 300 g for 5 min at room temperature, washed once in 5 mls Leibovitz media, twice in 5 mls McCoys media (Sigma, Auckland, New Zealand) with 100 U/ml penicillin, 100 mug/ml streptomycin and 2 mM GlutaMAX-1 and resuspended using a syringe and needle. Cell viability was determined using trypan blue exclusion and 100,000 viable cells per well (250 mul total volume) were added in McCoys media containing 100 U/ml penicillin, 100 mug/ml streptomycin, 2 mM GlutaMAX-1, 5 ng/ml selenium (Sigma), 10 ng/ml insulin (Sigma), 5 mug/ml apo-transferrin (Sigma), 30 ng/ml androstenedione (Sigma), 3 ng/ml ovine FSH (purified in our laboratory; 1.4 X USDA-oFSH-19-SIAFP RP2), 1 ng/ml IGF-1 (Long-R3, GroPep, Adelaide, SA 5000, Australia) with varying doses (0-10 ng/ml) of purified human TGF-beta1 and recombinant human TGF-beta2 (R & D Systems, Minneapolis, MN). Cells were cultured at 37degreesC in a 5% CO2 incubator. Every 48 hours, 200 mul of media was removed from each well and replaced with 200 mul of warmed media that had been prepared at the start of the culture and stored at 4degreesC. Media samples from the last 48 hours of treatment were collected on day 6 of treatment and frozen at -20degreesC for later determination of progesterone concentrations by RIA. Unattached cells were removed by 2 washes with McCoys media at 37degreesC. Attached cells were lysed by incubating cells at 37degreesC in 100 mul distilled water for 1-2 hours followed by freezing at -70degreesC. All treatments were performed at least in triplicate with three independent pools of granulosa cells. Within an assay, individual values outside of 20% of the mean value for the treatment were discarded. Points in which at least 2 of the replicates were not within 20% of each other were regarded as missing data. This occurred for the 10 ng TGF-beta1 measure of DNA in a single pool of granulosa cells.

Granulosa cells were collected as described above and either frozen immediately after collection or plated in 6 well culture dishes at a density of 1.0-1.5 x 106 viable cells per well in 2 mls of control (i.e. no TGF-beta) culture media described above for 48 hours. At this time, unattached cells were removed by washing the wells twice with PBS. RNA was collected using TRIzol according to the manufacturer's instructions. First strand cDNA was produced from total cellular RNA using the SuperScripttrade mark preamplification system for first strand cDNA synthesis. An initial PCR was performed with 4 week old ovary RNA to obtain the ovine sequence of a region of the TGFbetaRII gene which spans introns 4 and 5 in the human sequence (AY675319) and a second set of primers was designed based on the ovine sequence (see table 1). Expression of TGFbetaRII was determined by PCR using the Qiagen Taq PCR core Kit (Biolab Scientific Limited) and the internal ovine primers listed in table 1 with the following conditions: initial denaturing cycle of 3 minutes at 94degreesC followed by 40 cycles of denaturing at 94degreesC for 1 minute, annealing at 55degreesC for 1 minute and extension at 72degreesC for 2 minutes and a final extension at 72degreesC for 10 minutes. cDNA generated from a 4 week old lamb ovary was run as a positive control whereas replacement of cDNA with water was used as a negative control. Expression of TGFbetaRII was assessed by visualization of DNA bands of the correct size following gel electrophoresis. Identity of product was confirmed by sequencing.

Concentration of progesterone per mug DNA was calculated for individual wells before averaging for each treatment within each assay. Points in which at least 2 of the replicates were not within 30% of each other were regarded as missing data. Changes in the concentrations of progesterone in media and DNA content after culture were analysed with the general linear model procedure of SAS. Replicate was included in the model as baseline progesterone and DNA values varied among the granulosa cell pools. Differences between least square means were evaluated using least significant differences and were considered significant when p < 0.05. Data presented are least square means. The standard errors of least square means were 0.7 ng/well, 0.2 mug/well and 0.5 ng/mug for progesterone, DNA and p4 per DNA, respectively.

The mRNA for TGF-beta1 was not observed in granulosa cells or oocytes of any follicles (Figure 1a,1b, table 2). However, TGF-beta1 mRNA was observed in stromal and/or thecal cells of type 3 follicles, in the theca interna of type 4 and 5 follicles and also in the stroma and cells of the vascular system. Within the theca interna, the cells closest to the basement membrane usually had more intense signal than those further away (Figure 1a,1b).

The pattern of expression of mRNA encoding TGF-beta2 was similar to that observed for TGF-beta1, with hybridization limited to the thecal cells of type 3 and larger follicles (Figure 1c,1d, table 2). However, hybridization within the thecal layer appeared evenly distributed in contrast to the signal for TGF-beta1 (compare panels a, b and c, d in Figure 1). Expression of TGF-beta2 mRNA was also observed in some surface epithelium and stromal cells as well as cells associated with the vascular system.

Expression of TGFbetaRI mRNA was observed in oocytes of all types of follicles (Figure 2a,2b,2c,2d, table 2). Granulosa and thecal cells of type 3 and larger follicles also expressed TGFbetaRI mRNA (Figure 2c,2d). Signal was also observed in the surface epithelium, stromal cells (Figure 2a,2b,2c,2d and luteal tissue (data not shown).

Expression of TGFbetaRII mRNA was not observed in types 1,1a or 2 follicles (Figure 2e,2f,2g,2h, table 2). Also, in larger follicles TGFbetaRII mRNA was not detected in granulosa cells or oocytes (Figure 2e,2f,2g,2h). In type 3 and larger follicles, expression of TGFbetaRII was localized to the theca interna (Figure 2e,2f,2g,2h, table 2). As was observed with TGF-beta1, expression of TGFbetaRII within the theca was most intense in the cells adjacent to the basement membrane (Figure 2e,2f,2g,2h). Signal was also observed in some cells of the surface epithelium (Figure 2e,2f), and in stroma (Figure 2e,2f,2g,2h) and luteal tissue (data not shown).

Both TGF-beta1 and TGF-beta2 inhibited progesterone synthesis of cultured granulosa cells, whether expressed as a function of number of cells placed in culture (Figure 3, top panel) or as a function of DNA content at the end of culture (Figure 3, bottom panel) with significant affects observed with as little as 0.1 ng/ml of either TGF-beta. Treatment with either TGF-beta also reduced DNA content at the termination of culture (Figure 3, middle panel). For both variables, no differences were observed between the effect of TGF-beta1 and TGF-beta2 at any dose of growth factor tested. In contrast to the lack of detectable expression of the TGFbetaRII mRNA observed in situ, freshly isolated or cultured granulosa cells expressed mRNA for the TGFbetaRII when assessed by RT-PCR (Figure 4).

In the ewe, expression of TGF-beta1 and TGF-beta2 mRNA in the follicle was limited to thecal cells during all stages of follicular growth examined. Furthermore, expression of TGF-beta3 mRNA was not observed in any follicular cells. This is in contrast to the observed expression patterns for these proteins in other species where TGF-beta1 and TGF-beta2 have been localized to granulosa as well as thecal cells and sometimes also to the oocytes of many species [8,12,13,31-33]. Also in contrast to sheep, expression of TGF-beta3 in cattle and cats was observed in the oocyte, theca and granulosa of follicles at various stages of development [12,13]. In pigs, the theca interna has been proposed to be the major source of TGF-beta since granulosa cells express TGF-beta1 mRNA without seeming to make the protein [11]. Similarly, expression of TGF-beta2 mRNA has been observed in bovine oocytes, but no detectable TGF-beta activity was observed [17], although other studies have demonstrated TGF-beta protein in the oocytes using immunocytochemistry [12]. In addition, granulosa cells isolated from pigs and cattle produce little if any TGFbeta bioactivity when cultured in vitro [9,11]. Thus, it seems likely that in some species, follicular TGF-beta activity originates primarily from the thecal cells, with control of activity possibly occurring at several levels including gene transcription (this study), protein translation [11] or activation of the protein [17].

Similar to what has been observed in other species [32,34,35], expression of TGFbetaRI mRNA was observed in several different cell-types of the sheep ovary including the oocyte, granulosa cells, thecal cells, stroma, luteal cells and surface epithelium. While expression of TGFbetaRII mRNA was also observed in stroma, luteal cells and the surface epithelium, its expression within the follicle was limited to the theca. A similar pattern of expression for the TGFbetaRII mRNA was observed in mouse follicles, with expression most prominent in the theca and barely detectable in granulosa cells [8]. However, using immunocytochemistry, strong staining for TGFbetaRII has been observed in granulosa cells with no to little staining in oocytes and in the theca in other species [13,32,35-37]. The reasons for these observed differences in localization of the TGFbetaRII are uncertain but may be due to differences in techniques or species differences.

Expression of mRNA encoding all three TGF-beta isoforms and the TGF-beta type I and II receptors were observed in cells associated with blood vessels and both receptor types and TGF-beta1 and 2 mRNAs were observed in the stroma surrounding follicles indicating a potential role for TGF-beta in regulating certain functions in the ovarian stroma and vascular network. TGF-beta is known to be important in regulating angiogenesis [38,39]. Moreover, in the ovary, both TGF-beta1 and TGF-beta3 mRNAs are upregulated during revascularization following autotransplantation of rat ovaries [40] further supporting a role for these factors in regulating vascular function.

The much more restricted pattern of expression of TGFbetaRII mRNA in sheep indicates that the TGFbetaRI may well be involved with other type II receptors in the signalling of other members of the transforming growth factor family. In agreement with this, TGFbetaRI has recently been shown to be involved in signalling of the oocyte-derived GDF-9 along with BMPRII [41,42]. In other species, GDF-9 has been shown to regulate granulosa cell mitosis and differentiation [6] and has been shown to be essential for normal follicular growth and development in both mice [43] and sheep [44,45]. Thus, expression of TGFbetaRI mRNA as well as BMPRII [46,47] in granulosa cells is probably mediating the effects of GDF-9. Localization of both of these receptors in granulosa cells from the type 3 (secondary) stage of development onwards is consistent with the presence of normal primary but not secondary follicles in both sheep [44] and mice [43] lacking biologically active GDF-9. Interestingly, in sheep, TGFbetaRI mRNA and BMPRII [46,47] are also both localized in oocytes from the type 1 (primordial) stage onwards suggesting that GDF-9 may also regulate oocyte function in this species.

The suppression of progesterone production and DNA content in granulosa cell cultures by TGF-beta1 or TGF-beta2 is similar to inhibitory to mild stimulatory effects observed in bovine, ovine and porcine granulosa cell cultures and contrary to the strong stimulatory effects observed in rodents [11,14-18,20-26]. The decreased DNA content observed following treatment accounts for some, but not all, of the decrease observed in progesterone concentration in the granulosa cell cultures. The suppression of progesterone synthesis indicates an anti-differentiative role for this growth factor as has been observed for other members of the TGF-beta superfamily. The decreased content of DNA observed following culture could be related to a suppression of granulosa cell proliferation or survival. Since TGF-beta can stimulate apoptotic pathways in concert with other factors [48,49], a role for TGF-beta in regulating apoptosis of ovarian cells has been proposed.

No differences in the efficacy of TGF-beta1 and TGF-beta2 were observed in ovine granulosa cells. Similarly, TGF-beta1 and TGF-beta2 were equally efficacious in stimulating inhibin production in luteinized human granulosa cells [50] and in modulating gonadotrophin receptor expression in both rat and porcine granulosa cells [51]. Interestingly, while both TGF-beta1 and TGF-beta2 mRNA were synthesized by the theca interna, their spatial patterning within the theca was quite different. TGF-beta1 mRNA was concentrated in the thecal cells closest to the basement membrane, similar to the localization observed for the TGFbetaRII mRNA. In contrast, TGF-beta2 mRNA expression was observed throughout the thecal layer. The role, if any, of the apparent differential regulation of these two isoforms in subtypes of thecal cells is currently unknown.

Given the potent effects of both TGF-beta1 and TGF-beta2 on granulosa cell function in vitro, the lack of detectable expression of TGFbetaRII mRNA in these cells using in situ hybridization was very surprising. There are several potential explanations for these apparent conflicting results. It is possible that TGFbetaRII is expressed in ovine granulosa cells and the technique utilized simply failed to detect this message. The detection of mRNA encoding TGFbetaRII in isolated granulosa cells both before and after culture using RT-PCR would seem to support this assumption. However, it is possible that the isolation and culture of the granulosa cells potentially could be inducing expression of TGFbetaRII as most all cells in culture express TGFbetaRII [52]. In addition, strong expression of TGFbetaRII mRNA in luteal tissue is also consistent with up regulation of the TGFbetaRII in these cells as induction of progesterone synthesis by the ovine granulosa cells can be considered to indicate at least a partial luteinization of these cells. Finally, it is also possible that TGFbetas are using another member of the type II receptor family to mediate their effects. The existence of a second type II receptor capable of mediating TGF-beta effects is supported by the inability of cell lines expressing TGFbetaRII to bind to TGFbeta2 but not TGFbeta1 [53] and cell lines responsive to TGF-beta without a detectible type II TGFbetaR [52].

Expression of mRNAs encoding TGF-beta1 and TGF-beta2 as well as both type I and II TGF-beta receptors were observed in the theca of small growing follicles indicating that TGF-betas may be regulating thecal cell function in an autocrine manner. Expression of mRNA encoding TGF-beta type I and II receptors is also observed in luteal cells, stroma, the vascular system and surface epithelium suggesting that TGF-betas may also regulate other cell types in the sheep ovary. Since granulosa cells showed no evidence of expressing any of the TGF-beta ligands and expression of the TGF-beta type II receptor was equivocal, it seems likely that any TGF-beta effects in granulosa cells in vivo are due to paracrine or endocrine actions and possibly regulated through an alternative type II receptor.
