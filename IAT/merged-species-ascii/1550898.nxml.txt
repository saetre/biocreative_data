The use of moderate hypothermia during experimental cardiac surgery is associated with decreased expression of tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha in myocardium and with myocardial protection. In order to identify the cellular mechanisms that lead to that repression, we investigated the effect of hypothermia during cardiac surgery on both main signalling pathways involved in systemic inflammation, namely the nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) and activating protein-1 pathways.

Twelve female pigs were randomly subjected to standardized cardiopulmonary bypass with moderate hypothermia or normothermia (temperature 28degreesC and 37degreesC, respectively; six pigs in each group). Myocardial probes were sampled from the right ventricle before, during and 6 hours after bypass. We detected mRNA encoding TNF-alpha by competitive RT-PCR and measured protein levels of TNF-alpha, inducible nitric oxide synthase and cyclo-oxygenase-2 by Western blotting. Finally, we assessed the activation of NF-kappaB and activating protein-1, as well as phosphorylation of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase by electrophoretic mobility shift assay with super shift and/or Western blot.

Results

###begin p 7
During and after cardiac surgery, animals subjected to hypothermia exhibited lower expression of TNF-alpha and cyclo-oxygenase-2 but not of inducible nitric oxide synthase. This was associated with lower activation of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase and of its downstream effector activating protein-1 in hypothermic animals. In contrast, NF-kappaB activity was no different between groups.

Conclusion
###end title 8
###begin p 9
These findings indicate that the repression of TNF-alpha associated with moderate hypothermia during cardiac surgery is associated with inhibition of the mitogen-activated protein kinase p38/activating protein-1 pathway and not with inhibition of NF-kappaB. The use of moderate hypothermia during cardiac surgery may mitigate the perioperative systemic inflammatory response and its complications.

Myocardial damage is an important complication of cardiac surgery involving cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) [1]. Synthesis of tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha in the myocardium is thought to play a central role in its pathophysiology [2,3]. Indeed, there is a large body of evidence that, in experimental models, over-expression of TNF-alpha in the myocardium is related to adverse cardiac effects such as postinfarct remodelling and ventricular dilatation [4], transition from hypertrophic to dilated cardiomyopathy due to apoptosis [5] and impaired postischaemic functional recovery [6]. Additionally, local administration of soluble TNF-alpha receptor-1 gene reduced infarct size in a model of ischaemia/reperfusion injury [7]. In a study conducted in a neonatal model of ischaemia of the hypertrophied left ventricle, inhibition of the biological activity of TNF-alpha significantly improved postischaemic contractile function, myocardial energetics and intracellular calcium handing [8]. In humans there is a clear relationship between TNF-alpha expression in the myocardium and the severity of dilated cardiomyopathy [9,10].

The nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) family of nuclear transcription factors is critical for the synthesis of TNF-alpha and for TNF-alpha induced secondary mediators of inflammation, such as inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and cyclo-oxygenase (COX)-2 [11]. Inflammatory stimuli lead to activation of NF-kappaB by inducing the phosphorylation of its inhibitory protein IkappaB, allowing its translocation into the nucleus [11-13]. Activating protein (AP)-1 is another major transcription factor for many inflammatory mediators, including TNF-alpha. It comprises a family of related transcription factors, consisting of heterodimers and homodimers of Jun, Fos and activating transcription factor [14]. AP-1 activity is regulated through interactions with extracellular and intracellular signals including p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), with phosphorylation of activating transcription factor-2 [14], which leads to expression of TNF-alpha [15].

Upon activation of NF-kappaB and AP-1 by inflammatory stimuli, expression of inflammatory genes such as that encoding TNF-alpha and of proinflammatory enzymes such as iNOS and COX-2 takes place. In the myocardium, activation of NF-kappaB, p38 MAPK and AP-1 causes myocardial cell damage resulting from TNF-alpha production [16-18] and it contributes to perfusion maldistribution and to myocardial damage by nitric oxide and eicosanoids, caused by the activity of iNOS and COX-2, respectively [19].

Our previous experimental studies showed that moderate hypothermia during cardiac surgery involving CPB is related to repression of TNF-alpha, and that this is related to increased synthesis of interleukin-10 in myocardium [2,20]. In the present study we investigated the signalling pathways involved in this repression and found that the use of moderate hypothermia is associated with the inhibition of the p38-MAPK/AP-1 pathway but not with inhibition of the NF-kappaB pathway.

The study was approved by the supervising state agency for animal experiments. Twelve stress-resistant female pigs (deutsche Landrasse) weighing 40.3 +/- 1.4 kg (mean +/- standard deviation) were included. The animals were housed in the institute for animal experimentation located in our university hospital for at least 8 days before experiments were begun; this was to guarantee quiet care before scheduled cardiac surgery. After clinical veterinary examination was conducted, which confirmed that the animals were in good health, the pigs were randomly assigned to a temperature group during CPB (six pigs in each group): moderate hypothermia (28degreesC) and normothermia (37degreesC). Core temperature was monitored using an oesophageal probe (probe 1651; Datex-Ohmeda Division, Instrumentarium Corp., Helsinki, Finland).

General anaesthesia, and operative and CPB technique were as previously described [2]. Briefly, following sternotomy, cephotiam (50 mg/kg intravenously) and heparin were administered, and both caval veins, the aorta and the left atrium were cannulated and total CPB instituted for 120 minutes in all animals. This included 30 minutes perfusion during which animals subjected to moderate hypothermia during the operation were cooled down to 28degreesC; 60 minutes of perfusion during which the aorta was cross-clamped and right atriotomy performed; and 30 minutes of perfusion during which pigs undergoing hypothermic CPB were rewarmed to 37degreesC. In animals subjected to normothermia during the operation, perfusion was performed at 37degreesC for the 120 minutes. CPB was conducted with a flow index of 2.7 l/(minute. m2 body surface area) in all animals, with a target mean systemic arterial pressure of 60 mmHg. Immediately after aortic cross-clamping, cardioplegia was achieved by a single injection of cold (4degreesC) cardioplegic solution (Bretschneider solution; 30 ml/kg) into the aortic root. Additional topical cooling of the myocardium was performed by application of 500 ml cold (4degreesC) saline solution. Myocardial temperature during CPB was monitored using a needle probe placed into the ventricular septum (Temperature Sensing Catheter; Medtronic Hemotec. Inc, Englewood, CO, USA). At the end of CPB, anticoagulation was reversed with protamine, mediastinal drains were placed and the chest was closed.

The lungs of the pigs were mechanically ventilated until the end of the experiment. Postoperative monitoring included continuous registration of heart rate and rhythm, mean arterial blood pressure, left atrial pressure, oesophageal temperature and urine output, and measurement of arterial lactate levels and blood gases. Animals received dopamine and Ringer's lactate to optimize hemodynamics. Six hours after sternal closure the pigs were killed by phenobarbital overdose.

Total RNA was extracted using Rneasy Mini Kit (QIAGEN Inc., Hilden, Germany). RNA (3 mug) was reverse transcribed to cDNA using random hexamers. Using specific porcine primers for TNF-alpha and beta-actin, cDNA products were coamplified by PCR as previously reported [2]. The PCR products were subjected to electrophoresis in 1.8% agarose gel, stained with ethidium bromide and photographed. The predicted lengths of amplification products for TNF-alpha and beta-actin were 372 and 233 base pairs, respectively. Results are presented as ratio of band intensities of the mRNA of TNF-alpha to the corresponding beta-actin mRNA (Quantity One(R) Quantification software 4.1; Bio-Rad: BioRad Laboratories, Inc., Hercules, CA, USA).

Nuclear extracts were prepared as previously described [21]. Protein concentrations were determined using a Bio-Rad protein assay. The electrophoretic mobility shift assay was performed using a double-stranded 32P-labelled mutated sis-inducible element oligonucleotide from NF-kappaB (5'-AGT TGA GGG GAC TTT CC-3') and using a double-stranded 32P-labelled consensus oligonucleotide from AP-1 (5'-CGC TTG ATG ACT CAG CCG GAA-3'; both MWG-Biotech AG, Ebersberg, Germany). For supershift assays, nuclear extracts were incubated with antibodies against NF-kappaB p50 and NF-kappaB p65 subunits and AP-1 c-Jun subunit (all polyclonal rabbit anti-human; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) for 30 minutes at room temperature before addition of the radiolabelled probe. The protein/DNA complexes were separated on a 6% polyacrylamide gel containing 7.5% glycerol in 0.25-fold tuberculin bacillary emulsion (20 mmol/l Tris, 20 mmol/l boric acid, 0.5 mmol/l EDTA) at 210 V for 3 hours. Gels were dried and autoradiographed. Positive controls for AP-1 were performed on human HepG2 stimulated by TNF-alpha 10 ng/ml for 4 hours.

There was no TNF-alpha expression before institution of CPB; however, there was expression 30 min after establishing CPB and before cross-clamping of the aorta. At that time, both TNF-alpha gene expression and TNF-alpha concentrations tended to be lower in pigs operated on under moderate hypothermia than in the other animals (Figure 1a,b). Six hours after CPB, concentrations of TNF-alpha were lower in animals operated on under moderate hypothermia than in the others (P < 0.05; Figure 1a,b).

There was weak DNA binding activity of NF-kappaB before CPB that increased during and after CPB similarly in both animal groups (Table 2). The supershift experiment showed that the NF-kappaB DNA binding complex containing p50 and p65 was already present before CPB (Figure 2a,b). Phosphorylation of IkappaB-alpha in the myocardium paralleled DNA binding activity of NF-kappaB before, during and after CPB in both animal groups (Table 2).

There was weak phosphorylation of p38 MAPK before CPB in all animals. In those operated on under hypothermia, levels of phospho-p38 MAPK were lower during and after CPB than in animals operated on under normothermic conditions. In the latter animals, levels of phospho-p38 MAPK increased as soon as 30 minutes after CPB was established and reached a peak value just before removal of the aortic clamp (1 hour after ischaemia), and then decreased by 6 hours after CPB. Animals operated on under hypothermia exhibited lower levels of phospho-p38 MAPK 30 minutes after establishing CPB as compared with the other animals (P < 0.05; Figure 3a). Levels of phospho-c-Jun detected in the nuclear extract paralleled the activation of p38 MAPK in all animals during CPB, but continued to increase after CPB exclusively in those subjected to normothermia. In the other animals, levels of phospho-c-Jun were lower after removal of the aortic clamp and 6 hours after CPB (P < 0.05; Figure 3b).

In animals operated on under hypothermia, AP-1 activity was lower during and after CPB than in those operated on under normothermia. In these latter animals, the DNA binding activity of AP-1 increased as soon as 30 minutes after CPB was established, remaining elevated for up to 6 hours after CPB (Figure 4a). Animals operated on under hypothermia exhibited lower DNA binding activity of AP-1 during and after CPB as compared with the others (P < 0.05 and P < 0.005, respectively; Figure 4a). The supershift experiment revealed that the AP-1 DNA binding complex containing c-Jun was present before and persisted during and after CPB (Figure 4b).

In previous studies we reported that animals operated on under moderate hypothermic CPB have lower plasma levels and lower myocardial concentrations of TNF-alpha as well as less organ damage than do animals operated on under normothermic conditions [2,20]. In the present study we found that the anti-inflammatory effects of moderate hypothermia with repression of TNF-alpha and of its secondary mediator COX-2 are present as early as 30 minutes after initiation of CPB. This observation is supported by other investigators [22], who reported repression of TNF-alpha by hypothermia during ischaemia and early reperfusion periods in the liver.

The main aim of this work was to identify the upstream mechanisms that regulate the expression of TNF-alpha and COX-2, levels of which appear to be reduced by hypothermia. We therefore investigated both of the main signalling pathways involved in the expression of inflammatory mediators, namely the NF-kappaB [11] and AP-1 [23] pathways, and observed a differential effect of hypothermia on those transcription factors. Indeed, although in our series hypothermia led to reductions in phosphorylation of p38 MAPK and AP-1 activation, it did not affect activation of NF-kappaB in the myocardium. This confirms our previous work showing that hypothermia does not inhibit NF-kappaB activation in liver [21].

The inhibitory effect of hypothermia on p38 MAPK that we report here is supported by experimental work conducted in rat fibroblasts that showed inhibition of Raf [24], a mitogen-stimulated protein kinase that is an important intermediate to p38 MAPK activation by cold stress [25]. Via inhibition of Raf, hypothermia suppresses the phosphorylation of p38 MAPK in vitro, thereby inhibiting phosphorylation of c-Jun and AP-1 activation [22].

Regulation of the activity of AP-1 occurs at two levels, depending on its concentrations and on the level of its phosphorylation [26]. In the present study, there was no difference in levels of c-Jun in nuclear extract between the groups, but animals operated on in hypothermia exhibited lower phosphorylation of c-Jun and lower DNA binding activity of AP-1 during and after CPB than did those operated on in normothermia. Therefore, we suggest that hypothermia during CPB inhibits phosphorylation of p38 MAPK, which in turn suppresses its nuclear targets, namely phosphorylation of c-Jun and activation of the transcription factor AP-1.

The clinical relevance of NF-kappaB and p38 MAPK/AP-1 activation in myocardium has been pointed out by several studies suggesting that both pathways are important actors in the failing heart [18,27]. NF-kappaB plays a central role in the myocardial inflammatory response, including TNF-alpha secretion by cardiomyocytes in response to systemic endotoxin [28]. However, NF-kappaB activation is also necessary for later preconditioning of the myocardium, and thus a potential role of this transcription factor for myocardial protection has been suggested [11]. The important role played by p38 MAPK/AP-1 in the myocardial inflammatory response is widely recognized [18,23]. Indeed, p38 MAPK activation is sufficient to induce inflammatory cytokine expression including TNF-alpha in cardiomyocytes in vitro and in vivo [18]. A recent study [18] showed that the inhibition of p38 MAPK activities blocks TNF-alpha secretion in transgenic hearts. The congruency of the effect of moderate hypothermia on phosphorylation of p38 MAPK and activity of AP-1, and on expression of TNF-alpha suggests that, in our model, moderate hypothermia during CPB represses the expression of TNF-alpha in the myocardium by selective inhibition of the p38 MAPK/AP-1 pathway.

In a similar in vivo model, we previously showed that hypothermia during CPB confers myocardial protection by inhibiting intramyocardial expression of TNF-alpha [2,20]. Cardiodepressive effects of TNF-alpha have been ascribed to immediate negative inotropic effects on cardiomyocytes mediated by sphyngosine, independent of NO, and to delayed NO-dependent negative inotropic effects [29]. High local concentrations of NO related to induction of iNOS are associated with myocardial cell damage and cell death [30]. In the present study, hypothermia during CPB did not inhibit synthesis of iNOS in myocardium despite repression of TNF-alpha. That expression of iNOS in cultured cardiac myocytes does not increase in response to TNF-alpha and that TNF-alpha does not influence iNOS mRNA expression and NO release in the isolated rat heart [31-33] supports our observation. In addition, endotoxin-induced TNF-alpha depresses myocardial contractility of isolated rat hearts independent of NO synthesis [34].

COX-2 is upregulated by various factors, including TNF-alpha, via the transcription factors NF-kappaB and AP-1 [11,35]. The latter is the major promotor element involved in COX-2 expression in cardiomyocytes [36]. Significant expression of COX-2 has been demonstrated in the myocardium of patients with congestive heart failure and in rat heart after treatment with endotoxin [37,38]. In our series expression of COX-2 paralleled the expression of TNF-alpha and activation of AP-1 during and after CPB, suggesting that COX-2 expression was mediated by TNF-alpha through AP-1. Myocardial depression in isolated rat hearts in response to staphylococcal alpha-toxin results from COX-2 derived thromboxane A2 liberation, leading to coronary vasconstriction and perfusion mismatch [39,40]. In the present study, animals operated on under hypothermia did not differ from the other animals with respect to haemodynamics, but the fact that they had lower levels of lactate than did the pigs operated on under normothermia indicates that they had better tissue perfusion.

Activation of p38 MAPK and c-Jun: hypothermia versus normothermia. Shown is activation of p38 MAPK (phospho-p38 MAPK) and c-Jun (phospho-c-Jun) in myocardium of pigs operated on under moderate hypothermia (28degreesC; circles) or under normothermia (37degreesC; squares). The time points of evaluation were as follows: 1 = before CPB; 2 = before aortic cross clamping; 3 = before removal of aortic clamp; and 4 = 6 hours after CPB. (a) In the upper panel, showing phospho-p38 MAPK findings, results are given as mean +/- standard deviation. *P < 0.05. Band intensities for phospho-p38 MAPK were normalized for band intensities of total p38 MAPK. Lower panel: gel showing the effect of temperature on myocardial expression of phospho-p38 MAPK detected by Western blot. Results are representative of six independent experiments in each group. (b) In the upper panel, showing phospho-c-Jun findings, results are given as mean +/- standard deviation. *P < 0.02. Band intensities for phospho-c-Jun were normalized for band intensities of actin. Lower panel: gel showing the effect of temperature on expression of phospho-c-Jun in the nuclear extract detected by Western blot. Results are representative of four independent experiments in each group (28degreesC = moderate hypothermia; 37degreesC = normothermia). CPB, cardiopulmonary bypass; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase.

DNA binding activity of AP-1: hypothermia versus normothermia. (a) DNA-binding activity of AP-1, as measured by EMSA and confirmed by supershift in the myocardium, in pigs operated on under moderate hypothermia (28degreesC; circles) or normothermia (37degreesC; squares). The time points of evaluation were as follows: 1 = before CPB; 2 = before aortic cross clamping; 3 = before removal of aortic clamp; and 4 = 6 hours after CPB. Data are expressed as mean +/- standard deviation. section signP < 0.1, **P < 0.05, versus prebypass value in normothermia group; section signP < 0.1, *P < 0.05 between both groups. (b) Example gel showing the effect of temperature during CPB on activation of AP-1, as detected by EMSA and confirmed by supershift, with anti-c-Jun antibody in pigs operated on under hypothermia (28degreesC) or normothermia (37degreesC). Results are representative of four independent experiments in each group. AP, activating protein; CNT, count/mm2; CPB, cardiopulmonary bypass; EMSA, electrophoretic mobility shift assay; NS, nonspecific; PC, positive control.
