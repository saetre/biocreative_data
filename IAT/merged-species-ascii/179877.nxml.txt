Nuclear receptors (NRs) usually bind the corepressors N-CoR and SMRT in the absence of ligand or in the presence of antagonists. Agonist binding leads to corepressor release and recruitment of coactivators. Here, we report that estrogen receptor beta (ERbeta) binds N-CoR and SMRT in the presence of agonists, but not antagonists, in vitro and in vivo. This ligand preference differs from that of ERalpha interactions with corepressors, which are inhibited by estradiol, and resembles that of ERbeta interactions with coactivators. ERbeta /N-CoR interactions involve ERbeta AF-2, which also mediates coactivator recognition. Moreover, ERbeta recognizes a sequence (PLTIRML) in the N-CoR C-terminus that resembles coactivator LXXLL motifs. Inhibition of histone deacetylase activity specifically potentiates ERbeta LBD activity, suggesting that corepressors restrict the activity of AF-2. We conclude that the ER isoforms show completely distinct modes of interaction with a physiologically important corepressor and discuss our results in terms of ER isoform specificity in vivo.

The nuclear receptor (NR) family comprises 48 structurally related transcription factors, many of which require their cognate ligand for activity [1-3]. The NRs regulate transcription by binding to response elements in the promoters of target genes and acting as scaffolds for the assembly of large coactivator and corepressor complexes [4]. NR coactivators include the p160s (including GRIP1/TIF-2, SRC-1 and AIB1/ACTR/pCIP). The p160s enhance transcription by binding histone acetyl-transferases such as p300/CBP and pCAF [5]and methyl-transferases such as CARM1 and PRMT [6] which, in turn, enhance transcription by modification of chromatin. Other NR coactivators include TRAP220[7], which is part of a larger complex (TRAP/DRIP/SMCC/mediator) that contacts the basal transcription machinery and PGC-1[8], a cold inducible coactivator that binds CBP and SRC-1 and proteins involved in RNA processing [9]. NR corepressors include NR corepressor (N-CoR) and silencing mediator of retinoid and thyroid responsive transcription (SMRT) [4]. Both N-CoR and SMRT repress transcription, at least in part, by binding to histone de-acetylases (HDACs) either directly or indirectly through other corepressor complex components. Other known NR corepressors include RIP140 [10], Hairless [11], short heterodimer partner (SHP) [12] and DAX [13], and receptor specific corepressors such as the estrogen receptor (ER) interacting proteins REA and HET-SAFB [14,15].

Generally, NR transcriptional activity is dictated by the balance between coactivator and corepressor recruitment, and one of the most important factors that influences this balance is the absence or presence of agonist ligands (reviewed in [4]). Unliganded NRs such as thyroid (TRs) and retinoid receptors (RARs) bind corepressors, and ligand promotes release of corepressor and subsequent binding of coactivators. The mechanism of this coregulator exchange is well understood. NRs consist of three domains, the N-terminal domain (which contains a context-specific activation function AF-1), the central DNA binding domain (DBD) and the C-terminal ligand binding domain (LBD), which contains a hormone-dependent activation function, AF-2. The unliganded LBD recognizes hydrophobic motifs, termed interaction domains (IDs), which are reiterated three times in N-CoR and twice in SMRT and conform to the consensus L/IXXIIXXXL [4](see also[16]). By contrast, the liganded LBD binds shorter hydrophobic motifs termed NR boxes that are reiterated several times within each coactivator and conform to the consensus LXXLL. The LBD utilizes a large hydrophobic cleft composed of residues along H3 and H5 to bind IDs [17], and a smaller hydrophobic cleft that is composed of residues in the upper part of H3 and H5 and H12 (and corresponds to AF-2) to bind NR boxes [18]. Thus, agonists promote coregulator exchange by promoting the packing of H12 over the lower part of the ID binding region, an event that simultaneously completes the coactivator binding surface. In other cases, however, the balance of coactivator and corepressor recruitment is regulated by direct competition for the AF-2 surface, rather than ligand-dependent coregulator exchange. RIP140, Hairless and DAX possess NR boxes that interact with AF-2 [11,13,19] and these corepressors act as negative regulators of the activity of the liganded NR.

The NR family contains two related ERs (ERalpha and ERbeta) that conform to the typical three domain NR structure and share extensive sequence homology in the DBD and LBD region[20,21]. Analysis of the function of the individual ERs in mouse knockout models suggests that the major proliferative effects of estrogen are mediated by ERalpha and not by ERbeta, which seems to play an inhibitory role in proliferation in some studies[22,23]. The ligand-binding properties of the ERs are different, with ERbeta often exhibiting stronger binding to plant-derived phytoestrogens [24]. More importantly, the ERs exhibit isoform-specific effects on gene expression. Both ERs enhance transcription from genes with classical estrogen response elements (EREs), but ERalpha requires less ligand to obtain maximal activation than ERbeta [25,26]. Likewise, both ERs suppress the activity of the TNFalpha promoter in response to estrogens, but ERbeta is a more potent repressor than ERalpha [27]. However, some of the most striking isoform-specific differences in gene regulation are observed at promoters, such as that of cyclin D1, which contain AP-1 sites or related cyclic AMP response elements (CREs). ERalpha enhances AP-1 activity in response to estrogens, [28,29] but ERbeta inhibits AP-1 activity in response to estrogens [29-31]. ERbeta also completely suppresses ERalpha activity at the cyclin D1 promoter and even suppresses the activity of an ERalpha mutant that is selectively superactive at AP-1 sites and CREs [29]. Finally, ERbeta shows a unique capacity to enhance AP-1 activity in response to selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs) such as raloxifene, tamoxifen and ICI 182,780/Faslodex (ICI) [30-32]. Together, these observations suggest that there are fundamental differences in the way that the ERs bind unspecified cofactors that modulate gene expression, and that some of these cofactors must play a role in differential ER activity at AP-1 sites.

Although the poorly conserved NTD region clearly plays an important role in isoform-specificity [32,33], it is also likely that there are differences in the better conserved LBD region that contribute to differential ERalpha and ERbeta activities. Phage display techniques have revealed that ERalpha and ERbeta show different preferences in LXXLL binding (reviewed in [34,35]). Moreover, some cofactors that contain LXXLL motifs show differential binding to LBDs of the ER isoforms (reviewed in [36]). SHP binds ERalpha preferentially [37], and represses ERalpha activity more strongly than that of ERbeta. The PGC-1 related protein PERC also binds ERalpha preferentially, and potentiates ERalpha activity more strongly than that of ERbeta [38]. We recently observed that ERalpha binds the C-terminal NR interacting regions of N-CoR and SMRT in the presence of SERMs but not estrogens [39]. In this study, we report that ERbeta interactions with N-CoR and SMRT are promoted by agonists and inhibited by SERMs. Thus, the ERs show completely opposite ligand preferences of interaction with corepressors. We discuss the potential significance of these different modes of ER interaction with N-CoR in terms of known isoform-specific behaviors.

To investigate ERbeta interactions with corepressors, we examined the interactions of full length ERbeta (amino acids 1-530) with bacterially expressed C-terminal NR interacting domain of N-CoR (amino acids 1944-2453) in vitro (Fig. 1A). Fig. 1B reveals, surprisingly, that ERbeta bound N-CoR in the absence of hormone and in the presence of agonist ligands (E2, DES) and phytoestrogens (genistein, coumestrol). Moreover, these interactions were suppressed by SERMs (ICI, raloxifene and tamoxifen). ERbeta bound to the coactivator GRIP1 more strongly than N-CoR, but did so with an identical ligand preference. Similar agonist-dependent interactions could be observed between ERbeta and the alternate NR corepressor SMRT in vitro (Fig. 1C). Control binding experiments performed in parallel confirmed that ERalpha bound to N-CoR in the presence of SERMs, and not estradiol (Fig. 1D) and that TRbeta bound N-CoR in the absence of hormone, and was released in the presence of T3, whereas TRbeta only bound GRIP1 in the presence of T3 (Fig. 1E).

To examine interactions between ERbeta and N-CoR in mammalian cells we performed two-hybrid assays using a GAL4 DBD/N-CoR C-terminus fusion protein as bait and a VP16-ERbeta LBD fusion as the prey. Fig. 2 shows that the ERbeta-LBD bound N-CoR in the presence of agonists and phytoestrogens, but not SERMs. Control two-hybrid assays confirmed that a VP16-TRbeta LBD fusion protein bound N-CoR in the absence of hormone, but not in the presence of T3. E2 dependent binding of ERbeta to N-CoR was dose dependent (Fig. 2B) with an EC50 (0.3 nM) that resembled that of ERbeta binding to the GRIP1 NR box region (amino acids 610-770). Thus, ERbeta binds the N-CoR C-terminal NR interacting region in the presence of agonists, but not SERMs, and does so in vitro and in mammalian cells. Moreover, results from the two-hybrid assay indicate that the ERbeta LBD is sufficient to obtain estrogen-dependent interactions with N-CoR.

Unliganded NRs usually bind ID motifs (consensus L/IXXIIXXXL) in the N-CoR C-terminus. To ask whether ERbeta might bind these motifs in the presence of estradiol, we examined the ability of peptides containing known NR interacting motifs to compete for the interaction (Fig. 3A). A peptide overlapping to the N-CoR ID1 motif (amino acids 2265-2291) that competes for N-CoR binding to unliganded TR and RAR [16]failed to compete for agonist-dependent ERbeta interactions with N-CoR. By contrast, a peptide corresponding to GRIP1 NR box 2 did compete for this interaction [40,41]. This finding suggests that agonist-bound ERbeta does not recognize ID motifs, and that ERbeta interactions with N-CoR more closely resemble those with GRIP1.

ERbeta AF-2 is required for Corepressor and Coactivator Binding. (A) Peptide competition for ERbeta binding to cofactors. Binding of ERbeta to GST-N-CoR was assessed in the presence of 10mug of designated competitor peptide. (B) Binding of VP16-ERbeta LBD mutants to Gal-N-CoR and Gal-GRIP1 was analyzed. Luciferase activity obtained with Gal-fusion and VP16-ERbeta in the presence of estradiol (100 nM) over four experiments was corrected for background and set to 100%. Activity obtained with ERbeta mutants was compared to this value. Standard errors are shown.

NR interactions with N-CoR are usually mediated by a hydrophobic cleft that spans residues from H3 and H5 and includes residues that lie under H12 in the liganded configuration [4,17]. These interactions are either independent of, or inhibited by, NR H12 [17,39,42]. By contrast, NR interactions with coactivators are mediated by residues from the upper part of H3-H5 and also require H12 itself [18]. Fig. 3B shows that a mutation in a conserved residue on H12 that is required for coactivator binding (E493K) abolished the interaction of ERbeta with both N-CoR and GRIP1. Moreover, other mutations in the upper part of the H3-H5 region that comprises the AF-2 surface (D303Y, I310R and K314A on H3; V328R and L331R on H5) abolished ERbeta interaction with both cofactors. Control mutations in other regions of the ERbeta surface left its interactions with N-CoR and GRIP1 either slightly reduced or intact (these are L301R at the base of H3, V361R in the S-bends, M379R in H8; L426R, T434R in the H10 and Y488S in the H11-H12 loop). Thus, ERbeta interactions with N-CoR are dependent on the AF-2 surface (including H12) and, in this regard, resemble those of ERbeta and GRIP1.

To map the region of N-CoR that interacted with ERbeta, we examined ERbeta binding to a series of rationally designed smaller fragments of the N-CoR C-terminus (Fig. 4). ERbeta did not bind two of these smaller fragments of N-CoR (1944-2033; 2230-2322) that contain known ID motifs (IDs 3 and 1 [16]). ERbeta bound weakly to two regions of N-CoR (2033-2123; 2123-2230), one of which (2033-2123) contains an ID motif (ID2), but did so in a ligand-independent fashion. However, ERbeta did bind to a fragment that spanned the extreme C-terminus (2322-2453) and did so in a manner that was promoted by E2 and suppressed by ICI, much like the interactions of ERbeta with the entire N-CoR nuclear receptor interacting region.

ERbeta binds the N-CoR C-terminus. Binding of ERbeta to short bacterially produced GST-N-CoR fragments was assessed as in Fig. 1B. The approximate positions of N-CoR IDs are indicated with black bars, the putative ERbeta interacting motif with a grey bar. Note that all of the binding experiments with shorter N-CoR fragments were performed in parallel, and are compared to the same input ERbeta protein (10% of total) displayed alongside the 1944-2033 fragment. A binding experiment that was performed in parallel utilizing the entire GST-N-CoR C-terminus (1944-2453) is shown for comparison at top. The likely reasons that ERbeta binding to the shorter N-CoR fragment (2322-2453) is stronger than that obtained with the intact N-CoR C-terminus are discussed in the text.

The interaction of ERbeta with the small N-CoR C-terminal fragment (amino acids 2322-2453) was stronger than that observed with the intact C-terminus (amino acids 1944-2453). This apparently improved binding is likely to be a consequence of our methodology (West et al. Unpublished data). In general, expression of large fragments of the N-CoR C-terminus in E. Coli yields a mix of full length protein along with truncated products. To create the expression vectors for the smaller fragments, truncated N-CoR polypeptides that were obtained in E. Coli extracts were subjected to protein sequence analysis and cDNA fragments that coded for the major truncated products were prepared. Each of the resulting polypeptides was expressed very efficiently in E. Coli. The end product that was obtained after GST purification essentially consisted of a single short polypeptide as judged by Coomassie stain. Binding of ERbeta to N-CoR (2322-2453) is probably very efficient for two reasons. First, equal amounts of GST fusion protein were used as baits for the translated ERbeta protein in this series of experiments (3mug per assay). Thus, N-CoR (2322-2453) is present in molar excess over N-CoR (1944-2453). Second, as developed above, preparations of N-CoR (1944-2453) generally contain truncated products, so sequences corresponding to the extreme N-CoR C-terminus (which binds ERbeta) is markedly under-represented. In any case, the fact that ERbeta binds weakly or not at all to the three N-CoR ID motifs that mediate interactions with TRs and RARs and, instead, binds in an agonist-dependent fashion to a region in the C-terminus of N-CoR that has not previously been implicated in NR interactions indicates that ERbeta recognizes a novel protein sequence motif within N-CoR.

The N-CoR C-terminus contains the sequence PLTIRMLS (beta-box, amino acids 2399-2406; Fig. 5). This sequence does not exactly conform to the LXXLL consensus, but contains features (underlined) that resemble the ERbeta H12 region (LLLEML), and artificial ERbeta interacting LXXLL peptides (293, PNLISLLS; D47, PLLLSLLS), both of which bind to the ERbeta AF-2 surface [43-47]. Moreover, the presence of a proline residue amino-terminal to the hydrophobic groups is typical of so-called class II LXXLL motifs which are found in ERbeta interacting cofactors such as TRAP220 and RIP140[45]. Finally, the unusual C-terminal hydrophobic pair (ML) has been observed in ERalpha and ERbeta H12[43,44,48], and in RIP140 NR boxes [19].

We investigated the significance of the beta-box in ERbeta interactions with N-CoR. As Fig. 6A shows, a synthetic beta-box peptide competed for binding to N-CoR, albeit somewhat less efficiently than native GRIP1 NR box 2. Similar results were obtained in competition experiments that used GST-GRIP1 instead of GST-N-CoR (data not shown). The isolated beta-box also acted as bait for a VP16-ERbeta fusion protein in mammalian cells, and did so with similar efficiency to other known ERbeta interacting peptides (Fig. 6B). Finally, mutations within the beta-box (especially M2405A, L2406A) disrupted ERbeta interactions with N-CoR in mammalian two-hybrid assays, but did not affect TRbeta interactions (Fig. 6C). Thus, the beta-box is sufficient to bind ERbeta and is essential for agonist-dependent ERbeta interactions with the N-CoR C-terminus.

Next, we examined whether the beta-box would bind other NRs. The Gal-beta-box fusion failed to recruit the ERalpha, TRbeta or RARbeta LBDs in mammalian two-hybrid assays (Fig. 7A). Moreover, while the beta-box and GRIP1 NR box 2 peptides both competed for ERbeta interactions with GRIP1, only the NR box 2 peptide competed for ERalpha interactions with GRIP1 (Fig. 7B). Thus, the N-CoR beta-box is, at least to some degree, ERbeta specific. Mutation of N-CoR to obtain a beta-box sequence that more closely resembled a conventional LXXLL motif (T2402L) led to enhanced hormone-dependent interactions with ERbeta and permitted novel hormone-dependent interactions with ERalpha (Fig. 7C). Thus, some of the observed ERbeta specificity is probably a consequence of an unexpected ability to tolerate the absence of a leucine residue at the N-terminus of the LXXLL motif. Together, our results indicate that ERbeta has the potential to utilize its AF-2 surface to bind NR boxes within coactivators or an NR box-like sequence in the C-terminus of N-CoR.

Since ERbeta bound N-CoR and SMRT in the presence of estrogens, we investigated the possible involvement of corepressors in the actions of agonist-bound ERbeta in vivo. To perform this experiment, we examined the effect of the HDAC inhibitor trichostatin A (TSA) on ERbeta activity in transiently transfected HeLa cells. Fig. 8A confirms that ERalpha shows stronger transcriptional activity than ERbeta at a simple ERE responsive reporter gene. TSA enhanced the basal activity of the ERE-TK reporter gene by about fifteen-fold in the absence of ER (see inset). However, TSA also equalized the relative transcriptional activity of both ERs. Fig. 8B shows that the isolated ERalpha LBD exhibited more potent transcriptional activity than the ERbeta LBD. However, both LBDs showed similar transcriptional activity in the presence of TSA. Thus, corepressor complex HDACs must play an unspecified role in restricting the transcriptional activity of both ERbeta and, in particular, the ERbeta-LBD. This is consistent with the notion that corepressors restrict the activity of agonist-bound ERbeta-LBD.

NRs generally interact with the corepressors N-CoR and SMRT either in the absence of ligand, or in the presence of receptor antagonists, and agonists promote corepressor release [4]. In this study, we demonstrated that ERbeta binds to N-CoR in the presence of ER agonists such as estradiol and DES and the phytoestrogens genistein and coumestrol, but not in the presence of SERMs. Moreover, this interaction is dependent upon ERbeta AF-2, including H12, and is competed by NR box peptides but not ID peptides. The hormone-dependent component of the ERbeta /N-CoR interaction maps to the extreme C-terminus of N-CoR, which has not been previously implicated in NR interactions, and requires a sequence that resembles an ERbeta-specific NR box (PLTIRMLS, beta-box). In this regard, ERbeta differs from ERalpha, which probably binds ID motifs in a SERM-dependent fashion [49,50] and shows reduced binding to N-CoR in the presence of estradiol [39]. ERbeta also differs from many other NRs, which either bind N-CoR in the absence of ligand and are released in the presence of ligand or interact with N-CoR in the presence of antagonists but not agonists [4].

The fact that the mode of ERbeta interaction with N-CoR resembles that of NRs with coactivators [4], or with corepressors that modulate the activity of liganded NR complexes, such as RIP140 [10], raises the possibility that ERbeta may be able to recruit N-CoR and SMRT to estrogen-regulated promoters in response to agonists and that the balance of overall ERbeta activity in the presence of estrogens may be regulated by competition between p160s and corepressors for the same ERbeta AF-2 surface. We recognize that our studies do not directly address this issue. Our attempts to identify ERbeta mutants that differentiate between GRIP1 and N-CoR binding to analyze the role of agonist-dependent corepressor binding have not yet been successful (probably because ERbeta utilizes the same surface to bind both cofactors). Moreover, transfection of N-CoR or various mutated N-CoR derivatives did not significantly affect ERbeta activity at EREs or AP-1 sites (data not shown). We do not understand why, but in our hands, transfected N-CoR also fails to affect TR or ERalpha activity (data not shown), despite the fact that it clearly interacts with both NRs. Nevertheless, we suspect that estrogen-dependent N-CoR binding may represent an important component of the regulation of ERbeta activity. As described in the Introduction, ERalpha and ERbeta must interact differentially with factors that modulate ER activity in the presence of estrogens. The finding that estrogens suppress N-CoR binding to ERalpha [39], but promote N-CoR binding to ERbeta represents the first demonstration of a corepressor that shows completely distinct modes of hormone-dependent interaction with the ER isoforms. Thus, N-CoR and SMRT and their associated HDACs are excellent candidates to explain some of the differential behaviors of the ER isoforms. Consistent with this notion, the apparent weak transcriptional activity of the ERbeta LBD is a consequence of corepressor HDAC activity at some level (Fig. 8). Full verification of the importance of ERbeta interaction with N-CoR will await demonstration that ERbeta recruits N-CoR and SMRT to estrogen-regulated promoters in vivo, and that this event is related to modulation of estrogen response.

While the ER isoforms have contrasting effects on AP-1 activity in the presence of estrogens, ERalpha truncations that lack the NTD and ERbeta both enhance AP-1 activity in the presence of SERMs [30,31]. Mutational analysis of ERalpha action at AP-1 sites suggests these effects may be related to N-CoR binding [39], and we have proposed that SERM action at AP-1 sites may therefore involve contacts with corepressors [31,51]. The fact that ERalpha and ERbeta show completely different ligand preferences of interaction with N-CoR suggests that the target for SERM activation at AP-1 sites may not be N-CoR in both cases. Thus, this finding complicates our attempts to explain this unusual phenomenon. Perhaps the ER isoforms enhance AP-1 activity by superficially similar mechanisms that involve different cofactors. Alternatively, ERalpha and ERbeta action at AP-1 sites could, in fact, be mediated by SERM-dependent contacts with a common cofactor that is, as yet, unidentified. This common factor may yet prove to be N-CoR if ERbeta interactions with the beta-box were somehow masked in vivo.

What features of the beta-box contribute to ERbeta specificity? Intriguingly, the beta-box contains N-terminal proline and C-terminal serine residues that extend the homology of this region to an artificial ERbeta-specific peptide [45]. However, the beta-box also lacks the first Leu of the consensus LXXLL. A mutation (PLTIRML>PLLIRML) that restores the LXXLL consensus increases ERbeta binding to N-CoR and permits ERalpha to bind to N-CoR in the presence of estrogens in mammalian two-hybrid assays. Thus, the unusual sequence of the beta-box contributes to ERbeta specificity and ERbeta can tolerate the absence of a conserved N-terminal leucine in LXXLL motifs. ERbeta might bind to yet more cofactors that contain variant NR boxes that resemble the beta-box. Other aspects of ERbeta interactions with corepressors warrant further study. It will be interesting to understand whether the weaker ERbeta interactions with other regions of N-CoR (which are insensitive to ICI) play a role in ERbeta binding (Fig. 4). Finally, SMRT also binds ERbeta in the presence of estrogens, but we have not explored the structural features that promote this interaction. Intriguingly, human SMRT contains a sequence insertion at the position of the hydrophobic pair in the N-CoR beta-box, which apparently leads to deletion of both residues (N-CoR/RMLS>SMRT/RLqagvmaS) [52]. Perhaps SMRT contains a different NR interacting motif or the N-CoR NR box sequence may be more complex than we have initially reported here.

The following plasmids (pSG5-ERalpha, pSG5-ERbeta (amino acids 1-530) [31], pGEX-N-CoR and pGEX-SMRT[39], VP16-TRbeta and Gal-N-CoR[16], GST-N-CoR fusions[17], ERE-LUC, GK1/Gal4 responsive reporter and Gal-ERalpha LBD [53], pM-D2, pM-D47, pM-F6[46]) have been previously described. VP16-ERbeta LBD and Gal-ERbeta LBD contain human ERbeta sequences and were gifts from Dr. Dale Leitmann (University of California, San Francisco). VP16-RAR-LBD was a gift from Dr. David Moore, Baylor, Houston, Texas. Gal-GRIP1 NR box (1,2,3) fusion (amino acids 610-770) was prepared by PCR amplification of the appropriate region of GRIP1 (primers obtained from Biomolecular Resource Center, UCSF) containing EcoRI and SalI sites, the PCR fragment was digested with these enzymes and subcloned into the pM GAL4 expression vector (Clontech Laboratories, Inc. Palo Alto, CA). VP16-ERbeta mutations and Gal-N-CoR mutations were prepared using standard PCR-based site directed mutagenesis (Quickchange Kit, Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) and confirmed by sequencing. The GAL4-beta box fusion was prepared by synthesizing oligonucleotides corresponding to the beta-box sequence with engineered EcoRI and SalI restriction sites. Annealed and phosphorylated double stranded oligonucleotide was subcloned into the appropriate sites in the PM vector.

GST-fusions were expressed in E. Coli BL21 [28]. Cultures were grown to OD600 1.5 at room temperatures (approximately 22degreesC) and protein production was initiated by addition of IPTG to 1 mM. After four hours, bacterial pellets were obtained, resuspended in 20 mM HEPES pH 7.9/ 80 mM KCl/6 mM MgCl2/1 mM Dithiothreitol/1 mM ATP/0.2 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and protease inhibitors and sonicated. Debris was pelleted by centrifugation in an ss34 rotor for 1 hour at 12,000 rpm. The supernatant was incubated with glutathione sepharose 4B beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech AB, Uppsala, Sweden) and washed as previously described. Protein preparations were stored at -20degreesC in 20% glycerol.

Labeled ERs were produced using coupled in vitro transcription-translation (TNT kit, Promega, Madison, Wisconsin). Assays were carried out in a volume of 150mul that contained 137.5mul of ice-cold protein binding buffer (PBB) along with 10mul of GST-bead slurry corresponding to 3mug of fusion protein, 1mul of in vitro translated protein and 1.5mul of ligand or vehicle and/or peptides or vehicle. PBB was freshly prepared in 24 ml aliquots composed of 20 ml A-150 (20 mM Hepes, 150 mM KCl, 10 mM MgCl2 and 1% glycerol), and 2 ml each of phosphate buffered saline supplemented, respectively, with 1% Triton X-100 and 1% NP-40. PMSF, DTT, BSA and protease inhibitor cocktail (Novagen) were added to 0.1 mM, 1 mM, 2mug/ml and 1/1000 dilution respectively. The mix was incubated for two hours in the cold room with gentle agitation, the beads were pelleted by spinning briefly on a bench top Eppendorf centrifuge, washed four times with PBB containing no BSA, and the pellet was dried under vacuum for twenty minutes. Labeled protein was subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and autoradiography.

HeLa cells were grown in DME/F-12 Ham's 1:1 mix, without phenol red (Sigma) containing 10% iron supplemented calf serum (Sigma) and pen-strep. Cells were transfected by electroporation [28]. Transfections contained 2mug of luciferase and actin-beta-galactosidase reporters and, where indicated, 1mug of ER, VP16-fusion protein or GAL4-fusion protein expression vectors or empty vector controls. Luciferase and beta-galactosidase activities were measured using luciferase (Promega, Madison, WI) and Galacto-Light assay systems (Tropix, Bedford, MA).
