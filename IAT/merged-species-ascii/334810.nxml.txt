We have isolated a cDNA clone that encodes the Drosophila melanogaster elongation factor 2 (EF2), a protein involved in the elongation step of protein synthesis. This identification was based on the high degree of its amino acid sequence identity (greater than 80%) to that of hamster EF2. The gene encoding Drosophila EF2 is found at position 39E-F of the 2L chromosomal arm and maybe identical to the M(2)H locus, which produces a Minute phenotype when mutated. The genomic organization of the locus includes four exons. Conserved sequence segments shared with a variety of GTP binding proteins are found in the amino terminal third of the protein, and segments unique to EF2 and its prokaryotic functional homolog, EF-G, are in the carboxy terminal half; these two regions are segregated in two respective exons.
