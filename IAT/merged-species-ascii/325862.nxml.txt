The nucleotide sequence of the Escherichia coli glyA gene has been determined. The amino acid sequence predicted from the DNA sequence consists of 417 residues. After the coding region there is a 185 nucleotide sequence preceding the proposed transcription termination region for the glyA gene. This region is preceded by a G-C rich sequence that could form a stable stem-loop structure once transcribed, followed by an A-T rich sequence within which transcription appears to terminate. There is a long region of dyad symmetry and numerous smaller symmetrical regions between the site of translation termination and the proposed transcription termination region. These stem-loop structures show remarkable homology with intercistronic elements of other prokaryotic operons and may play a role in the regulation of glyA gene expression.
