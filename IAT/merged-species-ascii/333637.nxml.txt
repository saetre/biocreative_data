The promoter of the chicken alpha 2(VI) collagen gene reveals several interesting features characteristic of house-keeping genes and growth control related genes. It does not possess a typical TATAA or CAAT box, but it contains several potential binding sites for transcription factors Sp1 and ETF. The 5' flanking region of the gene forms a typical 'CpG island' where the dinucleotide sequence CpG occurs with high frequency relative to the bulk genome. Consistent with the lack of a TATAA element, the gene contains multiple transcription initiation sites distributed over 75 bp of genomic DNA. A short DNA fragment (207 bp) encompassing all the transcription initiation sites and the entire CpG island shows strong promoter activity when linked to a heterologous reporter gene. The upstream region of the promoter harbours a long homopurine/homopyrimidine element (403 bp) which is sensitive to endonuclease S1. This element might have the ability to adopt an intramolecular hairpin triplex structure and could play a role in the organization of the chromatin at the alpha 2(VI) collagen locus. Our results demonstrate that the structure of the alpha 2(VI) collagen promoter is completely different from that of any other collagen promoter characterized so far.
