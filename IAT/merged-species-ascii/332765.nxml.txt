Dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) cDNA sequences were isolated from a methotrexate-resistant mouse L5178Y cell line previously shown to contain methotrexate-resistant dihydrofolate reductase enzyme activity. Specifically-primed reverse transcription products were amplified using the polymerase chain reaction and then cloned into a mammalian expression plasmid. Candidate clones were identified by restriction analysis and then functionally tested by transfection into mouse 3T3 fibroblasts, selecting for methotrexate-resistant colonies. Sequence analysis of the cDNA clones demonstrated the substitution of tryptophan (TGG) in place of the wild-type phenylalanine (TTC) at codon 31. Sequencing of PCR-amplified genomic DNA extracted from the drug-resistant L5178Y cells confirmed the tryptophan codon at position 31. Transfection of mammalian tissue culture cells with expression plasmids containing the trp31 DHFR sequence resulted in substantial methotrexate-resistant colony formation. Recombinant trp31 DHFR enzyme activity expressed in stably-transfected Chinese hamster ovary cells was approximately 20-fold less sensitive to methotrexate inhibition than wild-type mouse DHFR enzyme activity. We conclude that the cloned Trp31 DHFR sequence encodes an enzyme substantially resistant to methotrexate which confers a drug-resistance phenotype to cells in which it is expressed.
