The acute phase response is characterized by changes in the serum concentrations of many proteins. A 1000-fold increase in the concentration of serum amyloid A (SAA) protein occurs within 24 hours of LPS injection in the mouse. We have isolated a cDNA clone and its corresponding genomic phage for a third, previously unreported SAA protein. The sequence of the cDNA, the gene's exons and neighboring DNA are presented along with the mapping evidence supporting the gene structure.
