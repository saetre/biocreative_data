The precise regulation and maintenance of balance between cell proliferation, differentiation and death in metazoan are critical for tissue homeostasis. CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein alpha (C/EBPalpha) has been implicated as a key regulator of differentiation and proliferation in various cell types. Here we investigated the potential dynamic change and role of C/EBPalpha protein during apoptosis induction.

###begin p 5
Upon onset of apoptosis induced by various kinds of inducers such as NSC606985, etoposide and others, C/EBPalpha expression presented a profound down-regulation in leukemic cell lines and primary cells via induction of protein degradation and inhibition of transcription, as assessed respectively by cycloheximide inhibition test, real-time quantitative RT-PCR and luciferase reporter assay. Applying chemical inhibition, forced expression of dominant negative mutant and catalytic fragment (CF) of protein kinase Cdelta (PKCdelta), which was proteolytically activated during apoptosis induction tested, we showed that the active PKCdelta protein contributed to the increased degradation of C/EBPalpha protein. Three specific proteasome inhibitors antagonized C/EBPalpha degradation during apoptosis induction. More importantly, ectopic expression of PKCdelta-CF stimulated the ubiquitination of C/EBPalpha protein, while the chemical inhibition of PKCdelta action significantly inhibited the enhanced ubiquitination of C/EBPalpha protein under NSC606985 treatment. Additionally, silencing of C/EBPalpha expression by small interfering RNAs enhanced, while inducible expression of C/EBPalpha inhibited NSC606985/etoposide-induced apoptosis in leukemic cells.

The precise regulation and maintenance of balance between cell proliferation, differentiation and death in multicellular organisms are critical for tissue homeostasis. Their disorders would cause the pathogenesis of many diseases, especially cancers including leukemias. Increasing lines of evidence support that the same protein can exert some roles in all or some of these important cellular events. For example, several caspases involved in cell apoptosis were shown to play a role in the differentiation of erythroid cells and macrophages [1]. Anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 is also associated with stem cells-committed differentiation and morphogenesis [2].

CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein alpha (C/EBPalpha), of which the genetic nomenclature is dubbed CEBPA, has been implicated as a key regulator of differentiation in various cell types such as adipocytes, hepatocytes and myeloid cells [3]-[5]. Its mutations were also found in about 10% of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) [6], and inhibition of its expression or function is also blocked by leukemogenesis-related genetic alterations such as t(8;21)-generated AML1-ETO [7]-[9] or t(9;22)-generated BCR-ABL fusion protein [10]. More recently, C/EBPalpha was also reported to induce the expression of anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 gene in hematopoietic cell lines in a manner independent of its DNA binding activity and protects Ba/F3 (a widely studied immature murine hematopoietic cell line with a pro-B lymphoid phenotype) from apoptosis on interleukin-3 withdrawal [11]. In this work, we investigate whether C/EBPalpha expression is modulated during apoptosis and whether C/EBPalpha contributes to apoptosis development in a common sense. Our observations indicate that the activation of protein kinase Cdelta (PKCdelta) upon apoptosis results in the increased proteasome-dependent degradation of C/EBPalpha, which partially contributes to PKCdelta-mediated apoptosis.

To evaluate whether the C/EBPalpha protein is regulated during apoptosis induction, NSC606985 (a water-soluble camptothecin ester derivative [12], [13]) was used as an apoptosis-inducing agent. Consistent with our previous report [14], the proteolytic activation of caspase-3 (a critical apoptosis effector [15]), as assessed by decreased pro-caspase-3 and increased active fragments of caspase-3, was induced by 25 nM of NSC606985 treatment for 12 hours in acute promyelocytic leukemic (APL) NB4 cells or by 50 nM of NSC606985 treatment for 36 hours in acute monocytic leukemic U937 cells (Figure 1A). Concomitantly, the treatment also triggered these two cell lines to undergo apoptosis, in which NB4 cells were more sensitive than U937 cells, as estimated by percentages of annexin-V+ cells and sub-G1 cells on flow cytometry as well as the Wright's staining-based morphological examinations (Figure S1). When the activated caspase-3 was detected, more intriguingly, C/EBPalpha protein was significantly reduced to an undetectable level in NSC606985-treated NB4 and U937 cells (Figure 1A). Of note, only the p42 isoform of C/EBPalpha could be clearly detected in NB4 and U937 cells, although there are two C/EBPalpha isoforms (p42 and p30) [16]. Therefore, C/EBPalpha protein is its p42 isoform in the following experiments. Additionally, 50 nM of NSC606985 also effectively reduced C/EBPalpha protein together with the cleaved activation of PKCdelta (Figure 1B) and apoptosis induction (data not shown) in primary leukemic cells from bone marrow (BM) of two AML patients. To determine whether the reduced C/EBPalpha protein is NSC606985-specific or apoptosis-dependent, other apoptosis inducers including etoposide, doxorubicin, arsenic trioxide (As2O3) and ultraviolent (UV) radiation were applied to NB4 and U937 cells. All these insults could effectively induce apoptosis of these two cell lines (Figure S2/S3) together with proteolytic activation of caspase-3 (Figure 1C/D). Meanwhile, C/EBPalpha protein was also reduced in NB4 and U937 cells (Figure 1C/D). Notably, C/EBPbeta and p53 proteins were undetectable in NB4 and U937 cells, respectively, and both NSC606985 and etoposide failed to alter the expression of C/EBPbeta protein in U937 cells or p53 protein in NB4 cells (Figure 1A/C). All these data supported that the reduction of C/EBPalpha protein is common to apoptosis induction.

To test whether C/EBPalpha expression is regulated at the post-transcriptional level during apoptosis, NB4 cells were treated with 10 microg/ml cycloheximide (CHX) and/or NSC606985 or etoposide for the different times. As shown in Figure 2A, half-life of C/EBPalpha protein in NB4 cells was more than 8 hours. In NSC606985 or etoposide-treated cells, however, C/EBPalpha protein disappeared or decreased to less than 50% at 4 hours after CHX blockage of protein synthesis, indicating that the stabilization of the C/EBPalpha protein was also lowered upon apoptosis induction. Evan so, we continued to dynamically measure the mRNA level of CEBPA in NSC606985- or etoposide-treated NB4 and U937 cells by real-time quantitative RT-PCR. The results revealed that NSC606985/etoposide-treated NB4 cells also presented reduced CEBPA mRNA, which initially appeared at 6 hours and 24 hours after treatment of NSC606985 and etoposide respectively, and became more significant later (Figure 2B). The reduced CEBPA mRNA could also be seen in NSC606985/etoposide-treated U937 cells, but CEBPA mRNA also experienced a rapid but temporary increase before the down-regulation in U937 cells (Figure 2B). This was also true for C/EBPalpha protein in U937 but not in NB4 cells treated by both NSC606985 and etoposide, although statistic significance was absent (Figure 1A/B). Furthermore, a CEBPA promoter-driven luciferase reporter assay also supported NSC606985 and etoposide significantly inhibited CEBPA gene promoter-driven luciferase transcription in both NB4 and U937 cells (Figure 2C). It should be point out that although the transitory elevation of CEBPA gene promoter-driven transcription could also be tested in U937 cells under the treatment of NSC606985 or etoposide, the early elevation of the reporter gene is very weak which indicated that there may be other mechanisms involved in the transient elevation of CEBPA mRNA. All these results proposed that both reduced transcription and increased degradation contributed to the down-regulation of C/EBPalpha expression during apoptosis induction.

It has been known that PKCdelta, a novel member of the PKC family, is implicated as an important regulator of apoptotic responses, especially in DNA-damaging agents-induced apoptosis [14], [17], [18]. The proteolytic activation of PKCdelta, which results in the generation of an active kinase domain [19], occurs in response to a variety of stimuli including DNA-damaging agents and exerts a crucial role in NSC606985/etoposide-induced apoptosis [9], [14], [20]. In line with our previous reports [14], [21], NSC606985/etoposide induced a proteolytic cleavage of PKCdelta into a 41kDa catalytic fragment (Figure 1A-C) that persistently activated the kinase [20]. Of note, the PKCdelta antibody also detected a strong band between the full-length PKCdelta and the catalytic fragment (CF) of PKCdelta, which also disappeared when cells are treated with apoptotic stimuli. What this band actually corresponds to remained to be explored. Also, it should be pointed out that the increase of truncated PKCdelta had a good correlation with the decrease of full-length PKCdelta after 24 hours of NSC606985 treatment in NB4 cells, but such correlation was not so remarkable in NSC606985 or etoposide-treated U937 cells. We extrapolated that this might be due to higher sensitivity of NB4 cells than U937 cells to etoposide and especially NSC606985-induced apoptosis (Figure S1/S2). The proteolytic activation of PKCdelta was also present in UV, doxorubicin and As2O3-induced apoptosis (Figure 1D). Considering that the proteolytic activated PKCdelta protein could target some proteins for their degradation [22] and the PKCdelta activation also occurred before the reduced C/EBPalpha protein according to time-course analysis (Figure 1A/C and ref [14]), we extrapolated that the PKCdelta activation was related to the degradation of C/EBPalpha protein. Hence, U937 and NB4 cells were pretreated with the specific PKCdelta inhibitor rottlerin, which significantly inhibited NSC606985-induced proteolytic activation of PKCdelta (Figure 3A). Likewise, it also antagonized activation of caspase-3, cleavage of its substrate poly-ADP ribose polymerase (PARP) (Figure 3A) and apoptosis (Figure 3B) induced by NSC606985. In parallel, rottlerin also partially restored C/EBPalpha protein but not its mRNA level upon NSC606985 treatment in both cells (Figure 3A).

Since rottlerin directly uncouples mitochondrial respiration from oxidative phosphorylation, and could block any number of ATP-dependent processes or inhibit other kinases [23], [24], data using rottlerin should be evaluated cautiously. Therefore, we also tested the effect of a dominant-negative mutant of PKCdelta (DN-PKCdelta), which selectively inhibits action of PKCdelta [25] and blocks apoptosis in response to diverse apoptotic stimuli [26]. By a retrovirus-infecting system, U937 cell line with stable transfection of the Flag-tagged DN-PKCdelta (U937Flag-DN-PKCdelta) or its control vector (U937vehicle) was generated. Our results showed that the forced expression of Flag-DN-PKCdelta significantly antagonized NSC606985-induced the activations of caspase-3 and PKCdelta (Figure 3C) and apoptosis induction (Figure 3D) in U937Flag-DN-PKCdelta cells. Accordingly, DN-PKCdelta expression also antagonized the decrease of C/EBPalpha protein (Figure 3C) but not its mRNA level (Figure S4).

Furthermore, pTRE2hyg-PKCdelta-CF-expressing vector and empty vector pTRE2hyg were respectively stably transfected to U937T cells, which contain stably transfected pUHD-tTA (tetracycline responsive transcription activator), whose expression is under the control of tetracycline [27]. Here, these transfected cells were referred as the U937PKCdelta-CF and U937mock cells, respectively. In U937PKCdelta-CF cells but not U937mock cells, PKCdelta-CF protein was induced significantly with no alteration of endogenous full-length PKCdelta protein from day 2 after tetracycline removal (Figure 3E). In this case, caspase-3 was also activated (Figure 3E) with apoptosis induction (Figure 3F). More intriguingly, the expression of PKCdelta-CF also reduced C/EBPalpha protein but not its mRNA in U937PKCdelta-CF cells. All these observations strongly suggested that proteolytic activated PKCdelta contributed to the enhanced degradation of C/EBPalpha protein during apoptosis.

Considering that all five apoptosis insults used here (Figure 1) and the inducible expression of PKCdelta-CF (Figure 3E) could activate caspase-3 and that inhibition of PKCdelta activation by rottlerin and DN-PKCdelta expression abrogated caspase-3 activation (Figure 3A/C), we asked whether PKCdelta mediates degradation of C/EBPalpha protein via activated caspase-3, which is an important member of a unique caspase family of conserved cysteine proteases that cleaves an impressive array of substrates after an aspartate residue [28]. As reported before [14], the pretreatment of cell-permeable caspase-3 inhibitor Z-DEVD-fmk almost completely blocked caspase-3 activation, which in turn partially inhibited proteolytic cleavage of PKCdelta (Figure 4A) and it also partially blocked apoptosis induced by NSC606985 (data not shown). However, this inhibitor failed to rescue NSC606985-reduced C/EBPalpha protein (Figure 4A). By the way, the purified recombinant his-tagged active fragment of caspase-3 could cleave AML1-ETO protein as described [29], [30], but it did not destroy the GST-C/EBPalpha protein (Figure 4B). All these experiments indicated that activated caspase-3 does not contribute to the degradation of C/EBPalpha protein during apoptosis.

Since C/EBPalpha protein can be degraded via the ubiquitin-proteasomal system [31], we continued to explore the possible contribution of the system in PKCdelta-induced C/EBPalpha degradation. For this purpose, three specific proteasome inhibitors including epoxomicin [32], bortezomib [33] and MG-132 [34] were each used to treat U937 cells together with 50 nM of NSC606985. The results showed that all three inhibitors, especially epoxomicin and bortezomib, significantly antagonized NSC606985-induced decrease of C/EBPalpha protein, although MG132 and bortezomib at concentration used also induced and/or enhanced NSC606985-induced PKCdelta and caspase-3 activation (Figure 5A) and cell death (Figure S5) due to their potential cell toxicities widely documented [35]. Furthermore, MG132 also inhibited degradation of C/EBPalpha protein in the presence of CHX in NSC606985/etopsoside-treated or untreated NB4 cells (Figure 5B). These results suggested that the proteasomal mechanism contributes to the enhanced degradation of C/EBPalpha protein upon apoptosis.

Next we tested whether NSC606985 induces the ubiquitination of C/EBPalpha protein. To do this, NB4 cells were treated with or without 25 nM of NSC606985 and/or proteosome inhibitor MG132 for 12 hours, at which point PKCdelta was activated without decrease of C/EBPalpha protein (Figure 1A/6A), and C/EBPalpha protein was immunoprecipitated followed by western blot with antibody against ubiquitin. As shown in Figure 6A, MG132 treatment effectively increased the ubiquitinated C/EBPalpha protein which could not be detected in untreated cells, indicating the specificity and effectiveness of the assay system. NSC606985 treatment also significantly increased the ubiquitinated C/EBPalpha protein regardless of the presence of MG132. More intriguingly, when the activation of PKCdelta was blocked by rottlerin, as shown in Figure 6B, the enhanced ubiquitination of C/EBPalpha protein also disappeared during NSC606985 treatment. Furthermore, GFP-tagged PKCdelta-CF or its empty vector pEGFP-N1 was transfected into HEK293T cells together with C/EBPalpha and His6-tagged ubiquitin constructs, followed by immunoprecipitation of C/EBPalpha protein and blots for the ubiquitin and C/EBPalpha proteins. The results demonstrated that only co-transfection of C/EBPalpha and His6-ubiquitin induced a lower degree of ubiquitination of C/EBPalpha protein (lane 1, Figure 6C), which was significantly enhanced by MG132 treatment (lane 2, Figure 6C). Similar to that seen in NSC606985-treated NB4 cells (Figure 6A/B), addition of GFP-PKCdelta-CF also increased the ubiquitinated C/EBPalpha protein in the presence of co-transfection of C/EBPalpha and ubiquitin (lane 3, Figure 6C). It should be pointed out that, although the transfected C/EBPalpha protein could also be destructed by the ectopically expressed PKCdelta-CF and rescued by MG132 (top panel, Figure 6C), co-administration of MG132 did not significantly increase the ubiquitinated C/EBPalpha protein induced by co-transfection of PKCdelta-CF and ubiquitin (lane 3, Figure 6C) or NSC606985 treatment (Figure 6A). All these results suggested that the activated PKCdelta mediated the enhanced ubiquitination of C/EBPalpha protein under NSC606985 treatment.

Finally, three pairs of siRNAs (C1-3) against C/EBPalpha were designed and transfected into U937 cells. With selection by G418, C2 and C3 siRNAs but not C1 siRNA significantly inhibited C/EBPalpha protein expression, compared with negative control (Figure 7A). The suppression of C/EBPalpha expression by C2 and C3 siRNAs statistically significantly enhanced NSC606985/etoposide-induced activation of caspase-3 (Figure S6) and apoptosis, the latter being determined by the percentages of sub-G1 cells (Figure 7B), annexin-V+ cells (Figure 7C) as well as cell morphology (Figure S7). On the other hand, an inducible C/EBPalpha-expressing cell line (U937C/EBPalpha) was generated using myeloid leukemic U937T cells as described above. U937empty cell line with transfection of empty vector was used as a control. As can be visualized in Figure 8A, C/EBPalpha protein was significantly induced at 6 days after tetracycline withdrawal in U937C/EBPalpha cells. Hence, we treated U937empty and U937C/EBPalpha cells with NSC606985 or etoposide when tetracycline was removed for 8 days. The results showed that the inducible expression of C/EBPalpha partially inhibited NSC606985/etoposide-induced caspase-3 action (Figure S8) and apoptosis to a statistic degree (Figure 8B/C and Figure S8). These results supported the anti-apoptotic role of C/EBPalpha. Additionally, conditional expression of C/EBPalpha protein failed to alter expressions of apoptosis-related Bcl-2, Bak, Bax and Mcl-1 genes in U937C/EBPalpha cells (Figure 8D), and the suppression of C/EBPalpha expression by siRNAs also failed to alter Bcl-2 protein level (Figure 7A).

Previously, a variety of DNA-damaging agents such as UV, etoposide and bleomycin were shown to induce C/EBPalpha expression in keratinocytes, but not in HepG2, NRK or NIH 3T3 cells, indicating that the induction of C/EBPalpha by DNA damage is dependent upon cell context [36]. Although we also found that both NSC606985 and etoposide appeared to induce a rapid but transitory elevation of CEBPA expression in U937 but not NB4 cells, all apoptosis-inducing agents tested here induced a profound down-regulation of C/EBPalpha protein in leukemic cell lines NB4 and U937 as well as in primary leukemic cells when apoptosis occurred. Further investigation showed that NSC606985 and etoposide significantly shortened the half-life of C/EBPalpha protein and reduced expression of CEBPA mRNA and CEBPA promoter-driven luciferase reporter assay, suggesting that inhibition of transcription and induction of protein degradation of C/EBPalpha contributed to down-regulation of C/EBPalpha protein during apoptosis induction.

Inhibition of caspase-3 by Z-DEVD-fmk failed to rescue NSC606985-reduced C/EBPalpha protein, and the purified recombinant active fragment of caspase-3 did not cleave C/EBPalpha protein in vitro, indicating that activated caspase-3 does not contribute to PKCdelta-induced instability of C/EBPalpha protein during apoptosis. It is believed that PKCdelta is a substrate for the apoptosis-critical executioner caspase-3, which cleaves PKCdelta to a 41 kDa catalytically active fragment [19], [37]. Vice versa, the ability of PKCdelta activation to enhance DNA-damaging agents such as cisplatin-induced apoptosis was correlated with their ability to enhance caspase-3 activation, and rottlerin inhibits cisplatin or NSC606985-induced activation of caspase-3 [14], [38], [39], proposing that PKCdelta also acts upstream of caspase-3 to regulate its activation. Therefore, there is a feedback loop between PKCdelta and caspase-3 to promote apoptosis [18], [40], [41]. Of note, it remains not to be completely clear how DNA damage activates PKCdelta. Although it was proposed that PKCdelta may regulate its own cleavage in response to apoptotic stimuli [38], recently we used quantitative proteomic analysis to identify the differentially expressed proteins before PKCdelta activation induced by NSC606985 in U937 cells. As a result, a total of 33 proteins were found to be dysregulated in this situation and we proposed that the downregulation of N-myc downstream regulated gene 1 (NDRG1) is involved in proteolytic activation of PKCdelta during apoptosis induction [39].
###end p 46
###begin p 47
Next, we investigated whether the down-regulation of C/EBPalpha protein is mediated by proteolytically activated PKCdelta. Our results showed that inhibition of action of PKCdelta by rottlerin and stable transfection of DN-PKCdelta partially rescured C/EBPalpha protein but not its mRNA level upon NSC606985 treatment, suggesting that the activated PKCdelta protein contributes to the increased degradation of C/EBPalpha protein but not to the reduced transcription of CEBPA by DNA-damaging agents. This notion is also supported by the fact that transfected expression of the PKCdelta-CF reduces C/EBPalpha protein but not its mRNA.

In accordance with previous reports [14], [42], [43], overexpression of the PKCdelta-CF is sufficient to induce apoptosis, and proteolytic activation of PKCdelta exerts a critical role in NSC606985-induced apoptosis at least in AML cells. However, mechanisms of PKCdelta-mediated apoptosis are controversial. PKCdelta is a mobile enzyme, and its intracellular distribution is altered upon activation. This is one way to reach the appropriate targets in order to elicit its biological responses. One of the most important questions is how and where PKCdelta transduces its apoptotic signals. It appears that PKCdelta can act at several locations for apoptosis induction, including the plasma membrane, mitochondria and nucleus. Previously, we showed that NSC606985-induced PKCdelta cleavage simultaneously occurs in the cytoplasm and nuclei of both NB4 and U937 cells [14]. In spite of the subcellular localization, it remains to be illustrated what are the downstream targets of PKCdelta for apoptosis induction. In response to DNA damage, as reported [44], catalytic fragment of PKCdelta can phosphorylate and inactivate DNA-dependent protein kinase, resulting in further cell death. PKCdelta can also phosphorylate p73beta, a member of the p53 family [45]. Lamin B and phospholipid scramblase 3 were also proposed to be substrates of PKCdelta and could contribute to apoptosis [46], [47]. Thus, PKCdelta can contribute to apoptosis by phosphorylating different targets that are localized in the nucleus, plasma membrane or mitochondria. However, our immunoprecipitation experiment did not support the C/EBPalpha-PKCdelta interaction and the activated PKCdelta did not appear to directly induce phosphorylation of C/EBPalpha protein (data not shown). On the other hand, the NSC606985-induced decrease of C/EBPalpha protein was significantly antagonized by specific proteasome inhibitors MG-132, epoxomicin and bortezomib. Of great importance, NSC606985 and ectopic expression of PKCdelta-CF significantly increased ubiquitination of endogenously and ectopically expressed C/EBPalpha protein, while rottlerin significantly inhibited the enhanced ubiquitination of endogenously expressed C/EBPalpha protein during NSC606985 treatment. Although the effect of the forced expression of DN-PKCdelta on ubiquitination of C/EBPalpha protein remains to be determined, all these results suggested that activated PKCdelta mediates proteasome-dependent degradation of C/EBPalpha protein, which is involved the enhanced degradation of C/EBPalpha protein upon apoptosis induction. In fact, a recent report showed that the von Hippel-Lindau tumor-suppressor protein, a ubiquitin-ligase (E3) directing proteasome-dependent degradation of targeted proteins, interacts directly with the catalytic domain of PKCdelta in cells [48], and PKCdelta does mediate proteasome-dependent degradation of certain proteins such as mitogen-activated protein kinase phosphatase-1 and p21cip1[49], [50]. By the way, we also found that activated PKCdelta could alter the subcellular localization of C/EBPalpha protein (data not shown), which might be related to the degradation of C/EBPalpha protein.

It remains to be investigated how CEBPA mRNA was reduced during apoptosis induction. The actinomycin-inhibiting test showed that NSC606985 or etoposide treatment failed to alter the stability of CEBPA mRNA (data not shown), suggesting that the transcription of CEBPA may be regulated, which could be supported by the CEBPA promoter driven luciferase reporter assay. As reported [51]-[53], the consensus recognition sequences of some apoptosis-related transcription factors such as sp1, myc/max and AP2alpha are present in the promoter region of CEBPA gene. Therefore, the down-regulation of CEBPA during apoptosis induction may also be associated with these factors. Additionally, the auto-activation function of C/EBPalpha protein has been reported [54]. Thus, we cannot exclude the possibility that the decrease of CEBPA mRNA is due to the reduced C/EBPalpha protein although the decrease of C/EBPalpha protein but not its mRNA was partially rescued by rottlerin and the expression of PKCdelta-CF also reduced C/EBPalpha protein but not its mRNA.

The inhibition of caspase-3 by its specific inhibitor did not completely inhibit PKCdelta activation-related apoptosis, suggesting that caspase-3-independent mechanism(s) also contributes to the event [14], [18], [42], [55]. The fact that C/EBPalpha protein was one of the down-stream effectors of the activated PKCdelta during apoptosis induction pushed us to explore its possible role in apoptotic event. Here we showed that inhibition of C/EBPalpha expression enhanced, while its over-expression inhibited, DNA-damaging agents-induced apoptosis, which could be shown by annexin-V+ cells%, especially by sub-G1 cells% and apoptosis-related morphologic analysis. These results demonstrated that the modulation of C/EBPalpha expression contributes, at least partially, to the activation of PKCdelta-mediated apoptosis. It was proposed that C/EBPalpha induces the expression of the anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 gene [11]. However, this notion could not be confirmed in this work. Similarly, conditional expression of C/EBPalpha protein did not alter other apoptosis-related genes, including Bak, Bax and Mcl-1. Therefore, molecular mechanisms of anti-apoptotic effect of C/EBPalpha remain to be explored.

Taken together, our results demonstrated that C/EBPalpha expression is down-regulated in apoptotic leukemic cells partially through induction of protein degradation, the latter involving proteolytically activated PKCdelta-enhanced ubiquitination of C/EBPalpha protein. Furthermore, C/EBPalpha exerts a role in chemotherapeutic drugs-induced apoptosis. These results would shed novel sights for understanding mechanisms of PKCdelta-related apoptosis and functions of C/EBPalpha between differentiation and apoptosis.

To detect the ubiquitination of C/EBPalpha protein, cell lysates were immediately boiled in 1% SDS for 15 min followed by dilution with the lysis buffer (50 mM HEPES, 50 mM NaCl, 0.1% Tween-20, 10% glycerol, 20 mM sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mM dithiothreitol, plus protease inhibitors) to 0.1% SDS. Then, the lysates were incubated with anti-C/EBPalpha antibody (sc-61, Santa Cruz Biotech, Santa Cruz, CA) and protein A-agarose (Santa Cruz) and rocked overnight at 4degreesC. The complexes were centrifuged at 1,200 g and washed three times with ice-cold lysis buffer. Immunoprecipitated proteins and protein extracts were equally loaded on 10-12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel, and transferred to nitrocellulose membrane (Amersham Bioscience). The blots were stained with 0.2% Ponceau S red to ensure equal protein loading. After blocking with 5% nonfat milk in PBS, the membranes were incubated with antibodies against C/EBPalpha (sc-61 or c-18), PARP, pro-caspase-3 (E-8), PKCdelta, GFP, Bcl-2, p53, Mcl-1, Bax (Santa Cruz), Bak (Sigma-Aldrich), active caspase-3 [cleaved caspase-3 (Asp175)], ubiquitin (Cell Signaling, Beverly, MA) and beta-actin (Calbiochem), followed by horseradish perioxidase (HRP)-linked secondary antibodies (Cell Signaling). Detection was performed using a chemiluminescence phototope-HRP kit (Dako, Carpinteria, CA). When necessary, signal intensity of C/EBPalpha protein was normalized against beta-actin as internal control using GS-800 calibrated imaging density meter (Bio-Rad), and folds of changes were expressed compared with untreated cells.
