An H5 cDNA clone was used to select H5 genomal recombinants from a chicken Charon 4A library. DNA sequence analysis shows that the H5 gene contains no introns. Putative 5' promoter elements and a 3' polyadenylation site are present within the 1.8 kb of DNA examined. Analysis of 41 kb of DNA surrounding the H5 gene shows that it is not closely linked to either H1 or core histone genes.
