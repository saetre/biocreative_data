To study the control mechanism(s) that govern the transcription of c-myb, genomic clones corresponding to the 5' region of the murine c-myb gene have been isolated and characterized structurally and functionally. Primer extension and nuclease protection analysis have revealed the presence of multiple transcriptional initiation sites, that are utilized in several hemopoietic cell lines (WEHI3B(D+). FDC-P1 and RB22.2). Some of the sites are used in all cell lines but others are unique; all are located in a region of the c-myb gene that is G-C rich, contains a number of potential Sp1 binding sites and lacks classical promoter consensus sequences. Experiments in which well characterized promoters controlling expression of a reporter gene have been replaced by fragments of c-myb DNA (including the observed cap sites) were performed in an attempt to demonstrate promoter activity in various cell types. It was shown that a region of the c-myb gene (approximately 1.0 kbp upstream from the splice donor site of the first exon) contains a weak promoter that has a low level of transcriptional activity in hemopoietic as well as in fibroblastic cells. These results support the suggestion that c-myb expression is not regulated primarily at the level of initiation of transcription.
