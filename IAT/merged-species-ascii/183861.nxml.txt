One of the major cellular serine/threonine protein phosphatases is protein phosphatase type 1 (PP1). Studies employing many eukaryotic systems all point to a crucial role for PP1 activity in controlling cell cycle progression. One physiological substrate for PP1 appears to be the product of the retinoblastoma susceptibility gene (pRB), a demonstrated tumor suppressor. The growth suppressive activity of pRB is regulated by its phosphorylation state. Of critical importance is the question of the in vivo effect of PP1 activity on pRB and growth regulation. As a first step towards addressing this question, we developed an inducible PP1 expression system to investigate the regulation of PP1 activity.

We have established a cell line for inducing protein expression of the type 1, alpha-isotype, serine/threonine protein phosphatase (PP1alpha). A plasmid encoding a fusion protein of the catalytic subunit of PP1alpha with a 6-histidine peptide (6His) and a peptide from hemagluttinin (HA) was transfected into the UMUC3 transitional cell carcinoma cell line, previously transfected with the reverse tetracycline transactivator plasmid pUHD172-1neo. A stable cell line designated LLWO2F was established by selection with hygromycin B. 6His-HA-PP1alpha protein appeared in cell lysates within two hours following addition of doxycycline to the culture medium. This protein localizes to the nucleus as does endogenous PP1alpha, and was shown to associate with PNUTS, a PP1-nuclear targeting subunit. Like endogenous PP1alpha, immunocomplexed 6His-HA-PP1alpha is active toward phosphorylase a and the product of the retinoblastoma susceptibility gene, pRB. When forcibly overexpressing 6His-HA-PP1alpha, there is a concomitant decrease in endogenous PP1alpha levels.

These data suggest the existence of an autoregulatory mechanism by which PP1alpha protein levels and activity remain relatively constant. RT-PCR analyses of isolated polysome fractions support the notion that this putative autoregulatory mechanism is exerted, at least in part, at the translational level. Implications of these findings for the study of PP1alpha function in vivo are discussed.

One of the major cellular serine/threonine protein phosphatases is protein phosphatase type 1 (PP1) [1]. An abundant enzyme expressed in all cells, complex regulation of PP1 is thought to be essential for proper temporal and spatial regulation of PP1 catalytic activity towards individual substrates [2]. Three different isotypes of the catalytic subunit, designated PP1alpha, PP1delta, and PP1gamma1, are expressed in many different cell types [3]. Studies employing many eukaryotic systems all point to a crucial role for PP1 activity in controlling cell cycle progression, and an absolute requirement of this activity for mitotic exit [4-7]. There is also evidence to suggest that phosphorylation of PP1 and its associated proteins by the cyclin-dependent kinases may regulate PP1 activity in a cell cycle stage-dependent manner [8-10]. Hence, current efforts are directed towards identification of cell cycle-dependent substrates for PP1, and how regulation of PP1 activity towards these substrates controls the cell division cycle.

One physiological substrate for PP1 appears to be the product of the retinoblastoma susceptibility gene, pRB [11-13], a demonstrated tumor suppressor. The cell growth and tumor suppressive activity of pRB is regulated by its phosphorylation state. pRB phosphorylation varies as a function of cell cycle phase; during G1 the hypophosphorylated form predominates, while the hyperphosphorylated form accumulates during S, G2 and M phase [14-16]. It is this hypophosphorylated form of pRB present during early and mid G1 which functions to modify gene expression. This is achieved by complexing with transcription factors resulting in repression [17] or stimulation [18] of transcription. Under conditions favoring proliferation, the phosphorylation of pRB via cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) in mid-to-late G1 phase results in liberation of E2F and other pRB-bound transcription factors, which then activate the transcription of S-phase genes [19]. In late M phase, pRB returns to its growth suppressive, hypophosphorylated form due to the action of a pRB-directed protein phosphatase belonging to the type 1 class of serine/threonine protein phosphatases [11,20,21].

Of critical importance is the question of the in vivo effect of PP1 activity on pRB and growth regulation. To date, several techniques have been employed in this regard to demonstrate PP1 actions in intact cells. Berndt et. al. [22] used electroporation to introduce PP1 protein into tissue culture cells having noted that previous genetic attempts to accomplish overexpression were not readily accomplished. Using this technique, they showed a G1 block by PP1 that was dependent upon the presence of pRB. In another report, micro-injection of PP1 decreased extractability of pRB from nuclei, presumably by increasing dephosphorylation and increasing association with nuclear proteins thereby playing a role in G1/S transition inhibition [13]. Micro-injection of antibodies to the PP1 catalytic subunit has been shown to block cells in metaphase [23]. Since this is the time during mitosis when pRB is normally dephosphorylated [11,24], it is tempting to speculate that prevention of pRB dephosphorylation by inhibiting PP1 activity impedes an orderly progression through mitosis, perhaps contributing towards a transformed phenotype.

Here, using the tetracycline induction system [25], we developed an inducible PP1 expression system to investigate the regulation of PP1 activity. We view this as a first step towards addressing the question of the in vivo effect of PP1 activity on pRB and growth regulation. Our results support the notion that induced PP1alpha protein functions identically to endogenous PP1alpha with respect to non-catalytic subunit binding and activity towards phosphorylase a and the tumor suppressor pRB. Localization of this protein to the nucleus also mirrors that of endogenous PP1alpha in vivo. When using this system to forcibly overexpress 6His-HA-PP1alpha, there is a concomitant decrease in endogenous PP1alpha levels, suggesting the existence of an autoregulatory mechanism by which PP1alpha protein levels remain constant. RT-PCR analyses of isolated polysome fractions supports the notion that this putative autoregulatory mechanism is exerted, at least in part, at the translational level.

Figure 1 shows construct of the tetracycline-inducible plasmid used to express 6His-HA-PP1alpha. As shown in Figure 2A, 24 hr incubation with doxycycline in the medium has no appreciable effect on endogenous PP1alpha protein expression in the untransfected parent cell line (UMUC3) or a cell line transfected with the reverse tetracycline transactivator plasmid pUHD172-1neo only (LLWO1). A time course of induction by doxycycline was then carried out in stable clone LLWO2F. Harvested at various time intervals, whole-cell lysates were prepared and the proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE for western blotting using antibody to the hemagglutinin tag. As shown in Figure 2B, a protein with the anticipated molecular weight of 40 kDa was detected. A clear differential of expression of 6His-HA-PP1alpha (indicated at the left of the panel) was observed at 1.5 hours after addition of doxycycline, which became more pronounced at later time points. The doxycycline-independent increase in 6His-HA-PP1alpha is attributed to background expression when using this system [25]. As predicted for a protein under the control of the doxycycline-inducible promoter, the abundance of 6His-HA-PP1alpha decreases in the absence of the inducer over time (Figure 2C). Subsequent time course experiments revealed peak abundance occurring between 16 and 24 hr, and remaining constant thereafter for at least 72 hr, at which time the experiment was terminated. As such, we have chosen the 24 hr induction time for all subsequent experiments to ensure peak abundance of the induced 6His-HA-PP1alpha.

As shown in Figure 2C, a significant reduction in 6His-HA-PP1alpha abundance can be observed between 3 and 12 hrs following removal of doxycycline. This reduction continued through the 24 hr time point at which time the experiment ended. Taken together, these data confirm the dependence of 6His-HA-PP1alpha protein production on the tet-O/CMV promoter, thus demonstrating inducible expression of PP1alpha. As expected [25], some low-level expression of 6His-HA-PP1alpha in the absence of the inducer doxycycline can also be detected.

To begin addressing the biological and biochemical characterization of inducible PP1alpha, we next localized this protein in situ using immunohistochemistry. As shown in Figure 3, there is a predominant nuclear localization of the hemagglutinin epitope (panel A) compared to the low-level cytoplasmic and nuclear background reactivity seen in the uninduced LLWO2F control cells (panel B). Thus, not only can doxycycline-induced expression of PP1alpha be detected immunohistochemically, but localization of this protein appears to be identical to that of endogenous PP1 [26].

Targeting of PP1 to the nucleus is due in part to a PP1-associated nuclear targeting subunit (PNUTS; [27]). To further investigate the properties of inducible PP1alpha, we performed coprecipitation studies to determine if PNUTS can also be found associated with 6His-HA-PP1alpha. Towards this goal, a fusion protein of GST and PNUTS was tested for the ability to capture induced PP1alpha. Lysates from induced LLWO2F cells were combined with GST-alone- or GST-PNUTS-loaded glutathione Sepharose beads. Following separation by SDS-PAGE and western blotting, antibody to hemagglutinin was used to detect any associated 6His-HA-PP1alpha. Antibody reactivity would indicate a link from the GST epitope to the hemagglutinin epitope via a PNUTS to PP1alpha interaction. As shown in Figure 4, the hemagglutinin epitope was captured by the GST-PNUTS fusion protein, but not the GST-alone protein. These data support the idea that induced PP1alpha and the nuclear targeting PP1-associated protein PNUTS can form a complex. These results further support the view that induced PP1alpha behaves similarly if not identically to endogenous PP1alpha, and provides a possible mechanistic explanation for 6His-HA-PP1alpha localization to the nucleus.

Two different approaches were taken to address the biochemical activity of inducible PP1alpha. First, immunocomplexed 6His-HA-PP1alpha was tested for its ability to dephosphorylate phosphorylase a. Phosphorylated on a single serine residue, this substrate is often used to monitor the biochemical activity of PP1 in vitro [28]. As shown in Figure 5, greater phosphatase activity is detected in immunoprecipitates from induced LLWO2F cell lysates compared to uninduced. This is consistent with the notion that inducible PP1alpha is enzymatically active. Our second approach involved testing immunopurified 6His-HA-PP1alpha for its ability to dephosphorylate the growth suppressor protein pRB. Having previously reported on the ability of immunocomplexed endogenous PP1 to dephosphorylate pRB [20], we followed the same experimental approach. Figure 6 shows a significant decrease in the 32P radiolabel intensity for pRB following incubation with the anti-hemagglutinin immunoprecipitate compared to the normal mouse IgG control immunoprecipitate. In addition, okadaic acid, a potent inhibitor of PP1 activity [29], significantly inhibits pRB dephosphorylation in this reaction. Taken together, these data indicate that inducible PP1alpha is biochemically active.

One prediction would be that by increasing expression of the catalytic subunit of PP1alpha, overall PP1-specific activity within the cell would increase. To address this, we tested the phosphatase activity of LLWO2F whole-cell lysate using phosphorylase a as the substrate. To inhibit any endogenous PP2A activity, which can also dephosphorylate phosphorylase a and thus interfere with PP1 activity measurements, these assays were carried out in the presence of 5 nM okadaic acid, which does not inhibit PP1 activity [30]. Although reproducible, we observed only modest increases in PP1-specific activity found in lysates from induced cells compared to the uninduced controls (Figure 7). One possible explanation for this finding is that the overall level of PP1alpha within the cell remains relatively constant regardless of induction. Indeed, a time course of induction followed by western blotting of whole cell lysates using antibody to PP1alpha revealed diminution of the endogenous PP1alpha signal after 4 hr of induction, while the 6His-HA-PP1alpha signal increased (Figure 8). To further test this hypothesis, immunoprecipitation and western blotting experiments were carried out using PP1 isoform-specific antibodies. As shown in Figure 9, top panel, induced (approximate molecular weight of 40 kDa) and endogenous (approximate molecular weight of 37 kDa) PP1alpha are clearly resolved by SDS-PAGE. As predicted, both proteins are recognized by antibody specific for PP1alpha when performing immunoprecipitation or western blotting. Immunoprecipitation using PP1alpha antibody followed by western blotting using the same anti-PP1alpha reveals a reciprocal relationship in PP1alpha abundance following doxycycline induction; endogenous PP1alpha levels decrease in response to increasing levels of 6His-HA-PP1alpha (top panel, compare left two lanes). This difference in abundance is more striking in the whole-cell lysate lanes; endogenous PP1alpha fails to be detected in lysates prepared from induced cells (compare middle two lanes). Parallel experiments performed using the same lysate and antibody to hemagglutinin for immunoprecipitation and western blotting show the position of 6His-HA-PP1alpha and the fact that endogenous PP1alpha is not recognized by this antibody (bottom panel). Western blotting for additional isoforms of PP1 reveals that this reduction in PP1alpha following induction is isotype-specific; when 6His-HA-PP1alpha levels increase, concomitant with a decrease in PP1alpha levels, PP1delta and PP1gamma1 levels remain relatively unchanged from those found in uninduced cell lysate (Figure 10). Taken together, these data suggest that an as yet undescribed negative-feedback or autoregulatory mechanism exists for PP1alpha which contributes towards maintaining a constant level of protein expression and enzyme activity.

PP1alpha isoform-specific antibody was used to immunoprecipitate proteins from equal quantities (50 ug) of uninduced (first lane from the left, top panel) and induced LLWO2F cell lysate (second lane from the left, top panel).

Although low levels of 6His-HA-PP1alpha can be detected in cell lysate from uninduced cells following western blotting, this protein is almost undetectable in the same lysate following immunoprecipitation and western blotting. This observation is most likely due to low efficiency of immunoprecipitation.

To address the possible autoregulatory mechanism(s) of PP1alpha expression and activity, we analyzed the RNA levels of both endogenous PP1alpha and induced 6His-HA-PP1alpha. For uninduced cells, only endogenous PP1alpha RNA can be found associated with polysomes (Figure 11, second lane). While some 6His-HA-PP1alpha RNA can be detected in the total RNA, the majority PP1alpha RNA detected in the total preparation is endogenous (fourth lane). In contrast, it appears that for the doxycycline-induced cells (third lane), there is more 6His-HA-PP1alpha RNA associated with polysomes than endogenous PP1alpha. However, both messages appear to be present at the same level in the total RNA preparation (fifth lane). This apparent preference for 6His-HA-PP1alpha RNA association with polysomes suggest that autoregulation takes place, at least in part, at the translational level.

In summary, we report on the development of an inducible mammalian cell expression system for the catalytic subunit of the alpha-isotype for PP1. This protein behaves similarly if not identically to endogenous PP1alpha with respect to nuclear localization, complex formation to a recently described PP1-associated nuclear targeting protein, and in vitro enzymatic activity towards phosphorylase a and the cell growth and tumor suppressor protein pRB.

We observed that endogenous PP1alpha protein levels decrease in response to increasing levels of induced 6His-HA-PP1alpha protein. This observation suggests that an as yet undescribed negative-feedback or autoregulatory mechanism exists for PP1alpha which contributes towards maintaining a constant level of this enzyme. Given the difficulty in achieving overexpression of PP1 protein and activity in mammalian cells, this suggestion provides an attractive explanation. This putative mechanism appears to be isotype-specific, since the protein levels of PP1delta and PP1gamma1 remained relatively unchanged in response to induced expression of PP1alpha. Precedent for an autoregulatory mechanism comes from a report by Baharians and Schonthal [31], in which they demonstrate endogenous PP2A protein levels decrease in the presence of increasing amounts of forcibly-expressed exogenous PP2A. Their report also provides evidence that this control is exerted at the translational level and does not involve regulation of transcription or RNA processing. Using a similar approach of analyzing mRNA association with ribosomes as a measure of translation efficiency, a similar level of translational control also appears to exist for PP1alpha. If mRNA association with ribosomes is truly a measure of translation efficiency, one conclusion from these data is that in doxycycline-induced cells, 6His-HA-PP1alpha RNA is more efficiently translated than endogenous PP1alpha. This would help to explain why we observed a decrease in endogenous PP1alpha protein expression in doxycycline-induced cells. Since we did not perform rigorous analyses on PP1alpha regulation of transcription or RNA processing, we cannot rule out the possibility that some level of transcriptional control also exists. Indeed, the abundance of endogenous PP1alpha RNA found in uninduced cells appears equal to or greater than the combined abundance of endogenous and 6His-HA-PP1alpha RNA (Figure 9), supporting the notion that some level of translational control may also exist.

These findings, provided by the development of this inducible PP1 expression system, will afford new research opportunities aimed towards addressing the question of how PP1 activity is regulated. This putative autoregulatory mechanism for the catalytic subunit may help to explain why the overall abundance of PP1 during the various phases of the cell cycle remains relatively constant [32]. Historically, regulation of PP1 catalytic activity has resulted from associated subunits inhibiting or targeting the catalytic subunit towards substrates [33]. While the PP1 catalytic subunit is not found alone in the cell, such unassociated catalytic subunits have been shown to be active, at least in vitro. Although speculative, there may be a threshold amount of catalytic subunit in vivo above which associated proteins are limiting. Such a situation may compromise the ability of associated proteins to effectively regulate PP1 catalytic activity. To guard against this scenario, control over the amount of PP1 catalytic subunit present via an autoregulatory mechanism would be beneficial.

The data presented here validate a useful system with which to manipulate PP1 activity in vivo for the purpose of functional studies. Just as is the case for PP2A [31], it seems clear that efficient overall increases in PP1 protein abundance may not be achieved due to a putative negative feed-back or autoregulatory mechanism. However, induced expression of exogenous PP1 which behaves identically to endogenous PP1 while remaining physically distinguishable can facilitate the use of mutants to address functional questions, particularly in the area of cell cycle regulation and tumor cell growth suppression. Indeed, the use of a constitutively active mutant of PP1 has already been shown to result in pRB-dependent G1 arrest in human cancer cells [22]. Placing this mutant into the inducible expression system described here has the potential to down-regulate expression of wild-type endogenous PP1. Doing so in a timed, controlled manner will permit in vivo studies addressing PP1 function during discrete phases of the cell cycle, and will be the subject of future endeavors.

The rabbit PP1alpha cDNA in pDR540 [34] was ligated into pcDNA3 (Invitrogen) to create a fusion encoding 6 histidines (6-His) followed by an epitope (YPYDVPDYA) from the Hemophilus influenza hemagglutinin protein (HA). The sequence and reading frame was validated by BigDye DNA sequencing (PE Applied Biosystems). The fusion gene was then cut from the 6His-HA-PP1alpha-pcDNA3 plasmid and ligated into pTEP4m, which contains a tetracycline response element for inducible expression [25], and a hygromycin resistance gene for selection in eukaryotic cells (see Figure 1). pUHD172-1neo [25] encodes the reverse tetracycline transactivator protein fused with a nuclear localization signal (rtTA-nls). In addition to the rtTA-nls gene under control of the CMV promoter, the plasmid contains neomycin and ampicillin antibiotic resistance genes.

Transfection of UMUC3 cells with pUHD172-1neo was followed 48 hr later by selection using geneticin. Isolated colonies were obtained at 800 mug/ml. These cells were passaged and expanded before transfection with pBI-EGFP (Clontech), which contains the enhanced green fluorescent protein coding sequence under control of a bi-directional tetracycline response element. At the end of the 2 hr transfection (as described above) the medium was replaced with complete medium with and without doxycycline at 1 ug/ml final concentration. 24 hr later the cells were examined by fluorescence microscopy. The presence of doxycycline dependent green fluorescence was indicative of stable transfection with pUHD172-1neo encoding the rtTA-nls protein and transient transfection with pBi-EGFP. Parallel cultures were then passaged and transfected with 6His-HA-PP1alpha-pTEP4m. Selection with hygromycin was begun 48 hr later. Isolated colonies were obtained at 100 ug/ml hygromycin and were passaged and diluted to extinction. Six cell lines, designated LLW02A through LLW02F, were established. The LLW02F cell line was used for all subsequent experiments. This choice was based on high levels of induced PP1alpha expression as assayed by immunoblotting.

Uninduced and induced LLWO2F cells (10 x 100 mm dishes) were washed 3-times with ice-cold serum-free DMEM containing 10 ug/ml cycloheximide. After the last wash, cells were scraped into a final volume of 5 ml of this same medium for each 10-dish treatment. The cells were harvested with a brief centrifugation. The cell pellet was resuspended in 0.5 ml lysis buffer (125 mM KCl, 12.5 mM mgCl2, 10 mM Hepes, pH 6.8, 0.1 mM dithiothreitol, 10 ug/ml cycloheximide, 0.5% Triton X-100, 0.5% deoxycholate) followed by 10 passages through a 22 gauge needle to lyse the cells. The resulting extracts were then layered on the top of a 10-40% sucrose gradient (125 mM KCl, 12.5 mM mgCl2, 10 mM Hepes, pH 6.8, 0.1 mM dithiothreitol, 10 ug/ml cycloheximide) and centrifuged at 4degreesC in a SW50.1 rotor at 48,000 rpm for 60 min. After centrifugation, the gradient was fractionated in 200 ul aliquots and analyzed at A260 using a Bio-Rad SmartSpec 3000. A single peak of A260 absorbance in the bottom portion of the gradient was analyzed as polysome fraction.

LLWO2F cells were induced with doxycycline (2 ug/ml) for 24 hr. Negative control LLWO2F cells were not induced with doxycycline. For total RNA experiments, RNA was harvested from monolayered cells using QIAshredder and Qiagen RNeasy mini-kit. Polysome RNA was recovered from polysome fractions by first diluting fractions in 3.5 volumes of lysis buffer from the Qiagen RNeasy mini-kit and then continuing with the manufacturer's instructions. RNA was quantitated by UV spectrometry. 1 ug total RNA (or 200 ng polysome RNA) was used in first strand cDNA synthesis using SUPERSCRIPT II reverse transcriptase (Life Technologies) following manufacturer's instructions. cDNA was extracted by one phenol chloroform:isoamyl alcohol extraction followed by one chloroform isoamyl alcohol extraction and then ethanol precipitated. cDNA was resuspended in 20 ul water and used in a 30-cycle PCR reaction with 1 uM of each of the following four primers: {CCACGCTGTTTTGACCTCCATAGAAGACAC, CACATAGTCCCCCAGAAAGAGGTAGTTGCT}, in which product only forms from 6His-HA-PP1alpha cDNA, and {GACGCGGGCAAGCAGTCCCTCGAGACCATTGCCTGCTG, CTGGAGACCCACGACCTGGCCTGCCGTTG}, in which product only forms from endogenous PP1alpha cDNA. Reaction also contained 200 uM dNTPs, 1 mM Mg++, and 5 units Taq DNA polymerase (Life Technologies) with supplied reaction buffer. 2 ul of the PCR product was loaded onto a 1% agarose gel containing ethidium bromide for UV visualization.
