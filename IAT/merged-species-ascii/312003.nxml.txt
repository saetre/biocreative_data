Several cDNA clones were isolated from cDNA libraries constructed with mRNA longer than 28S RNA from the murine cell line PYS-2/12. The plasmids have inserts containing 1-1.2 kb of the ribosomal 5' external transcribed spacer followed by nearly 700 nt of sequence for 18S rRNA and ending with a B2 element (retroposon). The cloned sequence differed in a few positions from published ribosomal sequences. The 3' adjacent genomic sequence was obtained by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and showed that the B2 element has a poly(A) tail of about 50 nt and is surrounded by perfect direct repeats of 15 nt. Analysis of genomic DNA from several murine cell lines revealed that PYS cells contain at least one copy of 18S RNA with the B2 element which is not present in the genome of other murine cell lines derived from the same teratocarcinoma. Similarly, rRNA transcripts containing the B2 element were only detected in PYS cells. According to the publication dates of the different cell lines, the B2 element must have been integrated into an rRNA transcription unit during the years 1970 through 1974 thus proving that retroposons (SINEs) can still be inserted into the genome in our times.
