Fas and FasL is important mediators of apoptosis. We have previously reported that the stress levels of corticosterone (CORT, glucocorticoid in rat) increase expression of Fas/FasL and activate Fas/FasL signal pathway in rat Leydig cells, which consequently leads to apoptosis. Moreover, our another study showed that nuclear factor of activated T-cells (NFAT) may play a potential role in up-regulation of FasL during CORT-treated rat Leydig cell. It is not clear yet how NFAT is involved in CORT-induced up-regulation of FasL. The aim of the present study is to investigate the molecular mechanisms of NFAT-mediated FasL expression in CORT-treated Leydig cells.

Western blot analysis showed that NFAT2 expression is present in mouse Leydig tumor cell (mLTC-1). CORT-induced increase in FasL expression in mLTC-1 was ascertained by Western Blot analysis and CORT-induced increase in apoptotic frequency of mLTC-1 cells was detected by FACS with annexin-V labeling. Confocal imaging of NFAT2-GFP in mLTC-1 showed that high level of CORT stimulated NFAT translocation from the cytoplasm to the nucleus. RNA interference-mediated knockdown of NFAT2 significantly attenuated CORT-induced up-regulation of FasL expression in mLTC. These results corroborated our previous finding that NFAT2 is involved in CORT-induced FasL expression in rat Leydig cells and showed that mLTC-1 is a suitable model for investigating the mechanism of CORT-induced FasL expression. The analysis of reporter constructs revealed that the sequence between -201 and +71 of mouse FasL gene is essential for CORT-induced FasL expression. The mutation analysis demonstrated that CORT-induced FasL expression is mediated via an NFAT binding element located in the -201 to +71 region. Co-transfection studies with an NFAT2 expression vector and reporter construct containing -201 to +71 region of FasL gene showed that NFAT2 confer a strong inducible activity to the FasL promoter at its regulatory region. In addition, chromatin immunoprecipitation assay further confirmed the results of reporter gene studies by showing the specific binding of NFAT2 to the -201 to +71 region.

Fas and its ligand FasL are a pair of trans-membrane proteins critically involved in apoptosis. Fas is expressed in many types of tissues, whereas FasL expression is more restricted [1]. FasL expression is predominantly found in activated T cells. However, its expression is also reported in and outside of the immune system, such as NK cells, macrophages and Sertoli cells in testis [2-6].

In male mammalian, the sexual hormone testosterone is secreted by Leydig cells in testis. We have recently demonstrated that the high levels of corticosterone (CORT, glucocorticoid in rat) that are typically achieved during stress induce apoptotic death of Leydig cells and the activation of the Fas/FasL system, cleavage of procaspase-3, loss of mitochondrial membrane potential and increased ROS generation are all implicated in the process of CORT-induced Leydig cell death [7-9]. But the mechanism of FasL expression regulation in CORT-mediated Leydig cell apoptosis is unclear. Transcriptional regulation of FasL expression is a complicated process, which could be involved in a variety of transcriptional factors [10]. It was known that FasL expression is dependent on nuclear factor of activated T-cells (NFAT) in T lymphocyte. In our another study, it was found that the expression of FasL was increased in 100 nM CORT-treated rat Leydig cells and the increased expression could be alleviated by NFAT inhibitor CsA. Meanwhile, Western blot analysis of NFAT protein in the cytoplasm and nuclei demonstrated that NFAT was activated by CORT treatment [11]. These results indicated that NFAT is involved in CORT-induced FasL expression in Leydig cells, but the molecular basis for this process is not clear yet. Therefore, the present study is dedicated to investigate how NFAT be involved in regulation of FasL transcription.

For assay of FasL mRNA in mLTC-1 cells, a total RNA were extracted from the cells. A signigicantly increased level of FasL mRNA was found in mLTC-1 cells treated with CORT (Fig. 2.A). To further assay the product of FasL expression in mLTC-1 cells subjected to 100 nM CORT treatment, the lysates from mLTC-1 cells were examined by Western blotting. As predicted, immunoblotting with anti-FasL antibody revealed the expression of a band with a M.W about 40 kDa (Fig 2.B). Taken together, these results indicate that CORT increase expression of FasL in mLTC-1 cells. To analyze the effect of CsA in CORT-induced FasL expression. mLTC-1 cells were treated with 100 nM CORT and 100 ng/ml CsA for 12 h followed by detection of FasL mRNA with RT-PCR and FasL protein with immunoblotting. As shown in Fig. 2A, B, the addition of CsA alleviated CORT-induced up-regulation of FasL expression.

The RT-PCR and Western blotting were used to evaluate the efficiency of siRNA on NFAT2 expression. After transfection of mLTC-1 cells with siRNA targeted to NFAT2, expression of NFAT2 is specifically abrogated compared with the control siRNA (Fig. 3A, B). To determine whether NFAT2 is responsible for FasL expression in mLTC-1 cells, FasL expression were also detected by RT-PCR and Western blotting. As shown in Fig. 3C, D, FasL expression is decreased in siRNA-transfected mLTC-1 cells, whereas control siRNA-transfected cells were not affected.

To determine whether CORT induces nuclear translocation of NFAT2, plasmids expressing a NFAT2-GFP fusion protein were transfected into mLTC-1 followed by CORT or CORT plus CsA treatment. As shown in Fig. 4, NFAT2-GFP was distributed evenly throughout the cytoplasm in Control cells. After CORT treatment, NFAT2-GFP translocate to the nucleus, which was blocked by NFAT inhibitor CsA. These results suggest that high level of CORT induces nuclear translocation of NFAT in mLTC.

To determine whether CORT regulates FasL promoter activity, FasL-P689 reporter construct was used to transiently transfect mLTC-1 cells. Fig. 5A shows schematically the -618 to +71 bp 5' regulatory region of FasL promoter (FasL689) and the -618 to +71 bp FasL luciferase construct (FasL-P689). As shown in Fig. 5B, CORT induced a 6-fold increase in luciferase activity over untreated cells. This result suggests that CORT treatment enhanced FasL transcriptional activity in mLTC-1 cells. These data show that the -618- +71 region is sufficient for CORT-mediated activation of FasL expression.

To localize the promoter regions responsive to CORT-induced FasL expression and define the minimal functional region, a detailed 5' deletion analysis of -618 to +71 bp region was undertaken with FasL-P689, FasL-P329, FasL-P272, FasL-P238, FasL-P209, FasL-P138. These constructs were transiently transfected into mLTC-1 cells followed by 100 nM CORT treatment. As shown in Fig. 6, a significantly increased luciferase activity was presence in FasL-P689, FasL-P329 and FasL-P272. FasL-P272 showed the maximal promoter activity and minimal 5' regulation region among these constructs. These data suggest that the 272 bp sequence might be the regulatory elements that respond to CORT-induced signaling and served as a basis for mutational analysis.

Figure 6 shows that there are two NFAT site in the 272 bp sequence. The transcription activity of FasL-P272 is several times higher than that of FasL-P238. We infer that the distal NFAT site is more important than the proximal NFAT site. To further determine the function of NFAT at 272 bp sequence, the mutant FasL-P272 constructs (FasL-P272m), in which a mutation was introduced at the distal NFAT site, was used in transient tranfection assays. It was observed that up to 80% of luciferase activity indicating FasL promoter activity was lost after the mutant construct was transiently transfected into mLTC-1 cells followed by 100 nM CORT treatment. mLTC-1 cells were transfected with the FasL-P272m (Fig. 7). This observation indicates that the GGCGGAAA sequence (NFAT binding site) is the critical site for FasL promoter activity in CORT-treated mLTC-1 cells.

To further establish that whether the NFAT directly activates FasL promoter, cotransfection with the NFAT expression vector pcDNA3.1-NFAT and FasL-P272 were conducted in mLTC-1 cells. pcDNA3.1-NFAT is under the control of pcDNA3.1. pcDNA3.1-NFAT with FasL-P272 induced potent promoter activity. However, co-transfection of pcDNA3.1-NFAT with FasL-P272m induced little promoter activity (Fig. 8).

The receptor-ligand pair of Fas and FasL mediates apoptosis in a wide variety of different cell populations. The importance of these interactions has been convincingly demonstrated in murine and humans possessing loss of function mutations in either molecule [15-18]. The biological importance of FasL has been highlighted recently by work demonstrating its critical role in both activation-induced cell death in T cells and in the maintenance of immune privilege within certain tissues [19-21]. However, relatively little is known about factors that regulate inducible expression of FasL outside of the immune system. Our previous studies established a critical role for FasL in Leydig cell via its action in CORT-induced apoptosis. We are the first to demonstrate that involvement of NFAT on regulation of FasL expression in CORT-induced Leydig cell apoptosis [11]. But the molecular mechanisms of NFAT-mediated up-regulation of FasL expression in CORT-induced Leydig cell apoptosis are unknown. Regulation of FasL expression is a complicated process, which could be involved in a variety of trascriptional factors including NFAT, SP1, early growth response gene (Egr) and so on. The NFAT family of transcription factors is composed of four family members NFAT1, NFAT2, NFAT3 and NFAT4, and is best known for its role in the regulation of the T cell immune response [22-27]. The principal function of NFAT in T cells is to couple stimulation of the T cell antigen receptor to changes in the expression of a number of cytokine and other immunologically important genes. NFAT are regulated primarily at the level of their subcellular localization through the actions of serine/threonine phosphatase calcineurin (CaN). In resting cells, NFAT family members are normally located in the cytoplasm in a hyperphosphorylated latent form. However, following activated CaN directly dephosphorylates NFAT proteins, nuclear import and increased intrinsic DNA binding activity occur, which could be specially inhibited by CsA. Once located in the nucleus, NFAT are then free to bind to their target promoter elements and activate the transcription of specific NFAT target genes, either alone or in combination with other nuclear partners.

This aspect of NFAT regulation is likely to be significant, since both the extent and duration of NFAT activity have recently been shown to influence the qualitative pattern of NFAT-dependent gene expression induced during T cell activation [28]. The NFAT signaling pathway is certainly best known for its role in the regulation of the immune response. The NFAT is expressed in many cell types and contributes to diverse cellular functions [22,29-34]. Therefore, it has become increasingly apparent that this pathway also plays an important role in the regulation of a wide variety of cellular responses in a number of other tissues.

Our recent study had verified that NFAT was involved in CORT-induced expression of FasL in rat Leydig cells [11]. Owing to relatively little is known about NFAT regulation of FasL expression outside of the immune system, no doubt, it is very interesting to observe whether NFAT regulate FasL expression through affection FasL promotor activation in CORT-treated Leydig cells.

In the present study, mLTC-1 were selected as cell model due to its suitability for transfection. Although it is widely accepted that mLTC-1 is a favorable model for study on biology of Leydig cells, we validated firstly that CORT-induced up-regulation of FasL expression is also present in mLTC-1 by RT-PCR and Western blotting analysis. Western blotting analysis showed NFAT2 is the predominant isoform in mLTC. However, other members of NFAT family, i. e. NFAT1, NFAT3 and NFAT4 exprssion is very low compared to NFAT2 in mLTC-1 (our unpublished data). It was also shown that NFAT2-GFP chimeric protein translocated from cytoplasm to nuclus after CORT treatment and siRNA-mediated silencing of NFAT decreased the extent of CORT-induced FasL expression. These results were in accord with our finding in rat Leydig cells, i.e. high level CORT activates Fas/FasL signal pathway through activation of NFAT.

Previous studies from other investigators suggested the presence of multiple elements at -689 bp at 5' untranslated region of FasL promoter, which is capable of enhancing transcriptional activity of the FasL promoter in T cells [35]. Furthermore, we predicated the transcription start site and transcription factor binding sites on FasL promoter by analyzing the sequence of FasL 5' untranslated region through online-based computer program. Based on these messages, the -689 bp at 5' untranslated region of FasL promoter was selected as an object to observe NFAT regulation of FasL promoter activity in present study. In order to elucidate the mechanism of CORT-triggered up-regulation of FasL expression in CORT-treated Leydig cells, we cloned -689 bp (-618- +71) at 5' untranslated region of FasL promoter and found that the -618- +71 region is available and sufficient for further establishment of mechanisms of NFAT-triggered FasL expression in CORT-treated Leydig cells.

The data presented in this paper firstly suggested that activity of FasL promoter (at -689 bp sequences) was enhanced in CORT-treated mLTC. To establish the minimal function region on FasL promoter which is interaction with NFAT, we synthesized a series of 5' deletion constructs and tested their transcriptional activities in response to CORT treatment. It was firstly found the presence of a high active site situated between -201- +71 (Fig. 8). Our present data showed that there are two NFAT binding sites between -201-+71 region (with total 272 bp) and only one NFAT binding site between -167-+71 region (with total 238 bp). The 272 bp showed the maximal activation in whole FasL promotor sequences. Latinis et al. reported that the binding of NFAT to the GGAAA site on FasL active core sequence is critical for triggering FasL promoter activity [36]. So this specific short sequence was selected as mutated site in present experiment. It was found that the mutated sequence significantly resulted in an inhibition of FasL promoter activity following the nucleotides sequence was mutated. Finally, co-transfection experiments with the NFAT expression vector and FasL promoter with report gene further showed that NFAT enhanced transcriptional activity of FasL promoter by interaction with its -272 bp DNA sequence, thereby regulating FasL promoter activity in CORT-treated Leydig cells. In addition, mutation at -272 bp DNA sequence also resulted in an inhibition of transcriptional activity of FasL promoter in co-transfection experiments. Furthermore, the ChIP result further confirms that NFAT directly bind to FasL promoter sequence in vivo.

Our present findings provide further insight into the mechanisms involved on the regulation of the FasL expression in response to CORT treatment in Leydig cells. In summary, the mechanisms of transcriptional regulation of FasL expression in CORT-treated mLTC-1 is an activation on transcription factor NFAT. The active transcription factor interact with specific NFAT target genes in FasL promoter sequence at -201 to +71 region, thereby regulating FasL expression.

Adult Leydig cells were isolated from the 90-day-old rats according to the procedure of Sriraman et al. [12], which is a modification of the procedure described by Klinefelter et al. [13]. The decapsulated testes were subjected to collagenase digestion in a 50 mL plastic tube containing 10 mL medium with collagenase (600 units) and DNase (750 units). The tubes were placed in a shaking water bath and constantly agitated (50 times/min) at 34degreesC for 15-20 min until the seminiferous tubules were separated. The enzyme action was terminated by adding excess medium. The tubules were allowed to settle by gravity and the medium, consisting of interstitial cells, was aspirated and filtered through a 100 mum nylon mesh. The filtrate was centrifuged at 250 x g for 10 min at 25degreesC, which yielded a crude interstitial pellet. The pellet obtained was suspended in 35 mL 55% isotonic Percoll with 750 units DNase in Oakridge tubes. The tubes were centrifuged at 20 000 x g for 1 h at 4degreesC. Percoll fractions corresponding to densities of 1.070-1.090 g/mL were collected and the cells present in this fraction were pelleted down by centrifugation at 250 x g for 10 min at 25degreesC after diluting it with 3-4 volumes of the medium. The purities of the isolated cell fractions were evaluated by histochemical staining for 3beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase activity, with 0.4 nm etiocholanolone as the steroid substrate [14]. The enrichment of the Leydig cells was up to a purity of 85% on average.

Annexin-V binds to those cells that express phosphotidylserine on the outer layer of the cell membrane, and PI stains the cellular DNA of cells with a compromised cell membrane. This allows for the discrimination between live cells (unstained with either fluorochrome) from apoptotic cells (stained only with annexin-V) and necrotic cells (stained with both annexin-V and PI).
