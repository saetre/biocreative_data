Polymorphisms within the insulin gene can influence insulin expression in the pancreas and especially in the thymus, where self-antigens are processed, shaping the T cell repertoire into selftolerance, a process that protects from beta-cell autoimmunity.

Type 1 diabetes (T1D) has a multifactorial pathogenesis, partly caused by environment but also by genetic predisposition. The association of the MHC class II genes with T1D is well known, but there are also non- MHC genes such as the insulin gene, that confer susceptibility to T1D [1].

The insulin gene is transcribed upon binding of the transcription factor Pur1 to the promoter element, known as the variable number of tandem repeat (VNTR) region, located 596 bp upstream of the insulin gene translation initiation site. The VNTR region comprises variable 14-15 bp tandem repeat sequences with the consensus 5'-ACAGGGGTGTGGGG-3', also named the insulin gene minisatellite. In Caucasians there are two main classes of the VNTR region minisatellites named class I and class III alleles. The VNT

R class I alleles, which are associated with increased susceptibility to T1D, comprise between 26 and 63 repeat units and are shorter than class III alleles (between 141 and 209 repeat units), associated with dominant protection. The class II alleles are very rare in Caucasians but common in Africans [2-5].

Polymorphisms within the insulin gene are in linkage disequilibrium with the VNTR region and can therefore be used as markers for these gene variants. The allele "C" of the -2221 MspI polymorphism of the insulin promoter region has been shown to be in strong linkage with the class I allele of the VNTR region and the variant "T" with the class III alleles [6,7]. Therefore this polymorphism can be used as a marker for this gene segment [8].

Recent studies of the insulin gene locus showed the -23HphI (A/T) and the +1140 (A/C) polymorphisms to confer the strongest susceptibility to T1D [4,9]. Furthermore polymorphisms of the insulin gene are associated with different regulation of insulin expression in target tissues such as the pancreas and especially in the thymus, where the expression of self-antigens shapes and maintains a self tolerant T cell repertoire [10,11].

T1D and Addison's disease (AD) may occur in the same patient to form a polyglandular syndrome type II (APS-II) [12]. Although the precise function of the VNTR is uncertain, it is conceivable that through its potential effect on the thymic expression level of insulin, the VNTR could affect the development of immune self tolerance not only to antigenic peptides derived from insulin but also to other endocrine targets: this could occur through local insulin signalling by affecting other genes' expression levels thereby leading to differences in thymic expression levels of thyroid or other endocrine antigens. Therefore the VNTR region could confer susceptibility not only to T1D but also to other autoimmune endocrine disease such as Addison's disease (AD), Hashimoto's thyroiditis (HT) or Graves' disease (GD) by causing an abnormal thymic tolerance [13].

Addison's disease was diagnosed by primary adrenal failure without evidence of tuberculosis or adrenoleukodystrophy. Adrenal autoantibodies were detected with indirect immunofluorescence on cryostat sections; these were confirmed to be directed against 21-hydroxylase in a subgroup of patients by radioimmunoassay.

Therefore our data are in line with previous reports, which found that the -2221 MspI SNP and the -23HphI SNP are associated with T1D, where the -2221 MspI SNP was only part of a susceptibility insulin gene haplotype and the -23HphI SNP was found with the strongest association to T1D [4,9].

Other studies found no evidence of excessive transmission of the -23HphI polymorphism (equivalent to VNTR class I) in patients with GD [19]. Also no association was demonstrated of INS VNTR in patients with celiac disease and AD from a Basque population [20]. Thus our present study supports those findings suggesting that neither the -2221 MspI nor the -23HphI polymorphisms are associated with isolated AD, HT or with GD as part of the APS-II.

Class III alleles of the insulin VNTR region are associated with substantially higher insulin mRNA levels than VNTR class I in the thymus presumably, causing a more efficient deletion of insulin autoreactive T cells [13], explaining their protective effect on T1D. On the other hand the "C" allele of -2221 MspI has been associated with a decreased insulin expression in the thymus, leading to less efficient deletion of autoreactive insulin-specific T-cells [10]. This may increase the risk to develop T1D. Likewise the protective effect of the "T" [2] allele could lead to higher level of insulin transcription.

This association appears to be confined to patients with T1D only and larger numbers are needed to rule out an effect in patients with other immune components of T1D associated with the APS-II. So far this locus may help to differentiate the susceptibility to isolated T1D in comparison to T1D predisposition loci that are shared with endocrine autoimmune disorders.

We demonstrate the allele "C" of the -2221MspI and "A" of the -23HphI polymorphisms within the insulin region confer susceptibility to T1D but not to isolated AD, HT or as a part of the APS-II.

ER-L and BL carried out the genotyping of the patients and controls. MP-M carried out the re-genotyping of the patients and controls to confirm the accuracy of the method. HK participated in the statistical analysis GM, HSW, NR, SH and JS made the diagnosis and collaborated in collection of samples. HK carried out statistical analysis. ER-L and KB conceptualized and designed the study.
