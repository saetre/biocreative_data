Using synthetic oligodeoxyribonucleotides to prime the transcription of interferon mRNA and cDNA, we recently determined the mRNA sequence coding for the 47 amino-terminal amino acids of mature human fibroblast interferon (1). From this sequence, we have now synthesised an oligodeoxyribonucleotide that is homologous with the mRNA sequence coding for amino acids 42-45 and used it as a primer to selectively transcribe an interferon cDNA template. The sequence of the newly synthesised DNA predicted the sequence of amino acids 48-109 in the interferon polypeptide. By repeating this process with one more primer, we have determined the complete amino acid sequence of mature human fibroblast interferon, a polypeptide of 166 amino acids.
