The complete sequence analysis of the E. coli genome was initiated as a collaborative study in Japan. Following the initial analysis of the 0-2.4 min region (Yura, T. et al. (1992) Nucleic Acids Res. 20, 3305-3308), a contiguous sequence of 82,727 bp corresponding to the 2.4-4.1 min region (110,917-193,643 bp as counted from 0 min) was determined. The resulting sequence was found to contain at least 33 known genes and 24 putative genes predicted from protein sequence homology.
