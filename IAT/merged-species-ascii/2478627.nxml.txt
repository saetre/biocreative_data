The authors have determined that epineurial arterioles of the sciatic nerve are innervated by nonadrenergic, noncholinergic nerves that contribute to the regulation of vasodilation. Using immunohistochemistry, the authors determined that nerves innervating epineurial arterioles contain the neuropeptide calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP). Using streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats, the authors demonstrated that CGRP content in sensory nerves innervating epineurial arterioles and vasodilation in response to exogenous CGRP was decreased. In summary, epineurial arterioles of the sciatic nerve are innervated by sensory nerves containing the neuropeptide CGRP. The diabetes-like condition induced by streptozotocin reduces the content of CGRP in these nerves and exogenous CGRPmediated vasodilation. CGRP is likely an important regulator of vascular tone and compromising its function could contribute to nerve ischemia and diabetic neuropathy.
