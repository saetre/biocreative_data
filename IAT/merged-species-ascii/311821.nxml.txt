Complementary DNAs encoding mouse liver insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) have been isolated and sequenced. Alternative RNA splicing results in the synthesis of two types of mouse IGF-I precursor that differ in the size and sequence of the COOH-terminal peptide. The sequences of the signal peptides, IGF-I moieties and the first 16 amino acids of the COOH-terminal peptides or E-domains of the two precursors are identical. The sequence difference results from the presence in preproIGF-IB mRNA of a 52 base insertion which introduces a 17 amino acid segment into the COOH-terminal peptide of preproIGF-IB and also causes a shift in the reading frame of the mRNA. As a consequence of this insertion, the COOH-terminal 19 and 25 amino acids of mouse preproIGF-IA and -IB, respectively, are different. The sequences of mouse and human preproIGF-IA are highly conserved and possess 94% identity. In contrast, the sequences of mouse and human preproIGF-IB are quite different in the region of the COOH-terminal peptide. A comparison of the sequences of mouse and human preproIGF-IB mRNA indicates that they are generated by different molecular mechanisms.
