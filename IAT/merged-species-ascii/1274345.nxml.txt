TGF-beta is a multifunctional growth factor involved in regulating a variety of cellular activities. Unlike mammals, the function of TGF-beta in the reproduction of lower vertebrates, such as fish, is not clear. Recently, we showed that TGF-beta1 inhibits gonadotropin- and 17alpha, 20beta-dihydroxyprogesterone (DHP)-induced maturation in zebrafish. The aim of the present study was to investigate the mechanisms underlying this action.

Method

###begin p 5
To determine if the effect of TGF-beta1 on oocyte maturation involves transcription and/or translation, ovarian follicles were pre-treated with actinomycin D, a blocker of transcription, and cyclohexamide, an inhibitor of translation, and incubated with hCG or DHP, either alone or in combination with TGF-beta1 and oocyte maturation scored. To determine the effect of TGF-beta1 on mRNA levels of several key effectors of oocyte maturation, three sets of experiments were performed. First, follicles were treated with control medium or TGF-beta1 for 2, 6, 12, and 24 h. Second, follicles were treated with different concentrations of TGF-beta1 (0 to 10 ng/ml) for 18 h. Third, follicles were incubated with hCG in the absence or presence of TGF-beta1 for 18 h. At the end of each experiment, total RNA was extracted and reverse transcribed. PCR using primers specific for 20beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (20beta-HSD) which is involved in DHP production, follicle stimulating hormone receptor (FSHR), luteinizing hormone receptor (LHR), the two forms of membrane progestin receptor: mPR-alpha and mPR-beta, as well as GAPDH (control), were performed.

Treatment with actinomycin D, a blocker of transcription, reduced the inhibitory effect of TGF-beta1 on DHP-induced oocyte maturation, indicating that the inhibitory action of TGF-beta1 is in part due to regulation of gene transcription. Treatment with TGF-beta1 caused a dose and time-dependent decrease in mRNA levels of 20beta-HSD, LHR and mPR-beta in follicles. On the other hand, TGF-beta1 had no effect on mPR-alpha mRNA expression and increased FSHR mRNA levels. Furthermore, hCG upregulated 20beta-HSD, LHR and mPR-beta mRNA levels, but this stimulatory effect was blocked by TGF-beta1.

Transforming Growth Factor-beta1 (TGF-beta1) is the prototypical member of the TGF-beta family [1,2]. Members of this family are implicated in diverse physiological processes, including reproduction. Three isoforms of TGF-beta (TGF-beta1, -beta2, and -beta3) are expressed in the mammalian ovary [2-4]. They have been shown to regulate follicle development, steroidogenesis, oocyte maturation, ovulation and follicular atresia [2-4]. There is molecular evidence for the presence of TGF-beta1-3 in fish [5-7]. However, the role of TGF-beta in fish reproduction is not well understood. Studies in zebrafish have suggested that TGF-beta inhibits oocyte maturation [8]. In the goldfish, TGF-beta has been reported to inhibit ovarian steroid production [9].

Ovarian development in fish is broadly divided into two major phases: growth and maturation. During oocyte growth, follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) stimulates production of estradiol-17beta from the ovary. Estradiol-17beta stimulates the production of vitellogenin by the liver. Vitellogenin is taken up by the developing oocyte and cleaved to yolk protein, which serves as a nutritional reserve for the developing embryo [8,10,11]. Oocyte maturation in teleosts is triggered by the release of leutinizing hormone (LH) from the pituitary. LH stimulates a number of signaling cascades culminating in the production of 17alpha-hydroxyprogesterone (17alpha-HP). In the granulosa cells, under the action of 20beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (20beta-HSD), 17alpha-HP is converted to 17alpha, 20beta-dihydroxyprogesterone (DHP), the maturation inducing hormone (MIH) in cyprinids, such as zebrafish and goldfish. MIH activates the cytoplasmic maturation promoting factor (MPF), which is made up of two subunits: cyclin B (a regulatory subunit) and cdc2 (a catalytic subunit). MIH stimulates the de novo synthesis of cyclin B. Cyclin B protein binds to cdc2 to form MPF. The newly formed MPF is activated by phosphorylation of cdc2 on threonine 161. The active MPF, then, stimulates all the changes associated with oocyte maturation, such as germinal vesicle break down (GVBD), spindle formation, chromosome condensation and allows the transition from G2/M phase of meiosis [12-15].

Two isoforms of the MIH receptor, designated as membrane progestin receptor-alpha (mPR-alpha) and mPR-beta, have recently been cloned in zebrafish [16]. Microinjection of zebrafish oocytes with antisense oligonucleotides to either mPR-alpha or mPR-beta or both receptors has been shown to block MIH-induced maturation, indicating that both play a role in zebrafish oocyte maturation [17]. Originally discovered in sea-trout oocytes, several isoforms of mPR have also been discovered in humans and other vertebrates [16-20].

The zebrafish model has been used extensively for studies on early embryonic development. This model is also very useful for the investigation of ovarian follicle development and maturation because the zebrafish ovary contains ovarian follicles at different stages of development. We and others have been using zebrafish to examine the role of TGF-beta superfamily in oocyte maturation [8,21-23]. Our previous work has shown that TGF-beta1 inhibits human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) and MIH-induced maturation in zebrafish [8]. We have also observed a decrease in TGF-beta1 mRNA expression in maturing follicles. These findings suggest that TGF-beta1 may play a role in preventing premature oocyte maturation in zebrafish. The present study is an attempt to elucidate the mechanisms underlying the inhibitory effect of TGF-beta1 by identifying the potential target genes of TGF-beta1. We report here our recent findings on the effect of TGF-beta1 on the important effectors of oocyte maturation in zebrafish, including: 20beta-HSD, LHR, mPR-alpha, and mPR-beta.

Female zebrafish that have a full-grown ovary were anesthetized using 3-aminobenzoicacid ethyl ester (Sigma-Aldrich Canada Inc., Oakville, ON) and decapitated. The ovaries were removed and follicles greater than 0.52 mm in diameter were collected, since previous studies in the zebrafish have shown that only follicles of this size can undergo maturation in vitro in response to hormones [21]. Approximately 20 follicles were placed into each well of a 24-well culture plate and pre-treated at 26degreesC in either 1 ml of modified Cortland's medium (MCM) or MCM + chemicals such as Actinomycin D or Cyclohexamide (Sigma-Aldrich, Mississauga, ON) for 2 hours. Pre-treated follicles were then incubated with the control medium, human recombinant TGF-beta1 (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN), hCG (kindly provided by Dr. A. F. Parlow, National Hormone and Peptide Program, Torrance, CA), MIH (17alpha, 20beta-DHP;Sigma-Aldrich Canada), either alone or in combination, as previously described [8]. Maturation was scored after 18 hours of incubation. Follicles that underwent germinal vesicle breakdown (GVBD) could be identified by their acquired translucency.

Five micrograms of total RNA were reverse transcribed to cDNA at 37degreesC for 1.5 h in a total volume of 50 mul as previously described [21]. PCR was carried out in the presence of 10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.3), 50 mM KCl, 2.0 mM MgCl2, 50 muM deoxynucleotide triphosphate, 1U Hotstar Taq (Qiagen) and 5 pmol primers. The primers for 20beta-HSD, FSHR, LHR, mPR-alpha and mPR-beta were designed according to the sequences from GenBank (Table 1). The semi-quantitative RT-PCR was validated by peforming PCR reactions for different cycles to determine the cycle number that generated half maximal PCR product for each gene studied. PCR was carried out on an Eppendorf Master Cycler (Eppendorf AG, Hamburg, Germany) with the cycling profile: 20 s at 94degreesC, 30 s at 60-65degreesC (depending on the primer sets used), 30 s at 72degreesC followed by a 7-minute final extension at 72degreesC. The PCR products were electrophoresed on 1.5% agarose gels and visualized by ethidium bromide staining. The spot density of each PCR product was determined using the Fluorchem v2.0 Software (Alpha Innotech Corporation, San Leandro, CA). GAPDH was used as an internal control to normalize the variation in mRNA concentration in the RT reaction. The mRNA level of each gene was first normalized with the GAPDH level and then expressed as percent of the control.

To determine if the effect of TGF-beta on oocyte maturation requires transcription and/or translation, follicles were pretreated with cyclohexamide, an inhibitor of translation, or actinomycin D, an inhibitor of transcription. Pretreatment with cyclohexamide completely blocked hCG- and MIH-induced oocyte maturation. Pretreatment with actinomycin D blocked hCG-, but not MIH-, induced oocyte maturation (Fig. 1A). Interestingly, the inhibitory effect of TGF-beta1 on MIH-induced maturation was partially reversed in the presence of actinomycin D (Fig. 1B), suggesting that the inhibitory effect of TGF-beta1 on oocyte maturation involves in part transcriptional regulation.

Semi-quantitative RT-PCR assays were developed to examine the effect of TGF-beta1 on the mRNA expression of 20beta-HSD, FSHR, LHR, mPR-alpha and mPR-beta. PCR assays were performed using ovarian cDNA as template for varying cycle numbers and spot densities of the resulting products were measured. A cycle number within the exponential phase of the amplification curve was chosen for quantifying the expression of each gene in subsequent experiments. Accordingly, 20, 23, 30, 31, 33 and 32 cycles of PCR for GAPDH, 20beta-HSD, FSHR, LHR, mPR-alpha and mPR-beta, respectively, were selected as the optimal cycle numbers for measuring the levels of mRNA expression (Fig. 2).

To test whether TGF-beta1 affects the mRNA expression of 20beta-HSD, a time course study was performed where follicles were treated with 10 ng/ml of TGF-beta1 for 2, 6, 12 and 24 hours. A set of untreated follicles was included for each time point as controls. Total RNA was extracted and RT-PCRs were performed. A time-dependant decrease in 20beta-HSD mRNA expression relative to control levels was found in TGF-beta1 treated follicles. A significant inhibitory effect was observed at 24 hours of treatment (Fig. 3A). A dose-response study was performed where follicles were treated with increasing doses of TGF-beta1 (0, 0.1, 1 and 10 ng/ml) for 18 hours. Total RNA was extracted from each set of treated follicles and subjected to RT-PCR analyses. A dose-dependant decrease in 20beta-HSD expression in response to TGF-beta1 treatment was found (Fig. 3B). The strongest inhibition was seen upon treatment with 10 ng/ml of TGF-beta1. Finally, the combinational effect of hCG and TGF-beta1 on 20beta-HSD mRNA expression was tested. Follicles were incubated with control medium, hCG (100 IU/ml), TGF-beta1 (10 ng/ml), or hCG plus TGF-beta1, for 18 hours. Treatment with hCG resulted in an increase in 20beta-HSD mRNA levels. However, treatment with TGF-beta1 decreased basal and hCG-induced 20beta-HSD mRNA levels (Fig. 3C).

Treatment with TGF-beta1 resulted in a significant increase in FSHR mRNA levels from 6 to 18 hours after treatment, with the maximal stimulation at 12 hours post treatment (Fig. 4A, B). The stimulatory effect of TGF-beta1 on FSHR mRNA expression was observed for all doses tested (Fig. 4B). Treatment with hCG had no significant effect on basal FSHR mRNA expression when compared to the control (Fig. 4C). Similarly, hCG did not affect TGF-beta1-induced FSHR mRNA levels (Fig. 4C).

TGF-beta1 significantly decreased LHR mRNA expression at 18 and 24 hours after treatment, but had no effect at 2 to 12 hours post treatment (Fig. 5A, B). At 18 hours after treatment, TGF-beta1 inhibited LHR mRNA expression in a dose-dependant manner (Fig. 5B). Treatment with hCG increased LHR mRNA levels. However, when TGF-beta1 was added together with hCG, the stimulatory effect of hCG on LHR mRNA expression was blocked (Fig. 5C).

No significant effect of TGF-beta1 on mPR-alpha mRNA expression was observed. The time course study showed no significant difference in the mRNA expression of mPR-alpha at any of the time points examined (Fig. 6A). Similarly, treatment with different concentrations of TGF-beta1 for 18 hours did not result in a significant change in mPR-alpha mRNA levels (Fig. 6B). Neither hCG nor TGF-beta1 had a significant effect on mPR-alpha mRNA expression (Fig. 6C). In contrast to mPR-beta, similar treatment with TGF-beta1 resulted in a dose- and time-dependent inhibition of mPR-beta mRNA levels. The inhibitory effect was observed at 18 and 24 hours after treatment and all doses of TGF-beta1 tested caused a significant decrease in mPR-beta mRNA levels (Fig. 7A, B). Incubation of follicles with hCG resulted in a strong stimulation of mPR-beta mRNA expression. The stimulatory effect of hCG on mPR-beta mRNA expression of was partially blocked by TGF-beta1 (Fig. 7C).

Currently, little is known about the role of TGF-beta in regulating ovarian functions in lower vertebrates, such as fish. Recent studies have suggested that TGF-beta inhibits steroid production in the goldfish ovary [9] and oocyte maturation in zebrafish [8]. In the present study, we further examined the cellular mechanisms underlying the inhibitory effect of TGF-beta in oocyte maturation. We have shown that TGF-beta1 inhibits mRNA expression of 20beta-HSD, the key enzyme involved in MIH production, as well as LHR and mPR-beta. These novel findings suggest that TGF-beta1 inhibits multiple targets in the oocyte maturation pathway, both upstream and downstream of MIH.

One of the potential targets of TGF-beta1 identified in this study is 20beta-HSD. We found that TGF-beta1 inhibited basal and hCG-induced 20beta-HSD mRNA levels. TGF-beta1 alone induced a dose- and time-dependent inhibitory effect on 20beta-HSD mRNA expression. Treatment with hCG increased 20beta-HSD mRNA levels; however, in the presence of TGF-beta1, the effect of hCG was blocked. 20beta-HSD activity in the ovary and its stimulation by gonadotropins and cAMP-enhancing drugs has been demonstrated in many species [10,11,24-28]. Our finding that hCG stimulates 20beta-HSD is consistent with studies in mammals [24,28] and a recent study in Nile Tilapia, which reported an increase in the mRNA expression of 20beta-HSD in response to hCG treatment [26]. The observation of decreased 20beta-HSD mRNA levels after TGF-beta1 treatment suggests that TGF-beta1 may inhibit 20beta-HSD activity, leading to a decrease in MIH production. This notion is supported by a recent report that TGF-beta1 inhibits the conversion of 17alpha-HP to DHP in the goldfish [9]. It is possible that one of the actions of TGF-beta1 is to decreases MIH production, and thus inhibits oocyte maturation.

In this study, we observed that hCG increased LHR but had no effect on FSHR mRNA levels. Several studies conducted in fish on the effect of gonadotropin on LHR and FSHR expression have yielded inconsistent results. In African and Channel catfish, it has been reported that hCG treatment caused an activation of the LHR and cAMP mediated pathways, as well as a slight increase in FSHR mRNA levels [29-31]. However, a two-fold increase in FSHR expression, but no change in LHR expression in pre-maturational follicles of rainbow trout in response to treatment with partially purified gonadotropins has also been reported [32]. The reason for such discrepancy is unclear, however, it could be due to species specificity or variation in treatment conditions.

An interesting finding from this study is that TGF-beta1 differentially regulates FSHR and LHR mRNA levels. We observed that basal FSH receptor mRNA levels were increased, while basal- and hCG-induced LH receptor mRNA levels were decreased, upon incubation of follicles with TGF-beta1. TGF-beta1 has been reported to regulate LH and FSH binding sites in mammals, however, whether TGF-beta1 has a stimulatory or inhibitory effect appears to be species-dependant. TGF-beta1 decreased basal and FSH-induced LH binding sites in porcine granulosa cells but enhanced FSH-induced LH binding in rat granulosa cells [33]. FSH induced FSH binding in porcine granulosa cells and this effect was attenuated by TGF-beta1. On the other hand, FSH decreased its own binding levels in rat granulosa cells and this effect was also blocked by TGF-beta1 [33]. Our finding that TGF-beta1 increased FSHR mRNA levels is consistent with previous studies in rat granulosa cells [34,35]. However, our observation that TGF-beta1 decreased LHR mRNA levels is opposite to studies in rat [36] and chicken [37] granulosa cells. In these studies, it was reported that TGF-beta1 induced LHR mRNA expression. Whether this is due to species variation as in the case of rat and pig or to the difference in follicle development between fish and higher vertebrates awaits more studies in fish species. The finding that TGF-beta1 inhibited LHR mRNA expression suggests that the inhibitory effect of TGF-beta1 on hCG-induced oocyte maturation may be due, in part, to the downregulation of LH receptor by TGF-beta1. Since FSH is known to be a major regulator of oocyte growth [10,11], by stimulating FSH receptor expression TGF-beta1 may play a role in promoting follicle growth. These findings, together with our previous observation that TGF-beta1 mRNA levels are higher in growing follicles than in maturing follicles, suggest that TGF-beta1 may stimulate follicle development and inhibit precocious oocyte maturation in the zebrafish ovary. This possibility will be investigated further in the future.

A recent study has shown that microinjection of zebrafish oocytes with antisense oligonucleotides to either mPR-alpha or mPR-beta or both causes similar marked decreases in the rates of oocyte maturation, suggesting that both subtypes are obligatory for oocyte maturation in zebrafish [17]. In this study, we observed a strong induction of mPR-beta mRNA levels by hCG and an inhibitory effect of TGF-beta1 on both basal and hCG-induced mPR-beta mRNA expression. These findings support the role of mPR-beta in oocyte maturation and suggest that one of the mechanisms by which TGF-beta1 inhibits hCG- and MIH-induced oocyte maturation is by the downregulation of MIH receptors, specifically mPR-beta. However, we found that neither hCG nor TGF-beta1 had an effect of mPR-alpha mRNA levels, suggesting that the two membrane progestin receptors are under differential regulation. It has been reported that hCG caused an increase in the mPR protein expression in sea-trout oocytes [18]. The sea-trout mPR has a higher homology to mPR-alpha (80%) than to mPR-beta (46%). It remains to be determined if hCG regulates mPR-alpha and mPR-beta protein levels in the zebrafish. Recently, Kazeta et al. (2005) reported that hCG did not change mRNA levels of mPR-alpha and mPR-beta at 5 and 10 h after hCG treatment [38]. The difference between this and our studies may be due to the duration of hCG treatment as 18 h was used in our study.

Conclusion
###end title 53
###begin p 54
Based on our findings that TGF-beta1 downregulates basal and hCG-induced LHR, 20beta-HSD, and mPR-beta mRNA levels, we propose that TGF-beta1 acts upon multiple targets to exert its inhibitory effect on oocyte maturation. TGF-beta1 may downregulate LHR, leading to decreased signal transduction and decreased production of 17alpha-hydroxyprogesterone. TGF-beta1 may inhibit basal and gonadotropin-induced MIH production by inhibiting 20beta-HSD. Finally, TGF-beta1 may inhibit the expression of the MIH receptor, such as mPR-beta, on the oocyte surfaces, leading to a reduction of MPF activation and subsequent oocyte maturation. This model can be tested in the future by examining the protein levels on these molecules once antibodies become available. Similarly, the physiological significance of TGF-beta on oocyte maturation will be confirmed using loss-of-function approaches.
