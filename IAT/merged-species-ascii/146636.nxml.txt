The Cbp2 protein is encoded in the nucleus and is required for the splicing of the terminal intron of the mitochondrial COB gene in Saccharomyces cerevisiae . Using a yeast strain that lacks this intron but contains a related group I intron in the precursor of the large ribosomal RNA, we have determined that Cbp2 protein is also required for the normal accumulation of 21S ribosomal RNA in vivo . Such strains bearing a deletion of the CBP2 gene adapt slowly to growth in glycerol/ethanol media implying a defect in derepression. At physiologic concentrations of magnesium, Cbp2 stimulates the splicing of the ribosomal RNA intron in vitro . Nevertheless, Cbp2 is not essential for splicing of this intron in mitochondria nor is it required in vitro at magnesium concentrations >5 mM. A similar intron exists in the large ribosomal RNA (LSU) gene of Saccharomyces douglasii . This intron does need Cbp2 for catalytic activity in physiologic magnesium. Similarities between the LSU introns and COB intron 5 suggest that Cbp2 may recognize conserved elements of the these two introns, and protein-induced UV crosslinks occur in similar sites in the substrate and catalytic domains of the RNA precursors.
