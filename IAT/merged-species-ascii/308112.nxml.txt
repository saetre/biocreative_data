Heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein (hnRNP) A2 belongs, with A1, B1 and B2, to the basic protein subset of the hnRNP complex in mammalian cells. All these proteins share a modular structure consisting of two conserved RNA binding domains linked to less conserved Gly-rich domains (2xRBD-Gly). In the framework of our studies on the genetic basis of hnRNP proteins structure and diversity we have isolated and sequenced the A2 gene and compared it to the previously described A1 gene. The A2 gene, which exists in a single copy on Ch. 7 band p15, is split in 12 exons including an alternatively spliced 36 nt mini exon specific for the human hnRNP protein B1. In this work we show that the intron/exon organisation of the A2 gene is identical to that of the A1 gene over the entire length, indicating a common origin by gene duplication. Moreover the comparison of corresponding exons evidences significant conservation also in the apparently divergent Gly-rich domains that could define previously unenvisaged structural and/or functional motifs. The A2 gene promoter is also analysed in comparison to that of the A1 gene.
