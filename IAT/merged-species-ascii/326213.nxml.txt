The structure of Escherichia coli 5S RNA fragments 1-41 and 42-120 has been studied by the read-off gel sequencing technique using S1 nuclease and cobra venom RNase as probes. Comparison of the digestion patterns with those of reassociated and intact 5S RNA suggests that the structure of both fragments is very similar to that of the corresponding regions in the intact molecule. Six different fragments obtained by partial digestion with T1 RNase and S1 nuclease have been used for reconstitution of 5S RNA, its certain structural regions and complexes with ribosomal proteins L18 and L25 recognizes the double-helix consisting of nucleotides 79-97 (i.e. prokaryotic stem), whereas a loop-region around position 40 (possible positions 39-47) is involved in the interaction with protein L18.
