Polymorphisms in genomic fingerprints generated by arbitrarily primed PCR (AP-PCR) can distinguish between strains of almost any organism. We applied the technique to the mouse (Mus musculus). The characteristic differences in the AP-PCR genomic fingerprints between strains will be of value in strain identification and verification. Using one primer, we genetically mapped four polymorphisms in a set of C57BL/6J x DBA/2J recombinant inbreds. One of these polymorphisms is a length variant. The method will allow rapid genetic mapping of DNA polymorphisms without Southern blotting.
