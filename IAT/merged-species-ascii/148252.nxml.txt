Human DNA helicase VIII (HDH VIII) was isolated in the course of a systematic study of the DNA unwinding enzymes present in human cells. From a HeLa cell nuclear extract a protein with an Mrof 68 kDa in SDS-PAGE was isolated, characterised and micro-sequenced. The enzyme shows ATP- and Mg2+-dependent activity is not stimulated by RPA, prefers partially unwound 3'-tailed substrates and moves along the bound strand in the 5' to 3' direction. HDH VIII can also unwind partial RNA/DNA and RNA/RNA duplexes. Microsequencing of the polypeptide showed that this enzyme corresponds to G3BP, an element of the Ras pathway which binds specifically to the GTPase-activating protein. HDH VIII/G3BP is analogous to the heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoproteins and contains a sequence rich in RGG boxes similar to the C-terminal domain of HDH IV/nucleolin, another DNA and RNA helicase.
