Inner nuclear membrane proteins containing a LEM (LAP2, emerin, and MAN1) domain participate in different processes, including chromatin organization, gene expression, and nuclear envelope biogenesis. In this study, we identify a robust genetic interaction between transcription export (TREX) factors and yeast Src1, an integral inner nuclear membrane protein that is homologous to vertebrate LEM2. DNA macroarray analysis revealed that the expression of the phosphate-regulated genes PHO11, PHO12, and PHO84 is up-regulated in src1Delta cells. Notably, these PHO genes are located in subtelomeric regions of chromatin and exhibit a perinuclear location in vivo. Src1 spans the nuclear membrane twice and exposes its N and C domains with putative DNA-binding motifs to the nucleoplasm. Genome-wide chromatin immunoprecipitation-on-chip analyses indicated that Src1 is highly enriched at telomeres and subtelomeric regions of the yeast chromosomes. Our data show that the inner nuclear membrane protein Src1 functions at the interface between subtelomeric gene expression and TREX-dependent messenger RNA export through the nuclear pore complexes.

Among the numerous steps of gene expression, formation, and maturation of messenger RNP particles (mRNPs) are crucial steps before transcripts can be exported from the nucleus and translated in the cytoplasm. Studies over the past years have revealed that these various steps, including gene activation, transcription, 5' capping, 3' end processing and polyadenylation, splicing, mRNA surveillance/quality control, and export of mRNPs are tightly coupled (for reviews see Reed and Cheng, 2005; Sommer and Nehrbass, 2005).

In the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the THO-transcription export (TREX) complex and the Sac3-Thp1-Sus1-Cdc31 (TREX-2) complex are involved in transcription-coupled mRNA export (for reviews see Reed and Cheng, 2005; Kohler and Hurt, 2007). The THO-TREX complex is thought to be recruited to the elongating RNA polymerase II complex via the THO subunits (Hpr1, Tho2, Mft1, and Thp2), which preferentially function in transcription and packaging of nascent mRNA, whereas the other TREX factors Sub2 and Yra1 are involved in recruiting the Mex67-Mtr2 export receptor to the mRNP, thereby coupling mRNP biogenesis with mRNA export (for reviews see Reed and Cheng, 2005; Kohler and Hurt, 2007). The TREX-2 complex potentially coordinates Spt/Ada/Gcn5 acetyltransferase (SAGA)-mediated transcription of certain genes at the inner nuclear side of the nuclear pore complex (NPC; Rodriguez-Navarro et al., 2004). A key factor of TREX-2 is the Sac3 subunit, a multidomain protein that binds the remaining complex members. Sac3 associates with Thp1, which was initially found to be involved in transcription elongation (Gallardo and Aguilera, 2001), and with Sus1 and Cdc31 via its CID (Cdc31-interacting domain) motif (Fischer et al., 2004). Moreover, Sac3 can also directly bind to the export receptor Mex67-Mtr2 (Fischer et al., 2002; Lei et al., 2003). In vivo, the TREX-2 complex is predominantly located at the NPC, which requires the nuclear basket nucleoporin Nup1 (Fischer et al., 2002). Notably, the TREX-2 factor Sus1 is also a component of the chromatin-bound SAGA complex involved in transcription initiation of a subset of genes (Rodriguez-Navarro et al., 2004) and part of a SAGA module, which is involved in deubiquitination of H2B (Kohler et al., 2006). Thus, Sus1 could be a bridging factor between the SAGA transcription machinery and the NPC-associated TREX-2 complex.

Historically, the nuclear periphery was known as a zone that harbors silenced regions of the genome and thus was believed to be an area of transcription repression. However, recent studies have revealed that genes can be recruited to the nuclear periphery upon their transcriptional activation (for reviews see Akhtar and Gasser, 2007; Kohler and Hurt, 2007). Thus, activating and repressing chromatin environments coexist but appear to be spatially partitioned. Whereas the heterochromatin, like telomeres and the mating-type locus, line the nuclear envelope, the active chromatin domains are in the vicinity of the NPCs (Taddei et al., 2004; for review see Akhtar and Gasser, 2007).

Gene recruitment to the nuclear periphery involves components of the nuclear basket and associated factors implicated in transcription and mRNA export, including SAGA and TREX-2 factors as well as Mex67. Regarding the mechanism, gene gating requires the nascent transcript or posttranscriptional events. However, other studies suggest that gene gating can also be independent of transcription and is then mediated by direct interaction of the gene with components of the nuclear periphery (for reviews see Akhtar and Gasser, 2007; Kohler and Hurt, 2007). In general, gene recruitment to the periphery could allow access to a favorable environment, including chromatin remodeling, transcription, and export machineries, thereby optimizing gene expression and mRNA export (for reviews see Akhtar and Gasser, 2007; Kohler and Hurt, 2007).

In this study, we found Src1 (also called Heh1; King et al., 2006) in genetic screens using mutants of the THO-TREX and TREX-2 complexes. Src1 exhibits a domain organization similar to higher eukaryotic LEM2 and MAN1, which are integral inner nuclear membrane proteins that consist of an N-terminal LEM domain, two transmembrane-spanning sequences, and a Man1-Src1 C-terminal (MSC) domain (Mans et al., 2004; Brachner et al., 2005). LEM proteins (named after LAP2, emerin, and MAN1) can interact with the nuclear lamina and/or chromatin-binding factors, thereby providing anchoring sites for chromatin at the nuclear periphery and modulating higher order chromatin structure (for reviews see Gruenbaum et al., 2005; Wagner and Krohne, 2007). Our analyses further revealed that Src1 is an integral membrane protein that spans the inner nuclear membrane twice, thereby exposing the putative DNA-binding N and C domains to the nucleoplasm. As shown by chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP)-on-chip analysis, Src1 is associated with subtelomeric regions that are located at the nuclear periphery. Moreover, the regulation of expression of genes located in the subtelomeric regions (e.g., PHO11, PHO12, and PHO84) is altered in cells lacking Src1. These data suggest that Src1 functions at the interface between chromatin organization of subtelomeric genes at the inner nuclear membrane and TREX-dependent mRNA export.

To unravel the genetic network in which TREX factors carry out their function in vivo, we performed synthetic lethal screens with the mutant strains hpr1Delta (a THO-TREX factor), which is thermosensitive for growth at 37degreesC, and thp1Delta (a TREX-2 factor). Each screen yielded a synthetic lethal mutant that was complemented by SRC1 (unpublished data). DNA sequencing of the SRC1 allele recovered from the thp1Delta synthetic lethal mutant indeed revealed that Src1 was inactivated in the synthetic lethal strain by a premature stop codon at amino acid 455 (unpublished data). SRC1 was previously identified as an intron-containing gene involved in sister chromatid segregation (Rodriguez-Navarro et al., 2002). In another study, Src1/Heh1 was shown to be located at the inner side of the nuclear membrane (King et al., 2006). To directly verify the identified genetic interactions, we combined the nonessential src1Delta (null) allele with the nonessential thp1Delta or hpr1Delta disruption alleles. This analysis confirmed that the generated double mutants, src1Deltathp1Delta and src1Deltahpr1Delta, were not viable (i.e., synthetic lethal; Fig. 1).

To gain further insight in the genetic network in which SRC1 is active, we tested additional factors with known roles in transcription-coupled mRNA export for a functional overlap with SRC1. This analysis indicated that SRC1 is genetically linked to another TREX-2 factor SAC3 (Fig. 1) but not to SUS1 or CDC31 (Fig. 1 and not depicted). This correlates with the fact that src1Delta is not synthetic lethal with sac3DeltaCID, where the binding site for Sus1 and Cdc31 is deleted (Fig. 1). Unexpectedly, the other THO-TREX mutants tho2Delta, mft1Delta, and thp2Delta were not found to be genetically linked to src1Delta (Fig. 1 and not depicted). Moreover, factors acting more downstream in transcription-coupled mRNA export (e.g., mutants of YRA1 or MEX67) and mlp1Deltamlp2Delta were not synthetic lethal with src1Delta (unpublished data). In contrast, a synthetically enhanced growth inhibition was observed between src1Delta and the sub2-85 allele (Fig. 1). Collectively, these genetic studies indicated that SRC1 is functionally linked to factors of the THO-TREX and TREX-2 complex, and thus, Src1 might functionally overlap with an upstream step in the formation of an export-competent mRNP.

To study the in vivo role of Src1 with respect to its genetic linkage to TREX factors, we sought to tag chromosomal SRC1 at the C terminus with the tandem affinity purification (TAP) and GFP tag to perform affinity purification and subcellular location experiments, respectively. However, C-terminal tagging was not straight forward because SRC1 contains an intron that can be alternatively spliced (Davis et al., 2000; Rodriguez-Navarro et al., 2002). Specifically, the SRC1 intron has two alternative 5' splice sites, which could potentially encode two different Src1 proteins: a long form with 834 (Src1-L) and a shorter form with 687 amino acids (Src1-S). Importantly, Src1-L and Src1-S would differ in their amino acid sequences at the C-terminal end because the alternative 5' splice sites shift the reading frame in the 3' exon (Fig. 2 A).

Alternative splicing of SRC1 results in two different spliced protein forms. (A) Schematic overview of pre-mRNA, mRNA, and protein products upon alternative splicing. Either a 126- or a 130-nt intron can be excised by using two alternative 5' splice sites. In the latter case, a frame shift results in an earlier stop codon and, therefore, in a shorter protein with a different amino acid sequence at the C terminus compared with Src1-L. Conserved domains (HEH/LEM and MSC) and transmembrane domains (M) are indicated. Numbers represent amino acid residues. (B) Whole cell lysates of N- (TAP-Src1) and C-terminal TAP-tagged Src1-L or Src1-S were analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by Western blotting using anti-ProtA antibodies. (C) Genetic relationship of SRC1 splice variants with TREX-THO and TREX-2 components. The double-disruption strains were transformed with empty vector, GFP-Src1 splice variants, and the respective TREX component. Transformants were spotted in 10-fold serial dilutions on 5-FOA-containing plates for 5 d at the indicated temperatures.

To demonstrate that both Src1 splice variants are produced in vivo, we inserted the TAP tag at the two alternative stop codons by homologous recombination (Fig. 2 A). Both Src1-L and Src1-S were detected in about equimolar amounts in whole cell lysates (Fig. 2 B). Moreover, N-terminal TAP tagging of Src1 showed that both Src1 splice forms were coexpressed in similar ratios (Fig. 2 B). Notably, Src1-L and Src1-S do not have identical functions, as the long form of Src1 complements the synthetic lethal phenotype of THO-TREX and TREX-2 mutants significantly better than the short form (Fig. 2 C).

To find out whether both Src1s have a similar subcellular location, we performed fluorescence microscopy. Both Src1-L and Src1-S tagged at the N terminus with GFP exhibited a distinct concentration at the nuclear envelope with no apparent staining of other cellular membranes (Fig. S1, left, available at ). Moreover, Src1-L and Src1-S did not cluster with NPCs in the NPC-clustering nup133Delta mutant (Fig. S1, right). Thus, Src1-L and Src1-S are located at the inner nuclear membrane and appear not to have stable physical contact to the NPCs, although a transient interaction cannot be excluded.

Biocomputational analysis suggested that Src1-L could be a membrane protein with two membrane-spanning sequences, but only the first transmembrane span has a strong prediction (Fig. 3 A). To experimentally verify that Src1-L is an integral membrane protein, whole cell lysates containing Src1-TAP were extracted under different conditions, and the partitioning of Src1-TAP into soluble and insoluble (membrane) fractions was tested and compared with the behavior of a peripheral membrane protein (Nsp1) and an integral membrane protein (vacuolar Vam3). Whereas high salt (1 M NaCl) or pH 11.5 treatment did not release Src1-L and Src1-S, detergent (Triton X-100) efficiently solubilized both Src1-TAP splice variants, as with Vam3 (Fig. 3 B). Thus, the biochemical behavior of Src1 is typical of an integral membrane protein.

Src1-L and Src1-S are integral membrane proteins. (A) Kyte-Doolittle hydropathy analysis (with a 19-amino acid window size; Kyte and Doolittle, 1982) revealed two putative hydrophobic transmembrane-spanning regions (M1 and M2) for Src1-L but only one region with significant transmembrane potential for Src1-S. The hydrophobicity scores are plotted against the window number. (B) Crude membrane fractions from cells expressing Src1-L-TAP or Src1-S-TAP were extracted using four different conditions: 150 mM NaCl, 1 M NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, or pH 11.5. Equivalent amounts of fractions from lysate (L), membrane (P1), soluble (S1), and, after ultracentrifugation, insoluble pellet (P) and supernatant (S) were analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by Western blotting with antibodies against ProtA, Vam3, and Nsp1. Western blotting against Vam3 and Nsp1 is only shown for Src1-S-TAP (top).

Because the putative transmembrane span M2 (residues 708-725) of Src1 has a lower hydrophobicity than transmembrane span M1 (residues 450-474) and M2 is absent from the Src1-S form because of alternative splicing (Fig. 3 A), we wanted to analyze the topology of both Src1 forms within the inner nuclear membrane in living cells (see models in Fig. 4 A). Thus, we developed a novel in vivo assay to probe for the topology of Src1-L and Src1-S within the inner nuclear membrane. Src1 was genomically TAP tagged at the N terminus (protein A [ProtA]-tobacco etch virus [TEV]-calmodulin-binding peptide-Src1) or C terminus (Src1-calmodulin-binding peptide-TEV-ProtA). The accessible TEV cleavage site in these constructs could be exploited to test whether it is cleaved by an inducible TEV protease carrying an NLS and a myc tag. We anticipated that the TEV protease should remove the ProtA moiety only from those Src1 constructs in which the epitope is exposed to the nucleoplasm but not when hidden in the perinuclear space (Fig. 4 B, left). When cells were grown in glucose (no TEV expression), all Src1 constructs retained the ProtA epitope, as shown by Western blotting with anti-ProtA antibodies (Fig. 4 B, lanes 1, 3, and 5). When cells were shifted to galactose to induce the TEV protease, both short and long N-terminally tagged Src1 as well as C-terminally tagged Src1-L lost their ProtA tags, suggesting that the N terminus of Src1-L and Src1-S and the C terminus of Src1-L are facing the nucleoplasm (Fig. 4 B, lanes 2 and 4). However, the TEV protease could not remove the ProtA epitope from the C-terminally tagged Src1-S (Fig. 4 B, lane 6). Altogether, these data suggest that Src1-L spans the inner nuclear membrane twice with the N and C domain exposed to the nucleoplasm (Fig. 4 A, boxed in red). In contrast, Src1-S spans the membrane once with the N domain located in the nucleoplasm and a short C-terminal domain hidden in the perinuclear space (Fig. 4 A, boxed in red).

To determine the contribution of the transmembrane spans M1 and M2 for membrane insertion of Src1, mutants lacking M1 or M2 were expressed in the src1Delta mutant and subsequently analyzed in vitro and in vivo. Biochemical studies revealed that Src1DeltaM2 behaved like an integral membrane protein, whereas Src1DeltaM1 was no longer inserted into the membrane and became soluble (Fig. 3 B). Thus, M1 is necessary and sufficient for membrane insertion of Src1. However, M2 alone could not confer a stable membrane insertion and only integrated into the nuclear membrane in the context of full-length Src1 (Fig. 4 B). Thus, the first transmembrane domain in Src1 is necessary for membrane insertion, whereas the second membrane span alone cannot confer integral insertion into the membrane but develops insertion activity when M1 is present.

To study the role of the transmembrane sequences M1 and M2 and of other domains for nuclear envelope targeting of Src1 in vivo, GFP-tagged Src1 mutant constructs (Fig. 5 A) were analyzed for their subcellular location by fluorescence microscopy (Fig. 5 B). This analysis showed that GFP-Src1DeltaM2 was still located at the nuclear envelope, in contrast to GFP-Src1DeltaM1, which was detached from the nuclear periphery and mislocalized to the nucleoplasm.

Consistent with these findings, the N-terminal domain of Src1 devoid of any membrane span showed a strong nuclear accumulation. The reciprocal construct, GFP-Src1DeltaN, was still targeted to the nuclear envelope, albeit with lower efficiency, and was partly found to be associated with other membranes (cortical ER or plasma membrane). Deletion of only the N-terminal LEM domain (DeltaLEM) did not affect the nuclear envelope location of Src1. Notably, the Src1DeltaNDeltaM1 construct was also located in the nucleoplasm with occasional perinuclear spots. Altogether, the data suggest that the N domain and, to a lesser extent, also the C domain of Src1-L contribute to nuclear targeting, whereas the first transmembrane domain is necessary and sufficient to insert Src1 into the inner nuclear envelope.

To assess which Src1domains are functionally important, we tested the ability of the different truncated Src1 forms to complement the synthetic lethal phenotype of the src1Deltathp1Delta double mutant (Fig. 5 C). None of the constructs, which lacked either M1 or M2, complemented the src1Deltathp1Delta strain. Thus, although Src1DeltaM2 apparently is targeted to and inserted into the nuclear membrane, it is not functional in our complementation assay. Notably, the C-terminal domain of Src1-L is exposed to the nucleoplasm (see previous section), but in the Src1DeltaM2 strain it is hidden in the lumen of the perinuclear space (Fig. 4 B). Thus, the C-terminal domain of Src1 performs a crucial role with respect to the Thp1 function and has to be both targeted to the membrane and exposed to the nucleoplasm. In contrast, Src1 devoid of the LEM domain or the entire N terminus is able to significantly complement the src1Deltathp1Delta strain and thus may perform additional functions.

As Src1 was found in this study to be linked to TREX factors, we determined whether Src1 participates in transcription and/or mRNA export. In situ hybridization using fluorescently labeled oligo(dT) nucleotide probes did not reveal a nuclear mRNA export defect in src1Delta cells (unpublished data), consistent with the finding that Src1 is not genetically linked to mRNA export factors such as Mex67 (see the first Results section). To investigate whether Src1 plays a role in transcription, we analyzed the expression profile of the approximately6,000 yeast genes in the src1Delta strain using DNA macroarrays. This genome-wide analysis indicated that only a small number of genes (approximately60) is affected in the src1Delta mutant (increased or decreased expression), which also included genes that have a subtelomeric location (Table S1, available at ; and Gene Expression Omnibus database). To analyze whether subtelomeric genes have a higher probability to be affected in their expression than other genes when SRC1 is deleted, the relative increases (src1/wild type [wt] when src1 > wt) or decreases (wt/src1 when src1 < wt) of gene expression were plotted versus their distance to the closest telomere or centromere using a sliding window of 100 genes. This analysis suggested a statistically significant misregulation of subtelomeric genes in src1Delta cells (subtelomeric regions are defined to be within approximately25 kb from each telomere; Fig. 6 A; Louis, 1995). This effect is specific to telomeres because it does not occur (e.g., in regions close to the centromeres; Fig. 6 B). In particular, several PHO genes (PHO84, PHO11, PHO12, and, to a lesser extent, also PHO4) were markedly up-regulated in cells devoid of Src1 (Table S1). Quantitative real-time PCR independently showed that PHO84, PHO11, and PHO12 transcript levels increased approximately fivefold in src1Delta cells when grown in high phosphate (HP) medium. However, further up-regulation of these PHO genes was no longer observed in src1Delta cells when shifted from high to low phosphate (LP) medium (Fig. 6 C). In contrast, PHO84, PHO11, and PHO12 transcript levels were low in wt cells when grown in HP medium but could be significantly up-regulated upon transfer to LP medium (Fig. 6; for review see Oshima, 1997). Altogether, these analyses indicated that deletion of SRC1 leads to a disturbed regulation of gene expression of a group of PHO genes, which encode a phosphate transporter in the plasma membrane and secreted acid phosphatases.

Analysis of gene expression in the src1Delta mutant. (A and B) Relative increases (src1/wt, when src1 > wt) or decreases (wt/src1, when src1 < wt) of gene expression were plotted versus their distance to the closest telomere (A) or centromere (B). A sliding window of 100 genes was used. The average of the 100 genes was used for the y axis, and the distance of the central gene in the window was used for the x axis. The bottom panel of A is an expanded view of the top graph showing the approximately27-kb region close to the telomeres, which exhibits a misregulation in the src1 deletion strain. (C) Expression levels of PHO mRNAs in wt and src1Delta cells. Total RNA of wt and src1Delta cells grown in HP and LP was prepared, and cDNA was analyzed by quantitative RT-PCR using specific primers for PHO11, PHO12, and PHO84. Each gene was assayed in triplicates. The mRNA levels of wt HP expression are set as one. One representative dataset of five times independently isolated RNA is shown. Error bars represent SD.

Notably, the PHO84, PHO11, and PHO12 genes that exhibit altered gene expression in the src1Delta strain are all located in subtelomeric regions of the chromosomes (Table S1). It is well known that telomeres are preferentially located at the nuclear periphery in yeast (Klein et al., 1992); thus, we wanted to localize the subtelomeric PHO84, PHO11, and PHO12 gene loci with regard to the nuclear envelope in live cells. As a control, a randomly selected region that was not proximal to telomeres but was close to the interchromosomal GIS1 locus was investigated. Thus, TetO repeats were inserted close to the PHO11, PHO12, PHO84, or GIS1 chromosome loci, and TetR-GFP was expressed to visualize the TetO-labeled genes. This analysis showed that all of the three gene loci, PHO11, PHO12, or PHO84, are positioned at the nuclear periphery, whereas GIS1 is distributed predominantly in the nucleoplasm (Fig. 7). However, the observed nuclear envelope tethering of the PHO genes did not require Src1, as the perinuclear location of these gene loci was not altered in src1Delta cells (Fig. 7). Collectively, the data showed that Src1 is involved in gene expression of a class of PHO genes that are located in subtelomeric regions and in vivo exhibit a perinuclear location.

In vivo localization of PHO gene loci. 3D localization of TetO/TetR-GFP-labeled PHO11, PHO12, PHO84, and GIS1 loci in wt or src1Delta cells expressing GFP-Nup49 was determined after microscopy acquisition in vivo (see Materials and methods). For each strain, positions of the loci obtained from N nuclei are plotted in radial projection on the same graph (as previously described in Cabal et al., 2006). Hot colors indicate high density of loci, and cold colors indicate low density (the color scale is indicated on the bottom right).

To identify molecules, which potentially link Src1 to chromatin, we sought to affinity purify ProtA-Src1. Although ProtA-Src1-L or -Src1-S could be significantly enriched using a protocol for isolation of membrane proteins, coenrichment of stoichiometrically interacting proteins was not observed (Fig. S2, available at ).

Next, we tested whether ProtA-Src1 is associated with chromatin. We performed genome-wide ChIP-on-chip analyses to determine the chromosomal distribution profile of Src1-L. Overall, three independent ChIP-on-chip experiments were performed with ProtA-Src1, and the data were highly similar. As shown in Fig. 8 and Fig. S3 (available at ) for one set of these experiments, a significant enrichment of Src1 at subtelomeric regions of all 16 yeast chromosomes was observed (note that the genomic chips used in this study did not contain the repetitive telomeric DNA). Moreover, Src1 localizes also to other heterochromatin-like regions such as the ribosomal DNA (rDNA) locus, the mating-type loci (within subtelomeric regions of chromosome III), and, albeit only to a minor degree, to centromeric regions (Fig. 8). Most of the other locations to which Src1 maps to a minor extent are likely to be unspecific, as those loci are also enriched in the ProtA control. Altogether, these data indicate that Src1 is preferentially associated with subtelomeric chromatin, and this interaction can affect expression of subtelomeric-located genes.

To test whether Src1 plays a role in gene silencing, we monitored the expression of a silenced URA3 reporter inserted into the telomeric region of chromosome 7 in the presence and absence of SRC1. Deletion of SRC1 did not affect telomeric silencing as revealed by a normal growth of cells on 5-fluoroorotic acid (5-FOA)-containing plates in comparison with a wt strain. In contrast, when yku70Delta cells known to have a telomeric silencing defect (Laroche et al., 1998) were plated on 5-FOA, a significant growth inhibition was observed. Moreover, the combination of src1Delta and yku70Delta in haploid cells caused a synergistic inhibition of growth on 5-FOA plates (Fig. 9). These data suggest that Src1 in combination with another silencing factor can synergistically affect telomeric silencing.

This study has revealed that the integral inner nuclear membrane protein Src1 functions in gene regulation of subtelomeric genes and is embedded functionally in a network of factors, which participate in transcription-coupled mRNA export. Importantly, Src1 is associated with subtelomeric chromatin and thus can help to organize this region of the chromosomes. In previous studies, Src1 was shown to contain an intron with the possibility of alternative splicing (Davis et al., 2000; Rodriguez-Navarro et al., 2002). Our study revealed that both splice forms localize to the nuclear periphery and are integral inner nuclear membrane proteins (King et al., 2006). However, both proteins are not functionally equivalent. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first demonstration that two forms of a protein generated by alternative splicing in yeast have different functions.

The N domain of Src1 mediates nuclear targeting, and insertion into the nuclear membrane requires the first transmembrane span. These findings are consistent with studies of vertebrate LEM2 and MAN1 in which nuclear envelope targeting and retention are also dependent on the first transmembrane domain and the N terminus (Wu et al., 2002; Brachner et al., 2005). Previously, it has been shown that Src1 is imported to the inner nuclear membrane by the Kap60-Kap95 pathway in a RanGTP-dependent manner (King et al., 2006). Replacing the entire N terminus of Src1 with the classical SV40 NLS, however, was not sufficient to restore its normal localization at the inner nuclear membrane (unpublished data). This suggests that besides an NLS, additional targeting/retention information is retained within the N domain of Src1.

Src1 is preferentially associated with heterochromatin such as subtelomeric and telomeric chromatin. As both N- and C-terminal domains of Src1-L face the nucleoplasm and each harbors a potential DNA-interacting domain (LEM and MSC), it is possible that the interaction with DNA is direct, but adaptor proteins could also be involved in chromatin binding. LEM domain proteins in higher eukaryotes are able to associate with chromatin either directly (Cai et al., 2001; Caputo et al., 2006) or via the chromatin-associated barrier to autointegration factor (for review see Wagner and Krohne, 2007). However, a homologue of barrier to autointegration factor does not exist in yeast, and we were unable to find stoichiometric protein interaction partners of Src1.

Telomeres are anchored to the nuclear periphery in yeast by redundant mechanisms involving the heterodimeric yKu complex and Sir4, which associates with the membrane-associated Esc1 (Hediger et al., 2002; Taddei et al., 2004). Moreover, the SUN domain protein Mps3 assists in Sir4-dependent telomere tethering and silencing (Bupp et al., 2007). Whether Src1 functions directly in silencing remains open. SRC1 is not genetically linked to ESC1 or YKU70 (unpublished data), and telomere silencing was not affected in src1Delta cells. However, disruption of SRC1 affected telomere length (Askree et al., 2004), and a synergistically reduced silencing of subtelomeric genes was observed when src1Delta was combined with the yku70Delta allele.

In addition to telomeres, Src1 is also associated with the rDNA locus. Both consist of repetitive sequences, which have to be protected from uncontrolled homologous recombination to maintain genomic integrity. Notably, Src1 was copurified with Lrs4, a factor located at the rDNA locus with a role in rDNA silencing and suppression of rDNA recombination (Huang et al., 2006). Lrs4 together with cohesin are thought to prevent the formation of chromatid junctions, and Src1 could aid in this step locally at the inner nuclear membrane. In line with a function together with cohesin, Src1 has been reported to be involved in sister chromatid separation and is genetically linked to SCC1 and ESP1 (Rodriguez-Navarro et al., 2002).

Our study further reveals that Src1 is required for proper gene expression of subtelomeric genes, such as several PHO genes, that are associated with the inner nuclear membrane. Transcription of PHO genes in response to the phosphate concentration is regulated by the phosphorylation status of the transcription factor Pho4, which in turn affects its nucleocytoplasmic shuttling (O'Neill et al., 1996). Our data suggest that the subtelomeric PHO genes may exhibit, besides specific control by Pho4, a global regulation as a result of their association with the inner nuclear membrane, which is repressive for gene expression. By which mechanism Src1 could affect subtelomeric gene expression remains unclear. It is known that in contrast to telomere silencing mediated by the Sir complex, silencing of genes within subtelomeric/HAST (Hda1-affected subtelomeric) domains depends on the local nucleosome structure (Wyrick et al., 1999). This is characterized by histone H3 hypomethylation and hypoacetylation (Bernstein et al., 2002; Robyr et al., 2002). Whether Src1 specifically affects histone modifications in subtelomeric regions remains to be determined, but its role in gene expression could be envisaged in a broader sense (e.g., by interfering with different types of mechanisms that activate or repress gene expression). The effect of both up- and down-regulation of genes observed in the src1Delta mutant could be caused by transcription factors concentrated at the nuclear periphery that act as both activators and repressors. Lack of Src1 might restrict the access of these factors to subtelomeric loci as a result of an altered chromatin structure. The macroarray data also show that expression of some genes that are not located at subtelomeric regions, but randomly across the chromosomes, were affected by loss of SRC1. Because Src1 did not interact significantly with these genes according to ChIP-on-chip, the effect could be indirect (e.g., caused by misregulation of subtelomeric genes, which in turn alter expression of genes located elsewhere in the genome).

The finding that Src1 is genetically linked to factors of the THO-TREX and TREX-2 complexes suggested an involvement in transcription and/or export. However, the disruption of SRC1 did not cause an mRNA export defect. Thus, Src1 could be connected to the transcription-assisted (upstream) functions of these TREX complexes. It is well established that mutations in these TREX factors (e.g., in Thp1, Sac3, and Hpr1) not only inhibit transcription elongation but also induce transcription-dependent hyperrecombination and genome instability (for review see Reed and Cheng, 2005). Src1 is not genetically linked to all of the subunits of THO-TREX and TREX-2, which suggests that the subunits within the TREX complexes may have different roles with respect to Src1 function. For example, Sub2, a subunit of THO-TREX, not only functions in transcription, splicing, and mRNA export but was also shown to be localized to telomeres and to affect heterochromatic gene expression (Lahue et al., 2005).

Collectively, the simplest model of how Src1 functions as an integral inner nuclear membrane protein is to help in recruiting and organizing the peripheral (telomeric and subtelomeric) chromatin, perhaps by directly binding to specific DNA sequences or nucleosomes (see above). By organizing subtelomeric and telomeric DNA in a distinct nuclear compartment, the nuclear periphery, Src1 could help to cluster a group of genes in a zone in which silencing factors, transcription activators, and repressors cooperate for regulated gene expression and which also has access to an efficient mRNA export pathway via the TREX machineries associated with NPCs. Subtelomeric and telomeric chromatin and the rDNA locus are repetitive, and their preservation is crucial for maintaining genome integrity. Thus, localization of this chromatin to the nuclear membrane could also play a role in preventing unwanted recombination. Many of these described functions attributed to Src1 can now be tested by exploiting src1 mutants in different functional assays.

Last but not least, Src1 is related to higher eukaryotic LEM domain-containing inner nuclear membrane proteins that were shown to interact with transcription regulators (e.g., R-Smads and HDAC3) and thus affect gene expression and signal transduction by recruitment of transcription regulators to the nuclear periphery (for reviews see Gruenbaum et al., 2005; Wagner and Krohne, 2007). Our study showed that the LEM domain protein Src1 is associated with subtelomeric chromatin and affects gene expression in this region. Thus, Src1 could serve as a model protein to gain further insight into the complex role of inner nuclear membrane proteins, including their involvement in diseases such as laminopathies.

50 ml of wt and src1Delta cells (OD600 0.5) were pelleted and immediately frozen. After thawing the samples on ice, total RNA was isolated and reverse transcribed using 33P-labeled deoxycytidine triphosphate and oligo d(5'-T15VN-3') (Garcia-Martinez et al., 2004). Hybridization was performed on nylon filters using PCR-amplified whole ORF sequences as probes (Alberola et al., 2004; Garcia-Martinez et al., 2004) except that hybridizations were 40-48 h. Three different cultures were used for each strain. Scanning and analysis of the macroarrays were performed essentially as described previously using ArrayStat software (Garcia-Martinez et al., 2004; Rodriguez-Navarro et al., 2004). Apart from the genes detected by ArrayStat as significantly up- or down-regulated, we obtained an additional list of 16 genes that were expressed over background in the three replicates in src1Delta and below background in all three replicates in wt cells. Array data have been submitted to the Gene Expression Omnibus data repository (accession no. ).

For statistical analysis, we have taken a 10-kb region from the end of the chromosomes. The 599 independent probes representing subtelomeric regions show an average of 4.45x Src1 enrichment over the baseline. The remaining 40,881 probes give a 1.06x average enrichment. In the negative control (cells expressing only ProtA), we did not detect any enrichment of immunoprecipitated ProtA at telomeres, centromeres, HML and HMR loci, or on rDNA (1.08x average enrichment at subtelomeric region vs. 1.03x).

Growing and mounting yeast cells for in vivo microscopy were performed as described previously (Cabal et al., 2006) using a Revolution Nipkow disk confocal system (Andor Technology). The system was controlled using Revolution IQ software (version 1.5; Andor Technology). Z stacks of 41 images with a 250-m Z step were acquired using a 100x/1.4 NA Plan Apochromat oil immersion objective (Carl Zeiss, Inc.). Pixel size was 77.3 nm. Quantitative analysis of microscopy data was performed using Matlab software as described previously (Cabal et al., 2006). In brief, each nucleus was processed to extract 3D coordinates of the locus, the nuclear center, and the nuclear envelope. In the following step, loci positions relative to the nuclear center obtained from different nuclei were plotted on the same 3D graph. Finally, and for reading facility, this 3D graph was projected on a 2D graph using radial projection (i.e., the loci-nuclear center distance is conserved; Cabal et al., 2006).
