We have determined the DNA sequence of the H-2Kk gene of the mouse major histocompatibility complex (MHC). Comparison on the nucleotide and protein level of three H-2K alleles (Kk, Kb and Kd) reveals a high degree of homology, in particular between the Kb and Kk alleles. Differences between the two latter antigens are almost exclusively confined to the alpha 1 and alpha 2 domains. At nine positions in the extracellular part of the molecules we have found allele-specific amino acids. Interestingly, 78% of these residues are either polar or carry hydroxyl-groups. This makes it likely that they are exposed on the surface of the molecules and might then be part of antigenic determinants. We have also identified potentially allele-specific nucleotide sequences of the K genes which might be used as specific DNA probes.
