T lymphocytes use LFA-1 to migrate into lymph nodes and inflammatory sites. To investigate the mechanisms regulating this migration, we utilize mAbs selective for conformational epitopes as probes for active LFA-1. Expression of the KIM127 epitope, but not the 24 epitope, defines the extended conformation of LFA-1, which has intermediate affinity for ligand ICAM-1. A key finding is that KIM127-positive LFA-1 forms new adhesions at the T lymphocyte leading edge. This LFA-1 links to the cytoskeleton through alpha-actinin-1 and disruption at the level of integrin or actin results in loss of cell spreading and migratory speed due to a failure of attachment at the leading edge. The KIM127 pattern contrasts with high-affinity LFA-1 that expresses both 24 and KIM127 epitopes, is restricted to the mid-cell focal zone and controls ICAM-1 attachment. Identification of distinctive roles for intermediate- and high-affinity LFA-1 in T lymphocyte migration provides a biological function for two active conformations of this integrin for the first time.

T lymphocytes are continually recruited from the circulation into lymph nodes and other tissues in response to stimuli released at sites of injury or infection (von Andrian and Mempel, 2003; Cyster, 2005). This recruitment involves the integrin LFA-1 (CD11a/CD18; alphaLbeta2) acting as a migratory receptor (Hogg et al, 2003; Dustin et al, 2004). If turnover of active to inactive LFA-1 is prevented, then motility decreases both in vivo and in vitro, indicating that conversion between different activity states is essential for lymphocyte migration (Semmrich et al, 2005; Smith et al, 2005). T lymphocytes move rapidly across the vasculature into lymph nodes where they can reach speeds of approximately40 mum/min (Mempel et al, 2004). This ability to migrate is vital for the ultimate success of the immune response as it increases the opportunity for cellular interactions, thereby improving the chance of antigen recognition.

Integrin activation involves an alteration in conformation giving rise to an affinity increase, and adhesion strengthening through receptor clustering (Carman and Springer, 2003; Dustin et al, 2004; Kinashi, 2005). Crystallization of the beta3 integrin alphavbeta3 has revealed details of the conformational changes that integrins undergo following activation (Xiong et al, 2001). A basic model for beta2 integrin LFA-1 activation has been developed from structural data, together with observations from electron microscopic studies of isolated integrins and from the use of mAbs that recognize epitopes expressed upon activation (Takagi et al, 2002; Luo et al, 2007). Basically, one conformation of LFA-1 is bent at the junction between the thigh and calf-1 domains of the alphaL subunit and between EGF-like domains 1 and 2 of the beta2 subunit. Upon activation, LFA-1 extends, exposing an epitope recognized by mAb KIM127 that is located in the EGF-like domain 2 at the bend in the beta2 subunit (Robinson et al, 1992; Beglova et al, 2002). The extended KIM127+ LFA-1 adopts both closed and open conformations corresponding to intermediate- and high-affinity forms of LFA-1, respectively (Kinashi, 2006; Luo et al, 2007). The epitope recognized by mAb 24 is located in a loop at the top of the I-like domain near the MIDAS site in the beta2 subunit (Lu et al, 2001; Kamata et al, 2002), and its expression is characteristic of the high-affinity conformation of LFA-1 (Dransfield et al, 1992b; Lu et al, 2001; Hogg et al, 2002; Kamata et al, 2002). This epitope is postulated to form upon interaction of the alpha subunit I domain with the beta2 subunit I-like domain via a pulling mechanism, giving rise to the open, high-affinity form of integrin (Alonso et al, 2002; Luo et al, 2007).

In order to attach to integrin ligands and migrate, primary T lymphocytes require stimulus from a chemoattractant such as a chemokine. However, for preactivated T lymphoblasts, LFA-1-mediated binding to an ICAM-1-expressing surface is sufficient to cause cell polarization and migration without the need for added chemokines (Dustin et al, 1997; Smith et al, 2003). Previously we have shown that a 'focal zone' containing high-affinity 24+ LFA-1 is located in the mid-cell region of the polarized T lymphocyte and influences the speed of migration (Smith et al, 2005). To date, little is known of the characteristics of LFA-1 expressed at the leading edge of migrating T lymphocytes. To investigate the nature of these adhesions and compare them with LFA-1 in the focal zone, we have made use of two well-described mAbs, KIM127 and 24, as probes for intermediate- and high-affinity LFA-1. We find that they detect these two forms of active LFA-1 in distinct regions of the migrating cell.

A comparison was made of the expression patterns of LFA-1 activation epitopes recognized by mAbs KIM127 and 24 on T cells migrating on the LFA-1 ligand ICAM-1. Both freshly derived primary T lymphocytes and cultured T lymphoblasts, that are referred to in this study as T cells, were investigated. When analyzed by flow cytometry, the majority of T cells expressed both epitopes (60-95%; n=10), whereas a lower percentage of freshly derived T lymphocytes expressed the epitopes (10-40%; n=4). These percentages correlated with the proportions of cells able to attach to immobilized ICAM-1 (data not shown). Thus, the cells that attach and migrate represent pre-existing subsets on which LFA-1 displays activation epitopes.

The next step was to compare the distribution of the LFA-1 activation epitopes on T cells that were allowed to migrate before fixation and subsequent immunostaining. MAb 24+ LFA-1 was restricted to the mid-cell focal zone both for unstimulated, cultured T cells as previously described (Smith et al, 2005) and primary T lymphocytes that had been stimulated with the chemokine SDF-1 (CXCL12) (Figure 1). In contrast, mAb KIM127 labelled LFA-1 throughout the lamellar region, as well as intensely labelling the focal zone (Figure 1). Therefore, the extended intermediate-affinity form of LFA-1 that expresses the KIM127, but not 24, epitope is localized to the spreading lamella of the T cell, whereas high-affinity LFA-1 that expresses both epitopes is restricted to the focal zone. The distribution patterns of LFA-1 epitopes show that these two conformations of active LFA-1 have distinct locations on the migrating T cell.

As well as acting as activation reporters, both mAb 24 and KIM127 can stabilize the active forms of LFA-1 that they recognize (Dransfield et al, 1992a; Robinson et al, 1992; Smith et al, 2005; Nishida et al, 2006). When T cells were exposed to mAb KIM127 during migration, KIM127+ LFA-1 attachments (red) to ICAM-1 were formed at the leading edge (see asterisks). As the T cell lamellae extended and made further attachments, KIM127+ staining increased and the T cell rapidly stopped translocating forward (Figure 2A; Supplementary Figure 1 and Video 1). When the KIM127+ adhesions were stabilized to a certain level around one leading edge, another lamellipodial protrusion appeared that was in turn stabilized by making new KIM127+ attachments. Eventually when the leading edge membranes could no longer move in any direction, the cell reversed its polarity and the process was repeated until the T cell was unable to make any new KIM 127+ attachments.

By comparison, when T cells were exposed to mAb 24 during migration, 24+ LFA-1 (green) was focused not at the leading edge but in the focal zone (Figure 2B; Supplementary Figure 1). Over time the focal zone extended forward as the number of new 24+ attachments increased. Of note is the observation that KIM127 does not have access to its epitope in the focal zone area as might be expected. However, if the migrating cell is subsequently fixed and then stained for KIM127, the epitope is detected in the focal zone in keeping with the pattern of immunostaining shown in Figure 1 (data not shown). There may be a lack of access of KIM127 in the focal zone region because of the positioning of the epitope on LFA-1 or because packing of LFA-1 molecules in this region interferes with mAb binding.

To investigate the formation of KIM127+ adhesions in more detail, we carried out a two-stage experiment focusing on the interface with ICAM-1. T cells were allowed to migrate in an excess amount of KIM127-Alexa488 (green) to label the available adhesions. Unbound mAb was then washed out, and, to capture the adhesions formed subsequently, KIM127-Alexa546 (red) was added while the cells were being fixed. Under these conditions, KIM127+ adhesions (red) were only observed at the leading edge confirming that new KIM127+ adhesions form in this location and are stabilized by the mAb (Figure 2C). This stabilizing effect then causes the unattached leading edge of the T cell to move in another direction over pre-existing stabilized LFA-1 adhesions to form new ones.

We next used interference reflection microscopy (IRM) to focus on the interface between LFA-1 on migrating T cells and ICAM-1 at the leading edge following addition of KIM127. At 0 s the T cell migrates in one direction, with its leading edge indicated by an arrow (Figure 3; Supplementary Video 2). After 30 s of exposure to KIM127, LFA-1 at the leading edge has become stabilized. The LFA-1 attachment points are seen as dark contrast regions and a new leading edge moves the cell in another direction. At 70 s, the cell changes direction again as the second leading edge becomes stabilized. Finally at 130 s the LFA-1 adhesions are stabilized all around the cell and it has come to a halt. We conclude that mAb KIM127 prevents turnover of LFA-1/ICAM-1 attachments through its ability to stabilize LFA-1 adhesions at the leading edge. Addition of mAb 24 has no effect on the leading edge (data not shown).

In contrast to both the 24+ and KIM127+ adhesions, the majority of which are restricted to LFA-1 in contact with ICAM-1, total LFA-1 was distributed over the entire cell surface (Supplementary Figure 2). The lamella at the leading edge displayed a lower level of LFA-1 compared with the focal zone and the uropod at the rear as previously reported (Smith et al, 2005). Therefore, for T cells migrating on ICAM-1, the presence of mAbs recognizing activation epitopes causes build up of LFA-1 adhesions at the leading edge for KIM127, and at the focal zone, for 24.

As mAbs 24 and KIM127 labelled distinct LFA-1 conformations in different locations when T cells were migrating on ICAM-1, we asked whether the way in which these mAbs affected migration could provide information about the differing roles of the two forms of LFA-1. Non-blocking anti-LFA-1 mAb YTH 81.5 had no effect, but KIM127 caused a 63+/-4% reduction in speed of migration (Figure 4A) by preventing the translocation of individual T cells (Figure 4B). In contrast, there was no significant alteration in cell speed after the addition of 24 for the initial 10-min period (Figure 4A and B), but longer exposure gradually resulted in reduced migration (data not shown). To recreate more closely a potential in vivo situation, the effect of these mAbs on T cell migration through ICAM-1-coated filters in response to chemokine SDF-1 was tested (Figure 4C). SDF-1-induced migration was inhibited 96.4+/-0.7% by KIM127, 45.7+/-1.0% by 24 and was unaffected by YTH 81.5 (Figure 4C).

Confocal microscopy was used to observe T cells migrating on TNF-alpha-activated human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) following exposure to fluorescently labelled KIM127 or 24 (Figure 4D; Supplementary Videos 3A and B). The cells that bound KIM127 failed to translocate, showing that KIM127 effectively inhibited turnover of LFA-1 adhesions to the endothelial cell surface. In contrast, mAb 24 stabilized only the mid-cell focal zone LFA-1, leaving the leading edge free to make fresh attachments and move forward. In fact the strength of this motility was sufficient to overcome the 24-stabilized LFA-1 adhesions, a proportion of which were left behind on the endothelium (see arrows). These results further underline the importance of intermediate-affinity KIM127+ LFA-1 in making adhesions at the front of the cell and show that this LFA-1 controls the ability of T cells to migrate.

Given the dependence of LFA-1-mediated migration on reorganization of the cytoskeleton (Porter et al, 2002; Smith et al, 2003) and the dramatic effect of KIM127 on T cell migration, an issue was how intermediate-affinity LFA-1 might be linked into the cytoskeleton. Pavalko and co-workers have demonstrated binding of the neutrophil beta2 integrin subunit to both talin and alpha-actinin (Sampath et al, 1998). As the focal zone LFA-1 is associated with talin (Smith et al, 2005), we explored whether alpha-actinin-1 might be associated with KIM127+ LFA-1. The T cell line HSB-2 was transfected with alpha-actinin-1-GFP (Guvakova et al, 2002) and the migrating cells exposed to mAb KIM127 while being fixed so that the mAb would label the newest adhesions. alpha-Actinin-1 was chiefly localized at the leading edge of the cell (green), overlapping with KIM127+ LFA-1 (red) (Figure 5A and B). Quantification of the expression levels confirmed that the highest levels of both molecules were at the leading edge (Figure 5B). When viewed as a vertical slice along the y-axis, it was apparent that colocalized KIM127+ LFA-1 and alpha-actinin-1 were not restricted to the interface with ICAM-1, but could also be found on non-attached membrane at the front of the cell (Figure 5A). As a control, GFP transfected into T cells was evenly distributed, indicating that the alpha-actinin-GFP pattern did not simply represent the volume occupied by ruffled membranes (data not shown).

Further evidence for an association between LFA-1 and alpha-actinin-1 was sought by co-immunoprecipitation of T cell proteins using mAbs KIM127 and 24, pan-LFA-1 mAb 38 and an isotype control mAb (Figure 5C). alpha-Actinin-1 co-immunoprecipitated with KIM127+ and 38+ LFA-1, whereas the co-immunoprecipitation of alpha-actinin-1 with 24+ LFA-1 was at background levels (top panel). Loading control lanes for the LFA-1 alphaL subunit and alpha-actinin-1 are shown in the bottom panels. Using densitometry, we estimated that mAbs KIM127 and 38, but not mAb 24 or control mAb, immunoprecipitated 0.45+/-0.1% of total alpha-actinin-1 (n=3). The alpha-actinin-1 associated with LFA-1 therefore represents a small but distinctive subpopulation of this cytoskeleton-associated protein. Together, these results provide evidence that intermediate-affinity LFA-1 on T cells is associated with alpha-actinin-1 at the leading edge.

We asked whether alpha-actinin-1 was required for T cell migration and also in the step before migration that involves cell attachment from suspension onto immobilized ICAM-1. Small interfering RNA (siRNA) directed against alpha-actinin-1 was transfected into the HSB-2 T cell line, resulting in a 60% knockdown after 48 h (see arrow), but with no effect on talin expression (Figure 6A). The decreased level of alpha-actinin-1 did not impede T cell attachment and, in fact, caused a 35+/-5% increase in the level of adhesion (Figure 6B). However, when migration on ICAM-1 was assessed, alpha-actinin-1-knockdown T cells showed a 53+/-5% reduction in speed and a decreased ability of individual cells to translocate compared with control siRNA-transfected or untransfected cells (Figure 6C and D). These results are in contrast to knockdown of talin by 40% that produced a corresponding decrease in HSB-2 T cell attachment (Supplementary Figure 3), suggesting a key role for talin, and not alpha-actinin-1, in this step. Therefore alpha-actinin-1 has no role in the initial attachment to ICAM-1, but does have a major impact on the ability of the T cells to migrate.

To establish whether alpha-actinin-1 was linked to the actin cytoskeleton, we transfected HSB-2 T cells with alpha-actinin-GFP (green) and detected F-actin with phalloidin-Alexa546 (red). There was overlap at the leading edge between the highest cellular levels of alpha-actinin-1 and F-actin (Figure 7A). Next, T cells were transfected with an alpha-actinin-1 construct (alpha-actinin-GFP), a second alpha-actinin-1 construct lacking the actin-binding domain (DeltaN-actinin-GFP) or GFP as a control. The T cells expressing DeltaN-actinin-GFP showed a 75+/-9% decrease in speed compared with alpha-actinin-GFP and control GFP-expressing cells (Figure 7B). Tracking individual cells highlighted a loss of translocation associated with the DeltaN-actinin-GFP compared with controls (Figure 7C). The cells expressing alpha-actinin-GFP or GFP had a polarized morphology, whereas the DeltaN-alpha-actinin-GFP transfectants attached normally to ICAM-1, but remained rounded (Figure 7C). Therefore colocalization of alpha-actinin-1 and F-actin at the leading edge, as well as the effect of the alpha-actinin-1 construct lacking the actin-binding domain, indicated the critical role played by alpha-actinin-1 linkage to the actin cytoskeleton in T cell morphology and migration.

The previous experiments showed that alpha-actinin-1 interacting with F-actin at the leading edge was required for successful T cell migration and that a sub-population of alpha-actinin-1 is associated with KIM127+ LFA-1. A question was whether the LFA-1/alpha-actinin-1 association was direct and whether interfering with it would alter aspects of migration that were also altered by manipulating alpha-actinin-1 itself. To investigate the interaction between LFA-1 and alpha-actinin-1, we synthesized a cell-permeable peptide corresponding to the alpha-actinin-1-binding site (H728-S745) (beta2-actinin peptide) on the LFA-1 beta2 subunit cytoplasmic tail (Pavalko and LaRoche, 1993). In a pull-down assay comparing the beta2-actinin peptide (lane 3) with the scrambled control peptide (lane 2), the beta2-actinin peptide showed selectivity in binding alpha-actinin-1 but not talin or vinculin (Figure 8A).

T cells were then preincubated with the two peptides to test their effect on migration. The speed of beta2-actinin peptide-treated cells was reduced by 87+/-4%, with the control peptide-treated cells being similar to the untreated cells (Figure 8B). When viewed by real-time low-light microscopy, beta2-actinin peptide-treated cells were attached but exhibited dynamic membrane activity, with projections extending and retracting around the perimeter of the cell (Figure 8C). Therefore, the failure to migrate was not due to an inability to generate membrane protrusions (Supplementary Video 4A). Control peptide-treated cells migrated normally (Figure 8C; Supplementary Video 4B).

We used IRM to examine in more detail the close contacts with ICAM-1 made by migrating T cells following preincubation with peptide. On untreated (data not shown) and control peptide-treated cells, the lamellar membranes displayed dynamic patterns of intermittent attachment in the direction of cell movement over time, as well as a more uniform darker contact area that followed behind the leading edge (Figure 9A). In contrast, the beta2-actinin peptide-treated T cells showed only the dark close contact area, with little evidence for membranes making new contacts over time (Figure 9A). Analysis of cell morphology over 30 s showed that approximately70% of control peptide and untreated cells displayed a defined leading edge comprising lamella and lamellipodium, whereas 50% of the beta2-actinin peptide-treated cells had no definite leading edge, and a further 10% showed minimal lamellipodial extension (Figure 9B). The images indicate that exposure of migrating T cells to a peptide designed to disrupt the LFA-1/alpha-actinin-1 connection interferes with the ability of the cell to generate or to maintain the contacts with ICAM-1 that lead to spreading at the leading edge.

The beta2-actinin peptide had an inhibitory effect on LFA-1 attachments to ICAM-1, but we wanted to explore whether or not it was KIM127+ LFA-1 linked to alpha-actinin that was involved in making the adhesions at the leading edge. KIM127 mAb was added to migrating T cells and IRM analysis showed that the LFA-1 adhesions were stabilized as shown in Figure 3 (Figure 10). We then added either beta2-actinin or control peptide to explore any effect on the KIM127+ adhesions. Over 200 s, the dark contrast KIM127-stabilized LFA-1 adhesions diminished in the beta2-actinin peptide-treated T cells (Figure 10; Supplementary Video 5A). In contrast, there was no effect on KIM127 adhesions with control peptide (Figure 10; Supplementary Video 5B) or untreated cells (data not shown). We conclude that it is intermediate-affinity KIM127+ LFA-1 that forms the critical attachment to alpha-actinin at the leading edge essential for spreading and migration of the T cell.

As well as binding to alpha-actinin-1, the beta2 subunit also binds to talin and shares the talin-binding site with phosphatidylinositol phosphate kinase type 1gamma (PIPK1gamma) (S745-T758) (de Pereda et al, 2005). In a recent publication, a second talin-binding site has been mapped on the beta subunit that, together with the PIPK1gamma site, supports the activation of integrin (Wegener et al, 2007). This newly identified sequence incorporates the alpha-actinin-1-binding site and raises the possibility that the beta subunit might bind alpha-actinin-1 and talin sequentially. Our previous results showed that LFA-1 interacted with talin in the mid-cell focal zone region (Smith et al, 2005). We therefore used fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) to ask first whether we could detect any close contact between LFA-1 and alpha-actinin-1 in the lamella, focal zone or uropod regions on migrating T cells and, secondly, whether the region of the beta2 cytoplasmic tail covered by the beta2-actinin peptide served as the binding site for alpha-actinin-1 in the migrating cell.

Acceptor depletion FRET (adFRET) is a variation of the FRET technique, where an increase in donor signal following photobleaching of acceptor indicates that FRET had been occurring before the photobleaching step, but was quenched by the acceptor of donor fluorescence (Di et al, 2005). We asked whether an adFRET signal could be detected between LFA-1 containing a GFP-tagged beta2 subunit and endogenous alpha-actinin-1 labelled with Alexa546-conjugated anti-alpha-actinin-1 mAb. GFP-LFA-1 displayed a positive FRET signal, with alpha-actinin-1 at the leading edge of the HSB-2 T cells that was not detected either in the focal zone or the uropod (Figure 11A). This result indicates that LFA-1 is within 1-10 nm of alpha-actinin-1 at the leading edge, but not in the other two compartments of the migrating cell.

To further confirm that the beta2-actinin peptide blocked LFA-1 binding to alpha-actinin-1 at the front of the cell (Pavalko and LaRoche, 1993), we tested its effect on the adFRET signal. GFP-LFA-1-expressing HSB-2 cells were pretreated with either the beta2-actinin or scrambled control peptides or no peptide. The beta2-actinin peptide was found to abrogate the FRET signal that was otherwise detectable in both untreated or control peptide-treated T cells (Figure 11B). These observations provide additional evidence that LFA-1 at the leading edge of the T cell migrating on ICAM-1 is directly engaged with alpha-actinin-1, and that the sequence on the beta2 subunit (H723-S742) covered by the beta2-actinin peptide is where this interaction occurs.

In this study we show that intermediate-affinity LFA-1 is expressed throughout the lamella of T cells migrating on ICAM-1 randomly or in response to a chemokine. These LFA-1 adhesions are characterized by expression of the KIM127 epitope, but not the 24 epitope, and are initiated at the leading edge. Exposure of T cells to mAb KIM127 during migration stabilizes the LFA-1 adhesions and effectively brings the cell to a halt, showing that intermediate-affinity LFA-1 plays a dominant role in T cell migration. Previous IRM studies using T cells migrating on ICAM-1 embedded in a lipid bilayer indicate that the LFA-1 found in this zone can comprise up to 80% of the contact with ligand ICAM-1 (Smith et al, 2005).

alpha-Actinin-1 has a number of functions in migrating cells (Otey and Carpen, 2004). By using siRNA knockdown and competitive inhibition with a mutated alpha-actinin-1 construct, we show that its ability to bind to actin is essential for T cell migration. The treated T cells remain attached to ICAM-1 in a talin-dependent manner, but fail to project membranes or spread. This is in keeping with a role for alpha-actinin-1 as an actin-bundling protein, a major function in other cell types (Otey and Carpen, 2004).

We have however focused on the subset of alpha-actinin-1 that binds to LFA-1 and show by colocalization and immunoprecipitation experiments that KIM127-expressing LFA-1 associates with alpha-actinin-1. A link between the beta subunit of beta1, beta2 and beta3 integrins and alpha-actinin-1 has been documented previously and the binding sequence identified (Pavalko and LaRoche, 1993; Otey and Carpen, 2004). The structure of the site on the beta1 integrin cytoplasmic tail where alpha-actinin-1 binds has been determined and confirms the importance of this sequence (Kelly and Taylor, 2005).

We show in several ways that binding of KIM127+ LFA-1 to alpha-actinin-1 has functional importance for T cell migration. T cells fail to migrate following knockdown of alpha-actinin-1 or more specific targeting of the binding site on the beta2 subunit for alpha-actinin-1 (H723-S742) with a peptide. FRET experiments revealed that this interaction occurs at the leading edge of the migrating T cell. Where LFA-1 binding to alpha-actinin-1 is prevented, the cells fail to attach and spread, although the T cell membrane continues to protrude. IRM images show reduced lamellipodial attachments in the presence of the LFA-1/alpha-actinin-1-blocking peptide. A direct functional link between KIM127+ LFA-1 and alpha-actinin-1 is provided by showing that the blocking peptide can disrupt the KIM127-stabilized adhesions. Thus, intermediate-affinity LFA-1 attachment to alpha-actinin-1 either generates or stabilizes LFA-1 adhesions that support spreading at the leading edge of the T cell. However, as the cells are more highly adherent when alpha-actinin-1 is knocked down, it is possible that the protein is needed for the turnover of established adhesions.

In fibroblasts, alpha-actinin-1 is present at the leading edge of the cell but not included in nascent adhesions containing small integrin clusters (Laukaitis et al, 2001; von Wichert et al, 2003; Wiseman et al, 2004). When alpha-actinin-1 is incorporated into these adhesions, a more mature focal complex is formed that aids the generation of force necessary for spreading and subsequent migration (von Wichert et al, 2003). This is in keeping with the idea that forward membrane protrusion is dependent upon turnover of adhesions at the leading edge to support strong propulsive forces (Beningo et al, 2001). Further investigation of events at the leading edge of T cells is needed to decide how close the parallels are with the spreading dynamics of fibroblasts.

Confocal and IRM images show that lamellar LFA-1 expressing the KIM127 epitope is in contact with ICAM-1. However, KIM127+ LFA-1 is also observed on the apical surface at the leading edge under conditions of rapid fixing of the T cells. A possibility is that KIM127+ LFA-1 might be released onto the membrane, potentially from intracellular vesicles (Fabbri et al, 2005). Another option is that there may be turnover and reuse of KIM127+ LFA-1/alpha-actinin-1 adhesions during spreading. Small mobile complexes of beta1 integrin and alpha-actinin-1 are detected on non-attached membranes of fibroblasts (Wiseman et al, 2004).

Another issue is whether the extended conformation of LFA-1 characterized by KIM127 expression is caused by association with alpha-actinin-1. We find that neither knockdown of alpha-actinin-1 (or talin) nor incubation with the beta2-actinin peptide alters KIM127 expression on migrating T cells, suggesting that alpha-actinin-1 binds to beta2 integrin as a secondary event following integrin activation (data not shown). These findings concur with those of Pavalko and co-workers who postulated that when neutrophils were stimulated, a conformational change occurs on the beta2 subunit, revealing the alpha-actinin-1-binding site (Sampath et al, 1998). This sequence of events is also in agreement with the results of Kinashi and co-workers who have evidence that LFA-1 activation through the Rap1 GTPase pathway induces KIM127+ LFA-1. Active Rap1V12 promotes KIM127 expression while dominant negative Rap1N17 blocks the expression induced by chemokine (T Kinashi, personal communication). Together, the data indicate that binding of LFA-1 to alpha-actinin-1 is secondary to its conversion from a bent to an extended conformation exposing the KIM127 epitope.

Intermediate-affinity LFA-1 is expressed at the leading edge of the cell and bound to alpha-actinin-1, whereas high-affinity LFA-1 bound to talin is located in the mid-cell focal zone (this study; Smith et al, 2005). The integrin beta subunit shares a well-defined binding site on the talin FERM domain with PIPK1gamma (de Pereda et al, 2005). Now a second talin site on the beta subunit has been mapped (Wegener et al, 2007), which overlaps the alpha-actinin-1-binding sequence (H723-S742) on the LFA-1 beta2 subunit (Pavalko and LaRoche, 1993). We made use of this sequence to make the beta2-actinin peptide and confirmed that it is used for alpha-actinin-1 binding by means of affinity chromatography and also FRET analysis, showing that the peptide interferes with the signal between LFA-1 and alpha-actinin-1. Therefore, this site on the beta2 subunit may be used both by alpha-actinin-1, talin and potentially other cytoplasmic proteins, and there may be competition for occupancy. Pavalko and co-workers have suggested that the beta2 subunit undergoes alternate cytoskeletal connections to talin and alpha-actinin-1 (Sampath et al, 1998). Using immunoprecipitation, they found that the neutrophil beta2 integrin cytoplasmic tail was associated first with talin, but following neutrophil stimulation, talin binding was lost due to calpain cleavage and an alpha-actinin-1-binding site was revealed. There is however no information yet as to whether LFA-1 exchanges alpha-actinin-1 for talin or vice versa as the T cell migrates. It is also possible that other cytoskeletal proteins might be involved. For example, vinculin contains a binding site used by both talin and alpha-actinin-1 (Kelly et al, 2006). As alpha-actinin-1 and talin are most highly concentrated in distinct compartments, it may be this spatial arrangement that determines the specific LFA-1 conformation associated with each cytoskeletal protein.

Insight into how the two active forms of LFA-1 function together to enable T cell migration comes from the stabilizing effect of the conformation-specific mAbs 24 and KIM127. The high-affinity 24+ focal zone LFA-1 provides adhesive stability by making firm attachments in the mid-cell region. Such anchoring would support the intermediate-affinity KIM127+ LFA-1, making more dynamic attachments, while the T cell scans a DC cell surface for antigen or an endothelial surface for an exit point through the vascular endothelium. Such a division of roles is also suggested by the behavior of neutrophils migrating through endothelium, where the leading edge of the neutrophil penetrates the cell layer leaving high levels of LFA-1 in a ring-like structure at the trailing edge on the endothelial surface (Shaw et al, 2004).

It is of interest that expression of intermediate-affinity LFA-1 at the leading edge of the T cell differs from migrating endothelial cells that display high-affinity alphavbeta3 in this location (Kiosses et al, 2001). Such an arrangement of high-affinity integrin at the leading edge might not be suitable for a fast moving T cell that needs to turn over membrane attachments rapidly, but might benefit a slower moving cell by allowing it to make firm contact with its surroundings as it adjusts its position within a particular tissue.

In summary, we have used mAbs specific for conformational epitopes as probes for intermediate- and high-affinity LFA-1 on migrating T cells. This approach has revealed for the first time that these two forms of active LFA-1 are expressed in two different regions of the migrating cell where they are associated with distinct cytoskeletal proteins and perform separate roles. These conformers of LFA-1 are also observed on T cells migrating on two other LFA-1 ligands, ICAM-2 and ICAM-3 (data not shown), and also on endothelial cells, indicating that they are also relevant in a more physiological context. The distinctive cellular locations for different forms of active LFA-1 would not be predicted from the total LFA-1 pattern that shows low-level expression throughout the lamellar region, with much higher levels in the focal zone and the projecting uropod (this study; Smith et al, 2005). This study highlights the flexibility of integrins as receptors in terms of their ability to modulate their affinity in accordance with function and independently of expression on the cell membrane.

Expression of LFA-1 activation epitopes on migrating T lymphocytes. T cells and freshly isolated primary T lymphocytes migrating on ICAM-1Fc-coated coverslips were fixed and permeabilized before labelling with either KIM127-Alexa546 or 24-Alexa546 addition. Freshly isolated T lymphocytes were exposed for 5 min to SDF-1 (CXCL12) to induce a migratory phenotype. Images are shown in a rainbow false color scale, with the highest expression in red and the lowest blue. The enlarged area of each leading edge is shown with a white box. Scale bar=10 mum.

Effect of mAb KIM127 on IRM imaging of a T cell migrating on ICAM-1. The image of a single representative T cell migrating on an ICAM-1-coated coverslip is shown with 10 mug/ml KIM127 added at 0 s. KIM127 stabilizes adhesions of leading edge 1 (see arrow) at 30 s shown by the formation of dark contact areas. The cell alters direction, forming leading edge 2, which also becomes stabilized (70 s). This is followed by stabilization of leading edge 3 (130 s) and the process continues until the cell can no longer move. Scale bar=5 mum.

Effect of beta2-actinin peptide on the IRM image of migrating T cells following treatment with KIM127. IRM images are shown of T cells that are pretreated with 10 mug/ml KIM127, resulting in KIM127-stabilized adhesions (see dark contact areas). The cells are then treated with either beta2-actinin or control peptide and the IRM image recorded after 200 s. The beta2-actinin peptide caused the KIM127 stabilized adhesions to diminish, whereas the control peptide had no effect. Scale bar=10 mum.

FRET analysis showing association between LFA-1 and alpha-actinin-1 at the leading edge of HSB-2 T cells. (A) AdFRET profile showing fluorescence intensity of acceptor Alexa546-labelled alpha-actinin-1 and donor GFP-LFA-1 for five frames before and five frames after photobleaching of the acceptor (n=10 for each zone tested). The increase in fluorescence intensity of donor LFA-1 occurs at the leading edge in the lamella of the migrating T cell but not in the focal zone or uropod. (B) AdFRET profiles at the leading edge were determined as in panel A for cells treated with beta2-actinin peptide, control peptide or no peptide. No FRET was seen with addition of beta2-actinin peptide, showing that LFA-1 does associate with alpha-actinin-1 through the beta2 cytoplasmic tail sequence covered by the beta2-actinin peptide.
