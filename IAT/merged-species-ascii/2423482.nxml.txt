Hereditary inclusion body myopathy (HIBM) is a rare neuromuscular disorder caused by mutations in GNE, the key enzyme in the biosynthetic pathway of sialic acid. While the mechanism leading from GNE mutations to the HIBM phenotype is not yet understood, we searched for proteins potentially interacting with GNE, which could give some insights about novel putative biological functions of GNE in muscle.

We used a Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR)-Biosensor based assay to search for potential GNE interactors in anion exchanged fractions of human skeletal muscle primary culture cell lysate. Analysis of the positive fractions by in vitro binding assay revealed alpha-actinin 1 as a potential interactor of GNE. The direct interaction of the two proteins was assessed in vitro by SPR-Biosensor based kinetics analysis and in a cellular environment by a co-immunoprecipitation assay in GNE overexpressing 293T cells. Furthermore, immunohistochemistry on stretched mouse muscle suggest that both GNE and alpha-actinin 1 localize to an overlapping but not identical region of the myofibrillar apparatus centered on the Z line.

Conclusions/Significance
###end title 6
###begin p 7
The interaction of GNE with alpha-actinin 1 might point to its involvement in alpha-actinin mediated processes. In addition these studies illustrate for the first time the expression of the non-muscle form of alpha-actinin, alpha-actinin 1, in mature skeletal muscle tissue, opening novel avenues for its specific function in the sarcomere. Although no significant difference could be detected in the binding kinetics of alpha-actinin 1 with either wild type or mutant GNE in our SPR biosensor based analysis, further investigation is needed to determine whether and how the interaction of GNE with alpha-actinin 1 in skeletal muscle is relevant to the putative muscle-specific function of alpha-actinin 1, and to the muscle-restricted pathology of HIBM.

Hereditary inclusion body myopathy (HIBM) is a unique neuromuscular disorder characterized by adult-onset, slowly progressive distal and proximal muscle weakness, presenting with an unusual feature, the sparing of the quadriceps. HIBM fibers have typical muscle pathology, including cytoplasmic rimmed vacuoles and cytoplasmic or nuclear filamentous inclusions composed of tubular filaments [1]. The disease is particularly common in the Jewish Persian community (with a prevalence of 1 in 1 500), and has been described also worldwide in non-Jewish families, particularly in Japan [2]. The GNE gene, encoding the bi-functional enzyme UDP-N-acetylglucosamine 2-epimerase/N-acetylmannosamine kinase (UDP-GlcNAc 2-epimerase/ManNAc kinase), is mutated in all HIBM patients studied to date. A single homozygous missense mutation, M712T, located at exon 12 of the gene, within its kinase domain, was identified in all Persian and other Middle Eastern Jewish and non-Jewish HIBM patients [3]. Other missense mutations in GNE have been identified in HIBM patients worldwide [4]-[7]. GNE catalyzes two sequential steps in the biosynthetic pathway of sialic acid [8], the most abundant terminal monosaccharide on glycoconjugates of eukaryotic cells [9]. The process by which mutations in this enzyme lead to the disease is not yet understood, and the issue of hyposialylation in HIBM muscles is still not resolved [10]-[13]. To find out whether GNE has other yet unknown biological functions in muscle tissue, which could be involved in the pathogenesis of HIBM, we tried to identify potential partners interacting with GNE. Such interactions could give some clue about novel pathways involving GNE, besides its known function in sialylation, and as such, could be evaluated for potential involvement in HIBM pathophysiology. We used an optical SPR-biosensor (Surface Plasmon Resonance) system, BIAcore [14], [15], to test GNE's interactions. This analysis, followed by in vitro binding assay and mass spectrometry, led to the identification of two potential GNE binding proteins. Using kinetics BIAcore analysis, co-IP and confocal microscopy, we show that one of them, alpha-actinin 1, interacts with GNE both in vitro and in vivo.

A previously established and well characterized skeletal muscle primary cell culture [16], derived from deltoid biopsy of a 46 years old healthy male donor, was used in this study. Cells at passage 8 were grown till sub-confluency in 75 cm2 flasks, treated with trypsin, collected and washed twice in ice-cold PBS. Cell pellets were suspended in hypotonic ice-cold lysis buffer (100 microl/106 cells; 10 mM NaPi buffer pH 8, 0.1 mM EDTA, 0.1 mM DTT, 1 mM PMSF, 17 microg/ml Aprotinin, 10 microg/ml leupeptin, 1 mM Vanadate, 20 Mm beta-Glycerophosphate), incubated on ice for 30', lysed by 20 strokes through a 26 gauge needle, and centrifuged (14,000 rpm for 30' at 4degreesC). Protein concentration was determined using Bradford Reagent (SIGMA). Fresh protein lysate was used on the same day for anion exchanged chromatography.

All experiments were carried out using BIAcore 3000 (BIAcore, Uppsala, Sweden) and sensor chip CM5 (BIAcore), at 25degreesC. For activating the chip, EDC/NHS amine coupling protocol was used according to BIAcore protocol (). WT and mutant GNE proteins (100 microg/ml), in 10 mM acetate pH 6, were immobilized to give about 3000 RU in the analyte identification experiments and up to 600 RU in the kinetics experiments. The running buffer used was Na-phosphate buffer (10 mM NaPi pH 7.5, 100 mM NaCl, 0.1 mM EDTA, 0.1 mM DTT) for the identification experiments, and Tris buffer (20 mM Tris pH 7.5, 100-300 mM NaCl, 0.1 mM DTT, 2 mM CaCl2) for the kinetics. The flow rates were 10 microl/min and 30 microl/min respectively. Regeneration of the chip was done with 10 microl 3 M NaCl in 100 mM NaOH. BIAevaluation software version 4.1 was used to evaluate the results, and 1:1 Langmuier model to fit the experimental results in order to calculate the affinity and kinetics constants.

Reduction, alkylation and trypsinization steps were carried out in the gel as usual [17]. After extraction of the peptides from the gel with 60% CH3CN 1% CHOOH solution, and evaporation to dryness, the samples were rehydrated with 1 microl of CH3CN 1% CHOOH solution, and then diluted with 9 microl of 1% CHOOH. The peptide mixtures were either solid phase extracted with C18 resin filled tip (ZipTip; Milipore, Billerica, MA, USA) and nanosprayed into the Qtof2 MS system in 50% CH3CN 1% CHOOH solution, or injected to 0.75 microl C18 column on a capillary HPLC system (CapLC; Waters, Milford, MA, USA) coupled to the MS. MS/MS was carried out with Qtof2 (Micromass, Manchester, UK) using nanospray attachment [18]. Data analysis was done using the biolynx package V4.0 (Micromass), and database searches were performed with the Mascot package (Matrix Science, London, UK). Precursor-ion mass tolerance 1.2, fragment-ion mass tolerance 0.6, one missed cleavage, modifications allowed: Carbamidomethyl (C), Oxidation (M), Propionamide (C). Ions score is -10*Log(P), where P is the probability that the observed match is a random event. Individual ions scores >55 indicate identity or extensive homology (p<0.05). Protein scores are derived from ions scores as a non-probabilistic basis for ranking protein hits. The database searched was NCBInr 20060831 (3894824 sequences; 1340658132 residues). Five unique peptides were identified matching several members of the alpha-actinin family (actinin1, 2, 3, 4); nevertheless only one member of the family, alpha-actinin 1, aligned to each of the five peptides with 100% identity.

Samples were washed in PBS three times, then blocked with 2% BSA in PBS for 10 min and incubated for 1 h at room temperature with a polyclonal antibody (pAb) alpha-actinin-1 (3A2; 1:100; Courtesy Prof Alan Beggs) [21]. After washing in PBS, cells were incubated 30' at RT with the secondary antibody, Cy3-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (1:250; Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, West Grove, PA), diluted in 2% BSA/PBS.

Freshly-harvested mouse spinalis muscle was lightly stretched in the longitudinal direction by clamping the opposite ends of the muscle onto a piece of cardboard (covered with aluminium foil). The muscle was fixed in 3% paraformaldehyde for 10 minutes at room temperature, covered in Tissue-tek and snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen-cooled isopentane. The muscle was stored in liquid nitrogen until required. Frozen muscle sections (5 microm) were blocked in 2% bovine serum albumin (BSA) in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) for 10 minutes. After rinsing in PBS, sections were incubated overnight at 4degreesC in primary antibody. Primary antibodies were monoclonal antibody alpha-actinin-2 (1:400; Sigma, St. Louis, MO), polyclonal antibody (pAb) alpha-actinin-1 (3A2; 1:100; Courtesy Prof Alan Beggs) and polyclonal antibody GNE (1:100, Courtesy Dr Sabine Krause) [22]. After washing in PBS, sections were blocked as mentioned above and then incubated for 3 hours at room temperature in secondary antibodies. Secondary antibodies were Cy3-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (1:250; Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, West Grove, PA) and Alexa Fluor 488 goat anti-rabbit IgG (1:200; Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR). Sections were washed by immersion in PBS for 30 min and mounted on 22x50 mm2 glass coverslips using Fluorsave mounting reagent (Calbiochem, SanDiego, CA).

A freshly prepared lysate from human primary skeletal muscle culture cells (15 mg total protein content) was fractionated by anion-exchange chromatography to produce 26 fractions (Figure 1A). Interaction between GNE and the different fractions was tested using SPR technology. Freshly prepared normal and mutant (M712T) GNE proteins were immobilized on a CM5 chip using an amine coupling protocol. 50 microl of each of the fractions were injected over the immobilized chip. Binding signals were obtained, in fractions #12-16 which were eluted in 340-620 mM NaCl (Figure 1B). Similar results were obtained with the mutant GNE protein. Two pools of positive fractions (#11-13 and #14-16) were further analyzed by in vitro binding assay.

In order to recognize the relevant proteins within the skeletal muscle lysate fractions which gave a positive GNE-binding signal, the pooled fractions (#11-13 and #14-16) were incubated with GNE-bound nickel beads. Two negative controls were used: Ni-NTA beads which were not bound to GNE were incubated with the same fractions, and GNE-bound Ni-NTA beads were incubated with lysis buffer. Bound proteins were eluted from the beads, resolved by a gradient SDS-PAGE and visualized by Gelcode reagent staining (Figure 2). The candidate bands, as well as the corresponding gel-areas or bands of the negative-controls, were cut from the gel for analysis by MS. Among all MS-identified proteins, only two were not found in negative controls. Those two proteins were identified as alpha-actinin 1 (103 kDa) and lactate dehydrogenase B (LDH-B) (36 kDa) (Table 1).

The putative interaction between GNE and alpha-actinin 1 was tested directly using BIAcore. 15 microl of 5 microM alpha-actinin 1, diluted in Tris buffer containing 300 mM NaCl, were injected over immobilized GNE. Specific binding signals were obtained with both WT and mutant GNE proteins. The kinetics of these interactions were studied in order to determine their affinity and kinetics constants, and whether any differences in the affinity binding between WT and mutant GNE proteins could be detected. The results are shown on Figure 3 and Table 2. No consistent difference was obtained between the interactions of alpha-actinin 1 with WT compared to mutant GNE, in four independent assays. As a control for GNE-alpha-actinin 1 interaction specificity, 1-10 microM BSA were injected, and no interaction was detected. Since alpha-actinin 1 is calcium-sensitive [23], we analyzed the effect of CaCl2 on the interaction affinity between GNE and alpha-actinin 1, by replacing the 2 mM CaCl2 by 2 mM EDTA in the Tris buffer. Excluding CaCl2 decreased the affinity of both WT and mutant GNE to alpha-actinin 1 by ten fold (for WT, 6.8x10-8 M and 2.56x10-7 M, with and without CaCl2, respectively; for mutant, 4.5x10-8 M and 3.9x10-7 M, with and without CaCl2, respectively). The same result was obtained in two independent analyses, indicating that although this interaction is calcium independent in principle, calcium has a significant positive effect on it.

The putative interaction between GNE and LDH-B was tested as well. Various concentrations of LDH-B (1-27 microM) were injected in different buffers (Tris HEPES, PBS or NaPi), but no interaction was detected. Figure 4A shows the results obtained for alpha-actinin 1-GNE versus LDH-B-GNE interactions when tested at the same conditions: a binding signal was obtained with alpha-actinin 1, but not with LDH-B. As shown in Figure 4B, 2 microM LDH-B did not have any effect on the binding of 0.5 microM actinin to GNE, excluding the hypothesis that LDH-B may act as a co-factor for GNE-alpha-actinin 1 interaction. Therefore a direct interaction between GNE and LDH-B could not be demonstrated in vitro by BIAcore analysis.

To verify whether the interaction between GNE and alpha-actinin takes place also in a cellular environment, we performed co-immunoprecipitation experiments using human 293T cells, overexpressing the FLAG-GNE protein (293T-FG, or shortly T). As a negative control, we used untransfected 293T cells (UT) (Figure 5). alpha-Actinin is highly expressed in both cell types (Figure 5). By immunoprecipitation of cell protein lysates with anti-FLAG antibody bound beads, alpha-actinin was not detected with FLAG-GNE (data not shown). To test the possibility that the interaction is disrupted during the cell lysing process, proteins were crosslinked with DSP within the intact cells prior to their extraction. This crosslinker is membrane permeable, and can be cleaved by boiling the protein samples in 5% beta-ME containing SDS-sample buffer. The effect of DSP crosslinking on both proteins was verified by western blot analyses with anti-FLAG and anti alpha-actinin antibodies (Figure 5A). Cell lysates (5 microg) were diluted in SDS-sample buffer, with or without 5% beta-ME. In the absence of beta-ME, the signal of both proteins was detected at the upper region of the SDS-PAGE gel, equivalent to MW of 250 kDa or higher, while beta-ME treatment resolved the crosslinking and resulted in two distinct signals corresponding to the molecular weights of FLAG-GNE (75 kDa) (Figure 5A-1) and alpha-actinin (100 kDa) (Figure 5A-2). After immunoprecipitation with the anti-FLAG bound beads, the eluted protein samples were analyzed by western blot with anti-alpha-actinin and anti-FLAG antibodies. As shown in Figure 5B, both alpha-actinin and FLAG-GNE were detected only in the sample originating from 293T-FG cells, but not in UT control cells. Our results demonstrate that alpha actinin coimmunoprecipitates with FLAG-GNE in 293T-FG cells.

alpha-Actinin 1 is generally regarded as one of the non-muscle isoforms of alpha-actinin family. To confirm that it is expressed in muscle cells rather than in non-muscle structures within muscles (such as blood vessels), we examined its expression in a mouse myoblast line (C2C12 cells). Indeed, alpha-actinin 1 antibody stained undifferentiated and differentiated myoblasts (Figure 6). To assess the expression of GNE and alpha-actinin 1 in mature muscle, we co-stained each of the polyclonal antibodies anti alpha-actinin 1 and anti GNE with an antibody to the muscle Z line marker sarcomeric actinin (alpha-actinin 2) in mouse stretched spinalis muscle (Figure 7). Both alpha-actinin1 (Figure 7A) and GNE (Figure 7B) antibodies recognized an overlapping but not fully superimposed striated pattern: antibodies to both proteins stained around or close to the muscle Z line, as well as a fainter staining at the sarcomeric M line. However the localization around the Z line differed between the 2 proteins in stretched muscle, with GNE forming a diffuse band centered on the Z line, while alpha-actinin 1 is found as two distinct bands on either side of the Z line, suggesting that GNE and alpha-actinin 1 are expressed in distinct but overlapping compartments in skeletal muscle.

The GNE gene is mutated in all HIBM patients [3], but the role of the altered GNE protein leading to the disease phenotype is not yet understood. The aim of our study was to search for potential GNE protein interactors which could unravel novel functions of GNE, possibly not related to its well known role in the biosynthesis of sialic acids. Since previous traditional co-immunoprecipitation assays for identification of GNE protein partners did not yield any positive results, we used BIAcore, an optical SPR-bio sensor (Surface Plasmon Resonance) system, to test GNE's interactions. BIAcore is generally used for kinetic characterization of a known interaction between two biomolecules. Since we had no clue about the identity of the potential GNE binding proteins in muscle cells, we applied the BIAcore system as a bioassay similar to the one described by Catimel et al. [24], who immobilized proteins onto the sensor chip and affinity purified binding partners from chromatographically enriched cell lysates. We immobilized WT and mutant (M712T) GNE proteins to the BIAcore sensor chip, and run through it anion exchanged fractions of human skeletal muscle primary culture cell lysate. Analysis of fractions showing binding signal by in vitro binding assay revealed two potential protein partners of GNE, LDH-B and alpha-actinin 1. While a direct interaction of GNE with LDH-B could not be shown by kinetics BIAcore analysis, this assay clearly illustrated the binding between GNE and alpha-actinin 1. Further, we showed by a co-IP assay that GNE and alpha-actinin interact in a cellular environment, and by immunohistochemistry, that GNE and alpha-actinin 1 are expressed in distinct but overlapping compartments in skeletal muscle.

alpha-Actinin 1 is one of the four family members of alpha-actinins (1-4), which belong to the spectrin protein superfamily including the spectrins and dystrophin [25]. alpha-Actinin is an actin binding and crosslinking protein, a homodimer with 100 kDa subunits which can be visualized as a long rod-shaped molecule by electron microscopy [23]. The alpha-actinins are known to be present in multiple subcellular compartments, including cell-cell and cell-matrix contact sites, cellular protrusions and stress fiber dense regions [26]. One of the protein isoforms, alpha-actinin 4, was found to be localized also to the nucleus in various cancer cell lines [27], [28], as well as in a differentiated skeletal muscle cell line [29]. GNE is an enzyme primarily localized in the cytosol (8). However, it was shown to be attached to the Golgi complex and in the nucleus of mammalian cells as well [22].

Binding of calcium to the non-muscle alpha-actinins (1 and 4) changes the conformation of the protein and inhibits its actin binding capacity [30]. In contrast, muscle alpha-actinins (2 and 3) are calcium insensitive since alternative splicing abolished their calcium binding ability [25]. Interestingly, we found that calcium has a significant positive effect on alpha-actinin 1 interaction with GNE. Further analysis is needed in order to recognize the precise site of interaction in both GNE and alpha-actinin 1, and to clarify how the conformational change caused by calcium binding improves this interaction.

The alpha-actinins contribute to both the stability and the plasticity of actin-based arrays [26]. In addition to their function as actin-crosslinking proteins, alpha-actinins have been found to interact with a large number of protein partners, and to play multiple roles in cells, including linking of the cytoskeleton to various transmembrane proteins, diverse signaling pathways, and regulating the activity of a variety of receptors [26]. In light of recent reports on the interaction in nerve cells between GNE and a brain specific protein involved in the modulation of the cytoskeleton, CRMP1 [31], and on the possible involvement of GNE in pAkt signaling pathways [16], the interaction of GNE with alpha-actinin 1 could point to the involvement of GNE in one or more of these processes.

Although the interaction of HIBM mutant GNE with alpha-actinin 1, as measured by BIAcore, could not be significantly distinguished from that of the wild-type protein, we cannot rule out the possibility that any micro-change in this interaction might contribute to HIBM pathophysiology. It might be that in vivo the mutant GNE binds to alpha-actinin 1 in a slightly different manner or affinity, and therefore the effect of this change is not seen in normal biological conditions, but it has a deleterious effect on HIBM cells upon long term stress conditions. Since the BIAcore in vitro assay cannot mimic in vivo stress conditions, further experiments in cellular environments, designed to test the differences between the interactions of mutant and WT GNEs with alpha-actinins, are needed in order to test this hypothesis. Another possibility of how the BIAcore in vitro conditions may conceal a difference between GNE wt and GNE M712T in actinin interaction may derive from the different oligomeric forms of the enzyme. GNE assembles in two oligomeric states, a tetramer with full enzymatic activity and a dimmer only possessing ManNAc kinase activity [32]. The relatively rough conditions for immobilization of recombinant GNE on the BIAcore chip most likely cause the decay of the tetramer and only dimmers are available in the interaction assay. A difference of tetrameric wt versus mutant GNE in actinin interaction can therefore not be excluded and should be analyzed by other methods, e.g. pull-down assays with pre-purified tetrameric or dimeric GNE. However, the possibility that tetrameric GNE cannot interact with actinin at all can be ruled out, as the conditions of the co-immunoprecipitation assay maintain the native, tetrameric state of the enzyme in cells.

In contrast to the sarcomeric isoforms of alpha-actinin (2 and 3), which are components of the sarcomeric Z disc where they crosslink actin filaments and stabilize the muscle contractile apparatus [25], alpha-actinin 1 and 4 are considered as the non-muscle isoforms of the protein. Therefore, we were surprised to find the GNE interactor expressed in skeletal muscle primary culture to be alpha-actinin 1. Interestingly, this is not the first evidence for the expression of non-muscle alpha-actinins in a myogenic cell line. Endo and Masaki [33] found that both skeletal and smooth muscle actinins are expressed in cultured embryonic chicken pectoralis cells. The two proteins were found at separate locations within the cells; skeletal muscle alpha-actinin was absent in myoblasts and was restricted to Z discs in myotubes. Smooth muscle alpha-actinin was diffused in the cytoplasm and on membrane-associated structures of myoblasts, and then confined to membrane-associated structures of myotubes. In contrast, Goffart et al. reported recently [29] that both alpha-actinin 1 and 4 are expressed in C2F3 cells, a subclone of the myogenic mouse C2C12 line. The two proteins were found to be expressed in both myoblasts and myotubes. alpha-Actinin 1 was present in the cytosol of both cell types, while alpha-actinin 4 was localized to both cytoplasm and nucleus of myoblasts, and mainly to the nucleus of myotubes. In the present study we have confirmed that alpha-actinin 1 is expressed in C2C12 muscle cultures, excluding the possibility that expression of alpha-actinin-1 in skeletal muscle is limited to smooth muscle structures such as blood vessels. To assess the relevance of our findings in mature muscle tissue, we examined the expression of alpha-actinin 1 and GNE in mouse stretched spinalis muscle. While the localization of the two proteins is distinct, a substantial degree of overlap provides preliminary evidence that the interaction observed in vitro may plausibly occur in vivo in mouse skeletal muscle. Further comprehensive investigation is needed to elucidate the precise localization of alpha-actinin 1 and GNE in the myofibrillar apparatus centered on the Z line, and the relevance of alpha-actinin 1 function in skeletal muscle to its interaction with GNE in general, and to HIBM pathophysiology in particular.
