Background

###begin p 3
While all codons that specify amino acids are universally recognized by tRNA molecules, codons signaling termination of translation are recognized by proteins known as class-I release factors (RF). In most eukaryotes and archaea a single RF accomplishes termination at all three stop codons. In most bacteria, there are two RFs with overlapping specificity, RF1 recognizes UA(A/G) and RF2 recognizes U(A/G)A.

First, we hypothesize that orthologues of the E. coli K12 pseudogene prfH encode a third class-I RF that we designate RFH. Second, it is likely that RFH responds to signals other than conventional stop codons. Supporting evidence comes from the following facts: (i) A number of bacterial genomes contain prfH orthologues with no discernable interruptions in their ORFs. (ii) RFH shares strong sequence similarity with other class-I bacterial RFs. (iii) RFH contains a highly conserved GGQ motif associated with peptidyl hydrolysis activity (iv) residues located in the areas supposedly interacting with mRNA and the ribosomal decoding center are highly conserved in RFH, but different from other RFs. RFH lacks the functional, but non-essential domain 1. Yet, RFH-encoding genes are invariably accompanied by a highly conserved gene of unknown function, which is absent in genomes that lack a gene for RFH. The accompanying gene is always located upstream of the RFH gene and with the same orientation. The proximity of the 3' end of the former with the 5' end of the RFH gene makes it likely that their expression is co-regulated via translational coupling. In summary, RFH has the characteristics expected for a class-I RF, but likely with different specificity than RF1 and RF2.

Testing the hypothesis
###end title 6
###begin p 7
The most puzzling question is which signals RFH recognizes to trigger its release function. Genetic swapping of RFH mRNA recognition components with its RF1 or RF2 counterparts may reveal the nature of RFH signals.

Implications of the hypothesis
###end title 8
###begin p 9
The hypothesis implies a greater versatility of release-factor like activity in the ribosomal A-site than previously appreciated. A closer study of RFH may provide insight into the evolution of the genetic code and of the translational machinery responsible for termination of translation.

The synthesis of all mRNA-encoded proteins is performed by the ribosome. To decode mRNA, ribosomes use mediator molecules to link codon identity and meaning. For codons specifying amino acids, tRNA molecules serve as the mediators. Specific matching of codons and tRNAs is accomplished on ribosomes which select cognate tRNAs based on features of the geometry of the corresponding codon:anticodon duplexes [1]. In contrast, for codons that are signals for termination of translation, protein molecules serve the role as the mediators. These proteins recognize the three stop codons in mRNA and are termed class-I release factors (RFs) [2]. In most eukaryotes and archaea (except for special cases described below) there is a single RF responsible for termination at all three stop codons [3]. In most bacteria, there are two RFs with overlapping selectivity to stop codons [4,5]; RF1 recognizes UA(A/G) stop codons, and RF2 recognizes U(A/G)A stop codons.

RF1 and RF2 share significant sequence and structural similarity [6-8]. The proteins are organized in four protein domains that play different functional roles [9]. Domain 3 contains a GGQ motif that is believed to be responsible for hydrolysis of the peptidyl bond during termination. The GGQ motif is the sole universally conserved motif in class-I RFs from all kingdoms of life [3,10]. Domains 2 and 4 together form a superdomain that is responsible for stop codon recognition in mRNA. This superdomain shares significant structural and sequence similarity between RF1 and RF2. Two Gly residues in the tip of the alpha 5 helix (boxed in Fig 1A) are thought to be in contact with the uridine in the first position of the stop codon exposed in the ribosomal A-site [9]. These two Gly residues are universally conserved in all bacterial RF1 and RF2 sequences [11]. There are specific conserved differences between RF1 and RF2 associated with different stop codon selectivity of these factors. Genetic studies demonstrated that these differences involve the PXT motif in RF1 and the SP(F/Y) motif situated in the corresponding position in RF2 [12,13]. Since these motifs can be compared to tRNA anticodons, they are sometimes referred to as the "RF anticodons". We will use this term further for simplicity. Biochemical data [14,15] followed by structural studies revealed that such "RF anticodons" are in close proximity (if not in direct contact) to positions 2 and 3 of stop codons [9,16-18]. Domain 1 is thought to bind to the class-II release factor RF3 (GTPase that promotes activity and recycling of class-I RFs [19]). This is the least conserved domain in RFs and it is differently oriented in RFs upon binding to the ribosome [9,16-18]. This domain is not essential for the function of RFs in stop codon recognition and peptidyl hydrolysis [13].

Sequence comparison of release factors and structural model of RFH. A. Multiple alignment of RF sequences from bacteria with three RFs numbered according to the E. coli RF2 sequence. The N- and C-termini of RF1 and RF2 are not present in RFH and are excluded from the alignment. Abbreviations for organisms and gene bank accession numbers for complete genomes are: B.the - Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron VPI-5482 []; C.ace - Clostridium acetobutylicum []; Burk (or B.xen) - Burkholderia xenovorans (JGI, see text); E.car - Erwinia carotovora []; E.col - Escherichia coli CFT073 []; M.deg - Microbulbifer degradans (JGI, see text); P.aer - Pseudomonas aerugenosa []; R sol - Ralstonia solanacearum []; S.fle - Shigella flexneri 2a []; S.typ - Salmonella typhi CT18 []. Conserved residues are highlighted in color. The red color is used for those residues that are conserved in all three RF families. Green is used for residues that are specifically conserved for one type of factor, i.e. 100% conserved in RF1 and never appears in RFH or RF2. The remaining conserved residues are differentially shadowed in grey. The conserved deletion and insertion in RFH is marked in yellow and purple respectively. Boxes mark the occurrence of functionally important sequence motifs: the GG/GP motif contacting position one of the stop codon, the anticodon motifs and the GGQ-motif. Multiple alignment was produced using ClustalW [23]. B. Cartoon representation of the model of RFH colored as in panel A. The model was made using the program Modeller [44], with pdb-files 2B9M and 2B64 (chain Y) as structural models and the above alignment as input. The figure has been produced using PyMol [45]. Areas corresponding to the peptidyl transferase center (PTC) and mRNA positions are marked in light blue. The GP, GGQ and SXY motifs are marked with arrows. C. Cartoon representation of a superposition of the structural model of RFH (blue), A-site tRNA (green) and Thermus thermophilus RF2 (red). RF2 and tRNA are from pdb-files 2B9M and 1HIX. Only domains not present in RFH are shown from RF2 (residues 1-114 and 320-364, T. term numbering).

In 1992, Pel et al [20] identified an E. coli K12 genomic element encoding a protein sequence that shares significant similarity with RF1 and RF2 and named it prfH (protein release factor homologue). Here we analyzed the numerous bacterial genome sequences that have since become available and revealed that many bacteria encode prfH orthologs, which contain no discernable ORF interruptions. It has also become evident that the original E. coli K12 prfH gene was N-terminally truncated. To our knowledge, expression of the prfH gene in any bacteria has never been shown. Detailed analysis of protein sequences encoded by these genes and modeling a corresponding three-dimensional structure led us to the hypothesis that these genes encode a class-I RF that terminates protein synthesis at unknown signals. In this article, we describe supportive evidence for this hypothesis, its implication for a basic understanding of translation termination in bacteria and suggest experiments that will help to elucidate the particular function of the prfH-encoded protein that we further call RFH.

We have analyzed 311 completed bacterial genomes available at NCBI [21] on 20th of May 2006 for the presence of Class-I RFs using ARFA program [22] Our analysis revealed that 23 of them contain either intact or disrupted ORFs encoding RFH. Figure 1 shows an alignment of RF1, RF2 and RFH sequences from representative bacteria that encode all three factors (Fig. 1A) and a structural model of RFH (Fig.1B) highlighting the differential conservation pattern between RFH, RF1 and RF2 (see figure legend for details). We provide an alignment of all release factors from analyzed bacteria in the nexus format [see Additional file 1]. Nucleotide sequences were extracted using custom designed perl scripts and ARFA program [22]. Protein sequences were aligned using ClustalW [23], then protein alignment was backtranslated to obtain codon alignment.

First, it is clear that all three factors share significant similarity in the area of the peptidyl hydrolysis domain including the GGQ motif (Fig. 1A). Due to the presence of this motif in RFH it is placed in the same cluster of orthologous groups (COG1186J) with RF1, RF2 and yaeJ (function is unknown) [24]. RFH shares similarity with other RFs throughout its entire sequence (in some genomes it is mistakenly annotated as RF2 [22]). yaeJ similarity is limited to GGQ motif and it is highly distinct from RFs in other areas of its sequence. More strikingly, RFH sequences from different bacteria have their most conserved residues in the areas corresponding to those known to have functional importance in class-I RFs. Most interestingly, the putative RFH "anticodon" is SXY which is somewhat similar to the RF2 anticodon SP(F/Y). In addition, the alignment contains a conserved gap of three amino acids corresponding to the RFH anticodon loop (shown in yellow on Fig. 1). In the area of contact of RFs with the first position of the stop codon (boxed in the alignment), RFH has a conserved GP sequence instead of the strictly conserved GG in RF1 and RF2. Finally, in RFH there is one additional amino acid in the loop around position 172 (E. coli RF2 numbering, purple in Fig. 1B). All together, these combined differences suggest different codon specificity for RFH. In addition, a substitution of negative Glu residues with positive residues in the area of the mRNA recognition domain changes specificity of RFs [25,26]. At least one such change is obvious at the position adjacent to the RF2 "anticodon" from the C-terminus. In RFH there is a universal positive Arg residue instead of the usually negative residue in RF1 and RF2.

The most dramatic difference between RFH and the other two factors is the lack of the N-terminal coiled coil domain 1 (Fig. 1B and 1C). This domain is the least conserved of the RF domains and it is in a different orientation in RF1 and in RF2 bound to ribosomes [9,18]. Studies of the in vivo and in vitro effect of swapping or deleting the N-terminal domain show that this domain has no effect on codon specificity, but is necessary to stimulate nucleotide exchange on the Class-II RF, RF3 [13]. It is noteworthy that the N-terminal domain is not necessary for in vitro peptide release, and that truncated RF1 functions in vivo, and has a similar conformation in solution [6]. It has been suggested by small-angle X-ray scattering analysis that domain 1 is flexible in solution [6]. This further adds to the impression that domain 1 is not an integrated part of the essential RF activity, but could have been added in the course of evolution for optimizing the process of peptide release, when RF3-mediated recycling, via the contact with domain 1, speed up the overall termination process. Moreover, the RF3 encoding gene, prfC is not essential in E. coli [27,28] and its orthologs have not been identified in bacteria with small genomes. Thus, despite the lack of domain 1, RFH could be a fully active class-I RF, capable of promoting peptidyl-tRNA hydrolysis and polypeptide chain release.

RFH resembles the shape of a tRNA molecule more closely than RF1 or RF2 (Fig. 1C), mostly due to the lack of domain 1. The close resemblance to the shape of a tRNA molecule further supports our hypothesis, that RFH has its natural active site in the ribosomal A-site, as other RFs.
###end p 23

In summary, RFH is very similar to other RFs in the area of the peptidyl hydrolysis domain that accomplishes the basic function in all class-I RFs. Additionally it shares significant similarity in the areas responsible for mRNA recognition, but contains a number of conserved changes specific to RFH, suggesting that its recognition properties differ from those of RF1 and RF2. The overall pattern of conservation within RFH is nearly the same as in RF1 and RF2 strongly suggesting that RFH functions as a class-I RF.

Analysis of the sequence surrounding the RFH gene in different bacteria shows that in each observed case there is a specific gene 5' of the RFH gene (Fig. 2). These upstream genes share significant sequence similarity. Genes that share the same level of sequence similarity are absent in those bacteria that lack RFH. The putative proteins encoded by these upstream genes belong to a larger superfamily of RtcB-like proteins. Members of this superfamily are present in all kingdoms of life, but their functions are unknown [29], although it has been suggested that they are associated with tRNA or rRNA processing [30]. The crystal structure of archaeal RtcB was recently solved [31]. Unfortunately, its structure does not offer even faint inklings regarding RtcB function, though it revealed a novel protein fold. Translation of the RFH gene and its accompanying upstream gene is likely coupled, e.g. the stop codon of the 5' gene and the start codon for the RFH encoding sequence are always in very close proximity and their ORFs often overlap. Conserved co-regulation of translation suggests a relation between functions and conserved co-localization in bacteria [32,33] and points to physical interactions between the encoded products [34]. Perhaps the most obvious suggestion for the potential function of the product of the upstream gene is that it substitutes the missing domain 1. However, there is no detectable sequence similarity between RF domain 1 and the translation product of the upstream gene, nor any structural similarity to the protein fold of rtcB, and thus there is no apparent reason to believe that the upstream gene product has a function corresponding to the function of domain 1. Another speculative idea links a suggested function of the upstream gene with tRNA/mRNA processing to RF activity [30]. It is possible that a (specific) tRNA modifying enzyme would cause a codon specific translational stop, which could then be terminated by RFH action. Another option is that RFH releases stalled ribosomes, assisted by mRNA or perhaps even rRNA modifications by the upstream gene.

Hints regarding the RFH functional role potentially could be obtained from its evolutionary history. For example, if RFH were a progenitor of RF1 and RF2, it would be reasonable to expect that it was responsible for termination of protein synthesis at all stop codons. This would imply that the versions of RFH that we see in less than 10% of bacteria are remnants of a decaying gene that is being substituted with more efficient specialized RF1 and RF2. On the contrary, if RFH gene is a product of a recent duplication of one of the modern variants of RF1 or RF2 genes, it could be expected that its function is specific for certain bacterial lineages that share either specific environmental conditions or certain aspects of metabolism (similarly to distribution of Pyl-insertion machinery among methanogenic organisms [35]). In such a scenario, the existence of a significant proportion of bacteria with prfH pseudogenes would be an indicator of unsuccessful horizontal gene transfer events, rather than an indicator of lineage specific gene loss.

To attempt to discriminate between different potential evolutionary scenarios for prfH, we attempted to perform phylogenetic reconstruction of all bacterial RF genes. For this purpose, sequences of all release factor genes were extracted from completed genomes using ARFA program [22], and an alignment of the corresponding proteins was built using the ClustalW program [23]. The alignment was also backtranslated to produce the corresponding nucleotide sequences [see Additional file 1] (note that one nucleotide in RF2 genes whose expression utilizes ribosomal frameshifting, was removed to make backtranslation possible). To reconstruct phylogenetic trees we used neighbor-joining method and the minimal evolution method implemented in the MEGA3 program [36]. The topologies of trees obtained vary in terms of the location of a node corresponding to RFH origin and depends on the evolution models used and the manner of treating alignment gaps. Both the bootstrap and the interior branch tests indicated a very low level of confidence for the corresponding branches. Therefore, our phylogenetic analysis related to the origin of RFH is inconclusive. However, in the majority of the phylogenetic reconstructions, the node corresponding to RFH divergence is either more close to branches corresponding to RF2 genes or is located within the RF2 sub-tree, suggesting that RFH is evolutionarily closer related to RF2 than to RF1. A consensus tree obtained by the neighbor-joining method and Dayhoff matrix as a substitution model, is illustrated in Figure 3A. Detailed information on a tree shown in Figure 3A can be found in the additional file that can be viewed with MEGA [see Additional file 2].

It is hard to estimate the contribution of horizontal gene transfer to the evolution of RFH. Fig. 3B shows the distribution of RFH genes in the bacterial phylogenetic tree (based on sequences of small ribosomal subunit rDNAs) obtained from the Ribosomal Database Project 2 [37]. Branches corresponding to bacteria where RFH genes were found are indicated by red circles. Note, that the absence of red circles does not indicate the absence of RFH genes in the corresponding bacteria, since the complete genome sequences of many bacteria represented on this tree are not available. It is clear that RFH occurs in distantly related bacteria. It is possible that horizontal gene transfer contributed to the expansion of RFH across lineages, since most of the bacteria where we found RFH genes are either animal or plant pathogens and therefore can share a common habitat in human guts. In addition, we found one RFH member in marine bacteria and we found a number of RFH encoding sequences (data not shown) in environmental samples obtained from the Sargasso Sea [38]. Again, this does not preclude a possibility of horizontal gene transfer, given human preferences for the sources of nutritional supplements and waste management.

We also believe that a more extensive analysis of RFH origin is necessary to obtain the most likely evolutionary scenario of RFH, but it is outside the scope of the current study. Reconstruction of true phylogeny for release factors is a complex problem, since it is likely that homologous recombination between paralogs has contributed to the evolution of corresponding RF genes due to the high level of their sequence similarity at certain conserved sites. A likely example of such homologous recombination can be seen in the alignment in Fig. 1A for the insertion common to both RF1 and RF2 sequences from Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron.

The essential step towards testing our hypothesis is the reconstitution of an active RFH (if none of the present prfH genes encodes an active variant). There is a high degree of conservation of particular features in RFH, which suggests that an active form can be restored. Yet, in E. coli K12 and many other bacteria, the RFH gene is present as a pseudogene. Disruptions in the corresponding ORFs are illustrated in Fig. 2A. It is also possible that some genes contain inactivating sense mutations. It is particularly hard to reconstitute an active form of the protein and assay its activity when its function is not fully understood. It is unclear what kinds of signals are recognized by RFH. Thus, the first step needs to be the identification of the mRNA signal that it recognizes. In this regard, the present knowledge of the medium resolution in situ cryo-EM and crystal structures [9,16-18] and high resolution isolated crystal structures, of RF1 and RF2 [7,8] are very helpful. We suggest that residues in the anticodon loop and in the tip of the alpha 5 helix in RF1 and RF2 should be substituted with those from RFH, or perhaps more significant swapping of larger parts of domains should be pursued, and then selectivity towards mRNA should be assayed in the absence and in the presence of the co-conserved upstream gene product. For example, a change of G (in RF1 and RF2) in position 138 (boxed in Fig 1A) to P (in RFH) should not change the selectivity of the RFs towards positions 2 and three of the stop codon, but may change the selectivity towards the first position. A set of such experiments with partial and complete swaps of residues in RFs interacting with mRNA may reveal an alternative signal recognized by RFH. Mora et al [13] changed specificity between RF1 and RF2 by swapping 16 residues in the mRNA recognition domain using such a strategy. Despite the seeming simplicity of such experiments, the elucidation of RFH signal may not be straightforward. Possibly the design of a chimeric RF, like the one used in the Ito et al study [12] would be needed. After a potential RFH signal is found, it will become possible to test naturally encoded RFH for activity as class-I RFs, and subsequently screen for a function of the co-conserved upstream gene.

The evolution of known well established class-I RFs itself holds several unsolved puzzles. Since there is no strong evidence for an evolutionary relationship between bacterial class-I RFs and their counterparts from archaea and eukaryotes, it is unknown how termination was mediated in the last common ancestor. If there was an RNA-based factor similar to tRNAs, was it independently substituted with convergently evolved protein analogs after the kingdoms of life split? It is unknown why there are two class-I RFs in bacteria, while for most organisms from the other kingdoms one factor serves the purpose well. Even among bacteria themselves, there is a small group of Mycoplasma and Ureplasma species which have lost their RF2 genes (UGA was reassigned to encode Trp). These bacteria rely on a sole RF1 for recognition of their remaining stop codons. Yet these are obligatory pathogens with highly reduced genomes, and no free-living bacterium is known to lack either RF1 or RF2. Presumably, strong selective pressure preserves two class-I RFs in bacteria, although the benefits of having two factors with overlapping specificity are not apparent.
###end p 36
###begin p 37
The hypothesis presented here of a third class-I RF does not simplify the situation. On the contrary, it makes it seem even more complicated. Nevertheless, even though experimental investigation of RFH may not give simple answers to above questions, it will help to recreate a more accurate picture of RF evolution. The most provocative aspect of the RFH story is the lack of an apparent need for yet another class-I RF. It is unclear what kind of signals RFH might recognize in mRNA.

Specific and conserved alterations (compared to RF1 and RF2) in those parts of RFH that interact with mRNA suggest that RFH recognizes something different from normal stop codons. Several speculative suggestions can be made regarding what might be a potential RFH signal. We will mention a few of them. If RFH recognizes a combination of standard nucleotides in mRNA other than stop codons (specifically or non-specifically), it will compete with tRNAs. This will result in ambiguous translation of sense codons as stop codons. Under normal conditions, such ambiguous translation is unlikely to be beneficial. However, during starvation for certain amino acids, premature termination on their corresponding codons will release stalled ribosomes. Hence, such a situation might be beneficial if RFH is expressed under starvation conditions for one or more amino acids. This would be useful in dealing with the ribosomes whose A-site is unoccupied in contrast to the RelA mediated stringent response triggered by stalled ribosomes occupied with deacylated tRNAs [39]. Since equilibrium between such ribosomal states is likely, RFH may act with RelA in parallel. If correct the function of RFH would partially overlap with that of tmRNA, but it would not have the tmRNA feature of ensuring the addition of a C-terminal tag, which is the substrate for a specific protease that rapidly degrades the product.
###end p 38
###begin p 39
The co-occurrence of RFH and the upstream gene, may also represent a toxin/antidote balance. Unwanted premature termination (performed by RFH) would be toxic, and should be closely controlled by another protein, here suggested to be the upstream gene product.
###end p 39
###begin p 40
Another potential role for RFH could be in recognition of mRNA containing nucleotides that are modified because of damage or for other reasons. The list of potential signals could be continued. Whatever the RFH function is, RFH is dispensable in most modern bacteria, meaning that either its function is also dispensable or it is accomplished by a different parallel system.

We know other examples of organisms with additional RFs. In A. thaliana, there are three highly similar isogenic eRF1s [40]. In some ciliates, e. g. Euplotes and in certain methanogenic archaea, there are two class-I RFs instead of only one [41,42]. Interestingly, in the genetic codes of ciliates and methanogenic archaea, stop codons have been reassigned to sense codons. In many Euplotes UGA is reassigned to tryptothan [41], while in methagenic archaea UAG is translated as pyrrolysine [43]. The corresponding RF1s in these species have multiple substitutions in the area of the NIKS motif that is responsible for stop codon discrimination [42]. Whether the emergence of RFH was a result of a similar codon reassignment event is another interesting question to be answered.

Authors' note: The original version of the manuscript (prior to the revision) referred to the product of prfH as to RF0. In the revised version we substituted RF0 with RFH as two referees suggested. Nevertheless, some of reviewers' reports use the term RF0 and we have left it as is for clarity. We would like to advice readers that both terms, RF0 and RFH, refer to the same protein product.

The manuscript of Baranov et al. hypothesizes that in addition to the usual two class-I release factors RF1 and RF2, there are some bacteria that contain a third class-I release factor, termed here RF0. The manuscript expands on the observation of Pel and coworkers that the E. coli strain K12 had a gene that exhibited high similarity to the canonical release factors RF1 and RF2 and therefore termed the protein factor RF-H (release factor homologue) and the gene prfH. In light of the many fully and partially sequenced bacterial genomes, Baranov et al. reveal that the prfH gene is found in only 10% and that the bacteria are phylogenetically distinct and from different environments. In many cases the prfH gene is not intact, containing deletions or truncations, suggesting it is a pseudogene, at least in these organisms. Interestingly, an ORF directly 5' to the prfH gene is found to be conserved in all cases, whereas an ORF with similar conservation is not found in prfH lacking organisms, and the stop codon of the upstream ORF overlaps with the start codon of prfH suggesting translational coupling. The expected protein product from the prfH gene, if expressed, would be a minimal RF in that it lacked domain I. The conservation of the GGQ motif suggests that this factor would be able to hydrolyze the polypeptide from the tRNA, whereas slight deviations from RF1 and RF2 in the regions approaching the mRNA codon, leading to the suggestion that specificity of the RF0 would be distinct from the canonical termination factors.

Clearly, the fact that in some cases the prfH is a pseudogene suggests that it is not an essential factor (at least in these organisms), however the appearance of this gene in unrelated bacteria, the possibility of translational coupling with a mysterious upstream gene and the altered but conserved codon recognition elements, combine to produce an intriguing situation that warrants further investigation. Publication of this hypothesis in Biology Direct should bring this mystery to the attention of the relevant researchers capable of pursing this problem.

1. In the Background section, the E. coli K12 prfH gene is referred to as a pseudogene. This may well be the case, especially considering that compared to the intact prfH genes it has a rather large deletion. But to my knowledge the expression from this gene has not been checked and it may not require the upstream gene. Therefore "likely or probably pseudogene" may be a more cautious term? Furthermore, the way this paragraph is currently written, it implies that Pel et al. 1992 have termed it a pseudogene but Pel et al. actually suggest that RF-H may be expressed and identify a 141 codon ORF starting with AUG and ending with UAA. However, this said, it should be pointed out that in support of the pseudogene idea is the peculiarities of this strain. Namely, that it has been suggested to have undergone heavy mutagensis, which was used as a possible explanation why RF2 in K12 strains contain Thr246 (making it inactive upon overexpression), instead of canonical Ala like other E. coli strains (see Dincbas-Renqvist et al., (2000) EMBO J and references therein).

8. 'Implications of the hypothesis' section, para 3. One scenario that the authors raise for the function of RF0 is releasing of stalled ribosomes during conditions of amino acid starvation. Although not mutually exclusive, it should be recognized that under such conditions the uncharged tRNA binds at the A site and would prevent RF0 binding. It is the binding of the deacylated tRNA that triggers the RelA-mediated ppGpp synthesis that characterizes the stringent response (see Wendrich et al (2002) Mol Cell and references therein).

If prfH plays a role during starvation, its role will be relevant to RelA-mediated stringent response. However, prfH function is not necessarily similar to the one of RelA. RelA is responsible for global changes in the gene expression at the transcriptional level and it binds to ribosomes whose A-site is occupied by deacylated tRNAs. The prfH product would be responsible only for the release of the stalled ribosomes whose A-sites are empty. These two activities would be needed for the different purposes (ribosome rescue vs. stringent response) and may occur at different conditions. To our knowledge, it is not known precisely what proportion of the stalled ribosomes is occupied with deacylated tRNAs compared to stalled ribosomes with empty A-sites. Likely, there is an equilibrium between these two states, since deacylated tRNAs are bound to the ribosome reversibly.

9. The appearance of the prfH gene in unrelated bacteria is not thoroughly discussed in evolutionary terms i.e. horizontal transfer versus gene loss etc. The "anticodon" motif of RFH (SXY) is similar to RF2 (SP(F/Y)). Can it be said if RF0 is more closely related to RF2 than RF1? i.e. did it arise from duplication of the RF1 gene or are they equally related such that RF0 may be progenitor to both RF1 and RF2 genes and simply has been lost in some organisms.

10. Lastly, I am not sure that RF-H warrants renaming just yet. I think if it is demonstrated to have release factor activity, then RF0 may be an appropriate name, depending on what its function turns out to be. However, at the moment I think RF-H, release factor homologue, is perhaps a more careful description.

The manuscript by Baranov et al. proposes a provocative, though yet unidentified, function of a novel member, referred to as RF0, of class-I release factor in bacteria. The RF0 sequence was first reported some fifteen years ago by Pell and colleagues in E. coli K12 genome as a pseudogene that shares significant sequence conservation with two functional release factors RF1 and RF2. Since then, regardless of having attracted strong interest in this field, no significant progress has been made. To my knowledge, this is the first most comprehensive characterization of RF0 based on the available sequence database coupled with the 3D structural modeling. Based on the highly conservative nature of RF0, they propose that RF0 should possess, or should have possessed, the decoding function in translation. This prediction immediately generates several interesting questions. Why RF0 is pseudogene and silent? Does it potentially recognize a specific codon or not? Is there any circumstance to activate or express RF0? etc. etc. The authors elaborate their prediction and working hypothesis in a theoretical way. I found this manuscript is quite interesting and deserves publication in Biology Direct. I trust that the following comments might be useful to revise the paper.

2. The putative RFH anticodon "SXY" seems to be a SPF (RF2) type. Nevertheless, "Y" has never been appeared in our previous extensive selection (Nakamura and Ito, FEBS Letter 514: 30-33, 2002). Hence, I feel it may not be a RF2 or omnipotent type - something different. This might be useful to your argument.

3. Although the above possibility of RF0 reading some sense codon(s) is fascinating, they might take another possibility into consideration as well. That is, loss of specificity of reading. It is known that charge-flip variant RF2 proteins, altered at conserved Glu residues adjacent to the SPF motif, trigger polypeptide release at non-cognate stop, and even sense, codons (Ito et al., 1998; Uno et al., 2002). These Glu residues are exposed on one side of the surface of domain 2/4 of RF2, suggesting that electrostatic interactions between a class 1 RF and the ribosome are important for the accurate docking in the ribosome (Nakamura and Ito, 2003). Therefore, given some circumstance allows to express RF0 in urgent conditions, it is likely that RF0 functions to stop translation at any codons. It is interesting to speculate this as a novel rescue system.

4. Finally, I am not so confident that simple transplantation of RF0 anticodon "SXY" into the RF2 sequence does work. Rather, as shown in our paper (Ito et al. Nature 2000), a chimeric RF1/RF2 construct might be useful for the anticodon swap experiment.

Summary: This manuscript highlights an interesting and intriguing question about the role of a prokaryotic release factor (RF) orthologue (RFH) that has the key tripeptide motifs for codon recognition, and for peptide release but lacks domain 1 of the classical class-I RFs and has no known function. This means it has the potential to recognize signals in mRNA and contact the peptidyl transferase centre of the ribosome but may form a different kind of interaction with the ribosome. The potential function of these proteins is intriguing: on the one hand, the gene appears to be non functional in some species by appearing as a pseudo gene, whereas it appears to be complete in others. The fact that it sits beside remnants of an ancestral gene cluster encoding a novel flagellar system in E. coli K12 (Ren et al., J Bacteriol 2005) is intriguing since it invokes the thought RFH could have been associated with a specific case of termination in the past (rather like SELB vs EFTu in elongation). It is also intriguing that the initiation factor, IF1, family has the decoding domain of the RFs and the tripeptide motif of RFH is more similar to this although IF1s lack a GGQ. These proteins have the OB fold (IF1) (or partial OB fold in the case of the RFs), and presumably RFH has it also.

The manuscript provides some provocative ideas as to what RFH might be doing and some suggestions for experiments to test whether it recognizes a different stop signal, perhaps differing the first base. This are readily assessable although our ideas of recognition might still be too simplistic, despite the compelling modeling of the X ray derived densities of the decoding RFs loops in a termination complex at the decoding site (Petry et al.,Cell 2005). GG (or GP) motifs in both RF domains indicate sharp turns in the structure marking the extremities of the loops that may relate to the functions but may not be an integral part of them-this is still to be determined but is an important question to resolve.

My own view of the proposed name RF0 is that locking the nomenclature of this group of genes too closely to the existing families of RFs (RF1 and RF2) at this stage might be premature when we do not know whether they function to recognise stop signals or have a release function in termination. Hence, I would prefer a name like RF-like, or even oRF (orthologue of RF) that can be later modified if a closer association with classic RFs emerges with functional data. Nevertheless, the hypotheses are stimulating for those of us involved in experimental testing of the importance of residues and motifs in the RF families. This is a very worthy contribution to the discussion and intellectual argument about this group of interesting proteins.

The retention of the two tripeptide motifs that specify codon recognition, and peptide release (the only motif conserved through all RFs) in RFH is compelling although the consequences of the lack of domain 1 are still not totally clear for ribosome function. Domain 1 seems more important for RF2 function than for RF1 (independent of RF3). (This is interesting given that on L11 lacking ribosomes (domain 1 interaction site) RF1 is totally inactive whereas RF2 has several fold higher activity - Tate et al.,J Biol Chem 1984). Domain 1 is called inessential in the manuscript (Background, second paragraph, last line); perhaps the Mora reference could be given with this statement because they were able to show this specifically with in vitro assays. This is consistent with our original proposal of the tRNA analogue hypothesis of two essential but conformationally coupled domains, one for codon recognition, and one for release (Moffat and Tate, J Biol Chem 1994).

5. The discussion of the implications for the evolution of a protein decoding mechanism for stop codons is particularly interesting. If this were originally non-specific or RNA mediated then an existing protein might have been captured for this purpose. Did a protein like RFH carry out a specific function (accelerated release of a protein from the ribosome?) that was generalised with the development of the RF1 and RF2 families and the acquisition of domain 1 and RF3 functions? As asked by the authors, why have three families of decoding factors, or even the well documented two families. Relevant to this is that the RF2 family has the conserved frameshifting mechanism associated with its expression whereas the RF1 family does not. There are a number of unresolved questions.

7. The lack of a domain 1 is interesting - does that suggest it has a more transitory association with the ribosome as well as the lack of an RF3 interaction site, or perhaps a blocking role like IF1 in the A site during initiation? If there are two binding states (as we believe) the first dependent upon domain 1 and then, on correct codon recognition a second state perhaps involving correct positioning of the GGQ (completing unfolding of domain III)-then can RFH go into the second state without a docking at L7/L12/L11. There are the reports now suggesting the RFs can function without their domain 1 (RF-1 in particular in vitro and both in vivo but with slow growth). These are intriguing question thrown up by the ideas expressed in this manuscript.

This paper presents a simple and straightforward hypothesis regarding the function of the bacterial PrfH proteins, a homolog of class 1 release factors. It is proposed that PrfH is RF0, a novel release factor with a distinct specificity. Of course, it is hard to disagree with this prediction - given the high level of similarity between PrfH and experimentally characterized release factors. I may note that, in the COG database that is used in this paper, and in other databases, PrfH proteins are annotated as putative release factors, so realistically, the novelty of the hypothesis is not so dramatic. Of course, a detailed discussion of potential functions of these uncharacterized proteins is useful. Herein, however, lie some problems with the current version. Again, given the rather obvious nature of the main idea, the value of the paper is expected to be in detailed analysis, and this seems to be somewhat underdeveloped. Specifically, I see three rather substantial issues:
###end p 124

1. Unfortunately, the manuscript includes no prediction of the signal recognized by RFH. This is understandable as there is, apparently, not enough data for making such a prediction. This being the case, however, I feel that the title of the paper is somewhat misleading because "...atypical mRNA signals, other than normal stop codons" seems to imply a specific prediction (the discussion of some possibilities at the end of the paper is really vague). For that matter, I am not convinced that this aspect of the hypothesis holds once the experiments are done: it is quite a possibility that RF0 does recognize one or more of the standard stop codons but under some specific conditions.

2. A phylogenetic tree for Class 1 release factors is presented but potential evolutionary scenarios for RF0 are not discussed. Why is this gene found in only ~10% of the sequenced bacterial genomes? Is it a result of a relatively recent duplication? What was the contribution of horizontal gene transfer to the evolution of this gene and what was the role of lineage-specific gene loss (the importance of the latter is implied by the fact that many bacteria seems to have prfH pseudogenes)? I believe all of this deserves explicit and reasonably detailed discussion. Further, it is strange that the tree is mentioned (not really discussed) in the beginning of the section on possible tests of the hypothesis. Does it have anything to do with those tests?

3. I am surprised that the authors do not make a bigger deal of (and, essentially, draw no conclusions from) the juxtaposition of the prfH gene with rtcB and their (reasonably) proposed translational coupling. It is true that the function of RtcB has not been characterized experimentally but it is not an utter mystery. Indeed, the adjacency of the rtcB gene to RNA cyclase in a great number of genomes strongly suggest that RtcB is an enzyme of tRNA and/or rRNA processing as briefly discussed in Koonin et al. Genome Biol. 2004;5(2):R7 (see Table 1 in that paper). The probable coexpression of prfH with these genes is quite intriguing and might hold the key to the actual function of RF0. I am sure this is worth some serious discussion in this paper.

We agree that indeed the upstream genes that belong to the family of RtcB-like proteins may hold the secret of RFH function. It deserves more attention and we describe it in more detail in the revised version of the manuscript and provide certain additional speculations regarding this gene and its relation to potential function in RNA processing/modification.

ClustalW alignment of RF codon sequences in the nexus format. The names of the sequences are given in the following format: RF2_MC_003919.fna - where RF2 - is the name of the factor (either RF1, RF2 or RFH), MC_003919 indicates an accession number (substitute M with N to get an accession number), it also indicates a name of a fasta file from NCBI ftp site which was used in this study, e.g. NC_003919.fna. Note that sequences corresponding to RF2 genes expressed via ribosomal frameshift were modified by deletion of one nucleotide in the frameshift site to correct for ORF disruption.

Saved MEGA3 tree session corresponding to a tree shown in Fig. 3. Names are the same as in the Additional file 1. However, the number of sequences is different, since the trees were reconstructed based on corresponding amino acid alignment and only one member from a group of redundant protein sequences was used for phylogenetic reconstruction.
