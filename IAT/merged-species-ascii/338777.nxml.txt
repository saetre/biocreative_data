We have used random oligonucleotide mutagenesis (or saturation mutagenesis) to create a library of point mutations in the alpha 1 protein domain of a Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) molecule. This protein domain is critical for T cell and B cell recognition. We altered the MHC class I H-2DP gene sequence such that synthetic mutant alpha 1 exons (270 bp of coding sequence), which contain mutations identified by sequence analysis, can replace the wild type alpha 1 exon. The synthetic exons were constructed from twelve overlapping oligonucleotides which contained an average of 1.3 random point mutations per intact exon. DNA sequence analysis of mutant alpha 1 exons has shown a point mutant distribution that fits a Poisson distribution, and thus emphasizes the utility of this mutagenesis technique to "scan" a large protein sequence for important mutations. We report our use of saturation mutagenesis to scan an entire exon of the H-2DP gene, a cassette strategy to replace the wild type alpha 1 exon with individual mutant alpha 1 exons, and analysis of mutant molecules expressed on the surface of transfected mouse L cells.
