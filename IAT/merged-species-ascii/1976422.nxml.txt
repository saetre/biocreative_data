Interferons are a group of proteins that trigger multiple responses including prevention of viral replication, inhibition of cell growth, and modulation of cell differentiation. In different mammary carcinoma cell lines IFNgamma induces growth arrest at mid-G1. At the present there are no in vivo studies in human breast. The aim of this study was to investigate the expression patterns of IFNgamma and its two receptors (IFNgamma-Ralpha and IFNgamma-Rbeta) by Western blot and immunohistochemistry, in order to elucidate its role in the different types of human breast cancer (in situ and infiltrative).

Immunohistochemical and semiquantitative study of IFNgamma, its receptors types (IFNgamma-Ralpha and IFNgamma-Rbeta), cell proliferation (proliferating cell nuclear antigen, also named PCNA), and apoptosis (TUNEL method) was carried between the three breast groups (fibrocystic lesions, in situ tumors and infiltrating tumors).

In the three groups of patients, IFNgamma and IFNgamma-Ralpha immunoreactions appeared in the cytoplasm while IFNgamma-Rbeta also was found in the nucleus. The optical density to IFNgamma was higher in in situ carcinoma than in benign and infiltrating tumors. When we observed IFNgamma-Ralpha, the optical density was lower in infiltrating carcinoma than in benign and in situ tumors (the higher density). To IFNgamma-Rbeta, the optical density was similar in the three group samples. In tumor samples PCNA and TUNEL index was significantly higher; than in benign diseases. PCNA index increased with the malignance. No significant differences were found between cancer types to TUNEL. IFNgamma could be a potential therapeutic tool in breast cancer. However, tumor cells are able to escape from the control of this cytokine in the early tumor stages; this is probably due to a decreased expression of IFNgamma, or also to an alteration of either its receptors or some transduction elements.

Conclusion
###end title 8
###begin p 9
We conclude that the decrease in the % positive samples that expressed IFNgamma and IFNgamma-Ralpha together with the nuclear localization of IFNgamma-Rbeta, could be a tumoral cell response, although perhaps insufficient to inhibit the uncontrolled cell proliferation. Perhaps, IFNgamma might be unable to activate p21 to stop the cell cycle, suggesting a possible participation in breast cancer development.

Interferons belong to a protein family involved in viral replication prevention, cell growth inhibition and cell differentiation modulation [1]. IFNgamma was described as a 17 kDa peptide that is secreted by antigen activated lymphocytes and natural killer cells. Also, it has been reported that IFNgamma has antiviral activity, inhibits cell growth and modulates cell differentiation [2]. IFNgamma acts throughout a specific membrane receptor, which is composed by two different subunits: IFNgamma-Ralpha and IFNgamma-Rbeta [3]. IFNgamma-Ralpha is sufficient for ligand binding but it is necessary the presence of Rbeta to begin the IFNgamma signal transduction [4]. IFNgamma receptor complex has been described in a number of different tissues as endothelial cells, fibroblasts, neuronal cells, melanocytes and prostate cells [5,6].

In addition to its role in immune cells, IFNgamma inhibits the growth of a number of nonhematopoietic cell types, including several tumor types. In fact, it has been considered as an antitumor agent [7-9].

The IFNgamma ability to inhibit the growth of several tumor cell lines, including breast cancer cells, has been demonstrated in different studies [10-12]. This effect requires the signal transduction through the IFNgamma receptor, so the tumor proliferation rate was higher in animal cells that expressed lower number of functional receptors [13,14].

In breast cancer patients with skin metastasis, local injection of IFNgamma results in the total or partial regression of the skin lesions [15]. Other authors have been showed that IFNgamma increases the growth inhibitory effect of tamoxifen in breast metastatic carcinomas [16,17]. In this way, it has been show that IFNgamma produce this antitumoral effect up-regulating the expression of p21 and resulting cell cycle arrest in breast cancer cell lines [18].

At present and in our knowledge, there are no studies of IFNgamma and its receptors expression reported by immunohistochemistry and western blot, in different non malignant and carcinomatous human breast tissue. The aim of this study was to elucidate the expression patterns of IFNgamma and its receptors in human benign breast lesions and in in situ and infiltrating breast cancers, and to relate to the proliferation and apoptosis levels found in this tissues.

Total or partial mastectomy specimens obtained from 52 women, who were clinically and histopathologically diagnosed of breast adenocarcinoma during 1998 in our hospital, were used for the study. Seventeen of these women (aged from 37 to 75 years; mean: 52.8) presented in situ carcinoma; one of these 17 women also showed lymph node infiltration at the time of surgery. Thirty-five women (aged from 40 to 82 years; mean: 59.94) had infiltrating carcinoma; 13 of these 35 women showed lymph node infiltration at the time of surgery, and 7 of these 13 developed metastasis 7-24 months after surgery. At present (January 2005), neither the remaining 22 women with infiltrating tumors nor the 17 women with in situ tumors have developed metastasis.

Each sample was divided into two portions: one that was immediately processed for immunohistochemistry and the other were frozen in liquid nitrogen and maintained at -80degreesC for Western blot analysis. Removal of tissues was made by a Gynaecological Specialist MD and the samples were diagnosed by a Pathological Specialist MD (Ruiz A.). All pathological, clinical or personal data were anonymized and separated from any personal identifiers. This study was made with the consent of the written patients' relatives or their family in autopsy cases. All the procedures followed were examined and approved by the Principe de Asturias Hospital Ethics Committee and were in accordance with the ethical standards of the responsible committee on human experimentation, with the Helsinki Declaration of 1975 (revised in 1983) and the Committee on Publication Ethics (COPE) guidelines.

For Western blot analysis, tissues were homogenized in the extraction buffer (0.005 M Tris-HCl, pH 8) with addition of a cocktail of protease inhibitors (10 mM iodoacetamide, 100 mM phenylmethyl sulphonic fluoride, 0.01 mg/ml of soybean trypsin inhibitor and 1 mul/ml of leupeptin) and phosphates inhibitors (10 mM sodium fluoride and 1 mM sodium orthovanadate) in the presence of 0.5% Triton X-100. Homogenates were centrifugated for 10 min at 10,000 rpm. The protein concentration of supernatants was calculated by the Bradford method. Then, supernatants were equilibrated with loading buffer (10% SDS in Tris/HCl pH 8 containing 50% glycerol, 0.1 mM 2-beta-mercaptoethanol and 0.1% bromophenol blue) at 50 mug/ml. The mixture was denatured for 5 min at 100degreesC, and aliquots of 10 mul of homogenate were separated in SDS-polyacrylamide slab minigels (15% gels).

Separated proteins were transferred in the transfer buffer (25 mM Tris-HCl, 192 mM glycine, 0.1% SDS and 20% methanol). Nitrocellulose membranes (0.2 mum), were blocked for 1 h with 1% donkey serum in TBS, and incubated overnight at room temperature with the primary antibodies at 1:150 (IFNgamma and IFNgamma-Rbeta), 1:500 (IFNgamma-Ralpha) or 1:10000 (alpha-actin) in TBS with 5% bovine serum albumine (BSA). After extensive washing with TBS/Tween-20 (TBST), the membranes were incubated with donkey anti-goat (IFNgamma) and swin anti-rabbit (IFNgamma-Ralpha and IFNgamma-Rbeta) or rabbit anti-mouse (alpha-actin) biotinylated immunoglobulins (Dako, Barcelona, Spain) for 1 h at 1:2500 dilution in TBS with 5% BSA; and then washed and incubated with the avidin-biotin-peroxidase complex (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) at 1:1000 dilution. Furthermore, mouse anti-chicken alpha-actin (Amersham, Madrid, Spain) was also used at the same dilution to examine the relative expression of the other proteins. After an intensive wash, the filters were developed with an enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) kit, following the procedure described by the manufacturer (Amersham, Buckinghamshire, UK).

For ELISA procedure, the protein concentration of homogenates was calculated by the Bradford method. The different antigens were coated on 96 well multiplates overnight at 4degreesC. The plates were washed with TBS containing 0.05% Tween 20 and blocked with 1% BSA in TBS for 1 h at room temperature, and incubated with the different antibodies (anti-IFN-gamma, IFNgamma-Ralpha, IFNgamma-Rbeta) for 3 h also at room temperature. After a new wash, the biotin-conjugated anti-rabbit or anti-goat immunoglobulins (Dako) were added to each well, incubated for 1 h at room temperature, and then washed and incubated with the avidin-biotin-peroxidase complex (Vector). The interactions were visualized with 0.05% 2,2 azino di-3-etilbenziatioazolina sulphonic acid (ABTS) (Sigma) in 100 mM citrate buffer, and were measured (optical density at 405 nm) in a spectrophotometer (Multiskan Bichromatic, Labsystems, Finland).

Tissues were fixed for 24 h at room temperature in 0.1 M phosphate-buffered 10% formaldehyde, dehydrated and embedded in paraffin. Sections (5-mum thick) were processed following the avidin-biotin-peroxidase complex (ABC) method. Following deparaffinization, sections were hydrated, incubated for 30 min in 0.3% H2O2 diluted in methanol to reduce endogenous activity. To retrieve the antigen, the sections were incubated with 0.1 M citrate buffer (pH 6) for 2 min in a conventional pressure cooker. After rinsing in TBS buffer, the slides were incubated with normal donkey serum at 10% in TBS for 30 min to prevent non-specific binding of the first antibody. Thereafter, the primary antibodies were applied at a dilution of 1:25 (IFNgamma and IFNgamma-Rbeta), 1:125 (IFNgamma-Ralpha) or 1:500 (PCNA) in TBS at 37degreesC overnight. Afterwards, the sections were washed twice in TBS and then incubated with donkey anti-goat (IFNgamma), mouse anti-rabbit (IFNgamma-Ralpha and IFNgamma-Rbeta) or rabbit anti-mouse (PCNA) biotinylated immunoglobulins (Dako, Barcelona, Spain) at 1:500 in TBS. After 1 h of incubation with secondary antibody, the sections were incubated with a standard streptavidin-biotin-complex (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA, USA) and developed with 3,3'-diaminobenzidine (DAB), using the glucose oxidase-DAB-nickel intensification method.

Co-localization studies for IFNgamma-IFNRalpha or IFNgamma-IFNRbeta was carried out in the same sections of each group. The procedure was similar than in simple immunostaining, but sections were first labelled with goat anti-human IFNgamma and rabbit anti-human IFNgamma-Ralpha or IFNgamma-Rbeta (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). In a second step sections were incubated for 1 h with donkey anti-goat (IFNgamma) and mouse anti-rabbit (IFNgamma-Ralpha and IFNgamma-Rbeta) biotilinated immunoglobulins (DAKO). In a third step, IFNgamma was revealed using the glucose oxidase-DAB-nickel intensification method; and IFNgamma-Ralpha or IFNgamma-Rbeta was revealed using the AP-red substrate (Zymed) After this, sections were mounted in Aquatex (Merck & Co., Inc, Whitethouse Station, NJ, USA)

A comparative histologic quantification of immunolabeling among the different groups of breast samples (in situ adenocarcinomas, infiltrating adenocarcinomas and benign lesions) was performed for each of the four antibodies. Of each sample (breast), six histologic sections were selected at random. In each section, the staining intensity (optic density) per unit surface area was measured with an automatic image analyzer (Motic Images Advanced version 3.2, Motic China Group Co., China) in 5 light microscopic fields per section, using the x20 objective. For each positively immunostained section, one negative control section (the following in a series of consecutive sections) was also used, and the optic density of this control section was taken away from that of the stained section. Data are given as optic density per unit surface area (1 mum).

From the average values obtained for each breast, the means +/- SD for each breast group were calculated. The number of sections examined was determined by successive approaches to obtain the minimum number required to reach the lowest SD. The statistical significance between means of the different breast group samples was assessed by the Fisher exact or chi2 test at p </= 0.05, by multiple pairwise comparisons of all the values for each breast zone, for each specific antibody separately.

For each antibody used, a single band - at their corresponding molecular weight - was found: IFNgamma (17 kDa), IFNgamma-Ralpha (80 kDa) and IFNgamma-Rbeta (70 kDa). The immunoreaction appeared in the three lesion groups (Fig. 1). Comparison of optical density band's revealed significant differences (p </= 0.05) between three breast groups: the highest optical density was found in in situ carcinomas (IFNgamma and IFNgamma-Ralpha); no significant differences were found to IFNgamma-Rbeta between the three sample groups (Table 1).

Comparison of immunostaining intensities (measured as average optical density +/- SD) in Western blot analysis of bening breast lesions, in situ and infiltrating breast cancer. The labeled cells are classified in three groups according to their intensity range: low (< 10), intermediate (between 10 and 15) and high (>20). For each protein, values with different superscript letter differ significantly (P </= 0.05) between them. Those values sharing the same superscript are not statistically different from each other. Statistical analysis refers to each antibody separately. The mean values and SD for each group have been calculated from all samples corresponding to the group.

Neoplasia occurs as a result of cellular changes that perturb normal balances between cell growth and cell death. These changes could be caused by an altered expression of several factors including IFNgamma. In the present study we have found moderate expression of IFNgamma (70.6% of cases) and IFNgamma-Ralpha (88.2% of cases) in most of benign lesions samples. However, beta subunit of this receptor appeared only in 41.2% of cases in this group, suggesting that there was a basal activity of IFNgamma in non-neoplasic tissues. The IFNgamma activity could be regulated by the expression of IFNgamma-Rbeta; therefore it is necessary to constitute the functional receptor to start the signal transduction [19]. Both IFNgamma and its receptor appeared in the epithelial cells only, indicating that this cytokine acts in autocrine manner in order to control cell proliferation. Other authors stated that, in breast epithelial cells, the anti-proliferative effects of IFNgamma occur by up-regulation of apoptotic members of the bcl-2 family [20]. In previous studies we reported low expression of bcl-2 in benign breast disorders [21]; this agrees with the low proliferation index and the high apoptotic index found in this group of cases. All these data are consistent with the proliferation/apoptosis equilibrium observed in non-malignant breast tissue.

In in situ carcinomas we found an increased expression of both IFNgamma and IFNgamma-Ralpha. However, the number of positive patients was lower than in benign diseases. There was no statistical difference in IFNgamma-Rbeta expression compared with benign diseases, but the location of this membrane receptor was in the nuclei of epithelial cells in most of in situ tumor cases (93.7%). These findings suggest a loss of IFNgamma activity in breast epithelium in in situ tumors. Contrarily with our results, other authors have reported nuclear accumulation of IFNgamma and IFNgamma-Ralpha in the WISH cell line [22]; and, we found nuclear location only for IFNgamma-Rbeta. Doherty et al. [23] have stated that the lack of endogenous IFNgamma at the tumor site, and also the inactivation of either the receptor components or the signal transduction pathway elements, could lead to a selective advantage for those mutated cells. In agreement with these statements, we have found a high proliferation index in the in situ tumor group. This could be caused by a lack of IFNgamma activity due to the unusual location of beta receptor subunit. This effect could mean the loss of the antitumoral effects of IFNgamma in early stages of human breast cancer. Although this is the first time that IFNgamma-Rbeta was found in the nucleus. So other proteins such as p53 or p21 changed his location in breast cancer, probably due to mutant forms of these proteins that present different functions, as occurs in the most of cancers, and it could be associated with the cancer development and progression [24,25].

In prostate cancer cells it has been reported that IFNgamma apoptotic effects are promoted by p21 stimulation, which inhibits G1 and S phase of cell cycle [26]. In breast cancer cell lines, IFNgamma treatment produces an increase in p21 [18]. Our results suggest that IFNgamma could be non-functional and unable to activate p21 to stop the cell cycle. In this sense, in a previous study, we detected p21 in the cytoplasm of epithelial cells in in situ carcinomas, and this suggests that the p21 cytoplasmic product does not reach to enter the nucleus, and therefore, it would not be functional and would not contribute to the cell cycle arrest [27]. Furthermore, this p21 location has been related to breast cancer resistance to the TNF-alpha apoptotic effect [28], and it could be explained by the IFNgamma effects mediated by TNFRI [29]. According with these data, in a previous study we described a high expression of TNFRI in in situ carcinomas of the breast [30]. Although IFNgamma effects mediated by TNFRI would be inhibited by the presence of p21 in the cell cytoplasm, the p21 location in in situ carcinomas would be capable to inhibit the apoptotic pathway of TNFRI at ASK-1 level [31], and thus, to prevent the IFNgamma function as cell cycle inhibitor.

The group of infiltrating adenocarcinomas showed a lower expression of IFNgamma than the in situ group, and a similar expression to that observed in the benign disease group. However, the number of positive cases was lower (40%) and similar to in situ carcinoma (35%). For IFNgamma-Ralpha, the intensity of reaction and the number of positive cases decreased. IFNgamma-Rbeta showed similar reaction intensity in the two carcinoma groups, and the immunoreaction appeared in the cell nuclei. These data suggest a loss of IFNgamma antitumoral activity in these tumors. IFNgamma, via IRF-5 (interferon regulatory factor-5), can stimulate the expression of apoptotic genes as bax [32]. Therefore, the decreased IFNgamma positive samples could result in an altered bax/bcl-2 balance. Ruiz-Ruiz and Lopez-Rivas [33] have suggested that, in breast cancer cell lines, IFNgamma favors activation of mitochondria-operated apoptotic pathway by TRAIL; this activation can be inhibited in bcl-2 overexpressing cells. We reported an overexpression of bcl-2 in a previous study [21] in all these tumors and in the same patients used in this study; this overexpression could lead to the inhibition of IFNgamma apoptotic effects, resulting in deregulation of the proliferation/apoptosis equilibrium towards proliferation. This effect could be the cause of the higher proliferation index found in these samples (up to 23% cells) respect to that observed in both benign diseases and in situ tumors. Therefore, present observations could suggest that IFNgamma could be a potential therapeutic tool in breast cancer. However, tumor cells are able to escape from the control of this cytokine in the early tumor stages; this could be due to a decreased expression of IFNgamma, or also to an alteration of either its receptors.

Conclusion
###end title 77
###begin p 78
We conclude that the decrease in the % positive samples that expressed IFNgamma and IFNgamma-Ralpha together with the nuclear localization of IFNgamma-Rbeta, could be a tumoral cell response, although possibly insufficient to inhibit the uncontrolled cell proliferation. IFNgamma might be unable to activate p21 to stop the cell cycle, suggesting a possible participation in breast cancer development.
