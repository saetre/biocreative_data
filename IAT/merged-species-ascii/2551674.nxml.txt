OBJECTIVE-The precise molecular mechanisms contributing to the development of insulin resistance, impaired glucose tolerance (IGT), and type 2 diabetes are largely unknown. Altered endogenous glucocorticoid metabolism, including 11beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1 (11beta-HSD1), which generates active cortisol from cortisone, and 5alpha-reductase (5alphaR), which inactivates cortisol, has been implicated.

RESULTS-A total of 22.7% of women had IGT compared with 34.2% of men. Two women and five men were diagnosed with type 2 diabetes. In women, adipose 11beta-HSD1 expression was increased in patients with IGT and correlated with glucose levels across the OGTT (R = 0.44, P < 0.001) but was independent of fat mass. Total glucocorticoid secretion was higher in men with and without IGT (normal 13,743 +/- 863 vs. 7,453 +/- 469 mug/24 h, P < 0.001; IGT 16,871 +/- 2,113 vs. 10,133 +/- 1,488 mug/24 h, P < 0.05), and in women, it was higher in those with IGT (7,453 +/- 469 vs. 10,133 +/- 1,488 mug/24 h, P < 0.001). In both sexes, 5alphaR activity correlated with fasting insulin (men R = 0.53, P = 0.003; women R = 0.33, P = 0.02), insulin secretion across an OGTT (men R = 0.46, P = 0.01; women R = 0.40, P = 0.004), and homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (men R = 0.52, P = 0.004; women R = 0.33, P = 0.02).

CONCLUSIONS-Increased adipose 11beta-HSD1 expression in women may contribute to glucose intolerance. Enhanced 5alphaR activity in both sexes is associated with insulin resistance but not body composition. Augmented glucocorticoid inactivation may serve as a compensatory, protective mechanism to preserve insulin sensitivity.

Despite the severe health consequences of obesity (1) and the alarming rate at which its prevalence is increasing (2), many questions remain unanswered with regard to its pathogenesis and etiology. Insulin resistance and obesity are tightly associated, yet the molecular mechanisms that underpin this relationship are unknown. Insulin resistance has been implicated as central not only to the development of obesity itself but also its complications, including dyslipidemia, thromboembolic disease, and hypertension (3). Furthermore, it is a feature of many other clinical conditions, including polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), where the degree of insulin resistance exceeds that observed in body composition-matched control subjects (4). The association between insulin resistance and obesity almost certainly explains the dramatic relationship between obesity and type 2 diabetes (5,6). Type 2 diabetes evolves from a state of insulin resistance with hyperinsulinema necessary to maintain glucose tolerance. Type 2 diabetes is manifest when insulin secretion fails to meet demands, with consequent hyperglycemia and eventual pancreatic beta-cell failure. Impaired glucose tolerance (IGT), defined as a 2-h glucose concentration >7.8 mmol/l but <11.1 mmol/l after 75-g oral glucose testing (OGTT), significantly increases the risk of progression to type 2 diabetes (7), and although rates of progression to type 2 diabetes are variable, they may exceed 10% per year (8,9). Although the benefits of lifestyle intervention are clear (9), the molecular mechanisms that cause IGT and, similarly, the mechanisms by which IGT progresses to type 2 diabetes are largely unknown.

The role of endogenous glucocorticoids in the development of obesity and insulin resistance has been widely speculated on based upon observation in patients with glucocorticoid excess (Cushing's syndrome). These patients develop a classical phenotype including central obesity, insulin resistance, and in some cases type 2 diabetes. However, simple obesity and insulin resistance are not caused by subclinical endogenous glucocorticoid excess; circulating cortisol levels in obese patients are not elevated (10). Tissue-specific glucocorticoid metabolism, however, may be important. The enzyme 11beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1 (11beta-HSD1) is highly expressed in liver, adipose tissue, and muscle and generates the active glucocorticoid cortisol from inactive cortisone and therefore amplifies local glucocorticoid action (11). However, 11beta-HSD1 is a bidirectional enzyme and is capable of inactivating cortisol to cortisone. Critically, the directionality of 11beta-HSD1 activity is cofactor (NADPH) dependent, which is supplied by a tightly associated endolumenal enzyme, hexose-6-phopshate dehydrogenase (H6PDH). Decreases in H6PDH expression and activity decrease oxoreductase and increase dehydrogenase activity (12,13). Recently, much attention has focused on pharmacological manipulation of cortisol metabolism as a therapeutic strategy. Selective 11beta-HSD1 inhibitors administered to rodents and primates decrease local glucocorticoid generation, improve glucose tolerance, increase insulin sensitivity, and may promote weight loss (14-17). In contrast to the action of 11beta-HSD1, the A-ring reductases (5alpha-reductase type 1 [5alphaR1] and type 2 [5alphaR2] and 5beta-reductase) inactivate cortisol, decreasing local glucocorticoid availability to bind and activate the glucocorticoid receptor (GR). 5alphaR1 is expressed in skin and adipose tissue (18,19) and 5alphaR2 in prostate, epididymis, and seminal vesicles; both isozymes are expressed in the liver (18).

Studies published to date have focused principally on the role of cortisol metabolism in the pathogenesis of obesity rather than that of insulin resistance. We have performed a detailed clinical study in a large cohort of obese patients exploring the concept that cortisol metabolism is an important regulator of insulin sensitivity and that this may be independent of fat mass. We have hypothesized that decreased local glucocorticoid availability (through decreased 11beta-HSD1 and/or increased A-ring reductase activity) will represent a novel physiological adaptive response to preserve insulin sensitivity in a cohort of patients predisposed to the development of insulin resistance, IGT, and type 2 diabetes.

The study was approved by the South Birmingham Local Research Ethics Committee, and all subjects gave informed, written consent. A total of 101 obese volunteers (35 male, 66 female, mean age +/- SD 48 +/- 7 years, mean BMI 34.4 +/- 4.3 kg/m2) were recruited following local advertisement and underwent the clinical protocol described below. Patients had no significant past medical history, and none had received glucocorticoid therapy (oral, topical, or inhaled) within the last 12 months. All patients had normal blood counts and renal function.

Subjects were investigated in the fasting state. Blood samples were drawn at 9 a.m. for measurement of total cholesterol, triglycerides, cortisol, cortisone, glucose, insulin, and A1C. Measurements of BMI, waist circumference (measured supine, at the level of the umbilicus), hip circumference (at the level of the greater trochanter), and blood pressure (average of three readings, measured supine after 10 min rest using Dynamap [Critikon, Tampa, FL]) were also taken. Patients underwent a standard 75-g oral glucose tolerance test, with samples taken at 30-min intervals for 120 min for measurement of insulin and glucose.

In the fasting state, all patients had an abdominal subcutaneous adipose tissue biopsy (10-15 cm lateral to the umbilicus) performed under local anesthetic (1-2 ml of 1% lidocaine) in order to obtain approximately250-500 mg of adipose tissue. The sample was immediately placed in RNALater (Ambion, Austin, TX) and, after initial storage for 24 h at room temperature, was stored at -20degreesC for subsequent total RNA extraction, reverse transcription, and real-time PCR analysis.

Body composition analysis was performed using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) with a total body scanner (QDR 45OO; Hologic, Bedford, MA). Coefficients of variation (CVs) for multiple scans were <3%. Regional fat mass (trunk and leg) was analyzed as previously described (21).

Blood counts, urea, creatinine and electrolytes, cholesterol, triglycerides, liver chemistry, glucose, and A1C were measured using standard laboratory methods (Roche Modular system; Roche, Lewes, U.K.). Insulin was measured using a commercially available colorimetric ELISA (Mercodia, Uppsala, Sweden) with an in-house CV of <5%. Cortisol was measured using a coat-a-count radioimmunoassay (Diagnostic Products, Los Angeles, CA) as per the manufacturer's guidelines. Cortisone was assayed after extraction from serum followed by radioimmunoassay of the extract with 125I-cortisone and Sac-Cel (IDS, Tyne and Weir, U.K.) second antibody separation (22). The CV for 10 consecutive assays was <15% for values between 50 and 100 nmol/l and <10% for values over 100 nmol/l.

Calculated measures of pancreatic beta-cell function and insulin resistance were made using the homeostasis model assessment (HOMA) 2 model (23). The HOMA of beta-cell function (HOMA %B) values provide an index of pancreatic islet beta-cell function relative to a normal individual with a value set at 100%. Similarly, HOMA of insulin sensitivity (HOMA %S) values represent a measure of insulin sensitivity relative to a normal individual, again with a value of 100%. The HOMA of insulin resistance is a reciprocal measure of the %S values.

Urinary corticosteroid metabolite analysis was performed by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) as described previously (20). The sum of total cortisol metabolites (tetrahydrocortisol [THF], tetrahydrocortisone [THE], 5alpha-THF, alpha-cortolone, cortisone [E], cortisol [F], beta-cortolone, beta-cortol, and alpha-cortol) provides a reflection of cortisol secretion rate. The ratio of tetrahydrometabolites of cortisol (THF + 5alphaTHF) to those of cortisone (THE) provides a reflection of 11beta-HSD1 activity when considered with the ratio of urinary free cortisol to cortisone, which more accurately reflects renal 11beta-HSD2 activity (20). The ratios of cortols to cortolones and of 11beta-hydroxy-etiocholanolone and 11beta-hydroxy-androsterone combined to 11oxo-etiocholanolone also reflect 11beta-HSD1 activity (24). The activities of 5alpha- and 5beta-reductases can be inferred from measuring the ratio of 5alpha THF to THF and androsterone to etiocholanolone.

Two women (3.0%) and three men (8.6%) had impaired fasting glucose (IFG) (>5.6 mmol/l), and within this group, two men and no women had IGT. IGT with normal fasting glucose concentrations was observed in 15 women (22.7%) and 10 men (28.6%). Type 2 diabetes was diagnosed in two women (3.0%) and five men (14.3%), and all subjects with type 2 diabetes had IFG. Taking into account the sexual dimorphism described in body composition and glucocorticoid metabolite production rates, subsequent analysis was performed separately in men and women.

A1C was increased in both men and women with IGT, although this only reached statistical significance in men (men 5.3 +/- 0.1 vs. 5.9 +/- 0.3%, P < 0.05; women 5.4 +/- 0.1 vs. 5.7 +/- 0.1%, P = 0.08). Surprisingly, measures of insulin resistance (HOMA-R, fasting and 2-h insulin concentrations) were not different between groups (Table 1). Furthermore, body composition analysis by DEXA failed to show differences in fat-free mass or total or regional fat mass between those patients with normal glucose tolerance or IGT (Table 1). Although men and women were not different in terms of insulin resistance (as measured by HOMA, fasting insulin, 2-h insulin or insulin AUC across the 75-g OGTT, percent trunk fat and absolute total and trunk fat mass were higher in women with correspondingly lower fat-free masses (Table 1).

Urinary steroid metabolite analysis by GC/MS demonstrated clear sexual dimorphism with increased total and individual glucocorticoid metabolite production rates in men compared with women for subjects with and without IGT (Table 2). When analyzed according to glucose tolerance, total glucocorticoid production rates were higher in women with IGT compared with women with normal glucose tolerance (10,133 +/- 1,488 vs. 7,453 +/- 469, respectively, P < 0.05), but this relationship was not observed in men (16,871 +/- 2,113 vs. 13,743 +/- 863, respectively, P = 0.17). Furthermore, there were no differences in absolute production rates for individual metabolites or activities of metabolizing enzymes (in particular 11beta-HSD1 or 5alphaR) when comparing normal and IGT subjects (Table 2).

In women only, adipose tissue 11beta-HSD1 expression was higher in those with IGT than in those with normal glucose tolerance (0.5 +/- 0.06 vs. 0.29 +/- 0.03 AU, P < 0.005), despite fat mass (total and regional) being similar between the two groups (Fig. 1A). Moreover, expression correlated with glucose AUC across the OGTT (R = 0.44, P < 0.005) (Fig. 1B) but not with fat mass (total fat mass R = 0.12, P = NS; trunk fat mass R = 0.15, P = NS). H6PDH expression was lower in female volunteers with IGT (0.79 +/- 0.1 vs. 1.38 +/- 0.14 AU, P < 0.05), but GR and 5alphaR1 expression did not differ (Fig. 1A). In contrast to our findings in women, expression of 11beta-HSD1, H6PDH, GR, and 5alphaR1 in adipose tissue biopsies from men did not differ between those with and those without IGT and did not relate to glucose levels across an OGTT (Fig. 1C and D).

Univariate regression analysis revealed positive relationships between 5alphaR activity (as measured by both the urinary androsterone-to-etiocholanolone and 5alphaTHF-to-THF ratios) and markers of insulin resistance. In women, significant correlations were observed with fasting insulin, 2-h insulin levels after 75 g oral glucose, AUC insulin across the OGTT, and HOMA-R (Table 3 and Fig. 2A-D). In men, a similar pattern was observed (Table 3; Fig. 2A-D), but in addition, increased 5alphaR activity was associated with decreased pancreatic beta-cell function as calculated from the HOMA-%B (Table 3).

Activity of 5alphaR increased with increasing total and regional fat and fat-free mass in men but not in women (Table 3). While these relationships remained significant, they were weaker than those observed with markers of insulin resistance. There was no relationship in either sex with fat distribution as measured by waist circumference, WHR, or the trunk fat-to-limb fat ratio via DEXA.

Total glucocorticoid secretion rate increased with total and regional fat and fat-free mass in women but not in men and was weakly associated with 2-h insulin concentration after 75 g oral glucose (Table 4). Global 11beta-HSD1 activity as measured by the 5alpha THF + THF-to-THE ratio was unrelated to metabolic or anthropometric variables in women and only weakly related to HOMA-R in men (R = 0.38, P = 0.04). 11beta-HSD2 inactivates cortisol to cortisone in mineralocorticoid target tissues, notably the kidney. Activity is reflected in the ratio of urinary free cortisol to cortisone. This was unrelated to metabolic parameters with the exception of 2-h insulin levels in men only (R = 0.389, P = 0.03) and inversely related to WHR in women only (R = -0.30, P = 0.04).

In this unselected cohort of obese patients, we have identified the prevalence of IGT to be 22.7% in women and 34.2% in men and the prevalence of type 2 diabetes to be 3.0% in women and 14.3% in men. This was associated with central fat distribution (but not absolute fat mass) in women and unrelated to fat mass or distribution in men.

In this cohort, subcutaneous adipose tissue 11beta-HSD1 mRNA expression was higher in women with IGT and correlated with glucose secretion across the OGTT but was unrelated to fat mass, consistent with our previous observations (25). Previous studies have examined 11beta-HSD1 mRNA expression and activity in adipose tissue in the context of fat mass with variable results. Within the subcutaneous depot, most studies, although not all, have suggested increased expression with indexes of obesity (25-29), but relative expression within the intra-abdominal depot remains controversial. Importantly, the expression of 11beta-HSD1 in adipose tissue and its relationship with insulin resistance and glucose tolerance has not been examined before. While expression studies were only performed in subcutaneous adipose tissue, enhanced cortisol generation through increased 11beta-HSD1 mRNA expression may contribute to glucose intolerance through increased lipolysis (30,31) and generation of free fatty acids, which impair peripheral glucose uptake (32). However, due to the small volumes of tissue obtained, activity studies were not performed and it is possible that decreased H6PDH expression that we also observed in the IGT group may decrease 11beta-HSD1 oxo-reductase activity by limiting cofactor supply.

Sexually dimorphic activity and expression of 11beta-HSD1 has been described in some studies (33) but not all (34). In our cohort, urinary GC/MS analysis was similar in men and women. Studies examining sex-specific regulation of expression within adipose tissue are lacking. In nonadipose tissue, estradiol has been shown to regulate expression levels, and it is possible that this may contribute to our observations; however, the published data are often contradictory with studies showing both increased and decreased expression (35-38). With the exception of dehydroepiandrosterone (39), there is little evidence to support a role for regulation by androgens (35,38). Sexually dimorphic expression of H6PDH has not been described previously, and the observed increase in expression in men will need to be endorsed with dedicated activity studies to see if changes in H6PDH expression translate into alterations in glucocorticoid availability. However, it is possible that this could contribute to differences in fat distribution between men and women, with the consequent increase in cardiovascular risk (40).

In our study, in both sexes, 5alphaR activity as measured by urinary glucocorticoid metabolite ratios increased with indexes of insulin resistance, an observation that was independent of fat mass. The role of 5alphaR in the control of body composition and insulin sensitivity has not been explored in detail in the published literature. The global measures of activity that we have used in this study do not allow us to distinguish between 5alphaR1 and 5alphaR2, and whereas patients with 5alphaR2 mutations have clear evidence of abnormal hepatic cortisol metabolism (41), the contribution of 5alphaR1 is yet to be clarified. Sexual dimorphism of 5alphaR activity has been described with increased activity in male subjects (10,34). In our study, absolute levels of 5alpha- and 5beta-reduced metabolites were higher in men (as was total glucocorticoid production rate), but the relative balance of 5alphaR and 5betaR activity was not different. Furthermore, 5alphaR1 mRNA expression in subcutaneous adipose tissue was similar in men and women. Studies in small cohorts of patients have shown enhanced 5alphaR activity with obesity (42) and type 2 diabetes (43) and regulation of 5alphaR and 5betaR activity by dietary macronutrient composition; high-fat, low-carbohydrate and moderate-fat, moderate-carbohydrate diets decrease 5alphaR and 5betaR activity in the context of weight loss (44). Thiazolidinedione treatment of obese Zucker rats decreases 5alphaR1 expression in the liver (45), but similar experiments in humans have not been performed. However, we have recently shown that following weight loss with consequent insulin sensitization, 5alphaR activity decreased (46). 5alphaR has been implicated in the pathogenesis of the insulin resistance associated with PCOS, in that patients with PCOS are more insulin resistant compared with body composition-matched control subjects (4) and have increased 5alphaR activity (47). Moreover, within a cohort of patients with PCOS, 5alphaR activity correlates with insulin resistance (48). Our findings are consistent with these data and extend this observation to healthy obese women and men, as well as demonstrate that the relationship (in both sexes) is independent of fat mass. In the context of insulin resistance, we postulate that increased 5alphaR activity represents a compensatory mechanism to decrease local glucocorticoid availability and occurs in conjunction with the decrease in 11beta-HSD1 activity (as evidenced by reduced cortisol generation following oral cortisone administration and decreased urinary 5alpha- + THF-to-THE ratios) that we and others have previously described in obesity (22,26). These processes act together (decreased generation of cortisol through a reduction in 11beta-HSD1 and increased inactivation of cortisol through enhanced 5alphaR activity) to decrease local glucocorticoid availability and decrease GR activation specifically within the liver, with the aim of maintenance of hepatic insulin sensitivity. A further impact of these changes will be to drive the hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal axis in order to maintain circulating cortisol levels. While we believe that the changes that we have observed largely reflect hepatic glucocorticoid metabolism, a direct effect upon insulin secretion cannot be excluded. However, this remains highly speculative, bearing in mind that evidence of A-ring reductase expression in human pancreatic islets is lacking.

Pharmacological manipulation of glucocorticoid availability through prereceptor metabolism adds credence to our observations. Selective 11beta-HSD1 inhibitors that decrease local glucocorticoid availability remain an exciting therapeutic prospect. Significant improvements in insulin sensitivity, glucose tolerance, and lipid profiles following short-term administration in rodents and primates have been observed. Human clinical studies are still eagerly awaited. Conversely, Finasteride (5alphaR2 inhibitor) and Dutasteride (combined 5alphaR1 and 5alphaR2 inhibitor) are widely used in the treatment of prostatic hypertrophy (49) based upon their action upon androgen metabolism. However, by decreasing glucocorticoid inactivation, they may have a detrimental impact upon insulin sensitivity, but the studies to address this question have not been performed.

In conclusion, this study adds to the growing body of evidence that supports a role for 5alphaR in the control of insulin sensitivity in simple obesity. While little is currently known about the regulation of 5alphaR activity, limiting local glucocorticoid availability through enhanced 5alphaR and/or inhibition of 11beta-HSD1 activity may have significant clinical benefits. Finally, prospective studies examining the changes in activity and expression of these enzymes over time may begin to shed light on their potential role in the development of IGT and type 2 diabetes.
