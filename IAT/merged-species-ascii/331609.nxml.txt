We previously described the construction of an intronless mouse thymidylate synthase (TS) minigene that has the normal 5' and 3' flanking regions of the gene linked to full length TS cDNA. Transfection of the minigene into ts- hamster V79 cells led to low level expression of normal mouse TS mRNA and protein. In the present study we analyzed the effect of introns on the expression of the TS minigene in transient transfection assays. Inclusion of introns 5 and 6 at their normal locations in the coding region led to an 8-9-fold stimulation of the level of TS and TS mRNA. Almost all of introns 5 and 6 could be deleted without diminishing the stimulatory effect. Inclusion of intron 3 also stimulated the expression of the minigene, although to a lesser extent than introns 5 and 6. However, inclusion of intron 4 had no stimulatory effect. Analysis of minigenes that contained various combinations of introns revealed that the stimulatory effects of the introns were not additive.
