We present the nucleotide sequence of the galactokinase gene (galK) of Escherichia coli including its 5' and 3' flanking regions. This DNA sequence derives from the lambda gal8 transducing phage and is identical to the sequence present in the galK gene fusion vectors, pKO and pKG, commonly used to study transcriptional regulatory elements. We define the precise 3' junction between the bacterial and phage sequences in lambda gal8 and demonstrate that this junction probably results from a homologous recombination event between identical 9 bp sequences common to the gal operon and phage lambda. Moreover, we examine the 300 bp region located immediately beyond galK for transcription termination function and find no gal operon terminator. Lastly, we compare the galK genes of E. coli and the yeast S. cerevisiae and find several regions of strong homology among which is a potential ATP-binding site homology shared by a variety of ATP-binding proteins including protein kinases encoded by mammalian oncogenes.
