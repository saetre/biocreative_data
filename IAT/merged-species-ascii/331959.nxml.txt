Kin17 is a 45 kDa protein encoded by the KIN17 gene located on mouse chromosome 2, band A. The kin17 amino acid sequence predicts two domains, which were shown to be functional: (i) a bipartite nuclear localization signal (NLS) that can drive the protein to the cell nucleus, (ii) a bona fide zinc finger of the C2H2 type. The zinc finger is involved in kin17 binding to double-stranded DNA since a mutant deleted of the zinc finger, kin17 delta 1, showed reduced binding. Single-stranded DNA was bound poorly by kin17. Interestingly, we found that kin17 protein showed preferential binding to curved DNA from either pBR322 or synthetic oligonucleotides. Binding of kin17 to a non-curved DNA segment increased after we had inserted into it a short curved synthetic oligonucleotide. Kin17 delta 2, a mutant deleted of 110 amino acids at the C-terminal end, still exhibited preferential binding to curved DNA and so did kin17 delta 1, suggesting that a domain recognizing curved DNA is located in the protein core.
