Repetitive DNA sequences in the human corticotropin-beta-lipotropin precursor gene region have been studied by blot hybridization analysis and DNA sequencing. Six repetitive sequences are present in this gene region; five of them are Alu family members with an approximate length of 300 base pairs, and the other consists of a portion of an Alu family sequence. Two of these Alu family members are located in the 5'-flanking region of the gene, and the remaining four within the intervening sequences. These Alu family sequences constitute inverted repeats in the intervening sequences as well as in the 5'-flanking region of the gene.
