The nucleotide sequence of chicken, pheasant, duck and Tetrahymena pyriformis U5 RNAs as well as that of new mammalian variant U5 RNAs was determined and compared to that of rat and HeLa cells U5 RNAs. Primary structure conservation is about 95% between rat and human cells, 82% between mammals and birds and 57% between the Protozoan and mammals. The same model of secondary structure, a free single-stranded region flanked by two hairpins can be constructed from all RNAs and is identical to the model previously proposed for mammalian U5 RNA on an experimental basis (1). Thus, this model is confirmed and is likely to be that of an ancestor U5 RNA. The 3' region of the U5 RNA molecule constitutes domain A, and is common to U1, U2, U4 and U5 RNAs (2). The characteristic nucleotide sequences of domain A are highly conserved throughout the phylogenetic evolution of U5 RNA suggesting that they are important elements in the function of the four small RNAs. Another region of high evolutionary conservation is the top part of the 5' side hairpin whose conserved sequence is specific to U5 RNA. It might participate in the particular function of U5 RNA.
