A human H4 histone gene was isolated and the nucleotide sequences of the mRNA coding as well as the 5' and 3' flanking regions were determined. No intervening sequences were found in this gene. A series of sequences which have been assigned putative regulatory roles in histone genes and/or in other genes were identified both upstream and downstream from the H4 histone protein coding region. Deletion mutants were constructed by BAL-31 nuclease digestion of sequences in the 5' flanking region of this H4 histone gene and were assayed in an in vitro transcription system. No regions upstream from the TATA box were required for site specific initiation in vitro. Data are presented which suggest that sequences located downstream from the 3' end of the coding region may influence the in vitro transcription of this human H4 histone gene.
