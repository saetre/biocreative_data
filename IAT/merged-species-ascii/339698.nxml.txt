It was previously determined that the distal portion of the ilvGMEDA operon was expressed despite the insertion of transposons into ilvG and ilvE. This observation suggested the existence of internal promoters upstream of ilvE (pE) and ilvD (pD). The internal promoter pE, responsible for part of ilvEDA expression, has been analyzed both in vivo and in vitro. Our results indicate that: pE exists in both E. coli K-12 and S. typhimurium; pE is located in the distal end of the ilvM coding sequence; the pE sequence is highly conserved in the two bacteria; the amino acid sequence of the ilvM gene product is 93% homologous between the two bacteria; transcription from pE can be demonstrated both in vivo and in vitro; the efficiency of pE is essentially equivalent in the two bacteria.
