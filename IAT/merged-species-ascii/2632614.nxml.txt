Interferon induced tetratricopeptide repeat protein 2 (IFIT-2, P54) belongs to the type I interferon response genes and is highly induced after stimulation with LPS. The biological function of this protein is so far unclear. Previous studies indicated that IFIT-2 binds to the initiation factor subunit eIF-3c, affects translation initiation and inhibits protein synthesis. The aim of the study was to further characterize the function of IFIT-2.

Stimulation of RAW264.7 macrophages with LPS or IFN-gamma leads to the expression of IFIT-2 in a type I interferon dependent manner. By using stably transfected RAW264.7 macrophages overexpressing IFIT-2 we found that IFIT-2 inhibits selectively LPS induced expression of TNF-alpha, IL-6, and MIP-2 but not of IFIT-1 or EGR-1. In IFIT-2 overexpressing cells TNF-alpha mRNA expression was lower after LPS stimulation due to reduced mRNA stability. Further experiments suggest that characteristics of the 3'UTR of transcripts discriminate whether IFIT-2 has a strong impact on protein expression or not.

Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) induces a very complex host response through toll-like receptor (TLR) 4 in macrophages. Among these responses, the production of inflammatory mediators such as tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and interleukin (IL)-6 as well as reactive oxygen species such as nitric oxide (NO) play important roles in protecting the host against bacterial infection. LPS binds to the TLR4/MD2 complex. Ligand binding leads to the recruitment of adaptor molecules such as MyD88 and Trif. MyD88 signals through a complex signaling cascade leading to phosphorylation of the NF-kappaB inhibitor IkappaB. IkappaB is degraded and NF-kappaB released in the nucleus where it acts as a transcription factor for inflammatory response genes. In addition MyD88 signaling activates MAP kinases such as p38, JNK and ERK which are also involved in this proinflammatory response. Trif-mediated signaling which is elicited by binding of LPS to TLR-4 or dsRNA to TLR-3 leads to the activation of transcription factors such as IRF-3 which binds to ISRE elements and induces IFN-beta (for review see [1-3]. IFN-beta in turn induces many interferon inducible genes such as interferon-induced tetratricopeptide repeat proteins (IFIT)-1, IFIT-2 but also amplifies the expression of MyD88 dependent genes such as IL-12 p70, IL-6 or TNF-alpha (for review see [1-3].

Type I interferons have pleiotropic functions [4] including defense against viruses [5,6] and tumor development [4,7]. and they also play a role in immunopathological disorders such as systemic lupus erythematodes (SLE) [8], sepsis [9] or contribute to pathogenesis of bacterial infections [10]. Meanwhile many type I interferon induced genes have been described [11-13], but it is only partially understood how they contribute to effector functions of type I interferons.

IFIT-1 (ISG56, P56) and IFIT-2 (ISG54, P54) are induced in response to type I and type II interferons, dsRNA, LPS, viral [14] and bacterial infections [15] and they are also found in several chronic diseases such as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) [16] or SLE. Human IFIT-1 and IFIT-2 as well as mouse IFIT-1 and IFIT-2 are linked genes and located either on human chromosome 10 or mouse chromosome 19[17,18]. The encoded IFIT-1 and IFIT-2 proteins are related and contain multiple tetratricopeptide-repeat (TPR) motifs. It was demonstrated that IFIT-1 and IFIT-2 inhibit translation initiation by inhibiting the action of the eIF3 protein complex [19-21]. Human IFIT-1 binds to eIF3e and blocks the ability of eIF3 to stabilize the ternary complex of eIF2, GTP and Met-tRNA. Mouse IFIT-1 and mouse IFIT-2 bind to eIF3c and block the ability of eIF3 to promote formation of the 48 S pre-initiation complex containing the 40 S ribosomal subunit, the ternary complex, eIF4F and mRNA [21]. Nevertheless so far no genes have been described which are actually negatively regulated by IFIT-2. To define genes inhibited by mouse IFIT-2 we generated a stable cell line which constitutively expresses IFIT-2. Our findings suggest that the 3'UTR of certain transcripts determines the selectivity for IFIT-2 mediated inhibition of protein expression in RAW264.7 cells.

To confirm previous findings that LPS and interferons induce IFIT-2 protein expression RAW264.7 macrophages were stimulated for different time periods with LPS, IFN-beta, Pam3Cys or IFN-gamma (Figure 1A). All used stimuli induced IFIT-2 expression but showed differences in the time course of IFIT-2 expression. Thus, while IFN-beta induced IFIT-2 expression already 4 hours after stimulation, strong IFIT expression was detectable 6 hours after LPS stimulation and 12 hours after IFN-gamma or Pam3Cys stimulation. Immunofluorescence staining of RAW264.7 cells showed that IFIT-2 was located in the cytoplasm (Figure 1B).

Blocking of the IFN-alpha/beta receptor with specific antibodies against the mouse IFN-alpha/beta receptor subunit 1 (MAR1 mAb) demonstrated that LPS, Pam3Cys and IFN-gamma induced IFIT-2 expression is dependent on endogenous production of type I interferons (Figure 1C, D). As a control, blocking antibody against the human IFN-gammaR (GIR-218) was used. This data indicates that IFIT-2 seems to be induced in a specifically type I interferon dependent manner.

In previous reports it was demonstrated that IFIT-2 interacts with eIF-3c, interferes with translation initiation and inhibits protein synthesis. So far it was unclear whether IFIT-2 affects protein synthesis globally or in a selective manner. To address this question RAW264.7 macrophages were stably transfected with an IFIT-2 expression vector. The resulting cells (RAW-IFIT-2) were viable and showed no obvious defect in proliferation. Constitutive IFIT-2 expression was detectable (Figure 2).

In similar, IFIT-2 overexpression significantly reduced MIP-2 secretion (more than 80%), and IL-6 secretion (more than 95%), as detected by ELISA. In contrast, VEGF secretion was not affected. By using immunoblots the protein expression of several other LPS induced proteins such as IFIT-1 and EGR-1 was determined prior to and after LPS stimulation at different time points. Since EGR-1 expression is predominantly found in the nucleus, protein expression of EGR-1 was determined in nuclear extracts. IFIT-1 and EGR-1 were similarly expressed at indicated time points in IFIT-2 and parental RAW macrophages (Figure 4), which was also confirmed by quantification of the band intensities of immunoblots. Thus, quantification of EGR-1 expression 2 h after LPS stimulation revealed a ratio of EGR-1 found in RAW264.7 compared to RAW-IFIT-2 cells of 0.9 +/- 0.2 :1 (n = four experiments).

To investigate whether IFIT-2 overexpression also affects LPS mediated signal transduction RAW 264.7 and RAW-IFIT-2 cells were stimulated with LPS for different time periods and immunoblots were performed to determine phosphorylation of ERK, JNK, p38 and IkappaB using specific antibodies. As a control total amounts of ERK, JNK, p38, IkappaB as well as actin were determined (Figure 5). Band intensities of three experiments were quantified, normalized to actin and compared for each time point between RAW264.7 and RAW-IFIT2 cells. Slight differences were found for phosphorylated IkappaB 10, 30 and 60 minutes after LPS stimulation (ratio RAW264.7 : RAW-IFIT-2; 0.7 +/- 0.1, 0.7 +/- 0.1 and 0.7 +/- 0.3) and for phosphorylated p38 only 10 minutes after stimulation (ratio RAW264.7 : RAW-IFIT-2; 1.4 +/- 0.1). Taken together, IFIT-2 overexpression did not or did only marginally affect phosphorylation of the investigated signaling molecules. In addition, the expression patterns of the total amounts of these proteins over time after LPS stimulation showed only small variations (data not shown). These data suggest that IFIT-2 overexpression does not affect substantially LPS mediated signal transduction.

If IFIT-2 only affected protein expression, LPS induced TNF-alpha mRNA expression would be expected to be similar in RAW and RAW-IFIT-2 cells. To investigate whether mRNA expression is affected by IFIT-2, RAW264.7 and RAW-IFIT-2 cells were stimulated and IFIT-1 and TNF-alpha mRNA expression was determined by Real-time RT-PCR (Figure 6A-B). While LPS induced IFIT-1 mRNA expression was not affected by IFIT-2 overexpression, TNF-alpha mRNA expression levels were decreased significantly up to two-fold four and six hours after stimulation.

To assess whether mRNA stability was affected by IFIT-2 overexpression, RAW264.7 and RAW-IFIT-2 clones were stimulated with LPS for 2 hours. Subsequently cells were treated with actinomycin D and mRNA expression was determined by Real-time PCR at different time points (Figure 6C). The stability of TNF-alpha mRNA was significantly decreased in RAW IFIT-2 cells. The half-life of TNF-alpha mRNA in LPS stimulated RAW264.7 cells (t1/2 = 25 minutes) was approximately two-fold higher than in RAW-IFIT-2 cells (t1/2 = 13 minutes). This finding explains the differences in TNF-alpha mRNA levels found between LPS stimulated RAW264.7 and RAW-IFIT-2 cells but not the differences in protein expression levels.

Previous studies showed that distinct elements in the 3'UTR such as the GAIT element which was found in the 3'UTR of ceruloplasmin play an important role for translational control [22-24]. Therefore we hypothesized that the 3' UTR of transcripts might determine the selectivity of IFIT-2 to inhibit protein synthesis. To investigate whether characteristics of different 3'UTRs may be important for IFIT-2 mediated inhibition of protein expression, RAW 264.7 and RAW-IFIT-2 cells were co-transfected with an expression vector expressing cherry flanked by a polyA signal but without 3'UTR (as a control for transfection efficiency) and different expression vectors encoding for EGFP flanked by no 3'UTR (GFP), the TNF-alpha, MIP-2, IL-6, IFIT-1 or VEGF 3'UTR. Subsequently cherry and EGFP expression was determined by flow cytometry (Figure 7). To ensure that only transfected cells were investigated, only cells were analyzed which expressed cherry. The mean fluorescence for EGFP expression was comparable in RAW264.7 and RAW-IFIT-2 cells if an EGFP expression vector was used flanked by no 3'UTR. Transfection experiments using EGFP constructs flanked by the 3'UTR of TNF-alpha, IL-6 and MIP-2 revealed that EGFP expression was approximately 70% reduced in RAW-IFIT-2 compared to RAW264.7 cells. In contrast the 3'UTRs of IFIT-1 and VEGF had only a minor effect on EGFP expression. These data indicate that the 3'UTR plays an important role for the specificity of IFIT-2 to inhibit protein expression in RAW macrophages. One of the best studied 3'UTRs is the TNF-alpha 3'UTR and regions are defined which are important for posttranscriptional regulation such as the AU-rich region (ARE) which controls mRNA decay and translation and the constitutive decay element (CDE) which also affects mRNA stability [25-27].

To define a distinct element in the 3'UTR of TNF-alpha, RAW264.7 and RAW-IFIT-2 cells were transfected with constructs encoding EGFP flanked by deletion mutants of the 3'UTR of TNF-alpha (Figure 8). EGFP expression was significantly reduced by more than 70% in IFIT-2 cells compared to RAW264.7 cells using the constructs TNF 862-1621 (P1) and TNF 1340-1621 (P3). Since P3 lacks the proximal part of the 3'UTR including the AU-rich region one can conclude that the ARE plays no role for the IFIT-2 mediated inhibition of expression. In contrast, transfection with TNF 862-1380 (P7) resulted in a similar GFP expression in both RAW264.7 and RAW-IFIT-2 cells indicating that the distal part of the 3'UTR containing the CDE element is essential for IFIT-2 mediated inhibition of expression.

Previous studies demonstrated that IFIT-2 is highly expressed after stimulation with LPS as well as interferons. Our findings confirm these studies and show that LPS as well as IFN-gamma induced IFIT-2 expression is dependent on endogenous secretion of type I interferons. Therefore one can assume that IFIT-2 may represent an effector protein which may be responsible for some of the effects which are associated with type I interferon function.

Although IFIT-2 has been known for quite a long time and is strongly expressed in many diseases such as SLE, inflammatory bowel diseases, and viral or bacterial infections, little is known about the biological function of this protein. Recently it was demonstrated that mIFIT-2 inhibits translation by binding to eIF-3c, interferes with translation initiation and inhibits protein synthesis at least in in vitro translation assays [19,21]. Although these studies clearly showed that IFIT-2 could be involved in regulation of protein synthesis it was so far totally unclear whether IFIT-2 affects protein expression in a global or selective manner.

The presented study may shed some light on the function of IFIT-2. As shown here forced IFIT-2 expression does not globally affect protein expression but acts in a more specific manner. We could identify several proteins which are induced by LPS and which are inhibited in protein expression by forced IFIT-2 expression. Examination of LPS triggered phosphorylation of signal molecules of TLR-4 signaling pathways in cells with or without forced IFIT-2 expression excludes that IFIT-2 substantially affects signal transduction. This data indicates that the principal mechanism of IFIT-2 mediated inhibition of LPS triggered cytokine secretion is for instance different to the negative regulation mediated by FLN29 [28]. FLN29 which is induced eight hours after LPS stimulation in a Trif-dependent manner interacts with TRAF6 and inhibits IkappaB and ERK phosphorylation after restimulation with LPS. Thus, our data using cells overexpressing IFIT-2 argue against the possibility that LPS induced IFIT-2 may affect prominently signal transduction of the tested pathways as it was demonstrated for FLN29 [28]. As shown for TNF-alpha as an example, forced IFIT-2 overexpression in RAW cells affects to some extent mRNA expression. Actinomycin D treatment shows that reduced TNF-alpha mRNA expression is associated with reduced mRNA stability. This data strongly argues that IFIT-2 overexpression mediates reduced mRNA stability and therefore acts posttranscriptionally. Nevertheless, we cannot totally rule out that to some extent also transcription might be affected. Since TNF-alpha mRNA expression is only reduced up to 50%, reduced mRNA stability does not totally explain reduced protein expression. Therefore, we conclude that forced IFIT-2 expression may act at different levels of posttranscriptional regulation. At this point we do not know whether these processes act separately or are linked together. Since not all proteins and especially not all LPS induced proteins are affected by forced IFIT-2 expression we initiated studies to determine possible mechanisms for the action of IFIT-2.

Several other reports pointed out that specific translational control is determined by distinct elements in the 3'UTR to which proteins bind and this interaction of RNA binding proteins with distinct sequence stretches mediates translational silencing. For instance it was described that IFN-gamma stimulation leads to formation of the GAIT protein complex consisting of four proteins which bind to distinct stem loops in the 3'UTR of ceruloplasmin [22-24]. These interactions interfere with translation initiation. Therefore we wanted to investigate whether the characteristics of 3'UTRs of the genes we addressed in this study discriminate whether IFIT-2 mediates inhibition of protein expression or not.

By transfection of plasmids expressing EGFP flanked by different 3'UTRs in RAW264.7 and RAW-IFIT-2 cells we could demonstrate that IFIT-2 affects EGFP expression dependent on the 3'UTR attached to the coding sequence of EGFP. Consistent with decreased TNF-alpha, MIP-2 and IL-6 secretion after LPS stimulation in RAW-IFIT-2 cells, 3'UTRs of TNF-alpha, MIP-2 and IL-6 mediated lower EGFP expression in RAW-IFIT-2 cells compared to RAW264.7 cells. In contrast, the 3'UTRs of IFIT-1 or VEGF did not influence EGFP expression in RAW-IFIT-2 cells. We conclude that specific properties of the 3'UTRs determine whether IFIT-2 affects protein expression of a certain gene or not. There is already detailed knowledge about different elements of the TNF-3'UTR for the posttranscriptional regulation. Thus, the AU-rich elements (ARE) are important for posttranscriptional regulation. When inserted into reporter constructs, the ARE of TNF-alpha induces processive deadenylation of the mRNA and efficiently targets the body of the transcript for rapid degradation [26,29]. In addition, the ARE of TNF-alpha inhibits stable association with the 40 S ribosomal subunit and prevents translation [27]. Decay is mediated through binding of the zinc finger protein tristetraprolin (TTP) to the ARE, as shown with TTP-deficient mice which show elevated levels of TNF-alpha due to an increase in the mRNA half-life [30]. Additional proteins such as huR and TIA-1 interact with the ARE and influence mRNA stability and translation [31,32]. In addition the constitutive decay element (CDE) was described which constitutively mediates decay of TNF-alpha mRNA [25]. However no proteins were so far described which may bind to the CDE element.

Our experiments using RAW264.7 and RAW-IFIT-2 cells transfected with EGFP constructs flanked by different 3'UTRs clearly indicate that the characteristics of the 3'UTRs define whether forced IFIT-2 expression can mediate inhibition of protein expression or not. Deletion of parts of the 3'UTR of TNF-alpha revealed that the distal part of the 3'UTR containing the CDE element is sufficient for IFIT-2 mediated inhibition of protein expression while the ARE element has no impact. How IFIT-2 controls protein expression via 3'UTRs remains to be elucidated in further studies. Taken together, our data suggest that IFIT-2 acts as a regulatory protein which may repress the protein expression of distinct genes.

At this point, however, the number of proteins which may be affected by IFIT-2 is not known. Therefore, it is hard to predict how this function of IFIT-2 may translate finally into in vivo function of IFIT-2 as an interferon induced effector protein. In further studies it is necessary to investigate the in vivo function of IFIT-2 by additional tools such as IFIT-2 knock-out mice.
