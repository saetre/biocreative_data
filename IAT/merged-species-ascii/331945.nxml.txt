The large conjugative plasmid pIP501 was originally isolated from Streptococcus agalactiae. To study the molecular basis of pIP501 replication we determined the nucleotide sequence of a 2.2 kb DNA segment which is essential and sufficient for autonomous replication of pIP501 derived plasmids, in Bacillus subtilis cells. This region can be divided into two functionally discrete segments: a 496 bp region (oriR) that acts as an origin of replication, and a 1488 bp segment coding for an essential replication protein (RepR). The RepR protein, which has a molecular mass of 57.4 kDa, could complement in trans a thermosensitive replicon bearing the pIP501 origin. Chimeric Rep proteins and replicons were obtained by domain swapping between rep genes of closely related streptococcal plasmids belonging to the inc18 group (pIP501, pAM beta 1 and pSM19035). The chimeras were functional in B. subtilis.
