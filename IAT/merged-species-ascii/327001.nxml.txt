The distribution of the methylatable sites GATC and CCATGG was studied by analyzing the molecular average size of restriction fragments of E. coli DNA. Both sites were found to be randomly distributed, reflecting a random pattern of methylation. The methylation pattern of specific sequences such as the origin of replication and rRNA genes has been studied in wild type E. coli and a methylation deficient (dam- dcm-) mutant. These sequences were found to be methylated in wild type cells and unmethylated in the mutant indicating that there is no effect of the state of methylation of these sequences on their expression. Analysis of the state of methylation of GATC sites in newly replicating DNA using the restriction enzyme Dpn I (cleaves only when both strands are methylated) revealed no detectable hemimethylated DNA suggesting that methylation occurs at the replication fork. Taking together the results presented here and previously published data (5), we arrive at the conclusion that the most likely function of E. coli DNA methylations is probably in preventing nuclease activity.
