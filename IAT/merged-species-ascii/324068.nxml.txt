The construction and identification of a recombinant plasmid containing a cDNA insert which hybridizes specifically to myosin heavy chain mRNA is described. The plasmid was used as a probe to screen a rat genomic library for recombinant phages containing myosin heavy chain sequences. Six clones with approximately 15 k bp inserts each were isolated. Digestion with several restriction enzymes and hybridization of the fractionated DNA with the plasmid probe showed that the clones contained 3 different DNA inserts. Electron microscopy of a heteroduplex made by hybridization of DNA from two clones confirmed that the inserts originated in different genes. Hybridization of size-fractionated ECOR1 digested rat spleen DNA with the cloned probe suggested the existence of at least 5 myosin heavy chain genes.
