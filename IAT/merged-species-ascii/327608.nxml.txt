U1 RNA from cultured Drosophila melanogaster cells (Kc) was identified by its ability to be recognized, as an RNP, by anti-(U1)RNP antibodies from human lupus patients. Its sequence was deduced largely from direct analysis of the RNA molecule and then confirmed by DNA sequence determinations on a genomic clone isolated by hybridization to Drosophila U1 RNA. The Drosophila U1 RNA sequence exhibits 72% agreement with human U1 RNA. Nucleotides 3-11, which are complementary to the entire consensus sequence for donor (5') splice junctions in hnRNA, and to part of the acceptor (3') consensus, are exactly conserved. However, nucleotides 14-21, postulated to interact only with acceptor junctions, differ. Comparison of the Drosophila U1 sequence with vertebrate U1 sequences allows a particular secondary structure model to be preferred over others. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that U1 snRNPs are involved in splicing, but suggest specific modifications of the model detailing molecular interactions between U1 RNA and hnRNA during the splicing reaction.
