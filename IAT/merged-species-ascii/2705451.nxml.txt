We herein report the results of a whole genome scan performed in a Pietrain x Large White intercross counting 525 offspring to map QTL influencing economically important growth and carcass traits. We report experiment-wide significant lod scores (> 4.6 for meatiness and fat deposition on chromosome SSC2, and for average daily gain and carcass length on chromosome SSC7. Additional suggestive lod scores (> 3.3) for fat deposition are reported on chromosomes SSC1, SSC7 and SSC13. A significant dominance deviation was found for the QTL on SSC1, while the hypothesis of an additive QTL could not be rejected for the QTL on SSC7 and SSC13. No evidence for imprinted QTL could be found for QTL other than the one previously reported on SSC2.
