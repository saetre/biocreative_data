A cDNA library has been prepared from mouse embryo small RNAs and screened for the presence of clones complementary to the highly abundant cytoplasmic 7S RNA. One clone (pA6) was selected which hybridized exclusively with 7S RNA on a Northern blot prepared from cytoplasmic RNA run on high resolution polyacrylamide/urea gels. Sequence analysis of this clone has shown that at least 65 nucleotides at the 5' end of 7S RNA are extensively homologous with the highly repeated mouse B1 family. Heterologous hybridisations between the cloned mouse 7S sequence and RNAs prepared from rat, human and chick cells have shown that the non-B1 part of the 7S RNA molecule has been highly conserved during recent eucaryotic evolution. There are multiple copies of 7S RNA genes in the genomes of mouse, human, rat and chick cells, but substantial differences exist in copy number and genomic organisation in these organisms.
