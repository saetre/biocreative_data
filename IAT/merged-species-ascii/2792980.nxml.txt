GH insensitivity (GHI) is caused in the majority of cases by impaired function of the GH receptor (GHR). All but one known GHR mutation are in the coding sequence or the exon/intron boundaries. We identified and characterised the first intronic defect occurring in the polypyrimidine tract of the GHR in a patient with severe GHI.

GHR was analysed by direct sequencing. To assess the effect of the novel defect, two heterologous minigenes (wild-type and mutant L1-GHR8-L2) were generated by inserting GHR exon 8 and its flanking wild-type or mutant intronic sequences into a well-characterised splicing reporter (Adml-par L1-L2). 32P-labelled pre-mRNA was generated from the two constructs and incubated in HeLa nuclear extracts or HEK293 cells.

Sequencing of the GHR revealed a novel homozygous defect in the polypyrimidine tract of intron 7 (IVS7-6T>A). This base change does not involve the highly conserved splice site sequences, and is not predicted in silico to affect GHR mRNA splicing. Nevertheless, skipping of exon 8 from the mutant L1-GHR8-L2 mRNA was clearly demonstrated in the in vitro splicing assay and in transfected HEK293 cells.

Disruption of the GHR polypyrimidine tract causes aberrant mRNA splicing leading to a mutant GHR protein. This is predicted to lack its transmembrane and intracellular domains and, thus, be incapable of transducing a GH signal.

Primary GH insensitivity (GHI) is a rare inherited disorder characterised by severe postnatal growth failure, normal or increased GH secretion and insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF1) deficiency. In the majority of GHI patients, a genetic defect in the GH receptor (GHR) gene leading to a functionless receptor is present (1). Approximately 20% of these defects alter the mechanism by which GHR coding exons are defined and correctly assembled to form the mature mRNA (2), a process known as mRNA splicing (3).

Defects affecting the efficiency of mRNA splicing comprise one-half of DNA point mutations responsible for human genetic disease (3, 4). The majority of splice mutations disrupt the native splice site through a base change within the invariant donor or acceptor dinucleotides (5). Mutations within other splice elements, such as the polypyrimidine tract and the branch point, may also cause genetic diseases through the exclusion of a constitutive exon from the mature mRNA (6), but these are less frequent.

The wild-type minigene L1-GHR8-L2 was created by inserting the GHR exon 8 and its intronic boundaries between exons L1 and L2 of a well-characterised splice reporter Adml-par (7). The GHR exon 8 and 89 bp of its flanking introns were amplified from human genomic DNA, and exons L1 and L2 were amplified from Adml-par by PCR using specific primers (sequences available on request). The three exons were joined together by overlap extension PCR (8). Adml-par was amplified using primers T7-L1 and L2A (T7L1: 5' TAATACGACTCACTATAGGGAGACCGGCAGATCAGCTT 3', L2A: 5' ATCCAAGAGTACTGGAAAGACCG 3') and was used as a positive control for the splicing reaction. PCR products were run on a 1% agarose gel and those corresponding in size to the three-exon minigene were cut and purified by PCR gel extraction. The identity of the PCR product was confirmed by direct sequencing on the ABI 3700 sequencer. PCR products were cloned in the pGEM T-easy vector system (Promega), and the presence of the insert was assessed by direct sequencing of plasmid DNA. The mutant L1-GHR8-L2 minigene was obtained by site-directed mutagenesis using specific primers (sequences available on request) and the wild-type minigene as a template.

Wild-type and mutant minigenes L1-GHR8-L2 were subcloned from the bacterial pGEM T-easy vector into the mammalian pcDNA 3.1 vector. The identity and correct orientation of the pcDNA3.1 L1-GHR8-L2 insert were assessed by direct sequencing on the ABI 3700 sequencer. HEK293 cells were maintained in DMEM (Sigma-Aldrich) with 10% foetal bovine serum (Sigma-Aldrich) at 37 degreesC under 5% CO2 and split when confluent. Before transfection, HEK293 cells were seeded into a six-well plate. Cells were transiently transfected when approximately70% confluent with the wild-type or mutant pcDNA3.1 L1-GHR8-L2 plasmid (50 ng) using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). Forty-eight hours after transfection, cells were harvested, and RNA was extracted and reverse transcribed into cDNA. cDNA was amplified in the presence of 0.5 muCi [32P-alpha] dCTP with primers T7L1 and L2A in a 12.5 mul PCR mixture. PCR products were electrophoresed on an 8% non-denaturating polyacrylamide gel prior to autoradiography and quantitation on a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics Ltd, Chesham, Bucks, UK). The percentage of alternative splicing was calculated as the ratio of isoform/total of all isoforms, and results are presented as mean+/-s.d. of at least three separate experiments.

Approximately 20% of GHR defects causing GHI are splice mutations (2). All defects disrupt the invariant splice site sequences, with rare exceptions involving the activation of cryptic intronic (11) or exonic splice sites (12). The splicing process involves the recognition of splice elements by a ribonucleoprotein complex called the spliceosome (13). The polypyrimidine tract is an intronic sequence rich in pyrimidines (14-16). It is located upstream of the acceptor splice site, and has been shown to be involved in the initial stages of spliceosome binding to the mRNA (17). Mutational studies have demonstrated that the length and location of the polypyrimidine sequence can affect spliceosome apposition and, thus, splicing efficiency (18).

The intronic base change identified and characterised in this study is located upstream of the acceptor splice site of GHR intron 7 in the polypyrimidine tract. Mutations within this splice element are known to contribute to genetic diseases by inducing the exclusion of a constitutive exon or inclusion of an alternative one in the mature mRNA (5, 19). Nevertheless, mutations in the polypyrimidine tract are a rare finding, possibly because of the difficulty in predicting their deleterious effect. In silico prediction programs are, in fact, fairly reliable when used to predict the effects of nucleotide changes occurring at the invariant donor and acceptor dinucleotide sequences, but become less efficient as nucleotide changes occur further away from the splice sites or in different splicing elements, such as the polypyrimidine tract (20).

The T>A nucleotide substitution identified in homozygosity in this GHI patient and in heterozygosity in his parents shortens the polypyrimidine tract of GHR intron 7. In silico analysis did not predict the abolition of the acceptor splice site, but only a modest reduction in its score, whose significance was unclear. As mRNA from the patient was not available, the effect of this novel GHR intronic nucleotide change was investigated by comparing mRNA splicing of the mutant and the wild-type minigenes in HeLa nuclear extract and in HEK293 cells. A clear GHR exon skipping was demonstrated for the mutant mRNA in both systems. The thymine substitution is likely to affect GHR splicing by interfering with the binding of the U2AF spliceosome element to the GHR mRNA. The resulting mutant GHR transcript will lack exon 8, with exon 7 splicing into exon 9, as was the case for the exon 8 splice site mutation described by Woods et al., which led to an exon 8-lacking mutant GHR (21). The skipping of exon 8 causes a frameshift and the appearance of a premature stop codon.

The presence of circulating GHBP in our patient is evidence that the mutant GHR is expressed. Moreover, elevated GHBP levels suggest that the aberrant splicing caused by the polypyrimidine tract defect and documented in the in vitro experiment also occurs in vivo. GHBP is the product of the cleavage of the GHR and corresponds to its extracellular domain (22). The prematurely truncated receptor lacks its transmembrane and intracellular domains and would be unable to signal or be anchored in the cell membrane, thus explaining the elevated GHBP levels seen in our patient, as well as in previously described cases of mutant GHR arising from exon 8 splice site defects (21, 23). The characteristics of the GHBP arising from this mutant GHR were described by Woods et al., who demonstrated a normal GH binding affinity and a molecular weight similar to that of normal controls (21). Analysis of GHBP characteristics in our patient would be expected to produce similar results and was, thus, not performed.

It is of interest that although the truncated mutant GHR is not able to signal, the patient had detectable IGF1 levels, albeit very low, especially in relation to the extremely elevated GH levels. The production of small amounts of IGF1 in patients with exon 8-lacking GHR has also been documented by other authors (22). In fact, splice defects may not always be 100% efficient in causing aberrant splicing (24-26), and very low amounts of wild-type GHR may be produced and could be responsible for the low IGF1 levels seen in our patient.

The patient's parents, heterozygous carriers of the polypyrimidine tract defect, are likely to express the mutant GHR. Although no mRNA was available from the parents of our patient, other authors have demonstrated the presence of mRNA for the exon 8-lacking mutant receptor in heterozygous carriers of exon 8 splice mutations (21). The polypyrimidine tract defect did not cause short stature or Laron features in heterozygosity, as was true for other exon 8-skipping mutations (23). However, elevated GHBP levels have been described in heterozygous carriers (23) and may be present in the parents of our patient, but could not be demonstrated as blood was not available.

GHR exon 8 skipping was observed in the presence of the wild-type polypyrimidine tract in both in vitro and cellular studies. It could be postulated that the GHR exon 8 splice site is constitutively weak, and that the shortening of its polypyrimidine tract, as in the presence of the novel T to A nucleotide change, favours its skipping.

In conclusion, we have described a novel rare cause of GHI resulting from the alteration of the GHR polypyrimidine tract. This nucleotide change, located outside the invariant splice site, was not predicted to abolish GHR splicing in silico, but was clearly shown in vitro to induce skipping of GHR exon 8. This strengthens the concept that the search for gene mutations should include careful analysis of non-coding sequences and, in particular, of intronic splice elements.
