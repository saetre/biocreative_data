A genomic clone containing sequences of five feather keratin genes has been isolated using cDNA to chicken embryonic feather keratin mRNA as a probe. The clone probably represents part of a longer cluster of tandemly spaced genes; the genes are evenly spaced with a centre to centre separations of 3.3 kb and are transcribed from the same DNA strand, suggesting that the cluster has arisen by a series of tandem duplications. The organisation and complete sequence of the central gene has been determined. The protein encoded by the gene contains 97 amino acids and its sequence is typical of proteins of the embryonic and adult feather family. The transcript from the gene has been deduced to contain a long 3' non-coding region of 435 nucleotides and a 58 base 5' non-coding region interrupted in the gene 21 bases prior to the initiation codon by the gene's only intron of 324 bases.
