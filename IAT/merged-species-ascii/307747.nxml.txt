We report the isolation of xONR1, a novel member of the nuclear receptor superfamily from Xenopus laevis. xONR1 shares a high degree of amino acid sequence identity with the mammalian receptor for 1 alpha, 25-dihydroxy vitamin D3, particularly within the DNA-binding domain, although it does not bind this ligand. xONR1 DNA binding is stimulated by association with retinoid X receptor gamma (RXR gamma).
