We describe the first polyA-containing processed pseudogene reported in the chicken. It includes a 0.52 kb open reading frame which could encode a 175 amino acid protein. The putative protein shows extensive homology to the ras oncogene superfamily, being most closely related to the yeast protein YP2. It is one of the two most divergent members of the ras superfamily yet described and is the most homologous of any ras-related protein to the G-protein alpha-transducin. The chicken genome contains at least one other gene highly homologous to CPS1; at least one member of the CPS1 family is active, but only early in chicken development. This pattern of expression, and the presence of mutations in regions known to activate human c-ras genes to oncogenicity, suggest that CPS1 may represent a new oncogene family.
