By three different lines of evidence there are approximately 20 copies of actin genes in the human genome. Firstly, the rate of hybridisation of a mouse actin probe to human DNA indicates that there are a minimum of 20 complementary copies of the actin sequence per genome. Secondly, this probe hybridises to 17-20 bands in Southern blots of restriction enzyme digests of total human DNA. Most of these bands hybridise with both 3' and 5' fragments of the cDNA and are therefore likely to contain the entire gene sequence. Thirdly, we have picked 12 actin recombinants from a genomic library, and at the level of restriction enzymes mapping these represent nine different genes. Probability calculations indicate that these recombinants were picked from a pool of at least 20 different genes.
