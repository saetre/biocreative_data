A cDNA clone coding for a sea urchin histone H2A variant has been isolated. The coding region of the clone has been sequenced and the sequence found to be closely related to the H2A.F sequence in chickens. The nucleotide sequence of the sea urchin H2A.F/Z is 74% conserved when compared to chicken H2A.F and 51% conserved compared to sea urchin H2A early and 60% compared to sea urchin H2A late. The nucleotide-derived amino acid comparisons show that H2A.F/Z is 97% homologous with H2A.F in chickens and 57% and 56% homologous when compared to sea urchin H2A early and late respectively. There are between 3-6 copies of the H2A.F/Z sequence in the S. purpuratus genome. The H2A.F/Z gene sequence codes for the previously identified H2A.Z protein. All embryonic stages and adult tissues tested contain mRNA for H2A.F/Z. The mRNA appears in the poly A+ RNA fraction after chromatography over oligo dT cellulose.
