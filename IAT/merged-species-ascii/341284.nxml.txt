In Escherichia coli some 19 transcription units encoding the 52 ribosomal proteins are scattered throughout the genome. One of the units, the alpha operon, encodes genes for the ribosomal proteins S13, S11, S4 and L17 as well as the alpha subunit of RNA polymerase. We report here the complete 3.0 kb nucleotide sequence of the alpha operon. In addition, we have determined by S1 nuclease mapping the site of transcription termination in this operon.
