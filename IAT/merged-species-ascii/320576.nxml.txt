The DNA sequence of the gene rpsA as well as of its neighboring regions has been determined using the dideoxyribonucleotide method. It was found that there is an "open-reading-frame" of 350 bp which precedes the gene rpsA. Furthermore, an extensive internal repeats of nucleotide sequence have been found in this gene.
