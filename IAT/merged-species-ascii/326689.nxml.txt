Complete double-stranded DNA copies of the RNA genes of the human influenza virus A/PR/8/34 have been synthesized by using two synthetic oligodeoxynucleotide primers. The gene encoding the non-structural proteins NS1 and NS2, prepared with these primers, has been cloned into the bacteriophage M13mp7 and sequenced. The sequence is compared with that from another human strain and from an avian strain.
