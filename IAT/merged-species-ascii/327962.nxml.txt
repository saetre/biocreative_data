The RNA binding capacity of 50S proteins from E. coli ribosomes has been tested under improved conditions; purified proteins active in reconstitution assays were used, and the binding was studied under the conditions of the total reconstitution procedure for the 50S subunit. The results are: 1) Interaction of 23S RNA was found with 17 proteins, namely L1, L2, L3, L4, L7/L12, L9, L10, L11, L15, L16, L17, L18, L20, L22, L23, L24 and L29. 2) The proteins L1, L2, L3, L4, L9, L23 and L24 bound to 23S RNA at a level of about one copy per RNA molecule, whereas L20 could bind more than one copy (no saturation was observed at 1.8 copies per 23S RNA), and the other proteins bound 0.2--0.6 copies per RNA. 3) L1, L3, L7/L12 showed a slight binding to 16S RNA, L26 (identical with S20) strong binding to 16S RNA. 4) The binding of L2, L7/L12, L10, L11, L15, L16 and L18 was preparation sensitive, i.e. the binding ability changed notably from preparation to preparation. 5) All proteins bound equally well to 23S RNA in presence of 4 and 20 mM Mg2+, respectively, except L2, L3, L4, L7/L12, L9, L10, L15, L16 and L18, which bound less strongly at 20 mM than at 4 mM Mg2+.
