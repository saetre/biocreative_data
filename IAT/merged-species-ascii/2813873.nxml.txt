Secondary bone marrow (BM) myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) are increasingly common, as a result of radio or chemotherapy administered to a majority of cancer patients. Patients with secondary MDS have increased BM cell apoptosis, which results in BM dysfunction (cytopenias), and an increased risk of developing fatal acute leukemias. In the present study we asked whether TNF-alpha, known to regulate cell apoptosis, could modulate the onset of secondary MDS.

We show that TNF-alpha is induced by irradiation and regulates BM cells apoptosis in vitro and in vivo. In contrast to irradiated wild type (WT) mice, TNF-alpha deficient (TNF-alpha KO) mice or WT mice treated with a TNF-alpha-neutralizing antibody were partially protected from the apoptotic effects of irradiation. Next we established a 3-cycle irradiation protocol, in which mice were sub-lethally irradiated once monthly over a 3 month period. In this model, irradiated WT mice presented loss of microsatellite markers on BM cells, low white blood cell (WBC) counts, reduced megakaryocyte (MK) and platelet levels (thrombocytopenia) and macrocytic anemia, phenoypes that suggest the irradiation protocol resulted in BM dysfunction with clinical features of MDS. In contrast, TNF-alpha KO mice were protected from the irradiation effects: BM cell apoptosis following irradiation was significantly reduced, concomitant with sustained BM MK numbers and absence of other cytopenias. Moreover, irradiated WT mice with long term (>/=5 months) BM dysfunction had increased BM angiogenesis, MMPs and VEGF and NFkB p65, suggestive of disease progression.

Tumour Necrosis Factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) is a pro-inflammatory cytokine secreted by activated macrophages and T lymphocytes, but also by keratinocytes and fibroblasts [reviewed in 1]. Its role in inflammatory processes is based both on tissue destruction and subsequent recovery of tissue homeostasis [2]. However, its role in carcinogenesis is more controversial, since it can selectively cause apoptosis of tumour endothelial cells via a caspase cascade [reviewed in 3], but can also promote tumour growth and metastasis, probably via nuclear factor NF-kappaB activation [2; reviewed in 1]. The link between chronic inflammation and cancer is well demonstrated in the TNF-alpha-deficient mice model, which is resistant to skin carcinogenesis. Conversely, the presence of TNF-alpha on wild-type (WT) animals increased their susceptibility to tumour promotion [4]. TNF-alpha deficiency was associated with reduced MMP9 expression, which correlated with reduced keratinocyte migration, limiting skin tumour development [5]. In addition, several studies have shown a role for TNF-alpha-induced MMPs in tumour progression and invasiveness [6]-[8].

TNF-alpha has also been implicated in BM diseases such as Fanconi anemia [9], [10], aplastic anemia [11], [12] or myelodisplasic syndromes (MDS). Bone marrow failure in MDS involves apoptosis induction, which may involve TNF-alpha [13]; persistent BM dysplasia following benzene exposure has also been associated with TNF-alpha polymorphisms [14]. Nevertheless, the therapeutic efficacy of anti-TNF-alpha approaches, tested in patients with de novo, or primary, MDS, has been relatively modest [15]-[17].

Despite some evidence pointing for a putative role of TNF-alpha in regulating BM disease onset, studies exploiting its involvement in secondary (irradiation-induced) BM failure/MDS are lacking, and were the subject of the present study. Patients with secondary MDS (which develop following chemotherapy or radiotherapy for other cancers) have worse prognosis than primary MDS [18], and as such it represents a serious complication of cancer treatments. The data shown in this report identify TNF-alpha as a key cytokine in the BM microenvironment, important for cell apoptosis, sensitivity to irradiation, BM dysfunction and secondary MDS onset and progression. Anti-TNF strategies may be beneficial for the treatment of subsets of patients with BM dysfunction/secondary MDS.

We reasoned an increase in BM TNF-alpha might correlate with BM cell apoptosis induced by irradiation. To test this hypothesis, we analysed the effects of sub-lethal irradiation in BM cell turnover over a 3 day (72 h) period ("short-term irradiation effect"). As shown in Figure 1A, BM CD11b+ (myeloid) and Sca1+ (haematopoietic precursors) cell apoptosis increases in the initial 18 hours following irradiation, decreasing to control (non-irradiated) levels by 72 hours. As determined by RQ-PCR, the BM levels of TNF-alpha show a similar trend, increasing in the initial 18 hours and returning to control levels after 72 hours (Figure 1B).

A. Flow cytometry analysis of WT mouse BM cells shows a rapid increase in CD11b+ and Sca1+ cells apoptosis 6-12 hours after sub-lethal irradiation, returning to normal levels after 72 hrs. B. TNF-alpha quantification by RQ-PCR on the same samples indicates a rapid increase in TNF-alpha mRNA after irradiation. The results shown were obtained from 8 independent experiments using 6 animals per time point.

Next we tried to find a causal relationship between the increase in TNF-alpha levels and the incidence in BM cell apoptosis following irradiation. For this purpose, we irradiated whole BM mononuclear cells and BM stromal cells in vitro, and measured the levels of TNF-alpha released into the culture supernatants by ELISA. As shown in Figure 2A, irradiation induces TNF-alpha production by whole BM and BM stroma.

Next, we hypothesized that TNF-alpha might be responsible for the incidence in BM cell apoptosis, and thus neutralizing its activity might exert a protective effect. Therefore, we exposed subsets of BM cells to the supernatants described earlier, and tested the protective effects of adding a TNF-alpha neutralizing antibody. As shown in Figure 2B, cells treated with supernatants obtained from irradiated BM cells show a significantly higher apoptotic index than those treated with the TNF-alpha neutralizing antibody and exposed to the same supernatants. (p<0.05 for Sca1+ and CD11b+ cells). These experiments suggest that TNF-alpha released into culture supernatants of irradiated BM cells induces BM cell apoptosis in vitro. Nevertheless, we cannot exclude other undisclosed factor(s) may also promote BM cell apoptosis in response to the irradiation stimulus.

To test the importance of TNF-alpha in BM apoptosis following irradiation in vivo, we compared the "short term irradiation effects" in wild type (WT) and TNF-alpha deficient (KO) mice BM content. As shown in Figure 3A, as a result of cell apoptosis, the BM cell number decreases significantly 3 days after sub-lethal irradiation, returning to control levels by 7 days. In accordance with the in vitro results, irradiated TNF-alpha KO mice were partially resistant to the apoptotic effects of irradiation (the number of BM cells is significantly higher in TNF-alpha KO mice BM 3 days after irradiation, p<0.05).

A. WT and TNF-alpha KO mice were sub-lethally irradiated and the total number of BM cells was counted as explained in Methods. As shown, TNF-alpha KO mice were more resistant to the apoptotic effects of irradiation.

The results shown were obtained from two independent experiments, using 12 animals per experimental group and 3 animals per time point. *: p<0.05. B. WT mice were injected with PBS (control) or with antibody anti-TNFalpha prior to sub-lethal irradiation and total BM cells were counted.

To overcome possible differences between the BM microenvironment of TNF-alpha KO and WT mice, we also tested the effects of irradiation in the BM content of WT mice treated with anti-TNF-alpha Ab. In Figure 3B, a marked decrease in BM cell numbers (higly significant: p<0.02) was observed in untreated (control) mice 24 hours after irradiation, comparing with Ab-treated animals. In parallel with these results, flow cytometry analysis for apoptotic cells showed that the number of Sca1/Annexin V- and CD11b/Annexin V-positive cells is significantly higher (p<0.01) in control mice in comparison with anti-TNF-alpha treated mice, confirming the apoptotic effect of TNF-alpha in both precursor and mature BM cells (Figure 3C). For the other time-points, also a minor protection from irradiation-induced apoptosis is observed in anti-TNF-alpha treated mice (data not shown).

Taken together, these experiments suggest irradiation induces TNF-alpha production in the BM, and that the released TNF-alpha is partially responsible for the increase in BM cell apoptosis following irradiation.

Next, we developed a 3-cycle irradiation protocol (to test the "long term effects of irradiation"), and characterized its effects in inducing BM dysfunction. First, we showed the irradiation protocol induces loss of microsatellite markers by BM cells, suggesting it had carcinogenic/transforming capacity (Supplementary Figure S1). Concerning the haematological phenotype induced by the irradiation protocol, as shown in Fig 4, three months after the last irradiation, 3x irradiated mice showed a significant decrease in circulating white blood cells (WBC), platelets and red blood cells (RBC). In addition, 3x irradiated mice showed a significant increase in MCH-pg Hemoglobin per RBC (Figure 4D), a phenotype usually seen in macrocytic anemia. Taken together, the concomitant clinical presentation of cytopenias, thrombocytopenia and anemia, and the incidence of cytogenetic abnormalities in 3x irradiated mice, strongly suggests this may be considered a model of BM dysfunction with clinical features of secondary MDS.

Having shown TNF-alpha was involved in the regulation of BM apoptosis following short-term irradiation, next we tested the importance of TNF-alpha in our irradiation-induced model of BM dysfunction/secondary MDS. As shown in Figure 5A and B, BM cell apoptosis increased in 3x irradiated WT mice, but was significantly reduced in 3x irradiated TNF-alpha KO (p<0.05). Similarly, the number of MK in BM of 3x irradiated WT mice decreased significantly (correlating with the reduction in platelet levels, Figure 4), but was sustained in 3x irradiated TNF-alpha KO mice (Fig. 6A, B; the difference in the number of BM MK is significant, p<0.05). Circulating WBC and RBC were also higher in 3x irradiated TNF-alpha KO compared to 3x irradiated WT mice (data not shown). Taken together, these data suggest that TNF-alpha KO mice are resistant to the effects of long-term irradiation. While irradiated WT mice develop BM dysfunction with clinical features of MDS, irradiated TNF-alpha KO mice have sustained BM cell numbers, including MK and unchanged haematological parameters.

MDS patients are at a higher risk of developing secondary acute leukemias [19]. In our model of irradiation-induced BM dysfunction/secondary MDS, a proportion (40%) of 3x irradiated WT mice succumb approximately 6-8 months after the last irradiation (data not shown). We characterized the BM of mice that presented an MDS-like phenotype beyond 5 months after the last irradiation, and compared it to control (non-irradiated) WT and TNF-alpha KO mice BM. As shown in Figure 7A, 3x irradiated WT mice had increased BM microvessel density (more and dilated vessels), indicative of increased angiogenesis. In contrast, TNF-alpha KO BM had significantly less microvessel density, as shown by the expression and quantification of basement membrane markers laminin and collagen IV (Figure 7B, p<0.05). The BM of 3xirradiated mice also presented increased MMP-2 and MMP-9 (Figure 8A), VEGF and NFkB p65 expression (Figure 8B), while in control WT or TNF-alpha KO mice these parameters remain unchanged. In addition, ex-vivo TNF-alpha treatment of isolated BM cells induced VEGF production (data not shown). Taken together, these data suggest that in 3xirradiated mice sustained BM TNF-alpha levels induce MMP activity, VEGF production/release and NFkB expression, thereby promoting disease progression.

A. Whole BM extracts obtained from control or irradiated WT and TNF-alpha KO mice were analysed by zymography. As shown by the classical MMP pattern seen in zymograms, MMP-9, MMP-2 and MMP-7 could be detected in BM extracts from all the mice. However, in irradiated WT mice (with prolonged MDS) the levels of MMP-9, MMP-2 and active MMP-2 and MMP-7 increased significantly. These results are representative of 3 mice per experimental group. B. Whole BM extracts were obtained from control or irradiated WT and TNF-alpha KO mice and analysed by western blotting. The results show a dramatic increase in NFkB p65 and in VEGF levels in BM extracts from irradiated WT mice with prolonged MDS, while in BM extracts from TNF-alpha deficient mice these parameters remain unchanged. These results are representative of 3 mice per experimental group.

In the present report we exploited the possibility that irradiation, known to induce BM malignant transformation, namely secondary acute myeloid leukemias [20] and MDS [21], might act as an inducer of TNF-alpha in the BM microenvironment, and studied the consequences of such an increase in the incidence of BM cell apoptosis and subsequent onset of BM dysfunction.

First, we observed that the effects of whole body "short term irradiation", resulting in BM cell turnover and subsequent recovery, correlated with the levels of BM TNF-alpha. Moreover, in vitro exposure to supernatants from irradiated BM stroma, treated or untreated with a neutralizing antibody to TNF-alpha, demonstrated the TNF-alpha released in response to irradiation is partially responsible for BM cell apoptosis induction. Other studies have highlighted the role of TNF-alpha signalling in hematopoietic progenitor turnover in vitro[22]-[24]. Accordingly, we demonstrate in vivo thatWT mice treated with anti-TNF-alpha Ab as well TNF-alpha deficient mice were more resistant to irradiation-induced BM cell turnover than non-treated WT mice. Irradiation-induced production of TNF-alpha have also been reported in other systems like lung [25], [26], brain [27] and epidermis [28], [29] and related with malignant transformation.

We developed a model of BM dysfunction induced by prolonged (long-term) irradiation exposure, to study the importance of BM TNF-alpha in this setting. Our aim was to establish a reproducible and clinically relevant model of BM dysfunction that resembled secondary (that is, resulting from therapy) MDS. It has been known for several years, that dogs chronically exposed to low daily doses of whole-body gamma-radiation are prone to develop hematologic changes consistent with a myeloproliferative disorder [30], [31]. In our 3-cycle irradiation model (3x irradiation), 40-50% of WT mice presented low WBC, anemia and thrombocytopenia, and elevated MCH-Hemoglobin per RBC (indicative of macrocytic anemia). These clinical features, together with the incidence of cytogenetic abnormalities (which in our in vivo model involved the loss of microsatelite markers in chromosome 2) are strong indications of an MDS-like phenotype [19]. TNF-alpha KO mice subjected to the same irradiation protocol did not develop BM dysfunction; cell apoptosis in TNF-alpha KO mice BM was significantly reduced, resulting in sustained hematopoietic precursor and mature cell levels, including MK. Besides the maintenance in MK/platelet levels, the circulating WBC and RBC in 3x irradiated TNF-alpha KO mice were also similar to control (non-irradiated) mice (data not shown). Taken together, these data strongly suggest that TNF-alpha KO mice are resistant to irradiation-induced BM dysfunction.

WT mice with sustained MDS-like symptoms beyond 5 months after the last irradiation had increased BM angiogenesis, as determined by quantification of laminin staining in BM sections and also by quantification of collagen IV and laminin in whole BM extracts (since laminin and collagen IV are components of the vessels basement membranes), suggestive of disease progression. The BM of 3x irradiated WT mice also showed increased MMP activity, increased VEGF and NFkB p65, in contrast to the BM of 3x irradiated TNF-alpha KO mice, where these parameters were unchanged. TNF-alpha is an important modulator of MMP activity, namely gelatinaseB/MMP9 [32], [33] which is crucial for extracellular matrix remodelling and has also been shown to play a pivotal role in BM recovery following myelosuppression [34]. We determined the levels of MMP released by irradiated BM stroma in the presence or absence of a TNF-alpha neutralizing antibody in vitro. Under these conditions, MMP-9 activity in culture supernatants was diminished in the presence of the TNF-alpha antibody (data not shown) suggesting TNF-alpha release from the irradiated stroma induces a rapid MMP release.

Therefore, besides inducing cell apoptosis, overproduction of TNF-alpha in the BM microenvironment following irradiation, may induce MMP-9 and possibly other undisclosed factors, contributing towards degradation of the endothelial basement membrane and release of pro-angiogenic factors such as VEGF, which in turn may promote angiogenesis. Moreover, our data also shows that TNF-alpha stimulates VEGF production and release from different BM cells, in particular MK. Concerning the involvement of NFkB, TNF-alpha has been shown to exert some of its effects via NF-kB [35], [36] The increase in NFkB p65 in 3x irradiated mice suggests this may be a molecular event involved in BM dysfunction and possibly progression to an MDS-like phenotype with increased likelihood of developing acute leukemia.

Our recent unpublished data suggested that MK are major producers of ECM molecules in the BM microenvironment (manuscript in preparation) namely fibronectin, suggesting their survival, observed in TNF-alpha KO mice, and the resistance of TNF-alpha KO mice to the effects of irradiation, may involve the production (maintenance) of such ECM molecules in the BM microenvironment. Lack of integrin alpha4 (which, among other functions is a receptor for fibronectin) has been shown to restrict stem-cell BM repopulating capacity and to limit BM stem cells self-renewal [37].

Two recent elegant studies demonstrated unequivocally that the interaction between hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) and the BM microenvironment is strictly regulated by Rb and retinoic acid receptor signalling [38], [39]. In both situations, the absence of such proteins resulted in the development of myeloproliferative diseases; interestingly, in the case of retinoid acid deficiency, transplanting total BM from TNF-alpha KO into retinoic acid receptor deficient mice protected these from myeloproliferative disease. The authors concluded that TNF-alpha is one of the mechanisms involved in BM malignant transformation, particularly in the case of myeloproliferative disease. The data shown in our present report demonstrates that TNF-alpha regulates BM cell turnover (apoptosis) induced by irradiation, conditioning the onset of BM dysfunction and secondary MDS-like phenotypes; moreover, our data also highlight a role for TNF-alpha in modelling the BM microenvironment, contributing towards the progression of secondary MDS.

Strategies to block TNF-alpha activity, seeking to neutralize its inflammatory role, have met some success in the treatment of epithelial cancers, and to a lesser extent also in subsets of patients with primary MDS, although with varying degrees of therapeutic benefit [15]-[17], [40]. The fact that TNF-alpha is a key regulator of BM cell apoptosis provided the rationale for the use of TNF-alpha blockers in primary MDS. Anti-cytokine therapy (amifostine or pentoxifylline and ciprofloxacin with or without dexamethasone) have been administered to primary MDS patients and the ones with high BM TNF-alpha levels have a better chance of responding to such therapy [41], [42]. Interestingly, in the reported trials patients with secondary MDS were excluded. The present report shows the apoptotic effects of TNF-alpha may be crucial for BM dysfunction and the onset of secondary MDS; moreover, since TNF-alpha (directly or indirectly) regulates ECM turnover and angiogenesis (as shown in our present study), it may also promote secondary MDS progression.

Taken together, we suggest that BM TNF-alpha is a critical factor in the onset and subsequent progression of irradiation-induced BM dysfunction with clinical features of secondary MDS (shown in vitro and in vivo), and as such, strategies designed to block the effects of TNF-alpha in the BM microenvironment may be an attractive option to treat patients with secondary MDS.

Ten week-old TNF-alpha KO and WT mice were irradiated sub-lethally monthly over a three month period (3x irradiation). Haematological parameters (white blood cells, red blood cells, platelet levels) from irradiated and control mice were determined 7 days after each irradiation and 3-6 months after the last irradiation. Peripheral blood was collected from the cheek pouch in EDTA-coated tubes (Multivette 600, Sarstedt, Numbrecht, Germany) and analyzed with a Hemavet 950FS cell counter (Drew Scientific, Oxford, CT, USA). Apoptotic cells in frozen and paraffin-embedded BM sections, obtained from mice sacrificed at the same time-points defined above, were detected by transferase-mediated dUTP nick-end labeling (TUNEL) assay. We used the in Situ Cell Death Detection Kit, POD and DAB Substrate Kits (Roche), following the manufacturer's instructions. The percentage of apoptotic cells was determined by counting stained (TUNEL positive) nuclei in a total of six high power fields (200x magnification) per condition. These quantifications were done in triplicate (3 independent counts/BM section).

For all experimental procedures, serum was removed from the cultures. To determine whether irradiation induced TNF-alpha from BM cells, and whether this induced TNF-alpha leads to BM cell apoptosis, these BM mononucleated cells were irradiated with 1200 cGy; some of them were previously incubated with anti-mouse TNF-alpha/TNFSF1A antibody (R&D Systems), at a concentration of 0.06 microg/mL. Twenty four hours after irradiation, supernatants were collected and added to new BM mononuclear cell cultures which were incubated or not with the anti-mouse TNF-alpha/TNFSF1A antibody and irradiated (1200 rad) or not (controls) on the following day. At the end of the experiment, the incidence of apoptosis in BM cells submitted to different conditions was determined by flow cytometry (see above).
