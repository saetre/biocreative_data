Several deletion variants of E. coli 5S RNA have been constructed and produced either in vivo or in vitro using T7 RNA Polymerase. Their structures and ribosomal protein L18 binding properties have been examined. All of them are similar to wild-type 5S RNA in their helix II-III regions, where L18 binds [Huber, P.W. and Wool, I.G. (1984) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. (USA) 81, 322-326; Douthwaite, S., Christensen, A., and Garrett, R.A. (1982) Biochemistry 21, 2313-2320.], by NMR criteria. However, none of the molecules examined that lack the helix IV-helix V stem bind L18 efficiently, even though that portion of 5S RNA is outside the L18 footprint. The L18 binding site is clearly more than a simple hairpin loop.
