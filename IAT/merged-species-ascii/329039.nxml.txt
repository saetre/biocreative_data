The tyrT operon of E. coli and several other tRNA operons of E. coli show striking structural features: they contain repeated sequence units including a 19bp motif resembling the 3' end of the corresponding mature tRNA. A novel RNA, encoded by the repeated sequence of the tyrT operon, was identified. The RNA, characterized by primer extension and Nuclease-S1 analysis, contained 171 nucleotides and terminated with the 19bp motif of the CCA-end of tRNA(1Tyr). The RNA, designated as rtT RNA, is probably released from the primary transcript of tyrT during tRNA processing, it includes the coding capacity for the arginine rich peptide Tpr. Predictions of secondary folding resulted a rather stable RNA structure with a free energy of -44.3kcal/mol. A weak ribosome binding site was found, preceding the second possible AUG initiator codon for Tpr. The comparison of rtT RNA with putative transcripts from the repeated sequences associated with related tRNA genes showed common features with respect to primary structure, arrangement and secondary folding. In E. coli cultures the lag-phase during growth, caused by transient glycine or by isoleucine limitation, was found to be overcome or markedly shortened in the presence of rtT RNA. These and previously reported results suggest a modulatory effect of rtT RNA on stringent response.
