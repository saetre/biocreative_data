The study used 20 Nogo-A/B/C knockout mice in the experimental group, and 20 C57BL/6 mice in the control group. Partial ON injury was induced by using a specially designed ON clip to pinch the ON 1 mm behind the mouse eyeball with 40 g pressure for 9 s. The left ON was injured in both groups, but the right ON was left untouched in the control group. Nogo-A/B/C mRNA was studied by in situ hybridization in both groups. GAP-43 was studied by immunofluorescence staining on frozen sections. RGCs were purified and cultured in DMEM medium containing B-27. Cells were then immunostained with both Thy1.1 and GAP-43 antibodies. The axonal growth of RGCs was calculated by a computerized image analyzer.

Introduction
###end title 11
###begin p 12
Glaucoma and optic nerve (ON) trauma may lead to optic nerve injury. It is widely known that central nervous system (CNS) neurons fail to regenerate after injury. This question has attracted intense investigation at both the preclinical and clinical levels. Regeneration failure has been attributed in part to proteins associated with CNS myelin and the scar that forms at an injury site. Furthermore, an ON trauma model can also be used as experimental research model to study CNS injury.

Nogo-A, Nogo-B, and Nogo-C are major protein species in oligodendrocytes and expressed in ON [1]. Among them, Nogo-A is the principal protein that prevents axonal outgrowth. A 66-amino loop structure located between two transmembrane domains named Nogo-66, which is common to all Nogo forms, is the main contributor to this inhibitory effect. Nogo-66 is expressed on the surface of oligodendrocytes [2] and functions by binding to an axonal Nogo-66 receptor (NgR) [3]. Nogo-66 is somewhat "fastidious" as regards to which environment it will express, as it is expressed in the myelin of a sciatic nerve transplant to the CNS but not in those to the peripheral nervous system (PNS). This feature, together with its in vitro activities, has confirmed Nogo-66 as a myelin-derived inhibitor to the axonal regeneration after injury.

A Nogo-targeted embryonic stem cell clone was identified from the Omnibank sequence Tag database. Omnibank mutations were created, using insertional mutagenesis based on retroviral-based gene trap methodology. Heterozygotic mice harboring the disrupted allele were bred to C57Bl/6 mice for expansion in our animal housing facility and intercrossed to maintain the Nogo-A/B/C mutation on a hybrid 129SvEvBrd_C57Bl/6 background. The heterozygotic mice (9 or 12-week-old) were donated by Professor Xiulan Xu. The mice were raised in the laminar air flow cage rack (Suzhou Experimental Equipment Company, Suzhou, China). In the present study, animals were backcrossed to C57Bl/6 for three to six generations, and 7-14-week-old Nogo-A/B/C-/-/- littermates were used as controls for all experiments. The present investigation adhered to the principles regarding the care and use of animals according to the American Physiologic Society, the Society for Neuroscience, and the ARVO Statement for the use of animals in ophthalmic and vision research.

Surgical procedure
###end title 24
###begin p 25
Prior to ON crush, general anesthesia was induced in each animal with an intraperitoneal injection of 1% sodium pentobarbital solution (50 mg/kg bodyweight). A surgical microscope was used to visualize the ON, which was exposed through a superior temporal approach. A 1-1.5 cm incision was made in the skin above the right orbit. The dural sheath of the ON was opened longitudinally, from which the ON was then gently detached before it was crushed at 1 mm distal to the eyeball by an ON forceps with 40 g pressure for 9 s. Injury to the ophthalmic artery was carefully avoided during the procedure. Nerve injury was verified by the appearance of a clearing at the crush site; the vascular integrity of the retina was verified by funduscopic examination after dilating the pupil with atropine. The left ON was crushed in both groups, but the right ON was left untouched in the control group.

Seven days after ON crush, thoracotomy was performed. The animals were perfused through the heart with heparin saline followed by 4% paraformaldehyde, including diethypyrocarbonate (DEPC) for in situ hybridization. Eyes with ON segments up to the optic chiasm were postfixed overnight, and transferred to a 30% sucrose solution overnight (4 degreesC) and including DEPC for in situ hybridization overnight (4 degreesC). Frozen sections (15 mum) were cut longitudinally on a cryostat, thaw mounted onto coated glass slides, and stored at -80 degreesC until further use.

Cryostat sections (15 mum) were mounted on Superfrost-Plus slides. Sections were post-fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde and PBS, acetylated in 0.1 M triethanolamine and 0.25% acetic anhydride, and permeabilized for 20 min in 1% Triton X-100 and PBS. Hybridization was performed overnight in 5x300 mM NaCl, 30 mM sodium citrate, pH 7.0 (SSC) buffer containing 50% formamide and 2% blocking reagent at 68 degreesC. Two rigorous washes were performed in 0.2X SSC at the same temperature for 1 h, and signals were detected with alkaline phosphatase-coupled anti-digoxigenin antibodies using spreptavidin-biotin-peroxidase complex (SABC) as color reaction substrates.

RGCs from the retina were isolated and purified as previously described [6,7]. Briefly, the retinal tissue was dissociated into single cells in Eagle's minimum essential medium that contained 15 U/ml papain and 70 U/ml collagenase. The cell suspension was incubated successively in a polypropylene tube coated with a monoclonal anti-rat macrophage IgG to remove macrophages, and then in another one coated with a monoclonal anti-rat Thy 1.1 IgG. Finally, the tube was gently washed five times with PBS. RGCs were collected by centrifugation at 700xg for 5 min and then cultured at a concentration of 6x106 cells/ml in DMEM that contained 100 U/ml penicillin, 100 mug/ml gentamicin, and B-27. Cells were then seeded into poly-lysine coated 24-well plates and incubated at 37 degreesC with 5% CO2 ventilation. Half of the medium was renewed with cytarbine (20 mug/ml) added at certain intervals. Cells were examined daily under phase-contrast microscope.

Axonal length was calculated using image analysis software. The images were taken using a digital camera mounted on a microscope. For neurite length determinations, the neurites were traced and the morphometry analysis was performed using Image-Pro Plus version 4.0 (Media Cybernetics, Silver Spring, MD). The length of the axon was defined as the distance from the soma to the tip of the process. An average of 50 neurons from each group was selected from a number of chamber slides. The difference in axonal length of the experimental group (Nogo-A/B/C knockout mice) increased from the first day to the seventh day after crush. The axonal length of the control group (C57BL/6 control mice) increased from the first day to the third day, then decreased from the third day to the seventh day. The difference in axonal length between the experimental group (Nogo-A/B/C knockout mice) and the control group (C57BL/6 control mice) was not significant (p>0.05) on the first postoperative day. However, the difference in axonal length became obvious by the third and seventh days between the experimental and control groups. (p<0.01; Table 2).

The difference in axonal length between experimental group (Nogo-A/B/C knockout mice) increased from the first day to seventh day after crush. The axonal length of control group (C57BL/6 control mice) increased from the first day to third day, then descreased from the third day to seventh day. The difference in axonal length between experimental group (Nogo-A/B/C knockout mice) and control group (C57BL/6 control mice) was not significant (*p>0.05) on the first postoperative day. However, the difference in axonal length was significant by the third and seventh days between experimental group and control group.

The Nogo gene has been cloned and its product appears to be a new member of the reticulon family [12]. An extracellular segment composed of 66 amino acid residues between two transmembrane domains, known as Nogo-66, is the major functional domain of this protein [3].

A neutralizing monoclonal antibody, neurite outgrowth inhibitor 1 (IN-1), has recently been confirmed to target the N-terminal domain of Nogo-A encoded by exon 3 [13]. When IN-1 is applied to several CNS injury models, including spinal cord lesions and cortical lesions, there is notable neuroanatomical and behavioral recovery compared with controls [14]. These results suggest that the Nogo-NgR system is accountable for, to a large degree, the inhibitory activity that is responsible for the prevention of CNS axonal regeneration after injury.

There was a significant difference in the area of ON stained positive for GAP-43 between the experimental group(Nogo-A/B/C knockout mice) and the control group(C57BL/6 mice) in this study. Nogo is important inhibitor for regeneration after CNS injury. Knockout of Nogo-A/B/C gene can lead to regeneration after optic nerve injury in this study. The results indicate that Nogo-A/B/C plays an important role in the inhibition of axonal regeneration after ON injury.

The significant difference in the length of axons regenerated in vitro between the experimental and control groups on the third and seventh postoperative days suggests that Nogo-A/B/C elimination is effective in enhancing axonal regeneration of RGCs in at least in vitro experiments.

The analysis on mice with various degrees of gene disruption targeted at Nogo isoforms has been reported by three groups. Kim et al. [11] observed significant corticospinal tract fiber sprouting in young Nogo-A/B-/- mice compared with wild-type and Nogo-A/B+/- mice. Simonen et al. [15] noted moderate corticospinal tract fiber regeneration in Nogo-A-/- mice. However, Zheng et al. [16] saw no significant regeneration in either Nogo-A/B-/- line or Nogo-A/B/C-/- line mice above that of wild type. It is believed that the varying degrees of regenerative capacity after Nogo elimination can be attributed to the differences in genetic backgrounds of the mice used in the experiments [17].

Several myelin inhibitors of axonal growth, including Nogo-66, myelin-associated glycoprotein, and oligodendrocyte-myelin glycoprotein, exert their effects through NgR.
