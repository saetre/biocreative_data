We have isolated genomic clones from several members of the UV and TPA inducible human spr2 gene-family in order to analyse the regulation of these genes at a molecular level. From one of these members, the spr2-1 gene, we have identified and sequenced the regulatory region. By using CAT fusion plasmids and a liposome mediated transfection procedure we show that the isolated promoter region contains all the cis-elements necessary for induced expression after UV irradiation or phorbolester treatment of cultured human keratinocytes. Additionally the spr2-1 promoter is shown to be regulated aswell during the normal process of keratinocyte differentiation. This makes the spr2-1 promoter sequence an ideal tool to study the molecular mechanisms by which environmental agents such as UV radiation and chemical tumor promoters interfere with normal gene expression during cell proliferation and differentiation.
