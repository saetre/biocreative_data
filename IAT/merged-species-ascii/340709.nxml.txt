Using a Y specific probe (pY353/B) taken from a flow sorted mouse Y chromosome library we have identified a family of RNA transcripts encoded by the Y chromosome. These transcripts which are approximately 1.3 Kb in length are present in testis PolyA+ RNA but can not be detected in either male liver, spleen, kidney, brain, heart or lung tissues. Isolation and sequence analysis of a corresponding cDNA shows it to contain a potential coding sequence of 696bp. These data show that the Y chromosome is transcriptionally active in the adult mouse testis.
