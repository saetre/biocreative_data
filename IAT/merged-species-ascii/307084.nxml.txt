Sox-18 is a member of the Sox multi-gene family (Sry-related HMG-box gene). We have bacterially expressed this 378 amino acid protein and demonstrated sequence-specific binding to the Sox DNA-binding motif AACAAAG. A distinct 95 amino acid activation domain was mapped in Sox-18 using GAL4-Sox-18 fusions (amino acids 160-225). Furthermore, Sox-18 was capable of trans-activating gene expression through the AACAAA motif. Our results suggest that Sox-18 functions as a classical trans-activator of gene expression.
