T4 Species I RNA, a molecule 140 nucleotides in length with some structural features very much like a tRNA, is specifically cleaved by an enzymatic activity in Escherichia coli extracts to give three segments with 19, 48 and 73 nucleotides. We report the purification and characterization of the E. coli RNase which cleaves two 3' phosphodiester bonds of T4 Species I RNA. This reaction has many properties in common with those catalyzed by E. coli RNase III, although the optimal salt conditions for T4 Species I RNA cleavage differ significantly from those for other RNase III-catalyzed reactions. The reaction is not catalyzed by extracts from an E. coli strain lacking RNase III activity. Furthermore, T4 Species I RNA is cleaved by highly purified E. coli RNase III to yield the same three specific fragments. We conclude that this specific cleavage is due to the action of RNase III, and that the requirement for lower ionic strength may reveal further important properties about this RNA processing enzyme.
