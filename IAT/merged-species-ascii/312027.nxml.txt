The primary transcript of pnp, the gene encoding polynucleotide phosphorylase in Escherichia coli, is processed in the 5' end region by ribonuclease III (RNase III). The unprocessed transcript shows enhanced stability compared with the processed transcript. We report here that, unlike the processed transcript, the unprocessed pnp transcript did not accept endonucleolytic attack at, at least, five cleavage sites. Sequencing analysis of the four cleavage products shows no sequence specific to all these sites, but AU rich stretches were observed at three sites.
