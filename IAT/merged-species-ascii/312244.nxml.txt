Like other HOX genes the murine Hox-2.4 gene is thought to be involved in regional specification along the antero-posterior axis. In addition it has been reported to have oncogenic potential. We studied expression Hox-2.4 in murine EC cells and determined the transcription start site. Studies of DNA-protein interactions in the promoter region showed that the Hox-2.4 promoter contains a CCAAT box and a perfect octamer motif, which is capable of binding Oct-factors. Cotransfection of Oct expression vectors influences the transcriptional activity of the promoter, suggesting that the Oct-gene family may be involved in regulating HOX genes.
