The Escherichia coli exonuclease III (AP endonuclease VI) is a DNA-repair enzyme that hydrolyzes the phosphodiester bond 5' to an abasic site in DNA. To study how the enzyme recognizes the abasic site, we used oligonucleotides containing a synthetic abasic site at any desired position in the sequence. We prepared oligonucleotides containing an abasic residue such as 2'-deoxyribosylformamide, 2'-deoxyribose, 1',2'-dideoxy ribofuranose or propanediol. Duplex oligonucleotides containing an abasic residue used in this study were cleaved on the 5' side of the abasic site by exonuclease III in spite of the varieties of the bases opposite and adjacent to the abasic site. In addition, we observed that the enzyme cleaved single-stranded oligonucleotides containing an abasic site on the 5' side of the abasic site. These findings suggest that the enzyme may principally recognize the DNA-pocket formed at an abasic site. The indole ring of the tryptophan 212 residue of the exonuclease III is probably intercalated to the abasic site. The tryptophan in the vicinity of the catalytic site is conserved in the type II AP endonuclease from various organisms.
