The cell line G403.4.7, isolated as a spontaneous variant of the MPC-11 derived myeloma G403.4, produces a truncated gamma 2b HC protein, but no light chain (LC), and a single gamma 2b specific transcript of 2.4kb. This gamma 2b transcript consists of the VDJ and CH1 exons, the CH1 to Hinge (Hi) intervening sequence (IVS) and HI exon, part of the IVS between the two membrane exons M1 and M2, and most of the membrane 3' untranslated (UT) region. Even though the mature mRNA contains intronic sequences, it is abundant in the cytoplasm. Analysis of the gamma 2b genomic organization reveals that this unusual transcript results in part from two genomic deletions of 2.5kb and 588bp and in part from an altered splicing pattern. This altered splicing pattern is probably a consequence of the sequence alterations resulting from the genomic deletions. Analysis of these events provides some interesting insights into the mechanism of splice site selection and the evolution of introns and exons.
