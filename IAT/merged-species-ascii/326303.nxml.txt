The nucleotide sequence of 1100bp around the origin of replication of the pSC101 plasmid has been determined. This segment of DNA is capable of replication in the presence of a helper plasmid. The sequence data reveal similarities between pSC101 and several other replicons. The origin of replication contains three direct repeats of an 18bp sequence associated with a segment exceptionally rich in A-T base pairs. A promotor that probably directs transcription of a gene encoding an essential plasmid replication function is associated with a region of extensive potential secondary structure. The sequence presented here includes the sequence of the par region involved in partitioning of plasmids at cell division.
