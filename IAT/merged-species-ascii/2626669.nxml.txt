Aggregation of the high affinity IgE receptor (FcepsilonRI) activates a cascade of signaling events leading to mast cell activation. Subsequently, inhibitory signals are engaged for turning off activating signals. We identified that regulator of calcineurin (Rcan) 1 serves as a negative regulator for turning off FcepsilonRI-mediated mast cell activation. FcepsilonRI-induced Rcan1 expression was identified by suppression subtractive hybridization and verified by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction and Western blotting. Deficiency of Rcan1 led to increased calcineurin activity, increased nuclear factor of activated T cells and nuclear factor kappaB activation, increased cytokine production, and enhanced immunoglobulin E-mediated late-phase cutaneous reactions. Forced expression of Rcan1 in wild-type or Rcan1-deficient mast cells reduced FcepsilonRI-mediated cytokine production. Rcan1 deficiency also led to increased FcepsilonRI-mediated mast cell degranulation and enhanced passive cutaneous anaphylaxis. Analysis of the Rcan1 promoter identified a functional Egr1 binding site. Biochemical and genetic evidence suggested that Egr1 controls Rcan1 expression. Our results identified Rcan1 as a novel inhibitory signal in FcepsilonRI-induced mast cell activation and established a new link of Egr1 and Rcan1 in FcepsilonRI signaling.

Mast cells play a central role in IgE-dependent allergic diseases. Recently, mast cells have also been recognized as prominent immune effector cells. Mast cells constitutively express the high affinity IgE receptor (FcepsilonRI) on their surface (1). Aggregation of FcepsilonRI initiates a cascade of activating signaling events leading to the production of mast cell mediators. Activation signals are needed for the production and secretion of proinflammatory mediators. Activation signals are subsequently inhibited by negative signals that are required for mast cells to return to their basal resting condition (2). Thus, FcepsilonRI-mediated activation and subsequent inhibition are highly ordered, sequential molecular events. The nature of this negative signaling event after FcepsilonRI-mediated mast cell activation is the subject of this study.

FcepsilonRI consists of an IgE-binding alpha subunit, a signal-amplifying beta subunit, and two signal-initiating gamma subunits (3). FcepsilonRI-mediated activation events have been extensively studied. The widely accepted model is as follows: upon cross-linking of the FcepsilonRI, the Src family protein tyrosine kinases Lyn and Fyn are activated (3-5). Lyn phosphorylates tyrosine residues of the immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif in the beta and gamma subunits (3, 4). Syk is then recruited to the gamma subunit and activates a multitude of protein kinases. Fyn functions to phosphorylate Gab2, which is involved in FcepsilonRI-induced activation of phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase (PI3K) (5). Concerted actions of Lyn and Fyn activate several signaling pathways, including IkappaB-NF-kappaB, NFAT, mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs), and PI3K-Akt, leading to mast cell degranulation and production of inflammatory cytokines and lipid mediators (1, 3). Most of these signal events are enzymatic reactions and occur within seconds to minutes.

In addition to the immediate enzymatic activation of protein kinases, we recently demonstrated that Egr1-deficient mast cells showed impaired FcepsilonRI-induced TNF and IL-13 production (6). The de novo synthesis of the transcription factor Egr1 is required for the full responsiveness of mast cells in the production of cytokines in response to IgE stimulation (6). The promoter region of inflammatory cytokines such as TNF contains multiple transcription factor binding sites, including those for NF-kappaB, NFAT, and Egr1 (7, 8). Accordingly, the coordinated action of immediate enzymatic activation together with newly synthesized transcription factor Egr1 contributes to the magnitude of mast cell activation. As FcepsilonRI aggregation-induced Egr1 expression occurs from 15 min to 1 h after antigen stimulation, it appears that Egr1 contributes to the later phase of FcepsilonRI-mediated signals (6). Intriguingly, an opposing biological effect of Egr1, both the stimulatory and inhibitory effects on gene expression, has been reported (9-11). Such dual effects suggest that Egr1 may initiate both activation and inhibition signals.

Transcription factors NFAT and NF-kappaB regulate the transcription of multiple cytokines in mast cells. These transcription factors are sequestered in the cytoplasm under resting conditions and translocate to the nucleus upon FcepsilonRI activation (12, 13). Calcineurin is capable of regulating NFAT and NF-kappaB nuclear translocation (14, 15). Blocking the calcineurin-NFAT pathway by using pharmaceutical molecules has been shown to be an effective means for treating allergic inflammation, highlighting the importance of this pathway in allergy (16).

A new family of regulators of calcineurin (Rcans), including Rcan1, Rcan2, and Rcan3, has been shown to modulate calcineurin activity under physiological and pathological conditions (17). In this study, we identified Rcan1 as an endogenous negative regulator in FcepsilonRI-mediated signaling. Rcan1 deficiency had few effects on the early phase (5-20 min) of FcepsilonRI-induced NFAT and IkappaB activation but strongly enhanced the late-phase FcepsilonRI-mediated NFAT activation (3-6 h) and IkappaB phosphorylation (1 h), leading to increased cytokine production in vitro and enhanced late-phase cutaneous allergic reaction in vivo. Rcan1 deficiency also showed increased FcepsilonRI-mediated mast cell degranulation in vitro and increased passive cutaneous anaphylaxis in vivo. Accordingly, Rcan1 is a novel negative regulator in FcepsilonRI-induced mast cell activation. In addition, biochemical and genetic analyses revealed a new link between Egr1 and Rcan1 in FcepsilonRI-mediated signaling.

Suppression subtractive hybridization (SSH) allows us to identify target genes even without a prerequisite knowledge of these genes. SSH was used to identify genes that are differentially expressed in FcepsilonRI-activated mast cells. Total RNA from TNP-BSA-treated or untreated mouse bone marrow-derived mast cells (BMMCs) were used to generate double-stranded cDNAs. A subtracted cDNA library was constructed to enrich the transcripts that were differentially expressed by mast cells after TNP-BSA stimulation. The subtraction efficiency was evaluated by comparing GAPDH cDNA levels by PCR in serial dilutions of subtracted and nonsubtracted control cDNA (Fig. S1, available at ). The PCR products of the subtraction were cloned and sequenced after a differential hybridization procedure to exclude false positives. Surprisingly, among 33 positive clones sequenced, 8 clones matched the Rcan1 gene (exons 4, 5, 6, and 7), suggesting the abundance of this gene product in FcepsilonRI-activated mast cells (Table S1 and Fig. S2). One clone matched the Egr1 gene (Table S1). Reverse Northern blot analysis using one of the identified Rcan1 clones (2C3) as a probe confirmed the increased expression of Rcan1 in the TNP-BSA-stimulated sample (Fig. 1 A).

IgE-dependent Rcan1 expression by mast cells. (A) RNAs from TNP-BSA-treated (TNP) and untreated (NT) mouse BMMCs were reversed transcribed into cDNA and blotted with a GAPGH probe or a Rcan1 probe obtained from clone 2C3 in the SSH assay. A representative Northern blot from two independent experiments is shown. (B and C) BMMCs were sensitized with anti-TNP IgE and stimulated with 10 ng/ml TNP-BSA for 15, 30, 60, or 180 min. RNA isolated from these cells was reverse transcribed to cDNA and subjected to real-time quantitative PCR. Rcan1 expression was normalized to endogenous control GAPDH. The data are expressed as relative mRNA levels compared with the mean expression level in BMMCs treated with TNP-BSA for 60 min (=1), because at this time point Rcan1 showed the highest expression level. The PCR products were also separated by agarose gel and stained with ethidium bromide. Untreated BMMCs (NT) showed no Rcan1 expression, whereas TNP induced a strong Rcan1 expression. Error bars represent SEs from three independent experiments. (D) IgE-sensitized BMMCs were treated with TNP-BSA for 2, 4, or 6 h. Cell lysates were analyzed by Western blotting for Rcan1. TNP-induced Rcan1 expression was observed in wild-type BMMCs (Rcan1+/+). Lysate from Rcan1-deficient BMMCs (Rcan1-/-) after TNP treatment (2 h) was used as a control. Membrane was stripped and probed for actin as a loading control. A representative Western blot from two independent experiments is shown.

We further examined the kinetics of Rcan1 expression in mast cells in response to FcepsilonRI aggregation using real-time quantitative PCR. Given that the expression of any Rcan family members by mast cells has not been reported previously, we also examined Rcan2 and Rcan3. Two Rcan1 isoforms have been reported, the isoform Rcan1-4 encoded by exons 4, 5, 6, and 7, and the isoform Rcan1-1 encoded by exons 1, 5, 6, and 7 (17). Total RNA was isolated from TNP-BSA-treated mouse BMMCs and analyzed by real-time quantitative PCR for two Rcan1 isoforms, as well as for Rcan2 and Rcan3. Levels of Rcan mRNA expression were normalized to GAPDH in each sample. Rcan1-1 and Rcan3 showed low levels of expression under resting conditions, whereas Rcan2 was undetectable in both resting and activated cells (unpublished data). Among these Rcan family members tested, Rcan1-4 was the only member found to be up-regulated by TNP-BSA stimulation. The Rcan1-4 level in the unstimulated mast cells was undetectable. Rcan1-4 expression peaked at 60 min after TNP-BSA stimulation (Fig. 1 B). PCR-amplified Rcan1 products (Rcan1-4) were also separated in agarose gels and visualized by ethidium bromide staining. A representative gel is presented in Fig. 1 C. Strong Rcan1-4 expression can be seen at 60 min after TNP-BSA stimulation.

To examine a role of Rcan1 in IgE-dependent mast cell activation, we chose to obtain mouse BMMCs from Rcan1-deficient mice. Exons 5 and 6 are deleted from the Rcan1 gene. Thus, these mice are deficient in Rcan1 products (Rcan1-1 and Rcan1-4) (18). Bone marrow cells from Rcan1-deficient and wild-type mice were cultured in conditioned medium and were analyzed by flow cytometry for c-kit and IgE receptor expression. No difference of the c-kit and IgE receptor expression after 5 wk of culture was observed between wild-type and Rcan1-deficient cells (Fig. S3 A, available at ). BMMCs were also used for Toluidine blue staining. Morphologically, no difference was observed between Rcan1-deficient and wild-type mast cells (Fig. S3 B). This result suggests that mast cells mature normally in the absence of Rcan1.

To determine the specific signaling pathways regulated by Rcan1 in FcepsilonRI-mediated mast cell activation, we examined activation of NFAT, NF-kappaB, and MAPK pathways in Rcan1-deficient BMMCs. For the study of NFAT pathway activation, an NFAT luciferase assay, EMSA, and an immunofluorescence assay were used. Rcan1-deficient and wild-type BMMCs were transfected with NFAT luciferase plasmid. Cells were then sensitized with anti-TNP IgE and activated with TNP-BSA for 18 h. A significant increase in NFAT luciferase activity was seen in Rcan1-deficient BMMCs after TNP-BSA stimulation compared with that in wild-type BMMCs (Fig. 2 A). These data suggests that Rcan1 is a negative regulator of IgE-dependent NFAT activation.

Rcan1 deficiency leads to increased IgE-dependent NFAT activation. (A) Rcan1+/+ and Rcan1-/- BMMCs were transfected with a pNFAT-Luc and the control reporter plasmid pRL-TK. After transfection (24 h), cells were sensitized with anti-TNP IgE for 18 h. Then cells were either left untreated (NT) or treated with 10 ng/ml TNP-BSA for 18 h (TNP). Firefly and Renilla activities were sequentially quantified using a dual-luciferase reporter assay system. Data are means +/- SEM (n = 3 independent experiments). *, P < 0.05 compared with wild-type group. (B) NFAT binding concensus sequence (N) on mouse IL-13 promoter 5'-AAGGTGTTTCCCCAAGCCTTTCCC-3' was labeled with 32P for EMSA. After sensitization with anti-TNP IgE, Rcan1+/+ and Rcan1-/- BMMCs were either not treated (NT) or stimulated with 10 ng/ml TNP-BSA for 5, 20, 60, 180, and 360 min. Nuclear proteins were isolated and subjected to EMSA. Shown is a representative from six independent experiments. (C) Densitometry analysis of NFAT activation by EMSA was performed based on six experiments. *, P < 0.05 compared with the same time point of the wild-type group (180 or 360 min). (D) Nuclear extracts from Rcan1+/+ and Rcan1-/- BMMCs were used for competition assays. 50x concentrated unlabeled NFAT probe (N) was used to compete with the 32P-labeled NFAT probe, whereas 50x concentrated unlabeled mutant NFAT probe (Nm; 5'-AAGGTGTCCATCCAAGCCTCCTAC-3') was used as a control. 1 mul of nonradiolabeled wild-type NFAT probe (N) or mutant probe Nm were added and incubated for 15 min before the addition of the radiolabeled probe.

To further examine NFAT activation, an NFAT DNA probe was synthesized based on the NFAT binding sequence in the mouse IL-13 promoter and labeled with 32P. Nuclear extracts from Rcan1-deficient and wild-type BMMCs after TNP stimulation for various times (5-360 min) were subjected to EMSA using a 32P-labeled NFAT probe. As shown in Fig. 2 B, NFAT activities were enhanced in Rcan1-deficient BMMCs at the later time points (180 and 360 min) after TNP stimulation. In contrast, little difference was observed at the early time points (5-60 min) between Rcan1-deficient and wild-type BMMCs. This result suggests that Rcan1 is a negative regulator by turning off the TNP-activated NFAT signal. Densitometry analysis of NFAT DNA binding activity is shown in Fig. 2 C. The binding specificity of nuclear proteins to the NFAT DNA sequence was verified through competitive binding by the nonradioisotope-labeled NFAT probe but not by a mutant probe (Fig. 2 D). The binding specificity was further verified by supershift assay. Nuclear protein binding to the NFAT probe was strongly blocked by anti-NFATc1 antibody or by anti-NFATc2 antibody (Fig. 2 E).

To examine NFAT nuclear translocation, IgE-sensitized BMMCs were treated with TNP-BSA for 6 h. Cells were then fixed, permeabilized, and stained with anti-NFATc1 antibody. The cell nucleus was visualized by DAPI staining. TNP-induced NFAT nuclear translocation was visible in wild-type and Rcan1-deficient cells. Enhanced NFAT nuclear translocation was seen in Rcan1-deficient cells when compared with wild-type cells (Fig. S4, available at ).

In light of a critical role for transcription factor NF-kappaB in the regulation of gene expression (19), we examined whether Rcan1 is required in FcepsilonRI-mediated NF-kappaB pathway activation. Rcan1-deficient BMMCs and wild-type cells were transfected with NF-kappaB luciferase plasmid. After sensitization with anti-TNP IgE, BMMCs were stimulated with TNP-BSA for 5 h. As shown in Fig. 3 A, Rcan1-deficient BMMCs showed significantly enhanced NF-kappaB activity in response to TNP stimulation, suggesting that Rcan1 is needed for the negative regulation of FcepsilonRI-mediated NF-kappaB activation. NF-kappaB activity is regulated by IkappaB. The effects of Rcan1 on FcepsilonRI-mediated IkappaB phosphorylation and degradation were examined by Western blotting. Aggregation of FcepsilonRI induced a rapid phosphorylation of IkappaB (5 min), followed by IkappaB degradation (5 and 20 min) and subsequent regeneration of this molecule (60, 180, and 360 min; Fig. 3 B). Interestingly, the early events of IkappaB phosphorylation and degradation at 5 and 20 min were not affected by Rcan1 deficiency. In contrast, phosphorylation at the later time point (60 min) was significantly enhanced in Rcan1-deficient BMMCs (Fig. 3 B). This process was associated with an increased regeneration of IkappaBalpha at 60 min after TNP-BSA stimulation (Fig. S5, available at ). These results suggest that Rcan1 is likely involved in "turning off" FcepsilonRI-mediated activation signals, a notion consistent with that in NFAT signaling.

Rcan1 deficiency induces increased IgE-dependent NF-kappaB activation but not MAPK, Akt, or Syk. (A) Rcan1+/+ and Rcan1-/- BMMCs were transfected with a pNF-kappaB-Luc and the control reporter plasmid pRL-TK. After transfection (24 h), cells were sensitized with anti-TNP IgE for 5 h. Cells were then either left untreated (NT) or treated with 10 ng/ml TNP-BSA for 18 h (TNP). Firefly and Renilla activities were sequentially quantified using a dual-luciferase reporter assay system. Data are means +/- SEM (n = 3 independent experiments). *, P < 0.05 compared with the wild-type group. (B and C) Rcan1+/+ and Rcan1-/- BMMCs were sensitized with anti-TNP IgE and stimulated with TNP-BSA for various times. Total cell lysates were analyzed by Western blotting for various phosphorylated and total proteins. Increased IkappaB phosphorylation in Rcan1-/- BMMCs was found at 60 min after TNP stimulation when compared with Rcan1+/+ cells. In contrast, the pattern of TNP-induced phosphorylation of p38, JNK, Akt, and Syk is similar between Rcan1-/- and Rcan1+/+ BMMCs.

MAPKs represent a distinct mechanism in the regulation of mast cell function. Previous studies have established a major role of the MAPKs c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and p38 in FcepsilonRI-mediated mast cell activation (20, 21). Accordingly, we tested whether Rcan1 affects FcepsilonRI-mediated JNK and p38 signaling. Cell lysates from TNP-stimulated BMMCs were subjected to Western blotting for phospho-JNK, phospho-p38, and their total proteins. As shown in Fig. 3 C, TNP stimulation induced an increase of p38 phosphorylation (5 min) and JNK phosphorylation (20 min). Subsequently, levels of p38 and JNK phosphorylation returned to basal conditions (180-360 min). Similar patterns of TNP-induced phosphorylation (the increase in the early phase and decrease in the late phase) of p38 and JNK were observed for Rcan1-deficient and wild-type mast cells. These data suggest that Rcan1 is not required for FcepsilonRI-mediated MAPK activation and inactivation processes. We also tested Akt phosphorylation, which is involved in the activation of the PI3K pathway. Similarly, no difference in the Akt phosphorylation pattern was observed between Rcan1-deficient and wild-type BMMCs (Fig. 3 C). In addition, a similar pattern of FcepsilonRI-mediated Syk phosphorylation was observed between wild-type and Rcan1-deficient BMMCs (Fig. 3 C).

Several cytokines such as IL-6, IL-13, and TNF play important roles in allergy and are regulated by the transcription factors NFAT and NF-kappaB. To determine whether Rcan1 is involved in the regulation of FcepsilonRI-mediated cytokine production, Rcan1-deficient and wild-type BMMCs were sensitized with anti-TNP IgE and stimulated with TNP-BSA for various times. IL-6, IL-13, and TNF production in cell-free supernatants was determined by ELISA. Expression of these cytokine mRNAs was analyzed by real-time quantitative PCR using total RNA isolated from cell pellets. Production of IL-6 was significantly enhanced by 87, 170, and 115% at the time points of 3, 6, and 18 h, respectively, in Rcan1-deficient BMMCs compared with wild-type BMMCs (Fig. 4 A). Importantly, real-time PCR analysis revealed that TNP-BSA-induced IL-6 mRNA expression was prolonged in Rcan1-deficient BMMCs (Fig. 4 B). PCR-amplified products separated by agarose gel electropheresis also revealed a prolonged TNP-BSA-induced IL-6 expression in Rcan1-deficient BMMCs (Fig. 4 C). Similarly, TNP-BSA-induced IL-13 and TNF production was enhanced at the protein level, whereas the mRNA expression of these cytokines was prolonged in Rcan1-deficient cells (Fig. 4, D-I). Enhanced production of IL-6, IL-13, and TNF at the protein level is likely caused by the prolonged mRNA expression of these cytokines. The prolonged mRNA expression of these cytokines supports the notion that Rcan1 functions as a negative regulator by turning off FcepsilonRI-activated signals. This is consistent with the negative role of Rcan1 in the regulation of FcepsilonRI-induced NFAT and IkappaB-NF-kappaB activation.

Rcan1 deficiency leads to enhanced IgE-dependent production of IL-6, IL-13, and TNF. After sensitization with anti-TNP IgE for 24 h, Rcan1+/+ and Rcan1-/- BMMCs were either not treated (NT) or stimulated with TNP-BSA for various times. Cell-free supernatants were collected for the detection of IL-6 (A), IL-13 (D), and TNF (G) by ELISA. Cell pellets were used for RNA isolation and analysis for cytokine mRNA expression. Real-time quantitative PCR was performed to determine IL-6 (B), IL-13 (E), and TNF (H) expression. IL-6, IL-13, and TNF expression was normalized to endogenous control GAPDH. The PCR products for IL-6 (C), IL-13 (F), and TNF (I) were also separated by agarose gel and stained with ethidium bromide. Untreated BMMCs (NT) showed little cytokine expression, whereas TNP induced enhanced cytokine production in Rcan1-/- BMMCs. Error bars represent SEs from six independent experiments (A, B, D, E, G, and H).

Mast cell-derived cytokines contribute to the development of late-phase allergic reactions (22, 23). To examine whether Rcan1 contributes to FcepsilonRI-mediated late-phase cutaneous reaction in vivo, mice were sensitized with anti-DNP IgE 24 h before a solution of 0.3% dinitrofluorobenzene (DNFB; hapten) was applied epicutaneously to the ear skin or footpad. IgE/antigen-specific edema was determined by tissue weight and thickness. Rcan1-deficient mice exhibited increased IgE/antigen-specific edema when measured by tissue weight (Fig. 6, A and B). Tissue thickness, measured by a digital micrometer, also showed similar results (Fig. 6, C and D). These findings are consistent with the increased IL-6, IL-13, and TNF production by Rcan1-deficient BMMCs in vitro.

(A-D) Mice were passively sensitized by i.v. injection of 2 mug anti-DNP IgE mAb. 24 h later, 20 mul of 0.3% DNFB in acetone/olive oil (4:1) was applied epicutaneously to both sides of the left hind paw or left ear, and 20 mul of acetone/olive oil was applied to the right hind paw or right ear as a control. 24 h later, the thickness of the foot pad and ear was measured using a digital micrometer. The weight of the hind paw and ear punch (5 mm) was also determined. The thickness and weight of the right ear or right hind paw that were treated with acetone/olive oil only were used as baseline values. The DNFB-induced increment of tissue thickness and weight was expressed as a percentage of the baseline values. Data are means +/- SEM (n = 10 mice in each group). *, P < 0.05 compared with wild-type mice. (E) BMMCs were sensitized with IgE and stimulated with TNP-BSA for 20 min. The release of beta-hexosaminidase was determined. Data are means +/- SEM (n = 3 independent experiments). *, P < 0.05 compared with wild-type BMMCs. (F) Passive cutaneous anaphylaxis. 20 ng anti-DNP IgE was injected intradermally on the left ear, whereas the right ear received saline as a control. After 24 h, mice received 100 mug DNP-BSA containing Evan's blue dye (1% wt/vol) via tail vein injection. Ear punches (8 mm) of both ears were collected 30 min later and were used for extraction of the Evan's blue dye. The optical density was measured at 620 nm. Data are means +/- SEM (n = 8 mice in each group). *, P < 0.05 compared with the IgE group of the wild-type mice. (G and H) Back skin, tongue, or ear tissues from wild-type or Rcan1-deficient mice were fixed and stained by alcian blue for mast cells. Similar metachromatic staining between wild-type and Rcan1-deficient mast cells was observed. Specimens were viewed on a microscope (Eclipse E600; Nikon) equipped with a camera (DMX1200; Nikon) and a DDL 20x or 40 x/0.75 objective lens. Acquisition was performed with Nikon ACT-1 software (version 2.20). Images were processed using Adobe Photoshop software (version 5.0). Slides shown are representative of sections taken from five mice per group. The number of mast cells was enumerated by counting 10 randomly selected fields with a 40 x/0.75 objective lens (H). Data are means +/- SEM (n = 10 fields). Bars, 5 mum.

To examine whether Rcan1 plays a role in IgE-dependent mast cell degranulation, wild-type and Rcan1-deficient BMMCs were sensitized with anti-TNP IgE and stimulated with TNP-BSA for 20 min. Mast cell degranulation was determined by testing beta-hexosaminidase release. Increased mast cell degranulation was observed in Rcan1-deficient mast cells (Fig. 6 E). Mast cell mediators released by degranulation contribute to the anaphylactic reactions in vivo. To examine whether Rcan1 deficiency affects passive cutaneous anaphylaxis in vivo, the left ears of mice were passively sensitized with 20 ng anti-DNP IgE, whereas the right ears were injected with saline as a control. 24 h later, mice were injected with 100 mug DNP-BSA containing Evans blue dye via the tail vein. 30 min later, tissues from both ears were collected for extraction of Evans blue dye to determine vascular permeability. Increased vascular permeability (passive cutaneous anaphylaxis) was observed in Rcan1-deficient mice (Fig. 6 F).

To exclude the possibility that the increased cutaneous allergic responses is caused by the abnormal mast cell development in vivo, the ears, tongues, and back skin from Rcan1-deficient and wild-type mice were used to examine the presence of mast cells. A similar number and morphology of mast cells were observed in tissues from Rcan1-deficient and wild-type mice (Fig. 6, G and H).

Next, we examined how the negative Rcan1 signal is activated during FcepsilonRI activation. Our SSH assay using RNAs from TNP-BSA-stimulated BMMCs identified one clone (2A10) that matched the Egr1 gene (Table S1). Real-time quantitative PCR analysis showed that Egr1 gene expression peaked at 15 min after TNP-BSA stimulation. In contrast, Rcan1 expression began to increase at 15 min and peaked at 60 min (Fig. 7 A). These data suggested a sequential gene expression relationship between Egr1 and Rcan1 in mast cells and prompted us to analyze the promoter sequence of Rcan1, where we identified a putative Egr1 binding domain (Fig. 7 B).

Egr1 binds to and transactivates the Rcan1 promoter. (A) RNA from TNP-BSA-treated BMMCs was analyzed by real-time quantitative PCR for Egr1 and Rcan1. Egr1 and Rcan1 expression was normalized to endogenous control GAPDH. The data are expressed as relative mRNA levels compared with the mean expression level in BMMCs treated with TNP-BSA for 15 min (=1; Egr1) or for 60 min (=1; Rcan1), because at this time point Egr1 or Rcan1 showed the highest expression level, respectively (n = 3 experiments). (B) The location and sequence of the Egr1 binding site on the Rcan1 promoter. (C) BMMCs were transfected with various plasmids generated from pGL4 containing different lengths of the Egr1 binding sequence and the control reporter plasmid pRL-TK. All constructs start at -67 bp relative to the ATG codon. The 5' end of each construct is shown at the left. Firefly and Renilla activities were sequentially quantified using a dual-luciferase reporter assay system. Results are means +/- SEM (n = 3). (D) Nuclear proteins from untreated (NT) or TNP-BSA-treated BMMCs (TNP-BSA 1 h) were subjected to EMSA. An Egr1 DNA probe was synthesized based on the Egr1 binding sequences on the Rcan1 promoter (E). A mutant Egr1 DNA probe with two nucleotide mutations was used for a competition assay (Em). Strong TNP-BSA-induced Egr1 binding was seen and was competed by the specific cold probe (E) but not by the mutant probe (Em). Results are representative of three independent experiments. (E) ChIP assay for the association of Egr1 with Rcan1 promoter in vivo. BMMCs were stimulated with TNP-BSA for 60 min or left unstimulated. Protein-DNA complexes were extracted and precipitated with anti-Egr1 antibody (Egr1) or control IgG (IgG). DNA from samples before immunoprecipitation (IP) was used as an input control (Input). PCR was performed using primers based on the Rcan1 promoter sequence. Amplified DNA was resolved in agarose gel. Specific Egr1 binding to the Rcan1 promoter was seen in TNP-stimulated cells (lane 8) but not in unstimulated cells (lane 7). Results are representative of three independent experiments.

To determine whether the putative Egr1 binding sequence on the Rcan1 promoter between -158 and -142 is functional, we generated a series of constructs for a luciferase assay containing various regions of the Rcan1 promoter. All constructs start at -67 bp from the ATG codon. The 5' end of each construct varies to include different parts of the putative Egr1 binding sequence (Fig. 7 C, left). Mouse BMMCs were transfected with these constructs, sensitized with anti-TNP IgE, and stimulated with TNP-BSA. Luciferase activity was determined. As shown in Fig. 7 C, both constructs pR-luc283 and pR-luc158, which contain the full length of the Egr1 binding sequence from -158 to -142, showed strong luciferase activity. The construct pR-luc154, which contains a partial Egr1 binding sequence from -154 to -142, showed decreased luciferase activity. In contrast, the construct pR-luc141, which does not contain an Egr1 binding region, and the empty plasmid pGL4-Basic showed little luciferase activity. This result suggests that the Egr1 binding sequence in the Rcan1 promoter is functional.

To further confirm that the Egr1 binding sequence is functional in response to FcepsilonRI aggregation, we synthesized a DNA probe containing the Egr1 binding sequence in the Rcan1 promoter for a gel shift assay. Nuclear proteins were isolated from BMMCs after TNP-BSA stimulation and subjected to EMSA. Strong DNA binding was seen in TNP-BSA-stimulated cells (Fig. 7 D). The binding specificity was confirmed by competition with the nonradiolabeled probe (E, unlabeled probe) but not with a mutant probe (Em, unlabeled probe; Fig. 7 D).

Furthermore, a chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay was performed to confirm FcepsilonRI-induced binding of Egr1 to the Rcan1 promoter. Nuclei from TNP-BSA-stimulated and unstimulated BMMCs were subjected to enzymatic digestion followed by immunoprecipitation using anti-Egr1 or control antibodies. Immunoprecipitates were subjected to PCR using a pair of primers that amplify the Rcan1 promoter region encompassing the Egr1 binding sequence. Specific Egr1 binding to the Rcan1 promoter was observed in TNP-BSA-stimulated cells (Fig. 7 E, lane 8) but not in unstimulated cells (Fig. 7 E, lane 7). This result suggested that TNP-BSA stimulation induced Egr1 binding to the Rcan1 promoter.

To evaluate whether Egr1 is required for FcepsilonRI-induced Rcan1 expression, we generated Egr1-deficient and wild-type BMMCs. Egr1-deficient BMMCs mature normally and express similar levels of FcepsilonRI compared with wild-type BMMCs. BMMCs were sensitized with anti-TNP IgE and stimulated with TNP-BSA. Total RNA was isolated and analyzed by real-time quantitative PCR for Rcan1 (isoform Rcan1-4) expression. TNP-BSA-induced Rcan1 expression was significantly reduced in Egr1-deficient BMMCs (Fig. 8 A). A PCR-amplified Rcan1 product (Rcan1-4) was also separated on an agarose gel. A representative gel is presented in Fig. 8 B. Reduced Rcan1 expression in Egr1-deficient BMMCs can be seen after TNP-BSA stimulation. Thus, Egr1 is required for FcepsilonRI-induced Rcan1 expression.

DISCUSSION
###end title 48
###begin p 49
The present study demonstrates an as of yet unknown pathway linking activation to inhibition in FcepsilonRI-mediated signaling. Notably, we found that an FcepsilonRI aggregation-induced activation signal initiates de novo synthesis of Rcan1. Rcan1 was identified as a negative regulator, required for turning off FcepsilonRI-activated signals. FcepsilonRI-mediated Rcan1 inhibits calcineurin activity, which leads to down-regulation of NFAT and NF-kappaB activation, and subsequent cytokine production and inhibition of late-phase allergic reactions. Moreover, Rcan1 is also required for the negative regulation of mast cell degranulation and acute passive cutaneous anaphylaxis. Thus, both the preformed mediator release and the production of newly synthesized cytokines are negatively regulated by Rcan1.

It is noteworthy that Rcan1 selectively regulated FcepsilonRI-mediated NFAT and NF-kappaB pathway but not MAPK and Akt activation. The activity of NFAT is regulated by its phosphorylation state, which is controlled by the opposing action of the serine/threonine phosphatase, calcineurin, and the serine/threonine kinase, glycogen synthase kinase 3 beta. Under resting conditions, NFAT is phosphorylated and localized in the cytoplasm. Upon stimulation, it is dephosphorylated by calcineurin and translocates to the nucleus. Studies have indicated that Rcan1 can bind to and inhibit calcineurin (24-26). Thus, it is possible that FcepsilonRI-induced Rcan1 blocks NFAT activation through inhibition of calcineurin. Consistent with this model, we found that calcineurin activity was increased in Rcan1-deficient mast cells. Various pharmaceutical molecules targeting the calcineurin-NFAT pathway have successfully been used for the treatment of allergic inflammation (16). This highlights the importance of the NFAT pathway in allergic diseases.

In addition to NFAT activation, we also found that FcepsilonRI-induced IkappaB phosphorylation and NF-kappaB activity were enhanced in Rcan1-deficient mast cells. Rcan1 is able to regulate the NF-kappaB pathway through direct interaction with NF-kappaB-inducing kinase or IkappaB (27, 28). In addition, calcineurin can dephosphorylate IkappaB, leading to the subsequent nuclear translocation of NF-kappaB (15). Thus, Rcan1 could also indirectly regulate the NF-kappaB pathway through calcineurin. Enhanced FcepsilonRI-induced IkappaB-NF-kappaB pathway activation in Rcan1-deficient mast cells likely contributes to the increased cytokine production and enhanced late-phase cutaneous allergic reactions.

FcepsilonRI-mediated mast cell production of cytokines such as IL-6, IL-13, and TNF may be beneficial or harmful in the setting of innate or allergic responses. Efficient production of mast cell mediators would be beneficial for the effective development of host defenses, whereas overproduction of mast cell mediators could be harmful. Accordingly, a temporal regulatory mechanism is necessary that allows the initial FcepsilonRI-mediated signaling to proceed in the early phase and permits the termination of the activated signal subsequently in a timely manner. We found that the new synthesis of Rcan1 was dependent on Egr1, which is synthesized de novo after FcepsilonRI stimulation (6). These data suggest that activation signals, including Egr1, proceed to initiate inflammatory cytokine expression, but subsequently Rcan1 is induced, which serves as a negative regulator to inhibit FcepsilonRI-mediated signals by inhibiting calcineurin activity. The new link of Egr1 and Rcan1 may represent a transition from activation to inhibition in FcepsilonRI signaling.

Rcan1 deficiency not only up-regulates cytokine production, it also enhances IgE-dependent mast cell degranulation in vitro and passive cutaneous anaphylaxis in vivo. Calcineurin activity has been associated with mast cell exocytosis (29). Thus, it is possible that Rcan1 modulates IgE-dependent mast cell degranulation and passive cutaneous anaphylaxis through inhibiting calcineurin activity. However, a recent paper demonstrated that Rcan1 regulates vesicle exocytosis and fusion pore kinetics through novel unknown mechanisms other than calcineurin (30). Indeed, Rcan1 also directly interacts with several additional targets other than calcineurin. These include Raf-1 (31), 14-3-3 (32), and NF-kappaB-inducing kinase (28). All of these molecules have been directly or indirectly associated with exocytosis.

RCAN1 was first identified as an expressed sequence on a yeast artificial chromosome clone from human chromosome 21 (33). The Rcan1 gene consists of seven exons, of which exons 1-4 can be alternatively transcribed to produce different mRNA isoforms (17). Members of this new Rcan family also include Rcan2 and Rcan3 (17). The functional distinctions among these family members are unclear. It is interesting to note that the isoform of Rcan1-4, which is encoded by exons 4, 5, 6, and 7, was the only member to be up-regulated by FcepsilonRI aggregation. This result suggests that this isoform may be functionally distinct from the other family members.

Egr1 can be induced by a variety of stimuli such as sepsis (34) and tissue injuries (35). Rcan1 has also been associated with several diseases (36). The link between Egr1 and Rcan1 identified in this study will offer unforeseen potential for the regulation of signaling in a wide range of Egr1- and Rcan1-associated physiological processes and human diseases.

The plasmid pGL4.10 [Luc2] (Promega) was used to construct pR-Luc plasmids containing Rcan1 promoter fragments. A fragment of the Rcan1 promoter (-283 to -67, relative to the transcription start site) was generated by PCR with the forward primer 5'-GCTCTAGACTAAGGTGTTGACGTCACC-3' (XbaI site underlined) and the reverse primer 5'-TTTAAGCTTCCTTTGCAAGAGAACGAGCG-3' (HindIII site underlined). The PCR product was purified, digested with XbaI and HindIII, and ligated into the NheI/HindIII sites of pGL4.10 using T4 DNA ligase and sequenced to verify orientation. It was designated as pR-Luc283. To generate progressive 5'-unidirectional truncations by PCR, a series of forward primers was used in combination with the same reverse primer and pR-Luc283 as the template. The forward primers began with -158 (5'-CTGGAAGCCAAGATCTCCCCG-3'; BglII site underlined), -154 (5'-GAAGCCAAGCGGTACCGCCC-3'; KpnI site underlined), and -141 (5'-CCAGGCAGCTGGCTCTCCGCG-3'; PvuII site underlined). The purified PCR products were digested with corresponding restriction enzymes, treated with mung bean exonuclease, and subcloned into the EcoRV/HindIII sites of pGL4.10. They were designated pR-Luc158, pR-Luc154, and pR-Luc141, respectively. Each construct was verified by sequencing the insert and plasmid-flanking region.

Total RNA (0.6 mug) from no treatment and TNP-treated BMMCs were reverse transcribed using the SMART PCR cDNA Synthesis Kit (Clontech Laboratories, Inc.) and amplified in 19 cycles of PCR, according to the manufacturer's protocol. These cDNAs were subjected to two rounds of subtractive hybridization using the PCR-Select cDNA Subtraction Kit (Clontech Laboratories, Inc.). Forward-subtracted cDNA (no treatment cDNA as driver and TNP-treated adaptor-ligated cDNA as tester) was amplified by two rounds of nested PCR using adaptor-specific primers and Platinum High Fidelity Taq Polymerase (Invitrogen). The resulting PCR products were treated with Taq polymerase (Invitrogen) for 10 min and purified using a MinElute column (QIAGEN) before subcloning into the pCR4-TOPO TA cloning vector (Invitrogen). The ligations were transformed into TOP10 chemically competent cells and plated on lysogeny broth (LB) agar (Invitrogen) containing 100 mug/ml ampicillin (Sigma-Aldrich). Transformed colonies were picked into separate wells of 96-well plates containing 100 mul of LB ampicillin, grown for 4 h, arrayed onto four Hybond-N+ membranes (GE Healthcare), and grown overnight on LB agar supplemented with ampicillin. The colonies were lysed and fixed to the Hybond-N+ membranes using 0.5 M NaOH/1.5 M NaCl, neutralized with 1.5 M NaCl/1 M Tris (pH 7.4), and UV cross-linked in a UV Stratalinker (Agilent Technologies). The forward- and back-subtracted nested PCR products, as well as nonsubtracted tester control and nonsubtracted driver control PCR products, were digested with EagI (New England Biolabs, Inc.) to remove the adaptor sequences, purified with a MinElute column, and labeled with alpha-[32P]dCTP (GE Healthcare) using the RediPrime labeling kit (GE Healthcare). Unincorporated nucleotide was removed using MicroSpin G-25 columns (GE Healthcare). Each denatured probe (2.5 x 106 dpm) was hybridized with one membrane in 20 ml of Church and Gilbert's buffer overnight at 70degreesC. The membranes were washed and exposed to Hyperfilm (GE Healthcare). Clones that only hybridized with the forward-subtracted probe were picked into LB AMP, and plasmid DNA was extracted using the Qiaprep Spin Kit (QIAGEN). DNA sequencing was performed on a capillary sequencer (CEQ8000; Beckman Coulter) using the M13rev primer.
