Stress Granules (SG) are sites of accumulation of stalled initiation complexes that are induced following a variety of cellular insults. In a genetic screen for factors involved in protecting human myoblasts from acute oxidative stress, we identified a gene encoding a protein we designate SGNP (Stress Granule and Nucleolar Protein).

Methodology/Principal Findings
###end title 4
###begin p 5
A gene-trap insertional mutagenesis screen produced one insertion that conferred resistance to sodium arsenite. RT-PCR/3' RACE was used to identify the endogenous gene expressed as a GFP-fusion transcript. SGNP is localized in both the cytoplasm and nucleolus and defines a non-nucleolar compartment containing 5.8S rRNA, a component of the 60S ribosomal subunit. Under oxidative stress, SGNP nucleolar localization decreases and it rapidly co-localizes with stress granules. The decrease in nucleolar SGNP following oxidative stress was accompanied by a large increase in nucleolar 5.8S rRNA. Knockdown of SGNP with shRNA increased global mRNA translation but induced growth arrest and cell death.

Translation of "housekeeping" transcripts can be globally repressed following oxidative stress by the formation of cytoplasmic stress granules (SGs) [1]. SGs are sites of accumulation of stalled translation initiation complexes which contain eukaryotic initiation factors eIF3, eIF4E, eIF4G, small (but not large) ribosomal subunits, mRNA transcripts and the related RNA-binding proteins such as TIA-1 and TIAR [1]-[3]. In contrast, translation of stress-induced transcripts encoding heat shock proteins and some transcription factors is maintained or enhanced [1].

Myoblast transfer has been proposed as a potential therapy for muscular dystrophy [4]. One factor limiting the success of myoblast transplantation is the significant cell death that occurs shortly after transfer [5], [6]. In an attempt to discover factors that might confer increased cell survival following transplantation, we initiated a genetic screen for insertional mutations that conferred resistance to oxidative stress in human myoblasts. We here report the identification of a new protein, named SGNP (Stress Granule and Nucleolar Protein). SGNP is an essential gene where efficient mRNA knockdown leads to growth arrest and cell death. It localizes to both the nucleolus and cytoplasm. In addition to the nucleolus, in a small percentage of cells it can be found surrounding a previously undescribed nuclear structure that is highly enriched for 5.8S ribosomal RNA. Following exposure to sodium arsenite, SGNP nucleolar staining becomes highly reduced and the cytoplasmic staining becomes restricted to stress granules. Its association with both the nucleolus and nuclear 5.8S-enriched structures and stress granules in the cytoplasm suggests that SGNP is an essential gene involved in ribosomal processing and translational control.

In an effort to identify genes that could contribute to the increased survival of cells following transplantation, we used a retroviral gene trap approach to screen immortalized human skeletal myoblasts (LHCNM2) for insertions that lead to resistance to the oxidizing agent sodium arsenite. About 40% of the parental cells failed to exclude propidium iodide, a membrane impermeant dye [7]. Clone #82 showed a striking resistance and only 4% failed to exclude propidium iodide (Fig. 1A). The doubling rate of Clone #82 (2 divisions/week) was only half as great as that of the parental cells (4 PD/week) (Fig. 1B) showing that the insertion also had adverse phenotypic effects that significantly slowed cell growth.

The subcellular distribution of the GFP-82 fusion protein was examined with anti-GFP antibodies and compared to cells infected with the unfused eGFP cDNA (pBabepuro-eGFP). Free GFP was detected ubiquitously while the GFP-82 fusion protein was present in the cytoplasm but also colocalized with the nucleolar marker nucleolin (Fig. 2A). After treatment with arsenite (0.5 mM, 1 hour), the GFP-82 fusion protein showed greatly reduced nucleolar staining, and the cytoplasmic staining relocalized to discrete cytoplasmic foci. The GFP-fusion protein co-localized with TIAR, a marker of stress granules (SGs) (Fig. 2B), suggesting that that the GFP-82 fusion protein was a component of SGs.

RT-PCR/3' RACE was performed to amplify the fusion transcripts using primers from the 5' unique GFP sequences. Sequence analysis indicated that GFP was inserted into the hypothetical LOC26010 locus. Four predicted alternatively spliced isoforms were confirmed by RT-PCR (iso1-4) or 5'RACE (iso3, 4). The vector pTrap-GFP had been inserted between the 1st and 2nd exons and in frame with the downstream exons to produce a GFP-82 fusion protein (Fig. 3A). RT-PCR using a forward primer in exon 1 of Iso1 and a reverse primer in the last exon of Iso1 did not generate a fusion transcript, but a forward primer in GFP and the same reverse primer did yield a GFP-82 fusion transcript. These results suggest that the GFP-82 fusion transcript may not have included the 1st exon of Iso1 but initiated from a different upstream exon. Based on the subcellular distribution of the GFP-82 fusion protein under normal and stress condition, we designated this protein Stress Granule and Nucleolar Protein (SGNP).

All four spliced isoforms of SGNP (Fig. 3A) contain a Ribosomal L4 motif, a DUF 1387 domain, a Ebp2 domain, a nuclear export signal and a coiled-coil domain. (Fig. 4A). The approximately300 aa conserved DUF 1387 domain is present in a number of hypothetical proteins of unknown function that seem to be restricted to mammals. The approximately200 aa Ebp2 domain mostly overlaps the DUF1387 in SGNP. The EBP2 family consists of several eukaryotic rRNA processing proteins required for the maturation of 25S rRNA (yeast) and 60S (mammalian) subunit assembly [8], [9], and the presence of the Ebp2 domain in SGNP suggests that SGNP may be involved in rRNA processing.

The isolated DUF1387 domain (GFP-DUF1387) and a DUF1387 domain deletion mutant (GFP-SGNP Iso3 DeltaDUF1387) were both primarily localized to the nucleus and nucleolus in unstressed cells (Fig. 4C). After sodium arsenite the DUF1387 domain remained in the nucleolus but also was recruited to SGs, while the protein lacking the DUF1387 domain showed reduced nucleolar staining but failed to move to SGs (Fig. 4D). Thus, the DUF 1387 domain is both necessary and sufficient to direct SGNP to SGs, but by itself lacks signals that cause SGNP to leave the nucleolus after sodium arsenite exposure.

Little is known about whether nuclear export of 5.8S rRNA is affected after oxidative stress. In unstressed cells, the 5.8S rRNA antibody Y10B produced intense labeling of the cytoplasm and faint signals in the nucleolus (stained with fibrillarin) due to rapid transfer of the 5.8S rRNA to the cytoplasm (Fig. 6A). In contrast, after stress the 5.8S rRNA antibody produced intense nucleolar staining (Fig. 6B). The nucleolar staining of SGNP was greatly reduced after sodium arsenite (Fig. 3).The reduction in nucleolar SGNP and the increase in 5.8S nucleolar accumulation following stress is consistent with the hypothesis that SGNP may be involved in 5.8S RNA processing/export.

We examined whether SGNP plays a role in translational regulation by labeling cells with 50 microCi/ml [35S]methionine for 30 minutes three days after transduction with shGFP or shSGNP. Total protein synthesis was increased two-fold following shSGNP knockdown (Fig. 8). One protein at approximately25 kd showed a much higher rate of synthesis following SNAP knockdown. Stresses leading to apoptosis normally cause a decrease in total protein synthesis due to a block in cap-dependent translation [12], so the observed increase in translation should not be a result of the induction of the stress/apoptosis observed following shSGNP expression (Fig. 7). The appearance of NIs following SGNP knockdown may reflect the accumulation of misfolded/aggregated proteins following disruption of normal SGNP translation functions.

The toxicity of shRNA knockdown of SGNP suggested that the stress resistance of clone #82 could not be due to strong dominant-negative effects, and raised the question of why the GFP-82 insertional fusion protein should be conferring resistance to sodium arsenite. The slower growth of these cells (Fig. 1C) suggested toxicity and that a weak dominant-negative effect or haploinsufficiency might be occurring. Evidence in favor of this hypothesis is that a knockdown that produced approximately15% apoptosis after five days protected against additional toxicity from sodium arsenite (Fig. 9A). The appearance of stress granules 1 hour after sodium arsenite treatment was slightly inhibited by this knockdown (Fig. 9B): whereas almost 100% control cells formed SGs, 10% of shSGNP cells did not form SGs. This suggests that knockdown of SGNP partially disrupts SG formation.

Discussion
###end title 52
###begin p 53
We used a gene-trap insertional mutagenesis strategy in an attempt to isolate myoblasts that would exhibit increased survival following transplantation. The most interesting insertion identified SGNP, a gene that appears to be involved in various aspects of RNA metabolism. Its most obvious relationship to oxidative stress involved its localization to stress granules.
###end p 53
###begin p 54
In addition to stress granules, SGNP is concentrated in the nucleolus and an unknown structure we call the paranucleolus. This structure was seen in only a small fraction of interphase nuclei, lacked the nucleolar protein B23, and was strongly enriched in 5.8S RNA. Intriguingly, there were SGNP-positive connections between the paranucleolus and the nuclear envelope, suggesting the possibility of an involvement with nuclear export.

More than 150 trans-acting non-ribosomal proteins that contribute to ribosomal processing have been identified [13]. Pre-rRNA processing of the pre-60S ribosomal subunit is completed in the nucleus before the pre-60S ribosome containing the mature 28S, 5.8S and 5S rRNAs is exported [14]. Processing of the immediate precursor to the mature 5.8S rRNA occurs in a nuclear exosome [15], but a corresponding morphologically identifiable structure has, to our knowledge, not yet been identified. The paranucleolus is a candidate for this function.
###end p 55
###begin p 56
The nucleolar localization of SGNP is greatly diminished within 1 hour of treatment with 0.5 mM sodium arsenite while the abundance of nucleolar 5.8S RNA greatly increased. This inverse relationship is consistent with the hypothesis that SGNP might be involved in the processing or export of 5.8S rRNA.

In addition to a variety of specific RNA-binding proteins, SGs contain 40S but not 60S ribosomal subunits [2]. Since the 5.8S rRNA is part of the 60S large ribosomal subunit, the localization of SGNP to SGs cannot be explained by its potential involvement in 5.8S processing. Our results suggest that SGNP is also a component of the cellular apparatus governing mRNA translation and cellular stress responses. Knockdown of SGNP expression resulted in an increased protein synthesis rather than the decreased protein synthesis normally seen in cells subjected to stress. Knockout of another SG component, TIA-1, has also been shown to produce an elevated level of translation of mRNAs containing the TIA-1 binding motif [16]. Whether SGNP regulates protein synthesis by similar or different mechanisms remains to be determined.
###end p 57
###begin p 58
The detailed mechanisms by which SGNP influences RNA processing/export/translation awaits further investigation. However, its essential nature and its role in stress responses suggest that its study will contribute significantly to our understanding of these important processes.

The gene trap vector pTRAP-GFP contains the splice acceptor and donor sites from the myosin heavy chain II gene [17], [18] fused to the 6His-ATG-eGFP cDNA with an ATG translational start site and no stop codons. The SA-6His-eGFP-SD was designed according to [18] and obtained by PCR from pBi-eGFP using the following primers to produce all three reading frames(pTRAP-GFPA: GFPA-FW and GFPA-Re; pTRAP-GFPB: GFPB-FW andGFPB-Re; pTRAP-GFPC: GFPC-FW and GFPC-Re: see Table 1 for all oligonucleotide sequences).. Three PCR product SA-6His-eGFP-SD (A, B or C) representing three open reading frames were TA cloned into PCR2.1TA (Invitrogen) and subcloned into pBlueSK+ by EcoRI site. The three retroviral gene-trap vectors pTRAP-GFP (A, B,C) were made by subcloning the SA-6His-eGFP-SD (A, B or C) fragments removed by ClaI/SpeI from pBlueSK+ into the retroviral vector pBabepuro at the ClaI/NheI sites.
