The nucleotide sequence of 57 base pairs near the end of the cI gene in phage lambda is presented. This sequence was determined by direct sequencing techniques and includes the codons for 11 carboxyterminal aminoacids of the cI product, the lambda repressor. The sequence reveals that the cI gene, which has recently been shown to have a unique initiation region, is terminated by a UGA codon. A GUG triplet, which could act as a translation start signal for the rex gene occurs 8 base pairs beyond the cI termination codon. This GUG triplet is preceded by a sequence that could serve as a strong ribosome binding site for the rex message.
