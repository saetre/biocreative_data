The aggregation and fibrillation of alpha-synuclein has been implicated as a causative factor in the Parkinson's disease. The hexamer motif KTKEGV is found in each of the seven imperfect repeat sequences in the N-terminal half of alpha-synuclein. The motif is not fully conserved in the sixth and seventh repeats. We created mutants in which the motif was repaired to be fully conserved in either (Rep6 and Rep7) or both (Rep67) of these two repeats. The Rep6 and Rep67 mutants showed a greatly reduced propensity to aggregate and fibrillate while all three mutants showed greater resistance to HFIP-induced formation of the alpha-helix intermediate. Resistance to formation in the partially folded intermediate may repress the folding of alpha-synuclein, consequently interfering with the aggregation and fibril formation. These results demonstrated that KTKEGV repeats may have a significant role in keeping native unfolded status of alpha-synuclein.

Several neurodegenerative disorders have been characterized by the deposition and accumulation of abnormal protein components in cells, leading to selective synaptic damage. Such disorders are often described according to the type of misfolded and deposited protein, although it is not fully understood what causes the abnormal protein folding and accumulation as well as how they become cytotoxic. Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Lewy body (LB) disease, represented by Parkinson's disease (PD), are the most common neurodegenerative diseases, which are characterized by the accumulation of the misfolded proteins beta-amyloid and alpha-synuclein, respectively. That alpha-synuclein is the major fibrillar protein component of LB in both sporadic and familial PD, and that two different alpha-synuclein missense mutations (A53T 1, 2 and A30P 3) cause autosomal-dominant PD, strongly support a causative role for alpha-synuclein in PD pathogenesis.

alpha-Synuclein is a relatively abundant brain protein of unknown function that is a type of natively unfolded proteins (disordered proteins) 4, which have little or no ordered structure under physiological conditions in vitro. The protein's 140-amino acid amino acid sequence consists of an N-terminal region (residues 1-95) containing seven 11-residue repeats (XKTKEGVXXXX) that include a highly conserved KTKEGV hexameric motif, and an acidic C-terminal region (residues 96-140). Similarities in these 11-residue repeats with those found in apolipoproteins have suggested a possible role in the association of alpha-synuclein with lipid through formation of alpha-helical secondary structure 5, 6. Furthermore, portions of the alpha-synuclein N-terminal region have been reported to adopt an alpha-helical structure and bind SDS micelles 7-9 and lipid vesicles 10. alpha-Synucleins binding to lipid vesicles have been reported not to fibrillate in vitro11. These repeat sequences also have an effect of decreasing the tendency of alpha-synuclein to form beta-sheet structures, such as fibrils 12. The central region of alpha-synuclein (residues 61-95), known as the non-amyloid beta component of Alzheimer's disease amyloid (NAC), is recognized as the core region responsible for the formation of fibrils 13, which have a beta-sheet-rich structure 14.

However, none has ever reported on the role of KTKEGV repeated sequence in alpha-synuclein structure, particularly in the protein folded process and/or keeping its random structure. The lack in the information about the role of this one of the characteristic primary sequence in alpha-synuclein, KTKEGV, inspired us to initiate the reparation of imperfect sequence in this molecule. Interestingly, among the seven 11-amino acid imperfect repeats, the characteristic hexameric motifs in the two repeats located within the NAC region are not conserved (Figure 1). In order to investigate the role of these two non-conserved hexameric motifs on the aggregation and fibril formation ability of alpha-synuclein, we carried out a site-directed mutagenesis study on this region. We constructed three mutant alpha-synucleins in which either or both of the nonconserved hexameric motifs in the 6th and 7th repeats were substituted to the conserved KTKEGV sequence (Figure 1). We investigated the propensity of the mutant alpha-synucleins to form fibrils and aggregates, as well as their propensity to form alpha-helices. Our findings suggest that the two 11-residue repeat sequences in the NAC region have a strong effect on alpha-synuclein folding and the 6th repeat sequence has a particularly strong influence on alpha-synuclein's propensity to aggregate and fibrillate.

PCR amplification of the alpha-synuclein structural gene was carried out using a human bone marrow cDNA library as the template and the following oligonucleotide primer pair: 5'-CCAAGCTTCATATGGATGTATTCATGAAAGGACTTTCAAAGG-3' (forward) and 5'-GGTACCCTTGGCAAAGCAGGCTTCAGGTTCGTAGTCTTGATA-3' (reverse). The forward primer was designed with an NdeI immediately following a HindIII site, while the reverse primer has a KpnI site at its 5' end (all sites are underlined). Amplification was carried out using Ampli-Taq Gold DNA polymerase (Roche) with 35 cycles of 95 oC for 1 min, 55 oC for 1 min, and 72 oC for 1 min. The amplified fragment was cloned into the pGEM-T TA cloning vector (Promega) and its sequence was confirmed by automated DNA sequencing (Perkin Elmer ABI Model 310).

Wild type and mutant alpha-synuclein genes in pTYB1 were expressed in E. coli with C-terminal intein/chitin binding domain tags and purified using the IMPACT T7 one-step protein purification system (New England Biolabs). This system allowed simple purification of alpha-synucleins by binding of the fusion proteins to a chitin column, followed by addition of a thiol agent (dithiothreitol) to induce the self-cleavage reaction of the intein and release the alpha-synucleins. The resultant proteins were highly homogeneous by SDS-PAGE and their concentrations were determined by the DC protein assay kit (BioRad).

All protein samples were concentrated to approx. 10 mg/ml by using Amicon Ultra-15 filters (Millipore) in 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, and were centrifuged at 150,000g for 60 min to remove insoluble aggregates. alpha-Synucleins were incubated at concentrations of 2.0 mg/ml in 0.5 ml of the same buffer with 0.02% NaN3 at 37 oC with shaking in 1.5 ml tubes. Fibril formation was monitored by Thioflavin T (TfT) fluorescence by transferring 10 mul aliquots from the incubated sample to 1.0 ml of 25 muM TfT in 10 mM Tris buffer, pH 7.4. Fluorescence measurements were performed in a FP6500 spectrofluorometer (JASCO) with a 0.5 cm excitation light path. TfT fluorescence was recorded immediately after addition of protein aliquots to the TfT mixture at 1 nm increments from 460 to 560 nm, with an excitation of 450 nm, response time of 1 s, scan speed of 100 nm/min, and slits of 5 nm for both excitation and emission. For each sample, a blank measurement recorded prior to addition of alpha-synuclein to the TfT solution was subtracted from the final TfT intensity at 482 nm. All data were processed using Spectra Manager (JASCO) software. Rayleigh light scattering at 330 nm was used to monitor the total aggregation.

The far-UV CD spectrum of the prepared wild-type human recombinant alpha-synuclein sample is almost indistinguishable from those of the Rep6, Rep7, and Rep67 alpha-synuclein mutants (Figure 2). The CD spectra of these samples are typical of an essentially unfolded polypeptide chain, including the characteristic minima in the vicinity of 198 nm. These results show that the amino acid substitutions had no impact on the native state of alpha-synuclein.

The prepared wild type and mutant alpha-synuclein samples were investigated for their aggregation and fibril formation abilities using the fluorescent dye TfT. Because TfT appears to embed itself within the clearance of pleats of beta-sheets, it interacts quite specifically with fibrils but not with most native proteins or amorphous aggregates. Binding of TfT to protein fibrils is accompanied by a characteristic increase in the fluorescence intensity in the vicinity of 482 nm 15. Comparison of the fibrillation patterns of wild type and mutant alpha-synucleins (Figure 3) shows that Rep7 has a similar fibrillation rate and higher maximal fluorescence intensity than wild type. Therefore, reparation of the 7th repeat sequence, mutating it to contain the characteristic KTKEGV hexameric motif, did not affect the propensity of fibril formation. In contrast, Rep6 and Rep67 had much lower fibril formation rates than both wild type and Rep7, with maximal fibril formation values less than 10% of the wild-type value. Therefore, both Rep6 and Rep67 achieved great reductions in fibril formation ability by reparation of the 6th repeat sequence to contain the characteristic hexamer motif.

Light scattering from protein solutions is recognized as an association-dependent parameter reflecting the formation of large particles. Unlike TfT, the increase in static light scattering reflects the formation of all large particles, both fibrillar and amorphous, including large soluble oligomers. Total alpha-synuclein aggregation levels were determined by light scattering and compared (Figure 4). While the aggregation of Rep7 after 120 hours of incubation was almost identical to that of wild type, Rep6 and Rep67 were much less prone to aggregate. These results suggest that reparation of the 6th conserved characteristic hexamer motif has an especially strong effect on alpha-synuclein aggregation and fibrillation.

The primary structure at the NAC region strongly characterizes the preference of the formation of fibril. As we and other researcher reported 16, 17, the amino acid substitution at NAC region may result in the formation of less amyloid forming prone mutant alpha-synuclein, only if the introduced residues are positive toward the resistance in fibril formation. However, simultaneous substitution of 4 residues without changing their random and water soluble structures, is hard to be achieved. To design such simultaneous multi residues substitution, the precise prediction of possible secondary structure at the target region and the information about the interaction of residues under the folded condition are necessary, although few structural information in the folded structure of alpha-synuclein is available. Our results indicated that the introduction of KTKEGV sequence at the NAC region resulted in drastic decrease in the fibril formation ability without losing its primary random structure and its water solubility. This fact indicated that KTKEGV is a sequence which may have a crucial role in preventing amyloid fibril formation, keeping its random structure in a water soluble form. Considering that the replacement of NAC region itself may result in negative effect of amyloid forming ability, Rep6 showed less prone in amyloid forming than Rep7.

HFIP was used to induce the conversion of alpha-synucleins to an alpha-helical structure, which was monitored by far-UV CD spectra. Solutions containing the wild type protein (data not shown) and Rep6 (Figure 5) showed increased secondary structure with increasing HFIP. The minima at 198 nm, representing random structure, were converted to peaks with large positive ellipticity. This was accompanied by the appearance of minima around 208 nm and 222 nm, indicating the formation of alpha-helical structure with increasing HFIP. Similar HFIP concentration-dependent CD spectral changes were observed in solutions containing Rep7 or Rep67 (data not shown). Consistent with earlier studies, these observations indicate that the transition from the unfolded state to a partially folded intermediate conformation concludes with the formation of alpha-helix rich species as evidenced by the two minima at 208 nm and 222 nm.

Closer analysis of the changes in [theta]lambda (lambda=198 and lambda=222) of wild type and mutant alpha-synucleins with increasing HFIP concentration indicates that the formation of alpha-helical structure appears to proceed through two transitions (Figure 6). To examine the transitions in greater detail, we produced phase diagrams (Figures 7) showing the relationship between [theta]lambda198 and [theta]lambda222. A linear relationship reflects an all-or-none transition between two different conformations, while a nonlinear relation represents multiple sequential transformations. For the wild type alpha-synuclein, the structural changes with increasing HFIP clearly proceeds through two transitions (Figure 7): (I) from natively unfolded to partially folded (0-3.5% HFIP), and (II) from a partially folded intermediate to an alpha-helical conformation (3.5-10% HFIP). These observations are also consistent with earlier work 18. Although the Rep6 (Figure 7), Rep7, and Rep67 (data not shown) mutants also go through two transitions, the break-point HFIP concentration has shifted higher than with the wild type protein. Whereas the breaking point between the two transitions occurred near 3.5% HFIP for wild-type alpha-synuclein, all three mutants had breaking points near 4.5% HFIP (Figure 7). These greater HFIP requirements indicate that the reparation of the characteristic hexamer motif in the 6th or 7th repeat sequence help decrease the propensity of alpha-synuclein to form a partially folded intermediate.

The first critical step of aggregation and fibrillation of alpha-synuclein is considered to be the folding from a natively unfolded state to a partially folded intermediate 19. Munishkina et al. 18 reported the enhancement of fibril formation by low (1-2.5%) concentrations of HFIP in the presence of alcohol. Such low concentrations of HFIP were sufficient due to the ability of alcohol to stabilize the partially folded alpha-synuclein intermediate.

Our results clearly indicated that all mutants showed the resistant toward formation of partially folded structure compared with wild type. Therefore, KTKEGV repeats may have significant role in keeping native unfolded status of alpha-synuclein. Since the partial folded status is critical step in amyloid fibril forming process, the resistance toward the formation of partial folded structure revealed that KTKEGV repeats may give a positive contribution in preventing fibril formation.

As expected, Rep6 and Rep67 also showed lower propensities to aggregate and fibrillate than wild type alpha-synuclein. Although Rep7 also showed difficulty in intermediate formation, it appears to have a similar propensity to aggregate and fibrillate to wild type alpha-synuclein. Considering that only one amino acid was substituted to create Rep7, the NAC region remains relatively intact, and the interaction of the NAC region may dominate during the fibril or aggregation formation.
