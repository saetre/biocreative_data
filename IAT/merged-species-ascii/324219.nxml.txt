A cDNA library was constructed using mRNA from human fibroblasts induced with poly(I):poly(C). A bacterial clone containing fibroblast interferon cDNA sequences was identified by hybridization to a cDNA probe synthesized using deoxyoligonucleotide primers which hybridize to fibroblast interferon mRNA specifically. Expression plasmids were constructed which permitted the synthesis in E. coli of 8 x 10(7) units of human fibroblast interferon per liter of culture. The bacterially produced fibroblast interferon is indistinguishable from authentic human fibroblast interferon by several criteria.
