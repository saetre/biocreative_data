Background

###begin p 3
Akt/PKB is a serine/threonine kinase that has attracted much attention because of its central role in regulating cell proliferation, survival, motility and angiogenesis. Activation of Akt in breast cancer portends aggressive tumour behaviour, resistance to hormone-, chemo-, and radiotherapy-induced apoptosis and it is correlated with decreased overall survival. Recent studies have identified novel tumor-specific substrates of Akt that may provide new diagnostic and prognostic markers and serve as therapeutic targets. This study was undertaken to identify pAkt-interacting proteins and to assess their biological roles in breast cancer cells.

###begin p 5
We confirmed that one of the pAkt interacting proteins is the Elongation Factor EF1alpha. EF1alpha contains a putative Akt phosphorylation site, but is not phosphorylated by pAkt1 or pAkt2, suggesting that it may function as a modulator of pAkt activity. Indeed, downregulation of EF1alpha expression by siRNAs led to markedly decreased expression of pAkt1 and to less extent of pAkt2 and was associated with reduced proliferation, survival and invasion of HCC1937 cells. Proliferation and survival was further reduced by combining EF1alpha siRNAs with specific pAkt inhibitors whereas EF1alpha downregulation slightly attenuated the decreased invasion induced by Akt inhibitors.

Conclusion
###end title 6
###begin p 7
We show here that EF1alpha is a pAkt-interacting protein which regulates pAkt levels. Since EF1alpha is often overexpressed in breast cancer, the consequences of EF1alpha increased levels for proliferation, survival and invasion will likely depend on the relative concentration of Akt1 and Akt2.

Breast cancer is the most common cancer among women in the European Union: each year, 60,000 women die of breast cancer and 150,000 new cases are diagnosed. Proliferation and survival of breast cancer cells are regulated by steroid hormones, growth factors and their receptors through the activation of signal transduction pathways which, in many cases, are aberrantly activated [1]. The phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase (PI-3K) pathway has crucial roles in breast cancer [2], and can be altered at multiple levels, including mutations of the PI-3K catalytic subunit [3] or of its "upstream" or "downstream" regulator/effectors such as PTEN and AKT [4,5]. Akt/PKB is a serine/threonine kinase that has attracted much attention because of its central role in regulating several cellular processes such as proliferation, angiogenesis, motility and survival [6]. Activation of Akt in breast cancer portends aggressive tumour behaviour, resistance to hormone-, chemo-, and radiotherapy-induced apoptosis and it is correlated with decreased overall survival [7]. Recent studies have identified novel tumor-specific substrates of Akt that may provide new diagnostic and prognostic markers and serve as therapeutic targets [8]. In light of the central role of Akt in the regulation of cell survival, specific inhibitors of this kinase might induce apoptosis when used alone or in combination with standard cancer chemotherapeutics. In this regard, suppression of Akt activity by small molecule allosteric inhibitors [9] sensitizes many tumour cell lines to apoptotis induced by DNA damage, microtubule-binding agents, targeted therapeutics and ionizing radiation [10] suggesting that Akt inhibitors may enhance the efficacy of chemotherapy and radiotherapy in breast cancer. However, the use of Akt inhibitors in anti-cancer therapies should take into account that neoplastic cells express variable levels of Akt isoforms that may have different functions, including the distinct ability of pAkt1 or pAkt2 to regulate migration and invasion of breast cancer cells [11,12].

This study was undertaken to identify additional pAkt-interacting proteins and to assess their biological roles in breast cancer cells. To this end, we used anti-pAkt immunoprecipitation followed by mass spectrometry of pAkt-associated proteins; of several interacting proteins containing putative Akt phosphorylation sites (RXRXX S/T Psi), we selected for further studies the eukaryotic Elongation Factor 1 alpha (EF1alpha).

EF1alpha consists of two isoforms, EF1alpha1 and EF1alpha2, that share >90% sequence identity and have the same function in mRNA translation [13], but markedly different expression patterns [14,15]. Both proteins appear to be involved in tumour development and progression [16] and, relative to normal tissues, expression of EF1alpha1 and EF1alpha2 is more abundant in breast cancer samples [17]. Since EF1alpha1 is expressed at high levels in normal breast tissues while EF1alpha2 is barely detectable, overexpression of EF1alpha2 is more likely be biologically relevant in breast cancer. Recent studies have also correlated the expression of EF1alpha2 with ER/HER-2 expression, lymph node status, survival, tumor size and p53 mutations [17,18].

###begin p 12
In this study, we investigated the functional relationship between EF1alpha and Akt and the biological consequences of downregulating EF1alpha expression for proliferation, survival and invasion of breast cancer cells. We show here that EF1alpha binds only to pAkt but is not an in vitro substrate of active Akt1 or Akt2. Downregulation of EF1alpha expression led to decreased expression of pAkt1 and to less extent of pAkt2, inhibited proliferation, colony formation and invasion and promoted apoptosis of HCC1937 cells. The combination of EF1alpha siRNA with pAkt inhibitors further reduced proliferation, survival and clonogenic potential of HCC1937 cells, suggesting that these effects are, in part, Akt-independent; downregulation of EF1alpha expression attenuated the inhibition of cell motility induced by Akt inhibitors, consistent with the possibility that complete inhibition of pro-metastatic Akt1 activity by EF1alpha RNAi promotes a slight increase in the invasiveness of HCC1937 cells. Together, these observations suggest that EF1alpha is a regulator of Akt activity and that the biological consequences of modulating EF1alpha expression in breast cancer cells reflect Akt-dependent and -independent mechanisms.

To identify novel pAkt- interacting proteins in breast cancer cells, proteins associated with pAkt were analyzed by mass spectrometry. To this end, whole lysates from HCC1937 or SkBr3 breast cancer cells were immunoprecipitated with an anti-pAkt antibody and the pAkt interactome was compared to that from anti-Akt1/Akt2 immunoprecipitates (IPs) of pAkt-depleted lysates (data not shown). Proteins interacting with pAkt in SkBr3 cells were also identified by comparing the anti-Akt IPs of untreated cells and of cells treated with the dual pAkt1/pAkt2 (pAkt1/2) Merck's inhibitor [9]. The anti-Akt IPs were then subjected to 2-D electrophoresis and visualized by silver staining (data not shown). Together, these two procedures allowed us to identify several proteins preferentially or exclusively present in the pAkt interactomes.

To confirm the interaction between pAkt and EF1alpha, anti-pAkt and anti-Akt1/2 IPs from pAkt-depleted SkBr3 cell lysate were subjected to western blotting with an anti-EF1alpha antibody. EF1alpha was detected as a 50 kDa band only in the anti-pAkt IPs (Fig. 1b and 1c). Co-immunoprecipitation/Western blot experiments performed in HCC1937 cells showed identical results (see Additional File 1).

Interaction between EF1alpha and Akt in SkBr3 cells. SkBr3 whole cell lysates and lysates of SkBr3 cells subjected to anti-pAkt (Ser473) IP in saturating conditions to deplete the active kinase were immunoprecipitated with anti-pAkt or anti-Akt1/Akt2 antibody, respectively. IPs were separated in two equal amounts and subjected to SDS-PAGE and western blotting using anti-Akt1/2 (panel b) and anti-pAkt (panel c) antibodies to distinguish pAkt and unphosphorylated Akt and to avoid superimposition of adjacent bands and background interference. Levels of associated EF1alpha were also detected in both membranes. Western blots show: (a) expression of pAkt and EF1alpha in whole cell and p-Akt-depleted lysates. Expression of beta-Actin was used as loading control; expression of total Akt (Akt1/Akt2) and EF1alpha (b) or of pAkt and EF1alpha (c) in the anti-pAkt and in the anti-Akt (Akt1/Akt2) IPs from p-Akt-depleted SkBr3 cell lysate. In the anti-Akt1/2 IPs obtained after pAkt depletion, levels of residual pAkt (panel c) were negligible.

Treatment with the Akt1/2 inhibitor led to complete disappearance of pAkt in the HCC1937 cell lysate (Fig. 2a, lane 3); instead, levels of pAkt in lysate of cells treated with the Akt2 inhibitor were still detectable (Fig. 2a, lane 2), suggesting that they represent residual pAkt1 and that Akt2 is the predominantly phosphorylated isoform in HCC1937 cells. Levels of EF1alpha, total Akt1 and total Akt2 remained constant after treatment with the inhibitors (Fig. 2a, lanes 1-3). EF1alpha was detectable in the anti-Akt2 IPs from untreated cells and, at lower levels, in the anti-Akt2 IP from lysate of Akt inhibitor-treated cells (Fig. 2a, lanes 5 and 6) suggesting that low levels of pAkt2 are still present in the anti Akt2 immunocomplex from Akt inhibitor-treated cells.

EF1alpha was also found in the anti-Akt1 IP (Fig. 2a, lane 7), and formation of the complex appears to depend on Akt1 phosphorylation since the amount of immunoprecipitated EF1alpha was markedly reduced in cells treated with the Akt1/2 inhibitor (Fig. 2a, lane 9).

Ectopically expressed Myr-Akt1 was abundantly phosphorylated (anti-phospho Ser473 western blotting) and interacted with endogenous EF1alpha (Fig. 2c, lane 2); by contrast, the double mutant T308A/S473A Akt1 was not phosphorylated and failed to interact with EF1alpha (Fig. 2c, lane 3).

Thr308 is phosphorylated by PDK1 directly [20], while Ser473 is phosphorylated by TORC2, a complex of four proteins [21]; thus, we began to investigate the role of EF1alpha in Akt activation by assessing whether it forms a complex with PDK1. Upon transfection in SkBr3 cells, FLAG-tagged PDK1 was in complex with endogenous EF1alpha and pAkt but not with beta-actin (Fig. 4c), raising the possibility that EF1alpha interacts with PDK1 facilitating Akt\phosphorylation at Thr308.

To investigate the role of EF1alpha for breast cancer cell survival, colony formation of HCC1937 cells was assessed after treatment with the EF1alpha siRNA. 24 h after transfection, 3,000 cells were plated in 60-mm diameter dishes and colonies were counted 14 days later. The number of colonies formed by EF1alpha siRNA-transfected HCC1937 cells was approximately 30% lower of that from non-transfected parental cells or cells transfected with CTRL siRNA (Fig. 5) and the difference was statistically significant [Student's t-test, P < 0.05]. A similar inhibitory effect of the EF1alpha siRNA (approximately 27%) was also observed in soft agar colony formation assays (see Additional File 4). To determine whether further suppression of pAkt activity could enhance the inhibitory effect of the EF1alpha siRNA on colony formation, HCC1937 cells were transfected with EF1alpha siRNA or CTRL siRNA and 24 h later seeded in 60-mm diameter dishes (3,000 cells/dish) in the presence of pAkt inhibitors and assessed in clonogenic assays (Fig. 5). Cells transfected with EF1alpha siRNA and treated with the Akt1/2 inhibitor formed 38% fewer colonies than cells treated with CTRL siRNA only, 8% fewer colonies than cells treated with the EF1alpha siRNA and 18% fewer colonies than cells treated with CTRL siRNA and the Akt inhibitors. Downregulation of EF1alpha expression and pAkt activity also led to reduced colony formation of SkBr3 cells (see Additional File 5).

To assess whether inhibition of EF1alpha expression affects the proliferation of HCC1937 cells, we compared the cell cycle activity of CTRL- and EF1alpha siRNA-transfected HCC1937 cells by DNA content analysis. As shown in Table 1, inhibition of EF1alpha expression by EF1alpha RNAi induced a modest increase in the proportion of G1 cells and a correspondent decrease in S phase cells, in comparison to HCC1937 cells transfected with the CTRL siRNA. Compared to CTRL siRNA-transfected cells, a higher fraction of cells transfected with the EF1alpha siRNA had a subG1 DNA content (1.8% vs 5%) which is indicative of apoptosis.

EF1alpha binds to actin filaments and microtubules and is involved in actin cytoskeleton remodelling [22,23]. Furthermore, ectopic EF1alpha2 expression significantly enhanced migration of BT549 breast cancer cells [19]. To assess whether endogenous levels of EF1alpha were required for breast cancer cell invasion, HCC1937 cells were transfected with the EF1alpha siRNA to knock-down EF1alpha expression and invasion tested using Matrigel-coated transwell chambers. Compared to HCC1937 cells transfected with the CTRL siRNA, those transfected with the EF1alpha siRNA showed approximately a 50% decrease in migration [Student's t-test, P < 0.05]; by contrast, invasion of CTRL siRNA-transfected HCC1937 cells was only slightly reduced compared to parental HCC1937 cells, probably reflecting transfection toxicity in this assay (Fig. 6).

The goal of the present study was to identify novel pAkt- interacting proteins and to assess their role in breast cancer cells. To this end, pAkt-interacting proteins were identified by anti-pAkt immunoprecipitation and 2-D electrophoresis followed by in-gel digestion and mass spectrometry analysis of spots exclusively or predominantly present in the pAkt interactome; we reasoned that a protein interacting with pAkt could be a substrate or a modulator of Akt activity. One of the pAkt interacting proteins identified in the proteomic analyses was EF1alpha. While we were investigating the interaction of EF1alpha with Akt, Lau et al. [25] showed that EF1alpha co-immunoprecipitates with HA-tagged Akt2, possibly through a complex with beta-tubulin. In our mass spectrometry analysis, the presence of EF1alpha in the pAkt interactome was confirmed in several experiments, but beta-tubulin was not detected, suggesting that EF1alpha and pAkt can also interact independently of beta-tubulin.

Since our anti-pAkt antibody does not distinguish between the pAkt isoforms, we used antibodies specific for the Akt 1 or the Akt2 isoform and specific Akt kinase inhibitors to assess the presence of EF1alpha in the Akt1 and Akt2 interactome of HCC1937 cells.

These analyses revealed that the interaction between Akt2 and EF1alpha depends on the phosphorylation status of Akt2, the most abundant and active isoform in HCC1937 cells and in breast cancer tumors [26]. A similar phosphorylation-dependent mechanism is also involved in the Akt1-EF1alpha interaction, since endogenous EF1alpha was in complex with Myr-Akt1 but not with the phosphorylation-deficient double mutant T308A/S473A Akt1.

Since abnormal Akt activation is well documented in many human malignancies [7] and EF1alpha might have oncogenic effects in breast cancer [17,28], the interaction between EF1alpha and pAkt2 (and/or pAkt1) could represent an important mechanism for the regulation of Akt-dependent signaling pathways in cancer.

Although EF1alpha associates with pAkt1 and pAkt2 and contains a putative Akt phosphorylation site, our "in vitro" kinase assays indicate that is not an Akt substrate. However, down-regulation of EF1alpha expression by RNAi led to decreased pAkt expression with an apparently more pronounced effect on the Akt1 isoform, consistent with the reported Akt activation by ectopic EF1alpha2 expression [19].

Downregulation of EF1alpha expression diminished the clonogenic potential of HCC1937 and SkBr3 cells, suggesting that EF1alpha regulates this aspect of breast cancer cell phenotype; suppression of Akt activity by Akt inhibitors induced only a modest but not statistically significant decrease of colony formation and combining the EF1alpha siRNA with Akt inhibitors had only a modest additive effect.

Since the role of pAkt-substrates in cell cycle progression and apoptosis is well established [2,29,30], the effect of EF1alpha downregulation on the cycle distribution of HCC1937 cells could be due to decreased Akt activity. However, the effect of EF1alpha siRNA was more potent than that pharmacological inhibition of pAkt1/pAkt2 and was amplified by simultaneous treatment with the pAkt1/pAkt2 inhibitors.

EF1alpha depletion by RNA-interference also decreased the invasion of HCC1937 cells, suggesting that EF1alpha might have a role in tumor metastasis. Previous studies have shown a functional relationship between EF1alpha expression and invasion; in particular, expression of EF1alpha2 appears to increase cell migration, EF1alpha mRNA levels correlate with increased metastatic potential in mammary adenocarcinoma and EF1alpha protein is overexpressed in metastatic compared to non metastatic cells [16,19,31] However, Kulkarni et al. [18] reported that EF1alpha2 expression is associated with good prognosis and suggested that EF1alpha2 may not be able to activate an effective metastatic program. The modest effect of EF1alpha downregulation on the metastatic potential of HCC1937 cells is likely to reflect the partial inhibition of pro-metastatic pAkt2 more than loss of anti-metastatic pAkt1 as pAkt2 is the predominant Akt isoform in HCC1937 cells. Consistent with this interpretation, direct inhibition of Akt activity by the Akt inhibitors used here suppressed the invasiveness of HCC1937 cells more efficiently than EF1alpha downregulation and the specific Akt2 inhibitor was slightly more potent of the dual Akt1/Akt2 inhibitor, a finding in keeping with Akt1 and Akt2 having distinct roles in regulating the motility of breast cancer cells [11,31,32]. The simultaneous EF1alpha depletion and pAkt inhibition did not reduce further the invasiveness of HCC1937 cells; if anything, the effect of the Akt inhibitors was attenuated by EF1alpha downregulation, consistent with a more profound inhibition of anti-metastatic pAkt1. However, the effect of active Akt1 on migration and invasion might be cell line and/or cell-type specific [32,33], raising the possibility that downregulation of EF1alpha might have different effects on the migration of other cancer lines, depending on the relative concentration and activity of Akt isoforms. Since the differences in migration induced by the combination of EF1alpha siRNA and the Akt inhibitors were modest (only that between CTR siRNA plus Akt2 inhibitor versus EF1alpha siRNA plus Akt2 inhibitor was statistically significant), it is also possible that they reflect experimental variability.

Conclusion
###end title 64
###begin p 65
In summary, we have shown that EF1alpha is a pAkt-interacting protein which modulates the activity of pAkt1 and pAkt2 and regulates the proliferation, survival and motility of breast cancer cells. Our results are consistent with previous studies suggesting that EF1alpha promotes tumorigenesis and indicate that expression of EF1alpha is required for many properties of breast cancer cells via Akt-dependent and -independent mechanisms. The Akt-dependent effects of EF1alpha may be, in part, due to the concentration of Akt isoforms, suggesting that investigating the mechanisms responsible for differential Akt isoform expression may be necessary to further understand the role of EF1alpha in the biology of breast cancer cells.

Transfection of siRNA oligos was carried out with Lipofectaminetrade mark 2000 (Invitrogen). Cells were incubated for 24, 48, 72 and 96 h post-transfection and EF1alpha expression was detected by western blotting. Fluorescent oligos were used to determine uptake efficiency and set optimal lipofection conditions.

24 h after transfection, HCC1937 cells were trypsinized, counted, suspended in 15% conditioned medium and seeded for colony formation assays in 60-mm dishes at 3,000 cells per dish. To test the effect of Akt inhibitors, cells were seeded in medium supplemented with pAkt inhibitors (7 muM in DMSO) in the dark; equal volume of DMSO was used in control experiments. After incubation for 14 days, colonies (>30 cells) were stained with crystal violet and counted. Three different experiments were performed in triplicate.

Cell migration was analyzed with the BioCoat Matrigel Invasion Chambers (BD, Becton-Dickinson, San Jose, CA, USA). Control, siRNA-transfected and Akt inhibitor-treated HCC1937 cells were seeded at 40,000 cells in each upper chamber in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 5% FBS. Lower chambers were filled with 750 mul of 5% conditioned medium of confluent HCC1937 cells containing 10% of FBS as a chemoattractant. Chambers were incubated for 22 h at 37degreesC in a humidified 5% CO2 atmosphere, then cells in the upper chamber were removed. Cells adherent to the lower surface of the membrane were fixed with methanol and stained with crystal violet. Cells migrated to the lower surface of the filter were considered to have invaded through the overlying matrix and were counted.

Adherent cells were trypsinized, centrifuged at 1000 g for 5 min, fixed in ice-cold 70% ethanol and incubated at -20degreesC for 2 h. Cells were centrifuged, resuspended in PBS and incubated with RNAse A (200 mug/ml) for 30 min at room temperature; then, cells were incubated with propidium iodide (50 mug/ml) for 30 min at room temperature in the dark. Quantification of sub-2N DNA was determined by flow cytometry using Coulter Epics XL (Beckman Coulter, Fullerton, CA).
