We have investigated in detail the secondary and tertiary structures of E. coli 16S rRNA binding site of protein S15 using a variety of enzymatic and chemical probes. RNase T1 and nuclease S1 were used to probe unpaired nucleotides and RNase V1 to monitor base-paired or stacked nucleotides. Bases were probed with dimethylsulfate (at A(N-1), C(N-3) and G(N-7)), with 1-cyclohexyl-3 (2-(1-methylmorpholino)-ethyl)-carboiimide-p- toluenesulfonate (at U(N-3) and G(N-1)) and with diethylpyrocarbonate (at A(N-7)). The RNA region corresponding to nucleotides 652 to 753 was tested within: (1) the complete 16S rRNA molecule; (2) a 16S rRNA fragment corresponding to nucleotides 578 to 756 obtained by transcription in vitro; (3) the S15-16S rRNA complex; (4) the S15-fragment complex. Cleavage and modification sites were detected by primer extension with reverse transcriptase. Our results show that: (1) The synthetized fragment folds into the same overall secondary structure as in the complete 16S rRNA, with the exception of the large asymmetrical internal loop (nucleotides 673-676/714-733) which is fully accessible in the fragment while it appears conformationally heterogeneous in the 16S rRNA; (2) the reactivity patterns of the S15-16S rRNA and S15-fragment complexes are identical; (3) the protein protects defined RNA regions, located in the large interior loop and in the 3'-end strand of helix [655-672]-[734-751]; (4) the protein also causes enhanced chemical reactivity and enzyme accessibility interpreted as resulting from a local conformational rearrangement, induced by S15 binding.
