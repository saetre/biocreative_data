We have isolated a cDNA clone for the beta-subunit of HeLa cell Na,K-ATPase, containing a 2208-base-pair cDNA insert covering the whole coding region of the beta-subunit. Nucleotide sequence analysis revealed that the amino acid sequence of human Na,K-ATPase exhibited 61% homology with that of Torpedo counterpart (Noguchi et al. (1986) FEBS Lett. in press). A remarkable conservation in the nucleotide sequence of the 3' non-coding region was detected between the human and Torpedo cDNAs. RNA blot hybridization analysis revealed the presence of two mRNA species in HeLa cells. S1 nuclease mapping indicated that they were derived from utilization of two distinct polyadenylation signals in vivo. Total genomic Southern hybridization indicated the existence of only a few, possibly one set of gene encoding the Na,K-ATPase beta-subunit in the human genome.
