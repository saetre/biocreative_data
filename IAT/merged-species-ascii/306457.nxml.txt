A 230 kb genomic region from the Duchenne muscular dystrophy gene has been cloned in a cosmid walk, using an improved vector and by screening the same unamplified library for all steps. The region cloned surrounds the translocation breakpoint characterized by Worton et al and Ray et al, and overlaps by 70 kb the Pert region cloned by Monaco et al. We have identified a region of strong sequence conservation in mammals and chicken, and comparison of the homologous sequences in chicken and man has indicated the presence of two putative protein coding exons. Comparison with the sequence recently published by Koenig et al shows that only one is present in the Duchenne cDNA, and this raises the question of the functional significance of the other conserved sequence. Single copy probes and whole cosmids generated during this work have been used to analyse the corresponding region in Duchenne patients. Of five independant patients shown to be deleted for a probe 30 kb in 3' of the translocation breakpoint, three have the 5' endpoint of the deletion within a region of less than 20 kb, 100 kb away from the probe used to ascertain the deletion. This might suggest the presence of a region where deletions occur preferentially.
