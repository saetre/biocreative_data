Experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) induced by myelin oligodendrocyte protein (MOG) in female Dark Agouti (DA) rats is a chronic demyelinating animal model of multiple sclerosis (MS). To identify new candidate molecules involved in the evolution or repair of EAE-lesions we used Affymetrix oligonucleotide microarrays to compare the spinal cord transcriptome at the peak of EAE, during remission and at the first relapse with healthy DA rats.

Among approximately 26,000 transcripts studied more than 1,100 were differentially regulated. Focussing on functional themes, we noticed a sustained downregulation of most of the transcripts of the cholesterol biosynthesis pathway. Furthermore, we found new candidate genes possibly contributing to regenerative processes in the spinal cord. Twelve transcripts were solely upregulated in the recovery phase, including genes not previously associated with repair processes. Expression of SLPI was upregulated more than hundredfold during EAE attack. Using immunohistochemistry, SLPI was identified in macrophages, activated microglia, neuronal cells and astrocytes. Incubation of adult neural stem cells (NSC) with recombinant SLPI resulted in an increase of cell proliferation and of differentiation towards oligodendrocytes. These processes were paralleled by an upregulation of the cell-cycle promotor cyclin D1 and a suppression of the cell differentiation regulator HES1. Finally, SLPI prevented the degradation of IkappaBalpha, which may explain the suppression of the cell differentiation inhibitor HES1 suggesting a possible mechanism of oligodendroglial differentiation.

Conclusion
###end title 9
###begin p 10
We identified novel features of gene expression in the CNS during EAE, in particular the suppression of genes of cholesterol biosynthesis and a strong upregulation of SLPI, a gene which is for the first time associated with autoimmune inflammation. The capacity of SLPI to increase proliferation of adult NSC and of oligodendroglial differentiation suggests a novel role for SLPI in the promotion of tissue repair, beyond its known functions in the prevention of tissue damages by protease inhibition damage and modulation of inflammatory reactions.

Experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) represents a variety of animal models reflecting clinical and pathological characteristics of multiple sclerosis (MS). MS is presumably a autoimmune CNS disease with stepwise or chronic progressive evolution of inflammation, demyelination, axonal injury and oligodendrocyte death intertwined with the nervous system's attempts to repair damage and regain homeostasis. The complexity of these processes remains a formidable obstacle to the elucidation of the primary and driving pathogenetic events [1].

Transcriptome studies of CNS tissue in MS and EAE probing many thousand gene products in parallel have resulted in interesting and unexpected target molecules possibly suitable for therapeutic trials in MS [2,3]. Most studies describing the transcriptional spinal cord profile in EAE have been performed in murine models [4-9]. EAE induced by myelin oligodendrocyte protein (MOG) in the rat represents a spectrum of diseases mimicking various forms of MS pathology depending on the selection of strain, gender and experimental procedures, respectively. In female Dark agouti (DA) rats, a chronic relapsing EAE variant can be induced, characterized by widespread demyelination, axonal damage and remyelination [10]. MOG has been recognized as a particularly likely candidate for an initial antigen-specific attack in the CNS during MS, and T- and B-cell responses to MOG have been identified in MS-patients and in EAE [11-13]. This report presents for the first time spinal cord transcriptional data of a chronic EAE model in the rat. We compared the mRNA expression profile of more than 26,000 transcripts in spinal cords of DA rats by a large scale gene expression approach using the DNA microarray technique. Expression profiling from spinal cord tissue comparing rats with EAE and healthy control rats was performed in three distinct stages of disease evolution, i.e. acute, recovery and relapsing phases of EAE. More than 1,100 significantly regulated transcripts were identified. While confirming well-established features of EAE, we identified several differentially upregulated transcripts not described previously. In more detail, we examined the secretory leukocyte protease inhibitor (SLPI) representing the most strongly upregulated gene in this study. SLPI is a homeostatic protein known to be expressed at mucosal surfaces by epithelial cells, macrophages and neutrophils. It is involved in the resolution of inflammation by suppressing protease activity, by attenuating innate immune responses and by inhibiting the activation and proliferation of B cells [14,15]. In the CNS its induction has been reported as a consequence of ischemic stroke [14] and spinal cord injury [16]. In this study we provide evidence that SLPI promotes oligodendroglial proliferation and differentiation. We suggest that SLPI may have a novel and multiple roles in CNS inflammation, i.e. inhibition of pathogenic proteases, immunomodulation and promotion of CNS repair.

DA rats were perfused with PBS to remove circulating blood cells and their spinal cords and inguinal lymph nodes were collected. Total RNA was extracted from lumbar spinal cords and lymph nodes, respectively, using the RNeasy Lipid Tissue Midi Kit (Qiagen) and examined for signs of degradation with the Bioanalyzer 2100 (Agilent Technologies). All further preparation steps were performed at the "Centre of Excellence for Fluorescent Bioanalytics" (KFB, Regensburg, Germany). Isolated RNA was processed according to the standard Affymetrix protocol. Hybridization, washing and staining of Affymetrix rat U34 arrays were carried out following manufacturer's instructions. In brief, double stranded cDNA was generated from 10 mug RNA with the Superscript Double-Stranded cDNA Synthesis Kit (Invitrogen). The High Yield RNA Transcript Labeling Kit (Enzo Life Sciences) was used to obtain biotinylated cRNA. The three Affymetrix arrays RG U34A-C were consecutively hybridised with the samples in a rotating chamber (16 h, 45degreesC). The arrays were scanned by the G2500A GeneArray Scanner (Affymetrix).

Transcripts found in the spinal cord of EAE animals are expressed in either CNS resident cells or infiltrating leukocytes. As an approximation to focus on the subset of transcripts derived from CNS resident cells and infiltrating cells "responding" to EAE, genes expressed in lymph node cells (LNC) were in silico subtracted from the list of genes expressed in the spinal cords of EAE animals. "Lymph node transcripts" were compiled by hybridization of microarrays with RNA from inguinal lymph nodes of five untreated, healthy DA rats as described above.

Afterwards, the cells were washed in TBS buffer and blocked with a TBS-solution containing 1% bovine serum albumin (BSA) and 0.2% Teleostean gelatin (fish gelatin buffer (FGB), Sigma). The same solution was used during the antibody staining. Fluorochrome-conjugated secondary antibodies were used for immunodetection. The following antibodies and final dilutions were used: primary antibodies: rabbit anti-GFAP 1:1000 (DAKO), rabbit anti-GalC 1:200 (Chemicon), mouse anti-betaIII-tubulin 1:500 (clone 5G8, Promega); secondary antibodies: donkey anti-mouse or anti-rabbit conjugated with Alexa Fluor(R) 488 (Molecular Probes). Nuclear counterstaining was performed with 4', 6'-diamidino-2-phenylindole dihydrochloride hydrate (DAPI, Sigma) at 0.25 mug/ml. Specimens were mounted on microscope slides. To assess cell death, 50 mug/ml propidium iodide (PI, Sigma) was added to the culture medium.

The intention of the study was to compare the spinal cord gene expression profile at three different clinical stages of EAE with the transcriptome of naive rats. Therefore, female DA rats immunised with recombinant MOG-protein were sacrificed during (1) the acute phase of EAE defined as the first EAE attack leading to a clinical score of at least three (n = 3, days 11 and 12), (2) the recovery phase, i.e. the first day at which the rats began to gain weight after the acute phase (n = 3, days 13 and 14), and (3) the relapsing phase, i.e. during a second acute exacerbation after temporary recovery (n = 4, days 24 and 25) (Figure 1). In addition three untreated, healthy control rats were used.

According to our selection criteria (signal ratio >/= 2 & p-value </= 0.01) 1,165 significantly regulated probe sets were identified. During the acute disease phase 499 probe sets were differentially regulated, during the recovery phase 731 and only 200 in the relapsing phase (Table 2). A principal component analysis of the samples revealed that the hybridization patterns of the rat group sacrificed in the relapsing phase were more heterogeneous than the other groups examined (Figure 2). The heterogeneity of pathogenic events during the relapsing phase may explain the lower number of genes detected as significantly regulated in that group.

In order to get an estimation of the grade of reliability of our expression data, we compared them with previously published expression data from MS samples or murine EAE. We detected a high number of regulated genes indicating common features of CNS inflammation; e.g. increased expression of genes associated with antigen processing [Additional file 1], antigen presentation (Table 3) or of other genes expressed by immune cells [Additional file 2]. Furthermore we detected a suppression of myelin gene expression (Table 4). All four gene groups are regulated in the same manner in MS or in murine EAE models [4-9]. We also found some upregulated transcripts whose relevance for the development of autoimmune inflammation has recently been reported, e.g. the induction of BAFF and CXCL13 (Figure 4G &4H) [27], jagged1 [28] and arginase 1 [29], respectively. While confirming the consistency of our data, these results suggest that many pathological processes of MS are reproduced by all EAE models studied so far including EAE in the DA rat as presented here.

Transcripts expressed in the spinal cord of EAE rats are derived either from CNS-resident cells or from infiltrating leukocytes. In order to focus on the regulation of genes expressed by CNS-resident cells and by activated infiltrating cells ("EAE-response CNS genes"), we subtracted genes with expression detectable in lymphoid tissue from the complete list of genes expressed in the spinal cord.

Genes presumably expressed by non-activated infiltrating leukocytes were identified in parallel experiments by hybridization of Affymetrix microarrays with RNA from inguinal lymph nodes of untreated DA rats (n = 5). Subtraction resulted in a list of ~1,500 transcripts of EAE-response CNS genes expressed in the spinal cord in at least one of the examined disease phases. This included 184 transcripts differentially expressed during the disease course according to the selection criteria (fold change > 2 & p-value < 0.01, Table 5). According to a hierarchical clustering performed with dchip2006, 29 of these transcripts showed a marked upregulation during the acute phase [Additional file 3]. Several among these transcripts, notably glycoprotein 49B1, alanyl aminopeptidase (CD13) and lipocalin 2, while not expressed in the lymph nodes of naive DA rats, are reportedly associated with various activated leukocyte populations [30-32]. This indicates that our subtraction algorithm indeed identified transcripts not constitutively found in naive or non-activated lymphoid cells but up-regulated upon activation.

A large group of genes expressed by CNS-resident cells was suppressed during all examined disease phases. This included transcripts encoding for ion channel and transporter proteins (e.g., Slc12a2, Slc24a2, Slco1c1 or Cplx1) and regulators of synaptic transmission (e.g. Gabbr1, Ache, Syn2, Reep1, Magi2, Snap25 or Sh3gl2). These findings suggest a profound and sustained impairment of neuronal signal transmission during the course of EAE. The persistent suppression of transcripts for MOG, myelin basic protein (MBP), myelin-associated oligodendrocytic basic protein (MAG) and oligodendrocyte-myelin glycoprotein (OMG) indicates dysfunction or even loss of oligodendrocytes, putative primary targets of the immune response in EAE (Table 4).

Upregulation of CNS genes in the recovery phase but not in the acute phase suggests a potential contribution to repair processes [4]. Twelve CNS-specific genes showed this expression profile (Table 6). Some of these genes had been described to be involved in repair or regenerative processes within the CNS before (Map2c (Microtubule-associated protein 2) [33], Id4 (Inhibitor of DNA binding 4) [34], Ednrb (Endothelin receptor B) [35], Cdh22 (Cadherin 22) [36] and Glrx2 (Glutaredoxin 2) [37]. Interestingly, however, the angiogenic growth factor Pdgfd (Platelet-derived growth factor D (also called spinal cord-derived growth factor B)) [38], Pnlip (Pancreatic lipase), the cytokinesis controlling armadillo protein Pkp4 (Plakophilin 4) [39], the peroxysome regulator Pex11a (Peroxisome biogenesis factor 11a) [40] and Hoxb8 (Homeobox B8) have not been associated with repair processes in the CNS yet. Two transcripts of this group are not yet defined (Genbank accession:  and ).

Cholesterol is an essential component of eukaryotic plasma membranes and represents around 30% of the lipid content within the CNS. In the mature CNS, the highest cholesterol content can be found in oligodendrocyte myelin. Cholesterol availability in oligodendrocytes is rate-limiting for myelination [41].

All values are correlated to the expression values of the corresponding gene in the spinal cord of healthy rats. The EAE gene expression was compared to the expression within healthy rats using a paired t test. *: p < 0.05. B: Average cholesterol concentration in spinal cord extracts.

A comparable general decrease of the expression of cholesterol transport proteins was not noticed (Table 8). Rather, apolipoprotein C I (ApoC1) and CD36 were strongly upregulated during the acute disease phase. The expression profile and the known expression pattern of CD36 suggest that its upregulation is probably caused by the immigration of CD36-expressing macrophages into the spinal cord during the acute phase. The expression of the cholesterol carrier apolipoprotein E (ApoE) was increased during the recovery disease phase. The only cholesterol transport genes showing a comparable expression decrease during EAE as the genes of the cholesterol biosynthesis were the Glutamate oxaloacetate transaminase 2, the Low density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR, Figure 4B) and the Oxysterol binding protein-like proteins 1A and 9.

As the transcription of the HMG-CoA reductase or LDLR is inhibited by the presence of cholesterol derivatives, we assessed the total cholesterol concentration in the spinal cord tissue and detected no change of the cholesterol concentration at any time point of EAE (Figure 5B). Hence, the downregulation of the expression of the enzymes of the cholesterol biosynthesis pathway was not associated with a corresponding decrease of cholesterol concentration (Table 8).

The expression of the secretory leukocyte protease inhibitor (SLPI) was approximately 100-fold upregulated during the acute disease phase and more than 10-fold during the recovery and relapsing phases (Figure 4C). Immunohistochemical analyses of spinal cord slices from rats suffering from acute EAE showed a strong SLPI staining restricted to the inflammatory infiltrates. During the relapsing phase the expression pattern of SLPI was more scattered and therefore less associated with inflammatory infiltrates (Figure 6). In spinal cord slices from rats sacrificed during the recovery phase only background staining was seen.

To characterise the cell types expressing SLPI in the CNS, we also performed immunohistochemical studies. During the acute phase of EAE cells SLPI staining mostly colocalised with ED1-positive cells, i.e. macrophages and activated microglia within inflammatory infiltrates (Figure 7). In the recovery phase, we additionally detected SLPI in a high proportion of GFAP-positive astrocytes as well as in sporadic NeuN positive neurons (Figure 7). We did not see costaining with the endothelial cell marker von-Willebrand-factor at any time point.

To determine whether the increased SLPI expression within the spinal cord might contribute to regenerative processes, we incubated multipotent neural stem cells (NSCs) from the subventricular zone of adult Wistar rats [25] for up to seven days in growth medium with varying amounts of SLPI. This resulted in a reproducible augmentation of cell proliferation by more than 100%, quantified by both cell counting and determination of BrdU-positive cells. SLPI-mediated enhancement of proliferation was similar to the well established effect of VEGF on proliferation [42] (Figure 8A). As SLPI has been reported to induce the cell cycle regulator cyclin D1 [43], we assessed its expression in NSC treated with SLPI by RealTime-PCR. Indeed, we found cyclin D1 upregulation in parallel and concomitant with the increase of proliferation when NSC were incubated with 0.5 to 1 mug/ml SLPI (Figure 8B). SLPI antibodies could prevent the cyclin D1 induction caused by recombinant SLPI confirming the specificity of the effects of recombinant SLPI (Figure 9).

We then compared SLPI's effects on neural stem cells with those of the protease inhibitor alpha1-antitrypsin (alpha1-AT). Some of the features of SLPI are paralleled by alpha1-AT, e.g. it induces the hepatocyte growth factor [44] and inhibits the chemotaxis of neutrophils [45] as well as acute inflammatory responses [46]. Interestingly, alpha1-AT did not induce the expression of cyclin D1 (Figure 8C), thereby suggesting that the promotion of cell proliferation cannot only be attributed to SLPI's protease inhibiting activity.

SLPI inhibits the degradation of IkappaBalpha in monocytes thereby promoting its accumulation within the cell [47]. We observed a reduction of TNFalpha-induced IkappaBalpha degradation by SLPI in NSC (Figure 10A). By binding to the promoter of the cell differentiation suppressor HES1 (Hairy/enhancer of split, drosophila, homolog of, 1) IkappaBalpha represses its expression independent of NFkappaB [48]. We determined the expression of the Notch-target gene HES1 in NSCs treated again with SLPI and detected a significant downregulation of HES1 mRNA in the SLPI cultures (Figure 10B).

As HES1 inhibits the differentiation of NSCs [49], we finally asked whether SLPI influences the cell fate of the NSCs. After incubating NSCs for three days with SLPI in growth medium and another seven days in differentiation medium, we noticed almost no change of the number of GFAP expressing astrocytes and of betaIII-tubulin expressing neurons, but a significant dose-dependent increase of oligodendrocytes expressing GalC. SLPI did not influence the survival of NSCs as indicated by a propidium iodide staining (Figure 11). This implies that the SLPI-mediated increase of Gal-C-positive cells was not caused by increased survival or decreased cell death.

In this study we examined the transcriptional profile of mRNA isolated from spinal cord tissue of MOG-induced EAE in DA rats. Comparable approaches have been adopted in several murine EAE models before (e.g. [4,6,8,9,18,19,50]). In contrast to prior studies, however, we selected a chronic rat EAE model for a genome-wide analysis of the CNS expression profile. We compared the transcriptomes of the acute, recovery and relapsing phases of EAE with the transcriptome of untreated, healthy rats and with each other to detect new EAE-associated genes and elucidate their relative importance for disease processes, in particular recovery and repair. More than 1,100 differentially expressed genes were identified. To overcome the statistical problems caused be the analysis of only three animals per disease phase, we performed quantitative RealTime-PCRs for selected targets using rats which have not been sacrificed for microarray hybridizations. Importantly, the microarray data were generally validated by RealTime-PCR.

Common features of CNS inflammation were observed, confirming data from other EAE-models and providing an external validation of our analyses, e.g. the upregulation of genes associated with protein catabolism and antigen presentation [6,20], the downregulation of oligodendrocyte-specific genes [20,51] or of genes involved in synaptic transmission [4].

This group includes transcripts differentially regulated in CNS-resident cells [4] and genes de novo induced in populations of activated immigrated leukocytes. As a consequence, this algorithm does not reveal genes constitutively expressed in LNC and up- or downregulated at the time of disease.

We identified 12 genes which were upregulated in the recovery phase but not during the acute phase. The exclusive expression of a gene during the recovery phase may implicate a role for the corresponding gene product in regeneration. Indeed, five among these genes have already been linked to neuroprotective or repair processes within the CNS, albeit not in EAE. For example, glutaredoxin 2 protects neuronal cells in vitro from death by excitotoxicity [37]. The expression of map2c might be associated with developing neurons and with nerve cell survival during stress [33]. Id4 is an important factor for neuronal differentiation [34] and has been described as an oligodendrocyte differentiation inhibitor during maturation [52]. Id4 might therefore contribute to the block of oligodendrocyte differentiation known to be operative in autoimmune CNS inflammation. These molecules and of the other transcripts shown in Table 6 warrant further investigation. Interestingly, plakophilin 4 (p0071) influences the activity of presenilin 1 [53] that in turn controls the activity of notch receptors contributing to the inhibition of the maturation of oligodendroglial progenitor cells in EAE [54].

The downregulation of virtually all genes of the cholesterol biosynthesis during lesion evolution of autoimmune CNS inflammation has not been described previously. So far, only the suppression of HMG-CoA reductase and of squalene monooxidase has been reported, occurring in inflammatory lesions of more than 75% of MS patients [20]. Of note, the expression of genes involved in extra- and intracellular transport of cholesterol was not affected in a similar manner, largely excluding sustained damage of cholesterol synthesising cells within the CNS. Our findings might indicate a feedback inhibition of cholesterol synthesis, because the overall cholesterol concentration in the spinal cord remained unchanged during all stages of EAE. The transcription of many genes of the cholesterol biosynthesis pathway, including the HMG-CoA Reductase and LDL receptor is negatively regulated by the presence of cholesterol or its derivatives [55,56]. Both molecules have been found to be suppressed in our study. The downregulation of the genes of the cholesterol biosynthesis pathway including the HMG-CoA Reductase might be of special interest, because HMG-CoA Reductase Inhibitors (Statins) are assumed to ameliorate the MS disease by modulating e.g. the activity of T cells and of microglial cells or by enhancing the survival of oligodendroglial progenitor cells [57].

The secretory leukocyte protease inhibitor (SLPI) is an 11.7 kDa protein originally identified in parotid gland secretions, in seminal fluid, and in cervical, nasal and bronchial mucous. Later it was also found in human neutrophils, peritoneal macrophages, and in astrocytes and neurons under ischemic conditions [14]. SLPI has been recognised as a potent inhibitor of leukocyte serine proteases, including elastase and cathepsin G from neutrophils, chymase and tryptase from mast cells, as well as trypsin and chymotrypsin from pancreatic acinar cells, respectively [58]. In addition, SLPI suppresses bacterial growth [59] and inhibits HIV-1 infection of macrophages [60]. By inhibiting the degradation of IkappaB, SLPI appears to exert anti-inflammatory functions on macrophages, neutrophils and B cells [15,61]. SLPI reduces inflammatory gene expression and diminishes inflammatory cell accumulation after hepatic and lung injuries [62,63].

Notably, SLPI also promotes the proliferation of epithelial cells [43] and of haematopoietic stem cells [64]. Mice deficient in SLPI show impaired cutaneous wound healing with increased inflammation and TGF-beta activity, as well as increased elastase activity [65]. The expression of SLPI is highly upregulated within ischemic brain tissue, where it has been ascribed a neuroprotective role, possibly because of rapid inhibition of activated proteases and its suppression of inflammatory responses [14].

In this study, microarray and RealTime-PCR analyses revealed SLPI to be the most strongly induced gene within the spinal cord during EAE. Using immunohistochemistry we detected a strong staining for SLPI protein in association with perivascular infiltrates. In accordance with findings reported for ischemic brain tissue [14], we detected SLPI protein in neurons and astrocytes, but found it also colocalised with markers for activated macrophages or microglial cells.

We asked whether the SLPI overexpression in the spinal cord during EAE might support cell renewal in the CNS. Interestingly, SLPI induced and increased proliferation of adult NSCs, associated with the selective induction of the growth-promoting factor cyclin D1. The latter effect is probably not caused solely by SLPI's inhibitory action on proteases, because alpha1-antitrypsin, a comparable protease inhibitor [46], did not cause a similar upregulation of cyclin D1. Rather, the inhibition of the IkappaBalpha degradation by SLPI [66] and its occupancy of NFkappaB binding sites [61], resulting in diminished activity of NFkappaB, may provide an explanation for our observation. This hypothesis is further supported by the inhibition of TNFalpha-induced IkappaBalpha degradation and the suppression of the cell cycle regulator HES1 in SLPI treated NSC cultures. IkappaBalpha suppresses the expression of HES1 independently of NFkappaB by binding to the HES1 promoter [48]. HES1 suppression, however, is expected to enhance differentiation of neural stem cells [67].

Interestingly, SLPI treatment promoted dose-dependently the differentiation of NSCs towards Gal-C expressing oligodendrocytes. We did not detect population-specific differences in cell survival, thereby excluding a selective survival advantage of differentiating oligodendrocyte precursors. The dose-dependency of SLPI's effects have been described before and explained by opposing effects of SLPI's direct promoter activity and its inhibition of the nuclear translocation of NFkappaB [43,66]. It is rather tempting to envisage SLPI involved in remyelination by promoting the maturation of progenitor cells towards mature myelinating cells. Furthermore, by inducing factors like HGF (hepatocyte growth factor) SLPI might also act as a chemoattracting factor guiding NSC to the lesions [44,68]. These questions will be addressed in forthcoming studies.

We identified novel features of gene expression in the CNS during EAE, in particular the suppression of genes of cholesterol biosynthesis and a strong upregulation of a gene not previously associated with autoimmune inflammation in the CNS but with potential relevance for both control of inflammation and tissue destruction as well as promotion of tissue repair. We suggest that SLPI, by promoting the proliferation of adult NSCs and their differentiation towards oligodendroglial cells, may contribute to repair processes in vivo, expanding its functional spectrum beyond protease inhibition, prevention of tissue damage and modulation of inflammation.
