We reported that the RFP gene encodes a protein with putative zinc finger domains and was involved in the activation of the ret proto-oncogene. To further characterize the RFP protein, we developed a polyclonal antibody against the product synthesized from a fragment of the RFP cDNA expressed in Escherichia coli. Western blot analysis showed that RFP was identified as a 58 kDa protein in cell lysates from four human and rodent cell lines and from mouse testis. In addition, a unique 68 kDa protein was detected in the testis. Using AH7974 (rat ascites hepatoma) and Raji (human Burkitt lymphoma) cells, we demonstrated strong association of RFP with the nuclear matrix. Furthermore, RFP solubilized from the nuclear matrix had DNA-binding activity although it appears to bind more preferentially to double-stranded DNA than to single-stranded DNA. These results thus suggest that RFP may play a role in molecular processes which occur in the nuclear matrix.
