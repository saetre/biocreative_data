In this report we describe the analysis of an advanced intercross line (AIL) to confirm the quantitative trait locus (QTL) regions found for fatness traits in a previous study. QTL analysis was performed on chromosomes 1, 3, 4, 15, 18, and 27. The AIL was created by random intercrossing in each generation from generation 2 (G2) onwards until generation 9 (G9) was reached. QTL for abdominal fat weight (AFW) and/or percentage abdominal fat (AF%) on chromosomes 1, 3 and 27 were confirmed in the G9 population. In addition, evidence for QTL for body weight at the age of 5 (BW5) and 7 (BW7) weeks and for the percentage of intramuscular fat (IF%) were found on chromosomes 1, 3, 15, and 27. Significant evidence for QTL was detected on chromosome 1 for BW5 and BW7. Suggestive evidence was found on chromosome 1 for AFW, AF% and IF%, on chromosome 15 for BW5, and on chromosome 27 for AF% and IF%. Furthermore, evidence on the chromosome-wise level was found on chromosome 3 for AFW, AF%, and BW7 and on chromosome 27 for BW5. For chromosomes 4 and 18, test statistics did not exceed the significance threshold.
