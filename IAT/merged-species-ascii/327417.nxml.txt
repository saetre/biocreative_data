We have constructed a library of Balb/c mouse embryo DNA in the vector Charon 4A. The library was searched for sequences homologous to the VH region of a cloned cDNA of the UPC10 heavy chain mRNA. In this paper, we describe the structure and the partial nucleotide sequence of one of such clones (VH441). The nucleotide sequence of this germ-line gene indicates that it encodes amino-acids 1-98 of the X44 and J601 galactan-binding VH regions, but that it differs from the UPC10 VH segment by four single base changes. The VH gene appears to contain a 101 bases long intervening sequence within a precursor sequence identical to the precursor sequence of UPC10. The 3' non coding sequence of the V gene contains the two conserved sequences found in embryonic V DNA segments, CACAGTG and ACATGAACC, separated by 23 nucleotides and a sequence CACTGTG separated by 33 nucleotides from the first heptamer.
