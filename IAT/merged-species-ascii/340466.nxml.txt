We have determined the sequence of the E. coli gyrB gene, using a new sequencing approach in which transposition from a mini-Mu plasmid into the DNA provides random start points for dideoxynucleotide sequence analysis. The gyrB sequence corresponds to a protein 804 amino acids long; a previously isolated protein fragment with partial enzymatic activity has been identified as the C-terminal half-molecule. A plausible terminator of gyrB transcription is located just beyond the structural gene.
