The use of live microorganisms to influence positively the course of intestinal disorders such as infectious diarrhea or chronic inflammatory conditions has recently gained increasing interest as a therapeutic alternative. In vitro and in vivo investigations have demonstrated that probiotic-host eukaryotic cell interactions evoke a large number of responses potentially responsible for the effects of probiotics. The aim of this study was to improve our understanding of the E. coli Nissle 1917-host interaction by analyzing the gene expression pattern initiated by this probiotic in human intestinal epithelial cells.

Whole genome expression analysis revealed 126 genes specifically regulated after treatment of confluent Caco-2 cells with E. coli Nissle 1917. Among others, expression of genes encoding the proinflammatory molecules monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 ligand 2 (MCP-1), macrophage inflammatory protein-2 alpha (MIP-2alpha) and macrophage inflammatory protein-2 beta (MIP-2beta) was increased up to 10 fold. Caco-2 cells cocultured with E. coli Nissle 1917 also secreted high amounts of MCP-1 protein. Elevated levels of MCP-1 and MIP-2alpha mRNA could be confirmed with Lovo cells. MCP-1 gene expression was also up-regulated in mouse intestinal tissue.

Probiotic microorganisms have traditionally been characterized as viable nutritional agents conferring benefits to the health of the human host [1]. The definition of the term "probiotic" has evolved through the years. The latest and most appropriate definition describes probiotics as "live microorganisms which when administered in adequate amounts confer a health benefit on the host" [2]. Beneficial activities of probiotics most likely result from complex interactions of the microorganisms with the intestinal microflora and the gut epithelium of the individual [3]. A proposed mechanism by which probiotics mediate their effects is the modulation of the innate immune response both to antiinflammatory [4] and proinflammatory directions. Furthermore, probiotic bacteria have been shown to enhance the adaptive immune response and antibody formation [7,8]. Inhibition of adherence of attaching and effacing organisms [9], modulation of the mucosal barrier function [10,11] as well as inhibition of neutrophil migration [12] may also be important mechanisms whereby probiotics can impact in intestinal diseases.

Next to lactic acid bacteria and the probiotic yeast S. boulardii, the non-pathogenic E. coli strain Nissle 1917 (EcN) of serotype O6:K5:H1 is one of the best characterized probiotics. EcN was originally isolated by the army surgeon Dr. Alfred Nissle in 1917 from the feces of a soldier who did not develop diarrhea during a severe outbreak of shigellosis [13]. A controlled clinical trial published recently implies probiotic EcN being as effective as standard medication with a dose of 1,5 g/day mesalazine in remission maintenance of ulcerative colitis. In this study recurrance rates were 33.9% for mesalazine treatment compared to 36.4% for treatment with EcN (Mutaflor(R)) [14]. Recently, we have demonstrated, that recombinant EcN had no effect on migration, clonal expansion and activation status of specific CD4+ T cells, neither in healthy mice nor in animals with acute colitis [15]. Despite the successful therapeutic applications of EcN, only limited information is available about the beneficial traits contributing to the strains' probiotic character. Several strain specific characteristics have been detected so far including expression of two microcins [16], presence of six iron-uptake systems or lack of defined virulence factors [17]. Moreover, EcN exhibits a unique semirough lipopolysaccharide phenotype, responsible for its serum sensitivity [18,19]. All these properties might be advantageous for EcN in competing with other colonic bacteria or adapting to the intestinal situation. However, the mechanisms underlying the probiotic nature, especially at the molecular level, yet have to be elucidated.

In this study we aimed to analyze the genomic expression program initiated by the interaction of probiotic EcN with human intestinal epithelial cells. Our results demonstrate a transient proinflammatory signaling of human and mouse intestinal epithelial cells illustrated by induced gene expression of MCP-1, MIP-2alpha and MIP-2beta after treatment with EcN.

E. coli strain Nissle 1917 was isolated from a tablet of Mutaflor(R) (Ardeypharm, Herdecke, Germany) cultured on MacConkey plates (Oxoid, Wesel, Germany). The isolate was serotyped and confirmed by EcN specific PCR [22]. E. coli K12 laboratory strain MG1655 was kindly provided by Ulrich Dobrindt (Institute for Molecular Infection Biology, Wurzburg, Germany). Both strains were grown overnight in Luria Bertani (LB) medium (Invitrogen) at 37degreesC on a shaker. The cultures were then diluted 1:100 in 50 ml prewarmed IMDM medium containing 10% fetal calf serum and grown at 37degreesC. Bacteria were harvested in late logarithmic phase, after reaching an OD600 = 1.

RNA from cells and tissue was extracted using TriFast FL (PEQLAB, Erlangen, Germany) according to the manufacturer's protocol, following DNAse I digestion with DNA-free(R) (Ambion, Huntingdon Cambridgeshire, UK). Samples were pooled prior to reverse transcription with 200 U Superscript II(R) (Invitrogen) for 45 minutes at 42degreesC in 20 mul assays containing 1 mul Oligo dT-primers and 10 mM deoxynucleoside triphosphates (dNTPs). Conventional PCR was performed with AmpliTaq Gold(R) DNA polymerase (Applied Biosystems, Darmstadt, Germany) in 20 mul assays containing 0.25 pmol primers and 0.5 mM dNTP using the following cycling conditions: Activation of Taq polymerase for 10 minutes at 95degreesC, followed by a first round of 10 cycles each consisting of a 30 second denaturing interval at 95degreesC, a 90 second annealing step at the respective primer Tm and a primer extension at 72degreesC for again 90 seconds. This first amplification step was followed by a second round of 27 cycles, consisting of 15 seconds denaturation, 45 seconds annealing and 90 seconds extension. PCR products were separated in 2% agarose gels and visualized by ethidium-bromide staining. All primers used in this study are listed in table 1.

Quality and integrity of the total RNA isolated from 1 x 106 cells was controlled by running all samples on an Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies, Waldbronn, Germany). For biotinylated target synthesis, RNA was labeled using standard protocols supplied by the manufacturer (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA). Briefly, 5 mug total RNA was converted to dsDNA using 100 pmol of a T7T23V primer (Eurogentec, Seraing, Belgium) containing a T7 promoter. The cDNA was then used directly in an in vitro transcription reaction in the presence of biotinylated nucleotides. The concentration of biotin-labeled cRNA was determined by UV absorbance. In all cases, 12.5 mug of each biotinylated cRNA preparation were fragmented and placed in a hybridization cocktail containing four biotinylated hybridization controls (BioB, BioC, BioD, and Cre) as recommended by the manufacturer. Samples were hybridized to an identical lot of Affymetrix HG_U133A arrays for 16 hours. After hybridization, the GeneChips were washed, stained with strepavidin-phycoerythrin and read using an Affymetrix GeneChip fluidic station and scanner.

Analysis of microarray data was performed using Affymetrix Microarray Suite 5.0, Affymetrix MicroDB 3.0 and the Affymetrix Data Mining Tool 3.0. For normalization all array experiments were scaled to a target intensity of 150, otherwise using the default values of the Microarray Suite. Results were filtered as follows: Genes are considered strongly regulated when their fold change is greater than or equal 2 or less than or equal -2, the statistical parameter for a significant change is less than 0.01 (change p-value for changes called increased) or greater than 0.99 (change p-value for changes called decreased). Additionally, the signal difference of a certain gene should be greater than 100. Genes are considered as weakly regulated when their fold change is greater than or equal 1.5 or less than or equal -1.5, the statistical parameter for a significant change is less than 0.001 or greater than 0.999 and the signal difference of a certain gene should be greater than 40.

Total RNA preparation and cDNA synthesis were performed as described for RT-PCR. Quantitative real-time RT-PCR was done with an ABI PRISM cycler (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) using SYBR Green PCR kit from Stratagene and specific primers optimized to amplify 90 - 250 bp fragments from the genes under investigation (Tab. 1). A threshold was set in the linear part of the amplification curve, and the number of cycles needed to reach it was calculated for every gene. Relative mRNA levels were determined by using included standard curves for each individual gene and further normalization to the housekeeping gene RPS9. Melting curves established the purity of the amplified band.

After coincubation, cells were washed three times with 1 x PBS and fixed with a fixation solution containing 5% formaldehyde and 2% glutaraldehyde in cacodylate buffer (0.1 M cacodylate, 0.01 M CaCl2, 0.01 M MgCl2, 0.09 M sucrose, pH 6.9), washed with cacodylate buffer and then with TE-buffer (10 mM TRIS, 2 mM EDTA, pH 6.9). Finally, cells were scratched from the wells, pelleted and embedded in 2% aqueous agar before dehydrating with a graded series of acetone (10, 30, 50, 70, 90, 100%) on ice for 30 min at each step. Samples in 100% acetone were allowed to reach room temperature before another change of 100% acetone. They were then subjected to critical-point drying with liquid CO2 (CPD 030, BAL-TEC, Schalksmuhle, Germany). The dried cells were covered with a gold film of about 10 nm by sputter coating (SCD040, BAL-TEC) before examination in a field emission scanning electron microscope Zeiss DSM 982 Gemini (Carl Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany) using the Everhart Thornley SE detector and the inlens detector in a 50:50 ratio at an acceleration voltage of 5 kV. Data were stored digitally on MO-disks.

Among the 22,000 genes and expressed sequence tags present on Affymetrix HG_U133A arrays, we identified 138 sequences differentially expressed upon treatment of confluent Caco-2 cells with EcN. Due to some genes being repeatedly present on the array, we finally found a total of 126 individual genes to be regulated. They belonged to a wide variety of gene classes (Fig. 1). From the coding sequences that could be assigned to one of these classes, 17% pertained to signaling pathways. The remainder of the genes encoded for molecules involved in protein folding and biosynthesis (10%), transcription and translation (10%), transport (8%), metabolism (6%) as well as energy pathways (5%), immune response (4%) proliferation (3%), differentiation (1%) and apoptosis (1%). A better part of them, like genes coding for hypothetical proteins and unannotated ORFs, could not be allocated to one of the classes and was therefore assigned as others (35%). Selected genes of each class, that showed at least a two fold regulation in one of the two experiments, were summarized in table 2. 9 of these genes were selected for further investigations. They were choosen on the basis of both, prominent changes in their gene expression profiles and their putative biological implication at the outset of our study. Significantly elevated mRNA levels were found for dual-specificity phosphatase 5 (DUSP5), chemoattractant protein-1 ligand 2 (MCP-1), macrophage inflammatory protein-2 alpha (MIP-2alpha), macrophage inflammatory protein-2 beta (MIP-2beta), tumor necrosis factor alpha induced protein 3 (TNFalphaIP3) and ets domain transcription factor ELF3. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), active in angiogenesis, vasculogenesis and endothelial cell growth, was up-regulated as well. Yet another gene, up-regulated by EcN treatment, was human nuclear factor of kappa light chain gene enhancer in B cells inhibitor alpha (NFkappaBIA), which inhibits the action of NF-kappaB [25]. Downregulation of gene expression was observed for epithelial membrane protein 3 (EMP3). The mRNA expression levels of these genes were validated by real-time RT-PCR. The entire data set of our microarray experiments is accessible as MIAME format online with accession number GSE2232 [48].

Electron micrographs of the coculture experiments are shown in figure 2A. Panel A I illustrates untreated Caco-2 cells. Cells coincubated with E. coli MG1655, serving as control strain, and EcN are depicted in panels A II and A III, respectively. Array data for MCP-1, MIP-2alpha, MIP-2beta, DUSP5, ELF3 and NFkappaBIA were verified by real-time RT-PCR (Fig. 2B). The strongest up-regulation of mRNA expression, compared to control cells, could be detected for MCP-1. There was a 103 fold increase, compared to an mRNA level elevated only 8 fold after treatment with E. coli MG1655. Additionally, gene expression levels of MIP-2alpha, MIP-2beta and DUSP5 were more than 20 fold higher than the controls, when Caco-2 cells were treated with EcN. Array data obtained for TNFalphaIP3 and VEGF could also be confirmed by real-time RT-PCR, but the increase in mRNA levels was almost identical for Caco-2 cells treated with E. coli MG1655 or EcN. Therefore, up-regulation of TNFalphaIP3 and VEGF could not be considered to be an EcN specific effect. We were not able to verify down-regulation of EMP3 by real-time RT-PCR as indicated by our array data (data not shown). In summary, the regulation pattern of EcN-treated Caco-2 cells compared to treatment with E. coli MG1655 after 6 hours coculture suggested a specific EcN-mediated up-regulation of MCP-1, MIP-2alpha, MIP-2beta, DUSP5, NFkappaBIA and ELF3 expression in human intestinal epithelial cells.

Supernatants from Caco-2 cells cocultured with EcN and E. coli MG1655 were analyzed for several cytokines. Compared to untreated Caco-2 cells and cells treated with E. coli MG1655, coculture with EcN significantly increased release of MCP-1 protein (Fig. 3), indicating an EcN specific up-regulation of this proinflammatory molecule. Additionally, EcN treatment of Caco-2 cells resulted in an increased secretion of IP-10 (interferon gamma-inducible cytokine IP-10; data not shown).

To exclude that the EcN specific up-regulation of proinflammatory molecules MCP-1 and MIP-2alpha was a feature specific for Caco-2 cells, coculture experiments were performed with the human colon adenocarcinoma cell line Lovo. Therefore, confluent Lovo cells were cocultured with EcN or E. coli MG1655 for 6 hours, respectively. As already documented for Caco-2 cells, EcN again provoked a strong specific up-regulation of these two proinflammatory molecules. The gene expression level of MCP-1 was 89 fold higher compared to control cells, whereas treatment with E. coli MG1655 resulted in a 9 fold increase (Fig. 4). In addition, MIP-2alpha was 15 fold up-regulated after treatment with EcN in comparison to a 2 fold elevation mediated by E. coli MG1655. Results obtained from conventional RT-PCR also revealed an EcN specific induction of MIP-2beta (data not shown). Consequently, up-regulation of MCP-1 and MIP-2alpha after treatment with EcN was not a feature of one cell line but rather a general EcN specific effect on human intestinal epithelial cells.

Subsequently, we measured time kinetics of gene expression of selected proinflammatory molecules. Extended treatment of Caco-2 cells with EcN or E. coli MG1655 for another 24 or 48 hours revealed that EcN-mediated gene expression of MCP-1, DUSP5 and NFkappaBIA peaked after 6 hours and returned to base levels after 24 hours (Fig. 5). In contrast, expression of MIP-2alpha and MIP-2beta increased further and reached maximum values after 24 hours. However, longer incubation with EcN resulted again in a decreased MIP-2alpha and MIP-2beta gene expression. E. coli MG1655 influenced the expression of most of the selected genes just slightly at any time, but revealed a peak for MIP-2beta expression after 24 hours, similar to EcN (Fig. 5), suggesting that the observed time course of regulation of this proinflammatory cytokine was not EcN specific.

We also aimed to elucidate whether the observed EcN specific expression of selected genes was merely a result of contact between bacterial surfaces and Caco-2 cells and additionally, whether the secretion of active bacterial metabolites was required for the EcN specific induction of the selected genes. Hence, Caco-2 cells were either cocultured with inactivated bacteria or conditioned media (CM) as described in Materials and Methods. Our results indicated that culturing of Caco-2 cells with bacteria CM did not lead to an EcN specific regulation of the selected genes in Caco-2 cells (Tab. 3). Thus, EcN apparently did not secrete active metabolites responsible for specific gene expression. Additionally, for the induction of MCP-1 and NFkappaBIA gene expression (Fig. 2B) live bacteria were necessary, as no EcN specific gene expression could be measured after exposure of Caco-2 cells to inactivated bacteria (Tab. 3). In contrast, mRNA levels achieved by incubation with formalin killed EcN for MIP-2alpha, MIP-2beta, EMP3, DUSP5 and ELF3 were equivalent to live bacteria. Incubation over 24 h (data not shown) led to a decrease of EcN specific gene expression correlating with the data presented in figure 5. These results suggested that the effect of EcN on the gene expression profile of Caco-2 cells was not only dependent on one single pathway but a combined action of viable bacteria and membrane bound or secreted factors.

Our results indicate that the EcN mediated expression of proinflammatory molecules was a short- time effect (Fig. 5). After investigation of the influence of EcN on human cell lines, we next examined the effect of EcN on mouse intestinal epithelial layer. Cima et al. described an efficient method for the differential isolation of intestinal epithelial cells along the villus-crypt axis of the small intestine [23]. Using a modification of this method, pieces of small intestine were cocultured with EcN or E. coli MG1655 for 6 hours to analyze the impact of EcN on mouse primary tissue culture. Several reasons prompted us to use small intestinal tissue for these experiments. Since contact between bacteria and intestinal epithelial cells was a required condition for the impact of EcN, a smooth removal of the mucus layer was necessary. This is ensured for small intestine as it has a thinner mucus layer than the colon [26]. Additionally, the murine small intestine is nearly bacteria-free in contrast to a high bacterial density in the colon [26]. Thus, the use of small intestine for primary tissue culture enabled a specific bacteria-cell interaction in contrast to the colon. In order to maintain an intact cell organization and to prevent any stress that might influence the cellular gene expression profile, small tissue pieces were used. Real-time RT PCR revealed a 23 fold increase of MCP-1 expression after treatment with EcN compared to non-treated tissue (Fig. 6). In contrast to EcN, coculture with E. coli MG1655 yielded an elevated mRNA level of only 4 fold confirming our results obtained from experiments with confluent human cell lines. Summarized, our data obtained from primary mouse tissue culture confirmed the data of cell culture experiments with two human intestinal epithelial cell lines and corroborated the finding that EcN was able to specifically provoke a proinflammatory host response.

Our results demonstrate that EcN up-regulates gene expression of molecules involved in pro- as well as antiinflammatory processes. A proinflammatory response of intestinal epithelial cells to EcN was mainly demonstrated by the temporary up-regulation of MCP-1 gene expression in confluent human cell lines and in primary mouse tissue culture as well as by an increased secretion of this chemokine. This EcN specific change of MCP-1 gene expression could neither be induced with bacteria conditioned media nor with formalin inactivated organisms suggesting that for EcN mediated MCP-1 gene expression viable bacteria are necessary. MCP-1 is produced by many cells, including epithelial, endothelial and mast cells as well as tumor cells, and shows chemotactic activity for monocytes, basophils, natural killer cells and T lymphocytes during inflammation. Among other things, MCP-1 influences the release of specific enzymes of these target cells [27-30]. MCP-1 is expressed under many pathological conditions, including asthma and inflammatory bowel diseases [31,32]. Infection of human macrophages, which have a central role in innate immune response to bacteria, with non-pathogenic Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG, results in an enhanced MCP-1 expression and an induction of T helper cell type 1 (Th1) cell migration [33]. Earlier this year, Lan et al. have shown that exposure of primary murine colonic epithelial cells to the same Lactobacillus strain also resulted in an exclusive induction of MCP-1 and MIP-2alpha expression [34]. Moreover, it has been reported, that lactobacilli are able to activate myeloid dendritic cells that skew CD4+ and CD8+ T cells to Th1 and Tc1 polarization [35]. Earlier studies have shown that MCP-1 expression also shifts the immune response towards release of Th2 cytokines [36] and thus can potentially affect antibacterial defenses. Although it seems unexpected at first sight that the probiotic EcN up-regulates MCP-1 mRNA expression and protein secretion, an important role of this proinflammatory molecule might be established in protecting the host from bacterial infection through induction of a strong T cell immune response, thus providing a reasonable explanation for the EcN induced expression of this chemokine. The neutrophil attracting chemokines MIP-2alpha and MIP-2beta represent two additional genes involved in inflammatory processes and are exhibiting a number of immunoregulatory activities. Both of which showed an increased expression in our coculture experiments after 6 hours, reaching peak levels after 24 hours. Subcutaneous injection of MIP-2 into footpads of C3H/HeJ mice elicited an inflammatory response characterized by neutrophil infiltration, suggesting MIP-2 to be an endogenous mediator playing a role in the host response during inflammatory processes [37]. The MIP-2 expression of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) or IL-1beta stimulated intestinal epithelial cells is amplified by butyrate, a metabolite of nonpathogenic, resident bacteria. This is a potential mechanism by which resident bacteria may regulate inflammatory processes in the small intestine [38]. In contrast to MCP-1, EcN mediated expression of MIP-2alpha and MIP-2beta seemed to be independent on the viability of the probiotic in our experiments, as inactivated bacteria induced gene expression as well. Thus, it appears that EcN can induce a potent proinflammatory cytokine response which is in part dependent on the viability of the bacteria. It can be speculated that the local induction of proinflammatory immune responses within the intestinal immune system characterized by up-regulation of MCP-1, MIP-2alpha and MIP-2beta upon contact with probiotic EcN might reflect being part of the host defense process against pathogenic bacteria through the establishment of a protective immunological barrier. However, further in vitro and especially in vivo experiments are needed to provide evidence that such mechanisms are part of the repertoire of protective responses exhibited by EcN in the intestine.

The transcription factor NF-kappaB and the corresponding pathway play an important role in proinflammatory signaling [39,40]. Prevention of the NF-kappaB translocation into the nucleus by the IkappaB proteins NFkappaBIA and NFkappaBIB leads to inhibition of NF-kappaB, followed by suppression of proinflammatory genes. In our experiments up-regulated gene expression of the transcription inhibitor NFkappaBIA could be observed. It can be assumed that the observed EcN specific chemokine expression is induced via a NF-kappaB independent pathway. The JNK/AP-1 signaling cascade is a likely candidate, since transcription and secretion of MCP-1 can also be activated through this pathway triggered by TLR4 signaling [41]. It is a well-known fact that toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) and 5 (TLR5) recognize LPS [42] and bacterial flagellin [43,44], respectively. Both receptors induce among others the transcription of MCP-1, MIP-2alpha and MIP-2beta [45]. Induction of DSS colitis in TLR4-/- mice led to an altered neutrophil recruitment due to diminished MIP-2 expression by lamina propria macrophages. Thus, TLR4 participates in the intestinal immune response to luminal bacteria and the development of colitis [46]. Since both, EcN and E. coli MG1655 possess flagellin and LPS, it can be speculated that an additional component of EcN not yet identified is able to induce MCP-1 gene expression. However, the semirough O6 lipopolysaccharide phenotype of EcN, which is different from O6 LPS of uropathogenic E. coli and which is responsible for serum sensitivity of EcN [19], might also play a role in this context.

Even though the proinflammatory activity of EcN, manifested by MCP-1 gene expression and protein secretion, appears surprising at first sight, the genome content of this probiotic strain offers explanations for its proinflammatory properties. Genome comparisons of probiotic EcN and the uropathogenic E. coli (UPEC) strain CFT073 as recently published by our laboratory [47] and Grozdanov et al. [17] revealed a high degree of homology between these two strains. The existence of about 130 "common virulence factors" in probiotic EcN, as defined by the PRINTS protein fingerprint database, suggests that these proteins cannot be considered as virulence factors per se, but may also contribute to the general fitness of EcN [47].

The results of our study revealed that EcN specifically upregulated genes in confluent human intestinal epithelial cell culture. The majorities of these genes were proinflammatory cytokines or belonged to inflammatory pathways. These surrogate in vitro markers of probiotic activity of EcN need to be corroborated in other model systems to test their in vivo relevance. Additionally, the cell culture model described here will serve as a readout, to evaluate the impact of potential probiotic genes and gene products of EcN, which will consecutively be identified, when our genome sequencing project is finished.
