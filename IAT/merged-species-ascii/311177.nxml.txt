The aminoacylation kinetics of T7 transcripts representing defined regions of Escherichia coli serine tRNAs were determined using purified E.coli seryl-tRNA synthetase (SerRS) and the kinetic values were used to estimate the relative contribution of various tRNA(Ser) domains to recognition by SerRS. The analysis revealed that the extra stem/loop structure, characteristic of type II tRNAs such as tRNA(Ser), is the domain which makes the largest contribution to kcat/Km of aminoacylation. Moreover, Km of aminoacylation was increased by a factor of about 1000 when the extra stem/loop was changed to the consensus sequence of type I tRNA extra loops indicating that the stem structure contributes significantly to the binding of tRNA(Ser) to SerRS. A model RNA, which represents only the tRNA(Ser) coaxial acceptor-T psi C stem/loop domain, was also specifically aminoacylated by SerRS having a kcat/Km about 1000-fold greater than background levels. A significant portion of the contribution of this domain to aminoacylation is attributable to the acceptor stem sequence making the acceptor stem the second most important domain for recognition by SerRS. Finally, kcat/Km was essentially unchanged when the entire anticodon stem/loop of tRNA(Ser) was deleted indicating that neither the anticodon nucleotides nor the surrounding stem/loop structure are important for recognition by SerRS.
