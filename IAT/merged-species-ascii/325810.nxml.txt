A novel mutation in the anticodon stem of E. coli tRNA1Tyrsu3+ (G43 to U43) has been characterized. The gene coding for the mutant tRNA, carried by phage phi 80DHA61.3 a derivative of phi 80psu3+su0, produces only 20% of mature suppressor tRNA as compared with phi 80psu3+. Both the mutant tRNA precursor and mature tRNA have an altered conformation. The precursor tRNA coded for by phi 80DHA61.3 is processed by RNase P more slowly than the su3+ precursor and does not form as stable an enzyme-substrate complex as does su3+ precursor. phi 80 DHA61.3 also contains a large deletion which begins in the spacer region between the su3+ gene and the su0- gene, extends through the su0- gene and includes most of the repeated region following the tRNA genes.
