We have determined the complete nucleotide sequence (-865 to +3515) of the murine alpha B-crystallin/small heat shock protein gene, a major soluble protein of the vertebrate eye lens. Its 3 exon/2 intron structure is identical to that of the rat, hamster and human gene, with the exons being much more conserved than the introns. Previous reports indicated that there are two sizes of alpha B-crystallin mRNA; a larger alpha B-crystallin mRNA predominates in the lung and brain and is also found in low levels in most other tissues (except in lens and liver), while a smaller alpha B-crystallin mRNA exists at a high level in the lens and in variable amounts elsewhere. Sequence analysis suggests that secondary structure in the 5' untranslated sequence of the longer mRNA has led to difficulty in mapping the transcription initiation site of the longer transcript. Here we provide evidence by primer extension, S1 nuclease protection, and PCR (polymerase chain reaction) experiments for a transcription initiation site in the murine lung and brain at position -474. We also detected the utilization of the -474 initiation site in lens and of the +1 site in lung and brain, indicating that the tissue preference for these sites is not absolute. In vitro transcription experiments revealed that cell-free HeLa nuclear extracts specifically initiate transcription at the -474 and +1 sites. alpha B-crystallin was immunocytochemically localized to the bronchioles of the lung. Thus, regulation of alpha B-crystallin/small heat shock protein expression involves the utilization of tissue-preferred transcription initiation sites.
