The function in splicing of a heterodimeric nuclear cap binding complex (yCBC) from the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae has been examined. Immunodepletion of splicing extracts with antibodies directed against one component of the complex, yCBP80, results in the efficient co-depletion of the second component, yCBP20, producing CBC-deficient splicing extract. This extract exhibits strongly reduced splicing efficiency and similar reductions in the assembly of both spliceosomes and of the earliest defined precursors to spliceosomes, commitment complexes. The addition of highly purified yCBC substantially restores these defects. These results, together with other data, suggest that CBCs play a highly conserved role in the recognition of pre-mRNA substrates at an early step in the splicing process.
