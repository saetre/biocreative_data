We have constructed a clone which over-produces a 33 kDa protein representing the C-terminal portion of the Escherichia coli DNA gyrase A subunit. This protein has no enzymic activity of its own, but will form a complex with a 64 kDa protein (representing the N-terminal part of the A subunit) and the gyrase B subunit, that will efficiently catalyse DNA supercoiling. We show that the 33 kDa protein can bind to DNA on its own in a manner which induces positive supercoiling of the DNA. We propose that the 33 kDa protein represents a domain of the gyrase A subunit which is involved in the wrapping of DNA around DNA gyrase.
