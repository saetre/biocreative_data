cDNA clones coding for the A alpha- and gamma-chains of human fibrinogen have been isolated from an adult liver cDNA library. Clones were identified by hybridisation with mixtures of synthetic oligonucleotides 17 bases long, predicted using amino acid sequence data for each chain. The cDNA insert sizes are 1,950bp for A alpha-fibrinogen and 950bp for gamma-fibrinogen. The clones do not show any cross-hybridisation. Each cDNA hybridises to a unique sequence in the human genome. In adult human liver, Northern blots give an estimated messenger RNA size of 2.6kb for A alpha-fibrinogen and 1.8kb for gamma-fibrinogen.
