The complex mechanisms underlying homeobox genes expression involve regulation at transcriptional, post-transcriptional and translational levels. The multiple transcripts of the human HOX-5.1 gene are expressed differentially in tissue- and stage-specific patterns during embryogenesis, and differentially induced by retinoic acid (RA) in human embryonal carcinoma (EC) NT2/D1 cells. We have sequenced 6.3 Kb of the genomic region containing the HOX-5.1 gene and analyzed its mechanisms of expression. Two alternative promoters underlie the transcription of two classes of HOX-5.1-specific mRNAs. These classes differ in tissue and subcellular distribution, induction by RA, structure of the 5'-UT region and mRNA stability: these features are compatible with a differential function of the two classes of transcripts in embryogenesis.
