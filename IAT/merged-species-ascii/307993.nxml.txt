The secondary structure of mouse Ehrlich ascites 18S, 5.8S and 28S ribosomal RNA in situ was investigated by chemical modification using dimethyl sulphate and 1-cyclohexyl-3-(morpholinoethyl) carbodiimide metho-p-toluene sulphonate. These reagents specifically modify unpaired bases in the RNA. The reactive bases were localized by primer extension followed by gel electrophoresis. The three rRNA species were equally accessible for modification i.e. approximately 10% of the nucleotides were reactive. The experimental data support the theoretical secondary structure models proposed for 18S and 5.8/28S rRNA as almost all modified bases were located in putative single-strand regions of the rRNAs or in helical regions that could be expected to undergo dynamic breathing. However, deviations from the suggested models were found in both 18S and 28S rRNA. In 18S rRNA some putative helices in the 5'-domain were extensively modified by the single-strand specific reagents as was one of the suggested helices in domain III of 28S rRNA. Of the four eukaryote specific expansion segments present in mouse Ehrlich ascites cell 28S rRNA, segments I and III were only partly available for modification while segments II and IV showed average to high modification.
