The complete nucleotide sequence of the mitochondrial DNA of the amphioxus Branchiostoma lanceolatum has been determined. This mitochondrial genome is small (15 076 bp) because of the short size of the two rRNA genes and the tRNA genes. In addition, this genome contains a very short non-coding region (57 bp) with no sequence reminiscent of a control region. The organisation of the coding genes, as well as of the two rRNA genes, is identical to that of the sea lamprey. Some differences in the repartition of the tRNA genes occur when compared to the lamprey. The mitochondrial codon usage of the amphioxus is reminiscent of that of urochordates since the AGA codon is read as a glycine and not as a stop codon as in vertebrates. Moreover, the base composition at the wobble positions of the codon is strongly biased toward guanine. Altogether, these data clearly emphasise the close relationships between amphioxus and vertebrates, and reinforce the notion that prochordates may be viewed as the brother group of vertebrates.
