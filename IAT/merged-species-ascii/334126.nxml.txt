Genomic clones have been isolated that cover the entire gene for the transcription factor HNF1 (hepatocyte nuclear factor 1). This protein governs the expression of many genes, synthesized in the liver in a tissue-specific manner. We have determined the intron/exon structure of the HNF1 gene, which is strictly conserved between rat and mouse and estimate that it spans not more than 40kb in the rat genome. Whereas most homeoprotein genes do not contain introns within the homeodomain, HNF1 displays an intron between the regions encoding the second and the third helices. We discuss possible evolutionary mechanisms leading to this homeobox intron/exon pattern.
