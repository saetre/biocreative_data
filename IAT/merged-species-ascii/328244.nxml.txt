A complex locus on human chromosome 1 brings together sequences homologous to a G protein and two components of the RNA processing machinery of eukaryotic cells. Specifically, the seventh intron of the human Gi3 alpha gene contains a fusion of a partial snRNP E protein pseudogene to a variant U6 snRNA gene. The novel U6 sequence contains nine point mutations and a one nucleotide deletion relative to the major U6 genes from humans. Unlike all other vertebrate U6 genes characterized to date, the variant U6 gene is efficiently transcribed by RNA polymerase III even in the absence of all natural flanking sequences. The union of elements from the signal transduction pathway and the RNA processing machinery suggests the possibility of functional interplay.
