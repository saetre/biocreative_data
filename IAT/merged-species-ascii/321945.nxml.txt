A fragment of DNA from the yeast nuclear gene MST1 that codes for the mitochondrial tRNAThr1 synthetase was used as a probe to screen for other yeast threonyl-tRNA synthetase genes. At low stringency, the MST1 probe hybridizes strongly to a 6.6 kb EcoRI fragment of yeast genomic DNA with the homologous gene and in addition hybridizes more weakly to a smaller 3.6 kb EcoRI fragment with a second threonyl-tRNA synthetase gene (THS1). To clone THS1, a library was constructed by ligation to pUC18 of size selected (3-4.5 kb) EcoRI fragments of genomic DNA. Several clones containing the 3.6 kb EcoRI fragment were isolated. A 2,202 nucleotide long open reading frame corresponding to THS1 has been identified in the cloned fragment of DNA. The predicted protein encoded by THS1 is 38% identical to the E. coli threonyl-tRNA synthetase over the latter's length (642 amino acids) and is 42% identical to the predicted MST1 product over its 462 residues. In situ disruption of the chromosomal copy of THS1 is lethal to the cell, indicating that this gene codes for the cytoplasmic threonyl-tRNA synthetase.
