The neural cell adhesion molecule (N-CAM) is an important mediator of calcium independent cell-cell interactions. Variations in the primary structure of the protein are due to alternative splicing of pre-mRNA in the region encoding the extracellular, trans-membrane and cytoplasmic domains. In order to identify the patterns of exon usage during development of skeletal muscle and brain of the mouse, a coupled reverse-transcriptase/polymerase chain reaction was used to identify the murine homologues of the muscle-specific domain (MSD), located between exons 12 and 13 in human N-CAM mRNA. The cDNAs produced have been cloned and sequenced, or analysed directly. The amplification reactions were shown to maintain the concentration ratios of the initial cDNAs. The results indicate that the mouse homologue to exon MSD1a is under tissue and developmental regulation that is independent of exons MSD1b and MSD1c. The inclusion of the triplet exon AAG is also regulated in a cell- and stage-specific manner, which is independent of the other alternatively spliced exons of this domain.
