Estrogen receptors (ER) are important regulators of metabolic diseases such as obesity and insulin resistance (IR). While ERalpha seems to have a protective role in such diseases, the function of ERbeta is not clear. To characterize the metabolic function of ERbeta, we investigated its molecular interaction with a master regulator of insulin signaling/glucose metabolism, the PPARgamma, in vitro and in high-fat diet (HFD)-fed ERbeta -/- mice (betaERKO) mice. Our in vitro experiments showed that ERbeta inhibits ligand-mediated PPARgamma-transcriptional activity. That resulted in a blockade of PPARgamma-induced adipocytic gene expression and in decreased adipogenesis. Overexpression of nuclear coactivators such as SRC1 and TIF2 prevented the ERbeta-mediated inhibition of PPARgamma activity. Consistent with the in vitro data, we observed increased PPARgamma activity in gonadal fat from HFD-fed betaERKO mice. In consonance with enhanced PPARgamma activation, HFD-fed betaERKO mice showed increased body weight gain and fat mass in the presence of improved insulin sensitivity. To directly demonstrate the role of PPARgamma in HFD-fed betaERKO mice, PPARgamma signaling was disrupted by PPARgamma antisense oligonucleotide (ASO). Blockade of adipose PPARgamma by ASO reversed the phenotype of betaERKO mice with an impairment of insulin sensitization and glucose tolerance. Finally, binding of SRC1 and TIF2 to the PPARgamma-regulated adiponectin promoter was enhanced in gonadal fat from betaERKO mice indicating that the absence of ERbeta in adipose tissue results in exaggerated coactivator binding to a PPARgamma target promoter. Collectively, our data provide the first evidence that ERbeta-deficiency protects against diet-induced IR and glucose intolerance which involves an augmented PPARgamma signaling in adipose tissue. Moreover, our data suggest that the coactivators SRC1 and TIF2 are involved in this interaction. Impairment of insulin and glucose metabolism by ERbeta may have significant implications for our understanding of hormone receptor-dependent pathophysiology of metabolic diseases, and may be essential for the development of new ERbeta-selective agonists.

In the present study, we demonstrate for the first time a pro-diabetogenic function of the ERbeta. Our experiments indicate that ERbeta impairs insulin sensitivity and glucose tolerance in mice challenged with a high fat diet (HFD). Loss of ERbeta, studied in ERbeta -/- mice (betaERKO mice), results in increased body weight gain and fat deposition under HFD-treatment. Conversely, absence of ERbeta averted accumulation of triglycerides and preserved regular insulin signaling in liver and skeletal muscle. This observation was associated with improved whole-body insulin sensitivity and glucose tolerance. Increased adipose tissue mass in the presence of improved insulin sensitivity and glucose tolerance is usually observed under chronic stimulation of the nuclear hormone receptor PPARgamma. In consonance, we show that activation of PPARgamma was markedly induced in gonadal fat from betaERKO mice and blockade of adipose PPARgamma signaling by antisense oligonucleotide injection reversed the metabolic phenotype. Moreover, our cell culture experiments indicate that ERbeta is a negative regulator of ligand-induced PPARgamma activity in vitro. Finally, we identify SRC1 and TIF2 as key players in the ERbeta-PPARgamma interaction. In summary, the present study demonstrates that ERbeta impairs insulin and glucose metabolism, which may, at least in part, result from a negative cross-talk with adipose PPARgamma.

The estrogen receptors (ERs) are members of the nuclear hormone receptor family (NHR) which act as eukaryotic ligand-dependent transcription factors. ERs are involved in the regulation of embryonic development, homeostasis and reproduction. Two major estrogen receptors, alpha and beta (ERalpha and ERbeta), convey the physiological signaling of estrogens (17beta-estradiol, E2) [1]. Additionally, ERs are activated by specific synthetic ligands such as raloxifene, tamoxifen, the ERbeta-specific ligand diarylpropionitrile (DPN), and the ERbeta-specific agonist propylpyrazole-triol (PPT), which belong to the group of selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMS) [2]-[4].

The prevalence of metabolic diseases such as obesity, insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes has increased dramatically during the recent ten years [5]. Gender differences in the pathophysiology of obesity and metabolic disorders are well established [6]-[8]. However, the molecular mechanisms of sexual dimorphism in metabolic diseases are largely unknown. In addition, lack of ER activation has been implicated in postmenopausal impairment of glucose and lipid metabolism, resulting in visceral fat distribution, insulin resistance and increased cardiovascular risk after menopause [9]. In this context the investigation of ER-signaling and its role in metabolic disorders has gained increasing attention [4],[8].

To identify the ER subtype involved in the regulation of metabolic disorders, studies have been carried out in ER-deficient mice. ERalpha-deficient (alphaERKO) mice have profound insulin resistance and impaired glucose tolerance [10]-[13]. These studies indicate that ERalpha has a protective role in metabolic disorders by improving insulin sensitivity and glucose tolerance. The metabolic function of ERbeta is not clear. ERbeta knockout mice (betaERKO) have a similar body weight and equal fat distribution in comparison to wild type littermates. Additionally, betaERKO and wild-type (wt) mice exhibit similar insulin and lipid levels [14]. However, previous studies in betaERKO mice were only carried out under low fat diet, which may have concealed a phenotype relevant for human obesity normally induced by high-energy/fat diet.

The peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARgamma) belongs to the NHR family and is a major regulator of glucose and lipid metabolism by modulating energy homeostasis in adipose tissue, skeletal muscle and liver [15]-[17]. Glitazones or thiazolidinediones (TZDs) are high-affinity PPARgamma agonists, and act as insulin sensitizers. TZDs induce adipogenesis and adipose tissue remodeling followed by an improvement of glucose tolerance [18]. The role of PPARgamma in the control of glucose homeostasis expands beyond its primary action in adipose tissue, and involves the regulation of adipocytokine production such as adiponectin, leptin, and resistin [19]-[21]. Consistently, reduced PPARgamma activity has important metabolic and cardiovascular pathophysiological consequences leading to insulin resistance, diabetes and end organ damage [15].

The molecular mechanisms underlying PPARgamma function are similar to those of ER-signaling. In a basal state, PPARgamma, similar to ERs, is bound to corepressor proteins such as nuclear receptor corepressor (NCoR) or silencing mediator of retinoic acid and thyroid hormone receptor (SMRT) [22]. After binding within the ligand binding domain (LBD), PPARgamma ligands induce its heterodimerization with retinoid x receptor alpha (RXRalpha), and its subsequent interaction with co-activators like steroid receptor coactivators (SRCs) followed by binding to PPARgamma response elements (PPREs) within target gene promoters [23]. Importantly, PPARgamma is sharing a similar pool of cofactors with ERbeta which provides a platform for mutual interactions between these two NHRs [23],[24].

To study the crosstalk between ERbeta and PPARgamma, we investigated the regulation of PPARgamma-mediated transcriptional activity by ERbeta. Our in-vitro experiments in 3T3-L1 preadipocytes showed that ERbeta inhibits ligand-mediated PPARgamma-transcriptional activity. That resulted in the blockade of PPARgamma-induced adipocytic gene expression and in decreased adipogenesis. Overexpression of nuclear coactivators such as steroid receptor coactivator 1 (SRC1) and transcriptional intermediary factor 2 (TIF2) prevented the ERbeta-mediated inhibition of PPARgamma activity, whereas the presence of vitamin D receptor (VDR)-interacting protein 205 (DRIP205) or PPARgamma coactivator-1alpha (PGC1alpha) had no effect indicating a role for distinct nuclear coactivators for ERbeta-PPARgamma interaction in-vitro. High fat diet (HFD)-fed betaERKO mice showed increased body weight and fat mass. In contrast, triglyceride content in liver and muscle was decreased in betaERKO mice, which was associated with a marked improvement of hepatic and muscular insulin signaling. Compared to wt, betaERKO mice demonstrated improved systemic insulin sensitivity and glucose tolerance. In consonance with the metabolic phenotype and with the in-vitro data, betaERKO mice exhibited augmented PPARgamma signaling in adipose tissue corresponding to increased food efficiency and significantly elevated RQ (respiratory quotient). Blockade of adipose PPARgamma signaling in betaERKO mice by PPARgamma antisense oligonucleotide injection resulted in a reversal of the betaERKO phenotype including body weight reduction and impairment of insulin sensitivity.

In order to demonstrate a molecular interaction between PPARgamma and ERbeta in a metabolically relevant cell system, we first investigated ligand-dependent PPARgamma activity in the presence of ERbeta in 3T3-L1 preadipocytes. Cells were treated with the PPARgamma-agonist pioglitazone (10 microM), with or without additional E2 stimulation, and PPARgamma activation was measured using pGal4-hPPARgammaDEF/pG5TkGL3 luciferase assay [25]. Upon pioglitazone stimulation, 3T3-L1 preadipocytes showed pronounced PPARgamma activation (bar 1+2, Figure 1A). This activation was not affected by co-treatment with ligands for ERbeta such as E2 (bar 2 vs. 3, Figure 1A) or DPN (data not shown). Overexpression of ERbeta led to a marked inhibition of ligand-dependent PPARgamma activity (bar 2 vs. 4+6+8, Figure 1A) which was also corroborated in a PPARgamma response element (PPRE) luciferase assay ( Figure S1). This inhibition was E2 (bar 4+6+8 vs. 5+7+9, Figure 1A) and DPN independent (data not shown). The inhibitory effect of ERbeta seemed to be isoform specific, since ERalpha overexpression resulted in no inhibition of PPARgamma activity (bar 11, Figure 1A and Figure S2). To further explore the regulation of PPARgamma by ERbeta, we performed additional experiments coexpressing an activation function 1 domain (AF-1) deleted-ERbeta construct in 3T3-L1 cells. Overexpression of this truncated form of ERbeta which still contains a functional ligand binding domain (LBD) did not reduce PPARgamma activity indicating that ERbeta AF-1 is necessary for regulation of PPARgamma by ERbeta (bar 10, Figure 1A). To assure adequate overexpression and function of ERbeta in our system, 3T3-L1 preadipocytes were transiently transfected with ERbeta followed by Western blot analysis and transactivation assays using ER response elements (ERE)-luciferase system (Figure 1B, C). Both assays confirmed adequate expression and function of ERbeta.

While our data implicated a negative regulation of ligand-mediated PPARgamma transcription by ERbeta, we next investigated the regulation of PPARgamma-dependent gene expression during 3T3-L1 preadipocyte differentiation. The preadipocytes were transfected with indicated plasmids and differentiated for 3 days using standard differentiation medium [25]. As the full differentiation procedure requires 7-10 days of treatment, the observed effect on fat droplet accumulation and expression pattern are typical for early phase of adipocyte differentiation. The 3T3-L1 cells transfected with ERbeta and differentiated for 3 days showed reduced adipogenesis visualized by fat droplet accumulation in comparison to control cells (Figure 2A). Low levels of ERbeta could also be detected in untransfected 3T3-L1 cells and its expression was slightly elevated during differentiation (data not shown) underlining the physiological importance of our findings. Overexpression of the ERalpha isoform in these cells did not show any inhibitory effect on preadipocyte differentiation (Figure 2A). The adipocyte protein 2 (aP2) gene belongs to the classical PPARgamma-regulated genes involved in the early phase of adipogenesis [26]. The expression level of aP2 measured by real-time PCR was significantly elevated in the differentiated control cells (bar 2 vs. 1, Figure 2B). Overexpression of ERbeta-but not ERalpha- in these cells led to a significant reduction of aP2 expression (bar 2 vs. 4 and 6, Figure 2B) indicating that endogenous PPARgamma activation in 3T3-L1 cells was inhibited by ERbeta.

Furthermore pioglitazone (10 microM) treatment of 3T3-L1 cells overexpressing PPARgamma/RXRalpha showed increased adipogenesis, an effect that was markedly inhibited by coexpression of ERbeta (Figure 2C). aP2 expression level was also significantly reduced in cells co-expressing ERbeta together with PPARgamma/RXRalpha (bar 2 vs. 3, Figure 2D). These data indicate that ERbeta inhibits PPARgamma-transcriptional activity resulting in the blockade of PPARgamma-induced adipocytic target gene expression and amelioration of adipogenesis.

To investigate ERbeta's action on PPARgamma in vivo, we studied PPARgamma activity and PPARgamma target genes in HFD-fed betaERKO and wt mice. betaERKO mice and their wt littermates were fed HFD containing 60% calories from fat for 12 weeks followed by the analysis of PPARgamma-dependent gene expression in gonadal fat tissue. Adipose mRNA expression of PPARgamma target genes involved in triglycerides (TG) synthesis such as lipoprotein lipase (Lpl), phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK) and CD36 was significantly upregulated in betaERKO mice (Figure 3 A-C). Key mediators of insulin and glucose metabolism such as the retinol-binding protein 4 (RBP4) were also regulated in betaERKO mice (Figure 3D). Consistently with these findings, adiponectin mRNA expression and adiponectin serum levels were elevated in betaERKO mice (Figure 3E, F). No difference of PPARgamma target gene regulation between betaERKO and wt mice was observed in liver (data not shown).

Positive regulation of a series of adipose PPARgamma target genes in betaERKO mice suggested a general induction of PPARgamma transcription in betaERKO mice. To prove this, we performed EMSA assays in gonadal fat from betaERKO and wt mice after 12 weeks on HFD. Nuclear fractions isolated from adipose tissues from betaERKO mice showed an increased binding/activation of endogenous PPARgamma in comparison to wt mice (line 4-7 vs. 1-3, Figure 3G) in the presence of similar PPARgamma expression levels, as shown by real-time RT-PCR analysis and Western Blot (Figure 3G). Increased adipose PPARgamma target gene expression and PPARgamma-DNA binding confirmed an augmented PPARgamma signaling in adipose tissue from betaERKO mice.

To exclude the possibility that the augmented expression of PPARgamma target genes measured in HFD-fed betaERKO is the result of increased adipose tissue mass, we performed experiments using ex-vivo fat pads isolated from wt and betaERKO mice, treated for 24h with 10 microM pioglitazone or vehicle-control, followed by analysis of PPARgamma target gene expression using real-time RT-PCR. In this system augmented ligand-induced PPARgamma target gene expression mainly results from enhanced PPARgamma transcriptional activity and not from increased fat mass. The expression level of PEPCK and Lpl was significantly increased in both wt and betaERKO fat pads under pioglitazone treatment (bar 1 vs. 2 and bar 3 vs. 4 Figure 4 A and B). However, pioglitazone-induced PPARgamma target gene expression was markedly elevated in betaERKO mice compared to wt mice, indicating an augmented PPARgamma signaling in the absence of ERbeta (bar 2 vs. 4, Figure 4 A and B).

To further characterize ERbeta ligand dependency for its interaction with PPARgamma in the mouse model, additional in-vivo studies were performed in estrogen-depleted, ovariectomized wt mice treated with the ERbeta-ligand DPN. Analysis of PPARgamma target genes (Lpl, PEPCK, CD36 and adiponectin) in gonadal fat isolated from these mice revealed no significant differences in the expression level between vehicle and DPN-treated rodents indicating ligand independency (Figure 4C). These data are consistent with the in-vitro study in 3T3-L1 preadipocytes, where PPARgamma activation was not affected by co-treatment with ligands for ERbeta such as E2 (bar 2 vs. 3, Figure 1A) or DPN (data not shown).

Given the central role of PPARgamma in insulin and glucose metabolism, the metabolic phenotype of betaERKO mice was assessed. No difference in fasting/fed blood glucose food intake, and mean arterial blood pressure was observed between betaERKO and wt mice under HFD (Table 2). Body weight gain was significantly enhanced in betaERKO mice, compared to wt mice (mean BW difference betaERKO vs. wt mice after 12 week HFD: 3+/-0.4 g, p<0.05, Figure 5A). Increased body weight in betaERKO mice resulted from increased adipose tissue mass. MRI-analysis of body composition demonstrated significantly higher fat mass in betaERKO mice compared to wt littermates (Figure 5B), and fat pad weight from gonadal and perirenal depots was increased (Table 1). In contrast, liver weight was significantly reduced in betaERKO mice in comparison to wt control littermates (Table 1). Reduced hepatic weight likely resulted from decreased TG-accumulation assessed by H/E-staining of liver tissue sections (Figure 5C), and by TG quantification in dried liver tissue (Figure 5D). In accordance with reduced hepatic TG-content, hepatic insulin signaling was improved. After injection of insulin in the portal vein, liver tissue was dissected and proteins were isolated for Western blot analysis. Insulin-stimulated Akt phosphorylation was enhanced in betaERKO mice (Figure 5E and Figure S3). In parallel to decreased TG levels in liver, betaERKO mice had decreased muscular TG-accumulation under HFD and improved insulin signaling (Figure 5F, G, and Figure S3). Skeletal muscle and liver are the major insulin responsive tissues, and important sites of glucose metabolism in-vivo. An important mechanism of PPARgamma-mediated insulin sensitization involves adipose tissue remodeling and trapping of circulating triglycerides (TG) which protects the liver and skeletal muscle against TG overload. Increased adipose tissue mass in betaERKO mice may protect these animals against TG-overload in liver and skeletal muscle resulting in an improvement of hepatic and muscular insulin sensitivity.

Next we investigated insulin and glucose metabolism in betaERKO and wt mice. Whole body glucose disposal was assessed using an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) (Figure 6A). Following an oral glucose challenge betaERKO mice on HFD had moderately but significantly improved glucose tolerance compared to HFD-fed wt mice (Figure 6A, B). In addition insulin sensitivity measured by an insulin tolerance test (ITT) was improved in comparison to wt mice (Figure 6C, D). No difference in fasting and fed blood glucose was observed between betaERKO and wt mice under HFD (Table 2). Despite an increased fat mass in betaERKO mice, systemic insulin sensitivity and glucose tolerance were significantly improved under HFD when compared to wt-control. To further examine the enhanced weight gain and fat deposition in betaERKO mice, we performed indirect calorimetry and monitored food consumption. Food intake did not differ between wt-control and betaERKO mice (Table 2). However, deletion of ERbeta resulted in a marked increase of food efficiency (ratio of weight gain and food intake, Figure 6E). No significant difference in O2 consumption (Figure 6F), energy expenditure (Table 2), or locomotor activity (Table 2) was detected between betaERKO and wt mice. Low RQ values have previously been described for rodents under HFD and in diabetes [27]. Both wt and betaERKO mice exhibited low RQ values. betaERKO mice had a significantly higher RQ when compared to wt-controls which may be indicative for attenuated fatty acid (FA) oxidation promoting fat accumulation (Figure 6G). These data show that betaERKO mice are partially protected against HFD induced insulin resistance. Increased fat mass may likely result from increased food efficiency based on reduced oxidative utilization of fat and increased fat storage. The metabolic phenotype of betaERKO mice including increased fat mass, reduced hepatic/muscular TG and improved systemic insulin sensitivity exhibits high similarity to augmented PPARgamma activation e.g. under thiazolidinedione (TZD) treatment [28],[29].

To directly demonstrate the role of PPARgamma in HFD-fed betaERKO mice, PPARgamma signaling was disrupted by intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection of PPARgamma antisense oligonucleotide (ASO). HFD-fed betaERKO mice were injected twice a week for 6 weeks with either PPARgamma ASO or control oligonucleotides. PPARgamma expression was significantly reduced in liver of ASO-treated betaERKO mice, similar to previously reported results in apoB/BATless mice (data not shown) [30]. However, suppression of hepatic PPARgamma by ASO injection is unlikely to play an important role in our model, since hepatic PPARgamma signaling did not differ between wt and betaERKO mice, respectively. More importantly, i.p. application of PPARgamma ASO in betaERKO mice resulted in 63+/-4.8% (p<0.05) reduction of PPARgamma expression in gonadal adipose tissue compared to betaERKO mice injected with control oligonucleotides (Figure 7A). Accordingly, expression of the PPARgamma target genes Lpl, PEPCK, CD36, and adiponectin was markedly decreased in adipose tissue from PPARgamma ASO-injected betaERKO mice, and adipocyte diameters were increased (Figure 7A, G). These data corroborate a relevant reduction of adipose PPARgamma signaling by ASO intervention. Body weight gain and gonadal fat accumulation in HFD-fed-betaERKO mice were significantly attenuated by PPARgamma-ASO injection (Figure 7B, C). Finally, blockade of adipose PPARgamma by ASO led to reversal of the improved insulin response observed in betaERKO mice, and to an impairment of insulin sensitivity and glucose tolerance (Figure 7D-F). Together these data underline the importance of adipose PPARgamma signaling for the metabolic phenotype observed in betaERKO mice.

Nuclear coactivators such as SRC1 and TIF2 are important mediators of ERbeta and PPARgamma-induced transcriptional activation. It has previously been shown that competition of distinct nuclear receptor (NR) for coactivator binding results in a negative cross-talk between NRs [31]. To prove whether common coactivators are involved in ERbeta-PPARgamma interactions, SRC1, TIF2, DRIP205 or PGC1alpha were co-expressed together with ERbeta and ligand induced PPARgamma activation was measured.

Overexpression of SRC1 and TIF2 prevented the ERbeta-mediated inhibition of PPARgamma activity (Figure 8A, B) whereas the presence of DRIP205 (Figure 8C) and PGC1alpha (Figure S4) had no effect. To demonstrate that SRC1 and TIF2 are also involved in ERbeta-PPARgamma interaction in-vivo, we performed ChIP experiments with gonadal fat from HFD-fed betaERKO and wt mice. The adiponectin promoter was selected as a PPARgamma-target promoter. Binding of SRC1 and TIF2 to the adiponectin promoter was enhanced in gonadal fat from betaERKO mice (Figure 8D), indicating that the absence of ERbeta in adipose tissue results in exaggerated coactivator binding to a PPARgamma target promoter. Together these data suggest that the coactivators SRC1 and TIF2 are involved in the negative regulation of PPARgamma by ERbeta in vitro and in vivo.

The present study demonstrates that ERbeta is a negative regulator of ligand-induced PPARgamma activity in-vitro. Consequently, data from betaERKO mice suggest that ERbeta negatively regulates insulin and glucose metabolism which may, at least in part, result from an impairment of regular adipose tissue function based on a negative cross-talk between ERbeta and PPARgamma. Loss of ERbeta resulted in enhanced body weight gain and fat accumulation in HFD-fed mice. However, absence of ERbeta prevented hepatic/ muscular triglyceride overload, preserved regular insulin signaling in liver/ skeletal muscle, and improved whole-body insulin sensitivity and glucose tolerance under HFD. This metabolic phenotype strongly suggested augmented PPARgamma signaling in mice lacking ERbeta. And indeed, PPARgamma target genes and PPARgamma-DNA binding were markedly induced in gonadal fat from betaERKO mice. Along this line, blockade of adipose PPARgamma signaling by PPARgamma ASO injection reversed the metabolic changes in betaERKO mice.

A mutual signaling cross-talk between ERs and PPARgamma has been described previously. PPARgamma together with its heterodimeric partner RXRalpha has been shown to suppress ER-induced target gene expression through competitive binding to an ERE site in the vitellogenin A2 promoter [32]. In accordance with a bidirectional interaction, Wang and colleagues demonstrated that ERs are capable of inhibiting ligand-induced PPARgamma activation in two different breast cancer cell lines [33]. In contrast to our results, these authors show that basal and agonist-stimulated PPRE-activity is also blocked by ERalpha. Transcriptional activity of PPARgamma differs markedly depending on the cell system and tissues. The highest level of PPARgamma-mediated transcription has been described in adipocytes and adipocytic cell lines, where molecular conditions such as cofactor availability seemed to be optimized [34]. Compared to adipocytes, breast cancer cells exhibit low PPARgamma expression and activity reflected by a less than 2-fold induction of PPRE-activity after ligand stimulation [33]. The presence of PPARgamma suppression by ERalpha in breast cancer cells might be a result of weak basal PPARgamma transcriptional activity in these cells. In contrast, the pronounced activation of the exogenous PPARgamma LBD in 3T3-L1 preadipocytes may require more potent inhibitory stimuli which could not be achieved by ERalpha overexpression in our system.

Suppression of PPARgamma-LBD activation by ERbeta did not depend on ERbeta ligands which is consistent with previous reports [33]. Also our in vivo studies in estrogen-depleted, ovariectomized wt mice treated with the ERbeta-ligand DPN indicate that PPARgamma-ERbeta interaction is ligand independent. More importantly, overexpression of a truncated form of ERbeta containing solely the ERbeta-LBD/ AF2 domain did not induce any inhibitory effect on PPARgamma suggesting an important role of ERbeta's NH2-terminal AF1 domain for ERbeta-PPARgamma interactions. Consistently, activity of the ER-AF1 domain is usually not dependent on ligand activation [35]. Furthermore, Tremblay and coworkers demonstrated that ERbeta-AF1 activation involves ligand-independent recruitment of SRC-1, a cofactor involved in ERbeta-PPARgamma interactions in our study [36]. These data corroborate our observation that PPARgamma suppression by ERbeta involves the AF1 domain and ligand-independent interactions with the coactivators SRC1 and TIF2. Repression of PPARgamma activity through ERbeta was reversed by titration of the p160 coactivators, SRC1 and TIF2, suggesting that the suppressive action of ERbeta is a result of p160 coactivator interaction with ERbeta thereby preventing the binding of PPARgamma to the same coactivators. Similar interactions have been described previously for ER interaction with the thyroid receptor [31].

The present study demonstrates for the first time that ERbeta impairs insulin sensitivity and glucose tolerance under HFD implicating pro-diabetogenic actions of this receptor. In consonance, we could recently demonstrate that ERbeta has a suppressive role on glucose transporter 4 (GLUT4) expression in skeletal muscle [8],[37]. GLUT4 has been identified as the major mediator of insulin-induced glucose uptake in fat and skeletal muscle. In addition, removal of the E2-ERbeta signaling by ovariectomy in ERalpha-deficient mice improved glucose and insulin metabolism supporting the diabetogenic effect of ERbeta [12]. Loss of ERbeta resulted in a marked augmentation of adipose PPARgamma activity in our model indicating that ERbeta mediates its metabolic actions by a negative interaction with PPARgamma in adipose tissue. This concept is corroborated by a number of observations. HFD-fed betaERKO mice exhibited increased adipose tissue mass in the presence of improved insulin sensitivity and glucose tolerance. These metabolic changes are usually observed under chronic PPARgamma stimulation [17]. PPARgamma has been identified as an essential regulator of whole-body insulin sensitivity. Two major mechanisms have been described: (1) Adipose PPARgamma protects non-adipose tissue against excessive lipid overload and maintains normal organ function and insulin responses (liver, skeletal muscle) by preserving regular adipose tissue function, and (2) Adipose PPARgamma guarantees a balanced and adequate production of adipocytokine secretion such as adiponectin from adipose tissue, factors which are important mediators of insulin action in peripheral tissues [38]-[40]. Both processes could be observed in betaERKO mice. Further support of this notion comes from clinical actions of anti-diabetic PPARgamma agonists (TZD) [28],[29]. Activation of PPARgamma by TZDs in diabetic patients resembles the phenotype of betaERKO mice including improved insulin sensitization and glucose tolerance in the presence of weight gain. We also observed increased food efficiency and changes in nutrient partitioning reflected by an increased RQ in betaERKO mice. Loss of ERbeta appears to result in attenuated fatty acid (FA) oxidation which may favor the storage of TGs in adipose tissue and increased fat accumulation, and may provide a possible explanation for the enhanced weight gain. Interestingly, treatment of obese mice with a synthetic PPARgamma agonist has been shown to mediate similar changes including an increase in food efficiency and higher RQ values [41]. Finally, blockade of PPARgamma signaling in adipose tissue of betaERKO mice resulted in a reversal of the metabolic phenotype corroborating the importance of adipose PPARgamma in the present model. The observed suppression of hepatic PPARgamma activity by ASO injection is unlikely to play a major role since the initial metabolic characterization of untreated betaERKO mice under HFD did not reveal any dysregulation of hepatic PPARgamma signaling. In summary, the metabolic phenotype of betaERKO mice is mediated by an augmented adipose PPARgamma action, which implies that in the presence of ERbeta, PPARgamma activity might be partially suppressed.

The notion, that ERbeta-PPARgamma crosstalk requires receptor-p160 interaction, was underlined by our observations in WAT from betaERKO mice. Binding of SRC1 and TIF2 to the PPARgamma-regulated adiponectin promoter in WAT was enhanced in the absence of ERbeta. It has recently been demonstrated that p160 coactivators are important regulators of PPARgamma transcriptional activity in WAT [42]. In particular, TIF2 has been identified as a nuclear coactivator involved in the adipogenic actions of PPARgamma. Future experiments are required to define the functional relevance of TIF2 and SRC1 in our model. So far one may conclude that the metabolic phenotype of HFD-fed betaERKO mice is, at least in part, explained by increased adipose PPARgamma activity as a result of exaggerated binding of p160 coactivators to PPARgamma-regulated target gene promoters. Diabetogenic actions of ERbeta are of major significance for the pharmaceutical development of new ERbeta-selective agonists intended for use against a multitude of diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis or postmenopausal osteoporosis [43],[44]. Despite the high tissue selectivity of such compounds, and despite the fact that the actions observed in our study were ligand-independent, one has to be aware of the potentially deleterious actions of ERbeta on insulin- and glucose metabolism. As a precautionary measure metabolic profiling of new ERbeta agonist should be performed.

Collectively, our data provide first evidence that ERbeta negatively regulates insulin signaling and glucose metabolism that involves an impairment of regular adipose PPARgamma function. Moreover our data suggest that the coactivators SRC1 and TIF2 are involved in this inhibition. In consonance, impairment of insulin and glucose metabolism by ERbeta has significant implications for our understanding of hormone receptor-dependent pathophysiology of metabolic diseases, and is essential for the development of new ERbeta-selective agonists.

Female estrogen receptor beta -/- mice (betaERKO) received from J.-A. Gustafsson (Karolinska Institutet, Huddinge, Sweden) and their wt littermates were housed in a temperature controlled (25degreesC) facility with a 12-h light/dark cycle and genotyped using genomic DNA isolation kit (Invitek) and PCR primers described elsewhere [45]. 4-5 week old mice were fed ad libitum with a high-fat diet (60% kcal from fat, [25]) for 12 weeks. Body weight and food intake were determined throughout the experiment. At start and end of treatment, body composition was determined by nuclear magnetic resonance imaging (Bruker's Minispec MQ10). After 12 weeks' treatment, blood samples were collected from overnight-fasted animals by retroorbital venous puncture under isoflurane anesthesia for analysis of serum adiponectin (mouse-adiponectin ELISA; Linco Research) and glucose (colorimetric glucose test; Cypress Diagnostics). An OGTT using a dose of 2 g/kg body weight (BW) glucose and ITT with intraperitoneally injected 0.5 units/kg BW insulin (Actrapid; Novo Nordisk) were performed. Tail vein blood was used for glucose quantification with a glucometer (Precision Xtra; Abbott). Blood pressure was measured invasively in the abdominal aorta using a solid-state pressure transducer catheter (Micro-Tip 3F; Millar Instruments) under isoflurane anesthesia. Afterwards animals were killed and organs were dissected. For immunohistochemical studies organs were fixed in 4% formalin, embedded in paraffin and stained with Haematoxylin/Eosin (H&E); for RNA, Western blot analysis and measurement of TG content isolated organs were frozen in liquid nitrogen; for EMSA and Chromatin IP assays abdominal fat was stored in ice-cold PBS with proteinase inhibitors (Complete Mini, Roche), and immediately proceeded as described below.

The antibody-bound proteins were then precipitated using 300 microl Protein A Sepharose slurry (Amersham), washed and further processed according to the Upstate protocol.

Triglyceride-content in skeletal muscle and liver was measured as described previously [47]. Briefly, tissues were homogenized in liquid nitrogen and treated with ice-cold chloroform/methanol/water mixture (2:1:0.8) for 2 min. After centrifugation the aqueous layer was removed and the chloroform layer was decanted. The mixture was incubated at 70degreesC for chloroform clearance, and the residues were dissolved in isopropanol, and assessed for the triglyceride content using an enzymatic-calorimetric test (Cypress diagnostics) according to the manufacturer's instructions.

ERbeta inhibits PPARgamma activity in vitro. In order to demonstrate a molecular interaction between PPARgamma and ERbeta in a metabolically relevant cell system, we first investigated ligand-dependent PPARgamma activity in the presence of beta in 3T3-L1 preadipocytes. Cells were transfected with 100 ng of PPARgamma, 50 ng of RXRalpha, 700 ng of PPRE-luc, 5 ng of renilla, and increasing amount of ERbeta, as indicated. Afterwards cells were treated with the PPARgamma-agonist pioglitazone (10 microM), and PPARgamma activation was measured using PPRE-luc luciferase assay. Upon pioglitazone stimulation, 3T3-L1 preadipocytes showed increased PPARgamma activation. Overexpression of ERbeta led to a marked inhibition of ligand-dependent PPARgamma activity (bar 1 vs. 2 and 3). # p<0.05 vs. control.
