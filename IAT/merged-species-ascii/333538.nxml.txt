During mammalian spermatogenesis, somatic histones are replaced by testis-specific variants. The synthesis of the variants occurs primarily in the germ cells undergoing meiosis in the absence of DNA replication. We have cloned the genes encoding rat somatic and testis-specific H2A (TH2A) histones. The two genes share 300 bp of 5' upstream region with respective H2B genes: somatic H2A with somatic H2B and testis-specific TH2A with testis-specific TH2B gene. The deduced amino acid sequences show that H2A and TH2A histones have eight amino acid differences in the first half of the molecules and three consecutive changes in the C-terminal region. TH2A gene is expressed only in testis. Although synthesis of TH2A and TH2B histones is independent of DNA replication and insensitive to inhibitors of DNA synthesis in testis, the regulatory region shared by the two genes contain a bi-directional S phase-specific transcription regulatory element. In addition, TH2A gene, like TH2B gene, contains the consensus sequence element in the 3' non-coding region which is involved in the S phase-specific stabilization of histone mRNA.
