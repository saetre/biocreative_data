We have used cloned mouse and human DNA probes to identify regions of conserved homology between the human and murine DNA segments, (termed kappa deleting element (kde) and recombining segment (RS) respectively) which are frequently recombined in lambda-producing B cells. Heteroduplex analysis indicated extensive homology in the region immediately downstream of the recombination site of both segments. This was confirmed by Southern and direct nucleotide sequence analyses. Fifty percent homology was detected within the 500 nucleotides that neighbour the recombination points in the kde and RS segments. These results indicate that the kde and RS sequences are evolutionarily conserved and may be functionally relevant to normal B cell development.
