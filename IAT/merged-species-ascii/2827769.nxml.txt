Elevated circulating levels of acute phase proteins (APP) are associated with inflammation and inflammatory disorders such as cardiovascular disease. APP are mainly synthesised by hepatocytes and their transcription is induced by pro-inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin-1 (IL-1). The molecular mechanisms underlying the IL-1-induced expression of key transcription factors implicated in the regulation of APP are poorly understood. We have investigated this aspect using the CCAAT/enhancer binding protein-delta (C/EBPdelta) as a model gene. IL-1 induced the expression of C/EBPdelta mRNA and protein in the human hepatoma Hep3B cell line, a widely employed model system for studies on cytokine signalling in relation to the expression of APP. The IL-1-mediated induction of C/EBPdelta expression was attenuated in the presence of pharmacological inhibitors against c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) (curcumin and SP600125), casein kinase 2 (CK2) (apigenin) and nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) (NF-kappaB activation inhibitor). RNA interference assays showed significant attenuation of the IL-1-induced expression of C/EBPdelta following knockdown of the p50 and p65 subunits of NF-kappaB. IL-1 induced NF-kappaB DNA binding and activation by this transcription factor and this was attenuated by curcumin and apigenin. Taken together, these results suggest a potentially crucial role for NF-kappaB in the IL-1-induced expression of C/EBPdelta, and thereby downstream APP genes regulated by this transcription factor.

The acute phase response (APR) is the body's innate immune defence against infection, inflammation, stress, physical trauma and pathological conditions such as cardiovascular disease (Ramji et al., 1993a; Baumann and Gauldie, 1994). The APR is characterized by fever, leukocytosis, altered metabolism in many organs, and dramatic changes in the plasma concentrations of various acute phase proteins (APP) (Ramji et al., 1993a; Baumann and Gauldie, 1994). Numerous studies have suggested that such APP may act as biomarkers and possibly causal agents in the development of cardiovascular disease (Packard and Libby, 2008).

The APP can be distinguished into two major groups; the positive APP (e.g. hemopexin, C-reactive protein (CRP), fibrinogen, serum amyloid A (SAA)) whose plasma concentrations increase during the APR, and the negative APP (e.g. albumin, transferrin) whose levels decrease (Ramji et al., 1993a; Baumann and Gauldie, 1994). The main stimulators of APP production are inflammation-associated cytokines such as interleukin-6 (IL-6), interleukin-1 (IL-1), tumour necrosis factor-alpha and interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) (Ramji et al., 1993a,b; Baumann and Gauldie, 1994; Moshage, 1997). The liver is the major site for APP production and cytokines regulate their expression mainly at the transcriptional level (Ramji et al., 1993a,b; Baumann and Gauldie, 1994; Moshage, 1997). It is essential that the molecular mechanisms underlying such regulation are fully understood, particularly how cytokines modulate the action of key transcription factors involved in this response. CCAAT/enhancer binding proteins (C/EBP) fall in this category (Ramji and Foka, 2002).

Transcription factors belonging to the C/EBP family contain a conserved basic-leucine zipper motif at the carboxyl terminus that is involved in dimerization and DNA binding (Ramji and Foka, 2002). There are six C/EBP family members (C/EBPalpha to zeta), most of which recognize similar DNA sequences, at least in vitro, and form heterodimers in intrafamilial combinations (Ramji and Foka, 2002). Binding sites for the C/EBPs have been identified in the regulatory regions of a large number of APP genes, including hemopexin, haptoglobin, CRP, alpha1-acid glycoprotein, alpha2-macroglobulin, SAA-1, -2 and -3, complement C3, plasminogen and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (Poli, 1998; Ramji and Foka, 2002; Bannach et al., 2004; Dong et al., 2005, 2007). The general trend that has emerged from these studies is that C/EBPalpha homodimers or C/EBPalpha:C/EBPbeta heterodimers are mainly responsible for the constitutive transcription (Chen and Liao, 1993; Ray and Ray, 1994; Poli, 1998; Ramji and Foka, 2002). However, upon induction of the APR, C/EBPalpha dimers are rapidly replaced by C/EBP-beta and -delta homo-/heterodimers, although the exact composition of these complexes varies with different gene promoters and depends on the experimental models used (Ramji et al., 1993b; Chen and Liao, 1993; Ray and Ray, 1994; Poli, 1998; Ramji and Foka, 2002).

The expression and the activity of C/EBP-beta and -delta are also stimulated by IL-1 and IL-6 (Ramji et al., 1993b; Poli, 1998; Ramji and Foka, 2002). Unfortunately, the molecular mechanisms underlying such regulation are relatively poorly understood, particularly those relating to cytokine-induced expression, which are further restricted to the action of IL-6 (Ramji and Foka, 2002). The purpose of this study was therefore to investigate the mechanisms underlying the actions of IL-1 using C/EBPdelta as a model gene.

The human hepatoma Hep3B cell line is used widely as a model for liver-specific gene expression and cytokine-mediated regulation of APP with demonstrated conservation to in vivo responses (Hiron et al., 1992; Ramji et al., 1993a; Foka et al., 2009; Coulouarn et al., 2004, 2005 and references therein). For example, the hepatocyte origin and pro-inflammatory cytokine responsiveness of mRNAs that were found to be upregulated in acute systemic inflammation, as judged by complete coverage of the human liver transcriptome, has been confirmed in these cells (Coulouarn et al., 2004). In addition, genome-wide studies in these cells in relation to the actions of pro-inflammatory cytokines have shown proper kinetics of changes in mRNA abundances for cytokines and their receptors, transcription factors and APPs, with the overall percentage of regulated mRNAs (approximately7%) being similar to the number of liver mRNAs regulated during the APR in mouse or humans in vivo (Coulouarn et al., 2005).

This was therefore investigated by time course RT-PCR and western blot analysis. For RT-PCR, sequence analysis confirmed the specific amplification of C/EBPdelta. Fig. 1A shows that IL-1 induces C/EBPdelta mRNA expression that peaks at 3 h and remains at similar or slightly reduced levels throughout the 24 h incubation period. Such an induction was due to IL-1 and not because of a non-specific effect of harvesting the cells at the various time-points. The expression of the C/EBPdelta protein was also induced by IL-1 at 3 h post-treatment and was then expressed at reduced levels over the rest of the 24 h period (Fig. 1B). Statistical analysis of the data from three independent experiments showed that the IL-1-induced expression of the C/EBPdelta protein (normalized to beta-actin) was significant (P < 0.01 at 3 h, 6 h and 12 h and <0.05 at 24 h). Overall, these data show that IL-1 induces C/EBPdelta mRNA and protein expression in Hep3B cells, which is consistent with the previously noted activation of C/EBPdelta expression in the liver during experimentally induced inflammation in rodents (Alam et al., 1992; Magalini et al., 1995). However, the induced levels of C/EBPdelta mRNA were maintained for a more prolonged period than the corresponding protein. This suggests that, similar to the actions of several extracellular mediators on the C/EBPs (Ramji and Foka, 2002; Magalini et al., 1995), multiple mechanisms are involved in the IL-1-mediated induction of C/EBPdelta expression.

An IL-1-mediated induction of C/EBPdelta promoter activity was not observed when transient transfection assays were carried out using luciferase-based plasmids containing 1.6 kB of human C/EBPdelta promoter (Sanford and DeWille, 2005) or 2.2 kB of mouse C/EBPdelta promoter (Hutt et al., 2000) (data not shown). As expected from previous studies (Yamada et al., 1997; Cantwell et al., 1998; Sanford and DeWille, 2005), both promoters were activated by IL-6 (data not shown). IL-1 was functional in this system as it could activate the pNF-kappaB-Luc plasmid (Clontech) which contains multiple binding site of this transcription factor linked to a minimal promoter upstream of the luciferase reporter gene (data not shown). Although the precise reason(s) for the non-responsiveness of the C/EBPdelta promoter to IL-1 is currently unclear, it is possible that either the regulatory sequences for IL-1 actions reside outside those present in the DNA constructs used or a specific chromatin context is required for the response that is not present in the transfected plasmids. Our further studies therefore focused on the signalling pathways underlying IL-1 actions.

An initial screen analysing the effects of a single concentration of pharmacological inhibitors against different signal transduction pathways showed that the IL-1-induced expression of C/EBPdelta mRNA was significantly attenuated by 30 muM curcumin and 20 muM apigenin, inhibitors of JNK and CK2, respectively (Mead et al., 2003; Li et al., 2005; Yamada et al., 2005; Singh and Ramji, 2006, 2008; Parhar et al., 2007; Harris et al., 2008) (Fig. 2A). The action of these two inhibitors was therefore investigated in more detail along with SP600125, another JNK inhibitor (Han et al., 2001), and the NF-kappaB activation inhibitor (NAI) (Tobe et al., 2003) because of the important role of this transcription factor in IL-1 signalling (Dunne and O'Neill, 2003). All four inhibitors attenuated the IL-1-induced expression of the C/EBPdelta protein (Fig. 2B-E) (P < 0.001 for curcumin, 40 muM apigenin and 50 muM SP600125; <0.05 for 5 muM and 10 muM NAI; and <0.01 for 20 muM apigenin and 100 muM SP600125). A similar attenuation by the inhibitors was observed at the level of IL-1-induced C/EBPdelta mRNA expression (data not shown). The marked inhibition of the IL-1-mediated induction of C/EBPdelta expression by these pharmacological agents was not due to cellular toxicity as judged by the specific inhibition of expression of C/EBPdelta but not 28SrRNA or beta-actin (Fig. 2) and trypan blue exclusion assays using different concentrations of all four inhibitors (data not shown).

Differential splicing of the JNK genes leads to the generation of two predominant forms of this enzyme, p54 and p46, and these can be activated by phosphorylation at threonine 183 and tyrosine 185. The action of IL-1 on the phosphorylation of JNKs at these two sites was therefore investigated by western blot analysis. IL-1 increased the levels of phosphorylated p54 without affecting the total levels of the protein (Fig. 3A). Further experiments showed that such an increase in JNK phosphorylation was due to IL-1 and not because of incubation of the cells for the time period (Fig. I in supplementary data).

The activity of JNK can be monitored using an in vitro kinase assay kit in which the ability of immunoprecipitated JNKs to phosphorylate c-Jun, its key downstream target, is determined. This assay was therefore employed to determine the action of IL-1 on JNK activity in the absence or the presence of pharmacological inhibitors. Consistent with the pattern of phospho-JNK levels (Fig. 3A), IL-1 induced the activity of the enzyme (Fig. 3B) (P < 0.05 at 15 min and 30 min). In addition, curcumin and SP600125, but not apigenin, attenuated the IL-1-induced JNK activity (Fig. 3C) (P < 0.001 for both curcumin and SP600125).

siRNA-mediated knockdown of JNK-1 and -2, the two prominent isoforms expressed in hepatocytes, or its downstream target c-Jun did not attenuate the IL-1-induced expression of the C/EBPdelta protein (Figs. IIA-IIB in supplementary data). Similarly, siRNA-mediated knockdown of CK2-alpha and -alpha', two of the three catalytic subunits of this enzyme (Singh and Ramji, 2008) had no effect (Fig. IIC in supplementary data). For JNK and CK2, the findings were confirmed at the level of C/EBPdelta mRNA expression (data not shown). Although the precise reason(s) for these results are currently unclear, it is possible that this could be because of functional redundancy between the different pathways and/or sufficient amount of residual activity being present following siRNA-mediated knockdown. Because it was not possible to simultaneously knockdown all the JNK and CK2 isoforms due to potential toxicity effects from the use of large quantities of siRNA that would be required, the role of the downstream transcription factor NF-kappaB was investigated. The expression of both the p50 and p65 NF-kappaB subunits, the two most abundant isoforms that play a key role in IL-1 signalling (Pereira and Oakley, 2008), was knocked down by transfection of Hep3B cells with siRNA against these two subunits but not GAPDH (Fig. 4A and B). The IL-1-induced expression of the C/EBPdelta protein was attenuated by knockdown of p50 and p65 expression but not by GAPDH (Fig. 4A and C). Knockdown had no effect on the expression of the beta-actin protein (Fig. 4A). Similar results were obtained when the C/EBPdelta mRNA expression was monitored by RT-PCR (data not shown).

The IL-1-mediated activation of NF-kappaB is known to occur via a TAK-dependent or -independent manner (Yao et al., 2007). siRNA-mediated knockdown of TAK1, however, failed to attenuate the IL-1-induced expression of C/EBPdelta (Fig. III in supplementary data), thereby suggesting a potential TAK1-independent pathway.

Because the IL-1-induced expression of C/EBPdelta was attenuated by inhibitors of JNK and CK2 (Fig. 2), the action of these on NF-kappaB-mediated transcriptional activation along with its DNA binding activity was investigated. Transfection assays using the pNF-kappaB-Luc plasmid, which contains multiple NF-kappaB binding sites linked to a luciferase reporter gene, showed that IL-1 induced its activity and this was attenuated in a statistically significant manner by both apigenin and curcumin (Fig. 5). The IL-1-mediated activation of pNF-kappaB-Luc was specific to this transcription factor because it could be attenuated by expression of a superrepressor (IkappaBalphaDeltaN) that inhibits NF-kappaB action (Heissmeyer et al., 1999) (Fig. 5).

Time course EMSA using whole cell extracts and a radiolabelled consensus NF-kappaB binding site oligonucleotide as a probe (called kappaB oligonucleotide hereafter) showed the formation of at least five DNA-protein complexes (labelled a-e in Fig. 6). From these, four of the complexes (a, c, d and e) were present in untreated cells (although signals for c and d were generally faint) and induced to varying degrees by IL-1 treatment. On the other hand, complex b was entirely induced by IL-1 treatment. The induction of NF-kappaB was transient, being apparent 5 min post-IL-1 treatment and decreased at 180 min. Further experiments focused on the 15 min time point where a marked IL-1 induced NF-kappaB activity was observed.

A similar profile of DNA-protein interactions was observed with both nuclear and whole cell extracts, thereby ruling out the possibility that the previously noted induction of NF-kappaB activity was peculiar to the use of whole cell extracts for EMSA (Fig. 7A). The specificity of DNA-protein complexes was analysed by competition EMSA and showed attenuation by pre-incubation of the extracts with a 250-fold molar excess of the unlabelled kappaB oligonucleotide but not by that containing the unrelated AP-1 binding site (Fig. 7B). The potential involvement of p50 and the p65 subunits, the major components of NF-kappaB in several modes of regulation (Pereira and Oakley, 2008), was investigated using antibody supershift/interference EMSA with non-immune serum serving as a control. Pre-incubation with the anti-p50 NF-kappaB antibody resulted in the formation of a slower migrating antibody-DNA-protein supershift complex, complete inhibition of complex b, and partial inhibition of complex a (Fig. 7B). On the other hand, pre-incubation with the anti-p65 antibody interfered with the formation of complexes a and d (Fig. 7B). These results suggest that, consistent with the data for siRNA-mediated knockdown (Fig. 4), both p50 and p65 were involved in DNA-protein interactions. Finally, the IL-1-induced NF-kappaB binding was attenuated by pre-treatment of the cells with apigenin or curcumin. Densitometric analysis showed that the induction of NF-kappaB binding by IL-1 was significant (P < 0.05) along with the attenuation of this by curcumin and apigenin (P < 0.01 and 0.05, respectively). Thus, similar to the previously noted effect on trans-activation (Fig. 5), apigenin and curcumin also attenuate the IL-1-induced NF-kappaB DNA binding.

Circulating levels of several APP are elevated during inflammation and inflammatory disorders such as cardiovascular disease in response to increased transcription of these genes in hepatocytes by cytokines such as IL-1 (Ramji et al., 1993a,b; Baumann and Gauldie, 1994; Moshage, 1997; Ramji and Foka, 2002; Packard and Libby, 2008). Although the C/EBPs play crucial roles in such regulation, the mechanisms underlying the actions of cytokines on these transcription factors remain poorly understood (Ramji and Foka, 2002). We show here that IL-1 induces the expression of C/EBPdelta mRNA and protein in Hep3B cells (Fig. 1) and this was attenuated by inhibitors of JNK, CK2 and NF-kappaB (Fig. 2). siRNA-mediated knockdown of the p50 and p65 NF-kappaB subunits attenuated the IL-1 induced expression of C/EBPdelta (Fig. 4). IL-1 stimulated NF-kappaB DNA binding and trans-activation, which was attenuated by inhibitors of CK2 and JNK (Figs. 5-7). Although a role for JNK in IL-1-induced expression of C/EBPdelta expression in hepatocytes, as judged by inhibition of the response in HepG2 cells by SP600125, has been reported (Dong et al., 2007), our studies also show important and novel roles for CK2 and NF-kappaB.

The association of the JNK pathway in the control of inflammation is well established and recent studies have also suggested an important role for CK2 (Singh and Ramji, 2008). In addition, these two pathways have also been implicated in IL-1 signalling (O'Neill and Greene, 1998; Singh and Ramji, 2008). For example, IL-1 has been shown to activate CK2 in intestinal epithelial cells and inhibition of this enzyme attenuates the expression of several genes induced by this cytokine (Parhar et al., 2007). Although inhibitors of JNK and CK2 attenuated the IL-1-induced expression of C/EBPdelta (Fig. 2), no such effect was observed following siRNA-mediated knockdown of JNK-1/2 and CK2-alpha/alpha' (e.g. Fig. II in supplementary data). The precise reasons for these results are currently unclear but could be due to functional redundancy between the pathways. Indeed, such functional redundancy is relatively common in signalling cascades involved in the regulation of gene expression as multiple pathways often regulate key transcription factors such as NF-kappaB (Mestre et al., 2001; Lowell et al., 1994). In addition, as siRNA-mediated depletion of a target protein only leads to a knockdown of expression, any remaining protein could function to compensate for its reduced expression.

Five NF-kappaB members exist in mammalian cells [RelA (p65), RelB, c-Rel, p50/p105 (NF-kappaB1) and p52/p100 (NF-kappaB2) (May and Ghosh, 1997; Pereira and Oakley, 2008). The p50 and p52 subunits are produced by proteolytic processing of precursor proteins (p105 and p100, respectively) (May and Ghosh, 1997; Pereira and Oakley, 2008). Transcriptional regulation by this family is complex in part due to extensive dimerization between the different proteins (May and Ghosh, 1997; Pereira and Oakley, 2008). RelA (p65), RelB and c-Rel contain a potent transcriptional activation domain at the carboxyl terminus (May and Ghosh, 1997). Although p50 and p52 lack these domains, activation by p50 homodimers has been demonstrated (May and Ghosh, 1997). Our studies show a crucial role for p50 and p65 in the IL-1-induced C/EBPdelta expression. Both these subunits were involved in DNA-protein interactions, and IL-1 activated NF-kappaB DNA binding and trans-activation, which was attenuated by curcumin and apigenin (Figs. 5-7). Whether the action of these inhibitors on NF-kappaB is direct or a secondary response to inhibition of JNK and CK2 is currently unclear. However, cross-talk between JNK and NF-kappaB is relatively common (Wullaert et al., 2006). In addition, IL-1 has been found to increase the association of CK2 and NF-kappaB (Bird et al., 1997; Singh and Ramji, 2008). Furthermore, CK2 has been found to regulate the trans-activation potential of the p65 subunit along with other components of this pathway (Bird et al., 1997; Parhar et al., 2007; Singh and Ramji, 2008). For example, CK2-mediated phosphorylation of IkappaBalpha facilitates its degradation, thereby leading to stimulation of transcription of NF-kappaB gene targets (Singh and Ramji, 2008).
###end p 48
###begin p 49
In conclusion, we show here for the first time that NF-kappaB plays a crucial role in the IL-1 induced expression of C/EBPdelta, a key transcription factor in the activation of APP gene transcription. JNK and CK2 were also involved in the response and modulated the IL-1-induced trans-activation and DNA binding by NF-kappaB. The studies therefore provide novel insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying the IL-1-mediated induction of APP gene transcription in hepatocytes.
