Mutations in the Escherichia coli promoter PBAD have been constructed which alter the spacing of the adjacent RNA polymerase and araC inducer protein binding sites. While deletion of a single base-pair or small insertions do not detectably affect araC protein binding to DNA and they do not alter the conserved sequence of the RNA polymerase binding site, stimulation of PBAD in vivo is greatly reduced. The experiments suggest that the distance or angle between the two proteins on the DNA is critical for promoter function.
