We report the molecular cloning, sequencing and genetic characterization of the first gene encoding an organellar polypeptide chain release factor, the MRF1 gene of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The MRF1 gene was cloned by genetic complementation of a respiratory deficient mutant disturbed in the expression of the mitochondrial genes encoding cytochrome c oxidase subunit 1 and 2, COX1 and COX2. For COX1 this defect has been attributed to an impaired processing of several introns. Sequence analysis of the MRF1 gene revealed that it encodes a protein highly similar to prokaryotic peptide chain release factors, especially RF-1. Disruption of the gene results in a high instability of the mitochondrial genome, a hallmark for a strict lesion in mitochondrial protein synthesis. The respiratory negative phenotype of mrf1 mutants lacking all known mitochondrial introns and the reduced synthesis of mitochondrial translation products encoded by unsplit genes confirm a primary defect in mitochondrial protein synthesis. Over-expression of the MRF1 gene in a mitochondrial nonsense suppressor strain reduces suppression in a dosage-dependent manner, shedding new light on the role of the '530 region' of 16S-like ribosomal RNA in translational fidelity.
