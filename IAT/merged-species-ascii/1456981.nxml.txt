Glycogen Synthase Kinase-3 (GSK3) activity is repressed following insulin treatment of cells. Pharmacological inhibition of GSK3 mimics the effect of insulin on Phosphoenolpyruvate Carboxykinase (PEPCK), Glucose-6 Phosphatase (G6Pase) and IGF binding protein-1 (IGFBP1) gene expression. CAAT/enhancer binding protein alpha (C/EBPalpha) regulates these gene promoters in liver and is phosphorylated on two residues (T222/T226) by GSK3, although the functional outcome of the phosphorylation has not been established. We aimed to establish whether CEBPalpha is a link between GSK3 and these gene promoters.

C/EBPalpha represses the IGFBP1 thymine-rich insulin response element (TIRE), but mutation of T222 or T226 of C/EBPalpha to non-phosphorylatable alanines has no effect on C/EBPalpha activity in liver cells (towards the TIRE or a consensus C/EBP binding sequence). Phosphorylation of T222/T226 is decreased by GSK3 inhibition, suggesting GSK3 does phosphorylate T222/226 in intact cells. However, phosphorylation was not altered by treatment of liver cells with insulin. Meanwhile C/EBPalpha activity in 3T3 L1 preadipocytes was enhanced by mutation of T222/T226 and/or S230 to alanine residues. Finally, we demonstrate that C/EBPalpha is a very poor substrate for GSK3 in vitro and in cells.

Conclusion
###end title 6
###begin p 7
The work demonstrates an important role for this domain in the regulation of C/EBPalpha activity in adipocytes but not hepatocytes, however GSK3 phosphorylation of these residues does not mediate regulation of this C/EBP activity. In short, we find no evidence that C/EBPalpha activity is regulated by direct phosphorylation by GSK3.

Glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK3), an insulin-inhibited protein kinase, has been linked to the control of many cellular processes [1]. It was originally identified as the protein kinase that phosphorylated and inactivated glycogen synthase in rabbit muscle [2]. Two highly related forms of GSK3 (GSK3alpha and GSK3beta) are expressed from distinct genes [3,4]. They share greater than 95% identity in their kinase domains and appear to be ubiquitously expressed in mammals [3,4]. In resting cells GSK3 activity is high and inhibition of the kinase is achieved by at least two mechanisms, firstly through phosphorylation of an N-terminal serine residue (Ser-21 in GSK3alpha, Ser-9 in GSK3beta) [5,6], and secondly through protein protein interaction [7]. Insulin promotes the phosphorylation of Ser-9/21 of GSK3 by activation of protein kinase B (PKB, also known as c-AKT) [8], while canonical wnt signalling inhibits GSK3 independently of this N-terminal phosphorylation [9].

In liver, inhibition of GSK3 reduces expression of the Phosphoenolpyruvate Carboxykinase (PEPCK) and Glucose-6 Phosphatase (G6Pase) genes, two rate limiting enzymes in hepatic glucose production [10], as well as the IGF binding protein-1 (IGFBP1) gene [11]. These gene promoters share a related DNA sequence termed the thymine-rich insulin response element (TIRE) that plays an important role in their response to insulin [12-14]. Expression of these genes as well as GSK3 activity is abnormally high in insulin resistant states such as Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) [15-19]. Meanwhile overexpression of GSK3 antagonises insulin regulation of IGFBP1 [11]. Therefore inhibition of GSK3 is proposed as a potential target for the treatment of T2DM [1,20,21]. Indeed selective GSK3 inhibitors significantly reduce hepatic glucose output and blood glucose levels in several animal models of obesity and diabetes [22-25]. However, GSK3 is reported to have over 30 substrates, and mutation of one of these, APC, is linked to the development of colonic cancer [20,21,26]. In addition, genetic deletion of one of the isoforms (GSK3beta) leads to liver cell death, possibly due to increased sensitivity to TNFalpha [27]. Hence great care and consideration is being given to the development of GSK3 inhibitors for use in humans. With this in mind we have initiated a search for molecules that link GSK3 to the gluconeogenic gene promoters and in particular the TIRE, since inhibition of GSK3 is sufficient to repress the isolated DNA element [11]. Identification of the GSK3 substrate(s) that regulates IGFBP1, G6Pase and PEPCK gene expression, may permit manipulation of this specific interaction without affecting other GSK3 targets, thereby reducing potential side effects. GSK3 is an unusual kinase in that most substrates must be phosphorylated (primed) on a Ser/Thr four or five residues C-terminal to the GSK3 target residue (see [1] for review). Priming of the substrate is performed by a distinct protein kinase, therefore inhibition of the priming kinase indirectly inhibits GSK3 regulation of the substrate, but only those substrates primed by that particular priming kinase. Priming kinases are potential targets for more specific interference with GSK3 function.

The basic leucine zipper transcription factor, CAAT-enhancer binding protein alpha (C/EBPalpha) is a potential link between GSK3 and the gluconeogenic genes based on the following information in the literature; 1) C/EBPalpha is phosphorylated on two residues (T222 and T226, numbers refer to rodent sequence) by GSK3, although the functional effect of phosphorylation is not yet clear [28], 2) C/EBPalpha is a key molecule in the regulation of the PEPCK and G6Pase gene promoters by cAMP [29-33] and T3 [34], 3) C/EBPalpha is regulated by wnt [35] and insulin [36,37] in brown adipocytes, and the insulin regulation involves PKB (a regulator of GSK3) [37], 4) PEPCK and G6Pase expression, as well as glucose and glycogen metabolism is abnormal in animals lacking C/EBPalpha [38-40] and 5) binding of a TIRE-interacting protein is blocked using an oligonucleotide representing a known C/EBPalpha binding sequence [41].

Therefore, we attempted to determine whether C/EBPalpha could modulate the activity of the isolated TIRE, or the gene promoters of interest, in a GSK3 regulated manner. In addition, although T222/T226 of C/EBPalpha were identified as targets for GSK3 it has not previously been established whether S230 was a target for a 'priming' kinase, so we have also investigated whether mutation of S230 influences C/EBPalpha regulation.

We have previously shown that insulin, or pharmacological inhibition of GSK3, reduced the expression of endogenous PEPCK, G6Pase and IGFBP1 genes and also the activity of the isolated thymine-rich insulin response element (TIRE) found in these gene promoters [10,11]. In an attempt to further characterise the GSK3 regulation of PEPCK, G6Pase and IGFBP1 we assessed whether a target for GSK3, namely C/EBPalpha, could regulate TIRE activity. In the hepatocyte C/EBPalpha activity is linked to cAMP induction of genes, so insulin inhibition of C/EBPalpha could explain repression of these genes by insulin. In this model, phosphorylation of C/EBPalpha by GSK3 would have to induce C/EBPalpha activity toward the TIRE. Interestingly, C/EBPalpha overexpression had a repressive effect on TIRE activity in the rat hepatoma H4IIE cells (Fig 1A), and the repression was lost when the TIRE sequence was mutated at two residues to produce an insulin insensitive sequence (DM5 [42]; Fig 1A). Hence C/EBPalpha regulated the TIRE in a sequence specific and insulin-like manner. However, mutation of the GSK3-regulated residues on C/EBPalpha (T222/T226/S230) to alanines (C/EBPalpha-AAA) did not alter the ability of C/EBPalpha to repress TIRE activity (Fig 1A). One possibility is that the dephosphorylated form of C/EBPalpha repressed the TIRE, and that the overexpressed C/EBPalpha was not substantially phosphorylated by GSK3. Consistent with this hypothesis, co-expression of an active form of GSK3 reduced the effect of wild-type C/EBPalpha on the TIRE (Fig 1B). Unfortunately, increased GSK3 activity also blocked the repressive action of the C/EBPalpha-AAA (Fig 1B) clearly demonstrating that phosphorylation of T222/T226/S230 was not required for the action of GSK3 on the isolated TIRE in H4IIE cells. This data questioned the functional importance of T222/T226 phosphorylation in the regulation of C/EBPalpha activity.

It was therefore important to establish whether T222 and T226 were actually phosphorylated by GSK3 in intact cells. Cells were transfected with wild-type and mutant C/EBPalpha and total and phosphorylated C/EBPalpha visualised by Western Blotting. T222/226 phosphorylation, measured with this antibody, was clearly present in intact cells (Fig 2). Incubation with 1 or 2 muM of the GSK3 inhibitor CHIR99021 [11,43] for 6 or 24 h significantly reduced the phosphorylation of T222/226 of wild-type C/EBPalpha (Fig 2A), confirming that GSK3 was a T222/226 kinase in these cells. At shorter incubations, 1 muM CHIR99021 was sufficient to give maximal reduction in T222/226 phosphorylation, while 2 muM had a greater effect at 24 h incubation. This is similar to the effect of these concentrations on beta-catenin activation in the H4IIE cells [11]. Meanwhile, co-expression of active GSK3alpha (Fig 2B) only produced a marginal induction of phosphorylation (around 1.2 fold) suggesting that the expressed C/EBPalpha was either almost fully phosphorylated at T222/226 or that it was not a particularly good substrate for GSK3. Mutation of T222/226 to alanines made the mutant C/EBPalpha unresponsive to the phosphospecific antibody (see later). Interestingly, the dephosphorylation of C/EBPalpha in H4IIE cells treated with CHIR99021 was rapid, but not complete (Fig 2C). However, there was no significant reduction in T222/226 phosphorylation following up to 2 h incubation with insulin (Fig 2C and Fig 3), even though insulin promoted phosphorylation of Ser9/Ser21 of GSK3beta and GSK3alpha respectively. Insulin reduced GSK3 activity around 50% in the H4IIE cell line but this is clearly not sufficient to reduce T222/226 phosphorylation. Therefore it appears that insulin does not regulate T222/226 phosphorylation in these cells through inhibition of GSK3. However, the data suggested that some level of T222/226 phosphorylation by GSK3 occurs on the overexpressed protein (Fig 2C).

We next characterised C/EBPalpha phosphorylation by GSK3 in vitro (Fig 4). Incubation of C/EBPalpha with GSK3beta for up to one hour resulted in a slow incorporation of less than 0.03 mol phosphate per mol of protein (Fig 4A and 4B). In comparison, p42MAP kinase phosphorylation of C/EBPalpha increased over 60 min peaking around 1.5 mol per mol (Fig 4A and 4B). Phosphorylation of C/EBPalpha by p42MAP kinase did not occur at T222, T226 or S230 (see below) and is more likely to be on S21 [44]. Interestingly western blot analysis of C/EBPalpha following incubation with GSK3beta gave little indication of this slow increase in phosphorylation, and a very strong signal was obtained with the phosphospecific antibody even at low stoichiometry of phosphorylation (Fig 4C). These data demonstrated that C/EBPalpha was a relatively poor substrate for GSK3 in vitro ,but that the phospho-T222/226 antibody was highly sensitive. It is difficult to directly compare phosphorylation of C/EBPalpha with other substrates of GSK3 as most are poorly phosphorylated prior to priming. For example CRMP phosphorylation by GSK3 (under identical conditions to those used for C/EBPalpha in Fig 4) incorporates around 0.2 mol/mol phosphate within 2 h of incubation [45]. However, this increases more than 5-fold if the substrate is first primed. Of course we can never rule out the possibility that an intrinsic factor improves the GSK3-C/EBPalpha interaction in vivo ,either promoting priming at an unidentified residue or allowing greater phosphorylation by GSK3.

Many substrates of GSK3 are primed for kinase recognition by prior phosphorylation at a S/T residue four amino acids C-terminal to the target site [1]. S230 lies within this 'consensus' GSK3 targeting sequence (Table 2). Therefore S230 phosphorylation could prime for T226 phosphorylation by GSK3, permitting subsequent phosphorylation of T222 by GSK3. However, mutation of S230 to alanine had no effect on T222/226 phosphorylation in intact cells (Fig 5). This argued that S230 phosphorylation did not prime for T226 phosphorylation by GSK3 in resting cells, or that the wild-type C/EBPalpha is not being efficiently phosphorylated at S230. Since the amino acid immediately following S230 is a proline (Table 2), we hypothesised that priming may only occur after induction of a proline-directed kinase such as a member of the MAP kinase family. Therefore we attempted to induce S230 phosphorylation by incubation of cells with serum, which stimulates the classical MAP kinase and several other proline-directed kinases such as cyclin-dependent kinases. However, T222/226 phosphorylation of wild-type or S230A C/EBPalpha was not altered in serum treated cells (Fig 5B), despite activation of the p90RSK downstream of the p42/p44MAP kinase (Fig 5B). This demonstrated we could not alter S230 phosphorylation by incubating cells with or without serum. Interestingly, serum treatment induced phosphorylation of S21/9 of GSK3alpha/beta (Fig 5B), suggesting some inhibition of GSK3 occurs in the serum treated cells. This was not sufficient to reduce C/EBPalpha phosphorylation but did partially reduce glycogen synthase phosphorylation (a known substrate of GSK3 ([46]; Fig 5B). Similarly, treatment of the cells with CHIR99021 did not completely inhibit T222/226 phosphorylation (Fig 2 and Fig 3), despite a complete loss of glycogen synthase phosphorylation (Fig 5B). Therefore T222/226 must be relatively resistant to dephosphorylation or a distinct T222/226 protein kinase must be present in these cells. Again, potential substrates for GSK3 have been reported that have their priming at a residue more distant from the GSK3 target site, and we cannot discount that possibility. However, our data strongly argues against priming through S230 phosphorylation.

Prephosphorylation of CEBPalpha by p42 MAP kinase did not prime for subsequent phosphorylation by GSK3 in vitro (Fig 6A), confirming that S230 is not targeted by p42 MAP kinase. Similarly, incubation of cells with either a p42MAP kinase inhibitor (PD98059) or a p38MAP kinase inhibitor (SB203580) had no effect on phosphorylation of CEBPalpha at T222/226 (Fig 6B).

In contrast to the repressive action on TIRE activity, overexpression of C/EBPalpha in H4IIE cells induced the activity of a consensus C/EBP binding element (CBE) (Fig 7A). We were therefore able to investigate whether the GSK3 regulation of T222/T226 was dependent on the DNA sequence analysed. Mutation of T222/226/S230 to alanines (in any combination) made no difference to the induction of the CBE by C/EBPalpha (Fig 7A). Similarly, inhibition of GSK3 using CHIR99021 or insulin had no effect on CBE activity (Fig 7A and 7B). Therefore GSK3 phosphorylation of T222/226 does not regulate either induction of the CBE or repression of the TIRE in the H4IIE cells. Interestingly CBE activity was induced in the presence of the synthetic glucocorticoid dexamethasone to a similar level as that seen with C/EBPalpha overexpression (Fig 7B).

In order to establish whether changes in C/EBPalpha phosphorylation could alter expression of the insulin regulated genes IGFBP1 and G6Pase, we overexpressed C/EBPalpha in H4IIE cells using an adenoviral vector to produce almost 100% transfection efficiency (Figs 8, 9, 10). We observed no effect of C/EBPalpha expression on IGFBP1 (Fig 8) or G6Pase (Fig 9) gene expression, and no alteration in regulation of either gene by dexamethasone, insulin or CHIR99021. However, there was a significant repression of the co-expressed BP1-TIRE by C/EBPalpha when compared with its effect on the insulin resistant TIRE (DM5) (Fig 10). This suggests that C/EBPalpha overexpression represses the isolated element but has no effect on this element when it is in the context of the intact gene promoters. This is an example of the dangers of studying isolated promoter elements and extrapolating to intact gene promoters without examining endogenous regulation. Interestingly, a postnatal knockout of C/EBPalpha resulted in reduced basal expression of PEPCK and G6Pase but did not alter regulation of these genes by cAMP [40]. Again, this would argue against a repressive effect of this factor on the endogenous genes.

C/EBPalpha has an important role in adipocyte differentiation [37,47,48], therefore we transfected 3T3-L1 preadipocytes with C/EBPalpha and measured CBE activity (Fig 11A). In contrast to the H4IIE cells, mutation of T222/226 to alanines resulted in a significant increase in transactivation potential compared to wild-type C/EBPalpha (Fig 11A). This suggested that phosphorylation of these residues was inhibiting C/EBPalpha activity in these cells. Consistent with this hypothesis, inhibition of GSK3 using CHIR99021 or insulin induced wild-type C/EBPalpha activity (Fig 11A). In addition, the C/EBPalpha S230A mutant had similar transactivation potential to the AA mutant (Fig 11A), strongly suggesting that S230 was a priming site for T222/T226 phosphorylation in these cells. However we could find no evidence that phosphorylation of T222/226 was reduced in the S230A mutant (Fig 11B). Although there was a great deal of inter-experiment variation in the phosphorylation of T222/T226 in the WT and the S230A mutant there was not a significant difference between the two, and in 2 out of the three experiments the S230A mutant exhibited higher phosphorylation than the WT protein (Fig 11B). Therefore, changes in phosphorylation of these two sites cannot account for the difference in C/EBPalpha activity when the S230 site is mutated to alanine. Ideally it would be beneficial to confirm these data on endogenous gene expression in the adipocyte cell line, however these cells do not transfect efficiently with the adenoviral constructs making it impossible to examine their effect on endogenous genes.

In summary, C/EBPalpha is not the link between GSK3 and the hepatic TIRE-containing gene promoters. However, C/EBPalpha can regulate the TIRE, at least when overexpressed, and the residues T222/226 and S230 all influence C/EBPalpha function in preadipocytes. Interestingly we demonstrate opposite effects of C/EBPalpha overexpression on TIRE and CBE activity, and a tissue specific role for the T222/226 motif in this activity. Our data also provides further evidence of the differences in transcription factor activity when measured using isolated promoter elements as opposed to intact gene promoters. During the course of this study a regulation of C/EBPbeta by GSK3 in adipocytes was reported [49]. Therefore it will be of interest to confirm whether this C/EBP isoform is the link between GSK3 inhibition and TIRE regulation in hepatocytes.
