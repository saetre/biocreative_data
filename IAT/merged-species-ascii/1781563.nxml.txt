We investigated the serum macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) levels of palmoplantar pustulosis patients, before and after the tonsillar provocation test. Higher serum MIF levels of palmoplantar pustulosis patients were decreased after the tonsillar provocation test (n=29). To confirm these phenomena, two patients with acute tonsillitis had their changes in body temperature, C-reactive protein (CRP) and serum MIF levels examined during the course of their illness. Surprisingly, increased MIF preceded fever and CRP elevation, and MIF subsequently decreased at the onset of fever and CRP elevation. Since MIF is an initiator of other proinflammatory cytokines, we suggest that the induction of MIF may precede other inflammatory conditions.
