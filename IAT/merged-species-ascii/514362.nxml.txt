alphaT-catenin is a recently identified member of the alpha-catenin family of cell-cell adhesion molecules. Its expression is restricted mainly to cardiomyocytes, although it is also expressed in skeletal muscle, testis and brain. Like other alpha-catenins, alphaT-catenin provides an indispensable link between a cadherin-based adhesion complex and the actin cytoskeleton, resulting in strong cell-cell adhesion. We show here that the tissue-specificity of alphaT-catenin expression is controlled by its promoter region. By in silico analysis, we found that the alphaT-catenin promoter contains several binding sites for cardiac and muscle-specific transcription factors. By co-transfection studies in P19 embryonal carcinoma cells, we demonstrated that MEF2C and GATA-4 each have an activating effect on the alphaT-catenin promoter. Transfections with wild-type and mutant promoter constructs in cardiac HL-1 cells indicated that one GATA box is absolutely required for high alphaT-catenin promoter activity in these cells. Furthermore, we showed that the GATA-4 transcription factor specifically binds and activates the alphaT-catenin promoter in vivo in cardiac HL-1 cells. In vivo promoter analysis in transgenic mice revealed that the isolated alphaT-catenin promoter region could direct the tissue-specific expression of a LacZ reporter gene in concordance with endogenous alphaT-catenin expression.

alpha-Catenins are key molecules of the E-cadherin-mediated cell-cell adhesion complex, because they make the indispensable link to the actin cytoskeleton. The importance of this link to confer strong and functional cell-cell adhesion is illustrated by tumor cells that have lost a functional alphaE-catenin protein, a change that is associated with the loss of cell-cell aggregation and the gain of invasive capacity (1-6). Re-introduction of exogenous functional alpha-catenin results in the restoration of cell-cell adhesion and the inhibition of the invasive capacity in vitro and in vivo (3,6-9). Besides its role as an invasion-suppressor molecule, alpha-catenin has a tumor-growth suppressive capacity. This was recently demonstrated by a conditional knock-out of alphaE-catenin in the epidermis (10). Ablation of alphaE-catenin expression in the skin results in a sustained activation of the Ras-MAPK pathway leading to hyperproliferation of the epidermal cells (10).

Recently, a new member of the alpha-catenin family was identified and termed alphaT-catenin. This novel alpha-catenin shows very high sequence homology to both alphaE- and alphaN-catenins (11). alphaT-catenin expression is restricted to certain tissues. It was first discovered in testis, but also found in cardiac and skeletal muscle and in the brain (11). The distinct expression pattern of alphaT-catenin contrasts with the ubiquitous expression of the closely related alphaE-catenin. In some cell types alphaE- and alphaT-catenin are co-expressed, as is found at the intercalated discs of cardiac muscle cells, whereas in other tissues, for instance in human testis, they are differentially localized (11).

Not much is known so far about the function of this recently identified alphaT-catenin. It has been shown that alphaT-catenin can bind strongly to beta-catenin in heart and testis tissues, and in vitro data show that alphaT-catenin can function as a genuine alpha-catenin by providing a link between a cadherin-mediated cell-cell adhesion complex and the actin cytoskeleton (11). N-cadherin-mediated adhesion is critical for proper myofibril organization in cardiomyocytes (12), and altered cadherin expression in the myocardium leads to dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) (13). DCM is a 'cytoskeletalopathy', as most of the DCM genes identified so far have an influence on actin cytoskeleton organization (14). Interestingly, the gene encoding human alphaT-catenin, CTNNA3, was mapped to chromosome 10q21 (15), a region that has been linked to certain cases of dominantly inherited autosomally DCM (16). In view of its high expression in the heart and its presumed role in anchoring the actin cytoskeleton to the cadherin-mediated cell-cell adhesion complex, alphaT-catenin is considered as a good candidate gene for inherited or sporadic DCM. However, so far no final evidence for such causative link has been found (15). Besides their structural role in cell-cell adhesion, alpha-catenins have also been implicated in signaling events. Similar to other alpha-catenins, alphaT-catenin is also able to inhibit Wnt signaling (17). Based on this finding and on the chromosomal position of alphaT-catenin, a link between alphaT-catenin gene variation and late-onset of Alzheimer disease has been proposed (17,18).

The close relation of alpha-catenin genes and their partly overlapping expression patterns makes understanding the transcriptional regulation of these genes of considerable interest. Moreover, due to the particular expression pattern of alphaT-catenin being restricted to a very limited number of tissues, its promoter must be very tightly regulated and is thus an interesting object to study.

Extensive study of the cardiac-specific gene regulatory network has shown that MEF2C, Nkx2.5 and GATA proteins are key transcriptional regulators in the heart (19). GATA factors are Cys4 zinc finger transcription factors with GATA-4, -5 and -6 playing roles in the development and proper function of the heart [for review see (20)]. Members of the MEF2 family of MADS-box transcription factors are expressed at high levels in all muscle cells, and MEF2C is essential for proper heart development [for review see (21)]. Overexpressed MEF2C can initiate cardiomyogenesis in embryonic carcinoma cells (22). In cardiomyocytes, MEF2C acts together with GATA factors to induce gene transcription (23). Apart from their role in heart-specific gene regulation, certain GATA factors and MEF2C are also expressed in other tissues exhibiting alphaT-catenin expression. MEF2C is found in skeletal muscle cells, where it strongly potentiates the transcriptional activity of MyoD, and in post-mitotic neurons in the brain, whereas GATA-4 is involved in gene regulation in the testis (24).

A human bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) library (Genome Systems Inc.) was screened by a PCR specific for the first exon of the CTNNA3 gene (5'-TGTCATCTGCCTCTCAATTTG-3', 5'-ATGCTGCCTTTCTGTTTCTTC-3'). One positive BAC clone was obtained. Fragments containing exon 1 were identified by Southern hybridization with an exon-1-specific primer and subcloned into the pGEM11 vector to generate pGEM11-halphaTctnprom. Clones of interest were identified by colony hybridization and sequenced. A sequence of 3412 bp of the human alphaT-catenin promoter was deposited in the GenBank database (GenBank accession no.

Nuclear extracts of HL-1 cells were prepared by controlled NP-40 lysis. Briefly, confluent cell monolayers in 75 mm2 dishes were washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), harvested by scraping in PBS, and centrifuged at 1500 g for 5 min. The pellets were washed once with PBS and pelleted again as before. The cell pellets were suspended in buffer 1 [10 mM HEPES, pH 7.5, 10 mM KCl, 1 mM MgCl2, 0.5 mM EDTA, 0.1 mM EGTA, 5% glycerol, 2 mM Pefabloc (Pentapharm Ltd, Basel, Switzerland), 0.5 mM DTT and 0.15 IU/ml aprotinin] and the cells were allowed to swell on ice for 15 min. The cells were then lysed by adding 0.6% NP-40 in buffer 1 and vortex-mixed briefly. Lysates were centrifuged at full speed for 15 min and the cytoplasmic fraction was discarded. Nuclei pellets were resuspended in buffer 2 (20 mM HEPES, pH 7.5, 1 mM MgCl2, 400 mM NaCl, 10 mM KCl, 20% glycerol, 0.5 mM EDTA, 0.1 mM EGTA, 2 mM Pefabloc, 0.5 mM DTT and 0.15 IU/ml aprotinin) containing 1% NP-40, vortex-mixed well and centrifuged for 15 min at full speed. The supernatant (nuclear extract) was recovered and dialyzed overnight against 1.6x EMSA binding buffer (20 mM HEPES, pH 7.9, 100 mM KCl, 2 mM DTT, 1 mM EDTA and 20% glycerol) with one buffer change.

The mixture was incubated at 30degreesC for 30 min and loaded directly onto a 6% non-denaturing polyacrylamide gel in 0.5x Tris-borate-EDTA buffer. For competition experiments, cold competitors were added to the reaction mixture simultaneously with the labeled probe. For supershift assays, a GATA-4 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc., Santa Cruz, CA) was added to the DNA/nuclear extract mix, and the reactions were allowed to proceed for 20 min before loading the samples.

We used the ChIP assay kit from Active Motif (Carlsbad, CA). Briefly, sample cell lysates were sonicated with a Sonics Vibra Cell (Newtown, CT), equipped with four 3 mm stepped microtips at 25% power, in this way simultaneously shearing four samples of 350 mul in 1.5 ml Eppendorf tubes. Samples were sonicated 15 times for 15 s with intermittent cooling on ice water for 30 s. The chromatin-antibody protein complex was eluted from the protein-G-Sepharose beads with freshly prepared elution buffer (0.2 M NaHCO3 and 1% SDS). NaCl was added to each ChIP eluate to a final concentration of 200 mM before heating the mixture at 65degreesC for 4 h to reverse the cross link. The samples were digested with proteinase K for 2 h at 42degreesC. The DNA from the samples was purified using DNA minicolumns and eluted in water. The GATA-3, GATA-4 and GATA-6 antibodies used were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology.

Primers for PCR analysis for ChIP of the mouse alphaT-catenin promoter were designed using primer Express software (Perkin-Elmer Applied Biosystems). Sequences of primers for the murine proximal alphaT-catenin promoter sequence (-146 to -15) were 5'-TTATTTAGAGCTTCCGAAGA-3' (forward), 5'-GGTGGGTGGTATCTAATCC-3' (reverse); primers for a distal region of the alphaT-catenin promoter (-3373 to -3324), which we designated the distal promoter, were 5'-AATCCTGGGCCATACATGTT-3' (forward) and 5'-TGTGCTGGCATCCATAAGAC-3' (reverse). To detect the amplified promoter regions the SyBr green I reagent mix (Eurogentec, Belgium) was used. The average threshold cycle (Ct) values of triplicate measurements were used for all subsequent calculations on the basis of the delta Ct method.

A construct containing 2917 bp of the human alphaT-catenin promoter, the alphaT-catenin exon 1 sequence and 153 bp of the intron 1 sequence was designed to direct expression of the LacZ reporter gene. To obtain this, the luciferase coding sequence from the pGL3Basic vector was exchanged with the beta-galactosidase coding sequence. The plasmid was digested with SalI to reduce the amount of vector sequences, leaving intact a 6681 bp fragment containing the above-mentioned alphaT-catenin gene fragment and the beta-galactosidase coding sequence. This fragment was purified by agarose gel electrophoresis followed by two consecutive ethanol precipitations, and injected into the pronuclei of fertilized eggs from FVB mice. The manipulated oocytes were transferred into the oviducts of pseudopregnant foster mothers. The transgenic mice were generated in collaboration with Thromb-X nv (Leuven, Belgium).

Sequence analysis of the human alphaT-catenin promoter region and a search in the transcription factor binding site database (Transfac database; ; ) (31) revealed several putative binding sites for cardiac- and muscle-specific transcription factors. A MEF2C consensus site, several GATA-binding sites, an Nkx2.5 site and a binding site for helix-loop-helix transcription factors eHAND and dHAND were identified. All these regulatory elements were within 300 bp upstream of the transcription initiation site. Parts of the mouse and rat promoter regions were identified by BLAST analysis using the mouse ortholog of the human alphaT-catenin. Sequence alignments showed high sequence conservation only in the proximal alphaT-catenin promoter region. Interestingly, two GATA boxes, the MEF2C site and the HAND binding site, are conserved in the three different species (Figure 1).

We used co-transfection studies to assess the contribution of the above-mentioned cis-acting elements and their respective transcription factors to the activation of the alphaT-catenin gene (Figure 2A). Co-transfection into P19 cells of a MEF2C expression plasmid with an alphaT-catenin promoter luciferase construct activated the promoter on average 12-fold (Figure 2B). Mutation of the MEF2C consensus site abolished this activating effect almost completely. Also GATA-4 was able to transactivate the alphaT-catenin promoter after co-transfection into P19 cells, although only about 3- to 4-fold (Figure 2C). Only mutagenesis of the GATA box2 element could destroy this activation effect. Remarkably, the mutation of this GATA box2 site also diminished the effect of MEF2C on the promoter (Figure 2B, 5). Indeed, mutation of both the MEF2C site and the GATA box2 element is needed to completely destroy the activating effect of MEF2C on the alphaT-catenin promoter (Figure 2B, 6).

Co-transfection of GATA-4 and low amounts of MEF2C with the promoter constructs led to the synergistic activation of the alphaT-catenin promoter, pointing to cooperation between MEF2C and GATA-4 in activating the alphaT-catenin promoter (Figure 3).

The alphaT-catenin promoter was tested for tissue-specific activity by the transfection of a reporter construct in cell lines of a different origin and its activity was compared with the SV40 promoter activity (Figure 4A). HL-1 is a mouse cardiac-muscle cell line that can be repeatedly passaged in culture without losing its cardiac-specific phenotype (26). Using RT-PCR and western-blot analysis with an alphaT-catenin-specific polyclonal antibody (11), we found that HL-1 cells express alphaT-catenin (Figure 4B), while all other cell lines tested did not express alphaT-catenin. Hence, HL-1 cells should have all the necessary transcription factors to confer expression of the alphaT-catenin gene. Indeed, the activity of the alphaT-catenin promoter in these cells was demonstrated by transient transfection with alphaT-catenin promoter luciferase constructs (Figure 4A). In contrast, the alphaT-catenin promoter showed no activity after transfection in the mouse embryonal carcinoma cell line P19, in the PC3 prostate carcinoma cell line or in the MCF7/AZ epithelial cell line, pointing to a requirement for tissue-specific regulatory factors. To determine whether the MEF2C site and the GATA boxes are actually required for alphaT-catenin promoter activity in HL-1 cells, we mutated the respective core binding sequences (Figure 4C). Mutation of the GATA box2 element reduced the alphaT-catenin promoter activity in HL-1 cells to background levels. Mutation of the MEF2C site, however, had no effect on the alphaT-catenin promoter activity, although HL-1 cells do express the MEF2C transcription factor (data not shown). These results show that the GATA box2 element is absolutely required for the expression of alphaT-catenin in cultured cardiac muscle cells.

We examined whether the GATA box2 sequence is indeed bound by GATA proteins in cardiac muscle cells. Semiquantitative RT-PCR expression analysis of HL-1 cells for all the six known GATA factors revealed that GATA factor 4 is most prominently expressed, whereas GATA-3, GATA-5 and GATA-6 are weakly to moderately expressed (data not shown). No expression of GATA-1 or GATA-2 was detected. In an EMSA using wild-type and mutant probes encompassing the GATA box2 element (Table 1), the labeled GATA box2 probe formed a sequence-specific DNA-protein complex when incubated with nuclear extracts from HL-1 cells (Figure 5A). The formation of this complex was prevented by addition of a 100-fold excess of the unlabeled probe whereas the competition was far less extensive when using excess cold mutated GATA-box2 oligonucleotide or excess of a probe containing the MEF2C site. To determine if GATA-4 was involved in the shifted complex, we performed a supershift analysis with a GATA-4-specific antibody. As can be seen in Figure 5B, addition of this antibody to the binding reaction resulted in a weak supershifted band. To further confirm binding of GATA-4 to the GATA box2 site, a DNA precipitation assay was performed. A biotinylated wild-type GATA box2 oligonucleotide was able to extract GATA-4 from HL-1 nuclear extracts, which was not possible with the mutated oligonucleotide (Figure 5C). Moreover, ChIP analysis revealed that a proximal alphaT-catenin promoter region containing the GATA-box2 is bound in vivo by transcription factors GATA-4 and GATA-6 but not by GATA-3 (Figure 5D). No binding could be detected to a distal alphaT-catenin promoter region.

To test tissue specificity of the cloned alphaT-catenin promoter region in vivo, we constructed transgenic mice in which the alphaT-catenin promoter drives the expression of the LacZ reporter gene. Six founder lines were identified by PCR and Southern-blot hybridization. No rearrangements of the transgene were detected. Expression of the transgene was detected initially by soaking dissected tissues in solutions containing the beta-galactosidase substrate X-gal. Blue staining was clearly detected in the brain, with prominent staining in the cerebellum, and testis, and also in discrete areas of the heart and skeletal muscle (Figure 6). In some transgenic lines the transgene was not present in the germline, while other lines did not show any expression of the transgene.

Transgenic line #10 showed high expression levels of the transgene and was further analyzed in detail. The tissue specificity of the reporter gene determined by a beta-galactosidase enzyme activity assay is shown in Figure 7. High to moderate levels of enzyme activity were detected only in brain, heart, skeletal muscle and testis. In all other tissues tested, no activity could be detected above the background. This tissue specificity is fully concordant with that found for alphaT-catenin expression by RT-PCR analysis of mouse tissues (11). To test this further, transgene expression and alphaT-catenin expression were analyzed at the cellular level, by X-gal staining and immunohistochemistry on cryosections.

X-gal staining on 10 mum cryosections of testis showed that beta-galactosidase localizes to peritubular myoid cells and to the Sertoli cells (Figure 8B). In the Sertoli cells, the beta-galactosidase staining was seen to be perinuclear, resulting in a dotted staining pattern on the outside of the testis tubule. The small blue deposits seen more centrally in the tubule represent staining in the cytoplasm of the Sertoli cells. Localization of the endogenous alphaT-catenin was visualized by incubation with an alphaT-catenin-specific antibody. In contrast to previous findings where alphaT-catenin was only found localized to the peritubular myoid cells of the human testis (11), in mouse we also found alphaT-catenin expression inside the tubule, apparently on Sertoli-cell-germ-cell contacts (Figure 8C).

In the brain, beta-galactosidase staining mainly localized to the cell bodies of neurons in the granular cell layer of the cerebellum (Figure 8E). In this cerebellum, alphaT-catenin localized in the molecular layer, adjacent to the granular layer, probably in the axons of the neurons whose cell bodies are housed in the granular layer of the cerebellum (Figure 8F).

To understand the mechanism of tissue-specific expression of the alphaT-catenin gene in testis, brain, heart and skeletal muscle, we cloned the 5' flanking promoter region of the human gene CTNNA3. Sequence alignments of the human, rat and mouse promoter regions show very high sequence conservation of the first 300 bp upstream of the transcription initiation site. Within these short 5' flanking sequences, a number of conserved regulatory elements were identified, including binding sites for GATA factors, MEF2C and E47/HAND. These binding sites are conserved in both sequence and mutual spacing. We demonstrated that these transcription factors readily transactivate the alphaT-catenin promoter in a specific manner, as mutation of the core binding site interfered with the transactivating potential of the respective transcription factors.

Further, we showed that GATA-4 is directly involved in regulating alphaT-catenin expression in cardiac muscle cells. The GATA-4 transcription factor specifically binds the GATA box2 sequence in the alphaT-catenin promoter as demonstrated by EMSA and DNA precipitations. Furthermore, ChIP analysis showed the in vivo binding of GATA-4 only to a proximal alphaT-catenin promoter region that contains the GATA box2 sequence, while no binding was observed to a distal promoter region. This GATA box2 sequence is critical for cardiac expression of the alphaT-catenin gene, as mutation of this GATA box2 sequence completely abolished alphaT-catenin promoter activity in transfected cardiac HL-1 cells. All these data together show that GATA-4 is an essential factor in regulating alphaT-catenin expression. GATA-4 is a member of the GATA family of zinc finger transcription factors and shows high expression in both the atrium and the ventricle throughout development [for review see (20)]. This GATA-4 transcription factor is known to regulate the expression of a number of cardiac-specific genes, among them cardiac troponin (32), corin (33), atrial natriuretic factor (34), cardiac sarcolemmal Na+-Ca+ exhanger (35) and B-type natriuretic peptide (36). Interestingly, GATA-4 also emerged as a transcriptional activator of the N-cadherin gene in cardiac muscle cells (37). It thus appears that one of the roles of GATA-4 in cardiac morphogenesis is the establishment of a functional cadherin/catenin complex in cardiomyocytes.

Expression analysis of other GATA factors in HL-1 cells revealed that in addition to GATA-4 there is also expression of GATA-3, GATA-5 and GATA-6 in this cardiac muscle cell line. We assessed in particular the activating role of GATA-4 on the alphaT-catenin promoter as this is the GATA factor expressed most prominently in HL-1 cells. But other GATA factors could have similar effects, as they all seem to recognize the same target sequence. Indeed, we showed in HL-1 cells that in addition to GATA-4, GATA-6 also binds the endogenous alphaT-catenin promoter, whereas GATA-3 does not. GATA-6 is known to colocalize with GATA-4 in the nucleus of cardiac myocytes (32) and hence can together with GATA-4 play a role in activation of transcription from the alphaT-catenin promoter in cardiac muscle cells. Cooperation of GATA-4 and GATA-6 transcription factors in controlling tissue-specific transcription has been reported previously (38).

The MEF2C transcription factor was able to transactivate the alphaT-catenin promoter in co-transfection studies. Involvement of this factor in regulating cardiac expression of alphaT-catenin expression is less clear. Mutation of the MEF2C site had no effect on alphaT-catenin promoter activity in cardiac HL-1 cells. However, it has been described that MEF2C can exert its effect via GATA boxes as well (23). This is also clear from our co-transfection studies in P19 cells: mutation of the MEF2C site only partially abolished MEF2C transactivation and mutation of the GATA box2 site was also necessary to completely destroy the activating effect of MEF2C on the alphaT-catenin promoter. On the other hand, we have been unable to detect MEF2C in a complex bound to the GATA box2 sequence by DNA precipitations or EMSA supershift analysis (data not shown). So far, we have no evidence for a direct role for MEF2C in cardiac expression of alphaT-catenin, but we certainly cannot exclude it.

Another major finding of this study is that the cloned alphaT-catenin promoter region can direct tissue-specific expression of a reporter gene both in vitro, and in vivo in transgenic mice. In the transgenic mice the beta-galactosidase transgene showed expression in heart, testis, brain and skeletal muscle, which exactly concurs with endogenous alphaT-catenin expression. Apparently most information required to direct spatial alphaT-catenin gene activation is comprised within the cloned promoter sequence. Our in vitro studies have shown that GATA-4 is involved in activating the alphaT-catenin promoter in cardiac muscle cells, but this transcription factor is also a key regulator of gonadal gene transcription (24). In testis GATA-4 is expressed in the Sertoli cells (39) and here it transactivates a number of testis-specific genes (24). Our in vivo studies with transgenic mice showed alphaT-catenin promoter activity in Sertoli cells, strongly suggesting that GATA-4 is also involved in regulating testis-specific expression of alphaT-catenin. alphaT-catenin expression in Sertoli cells was also somewhat less restricted than in previous findings, where alphaT-catenin was only detected in the peritubular myoid cells of human testis (11). This difference in localization may be due to species differences between man and mouse. Nonetheless, we successfully used the human alphaT-catenin promoter for mouse transgenesis as the human and mouse promoters show very high sequence identity and conservation of the regulatory elements.

The alphaT-catenin promoter is also highly active in the brain in vivo, which is consistent with endogenous alphaT-catenin protein expression. The factors involved in regulating brain-specific expression of alphaT-catenin could not be studied in vitro, as we found no in vitro system for culturing neurally derived cells expressing alphaT-catenin. Our in vitro data showed that MEF2C can transactivate the alphaT-catenin promoter. Apart from its expression in the heart, the MEF2C transcription factor also shows high expression in postmitotic neurons in different regions of the brain (40), and is therefore a good candidate for regulating brain-specific alphaT-catenin expression. Future experiments will aim at verifying this.

In heart and skeletal muscle we could detect only a variegated expression of the LacZ transgene. Variegated expression is frequently observed in transgenic mice and reflects transgene silencing in a fraction of cells [for review see (41)]. The mechanism is poorly understood, but it is believed to involve epigenetic modification of the transgene due to chromosomal position effects (42). A remarkable finding is that the position effect variegation in our transgenics was only evident in cardiac and skeletal muscle cells, while in brain and testis transgene expression was apparently not influenced by its chromosomal position. The 2917 bp alphaT-catenin promoter region used for transgenesis may lack an insulator element or locus control region that mitigates variegating position effects in heart and skeletal muscle. Altogether, our studies show that transgene expression driven by the 2917 bp alphaT-catenin promoter sequence occurs exclusively in the heart, testis, brain and skeletal muscle.

In conclusion, we report on the cloning of the promoter region of the alphaT-catenin gene and show that it is responsible for the observed tissue-restricted expression of this alpha-catenin. We demonstrate a functional role for the GATA-4 transcription factor and a possible role for MEF2C in this tissue-restricted expression of alphaT-catenin.
