The mouse genome carries one gene and two pseudogenes for cytoplasmic thymidine kinase. The overall structure of these genes was determined with the help of cosmids and lambda phage clones and the upstream sequence containing the promoter was determined. The data allow an allocation of bands seen in the complex patterns of genomic Southern blots obtained from the DNA of wild type cells and of thymidine kinase deficient mutants to the gene as well as to the two pseudogenes. The much used LTK cell line was found to lack the entire gene but to retain the pseudogenes. Two other TK cell lines had DNA patterns indistinguishable from the wild type. Whereas the LTK line did not produce any TKmRNA, the two other mutants had normal amounts of TKmRNA but no cytoplasmic TK activity.
