Diabetic nephropathy is characterized by an expansion of the glomerular mesangium, caused by mesangial cell proliferation and an excessive accumulation of extracellar matrix (ECM) proteins, which eventually leading to glomerulosclerosis. TGF-beta1 was found to play an important role in the accumulation of ECM in the kidney. In this study, TGF-beta1 RNA interference was used as an effective therapeutic strategy. The inhibitory effect of TGF-beta1 small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) on the high glucose-induced overexpression of TGF-beta1 in rat mesangial ceys (RMCs). A high levels of glucose induces TGF-beta1 mRNA and protein, and TGF-beta1 siRNAs reduce the ability of high glucose to stimulate their expression. We also examined the inhibitory effect of TGF-beta1 siRNAs on the expression of plasminogen activator inhibitor (PAI)-1 and Collagen Type I which are down-regulators of TGF-beta1. The expression of TGF-beta1, PAI-1 and Collagen Type I was increased in RMCs that were stimulated by 30 mM glucose. TGF-beta1 siRNAs reduces high glucose-induced TGF-beta1, PAI-1, and Collagen Type I mRNA and protein expression in a dose-dependent manner. In conclusion, the present study demonstrates that TGF-beta1 siRNAs effectively inhibits TGF-beta1 mRNA and protein expression in RMCs. These suggest that TGF-beta1 siRNAs through RNAi may be a useful tool for developing new therapeutic applications for the treatment of diabetic nephropathy.

Diabetic nephropathy is characterized by an expansion of the glomerular mesangium, caused by mesangial cell proliferation and an excessive accumulation of extracellar matrix (ECM) proteins, eventually leading to glomerulosclerosis and renal failure (1,2). Glomerulosclerosis is one of the complications associated with diabetes. Mesangial expansion caused by cell proliferation and glomerular ECM accumulation is one of the earliest renal abnormalities observed at the onset of hyperglycemia in diabetes mellitus (3). Because hyperglycemia is assumed to trigger the glomerulosclerosis that results from an imbalance in the control of glomerular mesangial cells proliferation (4), glomerular mesangial cells cultured in high glucose medium have been used as a model to study unbalanced gene expression in diabetes (5). High levels of glucose induce the production of transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta1, plasminogen activator inhibitor (PAI)-1, collagen, fibronectin, protein kinase C, collagen, matrix metalloprotein-2. It also increases the activities of transcription factors such as NF-kappaB, which regulate the transcription of genes that are involved in glomerulosclerosis (6-8). Investigations of glomerular mesangial cells and proximal tubularcells have demonstrated that high glucose media induces the enhanced expression of TGF-beta1 mRNA and protein, the biosynthesis of collagen and other ECM constituents (9-11).

TGF-beta1 is a multifunctional cytokine that plays an important role in wound healing, cell proliferation, differentiation, apoptosis, immune response and ECM remodeling. TGF-beta1 is a critical cytokine involved in diabetes-induced ECM in both cell cultures and animal models of diabetic kidney disease. TGF-beta1 plays a central role in tissue repair by stimulating the balanced expression of ECM such as collagen, fibronectin and matrix proteoglycans. Thus suppression of TGF-beta1 could be an effective strategy for the prevention of glomerulosclerosis.

RNAi, a process of sequence-specific gene suppression is a known as a natural gene regulatory mechanism. Small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) mediate RNAi, a process in which target mRNAs are degraded. It has recently been reported that siRNAs technology can be used to produce post-transcriptional gene silencing in mammalian cells. The mechanisms of RNAi have become more defined. When dsRNAs are introduced into an organism, the sequence-specific destruction of endogenous target mRNAs occurs. This process involves the cleavage of dsRNAs into active 21-23 nucleotide (nt) length siRNAs by Dicer (12) or another RNase III-like enzyme (13). These siRNAs are incorporated into a RNAi-induced silencing complex (14) and are then used as a guide to degrade the corresponding mRNA (15).

The aim of the present study was to investigate the effect of TGF-beta1 siRNAs on the high glucose-induced overexpression of TGF-beta1 in the rat mesangial cells (RMCs). We also examined the inhibitory effect of TGF-beta1 siRNAs on the expression of PAI-1 and Collagen Type I which are down-regulators of TGF-beta1. We applied the TGF-beta1 siRNAs strategy to suppress the proliferation and gene expression of RMCs induced by high glucose levels.

Diabetic nephropathy is characterized by an expansion of the glomerular mesangium, caused by mesangial cell proliferation and an excessive accumulation of ECM proteins, eventually leading to glomerulosclerosis and renal failure. The manifestation of diabetic nephropathy may be a consequence of the actions of certain cytokines and growth factors. Prominent among these is TGF-beta1 because it promotes mesangial cell expansion and stimulates ECM accumulation, in diabetic renal disease (18).

TGF-beta1 has been implicated as an etiologic cause in its progression. TGF-beta1 is a key mediator of the hyperglycemia-induced panoramic effects on cell growth and ECM (19-21). In addition, this cytokine has powerful fibrogenic potential because of its capability for simultaneous actions such as the stimulation of matrix synthesis, the inhibition of matrix degradation, and the modulation of matrix receptor expression to facilitate cell matrix interactions (22). High levels of glucose increases TGF-beta1 expression, and the cell expansion and matrix-stimulatory effects of high glucose are prevented by anti-TGF-beta1 therapy. Thus, TGF-beta1 is considered to be a therapeutic target in diabetic nephropathy and other chronic kidney diseases, and anti-TGF-beta1 therapies have also been performed (23-25).

The aim of gene therapy is to replace defective genes in target tissue by delivering correct versions of them in the form of an expression vector. Recent progress in molecular biology has provided new techniques to inhibit target gene expression. Gene therapies have been attempted by antisense ODN, decoy, ribozyme, and RNAi. More recently, gene therapy using RNAi as one of the anti-TGF-beta1 therapies has been investigated and have been applied to renal disease.

The TGF-beta1 expression was increased by 1.8 fold in RMCs stimulated by 30 mM glucose. In addition, they effectively inhibited the expression of TGF-beta1 mRNA and protein in RMCs stimulated by 30 mM glucose. These results are consistent with the notion that the transfection of TGF-beta1 siRNAs siRNAs is effective in reducing TGF-beta1 expression. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the efficiency of TGF-beta1 siRNAs, to accomplish this fluorescein-labeled-TGF-beta1 siRNAs were introduced into RMCs using the Mirus Transfer IT. Fluorescence microscopy of RMCs that had been transfected with Fluorescein- labeled-TGF-beta1 siRNAs were observed in both the nuclei and the cytoplasm. The effect of TGF-beta1 siRNAs on the endogenous gene expression of PAI-1 and Collagen Type I was also examined in RMCs. High glucose levels significantly stimulates RMCs to increase the endogenous translation of PAI-1 and Collagen Type I. The transfection of RMCs with the TGF-beta1 siRNAs resulted in a significant attenuation of high glucose stimulation-induced gene expression. This suggests that TGF-beta1 siRNAs effectively suppress the translation of endogenous genes that are involved in ECM formation. High glucose levels significantly stimulate RMCs to increase the endogenous transcription of PAI-1 and Collagen Type I. The transfection of RMCs with the TGF-beta1 siRNAs resulted in a significant attenuation of high glucose stimulation-induced gene expression. This suggests that TGF-beta1 siRNAs effectively suppress the transcription of endogenous genes that are involved in ECM formation (26-28).

To evaluate the influence of hyperglycemia on the proliferation of primary RMCs, we investigated the ability of TGF-beta1 siRNAs to inhibit cell growth. High levels of glucose significantly stimulated the growth of primary RMCs. The transfection of RMCs with TGF-beta1 siRNAs resulted in a significant suppression of the cell growth stimulated by high glucose. These results suggest that TGF-beta1 siRNAs effectively suppresses the proliferation of RMCs, as well as the expression of genes that are involved in the accumulation of ECM proteins.

In summary, in this study, we applied TGF-beta1 siRNAs strategy to suppress TGF-beta1 overexpression the cell proliferation of RMCs induced by a high glucose concentrations. The suppressive effect of TGF-beta1 siRNAs was also applied to the expression of PAI-1 and Collagen Type I which are down-regulators of TGF-beta1. Our results demonstrate that TGF-beta1 siRNAs efficiently suppressed the expression of mesangium matrix component genes and inhibited high glucose-induced mesangial cell proliferation. This siRNAs mechanism invented by nature to protect the genome provides us with ideal tools to analyse gene function and for targeting any transcript in any cell with a high efficiency and specificity. These findings suggest that TGF-beta1 siRNAs may be a useful tool for developing new therapeutic applications for the prevention of progressive diabetic nephropathy.
