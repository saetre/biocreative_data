The nucleotide sequence of the intracisternal A-particle genome IAP-IL3 is presented. This IAP element was found to have inserted upstream of the promoter of the interleukin-3 gene of the leukemia cell line WEHI-3B. IAP-IL3 is 5095 bp in length, with identical long terminal repeats (LTRs) of 337 bp. The LTRs show many of the conserved sequence elements identified in other retroviruses. Comparison with other available sequences of IAP genomes indicates that IAP-IL3 is a deleted type I element. It carries a deletion covering the 3' end of the putative IAP gag gene and extending into the 5' end of the putative IAP pol gene. IAP-IL3 has extensive sequence homology with an IgE-binding factor cDNA and evidence is presented indicating that it was derived from a member of the mouse IAP sequence family. Comparison between the pol region of IAP-IL3 and other retroviruses suggests that IAP-IL3 is most closely related to type B and type D retroviruses.
