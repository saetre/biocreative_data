Transcripts for six Leishmania tarentolae maxicircle structural genes (cytochrome oxidase subunits I, II and III, cytochrome b, human mitochondrial unidentified reading frames 4 and 5) and several unidentified open reading frames were mapped, and the locations of the 5' ends determined by primer runoff analysis. All genes studied here are transcribed from the same strand as the 12S and 9S ribosomal RNAs except for the cytochrome oxidase subunit I gene. In two cases (ORF3 and ORF4, ORF5 and ORF6), a single transcript covers two contiguous overlapping reading frames. The 5' ends of the RNAs are located 20-64 nt from the putative translation initiation codons. Primary transcripts from a mitochondrial RNA preparation were 5' end-labeled with guanylyltransferase and alpha -32P-GTP; the major labeled species comigrated with the 12S and 9S mitochondrial rRNAs, and in addition there were at least four higher molecular weight labeled species.
