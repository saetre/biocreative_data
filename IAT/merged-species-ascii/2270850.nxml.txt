Gliomas are the most common and aggressive primary brain tumors for which unfortunately no effective treatment modalities exist despite advances in molecular biology as the knowledge base to unravel the extremely complex molecular mechanisms of tumorigenesis is limited. In this study an attempt has been made to understand the molecular pathological basis of tumorigenesis which led to an identification of an oncogene, CDC2, and an epigenetic strategy has been evaluated to control the tumorigensis by downregulating this oncogene.

Tissue microarrays were utilized to investigate the expression of genes in a large number of tumor samples and to identify overexpressed genes which could be potentially causing tumorigenesis. Retroviral vectors expressing short hairpin RNAs (shRNAs) targeted against CDC2 were designed and transducted into human glioma cell line ex vivo in order to downregulate the expression of CDC2. Real-Time PCR was used to determine the level of CDC2 mRNA. Western Blotting was used to determine the level of expression of CDC2 protein as measure to quantify down regulation of CDC2 expression along with use of flow cytometry to investigate effect of shRNAs on cell cycles and detection of apoptosis. Following ex vivo study, viral particles containing small interfering RNA for CDC2 were subsequently injected into xenogeneic graft tumor of nude mice and the weight of human glioma xenografts, survival and resulting phenotypic changes of target gene were investigated.

Human glioma tissue microarrays indicated the positive expression rates of CDC2/CyclinB1 with a positive correlation with pathologic grades (r = 0.982, r = 0.959, respectively). Retroviral vectors expressing short hairpin RNAs (shRNAs) against CDC2 caused efficient deletion of CDC2, cellular G2/M arrest concluding in apoptosis and inhibition of proliferation in human glioma cells U251 and SHG-44 cell lines ex vivo. And the viral particles containing small interfering RNA for CDC2 were subsequently injected into subcutaneous and intracranial xenogeneic graft tuomrs of nude mice. For subcutaneous tumors, injection of CDC2-shRNA retroviruses significantly decreased tumor weight and volume compared with control. Immunohistochemistry indicated that CDC2 are negative and TUNEL are positive in tumors treated with recombinant retrovirus. For mice implanted with intracranial gliomas, treatment of CDC2-shRNA retroviruses increased survival times compared with control.

Abnormalities in cell cycle regulation are reported to be strongly associated with tumorigenesis and progression of tumors. The cell cycle is a complex process with myriad genes involved and elaborate and complex signaling mechanisms to allow for this critical cellular process. In eukaryotes, the entry into mitosis is regulated by the activation of CDC2/Cyclin B1 complex (M-phase promoting factor, MPF). CDC2 is known as an active sub-unit of the MPF. It is inhibited by Cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors (CKI). Appropriate regulation of CDC2 is essential for the entry into mitosis. Increasingly numerous results have demonstrated overexpression of CDC2/Cyclin B1 in various tumors however there is still no report of CDC2/Cyclin B1 expression in clinical samples from patients with gliomas.

A total of 71 gliomas of the cerebral hemisphere, resected at the 1st and 2nd affiliated Hospital of Soochow University were studied. These tumors were from 40 men and 31 women, ranging in age from 4 to 80 (mean, 41.04) years at diagnosis. All of these patients did not receive chemotherapy and radiation before surgical removal. Tumors were classified and graded using the World Health Organization (WHO) scheme (2000) (grades I-IV) [8]. Eleven normal brain tissues were gathered from consent-informed individuals who underwent partial removal of the temporal lobe for cerebral decompression. SHG44 multicellular tumor spheres (n = 4), GBM multicellular tumor spheres (n = 4), brain tumor stem cell spheres (n = 4) and neural stem cell spheres (n = 4) were centrifuged and embedded in melted 3% agarose gel to form agarose cell blocks (ACBs) [9]. Tissue microarray (TMA) technique was used for immunohistochemical study [10]. The tumor samples and cell blocks were fixed in 4% phosphate buffered formaldehyde and processed into paraffin blocks with standard methods. Histologically representative tumor regions of hematoxylin-eosin (HE) stained slides were selected by a neuropathologist (Professor Liu zhen yan) and corresponding areas were sampled in tissue microarray blocks with the aid of manual tissue microarrayer (Bo Nan Biotechnology Inc. Shanghai, China) according to the manufacturer's instruction. The sample diameter of the tissue core in the microarray block was 600 mum.

The pSUPER.retro.puro purchased from OligoEngine was a vector system for expression of short interfering RNA. Recombinant retroviral vectors expressing short hairpin RNAs were constructed according to the product manual. Three pairs of oligonucleotides were designed. The shRNA1, 3 corresponds to positions 256-274, 789-807 of the CDC2 open reading frame, respectively. The oligoengine workstation software gives the effect target corresponds to positions 908 of the CDC2 open reading frame. But we designed C4 target corresponds to positions 909 (909-927). We want to know whether it was an "inactive target" (Figure 2). These forward and reverse oligos were annealed and cloned into the vector between the unique BglII and HindIII enzyme sites. The presence of the correct insert of recombinant pSUPER.retro vectors (C1, C3, C4) were confirmed by sequencing (BIO BASIC Inc, Shanghai, China; Sequencing primer 5'-GGA AGC CTT GGC TTT TG-3').

In CDC2/CyclinB1 immunostaining, CDC2/CyclinB1 was expressed in the nuclei of tumor cells. Histologically, high-grade gliomas tended to express high CDC2/CyclinB1 protein levels than that in lower grade gliomas. The immunoreactivity of CDC2/CyclinB1 showed appreciably strong staining intensity among the high-grade brain tumors. Statistically significant difference in CDC2 expression was observed between grade I and III, grade I and IV, grade II and III, grade II and IV (P = 0.005, P = 0.008, P = 0.009, P = 0.020, respectively). Also, statistically significant difference in CyclinB1 expression was observed among different grade. Furthermore, the positive expression rates of CDC2/CyclinB1 were positively correlated with the pathologic grades (r = 0.982, r = 0.959, respectively) (Figure 4, Table 1). Expression of CDC2/CyclinB1 was very high in SHG44 and GBM, but was negative in brain tumor stem cell spheres and neural stem cell spheres. The positive expression rates of CDC2 correlated with CyclinB1 (r = 0.900, P < 0.01).

As CDC2 is one of the key components for the regulation of cell proliferation, the anti-proliferative effect of recombinant C1 or C3 on human glioma cell lines was analysed. Compared to control treatment with blank retroviral vector (C0) and transfection reagent oligofectamine alone (X), transfection with recombinant C1 or C3 reduced the number of SHG44 cells by 82%, 92% at 48 h, and 95%, 97% at 72 h, respectively. At 96 h, no SHG44 cells were detectable with recombinant C1 or C3 treatment. However, treatment with the transfection recombinant C4 had no effect on inhibition of proliferation in SHG44 cells. The result indicated C4 was an "inactive target" (Figure 5). Anti-proliferation of recombinant C1 or C3 was more robust in U251 cells. The number of U251 cells was reduced by 90% (C1) and 93% (C3) at 24 h, and 94%, 98% at 48 h, respectively. At 72 h, no U251 cells were detectable with recombinant C1 or C3 treatment.

Due to the tremendous anti-proliferation, we failed to harvest enough cells to perform RT-PCR and Western blot analysis on U251 cells, and therefore analyses were performed on SHG44 cells 48 h after transfection with the recombinant retroviral vectors to examine the effects of the three recombinant retroviral vectors on CDC2 mRNA and protein expression. mRNA level of CDC2 was significantly downregulated after the transfection with recombinant C1 or C3 as compared to negative controls, off-target sequence C4, the blank retroviral vector C0, and transfection reagent alone X (Figure 6A, lanes 1, 4 and 5). None of the recombinant retroviral vectors affected mRNA level of Cyclin B1 (Figure 6B), suggesting that these recombinant C1 C3, and C4 were highly specific. The real-time PCR revealed that mRNA level of CDC2 decreased by 98.3% and 98.5% after transfection with recombinant C1 and C3, respectively (data not shown).

Due to the strong inhibitory effect demonstrated ex vivo, recombinant C3 was selected for viral packaging. The impact of recombinant C3 retrovirus on xenogeneic graft tumors was examined in vivo. Virus titer was 2.15 x 107 RCFU (relative colony forming unit). Xenogeneic graft tumors treated with saline as control grew rapidly. In contrast, except tumor NO12, 15, 16, weight and volume of other xenogeneic graft tumors treated with recombinant C3 retrovirus were significantly reduced (Figure 9). Immunohistochemistry indicated that the reduction in the percentage of CDC2 positive cells of the tumors was correlated to the ratio of tumor shrinkage. In contrast, the percentage of TUNEL positive cells was inversely proportional to the ratio of tumor shrinkage (Figure 10). In addition, compared with animals treated with PBS, treatment with recombinant C3 retrovirus resulted in a significant increase (P < 0.05) in animal survival (Figure 11).

Human glioma is the most common and aggressive primary brain cancer with mean patient survival, even with aggressive treatments, including surgery, radiation therapy, and chemotherapy, is typically 12 months or less [8]. Despite progress in research on the molecular aspects of malignant gliomas, the prognosis of these brain tumors continues to be dismal, partly because mechanisms responsible for gliomagenesis and progression remain elusive. In recent years, Ink4a-Arf, KRas, PDGF, PETN, RB, c-Myc and TP53, have been implicated in the pathogenesis and progression of gliomas [15-20], mostly with respect to cell cycle control and signal transduction [21,22]. However, a few studies have reported the molecular mechanism of CDC2/CyclinB1 implicated in gliomagenesis. CDC2 exerts protein kinase activity by constructing a complex with cyclin A, cylin B, and p13suc1 [23,24]. It is known as an active sub-unit of the M-phase promoting factor (MPF) and the M-phase specific histone H1 kinase [25]. Furthermore, CDC2 also plays a role in phosphorylating the retinoblastoma gene product, which regulates the cells cycle by restricting DNA replication [26] at G2/M transition [27]. Appropriate regulation of MPF is essential for the entry into mitosis. Increasing results demonstrate that CDC2/CyclinB1 is involved in checkpoint control, and that its dysregulation could contribute to chromosomal instability in cancer cells through an alteration of spindle checkpoint [28]. p53 gene inhibits cell cycle-dependent expression of CDC2 and Cyclin B1 and consequently inhibits CDC2 kinase [28]. Our data indicated CDC2/CyclinB1 was overexpressed in SHG44 and U251 with p53 mutations. Investigations to date have demonstrated that CDC2/CyclinB1 expression is likely to be correlated with the malignant potential of human tumors [29-31]. Bodey B et al discovered that the expression of CDC2 could become a novel cell proliferation marker in childhood brain tumors [32]. Hence, overexpression of CDC2/CyclinB1 can promote the heterogeneity and malignancy of tumor.

The reason why we chose CDC2/CyclinB1 as a target gene was due to our previous findings that expression level of CDC2 increased with the progression of the malignancy when ganglioglioma transformed into gliobastona multiforme in the same patient [33]. In order to demonstrate the relation in large-scale clinical cases, we constructed human glioma tissue microarrays (TMA). The result of TMA provides the first evidence that expression level of CDC2/CyclinB1 increased with the progression of the malignancy, suggesting that CDC2/CyclinB1 might be of molecular significance in the progression of human gliomas.

We inhibit MPF activation by down-regulation of CDC2 to learn its function in human malignant glioma. Although various inhibitors of CDC2 have been tested as potential candidates for tumor therapy, most of the inhibitors targeting CDC2 lack specificity [34,35]. RNAi is viewed as a powerful tool to define gene function, and a novel therapeutic strategy for treatment of human diseases and conditions including cancer [36]. We demonstrated that inhibition of CDC2 was an effective and specific approach to inhibit the enzymatic activity of MPF, to inhibit proliferation of human malignant glioma cells ex vivo and suppress tumor growth in vivo. Our findings suggest that recombinant retrovirus expressing shRNAs, with its ability to down-regulate CDC2, has potential to serve as a therapeutic agent in the treatment of human malignant gliomas.

Cell cycle analysis indicated that cells transfected with recombinant C1 or C3 were blocked in G2/M phase. This arrest in G2/M phase likely contributes to the observed anti-proliferative and antitumor effects in recombinant C1- or C3-treated tumor cells and xenograft models. In vivo, although the size of most recombinant C3-treated human xenogeneic graft gliomas was reduced markedly, no tumor disappeared as shown ex vivo. Immunohistochemistry also confirmed that inhibition of tumor growth correlated with CDC2 suppression. This indicates that extensive and effective inhibition of CDC2 expression is the key to successful therapy. The approach of directly injecting recombinant retrovirus into the tumor through multi-sites and different time points was unsuccessful because the virus was unable to infect all tumor cells. Improvement of the vector and transport approach is warranted to circumvent the problem, thus gaining success in cancer gene therapy.

It is now widely believed that most tumors including glioblastoma arise from multipotent stem cells, as they have the long lifespan that is required for the accumulation of the many genetic alterations that are found in most cancers [37]. Recent isolation and characterization of brain tumor-initiating cells supports the concept that transformed neural stem cells may seed gliomas [38]. However, the expression of CDC2 was both negative in brain tumor stem cell spheres and neural stem cell spheres. CDC2 was negative in differentiated cells of neural stem cells, versus overexperssion in differentiated cells of brain tumor stem cells (data not show). Thus, overexpression of CDC2 was facilitative but not an initial factor of gliomagenesis. To cure human gliomas, we need to simultaneously target both tumor stem cells and proliferated tumor cells.

Using sensitive immunohistochemical methods and a large, representative material, we found that the positive expression rates of CDC2/CyclinB1 were positively correlated with the pathologic grades of human gliomas. Overexpression of CDC2 could promote oncogenesis and progression of human gliomas whereas the downregulation of CDC2 expression could inhibit the proliferation, induce G2/M arrest, and trigger apoptosis in human gliomas. Therefore, CDC2 could become a potential target on gene therapy of human gliomas.
