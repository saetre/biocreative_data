Effect of the deletion of upstream DNA sequences on expression from the ilvGp2 promoter of the ilvGMEDA operon of Escherichia coli K-12.

Transcription in vitro of the regulatory region of the ilvGMEDA operon yields two attenuated RNAs initiated from the tandem promoters ilvGp1 and ilvGp2. Both S1 nuclease analysis and the fusion of ilvGp1 to galK indicate that transcription is not initiated in vivo from ilvGp1. However deletion of DNA sequences 150 to 100 bp upstream of ilvGp2 drastically reduces expression in vivo from ilvGp2. Both the distance separating ilvGp2 from the upstream DNA sequences and their relative orientation to each other on the DNA helix affect expression from ilvGp2. Deletion of DNA sequences approximately 400 bp upstream of ilvGp2 increases expression in vivo from this promoter. Analysis of products of transcription in vitro indicates that the effects observed in vivo are probably not due to DNA conformation or interactions of RNA polymerase.
