The Escherichia coli K-12 chromosome contains a family of five large, unlinked sequences known as the Rhs elements. They share several complex homologies, the most prominent being a 3.7 kb Rhs core. The elements are divided into two subfamilies, RhsA-B-C and RhsD-E, according to the sequence similarities of the cores. The RhsD core is 3747 bp long compared to 3714 bp for RhsA. Despite a 22% sequence divergence, the RhsD core conserves features previously noted for RhsA. Similar to RhsA, the RhsD core maintains a single ORF, the start codon coinciding with the first nucleotide of the homology. The RhsD core-ORF continues 177 codons beyond the homology, resulting in a carboxy terminal extension unrelated to that of RhsA. The RhsD core retains all 28 copies of the repeated motif GxxxRYxYDxxGRL(I/T) seen in RhsA. The other member of the RhsD-E subfamily, RhsE, has been mapped to minute 32 of the E. coli map. It appears defective in that it contains only the last 1550 bp of the 3.7 kb core. Its sequence is more closely related to that of RhsD than RhsA. In addition, RhsE and RhsB share a 1.3 kb homology, known as the H-repeat. The H-repeats from RhsE and RhsB are more closely related than their cores, showing only 1% nucleotide divergence.
