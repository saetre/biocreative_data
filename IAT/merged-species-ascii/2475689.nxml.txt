The mechanism regulating radiation-induced anti-apoptotic response, a limiting factor in improving cell radiosensitivity, remains elusive. Mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) phosphatase (MKP)-1 is the major member of MKPs that dephosphorylates and inactivates MAPK. Here we provide the evidence that MKP-1 was negatively bridging between NF-kappaB-mediated prosurvival pathway and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK)-mediated proapoptotic response. MKP-1 was induced by gamma-radiation and repressed radiation-induced pro-apoptotic status. NF-kappaB RelA/p50 heterodimer was recruited to MKP-1 gene promoter to induce MKP-1 transcription. Deletion of the NF-kappaB-binding site or inactivation of NF-kappaB by its small interfering RNA significantly decreased the radiation-induced MKP-1 promoter activity. In addition, MKP-1-deficient mouse embryonic fibroblasts exhibited a prolonged activation of JNK but not p38 or extracellular signal-regulated kinase subfamilies of MAPKs. The prolonged activation of JNK was not induced by treatment with tumor necrosis factor alpha or interleukin-6, and inactivation of JNK but not p38 or ERK abolished radiation-induced proapoptotic status, indicating that JNK is specifically inhibited by radiation-induced MKP-1. Three MKP-1 wild type human tumor cell lines treated with MKP-1 small interfering RNA showed an increased proapoptotic response that can be rescued by overexpression of wild type mouse MKP-1. Together, these results suggest that MKP-1 is a NF-kappaB-mediated prosurvival effector in attenuating JNK-mediated pro-apoptotic response; NF-kappaB/MKP-1-mediated negative JNK regulation represents a potential therapeutic target for adjusting cell radiosensitivity.

Radiation continues to be used as the major modality of anti-cancer treatment because of its strong effect in inducing cell death and apoptosis (1, 2). The efficacy of this treatment may be severely compromised because of radiation-induced radioresistance with adaptive anti-apoptotic response (3-5). Radiation can activate various cellular signal pathways, including MAPKs2 (6) and NF-kappaB pathways (7). The interaction between these two pathways have been identified in cells under different stresses, such as treatment of TNFalpha (8, 9). However, the mechanism balancing the MAPK-mediated pro-apoptotic and NF-kappaB-mediated anti-apoptotic pathways in response to radiation remains unclear.

MAPKs are major signaling transduction molecules in apoptosis (10). In mammals, MAPKs consist of three subfamilies: c-Jun NH2-terminal kinases (JNKs) (11), extracellular signal-related kinases (ERKs) (12), and p38 kinases (10). Although gamma-radiation can activate JNKs (6, 13), ERK (12), and p38 kinases (14), it is not clear which subfamily of MAPKs plays a specific role in regulation of the gamma-radiation-induced pro-apoptotic response. It is generally believed that phosphorylation and dephosphorylation cause activation and inactivation of MAPKs, respectively. Activation of MAPKs can be executed by their upstream dual specific MAPK kinases, which phosphorylate both threonine and tyrosine residues of the TXY motif (15). Inactivation of MAPKs is accomplished through dephosphorylation of the two same residues of the TXY motif by MKPs (16).

MKPs belong to a family of dual specificity protein phosphatases with 13 members with a function of dephosphorylation of both phosphothreonine and phosphotyrosine residues (14, 16, 17). MKP-1, as the first defined member of MKPs (18), can be rapidly induced in mammalian cells in response to an array of stress stimuli, including oxidative stress and heat shock (19), UV light (20), and DNA-damaging anti-cancer drugs (21, 22) through transcriptional (23, 24) and post-transcriptional mechanisms (25, 26). MKP-1 induction protects cells from stress-induced apoptosis predominantly through negative regulation of MAPK activities.

The heterodimeric transcription factor NF-kappaB inhibits cellular apoptotic response and promotes survival in response to radiation (27-29). In mammals, there are five Rel/NF-kappaB proteins: RelA (p65), RelB, c-Rel, NF-kappaB1 (p50 and its precursor p105), and NF-kappaB2 (p52 and its precursor p100) (30, 31). In resting cells, NF-kappaB is retained in the cytoplasm in an inactive form by a tight association with its IkappaB. Activation of RelA/p50 requires IKKbeta-dependent degradation of IkappaBs, which liberates the RelA.p50 complex from IkappaBs and subsequently leads its translocation into the nucleus. The IKK complex contains two catalytic subunits, IKKalpha and IKKbeta, and two regulatory subunits, IKKgamma and ELKS. The classical manner for NF-kappaB activation mainly depends on the IKKbeta subunit activation (32, 33). However, it is unknown whether MKP-1 is a target of NF-kappaBto mediate pro-survival signaling upon the genotoxic stress with gamma-radiation.

Although all of MAPKs, MKP-1, and NF-kappaB have been implicated in regulation of apoptotic and anti-apoptotic response in DNA-damaging response, their connections in signaling gamma-radiation-induced apoptosis remain elusive. Here we demonstrate that MKP-1 is the target gene of NF-kappaB upon gamma-radiation. MKP-1 activation through NF-kappaB is specifically required for inhibition of JNK-associated pro-apoptotic response to decrease cell death. Thus, our data reveal a novel anti-apoptosis mechanism by which the NF-kappaB and MKP-1 pathways cross-talk in response to gamma-radiation treatment.

Cell Lines, Cell Culture, and Treatments-MKP-1-/- (MKP-1 knock-out) MEFs and paired MKP-1 wild type (WT) MEFs were kindly provided by Robert Z. Orlowski at University of North Carolina. WT and MKP-1-/- MEFs were maintained in DMEM with 10% FBS. MKP-1-/- MEFs with reconstitution of MKP-1 were established by stable transfection with pcDNA3-MKP-1 together with pCEP-4 vector with hygromycin B resistance gene. The cells were transfected for 48 h and subjected to hygromycin B (50 mug/ml) selection for 7-10 days. The clones surviving from the selection were pooled as stable MKP-1-/-/MKP-1 MEFs that were cultured in the selective drug-free medium for at least three passages before used for further experiments. The human skin keratinocytes (HK18) and HK-18/IkappaB-alphaM stable transfectants were maintained as described previously (34). The human breast cancer MDA-MB-231 cells and lung cancer A549 cells (ATCC, Manassas, VA) were maintained in RPMI 1640 with 10% FBS. The human breast cancer MCF-7 (ATCC) were maintained in DMEM with 5% FBS and insulin (10 mug/ml). All of the radiation treatments were delivered with gamma-radiation-12 irradiator (U.S. Nuclear Co.) equipped with a cobalt-60 (dose rate, 2.3 Gy/min). For treatment with TNFalpha and IL-1, the cells were incubated with or without 20 ng/ml of TNFalpha and IL-1 for different intervals of time. After radiation or treatment with TNFalpha and IL-1, the cells were cultured for different time intervals for further experiments.

Mitochondrial Membrane Potential (DeltaPsim) Assays-Cells (104) were treated with or without radiation 10 Gy of gamma-ray. At 24 h post-radiation, the cells were incubated in culture medium containing 2 mug/ml of JC-1 for 30 min. Cationic dye taken up by mitochondria was detected by formation of red precipitate in cells. In cells with disrupted mitochondria, the dye was excluded and detectable as a green monomer in the cytoplasm. After washing with phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.4), the fluorescence intensity of the red precipitate (JC-1 red) and green monomer (JC-1 green) was detected using a plate reader of Spectra Max M2e (Molecular Devices Co., Sunnyvale, CA) at the wavelength of excitation 485/emission 595 or excitation 485/emission 525, respectively. The ratio of JC-1 red (595)/JC-1 green (525) was calculated as the indicator of DeltaPsim.

Quantitation of Gene Expression-Total RNA was purified and quantified with semi-quantitative reverse transcription-PCR or real time PCR. The reverse transcription-PCR primer sequences for human MKP-1 were 5'-CCATCTGCCTTGCTTACCTT-3' (sense) and 5'-AGCACCTGGGACTCAAACTG-3' (antisense). The internal control human GAPDH primers were 5'-GGACTCATGACCACAGTCCAT-3' (sense) and 5'-GTTCAGCTCAGGGATGACCTT-3' (antisense). Real time PCR was performed in a My IQ thermocycler using SYBR Green supermix reagents following the manufacturer's protocol (Bio-Rad). The cycle conditions were: one cycle of 3 min at 95 degreesC and 45 cycles of 30 s at 95 degreesC, 30 s at the 60 degreesC, and 30 s at 72 degreesC. The data were analyzed with MX 3000P software. Each sample was assigned as an expression value based on its threshold cycle (CT) value, and the data were expressed as arbitrary units by normalization with internal control of GAPDH.

Luciferase Reporter Assays-Cells (1x104) were transfected with 0.1 mug of reporter constructs and 2 ng of pRL-TK (Promega) using Lipofectaminetrade mark LTX and PLUStrade mark reagent (Invitrogen). Transfected cells were treated with different chemicals or gamma-ray as indicated in each figure legend. Both firefly and Renilla luciferase activities were measured using a dual luciferase reporter assay system in a Turner TD20/20 luminometer (Promega). Firefly luciferase activity was normalized by Renilla luciferase activity, which was detected by co-transfection with pRL-TK in all reporter experiments. The luciferase activity was further normalized with the luciferase activity of cells transfected with control vector of pGL3-E. The results of MKP-1 relative luciferase activities were expressed as fold increase over pGL3-E transfected cells.

Radiation-induced Apoptosis Was Repressed by MKP-1-To determine whether MKP-1 plays a role in regulation of gamma-radiation-induced apoptosis, we tested radiosensitivity and apoptotic response induced by radiation with gamma-ray in MKP-1-/-versus WT MEFs. A considerably increased cell death was induced by radiation in MKP-1-/- MEFs compared with WT MEFs (Fig. 1A), suggesting that MKP-1 status plays a role in anti-radiation function. To confirm that MKP-1 negatively mediates the radiation-induced apoptotic response, we measured apoptosis in WT and MKP-1-/- MEFs by sorting SubG1 DNA content with flow cytometry analysis and clonogenic radiosensitivity of WT and MKP-1-/- MEFs. The result showed that radiation significantly increased SubG1 subdiploid apoptotic nuclei (SubG1 fraction) population that contains the apoptotic cell fraction in MKP-1-/- MEFs compared with WT MEFs (Fig. 1B). Consistent with the enhanced cell death, clonogenicity was significant reduced detected in irradiated MKP-1-/- cells, especially by irradiation with 8 Gy of gamma-ray (Fig. 1C). Although MKP-1 is able to suppress apoptosis induced by various stimuli (20), the present data provide the first evidence that cell radiosensitivity is increased because of a lack of MKP-1 activity.

Radiation-induced apoptosis was increased in MKP-1-/- MEFs.A, cell viability was detected by trypan blue exclusion assay in WT and MKP-1-/- MEFs at 24 h post-radiation with 0, 10, or 20 Gy of gamma-ray (at least 1000 cells were counted for each group). B, flow cytometric analysis of radiation-induced apoptosis (SubG1 fraction) in WT and MKP-1-/- MEFs at 24 h post-radiation with 10 Gy of gamma-ray. C, increased clonogenic radiosensitivity in MKP-1-/- MEFs determined in WT and MKP-1-/- MEFs after radiation with different doses. D, enhanced caspases 9/3 activation in MKP-1-/- MEFs. The cleavage of caspases 9 and 3 was detected by immunoblotting analysis in WT and MKP-1-/- MEFs at indicated times after radiation with 10 Gy of gamma-ray. E, enhanced caspase 3/7 activity in irradiated MKP-1-/- MEFs. Caspase 3/7 activity was determined using the Caspase Glo(R) 3/7 assay kit (Promega) at 24 h post-radiation with 10 Gy of gamma-rays (normalized with caspase 3/7 activities of control cells without radiation). F, reconstitution of MKP-1 expression in MKP-1-/- MEFs improved the DeltaPsim in MKP-1-/- MEFs. DeltaPsim was assayed in WT, MKP-1-/-, and MKP-1-/-/MKP-1 MEFs at 24 h post-radiation with 10 Gy of gamma-ray (data were normalized with WT MEFs without radiation; means +/- S.E., n = 3; **, p < 0.01 compared with WT MEFs).

To investigate whether mitochondria-dependent apoptotic pathway is involved in the MKP-1-associated anti-apoptosis, we compared the cleavage of caspase 9, an indicator of mitochondria-dependent apoptosis, with the cleavage of caspase 3, an executor of apoptosis, in MKP-1-/- and WT MEFs. Contrasted with WT cells, the cleavage of both caspase 9 and caspase 3 was significantly increased in MKP-1-/- MEFs at 24 h post-radiation (Fig. 1D). Consistent with the increased cleavage of caspase 3, radiation-induced caspase 3 and 7 activities in MKP-1-/- MEFs (approximately22%) were doubled over their levels in WT MEFs (approximately9%) 24 h after 10 Gy of gamma-ray treatment (Fig. 1E).

The mitochondrial inner membrane potential (DeltaPsim) plays an important role in the apoptotic cascades, and it can be affected by radiation-induced reactive oxygen species (37). Because MKP-1 is also detected in mitochondria (38), we addressed the question of whether MKP-1 modulates the DeltaPsim upon exposure to radiation. Our data showed that although radiation significantly decreased DeltaPsim in both WT and MKP-1-/- MEFs, the reduction of DeltaPsim was more profound in MKP-1-/- MEFs (75%) than WT MEFs (50%). Importantly, when MKP-1 was reconstituted to MKP-1-/- MEFs (MKP-1-/-/MKP-1), the DeltaPsim was restored to a level similar to WT MEFs (Fig. 1F). These results strongly indicate that the loss of MKP-1 function increases the cell radiosensitivity caused by enhanced apoptosis.

MKP-1 Expression Was Induced by Radiation-To test whether MKP-1 is activated by radiation in normal cells, we measured MKP-1 expression levels in WT MEFs irradiated with 10 Gy of gamma-rays. The MKP-1 mRNA levels were increased as early as 1 h after radiation and reached the maximum at 4 h post-radiation (Fig. 2A). Consistent with the radiation-induced MKP-1 mRNA, a substantial amount of MKP-1 protein was also induced by radiation (Fig. 2B). In contrast, no MKP-1 was induced by radiation in MKP-1-/- MEFs, confirming the deficiency of MKP-1 in MKP-1-/- cells (Fig. 2B). These results clearly indicate the inducibility of MKP-1 gene expression under the stress of ionizing radiation. We then studied whether radiation induces MKP-1 expression because of transactivation of MKP-1 gene promoter. We thus constructed and tested mouse MKP-1 promoter luciferase reporter activity. Strikingly, radiation significantly activated the MKP-1 promoter with a similar pattern of time point and level to the induction of MKP-1 mRNA (Fig. 2C).

We further studied whether radiation also up-regulates MKP-1 expression in human cells. Similarly to the data obtained from mouse cells, both MKP-1 mRNA and protein levels were significantly induced by radiation in immortalized normal human keratinocytes (Fig. 2, D and E). In addition, we constructed and tested human MKP-1 promoter activity that was also enhanced with a similar pattern as mouse cells by radiation (Fig. 2F). These results suggest that radiation-induced MKP-1 expression is a common feature in mammalian cells, and MKP-1 may function to increase cell survival by inhibition of apoptosis.

NF-kappaB Was Required for Radiation-induced MKP-1 Gene Expression-Because NF-kappaB is a well documented transcription factor signaling radiation response (28, 39), we studied whether NF-kappaB is responsible for radiation-induced MKP-1 expression. Using TFSEARCH program (version 1.3), we found a NF-kappaB consensus sequence (-1210/-1200) located in the MKP-1 promoter. We next generated a construct with a deletion of the NF-kappaB-binding site (pGL3-E-MKP-1-DeltaNF-kappaB) (Fig. 3A) and tested the MKP-1 promoter activity. Because H2O2 is known to be a MKP-1 inducer by radiation (24), we used it as a positive control. Our results showed that the radiation-induced and H2O2-induced MKP-1 promoter activities were significantly reduced in the absence of the NF-kappaB-binding site (Fig. 3B), indicating that NF-kappaB is required for radiation-induced MKP-1 promoter activity.

To confirm that NF-kappaB is required for radiation-induced MKP-1 gene activation, we tested MKP-1 expression in NF-kappaB inhibited HK-18/IkappaB-alphaM cells, IKK-beta inhibitor (IMD-0354), and siRNA transfection against NF-kappaB subunit p65. Different inhibition levels of MKP-1 were detected with a maximal inhibition by p65 siRNA transfection in both MKP-1 luciferase activity (Fig. 3C) and MKP-1 gene expression (Fig. 3D). These results indicate that NF-kappaB p65 subunit plays a key role in radiation-induced MKP-1 gene expression.

The NF-kappaB-mediated MKP-1 promoter activity was then analyzed by ChIP assay. As shown in Fig. 3E, the MKP-1 promoter region (-1362/-1125) encompassing the NF-kappaB-binding site (-1210/-1200) was clearly immunoprecipitated in radiation-treated HK18 cells with both anti-p65 and p50 antibodies. In contrast, same ChIP setting did not detect the binding by an anti-c-Rel antibody, neither by species-matched and nor by isotype-matched control antibodies. The failure of binding to the MKP-1 promoter region for c-Rel was not due to inefficient ChIP analysis, because all three NF-kappaB subunits antibodies were immunoprecipitated with a IkappaBalpha promoter region, which was included as a positive control. In addition, control fragments of an upstream sequence on the MKP-1 promoter region (-2100/-1800) and the promoter region of GAPDH were not immunoprecipitated. Therefore the highly selective binding of the NF-kappaB p65/p50 heterodimer to the MKP-1 promoter suggests that a classical IKKbeta-dependent NF-kappaB activation regulates radiation-induced MKP-1 activation. These results demonstrate that NF-kappaBis specifically recruited to the MKP-1 promoter to stimulate MKP-1 gene expression and thus confirms a new NF-kappaB target gene in radiation response.

MKP-1 Selectively Inhibited Radiation-induced Activation of JNK-Because MAPKs are involved in signaling apoptosis and can be inhibited by MKP-1 (16), we investigated whether MAPKs are inactivated by MKP-1 upon radiation by measurement of phosphorylation JNK, p38, and ERK in WT and MKP-1-/- MEFs with or without radiation. In Fig. 4A, phosphorylation of all three subfamilies of MAPKs was increased to the similar extent between WT and MKP-1-/- MEFs at 4 h post-radiation, and phosphorylation of p38 and ERK gradually decreased afterward. In contrast, the increased JNK phosphorylation was maintained at elevated levels in MKP-1-/- MEFs at 8 and 12 h post-radiation compared with MKP-1 WT cells at the same time points. Thus, although radiation is able to activate all three MAPKs, the deficiency of MKP-1 appears specifically to contribute to prolonged activation of JNK in MKP-1-/- cells. Therefore, it is possible that radiation-induced MKP-1 inhibits JNK-mediated apoptosis by inactivation of JNK.

It is well documented that ionizing radiation induces cellular redox (oxidation/reduction) alterations (40) that may drastically affect MKP-1 function. MKP-1 belongs to protein-tyrosine phosphatases containing the protein-tyrosine phosphatase signature motif. A key feature of this motif is that the catalytic cysteine is highly sensitive to oxidation because of its low pKa (41). To insights of MKP-1 induction, we asked whether basal levels of MKP-1 without radiation could inactivate JNK by CHX to block de novo synthesis of MKP-1. As shown in Fig. 4B, CHX only marginally activated JNK in WT MEFs at 12 h after CHX treatment, consistent with previously reported results (42). In contrast, CHX treatment induced a substantially high level of JNK activity in MKP-1-/- cells that reached a maximum at 4 h and remained elevated 12 h after CHX treatment. These results indicate that under basal conditions without radiation treatment, the presence of MKP-1 can attenuate CHX-induced JNK activation as observed in WT MEFs. To further determine whether the increased JNK activity at 12 h post-CHX treatment in WT MEFs was due to degradation of MKP-1, we treated WT MEFs with protease inhibitor MG115 followed by CHX to estimate the MKP-1 degradation rate. The half-life of MKP-1 protein in WT MEFs was approximately6 h (Fig. 4C), suggesting that the increased JNK activation after CHX treatment is related to MKP-1 protein degradation.

NF-kappaB was required for radiation-induced MKP-1 expression.A, diagrammatic depictions of human MKP-1 luciferase reporter (left panel) and deletion of the NF-kappaB-binding site (pGL3-E-MKP-1-DeltaNF-kappaB) (right panel). B, HK-18 cells transfected with pGL3-E-MKP-1, pGL3-E-MKP-1-DeltaNF-kappaB, or pGL3-E together with pRL-TK were irradiated with 10 Gy of gamma-ray or treated with H2O2 (400 mum, as a control). Luciferase activity was determined 6 h after treatment. C, inhibition of NF-kappaB blocked radiation-induced MKP-1 transactivation. pGL3-E-MKP-1 luciferase reporter activity was measured in HK-18/IkappaB-alphaM cells and HK-18 cells treated with IKKbeta inhibitor IMD-0354 (2 mum) or p65 siRNA. Luciferase activity was determined at 6 h post-radiation with 10 Gy of gamma-ray. Inset, inhibition of p65 expression by p65 siRNA transfection. D, blocking NF-kappaB activation inhibited radiation-induced MKP-1 gene expression. MKP-1 mRNA in HK-18/IkappaB-alphaM and HK-18 cells treated similarly as in C was assessed by semi-quantitative reverse transcription-PCR. GAPDH served as an internal control. E, ChIP assay for NF-kappaB recruitment to the MKP-1 promoter. Two fragments shown as NF-kappaB-RE (-1362/-1125, encompassing the NF-kappaB-binding site) and US sequence (-2100/-1800, located 0.8 kb upstream of the NF-kappaB-RE region served as a negative control) were used in the ChIP assay. Chromatin was immunoprecipitated with antibodies of p65, p50, or c-Rel (an irrelevant antibody as control). Total chromatin before immunoprecipitation (total input) was included as positive control for PCR. The PCR amplification of the IkappaB-alpha promoter region (-1134/-902) or the GAPDH was also included as positive and negative controls, respectively (means +/- S.E., n = 3; *, p < 0.05; **, p < 0.01).

Based these observations, we tested whether newly synthesized MKP-1 induced by radiation in WT MEFs plays a key role in attenuation of JNK phosphorylation. WT and MKP-1-/- MEFs were irradiated with 10 Gy of gamma-ray in the presence of CHX. Contrasted to the significant difference in radiation-induced JNK activation between MKP-1-/- and WT MEFs observed in Fig. 4A, there was no obvious difference in JNK phosphorylation between WT and MKP-1-/- MEFs (Fig. 4D), suggesting that the de novo synthesized MKP-1 induced by radiation effectively inhibits radiation-induced JNK activity.

Several lines of evidence indicate that caspase-dependent pathways contribute to the prolonged JNK activation induced by treatment with TNFalpha (8, 41, 43). We thus hypothesized that the prolonged JNK activation in MKP-1-/- cells by radiation (Fig. 4A) was dependent on the caspase pathway. The WT and MKP-1-/- MEFs were treated with or without 10 Gy of gamma-ray in the presence of irreversible caspase inhibitor, Ac-Val-Ala-Asp-CMK (Ac-VAD-CMK). Fig. 4E demonstrates that caspase inhibitor did not affect the prolonged activation of JNK in MKP-1-/- MEFs, nor did it in the induction of MKP-1 in WT MEFs. Thus, these data demonstrated that inducible expressed MKP-1 contributed to inactivation of JNK, and the radiation-prolonged activation of JNK in MKP-1-/- MEFs was independent on the caspase pathway.

MKP-1 Was Not Involved in Attenuation of JNK Activation Induced by TNFalpha or IL-1-Because TNFalpha and IL-1 are well established inducers of NF-kappaB, we further studied whether TNFalpha or IL-1 could induce MKP-1 expression and whether MKP-1 is also involved in attenuation of JNK activation induced by TNFalpha or IL-1. Our results showed that MKP-1 protein levels were not changed by treatment with either TNFalpha (Fig. 5A) or IL-1 (Fig. 5B) in WT MEFs. In addition, both TNFalpha- and IL-1-induced JNK activation patterns were identical between WT and MKP-1-/- MEFs (Fig. 5). Therefore, MKP-1-mediated JNK inhibition appears to be dependent on the nature of the stimuli.

JNK-mediated Changes in DeltaPsim Were Regulated by MKP-1-Radiation-induced JNK and p38 activities have been linked with pro-apoptosis, whereas activation of ERK is associated with cell proliferation (6). We thus determined whether MKP-1 specifically targets JNK to inhibit radiation-induced apoptosis. To block kinase activities without affecting expression of individual kinases, we treated WT and MKP-1-/- MEFs with different MAPK inhibitors (ERK inhibitor U0126, p38 inhibitor SB202190, JNK inhibitor SP600125, and Me2SO as solvent control) followed by radiation with 10 Gy of gamma-ray (Fig. 6A). Interestingly, blocking the activity of p38 or ERK did not rescue the radiation-decreased DeltaPsim. In contrast, blocking JNK activity significantly reversed the radiation-induced decrease in DeltaPsim in MKP-1-/- MEFs to a level similar to that in WT MEFs (Fig. 6B), suggesting that MKP-1 specifically regulates JNK-mediated pro-apoptotic response in response to radiation.

To further confirm the involvement of MKP-1 in JNK-mediated pro-apoptotic response, we inhibited the expression of JNK1/2 in WT and MKP-1-/- MEFs by transfection with siRNA against JNK1 and JNK2, and the DeltaPsim was determined after exposure to 10 Gy of gamma-ray. As shown in Fig. 6C, siRNA against JNK1/2 substantially inhibited expression of JNK1/2 in both WT and MKP-1-/- MEFs. JNK1/2 inhibition by siRNA rescued the radiation-induced decrease in DeltaPsim in MKP-1-/- MEFs (Fig. 6D). The results clearly demonstrate that MKP-1 negatively regulates JNK-mediated pro-apoptosis in response to radiation.

Inhibition of MKP-1 Enhanced Proapoptotic Response Induced by Radiation-MKP-1 has been linked with tumor development, progression, and resistance to anticancer drugs (32-34). To determine whether MKP-1 is an effective target to enhance radiation-induced apoptosis, we designed and tested MKP-1 siRNA on enhancement of radiation-induced proapoptotic response in three human cancer cell lines (lung cancer A549 cells, breast cancer MCF-7 cells, and MDA-MB-231 cells, all of which are MKP-1 wild type; data not shown). Radiation significantly increased MKP-1 mRNA and protein levels in all three cancer cell lines (Fig. 7, A and B), and MKP-1 siRNA significantly reduced the radiation-induced MKP-1 expression (Fig. 7C). The caspase 3/7 activity, an index of proapoptotic response, was significantly increased in tumor cells transfected with MKP-1 siRNA, indicating that reduced MKP-1 expression is correlated with radiation-induced apoptosis (Fig. 7D).

MKP-1 homologous genes are significantly conserved in evolution; the degree of sequence similarity between MKP-1 proteins of mouse and human is 98%. The siRNA we designed was against human MKP-1 and cannot interfere with mouse MKP-1 mRNA because of differences in three nucleic acids between human and mouse MKP-1 mRNA. Therefore, to further confirm specificity of the effect of MKP-1 inhibition by siRNA on radiation-induced apoptosis in three human tumor cells, we co-transfected human MKP-1 siRNA with mouse MKP-1 (pcDNA3-MKP-1). As shown in Fig. 7D, overexpressing the nontargeted mouse MKP-1 completely reversed the increased pro-apoptotic effect of human MKP-1 siRNA. These results provide the evidence that direct inhibition of MKP-1 is capable of enhancing radiation-induced proapoptotic status in cancer cells.

DISCUSSION
###end title 56
###begin p 57
This study tested the hypothesis that gamma-radiation-induced MKP-1 lessens cell radiosensitivity by inhibition of pro-apoptotic response. Our results demonstrate that radiation-induced MKP-1 expression is regulated by NF-kappaB causing the attenuation of JNK-mediated pro-apoptotic response. The negative regulation of JNK activity by NF-kappaB-regulated MKP-1 expression represents a potential therapeutic target to adjust cell radiosensitivity.

MKP-1 Bridged Negative Cross-talk between NF-kappaB and JNK Pathways-The fate of an irradiated cell is believed to depend on a balance of anti-apoptotic and pro-apoptotic pathways induced by different genotoxic conditions including ionizing radiation. Both anti-apoptotic NF-kappaB and pro-apoptotic JNK pathways are sensitive to the oxidative stress and are well documented to play essential roles in regulation of radiation-induced anti- and pro-apoptotic responses (29, 30, 44, 45). NF-kappaB is a well defined stress-sensitive heterodimeric transcription factor that is able to inhibit apoptosis and promote cell survival in response to a variety of genotoxic stress including gamma-radiation (28, 46, 47). After long being speculated, the exact cross-talk between radiation-induced prosurvival NF-kappaB pathway and pro-apoptotic JNK pathway remains elusive. The results of the present study provide evidence indicating that MKP-1 is a new effector gene for NF-kappaB-regulated anti-apoptotic response (Figs. 2 and 3). NF-kappaB-mediated MKP-1 activation directly accounts for negative regulation of JNK activation and inhibition of the JNK-mediated pro-apoptotic status.

MKP-1 Selectively Inactivated JNK upon gamma-Radiation- Three genes encode JNKs; the Jnk1 and Jnk2 genes are ubiquitously expressed, whereas Jnk3 is expressed in limited tissues. An interesting finding of the current study is that JNK was specifically targeted by radiation-induced MKP-1. Although MKP-1 is shown to be able to inactivate three MAPKs, its substrate selectivity varies because of the nature of different stimuli (48). We found that radiation with 10 Gy of gamma-ray indeed activated all three members of MAPKs in both WT and MKP-1-/- cells, but only JNK exhibited a prolonged activation in MKP-1-/- cells (Fig. 4A). This prolonged JNK activation was not detected by the treatment of TNFalpha and IL-6 (Fig. 5), suggesting that JNK is the preferred substrate of MKP-1 upon gamma-radiation. Because both TNFalpha and IL-6 are well known inducers for NF-kappaB activation, which is required to up-regulate MKP-1, the exact mechanisms underlying the specifically targeting of MAPKs by MKP-1 between radiation and other stimulations remain to be elucidated.

The capability of basal level MKP-1 to inactivate JNK varies with different types of cellular stimuli. Interestingly, our results suggested that the basal level of MKP-1 did not significantly suppress the radiation-induced JNK activation (Fig. 4D), whereas it almost totally blocked CHX-induced JNK activation (Fig. 4B). These results together with the reported data (49) suggest that inactivation of JNK by basal level MKP-1 depends on the distinct nature of stimulus. The low levels of basal MKP-1 protein could be oxidized by reactive oxygen species generated during gamma-radiation, which, could result in a dysfunction in the basal MKP-1 function for JNK inhibition. In contrast, this dysfunction of MKP-1 was not detected in CHX-treated cells as reported by others (39). In addition, we found that both MKP-1 induction and MKP-1-mediated attenuation of JNK activation were independent from caspase pathway (Fig. 4E). Thus, induction of de novo MKP-1 protein synthesis appears to be a specific event required for inhibiting the JNK-mediated apoptosis by radiation.

MKP-1 Induction Was Correlated Negatively with JNK Inactivation upon gamma-Radiation-Our data showed a direct link between MKP-1 induction and inhibition of JNK-mediated pro-apoptosis (Fig. 6). In agreement with the prolonged JNK activation in MKP-1 null cells, an elevated apoptosis was induced in MKP-1 null but not in WT MEFs, indicating that prolonged activation of JNK is due to the loss of MKP-1. In addition, blockade of JNK activity by its inhibitor or siRNA abrogated the enhanced apoptosis in MKP-1-/- cells, suggesting that the elevated apoptosis induced by gamma-radiation in MKP-1-/- cells is dependent on the JNK activation. Although the JNK inhibitor SP600125 may affect other kinases at high concentrations, it has been broadly used for inactivating JNK (48) as a powerful JNK inhibitor (50). Thus, an acute response of MKP-1 induction is specifically required for inhibiting JNK-mediated pro-apoptosis by radiation.

Inhibition of MKP-1 Sensitized Radiation-induced Proapoptotic Status in Tumor Cells-Previous reports indicate that activation of MKP-1 can cause resistance to chemotherapy (35, 51). MKP-1-/- cells showed higher sensitivity to gamma-radiation-induced cell death and lower level of clonogenic survival (Fig. 1), and inhibition of MKP-1 by siRNA enhanced radiation-induced proapoptotic status with enhanced caspase 3 and 7 activity in MKP-1 wild type human cancer cell lines (Fig. 7). These results further highlight a crucial function of MKP-1 in signaling radiation-induced adaptive resistance. In addition, our study revealed a previously unrecognized function of MKP-1 as a key effector protein of NF-kappaB-mediated pro-survival pathway. Abrogating NF-kappaB activity has been extensively studied for enhancing anti-cancer therapy, and identification of specific NF-kappaB effectors is essential for new drug development. The present study indicates that MKP-1 has a therapeutic potential for sensitization of tumor cells to radiotherapy.

We conclude that gamma-irradiation-induced MKP-1 plays an anti-apoptosis function via the inhibition of JNK-mediated proapoptosis. NF-kappaB controls the de novo synthesized MKP-1 expression that is specifically required for inactivation of JNK, thereby attenuating radiation-induced proapoptotic response and increasing cell survival. siRNA-mediated inhibition of MKP-1 in tumor cells significantly enhanced proapoptotic response. These findings provide the mechanistic insight of a cross-talk between anti-apoptotic NF-kappaB pathway and pro-apoptotic JNK pathway in irradiated cells.
