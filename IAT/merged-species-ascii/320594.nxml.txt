The nucleotide sequence of RNA segment 2 of human influenza strain A/PR/8/34 has been determined. Segment 2 in 2341 nucleotides long and encodes a protein of 757 amino acids (86,500 daltons molecular weight) which is involved in RNA synthesis. Although segment 2 is identical in size to segment 1, which encodes a protein of related function, neither the nucleotide sequences of these two RNA segments nor the amino acid sequences of the encoded proteins appear to be homologous. The sequence of segment 2 completes the sequence of the virus (total 13,588 nucleotides).
