Selected groups of isolated 14C-labelled proteins from E. coli 30S ribosomal subunits were reconstituted with 32P-labelled 16S RNA, and the reconstituted complexes were partially digested with ribonuclease A. RNA fragments protected by the proteins were separated by gel electrophoresis and subjected to sequence analysis. Complexes containing proteins S7 and S19 protected an RNA region comprising helices 29 to 32, part of helix 41, and helices 42 and 43 of the 16S RNA secondary structure. Addition of protein S9 had no effect. When compared with previous data for proteins S7, S9, S14 and S19, these results suggest that S14 interacts with helix 33, and that S9 and S14 together interact with the loop-end of helix 41. Complexes containing proteins S8, S15 and S17 protected helices 7 to 10 as well as the "S8-S15 binding site" (helices 20, 22 and parts of helices 21 and 23). When protein S15 was omitted, S8 and S18 showed protection of part of helix 44 in addition to the latter regions. The results are discussed in terms of our model for the detailed arrangement of proteins and RNA in the 30S subunit.
