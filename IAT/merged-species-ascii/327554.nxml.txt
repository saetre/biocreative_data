In order to map the high affinity binding site for the viral large-T protein on polyoma virus DNA, we have developed an assay which does not require purified protein. It is based on the specific elution of the large-T ATPase activity from calf thymus DNA cellulose by recombinant DNA molecules including known sequences of the viral DNA. Using this assay, a high affinity binding site has been mapped on the early region side of the ori region. Binding requires the integrity of a sequence /AGAGGC/TTCC/AGAGGC/ (nucleotides 49 to 64 in the DNA sequence of the A2 strain). Similar repeats of a PuGPuGGC sequence within less than 20 bases are not found within the viral coding regions, but are strikingly common in the control regions of papovaviruses and other eukaryotic DNAs.
