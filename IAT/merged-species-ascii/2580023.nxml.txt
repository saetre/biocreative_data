Transforming growth factor-beta1 (TGF-beta1) is a potent inhibitor of cellular growth and proliferation by G1 phase arrest or apoptosis. We investigated the association of TGF-beta1 with the anti-proliferative effect of upstream stimulatory factor (USF) in Fischer rat thyroid cell line (FRTL-5) cells. [Methyl-3H] thymidine uptake was measured after treatment of FRTL-5 cells with TGF-beta1 to identify its anti-proliferative effect. USF-1 and USF-2 proteins were in vitro translated, and an electrophoretic mobility shift assay was performed to identify the interaction between USF and the TGF-beta1 promoter. FRTL-5 cells were transfected with USF cDNA, and then the expression of TGF-beta1 was examined with Northern and Western blotting. The cell cycle-regulating proteins associated with TGF-beta1 were also measured. TGF-beta1 significantly inhibited [methyl-3H] thymidine uptake in FRTL-5 cells. Two specific binding sites for USF were found in the TGF-beta1 promoter: -1,846~-1,841 (CACATG) and -621~-616 (CATGTG). Overexpression of USF increased both the mRNA levels and protein levels of TGF-beta1. However, the expression of cyclin D1, CDK4, cyclin E, and CDK2, and the phosphorylation of retinoblastoma protein remained unchanged. Overexpression of USF in FRTL-5 cells increased the expression of TGF-beta10 through specific binding to TGF-beta1 promoter. However, the USF-induced expression of TGF-beta1 did not cause G1 arrest.

Upstream stimulatory factor (USF) is a ubiquitous transcription factor in mammalian cells. It was originally identified as a cellular transcription factor, which is important for expression of the adenovirus major late promoter (1, 2). Two different genes, defined as USF-1 and USF-2, have been isolated from HeLa cells, and these genes encode 43 and 44 kDa polypeptides, respectively (3-6). These two peptides have identical DNA-binding specificities and transcriptional activities (3-6). USF-1 and USF-2 polypeptides are highly divergent in their N-terminal sequences, but they share a highly conserved C-terminal basic/helix-loop-helix/leucine zipper (B-HLH-LZ) sequence that is important for the dimerization and DNA-binding of USF (6). Proteins of the B-HLH-LZ gene family bind to the DNA sequences of the general type CANNTG, which is referred to as the E-box (7, 8). USF has been reported to inhibit cellular growth and proliferation in some cell types (9, 10). We have recently observed that USF also inhibits the cellular proliferation of rat thyroid cells, Fischer rat thyroid cell line (FRTL-5) cells, and papillary thyroid carcinoma cells (11).

Transforming growth factor-beta1 (TGF-beta1) is a potent, naturally occurring inhibitor of cellular growth and proliferation (12, 13). The role of TGF-beta in tumorigenesis can be suppressive or promoting depending on the developmental stage of a tumor and its cellular context (14). During an early phase of tumorigenesis, TGF-beta inhibits tumor development and growth by inducing the arrest of the cell cycle and possibly apoptosis (14). TGF-beta1 is known to bind to FRTL-5 cells and inhibit their cellular growth and proliferation (15-18).

Because both TGF-beta1 and USF suppress FRTL-5 cell proliferation, and because USF increases the activity of TGF-beta1 in some cell types (19), we investigated the effect of USF on the expression and function of TGF-beta1 in order to clarify the mechanism of the anti-proliferative effect of USF in FRTL-5 cells. First of all, we assessed whether USF binds to the TGF-beta1 promoter. Second, we investigated the effect of USF on the expression of TGF-beta1 and the related cell cycle regulatory proteins in FRTL-5 cells.

Total RNA was extracted from the FRTL-5 cells using an RNA extraction kit (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, U.S.A.), and the amount of total RNA was measured using a spectrophotometer (Pharmacia, Buckinghamshire, England). Two micrograms of extracted RNA mixed with 0.1% diethyl pyrocarbonate (DEPC)-treated distilled water were incubated for 5 min at 70℃. The cDNA was synthesized by incubation for 60 min at 42℃ using a commercial kit (AccuPower RT PreMix, BiONEER, Daejeon, Korea). Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was performed in a 20 microL reaction mixture containing 5 microL of denatured cDNA, 250 microM of dNTP mix, 2.5 U of Taq DNA polymerase (BiONEER), 20 mM of Tris-HCl (pH 8.8), 10 mM of KCl, 2 mM of MgSO4, and 0.5 microM of each primer (the primer sequences are listed in Table 1). PCR was carried out in a thermal cycler Gene-Amp 9600 PCR apparatus (Perkin-Elmer Corp., Norwalk, CT, U.S.A.) according to the following protocol: initial denaturation at 95℃ for 5 min, followed by 30 cycles of denaturation at 94 to 95℃ for 30 sec to 1 min, annealing at 52 to 60℃ for 30 sec to 1 min, and extension at 72℃ for 1 to 2 min, and completed by a final extension step at 72℃ for 10 min. Ten microliters of PCR product were analyzed by electrophoresis in 1.5% agarose gel. The PCR products were purified using a purification kit (PCRquick-spin PCR Product Purification Kit, iNtRON Biotechnology, Seongnam, Korea), and were then cloned into the pcDNA3.1 vectors using a pcDNA3.1/V5-His TOPO TA expression kit (Invitrogen). The cDNA was extracted from a cloned vector using a QIAprep Spin Miniprep kit (QIAGEN Inc, Valencia, CA, U.S.A.).

The EMSA reaction mixtures included 10 microg of synthetic protein and reaction buffer (10 mM HEPES; pH 7.9, 60 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 2 mM dithiothreitol, 1 microg poly (dIdC) and 7% glycerol). After incubation for 10 min at room temperature, 300,000 cpm of radiolabeled probe was added, and the reaction was allowed to proceed for an additional 45 min. The reaction mixture was electrophoresed on a 6% polyacrylamide gel at 300 V for 2 hr using tris-borate-EDTA buffer. The gel was dried and exposed to radiography film overnight at -70℃. Specificity of binding was ascertained by competition with a 160-fold molar excess of unlabeled oligonucleotides and by conducting supershift experiments. For the supershift assay, 2 microL (0.2 microg/microL) of anti-USF-1 or anti-USF-2 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA, U.S.A.) was preincubated for 2 hr on ice before the addition of the probes.

USF-1 and USF-2 proteins were in vitro translated and then confirmed by Western blotting (right upper box of Fig. 2). To identify binding of USF-1 and USF-2 proteins to the TGF-beta1 promoter, we observed the DNA-protein complex between four different E-box sequences of the rat TGF-beta1 promoter (T1, T2, T3, and T4 in Table 2) and the USF proteins by performing EMSA (as indicated by the black arrows in Fig. 2). Among them, the affinities for binding to T2 and T3 were much stronger. Cold competitors eliminated the DNA-protein complexes, and a specific anti-USF-1 or anti-USF-2 antibody shifted these complexes to an upper position to make 'super-shifts' (as indicated by the white arrows in Fig. 2). Two loci of E2 (5'-CACATG) and E3 (5'-CATGTG) were detected in the rat TGF-beta1 promoter, respectively: -1,846~-1,841 (E2), -3,514~-3,509 (E2'), and -621~ -616 (E3), -1,563~-1,558 (E3'). The specific sites for USF binding were evaluated by performing EMSA with four probes (T2, T2', T3, and T3') that contained each E-box, and were identified as -1,846~-1,841 (E2) and -621~-616 (E3) (Fig. 3).

The expression of G1 phase-related proteins, including cyclin D1, CDK4, cyclin E, and CDK2, remained unchanged by USF overexpression, although the levels of p27, a cell cycle inhibitor, were increased. In addition, the overexpression of USF-1 and USF-2 did not alter the levels of phosphorylation of Rb protein in FRTL-5 cells (Fig. 5).

USF has been reported to inhibit cellular growth and proliferation in some cell types (9, 10). We have recently observed that both USF-1 and USF-2 play a role in suppressing the cellular proliferation of normal thyrocytes and thyroid papillary carcinoma cells, while they maintained the TSH-stimulated production of cAMP (11). However, the exact mechanism of the anti-proliferative effect of USF overexpression was not identified. TGF-beta1 is a potent, naturally occurring inhibitor of cell growth (13), it has a high affinity for FRTL-5 cells, and it inhibits their cellular growth (15-18); therefore, this study examined the role of TGF-beta1 in FRTL-5 cells overexpressing USF.

Inhibition of cellular growth by TGF-beta1 has been observed in normal feline thyroid cells, human thyroid cells, and the human papillary thyroid carcinoma cell line (17, 20). First of all, we confirmed that TGF-beta1 significantly decreased the uptake of [methyl-3H]-thymidine in FRTL-5 cells. Therefore, we conducted a study on the relationship between USF and TGF-beta1. There have been a few reports on this relationship thus far: USF-1 and USF-2 are known to bind to the TGF-beta1 promoter and increase its activity in mesangial cells, glioblastoma, embryonal carcinoma, breast carcinoma, and choriocarcinoma cells (19, 21, 22). However, the effect of USF on the expression of TGF-beta1 in thyrocytes has not yet been reported. USF binds to DNA as a homodimer or heterodimer at a specific site that is characterized by an E-box (5'-CANNTG) (3, 5, 9). In this study, we demonstrated that USF-1 and USF-2 proteins strongly bound to the specific sequences (CACATG in -1,846 to -1,841 and CATGTG in -621 to -616) of the TGF-beta1 promoter, and the overexpression of USF increased the mRNA and protein levels of TGF-beta1 in FRTL-5 cells. Other E-boxes such as E1 and E4 in Fig. 2 were very week in their affinity to USF, which suggests that there are other factors than nucleotide sequences determining the binding of USF at E-box. It is apparent in the Fig. 3 because even E-boxes having the same sequences in the TGF-beta1 promoter showed different affinity to USF. Taking into consideration the anti-proliferative effect of TGF-beta1, these findings suggested that USF might inhibit cell proliferation through the induction of TGF-beta1 after binding to its promoter.

As commented on earlier, TGF-beta regulates cellular growth and proliferation in a cell-specific manner. In most epithelial cells, TGF-beta is a potent inhibitor of cellular growth and proliferation; it arrests the cell cycle in the G1 phase by modulating the cell cycle regulators, especially the CDK inhibitors, CDK4, CDK2, cyclin D, and cyclin E, and by eventually dephosphorylating Rb protein (23). TGF-beta induces the expression of CDK inhibitors such as p15, p21, and p27 (24). They, in turn, downregulate CDK4 and G1/S phosphatase CDC25A (25, 26), and they decrease the expression of c-Myc, which again down-regulates p15 (27). Inactivation of the CDK-cyclin complexes contributes to dephosphorylation of Rb protein (28). Rb protein is a primary target of the action of TGF-beta1, and as Rb dephosphorylation induces G1 phase arrest (29), the main anti-proliferative mechanism of TGF-beta1 on the thyroid cells has been reported as G1 phase arrest (16, 18). However, we were not able to observe G1 arrest in the USF-overexpressing FRTL-5 cells, although the expression of TGF-beta1 was increased. We did not evaluate the mechanism for it, but overexpression of USF might influence the activity of G1 phase-related cyclin modulators and the phosphorylation status of Rb protein. Instead, we observed G2/M phase arrest (11). The G2/M phase arrest was accompanied by the modification of the expression of the G2/M-related regulators such as cyclin B1 and CDK1 (11). The effect of TGF-beta1 on the progression of the G2/M phase is not yet clear. We observed the increase of p27 which could contribute to the G2/M phase arrest. Hashimoto et al. recently reported that TGF-beta1 induced the cell cycle arrest not at G1 phase but at G2 phase in some hepatoma cells, which was thought to be through the stabilization of Wee1 (30). Although we did not examine the activity of Wee1, the overexpression of USF might affect Wee1 activity and induce G2/M arrest. However, we cannot exclude the possibility that the role of TGF-beta1 in the USF-regulated anti-proliferative effects on FRTL-5 cells is very limited, regardless of the binding activities of USFs to TGF-beta1 promoter.

In conclusion, we demonstrated that TGF-beta1 decreased the proliferation of FRTL-5 cells. We also observed that overexpression of USF-1 and USF-2 increased the expression of TGF-beta1 in FRTL-5 cells after specifically binding to the TGF-beta1 promoter. However, dephosphorylation of Rb was not induced, and this was concordant with the finding that cell cycle arrest was observed at the G2/M phase, and was not seen at the G1 phase (11). The mechanism related to the reason that USF-induced TGF-beta1 expression did not cause dephoshorylation of Rb protein will be evaluated and reported on in the future.

Electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) of the complexes between the USF protein and the E-box sequences in the TGF-beta1 promoter. The in vitro translated USF-1 and USF-2 were confirmed by Western blotting, and this is illustrated in a box located in the right upper side of the figure. Four types of E-boxes (E1-E4) existed in the TGF-beta1 promoter, and each was tested to determine whether they would bind to USF-1 and USF-2 by using EMSA (black arrows). Among them, the affinities to E2 and E3 were much stronger than the affinities shown to E1 and E4. Cold competitors eliminated the DNA-protein complexes, and a specific anti-USF-1 or anti-USF-2 antibody shifted these complexes to an upper position to cause 'super-shifts' (white arrows).
