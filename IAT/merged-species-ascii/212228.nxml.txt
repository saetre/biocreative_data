Background

###begin p 2
The hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) transcription complex, which is activated by low oxygen tension, controls a diverse range of cellular processes including angiogenesis and erythropoiesis. Under normoxic conditions, the alpha subunit of HIF is rapidly degraded in a manner dependent on hydroxylation of two conserved proline residues at positions 402 and 564 in HIF-1alpha in the oxygen-dependent degradation (ODD) domain. This allows subsequent recognition by the von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) tumor suppressor protein, which targets HIF for degradation by the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. Under hypoxic conditions, prolyl hydroxylation of HIF is inhibited, allowing it to escape VHL-mediated degradation. The transcriptional regulation of the erythropoietin gene by HIF raises the possibility that HIF may play a role in disorders of erythropoiesis, such as idiopathic erythrocytosis (IE).

Patients with IE were screened for changes in the HIF-1alpha coding sequence, and a change in the ODD domain that converts Pro-582 to Ser was identified in several patients. This same change, however, was also detected at a significant frequency, 0.073, in unaffected controls compared to 0.109 in the IE patient group. In vitro hydroxylation assays examining this amino acid change failed to reveal a discernible effect on HIF hydroxylation at Pro-564.

The Pro582Ser change represents a common polymorphism of HIF-1alpha that does not impair HIF-1alpha prolyl hydroxylation. Although the Pro582Ser polymorphism is located in the ODD domain of HIF-1alpha it does not diminish the association of HIF-1alpha with VHL. Thus, it is unlikely that this polymorphism accounts for the erythrocytosis in the group of IE patients studied.

Hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) is the master regulator of a wide range of cellular functions including glycolysis, erythropoiesis and angiogenesis [1,2]. HIF is a dimeric transcription complex composed of an alpha subunit (either HIF-1alpha, HIF-2alpha, or HIF-3alpha) and a beta subunit (also known as ARNT), and it binds to target genes containing hypoxia response elements (HRE) in mammalian cells [3,4]. There is an expanding list of HIF target genes that are involved in a diverse range of cellular processes that include angiogenesis, cell survival and proliferation, energy and glucose metabolism, apoptosis, and erythropoiesis [3].

Both subunits of HIF are constitutively expressed, but under normoxic conditions, the alpha subunit of the complex is also constitutively hydroxylated on two conserved proline residues (Pro-402 and Pro-564 in the case of human HIF-1alpha) [5-8]. This prolyl hydroxylation, catalyzed by a family of intracellular prolyl hydroxylases designated PHD/HPH [9,10], allows recognition of the alpha subunits by the von Hippel-Lindau tumor suppressor protein (VHL) [11], a component of an E3 ubiquitin ligase complex that targets these subunits for degradation by the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway [4,12]. This complex also includes Elongin C, Elongin B, Cullin2, and Rbx1 [13]. Thus, under normoxic conditions, HIF-1alpha (and the other alpha subunits) is essentially undetectable. Under hypoxic conditions, HIF-1alpha prolyl hydroxylation, which is dependent on molecular oxygen, is inhibited, thereby allowing HIF-1alpha to escape VHL-mediated degradation. This therefore provides a framework for understanding how oxygen tension can be directly coupled to HIF activation.

Knowledge of the regulation of HIF has important implications for understanding, and potentially treating, ischemic cardiac and cerebrovascular disease. Moreover, HIF plays a critical role in cancer [14-16], as HIF-induced angiogensis is instrumental in promoting cell growth in solid tumors and metastasis [17]. Elevated HIF expression occurs under pathophysiologic conditions such as in the hypoxic cores of enlarging solid tumors. HIF levels can also be augmented by cancer-inducing mutations in oncogenes such as p53, Src, and most notably, VHL [12]. VHL mutations occur in the context of the von Hippel-Lindau syndrome, a tumor predisposition syndrome in which a germline mutation is followed by somatic mutation of the remaining allele, thereby allowing the development of the classic triad of renal cell carcinoma, pheochomocytoma, and hemangioblastoma, in conformance with Knudsen's two hit hypothesis. Importantly, bi-allelic VHL mutations also occur in the majority of sporadic clear cell carcinomas of the kidney. Most, but not all, of these mutations impair or abolish the capacity of VHL to serve as an E3 ubiquitin ligase for HIF [18,19], consistent with the central importance of this pathway in the pathogenesis of these tumors.

The critical importance of HIF in the transcriptional regulation of the erythropoietin (Epo) also raises the possibility of involvement of the HIF-VHL pathway in disorders of erythropoiesis, such as primary erythrocytosis. This disorder is characterized by over production of red cells and inappropriately normal or elevated Epo levels. Indeed, in patients with autosomal recessive Chuvash polycythemia [20-22], an Arg200Trp mutation of VHL impairs its ability to polyubiquitinate HIF [23], thereby providing an explanation for elevated Epo levels. In the present studies, we screened the HIF-1alpha gene for base changes in patients with idiopathic erythrocytosis. Sequencing the VHL binding region of HIF-1alpha detected one patient who was homozygous for a Pro582Ser polymorphism and an additional eight patients heterozygous for the same polymorphism. However, screening of a group of normal controls detected the same Pro582Ser polymorphism, and functional studies failed to reveal a defect in HIF-1alpha hydroxylation. Collectively, these studies identify Pro582Ser as a common polymorphism of HIF-1alpha that does not appear to affect either HIF-1alpha hydroxylation or subsequent recognition by VHL.

We sequenced exon 12 of HIF-1alpha from a group of 55 patients, all of whom had raised or inappropriately normal Epo levels. Sequencing of the Epo receptor (EpoR) gene from these patients as previously described [24] failed to reveal any mutations. With the exception noted below, none of the patients displayed mutations in VHL [22]. From this group, we detected a heterozygous C to T transition at nucleotide 1744 of HIF-1alpha in 8 individuals (compare Figure 1A with 1B). An additional individual was homozygous for the same base change (Figure 1C), and both his parents were heterozygous. This individual was heterozygous for the Arg200Trp VHL mutation (C598T) seen in Chuvash polycythemia, and clinical features of this patient, D1, have been described in a previous report [22]. The C1744T polymorphism in the HIF-1alpha gene abolishes the restriction site for Tsp 45I enzyme (Figure 1D), and a group of 48 caucasian normal anonymised controls showing an equal male/female distribution were screened employing this diagnostic site. Seven were also found to have lost this site (in 6 of these, the C1744T polymorphism was directly confirmed by sequencing), thus giving a predicted frequency for this polymorphism of 0.073 in the normal group compared to 0.109 for the erythrocytosis patients. Sequencing of exons 9 and 15 of HIF-1alpha, which includes Pro402 and Asn803, failed to detect any further base changes in this group of patients. It might be noted that of nine patients that we previously reported as having Chuvash polycythemia [22], three of these were found to be heterozygous for the C1744T polymorphism in HIF-1alpha.

Detection of C1744T polymorphism. Sequencing of exon 12 of the HIF-1alpha detected a heterozygous base change of C to T at nucleotide 1744 in 8 patients (Figure 1B) when compared to the normal sequence (Figure 1A). One patient, D1, was homozygous for this base change (Figure 1C). The position of the mutation is indicated by an arrow. Bases are as follows: G = black; A = green; T = red; C = blue. The C1744T mutation destroys the restriction site for Tsp 45I enzyme and the normal exon 12 PCR product is restricted in the presence of this enzyme into 4 fragments of 213, 156, 139 and 92 bp; in the presence of the C1744T mutation the 156 and 139 bp fragments are replaced with one of 295 bp. (Figure 1D). M1: 100 bp DNA ladder; M2: 25 bp ladder; 1: C1744 control individual; 2: heterozygous individual for C1744T polymorphism; 3: individual D1 homozygous for C1744T polymorphism.

The C1744T polymorphism predicts an amino acid change of proline to serine at codon 582 (Pro582Ser). This residue is of potential interest because it is embedded in a Phe-Asp-Gln-Leu-Ser-Pro motif (where Pro is Pro-582), which bears homology to the Leu-Xaa-Xaa-Leu-Ala-Pro motif (where Xaa is any amino acid and Pro is the hydroxylacceptor proline) present at the previously identified sites of hydroxylation at Pro-402 and Pro-564. Of relevance here is the fact that mutations can be tolerated at all positions of this motif with the exception of the hydroxylacceptor proline [25]; hence, it is conceivable that the proline (582) itself may be a hydroxylation site. It may also be noted that this proline is conserved in all mammalian HIF-1alpha proteins for which sequence information is available, but is not present in either HIF-2alpha or HIF-3alpha, or in HIF-1alpha from Xenopus laevis [26].

To test the possibility that Pro-582 itself might be a site of hydroxylation by PHD, we first prepared proteins corresponding to HIF-1alpha (531-575) or HIF-1alpha (569-589) fused to GST, and then immobilized these on GSH-agarose. The bound protein was then treated with PHD2, washed, and incubated with 35S-labelled VHL to assess the extent of prolyl hydroxylation. As shown in Fig. 2A, under conditions where PHD2 hydroxylates the HIF-1alpha (531-575) peptide (lane 3), which contains the primary site of hydroxylation (Pro-564), we found no evidence that it hydroxylates the HIF-1alpha (569-589) peptide (lane 4), at least in a manner which permits subsequent recognition by VHL.

While Pro-582 may not itself be a site of prolyl hydroxylation, it is in the vicinity of Pro-564, which is the primary site of prolyl hydroxylation in HIF-1alpha. Hence, the Pro582Ser substitution might affect HIF-1alpha hydroxylation at Pro-564. To examine this, we incubated 35S-labelled wild type or Pro582Ser GAL4-HIF-1alpha (531-652) with PHD2. Hydroxylated substrate was then isolated by incubation with VHL-elonginB-elongin C (VBC) followed by immunoprecipitation of the latter [10,25]. As shown in Fig. 2B, both wild type and Pro582Ser GAL4-HIF-1alpha (531-652) are hydroxylated in a similar time-dependent fashion by PHD2 (compare lanes 2-5 with lanes 7-10). Thus, the Pro582Ser polymorphism does not adversely affect the in vitro hydroxylation at Pro-564 by PHD. This conclusion is consistent with binding studies that have shown that the tight interaction of HIF-1alpha ODD peptides containing Hyp-564 to VHL does not require this residue [26,27]. It is also consistent with the structure of HIF-1alpha (549-582) Pro564Hyp cocrystallized with VHL, in which Pro-582, unlike Hyp-564, was not visualized [26].

Finally, it is possible that the Pro582Ser polymorphism in HIF-1alpha might only manifest a functional change in the context of other mutations, such as the Arg200Trp mutation in the VHL protein. To test this, we hydroxylated WT or Pro582Ser GST-HIF-1alpha (531-652) with PHD2 and tested the hydroxylated protein for interaction with VHL Arg200Trp. As shown in Fig. 2C, this mutant VHL binds to hydroxylated forms of both WT and Pro582Ser GST-HIF-1alpha (531-652) (lanes 3 and 4, respectively). Collectively, these results provide evidence that the Pro582Ser polymorphism does not interfere with recognition by Hyp-564 HIF-1alpha by either WT (Fig. 2B) or Arg200Trp (Fig. 2C) VHL. The latter observation indicates that this polymorphism is unlikely to account for the erythrocytosis seen in the patient mentioned above who was heterozygous for the Arg200Trp mutation in VHL.

It has been recently reported that human hormone-refractory prostate cancers possess mutations in the ODD of HIF-1alpha [28]. One mutation that was identified turned out, in fact, to be the Pro582Ser mutation examined here. A second mutation was an Glu591Gly mutation. Neighboring normal tissue possessed wild type HIF-1alpha sequence [28]. A previous report also documented the occurrence of the Pro582Ser polymorphism in both renal cell carcinomas and normal tissue [29]. While we cannot rule out the formal possibility that the Pro582Ser polymorphism observed in the current studies or the previous report might affect HIF-1alpha transcriptional activity, or HIF-1alpha stability in the context of the full length protein, the results presented here indicate that it does not affect either hydroxylation at Pro-564 or its subsequent recognition by VHL.

The C1744T transition is present in patients with IE but is also a common polymorphism which is predicted to result in Pro582Ser change in the HIF-1alpha amino acid sequence. While this residue resides in the ODD domain of HIF-1alpha, in vitro studies fail to reveal any impairment in hydroxylation or subsequent recognition by VHL. Hence, we conclude that the erythrocytosis observed in the patients of the present study is likely due to other mechanisms.
