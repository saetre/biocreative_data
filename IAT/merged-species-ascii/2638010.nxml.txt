Although transition from proliferation to hypertrophic differentiation of chondrocytes is a crucial step for endochondral ossification in physiological skeletal growth and pathological disorders like osteoarthritis, the underlying mechanism remains an enigma. This study investigated the role of the transcription factor CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein beta (C/EBPbeta) in chondrocytes during endochondral ossification.

Mouse embryos with homozygous deficiency in C/EBPbeta (C/EBPbeta-/-) exhibited dwarfism with elongated proliferative zone and delayed chondrocyte hypertrophy in the growth plate cartilage. In the cultures of primary C/EBPbeta-/- chondrocytes, cell proliferation was enhanced while hypertrophic differentiation was suppressed. Contrarily, retroviral overexpression of C/EBPbeta in chondrocytes suppressed the proliferation and enhanced the hypertrophy, suggesting the cell cycle arrest by C/EBPbeta. In fact, a DNA cell cycle histogram revealed that the C/EBPbeta overexpression caused accumulation of cells in the G0/G1 fraction. Among cell cycle factors, microarray and real-time RT-PCR analyses have identified the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p57Kip2 as the transcriptional target of C/EBPbeta. p57Kip2 was co-localized with C/EBPbeta in late proliferative and pre-hypertrophic chondrocytes of the mouse growth plate, which was decreased by the C/EBPbeta deficiency. Luciferase-reporter and electrophoretic mobility shift assays identified the core responsive element of C/EBPbeta in the p57Kip2 promoter between -150 and -130 bp region containing a putative C/EBP motif. The knockdown of p57Kip2 by the siRNA inhibited the C/EBPbeta-induced chondrocyte hypertrophy. Finally, when we created the experimental osteoarthritis model by inducing instability in the knee joints of adult mice of wild-type and C/EBPbeta+/- littermates, the C/EBPbeta insufficiency caused resistance to joint cartilage destruction.

C/EBPbeta transactivates p57Kip2 to promote transition from proliferation to hypertrophic differentiation of chondrocytes during endochondral ossification, suggesting that the C/EBPbeta-p57Kip2 signal would be a therapeutic target of skeletal disorders like growth retardation and osteoarthritis.

Most skeletal growth is achieved by endochondral ossification. During the process, chondrocytes undergo proliferation, hypertrophic differentiation, and apoptosis [1], each of which is regulated by distinct signals. Among them, chondrocyte hypertrophy is a rate-limiting step for the skeletal growth, being responsible for 40-60% of the endochondral ossification [2], [3]. The initiation is precisely linked with the cessation of proliferation; however, the molecular mechanism underlying the harmonious transition from the proliferation to hypertrophic differentiation of chondrocytes remains an enigma.

CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein beta (C/EBPbeta), also known as nuclear factor-interleukin-6 (NF-IL6), is a member of the C/EBP family of six transcription factors characterized by a carboxyl-terminal leucine zipper dimerization domain and an adjacent highly conserved basic DNA binding domain [4]-[6]. Contrary to C/EBPalpha that is purely antiproliferative as a tumor suppressor in several cell types, C/EBPbeta regulates expression of various genes involved in cell differentiation, proliferation, survival, immune function and female reproduction, as well as tumor invasiveness and progression, through a variety of mechanisms [6].Over the past several years, C/EBPbeta has been shown to control differentiation of hematopoietic and adipogenic cells [7], [8]. The present study initially investigated skeletal phenotype of C/EBPbeta-deficient (C/EBPbeta-/-) mice which have been reported to display mainly hematopoietic and adipogenic defects [9]-[11]. The mice showed dwarfism with an elongated proliferative zone and delayed chondrocyte hypertrophy in the limb cartilage, implicating the cell cycle control by C/EBPbeta in chondrocytes.

Cell cycle factors appear to play an important role in the control of chondrocyte proliferation and differentiation [12], [13]. During the cell cycle activation, complexes of cyclin and cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) promote G1/S-phase transition from G0/G1 by phosphorylating Rb-related pocket proteins, which activate genes required for the S-phase entry. The cyclin-CDK complexes are inhibited by two major families of CDK inhibitors [14]. The p16 INK4 family specifically binds and inactivates monomeric CDK4 or CDK6, whereas the Cip/Kip family, which includes p21Cip1, p27Kip1, and p57Kip2 (p57), inhibits all G1/S-phase cyclin-CDK complexes. Since the control of these cell cycle factors driving S-phase onset greatly influences the commitment to cell differentiation, the present study performed a screen of potential transcriptional targets of C/EBPbeta using a microarray analysis, and identified p57 as the most probable target during hypertrophic differentiation of chondrocytes. We further investigated the molecular mechanism underlying the regulation of skeletal growth and endochondral ossification through the C/EBPbeta-p57 signal in chondrocytes.

To analyze the physiological role of C/EBPbeta in skeletal growth and endochondral ossification, we investigated the skeletal phenotypes of heterozygous and homozygous C/EBPbeta-deficient (C/EBPbeta+/- and C/EBPbeta-/-) mice. Although the C/EBPbeta+/- skeleton was normal, C/EBPbeta-/- mice exhibited dwarfism as compared to the wild-type littermates from embryonic stages (Figure 1A). After birth, however, the skeletal size of C/EBPbeta-/- mice gradually caught up with that of the wild type littermates (Figure 1B), and they became similar after 1 week of age. At the embryos, the limbs and vertebrae which are known to be primarily formed through endochondral ossification were about 20-25% shorter in C/EBPbeta-/- mice than the wild-type, although calvarial growth, especially the width, formed through endochondral ossification and intramembranous ossification did not show such a difference (Figure 1D). Skeletal double staining revealed that not only the total bone length, but also the ratio of mineralized area shown by the positive Alizarin red staining to the total length was decreased, confirming that endochondral ossification was impaired by the C/EBPbeta deficiency (Figure 1C, E).

To know the mechanism underlying the impaired skeletal growth in C/EBPbeta-/- mice, we compared the tibial limb cartilage of the wild-type and C/EBPbeta-/- littermates at E16.5 (Figure 2A). Among the resting, proliferative, hypertrophic zones, and bone area, the proliferative zone was elongated while the hypertrophic zone was normal in the C/EBPbeta-/- limb (Figure 2B). The number of proliferating chondrocytes with BrdU uptake was actually increased in the C/EBPbeta-/- cartilage (Figure 2C).

C/EBPbeta was shown by immunohistochemistry to be localized predominantly in late proliferative and pre-hypertrophic chondrocytes of the wild-type cartilage, but not in the C/EBPbeta-/- cartilage (Figure 2D, top).

We then examined the effects of loss- and gain-of-functions of C/EBPbeta on proliferation and hypertrophic differentiation of the primary rib chondrocytes. When chondrocytes from wild-type and C/EBPbeta-/- littermates were compared, cell number determined by the XTT assay was enhanced in the C/EBPbeta-/- chondrocytes at 3 d of culture (Figure 3B). The percentage of BrdU-positive cells was also increased in the C/EBPbeta-/- culture at this time point (Figure 3C), indicating that the increased cell number was due to the enhanced proliferation, rather than the effect on cell survival, vitality, or apoptosis. Contrarily, hypertrophic differentiation determined by alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and Alizarin red stainings, and mRNA levels of COL10, matrix metalloproteinease-13 (MMP13) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), parameters of chondrocyte hypertrophy, were suppressed by the deficiency (Figure 3D).

In contrast, retroviral overexpression of C/EBPbeta in the wild-type rib chondrocytes suppressed the proliferation and enhanced the hypertrophic differentiation parameters (Figure 3E, F, and G). Collectively, C/EBPbeta was shown to be essential for cessation of proliferation and promotion of hypertrophic differentiation, suggesting arrest of the cell cycle and exit from it.

We therefore examined the regulation of cell cycle by C/EBPbeta. A DNA cell cycle histogram in mouse mesenchymal C3H10T1/2 cells after the cycle synchronization revealed that the C/EBPbeta overexpression enhanced accumulation of cells in the G0/G1 fraction (Figure 4A). To identify cell cycle factors lying downstream of the C/EBPbeta signal, we performed a screen of transcriptional targets of C/EBPbeta using a microarray analysis (Table S1). The C/EBPbeta overexpression caused downregulation of cyclin B1, B2 and D1, and upregulation of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors p16, p21 and p57, by 50% or more as compared to the empty vector overexpression. Since the above analyses were performed in non-chondrogenic C3H10T1/2 cells, we further examined the expressions of the candidate genes by real-time RT-PCR analysis in the cultures between wild-type and C/EBPbeta-/- rib chondrocytes (Figure 4B). Cyclin B1, B2, and p21 were not significantly altered by the C/EBPbeta deficiency, while p16 showed contradictory upregulation. Cyclin D1 and p57 were confirmed to be upregulated and downregulated, respectively, by the loss-of-function of C/EBPbeta. However, when the expressions were further compared between primary chondrocytes with retroviral overexpression of C/EBPbeta and the control GFP, the cyclin D1 was not downregulated, whereas p57 was upregulated by the C/EBPbeta overexpression. These indicate that p57 was the only cell cycle factor whose expression was confirmed to be regulated positively and negatively by the gain- and loss-of-functions of C/EBPbeta, respectively. Double immunofluorescence of p57 and BrdU in the wild-type cartilage revealed that p57 was localized predominantly in late proliferative and pre-hypertrophic chondrocytes which do not exhibit BrdU uptake (Figure 4C). The p57 expression was confirmed to be decreased in the C/EBPbeta-/- cartilage.

To know the mechanism underlying the induction of p57 expression by C/EBPbeta, we analyzed the promoter activity of p57 using human hepatoma HuH-7 cells and ATDC5 cells transfected with a luciferase reporter gene construct containing the 5'-flanking sequences from -1,092 to +226 bp of the p57 promoter (Figure 5A). The transcriptional activity determined by the luciferase-reporter assay was enhanced by co-transfection with C/EBPbeta in both cells, indicating the transcriptional induction of p57 by C/EBPbeta. Deletion analysis by a series of 5'-deletion constructs identified the responsive element to C/EBPbeta as being located between -150 and -130 bp region. The tandem-repeat constructs of this region were confirmed to respond to the C/EBPbeta overexpression depending on the repeat number in both cells (Figure 5B). As this region contained a putative C/EBP-binding motif [15], the site-directed mutagenesis was carried out by creating two mutations in the motif. Both of the mutations caused partial but significant suppression of the promoter activity in both cells, indicating that the C/EBP motif is a responsive element (Figure 5C). EMSA revealed the specific binding of the nuclear extract from C/EBPbeta-overexpressed ATDC5 cells with the oligonucleotide probe containing the identified responsive element above (Figure 5D). The mutagenesis in the C/EBP motif of the probe resulted in a failure to form the complex. Cold competition with excess amounts of an unlabeled wild-type probe, but not the mutated probe, suppressed the complex formation, confirming the specific binding to the C/EBPbeta motif. Specificity of C/EBPbeta binding was further verified by the antibody supershift. These lines of results demonstrate that C/EBPbeta transactivates the p57 promoter, at least in part, through direct binding to a C/EBP motif between the -150 and -130 bp region.

To know the functional interaction between C/EBPbeta and p57 during chondrocyte hypertrophic differentiation, we established two small interfering RNA (siRNA) constructs of p57 for the gene silencing. We initially confirmed significant decreases of p57 protein and mRNA levels by stable transfection of the two siRNAs (Figure 5E). The C/EBPbeta-induced hypertrophic differentiation of cultured rib chondrocytes determined by ALP staining and COL10 expression was suppressed by the p57 knockdown through the siRNA (Figure 5F), indicating the mediation of p57 in the C/EBPbeta induction of hypertrophic differentiation. We confirmed that retroviral overexpression of p57 enhanced the hypertrophy markers in cultured ATDC5 cells (Figure 5G).

In addition to the physiological role in skeletal growth in embryos, we finally examined the contribution of C/EBPbeta in chondrocytes under pathological conditions. We and others have reported that endochondral ossification including chondrocyte hypertrophy is a crucial step for cartilage destruction during osteoarthritis progression [16]-[20]. We therefore created an experimental osteoarthritis model that induces instability to the knee joints in 8-week-old wild-type mice [17], [21], and found that C/EBPbeta was localized at the frontline of cartilage degradation in the central and peripheral areas of the joint cartilage during osteoarthritis progression (Figure 6A). To know the functional involvement of C/EBPbeta under the pathological conditions, we compared the cartilage destruction between C/EBPbeta+/- and the wild-type littermates that showed similar phenotypes under physiological conditions (Figure 1A) [9]. C/EBPbeta-/- mice were not used in this experiment since their skeleton was originally small, the joint shape was abnormal, and the activity was low, so that mechanical stress caused by the joint instability was not assumed to be comparable to that of wild-type mice. The cartilage destruction as well as COL10 expression was suppressed in C/EBPbeta+/- mice, remaining a substantial undegraded matrix even 8 to 12 weeks after the surgery (Figure 6B). Quantification using the OARSI grading system [22] confirmed significant prevention of cartilage destruction by the C/EBPbeta haploinsufficiency (Figure 6C).

The present study for the first time demonstrated that the transcription factor C/EBPbeta is essential for physiological skeletal growth and endochondral ossification by analyses of the deficient mice. This function was dependent on the promotion of transition from proliferation to hypertrophic differentiation of chondrocytes through the cell cycle control. Our further screening of cell cycle factors identified the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p57 as the transcriptional target, and detected a responsive element of C/EBPbeta in the promoter. We finally showed the functional mediation of p57 in the C/EBPbeta action, and confirmed the importance of the C/EBPbeta-p57 signal in the chondrocyte hypertrophy during skeletal growth and osteoarthritis progression.

Growth retardation of C/EBPbeta-/- mice was seen during embryogenesis only and disappeared as the animals grew up after birth under physiological conditions (Figure 1A & B). This may possibly be due to compensatory mechanisms by other C/EBP family members which are known to control cellular differentiation in several lineages [23]-[26]. Regarding the mesenchymal cell lineage, C/EBPdelta has been reported to show similar and compensatory actions for adipogenic and osteogenic differentiation [11], [27]-[31]. Since the involvement of C/EBPdelta in chondrogenic differentiation from the mesenchymal precursors remains unknown, we initially examined the expression by immunohistochemistry in the limb cartilage (E16.5) (Figure S1A). It was expressed predominantly in late proliferative and pre-hypertrophic chondrocytes, similarly to the C/EBPbeta expression, and this was not altered in the C/EBPbeta-/- cartilage. In addition, retroviral overexpression of C/EBPdelta enhanced hypertrophic differentiation determined by COL10 and MMP13 mRNA levels in cultured ATDC5 cells (Figure S1B). Furthermore, the p57 promoter activity was enhanced by the C/EBPdelta overexpression, although the effect was somewhat weaker than that by C/EBPbeta (Figure S1C). Although we could not detect the distinct regulation of C/EBPbeta and C/EBPdelta expressions in the limb chondrocytes before and after birth, their actions on chondrocyte hypertrophy might be compensatory, especially postnatally. We are now investigating the role of C/EBPdelta in the skeletal growth using the knockout mice as well as the double knockout mice of C/EBPbeta and C/EBPdelta.

The runt family transcription factor member Runx2 [1], [32], [33], parathyroid hormone/parathyroid hormone-related protein (PTH/PTHrP) [1], [34], and cyclic GMP-dependent protein kinase II (cGKII) [35], [36] are known as representative regulators of chondrocyte hypertrophy, and interestingly, C/EBPbeta has been reported to be associated with these representative regulators. C/EBPbeta acts as a co-activator of Runx2 [6], [37]. Generally, the complex of the members of the C/EBP and Runx families is known to interact in the activation of lineage-specific promoters during differentiation of osteoblasts, adipocytes, and granulocytes [6]. Unlike Runx2-/- mice that exhibit a complete lack of bone [32], C/EBPbeta-/- mice showed almost normal bone, raising the possibility of functional redundancy with other isoforms such as C/EBPalpha or C/EBPdelta in osteoblast differentiation. Contrarily, both Runx2-/- and C/EBPbeta-/- mice showed impairment of chondrocyte hypertrophy during cartilage development and growth [32], [33], implicating a specific interaction between C/EBPbeta and Runx2 in cartilage. In the present study, the site-directed mutagenesis in the C/EBP motif of the p57 promoter caused significant but incomplete suppression of the promoter activity induced by the C/EBPbeta overexpression (Figure 5C). Actually, there is a putative Runx motif which lies close to this C/EBP motif in this region. C/EBPbeta might therefore stimulate the promoter activity at the Runx motif as a co-activator of Runx2, even after the innate binding was blocked, although our luciferase assay and EMSA so far have failed to find evidence of this.

Contrarily to Runx2, PTH/PTHrP keeps chondrocytes proliferating and inhibits their hypertrophic differentiation [1], [34]. The PTH/PTHrP action via the adenyl cyclase signal in chondrocytes is reported to be dependent on the suppression of p57 expression [38], implicating a possible mediation of C/EBPbeta in this pathway. However, our present study showed that neither PTH nor the adenyl cyclase activator forskolin affected the C/EBPbeta protein level in cultured ATDC5 cells or the activity of the p57 promoter (-150 to +226 bp) with or without induction by C/EBPbeta (Figure S2). Although C/EBPbeta is therefore unlikely to mediate the p57 suppression by PTH/PTHrP directly, its possible involvement as a co-activator of Runx2 again cannot be denied here, since the PTH/PTHrP action is also at least partly dependent on the Runx2 suppression in chondrocytes [39].

cGKII is a serine/threonine kinase lying downstream of the C-type natriuretic peptide pathway which is essential for skeletal growth [40]. We and others have reported that the deficiency of cGKII in mice and rats caused dwarfism due to impaired hypertrophic differentiation of chondrocytes [35], [41], similarly to the present C/EBPbeta-/- mice. Interestingly, a previous study showed that cGKII activated C/EBPbeta through phosphorylation of glycogen synthase kinase-3beta (GSK-3beta) in osteosarcoma cells [42], and our recent study showed that cGKII induced chondrocyte hypertrophic differentiation through the GSK-3beta phosphorylation [36]. These suggest a possible mediation of the present C/EBPbeta-p57 signal in the cGKII-GSK-3beta action. However, neither cGKII nor GSK-3beta overexpression altered at least the activity of the p57 promoter (-150 to +226 bp) with or without induction by C/EBPbeta (Figure S3). Moreover, there is a marked difference in the limb cartilage phenotype between cGKII-/- and C/EBPbeta-/- mice. Unlike the cGKII-/- cartilage characterized by appearance of a wide abnormal intermediate layer between the proliferative and hypertrophic zones [35], [41], the C/EBPbeta-/- cartilage only exhibited an elongated proliferative zone and delayed chondrocyte hypertrophy (Figure 2D). Hence, the cell cycle arrest in chondrocytes caused by C/EBPbeta appears to immediately link to the start of the differentiation. The discrepancy may be due to the diversity of signaling pathway(s) lying downstream of cGKII and upstream of C/EBPbeta. We previously reported that cGKII phosphorylated Sox9, an inhibitor of chondrocyte hypertrophy, and suppressed its nuclear entry [35]. Besides Sox9 and GSK-3beta, vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein and cysteine- and glycine-rich protein 2 are putative phosphorylation targets of cGKII in other types of cells [43]. In addition to the abovementioned GSK-3beta, C/EBPbeta is also targeted by multiple protein kinases including protein kinase A, calmodulin-dependent protein kinase, Erk-1/2, ribosomal protein S6 kinase, and CDK2 [44].

The skeletal abnormalities of C/EBPbeta-/- mice were much milder than those of the p57-/- mice which were perinatally lethal due to various defects analogous to Beckwith-Weidemann syndrome in children, including cleft palate and body wall dysplasia besides severe dwarfism [38], [45]-[47]. This may be because p57 is more crucial for chondrocyte hypertrophic differentiation than C/EBPbeta whose function could be substituted by several upstream signals of p57. In fact, the C/EBPbeta deficiency did not abrogate, but partially suppressed the p57 expression in chondrocytes (Figure 4B, C), while the knockdown of p57 strongly suppressed the C/EBPbeta-induced hypertrophic differentiation of chondrocytes (Figure 5F). Among other cell cycle factors, mice lacking the Rb-related pocket proteins p107 and p130 show skeletal phenotype very similar to that of the p57-/- mice [48], indicating that these proteins are likely to be major downstream targets of the cyclin-CDK complexes that are inhibited by p57 in chondrocytes. More interestingly, the Cip/Kip family proteins have recently been reported to regulate pathways distinct from that of cell cycle control [14]. Since p57 supports skeletal myoblast differentiation by inhibiting phosphorylation of the key transcription factor MyoD [49], this factor might also induce chondrocyte hypertrophic differentiation by regulating crucial transcription factors like Runx2 or Sox9. This may also explain the direct linkage from the cell cycle arrest to cell differentiation by the C/EBPbeta-p57 signaling, unlike the cGKII signal, as mentioned above.

We conclude that C/EBPbeta directly transactivates p57 to promote transition from proliferation to hypertrophic differentiation of chondrocytes during endochondral ossification. Besides the anabolic function for physiological skeletal growth, the C/EBPbeta haploinsufficiency in adult mice caused resistance to cartilage destruction during osteoarthritis progression in knee joints (Figure 6). Furthermore, C/EBPbeta has been reported to be induced by proinflammatory cytokines interleukin-1 and tumor necrosis factor-alpha, and to mediate the decrease of articular cartilage matrix by suppressing the promoter activity of cartilage characteristic genes like cartilage-derived retinoic acid-sensitive protein and type II collagen [50]-[52]. The cytokine-induced C/EBPbeta also enhances the promoter activity of prostaglandin synthetic enzymes like cyclooxygenase-2 and phospholipase A2 [53], [54] and proteinases like aggrecanase-1 and matrix metalloproteinase-1 [55], [56] in chondrocytes. These lines of evidence indicate that the C/EBPbeta-p57 signal could be a therapeutic target of inflammatory and degenerative joint disorders as well as skeletal growth retardation.

The surgical procedure to create an osteoarthritis experimental model was performed on 8-week-old male mice, as we have reported previously [17], [20], [21]. At the indicated time points after surgery, the mice were killed, and the entire knee joints were dissected and fixed for 24 h at 4degreesC in 4% PFA. The specimens were decalcified for 2 weeks with 10% EDTA (pH 7.4) at 4degreesC and sectioned in 5-microm slices. Sections were stained with Safranin O-fast green. Destruction of cartilage was quantified according to the OARSI grading system [22]. For immunohistochemistry, the sections were incubated with antibodies to C/EBPbeta (Santa Cruz), COL10 (LSL) or the nonimmune rabbit IgG as the negative control diluted 1:500 in blocking reagent, and the localization was detected with HRP-conjugated secondary antibody (Promega).
