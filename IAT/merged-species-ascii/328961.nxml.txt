We report the sequence of the complete bovine alpha-s1 casein gene eludicating for the first time the genomic organization of an alpha-s type casein gene. Extending over 17508 bp the gene is split into 19 exons, ranging in size from 24 bp to 385 bp. Except for the translational stop codon not a single coding triplet of the alpha-s1 reading frame is disrupted by any of the splice junctions, which all confirm to known splice consensus sequences. Nine out of 16 coding exons begin with a 'GAX' codon, specific for glutamate. Splicing of this codon from exon 10 to the preceding exon creates a major phosphorylation site. An intron-exon-intron stretch of 154 bp comprising exons 10 and 13 is found precisely duplicated. Associated with the gene, copies of 8 atriodactyla retroposons are found, 6 of which are interspersed into the sequences of the three longest introns. We discuss the possibility that three functional parts of the gene have been recruited and evolutionary conserved at a time before gene diversification gave rise to the separate evolution of alpha- and beta-type casein-genes.
