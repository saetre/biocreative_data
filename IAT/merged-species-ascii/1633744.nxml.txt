HNSCC progression to adjacent tissue and nodes may be mediated by altered glycoproteins and glycolipids such as MUC1 mucin. This report constitutes a detailed statistical study about MUC1 expression and anti-MUC1 immune responses in relation to different clinical and pathological parameters which may be useful to develop new anti HNSCC therapeutic strategies.

Fifty three pre treatment HNSCC patients were included: 26 (49.1%) bearing oral cavity tumors, 17 (32.1%) localized in the larynx and 10 (18.8%) in the pharynx. Three patients (5.7%) were at stage I, 5 (9.4%) stage II, 15 (28.3%) stage III and 30 (56.6%) at stage IV. MUC1 tumor expression was studied by immunohistochemistry employing two anti-MUC1 antibodies: CT33, anti cytoplasmic tail MUC1 polyclonal antibody (Ab) and C595 anti-peptidic core MUC1 monoclonal antibody. Serum levels of MUC1 and free anti-MUC1 antibodies were detected by ELISA and circulating immune complexes (CIC) by precipitation in polyethylene glycol (PEG) 3.5%; MUC1 isolation from circulating immune complexes was performed by protein A-sepharose CL-4B affinity chromatography followed by SDS-PAGE and Western blot. Statistical analysis consisted in Multivariate Principal Component Analysis (PCA); ANOVA test (Tukey's test) was employed to find differences among groups; nonparametrical correlations (Kendall's Tau) were applied when necessary. Statistical significance was set to p < 0.05 in all cases.

MUC1 cytoplasmic tail was detected in 40/50 (80%) and MUC1 protein core in 9/50 (18%) samples while serum MUC1 levels were elevated in 8/53 (15%) patients. A significant statistical correlation was found between MUC1 serum levels and anti-MUC1 IgG free antibodies, while a negative correlation between MUC1 serum levels and anti-MUC1 IgM free antibodies was found. Circulating immune complexes were elevated in 16/53 (30%) samples and were also statistically associated with advanced tumor stage. MUC1 was identified as an antigenic component of IgG circulating immune complexes. Moreover, poorly differentiated tumors were inversely correlated with tumor and serum MUC1 detection and positively correlated with node involvement and tumor mass.

Conclusion
###end title 8
###begin p 9
Possibly, tumor cells produce MUC1 mucin which is liberated to the circulation and captured by IgG antibodies forming MUC1-IgG-CIC. Another interesting conclusion is that poorly differentiated tumors are inversely correlated with tumor and serum MUC1 detection.

In western countries, head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) occupies the 5th place in frequency and also is the 5th cause of mortality due to cancer. HNSCC localization consists about 40% in the oral cavity, 15% in the pharynx, 25% in the larynx and the rest sites such as salivary glands and thyroid [1,2]. Data obtained from argentinian records show some differences compared with data found in other countries since the most frequent localization has been larynx (1665/3127, 53%) followed by oral cavity (1035/3127, 33%) and finally, pharynx showing 427/3127, 14%. In 2002, the total number of HNSCC cases informed in Argentina was 3127 (16.9/100000) inhabitants [3].

HNSCC mainly progress to adjacent tissue and nodes while distant metastasis is a late event. The ability of tumor cells to invade is an acquired and progressive phenomenon mediated, in many cases, by the alteration of membrane glycoproteins such as mucins. Dabelsteen and Gao [5] proposed that the presence of different glycosylation patterns modulate the behavior of these membrane glycoproteins involved in cell signaling. In adenocarcinoma, particular interest has been focused on MUC1 mucin; in previous publications we have extensively detected MUC1 and associated epitopes in HNSCC and also we have isolated this mucin from larynx primary squamous cell carcinoma [6-8]. MUC1 is a large heterodimeric glycoprotein formed by a highly glycosilated extracellular portion associated to a small cytoplasmic tail [9].

In addition, circulating immune complexes levels were statistically associated with tumor size, inversely associated with MUC1 tumor expression and were not positively associated with serum MUC1 and free anti-MUC1 IgG. Finally, tumor size, node involvement and poor differentiation were positively associated.

Fifty three pre treatment HNSCC patients from the "Hospital General Interzonal de Agudos Gral. San Martin", La Plata, Argentina were included in this study (Table 1); all tumors were primary; patients with previous history of HNSCC or who had received preoperative therapy were not included. Patients were clinically categorized according to the American Joint Cancer Committee (AJCC, Cancer Staging Manual, 2002). Sex and age distribution of patients was: 39 males (73.6%) and 14 (26.4%) females with a mean age of 60.67 (11.55 SD) years and a range from 29 to 98 years. Twenty six patients (49.1%) had their primary tumor located in the oral cavity, 17 (32.0%) in the larynx and 10 (18.9%) in the pharynx. Three patients (5.7%) were at stage I, 5 (9.4%) at stage II, 15 (28.3%) at stage III and 30 (56.6%) at stage IV; stages IVA, IVB and IVC cases where also included. Eighteen were classified as well differentiated (34.6%), 19 as moderately differentiated (36.5%) and 15 as poorly differentiated (28.9%). Patient's data were obtained from clinical records.

Finally, sections were counterstained with hematoxylin (Sigma, USA), dehydrated and coverslipped with mounting media. Samples were evaluated under a light microscope and a positive reaction was considered when more than 5% of the neoplasic cells were stained. Staining intensity was scored in a semiquantitative manner [16] and was graded as negative (-), low (+), moderate (++) and strong (+++). Patterns of reaction were classified as linear (plasma membrane), cytoplasmic, mixed (linear and cytoplasmic) and nuclear following other authors [17,18] with some modifications [15].

Detection of antibodies reactive with the protein core of MUC1 was performed by an ELISA described by von Mensdorff-Pouilly [22] with some modifications [23]. Briefly, 100 mul/well of 1 mul/ml BSA were dispensed onto 3912 Falcon III flexible PVC 96 wells plates (BD Labware, USA) and dried overnight at 37degreesC. After washing, 50 mul of a 100mer peptide containing five tandem repeats of the MUC1 core protein (100 mu/ml) and 50 mul of carbodiimide (1-cycloexil-3-[2 morpholinoethyl] carbodiimide metho-p-sulphonate (Sigma, USA) were dispensed in duplicates. For each sample, 2 wells were incubated with carbodiimide-peptide and two other wells were employed as controls containing 100 mul of blocking buffer (1% BSA PBS) at 4degreesC overnight. After washing, 150 mul of blocking buffer was added and incubated at room temperature for 1 hour. Plates were washed and diluted human serum samples in blocking buffer (1:80 for IgM and 1:40 for IgG determinations) were applied and incubated overnight at 4degreesC. After washing, 50 mul of peroxidase conjugated goat anti-human IgM 1:400 or IgG 1:600 (Sigma, USA) in PBS Tween-BSA 0.1% were dispensed and incubated for 1 hour at room temperature. Finally, the reaction was developed with 50 mul of freshly prepared ABTS in 0.1 M citric acid and 0.2 M Na2PO4H (pH 5) with H2O2. After 1 hour at room temperature in the dark, OD was read at 405 nm. Free anti-MUC1 core antibody levels were calculated as the difference between the averages of carbodiimide-peptide wells and controls. Cut off was 0.340 OD for anti-MUC1 IgM and 0.274 for IgG Abs.

Tissue MUC1 expression from 50 HNSCC tumor samples was studied employing two different anti MUC1 antibodies (Table 2). CT33 Ab, reactive with MUC1 cytoplasmic tail, was present in 40 (80%) HNSCC specimens, 22/25 tumors localized in oral cavity, 11/16 in the larynx and 7/9 in the pharynx. Reaction pattern was similar to previous reports developed in breast cancer employing the CT2 monoclonal antibody directed against the same last 17 aa of the MUC1 cytoplasmic tail (Croce et al, 2003). Cell membrane staining with a linear pattern was observed in 34 (68%) specimens, a cytoplasmic reaction was obtained in 32 (64%) samples while 27 (54%) had a mixed pattern (Fig. 1b). Also, a nuclear staining was displayed in 4 (8%) specimens. There were no statistically significant differences in MUC1 cytoplasmic tail expression related to tumor stage, localization or differentiation, although a clear tendency of negative CT33 reaction was found in advanced stage tumors while nuclear staining was associated with poorly differentiated tumor areas.

Well differentiated tumors showed a strong reaction limited to the cytoplasm and cell membrane and mainly located in areas with keratin. In moderately and poorly differentiated tumors, a reaction was observed along the cytoplasm with a microvesicular pattern. No correlation was found between C595 monoclonal antibody reactivity versus tumor stage, node status or tumor differentiation. An example of C595 staining is depicted in Fig. 1a.

Free anti-MUC1 serum Ab levels measured in HNSCC were lower than normal sex and age matched controls. Anti-MUC1 IgM mean value in cancer patients was 0.085 OD versus 0.194 OD in controls and anti-MUC1 IgG mean was 0.097 OD vs 0.171 OD. A negative correlation between IgG and IgM levels (Kendall tau = -0.309, p = 0.001) was found. Both anti-MUC1 IgG and anti-MUC1 IgM were statistically correlated with MUC1 serum levels (Fig. 3), while IgG levels were detected according to MUC1 levels, anti-MUC1 IgM levels were very low in those patients over MUC1 cut off levels (4 U/mL). This association was also found by the multivariate Principal Component Analysis; in Fig. 2 the vectors representing anti-MUC1 IgG and IgM are drawn opposed, while the vector that represents serum MUC1 was at the same quadrant of anti-MUC1 IgG.

Fifty three HNSCC patients presented a mean circulating immune complexes value of 0.224 OD (SD = 0.103 OD) statistically different from normal negative controls (mean = 0.171 OD, SD = 0.029; p = 0.038) and positive controls (SLE patients), mean = 0.456 OD, SD = 0.121 OD; p < 0.001. Tumor stage was statistically associated with circulating immune complexes levels (Fig. 4); two way ANOVA test with post hoc analysis of means showed differences between T2 and T3 tumors versus T4 although node invasion did not present any difference. Also, a statistical significant difference was found between well differentiated and moderately differentiated tumor samples, which presented a large amount of circulating immune complexes (p < 0.05) (Fig. 5). On the other hand, although undifferentiated tumors had circulating immune complexes levels similar to well differentiated tumors, no statistical difference was found between poor versus moderately differentiated specimens. Elevated circulating immune complexes levels were found in 16/53 patients (30.2%) which belonged to tumor stage I 1/3 (33%), stage III 3/15 (20%) and stage IV 12/30 (40%).

Eight out of 16 (50%) serum samples contained MUC1-CIC; results are shown in Table 3. In each case, clinical data have been included. In Fig. 6, results found in two patients are depicted, Western blot employing C595 monoclonal antibody showed a double band at about 200 kDa. Also, bands at the molecular weight ranging from 25 to 60 kD were observed which correspond to Ig light and heavy chains. No statistical correlation was found between MUC1-CIC and tumor or sera MUC1 expression.

Multivariate analysis of MUC1 expression, anti-MUC1 immune response and clinical and pathological parameters in HNSCC showed that histological detection with CT33 and C595 Abs were associated with serum MUC1 levels. Moreover, serum MUC1 levels were positively correlated with anti-MUC1 IgG free antibodies and inversely correlated with anti-MUC1 IgM. This suggested an association between the presence of MUC1 in serum and the type of antibody response.

In previous studies developed in colon and breast cancer [13,14], we have found similar results. The MUC1 cytoplasmic tail amino acid sequence contains seven tyrosine residues constituting intracellular signaling motifs [22] which play important roles in cell response to external stimuli and is related to different oncogenes and genes controlling the cell cycle [23,24][25,26] and beta-catenin [27]. Furthermore, it has been reported that in vivo, MUC1 cytoplasmic tail regulates erbB receptors signaling through the activation of MAPK pathways [28].

These observations clearly demonstrate the transforming properties of MUC1 overexpression in carcinoma and emphasize the importance of MUC1 cytoplasmic tail subcellular localization. In HNSCC we have found extensive expression and cellular localization of MUC1 cytoplasmic tail; large and poorly differentiated tumors were likely to be less reactive with CT33 and C595 Abs.

When C595 (anti-extracellular MUC1) monoclonal antibody was assayed, a lower percentage of reactivity with respect to anti-MUC1 cytoplasmic tail was found; we have previously reported a high reactivity to MUC1 protein core epitopes in HNSCC [7,8]. The difference among results was expected since previous reports included a larger number of tumors localized in oral cavity (58%) in comparison with 49.1% in the present report; we found that this localization is reactive with anti-protein core monoclonal antibodies [7]. On the other hand, results presented here corresponded to 18.9% of pharyngeal tumors which did not usually react with these monoclonal antibodies; in past reports, only one patient with a pharyngeal tumor was included [7]. MUC1 cytoplasmic tail reactivity is not affected by MUC1 glycosylation and sialylation and, consequently, represents a better indicator of cell membrane associated MUC1 [15]. Other authors [29-31] have described MUC1 RNA splice variants which do not express the protein core region. Our results also showed that serum MUC1 levels were elevated in 15% of HNSCC samples; interestingly, we found a statistically significant correlation between serum and tumor MUC1 detection indicating that this mucin may possibly be released by the tumor.

In this research we found anti-MUC1 antibodies; also, we observed that serum MUC1 levels were positively correlated with free anti-MUC1 IgG, which may indicate that an anti-MUC1 immune response is mounted. Tumor derived MUC1 is known to induce cellular and humoral specific immune responses in cancer patients [32-34]. In this context, it is possible to speculate that a specific anti-MUC1 immune response is induced in HNSCC patients.

In another report [11], we pointed out that low MUC1 serum levels in stage I breast cancer patients were associated with the presence of free and complexed anti-MUC1 antibodies. Similarly, circulating anti-MUC1-IgG antibody levels were found predictive of survival in breast [35] and pancreatic cancer patients [34]. We have found that anti-MUC1 IgG Ab correlated negatively with poor HNSCC differentiation and disease stage which are the main predictors for patient outcome in this localization.

Furthermore, we proved that MUC1-CIC detected by Western blot were of the IgG isotype since isolation was performed by protein A Sepharose CL-4B chromatography, which is known to bind with high affinity to 1, 2 and 4 IgG classes.

Presence of high amounts of circulating immune complexes in cancer patients is not very well understood. Antibody formation may represent the onset of an anti tumor immune response but, on the other hand, may be the consequence of tumor immune evasion related to a defective cellular immune response. Nonetheless, circulating immune complexes have been associated with tumor progression and also, their formation clearly affects the correct evaluation of several tumor markers.

Only a few reports in the literature have described the antigenic component of circulating immune complexes in HNSCC. Vlock DR and others [36] have exhaustively studied the reactivity of serum Abs against autologous tumor cell lines. These authors found that some patients presented high Ab titers which occasionally cross reacted with tumor cell lines derived from other histogenesis.

In accordance with other reports [37,38], we found higher circulating immune complexes levels in HNSCC patients in comparison with normal subjects; furthermore, we also agree with these authors that elevated circulating immune complexes levels were detected in advanced tumor stage. They pointed out that high circulating immune complexes levels in HNSCC patients is the result of increased tumor mass which would mediate changes in anti tumor immunity. Moreover, Das TK et al [39] found that circulating immune complexes persist after surgical excision of the primary tumor due to the presence of remaining tumor tissue or occult metastasis.

MUC1 is a mucin that has been detected both in the cytoplasm, plasma membrane and nucleus in different tumor localizations. MUC1 is synthesized in the ER and glycosylated in the Golgi apparatus but it has been described that it suffers several glycosylation cycles being expressed in the plasma membrane several times [40]. Furthermore, different splicing variants have been described that can be present in the cytoplasm and in the plasma membrane, as well [31,41-43]. Wen et al [44] investigated intracellular trafficking of MUC1 cytoplasmic tail in human pancreatic cancer cell lines S2-013 and Panc-1 and detected this fraction at the inner cell surface, in the cytosol and in the nucleus. They hypothesized that the association between beta-catenin and fragments of the MUC1 cytoplasmic tail facilitated the cytosol-to-nuclear translocation of beta-catenin and contributed to its nuclear accumulation. We have found [14] MUC1 cytoplasmic tail and protein core expression in the plasma membrane, cytoplasm and nucleus in breast and colorectal tumor samples.

In HNSCC, Principal Component Analysis (Fig. 2) showed that circulating immune complexes were associated with advanced tumor stage; furthermore, the vectors that represent these variables did not positively correlate to serum MUC1 and anti-MUC1 IgG antibody levels, and also were inversely correlated with MUC1 tumor expression. Considering that we identified MUC1 as an antigenic component of circulating immune complexes, taken together, these results indicate that a large tumor mass produces high MUC1 mucin that is liberated to circulation and captured by IgG antibodies forming MUC1-CIC.

Another interesting conclusion is that poorly differentiated tumors are inversely correlated with tumor and serum MUC1 detection. This finding suggests the possibility to take into account its consideration regarding prognosis and follow up of this disease.

a - Immunohistochemical detection of MUC1 extracellular epitopes. A stage III larynx carcinoma specimen incubated with anti-MUC1 C595 monoclonal antibody is shown. Cell membrane and cytoplasm are stained over all the picture with a microvesicular pattern. Staining is strong inalmost all cells as well as in high proportion of intercellular connections. b - Immunohistochemical detection of MUC1 cytoplasmic tail epitopes. Section of a stage IV larynx carcinoma incubated with CT33 antibody is shown. Different cellular patterns are identified. Intense reaction is observed along the cytoplasm with a granular pattern and linear at nuclear membrane. Plasma membrane is partially stained. Cells are polymorphic as well as nuclei, showing different size and vesicular nuclear patterns. Some intercellular bridges are also stained with this antibody.

Multivariate Principal Component Analysis of clinical and histopathological data and tissue and serum expression of MUC1. Each variable is represented by vectors, which longitude correspond to the weight of the variable in the model, and their projection to both axes corresponds to the weight of the two main factors extracted (Factor 1 and Factor 2). These two factors explain 39% of the variations observedin the model. This percentage is remarkable taking into account that variables belong to patients. CIC = Circulating immune complexes levels; T = Tumor stage; N = Node status; DIF = tumor differentiation; CASA = Serum MUC1 levels; IgM Ab = free anti-MUC1 IgM antibodies; IgG Ab = free anti-MUC1 IgG antibodies; C595 = MUC1 extracellular domain expression; CT33 = MUC1 Cytoplasmic tail expression.

Correlation between serum MUC1 levels measured by Cancer Associated Serum Assay (U/mL) and free anti-MUC1 antibodies. Serum MUC1 levels were plotted in abscises against anti-MUC1 IgG Abs (left coordinates) and IgM Abs (right coordinates). A negative correlation between serum MUC1 levels versus anti-MUC1 IgM Abs (tau = -0.266; p < 0.05) and a positive correlation between serum MUC1 levels and IgG Abs are observed (tau = 0.194; p < 0.05).
