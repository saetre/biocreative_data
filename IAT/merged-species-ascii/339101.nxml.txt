A complete 120 bp genomic consensus sequence for the mouse minor satellite has been determined from enriched L929 centromeric sequences. The extensive sequence homology existing between the major and minor satellite suggests an evolutionary relationship. Some sequences flanking the minor satellite has also been identified and they provide insight into centromeric DNA organization. Isotopic in situ hybridization analysis of the minor satellite to mouse L929 and Mus musculus metaphase spreads showed that this repetitive DNA class is localized specifically to centromeres of all chromosomes of the karyotype. With the use of high resolution non-isotopic fluorescence in situ hybridization the minor satellite is further localized to the outer surface of the centromere in a discrete region at or immediately adjacent to the kinetochore. Our cytological data suggests that the minor satellite might play a role in the organization of the kinetochore region rather than, as previously suggested, sites for general anchoring of the genome to the nuclear matrix.
