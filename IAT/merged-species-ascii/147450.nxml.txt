The equine IGF2 gene has been cloned and characterised. It spans a 9 kb region, which is substantially less than the corresponding human gene. Three coding exons and three untranslated leader exons, all highly homologous to those in other species, were identified. Downstream of the polyadenylation site in exon 6, a dinucleotide repeat sequence was identified. Three putative promoters (P1-P3) were localised in the 5' region of the gene. RNase protection analysis revealed two active promoters in fetal tissues, P2 and P3, whereas P3 was the only promoter active in adult tissues. This represents a transcriptional pattern different from that in humans or rodents. A novel structural element, an inverted repeat, is predicted in the 3' region of the IGF2 gene. This repeat is conserved between species and located in a region which is differentially methylated in the human and mouse genes and might therefore be involved in the imprinting mechanism. The inverted repeat acquires a stem-loop structure in vitro with a hybrid A/B-DNA conformation in the stem area. Both in horse and mouse, a methylation-sensitive protein binds this structure with a strong requirement for the loop area. Furthermore, the protein might be developmentally regulated.
