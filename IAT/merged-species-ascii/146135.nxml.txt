We have previously mapped a repression domain from the active transcriptional repressor E4BP4 to a 65 amino acid segment near the C-terminus of the polypeptide. Here we show that the E4BP4 repression domain interacts specifically with the TBP binding repressor protein Dr1. Mutants that affect the ability of E4BP4 to bring about transcriptional repression are also deficient in their binding of Dr1. The results are discussed in the light of evidence for squelching of a 'global' repressor by a DNA binding defective E4BP4 mutant.
