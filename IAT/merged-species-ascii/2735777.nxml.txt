Aggregates formed between leukocytes and platelets in the circulation lead to release of tissue factor (TF)-bearing microparticles contributing to a prothrombotic state. As enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli (EHEC) may cause hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS), in which microthrombi cause tissue damage, this study investigated whether the interaction between blood cells and EHEC virulence factors Shiga toxin (Stx) and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) led to release of TF.

The interaction between Stx or LPS and blood cells induced platelet-leukocyte aggregate formation and tissue factor (TF) release, as detected by flow cytometry in whole blood. O157LPS was more potent than other LPS serotypes. Aggregates formed mainly between monocytes and platelets and less so between neutrophils and platelets. Stimulated blood cells in complex expressed activation markers, and microparticles were released. Microparticles originated mainly from platelets and monocytes and expressed TF. TF-expressing microparticles, and functional TF in plasma, increased when blood cells were simultaneously exposed to the EHEC virulence factors and high shear stress. Stx and LPS in combination had a more pronounced effect on platelet-monocyte aggregate formation, and TF expression on these aggregates, than each virulence factor alone. Whole blood and plasma from HUS patients (n = 4) were analyzed. All patients had an increase in leukocyte-platelet aggregates, mainly between monocytes and platelets, on which TF was expressed during the acute phase of disease. Patients also exhibited an increase in microparticles, mainly originating from platelets and monocytes, bearing surface-bound TF, and functional TF was detected in their plasma. Blood cell aggregates, microparticles, and TF decreased upon recovery.

Platelets and leukocytes do not interact with each other in the circulation under normal circumstances. Enhanced platelet-leukocyte interactions occur in vivo in vascular disease processes, such as unstable angina, acute myocardial infarction, and stroke [1], in polycythemia vera [2] and diabetes [3] as well as during vascular surgical procedures such as cardiopulmonary bypass [1] and aortic valve surgery [4]. The formation of platelet-leukocyte aggregates plays an important role in the initiation of thrombogenesis and inflammation [5]. Upon platelet activation, P-selectin is released and expressed on the cell surface. Binding of P-selectin to its ligand P-selectin glycoprotein ligand 1 (PSGL-1), constitutively expressed on all leukocytes, mediates the formation of platelet-leukocyte aggregates in the circulation and on damaged vascular surfaces on which platelets and fibrin have been deposited [1]. Leukocytes can roll on activated platelets enabling binding and migration into inflammatory tissues. Binding of platelets to monocytes and neutrophils results in expression of the integrin CD11b/CD18 which enables further aggregate formation by interaction with the GPIb receptor on platelets [6], alternatively with fibrinogen bound to the GPIIb/IIIa receptor [7] expressed on activated platelets. Activated platelets, monocytes and neutrophils release microparticles which express tissue factor (TF) [8], [9], [10].

TF is a transmembrane cell surface glycoprotein that acts as a receptor for coagulation factor VII/VIIa, catalyzes the conversion of factor X to the active form Xa and ultimately leads to thrombin formation. Thrombin converts fibrinogen to fibrin resulting in formation of an insoluble fibrin clot [11]. In addition, thrombin is a potent stimulator of platelet activation [12]. Excessive expression of TF occurs in prothrombotic conditions such as sepsis, endotoxemia, systemic lupus erythematosus, atherosclerosis, Crohn's disease, transplant rejection reactions and hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS) [13], [14], [15], [16], [17], [18].

HUS develops as a complication of Shiga toxin (Stx)-producing enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli (EHEC) infection of which serotype O157:H7 is the most commonly detected. HUS is characterized by non-immune hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia and acute renal failure [19]. HUS is a prothrombotic state in which platelets are activated and fibrinolysis is decreased [20], [21], [22]. The mechanisms by which thrombotic microangiopathy occurs during HUS have not been fully elucidated. Stx may contribute to the process by inducing endothelial cell damage [23] an effect enhanced in the presence of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) [24] which increases Stx binding [25]. Stx promotes platelet deposition on endothelial cells exposed to high shear stress [26]. Endothelial cell injury could, potentially, expose the subendothelium releasing thrombogenic factors, such as fibrinogen and von Willebrand factor, which could trigger platelet aggregation. Furthermore, Stx can interact directly with platelets inducing their activation [27].

In the present study the effects of Stx2 and LPS on platelet-leukocyte aggregate formation and TF expression were investigated in order to identify a prothrombotic mechanism contributing to thrombotic microangiopathy. The in vivo relevance of platelet-leukocyte aggregate formation and TF expression was studied in samples from HUS patients.

Venous blood was obtained from 25 human healthy volunteers (16 women, 9 men) not using any medications. Blood samples were also available from three boys and one girl aged 1-9 years (median 2 years), diagnosed with EHEC-associated HUS and treated at the Department of Pediatrics, Lund University Hospital. Patient samples were taken on the first day after admission, while the children had clinical signs of HUS. HUS was defined as hemolytic anemia (hemoglobin levels <100 g/L), elevated lactic dehydrogenase, thrombocytopenia (platelet counts <140x109/L) and acute renal failure. Blood was also obtained from all four children two to four months after recovery. Laboratory diagnosis of EHEC infection was determined by PCR and serotyping of fecal isolate serotypes [28]. Fecal isolates were positive for Stx2-producing E. coli O157:H7 in three cases and in the fourth case for Stx1- and Stx2- producing E. coli O98:H21. Samples were also available from 4 pediatric controls, 3 boys and 1 girl, aged 5-11 years (median 6.5 years). These children were seen at the out-patient clinic of the Department of Pediatrics, Lund University Hospital, for follow-up of posterior urethral valve, recurrent urinary tract infections or neuroblastoma. None of the pediatric controls had a history of diarrhea or HUS. Samples were also obtained from three patients with acute renal failure, 2 males aged 25 and 62 years, respectively, and one girl from which blood was obtained at 7 days of age. The adult patients were treated at the Department of Nephrology of the University Hospitals of Malmo and Lund for renal failure due to vitamin D intoxication and acute tubular necrosis, respectively. The child was treated at the Department of Pediatrics, Lund University Hospital for renal failure after heart surgery.

Blood was drawn by venipuncture via a butterfly needle (Plasti Medical S.p.A, Villamarzana, Italy) with low tourniquet or through an intravenous cannula (Neoflontrade markCannula, Becton Dickinson, Franklin Lakes, NJ). The first 2 mL were discarded and the required volume collected into plastic tubes containing 0.27 mL 0.109 M sodium citrate (Becton Dickinson, Plymouth, UK) or heparin (68 IU, Beckton Dickinson). After blood sampling the blood was diluted (1:2) in sterile LPS-free RPMI-1640 (Invitrogen, Paisley,UK) containing Gly-Pro-Arg-Pro (GPRP, 10 mM; Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO), to prevent the polymerization of fibrin molecules. Samples were used as whole blood (sodium citrate) in flow cytometry and flow chamber perfusion experiments or centrifuged at 2000xg for 15 minutes to obtain platelet-poor-plasma used to quantify microparticles or for tissue factor activity assays. Plasma was stored at -80degreesC until used. Heparinized samples were used for purification of leukocytes as described below.

To detect platelet-monocyte aggregates whole blood was incubated with mouse anti-human CD42b:RPE-Cy5 (1:50, to detect GP1b on platelets) and mouse anti-human CD38:FITC (1:40, to detect monocytes), simultaneously or mouse IgG1:RPE-Cy5 (1:50) and mouse IgG1:FITC (1:40) as the isotype controls for 10 minutes at room temperature (all antibodies from BD Biosciences, San Diego, CA). Similarly, platelet-neutrophil aggregates were detected by simultaneous incubation with mouse anti-human CD42b:RPE-Cy5 and mouse IgM anti-human CD66:FITC (1:40, BD Biosciences, to detect neutrophils), or mouse IgG1:RPE-Cy5 and mouse IgM:FITC (1:40, BD Biosciences) as the antibody controls for 10 minutes at room temperature. Erythrocytes were lysed by incubation with FACSLyse (Dako, Glostrup, Denmark). Samples were stored at 4degreesC and analyzed by flow cytometry within 30 minutes of lysis. Events staining positively for both platelet and monocyte antigens or platelet and neutrophil antigens were considered to represent blood cell aggregates, as assayed by flow cytometry described below.

To demonstrate the activation-dependent integrin receptor GPIIb/IIIa on platelets a three-antibody mixture was separately added to each sample of whole blood: mouse anti-human PAC-1:FITC (1:100, to detect the activated GPIIb/IIIa receptor, Becton Dickinson, San Jose, CA), mouse anti-human CD42b:RPE-Cy5 and mouse anti-human CD38:RPE (1:60, BD Biosciences) or mouse anti-human CD66:RPE (1:50, BD Biosciences). The activation-related antigen CD11b on leukocytes was detected by incubation with a mixture of mouse anti-human CD11b:FITC (1:10, Dako), mouse anti-human CD42b:RPE-Cy5 and mouse anti-human CD38:RPE or mouse anti-human CD66:RPE. Mouse IgG1:FITC (1:10, Dako) and mouse IgM:FITC (1:100, Becton Dickinson) were used as control antibodies for CD11b and PAC-1, respectively.

Binding of Stx2 to platelet-leukocyte aggregates or to free (unbound) platelets, monocytes or neutrophils was assayed in whole blood, incubated with Stx2 (200 pg/mL) for 30 min at 37degreesC and the antibody combinations described above. Erythrocytes were lysed with FACSLyse and cells were washed twice with PBS and incubated with a mouse monoclonal anti-Stx2 IgG1 antibody (11E10, 200 ng/mL, a gift from T.G. Obrig) or mouse IgG1 (Dako) diluted in 0.1% Saponin (Sigma-Aldrich)/PBS for 30 min at room temperature. After washing, the blood cells were incubated with rabbit anti-mouse:RPE F(ab')2 (1:1000, Dako, diluted in 0,1% Saponin/PBS), as the secondary antibody for 30 min at room temperature. Specificity of the secondary antibody was tested by omitting the primary antibody. Stx2 binding was also examined on purified platelets, monocytes and neutrophils and binding was detected in a similar manner. O157LPS binding was detected as previously described [21].

Flow cytometry was performed using a FACSCalibur instrument with CELLQuest software (Becton Dickinson Immunocytometry Systems, San Jose, CA). Forward and side scatter measurements were made with gain settings in linear mode for the analysis of platelet-monocyte or platelet-neutrophil interactions. The monocyte and the neutrophil populations were thus easily distinguished (Figure 1A). A minimum of 2000 monocytes and 5000 neutrophils were acquired for each determination. A three-color analysis was used for simultaneous detection of platelet-leukocyte aggregates and platelet-leukocyte activation. Monocytes and neutrophils were further gated into a CD42b-positive platelet-bound population, gate two, and a CD42b-negative platelet-free population, gate three (FL1 versus FL3, Figure 1B).

(A) The neutrophil and monocyte population were identified in whole blood by their characteristic size and granularity. In the monocyte gate 98% of the cells were positive for the monocyte marker CD38:FITC and 99% of the cells in the neutrophil gate were CD66:FITC positive showing the accuracy of the identification of cells by forward and side scatter. (B) Monocytes or neutrophils in complex with platelets (gate 2), were identified by binding of CD38:FITC or CD66:FITC (FL1) and the platelet specific antibody CD42b:RPE-Cy5 (FL3). Cells in gate 3 represent platelet-free monocytes or neutrophils. (C) Surface bound tissue factor was identified by binding of CD142:RPE and CD38:FITC or CD66:FITC (FL2 vs. FL1). (D) Percentage of positive cells was calculated by subtraction of the negative control antibody.

Determination of surface-bound TF or Stx on platelet-leukocyte aggregates was performed using a three-color analysis procedure for simultaneous detection of platelet-leukocyte aggregates and TF or Stx2 presence on blood cell aggregates. In the platelet-bound leukocyte population (gate two) the FL1 versus FL2 cytograms were used to estimate the percentage of platelet-leukocyte aggregates with bound TF or Stx2 (Figure 1C). Similarly, the FL1 versus FL2 cytograms were used to estimate the percentage of TF or Stx2 in the platelet-free leukocyte population. Unbound platelets were measured with forward and side scatter signals in logarithmic mode. 10 000 events were acquired with a live gate on FSC versus SSC. Results were compared to antibody-matched controls (Figure 1D) and expressed as percentage positive cells or as mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) after subtraction of the control antibodies. Microparticles were defined and detected as previously described [18].

Whole blood was perfused through a modification of a parallel flow chamber [30] surrounded by an incubation hood, adjusting the temperature to 37degreesC. Defined shear rates between 100-340 s-1 and 1000-2000 s-1 were generated with a syringe pump in withdrawal mode (Harvard Apparatus Inc, Holliston, MA). Immediately before perfusion PBS (1:500, PBS:blood), Stx2, O157:H7LPS, O111:B4LPS or a combination of Stx2/O157:H7LPS or Stx2/O111:B4LPS were added to the blood. After 15 minutes perfusion the blood was collected and kept on ice for flow cytometry experiments as described above or centrifuged to platelet-poor-plasma for measurement of TF procoagulant activity.

Incubation of whole blood with Stx2 for 4 h induced a significant increase in platelet-monocyte but not platelet-neutrophil aggregate formation (Figure 2A and 2B) while LPS induced both platelet-monocyte and platelet-neutrophil aggregate formation (Figure 2A and 2B). All LPS serotypes tested (O157:H7, O103:H2, O111:HN, O121:H19 or O111:B4) induced increased aggregate formation, although O157:H7LPS was more potent compared to the other serotypes (Figure 2C and 2D).

(A) Incubation of PBS-treated whole blood at 37degreesC for 4 h induced a slight increase in platelet-monocyte (A) and platelet-neutrophil (B) aggregate formation compared to baseline levels. Baseline levels of platelet-monocyte aggregates were 10% (range 5-17%, 7 experiments) and platelet-neutrophil aggregates 6% (range 2-13%, 7 experiments). Incubation of whole blood with Stx2 and/or O157LPS (0.5 microg/mL) induced predominantly the formation of platelet-monocyte aggregates. (C) Incubation of whole blood with O157LPS (1 microg/mL) at 37degreesC for 4 h induced significantly more aggregate formation between platelets and monocytes in comparison to the other LPS serotypes tested while no significant differences, between LPS serotypes, were observed in platelet-neutrophil (D) aggregate formation.

A significant increase in platelet-monocyte but not platelet-neutrophil aggregate formation was noted when blood cells were co-stimulated with Stx2 and LPS simultaneously, in comparison to Stx2 or LPS alone (Figure 2A and 2B). The results show that both Stx2 and O157LPS induce platelet-monocyte aggregate formation, that co-stimulation with Stx2 and LPS had an additive effect and that O157LPS was a more potent trigger of platelet-leukocyte aggregate formation than other LPS serotypes.

Whole blood incubated with Stx2 exhibited increased monocyte and neutrophil surface expression of CD11b (Figure 3B and 3C), albeit to a lesser extent compared to LPS (O157:H7 or O111:B4). Stx2 stimulation increased CD11b expression in platelet-bound as well as in platelet-free monocytes whereas only a weak increase was detected in neutrophils in complex with platelets and no increase was seen in platelet-free neutrophils (Figure 3C). LPS stimulation increased the intensity of CD11b staining on monocytes and neutrophils in complex with platelets more than visualized on unbound monocytes/neutrophils. Incubation with PBS did not induce increased CD11b surface expression. Thus both Stx2 and O157LPS induced platelet and leukocyte activation which was more notable when cells were in complex.

Directly after blood sampling unstimulated cells in whole blood showed low baseline levels of TF. TF expression was detected on 8% of platelet-monocyte aggregates (range 4-12%, 7 experiments) but not on platelet-neutrophil aggregates or unbound cells (data not shown). Incubation of PBS-treated whole blood at 37degreesC for 4 h increased the population of platelet-monocyte and platelet-neutrophil aggregates with surface-bound TF minimally (Figure 4A). Incubation of whole blood with Stx2 and/or LPS for 4 h induced a significant increase of platelet-monocyte aggregates expressing TF (Figure 4A) compared to PBS-treated samples. LPS induced increased platelet-neutrophil aggregates with surface-bound TF, whereas Stx only had a negligible effect (Figure 4B). TF bound to monocytes and neutrophils in complex with platelets to a greater extent than to platelet-free leukocytes. Incubation of whole blood with a combination of Stx2 and LPS (O157:H7LPS or O111:B4LPS) induced a significant increase in platelet-monocyte aggregates as well as platelet-free monocytes expressing TF compared to Stx2 or LPS alone. A similar, albeit weaker, effect was noted on platelet-bound or platelet-free neutrophils. All LPS serotypes tested showed similar results although O157:H7LPS was slightly more potent (Figure 5A and 5B).

Levels of microparticles generated by incubation of whole blood with Stx2 or LPS were significantly higher compared to PBS-treated blood (Table 1). The highest numbers of microparticles were generated by incubation with LPS. O157:H7LPS generated more microparticles than O111:B4LPS. A significant increase in platelet microparticle generation and numbers of microparticles expressing TF was noted in whole blood co-stimulated with Stx2/LPS compared to each agonist alone (P<0.05). For all agonists tested platelet microparticles constituted the largest proportion of total microparticles followed by microparticles of monocyte origin. Similarly, TF-positive microparticles were considerably more elevated in whole blood incubated with an agonist than in PBS-treated blood.

Results shown above indicated that Stx2 alone did not have as profound effect on platelet-leukocyte aggregate formation, platelet or leukocyte activation and TF-positive microparticle generation as LPS, and since this response was mostly demonstrated in monocytes, we examined the ability of Stx2 to bind to platelets, monocytes and neutrophils. Stx2 was added to whole blood or to isolated platelets, monocytes or neutrophils. The results are summarized in Table 2 and showed that Stx bound mostly to monocytes and platelets, particularly after activation, and that minimal binding to platelet-free neutrophils was detected. There was no binding of Stx2 to platelet-bound neutrophils and no binding was detected when the primary anti-Stx2 antibody was omitted.

Similarly, O111:B4LPS alone or in combination with Stx2 increased platelet-monocyte aggregates. Higher shear rates (1000-2000 s-1) induced more platelet-monocyte aggregate formation in the presence of Stx2 or O157LPS than lower shear rates (Figure 6A). Notably, the combination of Stx2/O157LPS at the lower shear rate increased platelet-monocyte aggregates two-fold in comparison to each agonist alone. Combination of low or high shear and Stx2, O157LPS or both simultaneously induced only a slight increase in platelet-neutrophil aggregates (Figure 6B).

(A) Stx2 and/or LPS induced platelet-monocyte aggregate formation particularly at shear rates between 1000-2000 s-1 (light bars).

Stx2, O157LPS or O111:B4LPS or Stx2/LPS increased the number of platelet-monocyte aggregates with surface-bound TF at both low and high shear rates (Figure 6C). A marked increase in platelet-monocyte aggregates with surface-bound TF was noted in whole blood co-stimulated with Stx2/LPS at higher shear rates. The effect of shear-stress on platelet-neutrophil aggregates expressing TF was minimal (Figure 6D). Thus a most potent additive effect regarding TF-expression was noted on platelet-monocyte aggregates exposed to Stx2/LPS at high shear rates.

Tissue factor expressing microparticles are procoagulant [31]. In this study we demonstrate circulating TF-expressing platelet-leukocyte aggregates and microparticles in blood samples from HUS patients. Platelet-leukocyte aggregate formation was generated in vitro in normal whole blood stimulated with Stx2 and/or O157LPS under shear flow, microparticles were released and TF was demonstrated on platelet or monocyte-derived microparticles after stimulation. EHEC-associated HUS is known to be a prothrombotic condition [32]. This activity is related to Stx and LPS-induced endothelial cell injury [24] as well as a direct interaction between EHEC virulence factors, Stx and LPS, and platelets, leading to platelet activation [21], [27]. Direct contact between EHEC virulence factors and blood cells, as shown here, leads to TF expression, which would thus trigger thrombosis.

Increased levels of circulating platelet-leukocyte aggregates expressing TF have been found in patients with acute coronary syndrome [33] and in an in vivo model of experimental endotoxemia [34]. TF has been found to play a key role in sepsis [13] and infectious endocarditis [35] and procoagulant microparticles expressing TF have been demonstrated in meningococcal sepsis [36] and in thrombotic microangiopathies [18], [37]. This pro-thrombotic pathway, ultimately generating thrombin, is operational during HUS as it has been shown that TF is elevated during HUS [17]. In vitro studies have shown that TF expression is increased in human glomerular endothelial cells stimulated with Stx1 and TNF-alpha and further enhanced by exogenous angiotensin II [38]. Similarly, stimulation of macrophage-like THP-1 cells with Stx1 induces expression of TF [39]. Intravenous injection of C57BL/6 mice with Stx2 and/or LPS has been shown to induce TF expression in the kidneys and increase thrombin generation (detected by levels of thrombin-antithrombin III complex) indicating increased coagulability [40]. The mechanism by which TF elevation in the circulation occurs in HUS has not been previously studied. We therefore added EHEC virulence factors to normal whole blood with and without application of shear stress under flow, in order to study their effect on microparticle generation and TF expression. Both Stx2 and LPS induced platelet-leukocyte aggregate formation, TF expression and microparticle generation. Co-stimulation with Stx2 and LPS resulted in an additive effect with regard to platelet-monocyte aggregate formation and TF expression on these aggregates, particularly when high shear forces were applied. The additive effect of both Stx2 and LPS was also demonstrated regarding microparticle generation, especially platelet-derived microparticles. The physiological relevance of these in vitro findings was confirmed in patient samples in which platelet-leukocyte aggregates and TF-bearing microparticles were demonstrated.

Stx has been previously shown to circulate in HUS patients bound to platelets [21] and neutrophils [41], [42] although the binding of Stx on neutrophils has been questioned [43]. We show that Stx did not bind to resting platelets in vitro (Table 2) but bound to activated platelets. This result confirms previous findings [27], [44]. Stx could also bind to monocytes [45] (resting or activated) but did not bind to neutrophils (resting or activated). Interestingly, experiments using whole blood from HUS patients showed that Stx was bound to leukocyte-platelet aggregates composed either of neutrophils or of monocytes but was also present on neutrophils and monocytes that were not in complex with platelets. The discrepancy between our in vitro results and the results from patient blood samples may be explained by other activation factors present in HUS plasma not accounted for in the in vitro experiments. Thus neutrophils circulating during the acute phase of HUS appear to be able to bind Stx and our results indicate that Stx circulates bound to leukocytes, platelets and blood cell aggregates.

High peripheral blood neutrophil counts at presentation of HUS were previously associated with poor outcome [46]. Neutrophil influx into the renal cortex during HUS has been related to severe prognosis and death [47]. Upon activation, neutrophils may express TF [10], tether to and roll on altered endothelium. Higher neutrophil counts may form more aggregates with platelets leading to more TF release, which may, in part, explain why neutrophilia is associated with a worse prognosis.

O157LPS was a more potent inducer of leukocyte-platelet aggregate formation and TF expression than other LPS serotypes. Previous in vitro studies have shown that LPS can induce leukocyte-platelet aggregate formation and TF expression on leukocytes [48], [49] as well as endothelial cells [50]. Furthermore, TF is elevated during systemic endotoxemia [51]. HUS differs from systemic endotoxemia in that there is no consumption of plasma coagulation factors. O157LPS injected intraperitoneally into mice leads to TLR4-mediated thrombocytopenia [21]. The LPS found in the circulation in EHEC-associated HUS is, however, not free in the circulation [52] but bound to patient platelets [21] as well as neutrophils and monocytes, as shown here. The process by which LPS activates platelets and leukocytes, leading to shedding of TF-bearing microparticles, is enhanced in the presence of high shear, which mimics the high shear forces found in vivo in the glomerular capillaries of the renal cortex. This could explain the formation of microthrombi in this location, where the typical lesions is seen in HUS [19].

LPS binds to platelets through the TLR4/P-selectin complex receptor [21] leading to platelet activation, demonstrated by release of CD40 ligand and P-selectin [21]. P-selectin and CD40 ligand have been shown to be potent mediators of inflammation [53], [54]. Expression of these, and other adhesive ligands, triggers platelet-endothelium and platelet-leukocyte interactions. Platelet activation enables the release of chemoattractants and cytokines, which alter the properties of vascular endothelium, promote recruitment of monocytes and induce synthesis of TF by both platelets and monocytes [53]. Although not addressed in this study, endothelial cell damage will also release TF-rich microparticles [53] as could be expected during Stx-induced endothelial injury. In addition, stimulated platelets shed TF-bearing microparticles from their surface [18], [31] and binding of P- selectin on platelets to PSGL-1 on leukocytes will potentiate the generation and shedding of leukocyte-derived microparticles which also bear TF [53]. Thus multiple sources of microparticle generation and TF expression and release may be active during HUS.

EHEC virulence factors Stx and LPS induce the formation of aggregates between platelets and leukocytes. The effect was additive when whole blood was co-stimulated with both virulence factors and increased under conditions of high shear stress. This process promoted the release of TF-bearing microparticles from activated blood cells. Based on the findings presented in this work we envisage a scenario in which EHEC virulence factors entering the circulation activate platelets and leukocytes. The interaction between these virulence factors and blood cells under shear flow allows blood cell aggregate formation and decryption of TF [48], expression of active TF on cell membranes as well as secretion of TF-rich microparticles. This process will be enhanced by circulating cytokines [55] and by Stx-induced vascular injury releasing endothelial-derived microparticles. Thus microparticles expressing TF will promote thrombogenesis during HUS.
