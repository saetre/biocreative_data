We have determined the sequence of the portion of Simian Virus 40 (SV40) that codes for the major structural protein of the virus. The gene contains 361 codons. Synonym codons for an amino acid are not used randomly. The dinucleotide CG occurs only once and there is 2 to 1 preference for uridylic acid in the third position of codons.
