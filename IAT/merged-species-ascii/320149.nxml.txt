A rat myosin light chain 2 gene was characterized by nucleotide sequence and S1 mapping analyses. It contains seven exons separated by six introns. The corresponding mRNA is predicted to be 654 nucleotides long (excluding polyA sequences), with 5'-nontranslated, coding, and 3'-nontranslated lengths of 56, 510, and 88 nucleotides, respectively. The predicted amino acid sequence is identical to that from rabbit except that the rat sequence lacks one of two Gly residues located at positions 12 and 13 in the rabbit sequence. From the nucleotide sequence, nascent rat myosin light chain 2 is predicted to have Met Ala preceding Pro at the N-terminal end.
