Retinoids are used to treat several types of cancer; however, their effects on liver cancer have not been fully characterized. To investigate the therapeutic potential of retinoids on hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), the present study evaluates the apoptotic effect of a panel of natural and synthetic retinoids in three human HCC cell lines as well as explores the underlying mechanisms.

###begin p 5
Apoptosis was determined by caspase-3 cleavage using western blot, DNA double-strand breaks using TUNEL assay, and phosphatidylserine translocation using flow cytometry analysis. Gene expression of nuclear receptors was assessed by real-time PCR. Transactivation assay and chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) were conducted to evaluate the activation of RXRalpha/RARbeta pathway by fenretinide. Knockdown of RARbeta mRNA expression was achieved by siRNA transfection.

Results
###end title 6
###begin p 7
Our data revealed that fenretinide effectively induces apoptosis in Huh-7 and Hep3B cells. Gene expression analysis of nuclear receptors revealed that the basal and inducibility of retinoic acid receptor beta (RARbeta) expression positively correlate with the susceptibility of HCC cells to fenretinide treatment. Furthermore, fenretinide transactivates the RXRalpha/RARbeta-mediated pathway and directly increases the transcriptional activity of RARbeta. Knockdown of RARbeta mRNA expression significantly impairs fenretinide-induced apoptosis in Huh-7 cells.

Conclusion
###end title 8
###begin p 9
Our findings reveal that endogenous expression of retinoids receptor RARbeta gene determines the susceptibility of HCC cells to fenretinide-induced apoptosis. Our results also demonstrate fenretinide directly activates RARbeta and induces apoptosis in Huh-7 cells in a RARbeta-dependent manner. These findings suggest a novel role of RARbeta as a tumor suppressor by mediating the signals of certain chemotherapeutic agents.

Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), the primary malignancy of the liver, is the third most common cause of cancer-related mortality worldwide [1]. HCC is highly resistant to available chemotherapy, resulting in a 5-year relative survival rate of less than 7% [2]. Thus, discovery of new and effective therapies against HCC is much needed.

Retinoids, the natural and synthetic derivates of vitamin A, has a long history in clinical application in addition to its roles as an essential nutrient. Historically, Egyptians used roasted ox liver, which is rich in vitamin A, to treat night blindness. Nowadays, physicians prescribe drugs containing retinoids to treat dermatological disorders and leukemia. Moreover, data from experimental animal models and preclinical, epidemiological, and clinical studies suggest that retinoids may also have chemopreventive and anticancer effect. The best example of retinoid anticancer effect is the retinoic acid (RA) differentiation therapy for acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) [3]. The use of RA has changed the clinical course of APL from a highly lethal to a curable leukemia, therefore establishing the prototype of retinoid-based therapies and the rationale for the use of retinoids in the treatment and prevention of cancer [4]. In addition, retinoids have been used either alone or in combination with other chemotherapeutic agents to treat other types of cancer and precancerous lesions. The anti-proliferative effect of tamoxifen is synergistically enhanced when used in combination with retinoids [5].

Retinoids also show promising effects in adjuvant therapy for HCC [6]. However, the therapeutic potentials of retinoids against HCC have not been extensively investigated. In the present study, we initiated a comprehensive screening including most commercially available retinoids on three widely used human HCC cell lines for apoptosis induction. Agree with previous studies [7,8], we found that fenretinide (N-[4-hydroxyphenyl] retinamide or 4HPR) induces apoptosis in Hep3B cells. In addition, we found that fenretinide also effectively induces apoptosis in Huh-7 cells. In contrast, HepG2 cells are resistant to fenretinide treatment. To elucidate the mechanisms underlying the observed differential susceptibility, gene expression analysis of twelve nuclear receptor genes were assessed by real-time PCR. Our data strongly suggest that the susceptibility of HCC cells to fenretinide treatment is determined by the basal and the induced expression level of RARbeta. Furthermore, we showed that fenretinide directly activates RARbeta in Huh-7 cells. Finally, the RARbeta-deficient Huh-7 cells exhibited marked reduction of fenretinide-induced apoptosis. Based on these findings, we conclude that, in Huh-7 cells, fenretinide directly activates RARbeta and induces apoptosis in a RARbeta-dependent manner.

The retinoids used in this study are grouped into three categories: (1) carotenoids including beta-carotene, lycopene, and lutein; (2) classic retinoids including all-trans retinol palmitate, retinol acetate, 9-cis retinaldehyde, 13-cis retinol, 13-cis retinaldehyde, 13-cis retinoic acid, and fenretinide; (3) receptor-specific retinoids including all-trans retinoic acid (ligand for RAR), 9-cis retinoic acid (ligand for both RAR and RXR), and TTNPB (4-(E-2-[5,6,7,8-tet-rahydro-5,5,8,8-tetramethyl-2-naphthalenyl]-1-propenyl) benzoic acid) (ligand for RAR). beta-Carotene, lycopene, all-trans retinol palmitate, 9-cis retinaldehyde, 13-cis retinol, fenretinide, all-trans retinoic acid, 9-cis retinoic acid, and TTNPB were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO). Lutein was purchased from US Biological (Swampscott, MA). Retinol acetate and 13-cis retinaldehyde were purchased from Toronto Research Chemicals (North York, Canada). 13-cis retinoic acid was purchased from BIOMOL (Plymouth Meeting, PA). Retinoids were dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) at 10 mM as the stock solution and stored at -80degreesC. Retinoids were diluted with serum-free medium to a 10 muM final concentration immediately before use. The final concentration of DMSO in the culture medium was 0.1% in all treatments. Because retinoids are light sensitive, all retinoid treatments were conducted under dim light.

Cells were lysed with lysis buffer (50 mM Tris.Cl pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 2 mM EDTA, 0.1% SDS, 1% (V/V) NP-40 with protease and phosphatase inhibitors (Pierce, Rockford, IL)). Equal amounts of lysates (50 mug total protein) were run on SDS-PAGE and electroblotted onto PVDF membrane (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA). The membranes were first incubated with PBS supplemented with 0.1% Tween 20 and 5% nonfat dry milk (PBST-milk) for 1 hour at room temperature to block nonspecific binding sites. Immunostaining was performed by incubating the membranes with primary antibodies for caspase-3 (Cell Signaling, Beverly, MA) or beta-actin (Santa Cruz, Santa Cruz, CA) in PBST-milk overnight at 4degreesC. After three washes in PBST, membranes were incubated with the appropriate horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies for 1 hour in PBST-milk followed by three washes. Signal was detected using the ECL system SuperSignal West Pico Chemiluminescent Substrates (Pierce, Rockford, IL).

Several studies have shown that retinoids have anti-proliferation or apoptotic effects in certain cancer cells [4]. To assess the effect of retinoids on HCC cells, we examined cell viability and caspase-3 cleavage induced by individual retinoids in three human HCC cell lines (Figure 1). As an initial screening, 10 muM was used for all the tested retinoids. This dose might be high for certain retinoids, however, besides apoptosis, no obvious cytotoxicity was noted during the 3-day treatment. In Huh-7 cells, nine out of thirteen retinoids decreased cell viability, with fenretinide being the most effective one (79% decrease in cell number compared with DMSO treatment). Fenretinide also induced the strongest caspase-3 cleavage in detached Huh-7 cells and 9-cis retinoic acid caused a modest induction (Figure 1A). In HepG2 cells, although all retinoids examined significantly decreased cell viability, only 9-cis retinoic acid induced weak caspase-3 cleavage (Figure 1B). In Hep3B cells, six out of thirteen retinoids decreased cell viability, whereas another three retinoids increased cell number (Figure 1C). 9-cis retinoic acid, fenretinide, TTNPB, and lutein induced strong caspase-3 cleavage in Hep3B cells (Figure 1C). These findings indicate that fenretinide induces apoptosis in both Huh-7 and Hep3B cells, but not in HepG2 cells.

To further confirm the differential responses of Huh-7 and HepG2 cells to fenretinide, both cell lines were treated with fenretinide and assessed for caspase-3 cleavage, DNA double-strand breaks, and phosphatidylserine translocation in a time course study. In Huh-7 cells, caspase-3 cleavage was detected at as early as 24 hours after treatment, and the induction was sustained at 48 and 72 hours. In HepG2 cells, however, even after 72 hours treatment, no obvious caspase-3 cleavage was detected (Figure 2A). DNA double-strand breaks, another hallmark of apoptosis, assessed by the TUNEL assay, were detected in Huh-7 cells after treatment (Figure 2B). In contrast, no significant increase in DNA double-strand breaks was detected in HepG2 cells after treatment (Figure 2B). Some background TUNEL staining was detected in HepG2 cells possibly due to the endogenous peroxidase activity. In addition, during apoptosis, membrane lipid phosphatidylserine translocates from the inner leaflet of the plasma membrane to the outer leaflet, resulting in loss of cell membrane asymmetry. Fenretinide induced phosphatidylserine translocation in Huh-7 cells in a time-dependent manner, reaching 17-fold after 72 hours (Figure 3A). However, fenretinide failed to induce such changes in HepG2 cells even after a 3-day treatment (Figure 3B). Taken together, these findings convincingly demonstrate that Huh-7 cells are susceptible to fenretinide-induced apoptosis, but HepG2 cells are resistant.

To determine whether nuclear receptors mediate the apoptotic effect of fenretinide in HCC cells, the basal mRNA levels of twelve nuclear receptors were assessed by real-time PCR (Figure 4A). Among the three cell lines, Huh-7 cells have the highest basal mRNA levels of RARbeta, RXRalpha, and an orphan nuclear receptor Nurr1 (also known as NR4A2). Hep3B cells have the second highest mRNA levels of RARbeta and Nurr1. In contrast, in HepG2 cells, the basal mRNA level of RARbeta is undetectable. On the other hand, in HepG2 cells, the basal mRNA levels of SXR (steroid and xenobiotic receptor) and CAR (constitutive androstane receptor), two xenobiotic sensors that mediate many xenobiotic responses, are the highest among the three cell clines.

The regulation of these twelve nuclear receptor genes by fenretinide were then evaluated in Huh-7 and HepG2 cells by real-time PCR. The induction fold was calculated by comparing the mRNA level of each nuclear receptor gene between DMSO and fenretinide treatment at each time point. Only those genes that showed marked changes in expression were presented. In Huh-7 cells, fenretinide caused a continuous induction of RARbeta mRNA level (Figure 4B). After 48 hours of treatment, mRNA levels of RARalpha and gamma were also highly induced in Huh-7 cells (Figure 4B). In contrast, a 9-fold induction of RARbeta was detected 6 hours after fenretinide treatment in HepG2 cells, and then the induction dropped down to 3-5 fold later on. NOR1 (NR4A3) mRNA was induced 6-fold after 48 hours treatment in HepG2 cells (Figure 4C). Furthermore, by comparing the RARbeta mRNA level between Huh-7 and HepG2 cells after fenretinide treatment, our data revealed a dramatic difference in RARbeta mRNA level between these two cell lines (Figure 4D). Taken together, these data clearly depict a positive correlation between RARbeta mRNA level and susceptibility to fenretinide-induced apoptosis, which suggests that RARbeta may play an important role in mediating fenretinide-induced apoptosis in HCC cells.

It is known that RARbeta induces it own expression upon stimulation by RAR ligands [10]. Since fenretinide is a synthetic retinoid whether it can directly activate RARbeta remains to be tested. So we examined whether fenretinide activates RARbeta. We first tested whether fenretinide can activate the RXRalpha/RARbeta-mediated pathway by transactivation assay (Figure 5). Fenretinide caused a marked induction of luciferase activity in Huh-7 cells (43-fold) and in CV-1 cells (13-fold) (Figure 5A and 5B). In contrast, fenretinide did not significantly increase luciferase activity in HepG2 cells (Figure 5C). These data indicate that fenretinide can transactivate RXRalpha/RARbeta-mediated pathway in Huh-7 but not in HepG2 cells. As shown in Figure 4C, a modest induction of RARbeta mRNA was seen in HepG2 cells 6 hours after fenretinide treatment, but no sustained induction at 48 hours. Consistently, no significant increase in luciferase activity, which was measured 48 hours after fenretinide treatment, was detected in HepG2 cells.

Fenretinide transactivates RXRalpha/RARbeta-mediated pathway in Huh-7, CV-1 cells, but not in HepG2 cells. Huh-7 (A), CV-1 (B), and HepG2 (C) cells were transfected with a luciferase reporter harboring RARE (DR-5) and expression plasmids for RXRalpha and RARbeta. Firefly luciferase activity was normalized by co-transfected Renilla luciferase activity. The histograms depict the relative fold of normalized luciferase reporter activity between fenretinide treatment and DMSO treatment. Data from triplicates were presented as mean +/- S.E.M.

The most direct evidence of RARbeta activation is the increased binding of RARbeta to the response elements in retinoid target genes. It is known that RARbeta binds to the RARE in its own promoter upon RA treatment [10,11]. One of the classic RAREs, a 5-bp spaced direct repeat (DR5), was found in the promoter of RARbeta [10]. Another well established retinoid target gene is cytochrome P450 26A1 (CYP26A1), an enzyme that catalyzes the breakdown of retinoic acid to more polar metabolites [10]. Two RAREs have been found in the promoter of CYP26A1, one in the proximal region and the other in the distal region [12]. Using chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay, the direct binding of RARbeta to the RAREs in RARbeta and CYP26A1 upon fenretinide treatment was revealed. Fenretinide increased the binding (14-fold) of RARbeta to its own promoter compared with DMSO treatment (Figure 6A). An even higher increase (27-fold) of RARbeta binding to the CYP26A1 promoter was also noted (Figure 6B). Together, these results demonstrate that fenretinide directly activates RARbeta.

To determine the role of RARbeta in mediating fenretinide-induced apoptosis, the endogenous RARbeta mRNA expression in Huh-7 cells was knocked down using siRNA. The knockdown efficiency of RARbeta by three sequence-independent siRNA oligonucleotides was evaluated by real-time PCR. Three siRNAs silenced RARbeta gene expression to different extents, the most efficient knockdown being 86% (siRNA #4124) compared with scramble siRNA, followed by 81% (siRNA #3935) and 68% (siRNA #4030) (Figure 7A). The apoptotic effect of fenretinide was then evaluated in these RARbeta-deficient cells. Our results showed that DNA double-strand breaks induced by fenretinide were markedly reduced in RARbeta-deficient Huh-7 cells (Figure 7B). Consistent with RARbeta knockdown level, the greatest reduction of apoptosis (88.6%) was seen in the cells with the lowest endogenous RARbeta mRNA level (cells transfected by siRNA #4124 with 86% knockdown of RARbeta mRNA), followed by 83.1% in cells transfected by siRNA # 3935 with 81% knockdown of RARbeta mRNA, and 70.7% in cells transfected by siRNA # 4030 with 68% knockdown of RARbeta mRNA. These data clearly demonstrate that fenretinide-induced apoptosis of Huh-7 cells is RARbeta dependent.

RARbeta knockdown by siRNA diminished fenretinide-induced apoptosis. (A) Establishment of RARbeta-deficient Huh-7 cells. Silencing of RARbeta was achieved by transfecting Huh-7 cells with individual pre-designed RARbeta siRNAs (#3935, #4030, and #4124) or scramble siRNA as the negative control. The knockdown efficiency of RARbeta (i.e. RARbeta mRNA level reduction) by each siRNA was presented as the percentage of RARbeta mRNA level in scramble siRNA-transfected cells 48 hours post-transfection. (B) Scramble or RARbeta siRNA transfected Huh-7 cells were treated with either DMSO or fenretinide for 24 hours followed by TUNEL assay. TUNEL staining was representative result from two independent experiments. The histograms depict the relative fold of TUNEL positive cells between fenretinide and DMSO treatment in individual siRNA transfected Huh-7 cells. TUNEL positive cell counting was presented as mean +/- S.E.M. from four independent countings (* p < 0.05, compared with DMSO treatment of scramble siRNA-transfected Huh-7 cells; # p < 0.05, compared with fenretinide treatment of scramble siRNA-transfected Huh-7 cells).

Retinoids have emerged as important signaling molecules in the regulation of cellular homeostasis. During the past decade, the knowledge on the mechanisms of retinoids action has been greatly expanded due to the discovery and characterization of retinoid receptors and the consensus RAREs in retinoid target genes [13]. Retinoid receptors are ligand-dependent transcription factors that regulate expression of retinoid target genes upon activation [10]. One retinoid receptor, RARbeta, has been speculated as a tumor suppressor in several studies. Decreased RARbeta expression was found in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma [14], premalignant oral lesions [15], and esophageal squamous cell carcinoma [16]. Suppression of RARbeta causes resistance to retinoic acid-associated growth arrest in breast and prostate cancer cells [17] and in F9 teratocarcinoma cells [18]. Induced RARbeta expression sensitizes non-small cell lung cancer cells and colorectal cancer cells to the anticancer effects of retinoids [19]. However, how RARbeta exerts its role as a tumor suppressor is largely unknown.

In the present study, we identified fenretinide from a panel of retinoids and carotenoids as the most effective one in inducing apoptosis in HCC cells. We further identified RARbeta as the key nuclear receptor in mediating the effect of fenretinide. Moreover, evidence from this study clearly demonstrates that fenretinide directly activates RARbeta and that RARbeta is required for fenretinide-induced apoptosis in Huh-7 cells. Thus, the novel finding of the current study is the identification of a positive correlation between RARbeta expression and the susceptibility of HCC cells to fenretinide. This finding suggests a role of RARbeta in determining the sensitivity of HCC cells to certain chemotherapeutic agents, which may also hold true for other types of tumor cells.

In fenretinide-resistant HepG2 cells, not only the basal RARbeta mRNA level was low, but also the induction of RARbeta mRNA by fenretinide was modest and discontinuous. It was known that the promoter of the RARbeta gene is frequently hypermethylated in acute myeloid leukemia and cholangiocarcinoma [20,21]. Using DNA methyltransferase inhibitor, the basal RARbeta mRNA level in HepG2 cells did not increase (unpublished data) suggesting promoter methylation might not account for the suppressed RARbeta mRNA expression in HepG2 cells.

Similar to the expression pattern of RARbeta mRNA in HCC cells, the basal expression of Nurr1 is much higher in Huh-7 than in HepG2 cells suggesting Nurr1 might also contribute to the observed differential susceptibility. The basal expression level of Nur77 in Huh-7 and HepG2 cells also correlates with the sensitivity of the cell line to fenretinide-induced apoptosis. Nur77 was shown to enhance RARE activity in transactivation assay [22]. Furthermore, recently studies suggest that Nur77 translocates to mitochondria and interacts with Bcl-2 to promote apoptosis [23,24]. Therefore, the role of Nur77 in fenretinide-induced apoptosis warrants further investigation.

Another major difference regarding the nuclear receptor basal expression pattern is that HepG2 cells express higher basal levels of CAR and SXR mRNA than Huh-7 cells. It is known that activation of CAR or constitutive activation of SXR induces hepatomegaly in mice [25-27]. Whether the high levels of CAR and SXR contribute to the resistance of HepG2 cells to fenretinide-induced apoptosis should be investigated.

Fenretinide seems to be a rather stable compound. Pharmacokinetics studies have shown that fenretinide has a much longer elimination half-life than all-trans and 13-cis retinoic acid [28]. In another study, the tissue concentration of fenretinide and its main metabolite N-(4-methoxyphenyl) retinamide (4-MPR) were determined after a 3-day treatment by HPLC [29]. The data showed that the concentration of fenretinide was 5-fold higher than that of 4-MPR in various mouse tissues including liver. So it is unlikely that the observed apoptotic effect is mediated through fenretinide metabolites. In addition, in the present study, we used cell culture, in which the metabolism rate might not be as efficient as in the liver. To avoid accumulation of the metabolites of fenretinide during treatment, fresh retinoids were provided every 24 hours. So it is highly likely that the observed apoptotic effect was caused by the parent compound rather than the metabolites of fenretinide.

During fenretinide treatment, the other two RARs, RARalpha and gamma, were highly induced after 48 hours (25-fold and 17-fold, respectively) in Huh-7 cells implicating the involvement of these two RARs at the late stage of apoptosis in Huh-7 cells. As some studies have shown, RARalpha and RARgamma may be involved in apoptosis induction in immortalized keratinocytes and leukemia cells [30,31]. In HepG2 cells, however, NOR1 (also known as NR4A3), was induced 6-fold after 48 hours. This induction may contribute to the resistance of HepG2 cells to fenretinide as NOR1 has been suggested to have pro-survival functions in some cell types [32].

Another novel finding is the direct activation of RARbeta by fenretinide. It has been shown that fenretinide induces apoptosis in many types of cancer cells including neuroblastoma cells, breast, lung, head and neck, cervical and ovarian cancer cells [8,33,34]. However, the underlying mechanisms are poorly understood. Some studies suggest that the effects of fenretinide are mediated through reactive oxygen species (ROS) and caspase-3 [35], whereas other studies indicate the involvement of ceramide [36] and the NF-kappaB pathway [37]. Both retinoid receptor dependent and independent mechanisms have been proposed for fenretinide anticancer effects [34]. Our results obtained from transactivation assay and ChIP assay clearly demonstrate that fenretinide directly activates RARbeta in Huh-7 cells. Knockdown of RARbeta mRNA expression by siRNA provides a direct proof that RARbeta is required for fenretinide-induced apoptosis. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to report that nuclear receptor RARbeta mediates the apoptotic effect of fenretinide in HCC cells. Our findings strongly suggest a potential role of RARbeta as a tumor suppressor by mediating the signals of certain chemotherapeutic agents. However, there are still unbridged gaps between RARbeta activation and apoptosis execution. Exploration of RARbeta target genes will provide helpful insights into these molecular links.

Conclusion
###end title 67
###begin p 68
Our findings reveal that endogenous expression of retinoids receptor RARbeta gene determines the susceptibility of HCC cells to fenretinide-induced apoptosis. Our results demonstrate fenretinide directly activates RARbeta and induces RARbeta-dependent apoptosis in Huh-7 cells. These findings suggest a novel role of RARbeta as a tumor suppressor by mediating the signals of certain chemotherapeutic agents.
