Part of the replication origin-containing A+T-rich region of the Drosophila yakuba mtDNA molecule and segments on either side of this region have been sequenced, and the genes within them identified. The data confirm that the small and large rRNA genes lie in tandem adjacent to that side of the A+T-rich region which is replicated first, and establish that a tRNAval gene lies between the two rRNA genes and that URF1 follows the large rRNA gene. The data further establish that the genes for tRNAile, tRNAgln, tRNAf-met and URF2 lie in the order given, on the opposite side of the A+T-rich region to the rRNA genes and, except for tRNAgln, are contained in the opposite strand to the rRNA, tRNAval and URF1 genes. This is in contrast to mammalian mtDNAs where all of these genes are located on the side of the replication origin which is replicated last, within the order tRNAphe, small (12S) rRNA, tRNAval, large (16S) rRNA, tRNAleu, URF1, tRNAile, tRNAgln, tRNAf-met and URF2, and, except tRNAgln, are all contained in the same (H) strand. In D. yakuba URF1 and URF2, the triplet AGA appears to specify an amino acid, which is again different from the situation found in mammalian mtDNAs, where AGA is used only as a rare termination codon.
