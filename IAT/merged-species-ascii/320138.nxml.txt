As a first step in our studies of functionally rearranged K genes of man we cloned the germline JK-CK region from placenta DNA employing a mouse JK clone as hybridization probe. Subclones of the human JK-CK region were then used to characterize and clone the rearranged K genes of the lymphoid cell lines Walker and Daudi. The Walker cell line contains one rearranged and one germline K allele (K+,KO; ref. 1). Only one K gene was found in Daudi cells (K+). Restriction mapping and DNA sequencing showed, that the rearranged K genes from both cell lines are closely related. These features make the two cell lines particularly suitable for studies on the chromatin structure of K light chain genes. The 5' flanks of the two genes (388 bp) are identical while there is a 12% divergence between the VK gene segments themselves. This situation may reflect somatic mutation processes and/or gene conversion like events.
