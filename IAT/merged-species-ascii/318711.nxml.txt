We present the complete sequence of an mRNA which is induced by estrogen in the human breast cancer cell line MCF-7 [pS2 mRNA, Masiakowski et al., Nucleic Acids Res. 10, 7895-7903 (1982)]. Primer extension and cloning of double-stranded cDNA (ds-cDNA) into a vector designed to make full-length cDNA were used to determine the sequence of the fifteen 5'-terminal nucleotides which were not present in the original pS2 ds-cDNA clone. The mRNA sequence has a major open reading frame encoding 84 amino-acids, flanked by a 40 nucleotide 5'-untranslated region and a 198 nucleotide 3'-untranslated region preceding the polyA tail. The 3'-untranslated region contains a polyadenylation signal, AUUAAA, 14 nucleotides upstream from the polyA tail. The derived protein sequence contains a putative signal peptide region suggesting that the protein may be secreted. The nucleotide and derived amino-acid sequences were compared to previously determined sequences, particularly to those of hormone-regulated proteins and growth factors, and no obvious similarities were observed.
