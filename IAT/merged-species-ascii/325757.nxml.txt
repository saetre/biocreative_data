The mammalian cell antigen reactive with the autoantibody anti-Jo-1 has been shown to contain tRNAHis. The RNA sequence of this human and mouse cell tRNA was determined in a search for unusual features that might be related to antigenicity. The 5' terminal nucleotide is unique among other sequenced tRNAs in that it is a methylated guanine. The presence of the hypermodified base queuine, which occurs in the wobble position of the anticodon of tRNAHis from several species, was not detected in the tRNAHis immunoprecipitated by anti-Jo-1 from either human HeLa or mouse Friend erytholeukemia cell extracts. The binding of protein(s) appears to confer antigenicity on tRNAHis since either proteinase K treatment or phenol extraction resulted in the loss of immunoprecipitability. However, we have not succeeded in identifying an antigenic protein, and we find that the antigenic complex is not resolved from purified tRNAHis by Sephacryl S-200 column chromatography. Immunofluorescence studies indicate that the antigenic form of tRNAHis is located preferentially in the mammalian cell cytoplasm. The results presented here are discussed in light of an earlier report (1) on the nature of the Jo-1 antigen.
