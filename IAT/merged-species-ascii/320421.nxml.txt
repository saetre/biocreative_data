We have determined the sequence of the spinach (Spinacia oleracea) chloroplast genes for the photosystem II proteins, D2 and the 44 kd reaction-centre, chlorophyll a-binding protein, and for tRNASer (UGA). The 3' end of the D2 gene overlaps the first 50 bp of the 5' end of the gene for the 44 kd protein. Northern RNA hybridization analysis indicates the two genes are cotranscribed into a single 3.5 kb RNA. The predicted molecular weight of the 353-residue D2 protein is 39536 and that of the 473-residue 44 kd protein is 51816. Both proteins are hydrophobic containing at least five possible membrane-spanning domains. D2 shows significant homology to the 32 kd herbicide-binding protein (Zurawski et al., (1982) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 79, 7699-7703), and parts of the 44 kd protein show obvious similarities to parts of the 51 kd reaction-centre, chlorophyll a-binding protein of photosystem II (Morris and Herrmann (1984) Nucleic Acids Res. 12, 2837-2850). The gene for tRNASer (UGA) which is on the opposite strand to and transcribed towards the photosystem II genes is 72% homologous with the corresponding Escherichia coli tRNASer.
