Werner syndrome (WS) is a severe recessive disorder characterized by premature aging, cancer predisposition and genomic instability. The gene mutated in WS encodes a bi-functional enzyme called WRN that acts as a RecQ-type DNA helicase and a 3'-5' exonuclease, but its exact role in DNA metabolism is poorly understood. Here we show that WRN physically interacts with the MSH2/MSH6 (MutSalpha), MSH2/MSH3 (MutSbeta) and MLH1/PMS2 (MutLalpha) heterodimers that are involved in the initiation of mismatch repair (MMR) and the rejection of homeologous recombination. MutSalpha and MutSbeta can strongly stimulate the helicase activity of WRN specifically on forked DNA structures with a 3'-single-stranded arm. The stimulatory effect of MutSalpha on WRN-mediated unwinding is enhanced by a G/T mismatch in the DNA duplex ahead of the fork. The MutLalpha protein known to bind to the MutS alpha-heteroduplex complexes has no effect on WRN-mediated DNA unwinding stimulated by MutSalpha, nor does it affect DNA unwinding by WRN alone. Our data are consistent with results of genetic experiments in yeast suggesting that MMR factors act in conjunction with a RecQ-type helicase to reject recombination between divergent sequences.

Werner syndrome (WS) is an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by an early onset of age-related pathologies including graying hair, alopecia, arteriosclerosis, osteoporosis, diabetes mellitus and cancer (1). The gene mutated in WS, WRN, encodes a RecQ-type DNA helicase (2,3). WRN also possesses a 3' - 5' exonuclease activity residing in a separate domain located at the N-terminus of the protein (4,5). At the cellular level, WRN deficiency is associated with defects in DNA replication, homologous recombination (HR) and telomere maintenance (6-9). As a result, cells derived from WS patients display a high degree of genomic instability including elevated levels of chromosomal translocations and deletions (10-13). WS cells are hypersensitive to DNA-damaging agents such as 4-nitroquinoline 1-oxide, topoisomerase inhibitors and DNA cross-linkers, suggesting that WRN is actively involved in DNA repair (14-16). Several lines of evidence implicate WRN in the cellular response to DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs). WRN is rapidly recruited to the sites of ionizing radiation (IR)-induced damage (17). Moreover, it interacts physically and functionally with a number of proteins that are involved in the DSB-repair process including the MRE11-RAD50-NBS1 (MRN) complex (18), the Ku complex (19), RAD52 (20) and DNA-dependent protein kinase (21). However, the precise role for WRN in DNA repair remains to be elucidated.

The DNA mismatch-repair (MMR) system maintains genomic integrity by correcting DNA replication errors and preventing recombination between divergent sequences (22,23). Defects in a subset of MMR genes including MSH2, MSH3, MSH6, MLH1 and PMS2 are associated with hereditary non-polyposis colon cancer, highlighting the crucial role for MMR in genome maintenance (24). In the initiation step of the eukaryotic MMR process, at least three heterodimers, namely MSH2/MSH6 (MutSalpha), MSH2/MSH3 (MutSbeta) and MLH1/PMS2 (MutLalpha), are involved (22). MutSalpha binds to base-base mismatches and short insertion/deletion loops, while MutSbeta can recognize only insertion/deletion loops containing up to 16 extra nucleotides in one strand (22). MutLalpha possesses an intrinsic endonuclease activity, which is activated upon mismatch recognition and introduces incisions in the discontinuous strand of the heteroduplex DNA, generating entry sites for the 5'-3' exonuclease EXO1 (25).

Sgs1, the yeast ortholog of WRN, also contributes to the suppression of recombination between divergent DNA sequences (26). Heteroduplex rejection during repair of DSBs by the single-strand annealing pathway of HR in yeast requires the mismatch binding and ATPase functions of the Msh2p/Msh6p heterodimer and the helicase activity of Sgs1 (27,28). These findings led to the proposal that MMR proteins act in conjunction with Sgs1 to unwind DNA recombination intermediates containing mismatches (27,28).

Here we demonstrate that WRN directly interacts with MutSalpha, MutSbeta and MutLalpha via distinct domains. MutSalpha and MutSbeta are found to stimulate WRN-mediated unwinding of forked DNA duplexes with a 3'-single-stranded (ss) arm. The stimulatory effect of MutSalpha on WRN-mediated unwinding is enhanced by a single G/T mismatch located in the duplex ahead of the fork in a manner independent of MutLalpha. These data provide biochemical evidence suggesting that the rejection of homeologous recombination by MMR proteins occurs via helicase-mediated unwinding of recombination intermediates.

The bacterial expression vectors for the WRN fragments encompassing the amino acid residues 51-449, 949-1432, 500-946, 500-1149, 500-1236, respectively, fused to the C-terminus of glutathione S-transferase (GST) were constructed by PCR amplification of corresponding regions of the WRN cDNA and their insertion in pGEX-2TK (Amersham Biosciences) between the EcoRI and BamHI sites. The complete coding region of WRN was amplified by PCR and cloned in pACT2 (Clontech Palo Alto, CA) via SmaI site to construct a yeast two-hybrid (YTH) vector expressing WRN as a fusion with a Gal4 activation domain. MLH1 cDNA comprised of the codons 500-756 was cloned in a YTH vector pBTM116 (Clontech Palo Alto, CA) between the EcoRI and SalI sites, resulting in a fusion with a LexA DNA binding domain. The pBTM16 derivatives expressing other MLH1 variants as well as the full-length yMlh1 were previously described (29). The Gal4-hMSH2 (pLJR105), LexA-MSH3 and LexA-MSH6 bait plasmids were also described previously (30,31).

Cells were suspended in lysis buffer containing 20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 150 mM NaCl, 2 mM EDTA, 0.1% (v/v) Triton X-100, 10% (v/v) glycerol and complete, EDTA-free protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche). After sonication, the suspension was centrifuged at 20 000 g for 30 min at 4degreesC. Aliquots containing 1.6 mg of protein were incubated overnight at 4degreesC with purified rabbit polyclonal anti-WRN IgGs (2 mug), which was followed by a 2-h incubation with protein A/G-agarose beads (Santa Cruz) at 4degreesC. Where required, extracts were treated with 50 U of DNaseI (Roche) for 30 min at 25degreesC prior to addition of antibody. After extensive washing with the lysis buffer, the immunoprecipitates were subjected to electrophoresis in a 7.5% polyacrylamide-SDS gel followed by western blotting. The blots were probed with mouse monoclonal antibodies against WRN (BD Biosciences, 611169), MSH6 (Pharmingen, clone 44), PMS2 (Pharmingen, clone 16-4), MLH1 (BD Biosciences, 554073), MSH2 (Calbiochem, clone NA 26) and MSH3 (Transduction Laboratories, clone 52). Immune complexes were detected using ECL-plus reagent (Amersham Biosciences), with horse anti-mouse IgG-horseradish peroxidase conjugate (Vector) used as a secondary antibody. In the control experiment, IgGs purified from a preimmune rabbit serum were used instead of the anti-WRN antibody.

GST-WRN fusion proteins were produced in the E. coli BL21-CodonPlus(DE3)-RIL strain (Stratagene) using the expression vectors described above. The fusion proteins were bound to glutathione-sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences) as previously described (36). The beads were incubated with 1 mug of purified MutSalpha, MutSbeta or MutLalpha in 400 mul of NET-N 100 buffer [10 mM Tris HCl (pH 8.0), 1 mM EDTA, 100 mM NaCl, 0.5% (v/v) NP-40] for 2 h at 4degreesC. After extensive washing with NET-N 100 buffer, proteins bound to the beads were analyzed by western blotting. Membranes were probed with the monoclonal antibodies described above. MSH3 was detected with a rabbit polyclonal antibody (NTH3) raised against its first 200 amino acids (Eurogentec). In a control experiment, beads were coated with GST protein only.

Purified recombinant WRN was diluted to a concentration of 20 nM in carbonate buffer [16 mM Na2CO3, 34 mM NaHCO3 (pH 9.6)] and added to wells of a 96-well microtiter plate (50 microl/well). Plates were incubated overnight at 4degreesC. For control reactions, wells were pre-coated with an equivalent amount of bovine serum albumin (BSA). After aspiration of the samples, the wells were blocked with blocking buffer [phosphate-buffered saline, 0.5% (v/v) Tween-20 and 3% (w/v) BSA] for 2 h at 37degreesC (200 microl/well). Following blockage, the wells were incubated with increasing concentrations of purified recombinant MutSalpha, MutSbeta and MutLalpha proteins for 1 h at 37degreesC. All samples were supplemented with ethidium bromide (EtBr) at a concentration of 50 microg/ml to prevent DNA-mediated interactions. Wells were washed four times with blocking buffer to eliminate unbound proteins, and incubated with the appropriate primary antibody diluted in blocking buffer (mouse monoclonal anti-MSH2 antibody for MutSalpha and MutSbeta, and mouse monoclonal anti-MLH1 antibody for MutLalpha). Plates were incubated for 1 h at 37degreesC. After four washings with blocking buffer, horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse secondary antibody (1:10 000 in blocking buffer) was added and the plates were incubated at 37degreesC for 30 min. After extensive washing with blocking buffer, the protein complexes were detected using o-Phenylenediamine dichloride (Sigma) dissolved in 0.1 M citrate-phosphate buffer (pH 5.0) containing 0.03% hydrogen peroxide (1 mg/ml). The reactions were terminated after 5 min by adding 50 mul of 2 M H2SO4. The plates were scanned in a microplate reader (Molecular Devices) for absorbance at 492 nm. The A492 values, corrected for background signal in the presence of BSA, were plotted as a function of the concentration of appropriate MMR protein using the GraphPad Prism software. To determine an apparent dissociation constant of each complex (Kd), the data points were fitted by the hyperbolic function Y = Bmax*X/(Kd + X) where Bmax is the maximal binding and Kd is the concentration of ligand required to reach half-maximal binding.

Schemes of DNA substrates as well as the sequences of the constituent oligonucleotides are summarized in Supplementary Table 1. The f11-20 oligonucleotide (50-mer) was labeled at the 5'-end using T4 polynucleotide kinase (NEB) and [gamma-32P]ATP (Amersham Biosciences), and annealed with appropriate oligonucleotides under previously described conditions (38). The helicase reaction mixtures (10 mul) contained 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 50 mM NaCl, 2 mM MgCl2, 50 mug/ml of BSA, 2 mM ATP, 1 mM DTT, 1 nM DNA substrate and indicated concentrations of MMR proteins (MutSalpha, MutSbeta, MutLalpha and MutS) and WRN. The MMR proteins were pre-incubated with the DNA substrate on ice for 1 min prior to the addition of WRN. The reactions were incubated at 37degreesC for 30 min and terminated by the addition of 0.5 reaction volume of buffer S [150 mM EDTA, 2% (w/v) SDS, 30% (v/v) glycerol, 0.1% (w/v) bromophenol blue] followed by treatment with proteinase K (0.1 mg/ml) at 37degreesC for 10 min. The reaction products were resolved on a non-denaturing 10% polyacrylamide gel [acrylamide to bis-acrylamide, 19:1 (w/w)] run in 1xTBE buffer at 140 V. Radiolabeled DNA species were visualized by a phosphorimager and quantified using ImageQuant software (Molecular Dynamics).

Based on genetic studies in yeast, it has been suggested that the proteins involved in the initiation of MMR act in conjunction with RecQ DNA helicases to eliminate DNA recombination intermediates containing mismatches, which can give rise to chromosomal rearrangements (27,28). We sought to test the validity of this model biochemically using the WRN helicase, one of the five RecQ homologs identified in human cells, whose dysfunction results in chromosomal translocations and deletions. First, we performed an ELISA-based protein-binding assay to investigate whether WRN and the MMR proteins interact physically. Increasing concentrations of purified MutSalpha (MSH2/MSH6), MutSbeta (MSH2/MSH3) and MutLalpha (MLH1/PMS2) proteins (Figure 1A) ranging from 0 to 80 nM were incubated in wells that had been pre-coated with WRN at a concentration of 20 nM and subsequently blocked with BSA to prevent non-specific interactions. After extensive washing, the bound MMR proteins were incubated with specific antibodies followed by a colorimetric assay to quantify the binding. In control experiments, MMR proteins were incubated in wells pre-coated only with BSA. We found that all the three MMR heterodimers were specifically bound to WRN-coated wells in a dose dependent manner, indicating a direct interaction (Figure 1B-D). Interestingly, the apparent dissociation constant of the MutSbeta-WRN complex (Kd = 8.8 nM) was much lower than that estimated for the MutSalpha-WRN complex (Kd = 38.5 nM). The dissociation constant of the MutLalpha-WRN complex (Kd = 34.9 nM) was similar to that of the MutSalpha-WRN complex. Figure 1.Direct physical interaction of WRN with MMR proteins. (A) SDS-PAGE analysis of purified recombinant MutSalpha, MutSbeta, MutLalpha and WRN proteins produced in insect cells by means of the baculovirus system. (B) Binding of MutSalpha to WRN as a function of MutSalpha concentration. (C) Binding of MutSbeta to WRN as a function of MutSbeta concentration. (D) Binding of MutLalpha to WRN as a function of MutLalpha concentration. Increasing concentrations of MutSalpha, MutSbeta and MutLalpha (0-80 nM) were incubated at 37degreesC for 1 h in the wells of an ELISA plate that were pre-coated with the WRN protein (20 nM) and subsequently blocked with 3% BSA. After extensive washing, the bound MMR proteins were detected by ELISA as described in Materials and Methods. The measured absorbance values were corrected by subtracting background values obtained with BSA-coated wells. The data points represent the mean of three independent experiments.

To test whether WRN and MMR proteins form a stable complex in vivo, we immunoprecipitated WRN from extracts of exponentially growing human embryonic kidney cells (HEK 293) and subjected the resulting immunoprecipitate to western blot analysis. This immunoprecipitate was found to contain the MLH1 and PMS2 proteins, components of the MutLalpha complex, but not the MSH2 and MSH6 proteins, which form the MutSalpha heterodimer (Figure 2A, lanes 3 and 4). None of these MMR proteins were detected in the immunoprecipitate obtained with control IgGs (Figure 2A, lane 2). To exclude the possibility that the observed association of WRN with MLH1 and PMS2 results from independent binding of these proteins to DNA, we pre-treated the cell extracts with DNaseI. We found that this treatment did not alter the level of the MMR proteins in the WRN immunoprecipitate, suggesting that the WRN-MLH1-PMS2 complex is mediated by protein-protein interactions (Figure 2A, compare lanes 3 and 4). Furthermore, we did not detect PMS2 in an immunoprecipitate obtained with anti-WRN antibody from extracts of the WS cell line AG11395, excluding the possibility that the observed co-immunoprecipitation of MMR proteins with WRN is due to cross-reactivity of the antibody (Figure 2B). Figure 2.WRN forms a stable complex with MLH1 and PMS2 in human cells.

To identify the MutSalpha, MutSbeta and MutLalpha-interaction sites on WRN, we performed affinity pull-down assays using a series of WRN fragments fused to GST. These fragments covered the entire WRN polypeptide except for the first 50 amino acids and the region spanning the amino acids 450-499 (Figure 3A and B). The GST pull-down experiments revealed that the MutSalpha interaction site on WRN was localized to the region between amino acids 500 and 946, which constitutes the helicase core of WRN composed of the DExH helicase and Zn-binding domains (Figure 3A and C). MutSbeta was found to make contacts not only with the helicase core of WRN, but also with a region spanning amino acids 947-1149 that contains the winged-helix (WH) motif, a common interaction site for most of the WRN partners identified thus far (Figure 3A and C) (39). Notably, the binding affinity of MutSbeta to the WH domain of WRN appeared to be much higher that its binding affinity to the helicase core of WRN (Figure 3C, compare lanes 4-7). The data also indicated that MutSbeta binds to WRN more efficiently than MutSalpha (Figure 3C, top and middle panels; compare lane 1 with lanes 4-7), which is in agreement with the results of the ELISA assay (Figure 1).

To identify the subunits of MutSalpha, MutSbeta and MutLalpha that mediate the interaction with WRN, we performed a quantitative YTHassay with the full-length WRN as prey. The following interactions were examined: MSH2-WRN, MSH6-WRN, MSH3-WRN and MLH1-WRN. We found WRN to interact with MLH1 and MSH2, but not with MSH3 and MSH6 (Figure 4A and B). This indicates that the MutSalpha-WRN and MutSbeta-WRN interactions are mediated by MSH2, and the MutLalpha-WRN interaction is mediated by MLH1. However, the inability of MSH3 and MSH6 to interact with WRN in the YTH assay could be a consequence of the fact that these proteins are not soluble when expressed alone (33). This is also true for PMS2 (34). Therefore, the possibility still exists that these proteins could make additional contacts with WRN. This is particularly likely in the case of MSH3, since our GST pull-down experiments revealed that MutSbeta interacts with both the helicase core and the WH domain of WRN, whereas MutSalpha interacts only with the helicase core of WRN (Figure 3).

In order to identify the WRN interaction domain on MLH1, we tested a series of MLH1 deletion variants for the ability to interact with the full-length WRN in YTH assay. We found that this domain is located at the C-terminus of the MLH1 polypeptide between amino acids 500 and 756 (Figure 4A and B). This is different from the location of the BLM-interaction site that was mapped to the region spanning amino acids 396-500 (29).

Next, we tested MutSalpha for the ability to affect the helicase activity of WRN on DNA substrates containing mismatches. In these experiments, we used a synthetic DNA duplex (49 bp) with a 3'-ss flap (19 nt) resembling a part of the structure that results from annealing of the resected arms of a broken chromosome at regions of homology. On such forked DNA structures, WRN preferentially translocates along the 3'-flap oligonucleotide to unwind the duplex ahead of the fork junction, generating a 3'-tailed duplex. This primary product can be further unwound by WRN into the component strands, as a consequence of loading of a second helicase molecule on the 3'-ssDNA tail (40). We prepared a fully matched substrate and a substrate containing a single G/T mismatch located 11 nt ahead of the ss/ds junction (Figure 5A and B, top panels). WRN alone displayed a very low helicase activity on both structures when present at the same concentration as the DNA substrate (1 nM). However, the helicase activity of WRN on these structures dramatically increased upon inclusion of an 8-fold molar excess of MutSalpha in the reaction (Figure 5A-D). Notably, the initial rate of the MutSalpha-stimulated unwinding reaction with G/T substrate was about 1.7 times higher than that measured with the G/C substrate (Supplementary Table 2).

Since MutLalpha is known to bind to MutSalpha-heteroduplex complexes (41), we investigated whether it can affect the WRN-mediated unwinding of G/T and G/C substrates induced by MutSalpha. We found that MutLalpha did not significantly alter the MutSalpha-dependent helicase activity of WRN on these DNA structures (Figure 5). Also, it had no effect on WRN-mediated unwinding in the absence of MutSalpha (Figure 7, lane 5).

To further assess the effect of MutSalpha on WRN-mediated unwinding of the 3'-flap duplex, we performed a protein titration experiment, in which we varied the concentration of MutSalpha while keeping WRN and DNA substrate at a fixed concentration of 1 nM. We found that MutSalpha stimulated the helicase activity of WRN in a concentration-dependent manner, exhibiting a significantly higher activity on the G/T substrate than on the homoduplex substrate (Figure 6).

To explore the specificity of the observed stimulatory effect, we tested human MutSbeta as well as E. coli MutS for the ability to stimulate DNA unwinding by WRN. We found that MutSbeta enhanced the WRN-mediated unwinding of the 3'-flap DNA duplex to a similar extent as seen with MutSalpha (Figure 7, compare lanes 2 and 3). In contrast, the E. coli MutS protein did not enhance the WRN-mediated DNA unwinding (Figure 7, lane 8), indicating that the observed stimulatory effect is specific to human MutS homologs. As in the case of MutSalpha, MutSbeta-stimulated helicase activity of WRN was not influenced upon addition of MutLalpha (Figure 7, compare lanes 4 and 7) and it was dependent on MutSbeta concentration (Supplementary Figure S1). We also found that in the presence of MutSbeta, WRN unwound the G/T substrate with the same efficiency as the homoduplex substrate (Supplementary Figure S2). This is consistent with the fact that MutSbeta does not bind to base-base mismatches (22) and supports the conclusion that the observed stimulatory effect of the G/T mismatch on MutSalpha-dependent unwinding of the 3'-flap duplex by WRN results from the specific binding of MutSalpha to the mismatch.

To gain further insights into the mechanism underlying the stimulation of the helicase activity of WRN by MutSalpha and MutSbeta, we investigated the dependence of this reaction on the configuration of the arms of the fork. Using the same set of oligonucleotides, we prepared the following substrates: a forked duplex with both arms single stranded (splayed arm); a forked duplex with the 3'-arm single stranded and the 5'-arm double stranded (3'-flap duplex); a forked duplex with the 3'-arm double stranded and the 5'-arm single stranded (5'-flap duplex) and a forked duplex with both arms double stranded. Earlier studies revealed that WRN could unwind efficiently all these structures, indicating that it does not require the 3'-arm to be single stranded for loading at the fork (40). We found that MutSalpha and MutSbeta strongly stimulated the WRN-mediated unwinding of the splayed arm and the 3'-flap duplex, but had no significant effect on the unwinding of the 5'-flap duplex and the fully double stranded fork (Figure 8). We also tested these proteins for the ability to stimulate the helicase activity of WRN on 3'-ssDNA-tailed duplex, which is normally a poor substrate for WRN (40). We found that neither MutSalpha nor MutSbeta could activate WRN for unwinding of this partial DNA duplex (data not shown). Interestingly, the 3'-tail duplex resulting from unwinding of the 3'-flap structure was unwound by WRN efficiently. This discrepancy can result from the fact that WRN exists as an oligomeric structure, which would facilitate loading of a second molecule of WRN on the 3'-ssDNA generated by unwinding of the duplex ahead of the fork. Figure 8.Stimulation of WRN-mediated unwinding of forked DNA structures by MutSalpha and MutSbeta is dependent on the presence of 3'-single stranded DNA at the junction. Reactions with 1 nM splayed arm (white bars), 1 nM 3'-flap duplex (light gray bars), 1 nM 5'-flap duplex (dark gray bars) and 1 nM fully double-stranded fork duplex (black bars) contained 1 nM or 4 nM WRN and 8 nM MutSalpha or MutSbeta as indicated.

Although WRN has been implicated in a number of DNA repair processes, the exact DNA transactions mediated by this helicase/exonuclease in the cell remain elusive. Here we show that WRN interacts physically with proteins that are involved in the initiation of MMR and the rejection of recombination between divergent sequences. Most importantly, our experiments revealed that MutSalpha and MutSbeta can stimulate the helicase activity of WRN on forked DNA structures with a 3'-ss arm that resemble intermediates of single-strand annealing pathways of HR. In addition, we found that a single G/T mismatch located ahead of the fork junction increased the efficiency of the MutSalpha-dependent unwinding by WRN. These data are consistent with a model in which the MMR initiation factors prevent homeologous recombination by activating a DNA helicase for unwinding of recombination intermediates containing mismatches. This model was proposed earlier on the basis of results of in vivo heteroduplex rejection assays with yeast msh2 and sgs1 mutants (27,28). It is possible that MutSalpha and MutSbeta bind to mismatches formed after pairing of sequences of imperfect homology and, following ATP binding, are converted into a DNA sliding clamp as proposed in the case of the MMR pathway (42). When the clamp encounters the junction between the heteroduplex and the non-homologous 3'-SS tail, it binds stably to it and recruits a DNA helicase to disrupt the joined DNA molecule. In agreement with this hypothesis, it has been demonstrated that yeast MutSbeta specifically binds to forked DNA structures containing 3'- ssDNA making contacts with the sequences at the ds-ss junction (43). These studies also revealed that MutSbeta holds the junction in an altered, perhaps more rigid, conformation (43). Such structural changes could facilitate the loading of the WRN helicase on the 3'- ssDNA at the junction, which is a prerequisite for duplex unwinding to occur. However, it should be noted that the MutSalpha-activated unwinding of a 3'-flap duplex by WRN displayed only a moderate dependence on mismatches. It is therefore possible that hereroduplex rejection in vivo involves some additional factors that ensure mismatch specificity of this transaction.

In our studies, we did not observe any significant modulation of WRN-mediated unwinding by MutLalpha, even in the presence of MutSalpha or MutSbeta. In agreement with this finding, the yeast Mlh1 and Pms1 proteins have been shown to have only minor roles in the rejection of homeologous recombination relative to the contributions of Msh2 and Msh6 (27). Thus, it appears that the physical interaction between WRN and MutLalpha identified in this study has some other functional implication. Interestingly, MLH1 was shown to interact with various DNA repair factors including MRE11, BACH1, MBD4 and BLM (29,44-47). It is, therefore, possible that MLH1 plays a more general role in DNA repair processes.

A number of other functional implications for the observed interactions between WRN and the MMR factors can be discussed. Several lines of evidence suggest that WRN promotes replication of telomeric DNA by unwinding G-quadruplex structures that can readily form in G-rich telomeric DNA and impose a barrier for progression of DNA replication forks (9,48-50). Strikingly, human MutSalpha has been shown to bind efficiently to G-quadruplex DNA (51). Moreover, Msh2 deficiency in mice is associated with loss of telomeres and an elevated level of telomere end-to-end fusion, a phenotype similar to that manifested by WRN-deficient cells (9,52). Thus, one can speculate that the MMR proteins can mediate recruitment of the WRN helicase to G-quadruplex structures formed at telomeres and hence facilitate their removal.

It has been shown that the human MutSbeta and WRN are required along with PCNA, RPA and ERCC1-XPF for uncoupling of psoralen-induced inter-strand DNA crosslinks (ICLs) in cell-free extracts, suggesting a novel ICL-repair pathway in which MutSbeta is essential for the recognition of ICLs, while the WRN helicase mediates unwinding of the DNA duplex adjacent to the lesion, which enables strand incision by ERCC1-XPF (53,54). Our finding that MutSbeta physically interacts with WRN and stimulates its helicase activity brings further support for this model and suggests that MutSbeta might recruit WRN to the ICL sites.

Earlier studies demonstrated that nuclear extracts from several fibroblastoid cell lines derived from WS patients were deficient in repair of base-base mismatches and insertion/deletion loops, suggesting that WRN could have a role in MMR (55). However, it is not certain that the MMR-deficiency of these extracts was caused solely by WRN deficiency because complementation experiments with recombinant WRN protein were not performed in this study. Moreover, in some cases, pair-wise mixing of these extracts restored MMR proficiency, making the involvement of WRN in MMR rather questionable.

Recently, two other human RecQ homologs, namely RECQ1 and BLM, have been shown to interact physically and functionally with the MMR-initiation factors (29,31,47,56,57). As in the case of WRN, MutSalpha was found to stimulate RECQ1-mediated unwinding of a forked structure with a 3'-ss arm (56). In contrast, MutSalpha did not affect unwinding of forked DNA duplexes by BLM (31). Instead, MutSalpha was found to stimulate the ability of BLM to process Holliday junctions in vitro (57). Further studies will be needed to fully understand the molecular mechanisms by which the RecQ helicases and MMR factors work together to maintain genomic stability.
