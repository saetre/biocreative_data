Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the most invasive and frequently diagnosed malignancy and the second leading cause of cancer death in many regions of Asia. The PI3K/Akt/mTOR signal pathway is involved in multiple cellular functions including proliferation, differentiation, tumorigenesis, and apoptosis. Up-regulation of telomerase activity is thought to be a critical step leading to cell transformation.

This study investigated changes in mTOR pathway and telomerase activity in hepatocarcinoma cell line SMMC-7721 treated with chemotherapeutic agent 5-fluorouracil (5-Fu). We detected apoptosis of hepatocarcinoma cells by TUNEL assay. Telomerase activity, hTERT transcription level and p- p70 S6k was demonstrated by the telomeric repeat amplification protocol and silver staining assay, Dual-Luciferase Reporter Assay and Western blot analysis respectively.

###begin p 7
Treating SMMC-7721 cells with 5-Fu leads to apoptosis of the cells, and reduction in telomerase activity, as well as a dramatic reduction in the activated form of p70 S6 kinase, a mTOR substrate. The 5-Fu treatment nearly abolishes transcription of hTERT (the major component of telomerase) mRNA. Treating SMMC-7721 cells with Rapamycin, a specific mTOR inhibitor, significantly reduce hTERT protein level but did not affect hTERT transcription. 5-Fu and rapamycin were synergistic in regards to down-regulation of telomerase activity in hepatocarcinoma cells.

Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the most invasive and frequently diagnosed malignancy and is the second leading cause of cancer death for men in China and some other parts of Asia [1]. Phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3-K) pathway has been reported as an important intracellular mediator frequently activated in cancer cells [2]. PI3K activates a number of signaling molecules, among which the Akt/mTOR pathway is of particular interest because of its role in inhibiting apoptosis and promoting cell proliferation [3]. The mammalian target of rapamycin, mTOR, also known as FRAP, RAFT1, or RAPT1, has been shown to regulate mitogen stimulated protein synthesis and cell cycle progression [4-6]. Cell culture studies have demonstrated that one of the mechanisms by which mTOR controls protein synthesis is through phosphorylating downstream substrates, including p70s6 kinase (p70S6K1) and eukaryotic initiation factor (eIF) 4E binding protein 1 (4E-BP1) [7-9]. The protein p70S6K1 phosphorylates the 40S ribosomal protein S6 and is proposed to play a crucial role in the translation of 5'-terminal oligopyrimidine tract mRNAs, which primarily encode ribosomal proteins and components of the translation apparatus [10,11]. Phosphorylation by mTOR of 4E-BP1 disrupts its binding to eIF4E, a protein that binds the 5'-cap structure of mRNA. The released eIF4E allows the formation of a functional translation initiation complex containing eIF4G, eIF4A, eIF3, thereby allowing translation [12,13].

Rapamycin, an immunosuppressive macrocyclic lactone, specifically inhibits the activity of mTOR. Inhibition of mTOR leads to G1 arrest of many malignant cell lines, and currently analogs of rapamycin are being investigated as cancer therapeutic agents [14,15]. In many cell lines, exposure to rapamycin results in a relatively small decrease in overall protein synthesis (~15-20%), but dose result specifically in G1 cell cycle arrest. This can, in part, be explained by the fact that some cell cycle regulators, e.g. cyclin D1, c-MYC and growth factors such as IGF-alpha are controlled by the mTOR pathway [16-18]. Some studies also suggest that mTOR may be a cellular context-dependent, pleiotropic regulator of apoptosis, although conclusive demonstration of mTOR inactivation in such circumstances is lacking [19].

Telomerase is a specialized type of reverse transcriptase that catalyzes the addition of hexameric TTAGGG repeats to telomeres, the ends of chromosomal DNA [20]. The enzyme consists of three major components: telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT), telomerase-associated protein (TEP1), and telomerase RNA (TERC) [21-23]. Telomerase activation is essential for maintaining the telomere length and is required for cellular immortality. It has attracted substantial attention because telomerase activity has been observed in most types of human tumors, but not in adjacent normal cells [24-26]. In ~90% of advanced malignancy cases, high telomerase activity has been detected, which correlates well with increasing steady-state mRNA level of human telomerase reverse transcriptase [27].

Since inhibiting mTOR activity leads to cancer cell death while high levels of telomerase activity is associated with cancer cell proliferation, it is possible that mTOR may directly or indirectly regulate telomerase activity. However, there is no report regarding the role of chemotherapeutic agents on mTOR and its role in regulating the expression profiles of hTERT. In the current study, we investigate the changes in telomerase activity and mTOR activity after HCC cells are treated with 5-fluorouracil (5-Fu) and rapamycin. Our results suggest that 5-Fu treatment of HCC cell line SMMC-7721 could down-regulate both mTOR and telomerase activity, and inhibiting mTOR leads to further down-regulation of telomerase activity at the post-transcriptional levels.

We used dual-luciferase reporter system, where the Renilla luciferase vector provides an internal control that serves as the baseline response. Transient transfections of SMMC-7721 cells were performed in 24-wells plates using Lipofectamin 2000 from Invitrogen according to the manufacturer instructions. SMMC-7721 cells were cultured in 24-well plates until they reached 85-90% confluence. 1 mul of Lipofectamin 2000 reagent and 0.4 mug pBTdel-130 plasmid DNA were used to transfect each well of cells in the absence of serum. After 4-6 h, the medium were replaced with 10% FBS DMEM. Approximately 24 h after the beginning of the transfection, the cells were exposed to 5-Fu and, or rapamycin. The cells luciferase activity was then analyzed by Dual-Luciferase Reporter Assay System.

To investigate the underlying mechanism, the hTERT promoter activity and hTERT mRNA levels were analyzed in the cells treated with or without both drugs. SMMC-7721 cells transiently tranfected with the reporter plasmid were treated with rapamycin (10 nM) or 5-Fu (62.5 mug/ml) or both drugs (10 nM rapamycin 1 h piror to 5-Fu) for 36 h. Again, 5-Fu nearly abolished the activity of the hTERT promoter (Figure 5B) or mRNA expression (Figure 5C). On the other hand, rapamycin treatment had no effect at all on hTERT promoter activity and hTERT mRNA level, indicating that rapamycin probably reduced hTERT protein expression at the post-transcriptional level.

The reactivation of telomerase activity is a vital step in tumorigenesis. Beyond its role in telomere maintenance, telomerase provides additional functions in DNA repair and cell survival. Telomerase protects cells from apoptosis and necrosis, and stimulates growth under adverse conditions [29]. Inhibition of telomerase activity in cancer cells is a potent factor in the abrogation of cellular immortalization. A number of different approaches have been developed to inhibit telomerase activity in human cancer cells. Different components and types of inhibitors targeting various regulatory levels have been regarded as useful for telomerase inhibition. Many telomerase inhibitors seem to be most efficient when combined with conventional chemotherapeutics. It has been demonstrated that telomerase may be involved in triggering apoptosis, but the underlying molecular mechanism remains unclear [30]. In the present study, we showed that 5-Fu treatment of SMMC-7721 cells induces apoptosis and telomerase activity down-regulation within 36 h. Moreover, this is accompanied by reduction of hTERT mRNA and hTERT protein.

In principle, survival signals are ideal targets for anticancer therapeutic strategies because blocking these signals leads to the death of cells that are dependent upon them. Increasing evidences implicate mTOR as a central player in cell proliferation, migration, and survival [31-33]. The mTOR protein is involved in the regulation of cyclins D1/A, cyclin-dependent kinases, cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors (p21Cip1 and p27Kip1), retinoblastoma protein, RNA polymerase I/II/III-transcription and translation [34-37]. Suppression of these mTOR-mediated survival signals provides the opportunity to reactivate default apoptotic pathways in cancer cells and allow them to proceed on the path of death [38]. Three potent and specific mTOR inhibitors have been reported which are either rapamycin or rapamycin derivatives: rapamycin, CCI-779 (also called cell-cycle inhibitor-779, rapamycin-42,2,2-bis(hydroxymethyl)-propionic acid; Wyeth-Ayerst, PA, USA) and RAD001 (also called everolimus or 40-O-(2-hydroxyethyl)-rapamycin; Novartis AG, Basel, Switzerland). In addition to being a fungicide and immunosuppressant, rapamycin has also been proposed as a potential therapeutic for cancer treatment and for restenosis prevention [39,40].

Our present study attempts to link these two important factors of human tumorigenesis in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), which is one of the leading causes of cancer and cancer-related death in China, in the context of conventional chemotherapeutics (i.e. 5-Fu) induced apoptosis of HCC cells. We have demonstrated that in 5-Fu induced apoptosis of HCC cells SMMC-7721 in a dose-dependent fashion, and 5-Fu reduced telomerase activity of these cells primarily through reduction in hTERT transcription. The 5-Fu treatment also reduced mTOR activity. Inhibition of mTOR activity with its specific inhibitor rapamycin resulted in decrease of SMMC-7721 cells viability and down-regulation of hTERT protein expression, although rapamycin did not affect hTERT transcription. The two effects, reduction of cell viability and down-regulation of hTERT protein, caused by 5-Fu and rapamycin were synergistic or additive and that this would be a potential chemotherapeutic combination for hepatocellular cancer. Our findings indicated that mTOR signal molecule may be involved in the regulation of telomerase activity at post-transcriptional level. Phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3-K) pathway has been reported as an important intracellular mediator frequently activated in cancer cells. PI3K activates a number of signaling molecules, such as Akt. Recent studies show mTOR is an important substrate of Akt. The down-regulation of mTOR activity may be through the inhibition of PI3K/Akt signal pathway.

Thus, 5-Fu functions to induce cell death by regulating telomerase activity through two distinct mechanisms: 1) direct effect at the transcriptional level and 2) indirectly by down-regulating mTOR, which leads to reduced telomerase protein level. Thus, our results suggest that mTOR may be a likely chemotherapeutic target for cancer.
