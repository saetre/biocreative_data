The distribution of E-selectin genotypes in patients affected by PAOD was 84.6% for the AA genotype and 15.4% for the AC genotype. In the control arm the distribution was 97% for the AA genotype and 3% for the AC genotype. There was a statistically significance difference in the distribution of the AC genotype in PAOD patients when compared with the control subjects. Additionally, the distribution of ICAM-1 genotypes in patients affected by PAOD was 30.8% with the EE, 48% with the EK, and 21.2% with the KK genotypes. The distribution of ICAM-1 genotypes in control subjects was 13% EE, 33% EK and 54% KK. The EE genotype was significantly more common in PAOD patients than in the controls.

Patients with peripheral arterial occlusive disease (PAOD) show persistently high morbidity and mortality rates. Treatment entails revascularization (by open surgery or endovascular interventions), amputation and medical treatment that includes the modification of risk factors associated with the disease. Inflammation plays a role in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis and PAOD.1

Various inflammatory mediators such as tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta) and bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS), increase the expression of cell adhesion molecules (CAMs) including intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1), vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1) and E-selectin on endothelial cells.2 Thus, upon inflammatory stimulation, the endothelial barrier function is rapidly lost and preformed P-selectin is translocated to the luminal surface of endothelial cells, followed by expression and release of E-selectin, ICAM-1, and VCAM-1 - substances that regulate the attachment and trans-endothelial migration of leukocytes. Both macro-phages and endothelial cells produce ICAM-1 in response to inflammatory cytokines.3 Circulating markers of systemic inflammation such as C-reactive protein (CRP), IL-6, ICAM-1, and E-selectin have been shown to predict the increased probability of future cardiovascular disease (CVD), such as myocardial infarction, stroke, and PAOD.4

The S128R polymorphism of the E-selectin gene is of interest for two reasons: first, it is overrepresented in certain patient groups affected by disease that is characterized by an increased adhesiveness of leukocytes to the endothelium; such as atherosclerosis and myocardial infarction and secondly, it is a functional polymorphism since it modifies ligand affinity.5,6 This mutation confers an alteration in selectin ligand-binding specificity which leads to a gain of function under flow conditions, possibly amplifying the number of leukocytes that roll and subsequently adhere to the endothelium.7 Furthermore, S128R transduced endothelial cells support significantly more rolling and adhesion of neutrophils and mononuclear cells compared to epithelial cells (EC)s transduced with wild-type E-selectin.8 Substitution of the E-selectin epidermal growth factor domain residue Ser128 with an arginine residue results in E-selectin proteins that have lost the requirement for alpha1-3-linked fucose and are thus able to bind to sialyllactosamine. These S128R-transduced ECs also exhibit significantly greater levels of phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1 and 2 together with p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase. This suggests that an altered endothelial signaling pathway is associated with this polymorphism.9

ICAM-1 plays a major role in leukocyte infiltration as well as T cell activation by B cells. The human ICAM-1 gene is located on chromosome 19p13.3-p13.2 and contains seven exons. Several single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of the human ICAM-1 gene have been reported, and functional analyses regarding the association between each polymorphism and certain diseases have been performed.10 Two ICAM-1, coding region, biallelic polymorphisms have been identified: Gly (G) or Arg (R) at codon 241 (exon 4) and Lys (K) or Glu (E) at codon 469 (exon 6).11 E469K is known to be common in all populations and has been analyzed for its association with several inflammatory diseases.12 Our aim was to evaluate the association between gene polymorphism of E-selectin and ICAM and PAOD in an Egyptian population.

This study was conducted on 256 Egyptian subjects. They were divided into two groups: a test group of 156 patients suffering from PAOD (78 males and 78 females) and a control group that included, 100 age-matched, healthy subjects (48 males and 52 females). The patients were subdivided into two subgroups: 93 diabetic patients with type II diabetes mellitus (DM) and 63 nondiabetic patients (NDM). Patients with PAOD were diagnosed by the presence of intermittent claudications, rest pain, and/or tissue loss in the absence of distal pulsations. Duplex examination was done for all patients to confirm the site of arterial occlusion and the presence of distal run off. Patients were referred from the vascular surgery departments of a number of centers to the Kasr El-Aini Hospital between April 2007 and December 2008. Healthy individuals, recruited consecutively among physicians and coworkers, represented healthy, normal control subjects. Comprehensive informed consents were obtained from all participants included in the study.

Subjects were Egyptian nationals with PAOD at Fontaine's stage II, III, or IV, detected by a detailed history, thorough physical and clinical examination together with laboratory investigation. Demographic data, a detailed history and thorough clinical examination with special emphasis on vascular complications was undertaken for both study groups. Arterial duplex was performed and the sites of occlusion in every PAOD patient were recorded. Appropriate treatment was then undertaken according to patients' presentation, general condition, and state of distal run off. The choice between revascularization by open surgery or endovascular intervention was determined by the TASC II classification.1

Descriptive statistics in form of mean and standard deviation for parametric data were used, while frequency and percentage were used to describe nonparametric data. ANOVA followed by a post-hoc test (Scheffe) were used for comparison of parametric data among the test groups. For genotype of the E-selectin and ICAM, the differences in their frequency were analyzed by the chi-squared test. An unpaired t-test was undertaken for comparison of parametric data between the different genotypes of E-selectin.

The total sites of occlusion for all patients were 231 sites; 141 for 39 of the DM patients, and 90 sites for 24 of the NDM patients. There was no statistical significant difference for sites of occlusion between the DM and NDM patients. The incidence of superficial femoral artery (SFA) occlusion in the TPG, DM, and NDM groups was 45.5%, 44.7%, and 46.7%, respectively. The occurrence of AA and AC polymorphism in patients presenting with SFA were determined as 43.8% and 53.9%, respectively. There was no statistically significant difference between patients having AA and AC genotype regarding the different sites of occlusion. With regard to the ICAM-1 genotypes, the most common site of occlusion was also the SFA. It was concomitant with 40.7%, 61.1%, and 40.6% of the EE, KK, and EK genotypes respectively. There was no statistical significance among different groups of patients regarding other sites of occlusion.

The present study found a statistically significant difference (P < 0.05) between the control group and TPG patients regarding the risk factors for atherosclerosis such as smoking and hypertension. Similar results were obtained by both Gaetani and colleagues and Hattori and colleagues.14,15 while Schgoer and colleagues and Mueller and colleagues16,17 found that coronary artery disease (CAD) was coexistent with PAOD although not present in a control group.

In the present study it was determined that no statistically significant (P > 0.05) difference existed between the control group and the TPG regarding the AA genotype of E-selectin although there was a statistically significant difference regarding AC genotype. These results are in agreement with those reported by Li and colleagues,21 who found the distribution of the AA and AC genotypes were 93.8% and 6.2% in the control subjects, respectively and 86.7% and 13.3% in patients with CAD, respectively. In the study of Yoshida and colleagues,8 the frequency of Arg128-positive was significantly higher in patients than in the controls (12.6% versus 6.7%). They concluded that the E-selectin Ser128Arg polymorphism can functionally alter leukocyte-endothelial interactions as well as biochemical and biological consequences, which may account for the pathogenesis of myocardial infarction. However, these results contrary to those of Endler and colleagues22 who found no significant differences within the genotype distribution of E-selectin S128R polymorphism when comparing patients with CAD to patients without CAD. In this study there was no statistically significant difference among the different groups regarding the A allele although was a significant difference among the different groups regarding C allele when compared with controls. Similar results were obtained by both Iwashima and colleagues and Meru and colleagues.19,23 Moreover, Wenzel and colleagues24 reported an allele frequency of the S128R polymorphism to be 91.3% S and 8.7% R in an control population and 84.5% S and 15.5% R in patients with severe coronary heart disease (CHD) and that the R128 allele was significantly more common in patients with CHD than in the controls.

Allele distribution was significantly different between our two groups: the E/K-allele ratio was 1.2 in the PAOD group and 0.43 in controls. The frequency of the K-allele was significantly higher for control group than TPG patients, while the frequency of the E-allele was significantly higher for TPG patients than control group. These results are in harmony with other researchers14,25 who found the frequency of the EE genotype in patients with PAOD was significantly higher than in controls, while the frequency of the KK genotype was significantly higher in control subjects. The results of Yokoyama and colleagues26 found that the distribution of K469E polymorphism in type 2 DM and control subjects was not significantly different between both groups results that are in conflict to our findings although such a difference may be due to differences in the selection of PAOD patients.

In the present work we found no statistical difference between the different polymorphisms and the clinical history and laboratory data among the patient groups except in those with IHD, where there was significant difference between EE and EK (6.2% vs 3.2%). These results are in accordance, in part, with those of Milutinovic and Petrovic27 who found no statistically significant association between the genotypes and coronary risk factors (clinical history and laboratory).

When comparing the E-selectin and ICAM-1 genotypes with regards to the site of occlusion in the TPG, we found there was no significant association between different groups. We also found that the incidence of SFA, amongst the TPG, was the most common form of occlusion, results that are in accordance with Meru and colleagues.23

We evaluated the concurrent E-selectin and ICAM-1 genotypes in patients with PAOD with a normal control group and observed no significant association between AC and EE genotypes. However, we did find the concurrent association of the AC genotype in the E-selectin gene and EE genotype of ICAM-1 gene in 24 TPG patients. These data support the hypothesis that E-selectin and ICAM-1 are important in the pathophysiology of vascular diseases and suggest a role for anti-inflammatory therapy in the prevention and treatment PAOD.
