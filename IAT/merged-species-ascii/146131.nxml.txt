The discovery of Ribonuclease k6 (RNase k6) was an unexpected result of our ongoing efforts to trace the evolutionary history of the ribonuclease gene family. The open reading frame of RNase k6, amplified from human genomic DNA, encodes a 150 amino acid polypeptide with eight cysteines and histidine and lysine residues corresponding to those found in the active site of the prototype, ribonuclease A. The single-copy gene encoding RNase k6 maps to human chromosome 14 and orthologous sequences were detected in both primate and non-primate mammalian species. A single mRNA transcript (1.5 kb) was detected in all human tissues tested, with lung representing the most abundant source. At the cellular level, transcripts encoding RNase k6 were detected in normal human monocytes and neutrophils (but not in eosinophils) suggesting a role for this ribonuclease in host defense. Of the five previously identified human ribonucleases of this group, RNase k6 is most closely related to eosinophil-derived neurotoxin (EDN), with 47% amino acid sequence identity; slight cross-reactivity between RNase k6 and EDN was observed on Western blots probed with polyclonal anti-EDN antiserum. The catalytic constants determined, Km = 5.0 microM and Kcat = 0.13 s-1, indicate that recombinant RNase k6 has approximately 40-fold less ribonuclease activity than recombinant EDN. The identification and characterization of RNase k6 has extended the ribonuclease gene family and suggests the possibility that there are others awaiting discovery.
