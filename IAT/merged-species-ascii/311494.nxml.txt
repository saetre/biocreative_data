Mouse submaxillary gland contains many proteolytic enzymes, the most widely studied of which are the kallikreins. This gland also contains high levels of nerve growth factor (NGF), which is isolated as a complex of three subunits, alpha, beta, and gamma. We report here the cloning and sequence analysis of a novel kallikrein from mouse submaxillary gland. Antibodies directed against the alpha subunit precipitate the product of this clone, but do not precipitate the homologous gamma subunit. This new kallikrein is therefore closely related to alpha NGF, yet in contrast to the alpha subunit, its sequence suggests it has proteolytic activity.
