We have characterised a cluster of CpG rich (HTF) islands in the alpha-globin complex and report here two unusual features: The human embryonic zeta 2-globin gene is associated with an HTF island within its 3' portion rather than at the 5' end. Furthermore at least two non-functional pseudogenes within the cluster (psi zeta 1 and psi alpha 2) are associated with CpG rich islands.
