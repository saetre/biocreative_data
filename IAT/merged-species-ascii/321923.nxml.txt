The nucleotide sequence of the deoR gene of E. coli, which codes for the DeoR repressor, has been determined. This gene codes for a polypeptide that is 252 amino acids residues in length. Computer-assisted analysis of the nucleotide sequence strongly suggests that the DNA binding domain of the DeoR repressor is located in the N-terminal part of the protein. After the coding region there is a dyad symmetry similar to a palindromic unit present outside many structural genes on the E. coli chromosome.
