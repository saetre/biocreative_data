The 5' region of a cell cycle regulated human H1 histone gene appears to contain at least six promoter DNA elements that are shared with some, but not all human core (H2A, H2B, H3 and H4) histone genes. We show that two of these elements represent separate binding sites for two distinct, partially purified factors. The first promoter domain contains A/T rich repeats and is involved in the binding of HiNF-A, a nuclear factor previously found to bind to A/T rich direct repeats in the promoters of human H4 and H3 histone genes. The second domain, containing the general promoter element 5' dACCAAT, acts as a binding site for a two component mosaic factor we have designated HiNF-B. These data suggest that coordinate transcriptional regulation of human H1 and core histone genes may involve two classes of trans-acting factors: those specific for histone gene promoters and those that act on a broad spectrum of human gene promoters.
