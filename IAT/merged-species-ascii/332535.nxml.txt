The human serine/threonine protein casein kinase II (CK II) contains two distinct catalytic subunits, alpha and alpha 1, which are encoded by different genes. A combination of segregation analysis of rodent-human hybrid cells and chromosomal in situ hybridization have localized the human CK II-alpha DNA sequence to two loci: 11p15.5-p15.4 and 20p13. In contrast, the CK II-alpha' gene has been mapped to chromosome 16 by somatic cell hybrid analysis. Taken together with our previous assignment of the CK II regulatory beta-subunit gene to 6p12-p21, these results indicate that although the products of these genes form a single biological complex, they are encoded on different human chromosomes. Further analysis should determine whether both loci of CK II-alpha are functional, or perhaps one of the two constitutes a pseudogene.
