beta1- and beta2-adrenergic receptors (betaARs) are highly homologous, yet they play clearly distinct roles in cardiac physiology and pathology. Myocyte contraction, for instance, is readily stimulated by beta1AR but not beta2AR signaling, and chronic stimulation of the two receptors has opposing effects on myocyte apoptosis and cell survival. Differences in the assembly of macromolecular signaling complexes may explain the distinct biological outcomes. Here, we demonstrate that beta1AR forms a signaling complex with a cAMP-specific phosphodiesterase (PDE) in a manner inherently different from a beta2AR/beta-arrestin/PDE complex reported previously. The beta1AR binds a PDE variant, PDE4D8, in a direct manner, and occupancy of the receptor by an agonist causes dissociation of this complex. Conversely, agonist binding to the beta2AR is a prerequisite for the recruitment of a complex consisting of beta-arrestin and the PDE4D variant, PDE4D5, to the receptor. We propose that the distinct modes of interaction with PDEs result in divergent cAMP signals in the vicinity of the two receptors, thus, providing an additional layer of complexity to enforce the specificity of beta1- and beta2-adrenoceptor signaling.

To meet the increased metabolic demands of stress or exercise, the sympathetic nervous system stimulates cardiac function through activation of the closely related beta1- and beta2-adrenergic receptors (beta1AR and beta2AR). Even though these highly homologous receptors both activate the G protein stimulatory for adenylyl cyclase (Gs), signaling through beta1AR and beta2AR produces clearly distinguishable biological effects (Xiang and Kobilka, 2003; Xiao et al, 2004). The beta1AR plays the dominant role in stimulating heart rate and strength of myocyte contraction, whereas beta2AR produces only modest chronotropic effects. Chronic stimulation of beta1AR produces myocyte hypertrophy and apoptosis, whereas beta2AR signaling promotes cell survival. The assembly of distinct macromolecular signaling complexes with transducer, scaffold, and effector proteins, which determine signaling properties and subcellular localization of the betaARs, is thought to be at the core of the divergent properties of these receptors (Xiang and Kobilka, 2003; Xiao et al, 2004). Thus, understanding the differences of these receptor complexes has important pharmacological and clinical implications.

One of the emerging mechanisms that safeguard the specificity of G-protein-coupled receptor/cAMP signaling is the control of cAMP transients via degradation by cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterases (PDEs) (Conti and Beavo, 2007). Biochemical, electrophysiological, and in vivo imaging studies are consolidating the idea that occupancy of different receptors generates a nonuniform pattern of activation of cAMP effector proteins such as PKA (cAMP-dependent protein kinase). PDEs play a critical role for the specificity in cAMP-signaling by preventing the free diffusion of cAMP, thus, effectively creating cyclic nucleotide microdomains and/or cAMP gradients that can be sensed by the cell (Zaccolo and Pozzan, 2002; Xiang et al, 2005; Fischmeister et al, 2006).

PDEs comprise a large group of over 20 genes that are divided into 11 PDE families based on their amino-acid sequence homology, substrate specificities, and pharmacological properties (Conti and Beavo, 2007). Each of the 11 PDE families encompasses one to four distinct genes. In addition, most PDE genes encode for multiple splicing variants through the use of multiple promoters and alternative splicing.

Previous studies indicated that occupancy of the beta2AR initiates the recruitment of a preformed complex consisting of beta-arrestin and the cyclic AMP-specific PDE, PDE4D5 (Perry et al, 2002; Baillie et al, 2003). Conversely, no data are available on complexes between PDEs and the beta1AR even though it has been shown that PDE4 inhibitors potentiate cAMP accumulation induced by either beta1AR or beta2AR (Xiang et al, 2005). Here, we show that beta1AR forms a signaling complex with a PDE4D splicing variant in a manner inherently different from the beta2AR/beta-arrestin/PDE complex reported previously. Thus, this study challenges the assumption that the regulation of receptor signaling by PDEs described for the beta2AR also applies to beta1AR. We propose that the distinct modes of interaction with PDEs provide an additional layer of complexity to enforce the specificity of beta1- and beta2-adrenoceptor signaling.

To probe for a possible signaling complex including the beta1AR and a PDE, mouse neonatal cardiomyocytes were infected with an adenovirus encoding a Flag-tagged beta1AR, and the receptor was subsequently immunoprecipitated using an antibody against the tag. A significant amount of endogenous PDE activity was recovered in the beta1AR immunoprecipitation (IP) pellet (Figure 1A). The PDE activity associated with the beta1AR was inhibited by the PDE4-selective inhibitor, Rolipram, identifying this activity as PDE4. Three PDE4 subtypes, PDE4A, PDE4B, and PDE4D, are expressed in neonatal cardiomyocytes at comparable levels (Figure 2B). The fourth gene, PDE4C, is not expressed in the heart and was not investigated. To assess which of the PDE4 subtypes contribute to the activity recovered in the beta1AR IP, cardiomyocytes deficient in PDE4A, PDE4B, and PDE4D were subjected to pull-down experiments. Whereas ablation of PDE4A or PDE4B had no effect, inactivation of the PDE4D gene prevented co-IP of PDE activity with the beta1AR (Figure 1B). Thus, PDE4D is the endogenous PDE recovered in complex with the receptor. This conclusion is further supported by western blot analysis of the immunoprecipitated PDE. A band immunoreactive with PDE4D-selective antibodies was consistently detected in the IP pellet (Figure 1C), and its mobility is consistent with that of a subset of PDE4D splicing variants that include PDE4D3, PDE4D8, and PDE4D9 (Richter et al, 2005). Together, these data suggest the presence of a signaling complex containing the beta1AR, a PDE4D isoform, and perhaps other components of the cAMP signaling pathway in cardiac myocytes.

Through alternate splicing and the use of multiple promoters, nine different proteins, PDE4D1-9, originate from the PDE4D gene (Richter et al, 2005; Figure 2D). These proteins are identical in the catalytic domain and C-terminus but diverge at the N-terminus. Long forms contain a conserved UCR1/UCR2 (upstream conserved regions 1 and 2) motif, whereas short forms lack UCR1 and part of UCR2 (Conti et al, 2003; Houslay and Adams, 2003). Using antibodies raised against the unique N-terminus of each variant, we determined that PDE4D5, PDE4D8, and PDE4D9 are the splicing variants most abundant in cardiomyocytes, with trace amounts of PDE4D3 (Figure 2C). The co-IP of these PDE4D splice variants expressed exogenously in HEK293 cells identified PDE4D8 as the variant that most efficiently interacts with beta1AR. Other long PDE4D splice variants were also recovered in beta1AR IP pellets with the following rank order: PDE4D8>PDE4D9>PDE4D3>PDE4D5 (Figure 3A and B). Conversely, the short PDE4D form, PDE4D2, did not co-IP with the beta1AR, indicating that the UCR domains unique to long PDE4 splice variants may contribute to the formation of the beta1AR/PDE4D complex.

As previously reported, tethering of PDE4D5 to the beta2AR signaling complex is mediated by beta-arrestins (Baillie et al, 2003). However, the co-IP of exogenous PDE4D and beta1AR from extracts of mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) deficient in beta-arrestin 1 and 2 (Kohout et al, 2001) was not decreased compared with wild-type controls, suggesting that formation of the beta1AR/PDE4D complex is independent of beta-arrestins (Figure 3C). To further characterize the interaction, we performed IPs using PDE4D and betaARs that were purified from a baculovirus expression system to >90% purity (see Supplementary Figure 1 for the characterization of the purified proteins). In this paradigm, PDE4D shows robust association with beta1AR but not with beta2AR (Figure 3D and E). This confirms that beta-arrestins are not required for the beta1AR/PDE4D complex. More importantly, this approach clearly indicates that PDE4D binds directly to the beta1AR but has no significant, or a much reduced affinity for beta2AR.

To determine whether receptor occupancy affects the beta1AR/PDE4D complex, HEK293 cells expressing exogenous beta1AR and PDE4D8 were incubated with different ligands. Treatment with the physiological beta1AR agonist, (-)-Norepinephrine (NorEpi), caused dissociation of the beta1AR/PDE4D complex (Figure 4A and B), whereas the stereoisomer, (+)-norepinephrine, which is a poor beta1AR ligand, had no effect. Dissociation of the beta1AR/PDE4D complex was observed also in cardiac myocytes and beta-arrestin-deficient MEFs (Supplementary Figures 3 and 4) and occurred whether the overexpressed PDE4D was catalytically active or inactive (Supplementary Figure 5). Dissociation of the beta1AR/PDE4D complex by NorEpi binding is rapid (T1/2<1 min; Figure 4C and D) and dose-dependent (Figure 4E and F), reaching maximum at approximately 100 muM NorEpi. Thus, the concentration-dependence of dissociation of the beta1AR/PDE4D complex is comparable to that of receptor occupancy by NorEpi rather than that of receptor-induced cAMP production, which is in the nanomolar range. In addition, washout of the agonist results in beta1AR/PDE4D reassociation (data not shown). This dynamic, receptor occupancy-dependent regulation of beta1AR/PDE4D complex formation may explain why beta1AR/PDE4D dissociation is not complete and some portion of receptor/PDE complexes (approximately30%) remain at any given time point. Treatment with the beta-adrenergic agonists, isoproterenol (ISO; 10 muM; see Supplementary Figure 5) or Epinephrine (100 muM; data not shown), also promoted dissociation of the beta1AR/PDE4D complex.

All PDE4 long forms are activated by phosphorylation at a conserved PKA consensus site in UCR1 (see Figure 2D); this mechanism provides a ubiquitous negative-feedback loop critical for cAMP signaling (Conti et al, 2003). Accordingly, stimulation of cultured neonatal cardiac myocytes with beta-adrenergic agonists leads to a rapid PKA-mediated activation of PDE4D (Supplementary Figure 2A-C). If complexes composed of betaARs and PDEs are present in these cells, phosphorylation should be biased toward the PDEs present in the vicinity of the occupied receptors. This is indeed the case when beta1AR- and beta2AR-stimulated phosphorylation of PDE4D isoforms was monitored. In cardiomyocytes lacking beta2AR, PDE4D8 was the PDE4D isoform predominantly activated after stimulation of beta1AR with ISO, with a limited activation of PDE4D9, and no significant effect on PDE4D5 (Figure 5A). Conversely, in myocytes lacking beta1AR, stimulation of beta2AR causes a selective increase in the activity of PDE4D5, with a less pronounced increase in PDE4D9, and no increase in PDE4D8 activity (Figure 5B). Importantly, upon stimulation with the adenylyl cyclase activator, Forskolin, all PDE4D isoforms show the same increase in activity in both cell types (Figure 5C), suggesting that loss of one betaAR subtype or the other has not perturbed overall cAMP signaling. It also demonstrates that the spatial dimension of cAMP signaling is lost when generalized adenylyl cyclase activation is induced with Forskolin. The selective activation of PDE4D splicing variants by beta1AR and beta2AR signaling confirms the selectivity observed in the physical association of beta1AR with PDE4D8 (Figure 3A and B) and the preferential sequestration of PDE4D5 to the beta2AR by beta-arrestin (Baillie et al, 2003). Because these experiments are with endogenous proteins, they strengthen our hypothesis of the presence of PDE4D variants in complex with beta1AR and beta2AR in vivo.

The presence of a PDE4D in the vicinity of the beta1AR should affect the activity of PKA localized with the receptor as well as the PKA-phosphorylation state of the receptor itself. This possibility was tested by blocking PDE activity with selective PDE4 inhibitors in cardiomyocytes (Figure 6A and B), by using MEFs deficient in PDE4D (Figure 6C and D), or by overexpressing a catalytically inactive PDE4D in cardiomyocytes, which acts as a dominant-negative construct (Perry et al, 2002; Baillie et al, 2003) by displacing endogenous PDE4D from the beta1AR complex (Figure 6E and F; Supplementary Figure 5). In all instances, blockage of PDE4 activity or, more specifically, ablation or displacement of PDE4D caused a significant increase in the phosphorylation of the transfected beta1AR in the absence of beta-adrenergic agonists. It should be noted that inhibition of PDE3 activity or an overexpression of a dominant-negative PDE3A construct has no effect on beta1AR phosphorylation, confirming the specificity of the interactions. These findings indicate that PDE4D controls the access of cAMP to PKA localized with the beta1AR, effectively creating a domain with low basal cAMP/PKA activity. PDE4D also limits PKA-phosphorylation of beta1AR in response to low concentrations of beta-adrenergic agonists that do not disrupt a large number of beta1AR/PDE4D complexes. This is likely due to the control of cAMP levels and PKA-activity in the vicinity of unoccupied, and thus, PDE4D-associated receptors in response to elevated cellular cAMP levels. These findings suggest a function of PDE4D in complex with the beta1AR in the intact cell.

To assess the role of PDE4D in beta1AR function in a more physiological context, changes in the heart rate of mice in response to beta-adrenergic stimulation were measured, as it is established that in vivo contraction rate is primarily controlled by beta1AR (Rohrer et al, 1996, 1999; Devic et al, 2001). Wild-type and PDE4DKO mice, matched by age, sex, and genetic background, were sedated using isoflurane. While their heart rate was continuously measured using a mouse pulse oximeter sensor, the mice were then injected with a submaximal concentration of ISO. An additional group of mice was first injected with glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP1) to enhance the heterologous desensitization of beta1AR before the ISO injection. Wild-type and PDE4DKO mice showed no significant differences in basal heart rate (WT=410+/-52 and 4DKO=386+/-46 beats/min, means+/-s.e.m.), the maximal heart rate after ISO injection (WT=544+/-34 and 4DKO=515+/-32 beats/min), the maximal heart rate after GLP1 injection (WT=487+/-14 and 4DKO=448+/-19 beats/min), or the maximal heart rate after sequential injection of GLP1 and ISO (WT=539+/-24 and 4DKO=581+/-17 beats/min). The rate of return to basal heart rate after the initial response to ISO was slightly faster in PDE4DKO mice compared with wild-type controls (Figure 7A); however, this effect was greatly magnified by pretreatment of mice with GLP1 (Figure 7B; P<0.0001). The faster decrease in heart rate is in agreement with our stated hypothesis that elevated levels of cAMP/PKA activity in the vicinity of the beta1AR, due to absence of PDE4D in this compartment, causes an increased phosphorylation and heterologous desensitization of beta1AR (see Figure 6).

With the above findings, we have identified a novel signaling complex that distinguishes beta1AR from beta2AR. Although both receptors are in complexes with PDEs, their interactions differ in terms of the PDE4D splice variant recruited to the receptor, the mode of interaction with the PDE4D variant, and the effect of receptor agonists on the complex (see the illustration in Figure 8). beta1AR preferentially associates with PDE4D8 in cardiomyocytes as shown by co-IP of endogenous PDE with the beta1AR (Figure 1C), as well as the selective activation of PDE4D8 in intact cells (Figure 5A). This preference of beta1AR for PDE4D8 was confirmed by co-IP experiments with exogenous proteins (Figure 3A and B). Conversely, PDE4D5 is the variant tethered to the beta2AR/beta-arrestin complex (Baillie et al, 2003) concurring with the preferential activation of PDE4D5 upon beta2AR signaling (Figure 5B). In pull-down experiments using purified proteins (Figure 3D and E), beta1AR efficiently interacts with PDE4D, whereas beta2AR has negligible affinity for PDE4D, underscoring the direct mode of PDE4D-beta1AR interaction versus the indirect, beta-arrestin-dependent mode of PDE4D-beta2AR interaction. The most important difference regarding the function of betaARs is the effect of receptor occupancy on the PDE4D complexes. The beta1AR/PDE4D complex is present in the absence of agonist and dissociates after receptor occupancy, whereas agonist binding to the beta2AR is a prerequisite for the recruitment of the beta-arrestin/PDE4D complex to the receptor. Thus, under basal conditions, PDE4D is poised to control local cAMP concentration and PKA activity in the vicinity of the beta1AR (see Figure 6), whereas it affects beta2AR signaling only after ligand binding and beta-arrestin recruitment. These differences likely impact the time course of cAMP accumulation in the vicinity of the receptors. We propose that these divergent interactions with PDE4D variants specify the property of the signals emanating from the two receptors.

Tethering of PDE4D to the beta1AR provides a means to target cAMP hydrolytic activity in the vicinity of the unoccupied receptor, thus, preventing a local increase in cAMP under basal conditions. This, in turn, protects the beta1AR from PKA-mediated phosphorylation and desensitization (Rapacciuolo et al, 2003; Gardner et al, 2006) and may control PKA-mediated phosphorylation of other localized substrates. Indeed, when PDE4 activity is inhibited in cardiomyocytes (Figure 6A and B), is absent, as in the PDE4D-deficient MEFs (Figure 6C and D), or is displaced, as in PDE4D-DN infected cardiomyocytes (Figure 6E and F), a substantial increase in basal beta1AR receptor phosphorylation is observed. In addition to controlling basal cAMP accumulation, targeting of PDE4D to the beta1AR may prevent heterologous desensitization of unoccupied receptors. Consistent with this idea, we report here that PDE4D deficiency accelerates the desensitization of beta-adrenergic signals measured as changes in mouse heart rate in response to ISO injection (Figure 7). At the same time and given the observation that occupancy of the beta1AR causes dissociation of the complex, it is likely that the ligand-induced dissociation of PDE4D from the beta1AR cooperates to produce a localized increase in cAMP in the proximity of the occupied receptor. This event should decrease local cAMP degradation and therefore amplify the beta1-adrenergic signal locally. Consistent with this view, localized cAMP transients in the dyad space are elevated in the PDE4DKO mouse, whereas global cAMP signaling is not perturbed (Lehnart et al, 2005). The fate and function of the released PDE4D are to be determined and may provide a means to regulate a distinct pool of cAMP away from the membrane.

Using changes in the heart rate of mice in response to beta-adrenergic stimulation as a read-out, we show here that PDE4D deficiency promotes an accelerated desensitization of beta1AR signaling. Although additional steps in excitation contraction coupling may also be affected by the absence of PDE4D, this observation is consistent with the idea that a major function of PDE4D in the beta1AR signaling complex is to protect the receptor from PKA-mediated heterologous desensitization. The direct interaction of PDE4D with the receptor, however, opens additional possibilities for a function of PDE4D in the beta1AR complex. These include a direct effect of PDE4D on the conformation of the receptor and a role of PDE4D in the assembly of macromolecular signaling complexes around the beta1AR. The latter may include the competition of PDE4D with other proteins for binding to the receptor or, in an opposite fashion, PDE4D may act as a scaffold by tethering additional proteins to the receptor complex such as the exchange protein activated by cAMP or PKA-anchoring proteins (Dodge-Kafka et al, 2005). These possibilities will be addressed in future studies.

Collectively, our findings demonstrate that stimulation of beta1AR and beta2AR has opposing effects on PDE4D recruitment in the membrane subdomain, with beta1AR occupancy causing a local decrease, whereas beta2AR promotes a local increase in PDE4. A critical role of PDE4s in the submembrane microdomain has been described using a modified CNG channel as a sensor for cAMP accumulation (Rich et al, 2001). The dynamic localization of different PDE4D splicing variants that we report, as well as their phosphorylation state, likely play a major role in controlling cAMP accumulation in this submembrane space. This view is consistent with the alterations in local cAMP accumulation observed in PDE4D-deficient cardiomyocytes (Lehnart et al, 2005). More importantly, the PDE4DKO mouse develops a late onset dilated cardiomyopathy and a propensity to arrhythmias during exercise (Lehnart et al, 2005). PDE4D-deficiency in the cardiac ryanodine receptor/calcium release channel (RyR2) complex has been associated with this phenotype. Lack of PDE4D causes PKA hyperphosphorylation of RyR2 and calstabin depletion from the channel, resulting in a 'leaky' RyR2 channel phenotype that, in turn, may contribute to cardiac arrhythmias. However, disruption of other PDE4D complexes in the PDE4DKO mouse most likely contributes to the development of the cardiac phenotype. The lack of PDE4D in the beta1AR complex and the aberrant beta1AR responses described in the present study may well contribute to the onset of hypertrophy and heart failure. The observed increased receptor phosphorylation that follows PDE4D deficiency (Figure 6) promotes progressive desensitization (Figure 7) and downregulation of this receptor, a hallmark in heart failure.

Recombinant Flag-tagged betaARs and Myc-tagged PDE4D splice variants were detected in western blots using antibodies against their respective tags (mouse monoclonal alpha-Flag AB, Sigma Aldrich; mouse monoclonal alpha-Myc AB, Roche Applied Sciences). Endogenous (Figures 1C and 2C) and untagged PDE4D isoforms (Figure 3D; Supplementary Figures 1 and 2D) were detected using a mouse monoclonal PAN-PDE4D reactive antibody raised against the PDE4D C-terminus that is common to all splice variants (Icos4D). PAN-selective antibodies against PDE4A (AC55), PDE4B (K118), and PDE4D (M3S1), as well as splice variant-selective antibodies against PDE4D3, 4, 5, 8, and 9 (Richter et al, 2005), were used in IPs to determine the expression of the respective PDE4 subtype and splice variant in cardiac myocytes (Figure 2), as well as their PKA-dependent activation after beta-adrenergic stimulation (Figure 5; Supplementary Figure 2). A PKA-site-specific antibody from Cell Signaling (Danvers, MA) was used to measure PKA phosphorylation of the beta1AR (Figure 6). Antibodies against beta-arrestins and PDE3A were kindly provided by Dr R Lefkowitz and Dr C Yan, respectively.

Cloning of the open reading frames of the nine rat PDE4D splice variants, PDE4D1-9, has been described previously (Richter et al, 2005). In the present study, these constructs were subcloned into the pAd/CMV/V5-DEST vector to generate adenoviruses encoding for C-terminally Myc-tagged PDE4D variants using the ViraPower Adenoviral Expression System (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). Constructs encoding catalytically inactive PDE4D variants were generated by mutation of a critical histidine residue in the catalytic site of PDE4D to alanine (His326 in PDE4D3). Adenoviruses encoding Flag-tagged beta1AR and beta2AR were generated using the pAdenovator system (Q-Biogene, Irvine, CA) according to the manufacturer's instructions.

Ventricular cardiac myocytes were isolated from the excised hearts of 1-2 day old neonatal mice as described previously (Devic et al, 2001). They were cultured in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% Nu Serum IV (BD Falcon), 5% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 1 mM glutamine, 20 mug/ml gentamycin, and 1 x ITS media supplement (Sigma) on plates precoated with 10 mug/ml laminin. Experiments were carried out on day 4 of culture. The use of animals for the experiments followed Stanford University guidelines and all experiments involving animals were approved by the Stanford University Administrative Panel on Laboratory Animal Care. HEK293 and MEF cells were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS, 1 mM glutamine, 30 mug/ml penicillin, and 100 mug/ml streptomycin. All cells were cultured at 37degreesC and under a 5% CO2 atmosphere. For expression of exogenous betaARs and/or PDE4D constructs, cells were infected with adenoviruses 40 h before experimentation at an MOI of 2-6 (HEK293), 20-40 (cardiac myocytes), and 100 (MEFs), respectively. As 'mock' controls, cells were infected with comparable titers of an adenovirus encoding green fluorescent protein (GFP).

After the respective cell treatment, cells were rinsed once with ice-cold PBS and then lysed in 500 mul of 20 mM HEPES, 150 mM NaCl, 2 mM EDTA, 10% glycerol, 1% N-dodecyl-beta-D-maltopyranoside (DDM, Anatrace), 1 muM microcystin-LR (Calbiochem), and Complete protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche). Lysates were rotated at 4degreesC for 1 h, followed by centrifugation in 14 000 r.p.m. at 4degreesC for 20 min. Soluble extracts were precleared by a 30-min incubation with 30 mul of ProteinG Sepharose. Flag-tagged receptors were then immunoprecipitated using M1-affinity resin (alpha-Flag antibody resin; Sigma Aldrich). After incubation for 4 h at 4degreesC, the resin was washed three times and proteins were eluted in 40 mul of elution buffer (200 mug/ml Flag peptide, 20 mM HEPES, 50 mM NaCl, 0.1% cholesterol, and 8 mM EDTA).

Rat PDE4D3, expressed in Sf9 insect cells using a recombinant baculovirus, was purified to >90% purity using an anti-PDE4D antibody (M3S1) covalently coupled to ProteinG Sepharose as described previously (Salanova et al, 1998). Flag-tagged beta1AR and beta2AR were also expressed in Sf9 cells and subsequently purified in a two-step procedure consisting of an initial affinity chromatography using M1-resin (immobilized anti-Flag antibody; Sigma Aldrich), followed by an alprenolol-sepharose affinity column. For betaAR/PDE4D IP, equal amounts of purified beta1AR and beta2AR (1 mug) were coupled to M1 resin and then incubated in 500 mul of 20 mM HEPES (pH 7.5), 100 mM NaCl, 0.1% DDM, 4 mM CaCl2, and 0.01% cholesterol hemisuccinate with 0.5 mug of purified PDE4D under continuous rotation for 4 h at 4degreesC.

Spontaneously breathing animals were induced with 2% isoflurane and anesthesia was maintained thereafter using 1.25% isoflurane. A mouse pulse oximeter sensor (Mouse Ox, Starr Life Science Corp., Allison Park, PA) was then placed on the thigh of the mouse, and baseline heart-rate data were recorded for 5 min. To stimulate heterologous betaAR desensitization, GLP1 (3 mug in 250 mul saline; Sigma, St Louis, MO) was then given by tail vein injection. When the heart rate in response to GLP1 injection had peaked (determined as a return from maximal change in heart rate by maximal 30%), a submaximal dose of (-)-ISO bitartrate (1.5-3.0 mug in 250 mul saline; Sigma, St Louis, MO) was given by intraperitoneal injection. Data were then acquired until heart rate returned to the animal's baseline. The data collected was subsequently analyzed using Windaq waveform Browser software (DATAQ Instruments). PDE4DKO and wild-type control mice used in this study were on the same genetic background and were matched by sex (six males and one female each) and age (average age=7.3+/-2.8 months).

PDE4D in the beta1AR complex controls local PKA activity. (A, B) Neonatal cardiac myocytes expressing a Flag-tagged beta1AR were treated for 3 min with 100 nM Norepinephrine before cell lysis and IP with M1 (alpha-Flag) resin. The effect of a 5 min pre-treatment with 10 muM of the PDE4-specific inhibitor, Rolipram, or the PDE3-selective inhibitor, Cilostamide, on PKA-phosphorylation of the beta1AR is detected in IBs using a PKA-site-specific antibody. (C, D) MEFs derived from mice deficient in PDE4D or wild-type controls were infected with adenovirus to express a Flag-tagged beta1AR construct. At 40 h post-infection, cells were treated for 3 min with 100 nM Norepinephrine (NorEpi) before cell lysis and IP with M1 (alpha-Flag) resin. PKA-phosphorylation of the beta1AR is detected in IB using a PKA-site-specific antibody. (E, F) Neonatal cardiac myocytes coexpressing a Flag-tagged beta1AR and either GFP, a catalytically inactive PDE4D8 construct (PDE4D-DN; see also Supplementary Figure 5), or a catalytically inactive PDE3A1 (PDE3A1-DN) were subjected to alpha-Flag(M1)-IP, and the phosphorylation of the beta1AR was subsequently detected in IB using a PKA-substrate-specific antibody. Quantification of all results (B, D, F) is expressed as the means+/-s.e.m. of three experiments performed. NS (P⩾0.05; *(P<0.05); **(P<0.005).

PDE4D ablation promotes desensitization of beta1AR signaling in vivo. Anesthetized mice were sequentially injected with GLP1 followed by a submaximal dose of ISO as described in Materials and methods and the heart rate of the animals was continuously recorded using pulse oximeter sensor (B). Control mice received ISO only (A). The decline in heart rate after ISO injection in PDE4DKO and wild-type control mice is reported. Data are expressed as percent of the initial, maximal heart rate in response to ISO injection. Number of mice used for each measurement is reported among brackets.

Schematic representation of the distinct modes of PDE4 interaction with betaAR subtypes. Although both beta1AR and beta2AR form signaling complexes with PDE4D splice variants, the complexes formed by the two receptors are clearly distinguished by the different PDE4D variants recruited to the receptors (PDE4D8 to beta1AR versus PDE4D5 to beta2AR), the mode of interaction with PDE4D (direct for beta1AR versus beta-arrestin mediated for beta2AR), and the effect of receptor agonists (induces dissociation or formation of the complex). In the case of beta1AR, a preformed complex with PDE4D8 that is likely responsible for controlling local cAMP concentration and PKA activity in the vicinity of the receptor under basal conditions is dissociated upon ligand binding. Conversely, beta2AR is not associated with PDE4D under basal conditions but a preformed complex consisting of beta-arrestin and the PDE4D splice variant, PDE4D5, is recruited to the beta2AR after receptor occupancy. It remains to be determined to what extent PDE4D9, which is activated after both beta1AR and beta2AR stimulation (Figure 5) and which also showed interaction with beta1AR in co-IPs of exogenous proteins (Figure 3A and B), can substitute for interaction with the betaARs in vivo.
