Insulin-like growth factor binding protein 2 (IGFBP2) is overexpressed in ovarian malignant tissues and in the serum and cystic fluid of ovarian cancer patients, suggesting an important role of IGFBP2 in the biology of ovarian cancer. The purpose of this study was to assess the role of increased IGFBP2 in ovarian cancer cells.

Using western blotting and tissue microarray analyses, we showed that IGFBP2 was frequently overexpressed in ovarian carcinomas compared with normal ovarian tissues. Furthermore, IGFBP2 was significantly overexpressed in invasive serous ovarian carcinomas compared with borderline serous ovarian tumors. To test whether increased IGFBP2 contributes to the highly invasive nature of ovarian cancer cells, we generated IGFBP2-overexpressing cells from an SKOV3 ovarian cancer cell line, which has a very low level of endogenous IGFBP2. A Matrigel invasion assay showed that these IGFBP2-overexpressing cells were more invasive than the control cells. We then designed small interference RNA (siRNA) molecules that attenuated IGFBP2 expression in PA-1 ovarian cancer cells, which have a high level of endogenous IGFBP2. The Matrigel invasion assay showed that the attenuation of IGFBP2 expression indeed decreased the invasiveness of PA-1 cells.

Ovarian cancer is the most lethal gynecological malignancy. Indeed, epithelial ovarian cancer is detected at a late clinical stage in as much as 75% of patients, in whom the overall survival rate is a dismal 14-30% [1]. Hindering the development of effective treatments for the cancer is the fact that the molecular events responsible for the biological behavior of ovarian cancer are poorly understood. Implicated in both ovarian tumorigenesis and physiological follicular proliferation are the insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) and IGF-II systems. IGFs are regulated by at least six members of the IGF binding protein (IGFBP) family. High levels of IGFBP2 were detected in the serum or cystic fluid from patients with ovarian cancer compared with those with benign and borderline tumors [2-4]. A recent study further showed that IGFBP2 mRNA was overexpressed to a greater extent in advanced-stage serous ovarian cancer than normal ovarian tissue [5]. In addition, the increase in IGFBP2 expression was found to correlate positively with the levels of the serum tumor marker CA125 [4]. The progression-free interval and overall survival have also proved to be significantly shorter in patients with a high serum level of IGFBP2 at diagnosis than in those with lower levels [6]. Taken together, these data suggest an important role for IGFBP2 in the biology of ovarian cancer.

IGFBP2 is also overexpressed in a wide spectrum of other cancers, including glioma, prostate cancer, synovial sarcoma, neuroblastoma, colon cancer, adrenocortical cancer, lung cancer, Wilms' tumor, and hepatoblastoma [7-17]. The overexpression of IGFBP2 also correlates with the aggressiveness of some tumors, including prostate cancer, hepatoblastoma and glioma [10,17,18], suggesting that IGFBP2 possesses a carcinogenic property. The observation that IGFBP2 has an RGD motif suggests that IGFBP2 modulates the integrin/cytoskeleton system. Indeed, IGFBP2 was recently found to interact with the alpha v beta 3 and alpha 5 beta 1 integrins [19,20]. In addition, IGFBP2 has been found to stimulate the growth of prostate cancer cells, an effect that can be blocked by MAP-kinase and PI3-kinase inhibitors [21]. IGFBP2 was also found to be co-expressed with the vascular endothelial growth factor in pseudopalisading glioma cells surrounding tumor necrosis [22]. Further, IGFBP2 enhances glioma cell invasion by increasing invasion-related genes including MMP2 [23]. These findings collectively suggest that IGFBP2 plays a key role in human cancer development.

We first performed western blotting analysis using frozen tissue specimens, which consisted of four paired normal and carcinomatous ovarian tissues, one normal ovarian tissue, and three unpaired ovarian carcinoma tissues. This result showed that IGFBP2 was frequently overexpressed in ovarian cancer tissues compared with normal ovarian tissues (Figure 1A). We then compared the expression of IGFBP2 in normal ovaries, borderline serous ovarian tumors, and invasive serous ovarian carcinomas using a tissue microarray, which showed that IGFBP2 was expressed at significantly different levels between normal tissues and borderline tumors (p = 0.03) and between borderline tumors and invasive carcinomas (p = 0.03) (Figure 1B, Table 1). Because borderline ovarian tumors have no obvious stromal invasion or infiltrative growth in contrast with invasive ovarian carcinoma [24], this finding suggests that IGFBP2 overexpression could induce invasion nature of ovarian cancer.

Thus far, the biological or pathophysiological role of IGFBP2 in ovarian cancer is unknown. To elucidate the role of increased IGFBP2 in ovarian cancer, we therefore generate IGFBP2-overexpressing cells. To obtain suitable cells for this study, we first examined the endogenous expression of IGFBP2 in six ovarian cancer cell lines: NIH:OVCAR3, SKOV3, PA-1, OV-90, TOV-112D, and TOV-21G. IGFBP2 was expressed at different levels in all six cell lines (Figure 2A). Both SKOV3 and OV-90 cells showed very low levels of endogenous IGFBP2; NIH:OVCAR3, PA-1, and TOV-112D cells expressed IGFBP2 at high levels; and TOV-21G cells expressed IGFBP2 at a relatively moderate level. We thus selected SKOV3 cell line and generated two vector transfected clones and three IGFBP2-overexpressing clones by transfection (Figure 2B).

IGFBP2 overexpressing promotes ovarian cancer cell invasion. (A) IGFBP2 expression of six ovarian cancer cell lines. The western blotting analysis shows that the expression level of IGFBP2 is heterogeneous in cell lines. SKOV3 and OV-90 ovarian cancer cell lines have very low endogenous IGFBP2. NIH:OVCAR3, PA-1 and TOV-112D have high levels of IGFBP2 expression whereas TOV-21G has relatively moderate expression of IGFBP2. (B) Two vector transfected clones and three IGFBP2 stable clones with different expression level were obtained. The expression of IGFBP2 was determined by western blotting analysis (p: parental SKOV3 cell line, v: vector transfected cell lines, b: IGFBP2 stable cell lines). (C) The invasion capacity of stable clones showed that IGFBP2 overexpressing cells have invasion potential as 1.84 - 2.89 fold as parental and vector transfected cells. (*p < 0.05)

We studied the cellular phenotype of IGFBP2-overexpressing cell lines. Similar to observations in gliomas [23], we did not observe differences in cell proliferation (data not shown). This is contrary to the findings in prostate cancer, adenocortical cancer and neuroblastoma, in which IGFBP2 has been found to stimulate cell proliferation [21,25,26]. We then assessed the invasive capacity by a Matrigel in vitro invasion assay. The invasiveness of the IGFBP2-overexpressing cells was 1.8- to 2.9-fold greater than that of the vector-alone-transfected cells (p < 0.05; Figure 2C). Our tissue microarray findings were consistent with this finding. This suggests that acquisition of IGFBP2 is a very important step in the penetration of the extracellular matrix by ovarian cancer cells, which they may need to do before they can move to adjacent tissue and the lymphovascular space. This provides a site for occult progression or the formation of recurrent ovarian cancers. Indeed, ovarian cancer frequently spreads through the lymphatic system [27]. In fact, in one study, 20% of patients with early-stage invasive ovarian carcinoma whose tumors appeared to be confined to the ovary (stage I disease) were found to have lymph node metastasis [28]. The mortality rate in such patients is higher than that in patients without lymph node metastasis [29]. Our study therefore also provides strong evidence that IGFBP2 could be a factor indicating a poor prognosis.

The observation that IGFBP2 increased the invasive capacity of ovarian cancer cells and those of previous studies prompted us to determine whether IGFBP2 could serve as a target of therapy for ovarian cancer. We used PA-1 ovarian cancer cells for this experiment because they express a high level of endogenous IGFBP2 and show a relatively high invasive capacity compared with other ovarian cancer cell lines. We designed siRNAs for four different target sites of IGFBP2 mRNA because not all siRNAs were expected to effectively attenuate IGFBP2 expression. Western blotting analysis showed that the IGFBP2 level after siRNA-3 transfection was comparable to the levels after the transfection of Lamin A/C and negative control siRNA in OVCAR3 and PA-1 ovarian cancer cell lines, suggesting that the siRNA-3 was not effective (Figure 3A). Considering that not all siRNA molecules work, this was not surprising. Therefore, we used siRNA-3-transfected cells as a negative control. siRNA-1 and siRNA-4 attenuated IGFBP2 expression in the PA-1 cells more than did either siRNA-2 or siRNA-3 (Figure 3B). Likewise, in the invasion assay, the invasive capacity of the cells transfected with siRNA-1 or siRNA-4 was significantly decreased compared with that of the cells transfected with siRNA-2 or siRNA-3 (p < 0.05; Figure 3C). These findings therefore support to the notion that IGFBP2 is a viable target of therapy for ovarian cancer.

In this study, we showed that IGFBP2 was significantly overexpressed in invasive ovarian carcinomas compared with borderline ovarian tumors as well as normal ovarian tissues and that IGFBP2 increases invasion capability of ovarian cancer cells. These results provide evidence that IGFBP2 could promote ovarian cancer progression by augmenting the invasion potential. Although further investigations of molecular mechanisms are required, our findings using siRNA study support IGFBP2 as a novel target for the treatment of ovarian cancer.

Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded archival tissue blocks from ovarian cancer patients who had undergone surgery at The University of Texas M. D. Anderson Cancer Center between 1990 and 2001 were used to construct progression tissue microarrays according to previously described methods [30]. The progression tissue microarray consisted of normal ovarian surface epithelium from 6 individuals, serous borderline tumors from 17 patients, and invasive serous carcinomas from 40 patients. Tissue cores with a diameter of 1.0 mm were obtained from each sample and assembled into two separate tissue array blocks.

Polyclonal antibody against IGFBP2 (c-18; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA) was used in the immunohistochemistry studies. This antibody is specific and does not cross-react with other isoforms of IGFBP. A standard indirect immunoperoxidase procedure (ABC-Elite; Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) was used for all stains. In brief, antigen retrieval was performed by first placing unstained slides in a steamer for 25 min. The antibody against IGFBP2 (in a 1:1000 dilution) was overlaid on the tissue sections of tissue arrays, and incubation was performed at 4degreesC overnight. Secondary antibody incubation was performed at room temperature for 60 min. Mayer's hematoxylin nuclear stain was used as a counterstain. Staining intensity was graded on a 0-3 scale, where 0 = no staining as assessed by staining with anti-goat secondary antibody alone, 1 = weak (<10%), 2 = moderate (10-50%), and 3 = strong (50-100%). The results of the immunohistochemistry studies were statistically analyzed using a Mann-Whitney nonparametric U test.
