Proteins of the D-E-A-D family of putative ATP-dependent RNA helicases have been implicated in translation initiation and RNA splicing in a variety of organisms from E. coli to man. The Drosophila vasa protein, a member of this family, is required in the female germ line for fertility and for specification of germ line and posterior positional information in progeny embryos. We report the isolation of another D-E-A-D gene from Drosophila, which, like vasa, is expressed in germ line tissue. The predicted amino acid sequence of this new gene, Dbp73D, contains all of the highly conserved helicase motifs, but is otherwise the farthest-diverged member of the family so far identified.
