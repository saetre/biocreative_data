Two recombinant clones, pA2 and pA3, containing cDNA sequences for human aldolase B have been isolated from a full length human liver cDNA library. The larger one, pA3, has been subcloned in M13 phage and completely sequenced with the chain terminator method. The sequence covers 1,600 nucleotides including the whole coding region (1,050 nucleotides), 67 nucleotides from the 5' non-coding region and the whole 3' non-coding region, 440 nucleotides long, down to the poly-A tail. Comparison with rabbit aldolase A and with a partial sequence of rat aldolase B, shows a homology of about 76% for aldolase A and of about 94% for aldolase B, which indicates that the sequenced cDNA codes for the liver isoenzyme. This is the first complete sequence reported for human aldolase B. The pA3 clone strongly hybridizes to 18S mRNA from human adult liver as expected from the size of the isolated cDNA.
