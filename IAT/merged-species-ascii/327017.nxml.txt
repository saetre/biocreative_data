We present the sequence of gene malK which encodes a component of the system for maltose transport in E.coli K12. We also determined the position of deletion (S50) which fuses malK to the following gene lamB; the malK-lamB protein hybrid contains all of the malK protein. The mRNA corresponding to the last two thirds of gene malK could form stable stem and loop structures. The malK protein, as deduced from the gene sequence, would include 370 residues and correspond to a molecular weight of 40700. The sequence as well as sequence comparisons with the ndh protein of E.coli are discussed in terms of the location and function of the malK protein.
