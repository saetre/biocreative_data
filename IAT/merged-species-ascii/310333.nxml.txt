Numerous genes contain promoter elements that are nuclease hypersensitive. These elements frequently possess polypurine/polypyrimidine stretches and are usually associated with altered chromatin structure. We have previously isolated a clone that binds a class of CT-rich promoter elements. We have further characterized this clone, termed the nuclease-sensitive element protein-1, or NSEP-1. NSEP-1 binds both duplex CT elements and the CT-rich strand of these elements in a 'generic' sequence specific manner and has overlapping but distinct single-and double-strand DNA binding domains. The minimal peptide region sufficient for both duplex and single-strand DNA binding includes two regions rich in basic amino acids flanking an RNP-CS-1 like octapeptide motif. Deletion analysis shows that the single-strand DNA binding activity is mediated by the RNP-CS-1 like octapeptide motif and is the key peptide region necessary for single-strand binding. NSEP-1's affinity for CT rich promoter elements with strand asymmetry in addition to its double- and single-strand DNA binding properties suggests that it may be a member of a class of DNA binding proteins that modulate gene expression by their ability to recognize DNA with unusual secondary structure.
