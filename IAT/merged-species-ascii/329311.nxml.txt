The HMGI-C protein is a nuclear phosphoprotein expressed at high levels in transformed cells. The cDNA encoding the mouse protein has been isolated and the sequence of the encoded protein shows that it is related to the HMGY and I proteins, proteins which bind in the minor groove of DNA containing stretches of A and T. The HMGI-C protein has three short highly basic domains, an acidic C-terminal domain, and potential CDC2/p34 and casein kinase II phosphorylation sites. Analysis of mRNA levels demonstrate that the HMGI-C gene is not expressed in a variety of mouse tissues but is expressed in Lewis lung carcinoma cells.
