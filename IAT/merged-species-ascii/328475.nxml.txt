A complementary DNA (cDNA) encoding a mouse TFIID (mIID) was isolated from mouse brain cDNA libraries. The 316 amino acid sequence deduced from cDNA sequences revealed the presence of an amino-terminal region enriched in serine, threonine, and proline (STP-cluster), an uninterrupted stretch of 13 glutamine residues (Q-run), a second STP-cluster, and a conserved carboxy-terminal region. Amino acid sequences of the first STP-cluster and the conserved carboxy-terminal region were identical to those of the human TFIID (hIID). However, the Q-run was considerably shorter than that in hIID and sequences in the second STP-cluster diverged from those of the hIID. The murine TFIID transcript is expressed as a 2 kilobase poly(A)+ RNA in the mouse brain. Southern blot analysis identified a single gene copy per haploid mouse genome.
