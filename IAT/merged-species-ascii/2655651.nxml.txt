Hydrocephalus with hop gait (hyh) is a recessive inheritable disease that arose spontaneously in a mouse strain. A missense mutation in the Napa gene that results in the substitution of a methionine for isoleucine at position 105 (M105I) of alphaSNAP has been detected in these animals. alphaSNAP is a ubiquitous protein that plays a key role in membrane fusion and exocytosis. In this study, we found that male hyh mice with a mild phenotype produced morphologically normal and motile sperm, but had a strongly reduced fertility. When stimulated with progesterone or A23187 (a calcium ionophore), sperm from these animals had a defective acrosome reaction. It has been reported that the M105I mutation affects the expression but not the function of the protein. Consistent with an hypomorphic phenotype, the testes and epididymides of hyh mice had low amounts of the mutated protein. In contrast, sperm had alphaSNAP levels indistinguishable from those found in wild type cells, suggesting that the mutated protein is not fully functional for acrosomal exocytosis. Corroborating this possibility, addition of recombinant wild type alphaSNAP rescued exocytosis in streptolysin O-permeabilized sperm, while the mutant protein was ineffective. Moreover, addition of recombinant alphaSNAP. M105I inhibited acrosomal exocytosis in permeabilized human and wild type mouse sperm. We conclude that the M105I mutation affects the expression and also the function of alphaSNAP, and that a fully functional alphaSNAP is necessary for acrosomal exocytosis, a key event in fertilization.

Intracellular transport of macromolecules is an essential process in cell physiology. Most steps of this process require apposition and fusion of membrane-bound compartments. Soluble N-ethylmaleimide sensitive factor attachment protein alpha (alphaSNAP) is a ubiquitous protein present in all eukaryotic cells playing a key role in membrane fusion [1]. It participates in the activation of SNAP receptors (SNAREs), which are membrane associated proteins necessary for membrane fusion [2]. SNAREs localizing in the same compartment form cis SNARE complexes, which are inactive [3]. alphaSNAP binds to these complexes and recruits N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor (NSF), an ATPase that catalyzes the disruption of the complexes rendering active monomeric SNARE proteins. Activated SNAREs in the compartments that are going to fuse form trans complexes (i.e., SNAREs in one membrane bound to complementary SNAREs in the opposite membrane) bringing the two membranes in close proximity and promoting lipid mixing and membrane fusion.

Regulated secretion requires the fusion of exocytic granules with the plasma membrane and depends on alphaSNAP [4]-[6]. In particular we have documented that this protein is necessary for acrosomal exocytosis in human sperm [7]. The acrosome is a large membrane-limited granule that overlies the nucleus of mature sperm [8]. When in contact with the extracellular matrix surrounding the oocyte -named zona pellucida-, the spermatozoon undergoes acrosomal exocytosis. This secretory process releases a set of enzymes that facilitates the penetration of the zona pellucida and exposes membrane domains in the sperm that are important for fertilization. Interestingly, in resting sperm SNAREs are engaged in cis complexes [9]. Upon initiation of the acrosomal exocytosis, alphaSNAP -in association with NSF- disassembles cis SNARE complexes that can then form trans complexes and drive membrane fusion.

Many diseases have been associated to mutations in proteins involved in intracellular transport [10]. In particular, hydrocephalus with hop gait (hyh) is a recessive mouse disease that arose spontaneously in the C57BL/10J strain [11]. Affected mice exhibit dilatation of the cerebral ventricles at birth and develop hopping gait. However, heterogeneous phenotype expression has been recently described [12]. It has been shown that Napa -the gene encoding for alphaSNAP- is mutated in hyh mice [13], [14]. A G-->A missense mutation in exon 4 causes the substitution of a highly conserved methionine for isoleucine at position 105 (M105I) in one of the alpha-helical domains of the protein.

The aim of this study was to asses whether the M105I mutation in alphaSNAP could affect the sperm acrosome reaction, and hence, the fertility of hyh male mice. Our results show that animals displaying a slowly progressive phenotype produce morphologically normal and motile sperm, but have strongly reduced fertility. We demonstrate that these cells have a defective acrosomal exocytosis due to a functional deficiency of alphaSNAP. Moreover, we show that alphaSNAP carrying the M105I mutation is not fully functional for the acrosome reaction.

We have previously described that hyh mice present a heterogenous neuropathological and clinical phenotype [12]. Seventy percent of mutant mice develop a rapidly progressive (RP) phenotype and most of them die during the first two months of life. However, 30% of them grow with a mild or slowly progressive (SP) phenotype and survive for up to 2 years [12]. The more affected animals (RP) have substantial ventricular dilatations, small testes (42.1+/-1.1 mg; n = 8), and strongly diminished number of sperm (Fig. 1). In contrast, SP mice have moderate ventricular dilatation and almost normal testis size (wild type, 91.6+/-2.3 mg, n = 20; SP, 83.1+/-1.8 mg, n = 16; mean+/-SEM) and sperm count in the cauda epididymidis (Fig. 1).

Hyh mice from the RP group developed a very severe hydrocephalus. On the other hand, mutant mice from the SP group developed a mild hydrocephalic process and less neuropathological alterations. Brains from wild type (normal phenotype), and SP hyh and RP hyh mice from the same litter (70 day old) were fixed with Bouin solution by vascular perfusion and coronally sectioned at the level of the optic chiasm. Representative images of brain and cerebral ventricles phenotypes are shown. Images of the testes from the same animals are shown below.

SP mice present a preserved general motor activity [12] and are able to copulate; a vaginal plug was normally observed in their female partners. However, male fertility was strongly reduced (Table 1). To rule out any problem affecting the complex processes occurring upstream of gamete interaction (i.e., mating behavior, ejaculation, etc.), fertilization was assessed in vitro (Table 2). This protocol showed a remarkable difference in fertilizing probability between sperm from wild type and SP mice. Even duplicating the concentration of sperm from hyh mice used in the assay (Table 2, experiment B) the fertilization was not as efficient as when sperm from wild type mice were used. In conclusion, the sperm from SP mice have a strongly reduced fertilizing ability.

Several causes can render a spermatozoon unable to fertilize an oocyte. We analyzed the morphology, viability, and motility of SP sperm. The results summarized in Fig. 2 show that cells collected from the cauda epididymidis had a normal aspect and an apparently unaltered acrosome. They also presented a pattern of viability and motility undistinguishable from wild type sperm. Moreover, spontaneous acrosome reaction was similar in sperm from wild type and mutated mice (Fig. 3). However, when these cells were incubated under capacitating conditions and challenged with progesterone, a strongly reduced acrosome reaction was observed in sperm from mutated animals (Fig. 3). This phenomenon was observed even when acrosome reaction was induced with the calcium ionophore A23187, indicating that the defect was not in the signal transduction mechanism opening the calcium channels that triggers exocytosis but in the mechanism of exocytosis itself (Fig. 3).

It has been previously reported that the amount of alphaSNAP is strongly reduced in the brain of hyh mice, indicating that the mutation causes an alteration in the steady state balance of this protein [13], [14]. As the expression of alphaSNAP protein has not been previously described in mouse male reproductive tract (except in spermatogenic cells, [15], we decided to investigate the presence and distribution of this protein in testis, epididymis and sperm of wild type and SP mice. The hypothesis was that the abnormal acrosome reaction observed in sperm from SP mice is caused by low levels of alphaSNAP in these cells. As it has been described in the brain, the Western blot analysis revealed that the amount of alphaSNAP was strongly reduced in testes from SP mice. Similarly, decreased levels of alphaSNAP were found in the epididymis of SP mice, a finding that was more evident when sperm were washed out from the epididymal lumen (Fig. 4A and 4B). We also evaluated the expression of NSF, the ATPase that works in association with alphaSNAP to disassemble SNARE complexes. Interestingly, the amount of NSF was not decreased in testes and epididymides of SP mice; on the contrary, a small but consistent increase was observed (Fig. 4A and 4C).

Supporting the results obtained by Western blot, a strong difference in alphaSNAP immunostaining was observed in the seminiferous epithelium from wild type and SP animals (Figure 5). This difference was evident in pre- and post-meiotic cellular stages, including spermatogonia, primary spermatocytes and round spermatids. However, the immunoreactive pattern of elongated spermatids in mutant animals was very similar to that found in wild type mice. To evaluate if the immunostaining pattern observed in elongated spermatids was maintained in mature sperm, the amount of alphaSNAP was assessed by Western blot in spermatozoa obtained from cauda epididimydis. The results showed that the alphaSNAP protein level in sperm from SP mice was identical to that found in wild type cells, and that NSF was -as in the other tissues- slightly increased (Fig. 6A and 6B). Immunofluorescence for alphaSNAP also showed a similar pattern in sperm from wild type and SP mice (Fig. 6C). A distinct acrosomal labeling was observed (Fig. 6C), which disappeared when the antibody was absorbed with recombinant alphaSNAP (data not shown). In conclusion, the testis and epididymis of SP mice present a reduced concentration of alphaSNAP. In contrast, the amount and distribution of this protein is normal in mature sperm from SP mice.

The above results indicate that the acrosomal exocytosis defect in hyh mice was not due to a diminished amount of alphaSNAP. A possible explanation for this observation is that the low concentrations of alphaSNAP in the testis and epididymis alter the normal maturation of the exocytic machinery of the sperm. Hence, even with a normal quantity of the protein, the sperm may be unable to exocytose. To test this hypothesis, we assessed whether we could restore exocytosis by adding wild type alphaSNAP to sperm from SP mice. To this end, we set up a plasma membrane-permeabilized mouse sperm model similar to the one we routinely use for human sperm [16], [17]. The percentage of permeabilized cells without acrosome under resting conditions was 16% higher than that found in untreated cells (compare Fig. 7 with Fig. 3), suggesting that some sperm may have lost their acrosome during the permeabilization procedure. However, upon stimulation with calcium, an additional 18% of the cells reacted (Fig. 7), indicating that the treatment did not inactivate the exocytic machinery. A similar percentage of calcium induced exocytosis in permeabilized sperm has been previously reported by us [16] and by other authors [18]. In contrast, sperm from mutated mice did not respond to calcium stimulation, in agreement with the results obtained with A23187 in intact cells (compare Fig. 7 with Fig 3). When wild type alphaSNAP was added to the assay, exocytosis was completely recovered, suggesting that the primary defect in these cells is a deficient amount of functional alphaSNAP and not an abnormal maturation of sperm in SP mice (Fig. 7). However, the previous Western blot analysis and immunofluorescence images showed that these cells have normal levels of alphaSNAP, suggesting that the M105I mutation affects directly the function of the protein. To test this possibility, a recombinant alphaSNAP.M105I protein was produced, purified, and added to permeabilized sperm from SP mice. The mutated protein was unable to rescue acrosomal exocytosis in these cells at 15 nM (Fig. 7), although a partial recovery was observed at 60 nM (data not shown). In conclusion, although carrying normal levels of alphaSNAP, hyh sperm cells have a deficient acrosome reaction because the mutated protein cannot support exocytosis with the same efficiency than the wild type molecule

The cells were then permeabilized and stimulated with buffer (control) or 0.5 mM CaCl2 (10 microM free Ca2+). When indicated, 15 nM recombinant wild type alphaSNAP (alphaSNAPwt) or the M105I mutant (alphaSNAP.M105I) were added to the assay. The samples were incubated for 15 min at 37degreesC. At the end of the incubation, the cells were spotted on slides and fixed in ice-cold methanol. Acrosomal status was evaluated in at least 200 sperm by staining with TRITC-PNA.

Although alphaSNAP is a required factor for intracellular transport, in some experimental models -including the acrosomal exocytosis- an excess of the wild type protein inhibits membrane fusion [7], [19]-[21]. Hence, we tested the effect of wild type and mutated proteins in the acrosomal exocytosis assay using permeabilized sperm from wild type mice. The results showed that M105I mutant had a dose-dependent inhibitory effect on exocytosis, whereas, in the same range of concentrations, the wild type protein could even improve secretion (Fig. 8A). To assess the effect of the M105I mutant in another model, the protein was added to permeabilized human sperm. In the range of concentration tested, wild type alphaSNAP did not affect secretion; in contrast, the M105I mutant was strongly inhibitory (Fig. 8B). None of the recombinant proteins affected basal exocytosis in the absence of calcium in both systems (data not shown). In conclusion, alphaSNAP.M105I, as compared with the wild type protein, has a reduced ability to restore exocytosis and an enhanced potency to inhibit the process, indicating that this mutation alters the functionality of the protein.

(A) Sperm from wild type mice were collected from the cauda epididymidis and incubated under capacitating conditions for 1 h. (B) Human sperm were collected from ejaculates as previously described [9]. Mouse and human cells were then permeabilized and stimulated with 10 microM free Ca2+ in the presence of different concentrations of wild type alphaSNAP (alphaSNAPwt) or the M105I mutant (alphaSNAP.M105I) for 15 min at 37degreesC. At the end of the incubation, the cells were spotted on slides and fixed in ice-cold methanol. Acrosomal status was evaluated in at least 200 sperm by staining with TRITC-PNA (mouse sperm) or FITC-PSA (human sperm). For each experiment, acrosomal exocytosis was normalized by subtracting the number of reacted spermatozoa in the non-stimulated samples (mean+/-SEM: 44.8%+/-4.3% and 11.7%+/-1.2%, for mouse and human sperm, respectively) from all values, and expressing the resulting values as a percentage of the acrosome reaction observed in cells stimulated with 10 microM free Ca2+ in the absence of added alphaSNAP (63.4%+/-3.7% and 23.7%+/-1.2%, for mouse and human sperm, respectively). The data represent the mean+/-SEM of three independent experiments. (*, significant differences with respect to wild type alphaSNAP, P<0.01, Student's t test).

The acrosome reaction is a special type of regulated secretion [22]. At fertilization, it is initiated by a complex signal transduction pathway triggered by the contact of the sperm membrane with components of the zona pellucida [8]. At the end of this pathway, cytoplasmic calcium increases and activates the membrane fusion machinery that opens hundred of pores connecting the acrosomal lumen with the extracellular medium. The expansion of these pores promotes the fenestration of the membrane and the formation of hybrid vesicles. Although with particular characteristic, acrosome exocytosis is a regulated secretion sharing the same basic mechanism of membrane fusion that has been described in other secreting cells, such as neurons and endocrine cells [22]. Moreover, the special features of the acrosomal exocytosis have proven useful to study several aspects of the secretion process that are more difficult to assess in other cells [23].

Acrosome reaction is a required event to achieve fertilization in mammals [8]. Enzymes present in the acrosomal granule must be released to facilitate sperm penetration through the zona pellucida. Hence, it would be expected that malfunctions in factors necessary for secretion would affect the fertilizing potential of sperm [24], [25]. However, since secretion is a key cellular function necessary for many survival mechanisms, most mutations in these factors render animals unable to survive to reproductive age. Interestingly, when they do survive, they are in many cases fertile, suggesting that compensatory mechanisms may overcome the malfunction or absence of some factors [26]. Hyh mouse harboring a point mutation in the Napa gen coding for alphaSNAP is the first example of a fertility problem directly related to a factor necessary for the general mechanism of regulated secretion that is specifically affecting the acrosome reaction. Mutant mice with a mild clinical and neuropathological phenotype are able to copulate and the amount of live and motile sperm that they produce is similar to that of wild type mice; however, they have a much reduced fertility. Even when fertilization was assessed in vitro, sperm from hyh mice behave poorly as compared with sperm from wild type mice. Notwithstanding, the difference between genotypes was less dramatic in the in vitro assays than in the mating studies. Thus, other defects not assessed by in vitro fertilization might contribute to this phenotype. In this context, although SP mice present a preserved general motor activity and are able to copulate, they do have gait and equilibrium impairments [12] that could affect the frequency and efficiency of copulation.

Acrosome reaction experiments indicate that the basic problem in sperm from hyh mice is a reduced capacity to undergo exocytosis upon stimulation with progesterone and even with a calcium ionophore. The fact that exogenous alphaSNAP can rescue acrosomal exocytosis in these cells is a strong evidence that the principal defect is a malfunction in the endogenous protein. Worth noticing is that the M105I mutation is in a region of alphaSNAP that does not interact with the SNARE complex [27]. Moreover, the protein can bind to and disassemble SNARE complexes in vitro in a way similar to the wild type protein [13], [14]. These observations, together with the fact that the hyh mouse presents a diminished amount of alphaSNAP in brain, have lead to the conclusion that the alteration in brain development in these animals is principally due to an insufficient amount of protein and not to a malfunction of the mutated molecule [13]. However, a functional defect of the mutated protein has never been ruled out [13], [14]. Our observations in sperm point to a different mechanism. We confirmed that the mutated protein has an altered steady state distribution in several tissues; the levels of alphaSNAP in testis and epididymis were significantly lower in the mutated animals. In contrast, we found normal amount of this protein in sperm. Therefore, it was unlikely that the defect in acrosomal exocytosis was due to a decreased amount of alphaSNAP. These observations suggested that the mutated protein has some intrinsic malfunction. This was confirmed by the fact that the mutated protein was less effective in restoring exocytosis than the wild type protein when added to permeabilized sperm from hyh mouse. Moreover, the mutated protein was inhibitory when added to normal mouse and human sperm. It is worth noticing that an excess of wild type alphaSNAP is also inhibitory, but at much higher concentrations [7]. Our results indicate that the M105I mutation alters the normal steady state balance of alphaSNAP and also affects its function. The protein may bind SNARE complexes and may promote their disassembly as the wild type protein [13], [14], but in the complexity of a cellular environment with several other interacting factors, the mutant behaves differently than the wild type protein in the acrosomal secretory processes. In fact, co-immunoprecipitation studies using brain lysates suggest that the M105I mutation may affect the alphaSNAP/SNARE complex interaction [14]. Relatively high concentrations of NSF -the other key factor for SNARE complex disassembly- were found in testis, epididymis, and sperm of hyh mice, likely as a compensatory response to the diminished amount of functional alphaSNAP in the cells.

The deletion of alphaSNAP is embryonically lethal in mice [13]; hence the M105I mutant must conserve a certain degree of functionality for intracellular transport and regulated exocytosis, but cannot support acrosomal exocytosis. alphaSNAP has a well characterized function in SNARE complex disassembly. In sperm it is necessary for the activation of SNARE proteins upon sperm stimulation [7]. However, it may have other still not well characterized functions [21] that may be altered in the M105I mutant. The methionine in the 105 position is well preserved along evolution. This residue is in the convex surface of the protein, opposite to the one supposed to bind SNARE complexes; however, mutation analyses indicate that this area is also important for alphaSNAP function [27]. All in all, the molecular mechanism for the mutant malfunction remains to be determined.

Metaphase II eggs were obtained from 6 to 8 week old wild type female mice superovulated by injection of 5 IU of pregnant mare serum gonadotrophin (PMSG; Syntex S.A., Argentina) followed 48 h later by 5 IU of human chorionic gonadotrophin (hCG; Syntex S.A., Argentina). Eggs were collected in Whitten's medium [28] containing 0.4% (w/v) polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) and 20 mM Hepes buffer at pH 7.4. Cumulus cells were removed using 0.3% hyaluronidase for 1-3 min in the same solution. Eggs were collected and placed immediately into the fertilization drop for in vitro fertilization. Mouse sperm were collected from 12-24 week old wild type and hyh male mice. Both cauda epididymides from a single male were placed in a 900 microl drop of human tubal fluid (HTF) medium [29] supplemented with 0.5% BSA. Several incisions were made in the tissue and the sperm allowed swimming into the medium for 20 min at 37degreesC. The resultant cell suspension was counted, adjusted to 7-10x106 sperm/ml, and incubated for 1 h at 37degreesC in an atmosphere of 5% CO2/95% air. Human semen samples were obtained from normal healthy donors. Highly motile sperm were recovered following a swim-up separation in HTF supplemented with 0.5% BSA for 1 h at 37degreesC in an atmosphere of 5% CO2/95% air. Concentration was adjusted to 5-10x106/ml, and incubation proceeded for at least 2 h.

Wild type and mutant sperm were collected as explained and adjusted to a concentration of 5-10x106 cells/ml in HTF. To determine morphology of sperm and acrosome, a 5 microl aliquot was stained with Coomassie G-250 [30] and observed under 100x oil immersion lens. To assess sperm plasmalemma integrity (i.e., viability), 10 microl of sperm suspension and 1 microl of Eosin-Y solution (5 g/l) were mixed, and the percentage of stained cells was determined by counting 200 sperm (bright-field microscopy, 100x oil immersion lens). To assess motility in a sample, at least 200 sperm in two independent aliquots were classified as having progressive or non-progressive motility, or being immotile (bright-field microscopy, 40x).

Coverslips were mounted in Gelvatol, and examined under a Zeiss Axioskop microscope equipped with epifluorescence optics and a digital camera (Nikon Coolpix 5000). Background was subtracted and brightness/contrast were adjusted in the images to render an all or nothing labelling pattern using Corel Draw version 12 (Corel, Ottawa, Ontario, Canada).

Proteins from hyh and wild type mice brain, testis and epidydimis were extracted by homogenizing in a modified RIPA buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 1% Triton-X-100, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS) with a protease inhibitor cocktail (P2714, Sigma Chemical Co.) plus 1 mM phenylmethanesulphonylfluoride (PMSF). The homogenates were centrifuged at 6000xg for 10 minutes at 4degreesC to sediment unbroken cells and nuclei. Supernatants were stored at -80degreesC until used. Sperm proteins were isolated according to [31].

For Western blotting, 2% (v/v) 2-mercaptoethanol was added to the samples. After boiling for 2 min, 15 microg (brain, testis, epidydimis) or 30 microg (sperm) of total protein were loaded on 10% polyacrylamide gels according to [32]. The proteins were then transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membranes (Millipore, Bedford, MA). Blots were incubated for 1-2 h at 37degreesC with the primary antibodies diluted in PBS containing 0.05% Tween 20 and 1% BSA (anti-alpha-SNAP, 1:1000; anti-NSF, 1:5000). Horseradish peroxidase conjugated goat anti-mouse-IgG was used as secondary antibody (0.25 microg/ml) with 30 min incubations. Excess antibodies were removed by washing 5x5 min in 1x PBS. Detection was accomplished with an enhanced chemiluminescence system (SuperSignal West Pico Chemiluminescent Substrate, Pierce, Rockford, IL) and subsequent exposure to Kodak XAR film (Eastman Kodak, Rochester, NY) for 5-30 s. In order to confirm equal loading of proteins, blots were stripped and re-probed with an antibody against actin (1:1000) or beta-tubulin (1:1000).

Motile sperm were obtained as explained above. In some experiments, spermatozoa without further treatment were used to study acrosome reaction. Permeabilization of human and mouse sperm was accomplished as previously described [17]. Briefly, washed spermatozoa were resuspended in cold PBS containing 0.4-1 units/ml SLO for 15 min at 4degreesC. Cells were washed once with PBS and resuspended in ice-cold sucrose buffer (250 mM sucrose, 0.5 mM EGTA, 20 mM Hepes-K, pH 7.0) containing 2 mM dithiothreitol. Permeabilized sperm were incubated, when indicated, with the recombinant proteins for 15 min at 37degreesC before adding the exocytosis stimulators. After stimulation of intact or permeabilized sperm, incubation proceeded at 37degreesC for 15 min. Acrosomal status was evaluated by staining with TRITC-PNA (mouse sperm) or FITC-PSA (human sperm). At least 200 cells were scored using a Zeiss Axioskop microscope equipped with epifluorescence optics.
