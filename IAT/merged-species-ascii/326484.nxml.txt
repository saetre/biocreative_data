We have examined the organization of the immunoglobulin JH segments in three clones derived from a single Abelson murine leukemia virus-transformed cell. Cloning and nucleotide sequence analyses of the JH-containing fragments have revealed the rearrangement from the preformed D-JH complex to the complete VH-D-JH gene, which was accompanied by the expression of the intra-cytoplasmic mu chain. In one case a JH segment downstream to the preformed D-JH was used to create a new VH-D-JH gene. Upon the D-JH and VH-D-JH rearrangements the intervening D segments were deleted from the chromosome. One of the expressed VH genes suffered from a large deletion of the 3' portion (including the 95th cysteine residue) of the VH segment. We discuss the possible mechanism of the allelic exclusion.
