Many proteins that bind RNA contain a common RNA-binding domain, the RNP motif. We have been studying two Drosophila RNP motif proteins, Hrb98DE and Hrb87F, which are hnRNA-binding proteins. We report here the characterization of the Rb97D gene, which encodes a protein that is closely related to the Hrb proteins in the RNP motif domain, but has a distinctive proline-rich C-terminal domain. The gene is located at 97D on the right arm of the third chromosome, near the rough gene. Multiple transcripts from the Rb97D gene are present at varying levels throughout development. The transcripts are generated by alternative processing in the coding and 3' untranslated regions, and can encode two protein isoforms. Analysis of a mutant containing a P element inserted into the 5' untranslated region of the gene demonstrates that Rb97D is required for male fertility. Possible models for the function of Rb97D in testes are discussed.
