Background
###end title 2
###begin p 3
The mixed-lineage kinase (MLK) family member DLK has been proposed to serve as a regulator of differentiation in various cell types; however, its role in adipogenesis has not been investigated. In this study, we used the 3T3-L1 preadipocyte cell line as a model to examine the function of DLK in adipocyte differentiation.

Methods and Findings
###end title 4
###begin p 5
Immunoblot analyses and kinase assays performed on 3T3-L1 cells showed that the expression and activity of DLK substantially increase as differentiation occurs. Interestingly, DLK appears crucial for differentiation since its depletion by RNA interference impairs lipid accumulation as well as expression of the master regulators of adipogenesis C/EBPalpha and PPARgamma2 at both the mRNA and protein levels. In contrast, neither the expression nor the DNA binding activity of C/EBPbeta, an activator for C/EBPalpha and PPARgamma, is affected by DLK loss.

Conclusions

###begin p 7
Taken together, these results suggest that DLK is important for expression of mature adipocyte markers and that its action most likely takes place via regulation of C/EBPbeta transcriptional activity and/or initiation of C/EBPalpha and PPARgamma2 gene transcription.

Adipose tissue, the main organ for energy storage and expenditure, secretes a variety of factors that maintain normal body metabolism [1]. Its accumulation, however, can result in obesity, which is a major risk factor for diseases such as diabetes and hypertension [2]-[6]. Change in adipose mass can arise from an increase in the size and the number of fat cells or adipocytes, the latter being accomplished by the proliferation of preadipocytes and their subsequent differentiation into mature adipocytes [7].

Due to the availability of preadipocyte cell lines such as 3T3-L1 and 3T3-F422A [8], which can be efficiently induced to undergo terminal differentiation when exposed to the appropriate adipogenic hormones, considerable progress in our understanding of adipocyte biology has been achieved in the past few years. Indeed, the process of adipocyte differentiation is governed by a tightly regulated cascade of transcription factors that are either activated or repressed at specific times during differentiation [9]-[11]. These variations in expression or activation lead to differential gene expression that will eventually guide precursor cells through their differentiation in adipocytes. Important members of this genetic cascade are the CCAAT/enhancer binding proteins (C/EBP) family members C/EBPbeta and C/EBPdelta, which are highly expressed early during differentiation [12]. C/EBPbeta and C/EBPdelta then elicit the expression of C/EBPalpha and the PPARgamma (Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma) isoform PPARgamma2, two transcription factors working in a cooperative manner to promote the expression of various adipocyte-specific genes [13]. Their ability to control the expression of genes responsible for glucose trafficking and mature adipocyte metabolism [11] indeed place them as key factors of adipocyte differentiation.

Besides transcription factors, a variety of extracellular and intracellular signaling molecules are also known to play key roles in adipocyte differentiation [11], [14]-[17]. Of particular interest to this study is the demonstration that mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) [18], which include extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERKs), p38 kinases and c-Jun N-terminal kinases (JNKs), modulate either positively or negatively adipogenesis as a result of their ability to regulate the proadipogenic transcription factors C/EBPbeta and PPARgamma [19], [20]. Recently, it has also been shown that MLK3, a JNK activator belonging to the mixed-lineage kinase (MLK) subgroup of MAPK kinase kinase (MAPKKK), plays a role in adipocyte differentiation [21]. Support for this notion derives from the observation that the expression and phosphorylation of C/EBPalpha and C/EBPbeta were significantly increased at early times during differentiation of mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEF) deficient in Mlk3 (MLK3-/-). Furthermore, it was found that MLK3-/- cells accumulate more lipids than wild-type MEF and that overexpression of MLK3 in these cells inhibited adipogenic differentiation.

In contrast to MLK3, which is widely expressed in many tissues [21], the MLK family member dual leucine zipper-bearing kinase (DLK) exhibits a more restricted pattern of expression [22], [23]. During development, expression of DLK mRNA has been primarily detected in neuronal tissues such as brain and spinal ganglion, as well as in the epithelia of the skin, intestine, pancreas, and kidney [22]. In all these tissues, the expression of DLK mRNA increases with development and correlates with areas undergoing terminal cell differentiation. Consistent with a causal role for DLK in differentiation, ectopic expression of DLK in normal human keratinocytes promotes their terminal differentation, as evidenced by up-regulation of filaggrin, DNA fragmentation and activation of transglutaminases [24]. Based on these observations, it thus appears likely that DLK may fulfill specific signaling functions required in either the induction or the maintenance of the differentiated state for a wide variety of cell populations. In keeping with this hypothesis, we demonstrate herein that DLK is expressed in mouse adipose tissue and that its expression dramatically increases during adipogenic differentiation of 3T3-L1 cells. In addition, our results show that 3T3-L1 cells depleted in DLK by specific shRNA failed to accumulate lipids or express C/EBPalpha and the adipocyte-specific PPARgamma2 isoform in response to adipogenic stimuli. Finally, we provide evidence that DLK depletion does not perturb the ability of C/EBPbeta to bind to the c/ebpalpha and ppargamma2 promoters, indicating that DLK acts upstream of the master adipogenesis regulators C/EBPalpha and PPARgamma2 but downstream of their activator C/EBPbeta.

Because DLK is expressed in a tissue-specific manner [22]-[24], it has been proposed to serve as a regulator of differentiation. To further characterize the function of DLK, we decided to investigate whether this protein is involved in adipocyte differentiation. This issue was first addressed by examining the protein levels of DLK in the adipose organ, which is composed in mammals of white and brown adipose tissues organized in various subcutaneous or visceral depots. White adipose tissue is specialized for lipid storage, whereas brown adipose tissue generates body heat [25]. Immunoblot analysis of various white (gonadal, retroperitoneal, omental, mesenteric and inguinal) and brown (intrascapular) adipose depots showed that DLK is expressed to high levels in both mesenteric white adipose and brown adipose tissue. In comparison, heart as well as gonadal, retroperitoneal, omental and inguinal white adipose tissue depots expressed barely detectable levels of DLK (Fig. 1 A). The presence of DLK in differentiating adipocytes was then assessed in a widely used model of adipogenesis, 3T3-L1 preadipocytes [8], that were induced to differentiate for different periods of time (2, 4, 6, 8 or 10 days). Differentiation of 3T3-L1 cells was confirmed by blotting total cell lysates with antibodies directed against the two PPARgamma isoforms, PPARgamma1 and PPARgamma2, and the mature adipocyte markers adiponectin and fatty acid synthase (FAS) (Fig. 1B). Interestingly, DLK expression in differentiating cells increased gradually until reaching a plateau from day 6 to day 10 of differentiation (Fig. 1B), and this increase paralleled that seen with the protein levels of PPARgamma1, PPARgamma2 and adiponectin, . Moreover, an immunocomplex kinase assay showed that DLK is active during differentiation of 3T3-L1 (Fig. 1C), reflecting the accumulation of DLK detected by immunobloting.

To explore the presence and activation of the MAPKs ERK, JNK and p38 in differentiating adipocytes, immunoblot analyses with antibodies specific to the phosphorylated, activated forms of these proteins were also performed. As shown in Fig. 1D, ERK was inactive in undifferentiated cells but became active from day 2 of differentiation onward. On the other hand, our results also demonstrated that JNK and p38 exist as constitutively phosphorylated proteins in 3T3-L1 preadipocytes, and upon differentiation of the cells, p38 activity progressively decreased while JNK activity increased to reach a maximum at day 4. Immunoblots processed in parallel with antibodies insensitive to the phosphorylation state of these MAPKs demonstrated that there was no apparent difference in the expression of either ERK, p38 or JNK during adipocyte differentiation, suggesting that their activity are positively or negatively regulated by the differentiation inducers.

To further characterize the role of DLK in adipogenesis, we silenced its expression in 3T3-L1 preadipocytes by RNA interference and stained cells for lipids with Oil Red O (ORO) at day 6 of differentiation. Knockdown of DLK was accomplished by infecting cells with a lentiviral vector carrying a short hairpin RNA (shRNA) that targets mouse DLK mRNA (mDLK). To exclude potential nonspecific effects, cells were also infected with an empty lentiviral vector (EV) or a lentiviral vector expressing a human DLK shRNA (hDLK). In some experiments, the vector for hDLK had slight effect on DLK expression in 3T3-L1 cells, but this was considered negligible when compared to cells infected with the sh-mDLK lentivirus. As depicted in Figure 2A, the sh-mDLK construct abolished almost completely DLK protein expression, whereas the empty or sh-hDLK vector had no such effect. The intracellular level of tubulin was also unaffected by any of these constructs. ORO staining clearly demonstrated that there was no obvious accumulation of lipids in DLK-depleted cells, as opposed to control cells (Fig. 2B). Lack of lipid accumulation could not be attributed to cell mortality, as preadipocyte-shaped undifferentiated cells were still visible after 6 days of differentiation (upper right corner, Fig 2B). Spectrophotometric analysis of the extracted neutral lipids confirmed that DLK-depleted cells were devoid of lipids when compared to cells infected with the control lentiviruses (Fig. 2C).

As a result of the finding that DLK depletion was inhibitory for accumulation of lipids in 3T3-L1 cells, we next sought to investigate whether the absence of DLK could disrupt the transcription factor cascade that mediates adipocyte differentiation. For this purpose, 3T3-L1 cells were infected with the empty lentivirus or lentiviruses expressing mouse or human DLK shRNA and induced to differentiate for 6 days. The expression levels of four transcription factors known to be involved in adipogenesis, namely C/EBPdelta, C/EBPbeta, C/EBPalpha and PPARgamma [26] were measured every two days by Western blotting with specific antibodies. As shown in Figure 3, cells infected with the sh-mDLK lentivirus showed a marked reduction of DLK protein expression compared with the control. This depletion of DLK proteins had no effect on the expression of C/EBPbeta and C/EBPdelta, which are induced early in the differentiation process [12]. In fact, both factors were indeed detectable at day 2 and 4 of differentiation, respectively, and decreased afterwards (Fig. 3). Interestingly, immunoblot analysis also demonstrated that the knockdown of DLK strongly reduced expression of two master regulators of adipogenesis, C/EBPalpha [27] and the PPARgamma2 isoform [28], which were induced as early as day 2 or day 4 of differentiation in cells infected with the control lentiviruses (Fig. 3). Accordingly, expression of the mature adipocyte markers adiponectin and FAS was impaired in DLK-depleted cells compared with cells infected with control lentiviruses. The effect of DLK depletion on C/EBPalpha and PPARgamma2 was not attributable to a change in the subcellular localization of C/EBPbeta, which is essential for their expression [29], since the presence of C/EBPbeta in the nucleus was confirmed by immunoblot analysis of nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions (data not shown). Moreover, the activity of JNK, which acts as a downstream effector of DLK signaling in various cell types [24], [30], [31], was also not affected by DLK knockdown. Taken together, these data suggest that the decrease of DLK not only prevents the accumulation of lipids, but also disrupts the whole differentiation program of 3T3-L1 by impairing the normal expression of C/EBPalpha and PPARgamma2.

Since DLK depletion abrogated the accumulation of C/EBPalpha, PPARgamma, adiponectin and FAS proteins in differentiating 3T3-L1 adipocytes, we next asked whether interruption of DLK signaling would lead to decreased expression of their encoding genes. To do this, we isolated total RNA from control or DLK-depleted cells at day 0, 2, 4 or 6 of differentiation and analyzed the expression of the C/EBPalpha, PPARgamma, adiponectin and FAS genes by quantitative RT-PCR (Fig. 4). For each gene examined during adipocyte differentiation, we observed that the amount of mRNA fluctuated in a pattern similar to that seen at the protein levels (Fig. 3). Hence, in either EV-, hDLK- or mDLK-infected cells, the levels of C/EBPbeta mRNA increased at day 2 of differentiation, like its protein counterpart, followed by a slight decrease in more differentiated 3T3-L1 adipocytes (Fig. 4A). However, for C/EBPalpha, PPARgamma, adiponectin and FAS mRNAs (Fig 4B to 4E), which are all induced later in adipogenesis, no increase of their expression levels was observed in mDLK-infected cells relative to control cells. These results indicate that DLK is required for expression of the C/EBPalpha, PPARgamma, adiponectin and FAS genes in differentiating adipocytes.

An important function of C/EBPbeta during adipocyte differentiation is to directly activate expression of C/EBPalpha and PPARgamma2 [29], [32]. Based on these data and our results showing that expression of C/EBPbeta was not attenuated by DLK depletion, we next investigated by chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays the binding activity of endogenous C/EBPbeta to the C/EBPalpha and PPARgamma2 promoters in 3T3-L1 cells infected with the different lentiviral constructs. DNA fragments immunoprecipitated by C/EBPbeta antibody at day 2 of differentiation, a time window where C/EBPbeta expression peaked, were amplified by PCR using primers covering C/EBPbeta binding sites within the C/EBPalpha and PPARgamma2 promoters. As shown in Fig. 5, we observed no change in C/EBPbeta binding activity at both promoters after DLK depletion, suggesting that loss of DLK does not impair C/EBPbeta's ability to stimulate transcription of C/EBPalpha and PPARgamma2 genes.

PPARgamma2 is a central regulator of adipogenesis [33], whose expression at the mRNA and protein levels is down-regulated in DLK-depleted 3T3-L1 cells. We therefore investigated whether the inhibitory effect of DLK depletion on adipocyte differentiation was specifically caused by prevention of the expression of PPARgamma2 and C/EBPalpha. To do so, we tested whether rosiglitazone, a well known PPARgamma ligand [34], could rescue differentiation of 3T3-L1 cells after DLK knockdown. 3T3-L1 cells were infected with the different lentiviruses and then subjected to the differentiation protocol for 6 days in the presence of rosiglitazone. Addition of rosiglitazone to mDLK-infected cells restored the characteristic lipid accumulation associated with adipocyte differentiation, although not to the extent seen in EV- and hDLK-infected cells (Fig. 6A). Spectrophotometric quantification of the extracted lipids showed that rosiglitazone-treated mDLK-infected cells accumulate approximately 75% of the lipids that are found in control cells (Fig 6A). Rosiglitazone treatment of DLK-depleted cells also rescued, at least in part, the expression of C/EBPalpha, PPARgamma2, adiponectin and FAS, as revealed by immunoblot analyses carried out at day 2, 4 and 6 of differentiation (Fig. 6B). Unexpectedly, an increase in DLK levels was also observed in rosiglitazone-treated control and DLK knockdown adipocytes, suggesting the potential involvement of an activated form of PPARgamma in DLK expression. Taken together, these results indicate that rosiglitazone can overcome the inhibitory effect of DLK depletion on adipocyte differentiation and suggest that the loss of DLK principally inhibits the differentiation program of 3T3-L1 cells by preventing the expression of PPARgamma2.

Adipogenesis is a complex process governed by a wide range of regulatory proteins, including transcription factors, kinases and hormones. Adding to this complexity, our results identify the MLK family member DLK as a novel regulator of adipocyte differentiation. Immunoblot analyses of various mouse adipose depots indeed demonstrated that DLK was specifically expressed in mesenteric white and brown adipose tissue, suggesting a role for this protein in differentiation and function of particular adipocyte subpopulations. Using the 3T3-L1 preadipocyte cell line as a model, we then showed that the protein level of DLK gradually increased upon differentiation like the adipogenic markers PPARgamma2, adiponectin and fatty acid synthase. This increase in DLK expression was paralleled by either an increase or decrease in phosphorylation of the MAPKs ERK, p38 and JNK, which are recognized to have both positive and negative regulatory effects on adipocyte differentiation [20]. Using gene silencing of DLK by RNA interference, we demonstrated that this protein is essential for lipid accumulation and expression of the two master regulators of adipocyte differentiation, C/EBPalpha and PPARgamma2 [27], [33], [35]. In agreement with this result, we found that DLK depletion was accompanied by decreased expression of adiponectin and fatty acid synthase that are downstream genes of C/EBPalpha, PPARgamma [36], [37] and SREBP-1c (sterol regulatory element binding protein 1 c), a transcription factor involved in fatty acid metabolism [38], respectively. This effect was reversed by the PPARgamma agonist rosiglitazone, suggesting that the absence of DLK does not impair the capacity of an activated form of PPARgamma to promote adipogenesis, and that DLK action takes place upstream of PPARgamma. The capacity of ligand-activated PPARgamma to rescue adipogenesis in DLK-depleted cells is in agreement with previous work showing the relative contribution of the two different PPARgamma isoforms, PPARgamma1 and PPARgamma2, to adipogenesis. In their study, using engineered 3T3-L1 cells devoid of PPARgamma1 and PPARgamma2, Ren et al. [28] demonstrated that only ectopic expression of PPARgamma2 can induce adipocyte differentiation in the absence of exogenous ligand. Although it is not clear why this difference is observed, Werman and colleagues [35] reported that PPARgamma2 contains a constitutive activation function in the N-terminus that is up to 10-fold stronger than that of PPARgamma1. Moreover, it has been found that the N-terminus of PPARgamma2 binds a small protein, termed PGC-2, itself having adipogenic action [39]. Thus, combined to these findings, our results suggest that the absence of DLK most likely prevents adipocyte conversion of 3T3-L1 cells by impairing the expression of PPARgamma2.

Of particular interest was the finding that neither the expression nor the nuclear localization of C/EBPbeta was affected by the loss of DLK. This suggests that the early events in adipogenesis such as CREB (cAMP response element binding protein) activation by protein kinase A [40] and its consequent up-regulation of C/EBPbeta remain unmodified under these conditions. RNA interference studies also led us to find that the depletion of DLK has no effect on JNK activity during 3T3-L1 adipocyte differentiation. Although surprising, since DLK has been identified as an upstream activator of the JNK pathway [41], this result is not entirely without precedent. Published data from overexpression and RNA interference-mediated knockdown studies in other cell systems, such as COS and NIH 3T3 cells, also support a role for DLK in activation of the p38, ERK and Akt signaling pathways [31], [42]. Therefore, the possibility that an effector other than JNK mediates the action of DLK during adipogenesis in 3T3-L1 cells can not be excluded.

As demonstrated by the results of our RT-qPCR analyses, DLK depletion affects the accumulation of C/EBPalpha, PPARgamma, adiponectin and fatty acid synthase proteins during adipocyte differentiation by directly down-regulating the expression of their encoding genes. Because ChIP assays revealed no difference in C/EBPbeta recruitment to the cebpalpha and ppargamma2 promoters before and after DLK depletion, it is tempting to speculate that DLK action in adipogenesis lies between C/EBPbeta DNA binding and initiation of cebpalpha and ppargamma2 gene transcription. C/EBPbeta binding to the cebpalpha and ppargamma2 promoters without being able to induce their transcription is a naturally occurring process during adipogenesis. Indeed, once induced by adipogenic stimuli, C/EBPbeta binds to the cebpalpha and ppargamma2 promoters well before initiation of transcription starts [12]. This is followed by recruitment of the Ini1, Brg1 and Brm subunits of the chromatin-remodelling SWI/SNF complex [43] at the ppargamma2 promoter, which leads to activation of ppargamma2 transcription. The resulting accumulation of PPARgamma2 is a prerequisite to the expression of C/EBPalpha, since active PPARgamma2 has the ability to displace a repressive complex composed of mSin3A/histone deacetylase (HDAC)1 from the cebpalpha promoter [29]. Thus, if the SWI/SNF complex is not recruited to the ppargamma2 promoter, neither PPARgamma2 nor C/EBPalpha will be expressed during adipogenesis, a phenomenon similar to what is seen in DLK-depleted 3T3-L1 cells. Our observation that rosiglitazone treatment restores, at least in part, the expression of C/EBPalpha in DLK-depleted cells is consistent with the idea that PPARgamma activation facilitates C/EBPalpha expression [28]. Thus, it is likely that rosiglitazone-mediated activation of PPARgamma1 in DLK-depleted cells is sufficient to displace the repressive mSin3A/HDAC1 complex from the cebpalpha promoter and allow the expression of C/EBPalpha, which in turn induces PPARgamma2, the most potent regulator of adipogenesis [44].

Another potential mechanism by which DLK depletion might decrease PPARgamma2 and C/EBPalpha mRNA levels is by altering phosphorylation of C/EBPbeta. This idea is supported by the fact that C/EBPbeta has multiple phosphorylation sites, some of which are involved in the regulation of DNA-binding activity [16], while others are key determinants of its transactivation capacity [17]. Of particular interest among them is threonine 188, a consensus phosphorylation site for both ERK and glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK3) [16]. Mutation of this threonine to alanine disrupts C/EBPbeta's ability to activate C/EBPalpha expression, but not DNA binding to C/EBP response element within the proximal promoter [17]. The T188A mutation also makes C/EBPbeta incapable of inducing adiponectin gene expression, probably as a result of loss of C/EBPalpha expression. Taken together, these results imply that phosphorylation of C/EBPbeta at threonine 188 is critical for transcriptional activity in the context of the C/EBPalpha promoter. Additional support for a role of phosphorylation in the control of C/EBPbeta function also comes from the findings of Roy et al. who recently demonstrated that MLK3 activates C/EBPbeta in response to IFN-gamma by a mechanism involving decreased phosphorylation of a specific serine residue within transactivation domain [45]. Therefore, even if C/EBPbeta binds the cebpalpha and ppargamma2 promoters in DLK-depleted cells as efficiently as in control cells, a change in its phosphorylation state that would impair its function or interaction with transcriptional co-activators is also consistent with our results.

In summary, the results presented in this report identify DLK, a MLK family member, as one of the key regulators of adipocyte differentiation. Although the exact mechanisms by which DLK controls this process remain to be identified, DLK action most likely takes place downstream of C/EBPbeta DNA-binding to the cebpalpha and ppargamma2 promoters but upstream of transcription initiation (Fig. 7).

Early events in adipogenesis lead to the expression of C/EBPbeta and C/EBPdelta (step 1), which then bind to the cebpalpha and ppargamma2 promoters (step 2). DLK (step 3) in turn appears to contribute to the subsequent increase in the expression of PPARgamma and C/EBPalpha (step 4) by a mechanism that remains to be identified. The latter two proteins then direct the expression of various adipocyte-specific genes (step 5).

Medium containing lentiviruses was then collected, treated with polybrene (8 microg/ml) and filtered. 24 hours prior infection, 3T3-L1 cells were seeded at a density of 2.5x104 cells/ml in 100-mm dishes. The next day, medium was removed and 1 ml of lentiviral suspension was added to the plates. Cells were incubated at 37degreesC with the lentiviral suspension for 1 hour, and 8.5 ml of DMEM supplemented with 10% BCS and antibiotics were added. 24 hours later, cells were washed once with PBS, and either trypsinised and reseeded into four 60-mm dishes in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS and 2 microg/ml puromycin for selection or used as is. Media was changed every 2 days until cells reached confluency, after which they were induced to differentiate as mentioned above.

Cells were lysed for 60 min at 4degreesC in lysis buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.4, 1% Triton X-100, 150 mM NaCl, 5 mM EDTA, 0.2 mM sodium orthovanadate, 0.2 mM sodium fluoride, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mg/ml leupeptin, and 1 mg/ml aprotinin). Lysates were clarified by centrifugation (12 000x g for 10 min at 4degreesC) and the concentration of total protein in the supernatant fraction was quantified by the modified Bradford protein assay (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Mississauga, Ontario, Canada). Several white and brown adipose depots provided by the animal facility of our Department were collected from female CD-1 mice. For preparation of the homogenates, the tissues were washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline after their removal, quickly frozen in liquid nitrogen and ground to a fine powder with a mortar and a pestle. The tissue powder was then resuspended in the cell lysis buffer described above, incubated for 60 min at 4degreesC and clarified by centrifugation. Quantification of the tissue lysates was also done by the modified Bradford protein assay. For immunoblotting, equal amounts of proteins were fractionated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) and transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membranes (Roche Diagnostics, Laval, Quebec, Canada) using a semidry transfer apparatus (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Mississauga, Ontario, Canada). Membranes were incubated overnight on a rotating plate at 4degreesC in a solution containing 20 mM Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 0.1% Tween-20 (TBS-T) supplemented with 5% skim milk powder (w/v) and the primary antibody. Membranes were washed two times in TBS-T before incubation in a solution containing TBS-T, 5% skim milk powder (w/v) and the secondary horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibodies on a rotating plate for 1 hour at room temperature. Membranes were washed two more times in TBS-T before immunoreactive bands were detected by enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL Plus Western blotting kit, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Inc.).

Each experiment was done with one confuent 100-mm dish of 2 days differentiated 3T3-L1 cells infected with an empty lentiviral vector (Empty vector) or lentiviruses expressing mouse (mDLK) or human (hDLK) shRNA. Briefly, infected cells were crosslinked for 10 min at room temperature with 1% formaldehyde in PBS. Cells were then washed in PBS, resuspended in 200 microl of ChIP lysis buffer [1% sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), 10 mM EDTA, 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), and protease inhibitors] and sonicated (60% maximum output for 15 s with 3 min pause, 3 cycles; Branson Sonifier Type 450 with microtip; Danbury, CT) in an ice bath. The chromatin solution was diluted 10-fold in ChIP dilution buffer (0.01% SDS; 1.1% Triton X-100; 1.2 mM EDTA; 16.7 mM Tris, pH 8.1; 16.7 mM NaCl; and protease inhibitors). 5% of the lysate was used for purification of total DNA. Each sample was precleared by incubating with 2 microg salmon sperm DNA/protein A-agarose 50% gel slurry (Roche Diagnostics, Laval, Quebec, Canada) for 2 hours at 4degreesC. An aliquot of 10 microg of indicated antibody (or no antibody for the control) was added and immunoprecipitated at 4degreesC overnight. The immunoprecipitate was collected using salmon sperm DNA/protein A-agarose and washed sequentially with the following buffers: low-salt wash buffer (0.1% SDS; 1% Triton X-100; 2 mM EDTA; 20 mM Tri-HCl, pH 8.1; 150 mM NaCl); high-salt wash buffer (0.1% SDS; 1% Triton X-100; 2 mM EDTA; 20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.1; 500 mM NaCl); LiCl wash buffer (0.25 M LiCl; 1% Nonidet P-40; 1% sodium deoxycholate; 1 mM EDTA; 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.1) and TE (10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0; 1 mM EDTA). DNA- protein cross-links were reversed by incubation at 65degreesC overnight followed by proteinase K treatment. DNA was recovered by purification with the Qiaquik PCR purification column (Qiagen). Results were analysed by real-time PCR with primers spanning C/EBPbeta binding site at the C/EBPalpha (forward: 5'-TAGTGTTGGCTGGAAGTGGGTGACTTAGAGGC-3', reverse: 5'-TTCTCCTGTGACTTTCCAAGGCGGTGAGTG-3') and PPARgamma2 (forward: 5'-TACGTTTATCGGTGTTTCAT-3', reverse: 5'-TCTCGCCAGTGACCC-3') promoters.

Total RNA was extracted using Trizol reagent (Invitrogen, Burlington, Ontario, Canada). Reverse transcription was done on total RNA with random hexamers as primers and the Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (Promega, Madison, Wisconsin, USA). Quantitative Real Time PCR reactions were run on an ABI 7500 (Applied Biosystems) apparatus and results were analysed with SDS software (Applied Biosystems). Amplification patterns were normalized on the 36B4 housekeeping gene. The primer used for amplification were: forward: 5'-CGACCTGGAAGTCCAACTAC-3' and reverse: 5'-ATCTGCTGCATCTGCTTG-3' for 36B4, forward: 5'-GGACAAGCTGAGCGACGAGTA-3' and reverse: 5'-CCGTCAGCTCCAGCACCTT-3' for C/EBPbeta, forward: 5'-GCGCAAGAGCCGAGATAAAG-3' and reverse: 5'-CACGGCTCAGCTGTTCCA-3' for C/EBPalpha, forward: 5'-GCCCAGGCTTGCTGAACGTGAAG-3' and reverse: 5'-CACGTGCTCTGTGACGATCTGCC-3' for PPARgamma, forward: 5'-CATCCCAGGACATCCTGGCCACAATG-3' and reverse: 5'-GGCCCTTCAGCTCCTGTCATTCCAAC-3' for adiponectin and forward: 5'-GCTATGCAGATGGCTGTCTCTCCCAG-3' and reverse: 5'-GCAGCGCTGTTTACATTCCTCCCAGG-3' for fatty acid synthase.
