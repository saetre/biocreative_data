We have cloned cDNA encoding the mouse interleukin-2 (IL-2) receptor from a murine T cell line, CTLL using human IL-2 receptor cDNA as probe. COS 7 cells transfected with the cDNA expressed the antigen recognized by the monoclonal antibody against the murine IL-2 receptor. The cDNA identified 4 species of mRNA (4.5, 3.5, 2.2 and 1.5 kb) of the mouse IL-2 receptor in CTLL cells. Difference in the length of mRNA seems to be ascribed to the variable length of the 3' untranslated sequence. Total nucleotide sequence (approximately 1400 bp) of this cDNA was determined and compared with the human receptor. The nucleotide and amino acid sequences of the IL-2 receptor are 70% and 60%, respectively, homologous in average between the two species. The comparison has revealed several conserved regions localized to particular exons such as transmembrane and cytoplasmic portions, suggesting that these regions are important for receptor function and its regulation.
