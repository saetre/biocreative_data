Mice contain at least seven nonallelic forms of the H1 histones, including the somatic variants H1a-e and less closely related variants H1 degrees and H1t. The mouse H1 degrees and H1c (H1var.1) genes were isolated and characterized previously. We have now isolated, sequenced and studied the expression properties of two additional mouse H1 genes, termed H1var.2 and H1var.3. Extensive amino acid and nucleotide sequence comparisons were made between the two genes and other mammalian H1 histone genes. A high degree of nucleotide sequence identity was seen between the H1var.2, rat H1d and human H1b genes, even well beyond the coding region, indicating that these genes are likely homologues. Unlike the previously characterized mouse H1var.1 gene which produces both nonpolyadenylated and polyadenylated mRNAs, the H1var.2 and H1var.3 genes produce only typical, replication dependent, nonpolyadenylated mRNAs.
