RNase E is a major endonucleolytic RNA processing enzyme in Escherichia coli. We have sequenced a 3.2 kb EcoRI-BamHI fragment encoding the rne gene, and identified its reading frame. Upstream from the gene, there are appropriate consensus sequences for a putative promoter and a ribosome binding site. We have translated this gene using a T7 RNA polymerase/promoter system. We determined 25 amino acids from the N-terminal of the translated product and they are in full agreement with the DNA sequence. The translated product of the rne gene migrates in SDS containing polyacrylamide gels as a 110,000 Da polypeptide, but the open reading frame found in the sequenced DNA indicates a much smaller protein. The entity that migrates as a 110,000 Da contains RNA, which could account, at least partially, for the migration of the rne gene product in SDS containing polyacrylamide gels.
