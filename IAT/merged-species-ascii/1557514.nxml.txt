Two main genes encoding the catalytic subunits Calpha and Cbeta of cyclic AMP dependent protein kinase (PKA) have been identified in all vertebrates examined. The murine, bovine and human Cbeta genes encode several splice variants, including the splice variant Cbeta2. In mouse Cbeta2 has a relative molecular mass of 38 kDa and is only expressed in the brain. In human and bovine Cbeta2 has a relative molecular mass of 47 kDa and is mainly expressed in lymphoid tissues.

We identified a novel 47 kDa splice variant encoded by the mouse Cbeta gene that is highly expressed in lymphoid cells. Cloning, expression, and production of a sequence-specific antiserum and characterization of PKA catalytic subunit activities demonstrated the 47 kDa protein to be a catalytically active murine homologue of human and bovine Cbeta2. Based on the present results and the existence of a human brain-specifically expressed Cbeta splice variant designated Cbeta4 that is identical to the former mouse Cbeta2 splice variant, the mouse splice variant has now been renamed mouse Cbeta4.

Murine lymphoid tissues express a protein that is a homologue of human and bovine Cbeta2. The murine Cbeta gene encodes the splice variants Cbeta1, Cbeta2, Cbeta3 and Cbeta4, as is the case with the human Cbeta gene.

Cyclic AMP dependent protein kinase (PKA) is a holoenzyme that consists of a regulatory (R) subunit dimer and two catalytic (C) subunits [1]. The enzyme is activated when two cAMP molecules bind each R subunit, causing a conformational change that releases the C subunits [2]. Different isoforms of both R and C subunits exist. Four separate R subunit genes designated RIalpha, RIbeta, RIIalpha and RIIbeta have been identified and characterized in all primates investigated [3,4]. In most species investigated three genes encoding the C isoforms have been identified and designated Calpha, Cbeta and PrKX. PrKX is an X chromosome encoded protein kinase [5] that has, despite low homology to Calpha and Cbeta, been identified as a PKA C subunit with the ability to release the R subunit in a cAMP-dependent fashion [1]. A murine homologue of PrKX termed PKARE has also been described [6]. Moreover, in human, an intron-less gene transcribing the mRNA for Cgamma has been identified. Cgamma represents a testis-specific retroposon [7]. In the mouse a C subunit pseudogene has been identified and designated Cx [8].

Several splice variants of Calpha and Cbeta, arising from alternative splicing of the first exon in the Calpha and Cbeta genes, are responsible for further diversity. The Calpha gene encodes two splice variants (Calpha1 and Calphas/Calpha2) in mouse [9], human [10] and sheep [11]). In human 10 different splice variants encoded by the Cbeta gene have been identified and called Cbeta1, Cbeta2, Cbeta3, Cbeta4, Cbeta4ab, Cbeta4abc, Cbeta3ab, Cbeta3abc, Cbeta3b and Cbeta4b [12]. In the mouse and bovine three and two Cbeta splice variants have been identified, respectively. In bovine they are designated Cbeta1 and Cbeta2 [13,14] and in mouse they are designated Cbeta1, Cbeta2 and Cbeta3 [15,16]. Calpha1 and Cbeta1 are ubiquitously expressed, while the other splice variants show a more tissue restricted expression pattern. CalphaS/Calpha2 is solely expressed in sperm cells [10,11]. Whereas expression of the human Cbeta2 splice variant is enriched in lymphoid tissues [17,18], it shows a more widespread pattern of expression in the bovine [14] and is restricted to the brain in mice [16]. The majority of the other Cbeta splice variants identified, which include human and murine Cbeta3 and human Cbeta4 as well as the human Cbeta3 and Cbeta4 abc variants, are only detected in nerve cells and the brain [12,16,17].

A number of reports have demonstrated that both the Calpha1 and Cbeta1 isoforms have a relative molecular mass of approximately 40 kDa when analysed by SDS-PAGE [15]. In contrast, human and bovine Cbeta2 have a relative molecular mass of 47 kDa [14,18] whereas in the mouse it is 38 kDa [16]. Both human and murine Cbeta3 are 38 kDa, as is also the case with human Cbeta4 [12,16,17]. For the human Cbeta3 and Cbeta4 abc variants, the relative molecular masses have not been determined.

We investigated the expression of C subunits in various murine tissues and identified two immunoreactive proteins of approximately 40 and 47 kDa. Whereas the 40 kDa band was ubiquitously expressed, the 47 kDa band was restricted to lymphoid tissues such as thymus, spleen and lymph node. Based on this we examined the activity, level and apparent molecular sizes of Cbeta splice variants in immune cells. Using spleen cells from wild type and mice mutant for the Cbeta gene we demonstrated that the 40 kDa band was Cbeta1 whereas the 47 kDa protein was the murine homologue of human and bovine Cbeta2. The novel murine Cbeta2 was shown to be an active protein kinase that was immunodetected by an antiserum made against the human Cbeta2 specific sequence. Based on this, together with sequence homology searches and sequence comparisons, we conclude that the previously reported murine Cbeta2 is a homologue of human Cbeta4. Thus, the murine Cbeta gene encodes the splice variants Cbeta1, Cbeta2, Cbeta3 and Cbeta4, as is the case with the human Cbeta gene.

When lysates made from various murine tissues were separated by SDS-PAGE and immunostained with a commercially available pan C antibody (Figure 1A), a 40 kDa band was detected in all tissues. In addition to this ubiquitously expressed band a weaker band of 47 kDa was detected, that seemed to be restricted to lymphoid tissues, as it could only be detected in lymph nodes, spleen and thymus. No expression was detected in brain, heart, lung, liver, kidney and skeletal muscle.

To investigate identity of these C immunoreactive bands, spleen cell lysates from wild type (WT) mice and mice that were heterozygous (+/-) or homozygous (-/-) for a null mutation in the Cbeta gene [19] and a human T cell lysate were immunoblotted with the pan C antibody (Figure 1B). In the human T cell lysate two immunoreactive bands of 40 and 47 kDa were identified. These protein bands have previously been shown to be Calpha1 (40 kDa) and Cbeta2 (47 kDa) [18]. The 47 kDa immunoreactive protein band was detected in the spleen cell lysate from WT and Cbeta+/- mice, but was absent in the Cbeta-/- lysate, implying that it represents a Cbeta splice variant. Furthermore, in the Cbeta-/- lysate, the 40 kDa protein band appeared weaker in intensity. This was confirmed by densitometric scanning of the 40 kDa bands in Figure 1B (results not shown) which revealed a 40 % reduction in intensity of the 40 kDa band in the Cbeta-/- lysate. Together this implies that Cbeta1 (40 kDa) may be expressed in mouse spleen cells.

Spleen cell lysates from WT and Cbeta mutant mice were also tested for PKA-specific phosphotransferase activity by incorporation of 32P from [gamma-32P]-ATP into the PKA-specific substrate Kemptide (Figure 1C). Phosphotransferase activity was also measured in the presence of PKI to demonstrate that kinase activity was PKA-specific (black bars, cAMP/PKI). PKA-specific activity was reduced by 35 and 66 % in Cbeta+/- and Cbeta-/- mice, respectively, compared to WT (Cbeta+/+) mice. This indicates that Cbeta contributes significantly to PKA activity in mouse spleen cells.

To further investigate the identity of the 40 and 47 kDa protein bands, we analysed C subunit expression and PKA kinase activity in mice lacking the Cbeta1 splice variant (Cbeta1-/-) [20]. Figure 1D demonstrates that the 47 kDa C subunit immunoreactive band is present in cell lysates from both WT and Cbeta1-/- mice. It should however be noted that the 40 kDa protein band was clearly weaker in intensity in lysate from Cbeta1-/- mice. Densitometric scanning indicated that this reduction was of similar magnitude (approximately 30 %, results not shown) as that monitored in the Cbeta-/- mice. Together with the fact that we also measured a 27 % reduction in PKA kinase activity in the Cbeta1-/- mice lysates (Figure 1E) this demonstrated that Cbeta1 is expressed in mouse spleen cells. Finally, the fact that reduction in PKA kinase activity in the Cbeta-/- was approximately twice as much at that observed in the Cbeta1-/- (66 % as opposed to 27 %) strongly implies that the lymphoid tissue specific 47 kDa protein is a Cbeta splice variant and that it contributes significantly to PKA kinase activity in mouse spleen cells.

Our observations that murine spleen cells express a 47 kDa anti-C immunoreactive protein that is absent in the Cbeta-/- animals, and co-migrates with human Cbeta2, suggest that the mouse expresses a Cbeta2 subunit homologous to the human Cbeta2 subunit. In order to investigate this, we initially performed a homology search in the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) BLAST (tblastn) search tool using the human Cbeta2 specific peptide sequence. We identified a region with high sequence similarity to the human exon 1-2 sequence in the published mouse genome [21]. This sequence was located in the mouse Cbeta gene upstream of exon 2 (Figure 2A). Based on this information and the fact that all C subunits identified so far only differ in the domain encoded by alternative use of exon 1, we postulated a hypothetical cDNA sequence using this mouse exon 1-2 sequence and the known murine Cbeta cDNA sequence [15] (Figure 2A, bottom). To confirm mRNA expression of this sequence, oligonucleotide primers corresponding to the 5'-untranslated and 3'-untranslated regions of the cDNA were synthesised and used for reverse transcriptase PCR of total RNA from mouse thymus since Cbeta2 expression has earlier been reported to be enriched in human thymus [17]. PCR products were subcloned into pCR-Blunt-II-TOPO vector. Nucleotide sequencing (Medigenomix, Germany) and amino acid sequence deduction (Figure 2B), followed by comparison of the unique N-terminal end [17,22] with corresponding sequences in human, bovine, mouse and zebra fish (Figure 2C), confirmed the novel sequence as the murine Cbeta2 homologue.

Identification of a novel mouse cDNA sequence encoding a Cbeta splice variant homologous to human Cbeta2. (A) Schematic representation of the human (upper) and murine (lower) Cbeta gene. The intron sizes between exons (vertical lines) are indicated by horizontal arrows. A region of high similarity (identified by BLAST (tblastn) homology search in the published mouse genome) to human exon 1-2 is indicated between the genes (bent/vertical lines). A hypothetical cDNA sequence is indicated, with an 1197 base pair open reading frame (ORF 1197 bp), and a start (ATG) and stop (TAG) translation codon for murine Cbeta2 is given, based on the identified sequence and the known mouse Cbeta cDNA sequence (bottom). (B) Deduced amino acid sequence of mouse Cbeta2 shown in one letter code. The Cbeta2 splice variant specific sequence of 62 amino acids is underscored. (C) Cbeta2 specific sequences from human, bovine, mouse and zebrafish were aligned and amino acid sequences conserved between species were boxed. Compared to the level of conservation in the catalytic core of C subunits, the Cbeta2 specific sequence shows a lesser degree of conservation.

It has previously been demonstrated that a cDNA encoding the bovine Cbeta2 was not active when transfected into CHO cells [22]. To determine if the mouse Cbeta2 cDNA encodes an active protein kinase, the cDNA was amplified by PCR and subcloned into pcDNA-DEST40 (Gateway Technology System, Invitrogen). To optimize for efficient protein expression, a Kozak sequence was introduced in the 5'-end. Moreover, two different 3'-ends were made, one including and one excluding a stop codon to facilitate native and tagged expression, respectively (Figure 3A). The new plasmid was designated pcDNA-DEST40mCbeta2 and transfected into HEK 293T cells. As a positive control pEF-DEST51Calpha1, which expresses human Calpha1 (hCalpha1), was used. Mock transfected cells served as a negative control. Twenty-four hours after transfection cells were lysed and subjected to immunoblotting using a pan C antibody. This revealed expression of an immunoreactive protein of 47 kDa in cells transfected with mCbeta2, and a 40 kDa protein in cells transfected with hCalpha1. A weak 40 kDa band could also be seen in mCbeta2 and mock transfected cell lysates (Figure 3B), representing endogenous Calpha1. In order to test for enzyme activity of the expressed Cbeta2, the same cell lysates were analysed for PKA-specific phosphotransferase activity against Kemptide. This demonstrated a more than 10-fold increased enzyme activity in the cells transfected with mCbeta2 and hCalpha1 compared to the mock-transfected cells (Figure 3C). The PKA specific inhibitor PKI abolished this activity, implying that the activity observed is PKA-specific and that mouse Cbeta2 is an active PKA enzyme. It should be noted that the C-terminally tagged Cbeta2 was kinase inactive and was not used for further experiments (results not shown).

Murine Cbeta2 cDNA encodes an active protein kinase of 47 kDa recognized by a Cbeta2-specific antiserum. (A) Primers used to amplify mouse Cbeta2 cDNA for insertion into pENTR/D-TOPO (Gateway system, Invitrogen). The upper 5'-end primer (upper sequence left) was designed to produce an insert with a Kozak sequence associated with the start codon (ATG). Two different 3'-end primers (lower right two sequences) were designed in order to include or exclude the stop codon (TAG). In the absence of the stop codon, the mouse Cbeta2 would be expressed with a C-terminal tag, which is contained in the vector (Gateway, Invitrogen). Mouse Cbeta2 cDNA was PCR amplified and subcloned into the pcDNA-DEST40 expression vector to yield pcDNA-DEST40 mCbeta2. (B) HEK 293T cells (3.5 x 105 cells/ml) were transfected with 2mug DNA/ml of pcDNA-DEST40mCbeta2 (mCbeta2), mock-transfected (mock), or transfected with pEF-DEST51hCalpha1 (hCalpha1) for 24 h. Cells were lysed and analysed by SDS-PAGE and anti-pan C immunoblotting. Note that mCbeta2, but not mock or hCalpha1 transfected cell extracts, contained an anti-C immunoreactive protein of 47 kDa. All lanes revealed a 40 kDa protein band which was most intense in cells transfected with pEF-DEST51hCalpha1 . (C) The same lysates were analysed for PKA-specific kinase activity in the absence (empty bars, basal) or presence (gray bars, cAMP) of 5muM cAMP, or both cAMP and PKI (black bars, cAMP/PKI). Activities were calculated relative to the activity of the mock-transfected lysate, which was set to 100 %. Bars represent mean activities of three experiments +/- standard deviation. (D) The sequence of the two mCbeta2 specific peptides (boxed) used to immunize rabbits to make mCbeta2 specific antiserum. (E) Two rabbits were co-immunized with the two peptides and the resulting immune sera tested for immunoreactivity and specificity using cell extracts of HEK 293T cell transfected with mCbeta2 (pcDNA-DEST40mCbeta2) or hCalpha1 (pEF-DEST51hCalpha1). Left panel: The mCbeta2 serum recognized a 47 kDa immunoreactive protein in mCbeta2 but not in hCalpha1 transfected cell lysates. No cross-reactivity to human Calpha1 could be observed. Right panel: Immunoblotting of the same lysates with a pan anti-C antibody revealed a 47 and a 40 kDa immunoreactive protein in the two extracts respectively, confirming expression of transfected constructs.

In order to further demonstrate that the cloned sequence expressed a murine Cbeta2 (mCbeta2) specific sequence, we developed an antiserum by immunizing two rabbits with two mCbeta2 specific peptides (Figure 3D). Immunoreactivity of the resulting antiserum (Anti-mCbeta2) was tested by immunoblotting using lysates from HEK 293T cells transfected with either mCbeta2 or human Calpha1 (hCalpha1) (Figure 3E). This revealed that the size of the protein recognized by the anti-mCbeta2 serum was determined to be 47 kDa by comparison with an identical blot probed with the pan C antibody. It should be noted that the anti-mCbeta2 serum did not appear to cross-react with expressed hCalpha1.

The present report demonstrates a lymphoid tissue specific 47 kDa Cbeta subunit which together with Cbeta1 (40 kDa) is responsible for 66 % of PKA specific enzyme activity in spleen cells. The 47 kDa Cbeta subunit was cloned and shown to be an active murine PKA Cbeta splice variant. Based on a sequence homology search, and production of a specific antiserum, we conclude that the 47 kDa protein is the murine homologue of human and bovine Cbeta2. Furthermore, sequence comparison also led us to conclude that the previously published murine Cbeta2 is the murine homologue of human Cbeta4. Taken together with previous reports our results demonstrate that the murine Cbeta gene encodes Cbeta1, Cbeta2, Cbeta3 and Cbeta4.

Expression of Cbeta1 in murine spleen was indirectly demonstrated by reduced immunoreactivity of the 40 kDa band and a 27 % reduction in PKA-specific kinase activity in the Cbeta1-/- mouse. Cbeta1 expression in murine lymphocytes is in conflict with our previous observations in human T lymphocytes [18], which apparently do not express this splice variant. If this is also the case for murine T cells, it implies that other cell types may account for the presence of Cbeta1 in our cell extracts, since spleen cells are a mixture of various immune cells, including B and T cells as well as macrophages and monocytes.

Our results demonstrate the existence of a sequence in the murine genome homologous to the human and bovine Cbeta2-specific sequence. In addition, we observed a 47 kDa anti-C immunoreactive protein that was absent in Cbeta-/- but not in Cbeta1-/- mice. Because the cloned and expressed Cbeta variant was 47 kDa as demonstrated by immunoreactivity to a pan C antibody and a serum made against the N-terminus of the novel protein, and because the only known 47 kDa PKA C subunit is the human and bovine Cbeta2 [17,22], we conclude that the novel C subunit is the murine Cbeta2 homologue. The existence of the 47 kDa Cbeta2 homologue is in conflict with our previous report, which showed the presence of Cbeta2 in several mammalian species, including monkey, dog, man and bovine, but failed to demonstrate the splice variant in rodents [17]. This was concluded based on a Zoo-blot (Southern blot with genomic DNA from various species) analysis using a probe spanning the human Cbeta2-specific sequence. Failure to identify a murine Cbeta2 may have been due to low homology between Cbeta2 of various species, which we also discovered in our data-base searches comparing the Cbeta2 specific sequence of human, bovine, mouse and zebra fish (Figure 2C). Interestingly, the Cbeta2 specific sequence was fairly well conserved even in the fish genome, indicating the presence of Cbeta2 in all vertebrates. A lower of degree of conservation is a feature generally associated with sequences not directly involved in catalysis, which again may suggest a more structural role for the N-terminal part of the protein.

Expression of Cbeta2 protein seemed to be mostly restricted to lymphoid tissues, as the 47 kDa band was present in lymph nodes, spleen and thymus, but not detectable in brain, heart, lung, liver, kidney and skeletal muscle. In an earlier report Cbeta2 mRNA was detected in bovine brain, heart, skeletal muscle, spleen and liver [14]. Moreover, in human Cbeta2 has been detected by Northern blotting in human kidney in addition to the same immune tissues as demonstrated for mouse [17]. The fact that we were unable to detect Cbeta2 protein in all tissues described in bovine and in kidney of human may imply that the protein is not present in these tissues or that the level of expression is below the level of detection for the antibodies used here.

Guthrie et al. [16] identified three Cbeta splice variants in mouse, with Cbeta2 expressed exclusively in the brain, encoding an additional 2 amino acids at the N-terminus by alternative use of exons. It is therefore smaller than human and bovine Cbeta2 and is not expressed in the same tissues. In fact, the previously described mouse Cbeta2 is identical to the human splice variant designated Cbeta4, which is expressed in the brain [17]. Based on this evidence, the previously described murine Cbeta2 has now been renamed murine Cbeta4. Moreover, based on this and previous reports, we conclude that all mammals contain the isoforms Cbeta1, Cbeta2, Cbeta3 and Cbeta4. These facts call for a revision of the present Cbeta splice variant nomenclature as given in Table 1.

We conclude that the murine homologue of human and bovine Cbeta2 is expressed in lymphoid cells. The previously published murine Cbeta2 [16] is the murine homologue of human Cbeta4 [17]. Taken together with previous reports we conclude that the murine Cbeta gene encodes Cbeta1, Cbeta2, Cbeta3 and Cbeta4.

Cbeta-/- mice on a mixed C57BL/6:129SV/J background [19] were obtained from Professor G. Stanley McKnight (Department of Pharmacology, University of Washington School of Medicine, Seattle, 98195, USA). All use of animals has been approved and registered by the Norwegian Animal Research Authority. Animals were housed in a temperature controlled (22degreesC) facility with a strict 12 hour light/dark cycle, and allowed the RM1 diet (Special Diet Services Ltd, Witham, Essex, UK) and water ad libitum before euthanasia. Heterozygote animals were crossed and offspring genotyped by PCR. The KO allele was detected using a forward primer 5'-ccgcttgggtggagaggctat-3' that hybridizes inside the neomycin cassette that replaced exon 2 by homologous recombination when the KO gene was generated, and a reverse primer 5'-gccctccttgccgcct-3' that hybridizes downstream of exon 2, giving a ~1.4 kb product. The WT allele was detected using a forward primer 5'-cggtgctggcaacagaaggtg-3' that hybridizes upstream of exon 2 and a reverse primer 5'-gaagggaacggaggcgagtga-3' that hybridizes inside exon 2, giving a ~1.2 kb product.

Human T cells were purified from buffy coates of healthy blood donors (Ullevaal University Hospital Blood Centre, Oslo, Norway). Written approval was obtained from all donors. First, mononuclear cells were isolated using density gradient centrifugation (Lymphoprep; Nycomed, Oslo, Norway) as described elsewhere [24]. The cells were then enriched for T cells by negative selection using anti-CD14 and anti-CD19 coated magnetic beads (Dynal, Oslo, Norway).

PKA-specific kinase activity was determined as described previously [25,26]. Briefly, 10 mul lysate (1mug/ml) was added to a 40 mul reaction mix to make a final concentration of 30 muM Kemptide, 200 muM of ATP containing 2 muCi/mmol [gamma-32P]ATP (Amersham Biosciences), 10 mM MgAc2, 20 mM Tris (pH 7.4) in the presence or absence of 5muM cAMP and 30 muM PKI. After incubation for 9 minutes at 30degreesC, 25 mul of the reaction was spotted onto phosphocellulose paper (P81 Whatman), which was washed four times in 75 mM phosphoric acid and finally in 95% ethanol. Filters were air-dried, immersed in Opti-Fluor (Packard Biosciences) and counted in a liquid scintillation counter.

A homology search in the murine genome was performed in the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) BLAST (tblastn) search tool using the human Cbeta2 specific peptide sequence. A region similar to the human exon 1-2 sequence was identified and a sequence in the mouse genome was postulated as mouse exon 1-2. Based on this a hypothetical murine Cbeta2 cDNA was deduced which contained this sequence and the rest of the known murine Cbeta cDNA sequence thatspans the sequence encoded by exon 2 through exon 10. To verify the existence of murine Cbeta2 mRNA, total RNA was isolated from a mouse thymus using the RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen) and total cDNA was synthesized using the Promega Reverse Transcription System (Promega). Potential full-length mCbeta2 cDNAs were amplified with PCR (Pfu Ultra amplification system, Stratagene) using several different oligonucleotide primers corresponding to the 5'-untranslated and 3'-untranslated regions of the predicted cDNA. Three different forward primers (F1: 5'-gctcttagcgtcttggtagg-3', F2: 5'-aaacacttgcagttacttta-3' and F3: 5'-ttctgaaaacacttgcagtt-3') and three different reverse primers (R1: 5'-cccacagaggtcggt-3', R2: 5'-gacctcacgcagttg-3' and R3: 5'-acactgatgacgcagga-3') were combined into nine different primer sets (set 1: F1+R1, set 2: F1+R2, set 3: F1+R3, set 4: F2+R1, set 5: F2+R2, set 6: F2+R3, set 7: F3+R1, set 8: F3+R2 and set 9: F3+R3). Of the primer sets (Sets 1, 3, 4, 6, 7 and 9) that resulted in amplification of a single DNA band of the right size (based on the theoretical lengths of the various PCR products-between 1300 and 2000 bp), Set 1 and 3 were used to amplify mCbeta2 cDNA in two parallel PCR reactions. The PCR products were subcloned into the pCR-Blunt-II-TOPO vector (Invitrogen) and sequenced by Medigenomix (Martinsried, Germany).

For eukaryotic expression of mCbeta2, the mCbeta2 cDNA was cloned into the mammalian expression vector pcDNA-DEST40 (Gateway Technology System, Invitrogen), during which primers were made to introduce a Kozak sequence at the '5-end. In addition, two '3-end primers were used to introduce or exclude a stop codon in order to express mCbeta2 with or without an N-terminal tag encoded by the expression vector itself (Invitrogen). For primer sequences, see figure 3A. PCR products were subcloned into pENTR/D-TOPO vector and transformed into bacteria. A positive clone was purified by mini-preparation (Jetquick Plasmid Spin Kits, Genomed), digested by restriction enzymes and sequenced. Using the LR-clonase recombination reaction, the insert of the pENTR/D-TOPO vector was recombined into the pcDNA-DEST40 expression vector and transformed into bacteria. Positive clones were selected and purified by mini-preparation (Jetquick Plasmid Spin Kits, Genomed), restriction enzyme digested and sequenced. The new plasmid was designated pcDNA-DEST40mCbeta2.

Antisera production, including peptide synthesis, KLH-conjugation and immunization of rabbits was performed by Sigma-Genosys, UK. Rabbits were co-immunized with two peptides with sequences from the Cbeta2 specific N terminal end of murine Cbeta2, SRLFHRHSRGTAQE and RAALEDDGLRASEH (see figure 3D). Both peptides contained an additional Cys residue at the C-terminus for thiol-coupling to KLH (keyhole limpet hemocyanin). The conjugate was dissolved in PBS and injected with Freund's adjuvant. For the initial injection, 200 mug of conjugate was injected with Complete Freund's Adjuvant, and for subsequent injections 100 mug of conjugate with Incomplete Freund's Adjuvant was injected. Immunizations were given subcutaneously at a single site every two weeks for a total of 6 times. Blood samples were collected 4 times during this period.
