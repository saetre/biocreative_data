This study documents the molecular presence of human chorionic gonadotropin beta subunit in uterine cervix cancer tissues and investigates a novel technique to reduce hCGbeta levels based on expression of a modified U1 snRNA as a method to study the hormone's role in biology of human cervical cancer cells cultured in vitro. The property of U1 snRNA to block the accumulation of specific RNA transcript when it binds to its donor sequence within the 3' terminal exon was used. The first 10 nucleotides of the human U1 snRNA gene, which normally binds to the 5'ss in pre-mRNA were replaced by a sequence complementary to a 10-nt segment in the terminal exon of the hCGbeta mRNA. Three different 5' end-mutated U1 snRNA expression plasmids were tested, each targeting a different sequence in the hCGbeta mRNA, and we found each one blocked the expression of hCGbeta in HeLa cells, a cervix carcinoma cell line, as shown by immunohistochemistry and qRT-PCR. Reduction of hCGbeta levels resulted in a significantly increased apoptosis rate with almost 90% of cells transfected with modified anti-hCGbeta U1 snRNAs showing morphological changes characteristic of the apoptotic process.

Human chorionic gonadotropin is a heterodimeric glycoprotein that belongs to the family of related hormones included FSH, LH and TSH. The hormone is composed of two non-covalently linked subunits, the common alfa subunit (hCGalpha) and the hormone specific beta subunit (hCGbeta) [1]. Human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) is a hormone physiologically produced by the placenta to maintain the progesterone production of corpus luteum of pregnancy, which prepares the uterus for implantation and for embryonic and placental development [2].

The ectopic production of hCG and its subunits by patients with nontrophoblastic cancers has been reported by many authors lately [3]. The free subunit was originally considered as biologically non-functional, however it was shown recently that free beta-subunit may stimulate tumor growth or inhibit its apoptosis and the elevated serum level of hCGbeta is frequently associated with higher aggressiveness of cancer and its resistance to therapy [4,5].

We recently reported the expression of hCGbeta in patients with nontrophoblastic gynecological cancerous tissues showing that the beta subunit of human chorionic gonadotropin is produced by individual cancer cells. The distribution and the amount of hCG was heterogeneous and was not characteristic for all of the cells of the study tissue [6,7].

Here we confirm that the presence of the beta subunit of human chorionic gonadotropin's mRNA and protein is a characteristic feature of cervical carcinomas. The biological mechanisms behind the association of hCGbeta expression in cancer cells remains unclear. Silencing gene expression provides a powerful tool for analyzing gene function, however the effectiveness of RNA inhibition strategies has been variable. Based on this we investigated a novel mRNA silencing methodology as a method to study hCGbeta role in human cervical cancer cells cultured in vitro. Since nearly all mRNAs are postranscriptionally modified by 5'capping, splicing, 3' cleavage and polyadenylation it was postulated that agents interfering with processing of specific transcripts have the potential to be an effective anti-RNA strategy. Recently an approach for reducing mRNA output of a target gene was reported that is based on a modified U1 snRNA transcript as an effector. The interaction of U1 snRNP (small nuclear ribonucleoprotein particle) via base paring close to the polyadenylation signal results in inhibition of the cleavage or polyadenylation portion of the 3' end processing reaction [8,9]. This effect was applied to suppress other genes. A significant inhibition of gene expression was achieved by using a modified U1 snRNA in which the first 10 nucleotides have been substituted with a sequence complementary to the gene of interest present within the terminal exon [10-12].

In our study we exploit 5' end-mutated U1 snRNAs to block the expression of hCGbeta in a cervix carcinoma cell line. The results have been demonstrated that U1 snRNA base paired to this target mRNA inhibits the expression of the beta subunit of human gonadotropin gene causing apoptotic death of affected cells.

To verify at the molecular level the presence of hCGbeta in uterine cervix carcinoma, total RNA was isolated from cancer tissue of patients, reverse transcribed, and a 210 bp fragment corresponding to hCGbeta nucleotides 348-557 [GenBank: ] was amplified. In total, 15 samples of human uterine cervix carcinoma and 4 samples of placenta were analyzed. A representative example of the RT-PCR data is shown in Figure 1A where it is evident that we were able to amplify a specific fragment of hCGbeta. Sequencing of the amplified fragment confirmed its identity with hCGbeta.

There was, however, no amplification of hCGbeta fragment when cDNA synthesized from RNA isolated from tissue lacking cancerous changes (myometrium and uterine cervix) was used as a template for the PCR reaction (Figure 1B. lanes 1, 3, 5). The presence of the 509 bp fragment corresponding to beta-actin gene nucleotides 434-942 [GenBank:] in the tissues lacking hCGbeta served as a control and confirmed the integrity of isolated RNA (Figure 1B. lanes 2, 4, 6).

Because inhibition levels are limited by transfection efficiency - for example a 90% transfection rate can at most give a 10-fold inhibition [11], and in case of using HeLa cell line and lipofectaminetrade mark2000 transfection reagent the efficiency estimated by GFP reporter gene expression was lower than 30% we applied quantitative RT-PCR to show the silencing of human chorionic gonadotropin beta subunit expression. hCGbeta transcripts were detected in both control and transfected cells however, all 3 U1 snRNA anti-hCGbeta constructs clearly reduced the hormone's transcription as was showed by real time PCR results. The highest - 3-fold inhibition was observed for 702P/767A plasmid. Constructs 702P/767B and 702P/767C decreased hCGbeta mRNA amount 2-times while the expression level of cells transfected with 702P plasmid and control cells was the same (Figure 4). Using FuGENE - HD Transfection Reagent we got 60% transfection efficiency and the level of hormone inhibition was the same as when transfection efficiency was 30% (data not shown).

Next we determined whether the expression of 5'end-mutated U1 snRNA transgenes causing the inhibition of hCGbeta gene can affect the viability of cells. To assess the effect of transfection of anti-hCGbeta constructs on cancer cells the morphological features after staining with propidium iodide and Hoechst 33342 were observed. The cells transfected with a modified U1 snRNA showed changes typical for apoptosis. The nuclei condensation and fragmentation was detected particularly in approximately 90% cells expressing U1 snRNA anti-hCGbeta construct as well as in some neighbouring cells lacking the modified U1 snRNA (Figure 5B,C). The number of these latter cells does not exceed 20%. The cells transfected with the 702P control construct did not show any significant changes and only a few apoptotic cells were observed (data not shown).

The inhibition of hCGbeta expression by anti-hCGbeta constructs result in increase in distribution of cells at sub-G1 peak - apoptosis peak (Figure 6). The percentage of apoptotic cells was increased to 26.65%, 23.59% and 22.48% for 702P/767A, 702P/767B and 702P/767C plasmids respectively (Table 1).

Human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG), a heterodimeric sialoglycoprotein hormone composed of two noncovalently linked subunits - alpha (hCGalpha) and beta (hCGbeta) is physiologically produced by the placenta [13]. Numerous studies demonstrated that besides placenta and malignant trophoblastic disease, varieties of tumors of different origin secreted hCG and especially its beta-subunit [3,14,15]. As previously demonstrated by Acevedo and Hartsock, in a nude mouse model, high expression of membrane-associated hCGbeta correlates with primary malignant growth and metastatic phenotype of cancer [14].

The findings of present study indicate the hCGbeta gene is active in uterine cervix cancers. In all 15 specimens of the cervical carcinomas that were analyzed, the transcripts of hCGbeta were present. Even in slightly advanced carcinomas such as carcinoma of uterine cervix, FIGO stage 0, IA we found the mRNA of hCGbeta. At the same time we showed that tissue lacking the cancerous changes did not express hCGbeta mRNA. The RT-PCR results were proofed by immunohistochemical analysis, which revealed that hCG is expressed in cancer cells within a cervical carcinoma. Thus, the expression of hCGbeta is a characteristic feature of cervical tumor tissue, however the role of hCG in tumorogenesis is unknown.

The discovery of the crystal structure of hCG demonstrated that dimeric hCG forms the cystine knot structure [16]. The structure of hCG resembles the structure of known growth factors, namely TGFbeta (Transforming Growth Factor), NGF (Nerve Growth Factor) and PDGFbeta (Platelet Derived Growth factor) [16,17]. It was actually shown that subjection of an hCGbeta-secreting bladder tumor cell line to stimulation by hCGbeta in vitro led to an increase in cell number, in a dose dependent manner [4].

Guided by these observations we reasoned that the reduction of the hormone level would result in decrease of cell viability. We used a new strategy to knock down the expression of hCGbeta in cultured cervix carcinoma cells. Mammalian U1 snRNP contains ten proteins bound to U1 snRNA and binds to the exon-intron boundary of pre-mRNA to direct early steps of splicosome formation [18]. Binding involves the interaction between nucleotides 2-11 of the human U1 snRNA and the 5' splice site of pre-mRNA. A modified U1 snRNA can be used as an alternative to siRNA, antisense RNA or ribozyme approach for reducing the mRNA output of a target gene. In our study we examined whether binding of modified U1 snRNAs to 10 nucleotide regions within the terminal exon of human chorionic gonadotropin beta subunit was able to inhibit the hormone synthesis.

We demonstrated that U1 complementary to three different target regions of hCGbeta pre-mRNA results in suppression of the hormone expression both on the mRNA and protein level. The fact that three different modified U1 snRNAs gave similar results would argue that hCGbeta reduction, as opposed to off-target effects by each modified U1 snRNA, is responsible for the effects we observe. Our results indicated that HeLa cells trasfected with U1 snRNA anti-hCGbeta constructs showed 2-3-fold inhibition of human chorionic gonadotropin beta subunit transcripts. In cancer cells expressing the modified U1 snRNAs hCG protein was undetectable. Further analysis showed that knocking down gonadotropin expression significantly increases the apoptosis rate what was shown by flow cytometry and morphological changes characteristic for apoptotic process. Thus, the inhibition of the beta subunit of human chorionic gonadotropin expression leads to induction of programmed cell death.

It was already shown that the addition of anti-hCGbeta antibodies to the culture media of bladder cancer cell line inhibit the growth of the cells which produce endogenous free hCGbeta [4]. Furthermore Rivera et al., as a result of applying the antisense RNA specific to hCGbeta, demonstrated the loss of tumorogenic potential of human lung cancer cells (ChaGo cells), cultured in vitro [19]. Also the transfection of an antisense chorionic gonadotropin beta gene into choriocarcinoma cells suppressed cell proliferation and increased the apoptosis-positive rate of JAr cells [20].

Recent reports suggest that free hCGbeta is acting as a growth-stimulating factor, but the population growth is not the result of increased replication rate but of reduction in cell apoptosis [3,21]. Since the induction of epithelial cell apoptosis is a well-established action of TGFbeta and the topological homology of hCGbeta and TGFbeta was previously shown it was suggested that the anti-apoptotic effect of hCGbeta could potentially occur by blocking the TGFbeta receptor. Blocking of the receptor by free hCGbeta could prevent any further interactions with other components that are necessary for initiating cytoplasmic signaling that leads to apoptosis [3].

The inhibition of hCGbeta expression by modified U1 snRNAs caused apoptosis both in cells expressing U1 anti-hCGbeta construct as well as in neighbouring cells, lacking the modified U1 snRNA. This neighboring cell effect could be explained by a decreased level of hCGbeta in culture medium, which allows the interactions between the receptor and ligands essential for induction of apoptosis. Therefore our results are in good agreement with the date published previously.

To quantify the amount of hCGbeta and GAPDH (internal control) in HeLa cells after RNA isolation, reverse transcription real-time PCR with LightCycler 2.0 (Roche Diagnostics) and LightCycler FastStart DNA Master SYBR Green I Kit (Roche Diagnostics) was performed. 20 mul of PCR reaction mixture contain: 2.5 mM of MgCl2, 2 mul of SYBR Green 1 mix, 2 mul of cDNA and a 0.5 muM of each primer. hCGbeta primers sequence was as described above and GAPDH primers were designed as follow: sense - 5'-CAG CCT CAA GAT CAT CAG C-3' and antisense - 5'-GAC TGT GGT CAT GAG TCC TCC-3' [GenBank:]. The amplification program consisted of 1 cycle of 95degreesC with a 10 min hold, followed by 45 cycles of 95degreesC with a 10 s hold, annealing temperature at 62degreesC (hCGbeta) or 58degreesC (GAPDH) with a 5 s hold, and 72degreesC with a 9 s hold. An additional step was added for fluorescence data acquisition at an elevated temperature for hCGbeta amplification, which is 88degreesC with a 2 s hold. This was followed by melting curve analysis, which ran for 1 cycle at 95degreesC with a 0 s hold, 65degreesC with a 15 s hold, and 95degreesC with a 0 s hold at the step acquisition mode.

3 modified U1 snRNA anti-hCGbeta constructs designated 702P/767A, 702P/767B and 702P/767C were created by PCR-directed mutagenesis of the 5' sequence between bases +2 to +11 of a U1 snRNA expression plasmid following previously described methods (9, 10). Bases +2 to +11 of U1 snRNA normally complement the 5' splice donor but when mutated, as in these anti-hCGbeta constructs, result in a U1 snRNA able to basepair to a target sequence in the 3' terminal exon of the human hCGbeta pre-mRNA.

The cells were harvested after treatment fixed in cold 70% ethanol. Fixed cells were subsequently washed and treated with 100 mug/ml RNAse A, and stained with 50 mug/ml propidium iodide. Analyses were performed with BD Facs Calibur. Three parallel samples were measured and no less than 10 000 cells were tested in one sample. Cell cycle distributions were analyses by BD Cell Questtrade mark Pro ver.5.2.1 software.
