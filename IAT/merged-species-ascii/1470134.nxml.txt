Exposure of mesothelial cells to asbestos fibers in vitro has been shown to induce DNA damage mediated by oxidants. An early cellular response to DNA damage is increased expression of the p53 protein. This protein induces transcription of genes that activate cell cycle checkpoints or induce apoptosis. A murine mesothelial cell line that spontaneously acquired a point mutation in the p53 gene shows increased sensitivity to DNA damage induced by crocidolite asbestos fibers. It is hypothesized that p53-deficient mice will show increased sensitivity to the genotoxic effects of asbestos and accelerated development of malignant mesotheliomas.
