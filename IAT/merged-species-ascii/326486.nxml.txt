The entire threonine operon (thrABC) of Escherichia coli K12 was cloned, and the nucleotide sequence of the thrC gene and its 3' flanking region was determined. The translation initiation codon was identified by sequencing the N-terminal part of threonine synthase, the thrC gene product. Analysis of the deduced protein sequence (428 amino acid residues) revealed a region of homology, 35 amino acids long, between the three enzymes encoded by the threonine operon. During examination of the nucleotide sequence of the 1045 base pair fragments following the thrC gene, we detected some potential rho-independent and rho-dependent transcription termination signals.
