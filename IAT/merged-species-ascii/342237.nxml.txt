The nucleotide sequence of the O gene in bacteriophage lambda DNA is presented. According to two possible initiator codons, the primary structure of the O protein deduced from the DNA sequence consists of 278 or 299 amino acid residues. Structure and function of the O protein--one of the two phage initiator proteins for lambda DNA replication--are discussed in the light of a secondary structure model for the O protein. The central part of the O gene contains a cluster of symmetrical sequences extending over 160 base pairs. The point mutation of the cis-dominant replication mutant ti12 is located in this region.
