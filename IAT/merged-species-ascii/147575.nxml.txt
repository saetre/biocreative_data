QSR1 is a highly conserved gene which encodes a 60S ribosomal subunit protein that is required for joining of large and small ribosomal subunits. In this report we demonstrate heterologous complementation of a yeast QSR1 deletion strain with both the human and corn homologs and show that the human and corn proteins are assembled into hybrid yeast/human and yeast/corn ribosomes. While the homologous genes complement lethality of the QSR1 deletion, they also result in a diminished growth rate. Analyses of the translation rates of ribosomes containing the human and corn proteins reveal a partial loss of function. Velocity gradient analyses of the hybrid ribosomes after exposure to high concentrations of salt indicate that the decreased activity is due to lability of the hybrid 60S subunits.
