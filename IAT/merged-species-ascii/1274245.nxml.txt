Human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 (HTLV-1) is associated with the development of adult T-cell leukemia (ATL). HTLV-1 encoded Tax1 oncoprotein activates the transcription of genes involved in cell growth and anti-apoptosis through the NF-kappaB pathway, and is thought to play a critical role in the pathogenesis of ATL. While Tax1 expression is usually lost or minimal in ATL cells, these cells still show high constitutive NF-kappaB activity, indicating that genetic or epigenetic changes in ATL cells induce activation independent of Tax1. The aim of this study was to identify the molecules responsible for the constitutive activation of NF-kappaB in ATL cells using a retroviral functional cloning strategy.

Using enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) expression and blasticidin-resistance as selection markers, several retroviral cDNA clones exhibiting constitutive NF-kappaB activity in Rat-1 cells, including full-length CD30, were obtained from an ATL cell line. Exogenous stable expression of CD30 in Rat-1 cells constitutively activated NF-kappaB. Elevated expression of CD30 was identified in all ATL lines examined, and primary ATL cells from a small number of patients (8 out of 66 cases).

Adult T-cell leukemia (ATL) is an extremely aggressive human CD4+ T-cell leukemia (reviewed in [1]). ATL is resistant to chemotherapy and most patients die within one year of diagnosis. Human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 (HTLV-1) infection of CD4+ T-cells is the first step in ATL development. However, this alone is not sufficient for the development of leukemia because a minority of HTLV-1 infected subjects (approximately 5%) develop ATL on average 60-70 years after the infection (reviewed in [2,3]). In vitro, HTLV-1 transforms primary human CD4+ T-cells in an interleukin (IL)-2-dependent or an IL-2-independent manner. HTLV-1 encoded Tax1 protein is thought to play a critical role in T-cell transformation and leukemogenesis, as Tax1 itself immortalizes primary human CD4+ T-cells in vitro [4,5] and inhibits apoptosis induced by various stimuli in T-cell lines [6-9].

Tax1 is a multifunctional protein (reviewed in [2,3]). It activates the transcription of many cellular genes associated with cell growth, such as genes encoding cytokines [10-13], cytokine receptors [14-17], anti-apoptotic protein [8,18], cell cycle regulators [19-22], and proto-oncogenes [23]. Those proteins are thought to contribute to the deregulated proliferation of HTLV-1-infected cells. Accumulating evidence suggests that activation of cellular genes by Tax1, particularly through the nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) pathway, is a critical process in transformation as well as the inhibition of apoptosis. For example, the transforming activity of Tax1 is abrogated by mutations that impair the ability of Tax1 to activate NF-kappaB [24-26]. Tax1 inhibits apoptosis of mouse T-cell lines by induction of the anti-apoptotic gene Bcl-xL through NF-kappaB activation [8,18].

In resting T-cells, NF-kappaB factors are sequestered in the cytoplasm, tightly associated with inhibitory proteins IkappaBs. Activation of NF-kappaB generally involves phosphorylation and degradation of IkappaBs, followed by nuclear translocation of NF-kappaB dimers and subsequent activation of the genes containing NF-kappaB binding sites (reviewed in [27]). Alternatively, NF-kappaB activation occurs by inducible processing of NFKB2/p100 with IkappaB-like inhibitory activity, into p52 with DNA binding activity, followed by nuclear translocation of p52 containing NF-kappaB dimers (reviewed in [28]). These two processes are largely dependent on an IkappaB kinase (IKK) complex comprised of two catalytic subunits, IKKalpha and IKKbeta and a regulatory subunit IKKgamma/NEMO. Tax1 interacts with the IKK complex through these three subunits and stimulates the catalytic activity [29-32].

In primary ATL cells as well as cell lines established from ATL patients, NF-kappaB is constitutively active as seen in HTLV-1 transformed cells [33]. It appears that this constitutive NF-kappaB activation contributes to the survival and chemotherapy resistance of ATL cells, since treatment of ATL cells with a NF-kappaB inhibitor, Bay 11-7082, induces apoptosis of these cells [34]. However, how NF-kappaB is constitutively activated in ATL cells is still largely unknown since the tax gene is mutated in some ATL cases [35,36] or the level of expression of Tax1 in these cells is extremely low, thereby being clearly insufficient to activate NF-kappaB [37,38]. There may be genetic or epigenetic changes that lead to tax-independent NF-kappaB activation, such as a gain of function of the NF-kappaB activating molecule(s) or a loss of function of the NF-kappaB regulator(s). The elucidation of the molecular mechanism of NF-kappaB activation in ATL cells is quite important in the light of prevention, diagnosis and treatment of ATL.

In order to identify the molecule(s) responsible for the constitutive NF-kappaB activation in ATL, we took a functional screening approach using a retroviral cDNA library from an ATL cell line and a reporter cell line that is easily distinguishable as a positive clone once NF-kappaB is activated. We obtained several cDNA clones that constitutively activate NF-kappaB. One of these, the full-length CD30, is a member of the TNF receptor superfamily and a marker of malignant Hodgkin and Reed-Sternberg (H-RS) cells in Hodgkin's lymphoma (HL) (reviewed in [39,40]). It is suggested that overexpression of CD30 in H-RS cells and HL cell lines contributes to CD30 ligand-independent constitutive NF-kappaB activation in these cells [41]. The results showed that CD30 is strongly expressed in all ATL cell lines examined, and that CD30 is expressed in primary ATL cells in a small number of ATL patients.

In order to identify the molecule(s) responsible for the constitutive NF-kappaB activation in ATL cells, we employed a functional screening strategy using a retroviral cDNA library from an ATL cell line. In theory, if ATL cells express NF-kappaB activating molecules leading to the constitutive activation, it would be possible to obtain such clones using NF-kappaB activation as a positive selection marker (Figure 1A). We generated a retroviral cDNA library from ATL cell line TL-OmI, which had already been shown to have constitutive NF-kappaB activity in the absence of Tax1 [33]. As a reporter cell line, we generated a Rat-1 fibroblast cell line with a stably integrated blasticidin deaminase gene (bsr) fused to enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) under five repeats of the NF-kappaB binding sequences from the IL-2 receptor alpha chain and the minimal HTLV-1 promoter [42]. The bsr and EGFP enabled us to easily identify NF-kappaB activated cells as surviving cells with green fluorescence in the presence of blasticidin. A pilot experiment, however, showed that the green fluorescent signal from this fusion protein in the cells after NF-kappaB activation stimuli (such as TNF-alpha treatment) was extremely low, probably due to the short half life of the fusion protein or a conformational change that interferes with EGFP activity (data not shown). Thus, we further stably transfected the EGFP gene regulated under the same NF-kappaB responsive promoter into the reporter cell line. This new reporter cell line, named Rat-1 kappaB-bsrEGFPx2, showed bright EGFP signals and blasticidin resistance after TNF-alpha treatment (Figure 1B and data not shown). This doubly transfected cell line has a critical advantage in this screening system. It is possible that retroviral cDNA is inserted near the bsrEGFP gene and the retroviral long terminal repeat (LTR) constitutively activates the expression of the bsrEGFP gene, resulting in a false positive clone. However, if it occurs in the new reporter cell line, these cells should have minimal EGFP signals because of the extremely low fluorescence intensity of the fusion protein and such cells could be easily eliminated during the screening process.

Strategy for cloning NF-kappaB activating molecules. A) A retroviral cDNA library from an ATL cell line is transduced to a reporter cell line expressing EGFP and bsr in response to NF-kappaB activation. Blasticidin-resistant and EGFP expressing cell clones are expanded and cDNA clones are obtained by PCR using the retrovirus vector specific primers. B) Visualization of NF-kappaB activation in reporter cells. Reporter cells were stimulated with TNF-alpha for 48 hours and tested for the expression of EGFP by FACS analysis.

After converting the plasmid library to the retroviral library by introduction into packaging cells, the resultant viruses were transduced into the Rat-1 kappaB-bsrEGFPx2 reporter cells. After selection in the presence of blasticidin, under an inverted fluorescence microscope, EGFP-positive cells were picked up and expanded, followed by genomic DNA extraction. PCR products amplified by the primers specific for the retroviral vector were cloned and the sequences were determined. Following three independent screenings, we obtained a total of 64 clones (Table 1).

NF-kappaB inducing kinase (NIK) is a mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase (MAP3K), which is involved in NFKB2/p100 processing and nuclear translocation of p52/RelB dimers, the so-called noncanonical pathway [43]. This pathway is activated by lymphotoxin-beta (LT-beta), CD40 ligand, and B cell activating factor (BAFF) and depends on IKKbeta (reviewed in [28]). All the NIK clones we obtained possessed the intact kinase domain and the N-terminal amino acid deletion, starting at codon 417. It has been reported that the N-terminus of NIK contains a negative-regulatory domain and an N-terminal truncation mutant has higher NF-kappaB inducing activity than the wild type [44]. It is likely that this deletion was introduced by incomplete reverse transcription with oligo dT primer during the cDNA library construction process. It is interesting to note that none of the other MAP3Ks that can activate NF-kappaB, such as MEKK1 [45], were cloned. This selective isolation of NIK as well as its high frequency among the NF-kappaB-inducing clones indicates that NIK and/or the noncanonical pathway may play a central role in the constitutive NF-kappaB activation seen in various tumors.

The sequences of the two LT-beta receptor (LT-betaR) clones were identical and encoded a part of the cytoplasmic domain of the receptor (from codon 268 to 395). The retrovirus vector used in our experiments transcribes two mRNAs, one spliced and one unspliced. The unspliced mRNA may translate fusion genes of gag with inserted cDNA when they are in frame. The isolated LT-betaR clone is in frame with gag and could be expressed as a fusion protein, which might induce constitutive NF-kappaB activation. This cloned LT-betaR mutant is likely to be an artificial one generated during the library construction process as discussed above.

The receptor-interacting protein 2 (Rip2) is a serine/threonine kinase that contains a caspase-recruitment domain (CARD) at its carboxyl terminus and has been shown to induce NF-kappaB activation in an over-expression system [46]. Rip2 has been implicated in regulating both the innate and adaptive immune responses [47,48]. Recently, it has been reported that Rip2 participates in Bcl10-mediated NF-kappaB activation [49]. The Rip2 clone isolated in our study is full length and not in frame with gag. It is possible that Rip2 is over-expressed in ATL cells and this contributes to constitutive NF-kappaB activation. This hypothesis is currently under investigation.

CD30 is a member of the TNF receptor super family and is known as a marker of malignant Hodgkin and Reed-Sternberg (H-RS) cells in Hodgkin's lymphoma (HL). It has been suggested that overexpression of CD30 in H-RS cells and HL cell lines contributes to CD30 ligand (CD30L)-independent constitutive NF-kappaB activation in these cells [41]. The same possibility in ATL cells was further examined. One of the three CD30 clones (named kBL1) contains full-length CD30 in frame with gag (the other two clones were not completely sequenced). As described above, the retrovirus vector used in our experiments transcribes two mRNAs, one is a spliced one and the other is an unspliced one. The unspliced mRNA can translate fusion genes of gag with inserted cDNA when they are in frame. To determine that the fusion between CD30 and gag is responsible for its constitutive NF-kappaB inducing activity, we generated a retroviral vector that expresses only full-length CD30 by introducing a frame shift mutation upstream of the CD30 open reading frame of the cloned gene. We also constructed a retroviral vector for full-length CD30 cDNA (pMX CD30WT) out of frame with gag. Retroviral vectors for CD30 either in or out of frame with gag (pMX kBL1 or pMX kBL1DeltaBglII respectively) and pMX CD30WT were introduced into packaging cells and the Rat-1-bsrEGFPx2 cells were infected with the resultant viruses. After 48 hours, EGFP signals were examined by fluorescence activated cell sorter (FACS) analysis. In all three cases, CD30 induced constitutive NF-kappaB activation, although CD30 in frame with gag had stronger NF-kappaB inducing activity, which means the fusion with gag indeed augments the activity (Figure 2). This result demonstrates that stably overexpressed CD30 can induce constitutive NF-kappaB activation in a ligand independent manner in Rat-1 cells, as described previously in human embryonic kidney cell line 293 [41].

We next examined CD30 expression in ATL-derived T-cell lines, HTLV-1 transformed cell lines and HTLV-1 negative T-cell lines using FACS analysis (Figure 3). All ATL cell lines (TL-OmI, KOB, KK1 and ST1) showed strong CD30 expression whereas a B lymphoma cell line (BJAB) showed no staining (Figure 3A). HTLV-1 transformed cell lines (HUT-102, C5/MJ, MT-4 and SLB-1) also showed CD30 expression but the amount of the expression was various and lower than TL-OmI (Figure 3B). In HTLV-1 negative T-cell lines (Jurkat and MOLT-4), the expression of CD30 was significantly lower than TL-OmI (Figure 3C). Interestingly, NF-kappaB activity was much lower in Jurkat and MOLT-4 than ATL cell lines. Thus CD30 expression level is well correlated with the NF-kappaB activity, which suggests that overexpression of CD30 might be at least one of the factors that contributes to constitutive NF-kappaB activation in ATL cell lines. In HTLV-1 transformed cells, NF-kappaB activation is thought to be largely dependent on Tax1, however it is possible that relatively strong CD30 expression in HUT-102 and SLB-1 also contributes to constitutive NF-kappaB activation in these cells. In addition, CD30L expressed in ATL cell lines may possibly contribute to CD30 activation by a cell-cell contact mechanism. RT-PCR analysis for CD30 ligand showed that CD30L expression in TL-OmI cells was extremely weak compared with a Burkitt lymphoma cell line (EB-1), in which CD30L is weakly expressed (data not shown) [50]. This finding suggests that CD30L is not involved in the constitutive NF-kappaB activation in TL-OmI cells.

Next, we examined CD30 expression in primary ATL cells by FACS analysis. Peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBLs), lymph node cells, or ascitic fluid cells from ATL patients were stained with anti-CD30 antibody (Figure 4 and Table 2). ATL cases in which more than 30% of the cells expressed CD30 were classified as CD30-positive ones. CD30 expression was seen in 8 of 66 ATL cases (12.1%) and the CD30 expression was predominantly seen in the acute type (5 of 25 cases), representing the advanced stage of ATL (Figure 4B). Data of the FACS analysis (CD3, CD4, CD8, CD25, and CD30 expression) of the CD30-positive ATL cases are summarized in Table 2.

It has been reported that proteolytic cleavage of membrane-anchored CD30 releases a soluble fragment corresponding to the extracellular domain [51]. To examine the possibility that the low frequency of CD30 expression in primary ATL cells in the FACS analysis is due to this proteolytic processing, CD30 mRNA expression was examined in 8 ATL cases different from those used in the FACS analysis. Strong CD30 mRNA expression was seen in HUT-102 and PBLs activated by phytohemagglutinin (PHA), whereas the CD30 expression was seen in only one case (ATL8) diagnosed as the lymphoma type (Figure 5). The amount of CD30 mRNA expression in this case was lower than HUT-102 and it might not be sufficient to induce NF-kappaB activation by itself. However it is possible that weak CD30 expression still contributes to the constitutive NF-kappaB activation in cooperation with other signaling molecules in vivo. In summery, these FACS and RT-PCR data suggest that the expression of CD30 in ATL is not a common event and is limited to a small number of ATL cases. This is consistent with a previous report that CD30 expression was seen in 7 out of 36 cases (19.4%) when their lymph node biopsies were immunohistochemically stained with anti-CD30 antibody [52].

The reason for the discrepancy between ATL cell lines and primary ATL cells in terms of CD30 expression is unknown at present. One possibility is that only CD30-positive primary ATL cells could be established as a cell line in vitro because of their stronger NF-kappaB activity or activation of other signaling pathways originating from CD30. In fact, CD30 activates not only NF-kappaB but also the mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways, such as extracellular regulated kinase (ERK), Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), and p38 MAPK pathways [53,54].

Recently, it has been reported that the noncanonical pathway is involved in constitutive NF-kappaB activation in ATL cells [55]. Although activation of the noncanonical pathway by CD30 has not yet been reported, it is likely that CD30 activates this pathway through association with TNF receptor associated factors (TRAFs) like LT-betaR and CD40. In H-RS cells, which strongly express CD30, TRAF2 and TRAF5 make aggregates in the cytoplasm and co-localize with downstream signaling molecules, such as IKKalpha and IKKbeta [56]. It would be interesting to see whether TRAF2 and TRAF5 also form aggregates in ATL cell lines and primary ATL cells expressing CD30.

In order to confirm that CD30 is involved in constitutive NF-kappaB activation and cell survival in ATL cell lines, we tried to knockdown CD30 expression in these cells by using short-hairpin RNAs. We generated 11 different short-hairpin RNAs for CD30 in total, but none of them showed any RNA interference effect. We also tried to introduce a decoy CD30 that lacks most of the cytoplasmic region and has been shown to induce apoptosis in H-RS cells [41], by using an adenovirus vector. However we were unable to obtain a sufficiently high titer adenovirus as a decoy CD30 mutant to carry out the experiment. Thus, whether elevated expression of CD30 actually contributes to constitutive NF-kappaB activation in ATL cell lines still remains unknown.
###end p 39
###begin p 40
In this regard, the mechanism by which NF-kappaB is constitutively activated in ATL cells still remains a mystery. However, our data suggest that the elevated expression of CD30 plays a critical role in NF-kappaB activation in ATL cell lines and a small number of primary ATL cells. Other molecules belonging to the TNF receptor family, such as LT-betaR, OX40, or downstream signaling molecules, could be involved in constitutive NF-kappaB activation in CD30-negative ATL cells, and the identification of such molecules would contribute to the prevention, diagnosis and treatment of ATL.

ATL cells have constitutive NF-kappaB activity which is important for the cells' survival. This NF-kappaB activation is independent of Tax protein expression. By screening a retroviral cDNA library from an ATL cell line to identify NF-kappaB activating molecules, we obtained several cDNA clones including full-length CD30. CD30 is strongly expressed in ATL cell lines and primary ATL cells from a small number of patients. Our results suggest that elevated expression of CD30 is one of the factors responsible for constitutive NF-kappaB activation in ATL cells.

Rat-1, a rat fibroblast cell line, was cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS). Human T-cell lines used in the present experiments have been characterized previously [33,57]. Jurkat and MOLT-4 are HTLV-1 negative human T-cell lines. HUT-102, C5/MJ, MT-4 and SLB-1 are HTLV-1-positive human T-cell lines. TL-OmI, KK1 [58], KOB [59], and ST1 [60] are HTLV-1-positive, ATL-derived cell lines. These cells were cultured in RPMI 10% FBS. Recombinant human IL-2 (Takeda Chemical Industries, Osaka, Japan) was added at 0.5 nM to the culture of KK1, KOB and ST1. A retrovirus packaging cell line Plat-E [61] was cultured in DMEM 10% FBS containing 1 mug/ml puromycin (Calbiochem, La Jolla, CA) and 10 mug/ml blasticidin (Invitrogen, San Diego, CA).

The NF-kappaB reporter plasmid kappaB-EGFP was constructed by replacing the luciferase gene (a BglII - BamHI fragment) of the kappaB-Luc plasmid [42] with EGFP (a HindIII - AflII fragment) from pEGFP-N3 (Clontech Laboratories, Palo Alto, CA) by blunt-end ligation. To construct the plasmid kappaB-bsrEGFP, which expresses bsrEGFP fusion protein, a PCR amplified bsr gene fragment was inserted in the ApaI and BamHI sites upstream of EGFP of the kappaB-EGFP plasmid. To prepare a NF-kappaB reporter cell line, Rat-1 cells (5 x 106) were transfected with 20 mug of kappaB-bsrEGFP and 1 mug of pcDNA3 (Invitrogen) by electroporation at 250 V and 975 muF. The transfected cells were cultured in 500 mug/ml G418 (Invitrogen), and resistant clones were screened for EGFP signals after being infected with retroviruses that express Epstein-Barr virus transforming protein LMP1. The selected cell clone (Rat-1 kappaB-bsrEGFP) was further transfected with kappaB-EGFP and pMik-HygB and cultured in 250 mug/ml hygromycin B (Wako Pure Chemical Industries, Osaka, Japan). Resistant clones were screened for EGFP signals after stimulation with 20 ng/ml TNF-alpha (Peprotech, London, UK).

The retroviral vector pMX LMP1 was prepared by inserting an EcoRI - BamHI fragment of pSG5 F-LMP1 [63] in the EcoRI site of pMX by blunt-end ligation. pMX CD30WT was generated by inserting a MluI - NotI fragment of pCD30WT [64] in the EcoRI and NotI sites of pMX by blunt-end ligation. pMX kBL1 was generated by inserting a BamHI - SfiI fragment of pGEMT kBL1 in the BamHI - NotI sites of pMX. The BglII site of pMX kBL1 was destroyed by cutting by BglII, filling in by T4 polymerase, and self-ligation to make pMX kBL1DeltaBglII.

Heparinized peripheral blood, a piece of a lymph node, or ascites (in case no. 8) was collected from patients with ATL after obtaining informed consent in accordance with the Helsinki Declaration. Mononuclear cells were separated by Lymphopreptrade mark density gradient centrifugation (Axis-Shield PoC AS, Oslo, Norway). Morphological and surface marker analyses indicated that ATL cells in these samples always accounted for more than 80% of the total cell population in most cases. The study protocol was approved by the Human Ethics Review Committee of Nagasaki University Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences.

Primary ATL cells or T-cell lines were incubated for 30 min at 4degreesC with each PE-labeled or FITC-labeled monoclonal antibody (mAb). Cells were also incubated with isotype matched control antibodies. The following antibodies were used: PE-labeled mouse anti-human CD4 and CD25, FITC-labeled anti CD3 and CD8 (BD Biosciences Pharmingen, San Diego, CA); and PE-labeled mouse anti-human CD30 (Dako Corporation, Carpinteria, CA or Immunotech, Marseille, France). After washing with PBS, the cells were analyzed on FACScan flow cytometer using Cellquest software (Becton Dickinson, San Jose, CA).

Total cellular RNA was extracted with Trizol (Invitrogen) according to the protocol provided by the manufacturer. First-strand cDNA was synthesized from 1 mug total cellular RNA in a 20-mul reaction volume using an RNA PCR kit (Takara Shuzo, Kyoto, Japan) with random primers. Thereafter, cDNA was amplified for 35 cycles for CD30 and 28 cycles for beta-actin. The oligonucleotide primers used were as follows: for CD30, sense, 5'-CTGTGTCCCCTACCCAATCT-3' and antisense, 5'-CTTCTTTCCCTTCCTCTTCCA-3'; [65] and for beta-actin, sense, 5'-GTGGGGCGCCCCAGGCACCA-3' and antisense, 5'-CTCCTTAATGTCACGCACGATTTC-3'. Product sizes were 860-bp for CD30 and 548-bp for beta-actin. Cycling conditions were as follows: denaturing at 94degreesC for 45 sec (for CD30) or for 30 sec (for beta-actin), annealing at 62degreesC for 45 sec (for CD30) or 60degreesC for 30 sec (for beta-actin) and extension at 72degreesC for 60 sec (for CD30) or for 90 sec (for beta-actin). The PCR products were fractionated on 2% agarose gels and visualized by ethidium bromide staining.
