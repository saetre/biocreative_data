All Drosophila alcohol dehydrogenase (Adh) genes sequenced to date contain two small introns within the coding region. These are conserved in location and, to some extent, in sequence between the various species analyzed. To determine if these introns play a role in Adh gene expression, derivatives of the Drosophila affinidisjuncta Adh gene lacking one or both introns were constructed and analyzed by germline and transient transformation of Drosophila melanogaster. Removal of both introns lowered expression, whether measured by enzyme activity or by RNA levels. The decrease was seen in both germline transformed and transiently transformed larvae, with the effect being larger for germline transformants. Similar decreases (averaging 5-fold) were also seen at the embryonic and adult stages for germline transformants. Nuclear run-off transcription with nuclei from germline transformed embryos indicated that the reduction in RNA levels is due to decreased transcription. However, LacZ fusion constructs designed to test for the presence of a classical enhancer in the introns provided no evidence for such a mechanism. Removal of each intron individually resulted in more complex phenotypes. The introns have smaller, additive effects on expression in adults. In larvae, removal of the upstream intron significantly increases RNA levels but modestly decreases enzyme activity. Removal of the downstream intron lowers expression in both germline and transiently transformed larvae, but also increases position effects in germline transformants. Therefore, the small introns are clearly needed for optimal transcription of this Adh gene, but multiple mechanisms are involved.
