Mass spectrometry-based methods have been used to study post-transcriptional modification in the 1900-1974 nt segment of domain IV in 23S rRNA of Escherichia coli, a region which interacts with domain V in forming the three- dimensional structure of the peptidyl transferase center within the ribosome. A nucleoside constituent of M r 258 (U*)which occurs at position 1915, within the highly modified oligonucleotide sequence 1911-psiAACU*Apsi-1917, was characterized as 3-methylpseudouridine (m3psi). The assignment was confirmed by chemical synthesis of m3psi and comparison with the natural nucleoside by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. 3-Methylpseudouridine is previously unknown in nature and is the only known derivative of the common modified nucleoside pseudouridine thus far found in bacterial rRNA.
