Studies on the beta-globin gene complex in the mouse have demonstrated the existence of repeated DNA sequences interspersed throughout the intergenic regions (1,2). These sequences are members of families of middle repetitive sequences and have been mapped to specific intergenic sites in the 60 kbp beta-globin complex. In this study we present evidence that members of this middle repetitive family of DNA sequences, the L1Md family, are interspersed throughout the mouse albumin and alpha-fetoprotein gene complex. Unlike those of the beta-globin complex, all of which are found in the intergenic regions, these sequences are localized within intron 12 of the albumin gene and intron 3 of the AFP gene as well as twice in the 13.5 kbp intergenic region that links the albumin gene to the AFP gene.
