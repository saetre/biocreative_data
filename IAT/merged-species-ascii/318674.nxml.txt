The nucleotide sequence for an unusual, cloned human adenosine deaminase cDNA has been determined. Contained within a sequence of 1535 nucleotides is a coding sequence of 1089 nucleotides that encodes a protein of 40,762 daltons. The coding sequence is interrupted by a non-coding region containing 76 nucleotides. Both the 3' and 5' ends of this region have consensus sequences generally associated with splice sites. The 3' untranslated sequence contained 308 nucleotides, including a polyadenylation signal sequence 20 nucleotides from the end. The cloned cDNA appears to correspond to a nuclear mRNA precursor which contains a small intron.
