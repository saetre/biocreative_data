Previous analyses of the uteroglobin gene promoter revealed a GT1 box which is also found in the SV40 enhancer. The GT1 element in the context of the uteroglobin promoter is active in Ishikawa cells, a human endometrial cell line, but not in HeLa cells. Here we report the cloning by recognition site screening of two factors (SPR-1 and SPR-2) which bind to this GT1 motif. SPR-1 and SPR-2 are homologues of the transcription factor Sp1. All three proteins are closely related members of a gene family encoding proteins with very similar structural features. Like Sp1, SPR-1 and SPR-2 contain glutamine and serine/threonine rich amino acid stretches. Most significantly, the DNA binding domains of all three proteins are highly conserved and they recognize GT as well as GC boxes identically. SPR-2 mRNA is expressed ubiquitously, whereas SPR-1 transcripts are abundant in the brain but barely detectable in other organs. The possible function of these factors for the activity of the uteroglobin promoter is discussed.
