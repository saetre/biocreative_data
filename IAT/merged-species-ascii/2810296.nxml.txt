Background

###begin p 2
The multifunctional protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) is a heterotrimeric serine/threonine protein phosphatase composed of a scaffolding, catalytic and regulatory subunits. By modifying various downstream signal transducers, the aberrant expression of the brain-targeted regulatory subunit PPP2R2B is associated with the onset of a panel of neuronal disorders. The alternatively splicing of PPP2R2B encodes two regulatory subunit isoforms that determine cellular distribution of the neuron-specific holoenzyme to mitochondria (Bbeta2) and cytoplasm (Bbeta1), respectively.

Human neuroblastoma cells were transfected with PPP2R2B constructs encoding the complete sequences of Bbeta2 and Bbeta1, respectively. The colonies with antibiotic resistance were selected as stable cell lines. Both ectopic Bbeta1 and Bbeta2 clones exhibited characteristics of autophagy. To test how cells respond to reactive oxygen species generators, the cells were treated with either hydrogen peroxide or t-butyl hydroperoxide and Bbeta2 clones induced cell death. Suppression of autophagy using either RNA interference of the essential autophagy gene or pharmacological inhibitor rescued cell death caused by oxidative stress.

Conclusions
###end title 5
###begin p 6
Cells with ectopically expressed mitochondria-targeted regulatory subunit PPP2R2B of the holoenzyme PP2A were shown predisposed to autophagy and oxidative stress induced cell death that is related to apoptosis. The results promised a model for studying the mechanism and function of aberrant PPP2R2B expression in neuronal cells. The work provided a new target for understanding and prevention of neuropathogenesis.

Protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) regulates cellular proliferation and tissue growth by antagonizing protein kinases and plays an important role in controlling cell cycle checkpoints, regulating nuclear telomerase activity and modulating dephosphorylation of neurofilaments [1-5]. It is believed that the enzyme flexibility and the substrate specificity are determined by the regulatory subunit (B) that binds to the ubiquitous catalytic (C) and scaffolding (A) subunits [6] to form the heterotrimeric PP2A.

The regulatory B subunits can be categorized into three distinct families based on their homology, namely B (B55 or PR55), B' (B56 or PR61), B"(PR48/59/72/130) and B' " (PR93/110). Furthermore, each B family is composed of several isoforms from different genes [7,8]. There is no sequence or structural similarities among the three gene families. The brain-specific regulatory B subunit, PPP2R2B (Bbeta), is widely expressed in the neurons of brain and cerebellum and consists of tryptophan-glutamate repeat-containing beta-propeller proteins. The various N termini of B subunit determine enzyme activity, subcellular localizations and neuronal functions of PP2A [3,9,10]. Mainly expressed in Purkinje cells of the cerebellar cortex [5,11,12] and in tissues of spinocerebellar ataxia [13,14], PPP2R2B is also known in mediating PP2A-regulated dephosphorylation of several substrates; they include vimentin [15] and histone-1 [16] as well as microtube-associated protein in neuron cells [17].

The alternative splicing of PPP2R2B generates two major isoforms. They include Bbeta1 and Bbeta2 with two distinct N terminal tails [5]. The different N termini with 21 and 24 residues of Bbeta1 and Bbeta2 each encode distinctive subcellular signals that target PPP2R2B isoforms to cytoplasm and mitochondria, respectively, and affect cellular phosphatase activity [18]. The up-regulated mitochondrial Bbeta2 was reported promoting apoptosis in response to deprived growth factors [19], while an elevated expression of cytosolic Bbeta1 due to CAG repeat expansion at the 5' end of the gene causes autosomal dominant disease of spinocerebellar ataxia type 12 (SCA12) [20].

The aberrant expression of brain-specific PPP2R2B affecting PP2A activity has been implicated in cerebellar atrophy [12]. Translocation of PPP2R2B to mitochondria promotes mitochondria fission, apoptosis [21] and neuronal differentiation [19]. Being implicated in neurodegenerative diseases, oxidative stress causes neuron cell damage and reduction of viable cells. How cells with overexpressed PPP2R2B react to environmental stress remains unclear. Mitochondria are the principal targets for reactive oxygen species (ROS). To address this, the work began with generation of stable cell lines by transferring Bbeta1 and Bbeta2, respectively, into human neuroblastoma SK-N-SH cells. The stable clones targeting ectopic PPP2R2B to mitochondria or cytoplasm exhibit characteristics of autophagy that is distinct from the parental cells. Furthermore, only Bbeta2 clones were sensitive to ROS treatment and susceptible to autophagy-mediated cell death. The resulting apoptosis can be suppressed by chemical inhibitor and RNA interference of the related autophagy gene, and thereby preventing cells from ROS damage-induced cell death. The work illustrates the significance of autophagy in maintaining viabilities of neuronal cells with ectopically transferred PPP2R2B as well as in accelerating pathogenesis when encountered with oxidative stress.

The expression of B family regulatory subunits regulates cell developmental patterns in brain [10]. The antibiotic-resistant clones from human neuroblastoma cells, SK-N-SH, through ectopic transfection of either Bbeta1 or Bbeta2 cDNA' s driven by cytomegalovirus promoter were established as stable cell lines that can be propagated in serum-supplemented media. In addition to the basal levels in SK-N-SH cells, three isolated clones exhibited increased immune-active signals by sequence-specific Bbeta2 antiserum (Bbeta2#3, Bbeta2#5 and Bbeta2#8, Fig 1A), while two were detected by Bbeta1 antiserum (Bbeta1#1 and Bbeta1#2, Fig 1C). A parallel increase of PP2A activities in the immunoprecipitates was also observed in the selected Bbeta2 (Fig 1B) and Bbeta1 (Fig 1D) clones that corresponded with their increased sensitivities to antisera in western blot. In contrast to the parental cells, the stable Bbeta2 clones tend to aggregate to form clusters in culture (data not shown).

The blots were detected with ECL system following incubation with secondary HRP-conjugated goat against rabbit antibody. The ectopic expressions of Bbeta2 were detected Bbeta2 (A) clones. Each blot was reprobed with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) antibody to confirm equal loading of the proteins.

The strong signals in clones by Bbeta2 antiserum overlapping with mitotracker green marked direct targeting of ectopic Bbeta2 at mitochondria (Fig 2A); while little overlay was detected between mitochondria and the increased signal as determined by Bbeta1 antiserum indicated cytoplasm distribution of Bbeta1 in the isolated clones (Fig 2B). Despite some degree of non-specific staining by the antisera, the results provided evidence that stable clones by targeting cytoplasm with ectopic Bbeta1 and mitochondria with Bbeta2, respectively, can be achieved.

An increased autophagy has been reported in human cells or tissues with neuronal injury [22,23]. We then assessed whether coordinated regulation of mitochondrial networks and autophagy-regulated cell viability can be recapitulated in clones with acquisition of PPP2R2B functions. As LC3 is modified with the lipid phospatidylethanolamine before being located to autophagosomes [24], the emitted fluorescence can be used to monitor autophagosome formation in cells through transient transfection with expression vector, green fluorescent protein-tagged light chain 3 (GFP-LC3). The results showed that GFP puncta that represented autophagy development can be detected in both Bbeta1 and Bbeta2 clones, but not in the parental cells (Fig 3). Thus, the presence of autophagosome is closely related to ectopically expressed PPP2R2B.

The two ROS generators H2O2 (Fig 4A) and t-butyl hydroperoxide (tBHP) (Fig 4B) suppressed growth in Bbeta2 clones in dose-dependent manners, while both Bbeta1 clones and SK-N-SH cells with empty vector alone were not affected. Compared with H2O2, the suppression of viable cells was more evident in tBHP that exerted more sensitivity in cells with ectopic Bbeta2. The escalated cell death is proportional to the levels of Bbeta2, in which Bbeta2#8 was more sensitive to peroxide treatment.

Cells growth curves as affected by various concentrations of H2O2 and tBHP. The exponentially growing SK-N-SH cells or Bbeta1 and Bbeta2 clones were seeded at a total of 2 x 105 cells per 6-cm plate and treated with different concentrations of H2O2 (0, 50 and 100 muM, respectively) (A) or tBHP (0, 50 and 100 nM, respectively) (B). After 48 h of treatment, the cells were trypsinized and counted by trypan blue exclusion assay. The result represented mean values of three individual determinations; the bars standard errors in three independent experiments as conducted. *P < 0.05, significance of difference as compared with the control group.

An increase of sub-G1 populations was also detected in Bbeta2 clones by H2O2 (Fig 5A) and tBHP (Fig 5B). The results indicated that the decrease of viable cells can be attributed to apoptotic cell death that was not observed in cells with ectopic Bbeta1. Thus, it is evident that the apoptotic cell death can be attributed to exogenous ROS in SK-N-SH cells with ectopic Bbeta2.

Autophagic stress can be morphologically recognized by accumulations of autophagic vacuoles in cells [22]. The autophagy marker protein LC3, a mammalian homolog of the yeast Atg8 protein, is covalently modified and redistributes to acidic vesicular organelles (AVO' s) with covalent lipidation as seen by mobility shift from LC3-I to LC3-II by SDS-PAGE. As shown by the acridine-orange staining (Fig 6A) and western blotting with LC-3 antibody (Fig 6B), induction of ROS accelerated cellular changes that are consistent with enhanced autophagy as indicated by the induced formation of AVO' s [25] and the increased lipidation of LC3 (LC3-II) in addition to the basal level. The effect was reverted by the autophagy inhibitor, 3-MA [26].

The inhibitor 3-MA suppressed autophagy development in cells with ectopic Bbeta2. (A) Autophagosome formation by acridine orange staining. Cells plated on coverslips in 6-well plates were either pretreated with (+) or without (-) autophagy inhibitor 3-MA before being given 50 nM tBHP for 48 h. The cells were then fixed and stained with acridine orange (green) and analyzed by fluorescence microscopy. The formation of autophagosome as shown in puncta fluorescence (red) can be suppressed by 3-MA. The presence of autophagy was found mainly in 100% of the cells after treatment, in which more than 100 cells were observed under each condition. Scales, 50 mum. Cells as pointed out by arrows were amplified as shown in the inset (2x). (B) Western blot probed with LC3 antibody The development of autophagy by tBHP in the presence (+) or absence (-) of 3-MA was analyzed by western blot analysis by incubating the blot with LC3 antibody. Levels of the 18-kDa LC3-I is visualized in both Bbeta2 and Bbeta1 clones. Elevated LC3-II, the 16-kDa form of LC3 specific for membranes of autophagosomes by tBHP in Bbeta2 clones was suppressed by 3-MA.

With no distinct affect on cell growth per se, 3-MA rescued Bbeta2 clones from peroxide-induced cell death (Fig 7A) by suppressing formation of apoptotic cells (Fig 7B) in dose dependent manner. Thus, the accelerated autophagy by peroxide injury antagonized cell survival with supplemented mitochondrial PPP2R2B. The ROS-induced growth inhibition became less evident as cells were pretreated with 3-MA. The addition of 3-MA that rescued apoptotic death in Bbeta2 clones reflects the role of autophagy that not only protects cells but initiated apoptotic cell death under oxidative stress.

More work was extended using siRNA-dependent knock-down expression of the essential autophagy gene ATG7 [27]. Transfection with ATG7-specific siRNA in Bbeta2 clones down-regulated ATG7 expression (Fig 8A), suppressed cell growth inhibition (Fig 8B) and interfered development of apoptosis (Fig 8C) by tBHP, while cells with transfer of the scrambled (SO) siRNA remained unaffected. Moreover, knock-down of ATG7 expression repressed tBHP-induced accumulation of the LC3-II isoform (Fig 8D), that further corroborated autophagy with the development of apoptosis.

PP2A deregulation has been vastly implicated in the onset of neurodegenerative diseases [28]. The mechanisms of PP2A activity responsible for the disrupted neuron function remain unclear and are far from being understood [29]. Intervention of normal brain or cerebellar PP2A function is crucial in the developing neurodegenerative pathology [30]. In an effort to learn how the increased expression of PPP2R2B isoforms affects cell growth, genes encoding proteins encoding different targeting sequences were transferred into human SK-N-SH cells. The clones with ectopically expressed PPP2R2B can be propagated as stable cell lines. Our work showed that discrete antisera cross-reactivity, in which mitochondria can be stained by Bbeta1 and cytoplasm by Bbeta2, respectively. To understand the function of the ectopic gene in the stable clones, it will be important to further analyze the fractions at subcellular levels.

The stable clones forming aggregation in culture exhibited autophagy characteristics that are distinct from the parental cells. Autophagy is a lysosome-dependent degradation pathway regulated by extracellular nutrients or trophic factors [31]. Cells exhibiting basal rate of autophagy maintain homeostasis and survival of neurons under stress that protects them from pathogenesis [32]. Despite their relatively slow growth rate compared to the parental cells (Fig 7A), clones with ectopic brain-specific subunit PPP2R2B were able to sustain minor increases of autophagosome formation that maintains cell viable. The formation of autophagosome in both Bbeta1 and Bbeta2 clones (Fig 6) demonstrated how cells survive when encountered with stress conditions. While heterotrimeric PP2A holoenzyme containing all three regulatory subunit families can affect events ranging from the initiation of DNA replication to vertebrate axis formation to apoptosis [8], the up-regulated mitochondrial PPP2R2B putatively serves to deregulate protein kinases cascades, thereby making cells autophagic as seen in some neuron disorders [21,33].

Numerous studies suggested a close relationship between dysfunctional mitochondria and autophagy. Mitochondrial perturbation is one of the sources to induce autophagic cell death [23]. The disturbance of autophagy-lysosome balance has been recognized as a major cause in numerous neurodegenerative disorders [34]. While low levels of autophagy maintains cell viabilities in both stable Bbeta1 and Bbeta2 clones, only the latter was sensitive to peroxide injury by initiating apoptosis (Fig. 5) with concomitant increase of AVO' s (Fig. 6). Inhibition of autophagy by the chemical inhibitor, 3-MA, (Fig. 7) and RNA interference-mediated knockdown of ATG7 (Fig. 8) reverted the process. Thus, oxidative stress-induced cell death in Bbeta2 cells as shown in annexin V staining and growth assays demonstrated that the progression of autophagy lead Bbeta2 cells to apoptosis.

Although autophagy is capable of keeping cells from being damaged, the work provided evidence that, in addition to being protective, the increased autophagy as a result of peroxide injury can be pathogenic resulting from apoptosis. Our work showed that the attenuated autophagy prolonged cell survival by reducing formation of the accumulated autophagosome following peroxide injury. Given the fact that oxidative stress is an origin of disturbing cell homeostasis, it is conceivable that the reduced autophagic source may be an alternative approach to ameliorate harmful effects to neuronal system [22]. Being necessary at basal level for maintaining normal axonal and synaptic structures, particularly in Purkinje neurons, excessive autophagy can be neurotoxic and inhibition by chemical regulators prevents the onset of neurodegeneration [27]. Further investigation on how excessive autophagy affects cell signaling and growth under oxidative stress will provide more targets to understand the basis of the diseases.

More evidence indicated that PP2A activity can be regulated by extracellular signals and cell cycle [35]. How altered cell signaling in organelles, particularly those in mitochondria that impinge viable neuron cells as a result of increased expression of the regulatory subunit PPP2R2B, provides an interesting topic for developing more effective preventive measures in development of neuron disorders.

The phosphatase activity was conducted by modifying the published work [36]. Briefly, cell lysates were immune-precipitated with antiserum against beta2, beta1 or pre-serum depending on the type of clones used. Following precipitation with protein (A/G)-agarose and resuspension in the assay buffer, the collected supernatants were reacted with p-nitrobenzyl phosphate substrate. The optical readings of the assay as determined by spectrophotometer for each cells were subtracted from those by precipitation with pre-serum. Data were converted into percentage by comparing with those of the control parental cells, SK-N-SH with the empty vector.
