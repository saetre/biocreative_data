A mixture of low molecular weight RNAs, in which only tRNAs were radiolabelled, was used as a hybridisation probe to select for tRNA-like sequences within a bank of human genomic DNA in lambda Charon 4A. A restriction enzyme digest of one of the selected lambda Charon 4A recombinants contained two fragments (2.4 Kb & 1.8 Kb) which hybridised tRNA and which, when subcloned into pAT153, were transcribed in Xenopus oocyte nuclei. Analysis of the subcloned 2.4 Kb fragment, which was of remarkably high transcriptional activity, revealed the presence of a single gene for tRNAGlu in the middle of the fragment. The sequence immediately preceding the gene has the potential for forming a tRNA-like structure.
