We have detected specific endonucleolytic cleavages of mouse albumin mRNA by S1 nuclease protection analysis of total RNA from fetal mouse liver using a cDNA probe spanning the middle, coding region of albumin mRNA. With the use of probe labeled at its 5' end, three prominent cleavages were detected which were confirmed and their endonucleolytic nature was established by further analysis using 3' end-labeled probe. The latter probe also revealed one more cleavage which was not detected with the 5' end-labeled probe. These cleavages mapped to positions on the mRNA which included a unique sequence motif CCAN1-3CUGN0-1UGAU. Degradation intermediates corresponding to these cleavages were consistently observed, specifically in fetal liver but not in normal or regenerating adult liver and appeared to have originated in vivo. Their levels decreased progressively from 18th day of gestation and became undetectable by 20 days after birth. No detectable changes in the levels of any of the prominent degradation products of alpha-fetoprotein (a homologue of albumin) mRNA could be observed during this period of development. Since accumulation of degradation intermediates is known to correlate with higher rate of mRNA turnover, our observations raise the possibility that the stability of albumin mRNA may be lower in fetal than in adult mouse liver.
