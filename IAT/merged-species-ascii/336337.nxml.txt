The gene encoding the mouse urea cycle enzyme, ornithine transcarbamylase has been isolated on five partially overlapping bacteriophage lambda clones. We have characterized the gene and found that it is split between ten exons distributed over approximately 70 kb of the X chromosome. The introns range in size from 88 bases to the relatively unusual size of approximately 26 kilobases, while the splice donor/splice acceptor sequences conform to the consensus established for other eukaryotic genes.
