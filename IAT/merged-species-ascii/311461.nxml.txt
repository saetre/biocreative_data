The DNA sequence corresponding to the 1.3 kb 3' untranslated region of the 6.5 kb human procollagen alpha 1(IV) mRNA was determined and compared with the mouse sequence obtained from 3' cDNA and genomic clones overlapping the reported 5' half (Oberbaumer et al., 1985, Eur. J. Biochem. 147:217). Although four AAUAAA hexanucleotides are found in the human and seven in the mouse RNAs, Northern blot hybridization showed almost exclusive utilization of the most 3' sequence, in contrast to the pattern seen when using alpha 1(I), alpha 2(I), alpha 1(III) and alpha 2(V) procollagen probes. Moreover, the ninety nucleotides 5' to the poly A tail in the major alpha 1(IV) mRNAs exhibit a much greater degree of interspecies homology than those encompassing the other three shared AAUAAA recognition signals. Further examination of this highly conserved area revealed the presence of two "consensus sequences" found in the 3' noncoding region of a number of RNA polymerase II transcribed genes (Mattaj and Zeller, 1983, Embo J. 2:1883) and, unexpectedly, some similarity with the nucleotides 5' to the poly A attachment signals in other procollagen mRNAs.
