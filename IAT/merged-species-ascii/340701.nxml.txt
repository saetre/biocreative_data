Human minisatellite probes cross-hybridize to mouse DNA and detect multiple variable loci. The resulting DNA "fingerprints" vary substantially between inbred strains but relatively little within an inbred strain. By studying the segregation of variable DNA fragments in BXD recombinant inbred strains of mice, at least 13 hypervariable loci were defined, 8 of which could be regionally assigned to mouse chromosomes. The assigned loci are autosomal, dispersed and not preferentially associated with centromeres or telomeres. One of these minisatellites is complex, with alleles 90 kb or more long and with internal restriction endonuclease cleavage sites which produce a minisatellite "haplotype" of multiple cosegregating fragments. In addition, one locus shows extreme germ-line instability and should provide a useful system for studying more directly the rates and processes of allelic variation of minisatellites.
