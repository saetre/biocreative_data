The Escherichia coli gene coding for the enzyme xanthine-guanine phosphoribosyl transferase (gpt) has been widely used as a dominant selectable marker in a variety of mammalian cells. We have determined the complete nucleotide sequence of the 1057 base pair (bp) segment of DNA containing this gene. The coding sequence for the enzyme is 456 nucleotides long and can code for a 152 amino acid (16.9 Kd) polypeptide. A comparison of the amino acid sequence of the bacterial enzyme with that of the mammalian hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyl transferase (hprt) reveals no significant homology between the two polypeptides.
