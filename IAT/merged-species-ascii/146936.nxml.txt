The human Surf-1 and Surf-2 housekeeping genes are divergently transcribed and share a bi-directional, TATA-less promoter. Housekeeping promoters typically contain complex arrays of transcription factor binding sites and several studies have suggested that many of these sites might be functionally redundant. The Surf-1/Surf-2 promoter region contains four factor binding sites; members of the ETS family of transcription factors bind to two of these sites whilst YY1 binds to a third site immediately downstream of the major Surf-1 transcription start point. Here we show that Sp1 binds to the fourth transcription factor binding site. Although YY1 and Sp1 have previously been shown to interact both in vitro and in vivo, these proteins function independently at the Surf-1/Surf-2 promoter. The binding of Sp1 alone is sufficient to bring about full promoter activity in the Surf-2 direction. In contrast, both Sp1 and ETS proteins are required to bring about full promoter activity in the Surf-1 direction. The YY1 binding site is not required for basal transcription in either direction. The YY1 binding site is, however, both necessary and sufficient to confer growth factor inducibility on transcription in the Surf-1 direction. Our data suggest that functionally redundant transcription factor binding sites might not be a general feature of housekeeping promoters.
