The results previously obtained upon studying the L1-23S RNA complex by the fingerprint technique have been reexamined in the light of new data on 23S RNA primary structure. The 23S RNA region that remains associated with the L1 ribosomal protein after RNase digestion of the synthetic complex lies between nucleotides 2067 and 2235 from the 5'-end of the molecule. This region contains a m7G near to the 5'-end and possesses a high degree of mutability in E. coli. Three different sequences were observed in E. coli MRE 600. All three sequences differ in two positions relative to the corresponding sequence in rrnB cistron from E. coli K12. Striking homology is observed between the 23S RNA region associated with protein L1 and the 5'-part of L11 operon. This observation supports the model of feedback regulation of r-proteins synthesis proposed by Yates et al. (PNAS, 77, 1837) and strongly suggests that the region of 23S RNA located between positions 2155 and 2202 is essential for the binding of protein L1.
