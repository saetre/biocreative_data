Cyclin E is the regulatory subunit of the cdc2-related protein kinase cdk2 and is a rate limiting factor for the entry into S phase. To date, cyclin E is the only cyclin for which alternative splicing has been described. We report here the isolation of a new splice variant of cyclin E, termed cyclin ET, which has an internal deletion of 45 amino acids compared with the full-length cyclin E protein. Even though cyclin ETcontains an intact cyclin box, it is unable to complement a triple cln mutant strain of Saccharomyces cerevisiae or to interfere with rescue by cyclin E, indicating that an intact cyclin box is functionally insufficient. The expression pattern of cyclin ET during cell cycle entry, progression and differentiation differs from that of cyclin E. Thus, ET expression precedes that of the other isoforms during the G0-->S progression; it shows a sharp peak in early G1 in cells released from a mitotic block and is strongly down-regulated in terminally differentiated myeloid cells. These observations point to different functions for cyclin ET and E and show for the first time that the alternative splicing of cyclin E is a regulated mechanism governed by the cell cycle and differentiation.
