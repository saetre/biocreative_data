The complete sequence of a cloned cDNA derived from the major adult alpha-globin mRNA of Xenopus laevis (the South African Clawed Toad) is presented. The sequence contains the complete coding and 3' non-coding regions of the mRNA and part of the 5' non-coding region. The amino acid sequence of the encoded alpha-globin polypeptide has been deduced and is compared to other alpha-globin polypeptides. We find that the sequence is equally diverged from a bullfrog tadpole alpha-globin polypeptide and human alpha-globin polypeptide suggesting that these three sequences may have diverged from a common ancestral sequence several hundred million years ago.
