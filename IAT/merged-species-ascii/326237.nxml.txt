We have isolated and sequenced the complete murine I-E alpha immune response gene of the H-2db haplotype. The I-E alpha d gene consists of 5300 basepairs and is organized into five or possibly six exons that correspond to different domains of the alpha chain. The amino acid sequence deduced from the I-E alpha gene shows 75% homology to its human counterpart, the HLA-DR alpha chain. The absence of I-E antigen in H-2 mice is due to lack of E alpha chain synthesis. We show here that this defect is caused by a deletion in the 5' end of the I-E alpha b gene.
