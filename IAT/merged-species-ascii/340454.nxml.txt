The complete 606 amino acid sequence of the human A-raf oncogene has been deduced from the 2453 nucleotide sequence of a human T cell cDNA. A cysteine-rich region located near the amino terminus, which is highly conserved in A-raf and c-raf, shows significant homology with protein kinase C. A 5' deleted fragment of the cDNA has been incorporated into a murine retrovirus which endows the virus with the ability to transform cells in vivo and in vitro. Functionally, human A-raf is similar to v-raf and v-mos in that transformation is independent of ras gene function.
