Presented here is an antisense-oriented method for functional gene screening, which we propose naming 'antisense display'. In principle, it consists of four steps: (i) preparation of phosphorothioate antisense repertoires that would correspond to the Kozak's consensus sequence, (ii) subgroup screening to identify active antisense molecules that could cause changes in the cellular phenotypes concerned and (iii) RT-PCR cloning of cDNA with the 5[prime] sense complement and 3[prime] anchor primers and sequence determination, followed by (iv) functional assays of candidate genes. Cell-free translation in rabbit reticulocyte lysate revealed that 10mer or longer antisense effectively halted protein synthesis. This required the presence of RNase H, and was achieved without prior heat-denaturation of the RNA templates. Then, subpools of the 10mer repertoire were administered to human microvascular endothelial cells in culture, and screened for anti-angiogenic activities. A single species having the sequence 5[prime]-GGCTCATGGT-3[prime] consistently inhibited the endothelial cell growth under hypoxia. Through RT-PCR with the corresponding sense primer, we came across three candidate cDNAs. Experiments employing longer unique antisense reproduced marked growth inhibitions in two of the three cDNAs. One encoded a mitochondrial protein and the other, which encoded a putative type-2 membrane protein containing Rab-GAP/TBC and EF-hand like domains, was a gene previously undescribed in human. The results suggest that the antisense display method is potentially useful for isolating new genes towards elucidating their functions.
