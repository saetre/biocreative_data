The gene encoding muscle tropomyosin I in Drosophila is alternatively spliced in embryonic and thoracic muscle to generate two sizes classes of RNAs. By Northern blot analysis, the embryonic RNA class shows a broad RNA band of hybridization of 1.3 kb and a more sharply defined, less abundant RNA band at 1.6 kb. The thoracic class of RNAs, on the other hand, consists of a broad hybridization band at 1.7 kb and a more sharply defined band at 1.9 kb. Each size class of RNA encodes a different tropomyosin isoform. The two classes of alternatively spliced RNAs utilize the same 3' terminal exon of the gene. The DNA sequence of this exon reveals a cluster of several polyadenylation signals (AAUAAA) or polyadenylation-like signals. We show here by S1 nuclease protection analysis that at least five and possibly seven of these polyadenylation or polyadenylation-like sequences are associated with in vivo embryonic and thoracic mRNA cleavage processing sites. Six of these S1 sites are clustered within 119 bp and a seventh is located 255 bp downstream. At least one of the polyadenylation-like signal sequences appears to be an unusual AACAAA sequence. In addition we also show that these mRNAs function in vitro to synthesize muscle tropomyosins.
