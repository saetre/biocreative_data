We have characterized four novel murine ribonuclease genes that, together with the murine eosinophil-associated ribonucleases 1 and 2, form a distinct and unusual cluster within the RNase A gene superfamily. Three of these genes (mR-3, mR-4, mR-5) include complete open reading frames, encoding ribonucleases with eight cysteines and appropriately spaced histidines (His11 and His124) and lysine (Lys35) that are characteristic of this enlarging protein family; the fourth sequence encodes a non-functional pseudogene (mR-6P). Although the amino acid sequence similarities among these murine ribonucleases varies from 60 to 94%, they form a unique cluster, as each sequence is found to be more closely related to another of this group than to either murine angiogenin or to murine pancreatic ribonuclease. Interestingly, the relationship between the six genes in this 'mR cluster' and the defined lineages of the RNase A gene family could not be determined by amino acid sequence homology, suggesting the possibility that there are one or more additional ribonuclease lineages that have yet to be defined. Although the nature of the evolutionary constraints promoting this unusual expansion and diversification remain unclear, the implications with respect to function are intriguing.
