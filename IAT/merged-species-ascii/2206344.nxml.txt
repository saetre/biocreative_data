Activating Fc gamma receptors (FcgammaRs) have been identified as having important roles in the inflammatory joint reaction in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and murine models of arthritis. However, the role of the inhibitory FcgammaRIIb in the regulation of the synovial inflammation in RA is less known. Here we have investigated synovial tissue from RA patients using a novel monoclonal antibody (GB3) specific for the FcgammaRIIb isoform. FcgammaRIIb was abundantly expressed in synovia of RA patients, in sharp contrast to the absence or weak staining of FcgammaRIIb in synovial biopsies from healthy volunteers. In addition, the expression of FcgammaRI, FcgammaRII and FcgammaRIII was analyzed in synovia obtained from early and late stages of RA. Compared with healthy synovia, which expressed FcgammaRII, FcgammaRIII but not FcgammaRI, all activating FcgammaRs were expressed and significantly up-regulated in RA, regardless of disease duration. Macrophages were one of the major cell types in the RA synovium expressing FcgammaRIIb and the activating FcgammaRs. Anti-inflammatory treatment with glucocorticoids reduced FcgammaR expression in arthritic joints, particularly that of FcgammaRI. This study demonstrates for the first time that RA patients do not fail to up-regulate FcgammaRIIb upon synovial inflammation, but suggests that the balance between expression of the inhibitory FcgammaRIIb and activating FcgammaRs may be in favour of the latter throughout the disease course. Anti-inflammatory drugs that target activating FcgammaRs may represent valuable therapeutics in this disease.

Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is an autoimmune inflammatory disease characterised by autoantibody production and immune complex (IC) formation. Common autoantibodies are rheumatoid factor (RF) and those against citrullinated peptides (CCPs) [1]. Approximately 70% of all RA patients display rheumatoid factor and/or anti-CCP antibodies, and the presence of anti-CCP antibodies can be detected in serum several years before disease debut [2]. Most autoantibodies are of the IgG isotype, which have the potential to activate Fc gamma receptors (FcgammaRs) on leukocytes, such as macrophages, neutrophils, dendritic cells and B cells. Cross-linking of FcgammaRs by IgG-ICs leads to cellular effector functions such as phagocytosis, antibody-dependent cellular toxicity and release of inflammatory cytokines.

Three different classes of FcgammaRs have been identified in humans so far; FcgammaRI (CD64), FcgammaRII (CD32) and FcgammaRIII (CD16). Furthermore, FcgammaRII and FcgammaRIII exist in two isoforms, a and b, which carry out divergent functions. FcgammaRI is a high affinity receptor that binds monomeric IgG as well as IgG-ICs, while FcgammaRII and FcgammaRIII are low affinity receptors that predominantly bind IgG-ICs. FcgammaRI, FcgammaRIIa, FcgammaRIIIa and FcgammaRIIIb are activating receptors. FcgammaRI and FcgammaRIIIa consist of an alpha-chain with three and two Ig-domains respectively, which is connected with a cytoplasmic signalling subunit, the gamma-chain. The gamma-chain is responsible for intracellular signalling via its immunoreceptor tyrosine based activation motif (ITAM). FcgammaRIIa is a single chain receptor that contains an ITAM-motif in the cytoplasmic tail. FcgammaRIIb is an inhibitory receptor that is structurally similar to FcgammaRIIa, but has an immunoreceptor tyrosine based inhibitory motif in the cytoplasmic domain. FcgammaRIIb has been shown to have an important negative regulatory function on Fc receptor activation [3].

The involvement of FcgammaRs in experimental arthritis has been thoroughly investigated, and it is now clear that activating FcgammaRs are essential for the development of disease. Thus, mice lacking the common gamma-chain or FcgammaRIII are protected from collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) as well as other experimental models of arthritis [4-8]. Consequently, FcgammaRIIb deficiency in mice leads to increased susceptibility to CIA [9,10]. These findings emphasize the importance of FcgammaRs in the pathogenesis of experimental arthritis, which may also be true for arthritis in humans. A reported gene polymorphism of FcgammaRIIIa has been correlated with RA [11-13] as this polymorphism changes the receptor affinity for different IgG-subclasses [14,15]. The FcgammaRIIIA 158 V/F allele variant has been especially associated with the risk of developing RA [16], although conflicting data exist [17]. Recently, it was also reported that there is an association between rheumatoid factor and the FcgammaRIIIa 158 V/F allele in RA patients [18] and that a functional variant of FcgammaRIIb is associated with increased joint destruction in RA but not disease susceptibility [19]. Moreover, several studies have shown that the percentage of FcgammaRIII positive monocytes is increased in peripheral blood of RA patients [20,21] and that the expression levels of FcgammaRI, FcgammaRII and FcgammaRIII on RA monocytes are increased compared to healthy individuals [22-24], while FcgammaRIIb expression is unaffected [25].

It has previously been hard to obtain knowledge about FcgammaR expression in healthy synovial tissue for comparison with FcgammaR expression in RA patients. Synovia from trauma patients or osteoarthritis patients has often been used as control material [26,27] and only limited studies have been done with healthy synovium [28]. Therefore, we have in this study investigated the expression of the different FcgammaRs using synovial tissue from healthy volunteers in comparison with RA synovia. We were particularly interested in investigating expression of the inhibitory FcgammaRIIb as this receptor has not previously been studied due to the lack of a specific antibody against it. Here, by using a novel FcgammaRIIb specific antibody, GB3, we demonstrate a pronounced FcgammaRIIb expression in the synovial inflammation in RA, which is in sharp contrast to the lack or weak staining of FcgammaRIIb in healthy synovia. Additionally, we could detect FcgammaRII and FcgammaRIII, but not FcgammaRI, in healthy synovial tissue. In the RA synovia, the expression of all activating FcgammaRs was significantly increased, regardless of disease duration. The synovial FcgammaRI expression could be reduced by intraarticular glucocorticoid treatment.

Synovial tissues from 26 RA patients, 12 men and 14 women, were obtained through the rheumatology clinic at the Karolinska Hospital, Solna, Sweden. Characteristics of the patients are presented in Table 1. Healthy synovial biopsies were obtained from ten volunteers, four men and six women, who did not display any arthritic symptoms at the time of the biopsy. An additional group of nine patients with either RA (three men and two women), oligoarthritis (two men) or polyarthritis (two women) was studied before and after treatment with an intraarticular injection of 40 mg of glucocorticoids (triamcinolone hexacetonide; Lederspan, Wyeth Lederle, Solna, Sweden) in the knee. The biopsies were taken before and 9 to 15 days after treatment. The characteristics of these patients are presented in Table 1. All patients included in the glucocorticoid study displayed a decreased synovial inflammation two weeks after treatment as synovial vascularity and hypertrophy were reduced as assessed by arthroscopic evaluation (data not shown). The ethics committee at the Karolinska hospital approved all experiments on human tissue and informed consent was obtained from all study subjects.

The synovial membrane biopsies were obtained by an arthroscopic technique as previously described [29] and were taken, when possible, from synovitis adjacent to the cartilage-pannus junction. Synovial tissue was also obtained at articular surgery in late RA cases. The synovial tissues were divided into three groups: I, healthy (n = 10); II, early RA, diagnosed for less than 18 months (n = 11); and III, late RA, diagnosed for more than 18 months (n = 15). The biopsies from glucocorticoid treated patients (n = 9) were grouped into before and after treatment.

The tissue was snapfrozen in liquid isopentane chilled with dry ice and stored at -70degreesC until sectioned. Frozen biopsies were embedded in OCT compound (TissueTek, Sakura Finetek, Zoeterwoude, The Netherlands) and sectioned into 7 mum serial sections using a cryostat onto SuperFrost Plus slides (Menzel-Glaser, Braunschweig, Germany). The slides were air dried for 30 minutes, then fixed for 20 minutes at 4degreesC with 2% (volume/volume) formaldehyde (Sigma, St Louis, MO, USA) in PBS, pH 7.4, then washed in PBS and left to air dry and stored at -70degreesC until use.

The GB3 (mouse IgG1) monoclonal antibody (mAb), specific for human FcgammaRIIb, was generated by immunization of mice with a recombinant CD32b coupled cyclic 126-SKKFSRSDPNFSG-138 peptide, including N-acetyl-glucosaminylated asparagine at position 135. The cyclic peptide represents a loop in the Fc-fragment binding region of CD32 that carries unique residues for the inhibitory b-form of the receptor and should facilitate a specific immune response against the CD32b unique glycosylation site at Asn135 of the receptor. Mice were sacrificed and splenic B-cells were fused with immortalized cells using standard protocols. The propagation of approximately 700 hybridoma clones resulted in the GB3 clone. To test the specificity of the GB3 mAb, the monocytic U937 cell line (kind gift from Prof. Lars Hellman, Uppsala University, Sweden) and the B cell lymphoma Raji cell line (kind gift from Dr Fredrik Oberg, Uppsala University, Sweden) were stained with the GB3 mAb, mouse IgG2b anti-FcgammaRIIa (clone IV.3; kind gift from Dr Johan Ronnelid, Uppsala University, Sweden), mouse IgG1 pan anti-human FcgammaRII (clone KB61, DAKO, Glostrup, Denmark) or isotype controls (mouse IgG1, DAKO and mouse IgG2b, Sigma) for 30 minutes at 4degreesC. The cells were then washed in 1% BSA in PBS and a phycoerythrin-(PE-)conjugated rabbit anti-mouse IgG secondary antibody (Biosite, Taby, Sweden) was added to the cells and incubated for 30 minutes at 4degreesC. After further washing, the cells were re-suspended in 1% BSA in PBS and analysed using a FACScan (Becton Dickinson, Mountain View, CA, USA).

To confirm the specificity of the GB3 mAb, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was used. Microtiter plates (Immunolon 2 HB, Dynex Technologies Inc., Chantilly, VA, USA) were coated with 2 mug per well of recombinant soluble (s)FcgammaRIIb or recombinant sFcgammaRIIa (both R&D systems, Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA) diluted in 0.5% BSA in PBS and incubated overnight at 4degreesC in a humid chamber. The plate was then washed with 0.05% Tween 20 (Merck, Schuchardt, Germany) in PBS. The epitope specificity of the GB3 mAb was determined by titrating the antibody five times in each step, with a starting concentration of 5 mug/ml in 0.5% BSA, and then serially added to the plate in duplicates and incubated for 2 h at room temperature (RT). The plate was washed and 50 mul of sheep anti-mouse IgG conjugated to alkaline phosphatase (Sigma) was added per well and incubated for 2 h at RT. The plate was washed and 50 mul per well of p-nitrophenyl phosphate substrate (1 mg/ml; Sigma) in ethanolamine buffer were added and the plate incubated in the dark. The absorbance value was determined at 405 nm in an ELISA reader (Molecular Devices Corporation, Sunnyvale, CA, USA).

Slides were thawed and washed in PBS with 0.1% saponin (PBS/Sap, pH 7.4) for 10 minutes. Any endogenous peroxidase was blocked using 1% H2O2 in PBS/Sap for 1 h at RT in dark. Sections were then washed repeatedly in PBS/Sap. The primary antibody, diluted in PBS/Sap, was added and left at RT over night in the dark. After several washing steps, the sections were incubated with 1% normal horse serum in PBS/Sap for 15 minutes. The serum was thereafter removed and biotinylated horse anti-mouse secondary antibody, diluted in 1% normal horse serum, was added for 30 minutes at RT. Sections were washed and avidin-biotin-complex (ABC-elite, Vectastain elite kit, Vectorlab, Burlingame, CA, USA) added for 45 minutes according to the manufacturer's instructions. Subsequently, after washing, any positive staining was developed in diaminobenzidine (DAB; DAB substrate kit, Vectorlab) for 7 minutes according to the manufacturer's instructions. Finally, the sections were counterstained with haematoxylin (Histolab, Gothenburg, Sweden), rinsed with tap water, dehydrated in alcohol and mounted with Mountex (Histolab).

A commonly used marker for macrophages is the CD68 antigen. However, this marker can also be found on fibroblasts and other leukocytes depending on the mAb clone used for detection [30,31]. So to avoid this and exclusively investigate mature monocytes/macrophages as a source of FcgammaR expression, we used a mAb against CD163. The CD163 antigen is known to be exclusively expressed by mature peripheral blood monocytes and macrophages [32,33]. The antibodies used were thus PE-conjugated anti-CD163 (clone 215927; R&D-systems), non-conjugated anti-CD163 (clone Ber-MAC3; DAKO), FITC-conjugated and non-conjugated anti-CD64 (clone 10.1; BD Pharmingen, San Diego, CA, USA), FITC-conjugated and non-conjugated anti-CD32 (clone KB61; DAKO), non-conjugated anti-CD32b (clone GB3), FITC-conjugated and non-conjugated anti-CD16 (clone DJ130c) (DAKO), non-conjugated anti-CD3 (clone SK7; Becton Dickinson), non-conjugated anti-CD19 (clone HD37; DAKO) and non-conjugated anti-CD20 (clone L27; Becton Dickinson). All antibodies were of mouse IgG1 isotype and an irrelevant mouse IgG1 (DAKO) was used as negative control. As an additional specificity control, the GB3 mAb was absorbed by incubating the GB3 mAb with recombinant human FcgammaRIIb protein at a 1:1 ratio overnight before adding it to the tissue sections.

The immunohistochemical staining was analysed in a Polyvar II light microscope (Reichert-Jung, Vienna, Austria) and evaluated by two independent observers (SEM and SK). Both observers were blinded to the tissue identity and staining. An arbitrary scale was used to identify the amount of positively stained area of the whole tissue section, where 0 = 0% positive tissue area, 1 = 1% to 20% positive tissue area, 2 = 21% to 50% positive tissue area, 3 = 51% to 80% positive tissue area and 4 = 81% to 100% positive tissue area. The staining pattern was also noted as well as presence of vessels and lymphocyte infiltrates. The immunofluorescence staining was analysed using a Leica DMRXA2 fluorescence microscope (Leica Microsystems, Cambridge, UK).

To verify the specificity of the novel GB3 mAb against FcgammaRIIb, U937 cells positive for FcgammaRIIa [34] and Raji cells positive for FcgammaRIIb [35] were stained with the GB3 mAb or the previously described IV.3 mAb specific for FcgammaRIIa [34]. The GB3 mAb showed strong positive staining of the Raji cells, whereas the U937 cells were stained negative (Figure 1a). In contrast, the IV.3 mAb clearly stained the U937 cells while the Raji cells were partly stained (Figure 1b), indicating that the IV.3 mAb is somewhat cross reactive with FcgammaRIIb, as has recently also been reported [35]. Both cell lines were clearly stained by the KB61 pan anti-FcgammaRII mAb, showing detection of both FcgammaRIIa and FcgammaRIIb expression (Figure 1c). The epitope specificity of the GB3 mAb was also determined by ELISA. The ELISA data show that the GB3 mAb binds recombinant sFcgammaRIIb protein, but not recombinant sFcgammaRIIa protein (Figure 1d). These results demonstrate that the GB3 mAb is specific for FcgammaRIIb and that it distinguishes between FcgammaRIIa and FcgammaRIIb.

The monoclonal antibody (mAb) GB3 is specific for human Fc gamma receptor (FcgammaR)IIb. (a-c) Human B cell (Raji) or monocyte (U937) cell lines were stained with either the anti-FcgammaRIIb mAb GB3, the anti-FcgammaRIIa mAb IV.3 or the pan anti-FcgammaRII mAb KB61. Filled graphs represent the specific antibody and dotted graphs the isotype control antibody. Raji cells were clearly stained positive for FcgammaRIIb by the GB3 mAb, while U937 cells were negatively stained, thus demonstrating the FcgammaRIIb specificity of the GB3 mAb (a). Raji cells were, somewhat surprisingly, stained positive by IV.3 mAb and, as expected, so were the U937 cells (b). This indicates that the IV.3 mAb detects FcgammaRIIa but is also cross-reactive to FcgammaRIIb. Both cell lines were positively stained by the pan anti-FcgammaRII mAb, detecting both the a and b isoforms (c). (d) The epitope specificity of the GB3 mAb as demonstrated by ELISA. Serially diluted GB3 mAb show binding activity to recombinant sFcgammaRIIb whereas no reactivity to recombinant sFcgammaRIIa.

Expression of the inhibitory FcgammaRIIb in healthy and RA synovial tissue was investigated using the GB3 mAb described above. In healthy synovia (n = 5), FcgammaRIIb was either not detected, or only weakly expressed in some individuals. The few biopsies that were positive for FcgammaRIIb displayed weak positive staining in the sub-lining layer and in scattered cells of the synovia (Figure 2a). The IgG1 isotype control antibody did not stain the tissue (Figure 2b). The RA synovial tissue, however, displayed quite strong FcgammaRIIb expression, which was evident in all investigated patients (n = 10; Figure 2c,e). FcgammaRIIb was found in the synovial lining layer and in the sub-lining layers of the synovium (Figure 2c). FcgammaRIIb expression was also found perivasculary to some extent and in scattered cells throughout the tissue. Some staining of FcgammaRIIb was also observed within lymphocyte infiltrates (Figure 2e). Thus, when consecutive slides were stained with an anti-CD19/CD20 mAb mix, anti-FcgammaRII and anti-FcgammaRIIb, there were overlapping staining patterns between these markers, indicating that B cells in the RA synovia express FcgammaRIIb (data not shown). No staining was observed when the GB3 mAb was bound by recombinant human sFcgammaRIIb (Figure 2d) or when staining with an IgG1-isotype control antibody (data not shown). RA synovial FcgammaRIIb expression was significantly increased compared with FcgammaRIIb expression in healthy synovia (p = 0.0104; Figure 2f). This indicates that there is a greater need for negative regulation of the activating FcgammaRs in arthritic joints than in healthy joints.

Expression of Fc gamma receptor (FcgammaR)IIb in healthy and rheumatoid arthritis (RA) synovia. (a) FcgammaRIIb was sparsely expressed in the few healthy synovial biopsies that were positively stained by GB3. The arrows indicate FcgammaRIIb positive cells in the sub-lining synovial layer and tissue. (b) The IgG1 isotype control antibody did not stain the healthy synovium. (c,e) Positive FcgammaRIIb expression was found in all the stained RA synovial biopsies. FcgammaRIIb staining was observed in the synovial lining and sub-lining layers, perivasculary and inside lymphocyte infiltrates (e). (d) No staining of the RA synovium was observed when the anti-FcgammaRIIb monoclonal antibody was bound by recombinant human soluble FcgammaRIIb prior to staining. (f) Synovial FcgammaRIIb expression was significantly up-regulated in RA patients (n = 10) compared to healthy individuals (n = 5) (mean values of two independent observers, SEM and SK with standard error of the mean, *p = 0.0104).

As no thorough analysis of the expression of the activating FcgammaRs in healthy synovia has previously been performed we set out to analyse synovial biopsies from 10 healthy volunteers to compare them with synovia from RA patients (n = 26). In addition, to investigate if FcgammaR expression differs in newly diagnosed RA compared with FcgammaR expression in late stages of RA, the RA patients were divided into early (n = 11) and late RA (n = 15) depending on how long they had been diagnosed with RA. All biopsies were stained with mAbs against FcgammaRI, FcgammaRII and FcgammaRIII. The pan KB61 anti-FcgammaRII antibody was used to analyse the combined expression of FcgammaRIIa and IIb, as no truly specific anti-FcgammaRIIa antibody is available. The previously described anti-FcgammaRIIa antibody (IV.3) is not able to clearly distinguish between FcgammaRIIa and IIb, as was demonstrated in our stainings of cell lines (Figure 1b). The staining of healthy synovia (Figure 3a) revealed a novel finding in that FcgammaRI expression could not be detected in any of the biopsies studied. Expression of FcgammaRII and III was observed, however, most often in the synovial lining layer and in the sub-lining layer. However, FcgammaRIII was not detected as often as FcgammaRII in the sub-lining layer. Both FcgammaRII and III were occasionally detected perivasculary when vessels were present. Staining of healthy synovia with IgG1 isotype control antibody did not show any background staining. In contrast, RA synovium showed high expression of all FcgammaRs (Figure 3b). FcgammaRI was observed perivasculary and in some cases also in the synovial lining and sub-lining layers; however, FcgammaRI positive cells were rarely seen within lymphocyte infiltrates. The expression pattern of FcgammaRII and III was very similar and both receptors were often found perivasculary and always in the synovial lining and sub-lining layers of the synovium. FcgammaRII and III positive cells were also observed within lymphocyte infiltrates. The IgG1 isotype control antibody was negative in most RA tissues but showed weak background staining in some of the RA patients, possibly due to FcgammaR interactions (Figure 3b). Furthermore, as for FcgammaRIIb, the percentages of FcgammaRI, II or III positive cells were significantly greater in RA synovial tissue compared to healthy synovial tissue (Figure 3c). We did not find any significant differences between the early and late RA patients with respect to synovial FcgammaR expression.

To investigate if macrophages were one of the major FcgammaR expressing cells in the RA joints, RA synovia was double stained with a PE-labelled anti-CD163 (a macrophage specific marker) mAb and an alexa green-labelled anti-FcgammaRI, FcgammaRII, FcgammaRIIb or FcgammaRIII mAb. The staining revealed that RA macrophages indeed were positive for the inhibitory and activating FcgammaRs, as demonstrated by the clear expression of FcgammaRI, FcgammaRII, FcgammaRIIb and FcgammaRIII on CD163 positive cells (Figure 4a-d). Interestingly, even though all RA synovial biopsies showed double staining for CD163 and FcgammaRIIb, some CD163 positive cells did not express FcgammaRIIb (Figure 4c). This suggests that there might be a FcgammaRIIb negative subpopulation of macrophages that are not able to regulate their FcgammaR activity in the RA synovium. Biopsies stained with PE or alexa green-conjugated control antibodies were negative (data not shown). Moreover, consecutive DAB stained slides of CD163 positive macrophages and FcgammaR positive cells showed that the amount of FcgammaRI, II and III expression was significantly correlated with CD163 expression in the RA synovia (FcgammaRI, r = 0.65, p = 0.012; FcgammaRII, r = 0.85, p = 0.0001; FcgammaRIII, r = 0.75, p = 0.002), which confirms the results of the immunofluorescence stainings. Furthermore, we observed that FcgammaR-positive cells, most likely macrophages, often co-localised with CD3-positive T cells around vessels of the synovial tissue (data not shown). Thus, a significant correlation was found between the expression of FcgammaRI, II and III and that of CD3 in RA patients, indicating the presence of FcgammaR positive macrophages near T cells in RA synovia (Figure 5).

Glucocorticoid treatment is often successfully used to suppress inflammation in arthritic joints. Therefore, we wanted to investigate whether an intraarticular injection of glucocorticoids has any effect on synovial FcgammaR expression. Synovial biopsies from the knee of RA, polyarthritic and monoarthritic patients were stained for individual FcgammaRs before and after glucocorticoid treatment. The expression of FcgammaRI was significantly reduced two weeks after the glucocorticoid injection (p = 0.027; Figure 6a). The decrease in FcgammaRI expression was clearly seen in the sub-lining and lining layers and, in particular, perivasculary (Figure 6b,c). There was also a trend to decreased FcgammaRII expression, although this did not reach significance (p = 0.074). The presence of CD163 positive macrophages was also investigated before and after glucocorticoid treatment but no difference in CD163 expression was found. No background staining was seen using an isotype control antibody on tissue from all patients, before and after treatment (data not shown).

These data demonstrate that the inflammation in RA synovium is characterised by a pronounced expression of the inhibitory FcgammaRIIb, which suggests it has a role in counteracting the effects of activating FcgammaRs in RA synovia. Specific FcgammaRIIb expression patterns in RA or healthy synovia have not previously been described; nor has the expression of activating FcgammaRs in healthy synovia been described fully. Synovium from trauma patients has been reported to express FcgammaRI, II and III, and the FcgammaRII and III expression has been shown to be significantly lower in these patients compared to RA patients, while their FcgammaRI expression does not differ from that of RA synovia [27]. This is in contrast to our findings where we could not identify any FcgammaRI expression in healthy synovium. Thus, it appears that FcgammaRI is expressed as a consequence of a general inflammation in the joint, as we also observed FcgammaRI expression in synovial tissue from osteoarthritis patients (data not shown), although not to the same extent as seen in RA patients. The fact that FcgammaRI is absent from healthy synovial tissue but present in RA synovium and significantly decreased by administration of glucocorticoids indicates that FcgammaRI has a significant inflammatory role in the pathogenesis of arthritis. This is interesting and in line with experimental studies where FcgammaRI deficiency in mice leads to a reduced uptake of IgG-ICs and to decreased IC-induced inflammation [36]. It has also been reported that up-regulation of FcgammaRI leads to increased cartilage destruction in arthritic mice [37]. Similar to FcgammaRI, FcgammaRIIb was absent from, or only weakly expressed in, healthy synovia, whereas RA synovium clearly expressed FcgammaRIIb. This indicates a need for FcgammaRIIb to control the stimulatory activity of the ITAM-containing receptors in the RA joint.

Although the majority of RA macrophages expressed FcgammaRIIb, it was also evident that some macrophages did not. This may point towards a small subpopulation of FcgammaRIIb negative macrophages that may have extraordinary inflammatory capacities. We also observed FcgammaRIIb expression in lymphocyte infiltrates of RA synovium, which further suggests that infiltrating B cells may also be regulated by this receptor. In contrast to the near absence of FcgammaRIIb expression in healthy synovia, we clearly observed positive FcgammaRII staining with the pan anti-FcgammaRII mAb, most likely as a result of the presence of the activating FcgammaRIIa in healthy synovia. FcgammaRIII is also expressed in healthy synovia, ready to bind ICs caught in the joint. In RA synovium both FcgammaRII and FcgammaRIII expression was significantly increased, as has also previously been observed [26-28]. However, no association with disease duration and the degree of FcgammaR expression in RA patients could be shown, as both early and late patient groups expressed similar amounts of FcgammaRs. This suggests that the FcgammaRs are important during the whole disease course and not only in the induction phase of RA.

The importance of FcgammaRII and FcgammaRIII in arthritis has also been emphasized in animal models of RA. Transgenic mice expressing human FcgammaRIIa [38] develop CIA much earlier than wild-type mice and normally arthritis resistant mice become susceptible to arthritis when expressing FcgammaRIIa [39]. Furthermore, the induction of CIA is dependent on FcgammaRIII and, in particular, FcgammaRIII positive macrophages [4,40]. Studies of RA monocytes/macrophages have also stressed the significance of FcgammaRII and FcgammaRIII in disease pathogenesis. Thus, FcgammaRII and FcgammaRIII are up-regulated on peripheral blood monocytes and FcgammaRIII expression is also enhanced on synovial fluid macrophages [21,22].

The importance of FcgammaRII in RA was also noted in this study by the decrease in FcgammaRII expression (albeit not significant) after glucorticoid treatment. The decrease in FcgammaRII as well as FcgammaRI expression after local glucocorticoid injection was not due to a reduced number of macrophages in the tissue, as no significant difference in CD163 expression was found after treatment. In agreement, a previous study, where the same patient material was included, also found that the amount of CD163 and CD68 positive cells were not affected by intraarticular glucocorticoid treatment [41]. This indicates that FcgammaRs are down regulated from the cell surface by glucocorticoid treatment, which may help to explain some of the improvement seen in RA patients upon treatment with it, in addition to its reported suppressive effects on cytokines [41]. These results are in line with an earlier report that indirectly showed that FcgammaR expression is decreased on peripheral blood monocytes from autoimmune hemolytic anemia patients after systemic administration of corticosteroid, measured by radiolabelled IgG-binding [42]. In a more recent paper, FcgammaRI and II were shown to be decreased on peripheral blood monocytes one month after systemic therapy with daily low glucocorticoid doses [22]. Recent studies with other anti-rheumatic drugs have demonstrated that methotrexate treatment could reduce the expression of FcgammaRI and IIa on peripheral blood monocytes from RA patients, while the expression of FcgammaRIII was unaffected [43]. We did not see a clear reduction in FcgammaRIII expression after glucocorticoid treatment, which might indicate that FcgammaRIII expression is hard to modify using anti-rheumatic drugs. It is difficult to speculate on how relevant the reduction of FcgammaRs is for the physiological outcome of glucocorticoid treatment, since patients receiving an intraarticular injection of glucocorticoids experience an almost instant effect, but positive anti-inflammatory effects in the joint are seen several weeks after treatment.

Macrophages are present in the synovial lining layer of healthy synovium and the amount of macrophages in joints of RA patients is correlated with disease activity [44-46]. We identified the presence of FcgammaRI, II, IIb and III on RA synovial macrophages and, in addition, expression of FcgammaRI, FcgammaRII and FcgammaRIII revealed by DAB staining was significantly correlated with the expression of the macrophage marker CD163. This indicates that macrophages are likely to be involved in the IC-mediated damage in RA via their FcgammaR expression and they may also be responsible for antigen presentation to T cells, as macrophages were observed in close proximity to CD3 positive T cells in the RA synovium. The FcgammaR-positive macrophages were often localised perivasculary together with CD3-positive T cells, most likely as a result of recent extravasation. It is possible that presentation of antigen taken up via FcgammaRs on the macrophages may activate T cells to secrete cytokines. This could, in turn, lead to further activation of the macrophages and, thus, production of inflammatory cytokines, resulting in a continuous inflammatory state in RA joints.

Our findings demonstrate that expression of the inhibitory FcgammaRIIb, as well as of the activating FcgammaRI, FcgammaRII and FcgammaRIII, is increased in RA synovium, regardless of disease duration. The importance of FcgammaRI and FcgammaRIIb in the synovial inflammation of RA patients is further highlighted by the fact that healthy synovia lack FcgammaRI expression and substantially lack FcgammaRIIb expression. Furthermore, anti-inflammatory drugs, such as glucocorticoids, suppress FcgammaRI expression after local administration in the joint. These results clearly point towards a central role for the FcgammaRs in the synovial inflammation of RA.
