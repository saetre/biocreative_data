We have determined the sequence of a 1498 base-pair region in E. coli that extends from within dnaN through recF and into the gyrB gene. An open reading frame of 1071 base pairs has been identified with the recF structural gene. By S1 mapping, we have located a transcription start point 31 base pairs upstream of gyrB. The amount of this transcript is much greater in cells that have been treated with novobiocin, a treatment which is known to induce greater synthesis of DNA gyrase.
