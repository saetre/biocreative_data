Eukaryotic cells arrest at the G2checkpoint in the presence of DNA damage or incompletely replicated DNA. This cell cycle checkpoint prevents the development and propagation of genomic instability. In the fission yeast, this process requires the action of a number of genes, including rad1(+) . We report here the identification of human and mouse cDNAs that exhibit extensive sequence homology to rad1(+) . The human gene, called HRAD1 , encodes a 282 amino acid protein that is 27% identical and 53% similar to yeast Rad1p. The human homologue maintains its sequence similarity over the full length of the protein, including the three proposed 3'-->5' exonuclease domains, and the leucine rich repeat region. The mouse gene, called MRAD1 , encodes a 280 amino acid protein that is 90% identical and 96% similar to HRAD1 at the amino acid level. Expression of HRAD1 in yeast rad1 mutants partially restores radiation resistance and G2checkpoint proficiency to these mutants. Evolutionaryconservation of structure between HRAD1 , MRAD1 , rad1(+), Saccharomyces cerevisiae RAD17 and the Ustilago maydis REC1 checkpoint genes suggests that the function of the encoded proteins is conserved as well. The ability of HRAD1 to partially complement yeast rad1 mutants suggests that this gene is required for G2checkpoint control in human cells.
