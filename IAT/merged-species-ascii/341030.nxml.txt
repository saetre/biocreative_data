We have isolated cloned cDNAs corresponding to five mRNAs whose level is increased following stimulation of quiescent rat fibroblasts by either epidermal growth factor or serum. Partial sequencing followed by a computer search of data banks has shown that the cloned cDNAs correspond to mRNAs encoding proteins with extensive homology to lactate dehydrogenase, glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase, enolase, triose phosphate isomerase, and actin. The complete nucleotide sequence of a rat fibroblast lactate dehydrogenase is presented.
