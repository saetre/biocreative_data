We report the isolation and characterization of a cloned DNA of D. melanogaster, Dm4L, that is derived from the major heat shock puff site at 63B. This segment contains two closely linked genes that are each present once per Drosophila haploid genome. One of these, the hsp 83 gene, encodes an abundant heat shock mRNA that, unlike other major heat shock mRNAs, is also abundant in uninduced (23 degrees) kco cells. Although only a slight increase in the level of total hsp 83 RNA can be detected after heat shock in Kco cells, the level of hsp 83 poly(A)+ mRNA increases more than 6-fold and the level of pulse-labeled hsp 83 RNA in total cellular RNA increases 11-fold relative to uninduced cells. In contrast, the levels of total, poly(A)+, and pulse-labeled RNA homologous to the second gene, 63B-T2, are approximately the same in both induced and uninduced cells. Hence, even though these genes are separated by only one thousand base pairs, and, from in situ hybridization to polytene chromosomes, both lie within the heat shock puff, they display strikingly different regulatory properties, These results demonstrate that close linkage of a gene to a heat shock puff is not sufficient to render its expression heat inducible.
