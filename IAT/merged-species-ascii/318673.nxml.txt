Double-stranded cDNA of in vitro polyadenylated tobacco streak virus (TSV) RNA 3 has been cloned and sequenced. The complete primary structure of 2,205 nucleotides reveals two open reading frames flanked by a leader sequence of 210 bases, an intercistronic region of 123 nucleotides and a 3'-extracistronic sequence of 288 nucleotides. The 5'-terminal open reading frame codes for a Mr 31,742 protein, which probably corresponds to the only in vitro translation product of TSV RNA 3. The 3'-terminal coding region predicts a Mr 26,346 protein, probably the viral coat protein, which is the translation product of the subgenomic messenger, RNA 4. Although the coat proteins of alfalfa mosaic virus (A1MV) and TSV are functionally equivalent in activating their own and each others genomes, no homology between the primary structures of those two proteins is detectable.
