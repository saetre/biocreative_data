PPARs exhibit anti-inflammatory capacities and are potential modulators of the inflammatory response. We hypothesized that their expression and/or function may be altered in cystic fibrosis (CF), a disorder characterized by an excessive host inflammatory response.

PPARalpha, beta and gamma mRNA levels were measured in peripheral blood cells of CF patients and healthy subjects via RT-PCR. PPARalpha protein expression and subcellular localization was determined via western blot and immunofluorescence, respectively. The activity of PPARalpha was analyzed by gel shift assay.

In lymphocytes, the expression of PPARalpha mRNA, but not of PPARbeta, was reduced (-37%; p < 0.002) in CF patients compared with healthy persons and was therefore further analyzed. A similar reduction of PPARalpha was observed at protein level (-26%; p < 0.05). The transcription factor was mainly expressed in the cytosol of lymphocytes, with low expression in the nucleus. Moreover, DNA binding activity of the transcription factor was 36% less in lymphocytes of patients (p < 0.01). For PPARalpha and PPARbeta mRNA expression in monocytes and neutrophils, no significant differences were observed between CF patients and healthy persons. In all cells, PPARgamma mRNA levels were below the detection limit.

Lymphocytes are important regulators of the inflammatory response by releasing cytokines and antibodies. The diminished lymphocytic expression and activity of PPARalpha may therefore contribute to the inflammatory processes that are observed in CF.

Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a common inherited disease caused by mutations in the gene encoding the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR), which is an epithelial chloride channel. The disorder affects multiple organs and the phenotype is extremely heterogeneous. However, CF morbidity and mortality are mainly due to lung disease, which is characterized by an excessive host inflammatory response. Although CF lung disease is generally considered to be a neutrophil-mediated disorder, recent studies suggest a potent role for lymphocytes in the pathogenesis of the disease [1,2]. In addition, inflammatory markers such as cytokines and eicosanoids are elevated, not only locally, in the airways, but also systemically, thus indicating a more generalized state of inflammation in CF [3-5].

The nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) and activated protein-1 (AP-1) transcription factors are key players in the inflammatory response by inducing the expression of cytokines, chemokines, cell adhesion molecules and growth factors. The actions of NF-kappaB and AP-1 can, however, be inhibited by the Peroxisome Proliferator-Activated Receptors alpha and gamma (PPARs), which thereby exert anti-inflammatory properties [6-8]. PPARs are ligand-activated transcription factors belonging to the nuclear hormone receptor super-family. Fatty acids and eicosanoids are natural occurring PPAR ligands [9,10]; fibrates and glitazones are more specific synthetic activators for PPARalpha and gamma, respectively. PPARs regulate gene expression by heterodimerization with the retinoid x receptor (RXR) and subsequent binding to specific DNA sequence elements, termed PPAR response elements (PPRE), in the promoter regions of their target genes [11]. In addition, they can repress gene transcription in a DNA-binding independent manner through inhibition of other signaling pathways by protein-protein interactions and cofactor competition [6,7,12]. At present, three distinct PPAR isoforms have been identified, called alpha, beta and gamma. PPARalpha and gamma agonists decrease plasma concentrations of cytokines and acute phase proteins [13-15] and induce anti-atherosclerotic effects [16,17] and are therefore able to influence the immune response. They also seem to play a role in airway inflammation. Similarly, PPARalpha and gamma agonists have been reported to inhibit airway inflammation in a murine model of asthma [18] and a model of airway infection [19] by inhibiting eosinophil, lymphocyte and neutrophil influx into the lung.

Moreover, CF is associated with abnormalities in fatty acid and eicosanoid metabolism. In addition to deficiencies in essential fatty acids in plasma, increased release of arachidonic acid (AA) from the cell membrane and elevated levels of pro-inflammatory eicosanoids in urine, blood and airways have been reported [3,20-24]. Even cell membrane compositions seem to be disturbed with increased levels of AA and decreased levels of docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) [25]. Fatty acids and derivatives can regulate the actions of PPARs and an imbalance may therefore cause inappropriate activation of PPARs.

In conclusion, we hypothesized that the expression of PPARs, transcription factors with anti-inflammatory capacities, is altered in CF. To check our hypothesis, we measured PPARalpha, beta and gamma expression in peripheral blood cells, which are important mediators of the inflammatory response through the production and release of cytokines, chemokines, and/or antibodies. We noticed differences for PPARalpha levels in lymphocytes. Along the same line, an altered PPARalpha activity was observed in lymphocytes, which confirmed our hypothesis.

This study was approved by the Ethics Committee of the Frankfurt University Hospital. Patients with cystic fibrosis were between 22 and 43 years old and were all affected by lung disease. They had a stable condition and came for routine check-up. The clinical characteristics of our patients are represented in Table 1. An age-matched, gender-mixed healthy control group was established for all the experiments. Only healthy feeling volunteers, which had not been ill for the past weeks, and which were free from any detectable inflammation, infection or allergic disease were selected for sampling. Due to time, technical and sampling constraints, sample sizes vary between the different experiments.

To avoid circadian fluctuations of PPARs, blood samples were always taken in the morning. Mononuclear cells were isolated from whole blood by density gradient centrifugation using Lymphoprep (Axis-Shield). After washing with PBS, monocytes were separated from lymphocytes by magnetic sorting (Miltenyi Biotec, Bergisch Gladbach, Germany). Cells were incubated with saturating concentrations of anti-CD14+ monoclonal antibodies conjugated with super paramagnetic particles for 20 min. by 4degreesC. Subsequently, cells were resolved in PBS (containing 5 mM EDTA and 0.5% BSA) and added on top of a separation column. Unlabeled cells, i.e. lymphocytes, were collected through elution from the column. In order to isolate the monocytes, the separation column was detached from the strong magnet and monocytes were eluted. Purity was checked with May-Grunwald Giemsa staining and was >/= 97%.

The cDNA derived from monocytes and lymphocytes was amplified in the presence of a range of known concentrations of internal standards (competitors). Internal standards for the PPARs and GAPDH were constructed as wild-type fragments containing a deletion of nucleotides: PPARalpha, beta and gamma cDNA with a 44, 41 and 106 bp deletion, respectively and GAPDH cDNA with a 55 bp deletion. The shortened fragments were obtained via PCR and the use of following antisense primers: 5'-ATC ACA GAA GAC AGC ATG GCC GTT CAG GTC CAA GTT TGC G-3' for PPARalpha, 5'-CTG CCA CAA TGT CTC GAT GTA GGA TGC TGC GGG CCT TCT T-3' for PPARbeta and 5'-TCA GCG GGA AGG ACT TTA TGC ACT GGA GAT CTC CGC CAA C-3' for PPARgamma. The sense primers were the same as those used for the multiplex PCR (see next paragraph). The fragments were ligated in T-vectors (Promega) and the copy number was calculated after spectrophotometric quantification. Then, dilution series (1:3) of the internal standards were established. The internal standards share identical primer recognition sites with the wild-type target.

Neutrophils exhibit low levels of mRNA in general. The classic competitive PCR was not sensitive enough and we had to establish real-time PCR. Real-time PCR was performed by using the ABI prism 7700 sequence detector (Perkin Elmer/Applied Biosystems). Primers and probes were designed using the software program Primer Express (Perkin Elmer/Applied Biosystems). For the measurement of beta-actin, a published primers/probe set was applied [27]. The fluorogenic probes contained a reporter dye (FAM) covalently attached at the 5'end and a quencher dye (TAMRA) covalently attached at the 3'end.

Specific external controls were constructed for all target genes by cloning a partial cDNA fragment (the amplicon of interest obtained by classic PCR amplification) into a pCR(R)2.1 vector (Invitrogen). A standard curve was generated: in each PCR run, 10-fold serial dilutions of the corresponding plasmid clone were included, with known amounts of input copy number. In order to normalize for inefficiencies in cDNA synthesis and RNA input amounts, the mRNA expression of the housekeeping gene beta-actin was quantified for each sample. cDNA samples were diluted 10 times prior to PCR amplification. PCR amplifications were performed in a total volume of 25 mul, containing 5 mul cDNA sample, 12.5 mul Taqman Universal PCR Master Mix (Perkin Elmer/Applied Biosystems), 200-800 nM of each primer and 200 nM detection probe (Eurogentec). Each PCR amplification was performed in triplicate, using the following conditions: 2 min. at 50degreesC and 10 min. at 95degreesC, followed by a total of 45 two-temperature cycles: 15 s at 94degreesC and 1 min. at 60degreesC for PPARs and 67degreesC for beta-actin.

IL-8 in plasma was measured via ELISA to demonstrate that the patients in this study exhibit the typical elevated systemic cytokine levels [30]. As expected, IL-8 levels were significantly higher in CF patients compared with control persons (7.3 pg/ml vs 2.9 pg/ml, respectively; p < 0.03) (Fig. 1). We can therefore assume that the inflammation cascade is not restricted to the airways, but is also found systemically.

In order to check for differences in the expression of PPARs between CF patients and healthy persons, we started screening at mRNA level. All data were normalized to the expression levels of the housekeeping genes GAPDH or beta-actin, which were equally expressed in samples of CF patients and control persons.

Neutrophils are considered end-cells as DNA and most, but not all, mRNA and protein synthesis, cease once the myeloid cells are mature enough to enter the blood.

mRNA analysis revealed less expression of PPARalpha in lymphocytes of CF patients compared with healthy persons. On the basis of this finding we further examined the expression of the receptor at protein level via western blotting. A single band for PPARalpha was observed around 60 kDA (Fig. 6A). Analysis of the band intensities demonstrated that protein levels of PPARalpha are significantly lower (-26%, p < 0.05) in lymphocytes of CF patients compared with control subjects (Fig. 6B). beta-actin was measured for normalization.

In order to identify the subcellular localization of PPARalpha within peripheral blood lymphocytes, an immunofluorescence assay was developed. As shown in Fig. 7A and 7B, the highest concentration of the protein is observed in the cytosol, whereas the nucleus contains only trace amounts of the transcription factor. In the context of our study, the technique was not found appropriate for quantifying PPARalpha protein levels by means of measuring the fluorescence intensity. Activity was therefore measured via gel shift assay.

Since PPARalpha expression is lower in lymphocytes of CF persons, it was deemed useful to check for the activity of the transcription factor, which was determined via gel shift assay (Fig. 8). To this end, a commercially available kit for PPARalpha was used (Panomics). The DNA-binding element (PPRE) was not radioactive-, but biotin-labeled. Equal amounts of nuclear extracts were loaded. The measurement of band intensities showed that PPARalpha DNA binding activity was 36% less in lymphocytes of CF patients, compared with control subjects (p < 0.01) (Fig. 8B). In order to evaluate the binding specificity, competition analysis was performed by adding 60-fold cold specific (PPRE) and unspecific oligonucleotide (see fig. 8A: lane 2 and 3, respectively). The upper band fainted strongly by adding cold PPRE, but remained unaltered after adding cold unspecific oligonucleotide. Equal loading of nuclear extracts was verified via Coomassie Blue staining of the membrane.

Soluble IL-2 receptor (sIL-2R), a well-known marker for T-lymphocyte activation, was measured in plasma of stable CF patients and control persons via ELISA (Fig. 9). Normal values for sIL-2R levels in plasma are around 1020 pg/ml. Statistical analysis revealed that CF patients exhibit significantly higher levels of sIL-2R in plasma than healthy persons (CF: 1521 +/- 84.15 pg/ml vs C: 970 +/- 56.44 pg/ml). These data indicate that peripheral T-lymphocytes of CF patients are more activated than lymphocytes of healthy subjects.

The mechanisms behind the disturbed immune response in CF are still largely unknown and require further research. The aim of our study was to measure the expression of the PPAR transcription factors in patients with cystic fibrosis and healthy subjects. Because of their known regulatory functions in inflammatory processes, we hypothesized that their expression and/or function may be altered in cystic fibrosis, a disorder characterized by an excessive host inflammatory response.

Our study confirmed that systemic inflammation was present in our CF patients on the basis of the observed increased levels of plasma IL-8. Our data revealed that both PPARalpha mRNA and protein levels were significantly lower in peripheral lymphocytes of CF patients than in healthy control persons. Immunofluorescence experiments demonstrated that just a small fraction of PPARalpha resides in the nucleus, whereas the cytosol contains the larger part of the transcription factor. This was observed for both groups. Differences in activity were demonstrated via gel shift assay, i.e. a significant reduction of PPARalpha DNA binding activity in lymphocytes of CF persons compared with healthy subjects. Finally, increased levels of soluble IL-2 Receptor in plasma suggest that peripheral lymphocytes are activated in cystic fibrosis.

Most CF patients become chronically infected with specific bacterial pathogens, such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa, which cause a destructive inflammatory response in the lung. However, several studies provide evidence that inflammation can occur prior to infection and that CF lungs are primed for inflammation [30-32]. Nevertheless, the inflammatory processes are not restricted to the respiratory tract as shown by the elevated levels of pro-inflammatory markers in the blood circuit of CF patients [4,30,33]. Our study also demonstrated elevated levels of IL-8 in plasma of CF patients. Therefore, monocytes, lymphocytes and neutrophils were studied, as they are important mediators of the inflammatory response, i.a. through the release of cytokines, chemokines, and through the production of antibodies.

Our study revealed that PPARalpha and PPARbeta are abundantly expressed in freshly isolated monocytes and lymphocytes at mRNA level, whereas little or no PPARgamma was detected. Both PPARalpha and PPARbeta mRNA could be measured via real-time PCR in neutrophils; PPARgamma mRNA on the other hand was not quantifiable. Statistical analysis showed that PPARalpha mRNA, but not PPARbeta mRNA, is significantly less expressed (-37%) in lymphocytes of CF patients compared with control persons. The same difference could be detected at protein level via western blotting. The expression of PPARalpha and beta mRNA in monocytes and neutrophils was not significantly different in patients and healthy persons. These data are supported by several studies. First, there is evidence that PPARalpha mRNA and protein expression are directly regulated by its own ligands [34,35]. Fatty acids and eicosanoids, which are natural PPAR activators, are found in disturbed levels in CF and may therefore cause a diminished expression of PPARalpha. Second, PPARalpha expression within T-lymphocytes is rapidly down-regulated following cellular activation [36]. Our present study demonstrated increased plasma soluble interleukin-2 receptor (sIL-2 R) concentrations in CF patients, which is in line with the findings of other research groups [37,38]. sIL-2 R is a generally accepted marker for T-lymphocyte activation [39]. Therefore, T-lymphocytes appear to be in some sort of activated state in CF patients, which may be responsible for the decreased PPARalpha levels. The mechanism responsible for this down-regulation has not yet been elucidated. Third, the pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-6, TNF-alpha and IL-1 have been demonstrated to cause a reduction in the expression of PPARalpha [40,41]. CF patients exhibit increased levels of IL-2, TNF-alpha, IL-6 and IL-8 in sputum and serum [4,5,32,37]. However, this can not be the major explanation for the decreased PPARalpha levels in lymphocytes, as the expression of the transcription factor was unaltered in monocytes and neutrophils. And finally, an interesting abstract by Andersson and team reported that a CF tracheal epithelial cell line expressed less PPARalpha protein than a normal tracheal epithelial cell line, which is comparable with our data [42]. The same research team found decreased PPARgamma levels in tissues specifically regulated by CFTR in a CF mice model [43] and their data suggest that CFTR may play a role in PPAR expression. A functional CFTR is also expressed in lymphocytes of healthy humans. Consequently, a defect CFTR in CF lymphocytes could result in altered PPAR expression. In addition, research has shown that PPAR expression may differ significantly in target organs where inflammation occurs. For example, a recent study reported that induction of PPARalpha is lacking in the liver of CF mice compared to wild type animals following colitis induced bile duct injury [44].

Following our findings that PPARalpha expression is down-regulated in CF lymphocytes, the question arose whether the activity of the transcription factor was also altered. Our immunofluorescence experiments revealed that for both groups, the transcription factor is primarily located in the cytosolic compartment and only a small fraction resides in the nucleus. A similar cellular distribution was reported in human macrophages [45] and in mice lymphocytes [36]. This meant that gel shift analysis had to be applied to measure possible differences in the activity of PPARalpha. The gel shifts indeed showed that PPARalpha DNA binding activity was 36% lower in lymphocytes of CF patients compared with control persons. A decreased DNA binding activity of PPARgamma was also seen in tissues of CFTR knock-out mice. Treatment of these mice with rosiglitazone, a PPARgamma agonist, restored DNA binding [43].

PPARalpha was the first isotype recognized for its in vivo role in inflammatory processes. Inflammation induced by leukotriene B4, a PPARalpha ligand, has been reported to be prolonged in PPARalpha knock-out mice, suggesting an anti-inflammatory role for PPARalpha [46]. Ligand-induced activation of PPARalpha in lymphocytes antagonized DNA binding activity of NF-kappaB and decreased IL-2 and TNF-alpha production [36,47], inhibited IFN-gamma secretion but promoted IL-4 secretion and production [47,48]. These data indicate that PPARalpha may have a significant influence on the lymphocytic immune response. Consequently, a decrease in PPARalpha expression and function may contribute to the excessive host inflammatory response. Our data suggest that administration of ligands, such as the natural DHA or synthetic fibrates, may serve as a therapy to help reduce the inflammatory processes in CF by upregulating the activity of PPARalpha (see fig. 10). Further studies need to be carried out to test this hypothesis.

Summarizing picture: PPARalpha in lymphocytes. PPARalpha inhibits the actions of the pro-inflammatory transcription factors AP-1 and NFkappaB through protein-protein interactions and by up-regulating the expression of IkappaB. The nuclear hormone receptor is inhibited by specific cytokines and by lymphocyte activation. In addition, we suggest that the imbalance of natural ligands in CF leads to deficiencies in PPARalpha activation. Therefore, lymphocytes may be turned into cells that promote inflammation in CF. We hypothesize that the addition of synthetic or natural ligands, such as fibrates and DHA respectively, may restore the activity and expression of PPARalpha, resulting in a more balanced lymphocytic immune response.

CF lung disease is well-known as a neutrophil-mediated disease. However, as pointed out by Moss, the behavior and biological function of lymphocytes is also altered in CF. Lymphocytes are important immune cells because they determine the specificity of the immune response. Quantitative analysis of inflammatory cells in CF lung tissues revealed a lymphocyte-dominated immune response in the CF bronchial wall, beneath the surface epithelium [1]. These lymphocytes may release cytokines, such as IL-17, that may attract neutrophils into the airways [49,50]. CF peripheral lymphocytes also exhibit an altered pattern in cytokine-release and production after stimulation [51-53], which could indicate an impairment of the immune response at the systemic level. Moreover, CF lymphocytes are characterized by a specific incapacity to respond to P. aeruginosa antigens [54]. Consequently, this defect could contribute to the inability to eradicate lung infection and inflammation due to P. aeruginosa. Summarized, the function of lymphocytes is altered in CF and they are therefore an interesting target to be studied.

In conclusion, our study revealed that both the expression and activity of PPARalpha, a transcription factor with anti-inflammatory capacities, is down-regulated in peripheral lymphocytes of CF patients, which may render lymphocytes into cells that promote the inflammatory response and consequently lead to increased inflammation. In addition, the natural activators of PPARalpha are known to be present in disturbed proportions in CF and may therefore cause an improper activation of PPARalpha. We therefore hypothesize that the expression and activity of PPARalpha may be up-regulated via the administration of natural or synthetic agonists which eventually may lead to a diminished immune response.
