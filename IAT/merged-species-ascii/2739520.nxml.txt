Gastric cancer is the fourth most common malignancy and the second cause of death [1]. Many studies indicated that gastric carcinoma is a polygenic disease with multistep processes for the abnormal development of many related genes [2]. However, the regulatory mechanism involved in the development of canceration is still not well understood.

Recently, researchers have found a new class of short, endogenously non-coding RNAs called microRNAs(miRNAs) in animals and plants [3-5]. They regulate the expression of protein-coding genes via degrading or inhibiting the translation of the targeted mRNAs[6]. Accumulated evidences demonstrated miRNAs play important role in carcinogenesis. Xiao indicated miRNA-106a (miR-106a) had oncogenic activity in humans. The level of miR-106a in cancer tissues was significantly higher than that in non-tumor tissues expression [7]. Another paper showed that restoration of tumor suppressor miR-34 inhibits human p53-mutant gastric cancer tumorspheres [8]. Together, these observations suggest the possible existence of cancer-specific miRNAs. For this reason, miRNAs expression profiling has been investigated in different kinds of cancer to identify cancer-specific miRNAs [9-13]. In the present study, we detected the expression profiling of 328 miRNAs in 2 cell lines, 24 gastric cancer samples and 3 normal gastric tissue samples, revealing the miRNA characteristics of gastric cancer. Furthermore, our data suggested significantly down-regulated miR-433 and miR-9, which were considered as the modulator of GRB2 and RAB34 respectively. GRB2 and RAB34 were involved in the molecular pathogenesis of gastric cancer.

Predicted targets of miRNA were determined by the algorithms: TargetScan, PicTar, and miRanda. In this way, we found that RAB34 and GRB2 were the predicted targets of miR-9 and miR-433 respectively. The 3'-UTR target sites of the human RAB34 and GRB2 were synthesized and cloned in the downstream of the luciferase gene of pGL3-control. The plasmids including junction fragments of norientation were screened by PCR. Amplification primers of Plasmid containing miR-9 target (about 430 bp products): forward (5'-TGGACGAAGTACCGAAAGGT-3') and reverse (5'-GGCACAGTGAGAGGCTGGAATCATTAAGCATCCTCAAAC); The Amplification primers of Plasmid containing miR-433 target (about 580 bp products): forward (5'-TGGGAGTCTCCCTCCGACTCCAGATATGAA-3') and reverse (5'-CACTGCATTCTAGTTGTGGT-3'). Both plasmids were identified by XbaI digestion and electrophoresis. The sequenced plasmids were named pGL3-miR-9 and pGL3-miR-433 and used for SGC7901 cell transfection.

We were further interested in miRNA-regulated gene targets, which enabled us to understand miRNA functions. To explain the potential roles of miR-9 and miR-433 in carcinogenesis, we predicted the targets of miR-9 and miR-433 via the algorithms: TargetScan, PicTar, and miRanda. To confirm whether the predicted targets of miR-9 and miR-433 were responsible for their regulation, the presumed target sites were cloned and inserted at the downstream of the luciferase gene of pGL3. Direction of junction fragments was identified and plasmids including junction fragments of norientation were chose. In Figure (2A), we found a 430 bp fragment, and in Figure (3A), we found a 580 bp fragment. The results were consistent to the amplification of pGL3-control and junction fragments sequences, which demonstrated that the fragments were norientation. XbaI was used to digest the junction fragments, then, we did electrophoresis. In Figure (2B) and Figure (3B), 360 bp fragments were objective fragments. The fragment was sequenced and inserted into plasmids.

Recent researches indicated some miRNAs were down-regulated in human malignancies. Meanwhile, these miRNAs could be used to classify histotypes of tumors, distinguish cancer tissue from normal tissue [14-17]. In present study, the expression of 328 miRNAs in 3 normal gastric tissues, 24 malignant tissues, SGC7901 and GES-1 were detected to screen specific miRNAs markers for gastric carcinoma. 26 miRNAs were found expression abnormally in gastric carcinoma samples. 19 miRNAs was down-regulated and 7 miRNAs were up-regulated. The number of the down-regulated miRNAs in carcinoma samples was more than that of the up-regulated ones in the past studies on tumor related miRNAs [9,14], which was consistent to our former results. The absence of mechanism of miRNAs maturation might explain the general down-regulation of miRNAs in tumors [18]. However, miRNAs maturation was activated in some studies [19], which was the reason for the unclear role of miRNAs maturation procession in tumorigeness.

Although different types of tumors may have the same miRNAs markers, there are specific miRNAs in tumors from different cellular origins [20]. In this study, majority of the differentially expressive miRNAs have not been reported in other tumors, especially miR-433 and miR-9. Both of them were down-regulated significantly in gastric carcinoma tissue and SGC7901 cell line, suggesting they might be the special markers for gastric carcinoma.

The differential expressions of miRNAs suggest miRNAs may be involved in the genesis and development of tumor. Up to now, the relation between down-regulated miRNAs and tumorigenesis was not well understood. Although bioinformatics could be used to predict the targets of miRNAs, these targets still need to be confirmed by experiment. Studies have confirmed that miRNAs could regulate the expressions of oncogenes. For example, miRNAs of let-7 family could regulate 3 members of RAS oncogene family [21] and miR-15a/miR-16-1 could regulate BCL2 [22], which supported the down-regulated miRNAs were involved in tumors nosogenesis. MiR-9 and miR-433 were found down-regulated significantly in gastric carcinoma samples, suggesting they might play important roles in the cancerigenic process. Meanwhile, we confirmed that RAB34, GRB2 were down regulated by miR-9 and miR-433 respectively, which revealed the potential mechanism for gastric carcinoma genesis. RAB34 is a member of RAS oncogene family. It is a guanosine triphosphatase (GTPases) which can regulate budding, junction and fusion of vesicle in exocytosis and endocytosis pathway [23]. GRB2, an adaptor protein, is a growth factor binding protein. GRB2 binds to the phosphorated tyrosine residue of the receptor via SH2 domain after receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) is activated. Meanwhile, GRB2 binds to proline enrichment region of Sos protein via its SH3 domain and formed receptor-GRB2-Sos signal transduction complex. Sos stimulates proximal Ras to release GDP and bind to GTP, which leads to the activation. Once activated, Ras activates various signal transduction proteins in different signal pathways of the downstream. Mitogen-activate-protein kinases (MAPKs) system is an important pathway among them. MAPK plays an important role in cell growth, proliferation, differentiation. Meanwhile, it is involved in cellular stress reaction. In this study, we found the expressive levels of miR-433 and miR-9 was significantly down-regulated in gastric cancer tissues and SGC7901. MiRNAs also can silence gene. The down-regulation of miR-433 and miR-9 attenuated the gene silencing, which activated GRB2 and RAB34.

In summary, we found miRNAs expressions profiling in human gastric carcinoma, and focused on the screen and identification of targets of the abnormally expressive miRNAs. Our results showed miR-433 and miR-9 was significantly down-regulated and might be used as a marker for the advanced gastric carcinoma. In addition, we also found miR-433 and miR-9 targeted GRB2 and RAB34, which was favorable for explaining carcinogenesis pathway mediated by miRNAs and screening the therapeutic targets. Some researchers have found that successive short RNAs injection could affect liver effectively in vivo [24,25], which established a good model for the development of miRNA-based approach of gene therapy. Our results show the differentially expressive miRNAs in gastric carcinoma, which will provide related data for molecular targeted therapy based on miRNAs.
