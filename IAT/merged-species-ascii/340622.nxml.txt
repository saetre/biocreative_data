In this report we present the complete nucleotide sequence of the ilvGMEDA operon of Escherichia coli. This operon contains five genes encoding four of the five enzymes required for the biosynthesis of isoleucine and valine. We identify and describe the coding regions for these five structural genes and the structural and functional features of the flanking and internal regulatory regions of this operon. This new information contributes to a more complete understanding of the overall control of the biosynthesis of isoleucine and valine.
