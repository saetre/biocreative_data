A restriction fragment has been isolated and its nucleotide sequence determined. This fragment contains sites for RNA polymerase binding, initiation and termination of transcription of the Escherichia coli histidine operon. In vitro transcription of plasmids containing this region generates one single histidine-specific, attenuated, small RNA: the leader RNA. This RNA is more efficiently transcribed when the template DNA is supercoiled. Another promoter was identified on the same fragment of deoxyribonucleic acid by in vitro transcription, DNA sequencing and RNA polymerase binding. Both promoters, transcribing in opposite direction, are very A-T rich and are separated by a G-C rich region containing a palyndromic structure.
