Saccharomyces cerevisiae RNA triphosphatase (Cet1p) and RNA guanylyltransferase (Ceg1p) interact in vivo and in vitro to form a bifunctional mRNA capping enzyme complex. Cet1p binding to Ceg1p stimulates the guanylyltransferase activity of Ceg1p. Here we localize the guanylyltransferase-binding and guanylyltransferase-stimulation functions of Cet1p to a 21-amino acid segment from residues 239 to 259. The guanylyltransferase-binding domain is located on the protein surface, as gauged by protease sensitivity, and is conserved in the Candida albicans RNA triphosphatase CaCet1p. Alanine-cluster mutations of a WAQKW motif within this segment abolish guanylyltransferase-binding in vitro and Cet1p function in vivo, but do not affect the triphosphatase activity of Cet1p. Proteolytic footprinting experiments provide physical evidence that Cet1p interacts with the C-terminal domain of Ceg1p. Trypsin-sensitive sites of Ceg1p that are shielded from proteolysis when Ceg1p is bound to Cet1p are located between nucleotidyl transferase motifs V and VI.
