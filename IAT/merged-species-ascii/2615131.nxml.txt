Background

###begin p 3
Atherosclerosis is a complex pathological condition caused by a number of mechanisms including the accelerated proliferation of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs). Diabetes is likely to be an important risk factor for atherosclerosis, as hyperglycemia induces vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) proliferation and migration and may thus contribute to the formation of atherosclerotic lesions. This study was performed to investigate whether PGC-1alpha, a PPARgamma coactivator and metabolic master regulator, plays a role in regulating VSMC proliferation and migration induced by high glucose.

PGC-1alpha mRNA levels are decreased in blood vessel media of STZ-treated diabetic rats. In cultured rat VSMCs, high glucose dose-dependently inhibits PGC-1alpha mRNA expression. Overexpression of PGC-1alpha either by infection with adenovirus, or by stimulation with palmitic acid, significantly reduces high glucose-induced VSMC proliferation and migration. In contrast, suppression of PGC-1alpha by siRNA mimics the effects of glucose on VSMCs. Finally, mechanistic studies suggest that PGC-1alpha-mediated inhibition of VSMC proliferation and migration is regulated through preventing ERK1/2 phosphorylation.

Atherosclerosis and microvascular diseases are the major vascular complications of diabetes, and constitute the principal causes of morbidity and mortality among diabetics [1], [2]. While many factors potentially contribute to the development of diabetic atherosclerosis including abnormalities in plasma lipoproteins and blood pressure, hyperglycemia is generally believed to be a major causative factor [3]. Chronic hyperglycemia-induced atherosclerosis involves a complex series of events, including abnormal vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) proliferation and migration, which contribute importantly to the formation of organized atherosclerotic plaque. High glucose activates the expression of several genes involved in extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)-dependent mitogenic response, contributing to VSMC proliferation and migration and, as a result, to the development of atherosclerosis [4]-[6].

Recent studies demonstrated that TZDs, the PPARgamma ligands, decreased cardiovascular risks via exerting direct effects on vascular cells, for example, inhibition of VSMC proliferation and migration [7], [8]. It has been shown that TZDs inhibit key steps in the ERK/MAPK pathway, blocking events that are critical for the re-entry of quiescent VSMCs into cell cycle, thus retarding serum-induced growth of cultured arterial VSMCs and PDGF-BB-directed migration of VSMCs [9]-[12]. Direct vascular effects of TZDs result from their activity as ligands for the nuclear receptor, PPARgamma [7].

PGC-1alpha is a transcriptional coactivator of PPARgamma and regulates expression of many genes coding for mitochondrial proteins [13]-[15]. PGC-1alpha plays important roles in many physiological processes, including adipocyte cell differentiation [13], the regulation of adaptive thermogenesis in brown fat and muscle [13], [16], control of hepatic gluconeogenesis [17], fuel selection in skeletal muscle cells [18], and suppression of reactive oxygen species and neurodegeneration [19]. Previous data indicate that PGC-1alpha expression changes in tissues depending on glucose levels, as seen in diabetic subjects [17], [20]-[23], thus mediating effects of hyperglycemia and promoting pathological conditions. For example, PGC-1alpha is upregulated in liver of rodents in models of both type 1 and type 2 diabetes, and increased PGC-1alpha expression contributes to elevated hepatic glucose output and the development of hyperglycemia [17]. Here, we sought to establish whether hyperglycemia regulates PGC-1alpha levels in VSMCs and whether such changes are causally related to hyperglycemia-induced VSMC proliferation and migration. Our results suggest that PGC-1alpha is a glucose-responsive, negative regulator of VSMC proliferation and migration.

High glucose has been reported to increase rat VSMC growth and movement [3], [6]. To confirm the previous report, cultured rat VSMCs were incubated with various concentrations of glucose. Following 48 h incubation, glucose dose-dependently induced VSMC proliferation (Fig. 1A) and migration (Fig. 1B). 11 mmol/L glucose induce VSMC proliferation by 1.2-fold and VSMC migration by 3-fold, respectively. At 15 mmol/L glucose numbers of VSMC were nearly 1.5-fold higher than that of control group, while migration distance was increased by 4-fold compared to the control group. 25 mmol/L glucose further stimulated cell growth by 1.6-fold and cell migration by 6-fold.

The glucose-induced VSMC proliferation and migration was found to be associated with the inhibition of the expression of PGC-1alpha. As shown in Fig. 1C, 11 mmol/L glucose inhibited PGC-1alpha mRNA expression in rat VSMCs to 52+/-24% relative to the 5.5 mmol/L control, at 15 mmol/L glucose PGC-1alpha mRNA expression was 31+/-2% of control, and 25 mmol/L glucose (the highest glucose condition) reduced the PGC-1alpha mRNA expression to 20+/-7% of control.

To further study the role of PGC-1alpha in VSMC proliferation and migration, VSMCs were infected with adenovirus driving the overexpression of PGC-1alpha. After 24 h PGC-1alpha mRNA and protein level was markedly elevated. As shown in Fig. 2A and 2B, after infection with Ad-PGC-1alpha, the PGC-1alpha mRNA level in VSMCs was approximately 60-fold higher than negative control group (Ad-GFP) (Fig. 2A), and PGC-1alpha protein level also increased significantly (Fig. 2B). Subsequently added high glucose did not affect this elevation (data not shown).

15 mmol/L glucose was used to stimulate VSMC growth and movement, the number of Ad-GFP infected cells, cultured in 15 mmol/L glucose were nearly 1.5-fold higher than cells cultured at 5.5 mmol/L glucose (1.41+/-0.07x106 cell/dish versus 0.98+/-0.03x106, P<0.001, n = 6, Fig. 2C). High glucose also significantly stimulated cell migration in Ad-GFP infected group, as determined by wound healing assay (37.33+/-8 versus 114.67+/-25.33 microm, P<0.001, n = 6, Fig. 2D) and transwell chamber assay (6+/-2.9 versus 101+/-15.7; P<0.001, Fig. 2E). Strikingly, when cells were infected with Ad-PGC-1alpha, the ability of high glucose to induce VSMC proliferation was entirely lost (1.01+/-0.06x106 versus 1.05+/-0.06x106 cells/dish, P>0.05, n = 6, Fig. 2C). The wound healing assay showed that high glucose-induced VSMC migration was significantly decreased after overexpression of PGC-1alpha compared to control cells cultured at high glucose (35.55+/-11.10 versus 114.67+/-25.33 microm, P<0.001, n = 6, Fig. 2D). A similar result was seen in the transwell chamber assay, where the number of migrated cells in high glucose was 4+/-1 following overexpression of PGC-1alpha compared to 101+/-15.7 in the Ad-GFP infected cells (also at 15 mmol/L glucose) (Fig. 2E). Note that, under high glucose conditions, cells overexpressing PGC-1alpha essentially showed the same migration distance and number of migrated cells as the control cells (GFP group without high glucose stimulation). In summary, using multiple assay formats, overexpression of PGC-1alpha clearly suppresses high glucose-induced VSMC proliferation and migration.

To further test the effect of PGC-1alpha on VSMC proliferation and migration, we knocked down PGC-1alpha expression in VSMCs by siRNA interference. As shown in Fig. 3A and 3B, our siRNA inhibited PGC-1alpha expression to about 30%. In contrast to the inhibitory effect of elevated PGC-1alpha on VSMC growth, decreased PGC-1alpha level accelerated high glucose-induced VSMC proliferation and migration. Under high glucose conditions (15 mmol/L as in the previous experiments), knocking down PGC-1alpha increased VSMC number compared to control (1.99+/-0.37x106 versus 1.32+/-0.15x106 cells/dish, P<0.05, n = 6, Fig. 3C). In addition, following PGC-1alpha knock-down, VSMC migration distance was further induced under high glucose conditions when compared to the negative control group (N) (176.25+/-17.81 microm versus 126.25+/-23.82, P<0.05, n = 6, Fig. 3D). Finally, transwell analysis confirmed that PGC-1alpha knock-down increased the number of migrated VSMCs compared to control (190.20+/-9.78 versus 109.4+/-14.40, P<0.001, Fig. 3E).

In a previous study, we had shown that palmitic acid stimulates endogenous PGC-1alpha expression in VSMCs [24]. Therefore, we used palmitic acid in these experiments as yet another way of modulating PGC-1alpha and assessing the effects on cell growth and proliferation. 0.4 mmol/L palmitic acid alone increased PGC-1alpha mRNA level 2.7-fold after 48 h incubation, the protein level also increased after treatment with 0.4 mmol/L palmitic acid (Fig. 4A and 4B). The effect of palmitic acid on PGC-1alpha expression was not reversible by glucose, as shown by concomitant incubation of VSMCs with 15 mmol/L glucose and 0.4 mmol/L palmitic acid (Fig. 4A and 4B).

Relative to control, palmitic acid alone had no effect on VSMC proliferation (Fig. 4C) and migration(Fig. 4D and 4E), however VSMC proliferation and migration were kept to the level of the control when cells were incubated with high glucose plus palmitic acid. As shown in Fig. 4C, incubation of VSMCs with 0.4 mmol/L palmitic acid in the presence of 15 mmol/L glucose ablated the effect of high glucose on cell growth. (0.92+/-0.07x106 versus 1.38+/-0.05x106 cell/dish, P<0.001, n = 6, Fig. 4C). Data presented in Fig. 4D show that directional migration of VSMCs stimulated by high glucose were inhibited by palmitic acid (111.11+/-32.29 versus 32.10+/-15.42 microm, P<0.001, n = 6, Fig. 4D), and transwell analysis confirmed that the number of migrated cells was fewer in the PA+HG group than in the HG group (37+/-18.6 versus 107+/-14.0, P<0.001, n = 6, Fig. 4F).

To further investigate whether the inhibitory effects of palmitic acid on high glucose-induced VSMC proliferation and migration result from its capacity to elevate PGC-1alpha expression, we transfected VSMCs with siRNA to knock down PGC-1alpha, and then submitted the cells to the high glucose conditions while in presence of palmitic acid in the medium. We confirmed the interference efficiency and found that PGC-1alpha expression was decreased by 60-70% at both the mRNA and protein levels (data not shown). Following PGC-1alpha knockdown, the inhibitory effect of palmitic acid on VSMC proliferation and migration was abolished. As shown in Fig. 5A, in the presence of palmitic acid and high glucose, the number of cells in the siRNA-transfected cells was 1.3-fold higher than the negative control group (1.07+/-0.10x106 versus 0.85+/-0.07x106 cell/dish, P<0.05, n = 6, Fig. 5A). In the presence of high glucose and palmitic acid, migration distance was 81+/-11 microm following PGC-1alpha knock-down, but 37+/-12 um in the control group (Fig. 5B), a tendency mirrored in the transwell assay (113+/-3 versus 23.8+/-7 cells, P<0.001, n = 6, Fig. 5C). These results indicate that even in the presence of palmitic acid (a strong stimulant of PGC-1alpha expression), PGC-1alpha knockdown induces VSMC proliferation and migration, essentially to a level comparable to high glucose alone. Thus, PGC-1alpha is likely an integration point in VSMCs for nutrient signals, which are likely to engage different signaling pathways upstream of PGC-1alpha.

High glucose stimulates VSMC proliferation and migration through the activation of MAPK ERK signaling [3], [4]. Consistent with these reports, our results show that high glucose activated ERK1/2, a key element of the ERK MAPK pathway. Following PGC-1alpha overexpression, the ERK1/2 protein in VSMC no longer was activated by high glucose (see Fig. 6A), the phosphorylation of ERK in VSMCs transfected with Ad-PGC-1alpha decreased approximately 78% compared with that in Ad-GFP infected group under high glucose conditions. Furthermore, palmitic acid, which has been shown to stimulate PGC-1alpha expression, seemed to have little effect on ERK phosphorylation, but high glucose-induced phosphorylation of ERK almost reverted to the level of control by the addition of palmitic acid (see Fig. 6B). These results suggest that PGC-1alpha inhibits VSMC proliferation and migration through the inhibition of MAPK ERK pathway.

PGC-1alpha, an important transcriptional coactivator, plays a key role in energy metabolism [14], [15]. PGC-1alpha expression is highly related to glucose metabolism, and its expression level changes in various tissues in rodent models of diabetes. It has previously been shown that both mRNA and protein levels of PGC-1alpha were significantly reduced in adipose tissue from insulin-resistant subjects [23]. Similarly, decreases in the mRNA levels of PGC-1alpha were found in skeletal muscle from type 2 diabetics [21]. In contrast, PGC-1alpha mRNA levels are elevated in the liver [17], [20], as well as in hearts of rodents in models of both type 1 and type 2 diabetes [22]. These changes in PGC-1alpha levels served as a causal factor or as a mediator of the corresponding pathophysiologic processes. In addition to alterations of the insulin/glucagon axis, the direct effect of chronic hyperglycemia may affect the expression level of PGC-1alpha. In our previous study, we were the first to report that high glucose directly inhibits PGC-1alpha expression in isolated rat islets [25]. Here, we show that PGC-1alpha mRNA expression is inhibited in blood vessel media in STZ-diabetic rats. Further experiments revealed that high glucose directly, and dose-dependently, inhibits PGC-1alpha mRNA expression in cultured rat VSMCs (Fig. 1). These results indicate that high glucose decreases PGC-1alpha expression in VSMCs both in vivo and in vitro. However, the precise mechanism through which high glucose regulates PGC-1alpha expression in VSMC needs further study.

A large body of work has established that chronic hyperglycemia promotes VSMC proliferation and migration and contributes to the progress of diabetic atherosclerosis [1]-[3]. Previous studies show that the PPAR family of proteins may be involved in the process [7]. TZD inhibits VSMC proliferation and migration through the activation of PPARgamma, which tends to inhibit the expression of several genes involved in ERK-dependent mitogenic response, leading to the inhibition of cell growth and, finally, cell migration [8]-[12]. Given that PGC-1alpha acts as a transcriptional coactivator for PPARgamma, thus regulating many physiological processes [13]-[15], we hypothesized that the downregulation of PGC-1alpha by glucose may play a role in an in vitro-model of VSMC proliferation and migration induced by hyperglycemia. Our results show that overexpression of PGC-1alpha by adenoviral infection abolishes (Fig. 2), while suppression of PGC-1alpha amplifies (Fig. 3) hyperglycemia-induced VSMC proliferation and migration, providing evidence for a direct role of PGC-1alpha in this process.

As the most prevalent saturated FFA in circulation, palmitic acid has been shown to down-regulate PGC-1alpha expression in muscle cells [26]. Our previous study found that palmitic acid had no effect on VSMC proliferation and migration, but can markedly increase PGC-1alpha expression in VSMCs [24]. The mixtures of palmitic acid and high glucose exhibit no stimulatory effect on VSMC proliferation and migration accompanying a persisting induction of PGC-1alpha (Fig. 4). When PGC-1alpha is knocked down by siRNA interference, the stimulatory effect of high glucose on VSMC proliferation and migration was restored even in presence of palmitic acid (Fig. 5), indicating that PGC-1alpha is an integration point downstream of various nutrient-dependent signals that regulate VSMC proliferation and migration.

It was previously shown that high glucose induces mitogenesis in VSMCs through increasing extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) activity [3]-[6]. Activation of ERKs subsequently leads to the phosphorylation and the activation of a number of downstream targets, such as Elk-1 and Ets-1, which evoke c-Fos and MMP-9 and contribute to VSMCs growth and migration, respectively. In the present study, high glucose markedly increased phosphorylated ERK1/2 protein levels in VSMCs, whereas overexpression of PGC-1alpha completely abolished this phosphorylation (Fig. 6). However, little effect is observed either on VSMC proliferation and migration or on the activity of ERK1/2 when PGC-1alpha was overexpressed in the VSMCs without high glucose stimulation, indicating that the inhibitory effect of PGC-1alpha on VSMC proliferation and migration only exists in the cells which have been exposed and responded to the mitogenic signal, instead of quiescent VSMCs. These data suggest PGC-1alpha inhibits high glucose-induced ERK activity in VSMCs, and negative regulation of PGC-1alpha in VSMC proliferation and migration is achieved by inhibiting nuclear ERK MAPK signaling. Our results confirmed to the previous report which showed that overexpression of PGC-1alpha abolished oleic acid induced ERK1/2 activity. However, it also reported that PGC-1alpha expression was regulated in skeletal muscle cells through a mechanism involving MAPK-ERK and NF-kappaB activation (26), suggesting the interaction between PGC-1alpha expression and ERK1/2 phosphorylation are different in various cell types. The differences may attribute to different mechanism involved and may relate to the regulation of specific cell function. In VSMCs, given that PPARgamma has been reported to act as an inhibitory factor upstream of the ERK MAPK pathway (9-12) and PGC-1alpha is a co-activator of PPARgamma, the inhibitory effect of PGC-1alpha on ERK activity may be mediated through the coactivation of PPARgamma. The precise mechanisms of PGC-1alpha regulation on ERK activity merit further study.

In summary, our results suggest that high glucose increases VSMC proliferation and migration through PGC-1alpha. Experimental elevation of PGC-1alpha (by adenoviral overexpression or incubation with palmitic acid) inhibits high glucose-induced VSMC proliferation and migration. Thus, our results reveal a novel function of PGC-1alpha as a regulator of VSMC proliferation and migration, and provide a potential strategy of treatment for diabetic atherosclerosis.

Sprague-Dawley rats weighing about 180-200 g were made diabetic by a single injection of streptozotocin (55 mg/kg intraperitoneally) according to a previously described method [27], [28]. Blood glucose was monitored for up to 2 weeks, and only the rats with blood glucose >16.6 mM were used for further study. Six weeks after injection of streptozotocin, thoracic arterial samples were obtained, and the intima and outer and inner tissue layers were removed carefully from samples. The vessel mediae was quickly immersed in liquid nitrogen and transferred to a -80degreesC freezer for later use.

Primary vascular smooth muscle cells were isolated from the thoracic aortas of 3- to4-week-old male Sprague-Dawley rats and characterized morphologically and immunohistochemically as described previously [29], [30]. VSMCs were maintained in DMEM (Gibco-Invitrogen, Carlsbad, USA) containing 5.5 mmol/L glucose. VSMCs cultured for 4 to 8 passages were used. In glucose-stimulated experiments, VSMCs were incubated in serum-free DMEM medium containing 5.5, 11, 15 or 25 mmol/L glucose, respectively. In Palmitic acid-stimulated experiments, 0.4 mmol/L Palmitic acid (Sigma) was prepared as described previously [24]. Glucose (1000 mmol/L, dissolved in PBS then sterilized by filtration)were also supplemented to form a final concentration of 15 mmol/L glucose. 15 mM glucose (HG), 0.4 mmol/L Palmitic acid (PA), HG plus PA were then applied to VSMCs for 48 hours before RNA isolation or proliferation and migration assays were performed.

Cell counting analysis was performed for evaluation of the effect of glucose on VSMC proliferation. In separate experiments, VSMCs were seeded in 6 cm plastic dishes (1.5x105 cells/dish) and were allowed to grow to subconfluence, then were growth-arrested by serum deprivation for 12 h. Cells were then divided into several groups and were applied to different stimulation. After 48 h, cells were resuspended with 0.05% trypsin and 0.02% EDTA, and the cell number was determined with hemocytometer.

Migration of VSMCs was investigated by a standard in vitro wound assay [30], [31], and by the modified Boyden chamber assay [30], [32]. For the woundhealing assay, VSMCs were plated at an initial density of 1x105 cells/well on 6-well plates and were grown to confluence to form a monolayer, then subjected to adenovirus infection or siRNA interference according to the experiment requirements, a plastic cell scraper was then used to make an approximately 2.0 mm-width gap in the cell monolayer, different stimulants were added subsequently (set as 0 time point). A reference point was created on the bottom of the plate in the field of the wound using direct microscopic visualization. The measurement of the width of the gap after 48 h was subtracted from that at 0 h to give the distance the cells migrated. The results of the five readings from each well were averaged. Independent stimulation experiments were repeated three times. Boyden chamber cell migration assay was performed using transwell chambers with fibronection-coated 8-microm-pore-size polycarbonate membranes (BD Biosciences). Preconfluent VSMCs treated in the same way were then suspended in DMEM-0.5% FBS to a concentration of 4x105 cells/mL. Different fatty acids or serum free DMEM (0.6 mL) were added to the lower compartment. A 0.1-mL cell suspension (final concentration, 4x104 cells/well; diameter, 6.5 microm) was added to the upper compartment, and cells were then incubated at 37degreesC (95% air-5% CO2). 6 h later, non-migrated cells were removed with a cotton swab, and the migrated cells were fixed with paraformal-dehyde for 30 min and stained with crystal violet. Cell migration was quantified by blind counting of the migrated cells on the lower surface of the membrane of 5 fields per chamber under microscope.
