Dengue viruses (DENV) attach to the host cell surface and subsequently enter the cell by receptor-mediated endocytosis. Several primary and low affinity co-receptors for this flavivirus have been identified. However, the presence of these binding molecules on the cell surface does not necessarily render the cell susceptible to infection. Determination of which of them serve as bona fide receptors for this virus in the vector may be relevant to treating DENV infection and in designing control strategies.

(1) Overlay protein binding assay showed two proteins with molecular masses of 80 and 67 kDa (R80 and R67). (2) Specific antibodies against these two proteins inhibited cell binding and infection. (3) Both proteins were bound by all four serotypes of dengue virus. (4) R80 and R67 were purified by affinity chromatography from Ae. aegypti mosquito midguts and from Ae albopictus C6/36 cells. (5) In addition, a protein with molecular mass of 57 kDa was purified by affinity chromatography from the midgut extracts. (6) R80 and R67 from radiolabeled surface membrane proteins of C6/36 cells were immunoprecipitated by antibodies against Ae. aegypti midgut.

Dengue (DEN) is distributed worldwide in tropical and subtropical countries including Mexico and the USA and is the most common vector-borne viral disease in humans. Infection ranges from asymptomatic or mild self-limited illness (dengue fever, DF) to a severe disease with spontaneous hemorrhaging (dengue hemorrhagic fever, DHF), or, most seriously, to DEN shock syndrome (DSS) characterized by circulatory failure. Fifty million DEN infections with 500,000 cases of DHF and 12,000 deaths occur each year [1]. In the years 2002 to 2004, 23,826 cases of DEN and 5,557 of DHF were reported in Mexico [2].

The Dengue virus (family Flaviviridae, genus Flavivirus, species Dengue virus) infects mammalian [3] and vector cells. Neutralizing antibodies facilitate the binding and penetration of DENV into human macrophages; the virus-antibody complex binds Fc receptors [4]. This mechanism does not explain virus entry in primary infections or in cells with non-Fc receptors. Transmission electron microscopy shows that DEN viruses must attach to the cells [5,6], suggesting that the cells must have virus receptor(s) on their surfaces to be susceptible to infection. Proteins [7-12], heparan sulfates [13], LPS/CD14-associated binding proteins [14] and other glycoproteins [15] have been proposed as cellular receptors for DENV. In addition, DC-SIGN [16-18] has been suggested as a mediator of DENV infection in dendritic cells and could participate in binding large numbers of other viruses such as HIV-1, Ebola and CytoMV to host cell surfaces [19].

In C6/36 cells, two major polypeptides have been described with apparent molecular weights of 67 and 80 kDa, which bind to DEN virus serotype 2 (DENV2) [9]. The mechanism by which the virus enters mosquito cells is unknown. The presence of receptor(s) on the surface does not necessarily render a cell susceptible to infection. In natural infection, DENV is first deposited in the mosquito vector and then in a human host bitten by the vector during a blood meal. Therefore, it is necessary to study receptors in the mosquito midgut (MG) to determine which binding proteins serve as true virus receptors; they may be relevant to treating DEN infection and in designing control strategies. This is especially important because mosquitoes differ in their susceptibilities to infection, resulting in different vector competences [20-22].

The present study shows that the proteins R80 and R67 are the putative receptors in the MG of Ae. aegypti. Moreover, proteins with the same apparent molecular weights were purified by DENV2 affinity chromatography from the MG of this mosquito and from C6/36 cells. In addition, a protein with molecular weight of 57 kDa was also purified from mosquito MG extracts by affinity chromatography. Immunoprecipitation of radiolabeled membranes using Ae. aegypti anti-MG antibodies showed that R80 and R67 are contained in mosquito cell membranes. Furthermore, the four serotypes of DENV recognized the same proteins on Ae. aegypti and C6/36 cells.

Mosquito MG proteins were extracted with 0.05% of Triton X-100, separated by SDS-PAGE, blotted on to a PVDF membrane and incubated with biotinylated DENV2 virus to identify the putative receptors. Two prominent polypeptides with apparent molecular masses of 67 and 80 kDa were observed (Figure 1, panel A, lane 1). The negative control without virus showed no bands (data not shown).

To purify the putative receptors, DENV2 affinity chromatography was performed by passing cell membrane proteins from C6/36 cells from Ae. albopictus (Figure 1, panel A, lane 2) or MG proteins from Ae. aegypti through a DENV2-Sepharosetrade mark 4B column. Representative patterns (from 8 experiments) of C6/36 cell membrane or midgut proteins retained and eluted by the column (EP) are shown in Figure 1 panel A, lane 3, and Figure 1 panel B, respectively. Two major proteins with molecular masses of 67 (R67) and 80 (R80) kDa were observed. Figure 1A lane 2 shows the total protein pattern of C6/36 cells. MG proteins eluted from the column showed an additional band with apparent molecular weight of 57 kDa (Figure 1, panel B). Fraction 2 showed the 80 kDa protein (Figure 1, panel B, lane 2).

Antibody specificity was tested by immunoblotting (Figure 2, panel A, lanes 2, 4). Proteins with apparent molecular weights over 180 kDa were recognized.

All four serotypes led to the immunoprecipitation of proteins with molecular masses of 80 and 67 kDa (Figure 3, lanes 7-10).

Infection was allowed to proceed for 8 days and the amount of infectious virus was determined by viral plaque assays in LLC-MK2 cells (Figure 7). Maximal inhibition of infection was obtained with anti-EP and anti-R67 diluted 1:10 (Figure 7). These antibodies inhibited DEN 2 replication in the C6/36 cells nearly 1000-fold. Anti-R80 showed a relatively minor inhibitory effect of approximately 100-fold. Anti-EP, anti-R67 or anti-R80 diluted 1:50, and pre-immune serum, did not inhibit DEN2 replication in these cells.

Discussion
###end title 27
###begin p 28
When a mosquito takes a viremic blood meal, virions interact with receptors on the midgut epithelial cells and penetrate and infect them. Arbovirus blocked at early stages of midgut infection is considered a midgut infection barrier (MIB). A midgut escape barrier (MEB) is considered when infectious virions do not disseminate to hemoceles, or disseminate but do not infect secondary target organs.

Most studies of flavivirus vector competence in Ae. aegypti indicate that MIB is a major determinant of transmission [23-25] and shows wide variation both among and within Ae. aegypti populations for flaviviruses including DENV [20,22,25]. Moreover, Ae. aegypti MG is generally considered the best candidate tissue for disrupting the virus life cycle within the mosquito because it is the earliest interface between insect and virus (see above). This strongly suggests that DENV attachment to MG epithelial cell receptors is critical for understanding the initial virus-vector interactions and will help to explain MIBs to DENV infection and variations in vector competence. Furthermore, we would expect that virus serotype and genotype would influence virus attachment to midgut receptors.

Thus, identification of viral receptors in the MG represents a critical step in understanding vector competence and designing possible targets for preventing viral entry to cells and therefore inhibiting the infection. Feasible approaches to intervention are monoclonal antibodies blocking the receptor, and synthetic peptides mimicking the viral receptor and thus competing with the host receptor for virus attachment. This will allow novel strategies for the control and prevention of DEN to be developed. Published data have shown that the viral E protein is involved in target cell recognition [6,26,27]. Recent structural and genetic evidence [28,29] suggests that the prM/M stem-anchor region is also likely to play a role in virion entry to cells. Purification by DENV 2 affinity chromatography using native virus is a novel approach to obtaining the putative protein receptors for DENV.

Several authors using the overlay assay have identified polypeptides with molecular masses of 27, 45, 67 and 87 in macrophages [8], 40 and 70 in myelomonocytes [30], 45 and 72 kDa in B and T cells from humans [31], and two heparan sulfate containing cell-surface binding proteins resolving at 19 and 37 kDa in hepatocytes [32]. The data in the present paper strongly support the view that the 67 and 80 kDa proteins are receptors for DENV 1, 2, 3 and 4 in MG cells from Aedes aegypti. Furthermore, we have purified these proteins for the first time from both Ae. albopictus C6/36 cells and Ae. aegypti MGs using DENV2 affinity chromatography; we also generated specific antibodies against them, which inhibited binding and infection of cultured cells by DENV 2. These results contrast with those of Yazi-Mendoza et al. [33], who showed that DENV 4 binds to a 45 kDa protein in mosquito tissues. The results in Figure 2 clearly demonstrate that DENV 4 recognizes R67 and R80 in C6/36 cell membranes. A plausible explanation is that Yazi-Mendoza et al. [33] used total cell extracts for their VOPBA, while our results were obtained from plasma membranes, although viruses are known to have several receptors [7]. In any event, further experiments are needed to settle the point. Interestingly, Jindadamrongwech & Smith [7] found a serotype-specific heterogeneity among DENV binding proteins on HepG2 human Liver cells. It is therefore possible that different cell lines have different specificities for virus serotypes.

The specific antibodies against R67 and R80 inhibited radiolabeled DEN virus binding and the highest inhibition was observed with anti-MG antibodies, suggesting that other cell membrane molecules may participate in virus binding. Candidates include non-sialic acid carbohydrates, since we previously showed that sialic acid does not participate in virus binding [9]. In agreement with our results, Zieler et al. [29] failed to detect sialic acid in Ae. aegypti MG. More recently, Thaisomboonsuk et al. [34] reported the inability of neuroaminidase to inhibit DEN-2 virus binding to insect cells.

Collectively, the results corroborate the notion that DENV utilizes multiple cell surface molecules for binding to and infection of target cells, some of which may be common to all cells and shared among several viruses [6]. Interestingly, Sakoonwtanyoo et al. [12] suggested that one of these protein receptors for DENV 2, 3 and 4 may be a laminin-binding protein with an apparent mass of 50 kDa. Although we failed to detect a protein with this molecular mass, this does not eliminate the possibility.

In summary, specific membrane molecules are required for DENV binding and the nature of these molecules seems to depend on cell type. Interestingly, our results show that R67 and R80 are the putative receptors in the MG of Ae. aegypti mosquitoes, the principal DENV vector in America, and in Ae. albopictus C6/36 cells. In addition, these receptors are specific for all four serotypes of DENV.

This paper documents for the first time that the proteins R67 and R80 are putative receptors for dengue virus in the midgut of Ae. aegypti and in Ae. albopictus C6/36 cells, since specific antibodies against these proteins inhibited the binding and cytopathic effects of the virus. Furthermore, we have shown that these receptors are specific for all four serotypes of DENV.

After silver staining, each of the two main protein species (R80, R67) was excised from the gel, cut in small pieces, suspended in PBS and mixed with an equal volume of Titer-Max adjuvant (CyTRx Corporation) to immunize two groups of BALB/c mice. Pre-immune sera were obtained before immunization. Proteins eluted (EP) from the DENV2 affinity column were used to obtain specific polyclonal antibodies. A total of 10 mug of this protein was used to immunize the mice. MG extracts (100 mug), or C6/36 cell membrane extracts (50 mug), were also used to immunize mice [9]. After fifteen days, the mice received a booster; they were bled after thirty days. Sera were stored at -70degreesC until use. Antibody specificity was tested by ELISA and immunofluorescence.

VOPBA and DENV2 affinity chromatography of the virus dengue receptors. Proteins from Aedes aegypti MGs were extracted with 0.05% Triton X-100, separated by 10% SDS-PAGE and blotted on to a PVDF membrane. The putative receptors were revealed after incubation with DEN2 virus and peroxidase-labeled goat anti-mouse antibody (panel A, lane 1) as described in the methods section. Receptors were purified from C6/36 cell membranes (panel A, lane 3) or MG (fractions 1 and 2, panel B) by DENV2 affinity chromatography using a DEN2-Sepharosetrade mark 4B column as described in the methods section. The apparent molecular weights of these proteins are shown on the right side of panel A and on the left side of panel B. Proteins separated by SDS-PAGE were silver stained. The protein pattern of total C6/36 membranes is shown in panel A lane 2. Molecular weight markers are shown on the left side in panel A and on the right side in panel B.
