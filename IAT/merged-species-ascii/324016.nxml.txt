A DNA sequence of 1041 base pairs from a BamHI fragment containing the E. coli trpR gene has been determined. With this sequence and other experimental evidence, the primary structure (88 amino acids) of the Trp repressor can be predicted. Additional features of the DNA sequences include a 22 base pair region upstream from the proposed structural gene which exhibits striking homology with the trp operator, thus implying that expression of the trpR gene may be under autogenous regulation.
