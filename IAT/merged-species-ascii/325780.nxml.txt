The nucleotide sequence of a cDNA clone (pML10) for chicken cardiac myosin light chain is described. The cDNA insert contains 613 nucleotides representing the entire coding sequence, with the exception of nine NH2-terminal amino acids, and the full 3'-non-coding region of 146 nucleotides. The missing 5' terminus of the mRNA, not represented in the clone pML10, was obtained by extension of the cDNA using a 43 nucleotide long internal EcoR1 fragment as a primer. The non-coding region contains several direct and inverted repeated sequences and the polyadenylation signal sequence AATAAA. The coding portion exhibits non-random usage of synonymous codons with a strong bias for codons ending in G and C.
