TNFalpha is increased in the synovial fluid of patients with rheumatoid arthritis and osteoarthritis. TNFalpha activates mitogen-activated kinase kinase (MEK)/extracellular regulated kinase (ERK) in chondrocytes; however, the overall functional relevance of MEK/ERK to TNFalpha-regulated gene expression in chondrocytes is unknown.

Methods
###end title 4
###begin p 5
Chondrocytes were treated with TNFalpha with or without the MEK1/2 inhibitor U0126 for 24 hours. Microarray analysis and real-time PCR analyses were used to identify genes regulated by TNFalpha in a MEK1/2-dependent fashion. Promoter/reporter, immunoblot, and electrophoretic mobility shift assays were used to identify transcription factors whose activity in response to TNFalpha was MEK1/2 dependent. Decoy oligodeoxynucleotides bearing consensus transcription factor binding sites were introduced into chondrocytes to determine the functionality of our results.

Results
###end title 6
###begin p 7
Approximately 20% of the genes regulated by TNFalpha in chondrocytes were sensitive to U0126. Transcript regulation of the cartilage-selective matrix genes Col2a1, Agc1 and Hapln1, and of the matrix metalloproteinase genes Mmp-12 and Mmp-9, were U0126 sensitive - whereas regulation of the inflammatory gene macrophage Csf-1 was U0126 insensitive. TNFalpha-induced regulation of Sox9 and NFkappaB activity was also U0126 insensitive. Conversely, TNFalpha-increased early growth response 1 (Egr-1) DNA binding was U0126 sensitive. Transfection of chondrocytes with cognate Egr-1 oligodeoxynucleotides attenuated the ability of TNFalpha to suppress Col2a1, Agc1 or Hapln1 mRNA expression.

Conclusions

###begin p 9
Our results suggest that MEK/ERK and Egr1 are required for TNFalpha-regulated catabolic and anabolic genes of the cartilage extracellular matrix, and hence may represent potential targets for drug intervention in osteoarthritis or rheumatoid arthritis.

Chondrocytes maintain articular cartilage through coordinated production and degradation of the extracellular matrix. Type II collagen, aggrecan, and link protein - encoded by the genes Col2a1, Agc1 and Hapln1, respectively - are major components of the articular cartilage extracellular matrix (ECM). Type II collagen is the major structural collagen of articular cartilage [1]. Aggrecan is the most abundant proteoglycan, and is responsible for resisting the compressive forces imposed on articulating joints [2]. Finally, link protein stabilizes the association of aggrecan with hyaluronic acid [3]. The expression of these ECM proteins is regulated by transcription factors within the nucleus promoting or inhibiting transcript production. Sry-type high-mobility group box-9 (Sox9) is a regulatory transcription factor that binds DNA at specific sites within Col2a1, Agc1 and Hapln genes to induce their transcription [4-6].

In diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis and osteoarthritis there is a shift in the equilibrium in cartilage production and degradation towards catabolism. TNFalpha, a potent inflammatory mediator, is found at higher levels in the synovial fluid bathing articular cartilage in diseased joints compared with that of normal, healthy joints [7-9]. Previous work has shown that treatment of chondrocytes with TNFalpha downregulates the expression of Col2a1, Agc1 and Hapln1 without inducing apoptosis [10-13]. Furthermore, the activation of NFkappaB) by TNFalpha signalling reduces Sox9 activity, possibly through competition for the transcriptional cofactor p300 [10,12]. Other signalling pathways are known to be activated by TNFalpha, however, including the extracellular regulated kinase (ERK)/mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway (reviewed in [14]).

TNFalpha initiates the activation of ERK/mitogen-activated protein kinase through the adaptor protein, Grb2, binding to the TNFalpha receptor 1, leading to activation of the ras/mitogen-activated kinase kinase (MEK)/ERK signalling cascade [15]. In immortalized chondrocytes and primary rat chondrocytes, ERK1/2 can be phosphorylated as early as 15 minutes of treatment with TNFalpha [10,11]. Inhibition of MEK1/2 signalling can attenuate the decreases in Col2a1, Agc1 and Hapln1, as determined by northern blot analysis [10,11]. TNFalpha also regulates the activity of NFkappaB and Sox9 in chondrocytes [10,12]. TNFalpha-induced NFkappaB DNA binding in immortalized chondrocytes is reduced by inhibition of MEK1/2 signalling [10]. TNFalpha may therefore regulate the expression of a subset of genes by alterations in the activity of these transcription factors in a MEK1/2-dependent manner.
###end p 13
###begin p 14
Although some information is known about selected changes in chondrocyte gene expression in response to TNFalpha-activated MEK/ERK signalling, the overall impact of this pathway on changes to the chondrocyte gene expression and the downstream transcriptional mechanisms mediating these changes has been poorly defined. We sought to identify the extent to which MEK/ERK may contribute to the overall changes in chondrocyte gene expression in response to TNFalpha.
###end p 14
###begin p 15
In the present study, we found that ERK1/2 undergoes multiple temporal phosphorylation events in response to TNFalpha-induced MEK1/2 activation. We discovered that approximately 20% of the genes that changed at least 1.45-fold with TNFalpha were dependent on MEK1/2 activation. A significant subset of these genes encoded proteins that localized to the extracellular space and had collagenase or hyaluronic acid binding activities. We determined that specific matrix metalloproteinases and cartilage-selective ECM transcript levels were regulated by MEK/ERK, while transcripts of the inflammatory gene macrophage colony stimulating factor 1 (Csf-1), were regulated in a MEK1/2-independent manner. Surprisingly, the activation of NFkappaB and the inhibition of Sox9 activity by TNFalpha were independent of MEK1/2. The DNA binding activity of the transcription factor early growth response 1 (Egr-1), however, was regulated by TNFalpha-activated MEK1/2 signalling. Finally, we determined that Egr family members are responsible for the TNFalpha-induced, MEK-dependent reductions in mRNA transcripts. Egr-1 may therefore regulate a select number of genes in response to TNFalpha-activated MEK/ERK signalling.
###end p 15
###begin p 16
These findings reveal that MEK/ERK-dependent transcription factors that are downstream of TNFalpha, such as Egr-1, may be targets for therapeutic intervention to treat the pathophysiology of arthritis without disrupting other potential positive effects of TNFalpha.

Chondrocytes were isolated from the femoral condyles of neonatal (1 day old) rats as previously described [10]. The cartilage canals in newborn rats do not form in the femoral condyles until 5 days postnatal and radiographic signs of the secondary ossification centre do not appear until about 10 days postnatal [16]. Furthermore, to avoid hypertrophic chondrocytes, the upper two-thirds of the cartilage was taken. Cells were plated onto tissue culture plastic (Falcon, Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA) at a density of ~2.5 x 104 cells/cm2. Under these conditions, the culture consists of an essentially pure chondrocyte population.

Monolayer chondrocyte cultures were grown in RPMI 1640 media (Invitrogen, Burlington, ON, Canada) supplemented with 5% foetal bovine serum, 100 U/ml penicillin, 100 mug/ml streptomycin and 1% HEPES buffer (Invitrogen) until approximately 90% confluence was reached (6 to 7 days). Prior to treatment, chondrocytes were incubated in serum-free media overnight. For inhibitor studies, chondrocytes were pretreated with the selective MEK1/2 inhibitor U0126 (10 muM; Promega, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Rockford, IL, USA) [17] for 30 minutes. As previously shown, U0126 has very low inhibitory activity towards other protein kinases [18]. Furthermore, previous studies in our laboratory have demonstrated that 24-hour treatment with 10 muM U0126 had no significant effect on the cell morphology or organization in culture [11]. As controls, cultures were treated in parallel with dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) (vehicle for inhibitors), U0124 (10 muM; Calbiochem, EMD Biosciences Inc., La Jolla, CA, USA) or the selective epidermal growth factor receptor inhibitor PD153035 (1 muM; Calbiochem, EMD Biosciences Inc.) [19]. Cultures were then treated with human recombinant TNFalpha (30 ng/ml; Endogen, Thermo Fisher Scientific) for 15 minutes to 24 hours.

Nuclear and cytoplasmic extracts were isolated using a modified method of Dignam and colleagues [20], as previously described [10]. Total cell extracts were isolated using RIPA buffer as previously described [21]. Protein concentration was determined using the Pierce BCA Protein assay kit (Pierce, Thermo Fisher Scientific), as per the manufacturers' instructions. For western blotting, 20 mug cytoplasmic protein was loaded into 10% polyacrylamide gels containing SDS and separated by electrophoresis. Proteins were transferred onto Protrantrade mark nitrocellulose membranes (Whatman, Inc., Florham Park, NJ, USA) by electroblotting and were stained with Ponceau S to qualitatively determine equal loading of samples and efficient transfer of proteins. Membranes were blocked in 5% nonfat milk (Carnation, North York, ON, Canada) in 0.05% Tris-buffered saline containing 0.05% Tween-20 (TBST) for 1 hour followed by incubation with primary antibodies in blocking buffer overnight. Membranes were washed in TBST and incubated in 5% milk-TBST with appropriate secondary antibody for 45 minutes to 1.5 hours. Membranes were then washed with TBST and rinsed in Tris-buffered saline prior to incubation in Supersignal West Pico Chemiluminescent Substrate (Pierce, Thermo Fisher Scientific) and exposed to Amersham Hyperfilm ECL (GE Healthcare Bio-Sciences Inc., Baie d'Urfe, QC, Canada). Membranes were stripped using 1 M glycine, pH 2.5, and washed using TBST prior to reprobing.

The raw expression values were imported into Genespring GX 7.3 (Agilent Technologies). Raw expression values <0.01 were set to 0.01 and the normalization per chip was set to the 50th percentile. Relative gene expression of the 31,099 probe sets on the chip was determined by normalizing the raw expression values for each probe set to the DMSO control (= one-fold change for each probe set) from each independent experiment. To identify genes that were TNFalpha-regulated, probe sets that were altered >/= 1.45 in DMSO/TNFalpha-treated cultures compared with DMSO-treated cultures were determined for each independent experiment. Probe sets identified as being TNFalpha regulated in both independent experiments were selected for further analysis. Genes whose transcript levels changed >/= 1.45-fold were selected for study, as our microarray analysis revealed that aggrecan mRNA - a transcript previously shown to be TNFalpha sensitive [12] - was reduced approximately 1.45-fold and thus served as a positive control establishing the validity of our microarray data.

To identify probe sets whose changes were altered by TNFalpha in a MEK1/2-dependent fashion, we normalized the fold change in gene expression of U0126/TNFalpha-treated cultures to that of cultures treated with U0126 alone from both independent experiments. We determined probe sets that were altered <1.45-fold in response to DMSO/TNFalpha treatment, and hence were TNFalpha regulated in a U0126-sensitive fashion. The remainder of the genes on the lists of TNFalpha-regulated probe sets were determined to be TNFalpha regulated and MEK independent. Probe sets identified as being TNFalpha regulated and MEK/ERK dependent or MEK/ERK independent in both independent experiments were selected for further analysis.

Genes were also identified whose basal expression was sensitive to U0126 alone. Probe sets altered >/= 1.45-fold in response to U0126 treatment relative to DMSO treatment were identified in both independent experiments. The limited number of genes that were altered with U0126 in both experiments (89/31,099) prevented the use of meaningful cluster analysis, but nonetheless served as a potent indication of the selectivity of the U0126 inhibitor. The generated list was then compared with the list of genes changing >/= 1.45-fold with DMSO/TNFalpha to identify genes that were basal TNFalpha independent but MEK/ERK dependent and those genes that were both TNFalpha and basal MEK/ERK dependent.

The fold change in the transcript levels increased or decreased >/= 1.45-fold in both independent experiments was averaged. The generated lists of genes determined as TNFalpha-activated MEK/ERK dependent and TNFalpha-activated MEK/ERK independent were analysed using the gene ontology browser in Genespring GX 7.3. Major cellular components and molecular functions subcategories of protein products from the list of genes were identified. The resulting list of cellular component ontologies was filtered such that a minimum of 10 genes must be in the initial group of annotated genes from the microarray and the resulting subcategory must be significantly represented (P < 0.05). Selected genes within the extracellular space ontology were then organized into subcategories that were significantly represented by the molecular function ontologies (P < 0.01).

Confluent cell cultures were detached using trypsin-ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid (Invitrogen), pelleted, and resuspended in serum-free culture medium. Cells were then plated into 48-well dishes (3.4 x 104 cells/well) in 200 mul and were transfected with equal amounts of reporter plasmids. The reporter plasmids used in this study included the kappaB reporter (BD Biosciences, Mississauga, ON, Canada), comprising four tandem repeats of the kappaB response element upstream of the firefly luciferase reporter sequence and a type II collagen enhancer luciferase reporter (Sox9 reporter) containing four repeats of the 48-base-pair minimal enhancer of the type II collagen gene (pGL3 (4 x 48)) [22]. Each minimal enhancer sequence contains a binding site for Sox9. Multiple repeats of the minimal enhancer are required for optimal firefly luciferase expression [23]. Cells were transfected with 20 mul serum-free media containing the equivalent of 0.156 mug Sox9 reporter or NFkappaB reporter and 0.352 mul Fugene 6 transfection reagent (Roche Diagnostics Corporation, Indianapolis, IN, USA). In all experiments, chondrocytes were co-transfected with a 0.002 mug renilla luciferase plasmid (pRL-CMV; Thermo Fisher Scientific) to control for transfection efficiency.

Competition assays were performed by adding 100-fold molar excess of unlabelled probe to the nuclear extract-labelled probe mixture. Antibody interference assays were performed by adding 2 mug antibody against Egr-1 (specific) or NFkappaB (nonspecific) 1 hour prior to the addition of nuclear extract to the buffered radiolabelled DNA. Samples were loaded into 4% polyacrylamide gels and were electrophoresed for 3.5 hours. Following electrophoresis, gels were dried and exposed to Amersham Hyperfilm-MP (GE Healthcare Bio-Sciences Inc.) at -80degreesC.

We have shown previously that TNFalpha induces ERK phosphorylation in primary articular chondrocytes 15 minutes post treatment [11]. To confirm and extend these results, we used western blot analysis to show that TNFalpha induced ERK1/2 phosphorylation 15 minutes post treatment (Figure 1), followed by a decrease in phosphorylation status (data not shown). ERK1/2 phosphorylation was again increased at 90 minutes post treatment (Figure 1). As anticipated, both the increases at 15 minutes and at 90 minutes could be inhibited by the MEK1/2 inhibitor U0126, but not its inactive isoform U0124 (Figure 1). Based on these data, we used U0126 as an inhibitor to assess the effect of blocking MEK1/2 on the mRNA expression pattern modulated by application of TNFalpha to chondrocytes.

To investigate the global impact of U0126 on TNFalpha-modulated gene expression in chondrocytes, we utilized microarrays to analyse changes in chondrocyte mRNA expression. Cells were serum-starved overnight and were treated with or without U0126 (10 muM, 30 min) prior to addition of TNFalpha for 24 hours. Cells were treated with TNFalpha for 24 hours as previous data showed that this length of TNFalpha treatment was necessary to generate a TNFalpha-mediated suppression of chondrocyte matrix genes, owing to the stability of chondrocyte matrix gene mRNAs [27-30].

Microarray analysis from two independent experiments determined that 629 genes were regulated by TNFalpha signalling in both sets of experiments by at least 1.45-fold, the majority of which were increased in response to TNFalpha (Figure 2). Of these genes, alterations of 138 (~22%) were attenuated with U0126. Furthermore, of the remaining genes that were not regulated by TNFalpha, 62 genes were regulated by U0126 alone, indicating that basal MEK/ERK activity may also play a role in chondrocyte gene regulation. Complete microarray data have been deposited in the Gene Expression Omnibus public repository [GEO:GSE14402].

We further analysed the lists of genes that were induced by TNFalpha using specific gene ontologies. Analysis of the list of TNFalpha-induced, MEK/ERK-dependent and MEK/ERK-independent probe sets indicated that there was significant representation (P < 0.05) of genes whose protein products localize to the extracellular space within both lists (Table 1). Further analysis of the list of TNFalpha-regulated, MEK/ERK-dependent genes - whose products are found in the extracellular space - indicated that some of these genes were significantly categorized by the molecular function of their protein products into categories that included hyaluronic acid binding activity (including Agc1 and Hapln1) and proteinase activity (including Mmp-9 and Mmp-12). Analysis of the TNFalpha-regulated, MEK/ERK-independent list of genes whose protein products were localized to the extracellular space determined that many of the protein products of these genes were involved in a variety of activities, including chemokine/cytokine activity - including macrophage Csf-1 - and various protease activities. The inflammatory genes, however, appeared to be primarily U0126 insensitive.

To validate the changes in gene expression in response to TNFalpha-induced MEK/ERK signalling determined by the microarray analysis, we identified the relative changes in transcript levels of the extracellular matrix components Agc1, Hapln1, and Col2a1, proteases Mmp-9 and Mmp-12, as well as the inflammatory cytokine macrophage Csf-1 (Figure 3). TNFalpha decreased Agc1 and Hapln1 (Figure 3a, b) and increased Mmp-9 and Mmp-12 (Figure 3e, f) in a MEK/ERK-dependent manner. In addition, Col2a1 - a gene not identified as MEK/ERK sensitive by microarray analysis - was also determined to be MEK/ERK sensitive (Figure 3c). Pretreatment with U0126, however, only partially attenuated the TNFalpha-induced reductions in Agc1, Hapln1 and Col2a1 transcript levels - to a level only moderately, but not significantly, lower than control treated cultures, suggesting the possible involvement of other pathways (Figure 3a to 3c). Conversely, TNFalpha-induced increases in macrophage Csf-1 were independent of MEK/ERK signalling (Figure 3d). As anticipated, the inactive U0126 analogue U0124 had no effect in any of the assays tested. Taken together, these results suggest that U0126 may attenuate the changes in chondrocyte gene expression towards a catabolic phenotype while allowing for inflammatory processes to be undisturbed.

We next wanted to determine the possible molecular basis for TNFalpha-modulated, U0126-sensitive gene expression. First, we investigated whether U0126 affected the ability of TNFalpha to regulate the activity of the transcription factors Sox9 and NFkappaB, which are known to be regulated by TNFalpha in chondrocytes [10,12]. As expected, TNFalpha significantly reduced the level of Sox9 activity and increased the level of NFkappaB activity in chondrocytes (P < 0.01; Figure 4a, b). There was no significant effect, however, on the level of inhibition or the induction of Sox9 and NFkappaB activity, respectively, by either U0124 or U0126 (P > 0.05; Figure 4a, b). Furthermore, we found that TNFalpha-induced DNA binding of NFkappaB was reduced by pretreatment with DMSO (vehicle for the inhibitors) and was not further reduced by pretreatment with U0124, U0126 or the selective epidermal growth factor receptor inhibitor, PD153035 (Figure 4c). These results indicate that transcription factors other than Sox9 and NFkappaB are targets of TNFalpha-induced MEK/ERK signalling.

We then used electrophoretic mobility shift assays to investigate whether the binding of Egr-1 to DNA was dependent on TNFalpha-induced MEK/ERK signalling. Nuclear extracts from chondrocytes treated with TNFalpha for 90 minutes increased the DNA binding of two complexes containing Egr-1 to an Egr consensus DNA binding site (Figure 6, arrowheads). Both complexes were reduced when extracts were preincubated with a 100-fold molar excess of double-stranded cold Egr consensus ODNs, but not with cold mutant Egr ODNs or NFkappaB consensus ODNs (Figure 6, arrowheads). Compared with preincubation of extracts with the anti-NFkappaB p65 antibody, preincubation of extracts with the anti-Egr-1 antibody specifically reduced the DNA-protein complexes attributed by the Egr consensus ODN competition studies to be a result of Egr/DNA binding (Figure 6, arrowheads). Pretreatment of cells with U0126 attenuated the increase in complex formation of both identified complexes. The binding of the identified complexes to DNA was inhibited by pretreatment with U0126 but not with U0124, indicating DNA binding of Egr-1 is dependent on TNFalpha-activated MEK/ERK signalling.

To determine whether decreases in chondrocyte selective matrix gene expression in response to TNFalpha were dependent on the genomic DNA binding activity of Egr family members, we transfected cells with double-stranded ODNs containing phosphorothiolate modifications corresponding to the cognate and a mutated form of the Egr-DNA binding sequence (Figure 7). Transfection of cells with mutant double-stranded ODNs did not disrupt decreases induced by TNFalpha to Col2a1, Agc1 or Hapln1 transcript levels. Transfection using the cognate Egr double-stranded ODNs, however, attenuated the decreases in transcript levels of Col2a1, Agc1 and Hapln1 by TNFalpha. Egr-containing complexes, probably that include Egr-1, are therefore responsible for the reduced transcript levels of cartilage selective matrix genes in response to TNFalpha in chondrocytes.

Competitive inhibition of Egr transcription factor-DNA binding attenuates TNFalpha decreases in cartilage matrix transcripts. Chondrocytes were transfected with 2 muM double-stranded, phosphorothiol-modified oligodeoxynucleotides containing Egr mutant or consensus DNA binding sequences and were treated with vehicle (black bars) or TNFalpha (grey bars) for 24 hours. Total RNA was collected and analysed by quantitative real-time PCR for (a) Agc1, (b) Hapln1 and (c) Col2a1, or 18S transcript levels. Data were analysed by the DeltaDeltaCt method to acquire matrix gene transcript levels relative to 18S. Data from cells transfected with the Egr mutant or consensus oligodeoxynucleotides were normalized to vehicle-treated cultures and were log-transformed prior to analysis by paired and Student's t tests. *Significant difference (P < 0.05 by paired t test) in transcript levels compared with vehicle-treated cells transfected with the same oligodeoxynucleotide. #Significant difference in transcript levels between cultures transfected with mutant or consensus Egr binding sequences and treated with TNFalpha (P < 0.05 by Student's t test). Results are displayed as the mean +/- standard error of five independent experiments.

In the present study, we used the MEK1/2 inhibitor U0126 to identify the possible contribution of the MEK/ERK signalling pathway to changes in chondrocyte gene expression in response to TNFalpha. Inspection of the ~20% of TNFalpha-regulated chondrocyte mRNAs whose expression was modulated by MEK1/2 revealed a significant representation of genes whose protein products localized to the extracellular space, and had proteinase activity (for example, Mmp-9 and Mmp-12, which were induced by TNFalpha) or hyaluronic acid binding activity (for example, the matrix-associated genes Agc1 and Hapln1, which were suppressed by TNFalpha). Mmp-9 and Mmp-12 cleave selective proteoglycans and collagens [32-34] while Mmp-9 is also an important mediator of inflammatory arthritis [35]. Furthermore, we have shown that increases in transcripts encoding proinflammatory genes, such as macrophage Csf-1, were U0126 insensitive. Collectively these results suggest the intriguing notion that, compared with the TNFalpha-regulated transcript levels of genes involved in inflammation, TNFalpha-induced matrix catabolism may selectively require MEK/ERK. Further efforts will be required to assess whether similar mechanisms might operate in adult rat or human chondrocytes, or in cells isolated from patients with arthritis. Nonetheless, our data - for the first time - suggest that MEK inhibitors modify the excessive matrix degradation in arthritis.

Consistent with TNFalpha-induced increases in macrophage Csf-1 transcript levels observed in this study, macrophage Csf-1 protein levels are also induced by TNFalpha in chondrocytes [36]. In rat articular chondrocytes, macrophage Csf-1-induced signalling increases its own expression and the expression of the matricellular protein CCN2 (formerly known as connective tissue growth factor) [37]. CCN2 is required for Col2a1 and Agc1 expression in mouse chondrocytes [38] yet does not result in hypertrophic differentiation of rat articular chondrocytes [39]. Taken together, inhibition of TNFalpha-induced MEK/ERK or downstream transcription factors may rescue cartilage ECM gene expression and promote articular cartilage regeneration through continued macrophage Csf-1 expression.

In immortalized chondrocytes, NFkappaB-DNA binding activity is dependent on TNFalpha-induced MEK/ERK signalling [10], consistent with studies in other immortalized cells such as B-cell lymphoma cell lines [40]. In our present study using primary chondroctyes, however, both TNFalpha-regulated NFkappaB reporter activity and NFkappaB-DNA binding were unaltered by MEK/ERK inhibition. Immortalized cells may therefore have altered signalling that activates NFkappaB in a MEK/ERK-dependent manner by TNFalpha. Furthermore, we showed that pretreatment of primary chondrocytes with DMSO or DMSO-soluble inhibitors, such as U0124, U0126 and PD153035, reduced TNFalpha-activated NFkappaB-DNA binding activity. The regulation of NFkappaB-DNA binding in primary cells can therefore be explained by the nonspecific effect of DMSO on NFkappaB activation.

In the present study we determined that, in addition to NFkappaB, TNFalpha-regulated reductions in Sox9 activity were also independent of MEK/ERK signalling. Previous studies from our laboratory have shown that reductions in Sox9 activity by TNFalpha are dependent on NFkappaB nuclear translocation [10,12], a mechanism probably involving reductions in p300 histone acetylase activity associated with Sox9 [12]. MEK/ERK-independent reductions in Sox9 activity could therefore explain the inability of U0126 to completely reverse the TNFalpha-induced reductions in cartilage ECM gene transcript levels observed in this study.

We showed that Egr-1 DNA binding was increased by TNFalpha in a U0126-sensitive fashion. Moreover, competitive inhibition of Egr-1 binding to genomic targets attenuated decreases in cartilage ECM genes in response to TNFalpha. These results suggest that TNFalpha can modify gene expression in chondrocytes via MEK/ERK through the induction of Egr-1 DNA binding activity. Treatment of chondrocytes with IL-1 increases the Egr-1 protein and DNA binding, leading to decreased human type II collagen promoter activity through competition of Egr-1 for the Sp1 binding sites [31]. Previous studies have also identified that there are putative Sp1 binding sites in the aggrecan promoter of the chick, mouse and rat [25,41]. In this study, we identified putative overlapping binding sites for Sp1 and Egr-1 in both the rat COL2A1 and AGC1 promoters proximal to the transcriptional start site. Although beyond the scope of our current report, Col2a1 and Agc1 transcription are probably regulated by inhibitory actions of Egr-1 in competition for Sp1 binding sites. Collectively, these data suggest that, in chondrocytes, alterations in Egr-1 DNA binding activity by TNFalpha-induced MEK/ERK signalling is necessary for the transcriptional regulation of downstream cartilage ECM genes.

In the current study, pharmacological inhibition of MEK resulted in significant attenuation of the TNFalpha-induced decreases to Col2a1, Agc1 and Hapln1 24 hours post treatment. Depending on the species the half-life of Col2a1 mRNA in chondrocytes is between 15 and 18 hours [27,29,30], whereas the half-life of Agc1 mRNA is about 4 hours in bovine articular chondrocytes [28]. In this study we observed ~50% reduction in Col2a1 and ~70% reduction in Agc1 transcript levels after 24 hours. Previous studies from our laboratory have indicated that inhibition of Col2a1 transcripts in response to TNFalpha results from an inhibition of transcription and not from changes to message stability [10]. Furthermore, treatment of chondrocytes with actinomycin D, a transcription inhibitor, decreased Col2a1 and Agc1 mRNAs to a level comparable with that of TNFalpha treatment alone (unpublished data). Collectively, TNFalpha-induced reductions in cartilage ECM transcripts in this study are consistent with regulation of these mRNAs through inhibition of transcription. Although it is possible that TNFalpha may modulate cartilage ECM transcript expression in an indirect fashion, the relatively delayed kinetics of TNFalpha-modulated cartilage ECM transcripts is probably due to the stability of the mRNAs.

Most therapies for rheumatoid arthritis, specifically biologics, are targeted towards TNFalpha protein and not towards its activated signalling pathways [42]. Targeted therapies that block specific subcellular molecules involved in TNFalpha-activated signalling pathways, however, may be useful in selectively modifying chondrocyte responses to TNFalpha. Our data suggest that MEK/ERK may selectively be required for TNFalpha-modulated proteinase and cartilage ECM transcripts, but not for inflammatory gene transcripts. These results raise the intriguing notion that MEK/ERK inhibitors might be used to block the ability of TNFalpha to promote matrix catabolism but leave perhaps more beneficial effects of TNFalpha unaltered. In the long term, our observations may be of relevance for developing new methods of treating arthritis. In particular, antagonizing MEK/ERK or activating Egr-1 may be useful methodologies for reversing cartilage degradation observed in both osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis.
