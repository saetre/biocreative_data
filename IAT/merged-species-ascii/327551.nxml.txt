The promoter and the amino-terminal region of phoA, the structural gene for alkaline phosphatase of Escherichia coli K12, was cloned by using a promoter cloning vector pMC1403. The nucleotide sequence of the cloned fragment has been determined. A sequence encoding the amino-terminal portion of mature alkaline phosphatase is found and it is preceded by a sequence encoding the signal peptide. The signal peptide consists of 21 amino acids; Met-Lys-Gln-Ser-Thr-Ile-Ala-Leu-Ala-Leu-Leu-Pro-Leu-Leu-Phe-Thr-Pro-Val-Thr-Lys-Ala. The translation initiation codon is GUG, which is preceded by the Shine-Dalgarno sequence GGAG. Upstream to these sequences, there is a typical procaryotic promoter. TATAGTC for the Pribnow box. Around the Pribnow box, there are several dyad symmetrical sequences, which may probably be concerned with the regulation of this gene.
