Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) contains higher steady-state levels of oxidative damage and mutates at rates significantly greater than nuclear DNA. Oxidative lesions in mtDNA are removed by a base excision repair (BER) pathway. All mtDNA repair proteins are nuclear encoded and imported. Most mtDNA repair proteins so far discovered are either identical to nuclear DNA repair proteins or isoforms of nuclear proteins arising from differential splicing. Regulation of mitochondrial BER is therefore not expected to be independent of nuclear BER, though the extent to which mitochondrial BER is regulated with respect to mtDNA amount or damage is largely unknown. Here we have measured DNA BER activities in lysates of mitochondria isolated from human 143B TK- osteosarcoma cells that had been depleted of mtDNA (rho0) or not (wt). Despite the total absence of mtDNA in the rho0 cells, a complete mitochondrial BER pathway was present, as demonstrated using an in vitro assay with synthetic oligonucleotides. Measurement of individual BER protein activities in mitochondrial lysates indicated that some BER activities are insensitive to the lack of mtDNA. Uracil and 8-oxoguanine DNA glycosylase activities were relatively insensitive to the absence of mtDNA, only about 25% reduced in rho0 relative to wt cells. Apurinic/apyrimidinic (AP) endonuclease and polymerase gamma activities were more affected, 65 and 45% lower, respectively, in rho0 mitochondria. Overall BER activity in lysates was also about 65% reduced in rho0 mitochondria. To identify the limiting deficiencies in BER of rho0 mitochondria we supplemented the BER assay of mitochondrial lysates with pure uracil DNA glycosylase, AP endonuclease and/or the catalytic subunit of polymerase gamma. BER activity was stimulated by addition of uracil DNA glycosylase and polymerase gamma. However, no addition or combination of additions stimulated BER activity to wt levels. This suggests that an unknown activity, factor or interaction important in BER is deficient in rho0 mitochondria. While nuclear BER protein levels and activities were generally not altered in rho0 cells, AP endonuclease activity was substantially reduced in nuclear and in whole cell extracts. This appeared to be due to reduced endogenous reactive oxygen species (ROS) production in rho0 cells, and not a general dysfunction of rho0 cells, as exposure of cells to ROS rapidly stimulated increases in AP endonuclease activities and APE1 protein levels.

Oxidative attack of DNA results in a wide range of chemical modifications, many of which are highly mutagenic. Genomic stability is maintained, in part, by reversing and/or repairing these lesions before mutations can occur. In the nucleus this task is accomplished primarily by the base excision repair (BER) pathway, which first recognizes and cleaves specific base lesions from DNA, followed by abasic site processing, gap-filling and ligation of the DNA strand. Mammalian mitochondria, which contain their own (16.5 kb) DNA molecule, have their own DNA repair systems (1). The mitochondrial BER proteins that have been identified are virtually all either identical to those found in the nucleus or are isoforms of nuclear BER proteins arising from variant RNA splicing. Little is known about the molecular organization of BER in mammalian mitochondria. Similarly, limited information is available regarding the regulation of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) repair, including the extent to which it is regulated independently of nuclear BER. Mitochondrial genomic stability is adversely affected in numerous human pathologies, including cancers, diabetes and neurodegenerative disorders (2), yet the mechanisms by which cells repair mtDNA damage and maintain the integrity of the mitochondrial genome remain incompletely understood.

Cultured cells lacking mtDNA have provided useful models for studying human mitochondrial diseases (3) and the regulation of proteins involved in mtDNA transactions (4,5). Many human cell lines can be rendered mtDNA-less (rho0) in culture by growth in the presence of low concentrations of the intercalating agent ethidium bromide (6). These cells lose their ability to respire, but meet their energy needs via anaerobic glycolysis, even though cultured at atmospheric oxygen concentrations. The mitochondria of rho0 cells maintain a membrane potential sufficient for import of nuclear-encoded proteins by coordinated action of the F1 ATPase and adenine nucleotide translocator, which together maintain the electrogenic exchange of ATP/ADP across the inner membrane (7,8). The gross morphology of mitochondria in rho0 cells is similar to that of wild-type cells, though swelling is often apparent in the former. rho0 cells maintain their responsiveness to many apoptotic stimuli (9), and divide at an only marginally slower rate (10). Thus, rho0 cells are a viable model for studying the impact of mtDNA-deficiency on cell biology.

Interestingly, some proteins involved in mtDNA maintenance and replication are apparently insensitive to the absence of mtDNA. Polymerase gamma, the sole mtDNA polymerase, continues to be expressed and localizes to mitochondria in rho0 cells (9). In contrast, expression of mitochondrial transcription factor A (mtTFA), involved in mtDNA packaging and transcriptional activation, is profoundly depressed in rho0 cells. Levels of this protein strongly correlate with mtDNA amount (5).

It is not known to what extent the proteins involved in maintaining mtDNA integrity are sensitive to mtDNA levels, damage, or indeed to the absence of mtDNA. Here, we have developed the use of rho0 cells as an experimental model with which to study aspects of the organization and regulation of mitochondrial BER. Through these investigations, we have identified possible key regulatory steps in the BER pathway for repair of mtDNA, as well as aspects of mitochondrial BER regulation. We have also investigated the effect of rho0 status on nuclear BER activities.

mtDNA-less (rho0) 143B TK- human osteosarcoma cells (ATCC CRL 8303) were a generous gift from Guiseppe Attardi (California Institute of Technology). Wild-type (wt) 143B TK- cells were acquired from the American Type Cell Collection (ATCC). wt and rho0 cells were cultured under identical conditions, in a humidified 5% CO2 atmosphere in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Medium, supplemented with penicillin/streptomycin, 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 microg/ml pyruvate, 100 microg/ml BrdU and 50 microg/ml uridine.

The mtDNA content of wt and rho0 cells lines was determined essentially as in (4). Briefly, total DNA was prepared from approximately105 wt or rho0 cells. PCR amplification of a portion of the Leu tRNA gene of the mitochondrial genome and the trinucleotide repeat region of the DNA polgamma gene were done at the same time. The PCR mixture contained 200 microM dNTPs, 10 microCi [alpha-32P]dCTP (3000 Ci/mmol), 5 pmol primers (5'-AGCGACGGGCAGCGGCGGCGGCA-3' and 5'-CCCTCCGAGGATAGCACTTGCGGC-3' for nuclear encoded DNA pol gamma gene and 5'-GATGGCAGAGCCCCGGTAATCGC-3' and 5'-TAAGCATTAGGAATGCCATTGCG-3' for mtDNA encoded tRNA Leu gene), 20 ng total DNA and 0.5 U Taq DNA polymerase. Reaction mixtures were incubated at 95degreesC for 3 min followed by 30 cycles of 95degreesC for 1 min, 50degreesC for 1 min and 72degreesC for 1 min. The reaction was completed by a final incubation at 72degreesC for 5 min. PCR products were loaded onto an 8% native polyacrylamide gel and electrophoresed at 200 V for 1 h 50 min, then visualized by Phosphor Imager.

Cells were washed twice in PBS and then resuspended in 7 ml of homogenization buffer [MSHE; 210 mM mannitol, 70 mM sucrose, 10 mM HEPES (pH 7.4), 1 mM EGTA, 2 mM EDTA, 0.15 mM spermine, 0.75 mM spermidine, 1 mM dithiothreitol (DTT)], with the following protease inhibitors added immediately prior to use: 1 microg/ml chymostatin, 2 microg/ml leupeptin, 2 microM benzamide, 1 microM E-64 and 1 mM PMSF. Cells were homogenized with a Potter-Elvejhem glass/glass homogenizer. The homogenate was centrifuged at 500 g for 12 min. The supernatant was transferred to a new tube and centrifuged at 10 000 g for 10 min. The pellet was homogenized and centrifuged a second time. The 10 000 g pellets (crude mitochondrial fraction) were combined. The 500 g pellet (nuclear fraction) was frozen at -80degreesC. The combined 10 000 g pellets were layered onto a 1:1 Percoll/2x MSHE gradient and centrifuged at 50 000 g for 1 h 10 min. The mitochondrial layer, in the middle of the gradient, was collected and washed twice in homogenization buffer, then resuspended in 300 microl MSHE. Protein concentration was determined using the Bio-Rad assay (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA) using bovine serum albumin as standard, and mitochondrial fractions were stored at -80degreesC.

OGG1 activity was measured as incision of 8-oxo-deoxyguanine (8-oxodG) from a 28mer oligonucleotide essentially as in (14). Ten microliter reactions contained 40 mM HEPES (pH 7.6), 5 mM EDTA, 1 mM DTT, 75 mM KCl, 10% glycerol, 88.8 fmol of oligonucleotide and 10 microg mitochondrial or 3.5 microg WCE protein. Reactions were incubated for 4 h (mitochondria) or 2 h (WCEs) at 32degreesC then terminated by adding 5 microg of proteinase K (PNK) and 1 microl of 10% SDS and incubating at 55degreesC for 30 min. DNA was precipitated by addition of 1 microg glycogen, 4 microl of 11 M ammonium acetate, 60 microl of ethanol and overnight incubation at -20degreesC. Samples were centrifuged, dried and suspended in 10 microl of formamide loading dye.

Repair synthesis of a uracil-containing double-stranded oligonucleotide was measured essentially as described (15). Reactions contained 10 microg of mitochondrial protein in 10 microl of reaction buffer (40 mM HEPES, 0.1 mM EDTA, 5 mM MgCl2, 0.2 mg/ml BSA, 50 mM KCl, 1 mM DTT, 40 mM phosphocreatine, 100 microg/ml phosphocreatine kinase, 2 mM ATP, 40 microM dNTPs, 4 microCi [alpha-32P]dCTP, 3% glycerol) and 120 ng of oligonucleotide substrate. Complementation of uracil-initiated BER assays was done as above, but 5 microg mitochondrial protein and addition of pure proteins as indicated. The polymerase gamma gap-filling assay was also done using the above conditions, but with 0.5 or 2.0 microg mitochondrial protein. Uracil-initiated BER with the 34U oligonucleotide (Table 1) was assayed essentially as above, but with 2.5 microg mitochondrial protein, 10 microM dCTP and no other dNTPs. Reactions were incubated for 1 h at 37degreesC (2 h at 37degreesC for complementation and 34U repair experiments) and terminated by addition of 5 microg PNK and 1 microl of 10% SDS followed by incubation at 55degreesC for 30 min. DNA was precipitated as described above, suspended in 10 microl formamide loading dye, heated at 90degreesC for 10 min and electrophoresed and visualized as above. Uracil-initiated BER activities were quantified by comparing rho0 repair product signal intensity with that of wt (100%).

The absence of mtDNA in rho0 cells was verified by PCR amplification of mtDNA- and nuclear DNA-encoded nucleotide sequences in wt and rho0 143B TK- cells. The PCR products of nuclear-encoded polymerase gamma were present in both wt and rho0 cells, and the tRNA-leu product was present in wt cells, but absent in rho0 cells (not shown), confirming the presence of nuclear DNA but absence of mtDNA in the rho0 cells. mtTFA, which correlates strongly with mtDNA amount (5) and is used as a marker of mtDNA levels, was also absent in mitochondria isolated from rho0 cells (Fig. 1a).

In all mitochondrial preparations, contamination with nuclear proteins was assessed by western blot detection of Lamin B2, a protein that is abundant in the nucleus. Lamin B2 was readily detected in nuclear fractions, but absent in mitochondrial fractions loaded at identical levels (60 microg), indicating that mitochondria isolated from the wt and rho0 cells contained no significant nuclear contamination (Fig. 1b). To assess the comparative enrichment of wt and rho0 mitochondrial fractions for mitochondrial proteins (i.e. the proportional abundance of mitochondrial proteins versus cellular contaminants), we measured the activity of CS, a tricarboxylic acid cycle protein present in the mitochondrial matrix. The specific activity of CS was marginally higher in rho0 mitochondrial fractions relative to wt (not shown), indicating that enrichment of the fraction for mitochondria was at least as great in rho0 preparations as in wt. CS activity measured in WCEs was also similar in wt and rho0 cells (not shown), which validates this use of CS activity to gauge mitochondrial enrichment.

mtDNA repair protein activities were determined individually using in vitro assays in which mitochondrial lysates were incubated with oligonucleotide substrates containing specific lesions at defined positions (Table 1). Where possible, protein levels were also determined by western blot. All mtDNA repair proteins and activities examined were present in rho0 cells, although generally at reduced levels (Figs 2 and 3). The magnitudes of differences in BER protein levels between wt and rho0 were highly dependent upon the individual protein. DNA glycosylase activities (UDG, OGG1) were only slightly reduced in rho0 mitochondria. UDG activity, measured as incision of ssU, was about 25% lower in rho0 mitochondria relative to wt (Fig. 2a and b). OGG1 activity, measured as incision of an 8-oxodG-containing oligonucleotide (OG), was also about 25% lower in rho0 mitochondria (Fig. 2c).

In contrast, mitochondrial AP endonuclease activity and APE1 protein levels were much more affected by the absence of mtDNA. Mitochondrial AP endonuclease activity was assayed as incision of an oligonucleotide containing a THF abasic site analog (Table 1). Figure 3a shows a representative gel with the migration of substrates and products as indicated by the arrows. Incision activity in rho0 mitochondria was approximately 65% lower than in wt (Fig. 3b). Though it has not been clearly established that APE1 is the major mitochondrial AP endonuclease, a reduction in APE1 protein levels was seen in rho0 mitochondria (Fig. 3c), indicating good agreement between AP endonuclease activity and APE1 protein.

mtDNA polymerase gamma, as the only mtDNA polymerase in human cells, is an essential component of the BER pathway. Polymerase gamma gap-filling activity was measured using an assay that monitored [32P]dCTP incorporation into an oligonucleotide containing a single nucleotide gap with processed 5' and 3' termini (GAP oligo, Table 1). To ensure that a possible deficiency in mtDNA ligase activity would not limit the nucleotide incorporation activity of polymerase gamma, exogenous pure T4 DNA ligase was added as indicated. Figure 3d shows a representative gel in which the 21mer unligated intermediate and the ligated full-length 39mer can be discerned. Polymerase gamma activity was quantified both by measuring signal intensity of the 21mer and 39mer (-T4 ligase), and by measuring only the signal intensity of the 39mer (+T4 ligase). The graph in Figure 3e shows the mean signal intensities using the latter method. Polymerase gamma activity was approximately 45% lower in rho0 mitochondria, compared to wt. Comparison of the sum of 21mer and 39mer bands between wt and rho0 mitochondria produced a similar result (not shown).

The mitochondrial BER pathway requires the coordinated activities of at least four proteins, a glycosylase, an AP endonuclease, polymerase gamma and DNA ligase III (16). We assessed the overall activity of the BER pathway in mitochondrial lysates using a uracil-initiated BER assay where [32P]dCTP incorporation into a double-stranded oligonucleotide containing a single uracil at position 12 in the sense strand (dsU; Table 1) was monitored. In this assay, following uracil removal, processing of the abasic site and [32P]dCTP incorporation, ligation of the incised strand occurs at a relatively slow rate in vitro, with almost all [32P]dCTP signal being detected in the 12mer polymerase product, and virtually no detectable ligated 30mer. The representative gel in Figure 4a shows the 12-nucleotide intermediate of [32P]dCTP incorporation without ligation. Comparisons of nucleotide incorporation were made by quantifying the [32P]dCTP signal in the 12mer. The uracil-initiated BER activity of rho0 mitochondria was approximately 60% less than that of wt (Fig. 4b).

The activities of AP endonuclease and uracil-initiated BER were reduced by similar amounts in rho0 mitochondria relative to wt, which suggested that AP endonuclease may play a central role in reducing BER flux. This hypothesis was tested by complementing rho0 uracil BER assays with exogenous recombinant APE1. If AP endonuclease catalyzed the rate-limiting step in mitochondrial BER, restoration of this activity by addition of pure APE1 should have restored wt BER activity. However, additions of 0.1-5.0 pmol APE1 failed to stimulate uracil-initiated BER activity in rho0 mitochondria (Fig. 5), though the protein was highly active in this range in other assays (for example, see Fig. 3). Thus, reduced AP endonuclease activity did not appear to limit BER pathway activity in rho0 mitochondria.

We used a similar approach to assess other possible site(s) of BER pathway flux reduction in rho0 mitochondria. Supplementation of the uracil-initiated BER assay with 0.2 or 1.0 U of pure UDG stimulated BER activity, though only by approximately 20%, and in both wt and rho0 mitochondria (Fig. 5). However, uracil-initiated BER activity of rho0 mitochondria remained well below wt levels. When pure polymerase gamma catalytic subunit was added to the BER assay, we observed considerable extension activity, in both wt and rho0 mitochondria, complicating the interpretation of results. We therefore used a different uracil-containing oligonucleotide (34U; Table 1), and eliminated dNTPs other than dCTP from this assay. Complementation with polymerase gamma increased the amount of full-length product in both wt and rho0 mitochondria (Fig. 6). Indeed, the amounts of ligated product were approximately equal in wt and rho0 mitochondria. However, the levels of 16mer, representing incorporation without ligation, remained much lower in rho0 mitochondria, relative to wt. Quantification of both bands in wt and rho0 mitochondria showed that polymerase gamma complementation did stimulate uracil-initiated BER activity in rho0 mitochondria, by about 100%, though this activity still remained well below wt levels.

Finally, we compared uracil-initiated BER activity in wt and rho0 mitochondria supplemented with UDG, APE1 and polymerase gamma catalytic subunit. Even with this simultaneous complementation of the first three steps in uracil-initiated BER, rho0 activity remained lower than wt (data not shown).

To confirm that differences in rho0 and wt mitochondrial BER were not simply due to general perturbations of nuclear BER in rho0 cells, we measured BER activities in WCEs. Mitochondrial volume density of cultured cells is very low (typically approximately3-5%), and mitochondria therefore make a negligible contribution to measurements of BER protein activities made in whole cells. We found that whole cell DNA glycosylase (OGG1 and UDG) activities were largely unaffected by the absence of mtDNA. OGG1 incision activity was approximately the same in wt and rho0 cells, and UDG activity was only 13% lower (Fig. 7). Similarly, OGG1 protein levels, measured by immunoblot of alphaOGG1 and betaOGG1 proteins did not appear to be different in WCEs of wt versus rho0 cells (Fig. 7a). The levels of other BER proteins, PCNA and polymerase beta were also not lower in rho0, relative to wt, cells. Indeed, DNA polymerase beta levels appeared to be slightly elevated in rho0 cells. Thus, there was no evidence of a general impairment of DNA repair in the rho0 cells.

In contrast, AP endonuclease protein levels and activities were significantly lower in rho0 cells. APE1 protein levels were visibly decreased, as determined by western blot (Fig. 8a), and AP endonuclease activity was approximately 25% (data taken at 30 min incubation time) lower (Fig. 8b and c). Interestingly, a more pronounced decrease in APE1 protein and AP endonuclease activities was found in nuclear extracts from rho0 cells, in which the reduction of AP endonuclease activity was about 65% (Fig. 8d-f).

Some mtDNA repair protein activities were generally reduced in rho0 WCEs, but their presence indicates that they continue to be synthesized and translocated into the mitochondrial compartment in the absence of mtDNA. This provides an opportunity to investigate the nature of BER protein regulation by oxidative stress. Specifically, APE1 has been reported to translocate to mitochondria in human cells after oxidative stress (17). We investigated whether this could be elicited in the absence of mtDNA, directly by reactive oxygen species (ROS), or whether mtDNA damage was necessary for the response. We addressed this issue by focusing on the mitochondrial activities of two proteins: APE1, which translocates to mitochondria following hydrogen peroxide exposure (17), and UDG, for which there is no evidence of an oxidative stress response. Cells were exposed to 250 microM H2O2 for 1 h, then either harvested immediately or allowed to recover in complete medium for 6 h before harvesting. Control cells were handled identically, but with no H2O2 treatment. Mitochondrial UDG activity showed an initial decline following H2O2 treatment in both wt and rho0 cells (Fig. 9a and b). At 6 h post-exposure, UDG activity in wt had recovered to control levels, but remained lower in rho0 mitochondria. On the other hand, H2O2 induced a substantial increase in mitochondrial AP endonuclease activity in both wt and rho0 cells (Fig. 9c and d). At 6 h post-exposure, mitochondrial AP endonuclease activity in wt cells was approximately 40% higher than in controls. AP endonuclease activity in rho0 mitochondria increased 3-fold at 0 h post-exposure, when rho0 AP endonuclease activity was approximately equal to that of wt. However, at 6 h post-exposure, rho0 AP endonuclease activity had declined and was approximately 50% lower than in wt mitochondria.

The effect of H2O2 exposure on BER proteins was examined in WCEs under the same experimental conditions. Whole cell levels of APE1 in rho0 cells were lower in control (untreated) cells and at 0 h following H2O2 treatment (Fig. 10a). However, at 6 h following exposure, APE1 protein in rho0 cells was approximately equal to wt levels. This was paralleled by an increase to wt levels of AP endonuclease activity in rho0 cells at 6 h post-exposure (Fig. 10b and c). Interestingly, UDG activity was also slightly increased in rho0 cells by H2O2 treatment (Fig. 10d and e).

The continued localization of DNA BER proteins to the mitochondria of cells lacking mtDNA indicates that the signals involved in maintaining basal constitutive levels of some of these proteins are independent of actual mtDNA. In this respect, the regulation of mtDNA BER proteins differs from that of some other proteins involved in mtDNA transactions. The expression and/or protein levels of mtTFA (4,5), mtRNA polymerase (5) and mitochondrial single-stranded DNA binding protein (mtSSB) (18) are all tightly regulated with respect to mtDNA levels. Indeed, in the absence of mtDNA, we were unable to detect mtTFA in mitochondria of rho0 cells by western blot.

mtDNA glycosylase activities were particularly insensitive to the absence of mtDNA, with UDG and OGG1 activities only about 25% lower in the mitochondria of rho0 cells, relative to wt. This apparent unresponsiveness to mtDNA status is consistent with the regulatory features of the OGG1 gene. The hOGG1 gene promoter lacks TATA or CAAT boxes, consistent with a housekeeping function (19). Indeed, OGG1 expression and enzyme activity are invariant during the cell cycle and not altered in response to oxidative stress (20). Mitochondrial UDG, on the other hand, has a dedicated promoter distinct from that used to express the nuclear isoform and the expression of both UDG isoforms is cell-cycle regulated, and highest in S-phase (21). It is therefore possible that the lower mitochondrial UDG activity of rho0 cells is related to their slower replication rate. Nonetheless, taken together, our results suggest that both DNA glycosylase activities in mitochondria are expressed largely constitutively and not tightly regulated with respect to either mtDNA amount or oxidative stress.

In contrast to the DNA glycosylase activities, other steps in the mitochondrial BER pathway were more significantly altered in the absence of mtDNA. The most substantial reductions observed were in AP endonuclease activity, APE1 protein levels and polymerase gamma activity in mitochondria of rho0 cells. This latter observation is particularly interesting in light of reports that polymerase gamma protein levels are unchanged in rho0 relative to wt mitochondria (4), and suggests a lower specific activity of polymerase gamma in rho0 mitochondria. This result may indicate that polymerase gamma gap-filling activity is not regulated exclusively by the amount of the catalytic subunit. Indeed, other factors including the polymerase gamma accessory subunit affect polymerase gamma's interaction with oligonucleotides (22,23). It is possible that, though the catalytic subunit is apparently present in rho0 mitochondria (24), it is in a non-optimal conformation that decreases its specific activity. The reason for this apparent discordance between polymerase gamma protein levels (4) and its measured gap-filling activity is not known, but may be interesting to investigate further.

While overall BER activity was substantially lower in rho0 mitochondria relative to wt, some individual activities were little affected. To identify those activities which contributed most significantly to the reduced BER pathway activity, we supplemented the in vitro BER assay with exogenous proteins. While supplementation with UDG or APE1 elicited marginal or no increases in BER activity, addition of the polymerase gamma catalytic subunit stimulated activity appreciably. Importantly, however, the amount of the fully ligated product, but not the 16 nucleotide incorporation product, was increased. This interesting result suggests that an activity associated with polymerase gamma limits the rate of the ligation step both in wt and rho0 mitochondria. It is likely that the dRp lyase activity of polymerase gamma, which immediately succeeds nucleotide incorporation and has a notably low kcat (25), is a limiting step in mitochondrial BER. The kcat for polymerase gamma dRp lyase is approximately 40-fold lower than that of DNA polymerase beta, which is similarly thought to be rate-limiting in nuclear BER (26). The fact that the amount of full-length, ligated product was equal in polymerase gamma-complemented wt and rho0 mitochondria further suggests that, under these conditions, DNA ligase activity becomes limiting and that the ligase activity is approximately equal in wt and rho0 mitochondria. Taken together, these data suggest a rate-limiting role for the polymerase gamma dRp lyase step in mitochondrial BER. These results support the hypothesis outlined above, that despite sufficient levels of the polymerase gamma catalytic subunit, its gap-filling activity in BER is reduced. Even a large excess of the catalytic subunit was unable to stimulate wt levels of BER activity.

Large differences in APE1 protein levels and activities were found between wt and rho0 cells, both in mitochondrial and in nuclear compartments. Our data suggest that low endogenous ROS production was the underlying cause. Regulation of APE1 by oxidative stress is well documented (27), and ROS affects both cellular APE1 protein levels and translocation of APE1 to the nucleus (28). rho0 cells, which lack mitochondrial respiration, the major endogenous source of ROS, have reduced levels of endogenous ROS (29-31). Here we have shown that they also have lower cellular, nuclear and mitochondrial levels of APE1. When we introduced oxidative stress to rho0 cells, APE1 levels and AP endonuclease activity increased rapidly (within 6 h) to wt levels, indicating that rho0 cells retain the ability to modulate APE1 in response to oxidative stress. While we did not study cellular APE1 regulation exhaustively in the present work, our data do suggest that rho0 cells may be a useful model with which to further investigate interactions between ROS and APE1.

AP endonuclease activity was the single most altered BER activity in the mitochondria of rho0 cells. APE1 protein levels appeared to be concomitantly reduced. However, it remains unknown whether APE1 is the major mitochondrial AP endonuclease, although our data favors this idea. Nonetheless, we used measurements of AP endonuclease activity to investigate ROS affects on mitochondrial AP endonuclease. H2O2 treatment increased mitochondrial AP endonuclease activity in wt cells by 40% relative to untreated cells, at 6 h following hydrogen peroxide treatment. This result is similar to that of Frossi et al. (17), who demonstrated ROS-induced translocation of APE1 into mitochondria in a human B lymphocyte cell line. Taken together, the data suggest that ROS-induced regulation of mitochondrial AP endonuclease is a general feature of mitochondrial BER in human cells. The significance of this phenomenon, especially given the failure of exogenous APE1 to stimulate uracil-initiated mitochondrial BER in vitro, is unclear.

In summary, mtDNA glycosylase activities were relatively insensitive to the complete absence of mtDNA, consistent with a constitutive and not tightly regulated expression of these proteins in mitochondria. Nonetheless, mitochondrial BER activity was substantially reduced in rho0 cells, although the reasons for this reduction are not completely clear. Moreover, while the addition of polymerase gamma catalytic subunit, and to a lesser extent UDG, stimulated BER activity, net BER activity in rho0 mitochondria could not be increased to wt levels. rho0 cells also had dramatically lower AP endonuclease protein levels and activities than wt cells, and our data are consistent with the interpretation that this phenomenon is due to lower endogenous oxidative stress in the absence of mitochondrial respiration in rho0 cells. The rho0 cells appear to be an interesting and useful model for identifying details of how mitochondrial respiration and mtDNA affect both mitochondrial and nuclear DNA damage and repair.
