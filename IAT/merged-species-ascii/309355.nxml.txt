An updated compilation of 300 E. coli mRNA promoter sequences is presented. For each sequence the most recent relevant paper was checked, to verify the location of the transcriptional start position as identified experimentally. We comment on the reliability of the sequence databanks and analyze the conservation of known promoter features in the current compilation. This database is available by E-mail.
