Transfer RNAGlu4 was isolated from Drosophila melanogaster by affinity chromatography. The tRNA was iodinated "in vitro" with Na[25I] and hybridized "in situ" to salivary gland chromosomes from Drosophila. Subsequent autoradiography allowed the localization of the genes for tRNAGlu4 to the right arm of the second chromosome and to the left arm of the third chromosome in the regions 52 F, 56 EF and 62 A.
