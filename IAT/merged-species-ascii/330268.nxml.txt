In Escherichia coli, two distinct lysyl-tRNA synthetase species are encoded by two genes: the constitutive lysS gene and the thermoinducible lysU gene. These two genes have been isolated and sequenced. Their nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequences show 79% and 88% identity, respectively. Codon usage analysis indicates the lysS product being more efficiently translated than the lysU one. In addition, the lysS sequence exactly coincides with the sequence of herC, a gene which is part of the prfB-herC operon. In contrast to the recent proposal of Gampel and Tzagoloff (1989, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 86, 6023-6027), the lysU sequence is distinct from the open reading frame located adjacent to frdA, although large homologies are shared by these two genes.
