A new species of micF RNA, which contains 93 nucleotides (a 4.5S size), was isolated from Escherichia coli. The sequence of the 4.5S micF RNA corresponds to positions G82 through U174 of the micF gene. The 5' terminal end of this smaller micF RNA is triphosphorylated signifying that it is a primary transcript. Its promoter region, which is situated within the greater micF structural gene, has been identified and characterized by lacZ fusion analysis. A 6S micF RNA species, which has a base composition predicted for a transcript from the full length gene has also been detected; however, the 4.5S micF RNA is the predominant species. The work clearly shows by biochemical identification the presence of chromosomally encoded micF RNA.
