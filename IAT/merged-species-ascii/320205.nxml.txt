The complete nucleotide sequence of the single-stranded RNA genome of human rhinovirus 14, one of the causative agents of the common cold, has been determined from cDNA cloned in E. coli. The genome is typical of the picornaviridae family, comprising a 5' non-coding region of 624 nucleotides, a long open reading frame of 6537 nucleotides (90.8% of the genome) and a 3' non-coding region of 47 nucleotides. Comparison of the nucleotide sequence and the predicted amino acid sequence with those of the polioviruses reveals a surprising degree of homology which may allow recognition of regions of antigenic importance and prediction of the virus polyprotein cleavage sites. The results presented here imply a closer genetic relationship between the rhinovirus and enterovirus genera than previously suspected.
