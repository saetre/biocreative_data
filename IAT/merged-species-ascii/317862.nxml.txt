The monoclonal antibody MOC-32 detected a 40 kDa protein in Western blot analysis. Immunological screening of an expression library of human SCLC cells with MOC-32 led to the isolation of overlapping cDNA clones. One of these, cHD4, was 1.0 kbp long and of about the same size as its corresponding mRNA. Preceded by an in phase stop codon, an open reading frame of 885 bp was present in cHD4 and a translational product of only 33 kDa could be calculated. Biochemical and immunological analysis established the relationship between the 40 kDa antigen and the isolated coding sequences and resolved the apparent discrepancy between the calculated molecular weight and the observed electrophoretic mobility. Nucleotide sequence comparison of cHD4 to the EMBL database revealed that cHD4 was nearly identical to a sequence claimed to encode a laminin binding protein. Southern blot and nucleotide sequence analysis indicated the presence of multiple copies of the gene in the human genome. At least five of these appeared to represent processed pseudogenes.
