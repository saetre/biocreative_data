An aryl sulfotransferase, whose cDNA was isolated from the rat liver library, was found to catalyze bioactivation of minoxidil through N-O-sulfation and N-sulfation of a carcinogenic heterocyclic amine, IQ, by expression in COS-1 cells. cDNA of a human ortholog also was isolated and characterized as a major minoxidil-activating enzyme in human liver. Another group of aryl sulfotransferases catalyzing O-sulfation of carcinogenic N-hydroxyarylamines was separated from livers of rats and humans. These sulfotransferases have been shown to possess similar functional properties and also to relate immunochemically with each other. Current understanding on the primary structure of these sulfotransferases also is discussed.
