The sequence of the Escherichia coli proC gene which encodes for delta 1-pyrroline-5-carboxylate (PCA) reductase was determined. Overproduction of the proC gene product via an expression plasmid carrying the bacteriophage lambda PL promoter allowed the purification to homogeneity of PCA reductase by affinity adsorption chromatography. NH2 and COOH-terminal analysis and amino acid composition of the purified proC protein is consistent with the gene sequence reported. The molecular weight of the proC monomer is 28,112.
