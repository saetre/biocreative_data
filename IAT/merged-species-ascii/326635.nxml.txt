Analysis of total chicken DNA by genomic blot hybridization indicates that only one cytochrome c gene exists in the chicken genome. The two alleles of this single cytochrome c gene have been isolated from a Charon 4A-chicken genomic library. This isolation made use of the yeast CYC1 cytochrome c gene as a specific hybridization probe. The 2 chicken alleles, CC9 and CC10, have been sequenced. The amino acid sequence predicted by these 2 alleles is identical, and agrees with the published chicken cytochrome c protein sequence. The flanking regions of these 2 alleles exhibit approximately 1% divergence, indicating a very limited polymorphism. Comparative sequence analysis with the flanking regions of previously isolated cytochrome c genes (yeast and rat) indicate no significant regions of homology. The presence of only one cytochrome c-like sequence in the chicken genome is in striking contrast with mammalian genomes, which contain as many as 20-30 cytochrome c-like sequences.
