Double-stranded cDNA of alfalfa mosaic virus (AlMV) RNA 1 has been cloned and sequenced. From clones with overlapping inserts, and other sequence data, the complete primary sequence of the 3644 nucleotides of RNA 1 was deduced: a long open reading frame for a protein of Mr 125,685 is flanked by a 5'-terminal sequence of 100 nucleotides and a 3' noncoding region of 163 nucleotides, including the sequence of 145 nucleotides the three genomic RNAs of AlMV have in common. The two UGA-termination codons halfway RNA 1, that were postulated by Van Tol et al. (FEBS Lett. 118, 67-71, 1980) to account for partial translation of RNA 1 in vitro into Mr 58,000 and Mr 62,000 proteins, were not found in the reading frame of the Mr 125,685 protein.
