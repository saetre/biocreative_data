Hepatic Nuclear Factor 1 (HNF1, also referred to as LFB1, HP1 or APF) is a liver-specific transcription factor required for the expression of many hepatocyte specific genes. We report here the purification of this rat liver nuclear protein and the cloning of its cDNA using a PCR-derived approach. Seven independent clones reveal 3 alternative polyadenylation sites and a unique open reading frame. Both a motif homologous to the homeodomain and a distal dimerization domain are required for specific DNA binding. Sequence comparisons reveal several atypical features at key positions in the segment corresponding to helices III and IV of the Antaennapedia homeodomain as well as a potential 24 amino acid loop in place of the universal turn between helices II and III. Together with its property to dimerize in the presence or absence of DNA, these features place HNF1 as the prototype of a novel subclass of transcription factors distantly related to homeoproteins.
