delta-Catenin is a unique member of beta-catenin/armadillo domain superfamily proteins and its primary expression is restricted to the brain. However, delta-catenin is upregulated in human prostatic adenocarcinomas, although the effects of delta-catenin overexpression in prostate cancer are unclear. We hypothesized that delta-catenin plays a direct role in prostate cancer progression by altering gene profiles of cell cycle regulation and cell survival.

We employed gene transfection and small interfering RNA to demonstrate that increased delta-catenin expression promoted, whereas its knockdown suppressed prostate cancer cell viability. delta-Catenin promoted prostate cancer cell colony formation in soft agar as well as tumor xenograft growth in nude mice. Deletion of either the amino-terminal or carboxyl-terminal sequences outside the armadillo domains abolished the tumor promoting effects of delta-catenin. Quantitative RT2 Profilertrade mark PCR Arrays demonstrated gene alterations involved in cell cycle and survival regulation. delta-Catenin overexpression upregulated cyclin D1 and cdc34, increased phosphorylated histone-H3, and promoted the entry of mitosis. In addition, delta-catenin overexpression resulted in increased expression of cell survival genes Bcl-2 and survivin while reducing the cell cycle inhibitor p21Cip1.

Tumor progression is the result of loss of balance in cellular functions including cell growth, adhesion, division and apoptosis. Among the many oncogenes and tumor suppressors, cell-cell junction associated proteins, such as beta-catenin and adenomatous polyposis coli (APC), contribute to cancer development by disrupting the E-cadherin based cell-cell junction, as well as interfering with cell proliferation, altering karyotype, and reducing apoptosis [1,2].

delta-Catenin, or NPRAP (neural plakophilin related armadillo protein)/Neurojungin, is an adhesive junction associated protein [3,4], which was initially identified as a neural specific protein [5,6]. delta-Catenin belongs to the p120ctn subgroup in the armadillo/beta-catenin superfamily [5,7]. While beta-catenin and p120ctn are ubiquitously expressed in the body, delta-catenin distribution is principally restricted to the brain in healthy individuals. However, it has become increasingly clear that delta-catenin is expressed in a variety of cancers of peripheral tissues, including breast, prostate, and esophageal tumors [8,9]. Recently, we showed that delta-catenin is upregulated in over 80% of prostatic adenocarcinomas, and its expression is correlated with increasing Gleason scores [9]. An increased expression of delta-catenin is accompanied by reduced E-cadherin and p120ctn in primary prostatic adenocarcinomas, and the forced overexpression of delta-catenin in cultured prostate cancer cells can induce the redistribution of E-cadherin and p120ctn [9]. While it is established that cell-cell junction proteins, such as E-cadherin, beta-catenin, APC, and p120ctn, are involved in cell adhesion and motility as well as cancer cell growth [1,2,10,11], it is not clear whether delta-catenin overexpression exerts any effects on prostate cancer cells.

In this study, we tested the hypothesis that delta-catenin plays a direct role in prostate cancer cell growth by altering gene profiles of cell cycle regulation and cell survival. We demonstrated, for the first time, that delta-catenin overexpression promotes anchorage-independent prostate cancer cell growth and tumor xenografts in nude mice. We determined that the ability of delta-catenin overexpression to promote prostate tumor xenograft growth is dependent on the amino- (NH2) and carboxyl- (COOH) terminal sequences flanking the armadillo repeat domains. In addition, quantitative RT2 Profilertrade mark PCR arrays revealed a wide range of gene alterations involved in cell cycle and survival regulation. These findings support the notion that at least one consequence of an increased delta-catenin expression in prostate cancer development is the alteration of cell cycle and survival gene profiles, thereby promoting tumor progression.

Our previous studies showed that delta-catenin expression is very weak in normal prostatic glandular epithelial cells but is remarkably increased in prostatic adenocarcinoma [9]. Screening for prostate cancer cell lines overexpressing delta-catenin, we found that delta-catenin expression was moderately increased in CWR22Rv-1 and PC-3 cells when compared to non-cancer prostate epithelial cells PZ-HPV-7 but remained very low in LNCaP and DU145 cells [12]. Therefore, CWR22Rv-1, derived from a recurrent human prostate cancer xenograft [13,14], and PC-3 cells, derived from a bone metastasis of prostatic adenocarcinoma [15], were chosen to test the hypothesis that the increase or decrease in delta-catenin expression affect prostate cancer cell growth, respectively.

We transfected delta-catenin cDNA with EGFP fusion into CWR22Rv-1 cells (Fig 1A). The stable cell lines were established by G418 selection followed by cell sorting to enrich for GFP emitting cell populations. This method allowed for the establishment of cell culture that contained almost 100% delta-catenin overexpressing cells. While vector transfected cells showed clear monolayer cell morphology (Fig 1A, a), delta-catenin overexpressing cells tended to form clusters (Fig 1A, d). This result was reminiscent of the disruption of cell monolayer morphology in MDCK kidney epithelial cells overexpressing delta-catenin [3]. Vector transfected cells, with GFP as the transfection marker uniformly distributed in the cells (Fig 1A, b; see insert), displayed E-cadherin at the cell-cell junction (Fig 1A, c; see insert). However, delta-catenin overexpression at the cell-cell junction (Fig 1A, e; see insert) showed disrupted E-cadherin distribution (Fig 1A, f; see insert).

A number of studies showed that disrupted cell-cell junction can alter cell growth [10,11]. To investigate the effects of delta-catenin expression in prostate cancer cells, we examined the growth property of CWR22Rv-1 cells stably overexpressing delta-catenin or stably suppressing delta-catenin expression (Fig 1B). To determine if the endogenous delta-catenin expression plays an important role in cell growth, stable cell lines expressing small hairpin RNAs (shRNAs) specific for delta-catenin gene were established and confirmed by Western blots (Fig 1B, a). Compared with vector transfected cells, delta-catenin overexpression showed a significant increase in cell numbers (Fig 1B, b, compare delta-catenin with vector). Compared with vector transfected cells, two independent shRNAs against different delta-catenin sequences reduced viable cell numbers (Fig 1B, b, compare vector 1 and 2 with shRNA 1 and 2).

To determine if the growth promoting effects of delta-catenin expression also applies to other cancer cell types, we examined PC-3 prostate cancer cells and NCI-H1299 cells derived from a human lung carcinoma [16]. Similarly, viable cell numbers were significantly increased in PC-3 and NCI-H1299 cells stably overexpressing delta-catenin (Fig 1B, c and 1B, d). These observations indicated that delta-catenin expression is important for cancer cell growth in culture.

To investigate whether delta-catenin overexpression promotes the anchorage-independent growth of prostate cancer cells, we performed soft agar assays. Following the plating of delta-catenin transfected and vector transfected CWR22Rv-1 cells in 0.6% top agar, cell colonies were scored after 1, 2, 3 and 4 weeks of incubation, respectively. The colony number of delta-catenin overexpressing cells increased more than 2 fold when compared to that of vector transfected cells during 1, 2 and 3 weeks (Fig 2A, compare delta-catenin with vector). The colony number as well as the colony size was decreased in both delta-catenin overexpressing cells and control cells by the 4th week, consistent with the literature that colony formation decreases after prolonged incubation [17]. This analysis revealed that delta-catenin overexpression promoted colony formation in soft agar.

To determine whether delta-catenin overexpression promotes tumor growth in vivo, we examined the effect of delta-catenin expression on the growth of CWR22Rv-1 tumor xenograft in nude mice. delta-Catenin overexpressing cells produced significantly larger tumors than that of the vector transfected cells (Fig 2B, n = 19). The volume of tumors derived from delta-catenin transfected cells increased steadily two weeks after inoculation and was nearly 2 fold when compared to that of tumors from control cells (Fig 2C, compare delta-catenin with vector). Similar results were observed when PC-3 and NCI-H1299 cells overexpressing delta-catenin were used for inoculating the nude mice (data not shown). Examination of tumor histology under fluorescent light microscopy showed that the majority of tumor volume contained green fluorescent cells, confirming that the tumors were indeed the result of proliferation and growth of inoculated CWR22Rv-1 vector transfected cells (Fig 2D, a and 2D, b) or cells overexpressing delta-catenin (Fig 2D, c and 2D, d), respectively.

While the armadillo domains of delta-catenin showed considerable homology to other beta-catenin/armadillo family proteins, the NH2- and COOH-terminal sequences flanking the armadillo repeat units are quite different among the different members of the family [5,7]. Therefore, we transfected delta-catenin cDNA with NH2-terminal (DeltaN280) or COOH-terminal (DeltaC207) deletions (Fig 3A, top panel) and established the respective cell lines showing stable expression (Fig 3A, bottom panel). While GFP protein was diffusely distributed in the nucleus and cytoplasm in CWR22Rv-1 cells (Fig 3B, a), full-length delta-catenin (Fig 3B, b), arrow) and DeltaN280 (Fig 3B, c, arrow) were similarly localized at the cell-cell junction. However, DeltaC207 was not associated with cell-cell junctions and remained mainly cytoplasmic (Fig 3B, d, arrow). This result was consistent with DeltaC207 distribution in NIH3T3 cells and in neurons [18,19]. When their growth in soft agar was compared, it became clear that compared to full-length delta-catenin, both DeltaN280 and DeltaC207 did not promote colony formation in soft agar (Fig 2A). In fact, DeltaC207 showed significant inhibition of forming cell colonies as compared to vector transfected cells (p < 0.05). Similarly, DeltaN280 and DeltaC207 did not show tumor promoting effects in nude mice (Fig 2C), although DeltaN280 and DeltaC207 did not show statistically significant inhibition of tumorigenesis when compared to vector control. These results supported the notion that delta-catenin sequences outside the armadillo domains are important for its tumor promoting activity.

To investigate if the effect of delta-catenin overexpression on the increase in viable cell number was to increase mitosis, we conducted experiments to compare the mitotic index of delta-catenin expressing cells with that of vector transfected cells. Cells entering mitosis show intense chromosomal staining with Hoechst 33258 dye highlighting different phases of cell division (Fig 4A, insert). Percentages of cells showing clear mitotic figures over the total number of cells were counted as mitotic index. This analysis showed that CWR22Rv-1 cells overexpressing delta-catenin had a significantly higher mitotic index (Fig 4A), consistent with increased entry to mitosis.

To independently confirm the increased mitotic index in delta-catenin overepressing cells, we analyzed phosphorylated histone-H3 immunolocalization (Fig 4B). Histone-3 is increasingly phosphorylated when cells pass G2 phase and enter mitosis. Control, vector transfected CWR22Rv-1 cells showed 3 +/- 0.20% cells with phosphorylated hisotne-H3 immuoreactivity (Fig 4B, a and 4B, b, arrows), whereas delta-catenin overexpressing cells showed a 7 +/- 0.32% phosphorylated histone-H3 activity (Fig 4B, c and 4B, b, arrows), supporting the notion that more delta-catenin overexpressing cells entered mitosis.

To further explore the potential molecular mechanisms underlying the delta-catenin mediated increase in prostate cancer cell viability, we investigated the gene expression patterns of cell cycle and survival. Compared to vector transfected cells, delta-catenin overexpression led to changes in a number of genes in these pathways. Notably, cell cycle regulatory genes such as cyclin D1 (CCND1) and cdc34 (CDC34), activation of which promotes G1 to S transition [20], showed more than a 2-fold increase (Fig 5A). Bcl2L1 (BCL2L1), the long isoform of Bcl2 involved in anti-apoptotic activation [21], increased by 3.84 fold. CSF2 (colony stimulating factor 2)/GM-CSF (granulate-macrophage colony stimulating factor), involved in tumor metastasis to the bone [22], showed a 3.34-fold increase (Fig 5A). ITGA7 (integrin alpha7) increased by 6.15 fold whereas other cell adhesion and matrix genes such as COL16A1 (collagen 16), ITGB3 (integrin beta3), MMP14, MMP15 and CTGF (connective tissue growth factor), each showed increases over 2 fold. One unique biochemical property within prostate epithelial cells is their dependence on glycolysis for energy production. HK2 (Hexokinase 2), involved in the increased rate of glycolysis seen in rapidly growing cancer cells [23], was increased 2.2-fold (Fig 5A). To confirm the validity of RT2 Profilertrade mark PCR Array, we selected cyclin D1, Bcl2L1, and HK2 genes to further study their changes in expression by real-time PCR (Fig 5B). Cyclin D1 showed an over 3-fold increase in expression, Bcl2L1 expression increased 1.5-fold, and HK2 turned in an over 2-fold increase in expression, in line with the array results (Fig 5A).

We also selected several protein markers to evaluate their potential involvement in the regulation of cell growth by delta-catenin overexpression. For example, while the total expression level of histone-H3 was similar in both vector and delta-catenin transfected cells (Fig 5C), histone-H3 phosphorylation was clearly elevated in delta-catenin overexpressing cells when compared to control cells, which supports the immunofluorescent light microscopic observations of increased mitotic activity in delta-catenin overexpressing cells (Fig 4B). Although Erk1/2 expression did not show any changes, the expression of survivin, a member of the inhibitor-of-apoptosis family known to be overexpressed by cancer cells, was increased in delta-catenin overexpressing CWR22Rv-1 cells when compared to control cells (Fig 5C). Cell cycle inhibitor p21Cip1 is a downstream effector of p53 mediated cell cycle interruption [24,25]. However, p21Cip1 expression in delta-catenin overexpressing cells was reduced when compared to vector transfected cells (Fig 5C). These results indicated that the effects of delta-catenin on cell viability could also be due to reduced cell death, in addition to an increased mitotic activity.

beta-Catenin/armadillo superfamily proteins are expressed in cells of all major tissue types including epithelial cells. They play important roles in cancer with some of its members as oncogenes while others act as tumor suppressors [1,2]. delta-Catenin (gene designation as CTNND2), however, is a unique member of the family because it is primarily expressed in the central nervous system of normal individuals. However, delta-catenin is now well established as being overexpressed in prostate cancer [9,26].

The frequently increased expression of the neuronal protein delta-catenin in peripheral prostate cancer tissue raised important questions such as what mechanisms are in place in cancer to result in a high level of delta-catenin expression. delta-Catenin gene amplification was observed in cervical cancer [27] and bladder cancer [28]. Transcription factor Pax6 was found to play an important role for regulation of delta-catenin expression in developing eye and central nervous system [29]. Recently, we showed that the ectopic overexpression of E2F1 and Pax6 positively upregulates delta-catenin expression in prostate cancer cells [12]. Furthermore, increased translation efficiency by somatic mutations in the 5'-untranslated region of delta-catenin was observed in prostate cancer patients [30], further supporting the hypothesis that cancer cells implement multiple mechanisms to upregulate delta-catenin expression to advance tumor progression. In this study, we provided the first evidence that delta-catenin is capable of promoting the expansion of prostate cancer cells, altering gene profiles of prostate cancer cell cycle regulation and survival.

Regarding cell proliferation and colonization, earlier studies evaluating MDCK cells transfected with delta-catenin showed that there were no significant differences between MDCK cells expressing delta-catenin and control cells [3]. Interestingly, ectopic expression of delta-catenin in NIH3T3 fibroblast cells inhibited cell division and induced cellular processes with branches [18]. However, delta-catenin overexpression in pheochromocytoma (PC12) cells increased cell proliferation and promoted neurite outgrowth when treated with nerve growth factor [31]. These studies, in addition to our current findings, suggest that delta-catenin effects on cell growth are context dependent. It is possible that preneoplastic cells may not tolerate high levels of stable delta-catenin expression, such as in MDCK cells [3], NIH3T3 cells [18], and mammary epithelial cells [32]. We have also failed to develop stable cell lines using PZ-HPV-7 (non-cancer human prostate epithelial origin) and NL20 (non-cancer human lung epithelial origin) cells (Zeng and Lu, unpublished data). However, in tumor cells, such as PC12, CWR22Rv-1, PC-3 and NCI-H1299, stable cell lines with delta-catenin overexpression were not only successfully produced, but also showed increased cell viability, suggesting that delta-catenin does not transform normal cells but promotes cancer cell expansion.

The armadillo repeating units reveal the most significant homology among beta-catenin superfamily proteins, while the sequences flanking the armadillo domain are quite variable [5,7]. This feature is consistent with the hypothesis that sequences outside the armadillo domains play important regulatory roles to characterize each different member. delta-Catenin interacts with classical cadherins through the armadillo domains, and the NH2- or COOH-terminal sequences on their own do not localize to cell-cell junctions [3]. In addition, the deletion of COOH-terminal 207 amino acids abolished the delta-catenin mediated process extension in NIH3T3 cells and compromised the roles of delta-catenin in promoting dendrite outgrowth in neurons [18,33,34]. Removing the NH2-terminal 280 amino acids also remarkably altered the effects of delta-catenin on 3T3 cell morphology [18]. In our present study, we showed that while the full-length delta-catenin promoted prostate cancer cell colony formation in soft agar and tumor xenograft growth in nude mice, delta-catenin with the deletion of either NH2-terminal 280 amino acids or COOH-terminal 207 amino acids lost its ability to promote tumor development. These studies underscore the importance of these sequences outside the armadillo domain to the functions of delta-catenin in cancer.

Gene profiling can provide initial indications of what may be the potential molecular pathways that delta-catenin employs to contribute to tumor progression. We identified a number of genes that displayed changes in expression when delta-catenin is overexpressed in prostate cancer cells. Several of these genes, such as cyclin D1, cdc34, Bcl2L1, and HK2, are especially interesting. Both cyclin D1 and cdc34 are involved in G1 to S transition, and Bcl2L1 is a long isoform of Bcl2 which protects cells from undergoing apoptosis [21]. HK2 phosphorylates glucose to produce glucose-6-phosphate, thus committing glucose to the glycolytic pathway. Expression of HK2 has been indicated in rapidly growing cancer cells [35,36]. Nevertheless, we still do not know how an increased delta-catenin expression affects these pathways in prostate cancer development. Our future studies will dissect the signaling events to determine the mechanisms by which delta-catenin employs to promote prostate cancer cell growth and tumor progression.

This study is the first to demonstrate the effects of delta-catenin overexpression in prostate cancer cells. We show that these effects rely on the delta-catenin domains outside armadillo repeating sequences, providing future direction for investigating the molecular basis of delta-catenin mediated prostate cancer development. Our studies suggest that an increased expression of delta-catenin in human prostate cancer permits the alteration of cell cycle and survival gene profiles, which may advance tumor progression.

To produce stable delta-catenin overexpressing cell lines, full length, NH2-terminal deleted (DeltaN280), or COOH-terminal deleted (DeltaC207) delta-catenin cDNA with or without pEGFP fusion [18] was transfected using FuGENE 6 (Roche Scientific, Gaithersburg, MD). CWR22Rv-1, PC-3 and NCI-H1299 cells transfected with pEGFP (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA) were used as a vector control. Stable cell lines transfected with untagged delta-catenin were established by selection using 250 mug/ml G418. For selection of pEGFP-delta-catenin transfected cells, cells were first selected in G418 containing medium. Then, pEGFP-delta-catenin trasnfected cells were further selected by GFP-based cell sorting using a FACS Vantage (BD Biosciences). The stable cell lines were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium containing G418.

Stably transfected cells were seeded and counted after 6 days in culture using a hemacytometer in at least three independent experiments. Trypan blue exclusion was used to determine viable cells for counting. To determine mitotic index, cells were either stained with Hoechst 33258 or immunostained with anti-phospho-histone H3. Following the incubation with Cy3trade mark-conjugated affinity purified secondary antibody (Jackson Laboratory, West Grove, PA), the coverslips were mounted using Antifade. At least 300~500 cells in 10 randomly selected fields were counted to determine mitotic figures or cells intensely labeled with anti-phosphorylated histone H3. Statistical analysis was performed using MS Excel and SigmaPlot (SPSS Science, Chicago, IL). Student t-tests or one-way ANOVA were conducted and p-values were assigned.

Male, athymic nude (nu/nu) mice (Charles River Lab, Wilmington, MA) were obtained and used at 4-8 weeks of age. Animals were kept under pathogen free conditions according to the guidelines of East Carolina University Animal Use Protocol. Animals were given subcutaneous injections of 4 x106 CWR22Rv-1 cells in RPMI 1640 medium plus cold Matrigel (BD Biosciences) or PC-3 cells in RPMI 1640 medium without Matrigel into the dorsal flank of nude mice. Once xenografts became established, their size was measured with a caliper once a week. The tumor volume was calculated by the formula: length x width x height x 0.5236 [37]. At the end of each experiment, animals were sacrificed and resulting final tumor volumes were determined.
