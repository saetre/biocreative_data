A phage containing two sequences homologous to U1 snRNA was isolated from a Drosophila melanogaster genomic library, and identified with a previously cloned D. melanogaster U1 snRNA gene. DNA sequence analysis showed that complete and truncated U1 snRNA genes are present, both of which have base substitutions relative to U1 snRNA. These genes show conservation of 5' and 3' flanking regions relative to other U1 and U2 snRNA genes of Drosophila. Intramolecular renaturation experiments and electron microscope mapping demonstrates that the two U1 snRNA sequences are present as inverted repeats about 2.7kb apart, separated by a smaller pair of inverted repeats of an unrelated sequence. These U1 snRNA sequences were located by in situ hybridization at 82E, and related sequences were found at 21D and 95C on the polytene chromosome map. The results are discussed with reference to the origin and function of snRNAs.
