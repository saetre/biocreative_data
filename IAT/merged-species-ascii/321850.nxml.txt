A long member of the highly repeated long interspersed DNA family L1Md (for L1 in Mus domesticus) has integrated by transposition into a target site which lies between the two adult beta globin genes of mouse. DNA hybridization and nucleotide sequence analysis show that this target site, which is part of the single copy DNA flanking the globin genes, is interrupted by the L1 element in one chromosome but is uninterrupted in both allelic and ancestral chromosomes. Other large DNA rearrangements of the region between the two adult beta globin genes are also associated with these allelic chromosomes, and include insertions or deletions of both single copy DNA and simple and complex repetitive DNA. This has caused extensive reorganization of this intergenic region. However, the distance between the two genes flanking this region remains conserved, suggesting that the spacing of the globin genes may be subject to conservative selection.
