ApoA-I is the major human HDL apoprotein. By oligonucleotide hybridization, we have isolated 5 dscDNA clones to human hepatic apo A-I mRNA. One of these clones (pA1-3) was completely sequenced. It has 878 bp plus a poly A tail of 48 and includes all the coding and 3'-untranslated regions of the mRNA and part of the 5'-untranslated region. It predicts a peptide sequence of 267 amino acids (including the 24 amino acid prepropeptides) which is very similar to the sequence reported by Brewer et al., (1978) Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 80:623-630. The predicted signal peptide sequence is highly homologous to the rat apoA-I signal peptide. There is no evidence for any internally repeated segments in apoA-I either at the amino acid or at the DNA level. Using pA1-3 as a probe, we have detected on Northern gels apo A-I mRNA sequences of approximately 1100 nucleotides in human hepatic and baboon hepatic and intestinal RNAs, but not in RNAs from baboon skeletal muscle, kidney or spleen. The demonstration of apo A-I mRNA sequences in specific organs is important to our concept of "reverse cholesterol transport".
