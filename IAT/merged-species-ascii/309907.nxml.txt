RAD50 function of Saccharomyces cerevisiae is required during vegetative growth for recombinational repair of DNA double strand breaks, and during meiosis for initiation of meiotic recombination and formation of synaptonemal complex. RAD50 encodes a 153 kDa polypeptide which includes an amino-terminal ATP binding domain essential for function and two long heptad repeat regions. We show below that RAD50 protein purified from yeast exhibits ATP-dependent binding to double stranded DNA. Physical properties of the purified protein are also described. Models for RAD50 function in vivo are discussed.
