Human ribosomal protein L7 inhibits cell-free translation in reticulocyte lysates and affects the expression of nuclear proteins upon stable transfection into Jurkat T-lymphoma cells.

Eucaryotic ribosomal protein L7 carries a 'Basic-Region-Leucine-Zipper (BZIP)'-like region which mediates high-affinity binding to mRNA and 28S rRNA and formation of homodimers [P. Hemmerich et al. (1993) Nucleic Acids Res. 21, 223-231). Its biological function is unknown as yet and no direct L7-equivalent in procaryotes has been found. In this report we show that eucaryotic L7 specifically inhibits the cell-free translation of reporter mRNAs. The interaction of L7 with mRNA is an essential step in this reaction which is inhibitable by antibodies directed against the BZIP-like region of L7, and by competitors of mRNA binding. L7-mediated inhibition of cell-free translation of polyA+ RNA from Jurkat T-lymphoma cells is selective in that the synthesis of a major 46 kD protein is suppressed. Upon stable transfection of L7 cDNA into Jurkat lymphoma cells two major proteins disappear, namely one nuclear protein and one which associates with the nucleus. Our data suggest a regulatory role of protein L7 in the eucaryotic translation apparatus.
