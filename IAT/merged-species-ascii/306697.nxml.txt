The genomic structure of the STAT genes: multiple exons in coincident sites in Stat1 and Stat2.

The genomic structure of Stat2 has been determined and compared with a large portion of the Stat1 gene. There are 24 exons in the Stat2 gene and a matching number in very similar positions in the Stat1 gene. Thus a very complicated genomic structure was presumably duplicated and has been closely maintained throughout evolution.
