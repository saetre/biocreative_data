The DNA sequence of the int and xis genes of lambda bacteriophage, as well as that of the PI promoter and a region of unknown function beyond this, was determined by the chain termination procedure. The Pribnow box sequence of the PI promoter lies just within the xis gene, and both possible sites of mRNA initiation from PI are within the xis gene. The end of the xis gene in its turn overlaps the start of the int gene by 23 base pairs, in a different reading frame. This overlap may play a role in ensuring efficient excision of the prophage in response to natural induction signals.
