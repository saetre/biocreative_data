The unwinding reaction catalyzed by the Escherichia coli Rep protein is stimulated by a small 15 kDa protein called Rep helicase stimulatory protein (RHSP)(1). The RHSP-stimulated unwinding reaction catalyzed by Rep protein proceeded at a rapid rate after a time lag of 1-2 min at 37 degrees C. This time lag was eliminated by preincubating RHSP with the DNA substrate, indicating that stimulation resulted from an interaction between RHSP and DNA. RHSP was shown to increase the rate as well as the extent of the unwinding reaction catalyzed by Rep protein. RHSP bound both single- and double-stranded DNA with apparent equal affinity, forming an unusually stable complex. Electron microscopy illustrated that the RHSP-DNA complex consisted of large protein aggregates bound to DNA forming a highly condensed, aggregated DNA-protein complex. The protein aggregates were not observed in the absence of DNA and appeared to form cooperatively in the presence of DNA. NH2-terminal amino acid sequence analysis suggested that RHSP was identical to E. coli ribosomal-protein L14. Binding assays showed that the interaction between RHSP and rRNA was similar to the RHSP-DNA interaction. Several models are put forth to explain the stimulation of the unwinding reaction catalyzed by Rep protein. In addition, the potential physiological significance of the RHSP-stimulated Rep protein unwinding reaction is discussed.
