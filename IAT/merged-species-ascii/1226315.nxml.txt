DNA polymerase (Pol) lambda is a member of the Pol X family and possesses four different enzymatic activities, being DNA polymerase, terminal transferase, deoxyribose phosphate lyase and polynucleotide synthetase, all localized in its C-terminal region. On the basis of its biochemical properties, Pol lambda has been implicated in various DNA repair pathways, such as abasic site translesion DNA synthesis, base excision repair and non-homologous end joining of double strand breaks. However, its role in vivo has not yet been elucidated. In addition, Pol lambda has been shown to interact with the replication clamp proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) in vitro and in vivo. In this work, we searched by affinity chromatography for novel partners and we identified the cyclin-dependent kinase Cdk2 as novel partner of Pol lambda. Pol lambda is phosphorylated in vitro by several Cdk/cyclin complexes, including Cdk2/cyclin A, in its proline-serine-rich domain. While the polymerase activity of Pol lambda was not affected by Cdk2/cyclin A phosphorylation, phosphorylation of Pol lambda was decreased by its interaction with PCNA. Finally, Pol lambda is also phosphorylated in vivo in human cells and this phosphorylation is modulated during the cell cycle.

Cell cycle progression is regulated by a family of cyclin-dependent kinases (Cdks) which phosphorylate and activate proteins that execute events critical to cell cycle progression. For activity, Cdks require association with a cyclin and phosphorylation by a Cdk activating kinase (CAK) at a conserved threonine residue (1). Each phase of the cell cycle is characterized by the expression of different Cdk/cyclin complexes that phosphorylate and regulate downstream substrates. In vertebrates, Cdk4/6/cyclin D complexes are active throughout the G1 phase, Cdk2/cyclin E at the G1/S boundary, Cdk2/cyclin A during S phase and Cdk1/cyclin A and Cdk1/cyclin B during the G2/M transition. Studies using knockout mice (2-4) revealed that neither Cdk2 nor cyclin E is essential for mitotic cell division. Cyclin E seems to be important for the control of endoreplication and for quiescent cells which re-enter in cell cycle. Furthermore, Cdk2 is essential in the regulation of the meiotic cell cycle, suggesting a novel tissue-specific function for cyclins and Cdks.

Human DNA polymerase (Pol) lambda belongs to the Pol X family based on sequence homology with Pol beta, Pol mu and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (5). Pol lambda contains a nuclear localization signal (residues 1-35), a BRCA1 C-terminal domain (BRCT, residue 36-132), a proline-serine-rich region (residues 133-243) and a Pol beta-like core region (residues 244-575). Pol lambda has been well characterized in vitro and it possesses four different enzymatic activities: DNA polymerase, terminal transferase, deoxyribose phosphate lyase and polynucleotide synthetase, all localized in its C-terminal region (6-8). On the basis of its biochemical properties, Pol lambda has been proposed to be involved in various DNA repair pathways, such as abasic site translesion DNA synthesis (9,10), base excision repair (11,12), repair of oxidative DNA damage (13) and non-homologous end joining of double strand breaks (DSBs) (14,15). In addition, Pol lambda has been shown to interact with the replication clamp proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) (9,16) and with the DNA repair protein ligase IV/XRCC4 (17). Mapping of Pol lambda interaction with PCNA identified a helix-hairpin-helix motif localized in its Pol beta-like core region (16). The major sites of interaction between PCNA and many of its partners are the interdomain connecting loop (ID-loop) (amino acids 121-132) and the facing hydrophobic pocket (amino acids 42-46) of PCNA (18,19). We have recently shown that residues 43-45 of the hydrophobic pocket are also essential for the interaction with Pol lambda (16). In addition, residues 125-128 of the ID-loop also play an important role in stabilizing this interaction (16). Furthermore, interaction of Pol lambda with PCNA has also been demonstrated in vivo (16,20). On the other hand, the in vivo role of Pol lambda is so far poorly understood. To better understand the Pol lambda function, we searched by affinity chromatography for novel partners. We identified the cyclin-dependent kinase Cdk2 as novel partner of Pol lambda. Pol lambda is a substrate for phosphorylation by several Cdk/cyclin complexes in vitro and its proline-serine-rich domain is the target of phosphorylation by Cdk2/cyclin A. Moreover, the phosphorylation of Pol lambda by Cdk2/cyclin A is decreased upon interaction of Pol lambda with PCNA. Finally, we demonstrated that Pol lambda is phosphorylated in vivo and this phosphorylation is regulated during the cell cycle.

HeLa cells were grown as monolayers in DMEM (Gibco) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Gibco), 10 microg/ml antibiotics (penicillin and streptomycin) at 37degreesC in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2. Synchronization of HeLa cells at the G1/S border was obtained by growing cells in 2 mM thymidine as described by Stein (23). After thymidine removal, cells were washed twice with PBS, harvested immediately (G1/S border) or were further cultured in complete medium for 3 h (S phase), 6 h (late S phase), 9 h (G2 phase) or 12 h (G2/M phase). Synchronization in M phase was obtained by growing cells in nocodazole (40 ng/ml) for 20 h. After nocodazole removal, cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), harvested immediately (M phase) or were further cultured in complete medium for 4 h (G1 phase). Cells were subsequently harvested and washed three times with PBS and were pelleted by low-speed centrifugation (250 g, 5 min, 4degreesC), and the cell pellets stored at -80degreesC until further use.

Phosphorylation was carried out in a final volume of 15 microl containing kinase buffer [50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mM MgCl2, 0.5 microM [gamma-32P]ATP (3000 mCi/mmol)], 66.6 microM ATP, in the presence of substrate (Histone H1 or His-Pol lambda) and 40 ng of purified Cdk/cyclin complexes. Reactions were carried out for 20 min at 37degreesC, and the proteins separated on a 10% SDS-PAGE. The gel was stained by Coomassie brilliant blue, dried and exposed to an X-ray film. The incorporation of [gamma-32P]ATP in Pol lambda polypeptide was determined by cutting out the band corresponding to Pol lambda after Coomassie staining, and by measuring the radioactivity by liquid scintillation counting. Background was determined by cutting out the band corresponding to Pol lambda incubated in the reaction mixture in the absence of Cdk/cyclin complex and subtracted from the obtained measurements. Pmols of incorporated radioactivity were calculated according to the specific activity of the [gamma-32P]ATP used in the assay.

HeLa cells were grown as previously described, washed once with ice-cold PBS, scraped off the dish and collected in ice-cold PBS. The cells were spinned down, the packed cell volume (PCV) was estimated and the cells were resuspended in 1 PCV of buffer [50 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 1% (v/v) Triton X-100, 0.5 mM PMSF, 2 microg/ml leupeptin, 1 microg/ml pepstatin and 1 microg/ml bestatin]. After incubation on ice for 15 min the samples were centrifuged for 10 min at 10 000 g at 4degreesC, and the supernatants kept as cell lysates. The phosphatase assay was carried out in a volume of 20 microl containing 25 microg of cell lysate, the lambda-phosphatase mixture (50 mM Tris-HCL, pH 7.5, 0.1 mM Na2EDTA, 5 mM DTT, 0.01% Brij 35 and 2 mM MnCl2) and 400 U of lambda-phosphatase (New England Biolabs). Incubation was at 30degreesC for 45 min. Two negative controls were added one without lambda-phosphatase and the other with lambda-phosphatase in the presence of the phosphatase inhibitors EDTA (5 mM) and Na3VO4 (1 mM). Then, 2x Laemmli buffer was added, the samples were heated at 90degreesC for 2 min and loaded on a 10% SDS-PAGE gel. The shift of the phospho-band was analyzed by western blot by using the corresponding antibodies.

First, we searched for novel partners of Pol lambda by affinity chromatography. His-Pol lambda or BSA were covalently bound on HiTrap NHS-activated Sepharose HP columns. Total extracts of HeLa cells were prepared as described in Materials and Methods and loaded in parallel onto the two affinity columns. Bound proteins were eluted successively by 150, 350 and 750 mM NaCl. The purification was carried out essentially by following the PCNA elution, a protein known to interact with Pol lambda in vitro (9) and in vivo (16). The elution profiles of BSA and Pol lambda are shown in Figure 1A. Proteins binding unspecifically were eluted in peak 1 at low NaCl concentrations from the Pol lambda and the BSA columns. Two additional peaks were exclusively present in the Pol lambda column elution. They contained proteins eluted at higher NaCl concentration, suggesting that they interact specifically with Pol lambda. The eluted fractions were tested by western blot by using different antibodies. We first confirmed that, as expected, PCNA specifically bound to the Pol lambda column (data not shown). Next, we found that the cyclin-dependent kinase Cdk2 was eluted in peak 2 (fractions 24-28) from the Pol lambda column (Figure 1B), whereas it bound only unspecifically to the BSA column (peak 1). We further confirmed this interaction in vitro by a His pull-down experiment. For this, GST-Cdk2 was incubated with His-Pol lambda bound to Ni-beads or with Ni-beads alone as a negative control (Figure 1C). Western blot analysis against Cdk2 showed a specific co-precipitation of Pol lambda with Cdk2, suggesting a direct interaction of these two proteins. Finally, the interaction was tested in vivo by immunoprecipitation. Anti-Cdk2 or control IgG bound to protein G-Sepharose was incubated with HeLa cells total extracts. After immunoprecipitation, western blot against Pol lambda showed that Pol lambda was co-immunoprecipitated with Cdk2 only when the anti-Cdk2 antibody was used (Figure 1D). In summary, these results indicate that Cdk2 can physically interact with Pol lambda in vitro and in vivo.

Next, we searched for potential Cdk phosphorylation sites in the amino acid sequence of Pol lambda. We found three serines (amino acids 167, 177 and 230, respectively) which could be part of consensus sites for Cdk phosphorylation. They are all located in the proline-serine-rich domain of Pol lambda. These sites are specific to Pol lambda, since they do not occur in the sequence of any of the other Pol X family members (Figure 2A). In order to verify whether Pol lambda could be a substrate for Cdk-dependent phosphorylation, kinase assays with different Cdk/cyclin complexes were performed in the presence of recombinant Pol lambda and [gamma-32P]ATP. As shown in Figure 2B, a [32P]labeled band of the expected molecular weight for Pol lambda appeared after incubation with the Cdk2/cyclin E, Cdk2/cyclin A and Cdk1/cyclin A complexes. Histone H1 was used as a positive control. The identity of the phosphorylated band with Pol lambda was confirmed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblot analysis (data not shown, and Figures 1D and 3B, left panel). In summary, these results suggest that Pol lambda is a target for phosphorylation by these three Cdk/cyclin complexes in vitro.

In order to map the phosphorylation domains of Pol lambda, kinase assays were performed by using deletion mutants of Pol lambda (illustrated in Figure 3A). Figure 3B (left panel) shows a Coomassie staining of the samples after the phosphorylation reaction separated by SDS-PAGE. The same gel was then exposed to an X-ray film to reveal the phosphorylated products. As shown in Figure 3B (right panel), Pol lambda, deleted for the BRCT domain, was still phosphorylated by Cdk2/cyclin A, whereas the mutant missing both the BRCT and proline-serine-rich domain was not. This result supported our findings that the three potential sites of phosphorylation are located in the proline-serine-rich domain (see Figure 2A) and suggested that this domain of Pol lambda is the target for Cdk2/cyclin A.

Furthermore, the effect of Pol lambda phosphorylation on its polymerase activity was tested. For this, His-Pol lambda was phosphorylated in vitro by Cdk2/cyclin A in the presence of ATP. Preliminary experiments showed that the degree of Pol lambda phosphorylation was between 56 and 84% considering that it can be phosphorylated on one to three sites (see Materials and Methods). This suggested that any effect due to phosphorylation of Pol lambda could be visualized by the sensitive method of product analysis. As negative controls, His-Pol lambda was either incubated in the presence of Cdk2/cyclin A without ATP, or in the presence of ATP without Cdk2/cyclin A. The Pol lambda polymerase activity was then tested on a 5'-labeled d17:d73mer primer-template and the elongation products were visualized on a polyacrylamide denaturating gel. DNA synthesis by Pol lambda was stimulated when it was incubated with ATP, either alone (lanes 7-9) or in combination with Cdk2/cyclin A (Figure 4A, lanes 1-3), compared with the reactions where ATP was omitted (lanes 4-6, lanes 10-12). Stimulation was greater when Pol lambda was incubated in the presence of ATP alone (lanes 7-9), suggesting that the observed stimulation was rather due to the presence of ATP than to phosphorylation. This effect could be explained by the fact that Pol lambda, similarly to Pol micro (24), is able to incorporate ribonucleotides opposite a DNA template (K. Ramadan and U. Hubscher, unpublished data). In this case, ATP could be used as a nucleotide substrate by Pol lambda, thus explaining the increased product elongation observed upon addition of ATP (Figure 4A, lanes 7-9). Moreover, the slight decrease in the effect of ATP in the presence of Cdk2/cyclin A may be due to its consumption occurring upon Pol lambda phosphorylation (Figure 4A, lanes 1-3). From these results, we concluded that phosphorylation of Pol lambda by Cdk2/cyclin A does not directly affect its polymerase activity. In addition, by testing the effect of phosphorylation on Pol lambda terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase activity, we showed that phosphorylation did not affect this activity (data not shown).

Since Pol lambda and PCNA have been shown to interact in vivo and in vitro (9,16), and PCNA is known to interact with Cdk/cyclin complexes (19), we next tested the effect of PCNA on phosphorylation of Pol lambda. Incubation of Pol lambda with PCNA during phosphorylation by Cdk2/cyclin A in vitro resulted in a decrease in Pol lambda phosphorylation (Figure 4B, upper panel). However, when the same experiment was performed by using the SHV43 PCNA mutant (18), no decrease of the Pol lambda phosphorylation was observed (Figure 4B, lower panel). In both cases, Pol lambda phosphorylation was abolished by addition of the specific Cdk inhibitor p21, confirming that phosphorylation was due to Cdk2/cyclin A. It has been shown that the PCNA mutant SHV43, in which the residues S43, H44 and V45 in the hydrophobic pocket on the C-side of the trimer were changed to A (18), is no more able to interact with Pol lambda (16) but can still bind Cdk2 (25). Thus, this result suggested that the physical interaction of PCNA with Pol lambda prevented phosphorylation by Cdk2/cyclin A, suggesting a possible regulation of the Pol lambda phosphorylation status via its interaction with PCNA.

Having shown that Pol lambda can be phosphorylated by Cdk/cyclin complexes in vitro, the next step was to test whether Pol lambda is phosphorylated during the cell cycle. For this, HeLa cells were synchronized at the G1/S transition by double thymidine block, and subsequently released in normal medium. Samples were collected at four different time points: 3 h (corresponding to mid-S phase), 6 h (late S phase), 9 h (G2 phase) and 12 h (G2/M phase). Synchronization in M phase was performed by treatment of the cells with nocodazole. Cells released in normal medium progressed in G1 phase and were collected after 4 h. Synchronization was confirmed on total extracts by western blot using antibodies against cyclin A, a specific marker of S and G2 phases of the cell cycle (Figure 5A, lower panel). A western blot against Pol lambda using cell extracts from synchronized cells revealed the presence of two forms of Pol lambda, represented by a faster and a slower migrating band, throughout the cell cycle. In S phase, the faster migrating band was more abundant, whereas in late G2 and M phases, only the slower migrating band could be detected (Figure 5A, upper panel). To verify that these two different forms of Pol lambda were due to phosphorylation, we treated a total extract of S phase HeLa cells with bacteriophage lambda-phosphatase. In the presence of the phosphatase only one form of Pol lambda was visible (Figure 5B, lane 1), corresponding to the faster migrating form, as revealed by comparison with reaction without phosphatase (lane 2) or in the presence of phosphatase inhibitors (lane 3), suggesting that Pol lambda is phosphorylated in vivo and that its phosphorylation status is modulated during cell cycle.

In our efforts to better understand the Pol lambda function, we searched for partners by affinity chromatography and we found Cdk2 as a novel interacting partner of Pol lambda. Analysis of the amino acid sequence of Pol lambda revealed the presence of three potential phosphorylation sites (S167, S177 and S230) for Cdk in its proline-serine-rich domain and we showed that this domain is the target of phosphorylation of Pol lambda by the Cdk2/cyclin A complex. This finding is not unexpected, since in other proteins proline-rich domains have been shown to be targets of post-translational modifications and to be involved in the regulation of protein function. Moreover, we found that Pol lambda is phosphorylated during the cell cycle and exists in two forms in S phase with a majority of hypophosphorylated form, whereas it is present exclusively in its hyperphosphorylated form from G2 to M phase (Figure 5). The different phosphorylation status of Pol lambda could be linked with different Pol lambda functions in vivo. Interestingly, Pol lambda is mainly present in the hypophosphorylated form in the S phase of the cell cycle when PCNA is also abundant. This is in agreement with our findings that the presence of PCNA reduces Pol lambda phosphorylation in vitro and suggests that this regulation may also happen in vivo.

In terms of physiological role, it has been shown that PCNA stimulated translesion synthesis of Pol lambda past an abasic site as it did for Pol iota, Pol kappa and Pol eta but by a different mechanism of interaction. Thus, it is tempting to speculate that the interplay among Cdk2/cyclin A, PCNA and Pol lambda, revealed by our study, might act in regulating the 'switch' between the replicative Pol delta an the translesion Pol lambda through direct competition for PCNA, yielding to elongation of the nascent DNA strand past abasic sites. This model was supported by the finding that Pol lambda interacts with PCNA at the same site as Pol delta and many other partners and that PCNA could promote bypass of abasic sites during DNA replication (9,16). Moreover, we showed that phosphorylation of Pol lambda does not influence its polymerase activity, suggesting that phosphorylation of Pol lambda rather regulates its interaction with cellular factors (e.g. PCNA) than its intrinsic activity.

In summary, our results allow to hypothesize that regulation of Pol lambda phosphorylation by PCNA during the cell cycle may be important in modulating the interaction of Pol lambda with other protein partners, or its recruitment to specific sites on chromatin. The effect of Cdk/cyclin phosphorylation on several replication proteins has been studied and seems to be specific for each protein [reviewed in (26)]. For example, phosphorylation has an inhibitory or stimulatory effect on the activity on Pol alpha depending on which Cdk/cyclin complexes phosphorylate it (27). In other cases, phosphorylation has been shown to regulate interaction between proteins, such as Fen 1 (28) or DNA ligase I (29,30), with PCNA. In addition, phosphorylation of replication protein A (RP-A) by Cdk1/cyclin A and Cdk1/cyclin B in late S phase leads to the dissociation of the RP-A trimer (31).

The interaction between Cdk2 and Pol lambda also fits with the proposed role of Pol lambda in non-homologous end joining (14,15). In fact, Cdk2 has been recently shown to regulate DNA DSB repair when associated to cyclin A1. Cyclin A1 is a second A-type cyclin abundantly expressed in testis (32,33). Since Pol lambda is also known to be abundant in testis (34) one could propose a role of Pol lambda in DSB repair in germ cells. Additional observations of Cdk2 localization at the telomeric ends of chromosome from leptotene to diplotene stage of meiosis (35) could support a role of Pol lambda by its terminal transferase activity (7) in germ cells. In addition, our data are supported by the recent findings that Pol lambda is selectively involved in NHEJ processing DNA with complementary overhangs, which occur upon DNA damage, whereas Pol micro seems to be mainly involved in NHEJ of DNA with non-complementary ends (36). In this context, phosphorylation of Pol lambda may be one of the factors influencing selectively the recruitment of Pol lambda on places where its activity is needed.

Cells were harvested immediately after nocodazole removal (M phase) or further cultured in complete medium for 4 h (G1 phase). The cells were lysed in 500 microl Laemmli buffer and 20 microl extract were loaded on a 7.5% SDS-PAGE and analyzed by western blot with antibodies against cyclin A, Pol lambda and alpha-tubulin, respectively. alpha-tubulin was used as loading control. (B) Aliquots containing 25 microg of total extract from HeLa cells synchronized in S phase were treated with or without 400 U of bacteriophage lambda-phosphatase for 45 min at 30degreesC. The reaction was stopped by adding Laemmli buffer and the samples were loaded on a 7.5% SDS-PAGE and analyzed by western blot with antibodies against Pol lambda and tubulin.
