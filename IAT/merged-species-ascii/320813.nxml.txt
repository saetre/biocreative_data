We report 67.8 MHz carbon-13 spin-lattice relaxation studies on [4-13C-uracil] labeled tRNAIVal purified from E. coli SO-187. Following 13C-enriched C4 carbonyl resonances from modified and unsubstituted uridines scattered throughout the polymer backbone enables us to determine dynamical features in both loop and helical stem regions. The experimental results have been analyzed in terms of a model of isotropic overall molecular reorientation. "Anomalous" residues for which the experimental data cannot be accounted for in terms of the model provide an assessment of local and regional properties. Thus, "native" tRNAIVal under physiological conditions of magnesium (10 mM) and temperature (20 degrees - 40 degrees C), exhibits the following characteristics: 1) uridines held rigidly in helical stems and tertiary interactions display correlation times for rotational reorientation of 15-20 nsecs, typical for overall tRNA motion; 2) uridines in loops such as the wobble residue uridine-5-oxyacetic acid (V34) are quite accessible to solvent; moreover V34 and another loop residue, D17, exhibit local mobility; 3) the tertiary interactions involving 4-thio uridine (s4U8) and A14 and ribothymidine (rT54) and A58 are weakened as temperature increases.
