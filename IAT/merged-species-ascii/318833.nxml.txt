We have characterised an Alu-like repetitive element found about 400 bp upstream of the gene encoding the C3 component of rat prostatic steroid binding protein and suggest, from comparisons with other published sequences, that it is an example of a third class of rodent Alu-equivalent sequences. Members of this class are 80-90 bp long, share greater than 90% sequence homology, and contain sequences resembling the RNA polymerase III bipartite promoter. The Alu type III element within the C3 gene was found to be expressed in cell-free systems and within heterologous cells stably transfected with the C3 gene, but these transcripts were not detectable in rat ventral prostate. It therefore seems unlikely that expression of this sequence plays a role in expression from the adjacent C3 gene.
