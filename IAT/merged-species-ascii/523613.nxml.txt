The previously uncharacterized determinants of the specificity of tRNAPro for aminoacylation (tRNAPro identity) were defined by a computer comparison of all Escherichia coli tRNA sequences and tested by a functional analysis of amber suppressor tRNAs in vivo. We determined the amino acid specificity of tRNA by sequencing a suppressed protein and the aminoacylation efficiency of tRNA by examining the steady-state level of aminoacyl-tRNA. On substituting nucleotides derived from the acceptor end and variable pocket of tRNAPro for the corresponding nucleotides in a tRNAPhe gene, the identity of the resulting tRNA changed substantially but incompletely to that of tRNAPro. The redesigned tRNAPhe was weakly active and aminoacyl-tRNA was not detected. Ethyl methanesulfonate mutagenesis of the redesigned tRNAPhe gene produced a mutant with a wobble pair in place of a base pair in the end of the acceptor-stem helix of the transcribed tRNA. This mutant exhibited both a tRNAPro identity and substantial aminoacyl-tRNA. The results speak for the importance of a distinctive conformation in the acceptor-stem helix of tRNAPro for aminoacylation by the prolyl-tRNA synthetase. The anticodon also contributes to tRNAPro identity but is not necessary in vivo.
