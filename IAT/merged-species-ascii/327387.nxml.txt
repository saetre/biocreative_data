We have determined the complete sequence of the human growth hormone (hGH) gene and the position of the mature 5' end of the hGH mRNA within the sequence. Comparison of this sequence with that of a cloned hGH cDNA shows that the gene is interrupted by four intervening sequences. S1 mapping shows that one of these intervening sequences has two different 3' splice sites. These alternate splicing pathways generate hGH peptides of different sizes which are found in normal pituitaries. Comparison of sequences near the 5' end of the hGH mRNA with a similar region of the alpha subunit of the human glycoprotein hormones reveals an unexpected region of homology between these otherwise unrelated peptide hormones.
