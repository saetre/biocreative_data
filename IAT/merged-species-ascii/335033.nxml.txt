Two variants of the 5S RNA of E. coli have been examined by imino proton NMR spectroscopy, one of them a deletion of A66 (Christiansen, J., Douthwaite, S.R., Christensen, A. and Garrett, R.A. (1985) EMBO J. 4, 1019-1024) and the other a replacement of A66 with a C (Goringer, H.U. and Wagner, R. (1986) Biol. Chem. Hoppe-Seyler 367, 769-780). Both are of interest because the role the bulged A in helix II of 5S RNA is supposed to play in interactions with ribosomal protein L18. The data show that the structural perturbations that result from these mutations are minimal, and assign the resonances of some of the imino protons around position 66. Some mutations at or near position 66 greatly reduce the L18-dependent increase in the circular dichroism of 5S RNA at 267 nm first observed by Bear and coworkers (Bear, D.G., Schleich, T., Noller, H.F. and Garrett, R.A. (1977) Nucl. Acids Res. 4, 2511-2526).
