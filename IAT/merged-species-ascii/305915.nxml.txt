In Xenopus laevis four estrogen-responsive genes are expressed simultaneously to produce vitellogenin, the precursor of the yolk proteins. One of these four genes, the gene A2, was sequenced completely, as well as cDNAs representing 75% of the coding region of the gene. From this data the exon-intron structure of the gene was established, revealing 35 exons that give a transcript of 5,619 bp without the poly A-tail. This A2 transcript encodes a vitellogenin of 1,807 amino acids, whose structure is discussed with respect to its function. At the nucleic acid as well as at the protein level no extensive homologies with any sequences other than vitellogenin were observed. Comparison of the amino acid sequence of the vitellogenin A2 molecule with biochemical data obtained from the different yolk proteins allowed us to localize the cleavage products on the vitellogenin precursor as follows: NH2 - lipovitellin I - phosvitin (or phosvette II - phosvette I) - lipovitellin II - COOH.
