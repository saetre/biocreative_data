The nucleotide sequence of the chicken myb proto-oncogene putative promoter region was determined and compared with the corresponding sequence of the mouse c-myb gene (1). 118 bp upstream from the initiation codon suggested by Gerondakis and Bishop (2) for the chicken c-myb protein, a 124-bp-long conserved element was found (92% identity in chicken and mouse sequences). Sequences homologous to this element were detected on Southern blots of restricted genomic DNAs from mouse, man, lizard, frog, and carp. No hybridization was observed with Drosophila, yeast, or Escherichia coli DNA. In human DNA, sequences homologous to this element were located at the 5' end of the c-myb gene, i.e. in the same position as in the chicken and mouse genes. Several lines of evidence suggest that the element is not a coding exon of a gene overlapping the c-myb gene. It may be of importance that one of the DNase I-sensitive sites and several c-myb mRNA cap sites localized recently in the mouse c-myb gene (3,4) lie within this region. It is suggested that this evolutionarily conserved element is involved in the regulation of myb proto-oncogene expression in vertebrates.
