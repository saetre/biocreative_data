Background
###end title 2
###begin p 3
The events required to initiate host defenses against invading pathogens involve complex signaling cascades comprised of numerous adaptor molecules, kinases, and transcriptional elements, ultimately leading to the production of proinflammatory cytokines, such as tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha). How these signaling cascades are regulated, and the proteins and regulatory elements participating are still poorly understood.

We report here the development a completely random short-hairpin RNA (shRNA) library coupled with a novel forward genetic screening strategy to identify inhibitors of Toll-like receptor (TLR) dependent proinflammatory responses. We developed a murine macrophage reporter cell line stably transfected with a construct expressing diphtheria toxin-A (DT-A) under the control of the TNF-alpha-promoter. Stimulation of the reporter cell line with the TLR ligand lipopolysaccharide (LPS) resulted in DT-A induced cell death, which could be prevented by the addition of an shRNA targeting the TLR adaptor molecule MyD88. Utilizing this cell line, we screened a completely random lentiviral short hairpin RNA (shRNA) library for sequences that inhibited TLR-mediated TNF-alpha production. Recovery of shRNA sequences from surviving cells led to the identification of unique shRNA sequences that significantly inhibited TLR4-dependent TNF-alpha gene expression. Furthermore, these shRNA sequences specifically blocked TLR2 but not TLR3-dependent TNF-alpha production.

Mammalian Toll-like receptors (TLRs) are single-spanning membrane proteins that display a conserved cytoplasmic Toll-interleukin 1 (IL-1) receptor (TIR) domain motif [1]. Individual TLRs recognize a distinct repertoire of conserved microbial products and are critical mediators of the innate immune response to infection [2]. For example, TLR4 recognizes LPS, an integral cell wall component of Gram-negative bacteria [3], [4], [5], TLR2 recognizes peptidoglycan [6], [7] and bacterial lipoproteins [8], [9], [10], and TLR3 recognizes double stranded RNA (dsRNA), which is produced by many viruses during replication [11].

As a result of shared, cytoplasmic TIR domains, all TLRs utilize similar signaling pathways. In the MyD88-dependent pathway, recruitment of the adaptor protein MyD88 leads to the production of proinflammatory cytokines, such as TNF-alpha, through the sequential activation of intracellular signaling molecules such as IL-1R-associated kinase (IRAK1) and TNFR-associated factor 6 (TRAF6) [12], [13]. Alternatively, in the MyD88 independent pathway, recruitment of the adaptor molecule TIR domain-containing adaptor-inducing IFN-beta (TRIF) can result in the production of type I interferons through the activation of IFN regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) [14]. Signaling through the MyD88-independent pathway can also induce TNF-alpha production, albeit in a delayed manner, through activation of IRF3 [15]. With the exception of TLR3 and TLR4, all TLRs signal exclusively through the MyD88-dependent pathway. TLR3 is activated solely through the MyD88-independent (TRIF) pathway and is essential for anti-viral responses [14]. TLR4 is unique in that both MyD88-dependent and independent pathways can become activated following its ligation [16], [17].

Full activation of TLR signals is essential for the elimination of invading pathogens [18], [19]. However, tight control of TLR responses is critical as excessive TLR activation can result in immunopathological conditions such as endotoxin shock and chronic autoimmune disease [20]. As many of the mechanisms essential in controlling TLR proinflammatory signals are still unclear, new strategies to identify regulators of TLR signaling are needed.

Short hairpin RNA (shRNA) mediated loss-of-function screens in mammalian cells are powerful tools for the discovery of novel gene functions. To date, two general strategies to develop shRNA libraries have been described. The first requires the synthesis of individual shRNAs targeting each gene of the genome [21], [22]. Alternatively, several groups have generated shRNA libraries from pools of double stranded cDNAs [23], [24], [25], [26]. Both of these strategies have been successfully used in large-scale mammalian screens to identify novel gene functions in various biological processes demonstrating the power of the shRNA library approach [21], [22], [27], [28], [29], [30], [31]. However, these aforementioned RNAi libraries have limited sequence diversity and are restricted to the identification of known protein coding genes or highly expressed cDNA populations. The generation of an RNAi library that is random at the nucleotide level with unrestricted gene perturbation potential could overcome the limitations of traditional RNAi libraries.

The procedure for generating a completely random shRNA library is outlined in Figure 1. First, a 120 bp oligonucleotide containing 20 bp of the 3' end of U6 including a "G" to initiate transcription, 18 random nucleotides (sense), and a stem-loop structure that can act as a primer for synthesizing the strand complementary to the random 18-bp (anti-sense) was made (Fig. 1A). To stop DNA polymerization at the end of the anti-sense 19-bp, a blocking primer containing the sequence complementary to the U6 promoter region was added to anneal to the U6 promoter in the extension reaction (Fig. 1B.1). Since T4 DNA polymerase lacks strand displacement activity, the polymerase will stop transcription upon reaching the 5' end of the blocking primer (Fig. 1B.2). Following purification of the extended oligonucleotide (Fig. 1B.3), we used terminal transferase (TdT) to attach a poly-thymidine tract, which is recognized as a termination sequence by RNA polymerase III, at the end of the oligonucleotide (Fig. 1B.4). To make the oligonucleotide double stranded, we utilized Exo- klenow fragment, which has strong strand displacement activity and lacks exonuclease activity, and a poly-A oligonucleotide, which can bind to the poly-thymidine tract of the oligonucleotide (Fig. 1B.5). This purified double-stranded DNA was used as a template and amplified using uracil containing primers (Fig. 1B.6). Digestion of the PCR product with USER enzyme (Fig. 1B.7), which digests uracil residues, was used to generate 7 and 4 base pair overhangs to facilitate cloning (Fig. 1B.8). Following cloning into the lentiviral vector pLL3.7, the extra sequence between the random sense and antisense sequence was removed by BpmI digestion and re-ligated, leaving a 9 base pair loop sequence [32]. Importantly, the entire procedure required only one PCR amplification step, minimizing the possibility of sequence specific bias in the generation of the library.

The average transformation efficiency was calculated to be 2x108 colonies per ligation reaction. One hundred duplicate electro-transformations were performed resulting in 2x1010 total transformants.

After the library was constructed, 200 clones were randomly sequenced. Among the 200 clones, 154 had the expected shRNA sequence architecture (i.e., sense19-mer - loop - antisense 19-mer) (data not shown). This result implies that about 77% of the library contains the appropriate shRNA construct, indicating a functional library size of approximately 1.5x1010. Among the incorrect constructs, 22% contained sequences that lacked inverted repeats, 6% contained an incorrect loop sequence, and 2% lacked the poly-T transcription termination sequence. Importantly, all 154 correct sequences were unique, confirming the randomness of the shRNA library.

To identify shRNAs which inhibit LPS induced proinflammatory signals, we generated a murine macrophage reporter cell line (RAW 264.7) that ectopically expresses the diphtheria toxin A (DT-A) fragment driven by the murine TNF-alpha promoter (Fig. 2A). Thus, cells transduced with an shRNA which inhibits genes necessary for TLR-dependent proinflammatory signals would be positively selected and survive, whereas cells transduced with an irrelevant shRNA would express DT-A and die. Importantly, DT-A cannot enter living cells in the absence of the DT-B fragment [33]. As a result, expression of DT-A alone in cells transduced with an irrelevant shRNA would not have bystander activity to neighboring cells transduced with an shRNA that inhibits TNF-alpha production (data not shown).

(A) Schematic of macrophage reporter cell line. The murine macrophage-like cell line RAW 264.7 was stably co-transfected with the TNF-TetO2-Tox176 reporter plasmid and the Tet-repressor expression plasmid, PCDNA6/TR. A stable clone was isolated which exhibited the following properties: upon stimulation with lipopolysaccharide and doxycycline, cells expressed DT-A which resulted in cell death (top). However, when transduced with shRNAs which inhibited LPS induced TNF-alpha production, cells were resistant to LPS induced cytotoxicity (bottom). (B) RAW 264.7 mock infected (RAW), non-specific shRNA (control), and MyD88 specific shRNA infected TNF-Tox cells were stimulated with LPS (2 microg/ml) and doxycycline (1 microg/ml) or just medium alone.

Due to the toxicity of DT-A, several safeguards were necessary to prevent spontaneous cell death. First, wild type DT-A proved to be too toxic as cells transfected with a TNF alpha reporter plasmid driving wild type DT-A died spontaneously (data not shown). Thus, we used the attenuated form of DT-A (Tox-176) which has been shown to be 10-100 fold less active than the wild type DT-A [34]. Second, the TNF-alpha promoter exhibits high basal levels of gene expression (Fig. 3C). To obtain tight control of DT-A gene expression, we modified the reporter plasmid to introduce two TetO2 operator sites in the TNF-alpha promoter and used GFP fluorescence as readout for TNF-alpha promoter activity (Fig. 3A). Cotransfection of a plasmid encoding the Tet-repressor efficiently suppressed the basal level of the TNF-alpha promoter activity by three-fold (compare Fig. 3B vs. 3C). Importantly, Tet-repressor mediated suppression of TNF-alpha promoter activity was reversible by the addition of the inhibitor of Tet-repressor, doxycycline (compare Fig. 3B vs. 3D).

Isolation of macrophage clones stably expressing both the attenuated form of DT-A (Tox-176), under the control of a Tet-repressor sensitive TNF-alpha promoter, and the Tet-repressor (hereafter referred to as TNF-Tox cells) proved to be the most efficient, as these clones were highly sensitive to LPS-induced cytotoxicity and grew in vitro with kinetics similar to those of the parental RAW 264.7 cells (data not shown).

To determine if downregulation of a known component of the TLR signaling pathway would inhibit LPS-induced cytotoxicity, we infected TNF-Tox cells with lentivirus expressing an shRNA targeting MyD88, a critical adaptor molecule required for LPS-dependent proinflammatory signals. Indeed, downregulation of MyD88 in TNF-Tox reporter cells resulted in a 3-fold increase in cell viability compared to mock infected cells (Fig. 2B). The expression of a scrambled non-specific control shRNA sequence did not result in an increase in cell viability, indicating that the increased survival of MyD88 shRNA infected cells was a direct result of MyD88 downregulation. Thus, the expression of an shRNA targeting a molecule known to be essential for the induction of LPS induced proinflammatory signals can protect the TNF-Tox reporter cells from LPS-induced cytotoxicity, a proof-of-principle that the reporter cell line is robust.

The random shRNA library was transduced into the TNF-Tox reporter cell line at a concentration of virus chosen to ensure an average of one copy of shRNA per cell. Seventy two hours post-infection, the cells were stimulated with LPS and doxycycline and monitored for survival. The genomic DNA from surviving cells was harvested and PCR was used to amplify the enriched shRNA sequences. Amplified DNAs were re-cloned into the lentiviral vector and used to make fresh viral stocks containing the enriched shRNA sequences. These sequences were subsequently transduced into fresh TNF-Tox cells and the selection procedure was repeated. Following five rounds of enrichment, we observed a significant increase in cell survival compared to TNF-Tox cells infected with a scrambled non-specific shRNA sequence (data not shown). Again, PCR was used to amplify the shRNA sequences from genomic DNA. The amplified DNAs were cloned into the lentiviral vector and 140 clones were sequenced (Table 1).

Sequence analysis revealed that approximately half of the total shRNAs sequenced were present at least twice, indicating a significant enrichment as a result of the screening procedure (Fig. 4A). Of particular interest, four shRNA sequences (HP-A, HP-B, HP-C, and HP-D) were present at relatively high frequencies and occurred 12, 10, 9, and 8 times, respectively, in 140 total clones (Fig. 4B). HP-A had a mismatch at position 9 of the sense strand with the antisense strand that corresponded to a G:U wobble which has been shown to have no adverse effects on RNAi activity [35]. Unexpectedly, we were unable to identify by BLAST a single target transcript with perfect complementarity to any of our recovered shRNA sequences.

To determine if these shRNA sequences targeted genes necessary for the induction of proinflammatory cytokines, we generated lentiviruses containing these hairpin sequences and tested them individually in the TNF-Tox reporter cells. Following LPS stimulation, all four shRNA sequences significantly inhibited LPS-induced DT-A production as determined by increased reporter cell viability (Fig. 5A). Interestingly, the extent of increased viability appeared to correlate with the frequency of the shRNAs in the sequenced pool. As HP-A and HP-B exhibited the most dramatic increase in viability (2.2-fold and 2-fold increase, respectively) over uninfected TNF-Tox cells, we focused on these shRNA sequences for the remainder of our experiments.

To test if the recovered shRNA sequences also inhibited LPS-induced TNF-alpha gene expression, HP-A and HP-B were transduced into the parental macrophage-like cell line RAW 264.7. Consistent with results from the TNF-Tox reporter cell, both HP-A and HP-B significantly inhibited TNF-alpha gene expression in RAW 264.7 cells compared to cells infected with a non-specific shRNA sequence (Fig. 5B). The levels of inhibition (38% and 27% for HP-A and HP-B, respectively) approached those seen in cells infected with an shRNA targeting MyD88 (44%), suggesting that both shRNAs targeted a gene (or genes) essential for LPS-induced TNF-alpha production.

TLR4 is unique in that its activation can promote TNF-production through both the MyD88-dependent pathway and the MyD88-independent TRIF pathway [16], [17]. As these signaling pathways are also shared by other TLRs, we tested the ability of our shRNA sequences to inhibit poly (I:C) (TLR3, MyD88 independent) and Pam3Cys (TLR2, MyD88 dependent)-dependent proinflammatory signals. Both HP-A and HP-B inhibited Pam3Cys-dependent TNF-alpha production by 45% and 32%, respectively (Fig. 6A). In contrast, neither of the two shRNAs inhibited poly (I:C) dependent TNF-alpha production, suggesting that the target (or targets) of these shRNAs was a component of the MyD88-dependent pathway (Fig. 6B).

Individual TLRs initiate distinct cellular responses. Yet the mechanisms by which these specific signaling cascades are activated remain unclear. The strong association between dysregulation of TLR signaling and the development of chronic inflammatory diseases [20] highlights the need for novel strategies to identify molecular targets that modulate TLR-mediated inflammatory pathways. Using an RNAi-based forward genetic approach, we have identified unique shRNA sequences that inhibit genes necessary for LPS (TLR4) and Pam3Cys (TLR2)-dependent TNF-alpha production. Importantly, the inhibition of proinflammatory cytokine production by these shRNAs appears to be unique to MyD88-dependent signaling pathways as poly (I:C) (TLR3)-dependent TNF-alpha production was not inhibited.

One of the hurdles in large-scale gene knockdown experiments is the development of a robust screening system to identify shRNAs with the intended effect. The need for a robust screening system becomes increasingly important as the size of the shRNA library increases, since the majority of shRNAs in a given shRNA library pool will most likely not provide the desired phenotype. Many RNA interference screens rely on the ability of an interfering RNA to rescue a cell from death caused by some cytotoxic drug. However, this approach is very limited as most signaling pathways do not end with cell death. An alternative approach is to use oligonucleotide microarrays to identify the relative enrichment or depletion of individual shRNAs in a large pool (barcode screening) [21], [22]. By comparing the differences in the ratio of shRNA populations in a control population versus a population treated with a selective agent, shRNAs with altered frequencies can be identified. This barcode screening approach can be useful in identifying shRNA targets that are either positively or negatively regulated. However, a major limitation to this system is that the selective agent must provide a specific growth advantage or disadvantage.

In the present study, we have developed a simple positive selection approach for identifying essential components of signaling pathways, such as TLR signaling, where ligand binding does not alter cell viability. By placing DT-A production under the control of the TNF-alpha promoter, we were able to positively select shRNA sequences which inhibited LPS induced TNF-alpha production. Positive selection results in the complexity of the shRNA library pool decreasing significantly after each round of selection, thereby increasing the likelihood of identifying shRNA sequences that inhibit the targeted pathway. Importantly, this DT-A reporter system can be modified for use with other promoter systems and should greatly facilitate the identification of participants of various signaling pathways.

RNAi was initially considered to be a sequence-specific gene silencing mechanism that required a perfect match between the guide strand of the siRNA and the mRNA target sequence [36]. Under this assumption, much effort has been expended attempting to use RNAi to knockdown expression of specific genes. However, more recently, the issue of specificity has been questioned as several groups have demonstrated that various mismatches between the guide strand of the siRNA and the mRNA target do not abolish the silencing effect of the siRNA [37], [38]. Additionally, microarray analyses have demonstrated that siRNAs with only partial complementarity to the 3' untranslated region of mRNAs can cause reduction in the RNA levels of a large number of transcripts, a phenomenon termed "off-target" effects [39], [40]. Such "off-target" effects greatly increase the difficulty of identifying the genes actually responsible for the selected phenotype.

Although verification of the siRNA target gene can be easily done by generating multiple siRNAs targeting other regions of the gene, this strategy becomes problematic if the phenotype caused by the siRNA is mediated strictly by an "off-target" effect. A recent example of this is a study by Lin et al. in which all of the top candidate siRNAs from their siRNA screen were found to elicit off-target gene silencing[41]. Through the use of gene expression profiling and bioinformatic analysis, Lin et al. were able to identify Mcl-1 as the "off-target" gene responsible for resistance to the small molecule ABT-737 in their siRNA screen. Interestingly, the library used in their study contained several siRNAs that were designed to target Mcl-1. However, none of the four Mcl-1-specific siRNAs from their library were able to sensitize cancer cells to ABT-737 induced cytotoxicity, whereas the top candidate siRNAs from their screen, specific for FGFR2, TNFRSF13B, and PRDM13, were able to inhibit Mcl-1 gene expression through partial complementarity of the siRNAs to the 3' untranslated region of Mcl-1. Thus, caution needs to be taken when interpreting data obtained from RNAi libraries as specific siRNAs do not always target their intended gene and in some cases may exhibit "off-target" effects.

Recently, it has been shown that overexpression of Argonaute-2 (Ago2) can enhance the specificity and potency of shRNAs for mRNA targets with perfectly matched binding sites [42]. Thus, the ectopic expression of Ago2 in our TNF-Tox cell line may increase the likelihood of identifying perfectly matched shRNA sequences. However, it should be noted that in the case of Lin et al., identification of Mcl-1 as a target for sensitizing cancer cells to ABT-737 would not have been possible if siRNAs with partial complementarity to Mcl-1 were not present to downregulate Mcl-1 through "off-target" effects. Thus, shRNA libraries with greater diversity, and potentially greater "off-target" gene silencing, such as our random shRNA library, may provide greater genome wide coverage and increase the probability of identifying small RNAs capable of modulating complex cellular signaling pathways in a phenotype driven screen. Although the bona fide targets of our shRNA sequences could not be identified using target identification algorithms such as BLAST, the recovered shRNA sequences were confirmed to be potent inhibitors of MyD88-dependent inflammation and may have therapeutic implications for the treatment of chronic inflammatory disorders.

In summary, we have developed a completely random shRNA library and a novel reporter cell line for large-scale genomic screens. Importantly, any RNA species could potentially be targeted using this shRNA library (for example, noncoding RNA transcripts, alternatively spliced transcripts, or viral RNAs) in virtually any mammalian cell. The use of such random shRNA libraries for gene discovery coupled with stringent selection systems can facilitate the rapid identification of small RNA modulators involved in various biological processes.
