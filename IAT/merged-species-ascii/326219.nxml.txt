The complete nucleotide sequences of three cDNAs coding for the C-terminal part of mouse histocompatibility (H-2) antigens, and for the 3' non coding regions of these clones have been determined. Comparison of the sequence indicates a large homology throughout the coding and non-coding regions and suggests the existence of a genetic mechanism which homogenizes nucleotide sequences among genes of the H-2 multigene family.
