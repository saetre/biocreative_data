We have isolated a Yb-subunit cDNA clone from a GSH S-transferase (GST) cDNA library made from rat liver polysomal poly(A) RNAs. Sequence analysis of one of these cDNA, pGTR200, revealed an open reading frame of 218 amino acids of Mr = 25,915. The deduced sequence is in agreement with the 19 NH2-terminal residues for GST-A. The sequence of pGTR200 differs from another Yb cDNA, pGTA/C44 by four nucleotides and two amino acids in the coding region, thus revealing sequence microheterogeneity. The cDNA insert in pGTR200 also contains 36 nucleotides in the 5' noncoding region and a complete 3' noncoding region. The Yb subunit cDNA shares very limited homology with those of the Ya or Yc cDNAs, but has relatively higher sequence homology to the placental subunit Yp clone pGP5. The mRNA of pGTR200 is not expressed abundantly in rat hearts and seminal vesicles. Therefore, the GST subunit sequence of pGTR200 probably represents a basic Yb subunit. Genomic DNA hybridization patterns showed a complexity consistent with having a multigene family for Yb subunits. Comparison of the amino acid sequences of the Ya, Yb, Yc, and Yp subunits revealed significant conservation of amino acids (approximately 29%) throughout the coding sequences. These results indicate that the rat GSTs are products of at least four different genes that may constitute a supergene family.
