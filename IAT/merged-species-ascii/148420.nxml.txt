We have studied the role of the C-terminal domain of the alpha subunit (alphaCTD) of Escherichia coli RNA polymerase during transcription initiation at promoters lacking an UP-element. The temperature requirement for open complex formation was used as an indication of the kinetics of this process. We have previously shown that alphaCTD is required for transcription initiation at low temperature at the galP1 promoter, a promoter containing an UP-element. DNase I footprinting has been used to reveal the structure of open promoter complexes and the temperature requirement for open complex formation has been determined using potassium permanganate as a probe. In this work we show that, although alphaCTD is not absolutely required for transcription initiation at promoters lacking an UP-element, it does play a role during transcription initiation. This role is independent of the sequence of the promoter upstream from the -35 region and does not require stable alphaCTD-DNA interactions as determined by DNase I footprinting. The role of alphaCTD at promoters lacking an UP-element is discussed.
