DNAs from human pancreatic adenocarcinomas were analyzed for the presence of mutations in codons 12, 13 and 61 of the NRAS, KRAS and HRAS gene. Formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded tissue was used directly in an in vitro amplification reaction to expand the relevant RAS sequences. The mutations were detected by selective hybridization using mutation-specific synthetic oligonucleotides. In 28 of the 30 patients we found a mutation in codon 12 of the KRAS gene. This result confirms the findings of Almoguera et al. [Cell 53 (1988) 549-554] that KRAS mutations occur frequently in adenocarcinomas of the exocrine pancreas. The mutations are predominantly G-T transversions, in contrast to the KRAS mutations in colon tumors which are mainly G-A transitions. Furthermore, in a portion of the tumors the mutation appears to be homozygous.
