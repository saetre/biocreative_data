During the mean follow-up of 12.6 months (standard deviation 10.3 months), 188 (38%) patients died. Distribution of genotypes of polymorphism Arg16Gly was different relative to body mass index (chi2 = 9.797;p = 0.04). Overall the probability of survival was not significantly predicted by genotypes of Gln27Glu, Arg16Gly, or Thr164Ile. Allele and haplotype analysis also did not disclose any significant difference regarding mortality. Exploratory analysis through classification trees pointed towards a potential association between the Gln27Glu polymorphism and mortality in older individuals.

Genetic polymorphisms have been studied with the hypotheses of influencing presentation, course and prognosis of patients with heart failure [1]. Beta-2 adrenergic receptor gene polymorphisms Gln27Glu, Arg16Gly, and Thr164Ile were suggested to have a significant effect in patients with heart failure. In a study of 259 patients with ischemic or idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy, prognosis was less favorable in patients harboring the allele Ile164 relative to patients harboring the allele Thr164. In patients harboring alleles Gly16 and Glu27, previoulsy associated with increased down regulation of beta-2 adrenergic receptors, a statistically significant difference relative to prognosis has not been demonstrated. However, a trend to a prognostic influence of allele Gly16 was suggested by an apparent and non-significant lower survival rate in patients harboring allele Gly16 [2]. The polymorphisms Thr164Ile, Arg16Gly and the haplotypes with alleles Gly16 and Gln27 were associated with reduced exercise tolerance in other study that enrolled 232 patients with idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy or ischemic cardiomyopathy [3]. These findings substantiate the hypotheses that polymorphisms Arg16Gly, Gln27Glu and Thr164Ile of beta-2 receptor gene might be functional and might be associated with differences in the survival rate of patients with heart failure. Therefore, due to sparse and sometimes conflicting results, this hypothesis deserves further testing in different populations.

The diagnosis of heart failure was made according to previously published criteria [4]. The classification of the etiologies of heart failure followed previous recommendations [5-7]. As such, the diagnosis of chronic heart failure was made through both clinical and imaging procedures when necessary. Ischemic cardiomyopathy diagnosis this was made when a clear history of previous myocardial infarction and no other probable cause of heart dysfunction was present or, alternatively, through coronary angiography. All patients with the final diagnosis of idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy were studied through coronary angiography to exclude the diagnosis of ischemic cardiomyopathy.

Next, we have performed exploratory analysis through classification trees with the aim of identifying a potential subgroup of heart failure patients where B2 adrenergic genotype might be of predictive value. For this we have used in model's construction the following variables: genotype for the Arg16Gly polymorphism, genotype for the Gln27Glu polymorphism, ethnicity, age, sex, and HF etiology. Interestingly, the best classification model selected (Figure 1) incorporated information from the Gln27Glu polymorphism. The genotypic information derived from this marker was able to sub-classify individuals older than 65 years into a mortality high-risk group (65% chance of dying) and an intermediate-risk group (38% chance of dying).

We have tested the use of this information through modeling time to event (death) in the entire population in a new Cox regression model, but adding both Gln27Glu information and the interaction term Gln27Glu*age in the model. In this new model (using data from 471 cases and 185 events), not only the interaction term was significantly associated with mortality, but the marginal term for the Gln27Glu polymorphism was also associated with heart failure mortality in our population. Both terms remained significantly associated with mortality even after adjustment for age, serum sodium, serum creatinine, ethnicity, baseline beta-blocker use, and heart failure etiology (Table 2). In fact, while a significant difference in relation to overall mortality was not observed for Gln27Glu genotypes in heart failure individuals younger than 65 years of age, a clear difference was observed when only individuals older than 65 years were analyzed (a subgroup comprising 30% of the studied sample) (Figure 2). In addition, a tendency towards increased mortality of Glu allele carriers was present in older individuals with both systolic and diastolic types of heart failure included in our cohort.

Taking into account the linkage disequilibrium between Arg16Gly and Gln27Glu (in our population of 93), our data point to an effect derived specifically form the Glu27 allele. First, allele analysis in older individuals were only able to disclose a significant association for the Glu27 allele (p = 0,002 for mortality), but not for the Arg16 or Gly16 allele (p = 0,33). Second, haplotype analysis showed a higher frequency of the Gly16/Glu27 haplotype in individuals who died (p = 0,001), but a lower frequency of the Gly16/Gln27 in individuals that died (p = 0,03). No difference was observed for the Arg16/Gln27 between patients who died and patients that did not, and the Arg16/Glu27 was, as expected, very rare in these individuals. These data suggest that, in fact, the effect was only present for the Gln27Glu polymorphism, and not derived indirectly from the strong LD pattern with the Arg16Gly polymorphism.

The different genotypes of polymorphisms Gln27Glu and Arg16Gly were present in the study sample in a distribution in accordance with previous reports including a Brazilian population sample [9]. Most genotypes of polymorphism Thr164Ile were homozygous for Thr164Thr; no patient homozygous for Ile164Ile was identified. Thr164Ile was identified only in 9 patients (2%), a lower frequency than observed in a previous experiment [3]. The number was considered small to the point of hindering appropriate statistical analysis and further analysis of this polymorphism relative to survival rate was not performed.

We observed a significant difference in the distribution of the polymorphism Arg16Gly relative to body mass index in this study sample of patients with heart failure. In a previous study of a general population sample, Arg16Gly polymorphism interacted significantly with body mass index to determine systolic blood pressure. Further, the presence of Arg16 allele was associated with 1.49-fold increase in the risk of obesity in multiple logistic regression model [9]. Thus, the relationship between the presence of Arg16 and body mass index may be operative also in patients with heart failure. Nevertheless, we have not observed a significant effect of this genetic marker in relation to mortality.

The significant variables associated with mortality - low body mass index [10], etiology of heart failure [11], serum sodium [12], serum creatinine [13] are known from previous experiences. Interestingly, we have observed a potential interaction between age and Gln27Glu polymorphism in modulating mortality incidence of the studied patients. In this scenario, the Gln27Glu polymorphism is predictive of a higher mortality only in individuals older than 65 years of age. Allele and haplotype analysis suggest that the main predictor of this effect was the Gln27Glu polymorphism and not, indirectly, the Arg16Gly polymorphism.

Similar to Ligget et al. [2] and to De Groote et al. [14] we did not find a significant association between the Arg16Gly and Gln27Glu polymorphism and survival when analyzing the entire population. Different from the described by De Groote et al., however, we observed a tendency of a lower survival rate in the Gly16Glu27 haplotype and not the Gly16Gln27 haplotype [14]. Nevertheless, we are not the first group to describe this particular association. Forleo et al. [15] also described a significantly higher risk for death from heart failure (among other end-points) associated with the Glu27 allele in homozygosis in a similar population than ours, patients with dilated cardiomyopathy. Others, however, have observed exactly the opposite association [16,17]. In particular, Heckbert et al, studying a large sample of elderly individuals without heart failure observed the Glu27 allele to be associated with a lower risk of incident coronary events [18]. Since the Gln27Glu polymorphism may modulate the response to beta-blocker treatment in humans [19], different frequency of beta-blocker use in these different populations and different studied clinical scenarios may explain, at least in part, such discordant findings.

Our study has limitations. Demographic and clinical characteristics of the patients in this study sample may also have been operative for our findings. Specifically, in patients with severe disease in an advanced stage of its natural history, other variables denoting the clinical condition may be more significant for the evaluation of prognosis than a specific genetic substrate. Different etiologies of heart failure in this study sample may also limit the observation. For several baseline predictors we were unable to acquire complete information and we did not have access to follow-up information on medical therapy that could not only modulate overall survival, but also the effect of a particular genotype. Finally, the duration of follow-up was only mid-term.

The distribution of genotypes of polymorphism Arg16Gly was statistically significant relative to body mass index. We were not able to demonstrate a prognostic influence of polymorphisms Gln27Glu and Arg16Gly of beta-2 receptor gene, as individual alleles or as haplotypes, for the entire spectrum of patients with heart failure. Rather, there appears to be a specific modulating effect of the Gln27Glu polymorphism in individuals older than 65 years and heart failure. Further studies should address the specific role of the Glu27 allele in heart failure deterioration, especially in older individuals.
