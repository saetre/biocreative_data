A recombinant plasmid has been constructed which contains the mature protein coding region of the human serum albumin (HSA) gene. Bacteria containing this plasmid synthesize HSA protein under control of the E. coli trp promoter-operator. The DNA sequence and predicted protein sequence of HSA were determined from the cDNA plasmid and are compared to existing data obtained from direct protein sequencing. The DNA sequence predicts a mature protein of 585 amino acids preceded by a 24 amino acid "prepro" peptide.
