An 864 bp EcoRI fragment carrying oriVR751, the vegetative replication origin of broad host range IncP plasmid R751, was cloned and sequenced. Only the trfA gene of the IncP plasmid RK2 was required in trans for the function of oriVR751. The sequence of oriVR751 showed 65% overall homology to that of oriVRK2 determined previously. Highly conserved regions of probable functional importance were apparent, including two sets of direct repeats postulated to be interaction sites for the trfA protein(s), a putative dnaA protein binding site and a downstream inverted repeat of unknown function.
