The effect of orphan nuclear receptor Nur77 overexpression on activation of an interleukin-2 (IL-2) promoter-luciferase construct was analyzed in the human leukemic cell line Jurkat. Cotransfection of the IL-2 promoter construct together with the Nur77 expression plasmid resulted in a significant repression of IL-2 promoter activation compared to control cells. The repression by Nur77 requires the N-terminal activation function-1 domain. The repressive effect of Nur77 on IL-2 promoter activation is mediated through inhibition of the transcription factor complex nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB), since blocking or alteration of the IL-2 NF-kappaB binding sites resulted in abrogation of the repressive effect of Nur77. Moreover, further examination of a reporter gene construct containing multiple copies of the IL-2 CD28 response element (CD28RE) showed that Nur77 can inhibit transactivation mediated by the NF-kappaB components p65 and c-Rel. However, no effect of Nur77 was seen on p65-mediated transactivation of a construct containing multiple NF-kappaB binding sites of the HIV LTR. Our data suggest that Nur77 is able to block activation through NF-kappaB when bound to low-affinity NF-kappaB binding sites, such as those located in the IL-2 promoter.

The orphan nuclear receptor Nur77 (NR4A1, NAK-1, TR3, NGFI-B) is an immediate-early response gene which is induced after stimulation with serum, growth factors and nerve growth factor (1,2). Nur77 and its closely related receptors Nurr1 (NR4A2) and Nor-1 (NR4A3) have the classical nuclear receptor structure, with an N-terminal activation function-1 (AF-1) domain, a highly homologous DNA-binding domain (DBD) and a similar ligand-binding domain (LBD), together with a C-terminal activation function-2 (AF-2) domain [reviewed in (3)]. Since no physiological ligands for these receptors have been identified, they are classed as 'orphan' nuclear receptors. Nur77, Nurr1 and Nor-1 can bind as monomers to a DNA sequence, the NBRE, or as homodimers to a palindromic sequence, the NurRE (4). Nur77 and Nurr1 can also form heterodimers with the retinoid X receptor (5).

In CD4/CD8 double-positive thymocytes and T cell hybridomas, Nur77 expression is induced through the T cell receptor (TCR) and is implicated in activation-induced apoptosis (3,6-9). Evidence exists that the DBD and a functional N-terminal AF-1 domain are required for its pro-apoptotic function, since induction of apoptosis by wild-type Nur77 can be inhibited by a dominant-negative mutant of Nur77 lacking the AF-1 domain (10,11). However, another study demonstrated that Nur77 can induce apoptosis in the prostate cancer cell line LNCaP also in the absence of the DBD, but causes cell death through translocation to the mitochondria and induction of cytochrome c release (12). A recent paper demonstrated that Nur77 can interact with Bcl-2, resulting in conversion of Bcl-2 from an anti-apoptotic to a pro-apoptotic molecule (13). In thymocytes undergoing apoptosis, such mitochondrial targeting of Nur77 and cytochrome c release was not observed. In apoptotic thymocytes, Nur77 localizes to the nucleus, indicating that Nur77 acts by induction of genes involved in apoptosis. In fact, microarray analysis from thymocytes demonstrated that Nur77 induces known apoptotic genes, such as FasL and TRAIL, but also the novel genes Nur77 Downstream Gene 1 and 2 (NDG1 and NDG2) (14). In contrast to its role as a pro-apoptotic molecule, Nur77 has also been described as a survival factor when induced through tumor necrosis factor signaling (15). Nur77 is induced by various stimuli in different cell types, but its mere expression is not necessarily sufficient for the induction of apoptosis. Post-translational modification of the receptor may determine its pro-apoptotic activity, since phosphorylation within its DBD by Akt can inhibit its transcriptional activity and T cell apoptosis (16,17). Apart from its expression in double-positive thymocytes in mouse, Nur77 has been shown to be inducible through activation in human peripheral T lymphocytes, together with Nurr1 and Nor-1 (18,19). It is therefore likely that Nur77 plays a role in T cell activation and activation-induced apoptosis in these cells.

Of the transcription factor complexes involved in T cell activation, nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) clearly plays an important role. Members of the NF-kappaB family are the proteins p50 (NF-kappaB1), p52 (NF-kappaB2), p65 (RelA), c-Rel and RelB [reviewed in (20)]. Various homo- or heterodimers can bind to NF-kappaB recognition sites located in regulatory regions of many genes, but the most common complex is the p50/p65 heterodimer. Activation of NF-kappaB is associated with phosphorylation and proteolytic degradation of the inhibitory protein IkappaB through activation of the IkappaB kinase (IKK) complex [reviewed in (21,22)].

In this study we investigate the function of Nur77 at the molecular level in activated T cells. We show that overexpression of Nur77 in the human T cell leukemia cell line Jurkat can repress activation of an IL-2 promoter-luciferase construct via negative regulation of the transcription factor NF-kappaB. This repression is dependent on the N-terminal sequences of Nur77, which comprise the AF-1 domain.

Jurkat cells were cultivated in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% FCS and passaged twice a week. For transfection, 1 x 107 cells were collected by centrifugation, washed once with 2 ml phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) def., and resuspended in 100 mul PBS def. Plasmid DNA was added to a gene pulse cuvette (0.2 cm; BioRad) before addition of the cell suspension. For transfection with the IL-2 promoter constructs, 10 mug of IL-2 promoter constructs and 10 mug of the individual expression plasmids were used. Electroporation was carried out at 120 V and 960 muF. After electroporation, cells were resuspended in 2.5 ml of prewarmed RPMI 1640 + 10% FCS. 100 mul were dispensed into each well of a 96 well plate. Twenty hours post-transfection, cells were stimulated with 10 ng/ml PMA and 0.5 mug/ml ionomycin for 24 h. For stimulation with anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 antibodies, anti-CD3 antibody (Pharmingen) was coated overnight to white 96 well plates at a concentration of 10 mug/well in a volume of 100 mul. The next day, cells were added to the well and incubated with anti-CD28 (Pharmingen) antibody at a concentration of 5 mug/ml. After stimulation, cells were lysed directly in the plates and the lysates analyzed for luciferase activity using the Top count scintillation counter (HP) or the Microbeta Wallac Jet (Wallac). Individual conditions for cotransfection experiments using 600 ng of pRL-CMV or pRL-tk as internal controls are described in the figure legends. Firefly luciferase and renilla luciferase activities were measured using the Dual-luciferase assay system (Promega).

The activity of a Nur77 expression plasmid was confirmed by cotransfection of Jurkat cells with a luciferase reporter gene construct, containing four copies of the NBRE fused to a minimal tk promoter (4xNBREtkLUC), resulting in a 90-fold activation of reporter gene expression (Figure 1A). Reporter gene expression driven by the NBRE was also strongly enhanced by stimulation of Jurkat cells with PMA + ionomycin (Figure 1B), which induces expression of Nur77 (19).

We observed that PMA + ionomycin-mediated activation of an IL-2 promoter-luciferase construct (-471 to +49 nt relative to the transcription start) was inhibited by overexpressed Nur77, between 70 and 90% compared to pcDNA3.1-transfected cells. This repression of IL-2 promoter was observed after 6 h (Figure 1C) and 24 h (Figure 1D) with the effect being more pronounced after 24 h. Activation of the IL-2 promoter was also inhibited by transfected Nur77 when cells were stimulated with plate-bound anti-CD3 antibody and soluble anti-CD28 antibody (Figure 1E).

To analyze the mechanism responsible for the repression of IL-2 promoter activation by overexpressed Nur77, expression constructs encoding N- and C-terminal truncations of Nur77 were used for cotransfection studies (Figure 2A). The N-terminal amino acids comprising the AF-1 domain were sequentially removed, while retaining the DBD and LBD of the receptor. Cotransfection with full-length Nur77 resulted in 70% repression of IL-2 promoter activation and a similar or enhanced effect was seen after deletion of the 50 N-terminal amino acids (Nur77 amino acids 51-598). However, deletions of 100 (Nur77 amino acids 101-598) and 150 N-terminal amino acids (Nur77 amino acids 151-598) resulted in a reduced inhibition, leading to 60 and 40% repression of IL-2 promoter activation, respectively (Figure 2C). Thus, even removal of 150 N-terminal amino acids could not completely reverse the repressive effect. The extreme C-terminus of Nur77, which represents the AF-2 domain, was removed by deletion of 20 amino acids (Nur77 amino acids 1-578), and a second C-terminal Nur77 deletion mutant (Nur77 amino acids 1-380), which lacks large parts of the LBD, was also generated. A 60% repression of IL-2 promoter activation by Nur77 amino acids 1-578 and approximately 70% repression of IL-2 promoter activation by Nur77 amino acids 1-380 was observed. These data indicate that the N-terminal amino acids of Nur77 participate in the repressive effect on IL-2 promoter activation, while the C-terminal putative LBD appears to be dispensable (Figure 2C). The functionality of the constructs was further confirmed by cotransfection with the 4xNBREtkLUC reporter gene plasmid. While full-length Nur77 caused 90-fold activation of NBRE-driven luciferase expression, removal of the 50 N-terminal amino acids, as in construct Nur77 amino acids 51-598, reduced its transactivation ability to yield only 50-fold activation. Removal of 100 (Nur77 amino acids 101-598) and 150 (Nur77 amino acids 151-598) N-terminal amino acids resulted in a severe decrease in transactivation, down to a residual 15- to 20-fold activation of luciferase expression. Removal of C-terminal amino acids caused approximately 40-fold activation of NBRE-driven reporter gene expression (Figure 2D).

All constructs used in the experiments described above were analyzed in HEK293 cells transfected with the individual Nur77 mutants. Since expression of Nur77 and its mutants was relatively low in Jurkat cells, HEK293 cells were chosen as an alternative, because of the high transfection efficiencies obtained with this line. Western blot analysis demonstrated that each of the Nur77 mutants was expressed at levels comparable to that of the full-length Nur77 (Figure 2B).

We wished to determine the mechanism that underlies the repressive activity and asked whether overexpressed Nur77 interferes with transcription factors involved in the regulation of IL-2 promoter activation. We analyzed the effect of transfected Nur77 on activation of reporter gene constructs, representing multiple binding sites for NFAT and AP-1 transcription factors, which are essential for the regulation of IL-2 promoter activity. However, Nur77 overexpression had no effect on constructs monitoring activation of NFAT or AP-1 (data not shown). We also analyzed the effect of Nur77 overexpression on activation of a reporter gene construct driven by four copies of the CD28RE of the IL-2 promoter (4xCD28REtkLUC), which represents a low-affinity binding site for NF-kappaB upstream of a non-consensus AP-1 binding site (24). Cotransfection with the Nur77 expression plasmid resulted in a 40% repression of PMA + ionomycin-induced CD28RE-driven reporter gene expression (Figure 3A). The NF-kappaB binding site of the CD28RE and the NF-kappaB binding site of the interleukin-8 (IL-8) promoter are very similar and have been shown to be preferentially bound by p65- or c-Rel homodimers or p65-c-Rel heterodimers (25). Although the effect of Nur77 overexpression on activation of the IL-8 promoter was less pronounced than its effect on the IL-2 promoter, a 55% repression of PMA + ionomycin-induced expression of luciferase was observed (Figure 3B). However, cotransfection of Nur77 had no effect on expression of luciferase driven by five copies of a different NF-kappaB binding site, that of the HIV LTR (pNF-kappaB-LUC) (Figure 3C).

We next asked whether activation of these promoter constructs by overexpression of the NF-kappaB subunit p65 can be repressed by cotransfected Nur77. Strong activation of luciferase expression was seen when the construct 4xCD28REtkLUC was cotransfected with the p65 expression plasmid. When Nur77 was coexpressed, a significant, reproducible 80% reduction of this p65-mediated transactivation was observed (Figure 3D). However, Nur77 expression had no effect on p65-mediated activation of the construct with five copies of the HIV LTR NF-kappaB site (pNF-kappaB-LUC), analogous to the PMA + ionomycin stimulation of this construct (Figure 3E). The transfections were performed under identical conditions and in parallel. We also analyzed the effect of c-Rel on activation of CD28RE-dependent reporter gene expression in the presence and absence of Nur77. While c-Rel overexpression strongly activated luciferase expression, overexpression of Nur77 caused a significant repression of this effect (Figure 3F), suggesting that both p65 and c-Rel can interfere with Nur77.

These experiments provided evidence that Nur77 targets the NF-kappaB binding sites of the IL-2 promoter, located within the CD28RE (-161 to -154 nt relative to the transcription start) and further upstream (-205 to -198 nt relative to the transcription start). These sites were analyzed in more detail, by introducing mutations into the IL-2 promoter (Figure 4A). Mutation destroying either of the NF-kappaB binding sites attenuated IL-2 promoter activation, but did not reverse the repressive effect caused by cotransfection of Nur77 (Figure 4B). Mutations introduced into both NF-kappaB binding sites resulted in an IL-2 promoter construct, which was not inducible, thus preventing analysis of the effect of Nur77. Other binding sites for the transcription factors NFAT, AP-1, SP-1 and octamer-binding factors were also mutated, but had no effect on the repressive action of Nur77 (data not shown). To analyze whether the sequence of the NF-kappaB binding sites of the IL-2 promoter plays a role in the repressive effect of Nur77, these sites were changed into the consensus NF-kappaB binding site of the HIV LTR. This sequence was chosen since it is present in the construct containing multiple NF-kappaB binding sites, where activation was unaffected by overexpressed Nur77. When both IL-2 NF-kappaB binding sites were altered to the HIV LTR NF-kappaB binding site, no Nur77-mediated repression was observed (Figure 4C). These results indicate that the NF-kappaB binding sites of the IL-2 promoter are indeed involved in the repressive effect of Nur77.

Next, cotransfections with C-terminal truncations of NF-kappaB p65 together with the IL-2 promoter were performed, with the aim of blocking binding of endogenous NF-kappaB to its binding sites in the IL-2 promoter. The p65 C-terminal mutation 1 (p65 M1 amino acids 1-431) lacks C-terminal amino acids representing the transactivation domains, while the p65 C-terminal mutation 2 (p65 M2 amino acids 1-305) lacks larger parts of the C-terminal domains (26). When the constructs were cotransfected with the NF-kappaB-dependent reporter gene construct pNF-kappaB-LUC, stimulation of luciferase expression by PMA + ionomycin was significantly inhibited (Figure 5A). This result indicates that the mutants are able to compete for binding of endogenous NF-kappaB to its binding site. The expression of the mutants was further confirmed by western blot analysis using lysates obtained from transfected HEK293 cells (Figure 5D). When the p65 mutants were cotransfected with the IL-2 promoter, a decrease in inducibility by PMA + ionomycin was observed. While p65 M1 inhibited activation of the IL-2 promoter by only 35%, some further decrease was still observed in the presence of coexpressed Nur77. However, cotransfection with p65 M2 inhibited IL-2 promoter activation by 65%, and overexpressed Nur77 did not cause further repression (Figure 5B). The p65 mutant M1 was able to slightly transactivate the CD28RE. Cotransfection with Nur77, however, did not inhibit transactivation by p65 M1 (Figure 5C). These data indicate that the C-terminal domain of p65 is required for repression by Nur77.

We also analyzed the effect of p65 on activation of the NBRE by Nur77. Cotransfection of 4xNBREtkLUC and Nur77 in the presence of increasing amounts of p65 expression plasmid decreased activation of the NBRE-dependent luciferase expression (Figure 6A). However, cotransfection with the p65 mutants, p65 M1 or p65 M2, did not reduce NBRE activation by Nur77 (Figure 6B).

To analyze whether Nur77 can influence translocation or DNA binding of NF-kappaB proteins, Jurkat cells were transfected with the Nur77 expression plasmid and nuclear extracts were prepared from unstimulated cells and cells stimulated with PMA + ionomycin for 4 h to induce activation of NF-kappaB. Nuclear extracts were then analyzed in EMSA experiments for binding of NF-kappaB to the three types of binding sites used in this study. A reduction of the complex binding to the IL-2 NF-kappaB binding site and NF-kappaB binding site of the CD28RE was seen in Nur77-transfected cells, stimulated with PMA + ionomycin (Figure 7A). In addition, the presence of the NF-kappaB proteins p50, p65 and c-Rel in the nucleus was analyzed by western blot analysis, and no difference in nuclear localization between pcDNA3.1- or Nur77-transfected cells after stimulation with PMA + ionomycin was observed (Figure 7A).

Finally, the strength of NF-kappaB binding to the individual binding sites from nuclear extracts of PMA + ionomycin stimulated cells was examined. While there is very strong specific binding of NF-kappaB to the consensus NF-kappaB binding site of the HIV LTR, there is only a weak complex seen when the IL-2 NF-kappaB binding site or the CD28RE NF-kappaB binding site are used in EMSA analysis. Competition with increasing amounts of unlabeled oligonucleotide representing the HIV LTR NF-kappaB binding site showed that binding to both the IL-2 NF-kappaB and the CD28RE NF-kappaB binding sites is readily competed by the unlabeled oligonucleotide (Figure 7B). In summary, our data indicate that the inhibitory effect of Nur77 is mediated via the IL-2 NF-kappaB sites, and that the conversion of the two low-affinity NF-kappaB binding sites of the IL-2 promoter into two high-affinity binding sites of the HIV LTR overrides this inhibitory effect. It can therefore be speculated that Nur77 is an inhibitor of NF-kappaB, when bound to low-affinity binding sites.

The human orphan nuclear receptor Nur77 is crucially involved in activation-induced apoptosis in immature double-positive thymocytes and T cell hybridomas (6,7,9). Since Nur77 has been shown to be expressed in human peripheral T lymphocytes after activation (18,19), it is likely to be involved in the regulation of proliferation and activation-induced cell death also in mature T cells. In this investigation, we analyzed the effects of Nur77 at the molecular level in an activated T cell, using the human T cell leukemia cell line Jurkat. These cells express Nur77, Nurr1 and Nor-1 after stimulation with anti-CD3 or chemical stimuli, such as PMA + ionomycin [(19) and own observations]. We observed that overexpression of Nur77 resulted in a clear, reproducible repression of IL-2 promoter activation by PMA + ionomycin or anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 antibodies compared to vector-transfected cells.

Nur77 has the classical nuclear receptor structure of a DBD and LBD, and a long N-terminal domain, designated the AF-1 domain. This domain has been implicated in the constitutive, 'ligand-independent' activation by Nur77, since mutational analysis has demonstrated that it is essentially involved in transactivation by the receptor (6). The AF-1 domain has been shown to recruit several cofactors, which influence cell-specific transactivation by this nuclear receptor (27). By the use of N- and C-terminal truncated versions of Nur77 we were able to link its ability to transactivate via the NBRE and to repress IL-2 promoter activation, suggesting that the same domains are involved in both activities. These data indicate that Nur77 can repress IL-2 promoter activation only when it is transcriptionally competent, as has also been proposed for the induction of apoptosis (10).

Using mutations in the IL-2 promoter, we could identify the two NF-kappaB binding sites as the targets of the repressive action of Nur77. One binding site for NF-kappaB is located at -205 to -198 nt relative to the transcription start (28). The second NF-kappaB binding site is located within the CD28RE, which contains a low-affinity binding site for NF-kappaB adjacent to an AP-1 site, but which has also been shown to be bound by NFATp (29-31). The NF-kappaB family members p50, p65 and c-Rel can bind to the CD28RE NF-kappaB site, but it is preferentially bound by either p65- or c-Rel-homodimers, or p65- and c-Rel-heterodimers (31). The CD28RE NF-kappaB binding site is almost identical in sequence to the IL-8 NF-kappaB binding site (25). We saw a repression of both the CD28RE and IL-8 promoter activation by coexpressed Nur77. However, activation of a construct containing multiple binding sites of the HIV LTR NF-kappaB element was not influenced by Nur77. The HIV LTR NF-kappaB binding site has been shown to be preferentially bound by the p50/p65 heterodimer or a p50/p50 homodimer (32). In addition, conversion of the two IL-2 promoter NF-kappaB binding sites into the sequence of the NF-kappaB element in the HIV LTR resulted in a construct that was not repressed by Nur77. While the two NF-kappaB sites of the IL-2 promoter are both low-affinity binding sites, the HIV LTR NF-kappaB element has been demonstrated to be bound by NF-kappaB with high-affinity, a finding which we confirmed by EMSA. One reason for the repressive effect of Nur77 on the IL-2 promoter NF-kappaB element may be that it is not able to repress NF-kappaB when tightly bound to an element, such as that in the HIV LTR.

When we activated the CD28RE reporter construct by overexpression of p65, a clear repression of luciferase expression was seen when Nur77 was cotransfected. Also cotransfection with selected Nur77 deletion mutants, which caused differential repression of IL-2 promoter activation, showed a similar effect on p65-mediated transactivation (data not shown). Very similar effects of Nur77 were seen when the CD28RE-luciferase construct was cotransfected with a c-Rel expression plasmid. Our data indicate that Nur77 can interfere with p65 and c-Rel, both NF-kappaB members relevant for activation of the IL-2 promoter through the CD28RE. Furthermore, cotransfection experiments with the p65 deletion mutants showed that the C-terminal sequences of p65 are required for the repressive action of Nur77. While this manuscript was in preparation, Hong et al. demonstrated a direct interaction between p65 and Nur77. They showed that p65 can inhibit Nur77-mediated transactivation of steroidogenic genes, such as the P450c17 gene, and that transactivation of a synthetic NBRE construct by Nur77 was inhibited through p65 (33). In this study we also observed p65-mediated inhibition of Nur77-driven transactivation, but we can further show that this inhibition is reciprocal. However, we observed that Nur77-mediated inhibition of NF-kappaB-dependent transactivation requires the N-terminal domains of Nur77, while Hong et al. show that the C-terminal region of Nur77 is targeted by p65 (33). Thus, an interaction between the N- and C-terminal domains of Nur77 is probably required for an optimal interaction.

Negative cross-talk between NF-kappaB and members of the nuclear receptor family has been described for the glucocorticoid receptor (GR), members of the peroxisome proliferator activated receptors (PPARs), retinoid-related orphan receptors (ROR), and steroid hormone receptors amongst others, taking place at various regulatory levels. The cross-talk can be mediated via direct protein-protein interaction, common coregulators, or regulation of IkappaBalpha expression (34-38). The mechanism responsible for the repression of NF-kappaB activity by Nur77 appears to be very similar to that described for GR. The highest degree of homology between p65 and c-Rel exists within the N-terminal Rel homology domain (RHD), which is targeted by GR and, presumably, also Nur77. Moreover, in the case of GR, the C-terminal transactivation domains of p65 are necessary for repression (26), and this is also evident from our own data for Nur77.

In summary, we have demonstrated negative cross-talk between Nur77 and NF-kappaB. The potential role of this interaction in the induction of apoptosis by Nur77 will be the focus of further studies.

 Analysis of NF-kappaB proteins in the nucleus of vector- or Nur77-transfected Jurkat cells. (A) Jurkat cells were transfected either with the pcDNA3.1-vector or pcDNA3.1-Nur77. Nuclear extracts were prepared 40 h post-transfection of unstimulated cells or cells stimulated with PMA + ionomycin (iono) for 4 h. Left panel: EMSA analysis of the binding of NF-kappaB to the NF-kappaB binding site of the HIV LTR, IL-2 NF-kappaB and NF-kappaB of the CD28RE in pcDNA3.1 or pcDNA3.1-Nur77-transfected cells with and without stimulation with PMA + ionomycin (iono) for 4 h. As control, binding to a SP-1 site was also analyzed. Right panel: western blot analysis was performed for the detection of the NF-kappaB protein p50, p65 and c-Rel. (B) Binding of NF-kappaB from nuclear extracts from Jurkat cells, stimulated for 4 h with PMA + ionomycin (iono), to the different NF-kappaB binding sites. Binding of NF-kappaB to the radiolabeled oligonucleotides was competed with increasing amounts of unlabelled HIV NF-kappaB oligonucleotide (left panel). The presence of the NF-kappaB components p50 and p65 was confirmed by supershift analysis (right panel).
