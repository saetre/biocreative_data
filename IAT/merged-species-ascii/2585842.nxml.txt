Neuritic plaques in the brains are one of the pathological hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Amyloid beta-protein (Abeta), the central component of neuritic plaques, is derived from beta-amyloid precursor protein (APP) after beta- and gamma-secretase cleavage. The molecular mechanism underlying the pathogenesis of AD is not yet well defined, and there has been no effective treatment for AD. Valproic acid (VPA) is one of the most widely used anticonvulsant and mood-stabilizing agents for treating epilepsy and bipolar disorder. We found that VPA decreased Abeta production by inhibiting GSK-3beta-mediated gamma-secretase cleavage of APP both in vitro and in vivo. VPA treatment significantly reduced neuritic plaque formation and improved memory deficits in transgenic AD model mice. We also found that early application of VPA was important for alleviating memory deficits of AD model mice. Our study suggests that VPA may be beneficial in the prevention and treatment of AD.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common neurodegenerative disorder leading to dementia. Neuritic plaques, neurofibrillary tangles, and neuronal loss represent the main histological hallmarks observed in AD brains. Amyloid beta-protein (Abeta), the central component of senile plaques, is produced from sequential endoproteolytic cleavages of the type 1 transmembrane glycoprotein beta-amyloid precursor protein (APP) by beta- and gamma-secretase (1). beta-Site APP cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1) is the beta-secretase in vivo (2-6). gamma-Secretase is an atypical multimeric membrane-protein aspartic protease composed of at least four subunits: presenilin (PS1 or PS2), nicastrin (Nct), APH-1 (APH-1aL, APH-1aS, or APH-1b), and PEN-2 (7-11). More recently, two additional proteins, CD147 and TMP21, were found to be closely associated with the gamma-secretase complex (12, 13).The components of the gamma-secretase complex are tightly regulated with each other, and PS1 is generally believed to be its catalytic core (14, 15). Another important substrate of gamma-secretase is Notch, whose intracellular domain (NICD) is released upon gamma-secretase cleavage and translocates to the nucleus, where it can activate transcription of downstream target genes (8, 10). In addition to its role in Notch signaling and APP processing, gamma-secretase is also involved in regulating intramembraneous proteolysis of many other type I integral membrane proteins, such as Jagged, Delta, E-cadherin, ErbB-4, Nectin-1alpha, CD44, and LRP (16-22). Missense mutations in the PS1 and PS2 genes are major causes of early-onset familial AD (23-25). Although the underlying mechanism of AD neurodegeneration is currently unclear, Abeta accumulation appears to play a critical role in AD pathogenesis.

Valproic acid (VPA) is one of four first-line antiepileptic drugs being increasingly used in the treatment of bipolar disorder. Like other anticonvulsants, VPA inhibits sodium, potassium, and calcium channel functions. Although its direct in vivo target has yet to be definitively identified (26), VPA may enhance gamma-aminobutyric acid transmission (27). VPA has been found to activate extracellular signal-regulated kinase, a protein kinase known to regulate AP-1 function, and mediate neurotrophic responses (28). VPA treatment could lead to a change in glycogen synthase kinase (GSK-3) and histone deacetylase (HDAC) activity (29). Furthermore, VPA, like lithium, regulates the Wnt signaling pathway by increasing beta-catenin expression (30). Increased beta-catenin expression is also seen after treatment with the chemically unrelated HDAC inhibitor trichostatin A. This mechanism may explain some effects of VPA on gene expression and neurodevelopment (31). It has been shown that increased histone acetylation by HDAC inhibitors facilitates synaptogenesis and improves learning and memory, suggesting that inhibition of HDAC may be a suitable therapeutic avenue for neurodegenerative diseases (32).

In this study, we examined the effects of VPA on AD neuropathology and behavioral deficits and identified its underlying mechanism. We found that VPA inhibited GSK-3beta-mediated gamma-secretase cleavage of APP both in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, such inhibition decreased Abeta production and neuritic plaque formation, as well as alleviated the memory deficits in AD transgenic model mice. Our data suggest that VPA is effective for antiamyloid therapy in the prevention and treatment of AD.

To assess the effect of VPA treatment on AD neuropathology, APP23 transgenic mice, which are an AD mouse model, were subjected to VPA treatment. APP23 mice carry the human Swedish mutant APP751 transgene driven by the neuronal-specific Thy1.2 promoter (Fig. S1, available at ). APP23 mice develop amyloid plaques in the neocortex and hippocampus as early as 6 mo (33). APP23 mice were treated with 30 mg/kg VPA at 7 mo of age, whereas age-matched control APP23 mice received vehicle solution. To investigate whether VPA treatment could result in neuropathological changes in vivo, VPA-treated and control mice were killed after treatment and behavioral tests. 4G8 immunostaining and thioflavin S staining were used to detect Abeta-containing neuritic plaques in the brain (Fig. 1, A and B). Neuritic plaque formation was significantly decreased in APP23 mice treated with VPA (Fig. 1 A, b), relative to controls (Fig. 1 A, a). Quantification showed that overall VPA treatment reduced plaque number by approximately4-fold (3.5 +/- 0.79 vs. 14.95 +/- 2.09 per slice; P < 0.0001; Fig. 1 D). The effects were similar among mice killed either immediately, 1 mo, or 2 mo after treatment and behavioral testing (0.75 +/- 0.48 vs. 5.50 +/- 1.32, P < 0.001; 2.33 +/- 0.50 vs. 10.33 +/- 1.26, P < 0.001; and 5.30 +/- 1.33 vs. 21.5 +/- 02.76, P < 0.001, respectively; Fig. S2). APP23 mice were also treated with VPA at 9 mo of age. Significantly more neuritic plaques were formed in the mice at 9 mo compared with 7 mo of age; however, VPA treatment starting at the age of 9 mo could also significantly reduce neuritic plaque formation (Fig. 1 A, c and d). The number of plaques in VPA-treated and control mice were 11.09 +/- 0.92 and 25.60 +/- 3.50, respectively (P < 0.005; Fig. 1 E). The area of plaques was also significantly reduced in VPA-treated mice compared with control by 43.10 +/- 11.13% for the 7-mo-old group (P < 0.01) and by 59.66 +/- 5.44% for the 9-mo-old group (P < 0.05). In addition to reducing neuritic plaque formation, VPA treatment also significantly increased microtubule-associated protein (MAP)-2 immunoreactivity (Fig. 1 C), which indicated a protective effect on dendritic damages and promoting neurite outgrowth in the transgenic mice. Similar results were obtained with silver staining (unpublished data).

VPA treatment significantly reduces neuritic plaque formation in AD transgenic mice. (A) APP23 mice at the age of 7 or 9 mo and APP23/PS45 double-transgenic mice at the age of 6 wk were treated with 30 mg/kg VPA for 4 wk, whereas age-matched control APP23 mice received the vehicle solution. The mice were killed after behavioral tests and the brains were dissected, fixed, and sectioned. Neuritic plaques were detected using an Abeta-specific monoclonal antibody 4G8 and the DAB method. The plaques were visualized by microscopy with 40X magnification. The number of neuritic plaques was significantly reduced in VPA-treated mice compared with controls. b, d, and f show the representative brain section of the 7-mo APP23 age group, 9-mo APP23 age group, and APP23/PS45 mice treated with VPA, and a, c, and e show their controls, respectively.

To further confirm VPA's effect on AD pathogenesis, APP23 transgenic mice were crossbred with PS45 transgenic mice to generate APP23/PS45 double-transgenic mice. PS45 mice have an overexpression of the human familial AD-associated G384A mutant presenilin-1. The double-transgenic mice developed detectable neuritic plaques in the neocortex and hippocampus as early as 1 mo of age. Double-transgenic mice were treated with 30 mg/kg VPA at 6 wk of age for 4 wk. VPA treatment markedly inhibited neuritic plaque formation (Fig. 1 A, f and d) and significantly reduced plaque numbers from 14.84 +/- 1.67 to 2.862 +/- 0.65 (P < 0.0001; Fig. 1 F). Thioflavin S staining also confirmed VPA-induced reduction of Abeta-containing neuritic plaque formation in the brains of APP23 single-transgenic (Fig. 1 B, b and a) and APP23/PS45 double-transgenic (Fig. 1 B, d and c) mice. Over the 4-wk injection period, VPA treatment did not affect food and water consumption of the mice, and no significant weight changes were observed between the treatment and control groups (unpublished data). These data clearly demonstrate that VPA inhibits Abeta neuritic plaque formation in vivo.

To investigate whether VPA treatment affects learning and memory in AD pathogenesis, behavioral tests were performed after APP23 mice received 1 mo of VPA treatment starting at the age of 7 mo. The Morris water maze was used to determine the effect of VPA on spatial memory. In the visible platform tests, VPA-treated and control APP23 mice had similar escape latency (53.190 +/- 1.56 and 49.75 +/- 2.47 s; P > 0.05; Fig. 2 A) and path length (7.03 +/- 1.33 and 6.78 +/- 1.60 s; P > 0.05; Fig. 2 B), which indicated that VPA treatment did not affect mouse motility or vision. In the hidden platform-swimming test, APP23 mice treated with VPA showed significant improvements compared with the vehicle-treated controls. The escape latency on the third and fourth day of the hidden platform test was shorter (15.95 +/- 1.61 and 12.80 +/- 1.83 s) than nontreated APP23 mice (29.04 +/- 2.99 and 24.89 +/- 3.33 s; P < 0.001; Fig. 3 C). The VPA-treated mice were able to swim significantly shorter distances to reach the platform (3.88 +/- 0.91 and 2.68 +/- 1.02 m) compared with control mice (6.03 +/- 0.94 and 5.37 +/- 1.38 m) on the third and fourth day (P < 0.01; Fig. 2 D). In the probe trial on the last day of testing, the platform was removed. VPA treatment significantly improved the AD mouse's spatial memory. The number of times the mice traveled into the third quadrant, where the hidden platform was previously placed, was significantly greater with VPA treatment compared with control (9.56 +/- 2.62 and 4.18 +/- 1.06; P < 0.005; Fig. 2 E). These data indicate that VPA treatment significantly improves the memory deficits seen in APP23 mice. Because VPA treatment stopped a day before and there was no treatment during the behavioral testing, the effect of VPA on the behavioral performance in the mice was not just acute, but also long lasting.

VPA improves memory deficits in AD transgenic mice. A Morris water maze test consists of 1 d of visible platform tests and 4 d of hidden platform tests, plus a probe trial 24 h after the last hidden platform test. Animal movement was tracked and recorded by HVS 2020 Plus image analyzer. The 7-mo APP23 age group mice were tested after 1 mo of daily VPA (n = 30 mice) or vehicle solution (n = 30 mice) injections. (A) During the first day of visible platform tests, the VPA-treated and control APP23 mice exhibited a similar latency to escape onto the visible platform. P > 0.05 by Student's t test. (B) The VPA-treated and control APP23 mice had similar swimming distances before escaping onto the visible platform in the visible platform test. P > 0.05 by Student's t test. (C) In hidden platform tests, mice were trained with 6 trials per day for 4 d. VPA-treated APP23 mice showed a shorter latency to escape onto the hidden platform on the third and fourth day. P < 0.001 by ANOVA. (D) The VPA-treated APP23 mice had a shorter swimming length before escaping onto the hidden platform on the third and fourth day. P < 0.01 by ANOVA. (E) In the probe trial on the sixth day, the VPA-treated APP23 mice traveled into the third quadrant, where the hidden platform was previously placed, significantly more times than controls. *, P < 0.005 by Student's t test.

VPA inhibits gamma-secretase cleavage of APP and Abeta production. (A) Half brains from VPA-treated and control APP23 mice of the 7-mo age group were lysed in RIPA-Doc lysis buffer and separated with 16% Tris-Tricine SDS-PAGE. APP full-length and CTFs (C99 and C83) were detected by C20 polyclonal antibody. PS1 was detected by anti-PS1 N-terminal antibody 231. Total Abeta was isolated from the brain tissues with 4G8 monoclonal antibody and detected using 6E10 anti-Abeta monoclonal antibody. beta-Actin was detected by anti-beta-actin antibody AC-15 as the internal control. (B) Quantification showed that CTFs were significantly increased, whereas Abeta levels were markedly reduced in VPA-treated mice. n = 30 each for control and VPA group. *, P < 0.05 by Student's t test. ELISA assay was performed to measure Abeta40 (C) and Abeta42 (D) levels in the conditioned media of primary neuronal cultures derived from the brain tissues of newborn APP23/PS45 mice. The cells were cultured for a week before VPA treatment for 24 h. n = 3. *, P < 0.005 by Student's t test. (E) Swedish mutant APP stable cell line 20E2 was cultured and treated with different doses of VPA for 24 h, and cell lysates were subjected to Western blot analysis. C99 and C83 were detected with C20 antibody. beta-Actin was detected by anti-beta-actin antibody AC-15 as the internal control. (F) Quantification of CTF (C99 and C83) generation in 20E2 cells. VPA treatment significantly increased APP CTF production. n = 4. *, P < 0.001 by ANOVA. (G) APP C99 stable cell line H99C1 was treated with different doses of VPA for 24 h, and the CTFs (C99, C89, and C83) were detected by 9E10 antibody. beta-Actin was detected by anti-beta-actin antibody AC-15 as the internal control. (H) Quantification of CTFs (C99, C89, and C83) levels in H99C1 cells. VPA treatment significantly increased APP CTF production. n = 4. *, P < 0.001 by ANOVA.

Behavioral tests were also performed on the older APP23 mice administered with VPA at the age of 9 mo to assess their cognitive function. Despite a significant reduction in plaque formation, there were no significant differences in the escape latency and path length in the hidden platform trial of the Morris water maze test between the treatment and control groups (P > 0.05). Although VPA treatment only slightly improved performance in the hidden platform tests in the APP23/PS45 double-transgenic mice, VPA treatment significantly improved performance in the probe trial (7.13 +/- 0.70 and 3.43 +/- 1.13; P < 0.05).

Our data clearly demonstrated that VPA treatment inhibited neuritic plaque formation and improved the memory deficits in the AD model mice. To investigate the underlying mechanism, we examined the effect of VPA on APP processing. The level of APP C-terminal fragments (CTFs) and Abeta in the mouse brain tissues was assayed by Western blot analysis (Fig. 3 A). VPA treatment significantly increased the levels of APP CTFs. The levels of beta-secretase-generated C99 and alpha-secretase-generated C83 fragments were increased by 227.7 +/- 36.8% in the brains of VPA-treated mice relative to controls (P < 0.05; Fig. 3 B). Furthermore, the production of Abeta was significantly inhibited by VPA, and the total Abeta level was decreased to 18.71 +/- 6.24% in the brains of VPA-treated mice relative to controls (P < 0.05; Fig. 3 B). The Abeta ELISA assay was also performed to measure Abeta40 and Abeta42 levels in the transgenic brain tissues. The levels of Abeta40 and Abeta42 were reduced to 67.64 +/- 2.89 and 34.53 +/- 1.53% in VPA-treated mice relative to controls, respectively (P < 0.05). To further confirm VPA's effect on Abeta production, we measured Abeta40 and Abeta42 levels in the conditioned media of cultured primary cortical and hippocampal neurons derived from neonatal APP23/PS45 double-transgenic mice. VPA markedly reduced Abeta generation, decreasing Abeta40 and Abeta42 levels to 48.86 +/- 1.52 and 58.90 +/- 3.43%, respectively, relative to controls (P < 0.005; Fig. 3, C and D). VPA treatment had no significant effect on APP and PS1 protein levels (Fig. 3, A and B). The increased C99 and C83 levels, together with the decreased Abeta production in the brains of the VPA-treated transgenic mice, indicate that VPA inhibits gamma-secretase cleavage of APP proteins.

To examine the effect of VPA on APP processing in vitro, 20E2 and H99C1 cells were treated with VPA. Consistent with in vivo data from transgenic mouse models, VPA significantly increased APP C99 and C83 generation in 20E2 cells, which are a HEK293 stable cell line overexpressing the Swedish mutant APP (Fig. 3 E) (34), and the levels of total CTFs were increased by 140.58 +/- 5.5, 138.3 +/- 5.58, 176.7 +/- 2.73, and 179.64 +/- 4.10% with 0.5, 1.5, 5, and 10 mM of VPA treatment, respectively (P < 0.001; Fig. 3 F). To further confirm the inhibitory effect of VPA on gamma-secretase cleavage of APP, H99C1 cell line was established to stably overexpress APP C99, a major beta-secretase cleavage product of APP (Fig. S3, available at ). VPA treatment significantly increased the levels of APP CTFs, including C99, C89, and C83 (Fig. 3 G). The levels of total CTFs were increased by 200.59 +/- 4.10, 244.09 +/- 3.87, 354.36 +/- 17.30, and 400.24 +/- 17.63% with 0.5, 1.5, 5, and 10 mM of VPA treatment, respectively (P < 0.001; Fig. 3 H). These data clearly indicated that VPA inhibited gamma-secretase processing of APP C99 protein.

Our data demonstrated that VPA significantly decreased Abeta production and neuritic plaque formation in AD transgenic mice, likely by regulating APP processing through inhibition of gamma-secretase activity. To further investigate the underlying mechanism of VPA's effect, we first examined its effect on APP, BACE1, and PS1 gene expression. Our data show that VPA treatment did not change the mRNA levels of these genes (Fig. 4, A-C). Previous studies suggested that GSK-3beta regulated Abeta formation (35-37). GSK-3beta activity is regulated by its phosphorylation at the serine 9 (S9) and tyrosine 216 sites (Y216). The S9 phosphorylation (pGSK-3betaS9) inhibits GSK-3beta activity, whereas the Y216 phosphorylation (pGSK-3betaY216) up-regulates GSK-3beta activity. To examine whether GSK-3beta mediated VPA's effect on APP processing in AD transgenic model mice, brain tissues of the double-transgenic mice were subjected to Western blot analysis for total GSK-3beta and phospho-GSK-3beta levels. We found no differences in total GSK-3beta protein levels between the VPA treatment and control mice groups; however, VPA treatment also significantly increased GSK-3betaS9 levels in vivo (Fig. 4 D). Consistent with the transgenic mouse data, VPA treatment in vitro also significantly facilitated the phosphorylation of GSK-3beta at the S9 site. The level of phospho-GSK-3betaS9 in VPA-treated N2a cells was increased to 147.87 +/- 12.38 and 181.18 +/- 16.55% after 12- and 24-h treatment (P < 0.001; Fig. 4 E), whereas VPA had little effect on total GSK-3beta level in N2a cells (P > 0.05; Fig. 4 F). Further phosphorylation screening by the Kinetworks 1.3 KPSS Phospho-site Profiling revealed that pGSK-3betaY216 levels were markedly reduced by 37%. Collectively, these data suggest that VPA negatively regulates GSK-3beta activity. To examine the effect of VPA on GSK-3beta-mediated biological function, we performed a beta-catenin-Tcf reporter gene assay. Phosphorylated beta-catenin by GSK-3 is rapidly degraded by the ubiquitin proteasome pathway, therefore inhibition of GSK-3 stabilizes beta-catenin and activates downstream gene transcription. TOPFLASH, containing three copies of the optimal Tcf motif CCTTTGATC upstream of a minimal c-Fos promoter driving luciferase expression (38), were cotransfected with beta-catenin and Tcf expression plasmids into N2a cells. VPA treatment significantly potentiated beta-catenin-mediated transcriptional activation, resulting in higher promoter activity (138.80 +/- 1.37%; P < 0.005; Fig. 4 G). The up-regulatory effect of VPA was abolished when the cells were transfected with mutant beta-catenin cDNA. Collectively, our data indicate that regulation of APP processing and neuritic plaque formation by VPA may be mediated by its effect on the GSK-3beta signaling pathway.

VPA inhibits GSK-3beta activity. Total RNA was isolated from N2a cells by TRI-Reagent (Sigma-Aldrich). A set of gene-specific primers were used to amplify APP (A), BACE1 (B), and PS1 (C) genes. beta-Actin was used as an internal control. There was no difference in endogenous APP, PS1, or BACE1 mRNA levels between VPA-treated cells and controls. (D) Brain tissues from APP23/PS45 double-transgenic mice were subjected to Western blot analysis to determine the levels of total GSK-3beta and phospho-GSK-3betaS9. VPA increases phospho-GSK-3betaS9 (PSer9) levels, but not total GSK-3beta levels in the transgenic mice. (E) N2a cells were treated with 5 mM of VPA for 0, 6, 12, and 24 h and lysed in RIPA-Doc buffer containing a series of serine and tyrosine phosphatase inhibitors. The cell lysates were subjected to Western blot analysis using a rabbit anti-phospho-GSK-3betaSer-9 antibody. Kodak Image Analysis software was used to quantify protein level. n = 3. *, P < 0.001 by ANOVA. (F) Total GSK-3beta level was also measured. (G) Promoter assay. pTOPFLASH plasmid was cotransfected with pcDNA3-beta-catenin and pcDNA3-Tcf expression plasmids into N2a cells. pCMV-Rluc was also cotransfected to normalize transfection efficiency. Luciferase assay was performed 48 h after transfection. Promoter activity was indicated by the luciferase activity. VPA increased beta-catenin-Tcf mediated transcription activation. n = 4. *, P < 0.005 by Student's t test.

There has been no effective method for the treatment or prevention of AD. Inhibition of HDAC activity with pharmacological agents demonstrated limited levels of synaptogenesis and improved learning and memory (32). Preclinical studies suggested that inhibition of Abeta production by altering APP processing at the beta- or gamma-secretase site by lithium or nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs could potentially be avenues for AD drug development (30, 39, 40). Here, we show that VPA, an antiepileptic drug, can serve as a highly effective antiamyloid treatment in AD transgenic model mice. VPA can inhibit GSK-3beta, resulting in increased beta-catenin protein levels (41, 42). GSK-3beta is a key component of the Wnt signaling pathway, controlling beta-catenin levels and transcriptional responses required for development and cell growth. Consistent with previous reports, we found that VPA inhibited GSK-3beta activity by altering its phosphorylation state. VPA was also found to inhibit HDAC activity (29), which could improve learning and memory (32). Previous reports showed that VPA treatment not only induced synapsin I clustering in developing axons but also increased axonal branching and formation of curved axons (43). We show that VPA not only inhibits neuritic plaque formation but also promotes neurite outgrowth in the transgenic mice.

There have been VPA clinical trials conducted on AD patients. Profenno et al. reported that doses of <1,000 mg/d of divalproex sodium could be tolerated by patients in a Safety and Tolerability trial of 20 outpatients with probable AD (44). In a clinical trial conducted on 14 moderate to severe institutionalized AD patients with a mean age of 85.6 yr that assessed VPA's effect on agitation and aggression, VPA treatment was found to be ineffective for the management of agitation and aggression (45). These reports had little data that addressed VPA's effect on AD pathogenesis, neuropathology, and cognitive impairments. Consistent with a previous work which showed that both lithium and VPA inhibited Abeta production in a Swedish mutant APP751 stable cell line and PDAPP (APPV717F) transgenic mice (37), we systematically demonstrated that in two different transgenic AD mouse models, VPA has significant beneficial effects on AD pathogenesis. VPA reduced gamma-secretase cleavage of APP and Abeta production in vitro and in vivo, resulting in the prevention of AD-associated pathological outcomes. Furthermore, our data showed that early administration of VPA not only reduced neuritic plaque formation, but also rescued some memory deficits in AD transgenic mice. Meanwhile, we found that the inhibitory effect of VPA on neuritic plaque formation was present up to 2 mo after discontinuing administration of VPA, indicating VPA's long lasting antiamyloid treatment potential for AD patients. However, when mice were treated with VPA at a later stage, when there was profound neuritic plaque formation, VPA could still reduce further neuritic plaque formation, albeit a lesser effect on improving memory deficits in the older mice. Our preclinical animal study indicated that VPA can have effects on neuropathology changes at early and late stages, but cognitive impairments can only be improved at an early stage intervention. These data suggest that VPA treatment should be applied at early stages of AD pathogenesis for effective improvement of pathological and cognitive impairments. This information may also provide insights for VPA clinical trial designs. Our animal study suggests that the VPA trial might not show beneficial results on late or severe AD patients, whereas it might show significant improvements in early or mild AD patients.

Animal experiment protocols were approved by The University of British Columbia Animal Care and Use committee. APP23 transgenic mice carry human APP751 cDNA with the Swedish double mutation at positions 670/671 (KM-->NL) under control of the murine Thy-1.2 expression cassette (33). PS45 transgenic mice carry human presenilin-1 cDNA with the M146V mutation. The genotype of the mice was confirmed by PCR using DNA from tail tissues. Mice were injected with 30 mg/kg VPA i.p. at the same time each day. Control mice were injected with PBS as a vehicle. We tabulated daily food and water consumption for each mouse.

The water maze test was performed in a 1.5-m-diam pool. A 10-cm-diam platform was placed in the southeastern quadrant in the hidden trials. The procedure consisted of 1 d of visible platform tests and 4 d of hidden platform tests, plus a probe trial 24 h after the last hidden platform test. In the visible platform test, mice were tested for 5 contiguous trials, with an intertrial interval of 30 min. In the hidden platform tests, mice were trained for 6 trials, with an intertrial interval of 1 h. Tracking of animal movement was achieved with an HVS 2020 Plus image analyzer (HVS Image). The data were analyzed by two-way ANOVA.

Mice were killed after behavioral testing, and one half of the brains were immediately homogenized for protein, RNA, or DNA extraction. The other half of the brains were fixed in freshly depolymerized 4% paraformaldehyde and sectioned with a Cryostat (Leica) to 30 mum thickness. Every sixth slice with the same reference position was mounted onto slides for staining. Immunocytochemical staining was performed on floating sections. The slices were immunostained with biotinylated monoclonal 4G8 antibody (Signet Laboratories) in 1:500 dilution. Plaques were visualized by the ABC and DAB method and counted under microscopy at 40x magnification. Plaques were quantitated, and the mean plaque count per slice was recorded for each mouse. The data were analyzed by two-way ANOVA. Thioflavin S staining of plaques was performed with 1% thioflavin S, and the green fluorescence-stained plaques were visualized using fluorescence microscopy. For MAP-2 staining, sections were immunostained with anti-MAP-2 (Signet Laboratories).

All cells were maintained at 37degreesC in an incubator containing 5% CO2. The 20E2 cell line is a Swedish mutant APP stable HEK cell line. Cells were transfected with plasmid DNA using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). HEK293 cells were stably transfected with pZ-C99mycHis to generate the H99C1 cell line. H99C1 cells stably overexpress APP C99, a major beta-secretase product of APP. The mycHis-tagged C99 protein in H99C1 cells can be detected by both anti-myc 9E10 antibody and anti-APP C-terminal antibody C20. For primary neuronal cultures, hippocampal and neocortical tissues were removed from newborn mice at postnatal day 1, and gently digested with trypsin (0.025% EDTA; Invitrogen). The cells were suspended in neurobasal medium supplemented with B27 (Invitrogen) and plated at a density of 2 x 106 cells per 35-mm plate coated with 0.01 mg/ml poly-d-lysine (Sigma-Aldrich). Tails from the newborn mice were used to isolate genomic DNA for genotyping. The primary cultures were maintained at 37degreesC in a humidified incubator containing 5% CO2. For the beta-catenin-mediated transcriptional activation assay, pTOPFLASH plasmid was cotransfected with pcDNA3-beta-catenin and pcDNA3-Tcf expression plasmids into N2a cells. The Renilla (sea pansy) luciferase vector pCMV-Rluc was cotransfected to normalize transfection efficiency. Luciferase assay was performed 48 h after transfection with Dual-Luciferase Reporter Assay system (Promega), as previously described (2).
