We previously reported that phosphorylation of topoisomerase (topo) IIalpha at serine-1106 (Ser-1106) regulates enzyme activity and sensitivity to topo II-targeted drugs. In this study we demonstrate that phosphorylation of Ser-1106, which is flanked by acidic amino acids, is regulated in vivo by casein kinase (CK) Idelta and/or CKIepsilon, but not by CKII. The CKI inhibitors, CKI-7 and IC261, reduced Ser-1106 phosphorylation and decreased formation of etoposide-stabilized topo II-DNA cleavable complex. In contrast, the CKII inhibitor, 5,6-dichlorobenzimidazole riboside, did not affect etoposide-stabilized topo II-DNA cleavable complex formation. Since, IC261 specifically targets the Ca2+-regulated isozymes, CKIdelta and CKIepsilon, we examined the effect of down-regulating these enzymes on Ser-1106 phosphorylation. Down-regulation of these isozymes with targeted si-RNAs led to hypophosphorylation of the Ser-1106 containing peptide. However, si-RNA-mediated down-regulation of CKIIalpha and alpha' did not alter Ser-1106 phosphorylation. Furthermore, reduced phosphorylation of Ser-1106, observed in HRR25 (CKIdelta/epsilon homologous gene)-deleted Saccharomyces cerevisiae cells transformed with human topo IIalpha, was enhanced following expression of human CKIepsilon. Down-regulation of CKIdelta and CKIepsilon also led to reduced formation of etoposide stabilized topo II-DNA cleavable complex. These results provide strong support for an essential role of CKIdelta/epsilon in phosphorylating Ser-1106 in human topo IIalpha and in regulating enzyme function.

Type II DNA topoisomerases, topoisomerase II (topo II) alpha and beta, regulate DNA topology by creating transient double stranded DNA breaks (1-3). Although, both enzymes exhibit significant sequence homology and catalyze redundant catalytic reactions, they are involved in different cellular functions. This difference may in part be due to differential regulation of these enzymes. Several different mechanisms have been shown to regulate topo II activity, including transcriptional, translational, as well as post-translational mechanisms. The major post-translational mechanisms that modulate topo II activity are phosphorylation, interaction with other proteins and proteasome-mediated degradation (1-3).

Both topo IIalpha and topo IIbeta are phosphorylated at several sites, primarily in the divergent C-terminal region (4-8). Whereas, little is known about site-specific phosphorylation of topo IIbeta, several in vitro and in vivo studies have identified specific phosphorylation sites in topo IIalpha. Within the C-terminal region of topo IIalpha phosphorylation of threonine-1342, serine(Ser)-1376, Ser-1469 and Ser-1524 catalyzed by casein kinase (CK) II (6,9-14), and of Ser-1212, Ser-1246, Ser-1353, Ser-1360 and Ser-1392 catalyzed by a proline directed kinase has been observed (15). Recently, it has been reported that Polo-like kinase 1 phosphorylates topo IIalpha at Ser-1337 and Ser-1524 (16). In addition to the sites in the C-terminal region, phosphorylation of Ser-29 located in the ATP binding domain within the N-terminal region (17) and of Ser-1106 located within the catalytic core have also been reported (18). Whereas phosphorylation of Ser-29 is catalyzed by protein kinase C (17), the kinase responsible for phosphorylation of Ser-1106 has not yet been identified.

Since Ser-1106 is located in the catalytic domain of topo IIalpha and phosphorylation of this site enhances enzyme activity and sensitivity to topo II-targeted drugs in vivo (18), it is important to decipher the mechanism by which phosphorylation of Ser-1106 is regulated. The first step toward determining this mechanism would be to identify the kinase(s) that catalyzes phosphorylation at this site. Based on the acidic amino acid sequences that flank Ser-1106 at the amino- and carboxy-terminus, two potential kinases that could phosphorylate this site are CKI and CKII (19). Although CKII has been recognized as a major kinase phosphorylating topo IIalpha, the role of CKI in phosphorylating topo IIalpha has not been explored. Unlike CKII, which consists of a tetramer of two catalytic subunits, alpha and/or alpha', and two regulatory beta subunits (20-22), human CKI comprises of a superfamily of seven different isozymes that function as monomers (23,24). Structurally these isozymes, CKIalpha, beta, gamma1, gamma2, gamma3, delta and epsilon, are organized into three distinct regions - a short N-terminal region, a highly conserved kinase domain and a highly variable C-terminal domain, primarily involved in regulating enzyme function. The CKIdelta and CKIepsilon isozymes are very similar in structure and exhibit 98% homology in the kinase domain and 50% homology in the C-terminal domain. Autophosphorylation of the C-terminal domain leads to inhibition of the enzyme, which can be relieved following dephosphorylation or proteolytic cleavage of this region, often via a Ca2+-dependent mechanism (25,26). Indeed, it has been suggested that dephosphorylation of CKIepsilon by the Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent phosphatase, calcineurin, enhances phosphorylation of DARP-32 by this isozyme (27,28).

Our earlier studies demonstrating a Ca2+-dependent mechanism in regulating phosphorylation of Ser-1106 and in modulating sensitivity to topo II-targeted drugs (18) suggested that the kinase responsible for phosphorylating this site may be CKIdelta and/or CKIepsilon, rather than CKII. In this study we examined the role of CKIdelta/epsilon and CKII in phosphorylating Ser-1106 by attenuating the activity of these kinases with specific inhibitors or with targeted si-RNAs. Our results demonstrated that CKIdelta/epsilon, but not CKII, catalyzes the in vivo phosphorylation of Ser-1106 and regulates topo II-DNA cleavage activity.

A 21-nucleotide duplex si-RNA (si-CKIdelta/epsilon) with the sequence sense: 5'-CUGGGGAAGAAGGGCAACCdTdT-3' and antisense: 5'-GGUUGCCCUUCUUCCCCAGdTdT-3', purchased from Qiagen, Valencia, CA, USA was used to target identical regions in CKIdelta and CKIepsilon (29). In addition the On-Target plus SMART pool si-RNA anti-CSNKID human (si-CKIdelta) and On-Target plus SMART pool si-RNA anti-CSNKIE human (si-CKIepsilon) were purchased from Dharmacon, Lafayette, CO. For targeting CKIIalpha RNA the siGENOM SMART pool CSNK2A1 (Dharmacon, Lafayette, CO) was employed. The CKIIalpha' si-RNA (sense: 5'-CAGUCUGAGGAGCCGCGAGdTdT-3', antisense: 5'-CGGCUCCUCAGACUGdTdT-3'), previously described (30) was synthesized by MWG Biotech, Ebersberg, Germany. The control si-RNA (5'-GCUCAGAUCAAUACGGAGAdT dT-3') was purchased from Dharmacon, Lafayette, CO. HCT-116 cells were incubated in serum-free McCoy's medium for 6-10 h with the si-RNA (100 nM) in the presence of Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen Life Technology, Carlsbad, CA) as described by the manufacturer. When the combination of si-CKIdelta and si-CKIepsilon was employed, the concentration of each si-RNA was reduced to 75 nM. Following the initial incubation, cells were washed and cultured in McCoy's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum and 2 mM l-glutamine for 24 h. At the end of the incubation period, cells were harvested for preparing cell lysates. When cells were transfected with si-CKIdelta/epsilon about 50-70% of the cells that readily detached upon washing were used for preparing lysates for 2D-phosphopeptide maps of topo IIalpha, since both CKIdelta and CKIepsilon were maximally down-regulated in this population.

Control transformations were carried out with the pHT212 plasmid (LEU2). Cells transformed with the pHT212 plasmid or pHT212 plasmid with the human topo IIalpha insert were selected on plates lacking leucine (18). The HRR25Delta isolate expressing human topo IIalpha was transfomed with the human CKIepsilon cDNA, (kindly provided by Dr Jeff Kuret, Ohio State University, Columbus, OH), which was inserted in MluI and XbaI restriction sites of the modified pRS316 plasmid, YEpRS316. The YEpRS316 plasmid was constructed by insertion of the ScaI fragment from pYEpWOB6 which contains the 2 mum origin. Control transformations were carried out with the YEpRS316 plasmid (LEU2 and URA3). The transformed cells were selected on plates lacking leucine and uracil.

Log phase cultures of HL-60 or HCT-116 cells were incubated in phosphate-free RPMI-1640 supplemented with 10% dialyzed fetal bovine serum and 2 mM glutamine for 1 h at 37degreesC. Cells were then labeled with carrier-free [32P] orthophosphoric acid (MP Biomedicals, Irvine, CA) for an additional 3 h. During the labeling period, the CKI or CKII inhibitor was added for experiments involving these treatments. Yeast cells were labeled as previously described (18). Briefly, cells cultured overnight at 30degreesC with shaking (250 rpm) in synthetic dropout liquid medium lacking leucine were incubated in YPDA without phosphate medium, for 3 h with shaking, to a cell density corresponding to 0.6 units (A600). Following centrifugation, cells were resuspended into 20 ml of YPDA medium without phosphate containing 5 mCi of [32P]-orthophosphoric acid and incubated at 30degreesC for 1 h with shaking.

Lysates of HL-60 and HCT-116 cells were prepared in radioimmunoprecipitation assay (RIPA) buffer as described earlier (18). Topo IIalpha protein immunoprecipitated from the cell lysate was subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and transferred to nitrocellulose membrane (18). The membrane was stained with Gelcode Blue staining reagent (Pierce Chemical Co., Rockford, IL) to visualize the topo IIalpha band, which was excised and processed for proteolysis with cyanogen bromide (CNBr) or trypsin (18). For determination of down-regulation of CKIdelta and CKIepsilon, western blot analysis was carried out on cell lysates (20-40 mug) prepared from si-RNA transfected cells that were harvested just prior to labeling with [32P]-orthophosphoric acid (32). Cell lysate of S. cerevisiae cells were prepared in Y-PER lysis buffer after freezing the cell pellet in liquid nitrogen and human topo IIalpha present in the lysate was purified by Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid essentially as described earlier (18). Purified topo IIalpha was subjected to SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose membrane and the stained topo IIalpha band was processed for phosphopetide mapping.

The 170 kDa 32P-labeled topo IIalpha band visualized by staining with Gelcode Blue staining reagent on the nitrocellulose membrane was excised and digested with trypsin essentially as described earlier (18). Following extensive washing of the membrane in water, topo IIalpha was proteolytically cleaved with 5 mug of trypsin-TPCK treated (Worthington Biochemical, Freehold, NJ) or with 2 mug of trypsin Gold(R) (Promega Inc., Madison, WI) in 1% ammonium bicarbonate, pH 8.3 at 37degreesC for 14-16 h. In initial experiments involving treatment with CKI inhibitors, proteolytic digestion with TPCK-treated trypsin consistently led to generation of two Ser-1106 containing peptides due to partial proteolysis (Figure 1B), whereas in subsequent experiments trypsinization with highly purified trypsin Gold(R) consistently led to generation of a single Ser-1106 containing peptide. The tryptic peptides released in the ammonium bicarbonate solution were transferred to fresh microcentrifuge tube and the membrane piece was washed with 100 mul of 20% acetonitrile. The pooled eluate and washings were then concentrated by evaporation in a Savant Speed-Vac, washed three times with water and the peptides solubilized in pH 1.9 buffer (88% formic acid/glacial acetic acid/deionized water, 1:3.1:36, v/v). The peptides were then separated on thin layer cellulose plates by electrophoresis with pH 1.9 buffer in the horizontal dimension and chromatography in the vertical dimension (33). In initial experiments the phospho-chromatography buffer contained n-butanol/pyridine/acetic acid/deionized water (5/3.3/1/4, v/v). To improve migration of the Ser-1106-peptide an isobutyric acid buffer (isobutyric acid/n-butanol/pyridine/acetic acid/deionized water) (32.9/1/2.5/1.5/14.7, v/v), which resolves extremely hydrophilic phosphopeptides, was used.

LC-MS was carried out on tryptic digests of stained topo IIalpha protein band excised from SDS-polyacrylamide gels. In-gel trypsin digestion was carried out as described earlier (34). Briefly, following washing/destaining in two aliquots of 50% ethanol/5% acetic acid (v/v), reduction with dithiothreitol and alkylation with iodoacetamide, the excised gel pieces were dried in a Speed-vac and incubated with 30 mul of 20 ng/mul trypsin in 50 mM ammonium bicarbonate on ice for 10 min. Any excess trypsin solution was then removed and 20 mul of 50 mM ammonium bicarbonate was added. Following overnight digestion at room temperature, the peptides were extracted from polyacrylamide pieces in two 30 mul aliquots of 50% acetonitrile/5% formic acid (v/v). These extracts were combined and evaporated to approximately5 mul and then reconstituted in 1% acetic acid to a total volume of 25 mul for LC-MS analysis. The tryptic peptides in the extract (2 mul/injection) were separated by reversed-phase LC in a 10 cm x 50 mum (i.d.) Phenomenex Jupiter 10 mum C18 self-packed capillary column using a linear gradient of 2-70% acetonitrile containing 0.05 M acetic acid in 50 min at a constant flow rate of 0.2 mul/min. The effluent was analyzed using a Finnigan LCQ-Deca ion trap mass spectrometry system equipped with a Protana microelectrospray ion source (ThermoFisher, San Jose, CA) operated at 2.5 kV. Data interpretation was performed with the programs TurboSequest and Mascot. All matching spectra were verified by manual interpretation.

Selected reaction monitoring (SRM) mode was used to compare the extent of Ser-1106 phosphorylation in control scrambled si-RNA and si-CKIdelta/epsilon treated HCT-116 cells. The SRM experiment consisted of a 5-scan event analysis in which one scan event was a standard MS scan and the other four were different SRM descriptors directed to various sets of control or Ser-1106 containing peptides, both unphosphorylated and phosphorylated. To verify peptide recovery from the digestion procedure and the mass spectrometry response, one ion of the trypsin autolysis peptide VATVSLPR at m/z 422 (+2) and one ion of the unmodified topo IIalpha native peptide EVTFVPGLYK at m/z 577 (+2) were monitored. These two descriptors served as controls. In addition, the ion transition m/z 484 --> m/z 435 (+2) characteristic for phosphate loss from phosphorylated Ser-29 contained in RLpS29VER peptide in topo IIalpha was monitored to confirm general phosphorylation of every sample. To determine the status of Ser-1106 phosphorylation, the peptide VPDEEENEES1106DNEKETEK containing phosphorylated Ser-1106 as doubly charged (m/z 1116) or triply charged (m/z 744) ion and their corresponding unphosphorylated peptide ions were monitored.

The effect of etoposide on forming a stable topo II-DNA cleavable complex was determined by measuring the amount of precipitated protein-DNA complex and by evaluating depletion of topo IIalpha not complexed with DNA (band depletion). For measuring precipitated protein-DNA complex, cells were labeled for 24 h with 0.02-0.04 muCi/ml of [14C]-thymidine, specific activity 53 mCi/mmol (Amersham, Arlington Heights, IL). For measuring DNA cleavable complex in cells down-regulated for CKIdelta plus CKIepsilon, cells were treated for 6 h with scrambled si-RNA or si-CKIdelta plus si-CKIepsilon prior to labeling. Cells were then trypsinized, treated with etoposide for 1 h and the precipitated protein-DNA complex was assayed as previously described (35). For the band depletion experiment cells were treated similarly without the addition of [14C]-thymidine. Cell lysates were prepared in 2-fold concentrated LDS-sample buffer (Invitrogen Life Technology, Carlsbad, CA, USA). The lysates were incubated at 70degreesC for 10 min, sonicated and centrifuged at 12 000 x g. An aliquot (10-15 mul) of the lysate was subjected to western blot analysis. The membranes were probed with antibodies to topo IIalpha and topo I (internal control), which does not form a stabilized DNA cleavable complex with the topo II-targeted drug, etoposide. Down-regulation of CKIdelta and CKIepsilon was also determined by western blotting with antibodies specific for CKIdelta and CKIepsilon.

The presence of acidic amino-acid residues N-terminal to Ser-1106 and the Ca2+-dependency of phosphorylation of this site (18) suggested that phosphorylation of Ser-1106 may be regulated by protein kinase CKIdelta and/or CKIepsilon. Therefore we first examined whether two CKI inhibitors, CKI-7 and IC261, specific for CKIdelta and CKIepsilon (36), altered phosphorylation of Ser-1106 containing peptides. Treatment of HL-60 cells with CKI-7 or IC261 led to hypophosphorylation of the CNBr (peptide 34) and tryptic phosphopeptides that were previously shown to harbor Ser-1106 (Figures 1A and 1B, respectively). Comparison of the intensity of spots corresponding to the peptides containing Ser-1106 (normalized to two other peptides) revealed that CKI-7 and IC-261 led to comparable decreases (20-40% and 25-30%, respectively) in phosphorylation of Ser-1106 as compared to untreated control cells. To determine whether decreased phosphorylation observed in the presence of CKI-7 or IC261 compromises the functional activity of topo IIalpha, we examined the effect of CKI-7 and IC261 on formation of etoposide stabilized topo II-DNA cleavable complex. Pre-treatment of HL-60 cells with 200 muM CKI-7 or 10 muM IC261 for 3 h prior to treatment with 5 muM etoposide for 1 h led to a significant (P < 0.05) decrease in the formation of etoposide-stabilized DNA cleavable complex (Figure 2). We also examined the effect of the CKII specific inhibitor, DRB, on formation of etoposide stabilized topo II-DNA cleavable complex. Pretreatment with 40 muM DRB did not alter etoposide stabilized topo II-DNA cleavable complex formation (Figure 2). These results suggest a role for CKIdelta/epsilon in regulating the functional activity of topo IIalpha via phosphorylation at Ser-1106. Figure 2.The CKI inhibitors, CKI-7 and IC261, but not the CKII inhibitor, DRB, decrease formation of etoposide-stabilized topo II-DNA cleavable complex. HL60 cells labeled overnight with 14C-thymidine were pre-incubated in the absence or presence of CKI-7 (200 muM), IC261 (10 muM) or DRB (40 muM) for 3 h at 37degreesC. Cells were then washed, resuspended in inhibitor-free medium and incubated for an additional hour in etoposide (5 muM). Control, labeled cells were incubated in the presence of medium alone. The labeled DNA was precipitated with SDS-KCl as described in Materials and methods section and the dpm in the precipitate was determined by liquid scintillation counting. DNA cleavable complex formation in the etoposide or inhibitor --> etoposide treatment was determined by calculating the ratio of dpm in treated cells to control cells. *Significantly (P < 0.05) lower than treatment with etoposide alone.

To confirm the role of CKIdelta and/or CKIepsilon in phosphorylating Ser-1106 we down-regulated these two enzymes with three different sets of si-RNAs. These included si-CKIdelta/epsilon-which targeted the nucleotide sequence (412-430) that is identical in the CKIdelta and CKIepsilon coding region; si-CKIdelta-which is a smart pool targeted to the CKIdelta isozyme; and si-CKIepsilon-which is a smart pool targeted to the CKIepsilon isozyme. The si-CKIdelta and si-CKIepsilon were used individually to down-regulate the specific isozyme or used in combination to simultaneously down-regulate both isozymes. Since, HL-60 cells are difficult to transfect we used the colon carcinoma cell line, HCT-116, for transfection of the si-RNAs. This cell line was chosen because it can be readily transfected and the phosphopeptide map of topo IIalpha in HCT-116 cells is similar to that in HL-60 cells (data not shown). Transfection of the three si-RNAs in HCT-116 cells led to significant down-regulation (approximately60-80%) of the targeted isozyme; si-CKIdelta/epsilon and the combination of si-CKIdelta and si-CKIepsilon led to down-regulation of both CKIdelta and CKIepsilon, whereas si-CKIdelta or si-CKIepsilon when used individually, down-regulated only the targeted enzyme CKIdelta or CKIepsilon, respectively (Figures 3A, 5A and 8A). When both CKIdelta and CKIepsilon were down-regulated a slight increase in the G2 + M phase of the cell cycle was observed (data not shown). Figure 3.Phosphorylation of the topo IIalpha peptide containing Ser-1106 is reduced in HCT-116 cells transfected with si-CKIdelta/epsilon, but not in nocadazole treated cells arrested in the G2+M phase of the cell cycle.

The down-regulation of CKIdelta and CKIepsilon in HCT-116 cells transfected with si-CKIdelta/epsilon resulted in significantly decreased (75%) phosphorylation of the tryptic Ser-1106 containing phosphopeptide, as compared to cells transfected with the control scrambled si-RNA (Figure 3B). This was not due to an increase in the G2 + M population observed in cells transfected with si-CKIdelta/epsilon, since phosphorylation at Ser-1106 was not affected when cells were blocked in mitosis following treatment with nocadazole (Figure 3C). Comparison of phosphorylation of Ser-1106 in topo IIalpha present in cells transfected with scrambled si-RNA or si-CKIdelta/epsilon by LC-MS (Figure 4) revealed findings that were similar to those obtained by 2D-phosphopeptide mapping. Although both phosphorylated and unphosphorylated Ser-1106 was detected in control cells transfected with scrambled si-RNA, only unphosphorylated Ser-1106 was detected in cells transfected with si-CKIdelta/epsilon. Down-regulation of only one isozyme, CKIdelta or CKIepsilon (Figure 5A), also led to hypophosphorylation of the Ser-1106 containing peptide (Figures 5B and 5C, respectively), albeit to a lesser extent than that observed when both CKIdelta and CKIepsilon were down-regulated (Figure 3B). In cells treated with si-CKIdelta, phosphorylation of Ser-1106 was 25-40% less than that observed in cells treated with scrambled si-RNA, whereas in cells treated with si-CKIepsilon phosphorylation of Ser-1106 was 40-65% less than that observed in cells treated with scrambled si-RNA. Differential hypophosphorylation of Ser-1106 in si-CKIdelta and si-CKIepsilon transfected cells could be due to differences in the effectiveness of the two isozymes in phosphorylating this site or due to differential down-regulation of CKIdelta (approximately60%) and CKIepsilon (approximately80%).

To confirm that phosphorylation of Ser-1106 in vivo does not involve CKII we examined the effect of transfecting HCT-116 cells with si-RNAs to CKIIalpha and CKIIalpha' on phosphorylation of Ser-1106. Results of this experiment revealed that transfectants, in which CKIIalpha and CKIIalpha' were significantly down-regulated (Figure 6A), did not exhibit altered phosphorylation of Ser-1106 although phosphorylation of other tryptic peptides previously reported to be substrates for casein kinase II (6) was reduced (Figure 6B). Figure 6.Down-regulation of CKIIalpha and alpha' with targeted si-RNAs does not alter phosphorylation of the topo IIalpha peptide containing Ser-1106. An aliquot of HCT-116 cells transfected with scrambled si-RNA or si-CKIIalpha plus si-CKIIalpha', as described in Materials and methods section, were lysed in RIPA buffer and subjected to western blot analysis to determine down-regulation of CKIIalpha and CKIIalpha' (A). The remaining cells were labeled with [32P] orthophosphoric acid for 3 h. Cell lysates prepared in RIPA buffer were immunoprecipitated with topo IIalpha-specific antibodies, subjected to SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membrane. The stained topo IIalpha band was excised, proteolysed with trypsin and the labeled tryptic peptides analyzed by 2D-phosphopeptide mapping (B).

Since human topo IIalpha expressed in S. cerevisiae cells is phosphorylated at Ser-1106 (18) and the S. cerevisiae gene, HRR25 is homologous to CKIdelta and CKIepsilon (37), we compared phosphorylation of Ser-1106 in WT or HRR25Delta cells transformed with human topo IIalpha. As shown in Figure 7A, phosphorylation of the tryptic Ser-1106 peptide was significantly reduced in HRR25Delta cells. Transformation of the HRR25Delta cells expressing human topo IIalpha with human CKIepsilon enhanced phosphorylation at Ser-1106 (Figure 7B). This finding provides further support for the role of CKIdelta/epsilon, in particular the CKIepsilon isozyme, in regulating phosphorylation at Ser-1106 in topo IIalpha.

We previously demonstrated a functional role for Ser-1106 phosphorylation in topo IIalpha, based on the observation that mutation of Ser-1106 to alanine in human topo IIalpha led to decreased topo IIalpha function in vitro and in vivo in JN394 yeast cells transformed with human topo IIalpha (18). In this study we examined whether topo IIalpha function is affected when phosphorylation at Ser-1106 is altered by down-regulating the kinase(s), CKIdelta and/or CKIepsilon, involved in phosphorylating this residue. Down-regulation of CKIdelta and CKIepsilon by si-CKIdelta plus si-CKIepsilon (Figure 8A) led to a significant (P < 0.01) decrease in SDS-KCl precipitable 14C-thymidine labeled etoposide stabilized topo II-DNA cleavable complex (Figure 8B). Since, formation of a stable topo IIalpha-DNA cleavable complex in the presence of etoposide leads to depletion of topo IIalpha not complexed with DNA, we also determined the amount of topo IIalpha in lysates of control or etoposide-treated HCT-116 cells that were transiently transfected with scrambled si-RNA or si-CKIdelta plus si-CKIepsilon. In cells transfected with si-CKIdelta plus si-CKIepsilon depletion of topo IIalpha following treatment with etoposide was less (approximately40-50%) than that observed in cells transfected with scrambled si-RNA (Figure 8C). This finding corroborates the previous data demonstrating decreased formation of the etoposide stabilized topo II-DNA cleavable complex in cells transfected with si-CKIdelta plus si-CKIepsilon. These results indicate that CKIdelta and/or CKIepsilon are involved in regulating topo IIalpha function via phosphorylation at Ser-1106.

In the present study we identify CKIdelta and/or CKIepsilon as upstream kinase(s) regulating in vivo phosphorylation of topo IIalpha at Ser-1106 and thereby modulating the DNA cleavage activity of the enzyme. The role of CKIdelta and/or CKIepsilon in phosphorylating Ser-1106 is based on several lines of experimental evidence. In vivo phosphorylation of the tryptic peptide that contains Ser-1106 is decreased when CKIdelta and/or CKIepsilon are inhibited by the CKI inhibitors, CKI-7 and IC261 (specific for CKIdelta/epsilon), or when CKIdelta and CKIepsilon are down-regulated by targeted si-RNAs. Similarly, in human topo IIalpha expressing HRR25 (CKIdelta and CKIepsilon homologous gene) deleted S. cerevisiae cells, the tryptic peptide containing Ser-1106 is also hypophosphorylated, and phosphorylation at this site can be enhanced following transformation of these cells with human CKIepsilon. The decrease in phosphorylation of the Ser-1106 tryptic peptide is indeed due to reduced phosphorylation at this site, since our earlier studies indicated that in vivo phosphorylation of this tryptic peptide was not observed when Ser-1106 in topo IIalpha was mutated to alanine (18). Furthermore, LC-MS analysis of phosphorylated Ser-1106 in topo IIalpha obtained from HCT-116 cells treated with scrambled si-RNA or si-CKIdelta/epsilon revealed the presence of phosphorylated Ser-1106 only in scrambled si-RNA treated cells.

The decrease in phosphorylation at Ser-1106 observed in cells exhibiting reduced kinase activity of CKIdelta and CKIepsilon correlates with a decrease in topo IIalpha function. Inhibition of the CKI activity in cells treated with CKI inhibitors, CKI-7 or IC-261 leads to reduced formation of topo II-drug DNA complex in vivo. Similarly, when CKIdelta and CKIepsilon are down-regulated by targeted si-RNAs, formation of the etoposide stabilized topo II-DNA cleavable complex is reduced. These results indicate that the phosphorylation at Ser-1106 catalyzed by CKIdelta and/or CKIepsilon enhances the in vivo DNA cleavage activity of topo IIalpha.

Several different kinases, including CKII, protein kinase C, proline directed kinases e.g. cdc2 and Polo-like kinase 1 have been reported to phosphorylate topo IIalpha (6,9-17). However, this is the first report demonstrating CKI as a physiologically relevant kinase that modulates phosphorylation and activity of topo IIalpha. Our data demonstrating decreased phosphorylation of several peptides (excluding the Ser-1106 containing peptide) following down-regulation of CKIIalpha and CKIIalpha' with targeted si-RNAs provides evidence that CKII is also capable of phosphorylating topo IIalpha in vivo. However, phosphorylation at CKII sites does not significantly affect sensitivity to topoII-targeted drugs, since treatment of HL-60 cells with the CKII inhibitor, DRB, did not significantly alter formation of topo II-drug-DNA complex in vivo. Since our study did not evaluate the effect of reduced phosphorylation at CKII sites on other functions of topo IIalpha, the functional role of phosphorylations at CKII sites remains unclear. It is possible that phosphorylation at CKII sites, most of which map to regions in the C-terminal domain, along with other phosphorylations within this region regulate accessibility of the catalytic site to its substrate. This mechanism would be analogous to that described for regulation of the activity of CKIdelta and CKIepsilon, wherein dephosphorylation of the C-terminal region activates the enzyme.

Our previous data demonstrating Ca2+-dependent phosphorylation of Ser-1106 (18), provides further support for the role of CKIdelta and/or CKIepsilon (Ca2+-regulatable enzymes), but not CKII, as physiologic kinases that modulate Ser-1106 phosphorylation. Although, the catalytic activity of CKIdelta and CKIepsilon does not require Ca2+, these enzymes can be regulated via Ca2+-dependent dephosphorylation or proteolysis (25,26). In neostriatal neurons, the metabotrophic glutamate receptors activate CKIepsilon by dephosphorylating the inhibitory C-terminal autophosphorylation sites by the Ca2+-dependent phosphatase, calcineurin (38). The activated CKIepsilon then leads to phosphorylation of Ser-137 of DARPP-32. A scenario similar to that described in neostriatal muscles, could explain how phosphorylation of Ser-1106 is regulated by Ca2+. Dephosphorylation by calcineurin and subsequent activation of CKIdelta and/or CKIepsilon could result in phosphorylation of Ser-1106. Alternatively, a Ca2+-dependent protease, e.g. calpain, which is activated by calcium influx in neurons (27,39), could remove the inhibitory domain in CKIdelta or CKIepsilon and lead to activation of these kinases.

CKI isozymes are involved in regulating several different cellular processes (40). The CKIdelta and CKIepsilon isozymes have been shown to modulate the development process because of their role in the wnt signaling pathway. In addition, these isozymes play a role in circadian rhythm, cell division, apoptosis and neurodegenerative diseases. CKIdelta and CKIepsilon phosphorylate p53, tubulin and microtubule-associated proteins to regulate cell growth, chromosome segregation and stress response at the spindle apparatus and the mitotic centrosome. The identification of topo IIalpha, which is also involved in regulating DNA replication and cell division, chromosome segregation and DNA repair, as another nuclear substrate of CKIdelta and/or CKIepsilon in this study, suggests that these CKI isozymes may be essential for regulating various aspects of DNA metabolism. In this regard, topo IIalpha could function as part of a protein complex that comprises of transcription factors, nuclear regulatory proteins and kinases (including CKIdelta and/or CKIepsilon)/phosphatases that regulate phosphorylation/dephosphorylation of components of the complex. Thus, it would be important to determine whether CKIdelta or CKIepsilon is capable of associating with topo IIalpha.

In summary our results demonstrate that CKIdelta and/or CKIepsilon are physiologically relevant kinase(s) that are involved in regulating site-specific phosphorylation at Ser-1106 and modulating the function of topo IIalpha. Since Ser-1106 phosphorylation regulates sensitivity of cells to topo II-targeted drugs and expression of CKIdelta and/or CKIepsilon can be altered in cancer cells, one potential mechanism by which tumor cells develop resistance to topo II-targeted drugs could involve decrease in expression or activation of CKIdelta and/or CKIepsilon. The correlation of Ser-1106 hypophosphorylation with etoposide resistance was not only observed in cell culture model systems but was also seen in blast cells isolated from patients with acute myelogenous leukemia. Comparison of Ser-1106 phosphorylation with etoposide induced apoptosis revealed that reduced phosphorylation at Ser-1106 was associated with decreased apoptosis (data not shown). Thus, it might be possible to identify sensitivity of tumors to topo IIalpha-targeting drugs by characterizing phosphorylation at Ser-1106 or by determining the expression level or activity of CKIdelta and CKIepsilon in tumor samples.
