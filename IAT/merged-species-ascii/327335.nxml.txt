The DNA sequence of a chicken genomal fragment containing a histone H2A gene has been determined. It contains extensive 5' and 3' flanking regions and encodes a protein identical in sequence to the histone H2A protein isolated from chicken erythrocytes. In the 5' flanking region, a possible "TATA box" and three possible "cap sites" can be recognised upstream from the initiation codon. To the 5' side of the "TATA box" is found an unusual sequence of 21 A's interrupted by a central G residue. It occupies the same relative position as the P. miliaris H2A gene-specific 5' dyad symmetry sequence and the "CCAAT box" seen in other eukaryotic polymerase II genes but is clearly different from both. A significant feature of the 3' non-coding region is the presence of a 23 base-pair sequence that is nearly identical to a conserved region found in sea urchin histone genes. The coding region is extremely GC rich, with strong selection for these bases in the third position of codons. Not a single coding triplet ends in U. No intervening sequences were found in this gene.
