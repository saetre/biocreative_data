DNA single-strand breaks containing 3'-8-oxoguanine (3'-8-oxoG) ends can arise as a consequence of ionizing radiation and as a result of DNA polymerase infidelity by misincorporation of 8-oxodGMP. In this study we examined the mechanism of repair of 3'-8-oxoG within a single-strand break using purified base excision repair enzymes and human whole cell extracts. We find that 3'-8-oxoG inhibits ligation by DNA ligase IIIalpha or DNA ligase I, inhibits extension by DNA polymerase beta and that the lesion is resistant to excision by DNA glycosylases involved in the repair of oxidative lesions in human cells. However, we find that purified human AP-endonuclease 1 (APE1) is able to remove 3'-8-oxoG lesions. By fractionation of human whole cell extracts and immunoprecipitation of fractions containing 3'-8-oxoG excision activity, we further demonstrate that APE1 is the major activity involved in the repair of 3'-8-oxoG lesions in human cells and finally we reconstituted repair of the 3'-8-oxoG-containing oligonucleotide duplex with purified human enzymes including APE1, DNA polymerase beta and DNA ligase IIIalpha.

Ionizing radiation produces DNA lesions largely through the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) that attack DNA (1). The same types of ROS are generated endogenously as by-products of oxidative metabolism and during the inflammatory response in non-irradiated cells. ROS can induce oxidative DNA damage, such as 8-oxoguanine (8-oxoG), directly or can oxidize nucleotide triphosphates that can be later incorporated into DNA (2). Furthermore, several events may lead to the formation of DNA lesions containing 3'-terminal 8-oxoG residues. For example during base excision repair (BER), misincorporation of 8-oxodGMP by DNA polymerase beta lacking proofreading activity may generate a 3'-terminal 8-oxoG (3,4). If this 3'-terminal 8-oxoG does affect ligation of the neighbouring phosphodiester bond, then it will result in persistent DNA containing single-strand breaks (SSBs) with 3'-terminal 8-oxoG ends. Similar lesions may also arise as a result of so-called 'clustered lesions', since ionizing radiation energy is deposited in small volumes of nanometre dimensions resulting in ROS being produced at high local concentrations (5). Consequently, the formation of multiply damaged sites in DNA may include 3'-8-oxoG lesions immediately next to a SSB.

Normally 8-oxoG, as with many other base lesions in DNA, is efficiently repaired by the BER pathway (6,7). However, little is known about the repair of base lesions located in close proximity to DNA strand breaks, although early findings indicated that repair enzymes could inefficiently process such lesions. For example, uracil-DNA glycosylase inefficiently removes uracil residing at the 3'-end of oligonucleotides (8) and DNA polymerase beta, the major base excision repair polymerase, very inefficiently extends a primer containing 3'-terminal 8-oxoG (3,9). Therefore, the mechanism for the repair of 3'-terminal 8-oxoG lesions is unclear although there are several repair pathways that have the potential to process these 3'-blocking lesions, including direct excision of the 3'-terminal 8-oxoG by DNA glycosylase activity or a specific 3'-end processing activity that would excise the modified nucleotide. This would be followed by the repair of the intermediate product arising by proteins of the BER pathway.

HeLa cell pellets were purchased from Paragon, USA. Whole cell extracts (WCEs) were prepared by the method of Manley et al. (12) dialysed overnight against buffer containing 25 mM HEPES-KOH, pH 7.9, 100 mM KCl, 12 mM MgCl2, 0.1 mM EDTA, 17% glycerol and 2 mM DTT and aliquots frozen at -80degreesC for the repair assays. An aliquot of this extract (100 mg protein) was then fractionated by Phosphocellulose chromatography using a step elution of 150 mM KCl (PC-FI) and 1 M KCl (PC-FII) as previously described (13,14). Proteins (10 mg) from the PC-FII fraction were further separated by gel filtration on a Superdex-75 column (Amersham) in a buffer containing 50 mM HEPES (pH 7.9), 150 mM KCl, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM DTT and 1 mM phenylmethylsulphonyl fluoride. 0.5 ml fractions were collected and tested for the ability to remove 3'-8-oxoG as described below.

The easiest way to process 3'-8-oxoG is to remove it by a DNA glycosylase activity. To test for DNA glycosylase activities towards 3'-8-oxoG residues, the 3'-8-oxoG containing oligonucleotide was 5'-labelled prior to construction of the nick containing duplex oligonucleotide (Figure 1A). This substrate was subsequently incubated with a 10-fold molar excess of either human 8-oxoguanine DNA glycosylase (OGG1) or human endonuclease VIII-like proteins (NEIL1, NEIL2). Although the activity of all enzymes had been tested with the corresponding substrates (data not shown), no excision activity against 3'-8-oxoG lesions could be observed (Figure 1B). Furthermore, on addition of sodium hydroxide to cleave any abasic sites generated by DNA glycosylase activity no cleavage products were observed indicating that, at the concentrations used, DNA glycosylase activities of OGG1, NEIL1 or NEIL2 are not active against 3'-8-oxoG residues.

Another opportunity to process 3'-8-oxoG would be to convert it to a conventional 8-oxoG by sealing the SSB and then repair it through the BER pathway. To investigate this possibility, a radiolabelled duplex oligonucleotide substrate containing a 5'-phosphorylated nick with 3'-8-oxoG ends was constructed (Figure 1A). The ability of DNA ligase IIIalpha and DNA ligase I to ligate this substrate was then compared to the corresponding control oligonucleotide containing 3'-guanine. The control duplex oligonucleotide was gradually ligated by increasing concentrations of DNA ligase to the corresponding 44mer oligonucleotide (Figure 2A and 2B, right panel). However the 3'-8-oxoG containing oligonucleotide is non-ligatable, even at the highest amount of DNA ligase used (Figure 2A and 2B, left panel).

Another possibility for removing 3'-8-oxoG lesions would be to extend the 3'-end by DNA polymerase synthesis and afterwards repair 8-oxoG through the BER pathway. To investigate such a possibility, a substrate containing the 20mer 5'-labelled 3'-8oxoG lesion annealed to the 44mer complementary oligonucleotide was generated to analyse the ability of Pol beta (the major BER polymerase) to extend the 3'-8-oxoG containing primer. With a control oligonucleotide substrate, primer extension is achieved by increasing concentrations of Pol beta (Figure 3, right panel). However, under the same conditions the 3'-8-oxoG containing substrate is resistant to primer extension synthesis by Pol beta (Figure 3, left panel). These experiments show that 3'-8-oxoG residues are non-ligatable, resistant to DNA glycosylase activities and are not extended by Pol beta, and indicate a specific repair enzyme for the removal of 3'-8-oxoG residues. It has been previously shown that APE1 has 3'-exonuclease activity that is involved in the removal of 3'-end mismatched nucleotides (15) and therefore we tested the possibility of purified APE1 being capable of excising 3'-8-oxoG lesions. With the use of a control nick containing duplex oligonucleotide (3'-G/C) or mismatch containing duplex (G/A), no significant exonuclease activity of APE1 was observed in our reaction conditions (Figure 4A and B; left panel). In comparison, using a 3'-8-oxoG nick containing duplex oligonucleotide substrate with 8-oxoguanine opposite cytosine (3'-8oxoG/C) or adenine (3'-8oxoG/A), APE1 processed the 3'-end specifically removing the 8-oxoG lesion only to generate a 19mer product (Figure 4A and B; right panel) and demonstrates the 3'-8-oxoG specific end processing activity of APE1.

Although we showed that purified APE1 is able to cleave 3'-8-oxoG residues, we tested human WCE for the ability to repair this lesion and subsequently isolated the major activity against 3'-8-oxoG. Using HeLa WCE, we were able to demonstrate the repair of 3'-8-oxoG residues when present within a nick, although with low efficiency. Incubation with WCE converted the 20mer 3'-8-oxoG containing labelled fragment of the oligonucleotide substrate, shown in Figure 1A, to the full-length repaired 44mer product, indicating the 3'-8-oxoG excision activity in WCE (Figure 5A). We proceeded to further characterize the 3'-8-oxoG activity from human WCE using Phosphocellulose chromatography, eluting proteins off into two fractions using low (0.15 M KCl, PC-FI) and high salt (1 M KCl, PC-FII) elution (13,14). These fractions were tested for their ability to remove 3'-8-oxoG lesions and we find that the majority of the 3'-8-oxoG activity observed in human WCE is retained in the high salt elution fraction PC-FII only (Figure 5B; fourth panel), which has also been found to contain the majority of BER proteins, including APE1 (7). No other residual activity for the removal of 3'-8-oxoG was observed in the low salt fraction PC-FI (Figure 5B; third panel). The proteins within fraction PC-FII, which contained the major 3'-8-oxoG excision activity, were further separated according to their size by gel filtration chromatography. The fractions were subsequently tested for their ability to remove 3'-8-oxoG lesions and it was shown that the activity was present predominantly within fractions 19-23, where proteins with a molecular weight of approximately40-60 kDa are eluted (Figure 5C). Western blot analysis of these fractions revealed that elution of APE1 occurred within fractions 19-23 (Figure 5D) so we conclude that the 3'-8-oxoG cleavage activity co-purifies with APE1 protein.

Gel filtration fractions containing the peak of 3'-8-oxoG excision activity (fractions 20 and 21) were chosen to immunodeplete APE1 using antibodies raised against APE1. Analysis by western blot reveals that, although the levels of APE1 are slightly reduced by mock immunodepletion compared to the original fractions, using APE1 antibodies the fractions were completely depleted of the APE1 protein (Figure 6A). The original fractions, alongside the mock immunodepleted and immunodepleted fractions, were subsequently tested for their ability to remove 3'-8-oxoG lesions. The mock immunodepletion protocol does not affect 3'-8-oxoG cleavage activity in fractions 20 and 21 (Figure 6B, lanes 4 and 5) compared to the original fractions (Figure 6B, lanes 2 and 3). However, using antibodies specific to APE1, the activity against 3'-8-oxoG is completely ablated (Figure 6B, lanes 6 and 7). Taken together, these results indicate that APE1 is the major enzyme processing 3'-8-oxoG lesions in human cell extracts.

Finally, we reconstituted repair of the 3'-8-oxoG containing duplex oligonucleotide with purified human enzymes including APE1, Pol beta and DNA ligase IIIalpha (Figure 7). Addition of APE1 converted the 20mer fragment containing 3'-8-oxoG into a 19mer (Figure 7, lane 2), which is observed as the 20mer fragment after filling the gap by Pol beta (Figure 7, lane 3) and finally DNA ligase seals the DNA ends generating a 44mer full-length repair product (Figure 7, lane 4).

Ionizing radiation and the misincorporation of 8-oxodGMP by DNA polymerases can induce SSBs with terminal 3'-8-oxoG ends. However, several different repair mechanisms exist that may potentially repair this lesion. Excision of 3'-8-oxoG ends by a DNA glycosylase is one potential repair pathway however, previous reports on the removal of 3'-end damaged bases are conflicting as 3'-end uracil residues are resistant to cleavage by uracil-DNA glycosylase (8) whereas it has been suggested that human endonuclease III would be able to excise 3'-terminal dihydrouracil residues (16). OGG1 was discovered as the major enzyme for the removal of 8-oxoG:C pairs in DNA (17,18) although the emergence of NEIL proteins that contain a wide substrate specificity (19-21) may serve as a backup activity to OGG1, even though NEIL1 has a relatively weak activity towards 8-oxoG lesions in comparison to OGG1. However, we found that the 3'-8-oxoG lesion is resistant to excision by OGG1, NEIL1 and NEIL2 even when a 10-fold molar excess of DNA glycosylases has been used.

Repair of SSBs containing 3'-8-oxoG lesions could proceed by direct ligation by a DNA ligase, so that the 8-oxoG lesion can then be processed by the BER pathway. Relatively little is known about the ligation of SSBs containing 3'-8-oxoG using human DNA ligases, although it has been previously reported that T4 DNA ligase can ligate oligonucleotide substrates containing 3'-8-oxoG ends (22). However, our studies using either human DNA ligase I or IIIalpha demonstrated that the 3'-8-oxoG containing strand break is non-ligatable under physiological conditions.

Another possible solution for the repair of 3'-8-oxoG residues would involve DNA polymerase strand displacement synthesis so that the 3'-end would be moved downstream to the lesion and 8-oxoG can be subsequently repaired by the BER pathway. Previous reports suggest that phage T7 DNA polymerase and E.coli polymerase I or II are able to undergo primer extension from 3'-8-oxoG lesions, although the reactions are generally inefficient (9,22). DNA polymerase alpha and beta have also been shown to extend from 3'-8-oxoG residues, although with low efficiency (3) and in agreement with this study our results show that Pol beta is unable to efficiently extend beyond 3'-8-oxoG lesions.

We subsequently found that APE1 protein can excise 3'-8-oxoG lesions and furthermore, APE1 activity is the predominant mechanism for excision of 3'-8-oxoG lesions in human cell extracts. This would then create a one nucleotide gap substrate for gap filling and ligation by a DNA polymerase and a DNA ligase, respectively. Correspondingly, we were able to reconstitute the entire pathway with purified human enzymes including APE1, Pol beta and DNA ligase IIIalpha. APE1 is known to interact with XRCC1 (23) and Pol beta (24) during BER and subsequently these interactions may be important during the repair of 3'-8-oxoG lesions initiated by APE1, for the recruitment of Pol beta and XRCC1-DNA ligase IIIalpha complex that will restore DNA integrity.

Taken together, our data demonstrate that APE1 is the major activity involved in the repair of SSBs containing 3'-8-oxoG in human cell extracts. We have previously demonstrated that APE1 is also the major activity in human cell extracts against 3'-phosphoglycolate (14). Furthermore, APE1 has been shown to contain 3'-exonuclease activity for mismatched DNA bases [for review see (25)]. These observations support the view that APE1 may play a central role in the processing of SSBs containing blocked 3'-ends. Our data also predict that APE1 may excise other 3'-end modified nucleotides that are resistant to cleavage by DNA glycosylases. Consistent with our results, it was recently demonstrated that yeast cell-free extracts, as well as purified Apn1, can excise 3'-8-oxoG and that deletion of both OGG1 coding for 8-oxoG-DNA yeast glycosylase and APN1 coding for the major yeast AP endonuclease causes a 46-fold synergistic increase in spontaneous mutation rate (M. Saparbaev, personal communication).
