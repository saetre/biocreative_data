A cDNA clone was constructed from a mRNA encoding an anti-GAT (Glu60 Ala30 Tyr10) BALB/c monoclonal antibody heavy chain. Its sequence, covering codons -5 to 162 and therefore encompassing the complete V-D-J region, was determined. Surprisingly, the sequence of the VH gene-encoded region was almost identical with that of the BALB/c VH anti-HNP (4-hydroxy-3-nitrophenyl) acetyl VH region, suggesting that the same VH germ-line might be used to encode two heavy chains contributing to antibodies of discrete specificities. A specific VH probe was derived and annealed to Eco RI and Bg1 II restriction fragments of liver (unrearranged) DNA extracted from the BALB/c, DBA/2 and C57BL/6 mouse strains that differ in their H chain allotypes. Under stringent conditions, only a few bands were identified by Southern blotting. The different patterns observed suggest that the VH anti-GAT repertoire differs between these strains even though their various anti-GAT antibodies express the same public idiotypic specificities.
