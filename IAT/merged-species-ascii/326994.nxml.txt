When RNA isolated from the Drosophila melanogaster alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) negative mutant CyOnB was translated "in vitro" in the presence of yeast opal suppressor tRNA, a wild type size ADH protein was obtained in addition to the mutant gene product. This identifies the CyOnB mutant as an opal (UGA) nonsense mutant. From the molecular weight of the mutant protein, and from the known sequence of the ADH gene (Benyajati et al., Proc.Natl.Acad.Sci. USA 78, 2717-2721, 1981), we conclude that the tryptophan codon UGG in position 234 has been changed into a UGA nonsense codon in the CyOnB mutant. Furthermore, we show that the UAA stop codon of the wild type ADH gene is resistant to suppression by a yeast ochre suppressor tRNA. This is in contrast to the high efficiency of suppression of the CyOnB UGA nonsense codon, despite an almost identical codon context.
