A recently reported cDNA clone coding for human promyelocytic L apoferritin, shows some differences with a liver L apoferritin cDNA. We have investigated if these differences are due to the expression of different genes or to an alternative transcription of an unique gene. In this paper we report data suggesting that a single gene is mainly expressed in several tissues examined. This gene has been cloned and characterized. Its sequence shows three introns: the exon sequence is identical to that of cDNA clone isolated from human liver. A minimum of five related pseudogenes have been also analysed. One of them is a processed pseudogene interrupted by an intron-like fragment.
