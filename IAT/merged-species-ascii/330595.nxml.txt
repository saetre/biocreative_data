Chromatin at the Drosophila Adh distal promoter displays an ordered but different conformation in different cell types as detected by a modified exonuclease protection assay and accessibility to endonucleases. In cells not transcribing Adh (ADH-) sequences between -40 to +30 of the distal RNA initiation site exist as a DNA linker between positioned nucleosomes, and appear to interact with a specific DNA-binding protein. In contrast, a longer linker DNA, from -140 to +30, is bound in a multi-protein transcription initiation complex in cells that specifically transcribe the distal (adult) ADH RNA (ADH+A). These DNA-protein interactions can account for a localized open chromatin structure at the distal promoter in ADH+A cells. The observed mutually exclusive patterns of DNA-protein interactions in the linkers of different ADH cell types between -40 to +30 suggest a model for organizing alternative chromatin structure associated with gene regulation. Two DNA binding proteins, one being a TATA box binding factor, compete for overlapping sites to allow either assembly of a transcription initiation complex and transcription, or positioning of nucleosomes for stable repression.
