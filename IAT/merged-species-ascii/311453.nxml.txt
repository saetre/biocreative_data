The nucleotide sequence of the gsh I gene for gamma-glutamylcysteine synthetase(GSH I) of Escherichia coli B has been determined. The gsh I structural gene contains 1557 bases in length and predicted a ploypeptide of 518 amino acids with a calculated molecular weight of 58,251. The value is in good agreement with that obtained from gel filtration and SDS/PAGE of GSH I. The initiation codon 5 bp downstream of putative Shine-Dalgarno sequence was an unusual TTG, which encoded methionine. For transcription, two sets of consensus promoter signals(-10 and -35 regions) overlapping each other were identified. The terminator signal shows the favored stem-loop structure with an adequate free energy delta G = -22.80 kcal/mol.
