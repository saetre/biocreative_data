We have determined the primary structure of the two regions of the Xenopus laevis mitochondrial genome which encompass the origins of heavy (H) and light (L) strand replication. The first segment, which consists of 2398 nucleotides, contains the displacement loop (D-loop), the tRNA genes for threonine, proline and phenylalanine, the origin of H-strand replication, and the promoters of H- and L-strand transcription. The second segment, which consists of 447 nucleotides, contains the L-strand replication origin flanked by the tRNA genes for tryptophan, alanine, asparagine, cysteine, and tyrosine. A comparison of the sequences of the Xenopus laevis mitochondrial L-strand replication origin region and the eight tRNA genes with their counterparts from the mammalian mitochondrial genomes reveals that these regions are quite homologous, while its D-loop region shows only slight homology with those of the mammalian mitochondrial genomes.
