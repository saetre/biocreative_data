Hypoxia inducible factor-1 alpha (HIF-1alpha) protein is rapidly degraded under normoxic conditions. When oxygen tensions fall HIF-1alpha protein stabilizes and transactivates genes involved in adaptation to hypoxic conditions. We have examined the normoxic expression of HIF-1alpha RNA and protein in normal human melanocytes and a series of human melanoma cell lines isolated from radial growth phase (RGP), vertical growth phase (VGP) and metastatic (MET) melanomas.

HIF-1alpha mRNA and protein was increased in RGP vs melanocytes, VGP vs RGP and MET vs VGP melanoma cell lines. We also detected expression of a HIF-1alpha mRNA splice variant that lacks part of the oxygen-dependent regulation domain in WM1366 and WM9 melanoma cells. Over-expression of HIF-1alpha and its splice variant in the RGP cell line SbCl2 resulted in a small increase in soft agar colony formation and a large increase in matrigel invasion relative to control transfected cells. Knockdown of HIF-1alpha expression by siRNA in the MET WM9 melanoma cell line resulted in a large decrease in both soft agar colony formation and matrigel invasion relative to cells treated with non-specific siRNA. There is a high level of ERK1/2 phosphorylation in WM9 cells, indicating an activated Ras-Raf-MEK-ERK1/2 MAPK pathway. Treatment of WM9 cells with 30 muM U0126 MEK inhibitor, decreased ERK1/2 phosphorylation and resulted in a decrease in HIF-1alpha expression. However, a 24 h treatment with 10 muM U0126 totally eliminated Erk1/2 phosphorylation, but did not change HIF-1alpha levels. Furthermore, siRNA knockdown of MEK siRNA did not change HIF-1alpha levels.

###xml 256 261 <span type="species:ncbi:9606">human</span>
We speculate that metabolic products of U0126 decrease HIF-1alpha expression through "off target" effects. Overall our data suggest that increased HIF-1alpha expression under normoxic conditions contributes to some of the malignant phenotypes exhibited by human melanoma cells. The expanded role of HIF-1alpha in melanoma biology increases its importance as a therapeutic target.

The incidence of melanoma is increasing more rapidly than any other tumor site. Melanoma accounts for 4% of all skin cancers, but for 79% of all skin cancer related deaths in the United States (Melanoma Research Foundation). Metastatic melanoma is highly resistant to both chemo- and radiotherapy [1]. Cutaneous melanoma arises from, melanocytes, presumably due to early childhood exposure of the skin to UV radiation. A predisposing factor for melanoma may be the melanocortin receptor. It has been found that individuals having a mutation that affects the function of the melanocortin receptor have an increased risk of developing cutaneous melanoma [2].

Hypoxia-inducible factor-1 (HIF-1) is a master regulator of O2 homeostasis in cells. It consists of a heterodimeric transcriptional complex of two proteins, HIF-1beta and HIF-1alpha. HIF-1beta is constitutively expressed whereas HIF-1alpha protein is stabilized only under hypoxic conditions, despite its continuous synthesis under normoxic conditions [3]. When O2 tension is normal, HIF-1‚ü® is hydroxylated at specific proline residues by the enzyme prolyl hydroxylase-domain (PHD). This hydroxylation is required for the von Hippel Lindau (VHL) tumor suppressor protein to bind to HIF-1alpha leading to subsequent ubiquitination and proteasome-targeted degradation [4]. VHL binding is also enhanced by acetylation of lys532 catalyzed by the acetyltransferase, ADP-ribosylation factor domain protein 1 (ARD1) [5]. Under hypoxic conditions, proline hydroxylation decreases thereby stabilizing HIF-1alpha, which in turn moves to the nucleus and transactivates various genes containing hypoxia response elements [6].

HIF-1alpha controls the expression of over 60 genes involved in many aspects of oncogenesis, including tumorigenesis [7,8] anti-apoptosis [9,10], and genetic instability [11]. HIFalpha has also been implicated in the malignant progression of several cancers including mammary gland, prostate, brain, and lung [12]. HIF-1alpha is the regulatory subunit of HIF-1. It is regulated at the protein level by both oxygen- dependent and independent pathways [6]. HIF-1alpha is highly expressed in early stage of mouse hepatocarcinogenesis independent of hypoxia [13]. The hypoxia independent increase in HIF-1alpha is thought to be activated by growth signaling pathways. A majority of human melanomas have constitutively active MAPK/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) due to BRAF or N-Ras mutations [14,15]. Activation of this pathway is correlated with the upregulation of HIF-1alpha mRNA in human melanoma [16,17]. However the biological significance of upregulated HIF-1alpha under normoxic conditions for initiation and progression of melanoma has not been elucidated.

In this study, we examined the normoxic expression and biological functions of HIF-1alpha in human melanoma. We found that both full length and a splice variant, HIF-1alpha785, are expressed in human melanoma cell lines while essentially undetectable in normal human melanocytes. Ectopic HIF-1alpha expression in a low expressing RGP cell line stimulated Matrigel invasion, while knockdown of HIF-1alpha in a high expressing MET cell line inhibited both soft agar colony formation and Matrigel invasion. Knockdown of MEK1/2 and loss of phosphorylated ERK1/2 did not decrease HIF-1alpha expression. U0126 MEK inhibitor at 10 muM eliminated ERK1/2 phosphorylation, but did not decrease HIF-1alpha expression.

In addition to the well known pathway of HIF-1alpha protein stabilization under hpoxic conditions, it has been established that many oncoproteins and growth factor signaling pathways up-regulate HIF-1alpha expression under normoxic conditions [18,19]. However, there are few investigations into the normoxic expression of HIF-1alpha in human melanoma and its role in the malignant progression of this disease. Here, we show that in human melanoma cells, the oxygen-labile HIF-1alpha protein as well as its mRNA is expressed endogenously under normoxic conditions. Figure 1A shows that HIF-1alpha protein is highly expressed in WM9 cells relative to normal human melanocyte (HEMn-LP), but radial growth phase (SbCl2), and vertical growth phase (WM1366) also express a higher amount of HIF-1alpha protein relative to human melanocytes. Similar results are seen in second set of RGP, VGP and MET melanoma cell lines (Fig. 1B). HIF-1alpha was detected as 120 kD protein in nuclear extracts while no protein was detected in cytoplasmic extracts (data not shown).

Hypoxic stabilization of HIF-1alpha occurs at the protein level [3]. Since HIF-1alpha protein was increased in human melanoma cells under normoxic conditions, we determined whether this increase might be due to increased HIF-1alpha mRNA levels. Initially we used semi-quantitative RT-PCR to assess expression of HIF-1alpha full length (FL) and a splice variant HIF-1alpha785 that is missing the acetylation site lys532 due to lack of exon 11 (Fig. 2A). This splice variant encodes HIF-1alpha protein that has been reported to be stable under normoxic conditions [17,20]. Primers were designed so that full length HIF-1alpha would exclude HIF-1alpha785 by targeting exon 11, which is absent in HIF-1alpha785. Primers for HIF-1alpha785 excluded HIF-1alpha by targeting the exon 10:12 boundary only present in HIF-1alpha785. Fig. 2B shows that human melanoma cell lines express both full-length and the 785 splice variant HIF-1alpha mRNA at a level that appeared to be higher than normal human melanocytes.

Expression of HIF-1alphaFL & HIF-alpha785 mRNA in human melanoma cells. (A) Schematic representation of the functional domains of both HIF-1alpha full length and HIF-1alpha785. Both HIF-1alphaFL and 785 have various domains in common such as basic helix loop helix (bHLH), Per/Arnt/Sim (PAS), Oxygen Dependent Degradation Domain (ODDD), N-terminal transactivation domain N-TAD, inhibitory domain (ID), nuclear localization signal (NLS) and C-terminal transactivation domain C-TAD. Upon loss of exon 11 in HIF-1alpha785, part of the ODDD is deleted. This missing region contains the important lysine 532 residue which is acetylated by ARD1 leading to increased stable interaction of HIF-1alpha with the von Hippel Lindau tumor suppressor. This interaction directs HIF-1alpha to the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway for degradation under normoxic conditions [5]. (B) Total RNA was extracted from HEMn-LP, SbCl2, WM1366, and WM9. RNA was reverse transcribed using the Advantage RT-for PCR kit(R). Five muL of the resulting cDNA was used in the PCR reaction as described in the Advantage cDNA kit(R) manual. Primers (see Methods for sequence) for HIF-1alpha and HIF-1alpha785 were designed to specifically amplify each variant with no cross-amplification. Primers for the housekeeping control gene GAPDH were included in the Advantage cDNA kit(R). Control primers amplifying a fragment of the control plasmid included in the Advantage cDNA kit(R) were used to ensure optimal PCR conditions.

These findings were verified by qRT-PCR measurement of full-length and HIF-1alpha785 mRNA levels (Fig. 3). All melanoma cell lines had increased expression of HIF-1alpha mRNA relative to normal human melanocytes. In addition VGP and MET cell lines expressed more of the 785 HIF-1alpha mRNA than full length HIF-1alpha mRNA. Overall the WM9 metastatic melanoma expressed the highest amount of 785 HIF-1alpha mRNA (~79x higher than normal human melanocytes).

The level of HIF-1alpha protein is low in the radial growth phase SbCl2 cells relative to VGP or MET cell lines. We determined the effect of HIF-1alphaFL or HIF-1alpha785 overexpression on SbCl2 anchorage-independent growth and Matrigel invasion. HIF-1alphaFL and HIF-1alpha785 were cloned into the pLenti-V5-D-TOPO vector and transiently overexpressed in SbCl2 cells (Fig. 4A). HIF-1alpha785 overexpression resulted in a small, but statistically significant increase in anchorage-independent growth, relative to mock or lacz transfected cells (Fig. 4C and 4D). In contrast overexpression of both HIF-1alphaFL and HIF-alpha785 in SbCl2 resulted in a large and significant 3-fold increase in Matrigel invasion relative to mock or Lacz transfected cells (Fig. 4B).

HIF-1alpha protein is highly expressed under normoxic conditions in the WM9 human metastatic melanoma cell line. To determine whether HIF-1alpha could be contributing to the malignant characteristics of these cells, we knocked down its expression and examine how this affected anchorage independent growth and Matrigel invasion. WM9 cells were treated with 100 nM siRNA targeting HIF-1alpha (Dharmacon) which consistently decreased its expression by ~75-85% (Fig. 5A). Colony formation after 5 days in soft agarose was inhibited by 70% in HIF-1alpha-siRNA transfected WM9 cells in comparison to cells transfected with control siRNA (Fig. 5B). A photo (Fig. 5C) of the colonies formed at this time point in control vs. HIF-1alpha transfected cells verifies this decrease in soft agar colony formation. Matrigel invasion was also significantly decreased in HIF-1alpha-siRNA transfected WM9 cells compared to control siRNA transfected WM9 cells (Fig. 5D). Measurement of cell viability in the Matrigel chambers shows no difference between control vs. HIF-1alpha siRNA transfected cells (Fig. 5E). These knock down studies suggest that increased non-hypoxic expression of HIF-1alpha plays an important role in key malignant properties exhibited by these human melanoma cells.

The effect of loss of HIF-1alpha expression in human metastatic melanoma WM9 cells on anchorage-independent growth and invasion. (A) WM9 cells were treated with either 100 nM HIF-1alpha siRNA or 100 nM control non-targeting siRNA (Dharmacon, Inc.) using the RNAifect(R) transfection reagent (Qiagen, Inc.). Knock down of HIF-1alpha was confirmed by western blot at 72 h post transfection. (B) At 48 h post transfection Ctrl siRNA or HIF-1alpha siRNA treated WM9 cells, were assayed for anchorage independent growth using the CytoSelect 96 well Cell Transformation Assay(R) (Cell Biolabs, Inc.). Briefly, the cells were seeded at 8.0 x 103 cells/well into a 0.4% agar layer poured over a 0.6% agar layer of a 96 well plate. Wells lacking cells served as a blank control. On day 5 after seeding, agar layers were solubilized, cells were lysed, and nucleic acid stained with CyQuant dye. Fluorescence intensity in each well was determined by a plate reader set at 485/520 nm. Results are expressed as Relative Fluorescent Units. (C) Photomicrograph of a representative field of colonies form in the Cell Transformation Assay by control siRNA transfected cells (left) vs. HIF-1alpha siRNA transfected cells. (D) Matrigel invasion assay. At 48 h post transfection, the Ctrl siRNA or HIF-1alpha siRNA transfected WM9 cells were seeded into 6-well Matrigel (+) chambers, and as a control, 6-well Matrigel (-) chambers (BD Biosciences) at 7.0 x 104 cells per well. The method and counting of invading cells was done as described in "Experimental Procedures". Results are expressed as % invasion of HIF-1alpha siRNA treated-WM9 cells relative to invasion by Control siRNA treated-WM9 cells corrected for invasion by similarly treated cells seeded in Matrigel (-) chambers. (E) Cell viability assay was done in WM9 cells transfected with control siRNA or HIF-1alpha siRNA at 48, 72 and 96 h following transfection by the trypan blue exclusion method. Data is expressed as the mean +/- SEM of triplicate samples. The entire experiment was repeated twice with similar results. Student paired t test was used to analyse the data and all P values </= 0.01 or 0.05 are relative to control siRNA treated cells.

Hypoxia independent expression of HIF-1alpha is thought to be regulated by growth signaling pathways [18,19] and the majority of melanomas have constitutively active ERK1/2 MAPK pathway due to BRAF or N-Ras mutations [14,15]. Therefore, we determined whether HIF-1alpha expression in human metastatic melanoma WM9 cells was dependent on activation of ERK1/2 MAPK signaling. These cells have an active ERK1/2 MAPK pathway as evidenced by the high phosphorylation of ERK (Fig. 6A). Treatment of WM9 cells with 30 muM U0126, a selective U0126 MEK inhibitor, decreased ERK1/2 phosphorylation and led to a time-dependent decrease in HIF-1alpha protein expression (Fig. 6A). Although 30 muM U0126 has been used in published studies to selectively inhibit MEK [16,21], the original paper describing this inhibitor [22] used much lower concentrations to achieve high selectivity. Therefore we repeated this experiment using 10 muM U0126 (Fig. 6B). At 24 h of treatment, 10 muM U0126 completely suppressed the phosphorylation of ERK1/2, yet there was minimal change in the level of HIF-1alpha relative to control cells. With further time of inhibitor treatment, phosphorylation of ERK was not totally suppressed, but HIF-1alpha levels decreased. We also used siRNA specifically targeting MEK1 and 2 in WM9 cells to inhibit ERK1/2 phosphorylation. Treatment of WM9 cells with siRNA targeting MEK1 and 2 consistently decreased its expression by greater than 90% and also decreased ERK1/2 phosphorylation. However, knockdown of MEK1 and 2 did not decrease the normoxic expression of HIF-1alpha protein in human metastatic melanoma WM9 cells (Fig. 6C).

Melanocytes - the cells responsible for producing the skin-coloring pigment, melanin, are the point of origin for melanoma. Melanoma, if diagnosed and treated early, has a high cure rate [23]. If the melanoma progresses, it can metastasize regionally to lymph nodes, and then to distant organs such as the lungs, and the brain [24]. Metastatic melanoma is very difficult to treat and has a high mortality rate. Several studies have confirmed that HIF-1alpha is a survival factor, as well as a key regulator of metastasis in various cancers [25,26].

HIF-1alpha regulates the adaptive responses to O2 tensions at cellular levels. It controls the expression of many genes involved in different aspects of tumor biology, including angiogenesis, cell survival, invasion [3], tumor growth [7,8], anti-apoptosis [9,10], and genetic instability [11]. HIF-1alpha is rapidly degraded under normoxic condition and is stablilized under hypoxic condition [3]. We found that HIF-1alpha protein and RNA is expressed under normoxic conditions in several human melanoma cell lines and that the levels of HIF-1alpha expression correlates with the stage of cancer from which the melanoma cell line was established. In contrast, HIF-1alpha protein was undetectable in normal human melanocytes. Normoxic expression of HIF-1alpha has been found in a number of cancer cell types [13,17,27]. Activation of the ERK1/2 MAPK [16] and phosphotidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) [18] pathways has been implicated in stimulating normoxic expression of HIF-1alpha.

The epidermis of the skin is a partial hypoxic environment [28]. Evidence has been provided that this partial hypoxia contributes to melanomagenesis [29,30]. Therefore, one possibility is that the increase in HIF-1alpha that we observed in melanoma ceils is due to the hypoxic adoptive response maintained by the cells in culture. However, hypoxia stabilizes the HIF-1alpha protein and does not increase the level of HIF-1alpha mRNA. We found that the increased HIF-1alpha protein in the melanoma cells was correlated with an increase in HIF-1alpha mRNA. Also, the normal human melanocytes used in our study came from the partial hypoxic environment of the skin and yet in culture, they do not express detectable levels of HIF-1alpha protein. Therefore, we think it more likely that the increased HIF-1alpha mRNA and protein is due to an inappropriately activated signaling pathway.

We also found that an mRNA splice variant, HIF-1alpha785, was expressed at higher levels than full length HIF-1alpha mRNA in the VGP and metastatic human melanoma cell lines. HIF-1alpha785 is missing the acetylation site lys532 due to lack of exon 11 and is thought to be more stable under normoxic conditions in comparison to full length HIF-1alpha [17,20]. In several non-melanoma cell lines it was found that phorbol ester stimulated the expression of HIF-1alpha785 mRNA under normoxic conditions via a redox-dependent ERK1/2 MAPK pathway [17]. How this alternatively spliced isoform of HIF-1alpha mRNA is increased in melanoma is currently under investigation.

We examined the biological consequences of HIF-1alpha FL and 785 splice variant gain of function and HIF-alpha FL loss of function in selected human melanoma cells. The SbCl2 radial growth phase melanoma cells have low levels of HIF-1alpha protein expression and a limited capacity to form colonies in soft agar and to invade through Matrigel. This cell line was chosen to determine the biological effects of HIF-1alpha overexpression. Transient ectopic expression of FL HIF-1alpha did not result in a statistically significant increase in SbCl2 colony formation in soft agar. However, transient overexpression of HIF-1alpha785 resulted in a small, but statistically significant increase in soft agar colony formation. The effect on anchorage-independent growth may be limited by the transient nature of the overexpression of HIF-1. Overexpression of either HIF-1alphaFL or 785 led to a large and statistically significant increase in the ability of SbCl2 cells to invade Matrigel. There have been a few reports on the effect of HIF-1alpha overexpression on the in vitro biologic properties of cancer cells. Hypoxia-induced or exogenous overexpression of HIF-1alpha increased in vitro invasion by human colon adenocarcinoma cells [31], while stable normoxic overexpression of HIF-1alpha promoted anchorage-independent growth in melanocytes having an activated AKT signaling pathway [30]. SbCl2 cells overexpressing HIF-1alpha785 showed a somewhat greater increase in soft agar colony formation as well as invasion ability compared to full length HIF-1alpha. Whether this difference is due to a longer half-life for the splice variant protein relative to the full length protein is currently under investigation.

HIF-1alpha loss of function experiments were carried out in the WM9 metastatic melanoma cell line. This cell line was chosen due to its high level of normoxic expression of HIF-1alpha. The WM9 is an aggressive metastatic melanoma cell line that has a high level of anchorage-independent growth and Matrigel invasion ability. We found a significant decrease in both anchorage-independent growth and Matrigel invasion upon silencing of normoxic expression of HIF-1alpha by siRNA treatment. These decreases were not due to a loss of cell viability as has been reported for knockdown of HIF-1alpha under hypoxic conditions [16]. This decrease in invasion might be due to decreased expression of HIF-1alpha regulated genes involved in invasion such as matrix metalloproteinase 2 (MMP2), urokinase plasminogen activator receptor (uPAR), and cathepsin D [31,32]. Loss of anchorage-independent growth in HIF-1alpha silenced cells may be due to ERK/MAPK, PI3K/Akt and HIF-1 pathway interactions. The PI3K/Akt pathway is one of the most critical pathways involved in anchorage-independent growth [33].

Hypoxia independent expression of HIF-1alpha is thought to be regulated by growth signaling pathways [6]. The majority of melanomas have constitutively active ERK1/2 MAPK pathway due to BRAF or N-Ras mutations [14,15]. In particular, human metastatic melanoma WM9 cells have a constitutively active ERK1/2 MAPK pathway most likely due to the V600E BRAF mutation found in these cells. Treatment of these cells with 30 muM of the selective MEK inhibitor, U0126, decreased ERK1/2 phosphorylation and also resulted in a time dependent decrease in HIF-1alpha protein expression.

This 30 muM concentration chosen for our initial studies was based on two other published papers that used this amount of U0126 to demonstrate the involvement of the ERK1/2 MAPK pathway in the regulation of HIF-1alpha [16,21]. In the original report describing U0126, it was stated that the Ki for intracellular inhibition of ERK phosphorylation in COS-7 cells was 0.1 muM [22]. Thus the concentration used in our study and others [16,21] is 300 times higher than the Ki. Therefore we repeated the MEK inhibition studies using 10 muM U0126. In contrast to 30 muM U0126, the lower concentration completely eliminated ERK1/2 phosphorylation after a 24 h incubation with WM9 human metastatic melanoma cells. Despite this inhibition of ERK1/2 phosphorylation, there was no change in the expression of HIF-1alpha protein. At the later time point of 48 and 72 h of inhibitor treatment the phosphorylation of ERK1/2 was not completely suppressed and the level of HIF-1alpha protein was decreased. We also inactivated ERK1/2 signaling by knocking down the expression of MEK. We needed to use siRNA against both MEK1 and MEK2 in order to obtain a > 90% decrease in expression of these enzymes. Although this knockdown inhibited ERK phosphorylation, there was no decrease in HIF-1alpha protein expression at any time point assayed (up to 6 days). In the course of analyzing these data, we were informed by Promega, the manufacturer of U0126, that the compound is unstable in tissue culture media and produces metabolites that have poor MEK inhibitory activity. Considering the sum of our data, we hypothesize that the metabolites of U0126 are responsible for the decrease in HIF-1alpha protein levels. This would explain the lack of change in HIF-1alpha protein in cells treated for 24 h with 10 muM U0126 despite complete inhibition of ERK1/2 phosphorylation and the fact that siRNA knockdown of MEK resulting in decrease ERK1/2 phosphorylation also did not result in a decrease in HIF-1alpha protein levels.

Analysis of BRAF and NRAS mutations in our human melanoma cell lines (Table 1) shows that WM3211 cells do not have the common activating mutations in these genes, yet these cells express increased amounts of HIF-1alpha protein and mRNA under normoxic conditions. Overall our data suggest normoxic expression of HIF-1alpha is not regulated by the ERK1/2 MAPK pathway, at least in the WM9 human metastatic melanoma cell line. The hypoxia independent expression in melanoma cells, like other cancers, might be regulated by phosphotidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) [13,18], NFkB [34] or JAK/STAT [35] pathways.

In conclusion, HIF-1alpha is overexpressed, in melanoma cell lines under normoxic conditions in a manner that correlates with the aggressiveness of the tumor from which the cell line was established. We also show that the novel splice variant HIF-1alpha785, which is missing part of the oxygen regulation domain is overexpressed in these melanoma cell lines. Manipulation of HIF-1alpha expression in several of our melanoma cell lines suggests that this transcription factors regulates, in part, anchorage-independent growth and Matrigel invasion. Our results suggest that development of new therapeutic agents that inhibit HIF-1alpha function may be of use in the treatment of human melanoma regardless of the hypoxic condition of the tumor.

Total RNA was extracted using Tri-Reagent (Sigma Chemical Co., St. Louis, MO). The purified RNA samples were dissolved in RNase-free water and quantified by Nanodrop spectrophotometer (NanoDrop Technology, Inc., Wimington, DE). Each RNA sample had an A260/A280 ratio of 1.8 or above. The quality of RNA was determined on the Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer, using the RNA 6000 Nano Assay kit (Agilent Tehcnologies, Wilmington, DE) and reverse transcribed using the RT-for-PCR kit (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA) as per manufacturer's instructions. Primers were designed to either amplify only HIF-1alpha or HIF-1alpha785 exclusively. HIF-1alpha primers excluded HIF-1alpha785 by targeting exon 11, which is absent in HIF-1alpha785. HIF-1alpha785 primers were designed to exclude HIF-1alpha by targeting the exon 10:12 boundary only present in HIF-1alpha785. Sequence of the HIF-1alpha forward primers were: 5'-AAAGTTCACCTGAGCCTAAT-3', and reverse 5'-TAAGAAAAAGCTCAGTTAAC-3'. The sequence of HIF-1alpha785 forward primers were 5'-AAAGTTCACCTGAGGACAC-3', and reverse 5'-TAAGAAAAAGCTCAGTTAAC-3'. Primers for the housekeeping gene control GAPDH were included in the Advantage cDNA kit(R). Control primers amplifying a fragment of the control plasmid included in the Advantage cDNA kit(R) were used to ensure optimal PCR conditions.

The pLenti-V5-D-TOPO vector was used in gain of function experiments in the SbCl2 radial growth phase human melanoma cells. HIF-1alpha or HIF-1alpha785 was cloned into this vector by amplifying these genes using primers specific for both the 5' and 3' ends of HIF-1alpha. The linearized pLenti-V5-D-TOPO Vector contains 5' GTGG overhangs at one end while the insert is Taq Amplified to contain a 5' CACC overhang at one end. Following amplification, 20 muL of the 50 muL PCR amplification reactions were separated on a 1% agarose gel stained with ethidium bromide to ensure that the correct size amplicon was present. HIF-1alpha and HIF-1alpha785 amplicons were purified from the remainder of the PCR reaction using the Zymo DNA Clean & Concentrate Kit(R) (Zymo Research Inc., Orange, CA). After ligation, plasmids were transformed into Stbl3 competent cells (Invitrogen Corp., Carlesbad, CA) and plated onto agar plates containing 100 mug/mL ampicillin. Plates were incubated at 37degreesC overnight and then colonies were screened for intact insert in the correct orientation. Plasmids were isolated from positive colonies and analyzed by DNA sequencing to ensure the correct plasmid expression construct.
