A library of random mutations in the Escherichia coli fnr gene has been screened to identify positive control mutants of FNR that are defective in transcription activation at Class I promoters. Single amino acid substitutions at D43, R72, S73, T118, M120, F181, F186, S187 and F191 identify a surface of FNR that is essential for activation which, presumably, makes contact with the C-terminal domain of the RNA polymerase alpha subunit. This surface is larger than the corresponding activating surface of the related transcription activator, CRP. To identify the contact surface in the C-terminal domain of the RNA polymerase alpha subunit, a library of mutations in the rpoA gene was screened for alpha mutants that interfered with transcription activation at Class I FNR-dependent promoters. Activation was reduced by deletions of the alpha C-terminal domain, by substitutions known to affect DNA binding by alpha, by substitutions at E261 and by substitutions at L300, E302, D305, A308, G315 and R317 that appear to identify contact surfaces of alpha that are likely to make contact with FNR at Class I promoters. Again, this surface differs from the surface used by CRP at Class I CRP-dependent promoters.
