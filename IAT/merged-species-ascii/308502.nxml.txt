A complementary DNA encoding DNA-dependent ATPase Q1 possessing DNA helicase activity, which is the major DNA-dependent ATPase in human cell extracts, was cloned from a cDNA library of human KB cells. The predicted amino acid sequence has seven consecutive motifs conserved in the RNA and DNA helicase super family and DNA helicase Q1 belongs to DEXH helicase family. A homology search indicated that helicase Q1 had 47% homology in the seven conserved regions with Escherichia coli RecQ protein. Three RNA bands of 4.0, 3.3, and 2.2 kilobases were detected in HeLa cells by Northern blotting. Analysis of the genomic DNA indicated the presence of a homologous gene in mouse cells. The DNA helicase Q1 gene was localized on the short arm of human chromosome 12 at 12p12.
