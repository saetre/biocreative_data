We have cloned and sequenced overlapping cDNA fragments which together encode the entire mouse protein p53. Using these cDNA's we have reconstructed the full length coding region for the protein, and have analysed its coding potential by expression in vitro, both as a full length sequence and as a subfragment contained in a fusion protein. The predicted amino acid sequence contains no obvious homologies to any known oncogenes but includes a possible tyrosine kinase acceptor site.
