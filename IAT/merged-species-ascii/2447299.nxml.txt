To identify novel components in heterotrimeric G-protein signalling, we performed an extensive screen for proteins interacting with Caenorhabditis elegans Galpha subunits. The genome of C. elegans contains homologues of each of the four mammalian classes of Galpha subunits (Gs, Gi/o, Gq and G12), and 17 other Galpha subunits. We tested 19 of the GGalpha subunits and four constitutively activated Galpha subunits in a largescale yeast two-hybrid experiment. This resulted in the identification of 24 clones, representing 11 different proteins that interact with four different Galpha subunits. This set includes C. elegans orthologues of known interactors of Galpha subunits, such as AGS3 (LGN/PINS), CalNuc and Rap1Gap, but also novel proteins, including two members of the nuclear receptor super family and a homologue of human haspin (germ cell-specific kinase). All interactions were found to be unique for a specific Galpha subunit but variable for the activation status of the Galpha subunit. We used expression pattern and RNA interference analysis of the G-protein interactors in an attempt to substantiate the biological relevance of the observed interactions. Furthermore, by means of a membrane recruitment assay, we found evidence that GPA-7 and the nuclear receptor NHR-22 can interact in the animal.
