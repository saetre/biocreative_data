Six Drosophila melanogaster tumor suppressor genes causing malignant or benign tumors in specific cell types are described. The wild-type alleles of these genes are instrumental in the differentiation of particular cell types. In the homozygous state, recessive mutations in the genes interrupt the differentiation of the cells and thus cause their uncontrolled, autonomous, lethal proliferation. The tumors show all major characteristics of malignant and benign neoplastic growth. Genomic sequences of four of the genes have been identified and are currently being characterized.
