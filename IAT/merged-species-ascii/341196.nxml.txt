A bovine cDNA library constructed from fetal cartilage RNA was screened with a pro alpha 1(II) collagen specific chicken cDNA. A recombinant clone (Bc 7), with an insert of 1 kb, was identified and shown to contain sequences exhibiting 85% homology with the chicken pro alpha 1(II) collagen C-propeptide. Interspecies comparison strongly suggested that one potential glycosylation site present in the avian C-propeptide is not utilized, since this site is absent in the bovine chain. In addition, two overlapping genomic clones (Pal 3 and Pal 4) were isolated and partially characterized. These clones span 23 kb of DNA and contain approximately 17 kb of the pro alpha 1(II) calf gene. Sequencing of exon 1 has determined the length of the 3' untranslated region and the exact location of the polyadenylation attachment site.
