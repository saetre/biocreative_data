Mouse ribosomal protein L7 is encoded by a multigene family. Screening of two mouse genomic libraries with cloned L7 cDNA, has resulted in the isolation of nine independent lambda Charon 4A recombinant phages which include seven different L7 genes. Restriction enzyme mapping of six of these genes (L7-1, L7-16, L7-18, L7-28, L7-35 and L7- 16b ) reveals dissimilarity in sites within the L7 sequences as well as in the flanking regions. Electron microscopic analysis of heteroduplex and S1 nuclease mapping demonstrate that the first five genes contain the entire L7 mRNA sequence but lack introns. Based on these features we propose that these are processed genes. Of the L7 genes described here only one (L7- 16b ) exhibits a high degree of homology with L7 mRNA and contains introns. We discuss the possibility that this low representation of intron containing L7 genes may reflect the proportion of functional L7 genes in this multigene family.
