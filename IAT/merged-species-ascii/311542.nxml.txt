Bacteriophage libraries of mouse DNA were screened for sequences homologous to the v-myb oncogene and two overlapping clones containing the v-myb related region were isolated. Restriction enzyme mapping, heteroduplex analysis and nucleotide sequence analysis revealed the presence of nine exons. Six of these exons are homologous to the v-myb region while the other three exons are derived from the 5' region which is deleted in the viral oncogene. The sequences downstream to the sixth v-myb exon are not included in the 17 kbp of DNA sequences analyzed in this study. Comparison of the structure of the normal c-myb clone with its rearranged couterpart present in plasmacytoid lymphosarcomas revealed that the rearrangements occur in this locus as a result of viral integration. Present studies demonstrate that such a viral insertion interrupts the c-myb coding region at a region identical to that observed in the generation of the v-myb gene of avian myeloblastosis virus and results in the synthesis of mRNAs that lack the same 5' coding region.
