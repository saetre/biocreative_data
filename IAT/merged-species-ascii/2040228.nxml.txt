###begin p 7
Three GR polymorphisms that tag 95% of all haplotypes across the GR gene were genotyped. These are an intron B Bcl1 polymorphism, a ttg insertion/deletion within intron F (rs2307674) and the single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) lying in the 3' untranslated region of exon 9b (rs6198). The dye terminator-based SNaPshot method or size resolution by capillary electrophoresis was performed. The study population comprised 198 UK Caucasian RA cases and 393 ethnically matched controls.

Studies from both animals and humans suggest that a defect in the neuroendocrine system may be important in the disease rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Inappropriately normal plasma cortisol and a blunted response of plasma cortisol to surgical stress have been shown for RA patients.1,2 Glucocorticoids (Gcs) are required for the development of streptococcal cell wall-induced arthritis in Lewis rats.3 Furthermore, while many RA patients respond well to exogenous Gc treatment, a proportion fail to do so.4 These observations suggest that hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis dysregulation or relative Gc deficiency contributes to the onset of RA.

Gcs exert their effect by binding to the intracellular receptor, the glucocorticoid receptor alpha (GRalpha). The human GR gene (GCCR, GCR, GRL, NR3C1) (locus 5q31) is 10 exons in length and exons 1-9alpha are transcribed into GRalpha mRNA, which is translated into a functional receptor (GRalpha). Alternative splicing of the primary transcript results in an mRNA containing exons 1-9beta, which gives rise to the GRbeta. Unlike GRalpha, GRbeta does not bind hormone and is transcriptionally inactive.5,6 Although a dominant negative effect of GRbeta on GRalpha activity has been known for some time, the mechanism by which this occurs is not known and the precise functional significance of GRbeta remains unclear. Several associations with GRbeta overexpression and autoimmune/inflammatory diseases have been described. It is not known, however, whether this is a cause or consequence of the inflammatory state and whether the increase in the GRbeta is sufficient to exert a dominant negative effect on GRalpha. It has been suggested that GRbeta could in part mediate Gc resistance seen in RA.7

Derijk et al. described an A to G polymorphism at position 3736 in exon 9b (now rs6198).8 This polymorphism lies in an AUUUA motif of the 3' UTR of the mRNA of the GRbeta isoform and has been shown to increase mRNA stability and also receptor protein expression.9

Derijk et al. originally detailed the genotype and allele frequencies of the rs6198 polymorphism in a very small sample size of 30 RA cases compared with 24 controls and found carriage of the mutant allele to be associated with significant increased risk of RA.8 Here we report our attempt to replicate and extend these findings. We have previously demonstrated strong linkage disequilibrium across the GR gene locus and suggested haplotype tagging single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs).10 In this current study we looked at three polymorphisms that in combination capture 95% of all haplotypes occurring at a frequency of greater than 1% in Caucasians (Fig. 1). These are an intron B Bcl1 polymorphism, which has been associated with increased Gc sensitivity and a lower body mass index,11 a ttg insertion/deletion within intron F (rs2307674) and the SNP lying in the 3' untranslated region of exon 9b (rs6198). We studied these in a well-characterized panel of RA patients and healthy controls to determine whether polymorphisms of GR contribute to RA susceptibility. Utilizing this combination of SNPs allows for the most comprehensive investigation of GR polymorphisms in RA that has been carried out to date.

SNP genotyping was by the dye terminator-based SNaPshot method (Applied Biosystems, Warrington, UK). In brief, polymerase chain reactions (10 microl final volume) contained 10 ng of genomic DNA, 0.4 microl of each primer (25 pmol/microl), 1 microl of 10 x NH4 buffer (Bioline), 1 microl of dNTPs (Bioline, 2 mM), 0.3 microl MgCl2 (Bioline, 1.5 mM) and 0.2 microl of Taq polymerase (Bioline, 5 U/microl). The primers and probes used were (5' to 3'): for the intron B Bcl1 SNP: forward primer CTA TTC TTC AAA CTG AAT CTT CTG, reverse primer CAA CAC GTA TAT CTA CAT TTA GAA C, and probe GAC ACC AAT TCC TCT CTT AAA GAG ATT; for the rs6198 SNP: forward primer AGT GTC TTT TTA CCT ACG C, reverse primer ATG TTT CTC CAT ATT TGG C, and probe TGT GGT TTG GTA ATA CCA GAA CAG CAA ATT TAA A.

Associations between the GR polymorphisms and RA were analysed using the chi2-test (Stata, College Station, TX) and correction for multiple testing was performed by Bonferroni's method. Haplotype analysis was carried out using the expectation-maximization algorithm implemented in HelixTree (Golden Helix, Bozeman, MT). Stratification analysis was performed to investigate the effects of gender, disease severity, as assessed by the presence of erosive disease, age at disease onset (the median age at onset was used as the cut-off value), and carriage of SE alleles (HLA-DRB1*0401, *0404, *0101, *0102, *1001 and *1402 were considered positive for the shared epitope).

Inappropriately low endogenous cortisol production may be a contributing factor to the onset and progression of RA. How this arises has not been ascertained.12 Alternatively, a normal HPA axis response to inflammation may be compromised in RA patients by a reduction or alteration in GR function. The number of GRalpha in lymphocytes from RA cases was found to be lower than in controls.13 However, the serum cortisol levels were normal so such apparent downregulation of receptor expression is difficult to explain. Polymorphism of the GR gene may influence GC sensitivity. Certain low-frequency polymorphisms of GR (ER22/23EK) have been found to be associated with parameters of Gc sensitivity in normal individuals.14 These nucleotide changes are in strong LD with the intron B Bcl1 polymorphism in particular, and as such we find no evidence of association of them with RA susceptibility. The possibility of a GR polymorphism conferring risk for RA was raised by Derijk et al.8 This was of particular interest because the nucleotide change occurred in the 3' UTR of the GRbeta molecule. If RA cases had an excessive amount of this variation, which was subsequently found to have functional significance and affect GRbeta mRNA stability, then a possible mechanism for relative GR resistance would have been found. Our study aimed to look for variation in GR polymorphism with RA susceptibility. We specifically genotyped for the rs6198 SNP within the 3' UTR of GRbeta, in combination with two other changes, which gave excellent genetic coverage across the GR gene locus. We have accounted for 95% of all haplotypes across the GR gene by using this approach.

No evidence for genetic association with GR polymorphisms and RA susceptibility was observed. This is in agreement with the findings of a Korean study of RA, in which the 149 RA cases and controls were compared and no association with the intron B Bcl1 polymorphism was found with the RA group as a whole, or on stratification for disease severity.15 Although less well powered to look at, we have also stratified our patient cohort by parameters of disease severity. An excess of rs6198 AA (wild-type) homozygotes was seen when the SE negative cases were compared with the SE negative controls (Table 2). However, given the relatively small numbers involved, and the borderline level of significance, which is not maintained once correction for multiple testing is applied, this finding needs to be interpreted with caution.

###begin p 41
In summary, we have looked at three changes across the GR gene that capture 95% of all commonly occurring haplotypes, but find no evidence for GR polymorphisms contributing a substantial genetic effect, either as single point or as haplotypic associations, to risk of RA. We conclude that GR polymorphisms do not confer significant risk of RA.
