A detailed molecular analysis of both reciprocal recombination products of the variant t(2;8) chromosomal translocation of the Burkitt lymphoma derived cell line JI and their germline counterparts was carried out. The breakpoint on chromosome 8 is localized 28 kb to the 3' side of the c-myc protooncogene, the breakpoint on chromosome 2 was found to be within an aberrantly rearranged VK gene (abbreviations ref. 1). Novel features of the immunoglobulin moiety involved in this process include insertion of extra nucleotides in the V-J junction which have the characteristics of a N segment as it has been found up to now only in heavy chain and T cell receptor genes; the occurrence of somatic mutations in 8q+ and not in 2p-. These data allow a reconstruction of the course of events in the cell line JI; remarkable sequence regularities at the chromosomal breakpoints consisting of symmetrically placed dinucleotides and elements related to the hepta- and nonanucleotide recombinase recognition sequences are discussed in the context of the translocation mechanism.
