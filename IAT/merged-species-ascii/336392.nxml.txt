Sets of overlapping cosmid clones generated by random sampling and fingerprinting methods complement data at pyrB (96.5') and oriC (84') in the published physical map of E. coli. A new cloning strategy using sheared DNA, and a low copy, inducible cosmid vector were used in order to reduce bias in libraries, in conjunction with micro-methods for preparing cosmid DNA from a large number of clones. Our results are relevant to the design of the best approach to the physical mapping of large genomes.
