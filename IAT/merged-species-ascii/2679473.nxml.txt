Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) play a key role in periodontal disease. Although it is known that macrophages and fibroblasts are co-localized and express MMPs in the diseased periodontal tissue, the effect of interaction between these two cell types on MMP expression has not been well elucidated. Furthermore although it is known that diabetes is associated with accelerated periodontal tissue destruction, it remains unknown whether hyperglycemia, a major metabolic abnormality in diabetes, regulates MMP expression by affecting the cross-talking between fibroblasts and macrophages. In this study, human gingival fibroblasts and U937 macrophages were cocultured in a two-compartment transwell culture system, and the cells were treated with normal or high glucose. We found that coculture of fibroblasts and U937 macrophages led to an augmentation of MMP-1 expression by U937 macrophages, and high glucose further enhanced this augmentation. Similar observations were also made in the coculture of fibroblasts and human primary monocytes. We also found that interleukin 6 (IL-6) released by fibroblasts was essential for the augmentation of MMP-1 expression by U937 macrophages. Furthermore our results showed that high glucose, IL-6, and lipopolysaccharide had a synergistic effect on MMP-1 expression. Finally our study indicated that MAPK pathways and activator protein-1 transcription factor were involved in the coculture- and high glucose-augmented MMP-1 expression. In conclusion, this study demonstrates that IL-6 derived from fibroblasts is essential for MMP-1 up-regulation by cross-talking between fibroblasts and U937 macrophages exposed to high glucose, revealing an IL-6-dependent mechanism in MMP-1 up-regulation.

Periodontal disease is characterized by inflammation of periodontal tissues, eventually leading to degeneration of the periodontium (1-3). Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs),3 a family of proteolytic enzymes that degrade collagen and other matrix proteins including elastin, fibronectin, proteoglycan, and laminin, play an essential role in the periodontal tissue destruction (4, 5). MMPs are expressed in inflamed periodontal tissue by inflammatory cells including monocytes, macrophages, lymphocytes, and polymorphonuclear cells and also by resident cells such as fibroblasts, epithelial cells, and endothelial cells (6, 7). Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) derived from Gram-negative bacteria, the major pathogens involved in periodontal disease, is a potent stimulator for MMP expression (1).

It has been well established that patients with either type 1 or type 2 diabetes have increased prevalence and severity of periodontal disease (8). Considering the crucial role of MMPs in periodontal disease, it was believed that the periodontal MMP expression was increased in patients with diabetes, leading to an increase in tissue destruction (8). Indeed studies have shown that the periodontal MMP expression is higher in patients with both diabetes and periodontal disease than in those with periodontal disease alone. For example, it was reported that MMP-8 and MMP-9 expression was significantly increased in the gingival tissue of diabetic patients with chronic periodontitis (9). Our recent study showed a trend of increase in MMP-1 expression in periodontal tissues across patients with neither diabetes nor periodontal disease, patients with periodontal disease alone, and patients with both diseases (10). In our effort to understand the mechanisms involved in diabetes-promoted MMP expression, we demonstrated that elevated glucose concentration (high glucose) augmented LPS-stimulated MMP expression in macrophages by enhancing LPS-triggered signaling and transcriptional activity (11, 12). We further demonstrated that lactate, which is associated with hyperglycemia and increased in plasma and saliva of diabetic patients (13, 14), also had a synergistic effect with LPS on MMP expression (15). These studies revealed a molecular mechanism potentially involved in periodontal disease in diabetic patients.

Both macrophages and gingival fibroblasts are present in periodontitis-inflamed periodontal tissue (16, 17), and their interaction has been shown to increase MMP expression (18, 19). However, the underlying mechanism has not been investigated. Furthermore it is unclear whether hyperglycemia alters MMP expression regulated by the interaction between macrophages and fibroblasts. In the current study, we demonstrated that coculture of U937 human histiocytes (resident macrophages) and human gingival fibroblasts in a two-compartment transwell coculture system led to an augmentation of MMP-1 expression, and IL-6 released by fibroblasts played an essential role in the augmentation. We also demonstrated that high glucose further enhanced the augmentation of MMP-1 expression.

Cell Culture and Treatment with LPS-Human monocytes were isolated as described previously (20) from blood obtained from healthy donors. U937 histiocytes (21) and human gingival fibroblasts were purchased from American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). The cells were cultured in a 5% CO2 atmosphere in RPMI 1640 medium (Invitrogen) containing normal glucose (5 mm) or high glucose (25 mm), 10% fetal calf serum, 1% minimum Eagle's medium non-essential amino acid solution, and 0.6 g/100 ml HEPES either independently or in Corning Transwell plates (Sigma) that have two compartments separated by a polycarbonate membrane with 0.4-mum pores. Fibroblasts were grown to 80% confluence in the lower compartment, and U937 cells or human monocytes were grown (0.5 x 106 cells/ml) in the upper compartment. For cell treatment, LPS from E. coli was used (Sigma). The LPS was highly purified by phenol extraction and gel filtration chromatography and was cell culture-tested. We compared the potency of this LPS with that of LPS isolated from Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, a kind gift provided by Dr. Edward Lally, University of Pennsylvania, in the stimulation of MMP-1 secretion by U937 cells. Results showed that A. actinomycetemcomitans LPS was more potent than E. coli LPS at concentrations of 5, 10, and 50 ng/ml but had no difference at 100 ng/ml (Fig. 1).

Real Time PCR-Total RNA was isolated from cells using the RNeasy minikit (Qiagen, Santa Clarita, CA). First strand complementary DNA (cDNA) was synthesized with the iScripttrade mark cDNA synthesis kit (Bio-Rad) using 20 mul of reaction mixture containing 0.25 mug of total RNA, 4 mul of 5x iScript reaction mixture, and 1 mul of iScript reverse transcriptase. The complete reaction was cycled for 5 min at 25 degreesC, 30 min at 42 degreesC, and 5 min at 85 degreesC using a PTC-200 DNA Engine (MJ Research, Waltham, MA). The reverse transcription reaction mixture was then diluted 1:10 with nuclease-free water and used for PCR amplification of MMP cDNA in the presence of the primers. The Beacon designer software (PREMIER Biosoft International, Palo Alto, CA) was used for primer designing. Primers for MMP-1 (5' primer, CTGGGAAGCCATCACTTACCTTGC; 3' primer, GTTTCTAGAGTCGCTGGGAAGCTG) were synthesized by Integrated DNA Technologies, Inc. (Coralville, IA), and real time PCR was performed in duplicate using 25 mul of reaction mixture containing 1.0 mul of reverse transcription mixture, 0.2 mum both primers, and 12.5 mul of iQtrade mark SYBR Green Supermix (Bio-Rad). Real time PCR was run in the iCyclertrade mark real time detection system (Bio-Rad) with a two-step method. The hot start enzyme was activated (95 degreesC for 3 min), and cDNA was then amplified for 40 cycles consisting of denaturation at 95 degreesC for 10 s and annealing/extension at 53 degreesC for 45 s. A melt curve assay was then performed (55 degreesC for 1 min and then the temperature was increased by 0.5 degreesC every 10 s) to detect the formation of primer-derived trimers and dimers. Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) (5' primer, GAATTTGGCTACAGCAACAGGGTG; 3' primer, TCTCTTCCTCTTGTGCTCTTGCTG) served as a control. Data were analyzed with the iCycler iQtrade mark software. The average starting quantity of fluorescence units was used for analysis. Quantification was calculated using the starting quantity of the cDNA of interest relative to that of GAPDH cDNA in the same sample.

Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay (EMSA)-Ten micrograms of nuclear proteins was used for EMSA to determine AP-1 DNA binding activity. DNA-protein binding reactions were performed at room temperature for 20 min in a buffer containing 10 mm Trizma (Tris base), pH 7.9, 50 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mug of poly(dI-dC), 5% (v/v) glycerol, and approximately0.3 pmol of AP-1 oligonucleotide (Promega, Madison, WI) labeled with digoxigenin-ddUTP using terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase (Roche Applied Science). Protein-DNA complexes were resolved from protein-free DNA in 5% polyacrylamide gels in 50 mm Tris, pH 8.3, 0.38 m glycine, and 2 mm EDTA at room temperature and electroblotted onto positively charged nylon membranes. The chemiluminescence detection of digoxigenin-labeled probes was conducted by following the instructions provided by the Roche Applied Science. For competition studies, unlabeled AP-1 oligonucleotides that were in 30-fold excess of the labeled AP-1 oligonucleotides were added to the reaction mixture. Supershift assays were performed by adding 1 mug of anti-c-Jun antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnologies, Santa Cruz, CA) to the reaction mixture. Nuclear factor of activated T-cells antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnologies) was used as a control antibody.

The Coculture of Fibroblasts and U937 Macrophages Was Similar to That of Fibroblasts and Human Monocytes in Its Capacity of Stimulating MMP-1 Secretion-It was reported previously that when fibroblasts were cocultured with human primary monocytes MMP-1 secretion was stimulated (18). Thus, we first determined whether the coculture of fibroblasts and U937 cells also stimulated MMP-1 secretion. Results showed that the coculture of fibroblasts and U937 cells in the absence or presence of LPS was similar to that of fibroblasts and human monocytes in stimulation of MMP-1 secretion (Fig. 2, A and B). The amount of MMP-1 secreted by the coculture of fibroblasts with either human monocytes or U937 cells was much more than the sum of MMP-1 released by independent culture of fibroblasts and that of monocytes or U937 cells.

High Glucose Enhances Fibroblast and U937 Macrophage Interaction-stimulated MMP-1 Expression in the Absence or Presence of LPS-In these experiments, we studied the effect of high glucose on the fibroblast/U937 cell coculture-stimulated MMP-1 secretion. Results (Fig. 3A) showed that in the absence of LPS the coculture exposed to normal glucose led to a significant augmentation of MMP-1 secretion as compared with the independent culture of fibroblasts or U937 macrophages (1.71 versus 0.67 ng/ml for fibroblasts and 0.22 ng/ml for U937 macrophages). Although the coculture exposed to high glucose also had a marked augmentation of MMP-1 secretion compared with the independent culture of fibroblasts or U937 macrophages (5.49 versus 0.58 ng/ml for fibroblasts and 0.98 ng/ml for U937 cells) (Fig. 3A), it is noteworthy that the coculture exposed to high glucose had a 3-fold increase in MMP-1 secretion when compared with that exposed to normal glucose (5.49 versus 1.71 ng/ml) (Fig. 3A).

LPS stimulated MMP-1 secretion from both fibroblasts and U937 macrophages, although the stimulatory effect was more potent in U937 macrophages (Fig. 3A). In the presence of LPS, the coculture of fibroblasts and U937 macrophages exposed to normal glucose also markedly augmented MMP-1 secretion as compared with the independent culture of fibroblasts or U937 macrophages (14.71 versus 1.47 ng/ml for fibroblasts or 2.8 ng/ml for U937 cells) (Fig. 3A), and high glucose further increased MMP-1 secretion by about 3-fold when compared with normal glucose (42.75 versus 14.75 ng/ml). These results showed that although the coculture augmented MMP-1 secretion high glucose further increased the augmentation of MMP-1 secretion by the coculture.

The increased MMP-1 secretion by coculture of fibroblasts with U937 macrophages and further enhancement of the coculture-increased MMP-1 secretion by high glucose. Human gingival fibroblasts and U937 macrophages in the independent cultures or cocultures preexposed to normal (5 mm) or high glucose (25 mm) were challenged with or without 100 ng/ml LPS. After 24 h, medium was collected to quantify MMPs using ELISA. A, the stimulatory effect of the coculture and high glucose on MMP-1 secretion in the absence or presence of LPS. B, the stimulatory effect of the coculture of human monocytes and fibroblasts and high glucose on MMP-1 secretion in the absence or presence of LPS. An experiment similar to that described above was performed using human monocytes. Mono, monocytes, Fb, fibroblasts. C, the effect of the coculture and high glucose on MMP-13 secretion in the absence or presence of LPS. The data (mean +/- S.D.) are from one of three independent experiments with similar results. Error bars represent mean +/- S.D.

The effect of high glucose on MMP-1 secretion was also examined in the coculture of human monocytes and fibroblasts. Results showed that, similar to the coculture of U937 cells and fibroblasts, high glucose significantly increased MMP-1 secretion from the coculture of monocytes and fibroblasts (Fig. 3B). Furthermore results showed that the independent culture of monocytes and U937 cells had similar responses to high glucose in MMP-1 secretion (Fig. 3, A and B).

The effect of the coculture and high glucose on MMP-13, MMP-2, TIMP-1, and TIMP-2 secretion was also investigated. Results showed that the coculture in the absence of LPS did not increase MMP-13 secretion as compared with the independent culture of fibroblasts or U937 macrophages, and the coculture in the presence of LPS increased MMP-1 secretion only when the cells were exposed to high glucose (Fig. 3C). The coculture or high glucose did not increase MMP-2, TIMP-1, and TIMP-2 secretion (data not shown). These results indicate that the genes targeted for up-regulation by the coculture are highly selective.

Fig. 4A shows glucose concentration-dependent stimulation of MMP-1 secretion by the coculture of fibroblasts and U937 cells. In the presence of LPS, glucose at 10, 15, and 25 mm increased MMP-1 secretion by 1.4-, 1.8-, and 3.1-fold, respectively, as compared with cells treated with 5 mm glucose. A similar effect of high glucose on MMP-1 secretion was observed in the coculture of human monocytes and fibroblasts (Fig. 4B). Glucose at 15 mm increased MMP-1 secretion from the coculture of monocytes and fibroblasts by 2-fold as compared with glucose at 5 mm either in the absence or in the presence of LPS. Fig. 4C shows that 5 mm glucose plus 20 mm mannitol had no effect on MMP-1 secretion from the coculture of fibroblasts and U937 cells as compared with 5 mm glucose, suggesting that the stimulation of MMP-1 secretion by 25 mm glucose is not due to increased osmolarity.

U937 Macrophages, but Not Fibroblasts, Had Increased MMP-1 mRNA Expression in Coculture-To determine which type of cells, fibroblasts or U937 macrophages, had increased MMP-1 expression that contributed to the increased MMP-1 level in the coculture system, MMP-1 mRNA in both fibroblasts and U937 cells was quantified using real time PCR. Results showed that as compared with the independent fibroblast culture fibroblasts in the cocultured exposed to either normal or high glucose did not have an increase in MMP-1 mRNA (Fig. 5). In contrast, U937 macrophages in the coculture had markedly increased MMP-1 mRNA expression when compared with the independent U937 macrophage culture, and high glucose further increased MMP-1 mRNA expression (Fig. 5). After exposure to both high glucose and LPS, the MMP-1 mRNA level in U937 cells in the coculture system was 8-fold higher than that in the independent U937 cell culture (Fig. 5). These results suggest that a soluble factor(s) derived from fibroblasts may stimulate MMP-1 expression in U937 cells and thus augment the MMP-1 level in the coculture.

To provide further evidence that a fibroblast-derived soluble factor augments MMP-1 expression in U937 macrophages, we collected fibroblast-conditioned medium and applied it to U937 cell culture. Indeed we found that the addition of fibroblast-conditioned medium to U937 cell culture increased MMP-1 secretion in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig. 6). Conversely we also collected U937 cell-conditioned medium and applied it to fibroblast culture. Results showed that the addition of U937 cell-conditioned medium to fibroblasts did not increase MMP-1 secretion by fibroblasts (data not shown). MMP-1 expression analysis using quantitative PCR also showed no change in the MMP-1 mRNA level in fibroblasts after incubation with U937 cell-conditioned medium (data not shown). Thus, these data strongly suggested that a soluble factor(s) derived from fibroblasts is essential to stimulate MMP-1 expression in U937 cells and hence augments MMP-1 level in the coculture.

IL-6 Released by Fibroblasts Is Essential for the Augmentation of MMP-1 Expression by Fibroblast and U937 Cell Coculture- To identify the fibroblast-derived soluble factor involved in the augmentation of MMP-1 expression by U937 cells, we analyzed the inflammatory cytokine expression by fibroblasts in the coculture using an inflammatory cytokine array. From the array analysis, we found that IL-6 was the major cytokine released by fibroblasts and up-regulated by LPS and high glucose (Table 1). In contrast, the expression of IL-1alpha, IL-1beta, and TNFalpha was low and not stimulated by LPS and high glucose. We also found that IL-6 secretion by the coculture of fibroblasts and U937 cells was increased when compared with that by the independent cultures of fibroblasts or U937 cells and was further increased by high glucose (Fig. 7A). High glucose also increased IL-6 secretion from the coculture of human monocytes and fibroblasts (Fig. 7B). Because IL-6 is known to stimulate MMP expression (22, 23), we considered fibroblast-derived IL-6 as the soluble factor essential for the augmentation of MMP-1 expression by U937 cells in the coculture system. To confirm this hypothesis, we took two experimental approaches. First, we used anti-IL-6 antibody to block the interaction between IL-6 and U937 cells cultured in high glucose-containing medium. Results (Fig. 8) showed that in the absence of LPS anti-IL-6 antibody completely abolished the augmentation of MMP-1 secretion by the coculture. In contrast, anti-TNFalpha antibody had no effect. In the presence of LPS, anti-IL-6 antibody inhibited MMP-1 secretion by 78%, whereas anti-TNFalpha antibody only exerted a 15% inhibition. Although the inhibition of MMP-1 secretion by anti-TNFalpha antibody was also statistically significant, it was significantly less than that by anti-IL-6 antibody. Second, we transfected fibroblasts with IL-6 siRNA to inhibit IL-6 expression before fibroblasts were cocultured with U937 macrophages. Results showed that the transfection of fibroblasts with IL-6 siRNA markedly inhibited IL-6 expression (Fig. 9A). When transfected fibroblasts were cocultured with U937 cells in the absence or presence of LPS, the augmentation of MMP-1 secretion by the coculture was inhibited by 60-63% (Fig. 9B). These results strongly indicate that IL-6 plays a major role in the augmentation of the MMP-1 level in the coculture.

To provide more evidence that IL-6 is capable of stimulating MMP-1 expression by U937 macrophages, we compared the stimulatory effects of IL-6 and LPS on MMP-1 expression by U937 macrophages. Results showed that IL-6 was more potent than LPS at the concentrations of 1 and 10 ng/ml and had a synergistic effect with high glucose on MMP-1 secretion (Fig. 10A). Furthermore IL-6 and LPS also had a synergistic effect on MMP-1 secretion (Fig. 10B).

The Involvement of MAPK Pathways and AP-1 Transcription Factor in the Augmentation of MMP-1 Expression by Cell-Cell Interaction-Because it is known that MAPK pathways, which include the ERK, JNK, and p38 MAPK cascades, and STAT3 signal transduction pathways mediate IL-6-stimulated gene expression (22, 23), we determined which pathway is involved in the coculture-augmented MMP-1 expression by applying specific inhibitors of these pathways to U937 cells incubated with fibroblast-conditioned medium. Results showed that PD98059 and SP600125, the inhibitors for ERK and JNK, respectively, significantly blocked basal and fibroblast medium-augmented MMP-1 secretion (Fig. 11). In contrast, AG490, a specific inhibitor for STAT1 and STAT3 pathways, had no effect. In addition, SB203580 and Bay11-7085, the specific inhibitors for p38 MAPK and NFkappaB pathways, respectively, also failed to block MMP-1 secretion (Fig. 11). These results suggest that the ERK and JNK pathways mediate IL-6-augmented MMP-1 expression. Moreover because it is known that activation of ERK and JNK pathways leads to activation of AP-1 that is known to be a key transcription factor for MMP-1 expression (12), we determined the AP-1 transcriptional activity in U937 cells in the coculture exposed to high glucose using both an ELISA-type transcription factor activity assay and EMSA. Results from the transcription factor activity assay showed that AP-1 activity was increased by the coculture or LPS and further increased by the combination of the coculture and LPS (Fig. 12A). In contrast, although LPS increased NFkappaB (p50 and p65) activity in either U937 cell culture or coculture as expected, the coculture of fibroblasts and U937 cells did not augment NFkappaB activity (Fig. 12B), suggesting that NFkappaB is not involved in coculture-stimulated MMP-1 secretion. Our EMSA also showed a similar increase in AP-1 activity by the coculture or LPS and a further increase by the combination of coculture and LPS (Fig. 12C). The specific interaction between AP-1 and AP-1 probes was determined by adding unlabeled AP-1 probes and anti-c-Jun antibody. Results showed that the addition of unlabeled AP-1 probes resulted in a much lesser amount of the shifted AP-1 probes, suggesting a competition between labeled and unlabeled AP-1 probes for binding to the transcription factors in the nuclear extracts. The addition of anti-c-Jun antibody led to a supershift of AP-1 probes (Fig. 12D). Overall these results indicate that the transcription factor AP-1 is involved in the augmentation of MMP-1 expression by the coculture system.

It has been well established that MMPs, especially MMP-8 and MMP-1, play a critical role in periodontal tissue destruction (24, 25). Although MMP-8, which is mainly released by neutrophils, has been considered to be the major collagenase for the collagen degradation (25), studies have shown that MMP-1 also plays an important role in periodontal tissue destruction (24, 26, 27). A study demonstrated that polymorphism in the promoter region of MMP-1 gene, which leads to increased MMP-1 production, is associated with severe chronic periodontitis phenotype in non-smokers (28). MMP-1 mRNA expression was found to be correlated with decreased gingival collagen in patients with periodontal disease (26). Furthermore MMP-1 protein level in gingival crevicular fluid collected from patients with chronic periodontitis was found to be higher than that from periodontally healthy individuals (27). Thus, MMP-1 is likely to act in cooperation with MMP-8 as collagenases to degrade collagen and other matrix proteins. Our current study showed that among MMP-1, MMP-13, and MMP-2, the coculture of fibroblasts and U937 macrophages only augmented MMP-1 expression, suggesting that the gene up-regulated by the coculture is specific. Moreover the coculture did not augment TIMP-1 and TIMP-2, suggesting that the interaction between fibroblasts and U937 macrophages may tip the balance between MMPs and TIMPs to MMPs, leading to an increase in collagen degradation.

It was demonstrated that the coculture of gingival fibroblasts and human monocytes led to an increase in MMP-1 production (18). However, no study was conducted to investigate the underlying mechanism. In our current study, we demonstrated that the coculture of human gingival fibroblasts and U937 macrophages led to a marked augmentation of MMP-1 expression, which is consistent with the report by Domeij et al. (18), and IL-6 released by fibroblasts is essential for the augmentation of MMP-1 expression. We also demonstrated that high glucose further enhanced this augmentation. These findings revealed an interesting cross-talking between fibroblasts and U937 macrophages through IL-6 for MMP-1 up-regulation. It is likely that the total amount of IL-6 in the coculture system, which is derived from both fibroblasts and U937 cells, is sufficient to trigger a signaling that acts in concert with the signaling elicited by high glucose and LPS to up-regulate MMP-1 expression by U937 macrophages, leading to a remarkable increase in MMP-1 secretion in the coculture system. This study also suggests that in periodontitis-inflamed tissue LPS derived from bacteria stimulates IL-6 secretion, and IL-6 then acts with LPS synergistically to stimulate MMP-1 expression by macrophages. Because high glucose has a synergistic effect with LPS and IL-6, this up-regulation of MMP-1 expression is likely to be further enhanced by hyperglycemia in diabetic patients.

Our real time PCR showed that when compared with the independent culture MMP-1 expression in the coculture system was increased in U937 macrophages but not fibroblasts. This is an interesting finding. As our results showed that IL-6 plays a key role in MMP-1 up-regulation in the coculture (Figs. 8 and 9), this finding would suggest that IL-6 released by the coculture stimulates MMP-1 expression by U937 cells but not fibroblasts. Actually this notion is consistent with the report by Irwin et al. (29) showing that the addition of IL-6 up to the concentration of 1,000 ng/ml to gingival fibroblasts had no effect on MMP-1 expression unless the soluble IL-6 receptor was used. It is most likely that lack of soluble IL-6 receptor in our coculture system is the reason that no MMP-1 up-regulation in fibroblasts was observed. In contrast to fibroblasts, IL-6 effectively stimulated U937 macrophages without soluble IL-6 receptor (Fig. 10A). Interestingly our results showed that IL-6 was more potent than LPS at the concentrations of 1 and 10 ng/ml in the stimulation of MMP-1 secretion by U937 macrophages (Fig. 10A), indicating that IL-6 is a major player in MMP-1 up-regulation. In our recent investigation on the expression of IL-6, TNFalpha, IL-1beta, MMP-1, and MMP-8 in periodontal tissue, we observed a trend of increase in IL-6 mRNA expression across patients with neither diabetes nor periodontal disease, patients with periodontal disease alone, and patients with both diseases (10). Fascinatingly the same study also demonstrated a trend of increase in MMP-1 expression. Considering the potent stimulatory effect of IL-6 on MMP-1 expression, it is possible that IL-6 released by fibroblasts in periodontitis-inflamed tissue in response to LPS stimulated MMP-1 expression.

LPS is known to be a potent stimulator for MMP expression by macrophages (11, 12). Besides MMPs, LPS also stimulates the expression of inflammatory cytokines such as IL-6. Given the fact that IL-6 is also a powerful stimulator for MMP-1 expression, it is likely that LPS up-regulates MMP-1 expression via both IL-6-dependent and -independent pathways. Moreover our study showed that LPS and IL-6 had a synergistic effect on MMP-1 expression by U937 macrophages (Fig. 10B). Therefore, IL-6 appears to act as an "enhancer" for LPS in the stimulation of MMP-1 expression. Because both LPS and IL-6 stimulate gene expression via MAPK signaling pathways and AP-1 transcription factor, it is possible that LPS and IL-6 have a synergistic effect on MAPK signaling and AP-1 activity, leading to an enhanced stimulation of MMP-1 expression. Further studies are necessary to investigate the coordination of signaling and transcriptional activation between LPS and IL-6 on MMP-1 expression.

Another interesting finding from our current study is that high glucose and IL-6 had a synergistic effect on MMP-1 expression by U937 macrophages (Fig. 10, A and B). In addition to IL-6, our previous study (12) and the current data (Fig. 10B) showed that high glucose also has a synergistic effect with LPS on MMP-1 expression. Thus, we expect that high glucose would augment the stimulatory effect of the combination of LPS and IL-6 on MMP-1 expression. Indeed our results showed that after U937 macrophages were pre-exposed to high glucose the treatment with IL-6 and LPS led to a 2.5-fold increase in MMP-1 secretion as compared with those preexposed to normal glucose (Fig. 10B). Considering that LPS and IL-6 play a critical role in periodontal disease, these findings indicate that diabetic patients with poor glycemic control may have a significant increase in periodontal MMP-1 expression and subsequent tissue destruction as compared with nondiabetic patients during the progression of periodontal disease.

It is known that STAT3 and MAPK pathways are the major cascades mediating IL-6-stimulated gene expression by macrophages (19, 20). In our experiments to determine which pathway is responsible for the coculture-augmented MMP-1 expression, we found that inhibitors for ERK and JNK pathways, but not the STAT3 cascade, blocked MMP-1 expression augmented by conditioned medium from fibroblasts (Fig. 11), suggesting that ERK and JNK pathways, but not the STAT3 cascade, are involved in the MMP-1 up-regulation by cross-talking between fibroblasts and U937 macrophages. This finding is different from the previous reports that both STAT3 and MAPK pathways were involved in IL-6-stimulated MMP-1 expression in bovine chondrocytes (30) and mouse skin epithelial cells (31). It is possible that the cells from different species and different tissues may have different signaling control mechanisms in regulating MMP-1 expression: ERK and JNK MAPK pathways are sufficient in mediating MMP-1 expression for human macrophages, whereas both STAT3 and MAPK pathways are required for bovine chondrocytes and mouse skin epithelial cells. In the investigation of which transcription factor was involved in the coculture-stimulated MMP-1 expression, our study demonstrated that the activity of transcription factor AP-1, which is known to be activated as a result of ERK and JNK MAPK activation (32), was stimulated by the coculture and further enhanced by LPS (Fig. 12, A and C). Considering that AP-1 transcription factor is critical for MMP-1 expression (33-35), our results indicate that IL-6 stimulates MMP-1 expression through ERK and JNK pathways and subsequent AP-1 transcriptional activation. Because high glucose enhances AP-1 activity as shown by our previous study (12), it is likely that high glucose augments IL-6-stimulated MMP-1 expression via AP-1 activation.

IL-6 has been well documented as a key inflammatory cytokine involved in several inflammation-associated diseases such as coronary artery disease, diabetes, and rheumatoid arthritis (23). In this study, we demonstrated that IL-6 mediated the up-regulation of MMP-1 expression by the coculture of fibroblasts and U937 macrophages exposed to high glucose. Thus, this study strongly suggests that IL-6 is a key player in diabetes-associated periodontal disease and should be considered as a major target for the treatment of periodontal disease.
