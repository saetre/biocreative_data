The estrogen receptor-related receptor alpha (ERRalpha) is an orphan member of the nuclear receptor superfamily that has been shown to interfere with the estrogen-signaling pathway. In this report, we demonstrate that ERRalpha also cross-talks with signaling driven by other steroid hormones. Treatment of human prostatic cells with a specific ERRalpha inverse agonist reduces the expression of several androgen-responsive genes, in a manner that does not involve perturbation of androgen receptor expression or activity. Furthermore, ERRalpha activates the expression of androgen response elements (ARE)-containing promoters, such as that of the prostate cancer marker PSA, in an ARE-dependent manner. In addition, promoters containing a steroid response element can be activated by all members of the ERR orphan receptor subfamily, and this, even in the presence of antisteroid compounds.

The estrogen receptor-related receptor alpha (ERRalpha) is a member of the nuclear receptor superfamily, that, together with its paralog ERRbeta, has been identified due to its high level of sequence identity with the estrogen receptor alpha(ERalpha) (1). A third member of the subfamily, ERRgamma, has also been isolated more recently (2). These three receptors are referred to as 'orphan', since their transcriptional activities do not require the addition of an identified physiological ligand (3). Crystallographic studies have shown that apo-ERRalpha and apo-ERRgamma spontaneously adopt an active conformation, indicating that they can activate transcription in a constitutive manner (4,5). A specific, synthetic inverse agonist (XCT790) of ERRalpha has however been identified that deactivates the receptor (6) and induces its proteasome-dependent degradation (7), thus facilitating the study of its activities, at least in cell culture.

ERRbeta has been shown to be involved in the formation of the placenta and to regulate the maturation of primordial germ cells (8,9), whereas ERRgamma is essential in the oxidative metabolism of the postnatal heart (10). Published data from various laboratories have shown that ERRalpha plays a significant role in the regulation of energy homeostasis. Indeed, ERRalpha is highly expressed in tissues with high energy demands such as the heart or skeletal muscle (11-13). ERRalphaKO mice display a resistance to diet-induced obesity, altered fat metabolism and adsorption (14-16), fail to maintain body temperature when exposed to cold (17) and respond in an altered manner to cardiac pressure overload (18). These activities are thought to be exerted mainly in cooperation with the PPARgamma coactivator 1-alpha (PGC1-alpha), which is instrumental in many metabolical processes (13,19-20). However, ERRalpha is also expressed in many other tissues, in which its physiological roles has not been determined (11). The receptor has been proposed to act as a modulator of bone mass (21), and its high expression in ovarian, colon and breast cancers correlates with poor prognosis (22-26) although the functions of ERRalpha in cancer have not been investigated.

The structural proximity between ERRs and ERs, in particular in the DNA-binding domain (DBD) has led to hypothesis that the ERRs could interfere with the estrogen pathway (27). Indeed it has been shown that, at least in certain cellular and promoter contexts, some ERR response elements (ERREs) could transduce an estrogen signal (28-30), as illustrated by the case of the osteopontin gene promoter (31,32). In addition, such genes as lactoferrin or the breast cancer marker pS2, can be coregulated by both ERRalpha and ERalpha, through neighboring sites on their promoter (33,34). Furthermore, ERRalpha has been proposed to regulate the expression of aromatase (35), the rate-limiting enzyme in estrogen biosynthesis, and the expression of ERRalpha itself is reportedly induced by estrogens in the mouse uterus (36). Phylogenetical studies have grouped the ERRs in nuclear receptor subfamily 3, not only together with the ERs but also with the other steroid receptors [StRs, namely androgen receptor (AR), progesterone receptor (PR), glucocorticoid receptor (GR) and mineralocorticoid receptor (MR)] (37). This raises the hypo thesis that ERRs can also interfere with steroid signaling.

In this report, we show that the expression of androgen-responsive genes can be down-regulated by the ERRalpha-specific inverse agonist XCT790 in LNCaP (androgen-dependent human prostate cancer) cells. Importantly this effect of XCT790 is not exerted through a modulation of AR expression or activity. ERRalpha stimulates the activity of androgen-responsive element (ARE)-containing promoters, including that of PSA, a marker of prostate cancers. Other steroid-response elements (StRE)-containing promoters can also be activated by ERRs even in the presence of antisteroid compounds. Our results thus document a new level of interferences of ERRs in hormonal pathway.

LNCaP cells were cultured in RPMI1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 10 mM Hepes and 1 mM sodium pyruvate. HeLa and PC3 cells were cultured in DMEM medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. For transient transfections 105 cells were seeded in 24-well plates and transfected using 3 mul of ExGen 500 (Euromedex, Souffelweyersheim, France), 50 ng Luciferase reporter plasmid. CMV-betaGal plasmid (50 ng) was added to normalize transfection efficiency and pSG5 plasmid was added as a carrier up to 500 ng. Cells were lyzed 48 h after transfection and reporter activities were determined, using standard methods. All transfections were performed in triplicate. Dexamethasone (Dex), RU486, dihydrotestosterone (DHT), trichostatin A (TSA), flutamide and XCT790 were purchased from Sigma Aldrich (St Quentin Falavier, France) and resuspended in DMSO.

The sequences of the siRNAs used to target ERRalpha are as follow: sense 5'-GGCAGAAACCUAUCUCAGGUU-3', antisense 5'-CCUGAGAUAGGUUUCUGCCUC-3'. The siRNA control was provided by Dharmacon (siCONTROL Non-Targeting siRNA #1). Annealed siRNAs were transfected with Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen, Cergy Pontoise, France) into LNCaP cells in 6-well plates first for 48 h. Cells were transfected a second time with siRNAs and then treated for 48 h with XCT790. RNA extraction was performed and mRNA levels for the indicated genes were determined by quantitative PCR (QPCR) and normalized to the 36B4 mRNA level. Parallel cell extracts were prepared for immunoblots.

Cells were lyszed in RIPA buffer (50 mM Tris, pH 7.5; 150 mM NaCl; EDTA 5 mM; 0.5% Nonidet P-40; 0.1% sodium deoxycholate; 0.1% SDS and a cocktail of protease inhibitors) then centrifuged 15 min at 13 200 rpm. After 10 min heating in Laemmli's buffer, proteins (30 microg) were resolved on 8% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, blotted onto nitrocellulose membrane (Amersham Biosciences, Orsay, France) and blocked by incubation at room temperature for 1 h in TBS-Tween 0.1% containing 5% nonfat dry milk. Blots were probed with various Abs (AR, ERRalpha and actin) and developed using an enhanced chemiluminescence detection system (ECL kit, Amersham Biosciences) with appropriate specific peroxydase conjugated Abs. Anti-AR and antiactin antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA, USA) and Sigma Aldrich, respectively. Anti-ERRalpha has raised in rabbit, using a KLH-coupled peptide mapping a region conserved between mouse and human ERRalpha, but divergent in other ERR subfamily member.

ChIP assays were performed as described previously (48). Briefly, LNCaP cells were grown in phenol red-free RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% dextran/charcoal-stripped serum in 150 mm dishes for 3 days, and then treated with or without 10 nM DHT for 2 h. A small portion of the crosslinked, sheared chromatin solution was saved as input DNA, and the remainder was precleared by incubating with 20 mul of preblocked protein A agarose/Salmon Sperm DNA (Upstate Biotech, Chandlers Ford, UK) for 2 h. The precleared chromatin was then immunoprecipitated with 2 mug of anti-AR antibody (H-280, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) or 2 mug of anti-ERRalpha antibody (R&D systems, Minneapolis, MN, USA) with rotation overnight at 4degreesC. The next day, immunoprecipitated DNAs were recovered by incubated with 20 mul of preblocked protein A agarose/Salmon Sperm DNA (Upstate Biotech) for 2 h. The immune complexes were eluted from beads with an elution buffer (1% SDS and 0.1 M NaHCO3). Crosslinking was reverse overnight at 65degreesC and DNAs were purified using QIAquick column (Qiagen, Courtaboeuf, France). Real-time PCR were performed using 2 mul DNA in duplicate on a ABI apparatus using standard PCR cycles. Primers used in this study have been previously described (49). Identical results were obtained when using our own anti-ERRalpha antibody.

To determine whether ERRalpha interacts with steroid signaling, we first focus on androgen signaling in LNCaP cells. These cells were treated with the specific ERRalpha inverse agonist XCT790 for 24 h. As judged by QPCR, this compound reduced the expression of several androgen-responsive genes [PSA/KLK3, NKX3.1, KLK2 and MAK1; (46,50-52)] nearly as efficiently as did flutamide, a specific antiandrogen (Figure 1A). This effect is not due to a general aspecific inhibitory effect of XCT790 since the expression of PGC1-alpha was not modified. As controls, the expression of ERRalpha validated target genes, such as MAO-A, MCAD and RIP140 (53,6) were also down-regulated by XCT790 in LNCaP cells (Figure 1B). No synergy was observed between flutamide and XCT790. The latter acted in a time- and dose-dependent manner (Figure 1C and D, respectively) with a half-maximum efficiency on both PSA and MCAD expression of 5 x 10-6 M, a concentration which we used hereafter. TSA [a histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor] induced in an overexpression of PSA (Figure 1E) as reported (54). Upon cotreatment with TSA and XCT790, PSA expression displayed an intermediate level, suggesting that the two phenomena are independent. XCT790 is thus unlikely to induce HDAC recruitment to the PSA promoter. To assess the specificity of XCT790, LNCaP cells were treated with an siRNA directed against ERRalpha (siE). This treatment had no effect on PSA expression, although it efficiently down-regulated the expression of ERRalpha mRNA and protein (Figure 1F), suggesting that other factors could compensate for the absence of ERRalpha. However, XCT790 had no effect on PSA expression when used on siE-treated cells, indicating that the drug absolutely required ERRalpha to inhibit PSA expression. Figure 1.XCT790 regulates the expression of androgen-responsive genes in LNCaP cells in an ERRalpha-dependent manner. (A) Cells were treated for 24 h with 5 x 10-6 M XCT790, 10-6 M flutamide or a combination of both, as indicated. RNA were extracted, retrotranscribed and analyzed by QPCR.

We next address whether ERRalpha could transcriptionally act on the PSA promoter. To this end, we cotransfected HeLa cells that were chosen because they do not express PSA. Full-length PSA promoter was activated by ERRalpha and by AR (the latter, but not the former, requiring DHT, as expected) (Figure 2A). A deletion construct in which the 5' enhancer was absent displayed a reduced response to AR as published (46), and did not react at all to ERRalpha, suggesting that the deleted 5' region could be involved in the response to both AR and ERRalpha. As expected, activation of the PSA promoter by ERRalpha was inhibited by XCT790 treatment (Figure 2B). To determine whether ERRalpha bound to the endogenous PSA gene, we performed chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) experiments followed by QPCR targeting specific regions of the PSA promoter (Figure 2C). ERRalpha was recruited to the enhancer (Enh) region to a low level, but not to the intermediate (E-P) or promoter (P) regions. Interestingly XCT790, but not DHT, significantly enhanced the recruitment of the receptor specifically to the Enh region. Altogether, this indicates that ERRalpha transcriptionally activates the expression of PSA by binding to its Enh region. XCT790 enhances the binding of the receptor and suppresses its activity.

The above results suggest that ERRalpha could activate transcription through AREs, several copies of which are present in the PSA Enh region. To test this hypothesis, we used other plasmid constructions in which AREs were present in various configurations. A composite rat probasin promoter derivative (ARR2PB; 40) was activated by ERRalpha in a dose-dependent manner without exogenously added DHT (Figure 3A). In contrast to ERRalpha, AR achieved a maximal activation level only in the presence of DHT. ERRalpha also activated transcription from a construct (ARE-Luc) encompassing three androgen response elements (ARE) cloned in front of the minimal collagenase promoter (Figure 3B). DHT supplementation resulted in an additive effect, due to the endogenous expression of AR in HeLa cells (as verified by western blot; data not shown). Importantly ERRalpha activated transcription even in the presence of the antiandrogen flutamide. As expected, AR activated transcription from the ARE-containing plasmid, an effect that was maximal upon DHT supplementation and blunted by flutamide addition. Altogether, this indicates that an ARE is sufficient to confer ERRalpha response to a heterologous promoter. Regulation through AREs was also extended to other members of the ERR subfamily (Figure 3C). Indeed, mouse ERRbeta and gamma, as well as zebra fish ERRalpha-activated transcription of the synthetic ARE-containing promoter. PSA promoter was also activated by mouse ERRbeta and zebra fish, but apparently not by mouse ERRgamma. Some nuclear receptors display two transcription activation functions, one (the AF1) located in the A/B (N-terminal) domain and the other (the AF2) located in the extreme C-terminal part of the molecule. On both reporter constructs, identical effects were observed using the wild-type or an A/B domain-deleted version of ERRalpha. In contrast, this receptor was inactive in the absence of the AF2 function. Thus, as for transactivation on other response elements (38), ERRalpha only requires the AF2 function to activate transcription from the ARE site. Figure 3.AREs confer responsiveness to ERRalpha. (A) HeLa cells were transfected with ARR2PB composite construct together with the indicated amount of ERRalpha- or AR-encoding plasmid. DHT (10-8 M) was added where indicated.

In addition to its direct effect on ERRalpha, XCT790 could act on PSA expression by regulating the expression and/or activity of AR, a hypothesis that we next evaluated. The expression of AR-corresponding mRNA was unaffected by treatment with XCT790, flutamide or a combination of both (Figure 4A). Likewise, AR protein level was not reduced upon drug treatment even after a 72 h exposure. In contrast, XCT790 dramatically reduced the ERRalpha protein level, but not of the corresponding mRNA, a phenomenon that we also have observed in several other cell lines (7). We next addressed whether XCT790 reduced the expression of androgen-responsive genes by merely blocking AR activity. ChIP experiments were first performed to determine whether AR recruitment to regions of the PSA promoter was modified by XCT790 treatment (Figure 4B). As expected, AR bound to the Enh-, as well as to the P- (although to a lower extent), but not to the E-P region of the PSA gene, in a DHT-dependent manner (49). Cotreatment by XCT790 had no effect on the recruitment of AR to the PSA promoter. We then reasoned that if XCT790 blocked AR activity on the PSA promoter, then DHT would be unable to up-regulate gene expression upon XCT790 pretreatment. On the contrary, DHT relieved the inhibition of PSA expression exerted by XCT790 (Figure 4C). Importantly DHT activates PSA expression to a similar extent in the presence or absence of XCT790 (round 2.5-fold). We thus concluded that XCT790 does not impact on AR expression or signaling. Figure 4.XCT790 does not impair androgen signaling. (A) LNCaP cells were treated with the indicated compounds. AR and ERRalpha mRNA expression were analyzed as in Figure 1A. Proteins were extracted and analyzed by western blotting using specific antibody for AR, ERRalpha or actin used as a loading control.

ERRalpha activates transcription through AREs in HeLa and LNCaP cells, which both express AR. It is thus possible that AR is required for this effect of ERRalpha. To address this hypothesis, we performed cotransfection experiments in PC3 cells, which do not express AR (Figure 5A). In these cells, ERRalpha rather repressed the expression driven by the PSA promoter. In contrast, upon AR cotransfection, ERRalpha activated the PSA promoter in a dose-dependent manner. Strikingly, DHT was required for the transactivation by AR, but not for AR to complement ERRalpha activity. The same phenomenon was observed using the ARE-Luc construct. These results indicate that ERRalpha requires AR to activate transcription through ARE. In contrast, AR did not contribute to activation by ERRalpha of the pS2 promoter (which does not respond to AR), indicating a specific effect on androgen-responsive promoters. We next tried to determine the domains of AR involved in helping ERRalpha activation. Chimerae containing the AR-AF1 or -LBD fused to the Gal4 DBD did not complement ERRalpha activity on the PSA promoter indicating that these AR domains are not sufficient for complementation. We then compared the effect of GR derivatives. Cotransfection of wild-type GR resulted in activation of the PSA promoter by ERRalpha. In contrast, GRdim which is defective in DNA binding (42), did not complement ERRalpha. This suggests that the DBD of StRs is necessary to complement ERRalpha-driven ARE transactivation. Figure 5.AR requirement in ERRalpha-induced ARE regulation. (A) PC3 cells were transfected with the indicated reporter plasmids and amounts of ERRalpha- or AR-encoding plasmids. DHT (10-8 M) was added where indicated. (B) Cells were transfected with pPSA-Luc together with the indicated amounts of ERRalpha and 100 ng of the indicated plasmids.

In an effort to extend our findings to other steroid response elements, we next used the MMTV promoter, a well known model of steroid response. Upon cotransfection, ERRalpha by itself was inactive (Figure 6A). However, when supplemented with the PGC1-alpha coactivator, ERRalpha exerted a dose-dependent activation. The same profile was also observed using a construct in which GRE from the metallothionein promoter were cloned in front of the minimal SV promoter. In contrast, constructs harboring multimers of different steroid-unrelated response elements (LEF-RE, responding to TCF/LEF; DR1-Luc, responding to RAR-RXR; PerRE-Luc, responding to Period) were not activated by ERRalpha alone or in combination with PGC1-alpha (Figure 6A and data not shown), indicating that the effect is GRE specific. Activation is also ERRalpha specific, since both MMTV and GRE-Luc constructs were unable to respond to ERalpha, although the latter receptor was active on an estrogen response elements-containing plasmid (Figure 6A and data not shown). However, PGC1-alpha is not specific for ERRalpha activity on the GRE, since cotransfection with SRC1 or GRIP1/TIF2 resulted in the same effect (Figure 5B).

Per definition, transcription from a GRE can be activated by the GR in the presence of glucocorticoids (such as the synthetic drug Dex), an effect that can be abrogated by the addition of synthetic antisteroid compounds such as RU486 (Figure 7A). In contrast, ERRalpha-PGC1-alpha activation through the GRE was unaffected by the presence of both Dex and RU486. This indicates that ERRalpha can activate transcription even in the presence of antisteroid compounds. In addition this also demonstrates that the effect of ERRalpha on the GRE does not result from activation of an endogenous StR, which would be blocked by RU486. In the experiments above, we observed that PGC1-alpha was capable of activating transcription through the GRE when transfected alone, and not only in the presence of exogenous ERRalpha. It is likely that, for this activity, PGC1-alpha requires a transcription factor as a DNA-tethering factor. To determine the nature of this factor, cells were transfected with GRE-Luc construct together with varying amounts of PGC1-alpha and subsequently treated with synthetic compounds (Figure 7B). The activity of PGC1-alpha was completely abrogated by XCT790, but not by RU486 treatment, indicating that it depends on ERRalpha and not on an endogenous StR. However, an enhanced PGC1-alpha effect was observed when activating the GR pathway by Dex treatment. This over-activation could be specifically reversed when adding RU486. There again, XCT790 was required to completely abolish the transcriptional potency of PGC1-alpha. We thus concluded that PGC1-alpha is a promiscuous coactivator that can act through GR and ERRalpha. However in the absence of exogenously added hormones, PGC1-alpha activity on GRE is strictly dependent on ERRalpha. Figure 7.Ligand modulation of ERRalpha/PGC1-alpha transcriptional effects.

Work by various laboratories including ours has pointed to several levels of interference between ERRalpha and estrogen signaling (27). For example, the recently determined in vivo ERRalpha-binding site (55) can also be used as an estrogen response element (28-32). In this report, we show that several genes that can be down-regulated by antiandrogens in LNCaP cells are also subject to repression by XCT790, an ERRalpha inverse agonist. This compound acts in a specific manner since it does not deactivate other ERRs, ERalpha nor AR (this report and ref. 7). Furthermore, whereas the expression of PSA, NKX3.1, KLK2 and MAK is down-regulated by XCT790, such genes as AR, PGC1-alpha or ERRalpha itself are not affected, indicating that the compound is not a general inhibitor of transcription. The effect of XCT790 is dependent on the presence of ERRalpha since the drug has no effect in the absence of the receptor.

Since XCT790 down-regulates the expression of various genes, we expected that overexpression of ERRalpha, brought about by adenoviral vector, would result in the opposite effect. However, in our hands, PSA, NKX3.1 or KLK2 did not respond to ERRalpha overexpression (data not shown). This can be due to a saturating effect of the endogenous ERRalpha protein on the promoters of these genes in LNCaP cells. Alternatively, a stimulating effect of ERRalpha could require the coexpression of a yet unidentified partner. Although active when transiently transfected alone, we also noted that the effect of ERRalpha on the PSA promoter is much lower than that of AR, suggesting that the orphan receptor is a weak activator, or that it lacks the coexpression of a potentializing partner for a maximal effect. The identity of this eventual partner is unknown but PGC1-alpha, bringing no further activation (data not shown), is not a likely candidate.

In contrast to this, the effect of ERRalpha on other than-ARE StREs, requires the coexpression of a coactivator. The effect of ERRalpha on StREs (ARE, GRE or MMTV) also extends to other members of the ERR subfamily, not only to all mouse ERR isoform, but also to zebra fish ERRalpha and ERRgamma as well as to the unique ERR present in the amphioxus [(56,57); Figure 3C and data not shown]. It is thus likely that regulation through StREs is an ancestral property of all ERR receptors.

The regulation of expression exerted by ERRalpha through an ARE/StRE is at the promoter level, as evidenced by the fact that it can be transferred to a heterologous promoter in a specific manner. ERRalpha-responding ARE/StRE include derivatives from the PB, MMTV and metallothionein promoters (Figures 3 and 6) as well as from the nonpalindromic, AR-selective, GR-unresponsive human secretory component gene promoter (44) (data not shown). Given the variety of ARE/StRE used in this study, it seems likely that ERRalpha acts through this response element and not through cryptic ERREs that furthermore could not be detected upon close inspection of the elements. However, direct binding of in vitro synthesized ERRalpha proteins on an ARE/StRE could not be observed in electrophoretic mobility shift experiments (data not shown), suggesting that the receptor may require an additional protein species to bind to ARE/StRE. The capacity to recognize these sequences depends on the P-box of the DBD (58-59). The P-box of ERRalpha is an ER-type (data not shown) which confers recognition of EREs but not of StREs. Consistently, we observed that ERRalpha was recruited to the PSA enhancer but to a lower extent than AR. XCT790 does not only deactivate ERRalpha but also rather transforms the receptor into an actively repressing factor. Two lines of evidence support this hypothesis. First, an siE does not down-regulate PSA expression, indicating that XCT790 does more than merely eliminating the receptor. Second, XCT790 promotes a higher level of ERRalpha recruitment to the PSA promoter. Although this may appear contradictory with XCT790-induced degradation of ERRalpha, it should be reminded that 17beta-estradiol also promotes the degradation of its cognate receptor and its binding to DNA (60,61). Furthermore, binding of ERRalpha on the pS2 promoter in MCF7 cells is not diminished by XCT790 treatment (data not shown) although this also induces the degradation of the receptor in these cells (7). Thus the action of XCT790 at the local (promoter) level, as visualized by ChIP, appears different from its global (whole cell) effect observed by western blot.

Several factors have been identified that transcriptionally regulate androgen-responsive genes. In some cases, this regulation is exerted through perturbation of AR transcriptional activities. This is for instance the case of C/EBPalpha and Ebp1 that act as AR corepressors (62,63). In addition, Ebp1 also down-regulates the expression of AR itself providing an additional indirect control level on the expression of AR-dependent genes (47). None of these mechanisms are likely to explain the effects of the ERRalpha inverse agonist. Indeed, this compound does not perturbate AR expression or activity. This suggests that AR and ERRalpha act in parallel pathways. However, we did not observe any additive effect of antiandrogen and anti-ERRalpha cotreatment, which suggests that both drugs eventually act on a common factor. This apparent discrepancy can be solved when hypothesizing that ERRalpha requires AR to act on androgen-responsive promoter. In support to this, we observed that ERRalpha was capable of activating the PSA promoter in PC3 cells (which do not express AR) only upon AR supplementation. However, it should be noted that an active conformation of AR is not an absolute requirement. Indeed, ERRalpha transactivates through the ARE in the presence of the antiandrogen flutamide in PC3 as well as in HeLa cells (Figure 3B and data not shown). In PC3 cells, ERRalpha can also be complemented by GR to activate the PSA promoter. Interestingly, GRdim is inactive in ERRalpha complementation, indicating that DNA binding by a StR is involved. Consistenly, (i) the AF1 or LBD moiety of AR are not sufficient to promote ERRalpha activity on the PSA promoter, (ii) ERRalpha does not promote the activity of GalAR-AF1 or GalAR-LBD on Gal4-binding sites (data not shown). Altogether, this suggests that ERRalpha does not directly bind to the ARE but establishes transient contacts with a DNA-bound StR. XCT790 stabilizes these contacts and also induces a repressing conformation of ERRalpha, leading to promoter repression. Interestingly, this is unlikely to be mediated by HDAC recruitment.

Androgens play an essential role in prostate physiology. Prostate cancers are androgen-dependent for their growth, at least in the initial phases of the disease (64,65). Antiandrogen-based therapies are therefore widely used in the treatment of prostate tumors. Unfortunately, these tumors eventually develop resistance to antiandrogens, a phenomenon that lead to poor prognosis. Our results show that ERRalpha is able to stimulate the expression of androgen-responsive genes, even in the presence of antiandrogen. Our data may thus suggest that ERRalpha overexpression could help the cells to bypass the block exerted by antiandrogens. Through this, ERRalpha could play a role in the acquisition of androgen resistance in advanced prostate tumors. It has been shown that ERRalpha is indeed expressed in the prostate and in human prostatic cell lines (66). An eventual link between resistance to antiandrogen therapy and ERRalpha expression has not yet been investigated, but it should be noted that high ERRalpha expression is associated to poor prognosis in ovarian, breast and colon tumors (22-26). ERRalpha is active on ARE/StRE-containing promoters in the presence of the antisteroid synthetic compounds RU486 and flutamide. Our results lead to the hypothesis that a complete repression of such genes not only requires to inactivate the StRs but also the ERR family members.
