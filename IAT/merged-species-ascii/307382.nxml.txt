We have isolated a unique genomic fragment encoding human ribonuclease 4 (RNase 4) of the mammalian ribonuclease gene family, whose members include pancreatic ribonuclease, eosinophil-derived neurotoxin, eosinophil cationic protein and angiogenin. We have determined that the coding sequence of RNase 4 resides on a single exon found on human chromosome 14. The mRNA encoding RNase 4 was detected by Northern analysis in a number of human somatic tissues, including pancreas, lung, skeletal muscle, heart, kidney and placenta, but not brain; liver represents the most abundant source. Interestingly, the mRNA encoding RNase 4 is approximately 2 kb in length, which is approximately twice as large as the mRNAs encoding other members of this gene family. A larger (approximately 2.4 kb), second transcript was detected in hepatic, pancreatic and renal tissues. The approximately 2 kb RNase 4 mRNA was detected in cells of the human promyelocytic leukemia line, HL-60, that had been treated with dibutyryl-cAMP to promote neutrophilic differentiation. In contrast, no mRNA encoding RNase 4 could be detected in cells treated with phorbol myristic acid (PMA), an agent promoting differentiation toward monocyte/macrophages, suggesting the existence of elements regulating tissue specific expression of this gene.
