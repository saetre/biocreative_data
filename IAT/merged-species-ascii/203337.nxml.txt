DNA nucleases (DNases) perform a wide variety of important cellular functions and are also very useful for research and in biotechnological applications. Due to the biological and technological importance of DNases and their use in a wide range of applications, DNase activity assays are essential. Traditional DNase assays employ radiolabeled DNA substrates and require separation of the products of the reaction from the unreacted substrate before quantification of enzyme activity. As a consequence, these methods are discontinuous. In this report, we describe a continuous DNase assay based on the differential fluorescence output of a DNA dye ligand called PicoGreen(R). The assay was developed to characterize a processive dsDNA exonuclease, lambda exonuclease. The assay appears to have general utility as it is also suitable for measuring the DNA digestion activities of a processive helicase/nuclease, RecBCD, a distributive exonuclease, T7 gene 6 exonuclease, and an endonuclease, DNaseI. The benefits of, and limitations to, the method are discussed.

DNases are involved in a wide range of cellular functions, including but not limited to DNA repair (1), replication (2), recombination (3), natural transformation (4) and protection against viruses (i.e., restriction) (5). Besides their important cellular functions, DNases have also proved very useful in research and biotechnology. The routinely used applications include restriction mapping, plasmid construction and cloning, site-directed mutagenesis, preparation of DNA sequencing templates, removal of contaminating linear DNA from plasmid preparations (6) and even as therapeutic agents (7).

Due to the biological importance of DNases and their use in a wide range of applications, DNase activity assays are essential. Most of the available DNase assays are discontinuous (8,9), require radiolabeled substrates (see for example 10-13) and are laborious. There are many advantages of using real-time (i.e., continuous) assays over discontinuous assays, particularly in dissecting the molecular mechanisms of enzymes and their regulation. Continuous nuclease assays are relatively less laborious than discontinuous assays and save time. Furthermore, the effects of chemicals or physical perturbations on the catalytic action of an enzyme can be seen in real time and be used to inform changes in the ongoing experimental conditions. Finally, the method can be easily adjusted and optimized for high throughput systems.

Continuous assays commonly employ properties of fluorescence for a real-time readout. Fluorescent techniques are becoming regular features in molecular biology and biochemistry laboratories and are sensitive and low cost (considering radiochemical disposal fees and suchlike). There are examples of fluorometric assays developed for proteases, helicases and nucleases (14-16). However these typically involve substrate analogs (e.g., 2-aminopurine), conjugates of substrates and fluorophores (e.g., fluoroscein isothiocyanate derivates) or fluorescent donor-receptor pairs (e.g., fluoroscein and tetramethyl rhodamine), but these are high cost and limit substrate choices to those that the investigator synthesizes. Fluorescent dye ligands are readily available and commonly used in laboratories for detection of biomolecules like proteins and nucleic acids, with the most common application being detection of nucleic acids after separation through agarose gels by, for example, ethidium bromide. Many fluorescent dyes have been commercially developed for investigators to explore, especially by Molecular Probes in Eugene, OR. Their dye products have been employed in discontinuous assays of nucleases and in continuous assay of a robust DNA helicase, but have not been reported to be used in continuous nuclease assays.

Lambda exonuclease (lambdaExo, EC 3.1.11.3) is the founding member of a large family of SynExo recombination nucleases (17) and is sold commercially as a DNA processing enzyme. The structure of lambdaExo (18) is consistent with a model for its mechanism whereby dsDNA is resected 5'-->3' and the enzyme becomes encircled around the 3' ssDNA product to create a processive complex (18,19). The dimensions of the central channel of lambdaExo are only large enough to accommodate dsDNA at one end of the tapered channel but only ssDNA at the other (18). As anticipated by the restrictions in channel diameter, bulky fluorescent adducts and dyes inhibit lambdaExo activity. To find a dye that yields a high difference in quantum yield when DNA is digested but does not inhibit lambdaExo activity, we surveyed some commonly used fluorescent dyes. Among these, PicoGreen(R) was found to be the least inhibitory. This paper reports studies conducted utilizing this dye to optimize a real-time DNase assay (ReDA) protocol that is effective as a general method to assay DNA nucleases. A schematic representation of the logic of the ReDA method is shown in Figure 1. We discuss the limitations of using dye ligands and demonstrate how to easily employ ReDA for detailed enzyme activity studies using any dsDNA substrate without relying on chemical synthesis. Evidence of the general utility of the method for studying endonucleases, helicase/nucleases, and exonucleases that possess diverse mechanisms is provided.

Reaction conditions. All reactions were carried out at the ambient temperature inside the spectrofluorometer (approximately25degreesC). Reaction mixtures (2 ml) consisted of 50 pM PstI linearized pUC19::DeltaKpnI molecules (100 pM ends), 1/20 000 diluted PicoGreen(R), 1x buffer (50 mM HEPES pH 7.5, 1 mM DTT), 2.5 mM MgCl2 and varying amounts of enzyme (lambdaExo, RecBCD, T7 gene 6 exonuclease, DNase I). After adding the buffer, substrate and PicoGreen(R) into the cuvette, the solution was incubated in the fluorometer, in the dark, for 3-5 min with continuous stirring. Data collection was started and after 60 s, MgCl2 was added through the injection port by means of a Hamilton syringe to initiate DNase activity, and the fluorescence output was continuously measured.

Control reactions. As the negative control, a reaction mixture without the enzyme was prepared and read in the fluorometer. The positive control for lambdaExo was prepared as follows: Substrate DNA was boiled for 10-15 min, immediately transferred into ice/water and let to stand for at least 3 min before being added into a reaction mixture to a final concentration of 0.025 nM which is half the mass of the starting material to mimic 100% digestion of the substrate by lambdaExo. This solution was then read in the fluorometer. The differential fluorescence of the dsDNA substrate and half mass of the dsDNA substrate, denatured, sets the limits of the bandwidth of the assay as described (19,20).

Different commercially available fluorescent DNA dyes interact with DNA through different mechanisms. As a consequence, some dyes are likely to be better reagents for developing continuous nuclease assays than others, depending on how they interfere with recognition of the DNA substrate by the nuclease under study. For example, ethidium bromide intercalates between DNA base pairs and therefore interacts more strongly with dsDNA than with ssDNA or free nucleotides (21). SYBR Gold(R) is an asymmetrical cyanine dye. It interacts equally well with dsDNA and ssDNA but not with free nucleotides (22). Its mechanism of DNA binding is not well understood but the binding mechanism of cyanine dyes, in general, is thought to be through DNA intercalation and by interacting with the DNA minor groove (23,24). We initially surveyed the inhibition of nuclease activity by dyes by titrating dyes into lambdaExo reactions and examined the ability of lambdaExo to degrade the substrate after a fixed period of incubation by separating the substrates and products by agarose gel electrophoresis. Ethidium bromide inhibited lambdaExo over the range of dye concentrations that were tested (Fig. 2). Likewise, SYBR Gold(R) is an inappropriate choice of fluorescent dye for this enzyme as it inhibits digestion (Fig. 2) and also fails to discriminate between dsDNA and ssDNA (22). PicoGreen(R) partially inhibited lambdaExo at high dye concentrations, but could be diluted to a concentration that no longer inhibited the nuclease yet retained a differential fluorescent output during DNA digestion to permit quantification (Fig. 2 and following figures). Therefore we determined that PicoGreen(R) was a suitable dye to employ in this assay.

Determination of PicoGreen(R) concentration. To optimize the use of PicoGreen(R) in the continuous DNase activity assay, we performed initial lambdaExo reactions using an amount of lambdaExo that half saturates the ends of the linearized plasmid (PstI cut pUC19::DeltaKpnI) substrate at 25degreesC in a 2 ml reaction in a 3 ml cuvette in our spectrofluorometer (Photon Technologies International QuantumMaster). Reaction mixtures contained different dilutions of PicoGreen(R) and were initiated by addition of MgCl2 to 2.5 mM. MgCl2 was injected into the cuvette through an injection port positioned above the cuvette. This permitted us to keep the sample in the darkened reaction chamber under constant illumination at 484 nm by the arc lamp source and with steady measurement of the output fluorescence, as measured at 522 nm. When the needle enters the cuvette, there is a fluctuation in the signal due to light scattering. Furthermore, upon injection, there usually is a spike that marks the initiation of the reaction. Immediately following injection, the fluorescence decreases very rapidly to a certain value, due to dilution of the mixture and the addition of magnesium (as noted by Molecular Probes). After this, the fluorescence intensity continues to decrease in an enzyme-dependent manner. In the absence of the enzyme, after the initial decrease upon injection, the signal decreases slowly over time possibly due to photobleaching of the fluorophore. The results of this titration (data not shown) support the initial interpretation of the agarose gel data, indicating that at higher concentrations, PicoGreen(R) inhibits lambdaExo activity but that at lower concentrations (1/20 000 dilution of the PicoGreen(R) stock into the reaction mixture), lambdaExo is not inhibited but the difference in fluorescence yield is sufficient to measure rates of lambdaExo activity. We employed a 1/20 000 dilution of PicoGreen(R) in the reactions thereafter.

DNA calibration. Since we were using a concentration of PicoGreen(R) well below what is suggested and shown to be in the linear range of dsDNA detection by Molecular Probes, we checked the linearity of the signal in the assays. To do this, the DNA substrate was titrated into reaction mixtures without the enzyme and read in the fluorometer the same way as reading an enzyme reaction (data not shown).

Results showed that the signal was not linear and needed to be transformed based on a calibration curve. Calibration curves for each datum of the reaction were constructed and a second order polynomial equation (Y = A x X2 + B) was fit to these data with the variable parameters A and B calculated and used for correcting and converting the fluorescent signal at that second to DNA concentration. By performing this calculation, the fluorescent signal can be accurately converted to DNA concentration. By performing this correction throughout the assay time, the data are also corrected for any enzyme independent signal change such as by photobleaching.

lambdaExo. To determine if ReDA is quantitative, we titrated a fixed quantity of DNA with varying amounts of lambdaExo and measured rates of DNA hydrolysis. The results indicate that the assay is quantitative (Figs 3 and 4). Under stoichiometric binding conditions, there is a linear increase in the rate of hydrolysis as lambdaExo concentration is increased until the enzyme saturates the linear substrate DNA ends. At that point, the rate no longer increases, as expected. Using this assay, we determined the fraction of this preparation of lambdaExo that was active, at pH 7.5 (2.4%) and at pH 9.4 (0.8%), assuming a stoichiometry of one lambdaExo trimer per dsDNA end (18), illustrating another use of the assay (determination of fractional activity of nuclease preparations for detailed kinetic studies).

The raw fluorescence data were manipulated as follows. First, fluorescent data were converted to substrate concentration by using the DNA-fluorescence calibration curve as described above. Then, the data were truncated to eliminate the non-linear part of the progress curve, including the initial reading prior to mixing, the spikes due to insertion of the needle and the rapid decrease due to injection of MgCl2. The data points were then normalized so that all the initial values were the same arbitrary value. When the data were collected as duplicates or triplicates, the data were averaged in the next step of calculations to get a single data set for each enzyme concentration. Next, each data set corresponding to an enzyme concentration was converted to percent digestion by setting the negative control (no enzyme reaction) as 0% and the positive control (boiled half mass of substrate) as 100% (20) (Fig. 5). Finally, percentage values were converted to number of base pairs by setting the number of base pairs found in the full-length substrate as 100%.

To calculate the rates, the initial linear parts of the curves were fit to a linear equation. The slope in the equation gives the rate of the reaction in terms of nucleotides digested per second. Since each DNA molecule has two ends that can simultaneously be digested, half of this calculated rate gives the rate of digestion in terms of nucleotides digested per second/DNA end. Assuming that one lambdaExo trimer binds to an end of DNA and catalyzes hydrolysis, our experiments suggest that the rate of lambdaExo digesting pUC19:DeltaKpnI at pH 7.5 at room temperature is 4-5 nucleotides s-1 (lambdaExo trimer)-1, similar to our estimates from discontinuous assays of lambdaExo (19).

RecBCD. A fluorometric assay of RecBCD helicase activity was previously reported by Eggleston and Kowalczykowski (15). In their studies, they identified a number of dye ligands that could be used under conditions that suppressed the nuclease activity of RecBCD, namely, at [ATP] > [Mg2+]. We assayed RecBCD under conditions that support the highest levels of nuclease activity, namely 25 microM [ATP] and 2.5 mM [Mg2+] (i.e., [Mg2+] > [ATP]). Our results show that the ReDA assay can be used for measuring the nuclease activity of RecBCD enzyme in real time (Fig. 6).

Other enzymes. The PicoGreen(R) reagent is suitable for following the digestion of DNA by various types of nucleases in real time. Besides lambdaExo and RecBCD enzymes, T7 gene 6 exonuclease and DNaseI were also examined. Although they all are DNases, each of the enzymes examined in this study have a different reaction mechanism. lambdaExo is a processive exonuclease, producing 5'-mononucleotides and ssDNA (25); T7 gene 6 is a distributive exonuclease (26), producing 5'-mononucleotides (27); RecBCD is a processive helicase-endonuclease that acts in a concerted fashion as an exonuclease producing short single stranded oligonucleotides (28); and DNaseI is an endonuclease that creates single-strand DNA nicks that quickly accumulate to yield double strand breaks producing short double stranded DNA molecules with most of the terminal products being dinucleotides (29,30).

As with any other DNA ligand, PicoGreen(R) may be inhibitory to other DNA processing enzymes that may be used with this assay system. We strongly recommend determining the inhibitory effect of PicoGreen(R) on any particular enzyme empirically, before using the reported assay method.

The assay has the potential to be optimized and used for high throughput applications, such as searching for inhibitors or cofactors of DNA processing enzymes. There is precedence for similar applications (31). By using robotics, multi-well plates and fast microplate fluorescence readers or area detectors, it is possible to start several reactions at once and follow them in a certain time period by automatically sampling time points.

Besides being used as an assay for studying DNases, the method can be modified for assaying RNases, as well. An RNA substrate and an RNA binding fluorescent dye that has high fluorescence output difference in the bound and unbound states, might be used to test RNase activity of enzymes. A similar method was published by Kwon and Carson (32). While they prepared their substrate by incorporating fluorescein-labeled ribonucleotide into an RNA substrate by in vitro transcription, based on our method, we suggest using a fluorescent dye that can just be added, easily and conveniently, into an RNA preparation to prepare the substrate for the purpose of assaying RNase activity in vitro.

 Schematic representation of the ReDA reaction. PicoGreen(R) has low fluorescent output when not bound to dsDNA (yellow rectangles). Upon binding to dsDNA, the fluorescence output of PicoGreen(R) increases (distorted yellow rectangles). When lambdaExo (red ellipses) is added, it binds to the ends of the dsDNA, and upon addition of Mg2+, it starts digesting DNA 5' to 3', producing 3' overhangs and free deoxyribonucleotide monophosphates (blue rectangles). During digestion, PicoGreen(R) is displaced and its fluorescence output decreases (19,20).
