###begin p 1
Minimal secondary structures of the bacterial and plastid tmRNAs were derived by comparative analyses of 50 aligned tmRNA sequences. The structures include 12 helices and four pseudoknots and are refinements of earlier versions, but include only those base pairs for which there is comparative evidence. Described are the conserved and variable features of the tmRNAs from a wide phylogenetic spectrum, the structural properties specific to the bacterial subgroups and preliminary 3-dimensional models from the pseudoknotted regions.
