Large conductance calcium-activated potassium channel (BKCa) plays an important role in the control of uterine contractility during pregnancy. The change from uterine quiescence to enhanced contractile activity may be associated with the spatial and temporal expression of BKCa within myometrium. The objectives of this study were to examine the expression of BKCa alpha- and beta-subunit in upper segment (US) and lower segment (LS) regions of uterus, and to investigate for the possibly differential expression of these proteins in US and LS myometrium obtained from three functional states: (1) non-pregnant (NP); (2) term pregnant not in labour (TNL) and (3) term pregnant in labour (TL).

Myometrial biopsies were collected from non-pregnant women at hysterectomy and pregnant women at either elective caesarean section or emergency caesarean section. Protein expression level and cellular localization of BKCa alpha- and beta-subunit in US and LS myometrium were determined by Western blot analysis and immunohistochemistry, respectively.

BKCa alpha- and beta-subunit were predominantly localized to myometrial smooth muscle in both US and LS myometrium obtained from non-pregnant and pregnant patients. The level of BKCa alpha-subunit in US but not in LS was significantly higher in NP myometrium than those measured in myometrium obtained during pregnancy. Lower expression of BKCa alpha-subunit in both US and LS was found in TL than in TNL biopsies. Expression of beta-subunit in both US and LS myometrium was significantly reduced in TL group compared with those measured in TNL group. There was no significant difference in BKCa beta-subunit expression in either US or LS between NP and TNL group.

During most of pregnancy, myometrium activity is characterized by poorly coordinated contractures. In late pregnancy, the uterus undergoes preparedness for the stimuli that lead to contractility and labour [1,2]. The mechanisms that initiate labour in women, particularly the molecular processes that convert the myometrium form a state of relative quiescence to the activated and contractile state, are not well understood. An understanding of these processes, at the molecular and cellular level, is essential to developing novel therapeutic strategies for management of associated clinical problems such as preterm labour that accounts for 85% of all perinatal complications and death.

It has been known that uterine myometrial contractility at term is triggered by a number of physiological signals, which orchestrate changes in uterine excitability via ion-channel modulation [3,4]. Potassium channels are central to regulation of cell membrane potential and contractility of smooth muscle [4,5]. Among the diverse families of K+ channels, the large conductance calcium-activated potassium channel (BKCa) is the predominant K+-channel type expressed in human myometrium [6,7]. This channel is activated by membrane depolarization and also by an increase in the intracellular calcium concentration, thereby playing a pivotal role in the modulation of uterine contractility and myometrial calcium homeostasis [3,4,8-10]. Electrophysiological studies have demonstrated changes in BKCa activity during pregnancy. It was reported by Wang et al. [11] that the contribution of BKCa channels to the total outward K+ currents was reduced by about 10% in pregnant myocyte near term compared with non-pregnant myocyte. Khan and colleagues had shown that the sensitivity of Ca2+ and voltage of this channel in human pregnant myometrium was lost at the time of labor [7]. A number of studies suggested altered BKCa expression in myometrium during pregnancy and parturition. Song et al. [12] worked on rat and found that BKCa is decreased by 60% in the myometrium of pregnant rats at the end of pregnancy. Benkusky and co-workers [13] reported that BKCa in mouse myometrium is increased during pregnancy and diminished in post-partum. Studies by Khan's group demonstrated BKCa expression in lower segment of human term myometrium and found it is decreased in labour onset [14,15].

It has been implicated that there is a functional regionalization in the myometrium during pregnancy and labour. The upper segment (US) region of the uterus expands to accommodate the growing fetus and then at labour contract to cause expulsion of the fetus, while the lower segment (LS) may maintain a relative quiescence to allow passage of the fetus [16]. Current data about BKCa expression in human myometrium during pregnancy are restricted to the LS [14,15,17]. There is no information concerning the expression of BKCa in the different region of uterus during pregnancy and labour that would support its role in the regulation of uterus contractions.

The objectives of the present study were to determine the regional distribution of the BKCa channel in human non-pregnant and term myometrium before and during parturition. Protein levels of BKCa channel were also examined by Western blotting to establish whether the expression of these proteins is changed in pregnancy and labour.

Non-pregnant myometrium tissues were obtained from premenopausal, normal, cycling women (mean age 41 +/- 4.3 yr, n = 8) undergoing hysterectomy for fibroids. Pregnant myometrial biopsies were collected at cesarean section form the following groups of pregnant women (37-42 wk): term no labour (mean age, 25 +/- 2.2 yr, mean gestational age,39 +/- 1.7 weeks, n = 10) and term labour (mean age 26 +/- 2.3 yr, mean gestational age, 39 +/- 1.6 weeks n = 10). Labour was defined as regular contractions (<5 min apart) plus membrane rupture and cervical dilation (>3 cm) with no augmentation (oxytocin or PG administration). Indications for cesarean section included breech presentation, placenta previa, previous cesarean section, cephalopelvic disproportion, failure of labour to progress, fetal distress, or maternal request. None of the women included in this study had evidence of underlying disease (e.g. hypertension, diabetes, preeclampsia, intrauterine growth restriction, etc.). LS uterine samples were collected from the upper margin of the LS uterine incision, while US uterine samples were taken from just below fundus. Because there is no LS in non-pregnant uterus, tissues taken from the isthmus of non-pregnant uterus were treated to be equivalent to the LS of pregnant uterus. All non-pregnant tissues were taken from the normal part of uterus without fibrosis contamination. Collected samples were placed in phosphate-buffered saline on ice and transported to the laboratory. For Western blot analysis, tissues were then frozen immediately in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80degreesC. For immunohistochemical analysis, the biopsies were placed in 10% phosphate buffered formalin.

Immunohistochemical investigations were performed with the Histostain-SP kit (Zymed, San Franscisco, CA), which uses a biotinylated second antibody, a horseradish peroxidase-streptavidin conjugate, and a substrate-chormogen mixture to demonstrate antigen in the tissue. The specific antibodies, anti-alpha1184-1200 and anti-beta1-191, were purchased from Alomone Labs (Alomone Labs Ltd. Jerusalem, Israel) and Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. Santa Cruz, CA), respectively. The anti-alpha1184-1200 antibody recognizes amino acid residues 1184-1200 at the C terminus of the alpha-subunit. Anti-beta1-191 antibody recognizes full length residues of beta-subunit. Paraffin sections (5 mum) were cut, rehydrated and microwaved in citric acid buffer to retrieve antigens. After inhibition of endogenous peroxidases with 3% H2O2, unspecific antibody binding was blocked with 10% rabbit serum for 30 min. The tissue sections were then incubated with specific antibody against BKCa alpha- or beta-subunit (1:500). The bound antibodies were detected with the biotin-streptavidin-peroxidase system (UltraSensitive-SP-kit, MaiXin Biotechnology, Fuzhou, China) using diaminobenzidine (Sigma) as chromogen. Counterstaining was performed with hemalum. Negative controls were performed by substituting primary antibody with a normal serum in same dilution. To confirm the specificity of primary antibody, preabsorption of the primary antibody with a ten-fold excess of the blocking peptides was performed.

Approximately 70 mg of human myometrial tissue was homogenized in ice-cold lysis buffer consisting of 60 mM Tris-HCl, 2% sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), 10% sucrose, 2 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany), 1 mM sodium orthovanadate (Sigma-Aldrich), 10 mug/ml aprotinin (Bayer, Leverkusen, Germany). Lysates were then quickly ultrasonicated in ice bath, boiled 5 min at 95 C, and stored at -80degreesC until used. Protein concentrations were measured using a modified Bradford assay and samples were diluted in sample buffer (250 mM Tris-HCl (pH 6.8), containing 4% SDS, 10% glycerol, 2% beta-mercaptoethanol, and 0.002% bromophenol blue) and boiled for a further 5 min. Samples were separated on an SDS-8% polyacrylamide gel, and the proteins were electrophoretically transferred to a nitrocellulose filter at 300 mA for 1.5 h in a transfer buffer containing 20 mM Tris, 150 mM glycine, and 20% methanol. The filter was then blocked in TBS containing 0.1% Tween-20(TBST) and 5% dried milk powder (wt/vol) for 2 h at room temperature. After three washes with TBST, the nitrocellulose filters were incubated with primary antibody for BKCa alpha- or beta-subunit (1:500) at 4degreesC overnight. After another three washes with TBST, the filters were incubated with a secondary horseradish peroxidase-conjugated IgG (1:1000) for 1 h at room temperature and further washed for 30 min with TBST. Immunoreactive proteins were visualized using the enhanced chemiluminescence Western blotting detection system (Santa Cruz). The light-emitting bands were detected with X-ray film. The resulting band intensities were quantitated using an image scanning densitometer (Furi Technology, Shanghai, China). To control sampling errors, the ratio of band intensities to beta-actin was obtained to quantify the relative protein expression level.

Positive immunoreactivity for BKCa alpha-and beta-subunit was identified in both US and LS myometrium from non-pregnant and pregnant women. Immunohistochemistry revealed that BKCa alpha- and beta-subunit were predominantly localized to smooth muscle cells of myometrium. Smooth muscle cells lining blood vessel were also positively stained for these proteins (Fig 1 and 2). Immunoreactivity was abolished when the antibody was preabsorbed with excess peptide, thereby confirming the specificity of antibody (Fig 1E and 1F).

The present study demonstrated, for the first time, the expression of alpha- and beta-subunit of BKCa in paired US and LS tissues from non-pregnant and pregnant women. BKCa alpha- and beta-subunit were mainly localized to myometrial smooth muscle cells in the US and LS. The levels of these proteins were significantly down-regulated in both US and LS at the time of labour.

Studies by Khan's group showed that the expression of both BKCa alpha- and beta-subunit in LS region of uterus was significantly reduced during labour [14,15]. Curley et al. [17] also found decreased mRNA level of the alpha-subunit of BKCa in LS with labour onset. In consistence with the above studies, the present study also showed the labour associated decrease in the expression of alpha- and beta-subunit proteins within LS myometrium. In addition, we also investigated the localization and expression pattern of BKCa within US during pregnancy and labour. Our data suggest that alpha- and beta-subunit of BKCa in US region is significantly down-regulated at the onset of labour.

Current data outlining pregnancy associated expression of BKCa protein in LS region of human uterus are not fully consistent. Zhou et al. [18] reported that BKCa alpha-subunit protein in LS region remained virtually unchanged in pregnant human myometrium, compared to non-pregnant myometrium, whereas beta-subunit protein was lower in pregnant tissues than in non-pregnant tissues. Matharoo-Ball et al. [15] showed that BKCa alpha-subunit was increased whereas beta-subunit was decreased during pregnancy compared to the non-pregnant state. However, no studies to date appear to have examined BKCa in US myometrium of pregnant and non-pregnant women. In the present study, within LS region, no significant pregnancy associated changes in the expression of either alpha- or beta-subunit were observed. Within US, alpha-subunit expression was decreased in pregnancy. In animal studies, a decrease in BKCa alpha-subunit protein levels close to or at term in rat myometrium [12] and an increase in the expression of BKCa alpha and beta1 subunit throughout gestation in mouse myometrium [19] have been reported.

A lot of studies indicate differential expression of a variety of proteins including connexin-43, G proteins and prostaglandin receptors between US and LS myometrium with labour [20-24], which support the idea that increased contractility of the fundus compared to the lower segment during labour. However, similar expression levels of a few contraction-associated proteins (CAPs) in US and LS with labour have also been reported [21,25,26]. For instance, Havelock et al. [26] showed that S100A9 mRNA was up-regulated in both US and LS during labour. Our results indicate that the similar expression pattern of BKCa in US and LS is occurred with the onset of labour. Together, it suggests that the contractile activity of US or LS region is not likely to be determined by a single specific protein but rather by a combination of all CAPs.

The smooth muscle BKCa channel is formed by tetrameric assembly of an alpha subunit and an accessory beta-subunit [27]. The alpha-subunit forms the functional BKCa channel [28,29]. The presence of the beta-subunit confers BKCa with higher Ca2+ and voltage sensitivity [10,30]. Thus, reduced expression of BKCa alpha- and beta-subunit would permit an increase intracellular Ca2+ levels without permit an increase opposing K+ conductance, thereby enhancing contractility of smooth muscle. Because the BKCa channel is particular abundant in uterine myocytes, a reduction of this channel in protein level would translate into a considerable shift toward electrical excitability in the human uterus and likely promote contractile activity.

Our results indicate that BKCa alpha- and beta-subunit are predominately localized to myometrial cells in US and LS region of pregnant and non-pregnant human uterus. It has been implicated that, at the time of labour, the uterus differentiates into the highly contractile activity. Because BKCa channel play a pivotal role in the modulation of uterine excitability and contractility, the down-regulation of BKCa channel expression in myometrium following labour may contribute, in part, to the enhanced contractility during parturition.
