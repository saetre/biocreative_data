We have isolated from human liver libraries two cytochrome P450 cDNA clones (lambda MP14 and lambda MP3) which are highly similar (83% over the coding region) to mouse testosterone 15 alpha hydroxylase and are therefore part of the cytochrome P450IIA gene subfamily. The P450IIA (CYP2A) gene subfamily was found to be closely linked to the P450IIB (CYP2B) subfamily and their chromosomal location could not be distinguished using somatic cell hybrids containing fragments of chromosome 19 between 19q12 and 19q13.2. Pulsed field gel electrophoresis indicates that both gene subfamilies are contained within 350-kb genomic DNA fragments, but were separated using various restriction enzymes. Northern blot analysis identified three P450IIA mRNAs each showing a wide inter-individual variation in their levels in the liver. High levels of P450IIA transcript were associated with high levels of P450IIB transcript suggesting that common factors may influence the expression of genes within these subfamilies. Genetic analysis has suggested previously that a member of the P450IIB subfamily is responsible for coumarin hydroxylase activity in the mouse. We discuss the possibility, based on our findings of tight linkage of the human P450IIA and IIB subfamilies, that a member of the IIA subfamily is a better candidate for this enzyme activity.
