Elongation factor-1 messenger-RNA levels in cultured cells are high compared to tissue and are not drastically affected further by oncogenic transformation.

Copy-DNA clones covering the complete coding sequence of human Elongation Factor-1 gamma mRNA have been isolated and characterized. The expression of Elongation Factor-1 in a variety of cell lines and a number of tissues shows a large increase in Elongation Factor-1 mRNA going from tissue to cultured cells (20-fold). Messenger-RNA levels for Elongation Factor-1 alpha, -1 beta and -1 gamma increase in parallel suggesting coordinate regulation of the expression of these genes. Oncogenic transformation in vitro does not strongly affect Elongation Factor-1 mRNA levels.
