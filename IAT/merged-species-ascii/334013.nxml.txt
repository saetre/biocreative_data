We have characterized a recombinant Drosophila melanogaster RNA binding protein, D25, by virtue of its antigenic relationship to mammalian U1 and U2 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein (U snRNP) proteins. Sequence analysis revealed that D25 bears strong similarity to both the human U1 snRNP-A (U1-A) and U2 snRNP-B" (U2-B") proteins. However, at residues known to be critical for the RNA binding specificities of U1-A and U2-B" D25 sequence is more similar to U2-B". Using direct RNA binding assays D25 selected U1 RNA from either HeLa or Drosophila Kc cell total RNA. Furthermore, D25 bound U1 RNA when transfected into mammalian cells. Thus, D25 appears to be a Drosophila homolog of the mammalian U1-A protein, despite its sequence similarity to U2-B".
