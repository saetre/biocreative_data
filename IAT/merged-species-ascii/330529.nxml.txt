Distinct atrial and ventricular isoforms of myosin light chain 1 (LC1) exist in mammals. The atrial LC1 is also expressed in fetal ventricular and skeletal muscle. Here we present a full length cDNA encoding a rat atrial LC1, based upon homology with previously reported LC1 sequences and its atrial-specific pattern of RNA hybridization in adult cardiac muscle. Atrial and ventricular RNA expression were studied during rat development and with chronic hypertension. Atrial LC1 mRNA was expressed in rat atria throughout development, and was coexpressed with ventricular LC1 mRNA in the hearts of 12-day and 16-day embryos, and in the ventricles of newborn rats (less than 24 hours). In 9 day-old neonates, atrial LC1 mRNA expression was restricted to rat atrium. In adult rats exhibiting renovascular hypertension, the expression of the atrial and ventricular LC1 mRNAs was unchanged from that seen in normal control animals.
