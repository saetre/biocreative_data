We report the DNA sequence of a cDNA clone complementary to the 5' end of the chick pro alpha 2(I) mRNA. The sequence enables us to deduce the amino acid sequence of this region, which has been refractory to conventional protein sequencing techniques. Its importance lies in the role of the prepropeptide in secretion, triple helix formation of the mature protein and initiation of fibrillogenesis. We have also located four of the five exons which code for this region on the genome. One exon is only 11bp in size and appears to code exclusively for the signal propeptidase cleavage site. This is an extreme example of an exon defining a functional unit.
