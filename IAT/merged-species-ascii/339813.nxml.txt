We have determined the complete nucleotide sequence of the tag gene, encoding 3-methyladenine DNA glycosylase I from Escherichia coli. From the nucleotide sequence it is deduced that the tag enzyme consists of 187 amino-acids and has a calculated molecular weight of 21.1 kdaltons. The tag enzyme is unusually rich in cysteine (8 residues) with a cluster of three consecutive cysteines near the C-terminal end. The tag coded DNA glycosylase does not show significant sequence homology to the alkA coded glycosylase in spite of that both of these enzymes catalyze the release of free 3-methyladenine from alkylated DNA.
