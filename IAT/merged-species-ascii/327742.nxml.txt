Poly A-containing RNA enriched in prolactin-coding sequences was isolated from female rate pituitaries after induction with diethylstilbesterol. Double stranded cDNA was synthesized from this RNA and inserted into plasmid pBR322 at the Pst I site via the poly(dG):polyy(dC) tailing method. E. coli was transformed with this DNA and the recombinant plasmid in one of the transformants characterized in detail. About half of its 900 base pair cDNA insert was sequenced. The DNA sequence is consistent with most of the reported amino acid sequence of rat preprolactin. In addition, the recombinant plasmids in two of the other transformants appear to contain growth hormone coding sequences.
