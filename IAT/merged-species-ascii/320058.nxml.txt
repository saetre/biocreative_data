The mouse major urinary proteins (MUPs) are the products of a multi-gene family of 30-35 genes whose members exhibit diverse tissue specific, developmental, and hormonal controls. Three cDNA clones corresponding to liver MUP mRNAs have been sequenced. Two of the clones (p499, C57BL/6 and p1057, BALB/c) share strong homology whereas a third clone (p199, C57BL/6) has diverged considerably from the others at the nucleic acid (85% homology) and protein (68% homology) levels. The 5' regions of p499 and p199 which show the most sequence divergence were subcloned and shown to hybridize to different liver MUP mRNAs. The p499-5' sequence was expressed in all MUP expressing tissues (liver, lachrymal, submaxillary and mammary) whereas the p199-5' sequence was expressed primarily in the liver and lachrymal. Analysis of liver RNA from mice in different endocrine states indicates that the p499-5' sequence is strongly regulated by thyroxine administration whereas the p199-5' sequence is not. Both sequences appear to be regulated by growth hormone and testosterone. Southern blot analysis of mouse genomic DNA indicates that there are multiple genes homologous to each sequence.
