The sequence of 200 nucleotides at the 3'-terminus of the genome RNA of vesicular stomatitis virus, Indiana serotype, was determined by adding a poly(A) tract to the 3'-terminus of genome RNA, then using the poly(A) as a binding site for a primer to initiate reverse transcription of the RNA, and analysing the complementary DNA sequence by the dideoxynucleoside triphosphate chain termination method. Proceeding 3' to 5', the genome RNA sequence consisted of a sequence complementary to the leader RNA, followed by the sequence AAA, followed by a sequence complementary to the 5'-extremity of N protein mRNA. These results are discussed in terms of leader RNA function, mechanism of transcript processing at the junction between leader RNA and N mRNA, and N mRNA structure.
