Leydig cells are the primary source of testosterone in male vertebrates. The biosynthesis of testosterone in Leydig cells is strictly dependent on luteinizing hormone (LH). On the other hand, it can be directly inhibited by excessive glucocorticoid (Corticosterone, CORT, in rats) which is beyond the protective capability of 11beta-Hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1 (11beta-HSD1) and type 2 (11beta-HSD2; encoded by gene Hsd11b2 in rats) in Leydig cells. Our previous study found that LH increases 11beta-HSD1 expression in rat Leydig cells, but the effect of LH on the expression and activity of 11beta-HSD2 is not investigated yet.

The Leydig cells were isolated from male Sprague-Dawley rats (90 days of age). After Leydig cells were incubated either for 24 h with various concentrations of LH (2.5, 5, 10 and 20 ng/mL) or for different time periods (2, 8, 12 and 24 h) with 20 ng/mL LH, the mRNA expression of 11beta-HSD2 was measured by real-time PCR. 11beta-HSD2 protein levels in Leydig cells were assayed by Western Blot and 11beta-HSD2 enzyme activity was determined by calculating the ratio of conversion of [3H]CORT to [3H]11-dehydrocorticosterone by 24 h after stimulation with 20 ng/ml LH. Four reporter gene plasmids containing various lengths of Hsd11b2 promoter region were constructed and transfected into mouse Leydig tumor cells to investigate the effect of LH on Hsd11b2 transcription. A glucocorticoid-responsive reporter gene plasmid, GRE-Luc, was constructed. To evaluate influence of LH on intracellular glucocorticoid level, rat Leydig cells were transfected with GRE-Luc, and luciferase activities were measured after incubation with CORT alone or CORT plus LH.

We observed dose- and temporal-dependent induction of rat 11beta-HSD2 mRNA expression in Leydig cells subject to LH stimulation. The protein and enzyme activity of 11beta-HSD2 and the luciferase activity of reporter gene driven by promoter regions of Hsd11b2 were increased by LH treatment. LH decreased the glucocorticoid-induced luciferase activity of GRE-Luc reporter gene.

In the male, the Leydig cell, in the interstitium of testis, is the primary source of sexual steroid hormone testosterone, which stimulates differentiation of the male phenotype and spermatogenesis in the testes. Leydig cells are mainly stimulated by luteinizing hormone (LH), the gonadotropic hormone secreted by pituitary gland. On the other hand, many studies had established that the high level of glucocorticoid, which could be caused pathologically by Cushing's syndrome or psychologically by stress, results in the decrease in testosterone secretion, whereby reduced libido and fertility are brought on [1,2]. Furthermore, our previous study found that the endogenous glucocorticoid (Corticosterone, CORT, in rats) at physiological level is also able to suppress the secretion of testosterone in rat Leydig cells [3]. In our another study, it was shown that administration of stress level of glucocorticoid induces apoptosis of Leydig cells in vivo [4]. It suggests that glucocorticoid could decrease testosterone production by Leydig cells through reducing the number of Leydig cells as well as inhibiting the expression of testosterone biosynthesis enzymes [5-8]. The adverse effect of glucocorticoid on testosterone biosynthesis is a direct glucocorticoid receptor (GR) mediated process [9]. The intracellular concentration of glucocorticoid, which determines the extent of GR activation, is regulated by 11beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (11beta-HSD) in Leydig cells [10]. To date, two isoforms of 11beta-HSD are identified. 11beta-HSD Type I (11beta-HSD1) is a NADP+/NADPH dependent oxidoreductase with low affinity (km = 2 muM) for glucocorticoid, reversibly converting biologically active glucocorticoid (corticosterone in rats) to inactive 11-keto steroid [11]. Its direction of enzyme activity is determined by redox potential in different cell types and differentiation stages [12]. In rat Leydig cells, 11beta-HSD1 is a predominant oxidase, playing a protective role in the inhibitory effect of glucocorticoid on steroid biosynthesis of Leydig cells [13].11beta-HSD Type II (11beta-HSD2; encoded by rat gene Hsd11b2) is a NAD+ dependent oxidase with high-affinity (Km = 15 nM), inactivating glucocorticoid to its inert metabolite (11-dehydrocorticosterone in rats) unidirectionally [14]. Both of two isoforms of 11beta-HSD are expressed in rat Leydig cells [15,16]. Although the expression of 11beta-HSD2 is 1000-fold lower relative to 11beta-HSD1 in rat Leydig cells, the former is still thought of as an important factor, at least equivalent to 11beta-HSD1, of modulating the intracellular level of glucocorticoid due to its high affinity for substrate [15]. In a word, the excessive glucocorticoid directly inhibits testosterone biosynthesis when it exceeds the capacity of oxidative inactivation by 11beta-HSD in Leydig cells. In light of the important role of 11beta-HSD in modulating glucocorticoid-mediated suppression of testosterone secretion, our previous study had been performed to investigate whether the expression and activity of 11beta-HSD1 is regulated by LH, the primary trophic and stimulating hormone for Leydig cells [17].

The results showed that although LH increases the expression of 11beta-HSD1 mRNA and protein compared with control cells, the net oxidative activity of 11beta-HSD1 was reduced. A study had shown that gonadotropic hormone which can be used as a functional homologue of LH in teleosts [18] could increase expression of 11beta-HSD2 in Tilapia testis [19], but whether LH could regulates its expression in mammalian Leydig cells and whereby affects the intracellular concentration of glucocorticoids is unknown. The present study is designed to investigate the effect of LH on expression of 11beta-HSD2 in rat Leydig cells.

Adult Leydig cells were isolated from 90-day-old rats according to the procedure of Sriraman et al. [20], which is a modification of the procedure described by Klinefelter et al. [21]. The decapsulated testis was subjected to collagenase digestion in a 50-mL plastic tube containing 10 mL medium with collagenase (600 units) and DNase (750 units). The tubes were placed in a shaking water bath with constant agitation (50 times/min) at 34degreesC for 15-20 min until the seminiferous tubules were separated. The enzyme action was terminated by adding excess medium. The tubules were allowed to settle by gravity and the medium, consisting of interstitial cells, was aspirated and filtered through a 100-mum nylon mesh. The filtrate was centrifuged at 250 x g for 10 min at 25degreesC, which yielded a crude interstitial pellet. The pellet obtained was suspended in 35 mL 55% isotonic Percoll with 750 units DNase in Oakridge tubes. The tubes were centrifuged at 20 000 x g for 1 h at 4degreesC. Percoll fractions corresponding to densities of 1.070-1.090 g/mL were collected and the cells present in this fraction were pelleted by centrifugation at 250 x g for 10 min at 25degreesC after diluting with 3-4 volumes of medium. The purities of isolated cell fractions were evaluated by histochemical staining for 3beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase activity, with 0.4 nmol/L etiocholanolone as the steroid substrate [22]. The mean purity of Leydig cells was 85%.

Real-time PCR was carried out according to Lee JJ and Widmaier EP with some modification [24]. In brief, each PCR reaction contains 1 x Absolute TM QPCR SYBR Green Mix (Abgene, Epsom, UK), 0.3 muM primers and 2 muL cDNA with a total volume of 25 muL. The primers for 11beta-HSD2 [GenBanK:] (Forward: 5'-TGGCCAACTTGCCTAGAGAG; Reverse: 5'-TTCAGGAATTGCCCATGC) and 18S [GenBank:] (Forward: 5'-CGCCGCTAGAGGTGAAATTC; Reverse: 5'-CCAGTCGGCATCGTTTATGG) are the same as described previously [24]. Initially, the reaction mix was incubated at 95degreesC for 15 min to activate Thermo-Start(R) DNA Polymerase (Abgene), then templates were amplified for 40 cycles (95degreesC for 15 s, 60degreesC for 1 min) on the Rotor-Gene 3000 system (Corbett Research, Sydney, NSW, Australia). Meanwhile, genomic DNA contamination was evaluated by real-time PCR of non-retrotranscribed RNA for each sample. Melting curve analysis was conducted immediately after completion of PCR as following: 95degreesC for 10 s, then 60degreesC for 10 s and continuous heating to 99degreesC at 0.5degreesC/s. The resulting PCR products were analyzed on a 2% agarose gel and cloned into pGEM-T Easy vector (Promega) followed by DNA sequencing to confirm the specificity of PCR. The relative quantitative analysis of 11beta-HSD2 mRNA expression was performed using the delta-delta Ct method with 18S RNA as an internal control [25].

Aliquots of cell extracts containing equal amounts of protein were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis on 12% gels using the Laemmli buffering system, then proteins were transferred to ImmunoBlot polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Bio-Rad, Hercules, California, USA) and blocked by rocking for 1 h at room temperature in blocking buffer (Tris-buffered saline with 0.1% Tween 20 and 5% nonfat dry milk). Afterwards, the membranes were incubated with a 1:1000 dilution of a rabbit polyclonal antibody for 11beta-HSD2 for 1 h, then repeatedly washed and incubated with a 1:10000 dilution of goat anti-rabbit antibody that was conjugated to horseradish peroxidase. Signals were detected with an Enhanced Chemilluminescence kit (Pierce Chemical). Beta-actin was used as internal control.

After rat Leydig cells were isolated and cultured for 24 h, cells were treated with 20 ng/mL LH for 24 h. Then, Leydig cell homogenates were prepared with the method described by Arcuri F et al [29]. In short, cell cultures were rinsed three times with 0.1 M phosphate buffer solution, harvested with a rubber scraper and pelleted by centrifugation at 1000 x g for 5 min at 4degreesC. Cell pellets were suspended in ice-cold sodium phosphate buffer 0.1 M (pH 7.5), 0.2% (v/v) of Triton X-100, and sonicated for 15 s on ice. Protein concentrations were determined by BCA protein assay reagent (Pierce Chemical). The 11beta-HSD2 enzyme activity assay was performed according to the protocol of Ge RS et al. with some modification [16]. Briefly, 0.5 mL reaction mixture was prepared in phenol red-free medium that contained 2 nM [3H]CORT and 23 nM unlabeled CORT, obtaining a final concentration of 25 nM of CORT. The reactions were initiated by the addition of 50 mug protein with NAD+ at a final concentration of 0.5 mM, then performed in a shaking water bath (100 strokes/min) at 34degreesC for 1 h, and finally stopped by adding 2 ml ice-cold ethyl acetate. Tubes were vortexed and centrifuged at 10,000 rpm for 5 min to separate the upper organic layer, which was dried under nitrogen. Samples were resuspended in 100 mul of methanol. The steroids were separated chromatographically on thin-layer plates in chloroform and methanol (90:10). Bands were visualized using I2 vapor and scraped into scintillation fluid, and the radioactivity was measured using a Beckman LS65000 liquid scintillation counter (Beckman Coulter, Fullerton, USA). The percentage conversion of corticosterone to 11-dehydrocorticosterone was calculated by dividing the radioactive counts identified as 11-dehydrocorticosterone by the total counts associated with corticosterone plus 11-dehydrocorticosterone.

To determine the effect of LH on transcription of 11beta-HSD2 gene, four luciferase reporter genes driven by different lengths of 11beta-HSD2 promoter fragment were transiently transfected into mLTC-1. Briefly, the cells were seeded into 24-well plates at a density of 5 x 105 cells/well and incubated at 37degreesC overnight. Cells were then placed in DMEM with 10% fetal bovine serum containing 1 mug of luciferase plasmid, 0.01 mug of pRL-TK (Promega) reporter plasmid, and 2 mug of Lipofectaminetrade mark 2000 reagent (Invitrogen) according to the supplier's protocol. Twelve hours following transfection, the cells were treated with 20 ng/ml LH for 24 h. Following the treatment, Dual Luciferase Assay was performed by lysing the cells in Passive Lysis Buffer (Promega) and reading the relative light units of one-fifth the lysate with both the firefly substrate and the renilla substrate using a luminometer (Berthold Lumat LB9507, Bad Wildbad, Germany). Each transfection was performed in triplicate and in three independent experiments.

Given that both isoforms of 11beta-HSD are expressed in rat Leydig cell and the inhibitory effect of LH on the net oxidative activity of 11beta-HSD1 [17], a glucocorticoid-responsive reporter gene, GRE-Luc, was employed to investigate the level of active intracellular glucocorticoid. The rationale is that the transcriptional activity of GRE-Luc which contains two copies of a consensus GRE upstream of the luciferase gene is subject to the extent of GR activation, i.e. intracellular glucocorticoid concentration set by the total oxidative activity of 11beta-HSD1 and 11beta-HSD2, thus the effect of LH on the transcriptional activity of GRE-Luc is indicative of the oxidative capacity of Leydig cells for glucocorticoid. Rat Leydig cells were isolated and cultured in 24 well culture plates (1 x 106/well) in fresh medium for 48 h. Then, 1.0 mug of GRE-Luc and 0.01 mug of pRL-TK (Promega) reporter plasmid were transiently transfected into the Leydig cells using Lipofectaminetrade mark 2000 reagent (Invitrogen). After another 48 h of culture, the cells were incubated in the presence or absence of LH (20 ng/mL) for 24 h. Subsequently, the cells pretreated with LH were treated with CORT (50 nM) plus LH (20 ng/mL) and the other cells not pretreated with LH were treated with CORT (50 nM) or LH (20 ng/mL) for 24 h. At the end of all treatments, Dual Luciferase Assays were performed as described above. The transfected cells treated with vehicles (PBS for LH; DMSO for CORT) served as controls.

To further investigate the effect of LH on the expression of 11beta-HSD2, the transcriptional activities of different lengths of rat gene Hsd11b2 promoter region were analyzed. LH treatment induced a two-fold increase in the activity of -1740/+45 construct. It was also shown that the -138/+45 region is crucial for the constitutive and LH-induced transactivation of 11beta-HSD2 (Fig. 3).

Leydig cells secrete the male sexual hormone testosterone, which is responsible for differentiation of the male phenotype and spermatogenesis in the testes. A direct glucocorticoid receptor (GR)-mediated inhibition of testosterone biosynthesis by excess glucocorticoid has been demonstrated [9]. Some of the solid evidences came from the studies on stress and Cushing's syndrome, in which elevated circulating concentration of glucocorticoid are normally associated with diminished testosterone secretion [1,2]. The recent studies had found that the intracellular level of glucocorticoid is under control by 11beta-HSD oxidase activity in Leydig cells [13,15]. Thus far, two distinct forms of 11beta-HSD have been identified: 11beta-HSD1, which usually is expressed in glucocorticoid target tissue, shows both oxidative and reductive activities and has a relatively low affinity for glucocorticoid substrates [13]; whereas, 11beta-HSD2, which usually is expressed in mineralocorticoid target tissue, is an exclusively oxidative isoform with a high affinity for glucocorticoids [14].

Firstly, the presence of 11beta-HSD1 in Leydig cell was identified in 1989 [30]. The results of most previous studies demonstrated that 11beta-HSD1 is primarily an oxidase and plays a gatekeeper role of oxidatively inactivating glucocorticoids. Lately, the expression of 11beta-HSD2 was also detected in rat adult Leydig cells using sensitive real-time PCR and new antibody [15,16]. It is supposed that 11beta-HSD2 functions as a protective factor in Leydig cells as well as 11beta-HSD1, catalyzing a net oxidative reaction, although its expression is 1000-fold lower than that of 11beta-HSD1. One reason is that 11beta-HSD2 has a lower Km (15 nM), which is within the range of physiological concentration of glucocorticoid, compared with 11beta-HSD1 (Km = 6 muM). Another is that suppression of 11beta-HSD2 expression with transfection of antisense oligonucleotides decreased the oxidase activity of Leydig cell by almost 50%.

We had investigated the effect of LH on the expression of 11beta-HSD1 at the time when 11beta-HSD2 was not identified in Leydig cells [17]. It had been reported that gonadotropic hormone could increase11beta-HSD2 expression in Tilapia testis [19], but the relevant mammalian study is not present yet. The results of this present study showed that LH treatment induced expression of 11beta-HSD2 mRNA and protein in rat Leydig cells. These results were further confirmed by determining the effect of LH on the transcriptional activity of rat gene Hsd11b2 promoter. The luciferase reporter gene assays revealed that 11beta-HSD2 promoter-driven transcription increased by more than 100% with LH treatment, consistent with the expression of mRNA and protein. We also found that the -138/+45 fragment, which contains a GC-rich region, is crucial for basic transcriptional activity similar to the results of other studies on human HSD11B2 gene [31]. Along with serial deletions of the region between -1740 and -138, the transcriptional activity gradually decreased. This result suggests that several transcription factors may be involved in the LH-regulated expression of 11beta-HSD2. This hypothesis needs further investigation in the future.

Actually, some in vivo studies had also suggested there is a correlation between the expression of 11beta-HSD2 and serum concentration of LH. The study from Ge RS et al. indicated that 11beta-HSD2 mRNA and enzyme activity increase continuously and significantly during postnatal development of rat Leydig cells which is accompanied by a gradual increase in serum LH concentration from puberty to maturity [16,32]. Wagner A and Claus R found that changes in expression of 11beta-HSD2 appear to parallel with changes in serum concentration of LH in pig Leydig cells after birth [33]. Furthermore, It was shown that GnRH-immunization significantly depresses the plasma concentration of LH as well as 11beta-HSD oxidative activity in the boar testis [34]. The data mentioned above and the results of the present study suggest that LH may play an important role in developmental expression of 11beta-HSD2 and thereby affecting the intracellular glucocorticoid concentration.

Our previous study revealed that although LH increased the expression of 11beta-HSD1 in cultured Leydig cells, the reducase activity of 11beta-HSD1 increased slightly and the oxidase activity declined unexpectedly. It has been established that Hexose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, which generates NADPH through catalyzing glucose-6-phosphate oxidation, is the determinant of the reaction direction of 11beta-HSD1 [12]. Moreover, glucose availability may also be involved in determining the reaction direction of 11beta-HSD1. Hardy et al. observed that the oxidative and reductive components of 11beta-HSD1 activity are unstable in vitro. Preparations of freshly isolated Leydig cells display high levels of oxidase activity and lower reductase, but the former declines and the latter rises during incubation in vitro. Eliminating the energy sources glucose and pyruvate from the culture medium prevented the changes in oxidoreductase activities, and the 11beta-HSD1 oxidase remained predominant in Leydig cells [35]. Similar phenomenon was observed in rat H4IIE hepatoma cells transfected with mouse 11beta-HSD1 [36]. Transmembrane glucose uptake mediated by a family of glucose transporters (GLUTs) controls the rate of intracellular glucose availability and metabolism [37]. GLUT8 is highly expressed in rat Leydig cells and positively regulated by hCG which shares the same receptor with LH in Leydig cells [38]. Thus, we supposed that LH-induced increase in glucose availability may be involved in the mechanism for LH-induced change in the enzyme activity of 11beta-HSD1. Given that LH reduces the oxidase activity of 11beta-HSD1 [17] and increases the expression and enzyme activity of 11beta-HSD2 simultaneously, it is unknown what happens to capacity for oxidative inactivation in Leydig cells. To probe the effect of LH on the level of intracellular glucocorticoid receptor activation, the luciferase reporter gene bioassay system was utilized, which had been employed in many studies for the same sake [27,28]. The inducible transcriptional activity of GRE-Luc lies on the extent of the binding of active GR and GRE in the artificial promoter of luciferase gene. As shown in Fig. 4, physiological level of CORT (50 nM) could activate GR signaling pathway, which is consistent with our earlier data that endogenous CORT is capable of inhibiting the steroidogenic capacity of purified rat Leydig cells in vitro [3,39], and LH abated the glucocorticoid-induced luciferase activity, i.e. the intracellular concentration of glucocorticoid despite the predominant 11beta-HSD1 activity may shift from oxidase to reducase activity hypothetically due to the elevated glucose uptake and NADPH/NADP ratio resulting from treatment with LH [12,38]. Although glucocorticoid exerts adverse effect on testosterone secretion in Leydig cells, some studies suggest that it may be an important factor for Leydig cell development. For example, GR is expressed in Leydig cells at all three stages of pubertal development (mesenchymal-like progenitors, PLC, on day 21, immature Leydig cells, ILC, on day 35, and adult Leydig cells, ALC, on day 90.) and the numbers of dexamethasone-binding sites are higher in ILC and ALC compared with PLC [13]. In controlling the inhibitive effect of glucocorticoid on testosterone secretion during Leydig cell development, LH-induced expression of 11beta-HSD2 could play a key role. Interestingly, it was found that glucocorticoid increases the ability of Leydig cell precursors to respond to LH [40]. Therefore, Leydig cells may control intracellular glucocorticoid concentration through a LH-mediated negative feedback mechanism during development.

In summary, LH increases the expression and enzyme activity of 11beta-HSD2, and therefore enhances capacity for oxidative inactivation of glucocorticoid in rat Leydig cells in vitro. Thus, this study together with other published data has revealed an integrated relationship between LH and glucocorticoid in Leydig cells, which may help us deepen our understanding of the intricate mechanism for regulation of testosterone secretion in Leydig cells.
