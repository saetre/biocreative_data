The complete nucleotide sequences of the Haemophilus influenzae and Mycoplasma genitalium genomes and the partially sequenced Escherichia coli chromosome were analyzed to identify open reading frames (ORFs) likely to encode RNA modifying enzymes. The protein sequences of known RNA modifying enzymes from three families--m5U methyltransferases, psi synthases and 2'-O methyltransferases--were used as probes to search sequence databases for homologs. ORFs identified as homologous to the initial probes were retrieved and used as new probes against the databases in an iterative manner until no more homologous ORFs could be identified. Using this approach, we have identified two new m5U methyltransferases, seven new psi synthases and four new 2'-O methyltransferases in E. coli. Many of the ORFs found in E.coli have direct genetic counterparts (orthologs) in one or both of H.influenzae and M.genitalium. Since there is a near-complete knowledge of RNA modifications in E.coli, functional activities of the proteins encoded by the identified ORFs were proposed based on the level of conservation of the ORFs and the modified nucleotides.
