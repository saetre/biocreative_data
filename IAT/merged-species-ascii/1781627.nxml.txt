The aim of our study was to analyse a significance of tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha promoter gene polymorphisms in relation to the HLA-DR locus in genetic predisposition to pemphigus. TNF-alpha gene polymorphisms in position -238 and -308 were identified using a modified polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism method in 53 patients with pemphigus (38 with pemphigus vulgaris, 15 with pemphigus foliaceus) and 87 healthy controls. The HLA-DRB1 locus was typed using the polymerase chain reaction SSO method in all the patients and 152 population controls. Carriers of the TNF-alpha polymorphic -308 A allele were found to be more frequent in the pemphigus foliaceus group in comparison with the control group (odds ratio (OR) = 8.12; p = 0.0005). A significant association between HLA-DRB1*04 (OR = 3.86; pcor = 0.0001) and DRB1*14 (OR = 8.4; pcor = 0.0001) and pemphigus vulgaris was found. In this group of patients a decreased frequency of HLA-DRB1*07 (OR = 0.08; pcor = 0.006) was also identified. We have shown for the first time a positive association of TNF-alpha polymorphism in position -308 with pemphigus foliaceus.
