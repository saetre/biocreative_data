Starting with mRNA derived from Staphylococcal enterotoxin A induced human splenocytes, dsDNA was synthesized and inserted into unique BamHI site of the eukaryotic expression vector pSV529 (1). A recombinant plasmid containing human immune interferon (IFN-gamma) cDNA was identified by hybridization of plasmid inserted DNA bound onto nitrocellulose filters with mRNA derived from SEA-induced splenocytes, translation of the eluted RNA in Xenopus laevis oocytes and assaying for IFN activity. Plasmids containing the entire human IFN-gamma cDNA sequence were identified by colony hybridization and were sequenced. A unique coding region was identified which predicted a protein of 166 amino acids, the 20 N-terminal amino acids of which presumably represent a signal peptide. After transfection of monkey cells with plasmid DNA isolated from one of the recombinant clones (pHIIF-SV-gamma 1), IFN was excreted into the culture medium. This IFN was not distinguishable from human IFN-gamma by serological criteria or by cell target species specificity.
