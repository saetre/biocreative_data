A DNA sequence complementary to the entire coding part of a mouse gamma 2a immunoglobulin heavy chain mRNA isolated from a myeloma producing a levan binding protein (UPC 10), has been cloned in the PstI site of pBR 322. Transformants containing sequences complementary to purified gamma 2a heavy chain mRNA were selected. One transformant, pG2a-10-21, containing a 1750 nucleotide insert, has been characterized by hybrid-arrested translation and purification of gamma 2a heavy chain mRNA on DNA-DBM cellulose filters. Restriction enzyme analysis and partial sequencing demonstrate that the pG2a-10-21 contains the complete structural sequence for the gamma 2a heavy chain and predicts the sequence of a 18 amino acid hydrophobic amino terminal extra piece segment.
