Introduction: Early identification of chemoresistance in patients with ovarian cancer is of utmost importance in order to provide them with the most appropriate therapy. Recently, we described the expression of MyD88 in ovarian cancer cells that were resistant to the cytotoxic agent paclitaxel. In addition to chemoresistance, in MyD88 positive ovarian cancer cells, paclitaxel stimulates growth and production of proinflammatory cytokines. The objective of this study was to determine the correlation of MyD88 expression in primary and recurrent epithelial ovarian cancers with the response to carboplatin and paclitaxel combination chemotherapy. Methods: Tumors are heterogeneous structures that contain different cell populations, thus rendering the identification of specific tumor markers difficult. Using laser capture microdissection, pure cancer cells were isolated from ovarian malignant tumors that were obtained from 20 patients at the time of surgery. The microdissected cells were evaluated for the expression of MyD88, FasL, and XIAP by western blot analysis. Results: Protein expression was observed in samples containing as low as 500 cells. The results were correlated with the clinical course of those patients. It was evident that MyD88 expression in ovarian cancer cells accurately predicts a poor response to paclitaxel chemotherapy as shown by a short progression-free interval and overall survival. Conclusion: We describe for the first time a molecular approach to identify paclitaxel chemoresistance. Toxicity from agents without therapeutic benefit can be avoided by identifying those patients who will not respond to a specific agent. Molecular markers will enable us to design individualized treatments and improve overall survival.

Ovarian cancer is the fourth leading cause of cancer-related deaths in women in the United States and the leading cause of gynecologic cancer deaths. The standard first-line chemotherapy for patients with ovarian cancer is a platinum-taxane combination regimen. In excess of 80 percent of patients will respond initially to this treatment. However, less than 10 percent will remain in remission [1].

Recently, we described a sub-group of epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) cells that express the protein Myeloid Differentiation Protein 88 (MyD88). MyD88 is an adaptor protein that is required for Toll-like receptor (TLR) signaling, a signaling pathway involved in inflammatory response to bacterial and viral products [2]. EOC cells that express MyD88 constitutively secrete pro-inflammatory cytokines and are resistant to the taxane paclitaxel, which is a known TLR-4 ligand. Upon TLR-4 ligation with either LPS or paclitaxel, these cells secrete higher levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines and, more importantly, proliferate in culture [2]. We hypothesized that MyD88 is a specific marker for paclitaxel resistance and is required for paclitaxel-induced cell growth in EOC cells. The objective of this study was to develop an optimized method that can detect MyD88 expression in ovarian cancer tumors and thus function as a biomarker for selection of therapy.

Proteomics has emerged as an important tool to study biological processes in both physiological and pathological circumstances. Identification of specific proteins as biomarkers for a disease or condition may be used for diagnosis and/or therapy. Currently, however, no optimized method exists that can sensitively detect ovarian cancer biomarkers from tumor tissue prior to initiation of therapy. A limiting factor in the discovery and analysis of potential marker from tumor samples are the "contaminating" signals originating from normal cells, including immune cells, that are infiltrating the tumor. In order to overcome this difficulty, several investigators have developed mechanical and/or chemical approaches to separate the cellular components of the tumor. However, the purity of these preparations has never reached the desired levels required for diagnostic.

The use of laser capture microdissection (LCM) has been proposed as an alternative method to obtain pure cell populations. This approach has been used successfully to identify RNA expression and DNA in stored samples [3,4]. However, determination of RNA in cells obtained by LCM is time consuming and requires special measures to prevent RNA degradation. In the present study, we describe a novel approach for the detection of protein expression in as low as 1,000 pure epithelial ovarian cancer cells dissected by LCM. Furthermore, we demonstrate that MyD88 expression in LCM-dissected ovarian cancer cells can be used as a marker for paclitaxel resistance.

In preparation for Laser capture microdissection, a 5x5 mm tissue sample was embedded in OCT at -20degreesC. Eight-micron sections were cut with the microtome and collected on Leica glass-foiled PEN-membrane slides. The slides were fixed in 95 percent ethanol for five minutes and stained with H&E for 30 seconds at RT, followed by washing in ddHâ‚‚O for 30 seconds. Dehydration is required for successful Laser microdissection, and this was accomplished by immersing the slides in 95 percent ethanol and then in Histosolve, a xylene substitute (Shandon, Inc., Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania), 15 minutes each. The slides were air dried at RT for 15 minutes. Following dehydration, to prevent protein degradation, the samples were either used immediately for microdissection or they were stored in air-tight plastic wrapping at -20degreesC.

Eight-micron sections were cut with the microtome, collected on Leica glass-foiled PEN-membrane slides and fixed in 95 percent ethanol for five minutes as described above. The slides were then placed in a staining dish with 0.1 percent Hâ‚‚Oâ‚‚ in 0.1M PB for 10 minutes to quench for endogenous peroxidase activity and then washed in wash buffer three times. Wash buffer was prepared by adding 0.01 percent Triton X-100 (Sigma Aldrich, St. Louis, Missouri) to 0.1M PB. The area around the tissue sections was scored with a Pap pen to limit the amount of antibodies and reagents used. All steps occurred at room temperature with the slides placed in a moisture chamber to keep the tissue from drying out during the procedure. To block for non-specific background, 100-200 microl of 3 percent BSA made in wash buffer were added to the circumscribed areas and incubated for 20 minutes in the moisture chamber. Next, the primary antibody was incubated for two hours followed by washing with wash buffer (each wash is two to three minutes times three), the specimens were incubated with Biotin labeled secondary antibody for 30 minutes. After this incubation, the slides were washed once with wash buffer then twice with 0.1M Tris (pH 7.5). The tissue was incubated with Streptavidin-HRP conjugate for 30 minutes and then washed with 0.1 M Tris three times. The color was developed with DAB (2.5 mg DAB in 5 ml 0.1 M Tris). Twenty five microl of 0.03 percent Hâ‚‚Oâ‚‚ were added to the chromogen just before use. At the end of the procedure, the slides were washed with double distilled water and counterstained with Mayer's hematoxylin (Sigma Aldrich, St. Louis, Missouri). The specimens were dehydrated and then stored as described above.

The slides were placed inverted into the holder of a Leica AS LMD Laser Microdissection System with the side containing the tissue facing down (non-contact method). Tumor cells were selected according to their morphology for H&E stained samples or according to their immunoreactivity for CK-7 stained samples. Dissected cells were collected in the cup of 0.5ml Eppendorf tubes containing 35 microl sample buffer (2.5 percent SDS, 10 percent glycerol, 5 percent beta-mercapto-ethanol, 0.15M Tris (pH = 6.8) and 0.01 percent bromophenol blue). After a short centrifugation, lysis of the cells was achieved by submitting the samples to five cycles of freezing (liquid Nâ‚‚) and thawing (95degreesC) followed by boiling for five minutes, centrifuged again for two minutes and then stored at -80degreesC until further use.

All procedures were carried out in a timely manner to minimize the activity of proteases. For H&E stained tissues, the interval from tissue frozen section cutting to cell dissection and lysis was under one hour while immunostained (CK-7 or CD45) stained specimens required approximately four hours.

Proteins were resolved under reducing conditions on 12 percent SDS-PAGE gels and then transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride paper (NEN Life Sciences, Boston, Massachusetts) [5]. Membranes were blocked at room temperature for one hour with 5 percent FFPM in PBS/0.05 percent Tween 20 (PBS-T). After three washes for 10 minutes, each with PBS-T, membranes were incubated overnight at 4degreesC with the primary antibody in PBS-T/1 percent FFPM. After incubation with the primary antibody, membranes were washed three times with PBS-T and then incubated at room temperature with the appropriate secondary antibody conjugated to peroxidase (Vector Laboratories) in PBS-T/1 percent FFPM. After three washes for 10 minutes each with PBS-T and three washes for 10 minutes each with distilled water, the peroxidase-conjugated antibody was detected by enhanced chemoluminiscence (PerkinElmer Life Sciences, Boston, Massachusetts). The signal intensity was analyzed using a Kodak digital imaging analysis system (Kodak Image Station 4000MM) and Kodak Molecular Imaging Software (Scientific Imaging Kodak Company).

Our first objective was to determine whether we could detect protein expression by Western blot analysis in microdissected cells obtained from ovarian tumor samples that were snap-frozen in liquid N2. Thus, we microdissected increasing number of cells with a maximum of 8,000 cells and a minimum of 100 cells from 8 microm ovarian cancer sections and then analyzed them for the expression of MyD88 and other cancer-related proteins such as XIAP [6-8] and FasL [9,10] [Figure 1]. As shown in Figure 2, a strong signal for MyD88 expression was observed in samples containing 8,000 and 5,000 microdissected cells, and no signal was detected for samples containing less than 1,000 cells.

In order to determine whether the sensitivity of the assay remains similar for different proteins, we evaluated the expression of XIAP and FasL using the same number of cells. Contrary to MyD88, XIAP and FasL expression is detected in samples containing as little as 1000 and 100 cells, respectively [Figure 2].

We then evaluated whether the sample thickness affects the signal detected by Western blot. Although increasing the section thickness did increase the amount of protein, it affected cutting time and rendered dissection extremely difficult. Therefore, we standardized the method to eight microm sections. This allows a quick dissection and provides enough protein to be detected by Western blot (data not shown).

Tumors are heterogeneous tissues containing normal supporting cells, immune cells and cancer cells. Immune cells infiltrate the stroma and may "contaminate" the protein profile of the tumor sample [Figure 3]. Indeed, when we analyzed MyD88 expression in H&E stained samples without using appropriate markers for cell type identification, we found that MyD88 was expressed in all samples. The explanation for these results is that the immune cells present in the tumor tissue and surrounding the cancer cells express MyD88 [Figure 3A]. In an H&E stained sample, the selection of specific cells based on their morphology alone is not sufficient to identify intra-tumoral infiltrated cells. An advantage of the LCM is that it affords the possibility of selecting a specific group of cells based on the expression of cellular markers. Therefore, our next objective was to determine whether immunohistochemistry staining affects the detection of proteins in microdissected samples. Thus, we compared the sensitivity of protein detection of cells obtained from H&E stained samples with cells obtained from immuno-stained samples. Tumor tissues were immuno-stained with either antibodies for cytokeratin 7 (epithelial marker) or CD45 (pan-leucocyte marker). Specific staining for cytokeratin 7 and CD45 was observed in these frozen sections [Figure 3A and data not shown]. When we compared MyD88 and XIAP expression in cells obtained from these two preparations, no difference was observed in the signal intensity for these proteins between the two groups, suggesting that the process of IHC does not affect the samples' integrity [Figure 3B]. Once we established that IHC does not affect protein detection, we evaluated MyD88 expression in ovarian cancer samples after staining for CD45 (panleukocyte antigen). As shown in Figure 4, when we dissected only the cancer cells (CD45 negative cells) and avoided the immune cells (CD45 positive cells), MyD88 was differentially expressed in tumors from different patients with identical pathological diagnoses.

A statistical significant correlation between assay prediction of response and progression-free interval (PFI) was observed in all these cases [Figure 7]. Furthermore, as shown by the Kaplan-Meier curve in Figure 8, the patients that had MyD88 negative tumors responded better to treatment and had a significantly longer survival when compared with the patients that had MyD88 positive tumors [Figure 8]

This study challenges the current approach of prescribing chemotherapy by relying solely on the pathological diagnosis. Instead, we propose that determination of molecular markers be undertaken and incorporated into the diagnostic process prior to treating patients with neoplastic diseases of the ovary. We show that the status of MyD88 expression may have a significant impact in chemo-responsiveness and therefore may be an indispensable piece of information to obtain prior to commencing treatment.

Although the link between inflammation, NF-kappaB, and cancer progression has been well characterized, the specific signaling pathway upstream of NF-kappaB is currently not well elucidated. As mentioned above, MyD88 is one of the proteins required in TLR4-mediated early phase NF-kappaB activation [11]. Our previous studies [2] showed that Type I epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) cells constitutively secrete IL-6, IL-8, GROalpha, and MCP-1. In response to LPS stimulation of TLR4, these cells proliferated and showed marked increase in the secretion of these cytokines via the activation of NF-kappaB. In contrast, type II EOC cells do not constitutively secrete cytokines, and no changes in cell proliferation or cytokine production were observed following treatment with LPS. The characteristic pro-inflammatory environment generated by Type I EOC cells was lost upon the knockdown of MyD88, suggesting that an active MyD88-dependent TLR4 signaling is responsible for the LPS-induced, NF-kappaB-mediated EOC cell proliferation and cytokine secretion.

As mentioned above, paclitaxel, a first-line chemotherapeutic agent used in the treatment of ovarian cancer [12-14], is a known TLR4 ligand [2,15,16]. Thus, we also determined if paclitaxel treatment would induce the same response in type I EOC cells as was seen with LPS. Our results showed that similar to LPS, paclitaxel also induced NF-kappaB activation, increased secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines, and proliferation of type I EOC cells. In contrast, no cytokine secretion was observed in type II EOC cells, and more importantly, they underwent apoptosis in response to paclitaxel. These results suggest that an activated MyD88-dependent TLR4 signaling pathway to NF-kappaB confers EOC cells the ability to promote a pro-inflammatory environment and the development of paclitaxel resistance. It is noticeable of the specificity of the signaling pathway to paclitaxel, since treatment of type I EOC cells with carboplatin, a chemotherapeutic drug which is not a TLR4 ligand, did induce neither proliferation nor cytokine production [17]. The mechanism that regulates MyD88 expression in these two types of cells, and the correlation of MyD88 expression and clinical response to paclitaxel in patients with EOC, however, still remains to be determined.

Moreover, endogenous ligands of TLR4 such as HMGB1, heparan sulfate and polysaccharide fragments of hyaluronan, which are released from the damaged tissue and necrotic cells, may also contribute to cancer progression and paclitaxel resistance [18-20].

Tumors contain different cell populations that are incorporated in a heterogeneous structure. These different cell types can be studied after meticulous isolation. LCM represents an alternative approach to obtaining pure cancer cells from fresh-frozen cancer tissue, thus providing an accurate snapshot of the tumor and its microenvironment in vivo. After lysis, these cells can be analyzed and their protein expression characterized by Western blot, ELISA, and Luminex assays.

Early identification of chemoresistance in patients with ovarian cancer has important treatment implications. It allows tailoring of therapy to individual patients and prevents the use of cytotoxic drugs with no therapeutic benefit while avoiding toxicities. Unfortunately, no available method exists to predict the chemoresponse of cancer cells prior to initiation of therapy.

The standard treatment for ovarian cancer is the combination of carboplatin and paclitaxel. Unfortunately, approximately 15 percent of newly diagnosed patients will not respond to this combination, and their disease will progress during or shortly after completion of chemotherapy. This percentage of non-responders increases to 65 to 75 percent for recurrent cancers.

Based on these studies, we hypothesized that MyD88 expression can be used as a marker for paclitaxel-resistance. However, we found that a limiting factor in the detection of MyD88 in whole tumors was the presence of intra-tumoral immune infiltrate. Immune cells, mainly macrophages, express high levels of MyD88 and may give a false positive result.
###end p 48
###begin p 49
Utilizing LCM and immunostaining protocols that allow clear identification of the desired cell types can overcome this obstacle. In our experiments, CD45 staining proved to be highly useful for the identification and selection of pure cancer cells from tumor tissue and classification of tumors as either MyD88 positive or negative.

We found that proteins expressed in high-levels, such as FasL or XIAP, can be detected with as low as 1,000 cells. However, for proteins with lower expression levels, like MyD88, a minimum of 5,000 cells was required for detection.

The advent of the LCM, used in conjunction with protein or gene detection techniques, has enabled us to gain a better perception of the complex interactions that occur within and among cells in living tissues. In this study, we have found that fresh-frozen tissue is a suitable material for this procedure. We have demonstrated in this report how proteins involved in the apoptotic cascade and chemoresistance of epithelial ovarian cancer cells can be accurately detected using a three-step approach. First, tumor specimens are snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen and eight microm thick specimens are stained to facilitate the selection of pure tumor cells. Second, target cells are identified based on their immunostaining and collected with the LCM system. The third step involves lysis of the collected cells followed by Western blot or Luminex multiplex assay.

The protocol presented here provides a fast and easy method for analyzing protein expression in tissues after LCM. We have used this method to evaluate the correlation between MyD88 expression and clinical outcome, and we have found that all patients who had MyD88 positive tumors presented with poor progression-free interval and overall survival after chemotherapy with carboplatin and paclitaxel, while the patients with MyD88 negative tumors had an excellent response to chemotherapy. A prospective clinical study to validate the specificity and sensitivity of this test aimed at identifying paclitaxel-resistant patients is under way. We have recently developed an immunohistochemistry protocol for MyD88 that is faster, less labor intensive, and can be applied to paraffin sections [Figure 8].

In summary, we describe a sensitive method to determine MyD88 as a potential marker for chemoresponse to paclitaxel. We have identified a specific subclass of cancer patients who, based on their MyD88 expression, are paclitaxel resistant. The use of molecular markers like MyD88 will enable us to design an individualized of treatment, thereby eliminating toxicity from agents without therapeutic benefit or even potential harm, as evidenced by the stimulating effect of paclitaxel on MyD88 positive EOC.
