In our previous study, we have found that thrombospondin-1 (TSP-1) is synthesized de novo upon monocyte and neutrophil apoptosis, leading to a phagocytic and tolerizing phenotype of dendritic cells (DC), even prior to DC-apoptotic cell interaction. Interestingly, we were able to show that heparin binding domain (HBD), the N-terminal portion of TSP-1, was cleaved and secreted simultaneously in a caspase- and serine protease- dependent manner. In the current study we were interested to examine the role of HBD in the clearance of apoptotic cells, and whether the phagocytic and tolerizing state of DCs is mediated by the HBD itself, or whether the entire TSP-1 is needed. Therefore, we have cloned the human HBD, and compared its interactions with DC to those with TSP-1. Here we show that rHBD by itself is not directly responsible for immune paralysis and tolerizing phenotype of DCs, at least in the monomeric form, but has a significant role in rendering DCs phagocytic. Binding of TSP-1-C-terminal domain on the other hand induces a tolerizing phenotype in dendritic cells.

Mammalian thrombospondins are a group of matricellular proteins of complex spatial structure, which mediate a wide range of intercellular activities, and participate in cell-matrix interactions. This family includes five proteins, divided into two subfamilies, which possess different roles and tissue expression [1]. Group A, consisting of thrombospondins TSP-1 and TSP-2 in humans, also exists in invertebrates, and appeared prior to the development of the clotting and fibrinolytic systems of proteins, indicating their essentiality [2], [3].

TSP-1, the prototype thrombospondin, is a calcium-binding protein that plays an important role in the cellular response to various growth factors, cytokines, and inflammatory mediators [4], [5]. It controls proliferation, migration, and apoptosis in a variety of conditions, such as wound healing, inflammation, and neoplasia [2], through a large number of domains interacting with distinct receptors. However, there is a degree of overlap in its effects, which are mediated through different domains. Therefore, different or even opposing influences of the same protein may occur under certain circumstances, depending on the set of receptors expressed by the target cell [6].

HBD, at 1.0 microg/ml, further enhanced iDC engulfment capacity with median fluorescence 410. The effect of TSP-1, 2.0 microg/ml, is indicated for comparison, with median fluorescence 537. Results are representative of three experiments. See also Figure 2C. C.

Isolated HBD enhances latex bead engulfment by iDCs. Green fluorescent latex beads were offered to iDCs at a 16:1 ratio, in the presence or absence of 0-1 microg/ml isolated HBD or 2 microg/ml TSP-1. Median fluorescence was enhanced from 55.67 (average of two measurements) with no added HBD, to 81.33 in the presence of 0.4 microg/ml HBD, and 90.14 in the presence of 1 microg/ml HBD, indicating augmentation in phagocytic capacity of 46.08% and 61.9% respectively, following HBD exposure (p<0.001). This is compared with 98.38% augmentation of phagocytosis in the presence of 2 microg/ml TSP-1. Data is representative of three experiments.

As we used TSP-1 concentrations similar to levels that were found secreted upon monocyte apoptosis [7], we used equimolar concentrations of rHBD in order to compare the effects of the rHBD to those of TSP-1. As shown in Figure 2B and C, this resulted in a dose-dependent increase in iDC engulfment of DiI-stained apoptotic cells. As shown in Figure 2C, mean iDC apoptotic cell acquisition was elevated in 51 and 84 percent when 0.4 and 1 microg\ml of HBD was added, respectively (three experiments, p<0001). Mean apoptotic cell acquisition upon addition of 4 microg\ml rHBD, (138 percent increase) was close to the effect of TSP-1 (162 percent increase). iDC engulfment of apoptotic monocytes was confirmed by fluorescent microscopy (Figure 2D).

To verify whether HBD of different origins would have a similar effect, we used rHBD from an alternative source (rHBD2, kindly provided by Jack Lawler, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA). Comparison of the rHBDs suggested that both had a significant effect, although rHBD that we generated (rHBD1) was slightly more effective (Fig. 2C).

Finally, we wanted to see whether this pro-phagocytic effect is expressed when other, nonspecific particles are offered, and we offered green fluorescent beads to iDCs. As shown in Figure 2E, green fluorescent bead uptake was augmented when iDCs were exposed to rHBD.

HBD possesses several identified receptors. In complexes with calreticulin (CRT), CD91 was shown to be involved in apoptotic cells clearance [10], [11]. CD29 (beta1 integrin) is known as an HBD receptor that mediates neurite growth and adhesion of cells in association with integrins alpha3, alpha4, or alpha5 (reviewed by Chen, et al. [12]). This receptor has not been clearly shown to be involved in apoptotic cell engulfment.

We conducted inhibition assays with antibodies specifically directed against each of these three receptors to examine whether they may mediate the HBD-dependent enhanced engulfment capacity of DCs. Surprisingly, both monoclonal specific antibodies resulted in a blockage of HBD influence, similar to that of the N-20, an antibody directed against HBD (Fig. 3).

Immature DCs were pre-incubated with antibodies against CD29 or CD91, and were then offered apoptotic monocytes in the presence of 0.4 microg/ml recombinant HBD. HBD was also added to dendritic cells in the presence of an antibody raised against the HBD (N20). Striking (>/=90%) inhibition of HBD-dependent apoptotic monocyte uptake is seen upon blocking HBD binding to either CD29 or CD91, compared with almost complete blocking of the HBD effect with the addition of N20. The effect of each blocking antibody on rHBD-dependent engulfment is measured relative to the difference in engulfment between additions of isotype control with 2 microg/ml HBD to that without HBD. Data is a mean+/-SE of three experiments.

To test the hypothesis that the isolated HBD could inhibit iDC maturation as has been shown for TSP-1 [7], we incubated iDCs with either 0.4 microg/ml rHBD, an equimolar concentration to that of the TSP-1 secreted by apoptotic monocytes at 10 hours of apoptosis, or with 2.0 microg/ml TSP-1, and examined the changes in the iDC morphology and maturation profile using flow cytometry.

Surprisingly, the expression of maturation-related molecules MHC class II and CD86 was not inhibited by pre-incubation with isolated rHBD, compared to the effect of TSP-1 (Fig. 4), for a wide range of rHBD concentrations (Fig. 4B). In support of this finding, we further found that pre-incubation with rHBD did not influence the forward- and side-scatter features of DCs, whether exposed or not exposed to LPS. Addition of the whole TSP-1 resulted in a decrease in cell size along with increased granularity (data not shown).

Data is representative of three experiments. B. Compared to treatment with 10 ng/ml LPS, pre-incubation with different concentrations of HBD (0.4 or 1.0 microg/ml) before exposure to LPS did not have significant influence on expression of either DR (upper chart) or CD86 (lower chart). TSP-1, on the other hand, resulted in a decreased expression of both molecules, similar to that of untreated iDCs. Results are expressed as a percent of the expression of each molecule at the 10 ng/ml LPS treatment, and represent mean+/-SE of three experiments. Statistically significant difference is marked (*).

Thrombospondin-1 controls proliferation, migration, and apoptosis in a variety of conditions, including wound healing and inflammation. The most important receptors identified to date for the varying effects moderated by TSP-1 are CD91, syndecan-1, and alpha3beta1 (alpha3beta1) integrin for HBD; CD47 for the C terminal domain, CD36 HSPG and beta1 (beta1) integrins for type I repeats; and alpha v beta 3 (alphavbeta3) for type III repeats. Different proteins in vertebrates and invertebrates include domains with similar structure and function to those of HBD, as reviewed in Adams and Lawler [2].

We showed earlier that TSP-1 induced a phagocytic and tolerizing state for iDCs [7]. In this study we were interested to examine the specific role that the isolated rHBD may play in this interaction. Our interest is due not only to the importance of understanding TSP-1 functions, but also because HBD is discretely secreted from apoptotic monocytes [7] and platelets [13]. For this purpose we have cloned and expressed recombinant monomeric HBD (rHBD) using human throbospondin-1 N-terminal domain c-DNA.

HBD, as part of TSP-1, was suggested to bind multiple receptors, including syndecan-1, syndecan-4, perlecan, Decorin, CD91 and its complex with calreticulin, VLDL-receptor, and integrins alpha6beta1, alpha4beta1, andalpha 3beta1, as reviewd by Elzie et al. [13]. Here we were able to show that rHBD by itself can make iDCs better phagocytes of apoptotic cells. What could be the underlying mechanism? According to the model suggested by Savill and colleagues [14], TSP-1 may serve as a bridging molecule in the engulfment of apoptotic cells. We have shown that TSP-1 alone, without the presence of apoptotic cells, makes iDCs more phagocytic [7], Thus, it is likely that this HBD effect is achieved via signaling events following its binding. Using monoclonal antibodies, we were able to show that this effect was abrogated by inhibiting the action of CD29 and CD91, which are most likely involved in the signaling cascade. CD29, an integrin family member, is a membrane receptor involved in cell adhesion and recognition for a variety of processes, including embryogenesis, hemostasis, tissue repair, and immune response. CD29 was not previously known to be involved in phagocytosis. Here we show for the first time that CD29 may be required for HBD-dependent engulfment activity.

Interestingly, and in contrast to the effect of HBD as part of TSP-1, no inhibition of DC maturation by the rHBD was documented in our system. In other words, whereas isolated HBD mediates the phagocytic state it does not mediate the tolerizing phenotype of DCs. This can be due to several reasons. The first is that HBD is not required for DC maturation inhibition. In a previous work performed by our group [7] we showed that blocking antibodies directed against TSP-1 C-terminus and type 1 repeats (CD47, CD51 and CD36 respectively) inhibited up to 80% of the TSP-1 tolerizing phenotype. Thus, the tolerance effect could very well be mediated by interaction of the TSP-1 C terminus with CD47 [15], [16], or interaction of the type I repeats with CD36 [17]. Another possibility is that HBD plays a role in creating the tolerizing phenotype, but only as a part of TSP-1, when a signalosome is formed [7]. Indeed, some actions mediated by TSP-I require simultaneous interactions in other regions of the molecule [18] where intracellular crosstalks, mediated simultaneously through several receptors, are necessary. Our finding that blockage with anti-HBD (N20, Santa Cruz) did inhibit development of a tolerizing phenotype [7] supports this concept. An additional explanation may be a two-step mechanism, for example augmentation of apoptotic cell uptake that leads later to a more pronounced tolerizing phenotype. Thus, HBD is essentially a prophagocytic protein that enhances phagocytosis of apoptotic cells when binding to an iDC. Binding of TSP-1 as well as Annexin-1, phosphatidylserine, and probably additional molecules, allows DC immune paralysis. Finally, it is possible that trimeric HBD is needed for the full HBD effect, as it has been shown that trimetric HBD may act differently from monomeric HBD [19], [20].
###end p 68
###begin p 69
There was some difference in phagocytic efficiency in the two rHBD samples. Our rHBD lacks the leader peptide (the first 19 amino acids), which is present in the rHBD2. The rest of the protein is completely identical. Both rHBD samples significantly increased phagocytic state and did not alter maturation, however activity was somewhat reduced in the rHBD2 sample. It seems that the cause for this difference is storage conditions, which preserve the HBD's biological activity. Indeed, we have found that storage of rHBD1 in 20% glycerol at -80degreesC protects the best biological activity, whereas storage at -20degreesC in PBS, the storage regimen for the rHBD2, activity was reduced (not shown).
###end p 69
###begin p 70
In summary, we have shown that rHBD by itself is not directly responsible for immune paralysis and tolerizing phenotype of DCs, at least in the monomeric form, but has a significant role in rendering DCs phagocytic. Indirectly, as a part of TSP-1, or in its trimeric form, rHBD may influence development of the tolerizing phenotype of DCs following binding of TSP-1.
