Hepatitis C virus (HCV) encodes two transmembrane glycoproteins E1 and E2 which form a heterodimer. E1 is believed to mediate fusion while E2 has been shown to bind cellular receptors. It is clear that HCV uses a multi-receptor complex to gain entry into susceptible cells, however key elements of this complex remain elusive. In this study, the role of a highly conserved RGE/RGD motif of HCV E2 glycoprotein in viral entry was examined. The effect of each substitution mutation in this motif was tested by challenging susceptible cell lines with mutant HCV E1E2 pseudotyped viruses generated using a lentiviral system (HCVpp). In addition to assaying infectivity, producer cell expression and HCVpp incorporation of HCV E2 proteins, CD81 binding profiles, and conformation of mutants were examined.

Based on these characteristics, mutants either displayed wt characteristics (high infectivity [>/= 90% of wt HCVpp], CD81 binding, E1E2 expression, and incorporation into viral particles and proper conformation) or very low infectivity (</= 20% of wt HCVpp). Only amino acid substitutions of the 3rd position (D or E) resulted in wt characteristics as long as the negative charge was maintained or a neutral alanine was introduced. A change in charge to a positive lysine, disrupted HCVpp infectivity at this position.

Although most amino acid substitutions within this conserved motif displayed greatly reduced HCVpp infectivity, they retained soluble CD81 binding, proper E2 conformation, and incorporation into HCVpp. Our results suggest that although RGE/D is a well-defined integrin binding motif, in this case the role of these three hyperconserved amino acids does not appear to be integrin binding. As the extent of conservation of this region extends well beyond these three amino acids, we speculate that this region may play an important role in the structure of HCV E2 or in mediating the interaction with other factor(s) during viral entry.

To complete its replication cycle, a virus needs to gain access to the cell cytoplasm by crossing the plasma membrane of a host cell. For enveloped viruses, such as hepatitis C virus (HCV), this entails binding at the cell surface, followed by endocytosis [1]. Entry of HCV is an intricate process that is not fully understood. Evidence indicates that HCV requires multiple receptors to invade host cells [2-4]. However, the key components that mediate susceptibility to HCV still remain elusive. It is known that the HCV E1 and E2 glycoproteins mediate the tightly regulated process of cell binding and membrane fusion.

Several cellular surface molecules have been implicated in HCV entry, including: CD81 [5-8], scavenger receptor class B type I (SR-BI) [9-12], the low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) [13,14], Claudin-1, 6 and 9 [15-17], dendritic-cell-specific intercellular adhesion molecule 3-grabbing nonintegrin (DC-SIGN) [18-20] and Liver/lymph node-specific intercellular adhesion molecule-3-grabbing integrin (L-SIGN) [21,22]. While L-SIGN and DC-SIGN are not expressed on hepatocytes, it is believed that dendritic cells expressing these molecules facilitate persistent infection by capturing and delivering the virus to the liver. SR-BI is a multiligand receptor that binds several lipoproteins, including HDL, LDL and VLDL. It is primarily expressed in the liver and facilitates the uptake of lipids [23,24].

As the HCV E2 glycoprotein is exposed to so much selective pressure and the high error rate inherent in RNA viruses [25], regions conserved across genotypes suggest an important role in virus viability. Sequence alignment of E2 of several genotypes of HCV revealed a highly conserved RGE or RGD motif at amino acids 648-650 (Fig. 1), which is also flanked upstream and downstream by a large stretch of sequence conservation. The presence of RGD/RGE in HCV E2 led us to speculate that integrins might be involved in HCV binding to the target cells, as RGD and RGE have been identified as an integrin binding motif [26-28].

Integrins belong to a large family of cell adhesion molecules (CAMs) [29,30]. They are responsible for cell and extracellular matrix interactions as well as cell-cell interactions. Unlike many other cell surface receptors, integrins bind with very low affinity, however they are present in much larger numbers than other receptors. The binding of integrins can be compared to Velcro(R), low affinity but with many interaction sites. Integrins are heterodimeric receptors made up of an alpha and beta subunit [31,32].

In this study, to define the role of the conserved RGE/RGD motif of E2 in HCV binding and entry, individual substitutions of these three amino acids were generated via site-directed mutagenesis. Our results suggest that although RGE/D motif of HCV E2 is critical for viral entry, integrins are probably not involved. Based on the size of this conserved region, we speculate that it is of a structural/functional nature.

Sequence alignment of several genotypes of HCV E2 reveals all genotypes contain either a RGE or RGD motif upstream of the transmembrane domain of E2 (aa 648-650) (Fig. 1). Furthermore, a large region of sequence conservation around RGE/RGD is observed, suggesting a role(s) of this region in structure or/and function of E2.

To determine if the conserved RGE/RGD motif of HCV E2 is vital for mediating HCVpp entry, substitutions were generated within the context of H77 E2. Three types of substitutions were generated: (1) alanine substitutions, (2) amino acid changes that maintained charge characteristics and (3) mutations that changed the charge at that position. After sequence confirmation of the substitutions, HCVpp infectivity of permissive Huh7 cells was assessed by infecting cells with HIV pseudotyped with wt or the RGE/RGD motif substitutions (Fig. 2). Infectivity was determined as a measure of luciferase activity and VSVG/HIV and EnvA/HIV were used as positive and negative controls, respectively.

The two amino acid substitutions generated at the first position, AGE and KGE, completely abrogated HCVpp infectivity, reducing luciferase levels down to 3 and 5% respective of wt. Changing the glycine to an alanine at the second position also reduced infectivity to 18%. As expected, changing RGE to RGD had no adverse affect on the viability of infection and resulted in 94% of wt. Interestingly, substituting the negatively charged aspartic acid (D) or glutamic acid (E) to a neutral alanine (A) did not impair infectivity of HCVpp, however a positive lysine (K) at this position reduced HCVpp to 14% of wt. This suggests that a negative or neutral charge at this position is critical in maintaining HCV E2 interactions with susceptible cells.

HCVpp was harvested at 48 h PI and used to infect Huh7 cells. Infectivity was measured 72 h PI using a luciferase reporter assay. Numbers shown above the bars are infectivity of each mutant expressed as a percentage of the infectivity observed for the wild-type (wt) H77 E1E2. Values shown are the mean and standard error for a minimum of three assays.

Blots were also probed for actin as a protein loading control. Cell lysates probed with anti-E2 antibody revealed a band of ~70 kDa for all wt and mutant glycoprotein transfected cells, corresponding to the size of the HCV E2 glycoprotein (Fig. 3A). All substitutions exhibited similar expression levels within producer cell lysate.

As genotype 1a strain H77 contains an RGE sequence, synthetic peptides with or without RGE or RGD sequences were incubated with Huh7 cells for 1 h at 4degreesC prior to HCVpp infection. Four synthetic peptides were used: GRGDTP, GRGESP and a RGD or RGE peptide followed by 15 amino acids corresponding to the sequence of the H77 E2 sequence (RGD-E2 and RGE-E2 respectively). The short, six amino acid peptide GRGESP inhibited HCVpp entry approximately 80% at a concentration of 15 mM, however the RGE-E2 peptide did not inhibit HCVpp (Fig. 4B). This could be due to the larger peptides folding on themselves, masking the RGE sequence. Inhibition by the GRGESP peptide suggests a potential RGE-dependent interaction with the Huh7 cell, therefore blocking HCVpp with integrin antibodies was pursued.

To investigate whether amino acid substitutions within the RGE/RGD domain of E2 reduced HCVpp infectivity through a disruption of CD81 binding, HCV E2 binding to soluble CD81 was assayed. Binding of HCV E1E2 proteins to a purified GST tag was used as a control. None of the amino acid substitutions interfered with CD81 and HCV E2 glycoprotein binding (Fig. 5). These results indicate that decrease in HCVpp infectivity is not due to a loss of CD81/E2 interaction.

Binding of hepatitis C virus E2 glycoproteins containing RGE substitutions to soluble CD81. 293 T cells transfected with HCV E1E2 wt of mutant expression vectors were lysed 24 h post-transfection. Cleared cell lysate was incubated with soluble CD81-GST fusion protein. Binding to CD81 was determined by Western blot analysis of E2 and the GST tag. As a negative control, GST protein without soluble CD81 was incubated with HCV wt.

To confirm that loss of HCVpp infectivity was not due to a more general disruption of E2 structure in this region of the protein, we performed immunoprecipitation with an antibody that recognizes a conformational epitope within the putative CD81 binding regions 2 and 3 [34]. Wt and the amino acid substitutions as well as HCV E2 R614A, which was not detectable in a previous study and serves as a negative control [35], were analyzed in the immunoprecipitation. Except for the R614A negative control, all amino acid substitutions were captured with the conformational antibody, consistent with proper folding (Fig. 6).

In this study, we characterized an RGE/RGD motif at amino acids 648-650 of HCV E2. As integrins are frequently used as receptors for various viral pathogens, and many integrins recognize RGD sequences, this highly conserved RGE or RGD motif in the HCV glycoprotein E2 (see Fig. 1), led us to hypothesize that integrins might play a role in HCV binding and entry. While this three amino acid motif is suggestive of an integrin binding ligand, our data does not support this hypothesis. Rather, the large size of this conserved region is more likely indicative of a structural or other functional role for this region of the E2 glycoprotein.

Of the six amino acid substitutions introduced in this motif, only substitutions of the last position (aa 650) maintained infectivity when replaced with either an amino acid of the same, negative charge (substituting a glutamic acid with an aspartic acid) or with a neutral alanine. The E2 gene used in this study, derived from an H77 strain, contains an RGE at this position. Changing the glutamic acid to an aspartic acid, which is the other variation of this conserved motif, maintains infectivity levels 94% of RGE. A change in charge at this position to a positive amino acid (lysine) however, impaired infectivity significantly; dropping infection levels to only 14% of wt (see Fig. 2). Changes in the first two positions of this motif reduced HCVpp entry to 3-18%. Producer cell expression and viral particle incorporation of all of these substitutions were comparable to wt and could not account for the reduced HCVpp infectivity (see Fig. 3). Mutational analysis of this highly conserved, three amino acid motif underlines its importance in maintaining HCVpp infectivity.

Receptor binding sites of E2 are not fully understood; therefore we sought to determine whether or not this conserved region is involved in binding to CD81. We assayed the soluble-CD81 binding properties of RGE/D amino acid substitutions. Mutant E2 protein was expressed in 293 T cells and then assayed for its binding of soluble CD81 bound to a GST tag. A GST protein alone was utilized as a negative control. All mutants bound CD81 at wt level, suggesting that whatever role this region plays in the HCV replication cycle, it does not appear to relate to CD81 binding (see Fig. 5). Based on the conformational AR3A antibody analysis (see Fig. 6) and soluble CD81 binding (see Fig. 5), we can conclude that the CD81 binding epitopes are intact.

The conserved RGE/D initially led us to speculate that integrins were involved in mediating viral entry of HCV. Integrins have been shown to mediate binding of several viruses, including adenovirus, echovirus and hantavirus [36]. There are 16 alpha subunits and 8 beta subunits that can interact in numerous ways to generate receptors of differing ligand specificity. Approximately 24 different heterodimers of alphabeta subunits have been identified, suggesting not all subunits are capable of interacting with one another [37]. We preincubated Huh7 cells with 1-6 and V alpha integrin blocking antibodies prior to HCVpp challenge to asses if infectivity was impaired. The inability of these blocking antibodies to prevent HCVpp infectivity (data not shown) suggests that at least these alpha subunits, are not involved in HCV entry. This conclusion is consistent with the other results in this study, in particular the mutational analysis that demonstrates that RGA maintains HCVpp entry.

Peptides containing either an RGD or RGE motif were preincubated with Huh7 cells to determine if masking a potential ligand site on the cell surface could impact HCVpp infectivity. Of the four peptides generated, the short, six amino acid peptide GRGESP, reduced HCVpp infectivity by approximately 80% at 15 mM (see Fig. 4B). If integrins were directly involved, we would expect to see the short RGD containing peptide having the same inhibitory effect on HCVpp entry, however it did not impair HCVpp entry. The other RGE containing peptide, RGE-E2, which is followed by 15 amino acids corresponding to the HCV E2 H77 strain, did not affect HCVpp entry. This could be due to the peptide folding on itself and masking the RGE sequence. Furthermore, addition of fibronectin prior to HCVpp challenge did not have a significant effect on inhibiting HCVpp entry (see Fig. 4A) suggesting that the function of this region is not RGE/D dependent binding to integrins.

As sequence alignment demonstrates a much larger span of conservation than simply these three residues (see Fig. 1), we suspect this entire stretch of conserved amino acids is critical to HCV infection. It is possible that this conserved region, including the RGE/RGD motif of E2, is critical for the proper folding and structure of E2. Just downstream of this three amino acid motif is the transmembrane domain, which has been well defined in its involvement in entry [38-41]. Further investigation is needed to dissect the exact role of this highly conserved region of E2 in HCV entry, however this work clearly demonstrates it plays a key role in the HCV replication cycle.

Pseudotyped viruses were produced by cotransfecting DNA encoding wild-type (wt) or mutant glycoproteins with the Env-deficient HIV vector carrying a luciferase reporter gene (pNL4-3-Luc-R--E-) into 293 T producer cells. One microgram of the wt or mutant glycoprotein expression plasmid and 3 mug of pNL4-3-Luc-R--E- were used to transfect 293 T cells (90% confluent) in 6-well plates with polyethylenimine (PEI). The DNA cocktail was added to 200 mul Opti-MEM (Gibco) media and PEI was added at 2x the volume of DNA. The mixture was incubated at room temperature for 15 min. 293 T producer cells were rinsed with PBS (no Ca++/no Mg++). Eight hundred microliters of Opti-MEM (Gibco) was added to each well and the PEI/DNA mixture was added. After 5-6 h incubation at 37degreesC, the DNA cocktail was aspirated off and 3 ml cell culture media was added per well. A minimum of two wells per mutant were done at each time, for a total of 6 ml. The supernatants containing the pseudotyped viruses were collected 48 h post-transfection (PT) and filtered through a 0.45 mum-pore-size filter (Nalgene).

293 T producer cells were transfected with 1 mug wt or a selection of CD81 binding deficient or binding competent mutant HCV E1E2 DNA constructs using PEI. After 48 h cells were lysed in 0.5% Triton X-100 lysis buffer with protease inhibitor on ice for 30 min. Cell lysates were clarified by centrifuging at 20,000 x g for 30 min at 4degreesC. Four-hundred microliters of clarified lysates from these cells were incubated with 1 mug of AR3A conformational antibody [34] with gentle rocking at 4degreesC for 16 h. Immobilized protein A (Pierce) beads were rinsed three times with PBS (140 mM NaCl, 27 mM KCl, 10 mM Na2HPO4, 1.8 mM KH2PO4). Fifty microliters of rinsed polyA beads were then added to the cell lysate/antibody cocktail and incubated with gentle rocking at 4degreesC for 2 h. Beads were washed three times with 100 mul 0.5% Triton lysis buffer. SDS-PAGE loading dye was added to the beads and samples were boiled at 95degreesC for 5 min. Slurry was spun down and supernatant was collected for SDS-PAGE separation and Western blot analysis with a polyclonal anti E2 antibody (Virostat).
