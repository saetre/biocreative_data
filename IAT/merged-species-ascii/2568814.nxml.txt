Osteoclastogenesis is dependent on distinct stimuli that prime and activate osteoclast differentiation. One cytokine needed to prime monocytes for osteoclastogenesis is TGF-beta, which enables and augments RANKL and TNF-alpha-induced osteoclast differentiation. However, the precise time-period during which this occurs and the molecular mechanism mediating this action are unknown. We report here TGF-beta prime monocytes for osteoclast formation within 24 h by regulating expression of NFATc1, a key osteoclastic transcription factor. TGF-beta directly induces cytoplasmic NFATc1 expression within 24 h, but is unable to stimulate NFATc1 nuclear translocation. Furthermore, RANKL-induced NFATc1 expression is dependent on the presence of TGF-beta during the early stages of osteoclastogenesis. Similarly, TNF-alpha activates osteoclastogenesis by stimulating translocation of TGF-beta-induced NFATc1. In light of these findings, it is apparent that osteoclast formation is dependent on coordinated interactions between TGF-beta and RANKL/TNF-alpha that regulate the expression and intracellular distribution of NFATc1 during early stages of osteoclast differentiation.

Bone is optimized for the skeleton's mechanical and mineral storage roles. Changes in physical activity or circulating calcium elicit a remodeling response that maintains structural competency or restores serum calcium. This is mediated by osteoblasts, which synthesize new bone, and osteoclasts, which resorb bone. It is critical that osteoclast formation is tightly regulated as excessive resorption can cause disorders such as osteoporosis.

Activation of osteoclast differentiation from monocytic precursors is dependent on a balance between levels of the osteoblast-derived cytokine, receptor activator of nuclear factor-kappaB ligand (RANKL) and its soluble decoy receptor, osteoprotegerin (OPG). Resorptive stimuli increase RANKL and suppress OPG expression to activate osteoclast formation [1,2]. Subsequent binding of RANKL to its receptor RANK induces osteoclastic gene transcription via signaling intermediates including nuclear factor-kappaB (NFkappaB), nuclear factor of activated T cells c1 (NFATc1), and AP-1 (see [3]).

Alongside RANKL, monocytes require further bone-derived inputs to prime and enhance their response to RANKL. Without this enabling input osteoclastogenesis will not occur. This is supported by the observation that RANK expressing monocytes do not form osteoclasts outside of bone even in the presence of RANKL at doses far greater than needed to induce differentiation in vitro[4]. One key enabling factor is transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta), which primes and enhances the response of monocytes to RANKL or TNF-alpha [4-9]. Precursors failing to receive this priming stimulus will not develop into osteoclasts [4-6]. This facilitative action is in part achieved by antagonizing the anti-osteoclastic action of inflammatory cytokines, which would otherwise prime precursors to macrophage lineages [10,11]. However, this does not represent the sole mechanism by which TGF-beta facilitates and enhances osteoclastogenesis, as TGF-beta also augments osteoclast formation in the absence of inflammatory cytokines [5,9].

TGF-beta and RANKL utilize overlapping intracellular signaling cascades [3]. These regulate osteoclastic gene expression via key transcription factors such as NFATc1 and c-fos. Like TGF-beta, these transcription factors are essential for osteoclast formation [12,13]. It is possible, therefore, that TGF-beta's enabling and augmentative effect could be mediated via an action on these transcription factors. To investigate this, it was first necessary to determine the time-period during which TGF-beta enables osteoclastogenesis, and establish whether TGF-beta-induced signals are essential at the inception of osteoclastogenesis or necessary throughout the differentiation process. Once this had been established, the ability of TGF-beta to modify NFATc1 and c-fos expression during this period was examined.

TGF-beta commits monocytes to the osteoclastic lineage within 24 h

To establish when TGF-beta commits monocytes to the osteoclast lineage BMM were pre-incubated with TGF-beta for 1-72 h, and then cultured with combinations of M-CSF, RANKL, and IFN-gamma. BMM exposed to TGF-beta for only part of the pre-incubation period were grown with M-CSF alone for the remainder of the pre-treatment. Following pre-treatment all cultures were incubated for 5 days with combinations of M-CSF, RANKL, TGF-beta, and IFN-gamma.

As shown previously, IFN-gamma suppressed RANKL-induced osteoclast formation (Fig. 1) [15]. Pre-incubation with TGF-beta for 1-6 h was unable to overcome the inhibitory action of IFN-gamma. Whereas, pre-incubation with TGF-beta for 24 h completely abolished IFN-gamma's anti-osteoclastic action. Pre-incubating for 48 or 72 h did not further enhance osteoclast formation, suggesting that the intracellular events mediating TGF-beta's augmentative action are completely active within 24 h of TGF-beta exposure. Therefore, TGF-beta facilitates the initial events governing osteoclast formation.

Binding of RANKL to RANK activates several transcription factors responsible for promoting osteoclastic gene expression. These are not all activated within the same time-frame: early-response factors, such as c-fos, are activated before late-response factors, such as NFATc1 [16]. Like TGF-beta, these are essential for osteoclast differentiation. Precursors lacking NFATc1 or c-fos will not undergo osteoclast formation [12,13], whereas ectopic NFATc1 expression under certain circumstances may be sufficient for osteoclast differentiation in the absence of activating cytokines [17]. NFATc1 is therefore critical for osteoclastogenesis.

In light of this, we examined the effect of TGF-beta on NFATc1 expression. NFATc1 mRNA expression was low in non-committed BMM, whereas RANKL induced detectable levels within 24 h, which was strongly augmented in the presence of TGF-beta (Fig. 2A). Furthermore, TGF-beta itself induced a significant increase in NFATc1 expression (Fig. 2A and C) even in the presence of OPG and anti-TNF-alpha antibody (Fig. 2B). This suggests that TGF-beta is able to directly induce NFATc1 and also enhance RANKL-induced NFATc1 expression during the time-period when it enables and augments osteoclast differentiation.

TGF-beta and NFATc1 are both essential for osteoclastogenesis, as sequestering TGF-beta suppresses RANKL-induced osteoclast differentiation [5], while RANKL stimulated osteoclastogenesis is impaired in NFATc1 deficient monocytes [18]. Thus, it is conceivable that TGF-beta's facilitative action may depend on its ability to regulate RANKL-induced NFATc1 expression during initial stages of osteoclast differentiation. To assess this, the ability of RANKL to induce NFATc1 was assessed in cultures in which TGF-beta was removed using pan-specific TGF-beta antibody. This prevented RANKL-induced NFATc1 expression, with levels not significantly differing from M-CSF-treated controls (Fig. 2B and C), suggesting that RANKL-induced NFATc1 expression, a critical step in the molecular events determining osteoclast formation, is dependent on TGF-beta's enabling action and without this input osteoclast formation cannot occur.
###end p 24
###begin p 25
This dependence could represent one of two possibilities. First, it could reflect the established requirement of TGF-beta for osteoclast differentiation; the lack of expression occurring as a secondary consequence of the block in osteoclast formation. On the other hand, it could be the primary mechanism by which TGF-beta enables osteoclastogenesis: TGF-beta providing an input to induce NFATc1 expression in non-committed precursors. NFATc1 is thereafter available to be activated by RANKL to propagate the chain of downstream events that result in osteoclast formation. At present, it is not possible to draw a firm conclusion on which interpretation is correct; however, the ability of TGF-beta to directly stimulate NFATc1 expression is more in keeping with the second hypothesis.

While TGF-beta induces NFATc1 expression it is unable to stimulate osteoclastogenesis. Previous studies suggest that NFATc1 is not only necessary for osteoclast formation but may be sufficient to stimulate osteoclastogenesis on its own [19]. If true, then it raises the question of why TGF-beta does not stimulate osteoclastogenesis in the absence of additional activating stimuli. There are several explanations for this; first TGF-beta may not induce all the transcription factors that cooperate with NFATc1 to promote osteoclastic gene expression such as members of the AP-1 family [12,18]. One key AP-1 member involved in osteoclast differentiation is c-fos, which is induced in monocytes by RANKL [20]. However, the effect of TGF-beta on c-fos expression is unclear. Second, while TGF-beta induces NFATc1 expression it may not provide the necessary inputs to stimulate its nuclear translocation. This is regulated by post-translational modifications that expose nuclear localization signals [21]. Without these modifications osteoclastic gene expression cannot proceed [12,19,22]. Thus, it is conceivable that while TGF-beta induces NFAT expression it may not necessarily stimulate nuclear translocation.

Therefore, to assess these possibilities we examined the ability of TGF-beta to induce c-fos expression and NFATc1 nuclear translocation. To examine c-fos expression BMM were incubated for 24 h with M-CSF and TGF-beta in the presence of OPG and anti-TNF-alpha antibody to sequester any RANKL or TNF-alpha present in the culture environment. c-fos mRNA was not detectable in control cultures treated with M-CSF alone, but was readily detectable in cultures incubated with M-CSF and RANKL for 24 h (Fig. 3A). However, in contrast to its action on NFATc1, TGF-beta was unable to induce c-fos expression in BMM (Fig. 3A). To examine the ability of TGF-beta to regulate NFATc1 migration, fluorescent immunocytochemistry was used to determine the distribution of NFATc1 in BMM treated with or without TGF-beta. In keeping with the Northern analysis data, NFATc1 immunofluorescence was not detected in unstimulated BMM (Fig. 3Bi), whereas BMM or RAW264.7 cells incubated with TGF-beta displayed intense NFATc1 staining (Fig. 3Bii-iv). Staining was predominantly cytoplasmic, suggesting that while TGF-beta increases NFATc1 protein levels it is not sufficient to induce nuclear translocation. Therefore, although TGF-beta may be required for NFATc1 expression it is not sufficient to induce its activation and nuclear translocation in monocytes. This suggests that the inability of TGF-beta to stimulate osteoclastogenesis is due to a combination of failing to induce c-fos and activate NFATc1 nuclear translocation.

Other cytokines in addition to RANKL are also capable of activating osteoclast formation. One such factor, TNF-alpha, directly stimulates osteoclast formation from BMM [23], and may have a role in excessive osteoclast formation seen in post-menopausal osteoporosis and rheumatoid arthritis [24]. TGF-beta is also essential for TNF-alpha-induced osteoclastogenesis [4]. TNF-alpha binding to its receptor activates a cascade of intracellular signals but in contrast to RANKL it does not activate TRAF6 which is required for the initial induction of NFATc1 expression [12]. As NFATc1 is critical for the early stages of osteoclast differentiation and TGF-beta is able to directly induce NFATc1 expression within 24 h we examined the possibility that TGF-beta-induced NFATc1 expression has a role in TNF-alpha activated osteoclast formation.

TNF-alpha did not significantly increase NFATc1 expression in monocytes, levels not differing from M-CSF controls (Fig. 4A). In contrast, TGF-beta directly induced a significant 4.6-fold increase in NFATc1 expression within 24 h (Fig. 4A), and similar levels were noted in cultures incubated with both TGF-beta and TNF-alpha (Fig. 4A). Thus, the inability of TNF-alpha to induce NFATc1 suggests that another TGF-beta may enable TNF-alpha-induced osteoclast formation by providing NFATc1 during the initial stages of differentiation. This is further underlined by a 2.9-fold reduction in NFATc1 expression in TNF-alpha treated cultures incubated with pan-specific TGF-beta antibody (p < 0.05), suggesting that basal levels of NFATc1 expression are to a large extent attributable to TGF-beta present within the culture environment (Fig. 4A). The inability of TNF-alpha to induce NFATc1 expression without TGF-beta being present was confirmed in immunofluorescence studies (Fig. 4B). No appreciable difference in staining intensity was seen in control cultures compared with those treated with TNF-alpha (Fig. 4Bi and ii). However, while TNF-alpha is unable to induce NFAT expression, it is able to stimulate nuclear accumulation of NFATc1 in cultures that have been pre-treated with TGF-beta (Fig. 4Biii). TNF-alpha activated osteoclast differentiation would therefore appear to rely on TGF-beta to promote an initial cytoplasmic increase in NFATc1, which is subsequently translocated to the nucleus under the influence of activating stimuli provided by TNF-alpha. Therefore, the formation of osteoclasts in inflammatory conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis may be controlled by a reciprocal interaction between TGF-beta and TNF-alpha on NFATc1 expression and activity; TGF-beta promoting cytoplasmic accumulation of NFATc1 which subsequently translocates to the nucleus under the influence of TNF-alpha.

To conclude our data clearly show that TGF-beta influences osteoclast formation by regulating NFATc1 expression, a critical component of the osteoclastic transcriptional machinery. TGF-beta acts directly on non-committed monocytes to enhance RANKL-induced NFATc1 expression; moreover, RANKL is unable to induce NFATc1 in the absence of TGF-beta. Thus, both the augmentative and enabling action of TGF-beta on osteoclast formation may be mediated through its ability to control cytoplasmic levels of NFATc1 during the early stages of osteoclastogenesis. Furthermore, it is likely that TGF-beta may facilitate TNF-alpha-induced osteoclast formation through a very similar NFATc1-dependent mechanism. Formation of osteoclasts during physiological remodeling and inflammatory conditions may be dependent on a coordinated interaction between TGF-beta and RANKL/TNF-alpha, which regulates the expression and intracellular distribution of NFATc1 during the initial stages of osteoclastogenesis.

Pre-incubation with TGF-beta for 24 h is sufficient to commit BMM to the osteoclast lineage. BMM were pre-treated with M-CSF with or without TGF-beta for 1, 6, 24, 48, and 72 h to determine the minimum period sufficient for TGF-beta to antagonize the anti-osteoclastic action of IFN-gamma. All cultures were pre-treated for 72 h irrespective of whether they received TGF-beta during pre-treatment regime. Cultures exposed to TGF-beta for a proportion of the pre-incubation period had TGF-beta removed after the relevant exposure time and replaced with M-CSF. Following pre-treatment all cultures were washed and incubated for 5 days with combinations of M-CSF, RANKL, TGF-beta, and IFN-gamma. Controls consisted of BMM incubated with TGF-beta throughout the pre-incubation period and exposed to M-CSF, RANKL, and TGF-beta in the differentiation period. Values are expressed as means +/- SEM of four separate experiments n = 20, *p < 0.05 versus group pre-treated with M-CSF alone then cultured in M-CSF, RANKL, and IFN-gamma.
