In the liver of oviparous vertebrates vitellogenin gene expression is controlled by estrogen. The nucleotide sequence of the 5' flanking region of the Xenopus laevis vitellogenin genes A1, A2, B1 and B2 has been determined. These sequences have been compared to each other and to the equivalent region of the chicken vitellogenin II and apo-VLDLII genes which are also expressed in the liver in response to estrogen. The homology between the 5' flanking region of the Xenopus genes B1 and B2 is higher than between the corresponding regions of the other closely related genes A1 and A2. Four short blocks of sequence homology which are present at equivalent positions in the vitellogenin genes of both Xenopus laevis and chicken are characterized. A short sequence with two-fold rotational symmetry (GGTCANNNTGACC) was found at similar positions upstream of the five vitellogenin genes and is also present in two copies close to the 5' end of the chicken apo-VLDLII gene. The possible functional significance of this sequence, common to liver estrogen-responsive genes, is discussed.
