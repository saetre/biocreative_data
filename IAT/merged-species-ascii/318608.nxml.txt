We report the complete nucleotide sequence of a human beta actin cDNA. Both the 5' and 3' untranslated regions of the sequence are similar (greater than 80%) to the analogous regions of the rat beta-actin gene reported by Nudel et al (1983). When a segment of the 3' untranslated region is used as a radiolabelled probe, strong hybridization to chick beta actin mRNA is seen. This conservation of sequences suggests that strong selective pressures operate on non-translated segments of beta actin mRNA.
