A comparison of the nucleotide sequences from genomic DNA and cDNA of the ndhB gene from maize chloroplasts shows that the ndhB transcript is edited by C-to-U transitions at six positions which appear to exist as editing sites also in the chloroplast ndhB genes from rice and tobacco but not from liverwort. In order to identify possible sequence determinants necessary for editing, the sequences surrounding the newly identified ndhB and previously identified ndhA editing sites were compared with each other and with editing sites observed in plant mitochondrial transcripts. Among the chloroplast editing sites two closely positioned ndhB sites show similarity by sharing a common octanucleotide. The existence of the identical octanucleotide in the ndhJ gene whose transcript is not edited at the respective position, shows, however, that this octanucleotide is not sufficient to elicit the editing process. On the other hand, several of the chloroplast editing sites show sequence similarities with certain sets of consensus sequences reported earlier for editing sites of plant mitochondria. This supports the view that the editing processes of both plant organelles share common components and/or mechanistic steps and that the consensus sequences are part of the determinants necessary for editing.
