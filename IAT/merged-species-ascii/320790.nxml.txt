In Drosophila melanogaster at least six transfer RNA genes are located adjacent to the 3' end of the 5S RNA gene cluster. Three of these have been sequenced and identified as coding for glutamate tRNA4. In the chromosome they are arranged as tandem repeats on the same DNA strand and transcribed in the same direction as is 5S DNA, towards the centromere. We have also identified a sequence, the ACT-TA box, that is highly conserved among the polymerase III transcribed genes. Usually the sequence is located at 37 +/- 8 base pairs upstream from the first nucleotide of the structural gene. A similar sequence is also observed upstream of yeast and silkworm tRNA genes and the mitochondrial tRNA genes of mouse and humans.
