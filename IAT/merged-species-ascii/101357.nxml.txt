The steroid 5alpha-reductase (5alpha-R) plays an important physiological role in the conversion of steroid hormones such as androgen and progesterone to their 5alpha-reduced derivatives. 5alpha-R type II (5alpha-R2), one of two 5alpha-R isoforms, is thought to be a key enzyme in the generation of neuroactive steroids in the brain, particularly allopregnanolone (AP), via the production of its precursor dihydroprogesterone from progesterone. In the present study, we investigated possible regulatory mechanisms of 5alpha-R2 gene expression by steroid hormones in the female mouse brain. We first cloned mouse 5alpha-R2 (m5alpha-R2) cDNA by degenerate PCR, and found that progesterone induced 5alpha-R2 gene expression to levels detectable by in situ hybridization in female mouse brains. Functional analysis of the m5alpha-R2 gene promoter by a transient expression assay with human progesterone receptor (PR) and androgen receptor (AR) expression vectors identified a progesterone and androgen regulatory element (m5alpha-R2 PRE/ARE). Results of an electrophoretic mobility shift assay revealed that both PR and AR homodimers bound directly to m5alpha-R2 PRE/ARE sequence. These findings suggest that the gene expression of m5alpha-R2 is transcriptionally regulated by progesterone in female brains.

The steroid 5alpha-reductase (5alpha-R) is a key enzyme in the conversion of several Delta4-3keto steroids such as testosterone, progesterone, aldosterone and corticosterone, into their respective 5alpha-reduced derivatives (1-3). Two isoforms of 5alpha-R have been identified. While these isoforms catalyze the same reaction, they possess different biochemical and pharmacological properties, and display distinct expression patterns in tissues (4-7). Type I (5alpha-R1) is widely distributed throughout the body, and is most abundant in the liver where it catabolizes steroids. Type II (5alpha-R2) is primarily expressed in target tissues for androgens, such as the prostate and seminal vesicles, and is responsible for converting testosterone into dihydrotestosterone (DHT), a potent natural androgen. Impaired 5alpha-R2 activity caused by mutations in the human 5alpha-R2 gene results in insufficient DHT production, leading to male pseudohermaphroditism (5,8). Recently, it was found that 5alpha-R2 was expressed in male rat brains at detectable levels after testosterone was given. This raised the possibility that the testosterone-induced up-regulation of 5alpha-R2 gene expression and resultant enhanced production of DHT was important for mediating the male sexual behavior and aggression that occurred during a very critical period (9). In contrast, the physiological role of 5alpha-R2 in the female brain remains largely unknown.

5alpha-R2 is also known to metabolize progesterone into dihydroprogesterone (DHP), and DHP is further converted into allopregnanolene (AP) by 3alpha-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (3alpha-HSD) (10,11). AP is thought to exert anti-convulsant and anxiolytic-like actions (12,13) by binding to allosteric sites on neurotransmitter-gated ion channels, such as the gamma-amino butyric acid type A (GABAA) receptor (14-16). When brain progesterone and AP levels are increased during pregnancy or transient stress, expression of genes for GABAA receptor inhibitory subunits alpha4 (17-20) were shown to be down-regulated, possibly resulting in the potentiation of AP action through enhanced GABAA receptor function. Nonetheless, there is little information concerning the effects of progesterone on 5alpha-R2 gene expression in the female brain.

Androgens and progesterone are believed to mediate their effects through the transcriptional control of specific sets of target genes via nuclear receptors (21-23). Androgen receptor (AR) and progesterone receptor (PR) are members of the nuclear receptor superfamily, and act as hormone-inducible transcription factors that bind specific DNA elements as homodimers (24-28). The DNA elements that bind AR and PR share the common sequence 5'-AGAACANNNTGTTCT-3', known as the consensus progesterone/androgen response element (PRE/ARE) (29). As both hormone receptors recognize the same sequence, it is likely that the same genes are regulated when either AR or PR are present in a given tissue or cell (30-33). Therefore, the fact that the transcriptional control of 5alpha-R2 is regulated by the DHT-AR system in the male brain raises the possibility that progesterone may act as a positive regulator for 5alpha-R2 gene expression in the female brain.

To test this hypothesis, the present study was undertaken to examine 5alpha-R2 gene expression in female mice. First, the cDNA of mouse 5alpha-R2 (m5alpha-R2) was amplified by degenerate PCR and cloned. The 5alpha-R2 gene expression was induced by the treatment of either progesterone or androgen in female mouse brains. In situ analyses of female brains detected the 5alpha-R2 transcript in the hippocampus of the mice treated with progesterone. Furthermore, the putative PRE/ARE was identified in the m5alpha-R2 gene promoter. Thus, our results suggested that the progesterone-induced expression of 5alpha-R2 promoted AP production in the female brain.

Total RNA was isolated from kidneys of 10-week-old female mice (ICR CD1; Charles River Laboratories, Inc.) using isogen solution (Nippongene) and reverse transcribed using an oligo(dT)18 primer and SuperScript II reverse transcriptase (Life Technologies, Inc.). Degenerate PCR was then performed using specific primers based on homologous regions of rat and human 5alpha-R2 sequences (1,4,8): 5'-ATGCAGATTGTCTGCCAKCAG-3' (nucleotides 1-21) and 5'-TTAAAAGATGAATGGAAT-3' (nucleotides 745-765). PCR products of the expected size (765 bp) were subcloned into the pcDNA3 expression vector under control of the cytomegalovirus promoter (Invitrogen), and subjected to sequence analysis using a Prism 377 DNA (Applied Biosystems).

cDNA encoding m5alpha-R2 and the mutant G34R (34) was subcloned into the pcDNA3 (Invitrogen) expression vector. A series of deletion mutants of the m5alpha-R2 gene promoter, consensus PRE/ARE (5'-AGAACATCCTGTTCT-3') (x2) with the thymidine kinase (tk) short promoter, and m5alpha-R2 PRE/ARE x2 with the tk short promoter were subcloned into the pGL3 reporter plasmid (Invitrogen). The 5'-flanking region of the m5alpha-R2 gene was isolated by the inverse PCR. Primers recognizing the predicted start of exon 1 (5'-CCAAAGCACAGGATCAGGGT-3'), and predicted end of exon 1 5'-TTGGACCTCCGGGGAATGTG-3') were used to amplify product from circularized genomic DNA.

5alpha-R2 activity was assayed using the nuclear receptor-mediated transactivation method (35), COS-1 cells were maintained in DMEM without phenol red and supplemented with 5% FBS stripped with dextran-coated charcoal. Cells cultured with precursors were transiently transfected with 50 and 5 ng expression vectors for nuclear receptors and m5alpha-R2, respectively, and 0.5 microg reporter plasmid (Firefly luciferase) using the Lipofectin reagent (Gibco BRL). Bluescribe M13+ (Stratagene) was used as a carrier to adjust the total amount of DNA to 1.5 microg for transfection and 1 nM steroid hormone used as a positive control. Transfection efficiency was normalized according to Renilla luciferase activity (derived from pRL-CMV) as an internal control. The m5alpha-R2 enzyme activity was assayed also by in vitro converting method (36) with the cell extract (10 mM Tris-HCl pH 5.0, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 10% glycerol) of COS-1 cells transfected with the m5alpha-R2, rat 5alpha-R2 or mutant G34R expression plasmids. The cell extracts (30 microg protein) were incubated in 0.1 M Tris-HCl buffer pH 5.0 containing either 5 microM [14C]teststerone or progesterone (NENtrade mark Life Science Product) and 5 mM NADPH (Sigma) for 1 h at 37degreesC. The labeled steroids were extracted into methylene chroride, resuspended in chloroform-methanol (3:1, v/v) and developed by chloroform-ethylacetate (2:1, v/v) onto Silica Gel 60 F254 TLC plates (Merck) with the detection of converted steroids by autoradiography.

Aliquots of total RNA (3 microg) extracted from mouse brains were reverse-transcribed using the SuperScript pre-amplification system (Gibco BRL) according to the manufacturer's instructions. PCR was performed in a 25 microl reaction volume containing 1 microl 1/20 reverse transcription mix solution, 0.4 microM primers, 0.25 mM dNTPs and 0.125 U AmpliTaq Gold DNA polymerase (Perkin-Elmer). After 5 min pre-incubation at 96degreesC, amplification of mouse 5alpha-R2, histidine decarboxylase (HDC) (37) or beta-actin cDNA was performed for 35, 35 or 25 cycles, respectively. Cycles consisted of 1 min denaturation at 96degreesC, 1 min annealing at 56degreesC and 1 min extension at 72degreesC. Primers sets used were as follows: 5'-TTGGACCTCCGGGGAATGTG-3' and 5'-GGCTGGAACAGACCAAGTGG-3' for m5alpha-R2, 5'-CATCAAGCAGCCAGGAGCCAGTCTG-3' and 5'-GCACGGTAGCTGGCGAGCACACTG-3' for mouse HDC, 5'-TGGAATCCTGTGGCATCCATGAAACT-3' and 5'-TAAAACGCAGCTCAGTAACTGTCCG-3' for mouse beta-actin.

m5alpha-R2 cDNA was isolated by PCR amplification using degenerate primers based on homologous sequences between human and rat 5alpha-R2 cDNAs. The isolated cDNA (765 bp) contained an ORF that encoded a putative 254 amino acid protein that showed high similarity to rat (94.9%) and human (75.7%) 5alpha-R2 sequences (Fig. 1A and B) (1). Amino acids critical for enzymatic function assumed from human genetic diseases were mostly identical to those mouse and rat sequences (indicated by asterisks, Fig. 1A) (5,34). The cloned m5alpha-R2 cDNA was in vitro translated resulting in a 29 kDa protein (Fig. 1C), in agreement with the predicted molecular size.

We then tested the enzymatic activity of the recombinant m5alpha-R2 using a nuclear receptor-mediated transactivation system (35). This system is based on the principle that the transactivation function of a nuclear receptor is initiated only by its endogenous ligand, and not by ligand precursors or metabolites (16). In the present study, the ability of m5alpha-R2 to metabolize androgen and progesterone was assessed with respect to the ligand-induced transactivation functions of AR and PR. While AR transactivation function was clearly induced by DHT, only a slight induction by testosterone was seen (Fig. 2A). The expression of m5alpha-R2 led to a 2-fold increase in testosterone-induced AR transactivation function (Fig. 2A, compare lanes 4 and 10). However, a putative inactivation mutant of m5alpha-R2 (G34R) failed to potentiate testosterone-induced AR transactivation function (34). Thus, our results suggested that the enzymatic conversion of testosterone into DHT was mediated by m5alpha-R2. Unlike the enhanced transactivation of testosterone-bound AR by m5alpha-R2, the progesterone-induced transactivation function of PR was reduced by the presence of m5alpha-R2 (Fig. 2B, compare lanes 4 and 8). This was due to the metabolic inactivation of progesterone into DHP, as mutant 5alpha-R2 (G34R) did not exhibit this effect. Moreover, we performed the in vitro converting assay (36) to confirm the 5alpha-R2 enzyme activity (Fig. 2C). The conversions of testosterone into DHT and progesterone into DHP by 5alpha-R2 were detected with equal efficiency by the rat 5alpha-R2 enzyme (Fig. 2C, compare lanes 2 and 3, or lanes 6 and 7). Thus, the cloned m5alpha-R2 appeared to possess the expected activities in steroid metabolism.

As m5alpha-R2 is thought to metabolize steroids into neurosteroids in the brain, the expression of 5alpha-R2 was examined in male and female mouse brains. No expression was detected in female brains by in situ hybridization. However, 4 h after the administration of progesterone (500 microg per mouse), clear m5alpha-R2 mRNA expression was detected in the hippocampus (Fig. 3A). RT-PCR (Fig. 3B) and northern blotting analyses confirmed the induction of the m5alpha-R2 gene in female brains by progesterone, while androgen induced the m5alpha-R2 gene in the male brain (data not shown) as expected from previous reports (9).

To address whether m5alpha-R2 gene induction in female brains by progesterone involved transcriptional or post-transcriptional mechanisms, we directly assessed the promoter function of the m5alpha-R2 gene. We first isolated the 5'-flanking region of the 5alpha-R2 by inverse-PCR using primers that corresponded to the exon 1 sequence, and a genomic fragment 780 bp upstream of the putative translation start site (ATG codon) was cloned (Fig. 4A) (41). Using this cloned genomic fragment, the transcription start site was determined by the primer extension method (38). Results indicated that the start site was located 89 bp upstream of the ORF, with a TATA box 30 bp upstream (Fig. 4A and B). A sequence closely related to the consensus PRE/ARE sequence (designated as m5alpha-R2 PRE/ARE hereafter) was present 657 bp upstream of the transcription start site, indicating possible regulation by progesterone and androgen via this element.

We then tested the function of the PRE/ARE-like sequence of m5alpha-R2 using a transient expression assay with expression vectors for PR and AR in COS-1 cells, and luciferase reporter plasmids bearing a series of the deletion mutants of the m5alpha-R2 gene promoter (Fig. 4A). Promoters with the intact m5alpha-R2 PRE/ARE conferred both androgen- and progesterone-specific responses in the presence of cognate receptor. However, deletion of m5alpha-R2 PRE/ARE caused complete loss of responsiveness to progesterone and androgen without reduction of basal m5alpha-R2 gene promoter activity (Fig. 5A). Like consensus PRE/ARE, m5alpha-R2 PRE/ARE conferred responsiveness to both hormones even when driven by the basal thymidine kinase (tk) promoter (Fig. 5B).

We then examined whether AR or PR homodimers directly bound to the identified m5alpha-R2 PRE/ARE. An EMSA was performed using the consensus PRE/ARE prepared for the transient expression assay (Fig. 5B) as a positive control. As shown in Figure 6, both AR and PR effectively bound both consensus and m5alpha-R2 PRE/ARE sequences (Fig. 6, lanes 2 and 5; 9 and 12). Moreover, in the presence of excess cold consensus PRE/ARE DNA, AR and PR binding was abolished (Fig. 6, lanes 3 and 6; 10 and 13). Thus, taken together, our results suggested that both hormone-bound steroid receptors controlled m5alpha-R2 gene transcription through m5alpha-R2 PRE/ARE.

To clarify the physiological roles of 5alpha-R2 in the activity of hormonal and neuroactive steroids in the brain, we studied the possible regulation of m5alpha-R2 gene expression by one of its enzymatic substrates, progesterone. We first cloned the m5alpha-R2 cDNA by degenerate PCR, and found that recombinant m5alpha-R2 protein expressed in cultured cells metabolized progesterone and androgen as shown using a nuclear receptor-mediated assay (35). Using the cDNA clone as an in situ hybridization probe, we found that m5alpha-R2 gene expression was undetectable in the female brain, but was induced up to detectable levels in the hippocampus of female mice by progesterone. A progesterone regulatory element was identified as a highly related sequence to the consensus PRE/ARE sequence in the m5alpha-R2 promoter, and this element, m5alpha-R2 PRE/ARE, was found to confer responsiveness to both progesterone and androgen, similar to consensus PRE/ARE. Thus, transcriptional control of m5alpha-R2 gene expression by progesterone and androgen appeared to be mediated through m5alpha-R2 PRE/ARE.

Neuroactive steroids, like AP, are thought to exert behavioral effects such as convulsant and anxiolytic-like actions through the modulation of neurotransmitter-gated iron channel functions through direct binding of their allosteric sites (43). The effects of neuroactive steroids, especially progesterone derivatives, appear to be more prominent in females with premenstrual syndrome (PMS) (18) or under transient stress (44). Lowered serum progesterone levels may lead to PMS due to insufficient production of neuroactive steroids in the female brain. In contrast, enhanced production of progesterone during pregnancy is thought to promote the production of neuroactive steroids. As 5alpha-R2 converts progesterone into DHP, the precursor of AP, 5alpha-R2 enzymatic activity in the female brain is likely to be physiologically important for the action of neuroactive steroids. The significant induction of m5alpha-R2 by progesterone in female brains was detected only in the hippocampus. Therefore, the physiological role of 5alpha-R2 in the hippocampus needs to be verified by specific disruption of the 5alpha-R2 gene in the hippocampus in further animal experiments.

The promoter of the m5alpha-R2 gene harbored several potential binding sites for distinct classes of transcription regulatory factors in addition to PR/AR. Among these, the presence of two SRY binding sites raises the possibility that m5alpha-R2 gene expression is induced to convert testosterone into the more active form DHT during embryogenesis to develop male reproductive organs, when SRY plays a critical role in sex determination (45). Moreover, due to the identification of a PRE/ARE in the m5alpha-R2 gene promoter presented in this study, it is possible that positive feedback regulation of m5alpha-R2 gene expression by androgen occurs during male reproductive organ development and may occur in adult males to maintain reproductive organ function. Indeed, genetic mutations in 5alpha-R2 that impair its enzymatic activity are known to cause the hereditary disease male pseudohermaphroditism (5,8), clearly indicating the indispensability of this enzyme in males. However, the physiological role of 5alpha-R2 in females remains to be examined in more detail during embryogenesis and in adulthood.
