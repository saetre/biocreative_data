###begin p 3
Inside the spectrum of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, simple fatty liver is generally thought of as being "non progressive", differently from non-alcoholic steatohepatitis, which increases in severity due to the presence of apoptosis/inflammation and fibrosis. The "benignity" of fatty liver is widely accepted but conceptually difficult to maintain because the mechanisms underlying this entity are the same ones that determine the more severe form.

High concentrations of transforming growth factor-beta1 were noticed in patients suffering from both fatty liver and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis, 129.1 (45.4) versus 116.8 (42.2) ng/mL, P = 0.2; they were significantly superior to those of chronic hepatitis C patients 87.5 (39.5) ng/mL, P < 0.001. Ferritin levels were on average above normal values and similar in the three groups (P = 0.9), also when adjusted for gender (P = 0.5) and age (P = 0.3).

Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) represents a complex of liver diseases that range from simple fatty liver (FL), at the most clinically benign end of the spectrum, through an intermediate, generally progressive lesion, non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) to cirrhosis, at the opposite end. Diagnosis of NAFLD can usually be done by imaging studies in absence of other liver disease. Liver biopsy is required to size disease severity (inflammation, degenerative lesion and fibrosis), even though some limitations cast doubts on its use in clinical settings [1].

The definition of "benignity" concerning FL is wide-accepted [2] but conceptually difficult to maintain because the mechanisms, i.e., insulin resistance (IR), underlying this entity are the same ones that determine the more severe form.

The key process in the progression of NAFLD from the very beginning to the end is fibrosis. An animal model of "fibrosing steatohepatitis" that replicates the histologic features of human NASH stresses the sequence of steatosis, inflammatory cell injury and fibrogenesis, mediated by hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) via up-regulation of transforming growth factor-beta1 (TGF-beta1) [3]. An alternative pattern is followed by leptin that facilitates proliferation and prevents apoptosis of HSCs [4].

There is an increasing body of evidence that iron overload is associated with metabolic syndrome (MS) and NAFLD [5]. Observation of liver fibrosis in a rat model of NASH suggests that iron induces increase in hepatocytes apoptosis and contributes to the development of fibrosis directly or indirectly via induction of TGF-beta1 production in hepatocytes and macrophages at an earlier time than expected [6]. It is important to stress that hepatocyte apoptosis is significantly increased in patients with NASH and correlates with disease severity [7].

TGF-beta1 is a profibrotic cytokine whose action is mediated by Smad proteins and p38 MAPK. They have been found to independently and additively regulate alpha1(I) collagen gene expression by transcriptional activation, while p38 MAPK, but not Smad signaling, increases alpha1(I) collagen mRNA stability leading to increased synthesis and deposition of type I collagen [8].

As previously reported, histology, which has not probably an optimal sensitivity and specificity, leads to biased accuracy estimates and gives a frozen-in-time picture. An approach to look into the supposed "benignity" of FL and "progressivity" of NASH is to speculate about eventual differences/similarities in mechanisms between the two entities. With this in mind, we tracked in a NAFLD cohort the behaviour of serum TGF-beta1, an indirect severity progression index, and ferritin, an ancillary marker for IR, correlating their concentrations to those present in chronic hepatitis C (CHC), disease characterized by the combination of apoptosis/inflammation and fibrosis, in which TGF-beta1 and iron overload could play a key role too [9,10].

Eighty-seven out of 108 patients initially selected agreed to perform liver biopsy. On the basis of the results of hepatic histology, 42 patients (19 females) were assigned to the NASH group and 45 (21 females) to the FL one. Steatohepatitis was graded on the basis of the degree of macrovesicular steatosis, mixed lobular inflammation and hepatocyte ballooning, using a composite NAFLD activity score (NASH, > 5) [13]. The presence of perisinusoidal fibrosis was noted and scored as none, rare, mild or moderate. Early fibrosis was distinguished from advanced fibrosis based on the presence of bridging fibrosis (score of 3 or more).

Thirty-eight individuals were diagnosed as to have elevated values of serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) for at least six months. These subjects possessed detectable serum HCV-RNA (COBAS AmpliScreen HCV Test, v2.0, with automated amplification and detection using polymerase chain reaction method on the COBAS AMPLICOR Analyzer, Roche; the lower detection limit was 200 IU/mL), before starting antiviral treatment. Thirty-six patients (17 females) underwent liver biopsy. Histological features were evaluated using the Ishak scoring system for inflammation and fibrosis [14]. In brief, inflammation was scored using four parameters (periportal or periseptal interface hepatitis, confluent necrosis, focal lytic necrosis and portal inflammation) to obtain a histological activity index (HAI, maximum score 18), and fibrosis was scored as 0 - 6. The selected patients' tissue specimens were considered adequate for evaluation when at least four portal (or septal) areas were available for review and if they had length superior to 1.5 cm.

The key findings we provide are briefly i) subjects with FL and NASH exhibit quite the same elevated values of serum TGF-beta1, both greater than those present in CHC patients; ii) there is a fair correlation between levels of this cytokine and ferritin in FL patients.

Our data somehow disagree with the body of present knowledge. In fact, they provide evidence for the idea that, being fibrosis the key process that distinguishes the non-progressive from the progressive form of NAFLD and having found a marker of fibrosis well represented in FL patients, FL should not be considered a benign disease yet. Further, we failed to confirm the crucial role of CRP in differentiating FL from NASH even though NASH patients revealed the highest concentrations [15].

Discussing possible mechanisms and explanations for our findings, we emphasize that TGF-beta1-induced fibrosis in organ pathology and dysfunction appears to be increasingly relevant to a variety of distinct diseases [16].

Enhanced serum TGF-beta1 concentrations could represent a marker of early activation of mesenchymal HSCs. This interpretation is strengthened by the findings of a negative correlation of serum TGF-beta1 with fibrosis score, feature of stable collagen deposition, and by a good correlation between the same cytokine and serum ferritin. In fact, liver iron deposits in CHC are common and associated with activation of HSCs, ultimately contributing to liver damage [10,17].

Increasing evidence suggests hepatocyte apoptosis, due to increased oxidative stress, is a key mediator of liver injury in NAFLD [18]. But, is apoptosis restricted to hepatocytes alone? It is likely that, in an initial phase, apoptosis also acts on activated HSCs decreasing the collagen fibres [19]. This could happen in FL. Successively, this mechanism does not prevent the waterfall effect of hepatic fibrosis, characteristic feature of NASH. Alternatively, being the deposition and degradation of hepatic fibrous tissue a dynamic equilibrium course, increased expression patterns of matrix-metalloproteinases -1, -2, -3, and tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases -1 and -2 genes could promotes the degradation of extra-cellular matrix in an early step, such as in FL. Anyway, the mechanisms remain to be further studied.

Although our results are referred to a larger population, we are not able to confirm that high levels of plasma TGF-beta1 represent a possible method of diagnosing NASH in NAFLD patients [20].

We found that the criterion of liver enzymes increase, widely used to separate NASH from FL, is vanishing according to a recent study in which 25 out of 64 (39%) patients with biopsy-proven FL was found to have ALT levels superior to 30 U/L [21]. In addition, having found no or negative correlation between ALT activity and TGF-beta1 levels in NASH and CHC patients, respectively, suggests that TGF-beta1 is related to apoptosis rather than to inflammation.

Firstly, does a randomized determination mirror the "at steady state" serum concentration of this cytokine?

TGF-beta1 differs from the majority of growth regulatory factors since it is generally synthesized and secreted in a biologically latent form, and this must be activated before TGF-beta1 can exert its biological effects on target cells. TGF-beta1 in this latent complex had a long plasma half-life (more than 100 min). Having found elevated values of serum TGF-beta1 in FL, it is likely that a hepatic over-expression of the same cytokine is present. The only one serum determination for each patient is a "snapshot in time" methodology, but this is understandable; this alone with small numbers of patients in the 3 subgroups limits any definitive conclusion that can be drawn from this study.

Our findings do not represent an isolate case. In fact, HSC activation was not correlated to HAI and fibrosis score, valued by Knodell and Batts separate systems, in a subset of patients who developed severe hepatitis C recurrence on 4-month after liver transplantation [22]. The interpretation could be that we similarly faced an early fibrogenesis that would have been apparent across a long period of time, making the TGF-beta1, indirect marker of HSC activation, better useful in predicting the subsequent hepatic fibrosis.

We could have carried out other markers of fibrosis for the noninvasively staging of NAFLD patients [23]. However, to date, none of these markers have been independently validated in different populations in a prospective way. Moreover, all of these studies have been tested in a cross-sectional fashion, and then the role of these biomarkers for monitoring disease progression remains completely unknown.

To let us get down to the grassroots of the FL benignity from the beginning we should relay on longitudinal observations lasting several years, but this approach is difficult to plan. Crucial future research directions could be assessing liver fibrosis in FL patients during a long period of time by using non invasive tools such as fibrosis markers or elastograghy.

Conclusion
###end title 79
###begin p 80
Similar levels of TFbeta1 and ferritin in fatty liver and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis suggest that these forms share some common aspects, regarding their progression. If FL can evolve in liver cirrhosis, factors underlying this illness should be more intensively corrected, representing NAFLD also an epiphenomenon of MS, which has become a major health problem.
