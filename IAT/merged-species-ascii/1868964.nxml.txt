Previous studies from acutely transfected HeLa cells have identified an acidic alpha-helix in the Type IIbeta PtdIns5P 4-kinase (PIPkin IIbeta) as a putative novel nuclear localisation sequence (Ciruela et al. Biochem. J. 364, 587-591; 2000). However, some heterogeneity in cellular localisation was always observed, and other published aspects of PIPkinIIbeta physiology are more consistent with an extra-nuclear function. As a means of resolving whether the endogenous PIPkin IIbeta is nuclear, we have used the high homologous recombination frequency of DT40 cells to knock an epitope tag (Mosedale et al, Nat Struct Biol. 12, 763-771; 2005) into one of the alleles of the DT40 PIPkin IIbeta gene. We show that PIPkin IIbeta is expressed as a tagged protein, is active as revealed by immunoprecipitation and enzyme assay, and that cellular fractionation reveals that it is indeed nuclear. Genomic tagging of endogenous proteins in DT40 cells is a technique that offers unique advantages in studying endogenous signalling proteins.

Inositol lipids have proliferated in their number and functions over the last twenty years such that they are now known to participate in many cellular processes. Although most of these functions are in the cytoplasm, there are also well defined functions within the nucleus (for reviews see [1-5]). In particular, the function of PtdIns(4,5)P2 in the nucleus has been a major focus of study, both in its own right as a lipid regulator of proteins, and as a precursor for diacylglycerol to activate nuclear PKC [1, 4, 5]. Thus the synthesis of PtdIns(4,5)P2 in the nucleus has been extensively studied, but is not yet fully understood.

Radiolabelling experiments on isolated nuclei suggest that the major route of synthesis of PtdIns(4,5)P2 is by the expected 5-phosphorylation of PtdIns4P [6]. The nuclear synthesis of PtdIns4P from PtdIns is probably catalysed by the Type IIIbeta PtdIns 4-kinase, which has been shown to be partly nuclear in its localisation [7, 8], and then the synthesis of PtdIns(4,5)P2 must proceed by a Type I PtdInsP kinase (PIPkin), most likely the Type Ialpha [4, 9] (human nomenclature-the mouse homologue is PIPkin Ibeta). However, there is also evidence in the nucleus for the alternative route of PtdIns(4,5)P2 synthesis [10], which is the 4-phosphorylation of PtdIns5P by Type II PIPkins. For example, PtdIns5P is found in the nucleus and its nuclear levels change with the cell cycle [11] or when cells are stressed [12], though its route of synthesis is currently unknown.

Of the Type II PIPkins, PIPkin IIbeta has also been suggested to be primarily nuclear, and it may be that a fraction of PIPkin IIalpha is nuclear also [9, 13]. We previously showed that the nuclear localisation of acutely transfected PIPkin IIbeta was absolutely dependent on a novel nuclear localisation sequence [13] consisting of an acidic alpha-helix 16 amino acids long, numbered alpha-helix 7 in the PIPkin IIbeta structure described by Rao et al [14]. We also showed more recently that mutating a single amino acid within that alpha-helix, substituting Met 296 for a Thr, caused a significant, though not complete, shift to a cytoplasmic distribution [15]. A line-up of Type II PIPkins shows that this alpha-helix is highly conserved in vertebrates (Fig 1A) (though interestingly the rat sequence has the same 296 Met-Thr subsitution), with the exception of Zebrafish, where there is an insertion of four extra amino acids. From our earlier work [13] we can infer that in invertebrates (Fig 1) and possibly in Danio, PIPkin IIbeta will not be nuclear, and in rat it will be only partly nuclear [15]. Recently, Gozani et al [16] have presented evidence that transfected PIPkin IIbeta can modulate PtdIns5P-mediated events in the nucleus, and Jones et al have implicated phosphorylation by p38 stress kinase in the regulation of nuclear PIPkin IIbeta [12].

However, set against all this evidence for a nuclear localisation and function for PIPkin IIbeta is the fact that it was first cloned by its apparent interaction with a cell surface receptor - that for TNF-alpha [17]. Moreover, PIPkin IIbeta has subsequently been reported to associate with the EGF receptor [18]. The knock-out mouse for PIPkin IIbeta shows a phenotype of increased insulin sensitivity [19], consistent with the observations from Carricabura et al [20], who showed that increasing PIPkin IIbeta by transfection resulted in decreased PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 production in response to insulin, probably caused by increased PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 degradation. The suggested mechanism was that PtdIns5P is a stimulator of PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 phophatase(s) [20]. All these data together suggest a (perhaps major) cytoplasmic function for PIPkin IIbeta. Finally, in all our transfection experiments, we frequently saw some cytoplasmic PIPkin IIbeta present, even when it was mostly nuclear, and indeed, there were also 5-10% of cells in every transfected dish with very little in the nucleus and the majority in the cytoplasm [13]. Moreover, differences between transfected and endogenous localisations have also been observed with Type I PIPkins (e.g. human Type Ibeta PIPkin [21, 22]).

Thus we are in a position with PIPkin IIbeta, as with many other proteins, that acute transfection may not be giving the full picture of its physiological location and regulation - indeed we actually have no evidence for a nuclear location of the endogenous enzyme. One way round this problem in the absence of a highly isoform-specific antibody is to tag the endogenous protein genetically. This can be done comparatively easily by exploiting the extremely high rate of homologous recombination of DT40 cells [23], as exemplified by the tagging of Hef, a protein component of the Fanconi anemia-related tumor-suppressor complex, by Mosedale et al [24]. Here we describe the generation and characterisation of a DT40 cell that expresses active PIPkin IIbeta tagged at its C-terminus. We use this cell line to show that PIPkin IIbeta is indeed a nuclear enzyme.

DT40 cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 plus glutamine supplemented with 7% (v/v) foetal calf serum, 3% (v/v) heat-treated chicken serum, 1% (v/v) penicillin/streptomycin solution (GIBCO) and 5 mM 2-mercaptoethanol at 37degreesC, 5% CO2. Puromycin was added at a final concentration of 500 ng/ml where appropriate. For transfection, 20 x 106 cells were harvested, washed and resuspended in 600 mul of cold PBS and mixed with 30 mug of linear homologous recombination cassette DNA (for molecular tagging of the type IIbeta PIPkin) and transferred to a chilled electroporation cuvette. Transfection was by the Nucleofector method (Amaxa Biosystems). Cells were placed on ice for 5 min, diluted in DT40 medium and allowed to recover for 24 hrs at 37degreesC, 5% CO2. Potential homologous recombinants were transferred to 96 well plates and selected by the addition of puromycin. Resistant colonies were observed after 9 days and were cultured for further analysis. For GFP studies (acute transfection), 10 mug of plasmid DNA was similarly transfected and cells allowed to recover for 24 hrs at 37degreesC, 5% CO2 in dishes containing DT40 medium and poly-D-lysine coated cover slips. After recovery, cover slips were washed 3 times in sterile PBS and cells fixed for 45 min on ice with 0.1 M NaH2PO4 pH 7.4 containing 4% (v/v) paraformaldehyde. Cover slips were washed in PBS and mounted on microscope slides with 20mul ProLong Gold Antifade reagent (Molecular Probes). Cells expressing GFP-tagged PIPKIN were visualised with a Zeiss Axiovert 100 M confocal microscope.

A summarised depiction of the strategy used is shown in Fig 2. The sequence of Gallus gallus (DT40) genomic DNA was obtained from the ensembl genome browser (). To generate flanking regions of homology required to tag the type II Beta PIPkin, primer pairs designed to facilitate directional cloning were used to PCR amplify regions immediately 5' and 3' of the type II beta PIPkin stop codon (2.2 and 3.6kb respectively), from DT40 genomic DNA using the LA-PCR kit (TAKARA BIO, Japan). The 5' arm was amplified with the forward primer: (5'-CATATCGATGTGTGCAGTTTGTCTCAGTCC-3') and reverse: (5'-TACTCTAGATGTCAGGATATTGGACATAAATTC-3'). The 3' arm was amplified with forward: (5'-CATGGATCCTCATCTCCAGCCTTCAGAGG-3') and reverse: (5'-TACGCGGCCGCAGAGCAAGGAGAATCAGTAGTG-3'). Amplified arms were sub cloned separately into pBluescript SK+ (Stratagene) and confirmed by DNA sequencing. Arms were then individually sub cloned into a pBluescript derivative containing an XbaI-FLAG-(His6)2-STOP sequence immediately followed by a unique BamHI restriction site. A puromycin drug resistance cassette was then cloned into the BamHI site (Fig 2). DNA was prepared by endotoxin free maxi-prep (Qiagen) and linearised prior to transfection. Integration of the tag at the correct genomic location was confirmed by PCR analysis of genomic DNA from transfected, puromycin resistant cells using primers internal [5'-GGAGAGTGAAGCAGAACGTGG-3'] and external [5'-CCTCAGCTCCGACGTTGCCATG-3'] to the site of genetic recombination.

DT40 WT and JPR3 cells (a clone with Type IIbeta PIPkin tagged - see Results) were grown to approximate 2.5 x 106 cells / ml in medium. 400 ml of each culture was harvested and washed in PBS once. Cell pellets were resuspended in 0.813 ml of 1x swell buffer (5 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.4 with 1.5 mM KCl and 2.5 mM MgCl2) in 50 ml tubes. Tubes were placed on ice for exactly 10 mins. 33 mul of cold 33 mM EGTA (pH 7.4) was added and then cells were syringed through a 23-gauge needle ten times. Immediately after syringing, 160 mul of sucrose solution (1.8M sucrose prepared in lysis buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.4 with 1 mM EGTA, 1.5 mM KCl and 5 mM MgCl2)) followed by 2.7 mul of 1 M MgCl2 solution were added.

Samples were layered onto 4 ml of 2.3 M sucrose (prepared in lysis buffer) and spun at 35,000 rpm for 1 hour on a SW55Ti rotor using Beckman Optima L-100 XP Ultracentrifuge. After spinning, a 300 mul volume was collected from the top of the gradient, which we took to be representative of the cytoplasmic fraction. The nuclei (white pellet on the bottom of the centrifuge tube) were resuspended in 1 ml of 0.32 M sucrose in lysis buffer. Nuclei were pelleted, and the absence of contaminating whole cells was confirmed by microscope examination. They were lysed in 75 mul of lysis buffer P1 (containing 1x PBS, 0.1% (v/v) Triton X-100 and 0.5% protease inhibitor cocktail) on ice for 20 mins. Samples of both cytoplasmic and nuclear fractions were taken for SDS PAGE and Western blotting (below) with anti-histone or anti-actin antibodies (to assess purity), and the remainder was used for affinity purification of FLAG-His6 tagged proteins using TALON beads as described below.

Immunoprecipitated proteins were resuspended in 50 mul of 10 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.4 and 100 mul of 2x PIPkin reaction buffer and combined with substrate (60 muM phosphatidylethanolamine, 6 muM phosphatidylinositol-5-phosphate sonicated in 50 mul of 10 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.4 to form micelles). Kinase reactions were initiated by the addition of 5 muCi of g-32P-ATP (New England Nuclear, Boston USA) and incubated at 30degreesC for 2 hrs. Reactions were stopped by addition of 500 mul CHCl3:CH3OH (1:1 v/v) and 125 mul 2.4 N HCl. Folch lipids [25] (20 mul) extracted from porcine brain were added as carrier. Phosphorylated lipids were extracted as described [11] and resolved by thin layer chromatography on silica-coated glass plates (activated by exposure to 50% (v/v) CH3OH, 1% (w/v) potassium oxalate, 2 mM EGTA followed by baking at 110degreesC for 1 hr) in a pre-equilibrated Whatman 3MM paper-lined tank. TLC plates were developed in solvent phase (28:40:10:6 (v/v) CHCl3:CH3OH:H2O:NH4OH) until solvent front reached to the top of the plate. Radioactive lipids were visualised by autoradiography.

The chicken sequence of PIPkin IIbeta is shown in Fig 1B, and reveals that there is an Aspartate instead of Glutamate at residue 300 in the relevant alpha-helical nuclear localisation sequence [11]. This is unlikely to alter the structure of the alpha-helix, as determined by sequence analysis [13, 26], but neverthless we mutated that residue in our GFP-tagged human clone to Aspartate before comparing the localisation of the human PIPkin IIalpha and IIbeta in DT40 cells. As we found previously, they were respectively predominantly cytosolic and nuclear (Fig 3), although the degree to which PIPkin IIbeta is cytosolic is difficult to assess from these images. However, the difference between them is very similar to that observed in HeLa cells [11], confirming that the nuclear transport mechanism that recognises this localisation sequence is functional in acutely transfected DT40 cells.

Fig 2 shows in outline the strategy used in tagging PIPkin IIbeta in DT 40 cells (see Materials and Methods, and ref [24] for more details). In brief, the last 2.6 kbp of the PIPkin IIbeta gene, and the following 3.6 kbp base pairs, were cloned and inserted into a plasmid which placed a FLAG-(His6)2 double-tag, followed by a puromycin selection cassette between them. Transfection of this into DT 40 cells followed by puromycin selection produces cells which have the tag attached to the C-terminus of the protein [24] when expressed by one of the two alleles. All our experiments were conducted on one clonal line derived from this procedure, which we called JPR3.

Successful integration of the tag at the correct genomic location was confirmed by PCR analysis of the corresponding genomic DNA (see Methods), and the expression of the tagged protein was demonstrated by the experiment shown in Fig 4. A Nickel bead pull-down followed by blotting with an anti-FLAG antibody revealed a single clear band (of the correct molecular weight to be PIPkin IIbeta), which was absent in Wild-type cells. To confirm that this is tagged PIPkin IIbeta and is correctly folded, we immunopreciptated it from the tagged cells with anti-FLAG antibody and assayed for PtdIns5P 4-kinase activity, with recombinant Human PIPkins IIalpha and IIbeta as controls. As we have found before, PIPkin IIbeta is much less active than PIPkin IIalpha under these assay conditions (Fig 5), but nevertheless from the 'tagged' cells we were able to immunoprecipitate activity that was significantly above the background from Wild-type cells. In three independent experiments, the ratio ('tagged' cells to Wild-type) of immunoprecipitated enzyme activity, quantified by densitometry or by scintillation counting, was 2.37 +/- 0.27 (this is different from unity with a P < 0.01 by student's t test).

The level of expression of PIPkin IIbeta was too low for immunocytochemistry using either anti-FLAG or anti-His antibodies (we found that DT40 cells had a high background with both sets of antibodies - significantly higher than several mammalian cell lines in comparative experiments). However, we could gain quantitative insight into its localisation by fractionating DT40 cells into nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions, blotting a portion of these with anti-actin and anti-H3 histone as markers for the purity of the fractions, and then quantifying the PIPkin IIbeta content of the remainder by Nickel bead pull-down followed by anti-FLAG blotting, as described above (Fig 4).

We assessed the cytoplasmic contamination of the nuclear fractions by blotting for beta-actin. This is not a perfect marker, as we would expect a small percentage of actin to be truly nuclear (see [1, 27]), but it served to confirm independently our microscopical examinations, which told us that the cells had been lysed and that we had prepared pure nuclei. The predominance of PIPkin IIbeta in the nuclear fraction demonstrates the nuclear localisation of the endogenous enzyme. A key question is: how much of the small amount of PIPkin IIbeta in the cytoplasmic fraction (Fig 5B) can be accounted for by nuclear disintegration or by leakage of PIPkin IIbeta during the factionation? We have used a histone antibody as a marker for this, but there is no perfect marker in this context. Histone H3 has a lower molecular weight than PIPkin IIbeta, so it could be argued to be more likely to leak out than the PIPkin; however, Histone H3 is also integral to chromatin structure whereas PIPkin IIbeta is probably not, and so Histone H3 could be argued to be less likely to leak out. As we do not know to what degree PIPkin IIbeta is freely diffusable in the nucleoplasm, these arguments limit the degree to which we can unambiguously assign a complete nuclear localisation to PIPkin IIbeta, and they also make it pointless to pursue other nuclear markers - each will suffer from similar caveats. However, the data in Fig 6 do enable us to say that within the error limits of our protocol, the endogenous PIPkin IIbeta in these cells is mostly nuclear.

In conclusion, we have shown that genomic tagging of PIPkin IIbeta reinforces our earlier acute transfection studies [13]. The issue of whether there is any cytoplasmic PIPkin IIbeta at all, as some experiments imply (see Introduction), cannot be resolved by our data. But we can support the likely physiological significance of nuclear PIPkin IIbeta and PtdIns5P [11-13, 16], and importantly, our data also confirm the reality and novelty of PIPkinIIbeta's unusual nuclear localisation sequence [13]. Finally, we suggest that this technique may be useful to study other signalling molecules for which transfection or a lack of good antibodies is a hinderence. As well as exploring the true localisation of a protein (as we have done here), this approach enables its physiological interactions with other proteins, or changes in localisation or post-translational modifications to be followed in a clear and unambiguous way.

Wild type cells (left) or PIPkin IIbeta-tagged cells (JPR3) were lysed, and a nickel bead pull-down, imadazole elution and Western blotting with anti-FLAG antibody was performed as described in the Methods section (A). A portion of the lysate from each cell preparation was kept and blotted for actin to control for similar numbers of cells used (B).

Wild type cells (WT) or cells with PIPkin IIbeta tagged with FLAG-(His6)2 (JPR3) were lysed and split into two portions. A One half was immunoprecipiated with anti-FLAG antibody, and the precipiate assayed for PtdIns5P 4-kinase activity, as described in the Methods section. Also assayed were recombinant (human) PIPkin IIalpha and PIPkin IIbeta enzymes (these two at the same protein concentration). The location of the radioactive PtdIns(4,5)P2 spot is indicated with an arrow. Spots were quantified by densitometry or by scraping and scintillation counting. B The other half of each lysate was processed by a nickel bead pull-down, imidazole elution and Western blotting with anti-FLAG, to confirm expression of Type IIbeta PIPkin. The expected position of a 53 kD MW protein (the same as FLAG-(His6)2 tagged PIPkin IIbeta) is indicated by the arrow on Fig 5B.

Wild type (WT) or cells with PIPkin IIbeta tagged with FLAG-(His6)2 (JPR3) were fractionated into cytoplasmic and nuclear fractions as described in the Methods section. A portion of each fraction was Western-blotted for Histone H3 or actin, and the rest was submitted to the standard nickel bead pull-down followed by imidazole elution and Western blotting with anti-FLAG (see Fig 4 and Methods), to quantify the amount of tagged PIPkin IIbeta.
