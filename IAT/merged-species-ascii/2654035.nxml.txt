CD8+ T cells may participate in cigarette smoke (CS) induced-lung inflammation in mice. CXCL10/IP-10 (IFNgamma-inducible protein 10) and CXCL9/Mig (monokine induced by IFN-gamma) are up-regulated in CS-induced lung injury and may attract T-cell recruitment to the lung. These chemokines together with CXCL11/ITAC (IFN-inducible T-cell alpha chemoattractant) are ligands for the chemokine receptor CXCR3 which is preferentially expressed chiefly in activated CD8+ T cells. The purpose of this investigation was to study the contribution of CXCR3 to acute lung inflammation induced by CS using CXCR3 knockout (KO) mice.

Mice (n = 8 per group) were placed in a closed plastic box connected to a smoke generator and were exposed whole body to the tobacco smoke of five cigarettes four times a day for three days. Lung pathological changes, expression of inflammatory mediators in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid and lungs at mRNA and protein levels, and lung infiltration of CD8+ T cells were compared between CXCR3-/- mice and wild type (WT) mice.

Compared with the WT littermates, CXCR3 KO mice showed less CS-induced lung inflammation as evidenced by less infiltration of inflammatory cells in airways and lung tissue, particularly fewer CD8+ T cells, lower levels of IFNgamma and CXCR3 ligands (particularly CXCL10).

Our findings show that CXCR3 is important in promoting CD8+ T cell recruitment and in initiating IFNgamma and CXCL10 release following CS exposure. CXCR3 may represent a promising therapeutic target for acute lung inflammation induced by CS.

Exposure to cigarette smoke (CS) is a major risk factor for the pathogenesis of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) [1]. CS initiates the infiltration of innate and adaptive inflammatory cells into the airways and the lung parenchyma and further destroys the alveolar structure [2-6]. The role of inflammation in the development of COPD is supported by the finding of excess numbers of CD8+ T cells in lung tissues from patients with COPD and an inverse relationship to the lung function [7,8]. CD8+ T cells in epithelium and submucosa expressing CXCR3 were increased in numbers in smokers with COPD as compared with nonsmokers. Excessive CD8+ T cells in the lungs of COPD also produce large amounts of IFNgamma and IFNgamma-induced CXC chemokines, such as CXCL10/interferon-inducible protein-10 (IP-10). CXCL10, a CXCR3 ligand, was abundantly expressed in bronchiolar epithelial cells and airway smooth muscle cells [9,10]. CXCL9/Mig, CXCL10/IP-10, CXCL11/ITAC are chemokines that attract activated T cells through binding to their receptor, CXCR3 [11]. Collectively, these findings suggest that CXCR3/CXCL10 interaction may play a pivotal role in the pathogenesis and progression of COPD through T cell recruitment in airways and lung parenchyma.

A key initiating event in COPD is the recruitment of inflammatory cells into the lung in response to CS exposure [1], which is regulated by a variety of chemokines [9-11]. CXCL9/Mig, CXCL10/IP-10 and CXCL11/ITAC, ligands for CXCR3, and CCL5/RANTES, ligand for CCR5, were shown to be elevated in sputum from COPD patients compared with nonsmokers [12]. Chemokine receptors have been implicated in the pathogenesis of lung inflammation in rodent models exposed to CS. For example, CXCR2 has been demonstrated to be involved in acute pulmonary inflammation induced by CS [13]. In CCR5 gene ablated mice, lung tissue inflammation and apoptosis induced by IFNgamma and CS were also significantly decreased [14,15]. Recent reports demonstrated that CCR6, together with its ligand CXCL20/MIP-3alpha, was involved in CS-induced lung inflammation and that the interaction between CCR6 and CCL20/MIP-3alpha could also mediate accumulation of dendritic cells (DCs) in the lungs of COPD patients [16,17].

In terms of CXCR3, particularly expressed on activated Th1/Tc1 cells [9,10,16-18], we hypothesized that CXCR3 gene deficiency would terminate or at least attenuate CS-induced pulmonary inflammation and tissue damage. To address this hypothesis, we used CXCR3 KO mice and their WT littermates to investigate the contribution of CXCR3 in CS-induced lung injury process.

A commercially-available filter cigarette was used (White Shark brand, Tobacco Company, China), and according to manufacturer's specification, each cigarette contained 1 mg of nicotine and 13 mg of tar. CS exposure was performed according to previously-described methods [13,15,16]. Briefly, mice were placed in a closed plastic box connected to smoke generator. The mice (n = 8 per group) were exposed whole body to the tobacco smoke of five cigarettes four times a day with 30-minute smoke free interval for three consecutive days. Control mice were received filtered air according to the same procedure. Animals were killed on the fourth day after CS exposure by pentobarbital overdose.

Mice were sacrificed, and the trachea was cannulated by using a 20-gauge catheter. BAL was performed twice with 0.8 ml of ice-cold PBS (pH 7.4) each. 1.5 ml of total injected volume was recovered in >95% of mice. The BAL fluid was spun at 1500 rpm for 5 min at 4degreesC, and supernatant was collected for the measurement of cytokines and total protein. The pelleted cells were harvested, and red cells were lysed, then the pelleted cells were washed and resuspended in cold PBS. Total cells were enumerated by counting on a hemocytometer. For differential cell counting, cells were spun onto glass slides, air-dried, fixed in ethanol, and stained with Diff-Quick reagents (Baxter Scientific, Miami, FL). The number of macrophages, neutrophils and lymphocytes in 400 cells was counted based on morphology.

To determine whether CXCR3 deficiency affects the CS-induced infiltration of inflammatory cells into airways and parenchyma, we estimated the cell subpopulations in BAL fluid and lung tissue following CS exposure. There was significantly less infiltration of inflammatory cells into airways in CXCR3 KO mice compared with WT mice, except for macrophages (figure 1A). Consistently, the numbers of total inflammatory cells and differential subpopulations harvested from lung parenchyma were significantly decreased in CXCR3 KO mice group than in WT mice (figure 1B).

The percentage of CD8+ T cells in both BAL fluid and lung tissue from CXCR3 KO mice was decreased compared to that from WT mice after CS exposure (BALF: 1.4 +/- 0.1% vs 5.4 +/- 0.4, p < 0.0001; Lung tissue: 7.9 +/- 0.9% vs 18.9 +/- 0.5%, p < 0.0001) (figure 4A and 4B). The percentage of CD4+ T cells was similar in both BALF and lungs from WT and CXCR3 KO mice (figure 4A and 4B). In the mice exposed to air, CD4+T and CD8+ T cells were undetectable by FACS analysis (data not shown). These data demonstrate that CXCR3 may be responsible for the initiation of CS-induced inflammation through recruitment of CD8+ T cells, as well as CD4+ T cells, into the airways and lung parenchyma.

Upon activation, CD8+ T cells caused cytolysis and apoptosis of alveolar epithelial cells through the release of its effector molecules, including granzymes and perforin [20]. Although mRNA expression for granzymes A, B and perforin was induced in both groups after CS exposure, they were significantly reduced in CXCR3 KO mice as compared with WT mice (figure 7A-C).

In this study, we have demonstrated that deletion of CXCR3 gene in mice significantly prevented the lung inflammation induced by exposure to CS. CXCR3 may be a key factor in CS-induced pulmonary injury by regulating the recruitment of CD8+ T cells as well as other inflammatory cells such as neutrophils and macrophages and by initiating the production of IFNgamma, IFNgamma-target CXCL10, and the expression of effector molecules from CD8+ T cells.

The local inflammatory response in CS-induced lung injury is associated with infiltration of leukocytes, which is regulated by the members of CXC family [11]. Consistent with previous reports of murine model induced by acute CS exposure [6,13,21], neutrophils represented the majority of cells (~50% of the leukocytes in BAL fluid and lung tissue) in this study. Neutrophilic inflammation is a key factor in the pathogenesis of COPD, and neutrophil infiltration has been shown to be essential for the subsequent recruitment of CD8+ T cells to sites of inflammation [22]. In CS-exposed CXCR3 KO mice, we observed significant reduction in the severity of lung inflammation as evidenced by fewer inflammatory cells in airways and lung tissue and lesser protein leakage into the airway. These observations point to an important role for CXCR3 in the pathogenesis of CS-induced pulmonary inflammation. However, it should be pointed out that CXCR3 KO mice showed partial protection from CS-induced pulmonary inflammation in this study. We have come to realize that CS-induced pulmonary inflammation is not caused by a single chemokine receptor but that multiple chemokine receptors expressed on inflammatory and immune cells are involved [13-16]. Further studies should be done to determine how they interact in a complex network to contribute the pulmonary inflammation caused by CS.

Th1 type cells preferentially express CXCR3 and CCR5, and the infiltrating T cells in COPD express high levels of CXCR3 and CCR5, but not of CCR4 and CCR8 that are preferentially expressed by Th2 cells [2,11,12]. Numerous investigations performed both in vivo and in vitro have consistently found CXCR3 to be associated with Th1/Tc1 responses [2,11,18,23]. In accordance with these findings, we demonstrated that less CD8+ T cells infiltrated into airways and lungs of CXCR3 KO mice. In mice where CD8+ T cells have been deleted, there is resistance to the development of COPD [20]. The explanation for the relative difference in CD8+ T cells between CXCR3 KO and WT mice in this model may in part be due to the downstream effect of CXCR3 activation. Moreover, CD8+ T cells damage the lung interstitium through the release of lytic substances such granzyme A, granzyme B, and perforin [20,24-26]. In support of this notion, we demonstrated that the expression of these enzymes, to some extent, was upregulated in WT mice upon CS exposure. However, the upregulation was inhibited in CS-exposed CXCR3 KO mice. This phenomenon can be attributed to the abrogation of CD8+ T cells in the inflamed lungs from CXCR3 KO mice, which led to the decreased expression of these effector molecules.

The inflammatory response in CS-induced pulmonary damage is characterized by an increased number of Th1 cells, that secrete the Th1-type cytokine, IFNgamma [27]. IFNgamma expression in BALF and lung homogenates at both mRNA and protein levels was increased after CS exposure either in CXCR3 KO or WT mice, but in CXCR3 KO mice, such increase was blunted. We also demonstrated that CXCR3 ligands were significantly elevated at the transcriptional level required for IFNgamma in CS-exposed WT mice. Notably, there was less CXCL10 in both BALF and lung homogenates in CXCR3 KO mice. This can be explained by the negative feedback effect of CXCR3 deletion, in which the reduced accumulation of inflammatory cells in airways and pulmonary parenchyma leads to a diminished release of inflammatory mediators such as IFNgamma; more importantly, this leads to inhibition of the activation of airway epithelial cells to produce CXCL10 and decrease in the recruitment of CXCR3 bearing CD8+ T cells [18].

To our knowledge, this study is the first to specifically focus on the importance of CXCR3 in CS-induced lung inflammation by using CXCR3 KO mice. In conclusion, our study shows that CXCR3 regulates CS-induced lung inflammation via recruitment of CD8+ T cells into the lung to trigger the inflammatory response cascade with over-expression of IFNgamma and chemokines that activate CXCR3 ligands, particularly CXCL10. Our findings may provide a therapeutic target for treating CS-induced pulmonary injury.
