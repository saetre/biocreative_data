The in vitro replication of R1 miniplasmid promoted by purified preparations of the plasmid encoded RepA protein in cell extracts of E. coli is resistant to rifampicin and can be completely inhibited by antibodies against DnaG, the primase of the cell, as well as by antibodies against proteins DnaB and SSB. R1 replication is abolished in extracts deficient in the DnaA protein. This deficiency is efficiently complemented by purified preparations of the DnaA protein. The in vitro replication of plasmid R1 is also abolished in DnaC deficient extracts and by a 10 bp deletion (nucleotides 1463-1472) within the minimal origin region. These data indicate the requirement of the DnaA, DnaB, DnaC, DnaG and SSB replication proteins of the host, as well as of specific oriR1 sequences for the RepA dependent replication of plasmid R1. The implications of these results for the initiation of R1 replication are discussed.
