The uninducible murine interferon alpha 11 gene (Mu IFN-alpha 11) shows strong homology with the highly inducible Mu IFN-alpha 4 gene in the promoter region. Negative regulatory sequences located between positions -470 and -145 were characterized in the Mu IFN-alpha 11 promoter. The removal of these sequences leads to virus-inducibility of Mu IFN-alpha 11 while their insertion in Mu IFN-alpha 4 corresponding region significantly reduced the inducibility of Mu IFN-alpha 4 promoter. On the other hand, the virus-responsive element (VRE) of the Mu IFN-alpha 11 differs by a single nucleotide substitution at position -78 from the VRE alpha 4. Constructions carrying either VRE alpha 11 or VRE alpha 4 upstream a heterologous promoter displayed different virus inducibilities. The -78 A/G substitution affects the inducibility by decreasing the affinity of VRE-binding trans-regulators. Our results suggest that the combined effect of the negative regulatory sequences and of the mutation in the VRE alpha 11, completely silences the Mu IFN-alpha 11 gene.
