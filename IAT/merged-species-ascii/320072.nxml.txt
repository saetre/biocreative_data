The complete nucleotide sequence of argF is presented, together with that of an operator-constitutive mutant. ArgF is compared with the other gene coding for ornithine carbamoyltransferase (OTCase) in E. coli K-12, argI, and with pyrB, encoding the catalytic monomer of aspartate carbamoyltransferase (ATCase). ArgF and argI appear very closely related having emerged from a relatively recent ancestor gene. The relationship between OTCase and ATCase appears more distant. Nevertheless, the homology observed between the two proteins (mainly in the polar domain) suggests a common origin.
