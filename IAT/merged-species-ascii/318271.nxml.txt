Mouse major urinary proteins (MUPs) are encoded by a family of ca. 35 genes that are expressed in a tissue-specific manner in several secretory organs; in the liver, in the submaxillary, sublingual, parotid and lachrymal glands, and in the skin sebaceous glands. In this paper we describe the isolation of a Mup gene, Mup-1.5a, which is expressed predominantly in the submaxillary gland of BALB/c mice. We show that Mup-1.5a is a member of a subfamily consisting of two closely related genes, both of which are closely linked to the Mup-1 locus on mouse chromosome 4. Mup-1 is the locus of a class of Mup genes (Group 1) expressed in the liver. The complete nucleotide sequence of Mup-1.5a has been determined, and was compared to a previously sequenced Group 1 Mup gene. The comparison shows that the differentially expressed Mup genes are uniformly divergent in exons, introns and in their flanking sequences. The regions of homology extend at least 5 kb into the 5' flanking region of Mup genes.
