The recR gene of Escherichia coli, which is associated with recBC-independent mechanisms of recombination and DNA repair, has been located between dnaZX and htpG on a 6.4 kb EcoRI fragment of DNA that has been cloned and analysed in lambda and plasmid vectors. Nucleotide sequencing of this interval revealed two open reading frames that constitute an operon lying immediately downstream of dnaZX. The second of these two reading frames was identified as recR. It encodes a polypeptide with a predicted molecular weight of 21,965 Daltons that migrates on SDS gels as a 26 kDa protein. The first gene of the operon encodes a polypeptide of 12,015 daltons. Its function is not known.
