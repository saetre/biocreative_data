Purified UvrA, UvrB, UvrC, UvrD, PolA and Lig proteins from Escherichia coli have been used to assess the effect of nucleotide excision repair on the conformation of native negatively supercoiled plasmid DNA in an in vitro test system. The analysis of labeled reaction products on specific gel systems suggests that the Uvr excinuclease has the ability to restrain the superhelical stress in the template DNA during the repair process. This feature, observed in the case of the Uvr system is not found if the repair reaction is initiated by T4 endonuclease V or Micrococcus luteus UV endonuclease.
