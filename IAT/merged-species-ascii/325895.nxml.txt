We have constructed deletion and point mutations within the Simian virus 40 (SV40) early promoter region which contains two tandemly repeated 21 bp sequences and a related 22 bp sequence (the "upstream" 21 bp repeat region). After transfection into permissive CV-1 cells and non-permissive mouse 3T3-4E cells, the effect of the mutations on early gene expression was studied by measuring T-antigen production, using indirect immunofluoresence. Our results demonstrate that the 21 bp repeat region, and in particular the six GC-rich motifs 5'-CCGCCC-3' which are repeated in this region constitute an important element of the SV40 early promoter. Surprisingly, we found that the requirement for the 21 bp repeat region for early gene expression was partially fulfilled even when it was in the inverted orientation.
