The homeodomain (HD) is a ubiquitous protein fold that confers DNA binding function on a superfamily of eukaryotic gene regulatory proteins. Here, the DNA binding of recognition helix variants of the HD from the engrailed gene of Drosophila melanogaster was investigated by phage display. Nineteen different combinations of pairwise mutations at positions 50 and 54 were screened against a panel of four DNA sequences consisting of the engrailed consensus, a non-specific DNA control based on the lambda repressor operator OR1 and two model sequence targets con-taining imperfect versions of the 5'-TAAT-3' consensus. The resulting mutant proteins could be divided into four groups that varied with respect to their affinity for DNA and specificity for the engrailed consensus. The altered specificity phenotypes of several mutant proteins were confirmed by DNA mobility shift analysis. Lys50/Ala54 was the only mutant protein that exhibited preferential binding to a sequence other than the engrailed consensus. Arginine was also demonstrated to be a functional replacement for Ala54. The functional combinations at 50 and 54 identified by these experiments recapitulate the distribution of naturally occurring HD sequences and illustrate how the engrailed HD can be used as a framework to explore covariation among DNA binding residues.
