In cancer patients, MUC1 glycoprotein may carry Lewis y which could be involved in immune response. Purposes: 1- to evaluate the presence of Lewis y and MUC1 in circulating immune complexes (Lewis y/CIC and MUC1/CIC, respectively) and their correlation; 2- to analyze the possible presence of Lewis y in carbohydrate chains of tumoral MUC1 glycoprotein and 3- to correlate serum and tissue parameters considered.

Pretreatment serum and tissue breast samples from 76 adenocarcinoma, 34 benign and 36 normal specimens were analyzed. Anti-MUC1 and anti-Lewis y MAbs were employed. To detect Lewis y/CIC and MUC1/CIC, ELISA tests were developed; serum samples containing MUC1 were previously selected by Cancer Associated Serum Antigen (CASA). Immunoprecipitation (IP) was performed in 9 malignant, benign and normal samples and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blot. Lewis y and MUC1 expression was studied by immunohistochemistry (IHC). Statistical analysis was performed employing principal component analysis (PCA), ANOVA, Tukey HSD, Chi square test and classical correlation (p < 0.05).

###begin p 7
By ELISA, Lewis y/IgM/CIC levels showed statistically significant differences between breast cancer versus benign and normal samples; mean +/- SD values expressed in OD units were: 0.525 +/- 0.304; 0.968 +/- 0.482 and 0.928 +/- 0.447, for breast cancer, benign disease and normal samples, respectively, p < 0.05. Lewis y/IgG/CIC did not show any statistically significant difference. MUC1/IgM/CIC correlated with Lewis y/IgM/CIC. By CASA, 9 samples with MUC1 values above the cut off were selected and IP was performed, followed by SDS-PAGE and Western blot; bands at 200 kDa were obtained with each MAb in all the samples. By IHC, with C14 MAb, 47.5%, 31% and 35% of malignant, benign and normal samples, respectively, showed positive reaction while all the samples were positive with anti-MUC1 MAb; in both cases, with a different pattern of expression between malignant and non malignant samples.

Conclusion
###end title 8
###begin p 9
Our findings support that in breast cancer there was a limited humoral immune response through Lewis y/IgM/CIC levels detection which correlated with MUC1/IgM/CIC. We also found that Lewis y might be part of circulating MUC1 glycoform structure and also that Lewis y/CIC did not correlate with Lewis y expression.

Worldwide, breast cancer is the most common cause of mortality by cancer in female population (GLOBOCAN, 2002, IARC). In order to decrease mortality and to improve treatment, prevention and early detection biomarkers are object of study. In this sense, it is very important to increase knowledge about tumor biology, which includes studies on risk factors, tumor development, dissemination and metastasis.

There is sufficient evidence that blood group related Lewis antigens are tumor-associated molecules [1]. Changes in the structure of glycan chains covalently attached to glycoproteins and glycolipids are a common feature of progression to malignancy [2]. In O-linked glycosylation, the glycans are added to serine and threonine hydroxyl groups. Initiation of O-glycosylation in the mammary gland begins in the Golgi apparatus, is catalysed by a family of enzymes which transfer N-acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc) from UDP-GalNAc (UDP-GalNAc polypeptide glycosyltransferases) to selected serine or threonine residues in protein chain [3]. After the addition of GalNAc, various core structures are formed by the addition of different sugars. The terminal epitopes of the O-glycans on mucins are probably the most important determining whether the molecule plays a role in cell adhesion phenomena. The epitopes recognized by antibodies related to the ABO and Lewis blood group antigens are found in this region. Terminal sugars added in alpha linkage include sialic acid, fucose, galactose, GalNAc and N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc). Some sulphation of sugars in terminal structures may also occur [4].

Lewis y and Lewis b antigens are over-expressed by breast, lung, colon, pancreas, prostate and ovarian cancers, either at the plasma membrane as a glycolipid or linked to surface receptors such as Erb-B family receptors [1]. Sialyl-Lewis x and sialyl-Lewis a are complex carbohydrates which have been also found in breast carcinomas [6].

Breast cancer cell glycans changes are related to glycoprotein antigenic differences between carcinoma and normal mammary gland cells [7]. This phenomenon has been extensively studied on MUC1 mucin where the aberrant glycosylation found in tumor cells indicates the appearance of novel glycan epitopes (e.g. STn) as well as the unmasking of peptide sequences (rev. in [4]). Lewis y oligosaccharides may be part of mucin glycoproteins, which have characteristic core peptide structures [8]. MUC1, which is overexpressed in breast cancer, may contain Lewis y. This mucin has been involved in immune regulation, cell signaling, inhibition of cell-cell and cell-matrix adhesion [9]. Glycan changes may be important to the induction of a humoral response [10]. Cell-surface antigens (mainly carbohydrate antigens) have proved to be unexpectedly potent targets for immune recognition and attack against human cancers [11].

In tumor patients sera, it has been frequently found the occurrence of variation in circulating immune complexes' (CIC) levels [13-16]. Although the overall composition of CIC varies quantitatively even for patients with the same malignancy, MUC1 has been described as a part of CIC associated with cancer including breast carcinoma [13,16,17]. It has been postulated that CIC may play a protective [15] as well as an impaired [14,18,19] function.

Lewis y/CIC levels were measured by an ELISA method employing C14 MAb. One hundred mul of 1/100 C14 MAb diluted in buffer carbonate/bicarbonate pH 9.6 were adsorbed in each well of 96 wells ELISA microplates (Falcon 3912, Microtest III, Becton Dickinson Labware, Oxnard, USA). After overnight incubation at 4degreesC, several washes with sodium phosphate buffer/0.1% Tween 20 (PBST) were done. In each well, 200 mul of blocking buffer (1%BSA/PBS) were added and plates were incubated at 37degreesC for 3 h. One hundred mul of 1/20 serum samples diluted in PBS were applied by triplicate and incubated overnight at 4degreesC with the absorbed MAb. Then, plates were washed with PBST and 1% Triton X-100/PBS; after that, 1/2000 anti-human IgM or 1/3000 anti-human IgG horseradish peroxidase conjugates (Dakopatts, Dako Corporation, Copenhagen, Denmark) were added and incubated at 4degreesC for 2 h.

Sections were examined by light microscopy and the antibody staining patterns were scored in a semiquantitative manner. Staining intensity was graded as negative (-), low (+), moderate (++), or strong (+++). The number of optical fields in a specimen that were positively stained was expressed as a percentage of the total number of optical fields containing tissue. The staining of cytoplasm, plasma membrane and nucleus was evaluated; cells were considered positive when at least one of these components was stained. The pattern of reaction was classified as linear (membrane reaction), cytoplasmic, or mixed (cytoplasmic and membrane) and the positive reaction in gland lumen content was identified as cellular debris or secretion.

In order to isolate MUC1 from sera, pellets obtained by IP using HMFG1 MAb were treated with lysis and Laemmli's buffer. All samples and supernatants obtained were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and WB. Blotting sheets were incubated with C14 MAb and HMFG1 MAb; the latter was employed to validate IP results. With each MAb, bands at 200 kDa were identified in all selected samples indicating that MUC1 should contain Lewis y carbohydrate in its structure. Fig. 2A and 2B show the band obtained from a normal, a benign and a breast cancer sample when the membranes were incubated with HMFG1 and C14, respectively.

Although there was any statistical difference, the pattern of expression differed between malignant and non malignant samples. In cancer specimens, a mixed pattern (cytoplasmic and membrane) with non apical reactivity was more frequently detected at different stages (Fig. 3A-D) compared with the apical membrane pattern found in benign (Fig. 3E) as well as in normal samples (Fig. 3F). In malignant specimens, variation of Lewis y expression was a common feature. In several tumors, diffuse and moderate or intense staining was mainly restricted to non apical cytoplasm; some samples showed a cytoplasmic reaction with a strong intensity and a granular pattern. Other specimens had a strong reaction limited to the apical part of the cells (cytoplasm and membrane) in lining glands and also in lumen content. In some tumor sections, an intense staining at the apical blebs was found. No nuclear staining was observed. Fig. 3G shows a normal sample which did not react with C14 MAb.

It has been proved that MUC1 is extremely useful for glycosylation studies because changes in the expression and activity of specific glycosyltransferases have been related to changes in the O-glycan structures expressed by MUC1 [4]. In a previous report we found that Lewis x antigen was highly expressed by normal epithelial tissues of mammary gland and digestive tract [24]. In order to continue the study of blood group related Lewis antigen involvement in breast cancer, we have focused this research on the difucosylated Lewis y antigen; this carbohydrate specifically belongs to the ABH Lewis blood group family which is overexpressed on the majority of carcinomas including ovary, pancreas, prostate, breast, colon and non small cell lung cancers [25-27].

We performed immunoprecipitation of MUC1 from breast cancer, benign and normal serum samples with HMFG1 MAb, directed against MUC1 peptide core (DTR) and isolated the glycoprotein. SDS-PAGE and Western blot assays were performed with the samples obtained by IP; nitrocellulose membrane incubation with C14 MAb showed the same MW band as incubation with HMFG1 MAb in breast cancer, benign and normal samples. These results indicate that Lewis y could be involved in MUC1 structure. Sikut et al. found that sialyl Lewis a and sialyl Lewis x epitopes were attached to MUC1 in breast cancer patients serum samples [28].

In the last decades, further information was achieved; in breast cancer cell lines, Hellstrom et al. probed that MAbs reactive against Lewis y could be internalized and mediated tumor cell killing by antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) and complement dependent cytotoxicity (CDC) [30]. Furthermore, sialylated Lewis a and Lewis y were related with apoptosis; in this sense, Rapoport and Le Pendu found in colon carcinoma cell lines such as HT29 in which apoptosis was induced by UV irradiation, TNFalpha and anti-Fas, a major decrease of this antigen as well as Lewis x [31]. On the other hand, in Jurkat human T cell line, the expression of Lewis x and Lewis y was enhanced in the cell surface during apoptosis induced by different agents including anti-Fas antibody [32].

Lewis y is attached to components of the CD66 cluster which is a member of the carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) family and of the immunoglobulin superfamily. The activation-increase in Lewis y attached to CD66 adhesion molecules implicates a role of the Lewis y determinant in cytoadhesive properties of granulocytes on trafficking and inflammatory responses [5,33].

Cancer antigens expressed at the cell surface are generally glycolipids or glycoproteins [12,38] which may express in their molecules blood group related Lewis antigens [2]. The non appropriate biosynthesis or processing of carbohydrate structures may contribute to the disordered behaviour of tumor cells [39]. Lewis y carbohydrate may participate in natural humoral immune response; antibodies are ideally suited for eradicating pathogens from bloodstream and early tissue invasion. With regard to cancer cells, passively administered and vaccine induced antibodies have accomplished this concept, limiting tumor cells and systemic or intraperitoneal micrometastases in a variety of preclinical models [12]. Many protocols developing anti-Lewis y vaccines have been performed [12,40,41].

In this report, we found that Lewis y/IgM/CIC levels correlated with Lewis y/IgG/CIC levels and MUC1/CIC (IgG and IgM) levels and also that Lewis y/IgG/CIC levels correlated with MUC1/IgG/CIC levels. These correlations may be related with the fact that MUC1 may be a carrier of Lewis y epitope. Von Mensdorff-Pouilly et al [42] found that naturally occurring MUC1 antibodies seem to check disease spread in breast cancer patients, possibly by destroying blood-borne isolated disseminated tumor cells (micrometastases) which eventually could lead to metastatic disease and death. Silk et al found significantly higher anti-MUC1 IgG levels in abnormal versus normal colorectal location [43].

Correlation of antibodies, naturally acquired or vaccine-induced, with improved prognosis in a variety of different clinical settings is one of the bases for cancer vaccines designed for antibody induction. It is essential to ensure that immune responses against tumor antigens can destroy tumor cells but not normal ones. An important immune response against a tumor specific antigen would be irrelevant if a tumor cell mutates in such a way that it no longer expressed its specific antigen avoiding cells destruction by the immune system [44]. Therefore, it is remarkably outstanding to study the natural humoral immune response through immune complexes detection. With the aim of enhancing immune response in breast cancer patients, vaccines constructed with glycolipids or glycoproteins derivatives as immunogens are being developed.

By IHC, tumor and tissue Lewis y and MUC1 expression was evaluated; although we did not find any statistically significant difference among malignant, benign and normal samples, the pattern of expression differed.

Our findings also support that, in breast cancer, Lewis y may be part of circulating MUC1 glycoform structure and that Lewis y/CIC do not correlate with Lewis y expression. This lack of correlation may be related to a limited humoral immune response against these molecules in cancer patients which could be due to the escape from the immunosurveillance of the host.
