DNA complementary to calf stomach mRNA has been synthesised and inserted into the Pst1 site of pAT153 by G-C tailing. Clones containing sequences coding for prochymosin were recognised by colony hybridisation with cDNA extended from a chemically synthesised oligodeoxynucleotide primer, the sequence of which was predicted from the published amino acid sequence of calf prochymosin. Two clones were identified which together contained a complete copy of prochymosin mRNA. The nucleotide sequence is in substantial agreement with the reported amino acid sequence of prochymosin and shows that this protein has a mol.wt. of 40431 and chymosin a mol.wt. of 35612. The sequence also indicates that prochymosin is synthesised as a precursor molecule, preprochymosin, having a 16 amino acid hydrophobic leader sequence analogous to that reported for other secreted proteins.
