We show here that under physiologically reasonable conditions, CGG repeats in RNA readily form hairpins. In contrast to its DNA counterpart that forms a complex mixture of hairpins and tetraplexes, r(CGG)22 forms a single stable hairpin with no evidence for any other folded structure even at low pH. RNA with the sequence (CGG)9AGG (CGG)12AGG(CGG)97, found in a fragile X syndrome pre-mutation allele, forms a number of different hairpins. The most prominent hairpin forms in the 3' part of the repeat and involves the 97 uninterrupted CGG repeats. In contrast to the CUG-RNA hairpins formed by myotonic dystrophy type 1 repeats, we found no evidence that CGG-RNA hairpins activate PKR, the interferon-inducible protein kinase that is activated by a wide range of double-stranded RNAs. However, we do show that the CGG-RNA is digested, albeit inefficiently, by the human Dicer enzyme, a step central to the RNA interference effect on gene expression. These data provide clues to the basis of the toxic effect of CGG-RNA that is thought to occur in fragile X pre-mutation carriers. In addition, RNA hairpins may also account for the stalling of the 40S ribosomal subunit that is thought to contribute to the translation deficit in fragile X pre-mutation and full mutation alleles.

Fragile X mental retardation syndrome (FXS) is caused by the expansion of a CGG.CCG repeat tract in the 5'-untranslated region (5' UTR) of the FMR1 gene (1,2). This expansion occurs from a pre-mutation allele containing 55-200 repeats to one that has a much larger number of repeats. In addition to the risk of having a child with a full mutation allele, female carriers of pre-mutation alleles have elevated levels of premature ovarian failure (3,4). A high incidence of cerebellar degeneration is also seen in both female and male carriers (5). These symptoms are thought to reflect some property of the transcript from pre-mutation alleles rather than insufficiency of the protein product of the FMR1 gene.

A number of other repeat expansion diseases are known where the repeat-containing RNA has been implicated in disease pathology. The best characterized of these is myotonic dystrophy (DM) type 1 which is caused by expansion of a CTG.CAG tract in the 3' UTR of the myotonic dystrophy protein kinase gene, DMPK [for recent review see Ranum and Day (6)]. Both CTG repeats and, more recently, their RNA counterparts the CUG repeats, have been shown to form hairpins (7,8). DM RNA hairpins have been suggested to cause pathology in a variety of ways including via activation of enzymes such as the interferon-inducible protein kinase PKR that leads to inhibition of translation and ultimately to apoptosis (9).

While the DNA structure of long FXS pre-mutation alleles has not been described, DNAs with CGG repeat numbers in the normal range are known to form a complex mixture of folded structures including hairpins (10,11) and tetraplexes (12-16). We reasoned that RNA with a large number of CGG repeats might form a similar array of structures that, as is the case in DM1, may have consequences for disease pathology. We describe here our analysis of the structures formed by RNA corresponding to a normal allele, as well as a long FXS pre-mutation allele with an AGG interspersion pattern commonly seen in humans. We also describe the effect of these structures on PKR and Dicer, two enzymes that can have significant effects on gene expression and that are sensitive to RNA with double-stranded character. We discuss the implications of our findings for FXS and pre-mutation carrier symptoms.

The HEK293-derived cell lines expressing 0, 22 and 176 transcribed but untranslated CGG.CCG repeats from the same doxycycline-regulatable promoter in the same chromosomal locus will be described in detail elsewhere (V.Handa, D.Goldwater, T.Saha and K.Usdin, in preparation). Briefly, the cell lines were generated using the Flp-In T-Rex system (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) in which the repeats were inserted downstream of a CMV-TetO hybrid promoter in a plasmid containing an FRT site [pcDNA5/FRT/TO (Invitrogen)]. Flp recombinase-mediated plasmid integration was carried out by co-transfection of the repeat-containing plasmid together with a non-replicating plasmid encoding the Flp recombinase into a cell line containing an integrated FRT site as recommended by the supplier. The PKR expression plasmid, pEGST.PKR/lambdaPP, which expresses both a GST.PKR fusion protein and the bacteriophage lambda protein phosphatase was a gift of Dr Takayasu Date [Kanazawa Medical University, Japan (17)]. Clones containing 22 repeats of either CGG.CCG, CAG.CTG or ATT.TTA were generated as previously described using the plasmid pREX+ which contains a T7 promoter sequence upstream of the repeats (18). To reduce the amount of non-repeat sequence that would be generated by transcription from these templates, we deleted the region between the BglII and SpeI sites in the vector. A T7 RNA polymerase template containing the sequence (CGG)9AGG(CGG)12AGG(CGG)97 was generated by PCR amplification of a large human pre-mutation allele that we had previously inserted into transgenic mice (19). The forward primer used was T7CGG-F (5'-GCATGAATTCTAATACGACTCACTATAGGGAGGGCGTGCGGCAGCG-3'), which contains a T7 promoter, and the reverse primer T7CGG-R (5'-TTTTggatccGCTGCGGG CGCTCGAGGCCCAG-3'). The PCR fragment was digested with BamHI and cloned into SmaI- and BglII-digested pGL3-Basic (Promega, Madison, WI).

Synthesis of RNA with 22 repeats was carried out using plasmid templates. These templates were linearized with a restriction enzyme with a recognition site immediately downstream of the repeats. The generation of a long pre-mutation FXS allele has been previously described (19). This allele contains the following sequence (CGG)9AGG (CGG)12AGG(CGG)97. Templates containing this allele were prepared by PCR from a plasmid in which the repeats were stable, using a primer pair one of which had a T7 promoter site. The templates were then phenol extracted, ethanol precipitated and resuspended in TE buffer. Transcription was carried out using the Megashortscript Kit (Ambion, Austin, TX). For T1 and S1 mapping, 20 microCi of [gamma-32P]GTP (ICN, Irvine, CA) was added to each reaction, and the mixture incubated at 37degreesC for 2 h. For the Dicer reaction, transcription was carried out using a mixture of all four [alpha-32P]NTPs (ICN). The reactions were terminated by addition of formamide-EDTA solution (96% formamide, 2 mM EDTA) and the RNA precipitated with 3 vol of ethanol. The RNA was then resuspended in gel loading buffer (formamide-EDTA solution, 0.025% bromophenol blue, 0.025% xylene cyanol) and subjected to electrophoresis on a polyacrylamide gel containing 7 M urea. The full-length RNA was excised from the gel, extracted by incubation in formamide-EDTA solution overnight at 37degreesC, extracted with phenol:chloroform:isoamylalcohol and then ethanol precipitated.

Dicer. Digestion with recombinant human Dicer (Gene Therapy Systems, San Diego, CA) was carried out in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions using a buffer containing 250 mM NaCl, 30 mM HEPES pH 8.0, 0.05 mM EDTA, 2.5 mM MgCl2. ATP was added to a final concentration of 1 mM and digestion was carried out for 17 h at 37degreesC. The same mass of RNA was used for each reaction. Samples containing the same amount of radiolabeled product were loaded on each gel. Gel images were obtained using Fujifilm type BAS-III phosphoimager screens and a Fujifilm BAS 15000 reader. Analysis and quantification was performed with Sciencelab Image Gauge 3.0 (Mac) software. The relative amount of Dicer product produced from the CGG-RNA substrate was determined both by comparing the amount of this product relative to the amount of full-length material and by comparison with the amount of reaction product produced using the bona fide double-stranded RNA substrate.

RNA containing 22 CGG repeats produced a very simple pattern of T1 and S1 cleavage, with a single region of cleavage located in the middle of the repeat tract (Fig. 1). In contrast, RNA containing the sequence (CGG)9AGG (CGG)12AG G(CGG)97 produced a complex mixture of bands when treated with T1 nuclease at neutral pH or S1 nuclease at low pH (Fig. 1). The pattern of cleavage of (CGG)22 is consistent with formation of a single hairpin, while the pattern of cleavage of the longer repeat suggests that more than one structure is formed. All reactions using the longer RNA produced somewhat similar amounts of cleavage products approximately265, approximately232, approximately85 and approximately47 bases long. Products of approximately213 and approximately200 nucleotides were also seen in all reactions but the amount of this material differed depending on the reaction conditions. In addition to these products, a fragment of approximately158 bases is seen in S1 reactions and to a much lesser degree in T1 reactions carried out in the presence of K+ (Fig. 1).

T1 reactions carried out in the presence of K+ produce significant amounts of the approximately47, approximately85 and approximately232 cleavage products and less of those fragments resulting from cleavage at position approximately265. One of the most stable structures generated by computer analysis of the repeat region using the Mulfold algorithm of Zuker (20) without any base pairing constraints was one containing three hairpins with loops at approximately47, approximately85 and approximately232 that had a DeltaG of -267.3 [Fig. 2(ii)]. Applying the constraint that bases 264-266 had to be unpaired resulted in the generation of a variety of structures, the most stable of which is the structure shown in Figure 2(iii). This structure which is comprised of two hairpins with loops at approximately85 and approximately265 bases has a DeltaG of -263.9. Alternative structures containing bases approximately213 or approximately200 in the loops as shown in Fig. 2(iv) and (v) had DeltaGs of -248.4 and -263.5, respectively. These data suggest that the most likely conformation for the (CGG)9AGG(CGG)12AGG(CGG)97 RNA is the one that is comprised of three smaller hairpins shown in Figure 2(ii). The stability of the largest of these three hairpins is -226.7, which is significantly lower than the DeltaG for the hairpin containing all the bases in the repeat tract (-263.5), and the DeltaG for a single hairpin formed by the uninterrupted repeat (-279.5). These data illustrate the different ways that the AGG interruptions may reduce the effect of long CGG tracts in RNA: they not only prevent the formation of a more stable single hairpin lacking any mismatches, but they also favor the formation of a series of smaller and less stable hairpins, over a single more stable hairpin with mismatches. These smaller hairpins may provide less of an impediment to translocation of the 40S ribosomal subunit.

The approximately158 base fragments seen most clearly in the S1 reaction could be the result of cleavage of the first of the three loops of a tetraplex formed by the 97 uninterrupted CGG repeats at the 3' end of the repeat tract as illustrated in Figure 2(vi). The central loop of this tetraplex would co-migrate with the products of cleavage of the hairpin formed by the same region. While no distinct product of approximately297 bases could be seen for what would be cleavage of the third loop of the tetraplex, support for tetraplex formation is bolstered by the fact that the appearance of the approximately155 base fragment is favored by low pH and the presence of K+, both factors known to stabilize the CGG-DNA tetraplex.

We assessed the ability of CGG-RNA to activate partially purified human PKR expressed in bacteria. Since bacterially produced PKR is normally fully activated, we made use of a construct containing both the human PKR and the lambda phosphatase genes. We incubated PKR in the presence of [gamma-32P]ATP and in vitro transcribed RNA containing either 22 CGG repeats, corresponding to a normal allele, or 120 repeats, corresponding to the repeats in a pre-mutation allele. The amount of PKR autophosphorylation is shown in Figure 3A. While a significant increase in the extent of phosphorylation was seen with increasing amounts of the synthetic double-stranded RNA polymer polyI:polyC, no such increase could be seen with either (CGG)22 or (CGG)9AGG (CGG)12AG G(CGG)97.

We also tested the ability of these RNAs to activate PKR in vivo by measuring the amount of phosphorylation of a downstream target of activated PKR, eIF2alpha, in HeLa cells transfected with in vitro synthesized (CGG)9AGG (CGG)12AGG(CGG)97 RNA or in otherwise isogenic cell lines that express either 0 or 176 CGG repeats under the control of a doxycycline-regulatable CMV promoter. While an increase in the amount of phosphorylated eIF2alpha was seen when poly(I):poly(C) was introduced into cells, no increase in the amount of phosphorylated eIF2alpha was seen with the exogenously produced CGG-containing RNA (Fig. 3B). No increase in the amount of phosphorylated eIF2alpha was seen with the endogenous source of CGG-RNA either (Fig. 3C).

Digestion of a 'single-stranded' RNA generated by T7 transcription of one strand of the luciferase gene showed no evidence of cleavage by purified recombinant human Dicer. In contrast, digestion of a bona fide double-stranded RNA produced by transcription from the same template transcribed in both directions yielded significant amounts of a 22 bp fragment (Fig. 4). Treatment of (CGG)9AGG (CGG)12AGG(CGG)97 RNA produced a product of the same size, indicating that the RNA is a substrate for Dicer. However, the yield of this product was only approximately10% that obtained for the bona fide double-stranded RNA substrate. Its relatively inefficient conversion into small interfering (siRNA) could be due in part to the fact that the constituent hairpins contain a large number of G.G mismatches.

DISCUSSION
###end title 37
###begin p 38
We have shown that the predominant structures formed by CGG repeat RNA under physiologically reasonable conditions are hairpins. Formation of these structures may explain the stalling of the 40S ribosomal subunits that is seen on FMR1 alleles with long CGG repeat tracts. This stalling is believed to contribute to FXS disease pathology by reducing the translation efficiency of these transcripts.

In addition, since double-stranded RNA potentially has a number of negative consequences for a cell, it is possible that hairpin formation also contributes to the pathology seen in FXS 'pre-mutation' carriers. However, in contrast to what has been demonstrated for the DM1 repeats, we found no evidence that CGG-RNA can activate PKR either in vitro or in vivo. It is known that not all RNAs with duplex character activate PKR, and some RNAs such as the human immunodeficiency virus TAR RNA (21) and adenovirus VA I RNA (22) actually inhibit PKR activation. One common feature of these RNAs seems to be the presence of numerous unpaired or non-Watson-Crick base pairs (23). CGG-RNA with its likely 2:1 ratio of Watson-Crick C.G and Hoogsteen G.G base pairs does fit this description. The absence of detectable PKR activation by pre-mutation length CGG repeats suggests that any potential toxicity of CGG-RNA lies elsewhere.

The fact that pre-mutation length CGG-RNA is a substrate for Dicer suggests one possible way that long CGG tracts in RNA could be deleterious, i.e. via translational suppression or RNAi-mediated gene silencing. Since these modes of silencing are homology based, it is possible that overexpression of CGG-RNA in 'pre-mutation' carriers could affect the expression of other CGG.CCG-containing genes. This in turn could have pleiotropic effects on development and cell viability. However, other potential mechanisms of RNA toxicity are also possible. By analogy with one hypothesis for the pathogenesis of DM1, it may be that the CGG-RNA sequesters one or more CGG-RNA-binding proteins, leading to defects in the pathways in which these proteins act [for recent review see Ranum and Day (6)]. This possibility is currently under investigation.

 Effect of CGG-RNA on PKR activation. (A) Phosphorylation of partially purified human PKR in vitro in response to added RNAs. The data are expressed as the amount of phosphorylated PKR relative to the endogenous levels of phosphorylated material present in the absence of added RNA. The level of PKR phosphorylation in response to added RNA for poly(I):poly(C) is indicated by triangles, (AUU)88 by crosses, (CGG)22 by diamonds and (CGG)9AGG(CGG)12AGG(CGG)97 by squares. (B) The amount of phosphorylated eIF2alpha in cells transfected with in vitro synthesized RNA. The data are expressed as the amount of phosphorylated eIF2alpha at the indicated time points relative to the amount before addition of the RNA. The gray bars indicate the amount of phosphorylated eIF2alpha in cells transfected with poly(I):poly(C) and the black bars the amount detected in cells transfected with the same amount of (CGG)9AGG(CGG)12AG G(CGG)97 RNA. (C) The amount of phosphorylated eIF2alpha in cells expressing an otherwise identical transcript containing either 0 (FRT0) or 176 (FRT176) CGG repeats. A small increase in the amount of phosphorylated eIF2alpha is seen in both cell lines at 48 h but, at least in the case of the FRT176 cell line, this does not seem to be related to expression of the CGG-containing RNA since more phosphorylated product is seen in the absence of dox than in its presence.
