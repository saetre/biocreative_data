Genes for tRNALys5 from Drosophila melanogaster.

###begin p 1
The sequences of two cloned genes from Drosophila which hybridize with tRNALys5 are reported. One gene, in plasmid pDt39, has a sequence which corresponds to the sequence of tRNA. The other gene, in pDt59R, differs in three nucleotides pairs. Both plasmids are transcribed in vitro with extracts of Drosophila Kc cells to give full-sized tRNA precursors with four additional nucleotides at the 5'-end as well as truncated molecules containing 35 nucleotides. This premature termination occurs in a block of four T residues within the mature coding region. Sequences flanking the tRNA genes show little in common except for the blocks of five or more T-residues beyond the 3'-end of the gene. pDt39 hybridizes to 84AB on the polytene chromosomes of Drosophila and pDt59R hybridizes to 29A.
