No mutation was found in both cancer cell lines and NSCLC tissues. A single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) at codon 302 was detected in 51.5% of the cell lines and 62.5% of NSCLC tissues. Interestingly, Rad18 was homozygously deleted in a pulmonary adenocarcinoma cell line PC3. Furthermore, there was no difference in the expression level of wild type Rad18 and Rad18 with SNP. The growth, cell morphology, sensitivity to anti-cancer drugs and in vitro DNA repair activity between wild type Rad18 and Rad18 with SNP revealed to have no difference in vitro.

Endogenous and environmental factors such as ultraviolet, ionizing radiation, and numerous genotoxic chemicals can cause DNA damage. These DNA lesions can be repaired by various repair mechanisms [1]. For example, the most frequent DNA lesions are efficiently removed by pathways called base excision repair and nucleotide excision repair [2]. However, some unrepaired DNA lesions can remain at replication because of limited capacity of DNA repair systems. These lesions induce gaps in the newly synthesized strand. The gaps are filled by postreplication repair (PRR) system and this repair system is conserved from yeast to mammalian cells [3,4]. In the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, genes belonging to the Rad6 epistasis group play an important role in the PRR pathway [5]. In this pathway, Rad6 and Rad18 are the most important genes. Rad6 is an ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme (E2) and Rad18 is a single-stranded DNA binding protein and has ubiquitin-ligase (E3) activity. Rad18 forms a specific complex with Rad6 [6,7]. Human homolog of yeast Rad18 gene is mapped on chromosome 3p24-25 and it has been shown that human Rad18 protein interacts with the human homologs of the Rad6 protein (HHR6A and HHR6B) and is involved in PRR [8,9]. Rad18 or Rad6 mutations cause higher sensitivity to various mutagens [10]. Inactivation of Rad18 in mouse embryonic stem cells leads to increasing sensitivity to various DNA-damaging agents and to increasing sister-chromatic exchange. Rad18 contributes to maintenance of genomic stability through PRR [10]. However, the status of Rad18 in human cancers is still unknown.

RT-PCR SSCP of Rad18 in 33 cancer cell lines was analyzed by PCR-SSCP. Within the ten PCR fragment, only PCR fragment No.7 showed abnormal band pattern in 17 cell lines (Figure 2A). Direct sequence of the abnormal band revealed that all 17 cell lines carried a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) at the second letter of codon 302 (51.5%) and there were no other mutation (Figure 2B). This SNP was already reported in the SNP database. Though there was no coding region mutation, as lung cancer cell line PC3 had a homozygous deletion in Rad18 genomic lesion and as Rad18 is mapped at chromosome 3p25 which is reported to have frequent LOH in lung cancer [12], we decided to analyze lung cancer tissue for Rad18 mutation.

The clinicopathological characteristics of examined NSCLC patients are shown in Table 2. First we checked the expression of Rad18 by RT-PCR The expression of Rad18 was observed in all 32 NSCLC tissues. RT-PCR SSCP revealed that there was no mutation in Rad18 coding region but the same SNP of codon 302. This SNP was observed in 20 samples of 32 NSCLC tissues (62.5%) and in 15 peripheral blood samples of 26 healthy volunteers (57.7%). Though, the frequency of Rad18 SNP is tended to be higher in NSCLC tissue than the healthy volunteers, the difference was not significant. There was no difference in other characters such as sex, histological type, T-stage, lymph node metastasis or p-stage between WT and SNP (Table 2). In addition, there were no difference between the three patterns of codon 302 and lung cancer development (Table 3). Furthermore, Rad18 expression level was also examined using light cycler (Fig 3). No difference was observed between WT and SNP or between the three patterns of codon 302.

Though there was no Rad18 mutation in human cancer cell line and NSCLC tissue examined except PC3, as Rad18 functions as post-replication repair system, we have examined whether there is any difference between wild type Rad18 and Rad18 SNP in vitro. Using Rad18 null cell line PC3, wild type Rad18 or Rad18 SNP was transfected. The expression of introduced Rad18 gene was confirmed by RT-PCR and Western blotting (Fig 4A). The cell morphology of these stable transfectant had no difference (Fig 4B). Additionally, there was no difference in growth, sensitivity or survival rate against anti-cancer drugs (CDDP or CPT-11) (Fig 4C, 5A, B). Furthermore, the in vitro DNA repair showed that, when PC3 was transfected with Rad18, the DNA repair was induced compared to the control (LacZ transfected PC3). However, there was no difference between the status of the codon 302 (A/A, A/G, G/G) (Fig 5C).

There is no doubt that genetic instability is one of the main causes of cancer development. Genetic instability can be divided in two. One is chromosomal instability and the other is microsatellite instability (MSI). It is reported that chromosomal instability is frequently found in lung cancer but microsatelite instability is rare [13]. Though 60% of non small cell lung cancer has loss of heterozygosity (LOH) in 3p and it is suggested that several tumor suppressor genes might be mapped in this region, a clear relation between lung cancer development and a single gene mutation has not been reported to date [14,15]. Concerning microsatellite instability, using microsatellite markers located at 3p or targeting human mismatch repair gene, hMLH1, has been analyzed [16,17]. They concluded that MSI is not frequently found in lung cancer tissue or pleural effusion of lung cancer patients.

We focused on Rad18 which functions as a PRR system and mapped on 3p25. Within the cell lines and lung cancer tissues that we examined, no Rad18 mutation was detected but a homozygous deletion in PC3 (lung cancer cell line). This result suggests that there might be no relation between Rad18 mutation and lung cancer development. During the SSCP analysis, we found a SNP (Gln 302 Arg) which was relatively frequent in lung cancer tissues. Recently, a report that the same SNP of Rad18 is associated to the risk of lung cancer was published [18]. Different to our study, this report was focused only on the SNP and the mutation analysis of the entire Rad18 gene was not evaluated. They used only genomic DNA extracted from a formalin embedded lung cancer tissue which was PCR amplified and checked only the status of codon 302 SNP and concluded that this SNP is the risk of lung cancer development. The total number of the lung cancer sample was quite large and the frequency of SNP and lung cancer development was statistically different. If this single nucleotide change (which changes the amino acid sequence) is the cause of lung cancer, this is no more a "polymorphism" but a "mutation". And if this nucleotide change is a "mutation", there should be a difference in the function between these two different proteins. Based on the function of Rad18, as a key protein of PRR system, the sensitivity to the DNA damaging reagents (cisplatin and CPT-11) were examined according to the reports [19,20]. Furthermore, when Rad18 is null, it is reported that the growth of the cells won't change but the abnormal morphologies with nuclear segregation will occur [21,22]. Thus we investigated the differences of cell morphology, cell growth and sensitivity to anti-drug agents. Unfortunately, we could not find a difference from both clinical samples and in vitro study. Furthermore, no difference was observed in DNA repair function. Different to the report, we used mRNA and analyzed the whole open reading frame of Rad18 gene and also examined the expression level, in vitro analysis.

Conclusion
###end title 58
###begin p 59
From all these results, we came to a conclusion that, there is no relation between Rad18 and lung cancer development. Still there is a possibility that PRR system might be involved in cancer development. As Rad18 interacts with Rad6 and function as a ubiquitin enzyme to activate PCNA, if these key proteins were involved in cancer, the PRR system will not function and might lead to cancer development. Further analysis of this system is required to clear whether there is a relation between PRR and cancer development.
