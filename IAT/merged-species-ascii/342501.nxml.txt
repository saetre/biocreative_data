We here report the nucleotide sequence of the SV40 DNA fragment Hind C - Hap 2. The fragment was labeled at the 5'-ends by means of polynucleotide kinase and gamma-(32P) ATP and digested with a suitable restriction enzyme. The separated products were then partially degraded with the base-specific reagents dimethyl-sulphate or hydrazine followed by direct analysis on polyacrylamide gel. The Hind C - Hap 2 sequence is 126 base pairs long and one of the three possible reading frames for translation does not contain any termination codon. So, although no protein is known to be encoded by this region, the possibility cannot yet be completely ruled out. The sequence also contains several AT-rich blocks.
