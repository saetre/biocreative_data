In this paper we describe the isolation of cDNA clones which code for parts of apolipoprotein B (apoB). The clones were obtained by immunoscreening of an expression library (lambda gt 11) derived from a human hepatoma cell line (Hep G2). The relationship between positive clones and apoB was established with immunochemical techniques using polyclonal as well as monoclonal antibodies. Recombinants, expressing nonoverlapping regions of apoB are described, all hybridizing with a very large mRNA (approximately 20,000 bases long). The nucleotide sequence obtained predicts a primary protein structure with a composition suitable for the formation of stretches of an amphipatic alpha-helix.
