The sequence of 205 nucleotides adjacent to the poly(A) tract at the 3'-terminus of the mRNA encoding the N polypeptide of vesicular stomatitis virus has been determined by copying with reverse transcriptase and using 2', 3'-dideoxynucleoside triphosphates as specific chain terminators. The method appears highly suitable for sequence determination in any purified mRNA. An examination of the sequence did not locate without ambiguity the limit of polypeptide coding RNA. The hexanucleotide AAUAAA, previously found in all poly(A)-containing eukaryote mRNAs, is not present, although the sequence immediately adjacent to the 3'-terminal poly(A) has a high content of A+U.
