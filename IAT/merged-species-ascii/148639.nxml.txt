The poly(A)-binding protein II (PABP2) is one of the polyadenylation factors required for proper 3'-end formation of mammalian mRNAs. We have cloned Pabp2, the gene encoding the Drosophila homolog of mammalian PABP2, by using a molecular screen to identify new Drosophila proteins with RNP-type RNA-binding domains. Sequence comparison of PABP2 from Drosophila and mammals indicates that the most conserved domains are the RNA-binding domain and a coiled-coil like domain which could be involved in protein-protein interactions. Pabp2 produces four mRNAs which result from utilization of alternative poly(A) sites and encode the same protein. Using an antibody raised against Drosophila PABP2, we show that the protein accumulates in nuclei of all transcriptionally active cells throughout Drosophila development. This is consistent with a general role of PABP2 in mRNA polyadenylation. Analysis of Drosophila PABP2 function in a reconstituted mammalian polyadenylation system shows that the protein has the same functions as its bovine homolog in vitro : it stimulates poly(A) polymerase and is able to control poly(A) tail length.
