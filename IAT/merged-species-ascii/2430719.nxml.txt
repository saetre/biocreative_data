Our previous study revealed that Vav3 oncogene is overexpressed in human prostate cancer, activates androgen receptor, and stimulates growth in prostate cancer cells. The current study is to determine a potential role of Vav3 oncogene in human breast cancer and impact on estrogen receptor a (ERalpha)-mediated signaling axis.

Immunohistochemistry analysis was performed in 43 breast cancer specimens and western blot analysis was used for human breast cancer cell lines to determine the expression level of Vav3 protein. The impact of Vav3 on breast cancer cell growth was determined by siRNA knockdown of Vav3 expression. The role of Vav3 in ERalpha activation was examined in luciferase reporter assays. Deletion mutation analysis of Vav3 protein was performed to localize the functional domain involved in ERalpha activation. Finally, the interaction of Vav3 and ERalpha was assessed by GST pull-down analysis.

We found that Vav3 was overexpressed in 81% of human breast cancer specimens, particularly in poorly differentiated lesions. Vav3 activated ERalpha partially via PI3K-Akt signaling and stimulated growth of breast cancer cells. Vav3 also potentiated EGF activity for cell growth and ERalpha activation in breast cancer cells. More interestingly, we found that Vav3 complexed with ERalpha. Consistent with its function for AR, the DH domain of Vav3 was essential for ERalpha activation.

Vav3 oncogene is overexpressed in human breast cancer. Vav3 complexes with ERalpha and enhances ERalpha activity. These findings suggest that Vav3 overexpression may aberrantly enhance ERalpha-mediated signaling axis and play a role in breast cancer development and/or progression.

Vav3 oncogene, a quanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) for Rho family GTPases, belongs to Vav family proteins. The three mammalian Vav proteins (Vav1, Vav2, and Vav3) differ in their tissue distribution. Vav1 is primarily expressed in hematopoietic cells, while Vav2 and Vav3 are more ubiquitously expressed [1,2]. Vav proteins contain multiple function motifs and are involved in various cellular signaling processes, including cytoskeleton organization, calcium influx, phagocytosis, and cell transformation [3]. Vav proteins share a common structure, including a N-terminal calponin homology (CH) domain involved in Ca+2 mobilization and transforming activity, an acidic domain (AD) containing three regulatory tyrosines, a Dbl homology (DH) domain with a conserved region that promotes the exchange of GDP for GTP on Rac/Rho GTPases, a pleckstrin homology (PH) domain binding to PIP3 that enables its movement to the inner face of the plasma membrane, two Src-homology 3 (SH3) domains interacting with proteins containing proline-rich sequences, and a Src-homology 2 (SH2) domain interacting with proteins containing phosphorylated tyrosines [4,5]. Tyrosine phosphorylation by receptor protein tyrosine kinase or cytoplasmic protein tyrosine kinase is required for Vav protein activation. In the non-phosphorylation state, Vav is folded, which is achieved by binding of the tyrosines in the AD domain to the DH domain and binding of the CH domain to the C1 region. Upon phosphorylation of the tyrosines in the AD domain, the folding is opened and the DH domain is exposed. Thus, Vav protein is activated and interacts with substrate proteins, and the PH domain is exposed for PIP3 binding [6].

Breast cancer is the most common malignant disease worldwide and the number one cause of cancer-related death among non-smoking women in the US. The major problem in breast cancer therapy is development of estrogen-insensitive growth after hormonal therapy. Aberrant ERalpha activation by various mechanisms contributes to breast cancer development and estrogen-resistant diseases [7-9]. This ERalpha hypersensitivity can be achieved by estrogen-independent mechanisms, such as ERalpha phosphorylation by crosstalking with signal transduction pathways and overexpression of nuclear receptor coactivator SRC3 [10,11]. Numerous studies have shown that EGFR/HER2-elicited signaling is involved in human breast cancer [9]. In addition, elevated PI3K-Akt signaling, mediated by PTEN deletion and/or mutation and PI3K subunit p110a (PI3KCA) mutation, upregulates ERalpha activity and is correlated with the breast cancer development and anti-estrogen resistance [12-15]. Activation of PI3K has been implicated in part because the downstream PI3K target, Akt, phosphorylates and promotes ligand-independent ERalpha activation [16,17]. Transgenic breast cancer mouse models have confirmed that elevated signaling in the EGFR/HER2-PI3K-Akt pathway either by targeted Akt overexpression or HER2 overexpression in breast epithelial cells induces breast cancer development [18-20]. These signaling pathways have been the targets for breast cancer therapy [7-9].

The classical ERalpha is a ligand-dependent transcription factor that activates transcription of its target genes in nucleus, which is known as genomic ERalpha activity. Recent findings revealed that the classical steroid hormone receptors also associate with cell membrane and mediate cell signaling through kinase cascade, defined as nongenomic activity [21,22]. Nongenomic ERalpha resides in multiprotein complexes with molecules, such as MNAR/PELP1 and src, in the cytoplasm and signals through the PI3K-Akt and MAPK pathways in breast cancer cells [23,24]. Nongenomic ERalpha signaling has been shown to contribute to estrogen-independent growth in breast cancer.

Recently, we and others found that Vav3 oncogene is overexpressed in androgen-independent prostate cancer cells, enhances androgen receptor (AR) activity, and stimulates androgen-independent growth in prostate cancer cells [25,26]. We further showed that Vav3, as a signal transducer, upregulates AR activity partially via PI3K-Akt signaling [25]. The DH domain of Vav3 is responsible for AR activation. Vav3 also potentiates EGF activity for cell growth and AR activation in prostate cancer cells. More importantly, Vav3 is overexpressed in 32% of human prostate cancer. These findings suggest that Vav3 overexpression may be involved in prostate cancer.

The purpose of this study is to determine the role of Vav3 in breast cancer. We found that Vav3 is overexpressed in human breast cancer specimens and cell lines. Vav3 stimulates growth of breast cancer cells and activates ERalpha partially via PI3K-Akt signaling. Vav3 potentiates EGF activity for cell growth and ERalpha activation in breast cancer cells. These data suggest that Vav3 impacts on ERalpha signaling axis and its overexpression may be involved in breast cancer.

Tumor cell growth was estimated by MTT assay as previously described [27]. Briefly, breast cancer cells were seeded into 96-well cell culture plates at a density of 2.5 x 103 cells/well in stripped medium. After incubation in 5% CO2 at 37degreesC overnight, the cells were transfected with Vav3 siRNA and control siRNA using Lipofectamine 2000 and then cultured in stripped medium without or with E2 (10-9M) for 5 days. At the end of incubation, 20 ul of MTT (2.5 mg/ml in PBS) was added to each well, and the cells were further incubated for one hour at 37degreesC to allow complete reaction between the dye and the enzyme mitochondrial dehydrogenase in the viable cells. After removal of the residual dye and medium, 100 ul of dimethylsulfoxide was added to each well, and the absorbance at 570 nm was measured using BMG microplate Reader (BMG Labtech, Inc., Durham, NC).

To determine a potential role of Vav3 in breast cancer, we evaluated Vav3 expression in surgical specimens of human breast cancer by IHC analysis using anti-Vav3 antibody. No significant Vav3 immunoreactivity was detected in all normal breast tissue sections (0/8) (Table 1and Figure 1). In contrast, Vav3 staining, detected in both cytoplasm and nucleus of the epithelial cells but not in stroma of breast tissues, was found in 35 out of 43 tumor tissue sections (35/43, 81%, p < 0.0001). Among the tumor sections, Vav3 staining was found in approximately 67% (27/35) of the specimens with well to moderately differentiated tumors and 100% (8/8) of those with poorly differentiated tumors, respectively. The statistical analysis of association of Vav3 overexpression with poorly differentiated breast tumors failed (p > 0.05), possibly due to the small number of poorly differentiated tumor specimens. The proportion of sections with higher intensity of Vav3 staining, however, was significantly elevated in the specimens with poorly differentiated tumors (p < 0.01). As shown in Figure 1, for moderately and poorly differentiation breast cancer cells, the nuclei are significantly enlarged, hyperchromatic with coarse clumping of chromatin, prominent nucleoli, and irregular nuclear membrane.

Immunoblotting analysis also revealed that Vav3 expression was elevated in MCF-7 and T47D breast cancer cells in comparison with that in nontumoral breast epithelial MCF-10A cells (Figure 2A). ERalpha was detected in the two breast cancer cell lines, but not at the very low level in nontumoral MCF-10A cells.

To determine a potential role of Vav3 in growth of breast cancer cells, we determined the role of Vav3 on estrogen-independent growth in breast cancer cells. Control and Vav3-transfected MCF7 cells were incubated in stripped medium in the presence of increasing concentrations of EGF. We found that Vav3 overexpression stimulated MCF7 cell growth in the absence of EGF and also significantly potentiated the cell growth in response to EGF treatment in a dose-dependent manner (Figure 2B. Elevated expression of Vav3 upon transient transfection of Vav3 expression vector was confirmed by western blot analysis in these cells (Figure 2C).

We then determined whether knockdown expression of Vav3 inhibits growth of these breast cancer cells using Vav3 siRNA that has been characterized previously [25]. Lipofectamine 2000 used for transfection of siRNA has been shown to knock down more than 80% activity of the endogenous gene in a panel of cells tested (Invitrogen). We confirmed a reduced level of Vav3 upon transfection of Vav3 siRNA by protein expression analysis relative to the control (Figure 2D). A growth stimulatory effect in response to estrogen stimulation was observed in T47D and MCF7 cells (Figure 2Eand 2F). We found that knockdown expression of Vav3 significantly inhibited both estrogen-dependent and -independent growth in these breast cancer cells (Figure 2Eand 2F). At 1.2 pM of siRNA, the growth of T47D and MCF7 cells was inhibited by 64% and 68% in the absence of estrogen and 46% and 77% in the presence of estrogen relative to their respective controls. These data suggest that Vav3 is involved in both estrogen-dependent and -independent growth in breast cancer cells.

Previous studies have revealed that Vav3*, a Vav3 mutant with N-terminal domain deletion including the AD domain containing three tyrosine residues, is a constitutive active form and has much stronger oncogenic effect relative to that by wild type Vav3 [30]. Structure analysis of Vav protein suggested that in the non-phosphorylation state, Vav protein is folded, which is achieved by binding of tyrosines in the AD domain to the DH domain and binding of the CH domain to the C1 region [6]. Phosphorylation of the tyrosines in the AD domain results in unfolding of Vav protein and exposure of the DH domain for interacting with substrate proteins. Consistently, we found that the constitutive active Vav3* shows a much stronger activity in upregulation of AR activity than that by Vav3 [25].

To determine whether Vav3 regulates ERalpha activity, we used both Vav3 and Vav3* for the reporter assay. Hela cells were transiently cotransfected with a luciferase reporter driven by the estrogen response element (ERE), ERalpha expression vector, and either Vav3 or Vav3* expression vector. Overexpression of Vav3, and Vav3* with a greater effect relative to the empty vector pHEF, enhanced both basal and estrogen-stimulated ERalpha activity (Figure 3A). Furthermore, we found that both estrogen-stimulated and Vav3-activated ERalpha activities were blocked by ER antagonist Tamoxifen (Figure 3A). The inhibitory effect for ERalpha by Tamoxifen was compromised with Vav3 overexpression. Upregulation of the endogenous ERalpha activity by Vav3 relative to the empty vector pHEF was also confirmed in MCF7 cells by stimulation of luciferase reporter expression driven by ERE (Figure 3B) and natural promoter of ERalpha target gene pS2 (Figure 3C). Vav3 also significantly enhanced ERalpha activity stimulated by sub-physiological concentrations of estrogen (10-11 and 10-10 M) (Figure 3B). These data suggest that Vav3 overexpression confers ERalpha hypersensitivity.

We next examined the domains of Vav3 required for upregulation of ERalpha activity by analyzing both wild type Vav3 and Vav3 deletion mutants (Figure 4A). We found that Vav3* demonstrated a much stronger activity for ERalpha activation relative to Vav3 as compared with the empty vector pHEF, supporting the previous observation that activity of Vav3 is subjected to regulation by phosphorylation (Figure 4Band Figure 5D) [6]. In addition, deletion of the DH domain, but not the SH domain or the CH domain, abolished Vav3 function for ERalpha activation (Figure 4B). The truncated Vav3 protein with deletion of both PH and SH domains failed to activate ERalpha. Therefore, consistent with our previous observation of its effect for AR, the DH domain of Vav3 is also essential for ERalpha activation [25].

Elevated PI3K-Akt signaling enhances ERalpha activity and is thought to be critical for breast cancer development and progression [11,31,32]. Since Vav3 is a potential upstream regulator of the PI3K-Akt pathway [33,34], we investigated whether Vav3 overexpression impacts on PI3K-Akt signaling-mediated ERalpha activation. Hela cells were transiently cotransfected with ERE-Luc reporter, and expression vectors ERalpha, Vav3*, and p85 (the regulatory subunit of PI3K) and p110 (the catalytic subunit of PI3K). As shown in Figure 5A, cotransfection of Vav3* or PI3K relative to the empty vector pHEF or pCR3.1 stimulated ERalpha activity. ERalpha activity was further enhanced in cells cotransfected with both Vav3* and PI3K. On the other hand, cotransfection of a dominant-negative Akt relative to the empty vector pCR3.1 blocked Vav3*-mediated ERalpha activation (Figure 5B). Next, we determined the role of endogenous PI3K in Vav3-induced ERalpha activation. Data in Figure 5C showed that PI3K inhibitor Wortmannin blocked both basal and Vav3-stimulated ERalpha activation in the absence and presence of E2. Similar results were also noted in cells treated with PI3K inhibitor LY294002 (data not shown). These data indicate that Vav3 activates ERalpha at least partially via PI3K-Akt signaling.

In agreement with its effects on estrogen-independent growth in breast cancer cells (Figure 2B), overexpression of Vav3 potentiated EGF-stimulated ERalpha activation (Figure 5D). This data suggests that Vav3 overexpression may mediate EGFR/HER2/neu-elicited signaling leading to ERalpha hypersensitivity.

Recent findings implicate that Vav family proteins also complex with transcription factors and regulate gene expression [35,36]. A nuclear localization signal (NLS) in the PH domain was shown to be solely responsible for the nucleus localization of Vav1 protein, indicating a role of Vav family protein as a transcription coregulator. We have demonstrated that the DH domain of Vav3 is essential for AR and ERalpha activation (Figure 4) [25]. We performed sequence analysis of Vav proteins and found that the DH domain of Vav3 contains three consensus sequences of the LXXLL motifs or NR boxes, which have been well characterized and involved in interaction with nuclear receptors (Figure 6A). In addition, homologous analysis of Vav3 and Vav1 genes identified a conserved NLS in the PH domain of Vav3 (Figure 6B). These findings suggest that Vav3 is also localized in nucleus and regulates transcription of nuclear receptors.

We then determined whether Vav3 complexes with ERalpha. We performed GST pull down experiment to confirm the interaction between Vav3 and ERalpha. A GST fusion protein including the DH and PH domain of Vav3 (GST-Vav3-DH+PH) was generated (Figure 7A). Cell extract derived from MCF7 cells was incubated with immobilized GST-Vav3-DH+PH fusion protein or GST protein. Then, the pull down samples were fractionated by SDS-PAGE (Figure 7B) and subjected to western blot analysis for ERalpha. We found that GST-Vav3-DH+PH fusion protein, but GST protein, interacted with ERalpha (Figure 7C). In summary, we found that Vav3 contains NLS in the PH domain and three LXXLL motifs in the DH domain. The deletion mutation and functional analysis by luciferase reporter assay showed that the DH domain of Vav3 is essential for enhancing ERalpha activity and is involved in complex with ERalpha. Our data suggest that Vav3 complexes with ERalpha and its overexpression enhances ERalpha signaling axis in breast cancer cells.

Previous studies from our group have demonstrated that Vav3 is overexpressed in human prostate cancer and potentiates AR signaling [25]. Breast cancer and prostate cancer are steroid-dependent tumors and share a significant similarity in their characteristics and treatment. For instance, growth of these cancer cells, mediated by their corresponding hormone receptors ERalpha and AR, is hormone-dependent. Hormone ablation is common therapy for both cancers. Recurrent diseases develop hormone-independent growth. Given that steroidal nuclear receptors share many common properties, we hypothesized that Vav3 may regulate ERalpha activity and is involved in human breast cancer. We tested this hypothesis in the present study by examining the expression of Vav3 in human breast cancer specimens and cell lines and investigated a potential role of Vav3 in breast cancer cell growth and ERalpha signaling. We found that Vav3 was overexpressed in human breast cancer, particularly in the poorly differentiated lesions and in the two most commonly used breast cancer cell lines. The knockdown expression of Vav3 compromised both estrogen-stimulated and -independent growth of breast cancer cells. On the other hand, overexpression of Vav3 enhanced ERalpha signaling. These data strongly suggest that Vav3 may play an important role in breast cancer development and/or progression.

Vav3 is an oncogene identified in cell transformation experiments [3]. Vav3 is activated upon ligand stimulation of EGF, insulin, Ros, and IGF receptors and physically associates with a variety of signaling molecules, including Rac1, Cdc42, PI3K, Grb2, and PLC-gamma, leading to alteration in cell morphology and cell transformation [33]. Overexpression of Vav3 leads to PI3K activation and focus formation in NIH3T3 cells [34]. In contrast, blocking PI3K activation by PTEN and LY294002 inhibits Vav3-induced cell transformation. Furthermore, it has been shown that Vav3*, a Vav3 mutant with N-terminal domain deletion including the acidic domain, is a constitutive active form and has much stronger oncogenic effect compared with that by Vav3 [30]. Consistently, we found that the augmentation of ERalpha signaling by Vav3 overexpression was similarly inhibited by Wortmannin and by overexpression of a dominant-negative Akt. In addition, Vav3 showed a lower activity for ERalpha activation relative to that by Vav3*. EGF treatment significantly potentiated Vav3 activity for ERalpha activation. These data suggest that Vav3 is subjected to regulation by phosphorylation, most likely at the three tyrosines in the AD domain, which may cause conformation change, release the inhibitory effect of the N-terminal domain, and expose the DH domain for ERalpha binding.

Many coactivators of steroid hormone receptors have the LXXLL motifs, where L is leucine and X is any amino acid [37,38]. These coregulators interact with and upregulate ERalpha-mediated signaling in both nucleus and cytoplasm. For instance, SRC-1 and its related proteins are a family of coactivators containing the homologous bHLH-PAS domain and receptor-interacting domain (RID) with multiple LXXLL motifs and enhance transcription activity of nuclear receptors [37,38]. PELP1/MNAR containing the LXXLL motif interacts with and enhances both genomic and nongenomic ERalpha activities [21,24]. Recent findings implicate that Vav family proteins also complex with transcription factors and regulate gene expression. Vav1 was identified in the component of transcriptionally active nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT)- and nuclear factor NFkB-like complexes [35,36]. A nuclear localization signal (NLS) in the PH domain is solely responsible for nucleus localization of Vav1 protein, indicating a role of Vav family proteins as a transcription coregulator. We found that Vav3 contains the LXXLL motifs in the DH domain and NLS in the PH domain. This finding suggests that Vav3 is also a nuclear protein.

Previous study has shown that Vav protein can be activated by receptor tyrosine kinase upon activation of EGFR [39]. Furthermore, ERalpha resides in multi-protein complexes with molecules, such as MNAR/PELP1 and src, in the cytoplasm and signals through the PI3K-Akt and MAPK pathways in breast cancer cells [23,24]. ERalpha was also found localized in lipid rafts and involved in signaling elicited by EGFR and HER2 receptors [40,41]. We found that Vav3 activates ERalpha partially via PI3K-Akt signaling and potentiates EGF effect for cell growth and ERalpha activation in breast cancer cells. More interestingly, we found that Vav3 complexes with ERalpha. These findings suggest that Vav3 enhances ERalpha signaling axis in breast cancer cells. Vav3 overexpression may confer ERalpha hypersensitivity and play a role in breast cancer. Given both nuclear and cytoplasmic localization of Vav3 protein, our data implicate that Vav3 may impact on both genomic and nongenomic ERalpha activity. Furthermore, the relationship of Vav3 and ERalpha in the context of EGFR/HER2 and PI3K-Akt signaling is remained to be determined.

Our findings support the notion that Vav3 overexpression may play a role in breast cancer, based on the following reasons: 1) Vav3 is overexpressed and correlated with poorly differentiated tumors in human breast cancer; 2) Vav3 contains the LXXLL motifs and complexes with ERalpha; 3) Vav3 enhances ERalpha activity partially via the PI3K-Akt pathway; 4) Vav3 is a protein with multiple domains and functions, including the SH2 domain interacting with receptor protein tyrosine kinase, the PH domain binding PIP3 involved in association with the cell membrane, and the DH domain involved in interaction with ERalpha; 5) Vav3 potentiates EGF for cell growth and ERalpha activation. Taken together, these findings suggest that Vav3 overexpression enhances ERalpha-mediated signaling axis and may be involved in breast cancer.

Data presented in this report clearly show that Vav3 is overexpressed in human breast cancer and is involved in growth of breast cancer cells and ERalpha signaling. Whereas our data showed that Vav3 complexes with ERalpha, molecular mechanisms underlying the enhancement of ERalpha signaling remain to be elucidated. Nevertheless, data presented here strongly suggest a novel mechanism that potentially leads to ERalpha hypersensitivity and breast cancer development and/or progression.
