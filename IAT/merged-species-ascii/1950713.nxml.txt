In order to better establish its function in tumourigenesis and tumour angiogenesis, we have stably transfected mouse neuroblastoma N1E-115 cells with the native form of HIF2alpha or with its dominant negative mutant, HIF2alpha (1-485) and studied their phenotype in vitro and in vivo.

In vitro studies reveal that HIF2alpha induces neuroblastoma cells hypertrophy and decreases their proliferation rate, while its inactivation by the HIF2alpha (1-485) mutant leads to a reduced cell size, associated with an accelerated proliferation. However, our in vivo experiments show that subcutaneous injection of cells overexpressing HIF2alpha into syngenic mice, leads to the formation of tumour nodules that grow slower than controls, but that are well structured and highly vascularized. In contrast, HIF2alpha (1-485)-expressing neuroblastomas grow fast, but are poorly vascularized and quickly tend to extended necrosis.

Cellular responses to low oxygen tension are mainly mediated by the activation of heterodimeric transcription factors, called hypoxia inducible factors (HIFs), which consist of a constitutively expressed subunit (ARNT) and an oxygen-regulated subunit, mainly HIF1alpha and HIF2alpha (or EPAS1). Under normoxia, HIFalpha are subjected to enzymatic proline hydroxylation that target them for proteasome degradation via the von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) ubiquitin E3 ligase complex (for review, see [1]).

Both HIFs are overexpressed in many cancer cells and mainly associated with invasiveness, poor prognosis and/or tumour angiogenesis (for review, see [2]). Experimental studies have however led to discrepant results regarding their role in cancer, pointing to functions varying depending on the cell type. Experiments performed with HIF1alpha-/- embryonic stem (ES) cells conflictingly revealed that HIF1 may act as a positive regulator of tumour growth, most likely through its activation of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) expression [3] or as a negative regulator, possibly through the stabilization of p53 in hypoxic cells [4]. In pancreatic cancer, disruption of HIF1 pathway using a dominant negative strategy reduces tumourigenesis [5]. Opposite results have also been obtained concerning HIF2alpha. In renal carcinoma cells originating from patients affected by Von Hippel Lindau disease, the abnormal stabilization of HIF2alpha appears to be directly responsible for tumourigenesis [6,7]. In teratomas derived from ES cells carrying an HIF2alpha knock-in at the HIF1alpha locus, Covello et al recently observed an increase in both vascular density and proliferation [8]. In contrast, transfection of HIF2alpha in a breast cancer cell line inhibits tumour growth, both in vitro and in vivo [9], while it was recently demonstrated to display pro-apoptotic activities in both rat gliomas and ES cells-derived teratomas [10].

Neuroblastomas are highly vascularized tumours that constitute one of the most frequent solid malignancy of childhood. They arise from immature cells derived from the neural crest and are particularly sensitive to low oxygen tension. Hypoxic treatment of neuroblastoma cells leads to their dedifferentiation towards a neural crest phenotype [11], while overexpression of VHL leads to their differentiation into functional neuron-like cells [12]. Moreover, hypoxia was associated with an increased invasiveness of these tumours in vivo [11]. These data point to a role of the HIF pathway in the induction of neuroblastoma's tumour phenotype.

HIF2alpha plays an important role in the sympathetic nervous system (SNS), both during embryogenesis [13] and in pathological conditions where it is associated with pheochromocytoma malignancy [14]. Hence, it appeared pertinent to assess its role in the SNS-derived model of neuroblastoma C1300. We thus carried out stable transfection of these cells with HIF2alpha cDNA or with its dominant negative mutant HIF2alpha(1-485) and show that HIF2alpha displays antiproliferative but pro-angiogenic activities that favour the establishment of neuroblastoma nodules in vivo.

Cell diameter was evaluated using the Adobe Photoshop software. In vitro, cells were seeded at low confluence in 10 cm Petri dishes, in order to avoid the formation of cell aggregates, and grown as described above. For each clone, 10 pictures were taken using a Sony Exwave HAD video camera connected to an Olympus CK2 microscope. In each field, 5 cells were randomly selected and their diameter was measured. This study was repeated once, for a total of 100 cells measured for each clone. For the in vivo measurements, the diameter of cells was measured on histological pictures of tissue sections stained with Masson's Trichrome (see Histology and immunohistochemistry section). For each clone, 15 cells form 3 different nodules were analysed, for a total of 50 cells per clone.

Sixty five 8 weeks-old, female A/J mice, were purchased from Jackson Laboratory and bred under standard conditions at the Experimental Animal Center of our Research center. Tumours were established in accordance to the guidelines set by the Montreal Heart Institute (MHI) animal care committee and the Canadian Council for Animal Protection. Each mouse was submitted to one injection of 2 x 106 cells in 500 mul Matrigel (Becton Dickinson). Injections were performed subcutaneously at one site on the back of the mouse. The growth of tumour nodules was then measured bidirectionally every 2 days and tumour volume was calculated by the formula pi/6 length2 x width. Mice were sacrificed 4 weeks after inoculation. For four HIF2alpha expressing cells, the MHI ethical committee allowed us to pursue our study up to day 35 post-inoculation.

We studied HIF2alpha 's function in the mouse model of neuroblastoma C1300 (N1E-115 clone). To better characterize these cells, we performed RT-PCR experiments to seek for the expression of genes of interest (Fig. 1a). We observed that N1E-115 cells express both HIF1alpha and HIF2alpha, their common target genes VEGF and adrenomedullin as well as several neuroblastoma classical markers including neuropilin-1, neuronal-specific enolase, Id2 and chromogranin A.

DNA ladder (L) is indicated in base pairs. b) Comparison of the human HIF2alpha (hHIF2alpha) 870 amino acids protein with the HIF2alpha(1-485) mutant shows that both activation domains have been truncated in the dominant negative form. c) Specific RT-PCR amplification of hHIF2alpha sequence was used to confirm the efficiency of transfection with both hHIF2alpha (E1 and E2) and hHIF2alpha(1-485) (DN5 and DN8) expressing vectors. Western blot using a specific anti-human HIF2alpha antibody confirmed the nuclear presence of the wild-type protein in E1 and E2 clones. d) Tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) expression was assessed by western blot and e) VEGF protein expression quantified by ELISA in duplicate 21% or 4% O2 atmosphere. Asterisks on bars illustrate statistical significance compared to NT cells in the same oxygen condition. Upper asterisks indicate significance between 21% and 4% O2 for each clone. f) Western blot evaluation of HIF1alpha levels revealed no variation between the different cell clones in both 21% and 4% O2.

We then stably transfected N1E-115 cells with plasmids encoding human HIF2alpha or its dominant negative mutant (DN). HIF2alpha DN (namely HIF2alpha(1-485)) comprises the DNA binding domain and the HLH-PAS dimerization domains, but lacks both transactivation domains (Fig. 1b). All commercially available anti-HIF2alpha antibodies target the C-terminus of the protein, which happens to be deleted in HIF2alpha(1-485). Screening for transfectants was thus performed by RT-PCR using primers specific to the human HIF2alpha sequence (Fig. 1c, upper panel). To avoid unspecific responses due to clonal selection, we selected two clones expressing HIF2alpha (E1 and E2) and two clones expressing HIF2alpha(1-485) (DN5 and DN8). Western blot experiments using a specific anti-human HIF2alpha antibody confirmed the nuclear expression of the transfected construct in HIF2alpha clones (Fig. 1c, lower panel). Untransfected cells (NT) or cells transfected with the empty pCDNA3.1 vector were used as controls (C).

To confirm the activity of HIF2alpha and HIF2alpha(1-485) exogenous proteins, we studied the expression of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), a known HIF2alpha target gene in the sympathetic nervous system [17]. We observed an increase in TH protein expression in HIF2alpha clones, and a reduction in HIF2alpha(1-485) compared to control cells (Fig. 1d). We next incubated the cells in normoxia (21% O2) or in low oxygen tension (4% O2) for 6 h and evaluated the release of VEGF by ELISA (Fig. 1e). In controls cells, we confirmed that VEGF expression was indeed induced, although moderately, in response to decreased oxygen tension (p = 0,04). As expected, we noted a marked increase in VEGF levels in both E1 and E2 clones, in normoxia (161% (p = 0,017) and 178% (p = 0,012) increase respectively as compared to control cells) and in 4% O2 (117% (p = 0,004) and 272% (p < 0,001) increase respectively). In contrast, VEGF protein concentration was not modified in DN5 and DN8 clones in normoxia compared to control cells, while its hypoxic induction was repressed in both clones. Western blot evaluation of HIF1alpha protein levels confirmed that the differences observed were not due to a deregulation of HIF1alpha protein expression, but attributable to HIF2alpha transfections (Fig. 1f).

Hypoxia induces an immature phenotype of neuroblastoma cells [11], while inhibition of the HIF pathway by VHL overexpression mediates differentiation toward a neuron-like morphology [12]. We searched for such modifications in HIF2alpha and HIF2alpha(1-485) clones, but could not detect any change in the typical cell shape nor in the number of neuronal extension (Fig. 2a). To confirm this observation, we studied the expression of Id2 and CgA markers, which are respectively induced and downregulated during hypoxia-mediated neuroblastoma dedifferentiation [11,18]. Such RT-PCR analyses revealed the absence of any noticeable difference in their expression between the various clones (Fig. 2b).

Unexpectedly, we observed a marked modification in N1E-115 cell size (Fig. 2a and 2c): both HIF2alpha clones displayed an average 30% increase in cell diameter (p < 0.001), while HIF2alpha(1-485) cells were 15 to 25% smaller than native or pCDNA3.1-transfected cells (p < 0.001). We performed Western blot experiments to detect the expression and the phosphorylation of two protein kinases, known to play a role in the modulation of cell size [19], i.e. Akt (Fig. 2c) and p70 s6 kinase (data not shown). In both cases, there was no significant difference, neither in protein expression nor in phosphorylation between the various clones.

It is worth noting that such observations were also performed on histological sections of tumour nodules grown in vivo (see following experiments and Fig. 5) where we measured a 22% increase in cell diameter in HIF2alpha and a 19 % decrease in HIF2alpha(1-485) nodules compared to control ones (p < 0,001).

The other major change in cell phenotype observed was a modification of proliferation (Fig. 3a). We indeed observed a 44 and 51% decrease in the growth rate of HIF2alpha cells in E1 (p = 0.015) and E2 (p = 0.004) clones, respectively, while cells expressing HIF2alpha(1-485) grew 44 and 65% faster than controls in DN5 (p = 0.048) and DN8 (p = 0.039) clones, respectively. During these experiments, we observed no increase in cell death in HIF2alpha cells compared to control or HIF2alpha(1-485) clones. The differences in proliferation rates were associated with a decrease in p42/44 mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) phosphorylation in HIF2alpha clones, while this pathway appeared activated in HIF2alpha(1-485) cells compared to controls.

We then evaluated the effect of HIF2alpha overexpression or inactivation in vivo in a tumourigenesis assay in syngenic A/J mice. Cells were injected subcutaneously and the growth of neuroblastoma nodules evaluated over a 4-week period (Fig. 4). As described in vitro, we observed that both HIF2alpha clones and both HIF2alpha(1-485) clones displayed the same behaviour, respectively. In an attempt to limit the number of animals, we thus pooled the in vivo data of E1 and E2 clones, now referred to as HIF2alpha, and of DN5 and DN8 cells, now referred to as HIF2alpha(1-485). Control cells formed regularly growing nodules, which were stopped after 28 days, when tumours reached the maximal volume fixed by MHI ethical guidelines. Accordingly with in vitro data, we first observed a marked decrease in the tumour growth of HIF2alpha overexpressing cells when compared to controls. At day 24, the volume of HIF2alpha nodules was 45% inferior to that of control tumours (p = 0.001). However, from day 24 onward, the growth curve of HIF2alpha cells displayed a marked acceleration. We thus extended the evaluation period for four HIF2alpha tumours. We observed that they reached the average size of 28-days control tumours 6 days after them, i.e. at day 34.

Cells overexpressing HIF2alpha(1-485) did not display the growth expected from the in vitro proliferation observations. First, they did grow slightly faster than control cells, to reach a maximal 22% volume increase at day 19 (p = 0.058). From day 19 onward, this divergence however diminished and at day 28, there was no distinction between control and HIF2alpha(1-485) tumours volumes.

In an attempt to clarify this rather complex in vivo effect of HIF2alpha on neuroblastoma growth, we removed tumours at days 19 (just before the growth acceleration of HIF2alpha nodules) and 28 for controls and HIF2alpha(1-485) cells and at days 19, 28 and 35 for HIF2alpha nodules. Macroscopic examination revealed that 28-days HIF2alpha(1-485) tumours were pale and highly necrotic compared to controls, whereas equivalent HIF2alpha tumours (obtained at day 35) appeared particularly dense and red coloured (Fig. 5a). These observations were confirmed by histological observation of Masson's trichrome stained sections. Massive necrosis was observed in HIF2alpha(1-485) tumours as compared to controls, while HIF2alpha nodules presented a much-limited number of necrotic regions (Fig. 5b). At day 19, cell proliferation revealed by proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) immunohistochemistry did not show any difference between the 3 tumour types, which were all actively proliferating (Fig. 5C insets). In contrast, at later stages, we observed that within healthy-looking areas of tumours, the number of proliferating cells was markedly increased in both 28- and 35-days HIF2alpha nodules compared to controls. In contrast, there was almost no PCNA staining in cells expressing the HIF2alpha DN (Fig. 5c). This observation does suggest that 28-day HIF2alpha(1-485) tumours were most probably entering a regression process, while their equivalent 35-day HIF2alpha counterparts were particularly proliferating. Finally, as HIFs have been described to induce or repress apoptosis, depending on the cell type, we studied the number of cleaved caspase-3 positive cells, outside of the large necrotic areas. In all tumours studied we observed isolated apoptotic cells as well as several areas presenting an increased density of positive cells, but we were unable to use these criteria to discriminate between control, HIF2alpha and HIF2alpha(1-485) tumours (Fig. 5d).

We hypothesized that the delayed growth of HIF2alpha tumours and the simultaneous necrosis of fast-growing HIF2alpha(1-485) nodules could be respectively imputable to an increase and a defect in the angiogenic process. We performed immunohistochemistry analyses to detect the endothelial marker PECAM/CD31, which highlighted a marked reduction in the vascularization of HIF2alpha(1-485) expressing tumours and an amplification of angiogenesis in HIF2alpha ones (Fig. 6a). Quantification of blood vessels (Fig. 6c) within healthy regions of each tumour type revealed that vascular density was markedly increased in HIF2alpha tumours compared to controls nodules (96% increase at day 19, p = 0.05, and 63% increase at day 28, p = 0.006). In contrast, although angiogenesis was comparable between HIF2alpha(1-485) nodules and control ones at day 19, it then diminished in HIF2alpha(1-485) to reach a 54% decrease in the number of blood vessels compared to control tumours at day 28 (p = 0.001).

In the present study, we report that HIF2alpha promotes neuroblastoma cell hypertrophy and reduces their proliferation in vitro. However, we also demonstrate that in vivo, its antiproliferation function acts in combination with an amplification of the angiogenic process to promote the establishment of well-structured neuroblastoma nodules.

To evaluate the role of HIF2alpha in neuroblastoma, we overexpressed its native form or inactivated its function using a DN strategy. We used the well-characterized C-terminal deletion mutant HIF2alpha(1-485), which forms a heterodimer with ARNT, binds to the hypoxia-responsive element (HRE) sequence but lacks the ability to transactivate HRE-driven transcription [20,21]. In light of the parameters studied, we observed reproducible and opposite effects of HIF2alpha and HIF2alpha(1-485) respectively, and equivalent results were obtained with two independent clones of each transfectant. These observations strongly argue for the efficiency and the specificity of this approach. However, it is worth noting that HIF2alpha(1-485) may also prevent HIF1alpha-mediated transcription [21]. In our model, we thus cannot exclude that HIF2alpha(1-485) effects may also be partly due to HIF1alpha inhibition.

We observed a marked effect of HIF2alpha on the modulation of cell size, which was quantified in vitro as well as on histological sections of tumour nodules. The impact of this observation is still unclear, and to the best of our knowledge, such an induction of neuroblastoma cell hypertrophy has never been reported. Interestingly, cellular hypertrophy has been associated with cell cycle arrest in mesangial or vascular smooth muscle cells [22,23]. HIF2alpha enlarged cells also displayed a reduced proliferating rate associated with a diminution in p42/44 MAPK phosphorylation, while proliferation and phospho-p42/44 were increased in small HIF2alpha(1-485) cells. Although this is the first report of an antiproliferative role of HIF2alpha, similar activities of HIF1alpha have already been described in several cells types [4,24,25]. Consequently, these in vitro data led us to conclude that HIF2alpha would present antitumoral activities in neuroblastoma, as previously proposed in breast cancer cells [9] and gliomas [10]. Our in vivo observations led us to reconsider this initial assumption.

We indeed show that overexpression of HIF2alpha leads to a delayed growth of neuroblastoma nodules, characterized by a well-organized structure and a homogeneous histology 5 weeks after inoculation. In contrast, despite an apparent acceleration in tumour growth, 4 week-old HIF2alpha(1-485) neuroblastomas present extensive necrosis associated with a marked reduction in the number of proliferating cells within the apparently healthy tumour territories. Due to ethical restriction, we have not studied HIF2alpha(1-485) tumours beyond this 28-day period. The histological analysis of these tissues, together with the PCNA immunohistochemistry data, were however suggestive of a forthcoming regression, or at least growth arrest, of neuroblastomas expressing HIF2alpha DN. Hence, the antiproliferative role of HIF2alpha appears to allow the favourable formation of well-organized tumour nodules instead of reducing neuroblastoma tumourigenesis, as initially assumed. These findings confirm the complexity of HIF2alpha activity in cancer, which appears to be highly variable depending on the cell-type. In gliomas, Acker et al. observed a comparable negative effect of HIF2alpha on tumour growth, but an exact opposite phenotype on histology, with increased necrosis in HIF2alpha tumours and the presence of micronecrotic areas in HIF2alpha-DN-expressing ones [10].

Finally, we observed that HIF2alpha transfected cells led to the formation of particularly vascularized tumours. In contrast, we observed that there was a clear defect in the long-term angiogenic progression within neuroblastomas formed by HIF2alpha (1-485) cells. These tumours were able to initiate a vascularization process, but after four weeks of growth, they presented a marked reduction in vascular density, which could be expected to be responsible for the growth arrest and the important necrosis we observed. The pro-angiogenic role of HIF2alpha has been established in vivo during embryogenesis [26] and in a wound healing assay [27]. In pathological angiogenesis such a role has been suggested by a wealth of expression studies performed on tissue sections, but remained to be clarified in experimental tumour angiogenesis. Recently, discrepant results have been obtained in two models of ES-cells-derived teratomas, demonstrating a positive effect of HIF2alpha on vascular density [8], or an increase in vessel diameter but no modification of blood vessel density [10]. Our results reveal a pro-angiogenic function of HIF2alpha by increasing blood vessel density in neuroblastoma, probably mediated by VEGF overexpression. The long-term anti-angiogenic effect of HIF2alpha(1-485) demonstrates that this transcription factor's endogenous activity is required for an optimal vascularization of such tumours, putatively by improving the integrity and maintenance of the vascular network. These data support a very recently published study, which reported that high HIF2alpha protein levels were correlated with advanced clinical stage and high VEGF expression and predicted poor prognosis in a clinical neuroblastoma material [28].

Conclusion
###end title 67
###begin p 68
In conclusion, this study confirms the cell-type-dependent heterogeneity of HIF2alpha 's function in cancer and reveals its unexpected antiproliferative role in the N1E-115 neuroblastoma cell line. Instead of inhibiting cancer progression, this function seems to act in combination with a pro-angiogenic activity of this transcription factor to favour the establishment of appropriately fed, well oxygenized, strong and thus potentially aggressive tumours. These complementary functions, acting together, thus emphasize a favourable role of HIF2alpha in neuroblastoma tumourigenesis by providing sustained tumour growth, albeit at a slower rate.
