Chicken globin double-stranded cDNA was synthesised from anaemic adult reticulocyte alpha- and beta-globin mRNA and ligated into the Hind III site of pBR322 using synthetic Hind III decamers. Transformation of E. coli x1776 resulted in the production of a number of alpha- and beta-cDNA clones. One of the alpha-type clones (pCG alpha-8) was fully sequenced and found to code for neither alpha A- nor alpha D-globin. Partial sequencing of the other alpha-cDNA clones indicates that they are all of the same type.
