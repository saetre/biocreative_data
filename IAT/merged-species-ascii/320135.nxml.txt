We have isolated and identified cDNA clones containing part of the coding sequence for rat glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate-dehydrogenase (GAPDH, E.C. 1.2.1.12). By using one of these clones as a probe, we have shown that: i) the abundance of GAPDH mRNA is different in various tissues of the adult rat and in good correlation with the abundance of the enzyme; ii) the transcription rates are quite similar in all tissues tested. We therefore conclude that the tissue-specific differential GAPDH gene expression is regulated by adjusting the abundance of its mRNA at the post-transcriptional level.
