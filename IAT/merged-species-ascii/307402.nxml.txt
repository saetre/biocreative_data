We have purified a DNA helicase (dhel l) from early Drosophila embryos. dhel l co-purifies with the single-stranded DNA binding protein dRP-A over two purification steps, however, the proteins can be separated by their different native molecular weight, with dhel l activity co-sedimenting with a polypeptide of approximately 200 kDa and a sedimentation coefficient of 8.6 S. The enzyme needs ATP hydrolysis and divalent cations for displacement activity. It is very salt sensitive, having a Mg2+ optimum of 0.5 mM and being inhibited by NaCl concentration > 10 mM. Dhel l moves 5'-->3' on the DNA strand to which it is bound. Unwinding activity decreases with increasing length of the double-stranded region suggesting a distributive mode of action. However, addition of dRP-A to the displacement reaction stimulates the activity on substrates with >300 nucleotides double-stranded region suggesting a specific interaction between these two proteins.
