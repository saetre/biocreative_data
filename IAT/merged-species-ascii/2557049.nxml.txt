Here we show that blocking the adhesive function of alphavbeta3 integrin with soluble RGD ligands, such as osteopontin or cilengitide, promoted association of Rab-coupling protein (RCP) with alpha5beta1 integrin and drove RCP-dependent recycling of alpha5beta1 to the plasma membrane and its mobilization to dynamic ruffling protrusions at the cell front. These RCP-driven changes in alpha5beta1 trafficking led to acquisition of rapid/random movement on two-dimensional substrates and to a marked increase in fibronectin-dependent migration of tumor cells into three-dimensional matrices. Recycling of alpha5beta1 integrin did not affect its regulation or ability to form adhesive bonds with substrate fibronectin. Instead, alpha5beta1 controlled the association of EGFR1 with RCP to promote the coordinate recycling of these two receptors. This modified signaling downstream of EGFR1 to increase its autophosphorylation and activation of the proinvasive kinase PKB/Akt. We conclude that RCP provides a scaffold that promotes the physical association and coordinate trafficking of alpha5beta1 and EGFR1 and that this drives migration of tumor cells into three-dimensional matrices.

Cell migration is essential to processes such as embryonic development and wound healing but also drives the pathology of diseases such as cancer. Indeed, one of the features of malignant cells, and one that makes cancer so difficult to treat, is their capacity to migrate invasively through the stroma to form metastases (Sahai, 2005). Cell migration can be random or persistent. In 2D, on stiff substrates, cells tend to adopt a polar form with a leading lamellipodium, whereas in 3D they can assume elongated or amoeboid morphologies (Sahai, 2005). A cell's ability to switch between these migrational modes is likely dictated by the way in which it interacts with and responds to the surrounding ECM. Integrins are heterodimeric transmembrane receptors that physically link the ECM to the intracellular actin cytoskeleton but are also signaling molecules that transduce signals bidirectionally across the plasma membrane (Hynes, 2002). The signaling capacity of certain integrin heterodimers has been linked with particular modes of cell migration. For example, a study on epithelial cells has concluded that activation of Rac downstream of alphavbeta3 integrin promotes slow/persistent migration, whereas engagement of alpha5beta1 that acts via RhoA-ROCK signaling drives rapid/random cell movement (Danen et al., 2005).

Osteopontin is a secreted matrix molecule that becomes incorporated into mineralized bone matrix and a ligand for several cell surface receptors including CD44 and alphavbeta3 integrin (Rangaswami et al., 2006). Increased secretion of osteopontin is associated with a range of malignancies and correlates strongly with tumor progression and metastasis (Rittling and Chambers, 2004; Khodavirdi et al., 2006). Some tumors secrete large quantities of soluble osteopontin, which does not become incorporated into immobile ECM and is, therefore, unlikely to mediate adhesive interactions between cells and the matrix (Rittling et al., 2002). Nevertheless, osteopontin promotes chemotactic cell migration of several cancer cell lines (Tuck et al., 1999). Although it has been shown that osteopontin-driven migration may involve modulation of EGF receptor and c-Src signaling (Tuck et al., 2003; Das et al., 2004), the relationship between the binding of osteopontin to alphav integrins and the acquisition of tumor cell invasive capacity is not known.

Surface integrins are continuously endocytosed, and then efficiently returned (or recycled) back to the plasma membrane (Caswell and Norman, 2006; Jones et al., 2006; Pellinen and Ivaska, 2006). The way in which integrins are recycled dictates the migrational mode of fibroblasts, and this is largely owing to the influence of recycling pathways on alpha5beta1 (White et al., 2007). Small GTPases of the Rab11 family, including Rab11a and Rab25, control recycling of internalized alpha5beta1 (Roberts et al., 2001; Caswell et al., 2007), and this is likely to require the contribution of at least one Rab11 effector protein. The Rab11 family of interacting proteins (Rab11-FIPs) bind to GTP-bound Rab11s and have been shown to be effectors of Rab11 (Hales et al., 2001; Lindsay et al., 2002; Lindsay and McCaffrey, 2002; Wallace et al., 2002; Prekeris, 2003; Peden et al., 2004; Horgan et al., 2007), thus making them potential candidates for components of protein complexes that control alpha5beta1 recycling. The Rab11-FIPs share a highly homologous C-terminal Rab11-binding domain (RBD) and are categorized into two subfamilies according to their domain structures (Wallace et al., 2002; Prekeris, 2003). The three identified class I FIPs (Rab-coupling protein [RCP; aka Rab11-FIP1], Rab11-FIP2, and Rab11-interacting protein [Rip11; aka pp75 and Rab11-FIP5]) possess an N-terminal phosphatidic acid/phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate-binding C2 domain (Lindsay and McCaffrey, 2004a), whereas the two class II FIPs (Rab11-FIP3 and Rab11-FIP4) can bind to Arf6 as well as Rab11s and are thus considered to be effectors for both these classes of GTPase (Hickson et al., 2003; Horgan et al., 2004). It is now becoming clear that Rab11-regulated processes can be linked to cancer (Goldenring et al., 1999). Indeed, Rab25 contributes to the aggressiveness of breast and ovarian cancers (Cheng et al., 2004) and likely achieves this in part by altering the trafficking of alpha5beta1 to promote invasive migration (Caswell et al., 2007). Furthermore, Rab11 controls recycling of alpha6beta4 integrin in breast cancer cells in a way that may contribute to hypoxia-induced invasive migration (Yoon et al., 2005). These findings, in combination with the fact that the gene for RCP is located within a small amplicon (8p11-12) prevalent in breast cancer (Gelsi-Boyer et al., 2005), led us to investigate a potential role for class I Rab11-FIPs in coordinating the trafficking of integrins and other proinvasive receptors as tumor cells migrate in 3D microenvironments in response to tumor-relevant chemokinetic factors such as osteopontin and EGF.

We have previously shown that perturbation of "short-loop" alphavbeta3 recycling leads to a marked increase in alpha5beta1 recycling (White et al., 2007), so we sought to determine whether such reciprocative cross talk between these two integrins also occurs in cancer cells. The basal recycling rate of alpha5beta1 integrin A2780 ovarian cancer cells was similar to fibroblasts, with 25-30% of internalized integrin returned to the plasma membrane within 15 min (Fig. 1 A, left). However, in cells challenged with either cilengitide (a cyclic RGD peptide known to bind to and inhibit alphavbeta3 and alphavbeta5), cRGDfV (a cyclic peptide with selectivity for alphavbeta3 over alphavbeta5 integrin; Dechantsreiter et al., 1999), or the soluble alphavbeta3 ligand osteopontin, alpha5beta1 recycling increased by at least twofold, whereas a control cyclic peptide (cRADfV) was ineffective in this regard (Fig. 1 A, left). Consistent with this, suppression of beta3 levels by RNAi (Fig. S1, available at available at ) increased alpha5beta1 recycling, and treatment of beta3 knockdown cells with either cilengitide or osteopontin did not further enhance alpha5beta1 trafficking (Fig. 1 A, right). Cilengitide did not affect the rate at which alpha5beta1 was internalized by A2780 cells (Fig. S1 B). As cilengitide-driven alpha5beta1 recycling was Rab11 dependent (Fig. S2 A), these data indicate that alphavbeta3 functions constitutively to restrain alpha5beta1 recycling in A2780 ovarian cancer cells and that removal of alphavbeta3 or its occupation/blockade with soluble, non-ECM ligands such as osteopontin or cilengitide releases this constraint to drive Rab11-dependent trafficking of alpha5beta1 to the plasma membrane.

Inhibition of alphavbeta3 promotes alpha5beta1 recycling and association of RCP with alpha5beta1. (A) A2780 cells were transfected with a nontargeting shRNA (sh-CON) or a short hairpin-targeting beta3 integrin (sh-beta3; right) or were left untransfected (left). Cells were surface labeled with 0.2 mg/ml NHS-S-S-Biotin at 4degreesC and internalization was then allowed to proceed for 30 min at 37degreesC. Biotin remaining at the cell surface was removed by exposure to MesNa at 4degreesC, and internalized integrin was chased back to the cell surface at 37degreesC for the indicated times in the absence (BAS) or presence (CIL) of 1 muM cilengitide, 1 muM c-RADfV, 4.4 muM cRGDfV, or 0.5 mug/ml soluble osteopontin. Cells were then reexposed to MesNa and biotinylated integrin was determined by capture ELISA using microtitre wells coated with anti-human alpha5 integrin monoclonal antibodies. The proportion of integrin recycled to the plasma membrane is expressed as a percentage of the pool of integrin labeled during the internalization period. (left) Values are mean +/- SEM; n = 7 (BAS), n = 4 (CIL), and n = 3 (cRADfV, cRGDfV, and OSP) independent experiments. (right) Values are mean +/- SEM; n = 3 independent experiments. (B) A2780 cells were transfected with plasmids encoding GFP or GFP fused to the class I FIPs (GFP-RCP, GFP-FIP2, and GFP-Rip11). Transfected cells were incubated in the absence (BAS) or presence (CIL) of 1 muM cilengitide for 20 min and lysed in a buffer containing 0.15% Tween-20. GFP and GFP fusion proteins were immunoprecipitated from lysates by incubation with beads coupled to a monoclonal antibody recognizing GFP, and these immunoprecipitates analyzed for the presence of alpha5beta1 and alphavbeta3 by immunoblotting with antibodies recognizing the integrin alpha5 and beta3 chains, respectively. The loading of GFP and GFP fusions was confirmed by immunoblotting with an antibody recognizing GFP (bottom). (C) Cells were transfected with GFP-RCP (top) or left untransfected (bottom), and then incubated in the absence (BAS) or presence (CIL) of 1 muM cilengitide for 20 min. Lysates were immunoprecipitated using monoclonal antibodies recognizing alpha5beta1 integrin (anti-alpha5), alphavbeta3 integrin (anti-beta3), or an isotype-matched control antibody (RG-16). The presence of alpha5 and beta3 integrin, GFP-RCP, and endogenous RCP were detected by immunoblotting. (D) After cotransfection of GFP or GFP-RCP with either nontargeting shRNA (shRNA-CON) or a short hairpin targeting beta3 integrin (shRNA-beta3), A2780 cells were incubated in the absence (BAS) or presence (CIL) of 1 muM cilengitide or 0.5 mug/ml osteopontin (OSP) for 20 min. Cells were lysed and anti-GFP immunoprecipitates probed for the presence of alpha5beta1 and GFP as in B. (E) A2780 cells were transfected with GFP, GFP-RCPwt, or GFP-RCP621E, treated with cilengitide, and then lysed. Anti-GFP immunoprecipitates were probed for alpha5beta1 and GFP as in B.

Because physical associations may be formed between Rab effectors and their cargoes (Fan et al., 2004), we immunoprecipitated members of the class I family of Rab11 effectors from A2780 cells and probed for the presence of alpha5beta1 and alphavbeta3 integrins. This revealed that RCP associated with both alpha5beta1 and alphavbeta3 integrins (Fig. 1 B) and pretreatment of the cells with cilengitide (Fig. 1, B and D) or osteopontin (Fig. 1 D) strongly promoted coprecipitation of RCP with alpha5beta1 but reduced its association with alphavbeta3 (Fig. 1 B). Increased association of alpha5beta1 and RCP was detectable within 8 min and was maximal after 20-min exposure to cilengitide (Fig. S3 A, available at ). To further confirm these associations, we immunoprecipitated alpha5beta1 and alphavbeta3 using antibodies recognizing alpha5 and beta3 integrin, respectively. Western blots of these immunoprecipitates indicated that both endogenous and overexpressed RCP coprecipitated with alpha5beta1 and alphavbeta3 (but not with a control antibody) and that addition of cilengitide strongly promoted RCP's association with alpha5beta1, but correspondingly weakened binding to alphavbeta3 (Fig. 1 C). Suppression of beta3 expression by RNAi also increased association between RCP and alpha5beta1, and treatment of beta3 knockdown cells with cilengitide or osteopontin did not further enhance this (Fig. 1 D). Furthermore, RCP621E, containing a point mutation within the RBD of RCP rendering it unable to interact with Rab11 (and therefore to be considered a dominant-negative inhibitor of RCP function), did not associate with alpha5beta1 (Fig. 1 E), indicating that Rab11 likely contributes to alpha5beta1-RCP complex formation.

Although cilengitide promoted alpha5beta1 recycling in cells expressing control RNAi or those overexpressing RCPwt, it was completely unable to drive alpha5beta1 recycling after RCP knockdown or expression of dominant-negative RCP621E (Fig. 2 A). The corresponding dominant-negative mutants of Rip11 or Rab11-FIP2 (Rip11630E and FIP2481E) had no effect on cilengitide-induced alpha5beta1 recycling (Fig. S2 B), and RCP621E did not compromise trafficking of the transferrin receptor (Tfn-R) in the presence or absence of cilengitide (Fig. S2 C). Internalization of alpha5beta1 was not affected by expression of dominant-negative RCP (Fig. S1 B). These data indicate that RCP displays selectivity toward the recycling of specific cargoes (i.e., alpha5beta1 not Tfn-R) that follow Rab11-dependent routes to the cell surface and that RCP is likely to be the only class I FIP that has a role in trafficking alpha5beta1.

Cilengitide and osteopontin drive alterations in alpha5beta1 recycling and cell migration that are dependent on RCP. (A) A2780 cells were transfected with a nontargeting shRNA (shRNA-CON), a short hairpin targeting RCP (shRNA-RCP), GFP-RCPwt, or dominant-negative GFP-RCP621E. Recycling of alpha5beta1 integrin was determined in the presence and absence of 1 muM cilengitide as for Fig. 1 A. Values are mean +/- SEM; n = 3 independent experiments. (B) Cells were transfected with GFP-RCPwt or GFP-RCP621E and allowed to grow to confluence. Confluent monolayers were wounded with a plastic pipette tip and the cells were allowed to migrate into the wound in the absence (Basal) or presence of 1 muM cilengitide (Cil) or 0.5 mug/ml osteopontin (Osp). The cells were observed by time-lapse video microscopy, the movement of individual cells followed using cell tracking software, and this is presented as overlays of representative trajectories described by cells during the first 9 h of their migration into the wound. The starting position of each cell is denoted by the red dot. Examples of time-lapse movies that correspond to these experiments are included as Videos 1-3 as indicated (available at ). The persistence and speed of migration were extracted from the track plots. Persistence is defined as the ratio of the vectorial distance traveled to the total path length described by the cell. Values are mean +/- SEM; n = 3 independent experiments. Bar, 50 mum.

As increased alpha5beta1 recycling causes fibroblasts to switch from persistent to random migration (White et al., 2007), we analyzed the movement of A2780 cells as they migrated into scratch wounds. A2780 cells migrated persistently after wounding (Video 1, available at ), but treatment with either cilengitide (Video 2) or osteopontin induced a significantly more rapid but less persistent mode of migration, and alpha5beta1 was required for the increase in speed (Fig. 2 B). In the absence of cilengitide, expression of RCP621E did not effect cell migration. However, RCP621E (but not dominant-negative Rab11-FIP2 or Rip11) completely opposed the cilengitide- or osteopontin-driven increase in migration speed (Fig. 2 B), such that in the combined presence of the cyclic peptide and dominant-negative RCP the cells appeared to wobble on the spot and were largely unable to move away from their original positions (Video 3).

Fluorescence time-lapse imaging revealed that migrating A2780 cells adopted a fanlike morphology in which the actin-rich lamellipodium advanced in an organized, processive fashion, with retrograde movement of filaments back from the leading edge being clearly visible (Video 4, available at ). Furthermore, 3D reconstruction of serial z stack confocal images indicated that the F-actin-rich lamellipodial tip of migrating A2780 cells did not rise much above the surface of the substratum (Fig. 3 A, left). However, upon challenge with cilengitide or osteopontin, or when alphavbeta3 was suppressed by RNAi, the morphology of migrating A2780 cells was drastically altered, with an apparent collapse of the lamellipodium and the presence of anterior protrusions containing alpha5beta1 integrin, RCP, and F-actin (Fig. S4). 3D reconstructions indicated that these protrusions were composed of numerous actin-rich ruffles that extended upward from the cell front (Fig. 3 A, middle and right). Fluorescence time-lapse imaging showed these cilengitide- and osteopontin-driven structures to be very actively protrusive and always anterior to the direction of migration (Videos 4-6), indicating that they were neither dorsal ruffles nor retracting lamellae, but likely locomoting structures contributing to the cell's forward motion. Moreover, expression of dominant-negative RCP (but not dominant-negative FIP2 or Rip11) blocked the ability of A2780 cells to extend these anterior ruffling protrusions (Fig. 3 B), indicating a requirement for RCP (but not other class I Rab11-FIPs) in this type of cell migration.

The capacity of alpha5beta1 to support migration in 3D matrices is dictated by the way in which it is trafficked. Indeed, alpha5beta1 and FN inhibit invasive migration of Fos-transformed fibroblasts through matrigel (Spence et al., 2006). However, expression of Rab25 changes the way in which alpha5beta1 is trafficked such that alpha5beta1 supports migration of Fos-transformed fibroblasts through 3D FN-containing matrices (Caswell et al., 2007). We, therefore, sought to determine whether cilengitide-driven, RCP-dependent changes in alpha5beta1 trafficking were sufficient to promote migration into 3D matrices. When alphavbeta3 was not inhibited, migration of A2780 cells was unaffected by addition of FN to the matrigel (Fig. 4 A). However, addition of cilengitide or osteopontin strongly promoted FN-dependent migration of A2780 cells into matrigel plugs (Fig. 4 A). Experiments using blocking antibodies and RNAi of integrin subunits indicated that this component of migration was dependent on the presence and RGD ligand-binding capacity of alpha5beta1 integrin (Fig. 4 B). Depletion of beta3 integrin with RNAi strongly promoted FN-dependent migration into matrigel (in the absence of FN, beta3 knockdown suppressed migration), and neither cilengitide nor osteopontin were able to further increase this (Fig. 4 A). Although basal migration of A2780 cells did not require RCP, the cilengitide-driven increase in migration through matrigel was suppressed by dominant-negative RCP621E or short hairpin RNA (shRNA) of RCP (Fig. 4 C), but was not affected by the corresponding mutants of Rab11-FIP2 or Rip11 (Fig. S5 A, available at ).

Inhibition of alphavbeta3 promotes migration into matrigel that is dependent on RCP and engagement of alpha5beta1 with FN. (A) Migration of A2780 cells expressing a nontargeting shRNA (shRNA-Con) or a short hairpin targeting beta3 integrin (shRNA-beta3) into a matrigel plug in the presence and absence of 25 mug/ml FN was determined using an inverted matrigel plug assay. 1 muM cilengitide (CIL) and 0.5 mug/ml osteopontin (OSP) were added as indicated to the matrigel and to both the upper and lower chambers of the inverted matrigel plug assay. Invading cells were stained with Calcein AM and visualized by confocal microscopy. Serial optical sections were captured at 15-mum intervals and are presented as a sequence in which the individual optical sections are placed alongside one another with increasing depth from left to right as indicated. Migration was quantitated by measuring the fluorescence intensity of cells penetrating the matrigel to depths of 45 mum and greater and expressing this as a percentage of the total fluorescence intensity of all cells within the plug. Data represents mean +/- SEM from three independent experiments. (B) The involvement of alpha5beta1 integrin in migration driven by addition of cilengitide (left and right) or induced by suppression of alphavbeta3 levels (middle) was determined by addition of the indicated integrin- and FN-blocking antibodies (left and middle) and also by RNAi of the alpha5 and beta1 subunits of alpha5beta1 (right). Migration was quantified as for A. Values are mean +/- SEM from three independent experiments. (C) The migration of A2780 cells expressing nontargeting shRNA (shRNA-CON), a short hairpin targeting RCP integrin (shRNA-RCP), GFP, GFP-RCPwt, or GFP-RCP621E into FN-containing matrigel was determined and quantified as for A.

To determine how cilengitide promotes cell migration in 3D, while minimizing the technical difficulties in imaging cell migration within dense 3D microenvironments, we analyzed the migration of cells plated onto cell-derived matrix. We have previously found that expression of Rab25 induced A2780 cells to be more invasive and to switch their mode of migration to one that is characterized by the extension of long pseudopods (Caswell et al., 2007). As previously observed, A2780 cells migrated rapidly across cell-derived matrices and maintained their overall sluglike morphology as they moved (Fig. 5 A and Video 7, available at ). Addition of cilengitide altered the morphology of cells migrating on 3D matrices to extend long pseudopods in the direction of migration (Fig. 5, A and B; and Video 8). When alphavbeta3 was not inhibited, migration on cell-derived matrix had no requirement for RCP (Fig. 5 A), but expression of RCP621E completely abrogated cilengitide-driven pseudopodial extension and markedly decreased both the speed and persistence of cell movement (Fig. 5, A and B; and Video 9). The dynamic localization of RCP within migrating cells was also strikingly altered by treatment with cilengitide. In untreated cells, GFP-RCP localized to the perinuclear region and to vesicles distributed fairly uniformly throughout the cytoplasm (Fig. 5 C). However, after addition of cilengitide, GFP-RCP (but not dominant-negative GFP-RCP621E) was recruited to the tip of the extending pseudopod (Fig. 5 C). Although there was considerable movement of RCP-positive tubulovesicular structures in and out of the pseudopodial region, the RCP-containing structures at the distal pseudopod tip appeared to be relatively immobile and closely associated with the plasma membrane. Collectively, these data indicate that inhibition of alphavbeta3 strongly promotes RCP-dependent trafficking of alpha5beta1 integrin, which alters cellular morphology to favor rapid/random movement on plastic surfaces and a pseudopodial-driven mode of migration on a 3D matrix.

Regulation of integrin internalization and recycling may influence cell adhesion and migration by controlling the level of heterodimer exposed at the plasma membrane. Addition of cilengitide and expression of mutant RCPs influence the amount of alpha5beta1 expressed at the cell surface (Fig. S5 B), but do so only modestly and to a degree that is consistent with the way that they alter recycling from a relatively small (approximately15-20% of the quantity of surface receptor [not depicted]) intracellular pool of alpha5beta1 integrin. We had, therefore, previously hypothesized that endosomal pathways may not function primarily to control the quantity of surface receptors, but that they regulate integrin function in other ways, for example, by "cleaning" internalized integrins of bound ligand, thus maintaining ligand-binding competency (Caswell and Norman, 2006; White et al., 2007). To analyze the effect of recycling on integrin function we used a spinning disc approach, which measures the mean shear stress (tau50) required for cell detachment (Garcia et al., 1998). Because tau50 is proportional to the number of alpha5beta1 and alphavbeta3 integrins per cell that are occupied in adhesive bonds, this provides a direct measure of integrin adhesive function (Boettiger et al., 2001; Shi and Boettiger, 2003; Boettiger, 2007). The generation of tau50 from curve fits of the spinning data (Fig. 6 A) was used to generate a comparison of integrin bond levels (Fig. 6 B). Addition of cilengitide reduced the total adhesion, as measured by the spinning disc, by approximately14% consistent with the contribution that is typically made to adhesion by alphavbeta3 in cells expressing both alphavbeta3 and alpha5beta1. As shown in Fig. 3 A, inhibition of RCP reduces cilengitide-driven alpha5beta1 recycling by at least threefold. Therefore, if recycling were to influence alpha5beta1's ligand-binding capacity, one would anticipate a large alteration in adhesion strength after inhibition of RCP. However, expression of RCP621E effected only a small change (10-15% reduction) in adhesion strength (Fig. 6 B), indicating that the quantity and strength of integrin-ligand adhesive bonds is proportional to the level of surface expression (Fig. S5 B) and not to the proportion of integrin recycled. Because RCP does not influence the ligand-binding capacity of alpha5beta1, it is likely that there are alternative explanations for the ability of this type of recycling to promote cell migration and invasiveness.

RCP does not affect integrin ligand-binding ability but mediates an association between alpha5beta1 and EGFR1. (A and B) A2780 cells were transfected with either RCPwt or the dominant-negative RCP621E and incubated for 24 h +/-1 muM cilengitide for the last 16 h. Adhesion to FN was analyzed using the spinning disc. (A) The analysis of cell density at 61 points for each treatment as a function of wall shear stress (tau50) is shown. The associated curve fit (solid lines) R2 values for the fits are 0.95 (RCPwt with cilengitide) and 0.92 (RCP621E with cilengitide). The curve fits were used to extract a mean shear stress for cell detachment (tau50) that is proportional to the number of adhesive integrin-ligand bonds (Boettiger, 2007). (B) The combined analyses for tau50 from three independent experiments run in triplicate are shown; normalized percentages are on the bars. Values are mean +/- SEM (n = 8 or 9). (C) Cells were transfected with hairpin vectors targeting beta3 integrin, alpha5 integrin, or EGFR1 in combination with GFP, GFP-RCPwt, or GFP-RCP621E (left), or were left untransfected (right). After incubation with 1 muM cilengitide (CIL) or 0.5 mug/ml osteopontin (OSP), cells were lysed and GFP-RCP or alpha5beta1 was immunoprecipitated from the lysates using monoclonal antibodies recognizing GFP (anti-GFP), alpha5 integrin (anti-alpha5), or an isotype-matched control antibody (RG-16). The presence of alpha5 integrin, GFP-RCP, endogenous RCP, and EGFR1 in the immunoprecipitates was then detected by immunoblotting. (D-F) A2780 cells were transfected with a short hairpin-targeting beta3 integrin (shRNA-beta3; F) or were left untransfected (D and E). Confluent monolayers were wounded and the cells were allowed to migrate into the wound in the absence (D and F) or presence (E) of 1 muM cilengitide. The distribution of EGFR1 (green), RCP (red), and F-actin (blue) was visualized by immunofluorescence followed by confocal microscopy. Bar, 30 mum.

As the endosomal pathway is known to have profound influence on the way that many receptors communicate with their downstream effectors (von Zastrow and Sorkin, 2007), it is possible that integrin recycling alters cell migration by influencing the assembly of signalosomes that mediate receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) signaling. To investigate this possibility we probed RCP immunoprecipitates with antibodies recognizing phosphotyrosine. Although cytoskeletal phosphotyrosine-containing proteins such as paxillin were not present in RCP immunoprecipitates (Fig. S3 B), we consistently observed a high molecular mass phosphotyrosine-rich band with the approximate molecular mass of EGFR1 (not depicted). Indeed, addition of cilengitide, osteopontin, or RNAi of beta3 drove alpha5beta1 and EGFR1 into a coprecipitable complex with endogenous or overexpressed RCP (Fig. 6 C), and this correlated closely with recruitment of EGFR1 to F-actin-rich protrusions at the cell front and its colocalization with RCP at these structures (Fig. 6, D-F). Given this coprecipitation of alpha5beta1 with RCP and EGFR1, we sought to determine whether RCP was acting as a molecular bridge to connect alpha5beta1 and EGFR1. First, we found that alpha5-RNAi prevented coprecipitation of EGFR1 with RCP, whereas EGFR1-RNAi did not reduce association of RCP with alpha5beta1 (Fig. 6 C). Second, we deployed the mutant RCP379-649 that lacks an N-terminal portion of the protein, including the C2 domain, but retains the C terminus and Rab11-binding domain. Interestingly, this truncated RCP associated with alpha5beta1 integrin but had no capacity to coprecipitate with EGFR1 (Fig. 6 C). Furthermore, dominant-negative RCP621E did not coprecipitate with either alpha5 or EGFR1 (Fig. 6 C) and RNAi of RCP prevented coprecipitation of EGFR1 with alpha5beta1 (not depicted). Collectively, these data indicate that the C terminus of RCP interacts with alpha5beta1 to permit an association between the N terminus of RCP with EGFR1, thus bringing these two receptors together into a coprecipitable complex.

The presence of such a physical association between alpha5beta1, RCP, and EGFR1 prompted us to investigate the role of RCP in coordination of alpha5beta1 and EGFR1 trafficking. Cilengitide, osteopontin, cRGDfV, and beta3-RNAi promoted EGFR1 recycling to a similar extent as was previously observed for alpha5beta1, and knockdown of RCP prevented this (Fig. 7 A). Furthermore, addition of cilengitide and/or expression of dominant-negative RCP did not affect internalization of EGFR1 by A2780 cells (Fig. S1 B). Suppression of alpha5 integrin by RNAi blocked the cilengitide-induced increase in EGFR1 recycling, whereas knockdown of EGFR1 had no effect on recycling of alpha5beta1 (Fig. 7 B). Furthermore, expression of RCP379-649 (which can associate with alpha5beta1 but not EGFR1) had minimal effect on cilengitide-driven alpha5beta1 recycling, but severely impaired EGFR1 recycling (Fig. 7 C). Collectively, these data indicate that cilengitide-driven recycling of EGFR1 is strongly dependent on alpha5beta1 (but not vice versa) and that effective recycling of EGFR1 requires its association with RCP.

EGFR1-RNAi inhibited the ability of A2780 cells to migrate into matrigel under all circumstances investigated (unpublished data), indicating a requirement for EGFR1 in the invasive process. To determine the role of trafficking to EGFR1's contribution to migration in 3D, we investigated the consequences of expressing RCP379-649 (which has little effect on alpha5beta1 recycling but compromises trafficking of EGFR1) on the ability of cilengitide to drive movement of cells into matrigel. Expression of RCP379-649 did not affect the basal migration of A2780 cells but inhibited the ability of cilengitide to drive cells into FN-containing matrix (Fig. 7 D). Moreover, although GFP-RCP379-649 was localized to vesicular structures toward the cell front (indicating that integrin binding mediates the recruitment of RCP to extending processes), this truncated RCP caused pseudopod bifurcation, suggesting that combined recruitment of EGFR1 and alpha5beta1 is necessary for maintenance of pseudopodial dominance, which is in turn required for cilengitide-driven migration in 3D (Fig. 5 C).

Cilengitide addition and expression of dominant-negative RCP does not greatly affect the exposure of EGFR1 at the cell surface (Fig. S5 B). However, the way in which receptors are trafficked is now established to modulate the downstream signaling profile of several RTKs (von Zastrow and Sorkin, 2007). Indeed, we found that pretreatment of A2780 cells with osteopontin or cilengitide or beta3-RNAi (all of which enhance EGFR1 recycling) strongly potentiated the ability of EGF to drive EGFR1 autophosphorylation (Fig. 8, A and B). Pretreatment of cells with either osteopontin or cilengitide enhanced downstream signals to PKB/Akt but phosphorylation of ERK1/2 remained at basal levels (Fig. 8, A and B). Because osteopontin or cilengitide-driven EGFR1 recycling required alpha5beta1 and the association of EGFR1 with RCP, we investigated the involvement of alpha5 and RCP in EGFR1 signaling. Either RCP- or alpha5-RNAi or expression of RCP379-649 blocked the ability of osteopontin to potentiate EGF-driven EGFR1 autophosphorylation and activation of PKB/Akt (Fig. 8 C). Collectively, these data indicate that after inhibition of alphavbeta3-mediated cell adhesion, EGFR1 was recruited into a physical complex with alpha5beta1 and RCP, which enhances EGFR1 recycling to the plasma membrane and its ability to autophosphorylate and to signal via PKB/Akt.

Osteopontin enhances EGFR1 signaling via a mechanism that requires alpha5beta1, RCP, and association of EGFR1 with RCP. Cells were transfected with short hairpin vectors targeting beta3, alpha5, beta1, RCP or EGFR1 or with truncated GFP-RCP379-649 as indicated. Cells were serum starved overnight followed by a 40-min treatment with either 1 muM cilengitide or 0.5 mug/ml osteopontin. The cells were then challenged with EGF for the indicated times and lysed. Levels of active phosphoTyr845-EGFR1, phosphoSer473-Akt, and phosphoThr202/phosphoTyr204-ERK were determined by Western blotting. Protein loading of beta-actin, Akt1, and EGFR1 was confirmed by Western blotting.

Fibroblasts and some tumor cells can move upon plastic or glass substrates in different ways (Pankov et al., 2005). Cells can migrate with persistence, allowing their translocation for considerable distances from the starting point. Alternatively, some cells move rapidly but with low persistence, thus remaining nearer their starting point. Previous analyses have shown that persistent migration occurs on FN substrates when alphavbeta3 is the dominant integrin, but when alpha5beta1 dominates cells move more rapidly but with reduced persistence (Danen et al., 2005). We have shown that alterations in the relative rates at which alphavbeta3 and alpha5beta1 traffic through the endosomal pathway can switch between slow/persistent and rapid/random migration in fibroblasts (White et al., 2007). When alphavbeta3 is cycling rapidly and is competent to engage ligand, the recycling of alpha5beta1 is slow and cells migrate persistently. Alternatively, when alphavbeta3 trafficking is disrupted, alpha5beta1 recycling is increased and this reduces migrational persistence. Here, we report that treatment of tumor cells with endogenous (soluble osteopontin) and pharmacological (cilengitide and c-RGDfV) antagonists of alphavbeta3 increases the rate at which alpha5beta1 is transported from endosomes to the plasma membrane. This increased recycling requires the association of RCP with alpha5beta1 and thus this Rab11 effector represents a key component of an integrin cross talk system that controls a switch between alphavbeta3- and alpha5beta1-mediated migrational modes. Remarkably, we find that although alpha5beta1-driven migration has little persistence on plastic or glass surfaces (2D), it corresponds to increased migration into a FN-rich 3D gel. Moreover, this type of cell movement was characterized by the extension of long pseudopods at the cell front as cells migrate on a 3D matrix, and RCP was concentrated at the tips of these invasive structures. This implies that alpha5beta1 functions to promote tumor cell invasion and metastasis in vivo, with alphavbeta3 acting to restrain this.

The role of integrin recycling in this switching between alphavbeta3- and alpha5beta1-mediated migration suggested that the recycling process itself was affecting integrin function. Although differences in the total levels of surface integrin could not explain the differences, it was possible that integrins required recycling to reactivate or to remove bound ligand fragments (Caswell and Norman, 2006). To test this hypothesis, we have measured the effect of cilengitide-induced recycling of alpha5beta1 integrin (and its inhibition by dominant-negative RCP) on alpha5beta1 surface expression and its ability to form adhesive bonds with substrate FN. The formation and the strength of the adhesive bonds was affected only to the extent expected for the contributions of alphavbeta3 and the small reduction of surface alpha5beta1 levels caused by inhibition of recycling. Unlike the common static adhesion assays, this assay measures the force required for cell detachment, which is directly proportional to the number of adhesive integrin bonds (Shi and Boettiger, 2003; Boettiger, 2007). Therefore, recycling had no effect on ligand binding and adhesive function of alpha5beta1 integrin.

The absence of an effect of trafficking on integrin adhesive function led us to examine the influence of alpha5beta1 recycling on cell signaling. Studies on tumor angiogenesis in mice show clearly that knockout of beta3 leads to increased endothelial cell proliferation and migration owing to increased VEGFR2 signaling (Reynolds et al., 2004). Other studies have described physical complexes formed by integrins and RTKs, but the way in which these associations may regulate signaling is not clear (Schneller et al., 1997; Soldi et al., 1999). Here we have found that RCP is required to bring alpha5beta1 and EGFR1 together into a physical complex and, although our results do not resolve all of the details of the RCP-alpha5beta1-EGFR1 complex (such as whether these associations involve direct molecular contacts between alpha5beta1 and RCP and EGFR1 and RCP, respectively), we have determined how the trafficking of EGFR1 is coordinated with alpha5beta1. Clearly knockdown of alpha5beta1 opposes the coprecipitation of RCP with EGFR1, indicating that recruitment of RCP's C-terminal region to alpha5beta1 may likely be a prerequisite for subsequent association of the N terminus of RCP with EGFR1 and for subsequent enhanced EGFR1 recycling. In this regard, it is possible that alpha5beta1 is acting as a "receptor" for RCP to guide this Rab effector to a membrane subdomain, whereupon a secondary association with EGFR1 is formed.

Efficient signaling from EGFR1 to the Ras-MEK-ERK axis requires receptor internalization, and a close association between EGFR1 and components of the MAPK cascade has been observed to occur at late endosomes (von Zastrow and Sorkin, 2007). Conversely, it appears that EGFR1-stimulated activation of phosphoinositide-3 kinase most likely occurs at or near the plasma membrane and that communication between EGFR1 and PKB/Akt is terminated after receptor endocytosis (Haugh and Meyer, 2002). In view of this, we propose that RCP-dependent recycling acts to slow the rate at which EGFR1 reaches later endosomes where sustained activation of MAPKs occurs and favors its localization to the plasma membrane or recycling compartments where the receptor can recruit phosphoinositide-3 kinase and thereby activate PKB/Akt. Indeed a recent study has found that c-Src promotes the trafficking of FGF receptor from endosomes to the plasma membrane and that this favors activation of PKB/Akt over signaling to the MEK-ERK axis (Sandilands et al., 2007). We find that c-Src binds to RCP and that this kinase is required for integrin and RTK recycling (unpublished data). Osteopontin enhances EGFR1 signaling in a way that involves c-Src (Das et al., 2004), which in light of the data presented here is likely to be mediated by RCP-dependent effects on alpha5beta1 and EGFR1 trafficking. Furthermore, we find that RTK recycling and signaling is influenced by RCP/alpha5beta1 in other cell types, including VEGFR2 in endothelial cells and FGF receptor in fibroblasts (unpublished data). It is interesting to note that the genes for RCP and FGF receptor 1 are located close to one another within the 8p11-12 chromosomal region that is amplified in several cancers, including some breast tumors (Gelsi-Boyer et al., 2005). In this regard, it will be necessary to determine the molecular details of this apparently promiscuous association of RTKs with the RCP-alpha5beta1 complex and how this influences their trafficking and signaling in cancer types where the 8p11-12 chromosomal locus is amplified.

In phase I and II clinical trails cilengitide has elicited some enduring responses in glioma patients (Nabors et al., 2007), but the results for other types of cancer are not encouraging (Friess et al., 2006; Hariharan et al., 2007). Indeed, the role that alphavbeta3 plays in cancer-relevant processes is controversial, as some studies implicate alphavbeta3 as a proangiogenic integrin (Brooks et al., 1994), whereas other work contradicts this (Reynolds et al., 2002). Our findings support both pro- and antiinvasive roles for alphavbeta3, as knockdown of alphavbeta3 can reduce A2780 cell migration but only in the absence of FN or when RCP-dependent processes are compromised. Conversely, when FN is abundant and alpha5beta1 and RCP are present (as is the case in many tumor types), inhibition of alphavbeta3 strongly promotes tumor cell migration, thus overriding the capacity for this integrin to function as an antimigratory molecule. We consistently find that cellular responses to cilengitide, c-RGDfV, small molecule inhibitors of alphavbeta3 (unpublished data), and osteopontin are indistinguishable from one another (and from beta3 knockdown), indicating the possibility that the lack of efficacy of anti-alphavbeta3 compounds in cancer may be owing to the capacity of these molecules to mimic the prometastatic effects of osteopontin.

In conclusion, our surprising finding that inhibition of alphavbeta3 leads to increased tumor cell migration in 3D microenvironments, and the elucidation of the RCP-alpha5beta1-EGFR1-dependent mechanisms that drive this, highlight the need to fully understand how integrin trafficking regulates cell migration if the therapeutic potential of anti-integrin agents is to be maximized.

A2780 cells were lysed in lysis buffer (200 mM NaCl, 75 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7, 15 mM NaF, 1.5 mM Na3VO4, 7.5 mM EDTA, 7.5 mM EGTA, 0.15% (vol/vol) Tween-20, 50 mug/ml leupeptin, 50 mug/ml aprotinin, and 1 mM 4-(2-aminoethyl)-benzenesulfonyl fluoride). Lysates were passed three times through a 27-gauge needle and clarified by centrifugation at 10,000 g for 10 min at 4degreesC. Magnetic beads conjugated to sheep anti-mouse IgG (Invitrogen) were bound to anti-integrin (anti-alpha5 or anti-beta3; BD Biosciences), anti-GFP (Abcam), or control monoclonal (RG-16; Sigma-Aldrich) antibodies. Antibody-coated beads were incubated with lysates for 2 h at 4degreesC with constant rotation. Unbound proteins were removed by extensive washing in lysis buffer, and specifically associated proteins were eluted from the beads by boiling for 10 min in Laemmli sample buffer. Proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE and analyzed by Western blotting as described previously (Roberts et al., 2001). Antibodies used for Western blotting were as follows: anti-alpha5 integrin (BD Biosciences), anti-beta1 integrin (BD Biosciences), anti-beta3 integrin (BD Biosciences; blots using this antibody were run under nonreducing conditions), anti-RCP (Genway), anti-EGFR1 (BD Biosciences) and anti-GFP (Abcam).

Inverted matrigel assays were performed as described previously (Hennigan et al., 1994). In brief, matrigel supplemented with 25 mug/ml FN as indicated was allowed to polymerize in transwell inserts (Corning) for 1 h at 37degreesC. Inserts were then inverted and cells were seeded directly onto the opposite face of the filter. Transwell inserts were finally placed in serum-free medium, and medium supplemented with 10% FCS and 30 ng/ml EGF was placed on top of the matrix, providing a chemotactic gradient. Where appropriate, 1 muM cilengitide, 0.5 mug/ml osteopontin, and 1.0 mug/ml of integrin/FN-blocking antibodies were added to the matrigel before plug polymerization and also to the medium throughout the system. 48 h after seeding, migrating cells were stained with Calcein AM and visualized by confocal microscopy with serial optical sections being captured at 15-mum intervals.

Cell-derived matrix was generated as described previously (Cukierman et al., 2001; Bass et al., 2007). In brief, gelatin-coated tissue culture-ware was cross-linked with glutaraldehyde, quenched, and equilibrated in DME containing 10% FCS. Primary cultured human dermal fibroblasts were seeded at near confluence (approximately2 x 104 cells/cm2) and grown for 10 d in DME containing 10% FCS and 50 mug/ml ascorbic acid. Matrices were denuded of living cells by incubation with PBS containing 20 mM NH4OH and 0.5% Triton X-100, and DNA residue was removed by incubation with DNaseI. Matrices were blocked with 0.1% heat-denatured BSA before seeding of cells.

Internalization and recycling assays were performed after 30-45 min of serum starvation and subsequently conducted, including the internalization and recycling periods, in the absence of serum. Integrin and EGFR1 internalization and recycling assays were performed as described previously (Roberts et al., 2001). Internalization assays were performed in the presence of 0.6 mM of primaquine as described in Roberts et al. (2001). For measurement of recycling, the receptor internalization conditions were 30 min at 37degreesC for all experiments. The antibodies used for capture ELISA detection of alpha5beta1 integrin and EGFR1 were obtained from BD Biosciences. Cilengitide, osteopontin, cRADfV, and cRGDfV were added to the cells only during the recycling period.

125I-labeled transferrin recycling assays were performed essentially as described in van Dam and Stoorvogel (2002) with some modifications. In brief, serum-starved cells were incubated with 125I-labeled transferrin (0.1 muCi/well; PerkinElmer) for 1 h at 4degreesC in PBS with 1% (wt/vol) BSA. The tracer was allowed to internalize for 30 min at 37degreesC (to label the recycling compartment). Tracer remaining at the cell surface was removed by incubation with acid PBS (corrected to pH 4.0 by the addition of HCl) at 4degreesC for 6 min, and the tracer was allowed to recycle at 37degreesC in serum-free DME supplemented with 1% BSA and 50 muM desferoxamine (Sigma-Aldrich). The quantity of 125I recycled into the medium is expressed as a percentage of the number of counts incorporated during the internalization period.

Confluent monolayers were wounded with a plastic pipette tip and placed on the stage of an inverted microscope (Axiovert S100; Carl Zeiss, Inc.) in an atmosphere of 5% CO2 at 37degreesC. Cells were observed using a 20x phase-contrast objective and images were collected every 20 min using a digital camera (C4742-95; Hamamatsu Photonics). Movies were generated and cell tracks were analyzed using Bioimaging software (Andor). For fluorescence time-lapse imaging, cells were plated onto 6-well plates or glass-bottomed 3-cm plates (coated with cell-derived matrix as appropriate) and incubated at 37degreesC until cells adhered and began migrating (4 h). Cells were imaged using a 10x objective and an inverted microscope in an atmosphere of 5% CO2 at 37degreesC or a 64x objective and an inverted confocal microscope (Fluoview FV1000; Olympus) in an atmosphere of 5% CO2 at 37degreesC. For immunofluorescence, cell were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 10 min and then permeabilized in PBS containing 0.2% Triton X-100. Primary antibodies for immunofluorescence were alpha5 integrin (BD Biosciences), RCP (Genway), and EGFR1 (BD Biosciences) with F-actin being detected using BODIPY650/665-phalloidin (Invitrogen). Immunofluorescence was imaged using a 64x objective and an inverted confocal microscope. Images from the confocal microscope were imported into Photoshop (Adobe) and linear-only adjustments made to their brightness and contrast.

A2780 cells transfected with RCPwt or RCP621E were plated overnight in complete medium +/- 1 muM cilengitide for the last 16 h. Cells were dissociated with 2 mM EDTA and single cell suspensions were added to FN-coated (5 mug/ml) glass coverslips and incubated at 25degreesC for 60 min. Coverslips were placed on the spinning disc device and exposed to a linear hydrodynamic shear gradient for 5 min (Boettiger, 2007). Coverslips were removed from the spinning device, fixed in formalin, permeabilized, and stained with DAPI. 61 fields at 15 different radial positions plus the center were counted for 1-mum-diameter fields and plotted as a function of shear stress. Curve fits were performed using SigmaPlot 7.0 using the formula f = 1/{a - exp[b (t - c)]}, where f is the fraction of adherent cells, t is the corresponding shear stress, and a, b, and c are fit parameters; c is the shear stress for 50% detachment.

Fig. S1 A displays Western blots indicating the efficacy of shRNA vectors targeting beta3 and alpha5 integrins, EGFR1, and RCP. Fig. S1 B shows results from internalization assays indicating that addition of cilengitide and expression of dominant-negative RCP621E do not greatly influence the constitutive endocytosis of alpha5beta1 or EGFR1. Fig. S2 indicates the inability of dominant-negative Rab11124I, Rip11630E, FIP2480E, and RCP621E to influence recycling of alpha5beta1 integrin and Tfn-R. Fig. S3 shows the time course over which physical association of GFP-RCP and alpha5beta1 integrin is established after the addition of cilengitide and shows the lack of coprecipitation of paxillin with GFP-RCP. Fig. S4 shows confocal immunofluorescence images illustrating the influence of cilengitide/osteopontin or knockdown of beta3 integrin on cellular morphology and the distribution of alpha5beta1 and RCP. Fig. S5 shows data indicating that dominant-negative Rip11630E and FIP2480E do not influence migration through FN-containing matrigel, and Fig. S5 B documents the consequences of expression of dominant-negative RCP621E and/or addition of cilengitide on alpha5beta1 and EGFR1 surface expression. Videos 1-3 show that addition of cilengitide promotes a rapid/random mode of cell migration on 2D surfaces that is opposed by expression of dominant-negative RCP621E. Videos 4-6 show that whereas A2780 cells expressing GFP-actin extend an organized fan-like lamellipodium as they move, after treatment with cilengitide or osteopontin their movement is characterized by the formation of highly dynamic actin-rich protrusions at the cell front. Videos 7-9 show that cilengitide promotes a pseudopodial mode of cell migration on cell-derived matrix that is opposed by expression of RCP621E. Video 10 is a high-resolution fluorescence time-lapse sequence showing GFP-RCP localization to the tip of the extending pseudopod as A2780 cells migrate on a 3D matrix.
