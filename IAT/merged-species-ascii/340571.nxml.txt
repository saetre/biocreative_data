The complete sequence (2879 bp) of the androgen-controlled rat prostatic binding protein C2 gene and 1023 bp of the 5'- and 2127 bp of the 3'-flanking regions have been determined. The gene contains three exons (93, 203 and 147 bp) and two introns (1630 and 806 bp). It is flanked by two homopurine-homopyrimidine stretches of 55 and 131 nucleotides respectively, located at positions -405 and 4151. These sequences are remarkably sensitive towards S1-nuclease, indicating an altered DNA conformation under superhelical stress. Several palindromes and dyad structures are observed in the 5'-upstream region of the gene and at position -457, and 80% homology to the consensus sequence of a glucocorticoid receptor binding site is found.
