A gene encoding a putative human RNA helicase, p54, has been cloned and mapped to the band q23.3 of chromosome 11. The predicted amino acid sequence shares a striking homology (75% identical) with the female germline-specific RNA helicase ME31B gene of Drosophila. Unlike ME31B, however, the new gene expresses an abundant transcript in a large number of adult tissues and its 5' non-coding region was found split in a t(11;14)(q23.3;q32.3) cell line from a diffuse large B-cell lymphoma.
