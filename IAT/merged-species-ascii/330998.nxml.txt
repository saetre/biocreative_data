ATF or CRE binding proteins are cellular transcription factors involved in the regulation of adenovirus Ela-responsive and cellular cAMP-inducible promoters. We report the isolation from a HeLa cell cDNA library of two clones that encode proteins with specific ATF/CRE DNA binding activity. The two clones differ by a 63 bp element which is retained in one (ATF-a) and deleted from the other (ATF-a delta) and which may correspond to an alternative exon. The peptide sequences (483 and 462 amino acids, respectively) derived from each of these cDNAs are identical, except for the additional 21 amino acids in ATF-a, but clearly differ from the other ATF/CREB proteins reported. All of them, however, share a conserved leucine zipper domain also found in other transcription factors. ATF-a and ATF-a delta therefore represent two closely related members of a larger multigene family of proteins that interact with conserved promoter elements.
