Part of the nucleotide sequence of a restriction fragment covering the origin of phiX174 DNA replication 1 has been determined. The fragment A7c was obtained by digestion of phiX174 RF DNA by the restriction enzyme from Arthrobacter luteus, Alu 1. It was further cleaved into two fragments, one large and one small, by the action of the restriction enzyme from Haemophilus aegyptius, Hae 111. The nucleotide sequence of the small fragment has been determined by analysis of the transcription products obtained by the action of Escherichia coli DNA-dependent RNA polymerase on denaturated template under conditions of low salt. Transcripts longer than the template were found. The whole sequence of 71 nucleotide pairs could be derived from complementary oligonucleotides, obtained after digestion of the transcripts with T1 or pancreatic RNAase. The sequence suggests that at least 4 of the 5 amber mutants 2 that have been mapped on this fragment are identical. On account of this and other evidence a reading frame is proposed.
