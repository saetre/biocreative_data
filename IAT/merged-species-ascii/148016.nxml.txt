Two genes of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, NTG1 and NTG2, encode proteins with a significant sequence homology to the endonuclease III of Escherichia coli. The Ntg1 and Ntg2 proteins were overexpressed in E.coli and purified to apparent homogeneity. The substrate specificity of Ntg1 and Ntg2 proteins for modified bases in oxidatively damaged DNA was investigated using gas chromatography/isotope-dilution mass spectrometry. The substrate used was calf-thymus DNA exposed to gamma-radiation in N2O-saturated aqueous solution. The results reveal excision by Ntg1 and Ntg2 proteins of six pyrimidine-derived lesions, 5-hydroxy-6-hydrothymine, 5-hydroxy-6-hydrouracil, 5-hydroxy-5-methylhydantoin, 5-hydroxyuracil, 5-hydroxycytosine and thymine glycol, and two purine-derived lesions, 2,6-diamino-4-hydroxy-5-formamidopyrimidine and 4,6-diamino-5-formamidopyrimidine from gamma-irradiated DNA. In contrast, Ntg1 and Ntg2 proteins do not release 8-hydroxyguanine or 8-hydroxyadenine from gamma-irradiated DNA. The Ntg1 and Ntg2 proteins also release 2, 6-diamino-4-hydroxy-5-N-methylformamido-pyrimidine from damaged poly(dG-dC).poly(dG-dC). Excision was measured as a function of enzyme concentration and time. Furthermore, kinetic parameters were determined for each lesion. The results show that kinetic constants varied among the different lesions for the same enzyme. We also investigated the capacity of the Ntg1 and Ntg2 proteins to cleave 34mer DNA duplexes containing a single 8-OH-Gua residue mispaired with each of the four DNA bases. The results show that the Ntg1 protein preferentially cleaves a DNA duplex containing 8-OH-Gua mispaired with a guanine. Moreover, the Ntg1 protein releases free 8-OH-Gua from 8-OH-Gua/Gua duplex but not from duplexes containing 8-OH-Gua mispaired with adenine, thymine or cytosine. In contrast, the Ntg2 protein does not incise duplexes containing 8-OH-Gua mispaired with any of the four DNA bases. These results demonstrate that substrate specificities of the Ntg1 and Ntg2 proteins are similar but not identical and clearly different from that of the endonuclease III of E.coli and its homologues in Schizosaccharomyces pombe or human cells.
