cDNA clones for Xenopus laevis ribosomal protein L32 have been isolated and sequenced. The deduced amino acid sequence indicates that L32 is a basic protein of 110 amino acids, has a molecular weight of 12,603 and is homologous to the rat ribosomal protein L35. Using the cDNA clone as a probe to follow the expression of this gene during Xenopus development, it has been shown that the pattern of accumulation of this mRNA follows the one previously described for other ribosomal protein mRNAs during oogenesis and embryogenesis. The analysis of the utilization of L32 mRNA during embryogenesis shows that this is controlled by the translational regulation typical of other ribosomal protein mRNAs.
