The purified A protein and A* protein of bacteriophage phi X174 have been tested for endonuclease activity on single stranded viral phi X174 DNA. The A protein (55.000 daltons) nicks single-stranded DNA in the same way and at the same place as it does superhelical RFI DNA, at the origin of DNA replication. The A* protein (37.000 daltons) can cleave the single-stranded viral DNA at many different sites. It has however a strong preference for the origin of replication. Both proteins generate 3'OH ends and blocked 5' termini at the nick site.
