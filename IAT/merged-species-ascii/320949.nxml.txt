The nucleotide sequence of the rat epsilon-chain mRNA has been determined by sequencing cloned cDNA copies of the mRNA. The established sequence covers the coding region, the 3'-non coding region and most of the 5' non-coding region. A comparison with the nucleotide sequence of the human epsilon-chain constant region reveals that C3 and C4 are the most highly conserved domains. The rat epsilon-chain contains a C-terminal decapeptide which is not present in the human counterpart.
