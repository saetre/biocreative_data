Recent evidence demonstrates that 14-3-3sigma acts as a tumor suppressor gene inactivated by methylation of its 5' CpG islands in epithelial tumor cells, while remaining un-methylated in normal human epithelia. The methylation analysis of 14-3-3sigma has been largely overlooked in melanoma.

The methylation status of 14-3-3sigma CpG island in melanocytes and melanoma cells was analyzed by methylation-specific sequencing (MSS) and quantitative methylation-specific PCR (Q-MSP). 14-3-3sigma mRNA and protein expression in cell lines was detected by real-time RT-PCR and western blot. Melanoma cells were also treated by 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine (DAC), a demethylating agent, and/or histone deacetylase inhibitor, Trichostatin A (TSA), to evaluate their effects on 14-3-3sigma gene expression.

14-3-3sigma is hypermethylated in both human melanocytes and most melanoma cells in a lineage-specific manner, resulting in the silencing of 14-3-3sigma gene expression and the active induction of 14-3-3sigma mRNA and protein expression following treatment with DAC. We also observed a synergistic effect upon gene expression when DAC was combined with TSA. The promoter methylation status of 14-3-3sigma was analyzed utilizing Q-MSP in 20 melanoma tissue samples and 10 cell lines derived from these samples, showing that the majority of melanoma samples maintain their hypermethylation status of the 14-3-3sigma gene.

14-3-3sigma is hypermethylated in human melanoma in a cell-linage specific manner. Spontaneous demethylation and re-expression of 14-3-3sigma is a rare event in melanoma, indicating 14-3-3sigma might have a tentative role in the pathogenesis of melanoma.

14-3-3sigma is a highly conserved acidic protein family, composed of seven isoforms in mammals. Of the seven known isoforms, 14-3-3sigma appears to be the only one directly involved in human cancer [1]. The 14-3-3sigma gene has been implicated in G2/M cell cycle arrest by p53 and acts as a tumor suppressor gene (TSG) in colorectal cancer [2]. 14-3-3sigma (also know as Stratifin) was first identified as an epithelial cell antigen (HME-1) exclusively expressed in human epithelia. Recent evidence demonstrates that the 14-3-3sigma gene promoter region is un-methylated in normal epithelial cells while inactivated via hypermethylation of its 5' CpG islands in epithelial malignancies. Gene silencing of 14-3-3sigma by CpG hypermethylation has been found to occur in many human cancer histologies, including breast cancer [3], hepatocellular carcinoma [4], vulvar squamous neoplasia [5], gastric carcinoma [6], oral carcinoma [7], epithelial ovarian cancer [8], and prostate and endometrial carcinoma [9].

The methylation status of 14-3-3sigma in melanoma has not been previously investigated. Thus, we wished to examine whether 14-3-3sigma gene is aberrantly methylated in melanoma. We first examined the CpG island methylation status and gene expression of 14-3-3sigma in normal human epidermal melanocytes (NHEM) and melanoma cells. We report that NHEM does not express significant levels of 14-3-3sigma protein, nor is it expressed at the transcriptional level, primarily due to the dense hypermethylation of the 14-3-3sigma gene CpG island. We show that the 14-3-3sigma gene is methylated in most melanomas cells in a cell lineage-specific manner, with spontaneous demethylation and re-expression of 14-3-3sigma a rare event in human melanoma.

The human melanoma cell lines, A375 (American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, VA), WM266-4 (Wistar Special Collection), Lox (established from a lymph node metastasis of a patient at the Norwegian Radium Hospital) [10] and C8161.9 (a highly metastatic, amelanotic melanoma cell line derived from an abdominal wall metastasis) [11] were grown in monolayer culture in RPMI 1640 with glutamine supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum at 37degreesC in a humidified atmosphere consisting of 5% CO2 and 95% air. NHEM cell lines (Cambrex, Baltimore, MD) were cultured under the same incubator conditions, utilizing specialized melanocyte media (Cambrex) according to the supplier's recommendations. We established numerous melanoma cell lines from freshly excised clinical melanoma samples utilizing previously published techniques for tissue procurement and in vitro melanoma cell line growth and expansion [12]. These melanoma cell lines were further characterized by flow cytometry and/or cytospin preparation for cellular confirmation of melanoma cell purity of >99% (data not shown). All melanoma cell lines were derived from either thick primary or metastatic melanoma tissue samples.

Over a 3-year period, we surgically procured tumor samples from patients with primary cutaneous melanoma (PM) and metastatic melanoma (MM). All samples were obtained under an Investigational Review Board (IRB) approved tissue procurement protocol (MCC#13448, IRB#101751; PSM# 990914-JM, 020318-JM). Upon surgical removal of the primary melanoma, a single surgical oncologist (A.I.R.) utilized a scalpel to macrodissect and procure a portion of the remaining primary tumor, with a similar technique utilized for grossly involved lymph nodes where the melanoma had completely replaced the lymph node. Samples were taken from non-necrotic areas of the tumor. The same process was performed for all distant metastases, careful to avoid surrounding tissues or stroma. All samples were cryopreserved in liquid nitrogen and stored within the Tissue Procurement Laboratory of the Moffitt Cancer Center, securely de-identified through a centralized database. We analyzed 4 thick PM's (>4 mm) and 16 MM samples composed of 12 bulky, macroscopic (replaced) lymph node metastases and 4 subcutaneous metastases.

Promoter methylation of 14-3-3sigma gene was investigated utilizing quantitative, methylation-specific PCR (Q-MSP) [13]. Briefly, bisulfite-treated DNA was amplified using real-time PCR with oligonucleotide primers complementary to a region of the beta-actin sequence that does not contain CpG dinucleotides but does contain non-CpG cytosines. From this, we were able to ascertain the amount of converted input DNA template for each sample. Hypermethylation of 14-3-3sigma CpG islands was then examined with real-time PCR amplification of bisulfite-modified DNA using oligonucleotide primers as reported [3]. The performance of the Q-MSP primers was evaluated by running a standard curve and melting curve before they were applied for quantitative gene methylation analysis in tumor samples. All PCR reactions were carried out on an iQ5 real-time thermal cycler (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95degreesC for 10 min followed by 40 cycles of 95degreesC for 15 s and 60degreesC for 60 s. Each PCR reaction was carried out in a 25 mul volume containing 2x SYBR Green PCR master mix (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA), 200 nM each primer and 1 mul bisulfite-modified gDNA. All reactions were carried out in duplicate. Bisulfite-converted, universally methylated human gDNA (Chemicon, Temecula, CA) and gDNA from MDA-MB-435 served as positive controls and bisulfite-converted gDNA from MDA-MB-231 and blank reactions with water served as negative controls as it has been shown that 14-3-3sigma CpG island in MDA-MB-231 cell line was un-methylated [3].

We first utilized Q-MSP to determine the methylation status of the 14-3-3sigma gene in NHEM and several established melanoma cell lines, including A375, C8161.9, LOX and WM-266-4. Figure 1 shows a map of the CpG island for the 14-3-3sigma gene (662 bp) as well as the PCR primers utilized for methylation analysis. As shown in Figure 2, consistent with previous reports [3], the 14-3-3sigma CpG island was shown to be un-methylated in the cell line MDA-MB-231, but heavily methylated in MDA-MB-435. This result confirmed the accuracy of the Q-MSP method utilized here in evaluating 14-3-3sigma CpG island methylation. Results from Q-MSP reveal that the 14-3-3sigma CpG island was hypermethylated in NHEM as well as the melanoma cell lines A375, LOX and WM266-4, but un-methylated in C8161.9. To further validate the Q-MSP results, methylation-specific sequencing (MSS) was performed upon genomic DNA derived from NHEM and C8161.9 cells. Utilizing MSS, we evaluated the 27 CpG dinucleotides contained within the CpG island of the first exon from the 14-3-3sigma gene. Figure 3 shows that the MSS results are correlative with the MSP results, demonstrating that all 27 CpG sites within the 14-3-3sigma gene are heavily methylated in NHEM but un-methylated in C8161.9.

Expression of 14-3-3sigma mRNA and protein were evaluated with real-time RT-PCR and Western Blot analysis, respectively. As shown in Figure 4, 14-3-3sigma mRNA expression is significant in C8161.9 but undetectable or very low in NHEM and other melanoma cell lines. Western blot analysis shows that C8161.9 expressed the 14-3-3sigma protein while it was undetectable in NHEM. We did, however, find a trace amount of protein in LOX (Figure 5). We suspect that "leaking expression" from a few spontaneously demethylated alleles within the 14-3-3sigma gene may have contributed to the protein expression. This expression pattern is consistent with the 14-3-3sigma gene methylation status where only C8161.9 possessed an un-methylated CpG island. The NHEM cells and remaining melanoma cell lines harbored a hypermethylated CpG island within the 14-3-3sigma gene.

To further investigate whether CpG island methylation is the principal mechanism leading to 14-3-3sigma silencing in NHEM and melanoma cell lines, we treated NHEM, LOX and WM266-4 with the demethylating agent, 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine (DAC), alone or combined with the histone deacetylase inhibitor (HDACi), Trichostatin A (TSA). We then examined each cell line for evidence of re-expression of 14-3-3sigma utilizing real-time RT-PCR and Western blot analysis. We found that after treatment with DAC, 14-3-3sigma mRNA expression was significantly up-regulated in NHEM (Figure 6a) as well as LOX and WM266-4 cell lines (Figure 6b). TSA, used as a single agent, was unable to induce 14-3-3sigma mRNA re-expression, but was able to exert a significant synergistic effect when combined with DAC (Figure 6b). The Western blot results are correlative with mRNA expression, as shown in Figure 7. Treatment of C8161.9 with DAC alone or combined with TSA, which possesses a fully un-methylated CpG island within the 14-3-3sigma gene, was not able to further induce 14-3-3sigma mRNA expressing (data not shown). Thus, our results suggest that the hypermethylation of the CpG island in the 14-3-3sigma gene appears to be an active mechanism of gene silencing in both NHEM and melanoma cells.

Our data demonstrates that the 14-3-3sigma gene is hypermethylated in NHEM but hypomethylated in the highly metastatic melanoma cell line C8161.9. We therefore hypothesized that the hypermethylation status of 14-3-3sigma gene may be disrupted during melanoma progression as a result of genome-wide hypomethylation, which is a known characteristic of advanced-stage tumors [14]. We next tested primary cell cultures of 10 daughter melanoma cell lines originally derived from surgically procured melanoma tissues for evidence of 14-3-3sigma DNA methylation. Utilizing Q-MSP and real-time RT-PCR, we found no detectable levels of 14-3-3sigma mRNA expression within any of the samples (0/10), with their CpG islands within the 14-3-3sigma gene found to be highly hypermethylated. We next analyzed 20 freshly procured and cryopreserved melanoma tumor specimens from patients with stage III and IV melanoma, where melanoma cells almost completely replaced the normal tissue (see Methods). We found that all (20/20, 100%) samples exhibited significant levels of 14-3-3sigma DNA hypermethylation. These results strongly demonstrate that most melanoma cells maintain intrinsic levels of hypermethylation of the 14-3-3sigma gene, without concomitant levels of mRNA gene expression. Thus, the spontaneous demethylation of 14-3-3sigma gene appears to be a relatively rare event in melanoma.

We have attempted to identify hypermethylated genes in melanoma, possibly serving as biomarkers and/or therapeutic targets for patients with advanced melanoma. The 14-3-3sigma gene is notable because it has been shown to be un-methylated in normal epithelial cells but aberrantly methylated in several types of epithelial malignancies [3-9] and was indicated as a tumor suppressor gene. In contrast to other histologic cancers, here we show that the 14-3-3sigma gene is hypermethylated in human melanoma in a lineage-specific manner, as it is hypermethylated in both NHEM and melanoma cells.

Several recent reports have indicated that cytosine methylation is an important event in the establishment and maintenance of cell lineage-restricted gene expression [15]. Such examples of genes that are methylated in normal cells in a lineage-specific manner are maspin [15] and MAGE genes [16]. Previously, 14-3-3sigma has been reported to be hypermethylated in a cell-lineage-specific manner in non-epithelial cells such as fibroblasts, lymphocytes, chondrocytes and bone marrow [17]. Here, we report that the 14-3-3sigma gene is densely methylated in human epidermal melanocytes and most melanoma cells and that CpG island hypermethylation results in the silencing of transcription of the 14-3-3sigma gene in both NHEM and melanoma cells.

Transcription and expression of 14-3-3sigma mRNA and protein are readily identified in the melanoma cell line C8161.9, whose CpG island in 14-3-3sigma is un-methylated. At the same time, in those cell lines with a hypermethylated CpG island, DAC treatment results in the re-expression of 14-3-3sigma. Significant synergistic effects are also observed when DAC is combined with TSA, with TSA treatment alone being unable to induce 14-3-3sigma expression. These results strongly indicate that the 14-3-3sigma gene is hypermethylated and the chromatin is not accessible due to hypoacetylated histones in NHEM and most melanoma cells.

The 14-3-3sigma gene is recognized as a negative cell cycle regulator that causes G2 arrest after DNA damage [18]. Lack of 14-3-3sigma gene expression may contribute to the malignant transformation via the impairment of the G2 cell cycle checkpoint function, allowing for the accumulation of gene defects within the cell. The 14-3-3sigma gene has also been shown to be a regulator of mitotic translation through its direct mitosis-specific binding to a variety of translation/initiation factors [19]. The lack of 14-3-3sigma gene expression leads to aberrant mitotic translation and the generation of binucleate cells. Aberrant silencing of the 14-3-3sigma gene in many types of epithelial malignancies strongly suggests that it may function as a potent tumor suppressor gene. Indeed, the tumor suppression effects of 14-3-3sigma in melanoma have been examined in a model cell line, MDA-MB-435. MDA-MB-435, originally thought to represent a breast cancer cell line, was later confirmed to be melanoma in origin [20]. Ferguson et al [18] demonstrated that the over-expression of 14-3-3sigma led to a rapid and permanent G2 arrest in MDA-MB-435 cells. Thus re-expression of 14-3-3sigma in melanoma cells may be beneficial for the control of melanoma growth, while further investigation are required to determine the functional significances of 14-3-3sigma in melanoma.

Here, we show that 14-3-3sigma/Stratifin, as an epithelial cell antigen expressed in epithelia, is hypermethylated in both human melanocytes and most melanoma cells in a lineage-specific manner. This hypermethylation leads to silencing of 14-3-3sigma expression in human melanocytes and melanoma cells. Spontaneous demethylation and re-expression of 14-3-3sigma is a rare event in melanoma.
