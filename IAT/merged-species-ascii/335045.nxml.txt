The human BCR gene on chromosome 22 is specifically involved in the Philadelphia translocation, t(9;22), a chromosomal rearrangement present in the leukemic cells of patients with chronic myeloid leukemia or acute lymphoblastic leukemia. In most cases, the breakpoints on chromosome 22 are found within a 5.8 kb region of DNA designated the major breakpoint cluster region (Mbcr) of the BCR gene. Hybridization experiments have indicated that the human genome contains BCR gene-related sequences. Here we report the molecular cloning of one of these loci, for which we propose the name ABR. In contrast with the other BCR-related genes studied to date, ABR represents a functionally active gene and contains exons very similar to those found within the Mbcr. Unlike the BCR gene, the ABR gene exhibits great genomic variability caused by two different variable tandem repeat regions located in two introns. All other BCR gene-related sequences isolated so far and the BCR gene itself are located on chromosome 22. In contrast, the ABR gene is located on chromosome 17p.
