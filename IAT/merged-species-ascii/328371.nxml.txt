In the early region of the Escherichia coli lac repressor mRNA, translational reinitiation events triggered by nonsense codons occur over long distances and in a distinctive pattern not explained by simple use of the next available initiator triplet. Defined fusions of the restart sites to the lacZ coding region have been used to explore the basis for these reinitiation patterns and to ask whether the sites can function in independent initiation at the 5' end of an mRNA. The results obtained confirm earlier indications that the restart sites may have little or no inherent capacity for binding free 30S ribosomes. The data also add to growing evidence that primary sequence elements are important determinants of reinitiation efficiency. On the basis of the reinitiation activities for nonsense sites throughout the early region of the mRNA, we suggest that out-of-frame restarts and RNA secondary structure bridge long distances between the point of termination and downstream restart codons. Such bridging mechanisms could serve more generally as a means of propagating translational activity across long polycistronic mRNAs.
