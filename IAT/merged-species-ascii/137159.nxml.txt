Bloom's syndrome (BS) is a disorder associated with chromosomal instability and a predisposition to the development of cancer. The BS gene product, BLM, is a DNA helicase of the RecQ family that forms a complex in vitro and in vivo with topoisomerase IIIalpha. Here, we show that BLM stimulates the ability of topoisomerase IIIalpha to relax negatively supercoiled DNA. Moreover, DNA binding analyses indicate that BLM recruits topoisomerase IIIalpha to its DNA substrate. Consistent with this, a mutant form of BLM that retains helicase activity, but is unable to bind topoisomerase IIIalpha, fails to stimulate topoisomerase activity. These results indicate that a physical association between BLM and topoisomerase IIIalpha is a prerequisite for their functional biochemical interaction.

Bloom's syndrome (BS) is a rare genetic disorder characterized by proportional dwarfism, immunodeficiency, male infertility and a greatly elevated incidence of cancers of most types (reviewed in 1). This predisposition to cancer is thought to arise from the inherent genomic instability that is a feature of BS cells. In particular, BS cells display an elevated level of genetic recombination that is manifested as an increase in the frequency of both sister chromatid exchanges and interchromosomal homologous recombination events (2).

The gene mutated in BS, BLM, encodes a protein of molecular mass 159 kDa that belongs to the RecQ family of DNA helicases (3). BLM protein has been purified and shown to act as a 3'-->5' DNA helicase on a variety of different DNA substrates (4-8). Mutations in two other genes encoding RecQ helicases are also associated with human cancer-prone disorders. WRN is defective in Werner's syndrome and RECQ4 is defective in Rothmund-Thomson syndrome (9,10). Members of the RecQ helicase family contain a highly conserved catalytic helicase domain that is flanked by domains that vary both in size and sequence between different family members. However, despite this apparent sequence divergence in those regions outside the helicase domain, all known mutants lacking a RecQ helicase display genomic instability (reviewed in 11-13). Moreover, many of these mutants display a hyper-recombinogenic phenotype reminiscent of BS cells, suggesting that RecQ helicases perform a conserved function in controlling the level of homologous recombination in cells (14-19). Although the precise cellular role of any RecQ helicase has yet to be elucidated, several lines of evidence suggest that RecQ helicases act in concert with type IA topoisomerases (reviewed in 20).

The type IA subclass of topoisomerases includes Escherichia coli topoisomerases I and III and the eukaryotic topoisomerase III enzymes (reviewed in 21). In vertebrates, there are at least two isoforms of topoisomerase III, termed alpha and beta, which display only a weak topoisomerase activity towards negatively supercoiled DNA (22-25). Yeast cells express a single topoisomerase III enzyme encoded by the TOP3 gene (26). In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, top3Delta mutants are viable, but grow very slowly and have defects in S phase responses to DNA damage and in both mitotic and meiotic recombination (16,26-28). In contrast, the top3+ gene in Schizosaccharomyces pombe is essential for viability, with top3Delta mutants displaying an inability to accurately segregate daughter chromosomes during mitosis (29,30). Interestingly, mutation of SGS1 or rqh1+, the sole RecQ homologues found in budding and fission yeast, respectively, can suppress the deleterious effects caused by the absence of Top3 protein (16,28-30). One interpretation of this conserved genetic interaction is that RecQ helicases act upstream of topoisomerase III in the same biochemical pathway and that RecQ helicases generate a DNA structure that requires resolution by topoisomerase III (reviewed in 20). Consistent with this proposal, E.coli RecQ can convert negatively supercoiled plasmid DNA to a structure [as yet not defined, but presumed to be single-stranded (ss)DNA] that can be acted upon by E.coli or S.cerevisiae Top3p to generate catenated DNA molecules (31).

The S.cerevisiae Sgs1 and Top3 proteins also interact physically, raising the possibility that Sgs1p may recruit Top3p to its site of action (16,32,33). We and others have demonstrated that BLM and human topoisomerase IIIalpha (hTOPO IIIalpha) are tightly associated in human cells (34-36) and that the two purified proteins interact in vitro (35), indicating that this association is a direct one.

In this study, we demonstrate that BLM can stimulate the topoisomerase activity of hTOPO IIIalpha. In contrast, a mutant BLM protein that is catalytically active, but no longer able to interact with hTOPO IIIalpha, has lost the ability to stimulate hTOPO IIIalpha protein. Moreover, we provide evidence that hTOPO IIIalpha associates with a BLM-DNA complex. These data are consistent with the notion that hTOPO IIIalpha is recruited to its site of action through a direct interaction with the BLM helicase.

The phiX174 helicase substrate was generated by annealing a 21mer oligonucleotide (GTGCATATACCTGGTCTTTCG) to circular phiX174 ssDNA before being extended by 4 nt in the presence of Klenow polymerase, dATP, dTTP and [alpha-32P]dCTP. G-quadruplex (G4) DNA representing the murine immunoglobulin Sgamma2B switch region and the 12 nt bubble-containing duplex were prepared using the oligonucleotides and experimental conditions described previously (6,7). Topoisomerase assays (see below) were performed on negatively supercoiled (form I) phiX174 DNA.

Plasmids driving the expression of either hexahistidine-tagged BLM or BLM-NC have been described previously (4,35). Purification of these proteins from yeast was as described by Karow et al. (4). Relative specific helicase activities of both proteins were determined using the partially double-stranded phiX174 DNA substrate described above. Recombinant hTOPO IIIalpha was a kind gift of Drs Jean-Francois Riou and Helene Goulaouic (Aventis Pharma, France). Human RPA was a kind gift of Dr Rick Wood (University of Pittsburgh). Escherichia coli SSB was purchased from Promega.

Typically, BLM (120 nM) and hTOPO IIIalpha (300 nM) were incubated with 200 ng of negatively supercoiled phiX174 in the presence of either human RPA (350 ng) or E.coli SSB (1.5 microg) in 30 microl of reaction buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 5 mM MgCl2, 100 microg/ml BSA, 40 mM NaCl, 0.2 U creatine kinase, 6 mM phosphocreatine and 1 mM DTT). In experiments comparing BLM and BLM-NC, protein preparations were diluted to give equivalent specific activities. Reactions were initiated by the addition of 5 mM ATP, followed by incubation at 37degreesC. Aliquots of 5 microl were taken at the indicated times and 1 microl of 5x STOP buffer (250 mM EDTA, 5% SDS, 5 mg/ml proteinase K) was added. Samples were then incubated at 37degreesC for a further 10 min to deproteinise the DNA. The DNA was separated on 0.6% agarose gels in the absence of ethidium bromide, before being transferred to nylon filters by conventional Southern blotting and then hybridised to a random-primed labeled phiX174 DNA probe using Rediprime (Amersham). Visualisation and quantification of reaction products were performed using a PhosphorImager 840 (Molecular Dynamics) and ImageQuant software.

To examine a possible functional role for the interaction of the BLM and hTOPO IIIalpha proteins, we investigated whether BLM had any effect on the ability of hTOPO IIIalpha to act upon negatively supercoiled phiX174 DNA. When hTOPO IIIalpha was incubated with supercoiled phiX174 DNA in the absence of BLM, form I DNA disappeared with the concomitant appearance of topoisomers. At longer incubation periods, fully relaxed DNA (form II) was also evident. It is possible that a proportion of form II DNA molecules also represented nicked DNA since Top3beta from Drosophila melanogaster has been shown to introduce single-stranded nicks into negatively supercoiled DNA (see Discussion). Given the potential heterogeneity of the reaction products generated by hTOPO IIIalpha, we quantified the loss of form I DNA as an indication of hTOPO IIIalpha activity and found that co-incubation with BLM led to an approximate doubling in the rate of hTOPO IIIalpha activity (Fig. 1A and B). Incubation of BLM alone with the phiX174 substrate had no effect on the level of form I DNA, indicating that the BLM preparation did not contain any contaminating topoisomerase activity (Fig. 1A).

The stimulatory effect of BLM on the activity of hTOPO IIIalpha was found to be dependent on the presence of RPA in the reactions (Fig. 1C). It was therefore possible that RPA inhibits hTOPO IIIalpha by binding to ssDNA regions in the negatively supercoiled substrate, thereby preventing access of hTOPO IIIalpha to the DNA. BLM might then act to stimulate hTOPO IIIalpha by displacing RPA from the DNA. To eliminate this possibility, we examined the effect of RPA on hTOPO IIIalpha activity in the absence of BLM. RPA did not inhibit the plasmid relaxation activity of hTOPO IIIalpha, but rather had a mild stimulatory effect (Fig. 2). This effect appeared to be solely a function of RPA binding to ssDNA, as opposed to a protein-protein interaction occurring between RPA and hTOPO IIIalpha, since a similar stimulatory effect was also seen when RPA was substituted by E.coli SSB (Fig. 2). We therefore analysed whether SSB could substitute for RPA in supporting the stimulatory effects of BLM on the activity of hTOPO IIIalpha. Figure 2 shows that in the presence of SSB, BLM still caused a stimulation of hTOPO IIIalpha plasmid relaxation activity. Due to the apparent functional equivalence of RPA and SSB in these reactions, coupled with the commercial availability of SSB, the bacterial protein was used in all subsequent experiments.

BLM and hTOPO IIIalpha have been shown to interact directly with each other and form a complex in vivo (34,35). Moreover, it has been shown that the ability of ectopically expressed BLM to reduce the elevated frequency of SCEs in BS cells correlates with its ability to interact with hTOPO IIIalpha (36). The stimulatory effect of BLM on the activity of hTOPO IIIalpha that we observed might therefore be mediated by the recruitment of hTOPO IIIalpha to its site of action by BLM. In such a scenario, BLM should be able to simultaneously interact with both DNA and hTOPO IIIalpha. We have shown previously that BLM can unwind a duplex DNA molecule that contains a single-stranded bubble of the sort that is a characteristic of negatively supercoiled DNA (6). We tested, therefore, the ability of BLM to bind simultaneously to a synthetic bubble-containing duplex DNA substrate and to hTOPO IIIalpha. As expected, BLM was found to bind the bubble-containing substrate and generated two retarded complexes designated B1 and B2 (Fig. 3). A proportion of the substrate was also incorporated into a complex that was retained in the wells. Since this material did not resolve under the gel running conditions employed, it was not possible to anaylse further the nature of these apparent aggregates of DNA and protein. Quantification of the amount of DNA in these complexes revealed that B1 and B2 represented 9 and 6%, respectively, of the total substrate in the reaction. In contrast, at the concentrations used in Figure 3, hTOPO IIIalpha displayed a negligible binding affinity for the DNA substrate. However, the addition of hTOPO IIIalpha to BLM-containing reactions resulted in the conversion of 93% of B1 and 54% of B2 into a new, slower migrating complex, termed BT (Fig. 3). Since concentrations of hTOPO IIIalpha were used at which hTOPO IIIalpha alone maximally bound <5% of the substrate, the conversion of the majority of B1 and B2 into BT indicates that hTOPO IIIalpha preferentially binds B1 and B2 over the DNA substrate alone. These data also imply that DNA-bound BLM can still form a complex with hTOPO IIIalpha and are consistent with the notion that BLM recruits hTOPO IIIalpha to its site of action on DNA.

To confirm that the stimulatory effect of BLM on hTOPO IIIalpha activity requires BLM to recruit hTOPO IIIalpha to its site of action, a mutant BLM protein was generated that was no longer able to interact with hTOPO IIIalpha. Mapping studies have revealed that two hTOPO IIIalpha interaction domains exist in BLM that are located between residues 1-212 and 1267-1417 (35). A hexahistidine-tagged truncated protein, BLM-NC, that consists of residues 213-1266 of BLM and does not, therefore, contain either of the hTOPO IIIalpha interaction domains, was expressed in yeast and purified to near homogeneity by nickel-chelate affinity chromatography. BLM-NC had an apparent molecular mass of approximately150 kDa on SDS-PAGE (Fig. 4A) and was recognised on western blots by both polyclonal and monoclonal anti-BLM antibodies (35), as well as by an anti-hexahistidine tag antibody (data not shown), thereby confirming its identity.

To establish that BLM-NC no longer bound hTOPO IIIalpha, and hence to eliminate the possibility that additional hTOPO IIIalpha interaction domains might be present in the BLM protein not detected in our previous studies, far-western analysis using hTOPO IIIalpha as a probe was performed with BLM and BLM-NC. After separation of the BLM and BLM-NC proteins by SDS-PAGE and transfer to nitrocellulose filters, the membranes were incubated with hTOPO IIIalpha before being washed to remove any unbound material. hTOPO IIIalpha was then detected by western analysis using a previously characterized polyclonal antibody (D6) (35). We have shown using this technique that hTOPO IIIalpha associates with full-length BLM (35), and this result was confirmed in the current experiments (Fig. 4A). In contrast, hTOPO IIIalpha did not bind to BLM-NC (Fig. 4A), confirming that all hTOPO IIIalpha interaction domains have been removed by truncation of BLM to create BLM-NC.

Despite the fact that relatively large regions of BLM were deleted to generate BLM-NC, the truncated protein was still catalytically active and was able to unwind a variety of DNA substrates that have been shown to be substrates for the full-length protein (4,6,7). These included oligonucleotides annealed to a circular ssDNA and highly stable G4 DNA structures (Fig. 4B).

We next compared the ability of BLM and BLM-NC to stimulate the activity of hTOPO IIIalpha. Significantly, the stimulatory effect on hTOPO IIIalpha activity observed with full-length BLM was not seen when BLM was substituted by BLM-NC (Fig. 4C). This failure of BLM-NC to stimulate hTOPO IIIalpha was seen over a wide concentration range (81-fold), with higher concentrations even having a mild inhibitory effect on hTOPO IIIalpha (Fig. 4C). We conclude, therefore, that the stimulatory effect of BLM on hTOPO IIIalpha requires that the two proteins be capable of forming a complex.

In this paper, we report the first demonstration of a functional biochemical interaction between a eukaryotic RecQ family DNA helicase and topoisomerase III. BLM was found to significantly stimulate the ability of hTOPO IIIalpha to act upon negatively supercoiled DNA. When hTOPO IIIalpha alone was incubated with supercoiled phiX174 DNA, two classes of reaction products were observed. These were in the form of topoisomers that appeared after 15 min incubation, and form II DNA that only accumulated after longer periods of incubation, up to 60 min. The latter class of reaction products most likely consisted of fully relaxed DNA, since their appearance occurred only after the formation of topoisomers. However, it is also possible that a proportion of form II molecules contained single strand nicks. Indeed, Wilson-Sali and Hsieh (37) have reported recently that Top3beta from D.melanogaster is able to catalyse the nicking of negatively supercoiled DNA. It is presently unknown if hTOPO IIIalpha possesses an equivalent endonucleolytic activity. However, we are currently addressing this issue and determining what differential effects BLM might have on the topoisomerase versus putative endonuclease activities of hTOPO IIIalpha.

BLM was found able to bind simultaneously to both hTOPO IIIalpha and DNA. Moreover, the stimulation of hTOPO IIIalpha by BLM was lost when BLM was modified to eliminate all of the hTOPO IIIalpha interaction domains. We therefore propose that one role of BLM is to recruit hTOPO IIIalpha to its site of action. This proposal is supported by a number of observations. In normal cells, BLM and hTOPO IIIalpha can be detected together in subnuclear structures termed PML bodies (38-41). However, in BS cells, hTOPO IIIalpha is expressed normally but is aberrantly localised in the nucleus (34,35). Furthermore, recent studies on Sgs1p, the budding yeast homologue of BLM, which also interacts with Top3p, have shown that expression of mutant forms of Sgs1p that cannot associate withTop3p are unable to complement several aspects of the sgs1 phenotype, including sensitivity to methylmethane sulphonate and hydroxyurea, which damage DNA and inhibit DNA replication, respectively (32). However, this requirement for Sgs1p to interact with Top3p can be circumvented by the expression of a fusion protein consisting of Top3p fused to the N-terminus of a Top3p binding-defective form of Sgs1p (32). Together, these data indicate that the evolutionarily conserved interaction between RecQ helicases and topoisomerase III serves to recruit topoisomerase III to its site of action.

The requirement for the presence of either RPA or SSB in the reactions to observe the stimulatory effect of BLM on the activity of hTOPO IIIalpha suggests that the DNA structure BLM recruits hTOPO IIIalpha to has single-stranded character. Consistent with this is the ability of BLM to recruit hTOPO IIIalpha to single-stranded 'bubbles'. In human cells, the nature of the DNA structure that BLM loads hTOPO IIIalpha onto remains to be determined. TOPO IIIalpha is required for embryonic development in mice (42), indicating that TOPO IIIalpha performs an essential role that cannot be provided by other topoisomerases. Similarly, in both budding and fission yeast, neither Top1p nor Top2p can functionally substitute for Top3p (26,27,29,30). Taken together, these findings indicate that eukaryotic topoisomerase III enzymes do not function as typical topoisomerases and, consistent with this, it has been reported previously that Top3p is unlikely to play a significant role in regulating the overall supercoiling status of the budding yeast genome (reviewed in 43). Mutants lacking topoisomerase III, as well as those defective in RecQ family helicases, including BLM, generally display hyper-recombination throughout the genome (14-19,26). This would suggest that the BLM-hTOPO IIIalpha complex acts to suppress inadvertant recombination or to disrupt inappropriately paired DNA molecules. One possible target for the complex is the Holliday junction recombination intermediate. It is known that RecQ, Sgs1p, WRN and BLM can disrupt Holliday junctions (5,6,44-46). Moreover, we have shown recently that BLM promotes the ATP-dependent branch migration of these junctions (5). Through catalysing this reaction, BLM may act to promote and/or eliminate recombinants, depending upon the circumstances. Although the role of topoisomerase III in this process is unclear, it may be significant that yeast Top3p has been shown to be required for the resolution of meiotic recombination intermediates (27). The possibility exists, therefore, that BLM recruits hTOPO IIIalpha to Holliday junctions to affect their resolution. Ongoing studies of the effects of hTOPO IIIalpha on BLM-catalysed Holliday junction branch migration reactions aim to address this possibility. A second potential role for the BLM-hTOPO IIIalpha complex is in the elimination of G-quadruplex DNA in order to permit progression of the replication and/or transcription machinery. This ability of BLM to unwind such non-canonical Watson-Crick DNA structures is a conserved function of the RecQ family helicases (13). G4 DNA has been suggested to be highly recombinogenic due primarily to its potential to lead to replication fork stalling and hence the formation of DNA double-strand breaks.

In summary, we have shown that BLM stimulates the activity of hTOPO IIIalpha and that this stimulation requires that the two proteins be able to form a stable complex. We propose that BLM functions to regulate the levels of genetic recombination through the recruitment of hTOPO IIIalpha to recombinogenic DNA structures and/or recombination intermediates. The biochemical functions of BLM and hTOPO IIIalpha appear to be intimately connected, consistent with the observation that lack of BLM in BS cell lines causes hTOPO IIIalpha to be mislocalised in the nucleus (34,35). It is therefore quite possible that the diverse phenotypes observed in BS cells are not due solely to a loss of BLM. Instead, 'uncoupling' of the BLM-hTOPO IIIalpha heteromeric helicase/topoisomerase complex might be at least partially responsible for this phenotypic diversity.
