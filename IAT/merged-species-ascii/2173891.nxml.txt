Bacterial DNA containing motifs of unmethylated CpG dinucleotides (CpG-ODN) initiate an innate immune response mediated by the pattern recognition receptor Toll-like receptor 9 (TLR9). This leads in particular to the expression of proinflammatory mediators such as tumor necrosis factor (TNF-alpha) and interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta). TLR9 is expressed in human and murine pulmonary tissue and induction of proinflammatory mediators has been linked to the development of acute lung injury. Therefore, the hypothesis was tested whether CpG-ODN administration induces an inflammatory response in the lung via TLR9 in vivo.

In WT mice, CpG-ODN induced a strong activation of pulmonary NFkappaB as well as a significant increase in pulmonary TNF-alpha and IL-1beta mRNA/protein. In addition, cytokine serum levels were significantly elevated in WT mice. Increased pulmonary content of lung myeloperoxidase (MPO) was documented in WT mice following application of CpG-ODN. Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) revealed that CpG-ODN stimulation significantly increased total cell number as well as neutrophil count in WT animals. In contrast, the CpG-ODN-induced inflammatory response was abolished in TLR9-D mice.

Acute lung injury (ALI) or its severe form, the acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) remains a major health problem. Recent studies have estimated the incidence of these conditions to be between 15 and 34 cases per 100,000 inhabitants per year showing an overall mortality rate of 30-40% [1-3]. Depending on the underlying etiologies ARDS can be differentiated into a direct (pulmonary) and an indirect (extrapulmonary) form (for details see [4]).

ALI/ARDS are quite common in patients with sepsis [5] and sepsis-associated ARDS carries the highest mortality rates. Despite advances in the supportive care and mechanical ventilation strategies of ALI/ARDS, mortality rates remain unacceptably high [6-8]. As the pathophysiology of the disease is not fully understood, the treatment remains mainly supportive [9-13].

Experimental models of sepsis show that bacteria and bacterial cell components induce the expression of inflammatory mediators in various tissues as well as in the blood stream [14-17]. Among these mediators, proinflammatory cytokines are regarded as a major cause for the development of organ dysfunction during sepsis [18,19].

Bacterial DNA can initiate an innate immune response via Toll-like receptor 9 (TLR9) potentially leading to septic shock [20,21], septic arthritis [22], or meningitis [23]. The bacterial genome, compared to vertebrate DNA, contains a higher frequency of unmethylated cytosine-phosphate-guanine (CpG) dinucleotides. Small oligodeoxynucleotides (ODN) with unmethylated CpG dinucleotides (CpG-ODN) are able to perfectly mimic the immunostimulatory activity of bacterial DNA since bacterial DNA and synthetic oligodeoxynucleotides share similar base sequences and bind to the same receptor system (TLR9) [24-26].

The identification of TLRs has been a major advance in the understanding of the pathogenesis of septic shock [27]. To date, 13 TLRs (TLR1-13) have been described and TLR2 and TLR4 are the best-characterized receptors so far [28,29]. TLR2 detects gram-positive bacterial cell wall components, while TLR4 can recognize cell wall components of gram-negative bacteria [30,31].

Little is known about the role of TLR9 in the lung, but constitutive expression levels have been detected in human and mouse lung endothelial cells and mouse RAW264.7 cells. High TLR9 expression levels have been found in lung tumors [15,32,33]. Others have shown that CpG-ODN contributes to local inflammation of the lung following intratracheal instillation [32,34]. However, to our knowledge nothing is known regarding systemic effects of CpG-ODN and pulmonary inflammation. Therefore, we injected bacterial DNA intraperitoneally to answer the question whether bacterial DNA induces lung inflammation in a TLR9-dependent manner.

The standard protocol for stimulation consisted of D-galactosamine sensitization (D-GalN; Roth, Karlsruhe, Germany) intraperitoneally (i.p.) with 1 mg/kg. 30 min later, mice received i.p. either 1 mL/kg saline (sal) or 1 nmol/g CpG-ODN (Thioat 1668; containing a "CG-motif": 5'-TCC-ATG-ACG-TTC-CTG-ATG-CT; TibMolBiol, Berlin, Germany). The stimulatory dose of 1 nmol/g BW was chosen according to earlier studies [20,21,25], which was sufficient to induce clinical symptoms of sepsis. Organs were harvested at 1, 2, 4 and 6 hours after stimulation with CpG-ODN. Unless otherwise stated in the manuscript groups consisted of 5 animals. In control experiments, stimulation with D-GalN alone for up to 6 hrs did not influence the mRNA expression of TNF-alpha, IL-1beta and IL-6 detected by RNase Protection Assay.

Additional experiments were carried out injecting CpG-ODN intratracheally to further understand its effect during lung inflammation. Intratracheally, CpG-ODN was administered at a dose of 1 nmol/g BW. After intratracheal administration, lung myeloperoxidase, cytokine expression and leukocyte count were studied.

Total RNA from murine tissue was isolated with the guanidinum thiocyanate method [35]. RNA concentration was determined by absorbance at 260 nm. Until further processing, RNA was dissolved in 100 muL of RNase-free water and stored at -80degreesC. Reverse transcription was performed using QIAGEN Omniscript Reverse Transcription kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) according to the manufacturer's protocol. 1 mug RNA was used in 20 muL reaction mixtures containing 2 muL 10x Reverse Transcription Buffer, 2 muL dNTP mixture (5 mM of each dNTP), 1 muL Omniscript Reverse Transcriptase and 2 muL oligo-dT primers. The specific pre-made TaqMan(R)Gene Expression Assays (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA) for murine TLR9 (Mm00446193 m1, amplicon length: 60 bp) and murine GAPDH (Mm999999915 q1) as housekeeping gene were used in this study. Real-time PCR was performed according to the manufacturer's protocol. 100 ng of single-stranded cDNA was mixed with supplied 2 x TaqMan Universal Master Mix (PN 4304437, Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA) and 1 muL of TaqMan(R)Gene Expression Assay to a final volume of 10 mul in a 384-well optical reaction plate. Each sample underwent 40 cycles of amplification in a 384-well optical reaction plate on an ABI PRISM(R) Sequence Detection Systems (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA). Relative quotients (RQ) of TLR9 gene expression comparing control mice with stimulated mice at different time-points were calculated with SDS Software 2.2 (Applied Systems, Foster City, CA, USA). RQ results were analyzed with GraphPad Prism 4.05 (GraphPad Software, San Diego, USA).

To determine whether increased mRNA expression paralleled also increased cytokine protein levels in the lung, we tested the in vivo induction of TNF-alpha and IL-1beta protein expression in WT and TLR9-D mice by ELISA. Figures 4A and 4B illustrate that CpG-ODN administration led to a significant increase in protein expression of TNF-alpha and IL-1beta in pulmonary tissue from control mice. A significant increase in cytokine production can be observed 1 hr after injection of CpG-ODN with a peak protein expression at 2 hrs. At 2 hrs, TNF-alpha and IL-1beta protein levels were significantly higher in WT compared to TLR9-D mice. Figures 4A and 4B show that the kinetics of TNF-alpha and IL-1beta protein production parallels the up-regulation of the corresponding mRNA-transcripts.

To exclude solely extrapulmonary effects of CpG-ODN on the lung, WT- and TLR9-D mice received CpG-ODN also intratracheally. This route of administration again resulted in lung inflammation, e.g. demonstrated by a significant cytokine response in WT animals. 2 hrs after CpG-ODN challenge, pulmonary TNF-alpha tissue levels were significantly increased in WT mice (7.0 +/- 0.6 pg/mg tissue) when compared to TLR9-D animals (0.6 +/- 0.2 pg/mg tissue; p < 0.05). Also IL-1beta levels were significantly raised in WT mice (62 +/- 12 pg/mg tissue) when compared to TLR9-D animals (16 +/- 1 pg/mg tissue; p < 0.05).

CpG-ODN-treated WT animals showed a significant increase in the plasma levels of the cytokines TNF-alpha and IL-6 after 2 hrs. Similarly, plasma levels of IL-1beta increased as well after 2 hrs without reaching statistical significance. These effects were not detectable in CpG-ODN-treated TLR9-D mice (Figure 5).

The initial host's defense against bacterial infections is essentially executed by pattern-recognition receptors. TLR 2, 4 and 5 have been implicated in bacterial signaling, innate immunity and lung inflammation [40-44]. Little is known about the role of TLR9 in the lung, but constitutive expression levels have been detected in mouse lung endothelial cells, mouse RAW264.7 cells, rat pulmonary microvascular endothelial cells and rat pulmonary artery endothelial cells [15]. High TLR9 expression levels have been found in lung tumors [15,32,33,45]. Interestingly, TLR9 is not expressed in all cells present in the lung. For instance, TLR9 is absent in rat pulmonary arterial smooth muscle cells [15], mouse pulmonary macrophages [46] and in lung dendritic cells [47]. This is in conflict with other reports demonstrating the existence of TLR9 in lung dendritic cells [46-48].

It is thought that TLR9 is able to enhance the uptake of long-chain double-stranded (ds) DNA, although single-stranded (ss) CpG-ODNs appear to be sequence-independently endocytosed. TLR9 is localized in the endoplasmatic reticulum and following CpG stimulation recruited to endosomal vesicles. Then, TLR9 and CpG-ODN co-localize resulting in cell activation [49,50]. The exact molecular structure of TLR9 is unknown, although some evidence exists that leucine-rich repeats are responsible for the recognition of distinct pathogen structures by TLRs. Following CpG-ODN binding, TLR9 associates with the adaptor molecule MyD88 resulting in activation of the IL-1 receptor-associated kinase (IRAK) family, mitogen activated kinases (MAPK), or IFN regulatory factors. The latter events activate NFkappaB among other transcription factors (for detailed review please refer to [51]).

Our study demonstrates a TLR9-dependent mechanism of lung inflammation. This is supported by the finding that an intraperitoneal application of CpG-ODN (extrapulmonary stimulus) leads to a systemic and local inflammatory response in WT mice, which was abolished in TLR9-D animals. Our data are in accordance with others that TLR9 is expressed in homogenisates of pulmonary tissue [15,32,33]. In addition, we observed that CpG-ODN challenge did not significantly change TLR9 expression over time. In gram-negative sepsis TLR4 expression in murine lungs did also not change; however, the expression of CD14, a co-receptor of TLR4, was up-regulated [44]. This may indicate that TLRs are differentially regulated. It is known that TLR9 stimulation leads to the activation of NFkappaB in various tissues [51]. To our knowledge, our study shows for the first time that pulmonary NFkappaB activity is up-regulated following CpG-ODN application. This is further supported by the observation that NFkappaB is not activated in TLR9-D animals upon CpG-ODN stimulation. In addition, CpG-ODN led to a significant increase of NFkappaB-dependent, proinflammatory cytokine expression (TNF-alpha, IL-1beta) in pulmonary tissue. However, CpG-ODN did not induce an inflammatory response in TLR9-D mice indicating a TLR9-dependency. In correspondence with the presented gene expression of proinflammatory cytokines, the protein expression of TNF-alpha and IL-1beta was significantly higher in WT animals when compared to TLR9-D mice. Furthermore, plasma levels of TNF-alpha and IL-6 indicate systemic inflammation in WT animals. In contrast, levels of these cytokines did not change in TLR9-D mice after CpG-challenge. This further supports our concept that CpG-ODN mediates its proinflammatory effects via TLR9. In a small pilot study we could confirm findings from others [34,52] that local (intratracheally) CpG-ODN administration also caused an inflammatory response in the lung (pulmonary stimulus), which was absent in TLR9-D mice. These findings suggest that CpG-ODN-induced lung inflammation can be initiated by both, local and systemic TLR9 activation.

Increased content of lung myeloperoxidase activity, an indicator of polymorphonuclear cells (PMNs) accumulation, was documented in WT mice following application of CpG-ODN. In WT mice, MPO increased significantly 6 hrs after CpG-ODN stimulation, whereas TLR9-D mice exhibited no increase in MPO activity. To further characterize the cellular recruitment in the pulmonary system after CpG-ODN induced inflammation a series of BALs were carried out. Since PMNs are rarely found in BAL from normal pathogen-free mice, we used this cell type as an inflammatory marker. We found a significant induction of total cell count in WT mice after CpG-ODN challenge. In particular, neutrophil counts were induced in the BAL of WT mice compared to TLR9-D animals. BALs obtained from all animal groups were not contaminated by peripheral blood indicating migration as the underlying factor. These data suggest that a significant recruitment of inflammatory cells into the alveolar space occurs after CpG-ODN stimulation.

Our findings suggest that CpG-ODN induces an inflammatory response via TLR9. In an in vivo setting of inflammation it is unlikely that bacterial DNA acts as the sole virulence factor. Other pathogenic ligands such as lipopolysaccharide and flagellin will contribute to the induction of inflammation. Recent studies have demonstrated that other TLRs and their respective ligands are also responsible for pulmonary cytokine production and pulmonary injury [42,43,53]. However, it remains unclear to what extent single virulence factors contribute to an inflammatory response. Further studies will be necessary to solve this issue.

In summary, we demonstrate that CpG-ODN causes NFkappaB activation, leading to the induction of various cytokines in the lung and plasma and finally lung inflammation. These effects were absent in TLR9-D mice. We propose the TLR9 signalling cascade as an additional pathway to induce pulmonary inflammation.
