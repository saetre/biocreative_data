We have determined the sequence of a 2.5 kb mRNA in human fibroblasts encoding a 248 amino acid cytoskeletal tropomyosin. The protein product of this mRNA is TM30nm, one of five tropomyosin-like proteins in human fibroblasts. The structural gene encoding this mRNA can also produce a 1.3 kb mRNA encoding a 285 amino acid skeletal muscle alpha-tropomyosin by tissue-specific alternative mRNA splicing. However, the multiple RNA-copy pseudogenes of this gene family are derived largely if not exclusively from transcripts processed according to the pattern observed in non-muscle cells.
