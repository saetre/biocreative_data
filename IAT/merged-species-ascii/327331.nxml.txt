A novel globin cDNA recombinant (pFG5) has been isolated from a 14-15 day Porton mouse foetal liver cDNA library. It codes for a beta-like globin mRNA expressed in foetal liver-derived erythroblasts and erythrocytes but not in adult reticulocytes nor in yolk sac derived nucleated erythrocytes. It is also found in Friend cells induced to differentiate by DMSO. The nucleotide sequence of pFG5 confirms that it does not code for the beta major or beta minor globin chains nor the embryonic epsilon Y2 globin chain; but it is identical to the published partial sequence of the epsilon Y3 globin gene over the region of overlap (78 nucleotides).
