Purified rat lingual lipase (EC3113), a glycoprotein of approximate molecular weight 52,000, was used to generate polyclonal antibodies which were able to recognise the denatured and deglycosylated enzyme. These immunoglobulins were used to screen a cDNA library prepared from mRNA isolated from the serous glands of rat tongue cloned in E. coli expression vectors. An almost full length cDNA clone was isolated and the nucleotide and predicted amino acid sequence obtained. Comparison with the N-terminal amino acid sequence of the purified enzyme confirmed the identity of the cDNA and indicated that there was a hydrophobic signal sequence of 18 residues. The amino acid sequence of mature rat lingual lipase consists of 377 residues and shares little homology with porcine pancreatic lipase apart from a short region containing a serine residue at an analogous position to the ser 152 of the porcine enzyme.
