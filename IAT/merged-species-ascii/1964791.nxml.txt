Previous studies suggest that chemokines (chemotactic cytokines) promote and regulate neoplastic progression including metastasis and angiogenesis. The chemokine eotaxin-1 is a powerful eosinophil attractant but also exerts chemotaxis of other leukocytes. Eotaxin-1 has been implicated in gastrointestinal disorders and may play an important role in colorectal mucosal immunity.

The objective of this study was to assess the role of eotaxin-1 in colorectal cancer (CRC). Levels of eotaxin-1 protein in CRC tissues (n = 86) and paired normal mucosa were compared after determination by ELISA. Plasma eotaxin-1 levels from CRC patients (n = 67) were also compared with controls (n = 103) using the same method. Moreover, a TaqMan system was used to evaluate the -384A>G eotaxin-1 gene variant in CRC patients (n = 241) and in a control group (n = 253).

Eotaxin-1 protein levels in colorectal tumours were significantly (P < 0.0001) higher than in normal tissue. Immunohistochemistry revealed eotaxin-1 expression in stromal cells such as fibroblasts and leukocytes of the CRC tissue. The plasma eotaxin-1 level in CRC patients was lower compared with controls (P < 0.0001). Patients with tumours classified as Dukes' stage B and C had lower levels than patients with tumours in Dukes' stage A. We found no difference in genotype distribution but noted a difference regarding allele distribution (P = 0.036) and a dominance of allele G in rectal cancer patients.

The up-regulated eotaxin-1 protein expression in cancer tissue may reflect an eotaxin-1 mediated angiogenesis and/or a recruitment of leukocytes with potential antitumourigenic role. We noticed a dominance of the G allele in rectal cancer patients compared with colon cancer patients that was independent of eotaxin-1 expression.

Previous studies show that chemokines (chemotactic cytokines) are important factors promoting leukocyte attraction to sites of inflammation and cancer [1-3]. Some of the chemokines may promote and regulate neoplastic progression including metastasis and angiogenesis [4,5].

In the gastrointestinal tract the intestinal mucosa regulates trafficking of the leukocytes by chemokines such as CXCL5, CXCL8 and CXCL12 [6,7]. The chemokine eotaxin-1 (CCL11) is one member of the eotaxin gene family (eotaxin-1, eotaxin-2 and eotaxin-3) which is a group of eosinophil chemoattractants [8]. Eotaxin-1 binds exclusively to the receptor CCR3, which is present on eosinophils. Basophils, mast cells, Th2 cells, dendritic cells and endothelial cells also express CCR3 at variable levels [9-11]. Eosinophil accumulation in the peripheral blood and tissues is a marker of several diseases such as viral and parasitic infections, atopic disorders, eosinophilic gastroenteritis and pneumonia [12]. In the gastrointestinal tract, eotaxin-1 is expressed in mucosa and it has been suggested that eotaxin-1 has an important role in the maintenance of normal eosinophil homeostasis [13]. The expression of eotaxin-1 has been identified in macrophages, eosinophils, epithelial cells, endothelial cells, fibroblasts, malignant epithelial cells and smooth muscle cells [14-18]. Consequently, eosinophils seem to have the capacity to generate their own autocrine chemoattractant factor eotaxin-1 [19].

Eotaxin-1 may play a role in a number of chronic inflammatory diseases such as sinusitis, nasal polyposis, rhinitis, ulcerative colitis and other gastrointestinal disorders [9,20]. Increased plasma levels of eotaxin-1 have been shown in coronary artery disease and inflammatory bowel disease [21,22]. Moreover, it has been suggested that eotaxin-1 may protect against tumour progression by recruiting eosinophils with a capacity to release cytotoxic proteins [14].

Several single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of the eotaxin-1 gene have recently been described. One of these, the -384A>G variant, is located at the promoter region of the eotaxin-1 gene and has been shown to have functional effects on eotaxin-1 synthesis. This variant correlated significantly with an elevated plasma eotaxin-1 level in asthmatic patients. It has been postulated that the -384A>G locus may exert its influence through change in the eotaxin-1 gene transcription [23].

Fourteen tumour samples were available for immunohistochemical staining for determination of the cell type origin of eotaxin-1 expression. Staining was performed on 4 mum sections from formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue blocks, using a standard protocol. Endogenous peroxidase activity was quenched by treatment with 3% hydrogen peroxide for 5 min. Sections were subsequently incubated with a primary mouse anti-human monoclonal CCL11/eotaxin-1 antibody (R&D Systems Europe, UK) in appropriate dilution overnight at 4degreesC. After rinsing in TRIS-buffered saline, sections were incubated with secondary biotinylated goat anti-mouse IgG (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, USA). Avidin-biotin peroxidase complexes (Dako Cytomation Denmark) were added, followed by visualization with 3,3'-diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride (Dako Cytomation). All sections were counterstained with Mayer's hematoxylin (Histolab Products AB, Sweden).

There was no significant difference in genotype distribution or in allelic frequencies, between CRC patients and control subjects (Table 1). When subdividing the patients in groups, colon (n = 121) versus rectum (n = 120), we noted a weak anomaly (P = 0.065) in genotype distribution (Table 2). However, we found a significant difference regarding allele distribution (P = 0.036). When assessing this difference we noticed a 51.7% (124/240) dominance of the G allele in rectal cancer patients compared with 42.1% (102/242) in colon cancer patients. When testing the allele distribution in colon and rectal cancer patients compared with control subjects respectively we found a dominance of the G allele in the rectal cancer patients (P = 0.036). No difference was seen in colon cancer patients compared with controls (P = 0.73). The genotype and allelic distributions in CRC patients and the control group were not associated with clinical characteristics such as age, gender, or Dukes' stage. All genotype distributions were in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium.

Eotaxin-1 is an eosinophil chemoattractant, expressed in the gastrointestinal mucosa by several stromal cells, which can also regulate chemotaxis of other cells such as basophils, Th2 lymphocytes and mast cells [8-10]. Eotaxin-1 seems to play a potential role in a number of diseases such as gastrointestinal disorders [9] and it has been suggested that eotaxin-1 could play a protective role against tumour progression [14], probably as a factor in tumour immune surveillance [22].

One SNP of the eotaxin-1 gene, -384A>G, has been showed to have a functional role in regulation of gene expression, and thus influences the eotaxin-1 synthesis. The presence of allele G is associated with higher plasma concentration of eotaxin-1 in asthmatic patients [23]. In our study, we focused on this SNP and showed that the genotype distribution and allelic frequency were not significantly associated with CRC patients as compared to controls. We did not detect any association between genotype and eotaxin-1 plasma concentration in plasma samples. However, we found a significant difference regarding allele distribution between rectal and colon cancer and noted a dominance of allele G in rectal cancer patients. In addition, we have demonstrated the distribution of the eotaxin-1 gene variant -384A>G in a Swedish population, for the first time.

Possible differences in the carcinogenesis of colonic and rectal carcinomas have been reported [24]. Hypothetically, different mechanisms may be involved in the cancer susceptibility in colon and rectum depending partly on allele G.

In diseases with immune and inflammatory response, such as Crohn's disease and Sjogren's syndrome, the circulating level of eotaxin-1 compared to controls is higher and lower, respectively [21,25]. In addition, a negative correlation between the circulating level of eotaxin-1 and eosinophil counts has been noted in Crohn's disease [21]. We found a significantly lower eotaxin-1 plasma level in CRC patients than in controls, and this difference increases with increasing Dukes' stage. Referring to the studies above [21,25], and our investigation, the findings indicate that there may be different mechanisms of immune regulation in different disease entities. Our study may show an imbalance in production of plasma eotaxin-1 from eosinophils or endothelial cells in CRC patients, and that a lower plasma eotaxin-1 level may reflect disease status of CRC. The discrepancy between tissue and plasma level ratio of eotaxin-1 in CRC may be explained by a biological difference that influences the secretion of eotaxin-1 in CRC tissue.

Using ELISA, we noted a significantly higher expression of eotaxin-1 protein in cancer tissue in comparison to matched normal tissue. Evaluation of the relative expression (tumour vs. normal tissue) showed 74.4% up-regulation. By using immunohistochemistry to determine the origin of the eotaxin-1 protein expression in CRC patient tissues we found immunoreactivity localised to stromal cells such as fibroblasts and leukocytes.

Very few reports have investigated eotaxin-1 expressing cells in relation to CRC outcome. Higher amount of eosinophilic infiltration of CRC has been reported to be a favourable prognostic indicator in CRC patients [26,27]. On the other hand, gastric carcinoma with eosinophilia correlates with unfavourable prognosis [28]. It has been suggested that eotaxin-1 directly mediates angiogenesis by CCR3+ endothelial cells [11]. This effect may contribute to tumour growth and thereby poor prognosis in CRC. Thus, the role of eotaxin-1 and eosinophilia is not fully evaluated in CRC. We noted a significantly up-regulated eotaxin-1 level in cancer tissue which may reflect a potential eotaxin-1 mediated angiogenesis. Alternatively, this could mediate protection against tumour progress by recruitment of eosinophils and/or other CCR3+ leukocytes with an antitumourigenic role.

The pathophysiological significance of the observed up-regulation remains unclear until basal mechanisms describing the transcriptional regulation and the signalling pathway of eotaxin-1 expression in CRC are elucidated. To date, little is known with regard to the influence of eotaxin-1 gene polymorphisms on the levels of eotaxin-1 in normal and neoplastic human tissues.

We noticed a dominance of the G allele in rectal cancer patients compared with colon cancer patients that was independent of eotaxin-1 expression. The -384A>G eotaxin-1 gene variant may be partly involved in the pathogenesis of cancer in the rectum and colon. The up-regulated eotaxin-1 protein expression in cancer tissue represented by stromal cells may reflect an eotaxin-1 mediated angiogenesis and/or a recruitment of leukocytes with potential antitumourigenic effect. Finally, the plasma levels of eotaxin-1 were lower in CRC patients compared to controls, and the suppression seems to be more pronounced in severe disease stage.
