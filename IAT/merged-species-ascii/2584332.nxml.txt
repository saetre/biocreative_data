Two of the most common signalling pathways in breast cancer are the ER (oestrogen receptor) ligand activation pathway and the E-cadherin snai1 slug EMT (epithelial-mesenchymal transition) pathway. Although these pathways have been thought to interact indirectly, the present study is the first to observe direct interactions between these pathways that involves the regulation of slug expression. Specifically we report that ligand-activated ERalpha suppressed slug expression directly by repression of transcription and that knockdown of ERalpha with RNA interference increased slug expression. More specifically, slug expression was down-regulated in ERalpha-negative MDA-MB-468 cells transfected with ERalpha after treatment with E2 (17beta-oestradiol). The down-regulation of slug in the ERalpha-positive MCF-7 cell line was mediated by direct repression of slug transcription by the formation of a co-repressor complex involving ligand-activated ERalpha protein, HDAC1 (histone deacetylase 1) and N-CoR (nuclear receptor co-repressor). This finding was confirmed by sequential ChIP (chromatin immunoprecipitation) studies. In the MCF-7 cell line, slug expression normally was low. In addition, knockdown of ERalpha with RNA interference in this cell line increased slug expression. This effect could be partially reversed by treatment of the cells with E2. The efficacy of the effect of ERalpha on slug repression was dependent on the overall level of ERalpha. These observations confirmed that slug was an E2-responsive gene.

Two of the most common signalling pathways in breast cancer are the ER (oestrogen receptor) ligand activation pathway and the E-cadherin-snai1-slug [where snai1 is snail homologue 1 and slug (also known as snai2) is snail homologue 2] EMT (epithelial-mesenchymal transition) pathway. ERalpha is a ligand-activated nuclear hormone receptor that regulates the transcription of oestrogen-responsive genes in diverse target cells [1]. ERalpha and its main ligand, E2 (17beta-oestradiol), play a critical role in many of the biological processes of normal cells located in the breast, reproductive tract, central nervous system, skeleton and immune system [1]. Similarly ERalpha and its ligand regulate key pathways in ERalpha-positive human breast cancer. Two functional domains have been identified in ERalpha, the transcription activation function domain 1 (termed AF-1) in the N-terminus and domain 2 (termed AF-2) which binds ligand. The AF-1 domain is ligand-independent and constitutive, whereas the function of AF-2 is completely dependent on ligand binding [2 5]. According to the classical model of ER action, in the absence of hormone, the receptor is sequestered in a multiprotein inactive complex in either the cytoplasm or nuclei of target cells. The binding of ligand induces an activating conformational change within the ER, promoting dimerization and high-affinity binding to specific EREs (oestrogen-response elements) located within the regulatory regions of target genes [6]. These 'co-activator' complexes enable the ER: (i) to respond appropriately to hormones or pharmacological ligands, (ii) to interpret extra- and intra-cellular signals, (iii) to catalyse the process of chromatin condensation, and (iv) to communicate with the general transcription apparatus at target gene promoters [6]. The action of ligand-activated ERalpha is not limited to genes with EREs. Ligand-activated ERalpha can interact in an indirect manner with the regulatory regions of target genes lacking EREs. For example, ERalpha-mediated expression of the collagenase and IGF-1 (insulin-like growth factor 1) genes is mediated through the interaction of ERalpha with Fos and Jun at AP-1 (activator protein 1)-binding sites [6]. In any case, ligand activation of ERalpha sets off a complex series of gene activations in the human breast cancer cell. The ER ligand activation pathway is one of the most important signalling pathways in human breast cancer that has been targeted therapeutically.

The E-cadherin-snai1-slug EMT pathway is another important pathway in human breast cancer progression thought to regulate tumour progression, invasion and metastasis of certain types of human breast cancer [7,8]. The snail transcription family consisting of members snai1 and snai2 (slug) is thought to repress E-cadherin expression, leading to EMT [7]. Snail-induced EMT converts epithelial cells into mesenchymal cells with migratory properties that contribute to the formation of many tissues during embryonic development and to the acquisition of invasive properties in epithelial tumours. Snail-induced EMT is partly due to the direct repression of E-cadherin transcription both during development and tumour progression [9]. This pathway is also activated in malignant mesothelioma and other carcinomas [7,8]. Although snail (snai1 and snai2) has been mostly studied in EMT, even when tumours do not exhibit classic EMT, up-regulated snai1 or snai2 (slug) may mediate invasion and metastasis. In squamous cell carcinomas of the oesophagus, tumours with positive slug expression, for example, invaded deeper, had more lymph node metastasis, and had more lymphatic invasion than tumours with negative slug expression [10]. Although the functions of slug during EMT, invasion and metastasis are being elucidated, comparatively little is known about slug regulation.

As the major signalling pathways in breast cancer continue to be characterized, it is important to identify interactions between these pathways so that they can be understood more fully. Because of the inverse correlation that we had observed recently (Y. Ye, Y. Xiao, W. Wang, K. Yearsley, J.-X. Gao and S. H. Barsky, unpublished work) between ER and slug expression in a number of different ER-positive and ER-negative human breast carcinoma cell lines, we wondered whether the two pathways, previously thought to interact indirectly [11], might, in fact, interact directly.

Human full-length ERalpha Ultimate ORF (IOH34665; ORF is open reading frame) was purchased from Invitrogen. The ERalpha ORF was cloned into the entry vector pENTR221 and subcloned into vectors pcDNA6.2/V5 using the LR recombination reaction according to the manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen). We initially performed transient transfections and subsequently performed stable transfections with clonal selection. The recombinant vector pcDNA6.2/V5-ERalpha containing ERalpha ORF or the empty (control) vector pcDNA6.2/V5 was transfected directly into cultured cells using Lipofectaminetrade mark 2000 (Invitrogen) for either transient or stable transfection. Blasticidin (10 mug/ml) (EMD Chemicals) was used to select for stable clones.

Knockdown of ERalpha was achieved with an RNAi (RNA interference) approach using either miRNA (microRNA) to obtain stable clones, or siRNA (small interfering RNA) for transient, but more effective, knockdown. The nucleotide sequences of ERalpha miRNA were as follows: 5'-TGCTGAGTCATTGCACACTGCACAGTGTTTTGGCCACTGACTGACACTGTGCAGTGCAATGACT-3' (sense) and 5'-CCTGAGTCATTGCACTGCACAGTGTCAGTCAGTGGCCAAAACACTGTGCAGTGTGCAATGACTC-3' (antisense). These single strands of miRNA were annealed to form double-strand miRNA DNA and inserted into the BLOCK-iT Pol II miR RNAi Expression vector, pcDNA6.2-GW/EmGFP-miR (Invitrogen). MCF-7 cells were grown overnight and transfected with recombinant plasmid pcDNA6.2-GW/EmGFP-miR-ERalpha that expressed ERalpha miRNA or empty plasmid (negative control). Blasticidin (10 mug/ml) was used to select for stable clones.

The ChIP assay was performed using a ChIP kit (Millipore) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, 2x106 cells were treated with 1% formaldehyde for 10 min at 37 degreesC. The cells were harvested, suspended with SDS lysis buffer [1% SDS, 10 mM EDTA and 50 mM Tris/HCl (pH 8.3)], and incubated on ice for 10 min. Lysates were sonicated, and debris was removed from the samples by centrifugation for 10 min at 10000 g. An aliquot of each chromatin solution (40 mul) was set aside and designated as the input fraction. Supernatants were diluted 10-fold in immunoprecipitation buffer and precleared with Protein A agarose beads that had been pre-absorbed with salmon sperm DNA. The precleared chromatin solution was incubated with the relevant antibodies to ERalpha, HDACs 1, 3 and 4, N-CoR, IKKalpha and SRC-3 separately for 16 h at 4 degreesC. Normal IgG was used as a negative control. The immune complexes were then collected with the addition of Sepharose A/G plus agarose beads, followed by several washes with appropriate buffers, according to the manufacturer's instructions. Each sample was eluted with freshly prepared 1% SDS and 0.1 M NaHCO3, and then histone-DNA cross-links were reversed with the addition of 5 M NaCl. Chromatin-associated proteins were digested with proteinase K (10 mg/ml), and the immunoprecipitated DNA was recovered by phenol/chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation and analysed by PCR. The primers used for ChIP were as follows: slug (-456 to -68) 5'-TGGTCTTTGTGCAAGGCAAACCTC-3' (sense) and 5'-AGGTTCAGATTTCAGCTCCTCCCT-3' (antisense); slug (-2178 to -1973) 5'-ACCTGTTTCGTCTGACTCAC GCCATC-3' (sense), 5'-CCATCAGCAGGTATCCGAGGGTGC-3' (antisense).

To investigate the effect of ERalpha on the expression of slug, we initially performed transient transfections of full-length ERalpha into ERalpha-negative MDA-MB-468 cells. The recombinant vector pcDNA6.2/V5-ERalpha containing ERalpha or the empty (control) vector pcDNA6.2/V5 was transfected directly into cultured MDA-MB-468 cells. At 3 days after transfection, the cells were analysed for ERalpha protein levels by Western blot and slug mRNA using real-time PCR. The results showed that ERalpha was overexpressed in pcDNA6.2/V5-ERalpha-transfected cells, but not in the empty (control) vector-transfected cells (Figure 1A). Although we observed a small increase in slug mRNA levels in cells transfected with pcDNA6.2/V5-ERalpha alone in the absence of E2, we observed a more dramatic decrease in slug mRNA when these cells were treated with E2 (Figure 1B). Cells transfected with the empty (control) vector showed no increase or decrease in slug mRNA in either the absence or presence of E2 respectively (Figure 1B). For the stable transfections, we used blasticidin to initially select for 35 different clones of MDA-MB-468. Of these, 21 clones overexpressed ERalpha by both real-time PCR and Western blot analysis (Figure 1C). In some of the stably transfected ERalpha-expressing MDA-MB-468 clones, the expression of the slug gene was augmented in the absence of E2. In other clones the unliganded ERalpha had no effect on slug gene expression, but E2 dramatically suppressed slug expression. Based on these observations, it could be concluded that ERalpha was a bi-functional regulator for the expression of the slug gene, in that the unliganded ERalpha was an activator, whereas the E2-bound-ERalpha acted as a repressor, depending upon the specific clone studied. We wondered whether our observations might be more than just stochastic and related to the levels of ERalpha expressed by each clone. We measured the levels of ERalpha protein by Western blot analysis in the different clones and investigated whether the effects of unliganded ERalpha were activating and whether the effects of E2-bound-ERalpha were repressing based on the levels of ERalpha. What we observed was very interesting. In clones 4 and 23 ERalpha was expressed at very high levels (Figure 1D), and it was in these two clones that E2-bound-ERalpha repression of slug was far greater and statistically significant (P<0.01) than the activating effects of unliganded ER which were not statistically significant (P>0.1) (Figure 1C). In clones 2 and 17 where ERalpha expression was much lower (Figure 1D), the activating effects of unliganded ER were greater than the repression effects of E2-bound ERalpha, but both were statistically significant (P<0.01 and P<0.05) (Figure 1C). A similar pattern of activation versus repression was exhibited by the remaining clones depending on their relative levels of ERalpha. Our results in these stable-transfection experiments with respect to slug repression confirmed the results of our transient-transfection experiments. Collectively the transfection experiments indicated that E2 resulted in down-regulation of slug in transfected MDA-MB-468 cells overexpressing ERalpha, with the most dramatic effects observed in those clones with the highest levels of ERalpha. In other words, slug is an E2-responsive gene when ERalpha is overexpressed, and the amount of E2-induced slug repression directly relates to the levels of ERalpha.

As a ligand-activated nuclear hormone receptor, ERalpha and its ligand E2 regulate the transcription of many oestrogen-responsive genes in diverse target cells. In addition to examining the effects of ERalpha overexpression as noted previously, we decided to knockdown ERalpha in a naturally ERalpha-expressing line, e.g. MCF-7, in order to monitor the effects on endogenous slug expression, a situation perhaps more physiologically relevant than the situation of overexpression. To investigate the effect of ERalpha knockdown on the expression of slug, ERalpha miRNA was transfected into parental MCF-7 cells and stable clones were selected with blasticidin. A total of 38 clones were selected and analysed for ERalpha mRNA levels by real-time PCR. We observed that ERalpha expression was significantly reduced to different levels in various clones (Figure 2A). These clones also showed significant increases in slug mRNA expression (Figure 2A). We then treated selected clones with E2 (clones 19 and 20). The ERalpha level of clone 19 by real-time PCR was higher than in clone 20, but when treated with E2 slug expression was decreased more in clone 19 than in clone 20 (Figure 2B). This suggested the possibility that E2 caused a stronger response in clone 19 because clone 19 had greater residual ERalpha. Another possibility was the existence of an E2-ERalpha-independent mechanism. To resolve these possibilities we needed to examine the levels of ERalpha protein expression in the different clones and we needed to carry out more effective ERalpha knockdown. The levels of ERalpha in the different clones by Western blot analysis (Figure 2C) generally correlated with the mRNA levels by real-time PCR (Figure 2A). To determine further whether the effects on repression of slug expression by E2 were mediated by residual levels of ERalpha, which was our hypothesis, or ERalpha-independent mechanisms, which was another possibility, we carried out siRNA transient ERalpha knockdown and were able to achieve a more significant and near total knockdown of ERalpha (Figure 2D). With the subsequent addition of E2, we did not observe any repression of slug expression (Figure 2E). Therefore we concluded that the effects on slug repression were indeed mediated by ERalpha. Therefore slug was also an E2-responsive gene when ERalpha was knocked down, and the amount of E2-induced slug repression was again related to the residual levels of ERalpha remaining.

Based on the aforementioned findings, we hypothesized that ligand-activated ERalpha directly binds to the promoter regulatory regions of slug and recruits known ERalpha co-regulators to form transcriptional complexes that regulate slug transcription. A search for specific EREs located within the slug promoter using MatInspector(R) Software (Genomatix(R) Software) did not reveal any classical ERE sites. However, the search revealed three half-site EREs found at positions -467, +182 and +241 respectively. To investigate whether ERalpha forms a transcriptional complex at these sites within the slug promoter, we performed ChIP assays. In these studies, we used the ERalpha-positive MCF-7 cell line as the positive control and the untransfected ERalpha-negative MDA-MB-468 cell line as the negative control. Based on the location of the putative half-site EREs, we chose a region of the slug promoter flanked by these sites and a region located far upstream of these sites as a negative control and also for normalization of ChIP signals between the two cell lines. In the MCF-7 cells, E2 treatment led to the recruitment of ERalpha to the -456 to -68, but not the -2178 to -1973, region of the slug promoter (Figure 3A). In MDA-MB-468 cells, there was no association of ERalpha to the -456 to -68 region of the slug promoter (Figure 3B). These results indicate that ligand-activated ERalpha is recruited to the slug promoter in the region spanning the half-site EREs (Figure 3C).

A number of different co-repressors interacting with ligand-activated ERalpha had been identified in recent years. Among them, HDACs were known to regulate chromatin structure through histone modification and direct interaction with transcription factors [12]. It has been reported that HDAC1 interacted with the AF-2 domain of ERalpha and suppressed ERalpha transcription activity [13]. To test whether HDAC1 or possibly other HDACs had this effect on the expression of slug, we used an HDACI on the ERalpha-positive MDA-MB-468 clone 17 (Figure 4A). In addition we examined the effects of HDAC inhibition on slug expression in the ERalpha-positive MCF-7 line. Our results indicated that HDAC inhibition increased slug expression in both lines. The level of slug mRNA in MDA-MB-468 clone 17 treated with HDACI was increased more than 4-fold compared with vehicle control (Figure 4A).

E2 treatment led to the selective recruitment of HDAC1, but not HDAC3 or HDAC4, to the -456 to -68 region of the slug promoter. Input DNA was used to normalize the results.

Based on the aforementioned findings, we hypothesized that HDACs bind to the promoter regulatory regions of slug in the same -456 to -68 region as ERalpha binds and form part of the transcriptional complex that regulates slug transcription. To investigate this, we performed ChIP assays. In the ERalpha-positive MCF-7 cells, E2 treatment led to the selective recruitment of HDAC1, but not HDAC3 or HDAC4, to the -456 to -68 region of the slug promoter (Figure 4B). HDAC3 was present before E2 treatment, but its recruitment was decreased after E2 treatment. There were low levels of associated HDAC4 that did not change after E2 treatment. Our findings indicated that only HDAC1 was recruited to the slug promoter after E2 treatment. Thus HDAC1 is the co-repressor that forms the inhibitory complex with ligand-activated ERalpha to repress slug transcription.

The co-repressor N-CoR is involved in repression associated with unliganded RAR (retinoic acid receptor) and thyroid hormone receptor [14,15]. It had been demonstrated that N-CoR also played an important role in the regulation of ERalpha target genes [16,17] by binding to ligand-activated ERalpha. It had also been demonstrated that IKKalpha and SRC-3 regulate ERalpha target genes, including cyclin D1 and c-Myc [18], by binding to ligand-activated ERalpha. For these reasons we investigated whether these co-repressors or co-activators associated with the slug promoter at the same -456 to -68 site that ERalpha bound and HDAC1 associated. The ERalpha-positive MCF-7 line was again used in the ChIP assay. E2 treatment led to the recruitment of N-CoR (Figure 5A), but not SRC-3 or IKKalpha (Figure 5B), to the -456 to -68 region of the slug promoter. These results suggested that N-CoR, but neither SRC-3 nor IKKalpha, was involved in the ligand-activated ERalpha regulation of slug transcription.

We have proposed a model to suggest that N-CoR and HDAC1 act as co-repressors that form an inhibitory complex with E2-ERalpha to suppress the expression of the slug gene. However, it is also possible that N-CoR and HDAC1 separately associated with the slug promoter without forming a complex with E2 ERalpha. If E2 ERalpha indeed formed a complex that included N-CoR and/or HDAC1, a positive signal should be observed by Re-ChIP using ERalpha and N-CoR/HDAC1 antibodies in the presence of E2. In addition, a SeqChIP analysis with ERalpha and N-CoR/HDAC1 antibodies would be expected to demonstrate that after the first ChIP with ERalpha, all of the N-CoR/HDAC1 would be immunoprecipitated and there would be nothing left to precipitate if there was no ERalpha-independent recruitment of these proteins to the slug promoter. We performed SeqChIP and Re-ChIP analyses [19,20] to investigate these possibilities (Figures 6A and 6B). First, after E2 treatment and subsequent immunoprecipitation with anti-ERalpha, we immunoprecipitated the supernatant sequentially with anti-N-CoR, anti-HDAC1 and anti-HDAC3. Our results showed that, after the first ChIP with anti-ERalpha, subsequent immunoprecipitations produced no increases in the -456 to -68 slug promoter amplifications (Figure 6B). These findings suggested that neither N-CoR nor HDAC1 bound to the slug promoter independently of the E2-ERalpha complex. Secondly, after E2 treatment, we conducted Re-ChIP on the initial anti-ERalpha immunoprecipitate, resuspended it and then immunoprecipitated it a second time separately with anti-ERalpha, anti-N-CoR, anti-HDAC1 and anti-HDAC3 antibodies. We were able to demonstrate that the second immunoprecipitations with anti-ERalpha, anti-N-CoR and anti-HDAC1 antibodies, but not anti-HDAC3, produced increased slug promoter amplifications (Figure 6A). This latter Re-ChIP indicated that N-CoR and HDAC1 indeed formed a complex with E2-ERalpha.

MCF-7 cells were grown in Phenol-Red-free DMEM supplemented with 5% DCC-FBS for 48 h, and after 12 h of serum starvation, the cells were treated with either vehicle ethanol or with 100 nM E2 for 4 h. The cells were collected and chromatin from 5x108 cells was incubated first with ERalpha antibody and the immune-precipitated complexes were then collected with the addition of Sepharose A/G plus agarose beads. The precipitated complexes (A) and supernatant (B) of each sample were used for further sequential ChIP with ERalpha, HDAC3, HDAC1 or N-CoR antibodies respectively. The amount of input promoter DNA is also shown.

These results suggest that ligand-activated ERalpha formed a transcriptional inhibitory complex comprised of N-CoR and HDAC1 which bound to the slug promoter (Figure 7).

As the major signalling pathways in breast cancer continue to be identified and characterized, it is also important to identify interactions between these pathways whenever they are present to gain a wider understanding of signalling in the breast cancer cell. Two of the most common signalling pathways in breast cancer are the ERalpha ligand activation pathway and the E-cadherin-snai1-slug EMT pathway [1-4]. Although these pathways have been shown to interact indirectly [11], the present study is the first to observe direct interactions between these pathways characterized by the suppression of slug expression by ligand-activated ERalpha. More specifically, ligand-activated ERalpha suppressed expression of slug by direct repression of transcription. Although the prevailing belief is that agonist-liganded ERalpha is usually associated with gene activation, and that the recruitment of gene repression components such as HDAC1 by ERalpha to target gene promoters occurs only when ERalpha is liganded with antagonists [6], in the present study we show the opposite: that ligand-activated ERalpha with HDAC1 suppresses slug expression.

Although there have been numerous studies that have addressed the ERalpha ligand activation pathway and the E-cadherin snai1 slug EMT pathway, very few studies have addressed their interactions. Although it had been noted that ERalpha can repress the expression of snai1 through the activation of MTA3 (metastasis-associated 1 family, member 3) that selectively targets snai1, but not slug, direct effects on either snai1 or slug transcription were not found [11]. In the present study we found direct effects of ERalpha on slug transcription.

Our laboratory had been studying E-cadherin expression in a series of ERalpha-positive and ERalpha-negative human breast cancer cell lines [21] when we observed by expression profiling that many ERalpha-negative lines which were also E-cadherin-negative (e.g. MDA-MB-468 and MDA-MB-231) exhibited high slug expression. Conversely, in many ERalpha-positive lines which were also E-cadherin positive, we observed that slug expression was low or absent. These initial observations suggested that the ligand-activated ERalpha might regulate slug expression and thereby interact with the E-cadherin snai1 slug EMT signalling pathway. For this reason we decided to investigate this interaction more fully. In the present study, we addressed one mechanism by which ERalpha controlled the expression of slug. This mechanism was that ligand-activated ERalpha suppressed slug transcription through direct association with the slug promoter, where ERalpha interacted with recruited co-regulators. Therefore slug was an ERalpha-responsive gene.

Human breast cancers which lack ligand-activated ERalpha may then overexpress slug, which may down-regulate E-cadherin and lead to EMT. EMT is thought to be a cause of biological aggressiveness, invasion and metastasis. Breast cancers, on the other hand, which possess ligand-activated ERalpha may express low or absent levels of slug, increased E-cadherin, decreased EMT and less aggressive behaviour. No model is universal and there are certainly ERalpha-positive breast cancers such as infiltrating lobular cancer which strongly express ERalpha but are negative for E-cadherin and manifest EMT. Conversely there are ERalpha-negative breast cancers, such as inflammatory breast cancer, that are strongly E-cadherin positive [22]. We have observed in these latter cancers overexpression of snai1 and slug, and believe that the basis of E-cadherin overexpression in inflammatory breast cancer is related to altered E-cadherin trafficking, increased rates of accumulation and lack of degradation, rather than transcriptional regulation (Y. Ye, W. Wang, K. Yearsley, J.-X. Gao and S. H. Barsky, unpublished work).

The present studies show that E2 treatment resulted in down-regulation of slug in transfected MDA-MB-468 clones expressing full-length ERalpha. In addition to examining the effects of ERalpha overexpression, our studies examined the effects of ERalpha gene knockdown in a naturally expressing ERalpha line, e.g. MCF-7, in order to monitor the effects on endogenous slug expression. The result of ERalpha knockdown was a significant increase in slug mRNA levels even though the effect could be partially reversed by treatment of the cells with E2, based on our hypothesis that there was still significant residual ERalpha. To support this hypothesis further, near-complete knockdown was achieved with siRNA and the effect of E2 on slug repression was completely abolished. The overexpression and knockdown studies of ERalpha in tandem reveal that the efficacy of the effect of ERalpha on slug repression was dependent on the overall level of ERalpha. These observations confirmed that slug indeed was an E2-responsive gene.

Our findings indicated that ligand-activated ERalpha forms, together with HDAC1 and N-CoR, a transcriptional inhibitory complex which probably binds to the slug promoter in a region containing half-site EREs. Because we did not know which of these half ERE sites might be the location of the binding of the transcription inhibitory complex, we chose a promoter region flanked by these sites that would probably be precipitated in the ChIP analyses if any of these half ERE sites were involved. Our findings still do not indicate the precise location of the binding of the complex or whether more than one half ERE site is involved. Our findings with SeqChIP do confirm that E2 ERalpha, HDAC1 and N-CoR together form an inhibitory complex and that HDAC1 and N-CoR do not independently associate with the slug promoter.

It has been demonstrated previously that the recruitment of co-regulatory proteins to ERalpha is required for ERalpha-mediated transcriptional and biological activities [13,16 18] and that these co-regulatory proteins may include HDACs, N-CoR, SRC-3 and IKKalpha. In the case of slug, however, these co-regulatory proteins specifically included HDAC1 and N-CoR, but not other HDACs or SRC-3 or IKKalpha. Predictably, an HDACI increased slug expression. Although HDACIs are thought to have global effects on gene expression and therefore could have increased slug expression by other indirect or secondary mechanisms, the finding that E2 increased the HDAC1, but not other HDACs that were immunoprecipitated from the same region of the slug promoter (-456 to -68) where ligand-activated ERalpha was immunoprecipitated, indicated that ERalpha was probably the target for HDACI-alleviated slug gene expression. This finding further confirmed that ligand-activated ERalpha suppressed slug expression by transcriptional repression and that the ER ligand activation pathway interacts with the E-cadherin-snai1-slug EMT pathways directly by repressing slug.
