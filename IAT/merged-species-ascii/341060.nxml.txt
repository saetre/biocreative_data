We have constructed a cDNA library from the mRNA of a rat liver cell line (BRL-3A) and characterized cDNA clones encoding the protein precursor of the rat insulin-like growth factor II (pre-pro-rIGF-II). This precursor, inferred from the nucleotide sequence, consists of a signal peptide, the rIGF-II sequence, and a trailer polypeptide of unknown significance. The characterized cDNA sequence (1016 nt) is part of a 3.4 kb mRNA species. Northern analysis reveals that a probe containing the extreme 5' noncoding region hybridizes to a second RNA (1.6 kb), while a probe corresponding to the 5' noncoding region proximal to the coding region hybridizes to two other RNA species (1.75 and 1.1 kb). All four RNAs are differentially expressed in all of the neonatal tissues that were examined, while the 3.4 kb pre-pro-rIGF-II mRNA and the 1.1 kb transcript are absent from adult tissues.
