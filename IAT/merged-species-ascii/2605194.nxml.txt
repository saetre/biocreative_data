We investigated the mechanism by which proinflammatory stimulation induces microvascular endothelial barrier dysfunction. Since protein phosphatase type 2A (PP2A) can mediate paracellular leak and can be inactivated by tyrosine phosphorylation in its catalytic subunit (PP2Ac), we hypothesized that microvascular endothelial cells exposed to proinflammatory stimulation produce peroxynitrite that nitrates PP2Ac, and this nitration inhibits tyrosine phosphorylation of PP2Ac and thereby increases PP2A activity to mediate endothelial barrier dysfunction.

Exposure of mouse skeletal muscle microvascular endothelial cell monolayers to a proinflammatory stimulus [lipopolysaccharide (LPS) + interferon (IFN)gamma] increased permeability to albumin, and this barrier dysfunction was attenuated by PP2A inhibitor okadaic acid or by siRNA against PP2Ac. LPS+IFNgamma increased synthesis of peroxynitrite precursors nitric oxide (NO) and superoxide by inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and NADPH oxidase, respectively. PP2Ac immunoprecipitates isolated from LPS+IFNgamma- or peroxynitrite-treated cells showed increased tyrosine nitration, decreased tyrosine phosphorylation and increased phosphatase activity. 3-Nitrotyrosine immunoprecipitates from LPS+IFNgamma-stimulated cells also exhibited increased PP2A activity. Further, iNOS inhibitor 1400W, iNOS deficiency, NADPH oxidase inhibitor apocynin, or p47phox deficiency prevented the increase in PP2A activity and preserved barrier function.

Conclusion
###end title 5
###begin p 6
LPS+IFNgamma stimulates endothelial cells to produce iNOS-derived NO and NADPH oxidase-derived superoxide, which form peroxynitrite that nitrates tyrosine residues in PP2Ac and inhibits their phosphorylation. This nitration in PP2Ac is correlated with PP2A activation that mediates endothelial barrier dysfunction.

Proinflammatory stimuli [e.g., lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and the cytokines tumor necrosis factor (TNF)alpha, interleukin (IL)-1beta and interferon (IFN)gamma] trigger tissue injury in inflammatory diseases such as sepsis and rheumatoid arthritis. 1,2 These stimuli induce endothelial barrier dysfunction that permits extravasation of plasma and leukocytes and consequently leads to edema and tissue injury.3,4 In support of this view, proinflammatory cytokines have been shown to increase endothelial cell monolayer permeability in the absence of leukocytes, through direct actions on endothelial cells.4-7 Moreover, the cytokines induce a delayed permeability increase that develops over hours to days in endothelial monolayers.4-7 However, the mechanisms causing the permeability increase are not clear.

Endothelial cells respond to proinflammatory stimuli by producing nitric oxide (NO), superoxide and peroxynitrite.2,8 NO generation by endothelial cells is necessary for the maintenance of endothelial barrier function.2,9,10 However, the protective effect of NO is diminished under inflammatory conditions due to the simultaneous production of superoxide, which reacts with NO to form peroxynitrite.11,12 Peroxynitrite has been implicated as a causative factor for endothelial barrier dysfunction that is not attributable to cell death.13,14 Inhibition of the production of superoxide or NO with, respectively, superoxide dismutase or NO synthase inhibitors, preserves the permeability barrier in endothelial cell monolayers challenged with LPS and cytokines.10,15

Peroxynitrite oxidizes cysteine residues and nitrates tyrosine residues, leading to modification of the functional activity of target proteins.11,12 This modification could lead to endothelial barrier disruption. For example, nitration by endogenous peroxynitrite of the cytoskeletal protein actin may account for TNFalpha-induced permeability increase in endothelial cell monolayers.16 Other peroxynitrite-mediated mechanisms also may be involved in this permeability increase, since the increase in permeability persists after nitrated actin returns to the control level.16

Protein phosphatase type 2A (PP2A) mediates dephosphorylation and redistribution of tight junction proteins that can cause paracellular leak in epithelial cell monolayers.17,18 Inhibition of PP2A with calyculin A prevents the redistribution of tight junction proteins and the increase in epithelial permeability caused by enteropathogenic E. coli infection.19 PP2A activity can be modulated by the tyrosine phosphorylation state of its catalytic subunit (PP2Ac), because phosphorylation of tyrosine residues in PP2Ac decreases phosphatase activity.20-22 We hypothesized that microvascular endothelial cells exposed to proinflammatory stimulation produce peroxynitrite that nitrates PP2Ac and this nitration inhibits tyrosine phosphorylation of PP2Ac and thereby augments PP2A activity to mediate endothelial barrier dysfunction.

Diffusion of Evans blue-coupled albumin through endothelial monolayers was determined as previously described with minor modifications.25 Cells were plated on gelatin-coated culture inserts (3 mum pore size) in 12-well plates (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA, USA) and grown to confluence in the growth medium. The cells were treated in phenol red-free DMEM containing 2% serum, as described in the figure legends. Subsequently, Evans blue-coupled albumin was added to the upper chamber and uncoupled albumin was added to the lower chamber, so that no oncotic pressure gradient existed. After incubation of the monolayers with Evans blue-coupled albumin for 1 h, medium was collected from the lower chamber and the absorbance of Evans blue was measured at 595 nm. Absorbance values were referenced to a standard curve and the flux of albumin was expressed as mug/h.

Mouse skeletal muscle microvascular endothelial cell monolayers leaked a low level of Evans blue-labeled albumin under basal conditions (Fig. 1A). Stimulation of the cell monolayers with LPS (25 ng/ml) + IFNgamma (100 U/ml) markedly increased the permeability to albumin (Fig. 1A). This permeability increase was attenuated by okadaic acid at concentrations of 0.1 and 1.0 nM (Fig. 1A). Okadaic acid is a selective PP2A inhibitor with IC50 values of 0.1-2 nM.28,29 Treatment of the cells with LPS+IFNgamma or okadaic acid at concentrations of 0.1 and 1.0 nM did not influence cell viability (Fig. 1B).

Microvascular endothelial cells that were transfected with scrambled siRNA for control expressed constitutively the catalytic subunit of PP2A (PP2Ac) at levels that were not changed by LPS+IFNgamma (Fig. 2A and 2B). Despite robust expression of PP2Ac protein, cells that were not incubated with LPS+IFNgamma showed a low level of PP2A activity (Fig. 2C). LPS+IFNgamma markedly increased PP2A activity (Fig. 2C). Further, the increased PP2A activity was accompanied by augmented monolayer permeability (Fig. 2C and D). Transfection of the cells with siRNA against PP2Ac remarkably decreased the expression of PP2Ac protein in both unstimulated and LPS+IFNgamma-stimulated endothelial cells (Fig. 2A and 2B). PP2Ac siRNA did not affect PP2A activity or monolayer permeability in unstimulated cells, but it prevented increases in these parameters by LPS+IFNgamma (Fig. 2C and D). Together, these results indicate that the elevated PP2A activity mediates the permeability increase in LPS+IFNgamma-stimulated endothelial cell monolayers.

Microvascular endothelial cells under basal conditions produced superoxide at a rate that was partially inhibited by the NADPH oxidase inhibitor apocynin (Fig. 3A). NADPH oxidase deficiency (i.e., knockout of the enzyme subunit, p47phox) did not change the basal level of superoxide production (Fig. 3A). Stimulation of the cells with LPS+IFNgamma markedly increased superoxide production (Fig. 3A). This increase was attenuated by apocynin or NADPH oxidase deficiency (Fig. 3A). On the other hand, unstimulated endothelial cells with or without iNOS gene knockout produced very low levels of NO metabolites (nitrite and nitrate) (Fig. 3B). Stimulation of the cells with LPS+IFNgamma remarkably increased the levels of NO metabolites and this increase was completely inhibited by iNOS inhibitor 1400W or iNOS deficiency (Fig. 3B). These observations indicate that NADPH oxidase and iNOS are the principal sources of superoxide and NO, respectively, in LPS+IFNgamma-stimulated endothelial cells.

Superoxide and NO react to form peroxynitrite. This reactive nitrogen species nitrates the tyrosine residues of target proteins, leading to formation of 3-nitrotyrosine. We investigated if PP2Ac is a target of endogenous peroxynitrite in LPS+INFgamma-stimulated endothelial cells. PP2Ac isolated from LPS+INFgamma-stimulated wild type endothelial cells, but not vehicle-treated wild type endothelial cells, contained 3-nitrotyrosine (Fig. 4A and B). Further, 3-nitrotyrosine was undetectable in PP2Ac from LPS+IFNgamma-stimulated endothelial cells that were deficient in p47phox or iNOS (Fig. 4A and B). We then investigated if PP2Ac tyrosine nitration by endogenous peroxynitrite inhibits the tyrosine phosphorylation. Phospho-tyrosine was detectable in PP2Ac isolated from endothelial cells. Incubation of wild-type cells with LPS+IFNgamma diminished tyrosine phosphorylation levels in PP2Ac (Fig. 4A and C). However, tyrosine phosphorylation in PP2Ac was not altered by LPS+IFNgamma if the cells were deficient in p47phox or iNOS (Fig. 4A and C). Notably, only the immunoprecipitates of PP2Ac that contained 3-nitrotyrosine exhibited an increased phosphatase activity (Fig. 4D). Moreover, 3-nitrotyrosine immunoprecipitates isolated from LPS+INFgamma-stimulated endothelial cells also showed a moderately increased PP2A activity (Fig. 4D). These results indicate that nitration inhibits tyrosine phosphorylation in PP2Ac and is associated with PP2A activation.

To test further if peroxynitrite alters PP2A activity, we performed additional experiments in which authentic peroxynitrite was added directly to microvascular endothelial cell cultures. Controls were treated with vehicle or degraded peroxynitrite. The results showed that PP2Ac isolated from peroxynitrite-treated endothelial cells, but not from vehicle- or degraded peroxynitrite-treated cells, contained 3-nitrotyrosine (Fig. 5A and B). In contrast, phosphotyrosine was detectable in PP2Ac from vehicle- or degraded peroxynitrite-treated cells but not peroxynitrite-treated cells (Fig. 5A and C). Furthermore, treatment of cells with peroxynitrite, but not with degraded peroxynitrite, increased PP2A activity and endothelial monolayer permeability (Fig. 5D and E). These results indicate that peroxynitrite-dependent tyrosine nitration and inhibition of tyrosine phosphorylation in PP2Ac are associated with increases in PP2A activity and endothelial monolayer leak.

Finally, we investigated the roles of endogenous superoxide and NO in PP2A activity and barrier function in cell monolayers. Our results showed that stimulation of the cells with LPS+IFNgamma markedly increased PP2A activity and the monolayer permeability to albumin (Fig. 6A and B). The increase in PP2A activity induced by LPS+IFNgamma was inhibited partially, but significantly, by apocynin or 1400W (Fig. 6A). Whereas an effect of LPS+IFNgamma on PP2A activity was still detectable in cells pretreated with apocynin or 1400W, the effect was abolished by p47phox deficiency or iNOS deficiency (Fig. 6A). Moreover, the increase in endothelial monolayer permeability induced by LPS+IFNgamma was blocked by apocynin, 1400W, p47phox deficiency or iNOS deficiency (Fig. 6B). Apocynin, p47phox deficiency, 1400W or iNOS deficiency did not affect cell survival since similar cell viabilities were observed after these treatments (Fig. 6C). These results indicate that inhibition of either NADPH oxidase or iNOS can attenuate LPS+IFNgamma-induced increases in PP2A activity and endothelial monolayer leak.

Proinflammatory stimuli induce barrier dysfunction in endothelial and epithelial cell monolayers through disruption of intercellular tight junctions.4,6,30 The present study discovered that this effect is likely mediated through activation of PP2A. Further, PP2A activation is associated with peroxynitrite-dependent tyrosine nitration and inhibition of tyrosine phosphorylation in PP2Ac.

LPS+IFNgamma is a potent inducer of iNOS and NADPH oxidase in various cell types.23,27,31 Consistently, our results show that LPS+IFNgamma stimulates the synthesis of NO and superoxide by iNOS and NADPH oxidase, respectively, in microvascular endothelial cells. iNOS-derived NO and NADPH oxidase-derived superoxide react to form peroxynitrite. This reactive nitrogen species could cause massive oxidation and potential destruction of cellular proteins, leading to the induction of cell death through both apoptosis and necrosis.11,12 However, our results further show that LPS+IFNgamma-induced permeability increase is not caused by cell death, because similar levels of cell viability are observed in control and LPS+IFNgamma-stimulated endothelial cells. Similarly, other studies reported that cell death is not the cause of permeability increase in endothelial and epithelial cell monolayers after exposure to cytokines.7,30 Moreover, exogenous peroxynitrite that induces endothelial barrier dysfunction does not cause cell death.13

We observed that unstimulated endothelial cells express large amounts of PP2Ac protein. However, they have relatively low levels of PP2A activity and monolayer permeability to albumin. Transfection with PP2Ac siRNA decreases PP2Ac protein expression but does not affect PP2A activity in unstimulated endothelial cells. The explanation for this may be that most PP2Ac in unstimulated endothelial cells is inactive because of high levels of tyrosine phosphorylation in this catalytic subunit. In support of this explanation, we observed that incubating the cells with LPS+IFNgamma did not change PP2Ac protein expression but increased PP2A activity and decreased PP2Ac tyrosine phosphorylation. Inhibition of PP2A activity with okadaic acid or inhibition of PP2Ac expression with siRNA against PP2Ac attenuates LPS+IFNgamma-induced increases in PP2A activity and monolayer permeability to albumin. These results establish that LPS+IFNgamma-induced increase in PP2A activity mediates barrier dysfunction in endothelial cell monolayers. The mechanism of action for PP2A to induce barrier dysfunction has been studied extensively in epithelial cells. PP2A is associated with the junction proteins ZO-1 and occludin and can directly modulate the phosphorylation state of these junction proteins.17,18,32,33 PP2A activity causes dephosphorylation and redistribution of the tight junction proteins, leading to epithelial barrier dysfunction.17,18

Our results show that PP2A activity is increased by LPS+IFNgamma and this increase is not due to increased expression of PP2Ac protein. Previous studies found that PP2A activity and function can be regulated by posttranslational modifications of the catalytic subunit (i.e., cysteine oxidation, tyrosine phosphorylation, or leucine methylation of PP2Ac).34,35 Peroxynitrite formed in the LPS+IFNgamma-stimulated endothelial cells may oxidize the cysteine residues and nitrate the tyrosine residues in PP2Ac, leading to modulation of PP2A activity.11,12 In preliminary studies we found that the thiol-specific reagent dithiothreitol increases further the PP2A activity in PP2Ac immunoprecipitates isolated from LPS+IFNgamma-stimulated cells (data not shown), suggesting that oxidation by endogenous peroxynitrite of the cysteine residues in PP2Ac inhibits the enzyme activity. Other studies also show that oxidants such as hydrogen peroxide inhibit the phosphatase activity of PP2A in cells or cell lysates.36,37 Therefore, oxidation of the cysteine residues in PP2Ac is unlikely to be the mechanism by which LPS+IFNgamma increases PP2A activity.

Tyrosine phosphorylation of PP2Ac is another important mechanism for regulation of PP2A activity. PP2Ac can undergo tyrosine phosphorylation mediated by p60v-src, p56lck, epithelial growth factor receptors, and insulin receptors.20-22 The phosphorylation results in inactivation of the enzyme.21-22 Peroxynitrite nitrates tyrosine residues in proteins, leading to formation of 3-nitrotyrosine.11,12 This tyrosine nitration could inhibit tyrosine phosphorylation. It has been reported that nitration by authentic peroxynitrite of tyrosine residues in a cdc2(6-20)NH2 peptide inhibits completely phosphorylation of the tyrosine residues by p56lck tyrosine kinase.38 Moreover, studies in intact cells have shown that nitration by exogenous peroxynitrite of tyrosine residues in proteins inhibits their phosphorylation. For example, incubation of lymphocytes with authentic peroxynitrite causes protein tyrosine nitration and inhibits the tyrosine phosphorylation induced by anti-CD3 antibodies.39 Our data demonstrate that PP2Ac immunoprecipitates, prepared from LPS+IFNgamma- or authentic peroxynitrite-treated endothelial cells, show 3-nitrotyrosine formation, decreased tyrosine phosphorylation and increased PP2A activity. These changes in 3-nitrotyrosine, tyrosine phosphorylation and PP2A activity are not detectable in PP2Ac from iNOS deficient or NADPH oxidase deficient endothelial cells exposed to LPS+IFNgamma. We infer that either endogenous peroxynitrite induced by LPS+IFNgamma or authentic peroxynitrite can nitrate the tyrosine residues in PP2Ac and thereby inhibit tyrosine phosphorylation. Functionally this inhibition is associated with increased PP2A activity.

Our results indicate that iNOS inhibitor 1400W, iNOS deficiency, NADPH oxidase inhibitor apocynin, or p47phox deficiency prevents the increase in PP2A activity and preserves the permeability barrier in endothelial monolayers challenged with LPS+IFNgamma. Moreover, exposure of endothelial cells to authentic peroxynitrite leads to augmented PP2A activity and increased monolayer leak. These results suggest that PP2A is a target of peroxynitrite that increases PP2A activity to mediate endothelial monolayer leak. This effect of peroxynitrite likely depends on tyrosine nitration of PP2Ac to inhibit tyrosine phosphorylation and inactivate this catalytic subunit. The observation of a moderate increase in PP2A activity in 3-nitrotyrine immunoprecipitates isolated from LPS+IFNgamma-stimulated endothelial cells further supports an association between PP2Ac nitration and PP2A activity. While nitration by exogenous peroxynitrite of the cytoskeletal protein actin has been reported to contribute to peroxynitrite-induced permeability increase in porcine pulmonary artery endothelial monolayers,13 our results indicate that PP2Ac is another target of peroxynitrite that mediates microvascular endothelial leak.

Stimulation of cells by growth factors or serum promotes phosphorylation of tyrosine residues in PP2Ac, thereby inactivating PP2A.20-22 Similarly, PP2A inactivation may occur in endothelial cells under the serum-supplemented cell culture conditions employed in the present study and may contribute to the barrier integrity of cell monolayers. Peroxynitrite produced by the cells in response to proinflammatory stimulation (i.e., LPS+IFNgamma in the present study) nitrates the tyrosine residue in PP2Ac. This nitration prevents phosphorylation/inactivation of PP2A by the receptor tyrosine kinases of growth factors, such as epidermal growth factor and insulin, and consequently increases PP2A activity to mediate barrier dysfunction. It has been reported that enteropathogenic E. coli infection stimulates nitrative stress and serine/threonine phosphatase activity that mediates the increased permeability in epithelial monolayers.19,40 Further, it also has been reported that nitrative stress-induced epithelial barrier dysfunction can be prevented by treatment of cell monolayers with epithelial growth factor.41

Bacterial infection or tissue damage stimulates the innate immune response to produce proinflammatory cytokines such as IL-1beta, TNFalpha and IFNgamma. Stimulation by these cytokines causes progression of tissue injury in inflammatory diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis and sepsis.1,2 Vascular leak is an important pathological process of inflammatory diseases2,3 in which iNOS and peroxynitrite have been implicated11,12,42,43 The present study, for the first time, identifies peroxynitrite-dependent activation of PP2A as an important step in endothelial barrier dysfunction. This finding provides new pharmacological targets for therapy of inflammatory diseases.
