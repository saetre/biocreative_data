AP-2 is a developmentally-regulated transcription factor expressed in ectodermal cell lineages. The AP-2 protein is essential for neural tube, craniofacial and body wall morphogenesis and has been implicated in oncogenesis. Here we report the isolation of the AP-2 promoter from human, mouse and chicken. The initiation sites for the human gene have been mapped in a variety of cell lines, including several derived from breast tumours. Initiation occurs just upstream of an IR3-like repetitive element, present in the human and mouse genes, but absent in chicken. The cis-acting elements responsible for promoter activity in human HeLa cells have been mapped both in vivo and in vitro. The proximal promoter contains binding sites for transcription factors AP-2, NF-1 and octamer proteins, but lacks a TATA box motif. Functional analysis demonstrates that the octamer binding site is the critical component of basal promoter activity. In addition, the promoter relies on an initiator element for efficient start site utilization. There is an excellent correlation between the requirement for the initiator and octamer elements in transcription assays and the conservation of these cis-acting sequences between chicken, mouse and human.
