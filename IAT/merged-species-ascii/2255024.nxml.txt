In the Icelandic and Swedish populations, pseudoexfoliation syndrome (XFS) and pseudoexfoliation glaucoma (XFG) has been significantly associated with LOXL1 exon 1 polymorphisms - allele G of  (R141L) and allele G of  (G135D). In this study, we looked at the association of  and  in a southern Indian population.

Pseudoexfoliation syndrome (XFS) is an age-related, systemic, elastic microfibrillopathy affecting both intraocular and extraocular tissues [1]. In the eye, XFS is characterized by the presence of fibrogranular extracellular debris in the anterior segment, which is composed of a complex glycoprotein-proteoglycan structure having epitopes of a basement membrane, elastic fiber system, and components of elastic microfibrils [2]. The average worldwide prevalence of XFS is 10%-20% of the general population over the age of 60 years. However, studies have shown much higher prevalence in certain populations like Scandinavian countries and Greece [3-5].

Glaucoma, the second most common cause of blindness, is a heterogeneous group of disorders characterized by optic nerve damage [6]. XFS is the most common identifiable cause of secondary glaucoma such as pseudoexfoliation glaucoma (XFG), which is due to the accumulation of the exfoliative material [7]. The risk of XFS converting to XFG over a period of 15 years is about 60% [8,9].

Linkage studies on a large Finnish family showing an autosomal dominant mode of inheritance for XFS trait identified a locus, 18q12.1-21.33, with a two point LOD score of 3.45 and a multipoint LOD score of 4.2 and few other loci like 2q, 17p, and 19q previously linked to primary open angle glaucoma [2]. Familial aggregation and the increased frequency of XFS and glaucoma in relatives of affected subjects compared with relatives of unaffected subjects clearly suggests an underlying genetic component [10,11].

The three SNPs are, allele T of  in the first intron and allele G of  (R141L) and allele G of  (G135D) in exon 1 LOXL1. The association was further confirmed in a Swedish population, and the combined p values of the SNPs were 1.0x10-27 (), 2.3x10-12 () and 3.0x10-21 () [9]. LOXL1 gene expression is detected in ocular tissues, and it is a member of the lysyl oxidase family of proteins [12]. This protein is involved in catalyzing the deamination of lysine residues of tropoelastin, causing cross-linking and the formation of elastin polymer fibers [13,14]. The pathological process of XFS is characterized by chronic accumulation of abnormal fibrillar material in the anterior segment of the eye, leading to numerous clinical complications apart from secondary glaucoma [7]. Though the precise role of LOXL1 in the XFS is not known, it could possibly contribute to the pathogenesis due to the accumulation of abnormal elastin microfibrillar components.

Fifty-two cases of XFS with or without glaucoma or ocular hypertension and 97 matched healthy controls were taken for the study. Cases and controls were matched for age, gender, and ethnicity. Subjects and controls were recruited from the glaucoma clinic at the hospital and also from a population-based survey that was being conducted at the Sankara Nethralaya Eye Hospital in Chennai, India after the approval of the local research ethics committee. All subjects and controls underwent a comprehensive ocular examination including vision and refraction, slit lamp assessment, applanation tonometry, gonioscopy, and dilated stereobiomicroscopic optic disc and retinal examination. Presence of pseudoexfoliation was diagnosed if the pseudoexfoliative material was detected on the pupillary ruff or anterior lens capsule.

Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS# version 14.0. Those with pseudoexfoliation (irrespective of the presence or absence of glaucoma or ocular hypertension) were compared to the control population. Pearson's Chi2 test (adjusted by Yates correction where necessary) was used to compare patient and control groups for possible associations between SNP allele frequency/haplotype frequency and disease state. Bonferroni correction for multiple tests was applied and a p value of less than 0.00625 was considered significant. Odds ratios were also calculated. Linkage disequilibrium analysis and checking of conformance of Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium were done using the HAPLOVIEW program (version 4.0). It calculates several pair-wise measures of linkage disequilibrium (LD). Individual haplotypes and their estimated population frequencies were inferred using the HAPLOVIEW program with all parameters set at the default values. The genotype data were loaded as unphased diplotypes in a standard linkage format. Marker information including the name and physical location was loaded separately.

Genetic and environmental factors have been implicated in the pathogenesis of XFS. In a recent breakthrough genome-wide association study done in an Icelandic population, which was replicated in a Swedish population, the genetic etiology of XFS and its associated glaucoma was unraveled. Polymorphisms in the coding region of the LOXL1 gene located on chromosome 15q24.1 are strongly associated with XFS and XFG in these populations [9]. The Thorleifsson et al. [9] study have shown a strong association of XFS and XFG with two known non-synonymous SNPs,  (Arg-->Leu, R141L) and  (Gly-->Leu, G135D), of the LOXL1 gene.

When compared to the Icelandic study, we did not find significant association with , but we replicated the significant association of allele G of SNP,  (p=0.0001, OR=4.17, CI - 1.89-9.18). It is interesting that Thorleifsson et al. [9] demonstrated that the expression of LOXL1 was reduced by an estimated 7.7% with each copy carrying the risk G allele of . The lack of association seen for the G allele of  in the present study may be attributed to the fact that the sample size was small. Similar to the Icelandic study, only three of the four possible haplotypes were detected in our samples. Among the three observed haplotypes, (G,G) was strongly associated with XFS (OR of 3.001, CI - 1.83, 4.91, p=9.9 x 10-6).

The LOXL1 gene is a member of the lysyl oxidase gene family. The prototypic member of the family is essential for the biogenesis of connective tissue and encodes for an extracellular copper-dependent amine oxidase that catalyzes the first step in the formation of cross-links in collagens and elastin [15]. Lysyl oxidases (LOX) and lysyl oxidase-like-proteins form an enzyme family with diverse NH2-termini and conserved COOH-terminal lysyl oxidase (LOX) domains. A highly conserved amino acid sequence at the COOH-terminus end appears to be sufficient for amine-oxidase activity, indicating that each member of the protein family may have this particular function [16].

In addition to LOX and LOXL1, three closely related LOX-like proteins were identified in mammals in the past decade, LOXL2, LOXL3, and LOXL4 [16]. Although the LOX family members share some homology, each of the genes are located on different chromosomes; LOX is located on chromosome 5q23.1, LOXL1 on chromosome 15q24.1, LOXL2 on chromosome 8p21.3, LOXL3 on chromosome 2p13.1, and LOXL4 on chromosome 10q24.2 as per the human genome data at .

In the case of age-related macular degeneration (AMD), the identification and validation of the association between the CFH gene variants and AMD [17] made many investigators look at other genes in the complement factor H related family (CFHR) genes like complement factor B (BF) and complement component 2 (C2) [18]. Further work revealed the strong association of CFHR genes with AMD. Similarly, it would be worth hypothesizing that other LOX family member genes (LOX, LOXL2, LOXL3, and LOXL4) could be strong candidates whose variants might be associated with XFS and/or XFG. The prevalence of pseudoexfoliation syndrome in India has been reported to be between 3% and 6% in those aged 40 years and above [19-21]. XFS is strongly associated with not only cataract and complications of cataract surgery but also open angle glaucoma, and it shows an increasing prevalence with age [22]. Pseudoexfoliation was associated with a significantly greater risk of blindness secondary to these causes. Hence, this finding gains importance and has public health implications for India.

In summary, our results showed that of the two non-synonymous SNPs in exon 1 of the LOXL1 gene that were shown to be significantly associated with XFS,  (G135D) conferred a significant risk to develop the disease in the Indian population. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study showing an association of LOXL1 gene polymorphism and XFS in the Asian population.
