The nucleotide sequence of a cDNA clone isolated from developing wheat embryos and encoding the Em protein is reported. The entire coding region for Em and the 3' non-translated flank are contained within this clone. The amino acid sequence deduced for Em is very rich in glycine (18 mol%) as well as both basic and acidic residues. The molecular weight of the protein is ca. 9,900 daltons. The deduced sequence is supported by direct amino acid sequencing of cyanogen bromide cleavage fragments obtained from purified Em protein. Em is shown by Southern blots to be a product of a gene family of approximately ten members.
