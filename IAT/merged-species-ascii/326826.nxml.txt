Deletions of polyoma virus DNA around the region that codes for the C-terminus of the viral middle T-antigen were created using a transforming fragment (BamH I/EcoR I) of viral DNA cloned in the plasmid vector pAT153. These species were recloned and assayed for their ability to transform Rat-1 cells in culture. Our results showed that whereas the DNA sequence between the presumed translational termination codon for the viral middle T-antigen and the single viral EcoR I site could be removed with no apparent effect on transformation, the removal of the termination codon itself or any amino acid coding sequences of this protein caused a drastic decrease in the transforming ability of the DNA. Transfection of Rat-1 cells with plasmids that contained viral DNA with deletions which corresponded to the last fourteen or more amino acids of the middle T-antigen never gave rise to cellular transformation.
