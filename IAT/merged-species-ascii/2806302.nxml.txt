Lewis y antigen is difucosylated oligosaccharide and is carried by glycoconjugates at cell surface. Elevated expression of Lewis y has been found in 75% of ovarian tumor, and the high expression level is correlated to the tumor's pathological staging and prognosis. This study was to investigate the effect and the possible mechanism of Lewis y on the proliferation of human ovarian cancer cells.

###begin p 4
We constructed a plasmid encoding alpha1,2-fucosyltransferase (alpha1,2-FT) gene and then transfected it into ovarian carcinoma-derived RMG-I cells with lowest Lewis y antigen expression level. Effect of Lewis y on cell proliferation was assessed after transfection. Changes in cell survival and signal transduction were evaluated after alpha-L-fucosidase, anti-Lewis y antibody and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) inhibitor treatment.

###begin p 6
Our results showed that the levels of alpha1,2-FT gene and Lewis y increased significantly after transfection. The cell proliferation of ovarian carcinoma-derived RMG-I cells sped up as the Lewis y antigen was increased. Both of alpha-L-fucosidase and anti-Lewis y antibody inhibited the cell proliferation. The phosphorylation level of Akt was apparently elevated in Lewis y-overexpressing cells and the inhibitor of PI3K, LY294002, dramatically inhibited the growth of Lewis y-overexpressing cells. In addition, the phosphorylation intensity and difference in phosphorylation intensity between cells with different expression of alpha1,2-FT were attenuated significantly by the monoantibody to Lewis y and by the PI3K inhibitor LY294002.

Increased expression of Lewis y antigen plays an important role in promoting cell proliferation through activating PI3K/Akt signaling pathway in ovarian carcinoma-derived RMG-I cells. Inhibition of Lewis y expression may provide a new therapeutic approach for Lewis y positive ovarian cancer.

Lewis y antigen is carried by glycoconjugates (glycoproteins and glycolipids) at cell surface. It is an oligosaccharide with two fucoses, and its chemical structure is Fucalpha1 --> 2Galbeta1 --> 4 [Fucalpha1 --> 3]GlcNAcbeta1 --> R, belonging to the A, B, H, Lewis blood group antigens family with specific fucosylation of the terminal end of carbohydrate structure catalyzed by the alpha1,2-fucosyltransferase [1,2]. The expression of Lewis y antigen primarily occurs during the embryogenesis period. Under physiologic conditions, its expression in adults is limited on the surface of granulocytes and epithelium [3]. However, elevated expression of Lewis y has been found in 70-90% of the human carcinomas of epithelial cell origin, including breast, ovary, prostate, colon cancers, and the high expression level is correlated to the tumor's pathological staging and prognosis [4-6]. It has been reported that the Lewis y antigen was expressed on a number of different molecular carriers, including 2 major ovarian cancer antigens (CA125 and MUC-1), suggesting the high incidence of Lewis y in ovarian cancer [7].

We have established the stable ovarian cancer cell line with high expression of Lewis y, RMG-I-H, through gene transfection technique to introduce the gene of human alpha1,2-fucosyltransferase (alpha1,2-FT) into the ovarian cancer cell line RMG-I in our previous works. We found that the RMG-I-H cells become highly tolerant to the anti-tumor drugs, 5-fluorouracil, carboplatin [8,9]. It suggested that the Lewis y antigen possessed the function of boosting the survival ability of ovarian cancer cells.

Activation of the PI3K pathway supports survival and proliferation of multiple cell lineages [10]. PI3K activation results in the localized increase of phosphorylated lipid second messengers at the plasma membrane. Key signaling intermediates are then recruited to the phosphorylated lipids via specialized lipid-binding domains, pleckstrin homology (PH) domains, and are themselves activated to initiate further signaling events [11,12]. One key effector molecule that is activated in this manner is the serine/threonine kinase Akt, which, when localized to products of PI3K activation, is able to phosphorylate multiple downstream substrates that mediate cell growth, survival, and metabolism [13-15]. Studies found that soluble Lewis y antigen (4A11) or its glucose analog, H-2 g, effect angiogenesis by inducing VEGF expression and signaling through PI3K pathway in the angiogenesis-rich rheumatoid arthritis [16].

Here we report that the cell proliferation of ovarian cancer cell line RMG-I sped up as the Lewis y antigen was increased. The phosphorylation level of Akt was apparently elevated in Lewis y-overexpressing cells. The inhibitor of PI3K, LY294002, dramatically inhibited the growth of Lewis y-overexpressing cells. Taken together, Lewis y antigen stimulates the growth of ovarian cancer cells through activating PI3K/Akt signal-transduction pathway. Potential treatment strategies through the inhibition of PI3K signaling pathway to target Lewis y signals may provide a useful approach for therapy of ovarian tumor growth.

The human alpha1,2-fucosyltransferase gene (FUT-1) was amplified by PCR with human leukocyte genomic DNA as a template and primers according to the human FUT-1 gene sequence (GenBank Accession Number: ), sense primer, 5'-CATGTGGCTCCGGAGCCATCGTC-3', and antisense primer, 5'-GCTCTCAAGGCTTAGCCAATGTCC-3', under the following conditions: denaturation at 94degreesC for 9 min, followed by 25 cycles of 94degreesC, 1 min, 65degreesC, 1.5 min, and 72degreesC, 2 min, and then extension at 72degreesC for 10 min. The PCR products were ligated into the pCR2.1 vector to clone FUT-1 gene, and its DNA sequence was determined by means of the dideoxynucleotide chain-termination method with the BigDye terminator cycle sequenceing ready reaction kit and a DNA sequencer (ABI Genetic Analyzer; Perkin-Elmer/Applied Biosystems). Then the FUT-1 gene in pCR2.1 was cut out by digestion with restriction enzymes, BamHI and EcoRI, and ligated into the BamHI and EcoRI sites of the pcDNA3.1 vector (pcDNA3.1-hFUT). pcDNA3.1-hFUT and the vector alone were transfected into RMG-I cells with a vector transfection kit, according to the instructions for the kit to establish RMG-I-H and RMG-I-pcDNA3.1 cells, respectively. The resultant transfectants were initially selected by cultivation with medium containing an aminoglycoside antibiotic, G418, at 400 mug/ml concentration, and were maintained at 200 mug/ml for 15 days.

The expressions of alpha1,2-FT mRNA in the pre- and post-transfection cell lines were measured by RT-PCR. Results showed that its expression of the post-transfection cell line RMG-I-H was significantly higher than those of RMG-I and RMG-I-pcDNA3.1 (Fig. 1A). Relative density analysis of alpha1,2-FT mRNA expression vs. their internal control beta-actin expression indicated alpha1,2-FT mRNA expression in RMG-I-H was increased 2.07-fold with RMG-I and 2.23-fold with RMG-I-pcDNA3.1 (p < 0.01) (Fig. 1B). Furthermore, immunocytochemical staining revealed that the expression of Lewis y, the product of alpha1,2-FT, was also increased in RMG-I-H cells than that in RMG-I and RMG-I-pcDNA3.1 cells. The expression of Lewis y was mainly located on the cell surface (Fig. 1C).

Lewis y overexpression significantly increased cell proliferation in culture as examined by MTT assay (Fig. 2). The proliferation rate of the post-transfection cells, RMG-I-H, was much higher than the non-transfected group and the group of transfected vector alone (p < 0.05). Also, there was no significance difference between the RMG-I and RMG-I-pcDNA3.1 (p > 0.05).

Immunocytochemical staining technique was used to observe the expression of Lewis y in the cell lines before and after the process by alpha-L-fucosidase. As shown in Fig. 1C, the cytoplasm and cell membrane of RMG-I-H-A and RMG-I-A were without stains after the process by alpha-L-fucosidase, whereas, the cytoplasm and cell membrane of RMG-I-H did appear to have evenly distributed brownish yellow granules, while the RMG-I was very lightly stained.

The proliferation of the cells before and after the process by alpha-L-fucosidase was examined by MTT assay, as shown in Fig. 3A, the cell growth rates of the experimental group, RMG-I-H-A and RMG-I-A, were much lower than the control group, RMG-I-H and RMG-I, after the process by alpha-L-fucosidase (p < 0.01). There was no significant difference between RMG-I-H-A and RMG-I-A (p > 0.05), while the proliferation rate of RMG-I was still lower than that of RMG-I-H (p < 0.05). Colony formation test showed that the cells, after processed by alpha-L-fucosidase, were mostly single, the number of colony formation was much less and the size of colony was also smaller. The colony formation rates of RMG-I-H-A and RMG-I-A cells were 11% and 13%, respectively. While, the colony formation rates of RMG-I-H and RMG-I were 47% and 34%, respectively, which were significantly higher than those of the experimental group (p < 0.01) (Fig. 3B).

In order to investigate the mechanism of Lewis y-enhanced cell growth, we use the inhibitor of PI3K, LY294002, to treat the non- and alpha1,2-FT transfected cells, then the cell proliferation was observed. Results in Fig. 5 showed that when RMG-I-H cells were incubated with LY294002 at a concentration of 3.125, 6.25, 12.5, 25 and 50 muM for 48 h, respectively, the cell proliferation was inhibited, especially at the concentration of 25 and 50 muM, the number of proliferated cells was decreased significantly, the concentrations of LY294002 giving the half survival rates (IC50) were 23.18 +/- 1.41 muM for RMG-I-H. In contrast, the proliferation of RMG-I cells was not significantly affected by treatment with various concentrations of LY294002.

In grow factor signaling, activation of Akt has been implicated as a key step. As shown in Fig. 6A, B, expression of Akt protein was not obviously altered in Lewis y-overexpressing cells, but the relative phosphorylation of Akt (calculated from the ratio of the staining intensity of phophorylated protein to unphosphorylated protein after normalization with beta-actin) was apparently upregulated to 5.37-fold of the non-transfection value in alpha1,2-FT transfected cells. Reults in Fig. 6A, B also show that when the two cell lines were treated by 20 mug/ml anti-Lewis y antibody or 25 muM LY294002 for 24 h (corresponding untreated cells were used as the control), phosphorylation of Akt was apparently decreased in non- and alpha1,2-FT transfected cells. By contrast, differences in phosphorylation intensity for Akt among non- and alpha1,2-FT transfected cell groups were attenuated in anti-Lewis y antibody- or LY294002-treated cells. When the cells were treated by anti-Lewis y antibody or LY294002, the rate of inhibition of phosphorylation was correlated with expression of Lewis y, which was Lewis y-highexpressing < Lewis y-lowexpressing cells.

Among the various post-translational modification reactions involving proteins, glycosylation is the most common, nearly 50% of all proteins are thought to be glycosylated [19]. Glycosylation reactions are catalyzed by the actions of glycosyltransferases, sugar chains being added to various complex carbohydrates [20]. An increasing body of evidence indicates that sugar chains in glycoproteins are involved in the regulation of cellular functions including cell-cell communication and signal transduction [21-23]. Research shows that 75% of ovarian cancers have varying degree of Lewis y overexpression, and increased expression is associated with poor prognosis of patients [24]. In our previous study, we introduced alpha1,2-FT gene into human ovarian cancer cell line RMG-I through gene transfection and established cell model overexpressing alpha1,2-FT gene and Lewis y [8]. Here by comparing cell proliferation status before and after transfection, we found that cell proliferation after gene transfection was accelerated. To further test the role of Lewis y in ovarian cancer cell proliferation, we treat Lewis y-overexpressing RMG-I-H ovarian cancer cells with alpha-L-fucosidase for the first time, which reducing the content of fucosylated antigens on cell surface. Through observing biological behaviors of cell before and after alpha-L-fucosidase treatment, we found the cell proliferation rate in transfected group was significantly higher than that of alpha-L-fucosidase-treatment group. Our preliminary study proved that the lactose type I chain family of the original RMG-I cells was primarily glycolipid, and they were Lc4Cer, Lewis a, and Lewis b, whereas, H-1 instead had the absolute domination in the successfully transfected cells. For the glycolipids of the lactose type II chain family, such as Lewis x, Lewis y, IV3NeuAc-nLc4Cer and NeuAc-LeX, their concentrations were over 0.01 mug per milliliter of dry cells; however, the glycolipids shown in the transfected RMG-I-H cells were Lewis x and Lewis y. 42.6% of Lewis x in the RMG-I-H was converted into Lewis y, which was in much higher percentage than the 3.2% of the original RMG-I cells. Although type I chain family H-1 had the absolute domination in the transfected RMG-I-H cells, its actual content was only 1/4 of the Lewis y [8]. These further proved that the changes of biological behaviors of RMG-I-H cells, such as enhancement of proliferation and growth, as well as the worsening in the severity of malignancy, all had to do with the increase in Lewis y antigen. Blocking experiments with Lewis y specific monoclonal antibody provided further evidence for its function.

The molecular mechanism by which Lewis y antigen causes the malignancy of ovarian cancer cell have not been completely understood. In previous studies, we tested the differences in oncogene expression before and after alpha1,2-FT gene transfection using gene chips technology. Results showed that: there were 88 differentially expressed genes after cell transfection, and altered genes mainly involved these genes regulating cell proliferation, signal transduction, transcription and so on [25]. Thus, it is possible that Lewis y may be an important component in signaling transduction pathway participating in signal transduction inside cell and further promoting proliferation of ovarian cancer cells. Studies found that anti-Lewis y antibodies (ABL364 and IGN311) blocked the activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway in A431 cells and prevented cell proliferation [26]. The MAPK signaling pathway has central roles in the regulation of cell survival and proliferation and our experimental results have further verified this conclusion. Our study found that the tyrosine phosphorylation level of MAPK after alpha1,2-FT gene transfection increased than that of before transfection in ovarian carcinoma-derived RMG-I cells (in press). In addition to MAPK pathway, the PI3K/Akt pathway is another critical pathway involved in cell survival and has been shown to be constitutivelsy active in ovarian cancer cell lines [27,28]. However, little is known about the relation of Lewis y and the PI3K/Akt pathway in the development and management of ovarian cancer. In an effort to understand the mechanism of action of Lewis y, we focused on investigating its effect on the PI3K/Akt pathway. In this study, we found the PI3K/Akt pathway was aberrantly activited by Lewis y antigen and PI3K/Akt pathway is necessary for Lewis y enhancing growth of RMG-I cells. It was verified by (1) increased tyrosine phosphorylation of Akt in alpha1,2-FT transfected cells. (2) blockage of cell surface Lewis y by anti-Lewis y antibody resulted in significant attenuation of the phosphorylation of Akt, as well as the difference in phosphorylation intensity among two cell lines. (3) in the presence of PI3K inhibitor LY294002, Lewis y no longer conferred a growth advantage in RMG-I-H cell. One of the crucial downstream targets of PI3K is the serine/threonine kinase Akt. Active Akt causes a variety of biological effects, including suppression of apoptosis by phosphorylation and inactivation of several targets along pro-apoptotic pathways. In particular, activated Akt is able to phosphorylate a variety of downstream substrates, e.g., Raf and I-K (a kinase that regulates the NF-kappaB transcription factor) [29]. A number of studies have demonstrated that the patients with increased p-Akt had a significant survival disadvantage compared to patients with lower Akt phosphorylation, and the patients with ovarian cancer suggested p-Akt overexpression as an independent prognostic indicator [30-32]. To our knowledge, this is the first report showing that overexpression of Lewis y antigen could significantly enhance proliferation of ovarian cancer cells through upregulating PI3K/Akt pathway.

Lewis y is mainly distributed at the plasma membrane of cancer cells [33], and carried by different glycolipids [34] and glycoproteins, such as CD44v6 [35], Muc6 [36] and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) [37], which are related to carcinogenesis. Studies showed that changes in glycosyltransferase expression might affect structure of carbohydrate chains on cell surface receptors and therefore impacted the expression and function of those glycoprotein receptors [38,39]. It has been reported that transfection of the sense cDNA of N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase(GnT)-V, an enzyme associated with cancer progression and metastasis, into human H7721 hepatocarcinoma cells resulted in an increase in the level of GlcNAcbeta1,6 Manalpha1,6-branch (GnT-V product) on the N-glycans of EGFR, this promoted the tyrosine autophosphorylation of EGFR [40]. From the above we speculate that there might be one possibility implicated in the mechanism that Lewis y antigen activates PI3K pathway. The over-expression of alpha1,2-FT cDNA results in the elevation of Lewis y content on some surface receptors, which might alter the comformation of the receptors, then promoting the signaling of the receptor and finally stimulating the proliferation of ovarian cancer cells. Our studies have found that the total amount of surface Lewis y as well as the Lewis y content on some surface receptors were all increased, and Lewis y expression on EGFR was very high on alpha1,2-FT-transfected cells (in press).

Cross-talk between the PI3K/Akt and the Raf/MEK/MAPK signaling pathways has been implied in human various malignant tumors, with some research stating that PI3K activity is essential for induction of Raf/MEK/MAPK activity [41,42]. Additional studies suggest that the PI3K/Akt pathway enhances and/or synergizes with Raf/MEK/MAPK signaling to provide a more robust survival signal [43]. We speculate whether such cross-talk between the two pathways also exists in Lewis y-overexpressing ovarian cancer cells, and whether Lewis y is the key point for triggering or regulating this cross-talk, the detailed mechanism requires further study.

The changes in glycosyltransferase expression might affect the sugar chain heterogeneity and distribution, which may mask some tumor antigens, reduce the immunogenicity of tumor cells, and promote tumor cells immune evasion. It has been confirmed that under normal circumstances, T lymphocytes do not recognize Lewis y antigen [44]. This allows the evasion of tumor cells from the recognition and killing by the human immune system, in order to easily enter the lymph nodes to form metastasis. Other studies found a novel function for soluble Lewis y, that is inducing cytokine release, such as interleukin-6 (IL-6), through the Janus kinase 2 (JAK2) pathway [45,16]. We speculate that except for proliferation, Lewis y could also induce tumor cells immune evasion through activating PI3K/Akt signaling pathway, the detailed mechanism is being studied. Lewis y may participate in natural humoral immune response, antibodies are ideally suited for eradicating pathogens from bloodstream and early tissue invasion. With regard to cancer cells, passively administered and vaccine induced antibodies have accomplished this concept, limiting tumor cells and systemic or intraperitoneal micrometastases in a variety of preclinical models. Many protocols developing anti-Lewis y vaccines have been performed [46,47].

In summary, we showed that increased expression of Lewis y antigen plays an important role in promoting cell proliferation through activating PI3K/Akt signaling pathway in ovarian carcinoma-derived RMG-I cells. Inhibition of Lewis y expression may provide a new therapeutic approach for Lewis y positive ovarian cancer.

Conclusions
###end title 70
###begin p 71
Lewis y overexpression promotes the proliferation of ovarian carcinoma-derived RMG-I cells and the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway is necessary for Lewis y-enhanced growth of RMG-I cells. These results may contribute for the development of a novel therapeutic methodology to treat Lewis y positive cancers.
