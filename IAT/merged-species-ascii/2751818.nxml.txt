Background
###end title 2
###begin p 3
In co-cultures of pachytene spermatocytes with Sertoli cells, beta-NGF regulates the second meiotic division by blocking secondary spermatocytes in metaphase (metaphase II), and thereby lowers round spermatid formation. In vertebrates, mature oocytes are arrested at metaphase II until fertilization, because of the presence of cytostatic factor (CSF) in their cytoplasm. By analogy, we hypothesized the presence of CSF in male germ cells.

We show here, that Mos, Emi2, cyclin E and Cdk2, the four proteins of CSF, and their respective mRNAs, are present in male rat meiotic cells; this was assessed by using Western blotting, immunocytochemistry and reverse transcriptase PCR. We measured the relative cellular levels of Mos, Emi2, Cyclin E and Cdk2 in the meiotic cells by flow cytometry and found that the four proteins increased throughout the first meiotic prophase, reaching their highest levels in middle to late pachytene spermatocytes, then decreased following the meiotic divisions. In co-cultures of pachytene spermatocytes with Sertoli cells, beta-NGF increased the number of metaphases II, while enhancing Mos and Emi2 levels in middle to late pachytene spermatocytes, pachytene spermatocytes in division and secondary spermatocytes.

Conclusion/Significance
###end title 6
###begin p 7
Our results suggest that CSF is not restricted to the oocyte. In addition, they reinforce the view that NGF, by enhancing Mos in late spermatocytes, is one of the intra-testicular factors which adjusts the number of round spermatids that can be supported by Sertoli cells.

Spermatogenesis is a complex process during which diploid spermatogonia divide mitotically to provide a population of spermatocytes that proceed through meiosis to haploid spermatids which differenciate into spermatozoa [1]. Multiplication, differentiation and survival or death of testicular germ cells are tightly regulated by both endocrine and local interactions: in addition to the regulation exerted by FSH and LH, spermatogenesis requires testicular factors originating from somatic and/or germ cells [1], [2]. This process occurs in seminiferous tubules, where germ cells are nursed by Sertoli cells [1], [2]. Each Sertoli cell is able to support a limited number of germ cells, in a species-specific manner [3]. We have previously shown that beta-Nerve growth factor (beta-NGF) participates in the regulation of spermatocyte differentiation by blocking secondary spermatocytes (SII) in metaphase (MPII) leading to a reduction of round spermatid (RS) formation in co-cultures of pachytene spermatocytes (PS) with Sertoli cells [4].

Masui and Market [5] postulated the presence of a specific factor in the cytoplasm of the oocyte blocked in MPII, and named this factor "cytostatic factor" (CSF). Sagata et al [6] proposed that the proto-oncogene Mos, a germ-cell-specific protein kinase uniquely induced at the beginning of oocyte maturation, was responsible for this CSF arrest in Xenopus eggs. Subsequently, the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway comprising the mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MEK) and extracellular signal-regulated kinases (Erk) 1/2 were identified as the downstream mediators of Mos [7]. Recently, it has been shown that one early mitotic inhibitor (Emi) protein, Emi2/Fbxo43 is required for both the establishment and maintenance of CSF arrest in Xenopus and mice eggs and that the Mos-MAPK pathway is directly linked to Emi2 for both CSF establishment and maintenance [8], [9]. An independent pathway involving Cdk2-Cyclin-E was also characterized through an antisense oligonucleotide approach [10], although these results have subsequently been challenged by the observation that injection of the Cdk2 inhibitor p21CIP does not interfere with CSF arrest [11]. Therefore, we hypothesized the presence of CSF in male germ cells, which could be, at least in part, responsible for the beta-NGF induced blockage of SII in MPII observed in co-cultures of PS with Sertoli cells. We have shown previously, that both ERK1 and ERK2 are detected in meiotic cells, from young PS to RS, present in co-culture of PS with Sertoli cells, as in freshly isolated germ cell populations. Moreover, their activated (phosphorylated) forms increased during meiotic progression, suggesting a role of MAPKs in this process [12]. However informations on the proteins constitutive of CSF and their role, if any, are scarce in the male.

In the first part of the present study we highlighted the presence of Mos, Emi2, cyclin E and Cdk2 proteins, and their respective mRNAs in freshly isolated male rat meiotic cells and determined the relative cellular levels in these proteins throughout the meiotic phase. In the second part, we addressed the effect of beta-NGF on Mos, Emi2, cyclin E and Cdk2 protein levels in cultured meiotic cells. It was found that beta-NGF increased Mos and Emi2 levels in middle to late pachytene spermatocytes, pachytene spermatocytes in division and secondary spermatocytes.

The mRNAs encoding Mos, Emi2, Cyclin E and Cdk2 were detected at the expected sizes by RT-PCR in freshly prepared total germ cells and elutriated PS and RS (Fig. 1). By measuring the mos or emi2 or cyclin E or cdk2 mRNA/18S RNA ratios it was found that the amount of mos mRNA was about two fold higher in RS than in PS, while emi2 mRNA and cyclin E mRNA amounts were roughly similar in PS and RS. The amount of cdk2 mRNA was a little higher in PS than in RS.

The specificity of the commercial anti-cyclin E, anti-Cdk2, anti-Mos and anti-Emi2 antibodies was tested by Western blotting (Fig. 2). The anti-Mos antibody detected two immunoreactive bands of protein in both the PS and RS fractions (Fig. 2A): (i) the 43 kDa band, which was previously described in the mouse and rat testes [13], [14] and (ii) the 39 kDa band which was shown in Xenopus, mouse and bovine oocytes [15]-[17]. Fig. 2B shows a western blot of Emi2 in elutriated PS and RS fractions. The 71 kDa band representing Emi2 in the mouse testis [9] was expressed in the two cell types. The 51 kDa band corresponding to Cyclin E [18] and low molecular weight derivatives [19] were observed in both PS and RS (Fig. 2C). The anti-Cdk2 antibody detected one band of protein at the expected size of about 34 kDa in PS and RS fractions (Fig. 2D). As expected staining of the corresponding nitrocellulose membrane with Ponceau Red S showed differences in blotted proteins between the two cell types but ascertained protein transfer. Since Western Blotting is a semi-quantitative method, the accurate cellular quantification by flow cytometry [12], [20], [21] of Mos, Emi2, Cyclin E and Cdk2 in meiotic cells was performed (see below).

Four populations of male rat meiotic cells (young PS, middle to late PS, SII and RS) were identified by cytometry [12]. The relative levels of Mos, Emi2, Cyclin E and Cdk2 were measured in these populations. For every protein, low levels were observed in young PS. These levels increased during the first meiotic prophase, reaching their highest levels in middle to late PS, then decreased following the meiotic divisions (Fig. 4).

We investigated next whether beta-NGF led to some changes in either Mos or Emi2 or Cyclin E or Cdk2 levels in meiotic cells. PS were co-cultured for three days with Sertoli cells either in the absence or presence of beta-NGF and the cellular contents in Mos, Emi2, Cyclin E and Cdk2 were measured in young PS, middle to late PS, PS in division, SII, SII in division and RS. Under basal conditions (no added beta-NGF), the relative levels of Mos, Emi2, Cyclin E and Cdk2 in these populations were rather similar to those measured in freshly prepared meiotic cells (compare Fig. 4 with Fig. 5B-5C for Mos and Emi2, and data not shown for Cyclin E and CDK2). Culture in the presence of beta-NGF enhanced the number of phosphohistone H3 labeled MPII from 1.24+/-0.12/mm to 1.71+/-0.13 (p<0.001 n = 7) as expected [4], but also the proportion of cells with high levels of Mos; this latter was much more marked in middle to late PS, PS in division, SII and SII in division than in the young PS and RS populations (Fig. 5A). In five different experiments beta-NGF treatment induced a significant increase of mean Mos levels in middle to late PS: 99+/-20 vs 75+/-15, (p<0.02), PS in division: 64+/-40 vs 43+/-29, (p<0.05) and SII: 48+/-12 vs 37+/-10, (p<0.05), but did not modify these levels in young PS and RS populations, and not significantly in SII in division (Fig. 5B). Emi2 levels were also increased in late meiotic cells by beta-NGF treatment (fig. 5C). On the contrary, beta-NGF modified neither Cyclin E nor Cdk2 levels in cultured meiotic cells (n = 3) (data not shown).

For Mos, Emi2, Cyclin E and Cdk2, both the proteins and their corresponding mRNAs were highlighted in freshly elutriated PS and RS. More importantly, we could quantify by flow cytometric analysis the relative cellular contents in these proteins at every stage of differentiation of meiotic cells, including SII which cannot be isolated by current methods but cytometry. As the cell contents in these proteins culminated just before the first meiotic division, a role of some of these proteins in meiotic divisions could be expected.

It should be emphasized that the Western blotting and the RT-PCR methods, as used in the present study to detect Mos, Emi2, Cyclin E and Cdk2 proteins and mRNAs, are qualitative, but only semi-quantitative, methods. Hence, no definite conclusion about their relative levels between the different samples can be made using these methods. This also holds true for a comparison between the relative levels observed by FACS analysis (on a per cell basis) and those obtained by Western blotting (on a protein-amount basis). Moreover the elutriated PS fraction, analysed by Western blot is a heterogenous population made of: early PS, middle PS and late PS/Diplotene Spermatocytes (see materials and methods section). On the contrary, flow cytometric analysis allowed an accurate measurement of the relative Mos, Emi2, Cyclin E and Cdk2 contents of the different types of meiotic cells (see materials and methods section).

In the case of Mos, our results are in general agreement with, and complete, previous studies. mos mRNA was first detected by Northen blot in mouse RS [22]-[24]. The fact that these authors found mos mRNA only in post meiotic cells is in line with our results showing a higher amount of mos mRNA in RS than in PS and to the less sensitivity of Northen blot compared to that of RT PCR. Subsequently, Mos mRNA and/or protein were found in rodent and frog PS and rodent RS [14], [25] and in rat late PS in culture [26]. However, in disagreement with our results, van der Hoorn et al.[14] saw the 43kD c-Mos protein only in rat PS cells, but not in RS. No definite explanation can be given for this discrepancy, but it has to be underlined that the RS fractions used in the present study were, at more than 8O%, composed of 1C cells (RS cells) (see materials and methods section). Moreover, the presence of Mos in cell-sorted RS (see fig. 4a) fits our western blot results. We observed that Mos was present throughout the long prophase of meiosis I (MI) and that its level culminated in middle to late PS, then decreased after the first meiotic division. Our results appear therefore in agreement with Nagao [27] who observed that a gradual increase of spermatid formation occured a few days after the beginning of the c-Mos protein expression in vitro and suggested that the 43kD c-Mos protein has a role in spermatogenic cells that are close to meiotic division. However, these changes appear rather different from those observed in Xenopus oocytes, in which Mos is synthesized around the time of completion of MI and is at its maximal level during meiosis II (MII) [28] (see discussion below).

To our knowledge, Emi2 and its mRNA have been described before only in the whole mouse testis, and their quantities were found to be higher in the testis than in the ovary [9]. This difference might be due to the presence of Emi2 and its mRNA in a larger number of meiotic cells in the testis than in the ovary. Indeed, our results showed the presence of Emi2 in all rat testis meiotic cells with the highest level in middle to late PS, whereas in the oocyte, Emi2 is only synthesized around the end of MI, just before interkinesis, and it is present at a high level only during MII [29].

Cyclin E and Cdk2 were co-localized in PS and RS, and these two proteins were already present in young PS with their levels culminating in middle to late PS, just before the first meiotic division. Our data are in agreement with previous studies showing the presence of Cdk2 in mouse spermatogonia and spermatocytes [30], [31] and Cyclin E in rat PS and RS [18]. However, Ravnik and Wolgemuth [31] did not detect the presence of Cdk2 in mouse RS. This might be explained by a species-specific staining pattern or, more likely, by the difference of sensitivity of the method used for the antibody revelation: DAB staining and observation on a microscope under bright-field optics in the work of Ravnik and Wolgemuth, scanning fluorescence using a confocal laser unit in our work. Indeed, it appears from our flow cytometric analysis that the levels of Cdk2 are rather low in RS. Our results showed the presence of Cyclin E and Cdk2 in all meiotic cells; this is different from those described in Xenopus oocytes, in which Cyclin E/Cdk2 were present at very low levels during MI and increased markedly just before MII [7].

Taken together our results indicate that the components of CSF are present at high levels in rat spermatocytes at earlier stages of meiosis than in the oocyte. The presence of these four proteins throughout the long prophase of MI might compensate the short duration of MII (stage XIV lasts only 14 hours) which would not be sufficient for the establishment of a CSF-like arrest. A second explanation could be the different fates of the oocyte and of the SII, both blocked in MPII. Whereas in the oocyte, the establishment of CSF activity at the end of MI and its maintenance during prometaphase II and MPII make the oocyte staying alive and blocked until fertilization (at least 48 hours), the blocked SII will probably die quickly [32], [33], stopping RS formation [4].

A further interesting issue is how the meiotic arrest can be achieved at MPII but not at metaphase of meiosis I (MPI) under these conditions. No clear answer can be given at the present time, but it has to be noted that also in the oocyte, many components of the Mos pathway are present and active at MPI. For example, Mos, MAPK, p90rsk (the 90-kD ribosomal protein S6 kinase) and Bub1 (budding uninhibited by benz-imidazole 1) are essential for suppressing the S phase between the first and the second meiotic divisions, yet do not block eggs at MPI [34].

Under our culture conditions, beta-NGF induced a decrease in the yield of MII by blocking SII in MPII together with an increase of Mos in middle to late PS, PS in division and SII ([4] and present results). It should be emphasized that the relatively high standard errors of the mean levels of Mos observed sometimes, both in basal and treated cultures, were due to variations between the different experiments (this is not unexpected as it was a relative quantification: see materials & methods section). Indeed, in all five experiments performed in the presence of beta-NGF, all exhibited increased levels of Mos in middle to late PS, PS in division and SII as compared to their corresponding cells under basal condition, resulting therefore in statistical significant differences.

Even under basal condition (no beta-NGF added), some middle to late PS, PS in division and SII (roughly 30-40% of the total populations) exhibited high level of Mos (close to those expressed by most of the cells cultured in the presence of beta-NGF; see Fig. 5A). This resulted most likely from the action of "endogenous" beta-NGF which is produced by (and acts on) the meiotic cells in co-cultures of PS with Sertoli cells [4]. Similarly, the relatively high levels of Mos observed in freshly prepared middle to late PS (see Fig. 4A) would be due to beta-NGF produced by meiotic cells in vivo [4]. Actually, the yield of meiosis in vivo is only two RS from one PS [35]. Conversely, even in the presence of a maximal concentration of beta-NGF [4], not all middle to late PS, PS in division and SII exhibited high Mos levels (see Fig. 5A). This fits with our previous results [4] demonstrating that under the same conditions (a maximal concentration of beta-NGF) the number of RS formed in vitro is decreased at most two fold as compared to cultures performed under basal conditions.

Overexpression of the proto-oncogene v-mos (pp39v-mos) during male meiosis results in a "CSF-like arrest" at MPI [36]. However overexpression of v-Mos occured in leptotene-zygotene spermatocytes, i.e. much before middle to late PS. This could explain, at least in part, that the blockade was observed at MPI and not at MPII.

The physiological regulation of Mos synthesis is not well-understood. However, a positive feed-back between MAPK and Mos synthesis has been described in the oocyte [37]. This is of interest since one pathway of neurotropin action involves the MAPK [38] which are present, together with NGF receptors, in both Sertoli cells and late spermatocytes [4], [12].

Since Emi2 was also up-regulated by beta-NGF in late meiotic cells, it is tempting to speculate that these proteins are involved in the same pathway of regulation of spermatocyte differentiation as they are in the oocyte [8], [9], [34]. As there is an increase in Mos and Emi2 in the oocyte at the time of its arrest in MPII [28], [29], our results strongly suggest a relationship between the increase of Mos and Emi2 induced by beta-NGF and the beta-NGF induced arrest of SII in MPII. Conversely Cyclin E and Cdk2 are not likely involved in the blockage of SII as neither protein was increased under beta-NGF treatment. Besides it must be underlined that in the oocyte stable CSF arrest may occur only after full inhibition of the anaphase promoting complex induced by the two pathways [34], which would not be necessary in the blocked SII which will degenerate quickly.

By negatively regulating the meiotic differentiation of PS, NGF could be implicated in the adjustment of the number of RS supported by Sertoli cells. To ensure an optimal number of germ cells per Sertoli cell, germ cell loss (apoptosis) occurs normally during spermatogenesis [33]. Under our in vitro conditions, neither the total (germinal and somatic) number of cells nor their viability was significantly altered by beta-NGF treatment [4]. Moreover the proportion of apoptotic germinal cells, determined by caspase-3 assay, was similar under basal and beta-NGF-treated conditions (Perrard M-H. and Durand P., unpublished results). No definite explanation to this result can be given at the present time, but it is likely that the low number of degenerating SII was not highlighted due to the rapid phagocytosis of apoptotic cells. This assumption seems all the more likely, as Sertoli cells are highly phagocytic [32] and fits with previous studies [12], [39], [40].

In a previous work we showed that TGFbeta1 was also able to regulate negatively the meiotic differentiation of rat PS by blocking SII in metaphase [41]. Synergism and/or redundancy between local regulatory factors is a characteristic of the spermatogenic process [40], [42]. We have found that there is redundancy, but no additivity, between beta-NGF and TGFbeta1 on the accumulation of MPIIs [43], and that TGFbeta1 also up-regulates Mos in late spermatocytes in co-cultures (data not shown). These results indicate that NGF and TGFbeta1 could join up on the same pathway in meiotic cells. It is well established that the intracellular effectors of TGFbeta1 signalling are the smad proteins [44], but it has also been shown recently that TGFbeta1 activates other signalling cascades including the MAPK pathway in different cell types especially in epithelial cells [44], [45].

Taken together the present results suggest that CSF is not restricted to the oocyte. Moreover, they reinforce the view that NGF is one of the intratesticular factors which regulate negatively the second meiotic division by enhancing Mos (and Emi2) in late spermatocytes and thereby adjusting the number of RS that can be supported by the Sertoli cells.

RNA extraction from total germ cells or from elutriated PS and RS fractions from 90-day-old rats [40] and reverse transcription were performed as described [4]. The purity of the PS and RS fractions was assessed by flow cytometry (see below). For the PS fractions 94+/-3% of the cells were 4C cells, 3+/-2% were 2C cells and 1+/-0.5% were 1C cells, n = 5. For the RS fractions (81+/-2% of cells were 1C cells, 5+/-1% were 2C cells and 10+/-2% were 4C cells, n = 3). The PCR reactions were performed according to the instructions of the GoTaq PCR Core System I kit (Promega). Polymerase chain reactions were carried out on 5 microl from 100 microl of RT mix. Primers for cDNA amplification of either mos or emi2 or cyclin E or cdk2 or 18S (Sigma-Aldrich, St Quentin-Fallavier, France) are shown in Table 1. PCR conditions were: denaturation at 94degreesC for 1 min, annealing for 1 min (mos, emi2 and cdk2) or 1.5 min (cyclin E) or 30 sec. (18S) at the indicated temperatures (Table 1) and elongation at 72degreesC for 1 min After the last cycle, cell samples were incubated for an additional 10 min at 72degreesC. Control PCR with untranscribed RNA, or H2O were performed in parallel. The amplified products were electrophoresed in parallel with size markers on 2% Metaphor Agarose gels (Tebu, Le Perray-en-Yvelines, France). No product was seen in the negative controls (data not shown).

Elutriated PS and RS fractions from 90-day-old rats [40] were lysed by sonication in 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 150 mM NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mM Na3VO4, 10 mM NaF, 10 mM betaglycerophosphate, 2 mM EDTA, and 2% v/v of a protease inhibitor Cocktail Tablets (Roche Diagnostics). Protein concentrations were determined with Coomassie Plus Protein Assay Reagent (Thermos Fisher Scientific, Brebieres, France). SDS-PAGE separation was carried out according to the method of Laemmli [46] on 10% polyacrylamide gels. Fifty micrograms of proteins per well were loaded. After electrotransfer, the PVDF membranes (GE healthcare Bio-Sciences) were stained with Ponceau Red S (Sigma-Aldrich) to verify the blotting of proteins on the membrane for each well. Reactions were carried out in PBS-0.05% Tween. The membranes were incubated with the specific antibodies: a rabbit polyclonal antibody raised against Mos (US Biological, Swampscott, MA), or a goat polyclonal antibody against Emi2 (Everest Biotech, Oxfordshire, UK), or a rabbit polyclonal antibody against cyclin E (Delta Biolabs, Gilroy, CA), or a monoclonal antibody against Cdk2 (Santa-Cruz, Le Perray-en-Yvelines, France) at 1/250, 1/300, 1/750 and 1/200 dilutions, respectively. After incubation with appropriate secondary HRP-conjugated antibodies, detection was performed by chemiluminescence (ECL Plus Western Blotting Detection System from GE Healthcare Bio-Sciences).

Co-cultures of Sertoli cells together with elutriated PS were performed as described [40], [47]. Sertoli cells were isolated from about twelve 20-23-day-old Sprague-Dawley rats by enzymatic digestion and plated in bicameral chambers (area 1 cm2; polyester membrane, pores 0.4 microm diameter) (Falcon, Becton-Dickinson, Meylan, France) at a density of about 3x105 cells/cm2. Cells were then cultured for 3 days in HEPES-buffered F12/DMEM supplemented with insulin (10 microg/ml), transferrin (10 microg/ml), vitamin C (10-4 M), vitamin E (10 microg/ml), retinoic acid (3.3x10-7 M), retinol (3.3x10-7 M), pyruvate (1 mM), testosterone (10-7 M) (all products from Sigma, La Verpilliere, France) and ovine NIH FSH-20 (1 ng/ml) obtained through NIDDK and Dr A.F. Parlow (lot no. AFP-7028D). On day 3 of culture (referred to as day 0 of co-culture), PS obtained from five adult Sprague-Dawley rats by centrifugal elutriation [48] were seeded (3x105 cells/cm2) on Sertoli cells. 13% of elutriated PS/DS were early PS (stages XIV-IV), 61% were middle PS (stages V-IX), and 26% were late PS/Diplotene Spermatocytes (stages X-XIII) [40]. In some wells, 10 ng/ml of human recombinant beta-NGF (Pepro-Tech, London, UK) were added in both the apical and the basal compartments of the chamber. Only basal media (with or without beta-NGF) were renewed every two days; beta-NGF was added to the apical media at the same interval [4].

The relative levels of Mos, Emi2, cyclin E and Cdk2 were measured in co-cultured meiotic cells as described above for meiotic cells. Additionally, in order to identify PS in division and SII in division, cells were incubated as above with an Alexa Fluor 488 conjugated (Alexa Fluor 488 labeling kit from Invitrogen) anti- phospho-Histone H3 (Ser10) antibody [12] at 1/12 dilution. It was previously verified that the R-PE- conjugated swine anti-goat IgG did not cross react with the complex phospho-Histone H3- Alexa Fluor 488 conjugated anti- phospho-Histone H3 antibody (data not shown).

After immunolabeling, cells were analyzed using a FACSVantage SE cell sorter (BD Biosciences, CA) equipped with an Enterprise II argon ion laser emitting simultaneously a 50 mw line tuned to UV (351 nm) and a second line tuned to 448 nm at 130 mw, to respectively excite Hoechst 33342 and Alexa Fluor 488 or PE or Alexa 647. Emission of PE (lambdareem  = 585 nm), Alexa 647 (lambdareem  = 647 nm) and Alexa Fluor 488 (lambdareem  = 530 nm) fluorescence were acquired after logarithmic amplification through band-pass filters respectively BP 585/40 nm, 675/40 nm and BP 530/30 nm. Emission of Hoechst 33342 fluorescence (lambdareem  = 424 nm) was acquired after linear amplification through a 424/44 nm filter. Acquisition and analysis were performed using CellQuest ProTM 4.0.2 software. Cell sorting on slides was performed using CloneCytTM Plus 3.1 software. Analyses were performed as previously described in details [12]. Six data parameters were acquired and stored in list mode files: linear forward light scatter (FSC) and linear side angle light scatter (SSC) which roughly represent cell size and cellular granularity, respectively; logarithmic (log) PE (Mos, Emi2, cyclin E or Cdk2), log Alexa Fluor 488 (phospho-Histone H3), log Alexa 647 (vimentin) to detect the immunolabeling, and linear Hoechst to measure the DNA content of the different populations of cells. Contaminating events such as debris and clumped cells were eliminated from the analysis by gated on morphological parameters. In order to allow the detection of a sufficient number of PS in division [which represented 3.7+/-0.4% of PS (m+/-s.e.m., n = 5)] and of SII in division (which represented 5.1+/-2.7% of SII (m+/-s.e.m., n = 5)) which were both rare cells [49], each acquisition was performed on 1.8+/-0.3 millions co-cultured cells [co-cultured cells contained 34+/-7% Sertoli cells and 66+/-7% germ cells (m+/-s.e.m., n = 5)].

Relative levels of Mos, Emi2, Cyclin E and Cdk2 were measured in germ cells which are vimentin-negative (window R2 in Fig. 6a). PS in division (PHH3+ PS) and SII in division (PHH3+ SII) were identified by using the Alexa Fluor 488 conjugated anti- phospho-Histone H3 antibody (windows R6 and R5 respectively in Fig. 7a). Then the three different parameters "FSC/SSC and ploidy" allowed the identification of young PS, middle to late PS, SII and RS[12]. The Mos or Emi2 or cyclin E or Cdk2 content for each of these six populations was obtained by subtracting the fluorescence background from the mean fluorescence of positive cells. The linearity of these assays was checked by plotting the contents of RS, doublets and triplets of RS [21] in Mos (r  =  0.976, p<0.001), Emi2 (r  =  0.997, p<0.001), cyclin E (r  =  0.994, p<0.001) or Cdk2 (r  =  0.977, p<0.001).
