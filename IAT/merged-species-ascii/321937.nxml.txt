A cDNA library prepared from poly(A)+ RNA of 2-acetylaminofluorene (AAF) induced rat hepatocellular carcinoma was screened by synthetic DNA probes deduced from a partial amino acid sequence of glutathione S-transferase P subunit that had been isolated from the tumor by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis. One of the four clones analyzed contained an mRNA region encoding the total amino acid sequence of this enzyme subunit and the complete 3'-noncoding region. The nucleotide sequence indicates that this enzyme subunit has 209 amino acids (calculated Mr=23,307) distinct from other glutathione S-transferase subunits such as Ya and Yc. Comparison of the amino acid sequences between these proteins indicates that glutathione S-transferase P subunit gene has been evolved from the ancestral gene at an earlier stage than the separation of Ya and Yc and that there are at least three domains having a considerable homology with each other in these enzymes. The very large increase of this mRNA in chemically induced hepatocellular carcinoma suggests a characteristic derepression of this gene during hepatocarcinogenesis.
