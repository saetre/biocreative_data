We compare the nucleotide sequences of the regulatory regions of five genes or groups of genes of the arginine regulon of Escherichia coli K-12: argF, argI, argR, the bipolar argECBH operon and the carAB operon. All these regions harbour one or two copies of a conserved 18 bp sequence which appears to constitute the basic arginine operator sequence (ARG box). We discuss the influence of ARG box copy number, degree of dyad symmetry, base composition, and position relative to the cognate promoter site on the derepression-repression ratios of the genes of the regulon. A novel hypothesis, based on structural considerations, is also put forward to account for the absence ot attenuation control.
