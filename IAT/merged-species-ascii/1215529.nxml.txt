HBV particles were produced in culture medium of HepG2 cells transfected with the mammalian expression vector containing the linear HBV genome, as assessed by commercially available ELISA assay. A cDNA library was made from these cells exposed to HBV. From yeast two hybrid screening with HBX as bait, human guanine nucleotide binding protein beta subunit 5L (GNbeta5) was isolated from the cDNA library constructed in this study as a new HBX-interacting protein. The HBX-GNbeta5 interaction was further supported by mammalian two hybrid assay.

Infection by hepatitis B virus (HBV), an enveloped DNA virus of the hepadnaviridae family, has been closely related to development of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The role of this virus in the series of events leading to the onset of HCC has remained elusive [1]. However, it has been suggested that the smallest protein encoded by the HBV genome, HBX, is involved in the development of HCC [2].

Several proteins have been demonstrated to interact with the HBX protein through the use of the Yeast Two Hybrid system. These include the C-terminal portion of a novel human proteasome alpha subunit which possesses a protein sequence of close relationship to that of the 28 kD subunits from other organisms; PSMA7, the alpha-subunit of the 20S proteasome complex; PSMC1, the subunit of the 19S proteasome regulatory cap complex; XAPC7, a highly conserved proteasome subunit belonging to the alpha-subunit of the 20S proteasome complex. PSMA7, PSMC1 and XAPC7 were demonstrated to interact with the second Kunitz-type domain of the HBX protein [3-6]. Another two proteins, XAP2 (X-associated protein 2) and XIP (HBX-interacting protein) were found to be negative regulators of HBX. Overexpression of XAP2 abolished the transactivating function of HBX while the specific interaction of XIP to the carboxy terminus of HBX in differentiated HCC cells led to a reduction of wild-type HBV viral replication to levels similar to that observed after transfection with HBX-minus virus [7,8].

HBX was also shown to interact with XAP-1 (X-associated protein 1), a human homolog of the monkey UV-damaged DNA-binding protein (UV-DDB) which might be involved in DNA repair [9]. Besides these, HBX was able to interact and colocalise with HVDAC3 to the mitochondria, resulting in decreased mitochondrial transmembrane potential. HVDAC3 was identified as a new member of the human voltage-dependent anion channel (VDAC) family that provides pathways for ATP and metabolites across the mitochondrial membrane. It constitutes part of the permeability transition pore complex in the mitochondral membrane which regulates mitochondrial transmembrane potential and cytochrome c release [1].

However, these reported HBX interacting proteins have all been isolated from normal liver cDNA library (cells that had not been exposed to HBV), which may reflect physical but physiologically not meaningful interactions. There is therefore a need to comprehensively isolate and characterize, in a HBV-infected environment, cellular proteins interacting with the widely studied HBX.

Such an environment has previously been generated in vitro, firstly by showing that clonal cells derived from HepG2 transfected with a HBV-containing plasmid could elicit acute hepatitis in chimpanzees through secretion of hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) particles and virions [10], and later by our investigation indicating the production of HBV particles in culture medium of HepG2 cells transfected with a replication competent HBV genome cloned in a mammalian expression vector [11].

The culture medium of the HepG2 cells transfected with infective HBV genome [11] was assayed for the presence of HBsAg prior to cell harvesting for RNA extraction. In Table 1, values D1, E1, F1, G1, H1, A2, B2, C2, D2, E2, F2, G2 and H2 corresponded respectively to the undiluted medium, its 10x, 102x, 103x, 104x, 105x, 106x, 107x, 108x, 109x, 1010x, 1011x, 1012x serial dilutions measured at an absorbance of 450 nm. The presence of HBsAg was indicated in the undiluted medium, its 10 x dilution and up to 104 x dilution. The values of these samples were respectively, 2.393, 0.464 and down to 0.186. They exceeded the calculated cut-off of 0.179, thus indicating the presence of HBsAg. The results of this assay run were valid as the criteria for the quality control had been met. The mean A450 of the negative controls was 0.129, which did not exceed 0.2. The A450 of the positive control was 1.494, which was 1.365 higher than the mean A450 of the negative controls. The value of the positive control fulfilled the quality control criteria which requires the value to be at least 0.8 higher. The cut-off of the assay reading, 0.179, was derived by adding 0.05 to the mean A450 of the negative controls. Based on this cut-off value, readings that were equivalent to or higher than 0.179 indicated reactive samples. Taken together, our results indicated the presence of viral infection process in HepG2 cells transfected with the replicative HBV genome.

The cDNA library that would be used in the yeast-two-hybrid screening for protein-protein interactions was constructed by simultaneous transformation of double-stranded cDNA and the activation domain vector, pGADT7-Rec, into yeast strain AH109. After a 4-day incubation period, yeast plasmid DNA was extracted 10 random yeast colonies used as template for PCR. Presence of cDNA inserts of varied sizes ranging between 300 to 600 base pairs were indicated in lanes 4, 6, 7, 9, 10 and 11 as shown in Figure 1. Library transformants were then harvested and pooled.

The total number of colonies that resulted from the yeast two hybrid screening and the percentage number of colonies that progressively developed a blue colour over a span of 4 days was tabulated in Table 2. The absence of blue color for the 10 colonies resulting from the empty pGBKT7 suggested that 50% of the blue colonies corresponded to HBX-interacting proteins.

Blue colour development was due to the use of the X-alpha-Gal assay system as an indication of positive interactions in the yeast-two-hybrid system. Colonies that resulted from the screening of the cDNA library and the HBX-pGBKT7 bait as well as those that resulted from the negative control reaction which is the interaction between the empty bait and the cDNA library were observed for their development of blue colouration on SD/-Ade/-His/-Trp/-Leu/X-alpha-Gal agar.

Y187 yeast strain was transformed individually with each of the 3 control bait constructs empty pGBKT7 vector, full length HBX in pGBKT7 vector and negative pGBKT7-Lamin control vector. Colonies that grew on SD/-Trp were transferred to SD/-Trp/X-alpha-Gal. Blue colour development was observed over a period of 5 days. Transformation of these 3 negative control plasmids into Y187 yeast strain did not produce yeast colonies on SD/-Ade/-Trp and SD/-His/-Trp plates after incubation of 5 days. A comparison of the intensity of blue coloration of positive clones resulting from the library screening is shown in Fig 2. In contrast to these blue colonies, only white color was observed for the three negative control clones from the individual transformation of the empty pGBKT7 vector, full length HBX in pGBKT7 vector and negative pGBKT7-Lamin control vector.

The negative control experiment as shown in Table 2, in which an empty bait vector was used in place of the HBX bait yielded 10 colonies after the screening but none of these turned blue. Therefore, it can be concluded that the X-alpha-Galactosidase assay is a reliable method for determining positive interactions in the yeast-two-hybrid system. As shown in Fig. 2, the HBX bait alone did not activate transcription of the reporter gene that led to blue colour development. This confirms that the blue colonies which resulted after screening were indeed due to interactions between the AD fusion protein and the BD fusion protein in the two separate yeast strains.

Through the analysis of sequences of 9 positive clones, only one had a library insert that was in frame with the activation domain of GAL4 protein on pGADT7-Rec vector. The insert corresponded to human guanine nucleotide binding protein beta subunit 5L (GNbeta5). Although it has been well established that HBX interacts with many molecules of cellular signaling pathway, GNbeta5 has hitherto not been identified as a HBX-interacting protein. The use of a cDNA library constructed from HBV-transfected HepG2 cells would therefore be significant in that it would enable cellular signaling events occurring after HBV infection to be traced via interactions with the HBX protein which had been implicated in HBV-related hepatocellular carcinoma. This also implies that the use of an infected library increases the likelihood of identifying new interacting partners.

Despite the stringency of nutritional selection through the use of the AH109 yeast strain which contains three reporters, namely, ADE2, HIS3 and MEL1, the yeast-two-hybrid system is only able to reduce the number of false positives. There still exists an uncertainty of whether interactions are always true positives. For this reason, the Mammalian-Two-Hybrid system was used to re-confirm the interaction. This system verifies protein-protein interactions by transcriptional activation. Similar to the yeast two hybrid system, the Mammalian-Two-Hybrid Checkmate system consists of two vectors namely pBIND and pACT. Interaction between two proteins expressed from these two vectors will be assessed by the luciferase activity following the transient transfection of both vectors into mammalian cells.

The pBIND-GNbeta5 plasmid was transfected together with the pACT-HBX plasmid and the pG5luc luciferase vector to test the protein-protein interaction between partial GNbeta5 sequence and full-length HBX in the Mammalian-Two-Hybrid system. The percentage activity as reflected by the luciferase reporter was plotted out in the graph shown in Figure 3. The assay value given by this interaction was compared against the positive control nteraction between pACT-MyoD and pBIND-1d and a negative control which included pBIND-GNbeta5 and the empty pACT vector. The results showed that the luciferase activity triggered by interaction between the partial GNbeta5 and full length HBX was twenty percent higher than that produced by the negative control reaction, thus suggesting presence of interaction. However, the luciferase activity of the interaction was only 63% of that measured for the interaction in the positive control. Thus, although the experimental value exceeds that of the negative control, the confirmation of the interaction between HBX and partial GNbeta5 can be fine tuned by further tests using the same system.

Possible Role of GNbeta5 in HBX-mediated Cellular Signaling Pathway
###end title 33

G proteins are heterotrimeric guanine nucleotide binding proteins that are involved in signal transduction. They are peripherally associated with the plasma membrane and function to couple signals to seven transmembrane-spanning surface receptors. G proteins consist of alpha, beta and gamma subunits, of which beta and gamma subunits are tightly associated. In a typical G protein coupled signaling pathway, the ligand-activated receptor catalyzes the exchange of guanine nucleotides in the alpha subunit. The GTP-bound alpha subunit dissociates from the receptor as well as the betagamma subunit and proceeds to activate its respective effector molecule. The free betagamma subunit also activates a similar or different effector molecules.

The hydrolysis of the bound-GTP to GDP by intrinsic GTPase activity of the alpha subunit leads to a conformational switch, resulting in the termination of its effector interaction. The resulting alpha-GDP re-associates with the free betagamma subunit. This is followed by re-entry of the newly formed heterotrimer into the signaling cycle. To date, 17 alpha subunits, five beta subunits and 12 gamma subunits have been identified [12].

The GNbeta5 isolated in our study would be of significance. Previous reports had suggested that the GNbeta5 protein was essentially soluble. The GNbeta5 protein displays sequence homology to a group of Gbeta-like proteins known as the WD-40 repeat family [13]. It has been proposed that this repeat enables G protein beta subunits to adopt multiple conformations which could greatly expand the number of signaling partners.

G proteins have also been implicated in cancer development [12]. In the classical paradigm, GPCR-mediated signal transduction involves the agonist-dependent interaction of GPCRs with G proteins at the plasma membrane, and the subsequent generation of soluble second messengers or ion currents by membrane localized effectors.

There exist two major mechanisms for transmembrane signaling in intercellular communication, mediated respectively by receptor tyrosine kinases and by GPCRs. Recent evidence shows that the two pathways can converge on the same effectors, for example, Ras and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK). Both systems appear to use specific protein-protein interactions for localization of key signaling intermediates to appropriate membrane compartments. For receptor tyrosine kinases, protein-protein interactions are mediated by Src homology SH2 and SH3 while for GPCRs, interaction of the betagamma complex of heterotrimeric G proteins [13].

Based on the above, HBX probably associates with GNbeta5 at the early cellular stage of HBV infection. From previous reports that Ras and MAPK constitute the point of convergence of the tyrosine kinase and the G protein coupled receptor signaling pathways, it is likely that HBX plays a role in bridging and activating the Src-kinase and MAPK mediated pathways at the early stage of viral infection. Further functional studies, including the down-regulation of expression of GNbeta5 using siRNA, should shed new lights on its role in HBV infection.
