###begin p 2
TGF-beta resistance often develops in breast cancer cells that in turn overproduce this cytokine to create a local immunosuppressive environment that fosters tumor growth and exacerbates the invasive and metastatic behavior of the tumor cells themselves. Smads-mediated cross-talk with the estrogen receptor has been implied to play an important role in development and/or progression of breast cancer. We investigated how TGF-beta regulates ERalpha-induced gene transcription and potential mechanisms of frequent TGF-beta resistance in breast cancer.

Effect of TGF-beta on ERalpha-mediated gene transcription was investigated in breast cancer cell lines using transient transfection, real-time PCR, sequential DNA precipitation, and small interfering RNA assays. The expression of Smads on both human breast cancer cell lines and ERalpha-positive human breast cancer tissue was evaluated by immunofluorescence and immunohistochemical assays.

A complex of Smad3/4 mediates TGF-beta inhibition of ERalpha-mediated estrogenic activity of gene transcription in breast cancer cells, and Smad4 is essential and sufficient for such repression. Either overexpression of Smad3 or inhibition of Smad4 leads to the "switch" of TGF-beta from a repressor to an activator. Down-regulation and abnormal cellular distribution of Smad4 were associated with some ERalpha-positive infiltrating human breast carcinoma. There appears a dynamic change of Smad4 expression from benign breast ductal tissue to infiltrating ductal carcinoma.

These results suggest that aberrant expression of Smad4 or disruption of Smad4 activity lead to the loss of TGF-beta suppression of ERalpha transactivity in breast cancer cells.

Estrogens act as mitogens to promote cell proliferation in both normal breast tissue and breast carcinomas through their binding to estrogen receptors (ER). The ERalpha is a transcriptional activator and regulates gene transcription either by directly binding to the estrogen-responsive element (ERE) or by interacting with other transcription factors [1,2]. Gene amplification or overexpression of ERalpha was found in some breast cancer [3,4]. Approximately 70% of breast cancers are ERalpha positive and estrogen dependent. ERalpha has become an important prognostic marker and a therapeutic target in breast cancer [5,6].

In contrast to estrogens, which induce proliferation of breast cancer cells, transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) inhibits the growth of human breast cancer cells in culture [7,8]. TGF-beta is the prototypic inhibitor of cell cycle progression and appears to directly antagonize the effects of many different mitogenic growth factors. A well-characterized TGF-beta signaling pathway is initiated by the association between TGF-beta and its two cell surface receptors, resulting in the formation of the receptor heterocomplex and activation of the type I receptor, which in turn activates the cytoplasmic receptor regulated-Smad (R-Smad: Smad2 and Smad3) proteins via phosphorylation [9]. Phosphorylated R-Smad associates with Smad4. The resulting heteromeric Smad complexes then translocate into the nucleus, where they regulate gene transcription in collaboration with other factors. The importance of the TGF-beta signaling pathway in cancer development is underscored by the presence of downregulation or inactivating mutations in genes encoding TGF-beta receptors and Smads in human carcinomas [10-12].

While the role of TGF-beta in breast cancer is ambiguous, as it was shown to display both tumor-suppressing and -enhancing effects, loss of responsiveness to TGF-beta is believed to be a major factor in tumor formation [13-15]. Activation of TGF-beta represents one of the physiological countermeasures that are invoked to protect transformed cells against ERalpha excessive mitogenic stimulation. Additionally, inhibition of some breast cancer cell growth by tamoxifen appears to be mediated by TGF-beta signaling pathway [16]. Inhibition of Tbeta RII expression abolished antiestrogen-dependent growth inhibition [17,18]. It has been shown that Smad2, Smad3 and Smad4 all have physical interactions with ERalpha and that Smad4 acts as a transcriptional co-repressor for ERalpha and inhibits tumor growth by inducing apoptosis in ERalpha-positive cells [19-22]. Although the regulated gene targets of Smads/ERalpha have not been identified, these findings imply that Smads-mediated cross-talk with the estrogen receptor plays an important role in development and/or progression of breast cancer.

In this study, we investigated how TGF-beta regulates ERalpha-induced gene transcription and potential mechanisms of frequent TGF-beta resistance in breast cancer. We demonstrated that Smad4 is essential for TGF-beta-mediated inhibition of ERalpha estrogenic transcription activity. Either overexpression of Smad3 or inhibition of Smad4 expression switches TGF-beta to an activator for ERalpha transactivation in breast cancer cells. In addition, we found that the expression of Smad4 was downregulated with increased cytoplasmic localization in ERalpha-positive human infiltrating breast cancer tissue.

MCF-7 cells were purchased from the American Type Culture Collection and maintained according to the manufacturer's instructions. MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468 cells were a gift from Dr. Joseph Messina (Department of Pathology, University of Alabama at Birmingham, Birmingham, AL). These two cell lines were incubated in Leibovitz's L-15 medium with 2 mM L-glutamine (ATCC) supplemented with antibiotics and 10% fetal bovine serum (Cellgro) at 37degreesC in 5% CO2. COS-1 cells were incubated in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Cellgro) supplemented with antibiotics and 10% fetal bovine serum at 37% in 5% CO2. The methods used for transient transfection and luciferase assay have been described in Wu L. et al. [21]. Similarly, 2x ERE-TATA reporter plasmid was used to examine the function of TGF-beta/Smads on the estrogen response element. The breast cancer cell line (MCF-7, MDA-MB-231 or MDA-MB-468) cells were split and plated at 5 x 104 cells/24-well plate. The cells were starved with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's phenol red-free medium supplemented with 10% charcoal-stripped bovine serum (Cellgro) for 24 hours. Transient transfections were performed using LipofectAMINE plus reagent (Invitrogen) with 0.2 mug of luciferase reporter and 2-20 ng (2 ng for MCF-7 cells; 20 ng for MDA-MB-231/468 cells) of the hERalpha expression plasmid. The amount of co-transfected Smad expression plasmid is indicated in the figures and text. Aliquots of cells were treated with E2, 1 nM (Sigma), TGF-beta1, 100 pM (R&D), or a combination of E2 + TGF-beta1. Sixteen hours after the treatment, luciferase activity was assayed in each cell line using the Dual-luciferasetrade mark assay kit (Promega) according to the manufacturer's instructions.

The complex of R-Smads and Smad4 forms the core of transcriptional regulatory machinery in TGF-beta signaling. We have demonstrated that the expression of Smad4 without TGF-beta treatment inhibited ERalpha-mediated transcription in a dose-dependent manner [21]. Both Smad3 and Smad2 were shown to interact with ERalpha, thereby having a direct impact on both TGF-beta and estrogen signaling pathways [19,21,22]. We therefore examined how the complexes of Smad4 and R-Smads mediate estrogen signal transduction through their interactions with ERalpha in breast cancer cells. We first performed a reporter assay using a construct bearing two repeats of the estrogen response element (ERE) and luciferase cDNA (2x ERE-TATA-LUC). MCF-7 breast cancer cells were co-transfected with expression plasmids of Smad2, Smad3, Smad4, or Smad4 in combination with either Smad2 or Smad3. The cells were then treated for 16 hours with either beta-estradiol (E2) alone or E2 in combination with TGF-beta1. As shown in Figure 1a, expression of either Smad2 or Smad3 enhanced E2-induced luciferase transcription in a dose-dependent manner. Smad2 had a limited effect. Overexpression of Smad4 alone or with Smad3 strongly attenuated E2-induced luciferase activity, whereas Smad2/4 only showed moderate inhibition. These results clearly indicate that Smad3 and Smad4 act as ERalpha coactivator and corepressor, respectively, and that Smad4 overrides Smad3/4 in the repression of ERalpha-induced transcription. Apparently, Smad2 is not a potent ERalpha coactivator, nor is the Smad2/4 complex an effective repressor. To confirm this observation, we performed a similar experiment in the breast cancer cell line MDA-MB-468 which lacks endogenous ERalpha and Smad4 [25]. By transient expression of a small amount of ERalpha, we reconstituted ERalpha-mediated signaling. Overexpression of Smad3 enhanced ERalpha-induced transcription, while Smad4 alone or in complex with Smad3 inhibited ERalpha transcription activity (Figure 1b). These results are similar to those observed in MCF-7 cells.

ERalpha regulates gene transcription either by binding directly to the promoter of target genes (such as PS2) or by binding indirectly through a mechanism involving other transcription factors such as Sp1 and AP1 (such as C-MYC). To determine whether Smad4 and R-Smads also regulate ERalpha downstream genes, we measured the endogenous mRNA levels of PS2 and C-MYC, using endogenous beta-actin mRNA as a control. The MCF-7 hormone-dependent breast cancer cell line was transiently transfected with Smad2/4 or Smad3/4 and treated with TGF-beta1 for 8 hours. Total mRNA was extracted followed by reverse transcription and semi-quantitative real time PCR. As shown in Figures 1c and 1d, TGF-beta downregulated the expression levels of PS2 and C-MYC mRNA stimulated by E2. Transient expression of Smad3/4 repressed the transcription of these two genes, while overexpression of Smad2/4 did not significantly alter the transcriptional activity. These results clearly indicate that, in breast cancer cell lines, Smad4 can either function as an ERalpha transcriptional co-repressor on its own or mediate TGF-beta suppression by forming a complex with Smad3.

Our next objective was to investigate how Smad3 and Smad4 can act differently in regulating ERalpha transcriptional activity. Smad3 is known to form a complex with Smad4 and translocate into the nucleus upon TGF-beta-induced phosphorylation. Similarly, the estrogen receptor, upon binding an estrogenic ligand such as E2, dimerizes and translocates into the nucleus. Therefore, we employed a co-immunoprecipitation (co-IP) assay to determine whether TGF-beta and E2 can regulate the interaction of ERalpha with Smad3 and Smad4. MCF-7 breast cancer cells were treated with either E2 alone or E2 together with TGF-beta1. The whole cell lysates were subjected to co-IP assays using anti-Smad4 or anti-Smad2/3 antibodies. The results demonstrated that the interaction between Smad2/3 and ERalpha was enhanced within 1 hr of TGF-beta addition, while Smad4 binding ERalpha was not dependent upon either E2 or TGF-beta1 stimulation (Figure 2a). Immunoprecipitation with a control mouse or rabbit IgG revealed no detected product (data not shown). The canonical transcriptional activation of ER target genes is attributable to the direct binding of ER to the estrogen responsive element in the promoter region of ER target genes. In our previous studies with chromatin immunoprecipitation assay [21], we demonstrated the Smad4 expression did not inhibit ERalpha binding to the chromatin. To further examine if Smad3/Smad4/ERalpha complex can bind to the ERE, we performed a sequential DNA precipitation assay [23]. FLAG-tagged Smad3 and Smad4 were co-transfected into COS-1 cells with HA-tagged ERalpha expression plasmids. The cells were then treated with E2, TGF-beta or E2 + TGF-beta. HA-tagged ERalpha was precipitated from cell extracts with anti-HA antibody. The precipitates were eluted with an HA peptide and subjected to DNA precipitation (DNAP) with either biotinylated ERE double-stranded DNA oligonucleotides (wild-type) or a disrupted sequence (mutant) as a control for the experiment. The precipitated protein complexes were examined by anti-FLAG, anti-HA, and control IgG antibodies. As shown in Figure 2b, the wild-type ERE probe precipitated ERalpha, Smad4 and a noticeable amount of Smad3. Immunoblotting with a control IgG revealed no detected bands. A treatment with TGF-beta1 enhanced the association of Smad3, but not that of Smad4, with the ERalpha-containing ERE precipitates (Figure 2b), that are consistent with the co-IP assay results (Figure 2a). These data suggest that Smad4 can function as an ERalpha corepressor independent of TGF-beta signaling, whereas Smad3 acts as a TGF-beta-regulated cofactor for ERalpha.

The EREaccommodates Smad3/4 and ERalpha complexes in the nucleus. (a) MCF-7 cells were treated with E2, E2 + TGF-beta1 or vehicle (as a negative control) for 1 hr as indicated. Lysates were subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti-Smad4, anti-Smad2/Smad3 or anti-ERalpha antibody. The Smad-associated endogenous ERalpha was detected by immunoblot analysis. The expression levels of endogenous proteins were monitored by immunoblotting of total cell protein. (b) COS-1 cells were transfected with HA-ERalpha, FLAG-Smad3 and FLAG-Smad4 expression plasmids. Cells were treated with (+) or without (-) E2 and TGF-beta1 and subjected to sequential immunoprecipitation, DNA pull-down (DNAP), and immunoblotting. Wild-type (WT) and mutant (mt) biotinylated ERE oligonucleotides were used in the DNAP. The presence of HA-ERalpha, FLAG-Smad3 and FLAG-Smad4 in the DNAP was detected with anti-FLAG and anti-HA antibodies.

We previously demonstrated that Smad4 through its MH1 domain and linker region interacted with the activation function 1 domain of ERalpha and that the ectopic expression of Smad4 inhibited E2- induced luciferase activity in a dose-dependent manner [21]. In addition, in breast T47D cells with undetected Smad4, ectopic expression of Smad4 resulted in inhibition of endogenous ERalpha direct response genes [21]. To further examine the essential role of Smad4 in the cross-talk between TGF-beta and estrogen signaling, we reduced the expression level of endogenous Smad4 using a small interfering RNA (siRNA) gene silencing technique. As shown in Figure 3a, Smad4 protein was almost non-detectable in the MCF-7 cells treated with Smad4-specific siRNA (siRNA-Smad4), while treatment of the MCF-7 cells with a non-specific siRNA (siRNA-Control) did not change the protein level of Smad4 or other control genes. The effect of TGF-beta on ERalpha-induced transcription was measured on two ERalpha downstream genes PS2 and C-MYC. As expected, transcription of both genes in the control cells (treated with siRNA-Control) was up-regulated by E2 treatment and down-regulated by TGF-beta (Figure 3b). In the siRNA-Smad4 treated cells, however, E2 induction enhanced the expression of both PS2 and C-MYC genes. Moreover, the addition of TGF-beta did not result in repression but instead stimulated estrogen-induced PS2 and C-MYC transcription (Figure 3b). Our findings indicate that the reduction of Smad4 protein attenuates the inhibitory effect of TGF-beta on estrogen-induced gene transcription. In the absence of Smad4, TGF-beta can regulate ERalpha signaling through Smad3 and thereby might be converted from a repressor to an activator of certain ER target gene responses.

Tumor cells often escape TGF-beta growth inhibition through the loss of key signaling transducers in the pathway. Our findings suggest that Smad4 is required for TGF-beta to inhibit ERalpha-induced transcription, which provides important information regarding TGF-beta resistance in breast cancer cells. It has been reported that altered expression levels or/and abnormal cellular distribution of biologically active proteins are associated with some human neoplasm [26-29]. We set to assess smad4 expression in human breast cancer cell lines and breast cancer tissue. While most breast cancer cell lines (e.g., MDA-MB-231) are essentially refractory to the growth inhibition, the MCF-7 cell line responds to TGF-beta by suppression of cell growth [30,31]. We employed both MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 to determine whether there is any difference in the expression of Smad4 protein. TGF-beta stimulated translocation of Smad2/3 with Smad4 into the nucleus of MCF-7 cells (Figure 4a). In the MDA-MB-231 cells, however, Smad4 did not translocate into the nucleus with Smad2/3 in response to TGF-beta stimulation (Figure 4b). These data suggest that cytoplamic retaining of Smad4 upon TGF-beta stimulation contributes to the resistance of MDA-MB-231 to TGF-beta growth inhibition. We then examined Smad4 expression in benign human breast and ERalpha-positive infiltrating ductal carcinoma tissue. Smad4 was strongly expressed in both cytoplasm and nucleus of benign breast ductal epithelial cells from 4 individuals (Figure 4c). In contrast, Smad4 are weekly expressed and largely restricted in the cytoplasm of cancer cells from 8 of 12 cases with infiltrating ductal carcinoma (Figure 4d). The variable cytoplasmic and nuclear expression of Smad4 was detected in the remaining 4 cases. To further investigate the significance of Smad4 expression in breast cancer, we examined the specimen with both benign ductal epithelial and cancer cells. As shown in Figure 4e-g, the residual benign ductal epithelial cells surrounded by infiltrating ductal carcinoma highly expressed Smad4 in both cytoplasm and nucleus, while the expression of Smad4 was markedly decreased and largely restricted to cytoplasm in ERalpha-positive infiltrating ductal carcinoma. These results demonstrate that the reduced expression and abnormal cytoplasmic retaining of Smad4 protein are present in some of ERalpha-positive infiltrating breast ductal carcinoma. The data also clearly indicate a dynamic change of Smad4 expression from benign breast ductal tissue to infiltrating ductal carcinoma.

Previous investigations have demonstrated that ER status is a very important factor in the management of breast cancer, and that suppression of ER mitogenic activity is a viable strategy for treatment and prevention of breast cancer. TGF-beta is a natural negative growth regulator of epithelial cells during both development and tumorigenesis of the mammary gland. Most breast carcinomas are refractory to the suppressive effect of TGF-beta with elevated TGF-beta expression, suggesting an important role of TGF-beta in breast cancer tumorigenesis.

In previous studies, we have demonstrated that Smad4 can act as a transcriptional corepressor for ERalpha [21]. Smad3, on the other hand, has been shown to act as a coactivator for ERalpha [19]. Since TGF-beta activation leads to the formation of an active Smad3/4 complex which directly binds to the promoter of many TGF-beta responsive genes, it is conceivable that the Smad3/4 complex, rather than Smad3 or Smad4 alone, plays a major role in the crosstalk between TGF-beta and estrogen. Our data clearly indicate that the Smad3/4 complex plays the same role as Smad4 alone, i.e., inhibiting ERalpha-mediated gene transcription. This observation is not surprising since TGF-beta treatment alone suppresses estrogen-induced ER target gene expression. However, it adds to the complexity of the question why Smad3 and Smad4 act in opposite ways in the regulation of estrogen signaling, while they have the same effect on TGF-beta signaling. One possible explanation is that, in the context of ERalpha-mediated transcription, Smad3 and Smad4 per se may recruit functionally different cofactors such as histone acetylases and histone deacetylases. The protein complex(es) recruited by Smad3 or Smad4 might determine the role of Smad3 or Smad4 as a transcriptional cofactor in estrogen signaling. In breast epithelial cells that have intact TGF-beta/Smad and estrogen signaling networks, the "net effect" of TGF-beta may be determined by the protein complex that incorporated both Smad3 and Smad4. In breast carcinoma cells that lack one component of the Smad3/4 complex, Smad3 or Smad4 may act as a coactivator or corepressor for ERalpha that confers a TGF-beta activating or suppressing signal on the estrogen signaling pathway. The high frequency of Smad4 mutations in human tumors [32-35] suggests a role for Smad4 as a tumor suppressor independent of TGF-beta signaling. Smad4 mutations in breast carcinoma have also been reported [36,37]. In addition, the work on Smad4 conditional knockout mice also indicates that Smad4 is required for the suppression function of TGF-beta in the proliferation of mammary epithelial cells [38].

We have shown that, in the presence of Smad4, TGF-beta inhibits ERalpha-mediated transcriptional activity. A decrease in Smad4 expression partially or completely abrogates TGF-beta suppression of ERalpha-target genes, and TGF-beta can further activate ER-target genes since Smad3 acts as a transcriptional coactivator for ERalpha (Figure 1a). It seems that TGF-beta can regulate ERalpha estrogenic transcriptional activity in both a negative and positive manner, and apparently, that the absence of Smad4 can switch TGF-beta from a suppressor to an activator of ER signaling. TGF-beta dual regulation of ERalpha transcriptional activity may also explain the biphasic effect in tumors: suppression of tumor growth at the early stages and promotion of tumor spreading during the later stages. Further investigations are needed to identify the target genes that are specifically regulated by R-Smads and/or Smad4, especially in the context of tumor cells. Hopefully, the results from future studies will lead to a better understanding of the dual role of TGF-beta in cancer development.

Loss of TGF-beta inhibition can be due to mutations or deletions of TGF-beta signaling components. Indeed, mutations of TGF-beta receptor or Smads-encoding genes have been reported in different forms of cancers, such as colon cancer and pancreatic cancer. Abnormal expression level and cellular distribution of biologically active proteins have been implicated in the tumorigenesis. Aberrant cytoplasmic localization of nucleophosmin in primary acute myeloid leukemia has been implicated in disrupting ARF-MDM2-p53 signal pathway and contributed to leukemogenesis [39,40]. Significant reduced expression of Smad4 protein was found in some human carcinoma including breast cancer [41-44]. Our data demonstrate that, in TGF-beta-treated MDA-MB-231 cells, Smad4 failed to translocate into the nucleus with Smad2/3, therefore losing the function of Smad4 as a repressor in the nucleus and probably contributing to decreased growth inhibition of TGF-beta in this cell line. In addition, the expression of Smad4 are decreased and largely restricted in the cytoplasm of some of ERalpha-positive infiltrating human breast cancer cells in contrast to the benign breast tissue in which Smad4 was strongly expressed in both cytoplasm and nucleus of ductal epithelial cells. Moreover, the marked difference of Smad4 expression is noted between carcinoma cells and surrounding residual normal ductal tissue from same specimen (Fig. 4e-g). These data indicate that the dysregulation of Smad4 protein expression may play a role in the development and progression of ERalpha-positive breast carcinoma. The fact that aberrant expression of Smad4 is only seen some of ERalpha-positive infiltrating breast cancer is consistent with the heterogeneity of human breast carcinoma in biological features, development and progression, and therapy response. It is likely that in an ERalpha-positive breast carcinoma with aberrant expression of Smad4, TGF-beta not only is unable to inhibit tumor growth, but also promote tumor progression through enhancing the estrogen-ERalpha mediated cell proliferation. The mechanism for dysregulation of Smad4 expression in ERalpha-positive infiltrating breast cancer is still unknown. It could be due to mutations or deletion of Smad4, or aberrant expression of certain oncoproteins. Our findings may provide a basic mechanism to explain the lack of TGF-beta responsiveness and anti-estrogen-dependent growth inhibition in some of ERalpha-positive infiltrating breast carcinoma, support an idea of both tumor suppressing and enhancing effects of TGF-beta in the development and/or progression of breast cancer, and open a path to further investigate the cause of aberrant expression of Smad4 in ERalpha-positive infiltrating breast carcinoma.

We have shown that TGF-beta can regulate ERalpha estrogenic transcriptional activity in both negative and positive manners. Smad4 is essential for TGF-beta-mediated inhibition of ERalpha estrogenic transcription activity, and the inhibition of Smad4 expression switches TGF-beta from a repressor to an activator for ERalpha transactivation in breast cancer cells. We have demonstrated that down-regulation and relatively increased cytoplasmic localization of Smad4 were associated with some ERalpha-positive infiltrating human breast carcinoma. These results suggest that aberrant expression of Smad4 or disruption of Smad4 activity be one of mechanisms for loss of TGF-beta negative regulation on ERalpha transcriptional activity in breast cancer.
