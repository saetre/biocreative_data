Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) is a common clinical disease and one of the most severe complications of acute liver failure (ALF). Although the mechanism responsible for SBP is unclear, cytokines play an important role. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) on the structure of the intestinal mucosa and the expression of tight junction (Zona Occludens 1; ZO-1) protein in a mouse model of ALF.

We induced ALF using D-galactosamine/lipopolysaccharide (GalN/LPS) or GalN/TNF-alpha and assessed the results using transmission electron microscopy, immunohistochemistry, Western blotting, ELISA and real-time quantitative PCR. The effects of administration of anti-TNF-alpha IgG antibody or anti-TNF-alpha R1 antibody before administration of GalN/LPS or GalN/TNF-alpha, respectively, on TNF-alpha were also assessed.

Morphological abnormalities in the intestinal mucosa of ALF mice were positively correlated with serum TNF-alpha level. Electron microscopic analysis revealed tight junction (TJ) disruptions, epithelial cell swelling, and atrophy of intestinal villi. Gut bacteria invaded the body at sites where TJ disruptions occurred. Expression of ZO-1 mRNA was significantly decreased in both ALF models, as was the level of ZO-1 protein. Prophylactic treatment with either anti-TNF-alpha IgG antibody or anti-tumor necrosis factor-a receptor1 (anti-TNF-alpha R1) antibody prevented changes in intestinal tissue ultrastructure and ZO-1 expression.

TNF-alpha affects the structure of the intestinal mucosa, decreases expression of ZO-1, and affects the morphology of the colon in a mouse model of ALF. It also may participate in the pathophysiological mechanism of SBP complicated to ALF.

Acute liver failure (ALF) is a devastating disease associated with high mortality. Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP), a common clinical disease, is one of the most severe complications of ALF and a major cause of death [1-4]. However, the mechanism responsible for SBP is unclear. Previous studies reported that the serum level of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) is elevated in patients with severe liver injury and is positively associated with serum lipopolysaccharide (LPS) level [5,6]. TNF-alpha is a cytokine with broad-spectrum physio-and patho-responsiveness and is primarily secreted by monocaryons and macrophages. In addition to participating in humoral and cellular immune responses, TNF-alpha also plays an important role in diseases such as severe hepatitis, septic shock, and inflammatory bowel disease [7-10]. However, it is not known whether TNF-alpha affects the barrier function of the intestinal mucosa.

The intestinal mucosa is a physical and metabolic barrier against toxins and pathogens in the lumen of the gut. Tight junctions (TJs) are the main structures responsible for restricting paracellular movement of compounds across the intestinal mucosa. Structurally, TJs are composed of cytoplasmic proteins, including the zona occludens proteins, ZO-1, ZO-2, and ZO-3 [11,12] and two distinct transmembrane proteins, occludin and claudin [13,14], which are linked to an actin-based cytoskeleton [15]. TJs function as occluding barriers by maintaining cellular polarity and homeostasis and by regulating the permeability of paracellular spaces in the epithelium [16]. ZO-1, a member of the MAGUK family of proteins, acts as a scaffold for organizing transmembrane TJ proteins and recruits various signaling molecules and the actin cytoskeleton to the TJs [17]. Although previous studies have afforded an insight into the molecular structure of TJs, much less is known about TJ functionality under physiological or pathophysiological conditions. Few studies have described intestinal mucosa ultrastructure or changes in TJs during liver failure. In this study, we used ALF animal models to investigate the effect of TNF-alpha on the ultrastructure of the intestinal mucosa with emphasis on the role of TJs.

All mice were randomly divided into eight groups (n = 8 per group). One group of mice was given intraperitoneal injections of D-galactosamine (GalN; 800 mg/kg body weight; Sigma, Saint Louis, USA) and LPS (10 mug/kg body weight; Sigma) to induce ALF. A second ALF-induction group was also given intraperitoneal injections of GalN (800 mg/kg body weight) and TNF-alpha (10 mug/kg body weight; Sigma). Two groups were given antibody treatments prior to ALF induction: one was given anti-TNF-alpha IgG (100 mug per mouse; US Biological, USA) and the other was given anti-TNF-alpha R1 antibody (100 mug per mouse; R&D Systems, USA). The anti-TNF-alpha IgG and anti-TNF-alpha R1 antibodies were injected via the vena caudalis 30 minutes and 15 minutes before GalN/LPS administration. There were four control groups, which were injected intraperitoneally with GalN, LPS, TNF-alpha, or NS.

Frozen intestinal tissue sections (5 mum thick) were fixed on glass slides by incubating them in acetone for 10 min at 4degreesC. The slides were incubated with 3% H2O2 for 20 minutes at room temperature and indirectly immuno-labeled using an ABC kit (Takara, Japan) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Slides were then blocked in goat serum for 30 min at 37degreesC and incubated with a rabbit anti-mouse polyclonal ZO-1 antibody (dilution, 1:50; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, USA) at 4degreesC overnight. For the negative controls, the primary antibody was replaced with PBS. This incubation was followed by incubation with biotinylated goat anti-rabbit IgG (Histostain-Plus kit, ZYMED) diluted 1:300 in PBS for 2 h at room temperature. Sections were rinsed in PBS and then in distilled water. The slides were stained with 3, 3'-diaminobenzidine and counterstained with hematoxylin.

Total RNA was isolated from intestinal tissues using TRIzol Reagent (Invitrogen, USA). RNA was purified using DNase I and depurified using PI-PCI-EHCO. SYBR-green-based real-time PCR (TaKaRa SYBR RT-PCR kit, Japan) was used to measure relative gene expression in each sample. First, we prepared an RNA standard (forward 5'-TTCCGGGTCGTGGATACTT-3', reverse 5'-GTTCCCAGCTTATGAAAGGGTT-3', amplicon size 327 bp) and determined standard curves for the ZO-1 gene and a house-keeping gene (GAPDH RNA standard forward 5'-CAGCCGCATCTTCTTGTG-3', reverse 5'-AGGAGCGAGACCCCACTAA-3', amplicon size 335 bp). PCR was performed using Taq DNA polymerase (Qiagen, Valencia, USA) and oligonucleotide primers for mouse ZO-1 (forward 5'-CGAGGCATCATCCCAAATAAGAAC-3', reverse 5'-TCCAGAAGTCTGCCCGATCAC-3', amplicon size 97 bp) and glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH; forward 5'-AAATGGTGAAGGTCGGTGTG-3', reverse 5'-TGAAGGGGTCGTTGATGG-3', amplicon size 108 bp). PCR conditions were as follows: one cycle at 95degreesC for 30 minutes followed by 45 cycles of PCR amplification, each consisting of 95degreesC for 5 s and 60degreesC for 20 s. The concentration of mRNA was calculated according to the standard curve and then normalized to that of GAPDH.

Most ALF mice (66.7%, 90/120) died between 6 h and 12 h after the GalN/LPS injection. Serum ALT levels increased significantly 6 h after the GalN/LPS injection compared with the control groups (P < 0.01) (Table 1). Serum TNF-alpha levels reached a maximum value (446.18 +/- 55.49 pg/ml) 2 h after the GalN/LPS injection and then decreased to 14.82 +/- 9.02 pg/ml at 6 h after the GalN/LPS injection (Figure 1). The second highest TNF-alpha level was observed 9 h after the GalN/LPS injection (319.43 +/- 33.72 pg/ml). Liver histopathology showed massive or submassive necrosis at 9 h after the GalN/LPS injection. We successfully used TNF-alpha in place of LPS to induce ALF in conjunction with GalN. The ALT levels and histopathological characteristics of the GalN/TNF-alpha group were similar to those of the GalN/LPS group. As the ALF mice that died 9 h (60%, 54/90) after GalN/LPS administration displayed levels of serum biochemical markers and liver morphology consistent with liver failure, we assessed the protective effects of anti-TNF-alpha IgG and anti-TNF-alpha R1 antibodies on liver failure 9 h after induction of ALF. The mortality of mice treated with either of the two antibodies was 0% (0/8). ALT serum levels were only slightly elevated and decreased rapidly compared with GalN/LPS-treated mice (P < 0.01). Histopathological examination showed only spot or focal hepatonecrosis.

We observed obvious ultramicrostructural changes in the intestinal mucosa after GalN/LPS administration. Some epithelial cell microvilli were disarranged and distorted, and they were sparsely distributed. The epithelial cells were swollen or shrunken. The mitochondrial matrices were swollen, cristae were breaked and the TJs were disrupted. The changes in the intestinal mucosa of mice treated with GalN/TNF-alpha were similar to those of mice treated with GalN/LPS. Some TJs were disrupted in the treatment groups, but there was no disruption of TJs in the control groups, only swelling of epithelial cells. Pathological changes in groups that were treated with antibodies were less severe than those in the ALF groups (Figure 2).

Immunohistochemical analysis revealed strong ZO-1 expression in the control groups. ZO-1 was moderately expressed in intestinal tissue 2 h after GalN/LPS or GalN/TNF-alpha treatment, and only traces remained 6 h after the treatments. By 9 h after the injections, it was difficult to detect positive signals for ZO-1, even in whole intestinal sections (Figure 4). ZO-1 expression was significantly increased in the two antibody-treated groups. Western blot analysis showed that ZO-1 expression decreased significantly in ALF mice, particularly 6 h and 9 h after the GalN/LPS or GalN/TNF-alpha injections (Figure 5). ZO-1 expression in the two antibody-treated groups was close to the normal range. These findings are consistent with the immunohistochemical results.

ZO-1 expression was significantly decreased at 9 h in GalN/LPS-treated mice (20.11 +/- 7.37%) and GalN/TNF-alpha-treated mice (35.47 +/- 7.34%) compared with the NS control (100.00 +/- 0.00%) and the other groups. No differences were observed in actin expression in the ALF model compared to the control. ZO-1 expression was unchanged at 2 h in the ALF group compared with the NS control. Each bar represents the mean +/- SE (n = 3 mice per group). Insets: representative Western blots. Lane 1, NS; lane 2, 2 h after GalN/LPS administration; lane 3, 6 h after GalN/LPS administration; lane 4, 9 h after GalN/LPS administration; lane 5, LPS; lane 6, D-GalN; lane 7, anti-TNF-alpha-treated group; lane 8, anti-TNF-alpha R1-treated group; lane 9, TNF-alpha-treated group; lane 10, 9 h after GalN/TNF-alpha administration. Statistical significance was determined using a one-way ANOVA followed by the Tukey test. *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01 vs. the NS control group.

The ZO-1 and GAPDH RNAs used in the standard preparation were 327 bp and 335 bp long, respectively. We obtained a reasonable amplification curve, a standard curve, and a molten curve. The correlation coefficients of both standard curves were 0.999. Real-time PCR quantitative analyses showed that there were marked decreases in ZO-1 expression in ALF mice 6 h and 9 h after GalN/LPS or GalN/TNF-alpha treatment (P < 0.05) (Figure 6).

Real-time quantitative RT-PCR for ZO-1 mRNA in the ALF groups and other control groups. ZO-1 mRNA level was decreased at 9 h in mice with ALF. Total RNA derived from each tissue was reverse transcribed and subjected to real -time quantitative RT-PCR to evaluate ZO-1 and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) mRNA levels. Results are expressed as the number of ZO-1 amplicons per 104 GAPDH amplicons. Bars represent the mean value for each group. The only significant difference in ZO-1 mRNA level between the ALF and control groups (NS: 100.00 +/- 0.00%) was at 9 h. At this time, there was decrease in the level of full-length ZO-1 mRNA in the ALF mice. At all other times, there was no difference between the ALF group and the other groups, which is consistent with our immunohistochemistry results.

The intestinal mucosal barrier is composed of mucosal fluid, microvilli, epithelial mucosal cell TJs and other special structures. TJs are the most important structures in the mucosal barrier. The mechanisms responsible for SBP include cytotoxic effects and alterations in the structure of the intestinal mucosa. Altered TJ structure in active liver cirrhosis has been described [18] preciously. However, it is rarely reported the ultrastructural characteristics and TJ structrue of the intestinal mucosa in ALF and the mechanisms that link ALF with SBP are still keep unclear.

In the present study, we found that severe damage to the intestinal mucosa occurred 9 h after GalN/LPS or GalN/TNF-alpha treatment. Morphologic alterations to the intestinal mucosa included shedding of epithelial cells, fracturing of villi, fusion of adjacent villi, mucosal atrophy and edema. Disruption of TJs on enterocytes and damage to the mitochondria and endoplasm were also observed. The recent discovery that several polarity complexes are conserved in mammalian cells and are closely associated with TJs indicates that TJs play a vital role in establishing epithelial cell polarity [19]. Although damage to the intestinal mucosa plays a significant role in bacterial invasion of the body, the responsible mechanism remains to be elucidated.

Moreover, we observed that bacteria in the intestinal tract of ALF mice invaded the intestinal mucosa by pinocytosis at 9 h after GalN/LPS administration. It should be noted that we observed simultaneous disruptions in the integrity of the TJs. Some studies showed that the integrity of TJs is important for maintaining cellular polarity [20], a change in cell polarity may have facilitated bacterial invasion, and bacterial invasion may have occurred via the sites of disrupted TJs between intestinal mucosa epithelial cells.

ZO-1 is important for maintaining the integrity of intestinal mucosal TJs during pathological insults [21]. In our study, we found that the immunoreactive ZO-1 signal in the intestinal mucosa was significantly decreased in ALF mice, which was confirmed by the results of Western blot analysis. We also found that ZO-1 expression was significantly decreased in the intestinal tissue of human ALF patients compared with controls, which is consistent with our findings with animal models. Thus, we conclude that decreased ZO-1 expression causes TJ disruption.

To detect the key role in the mechanism of the TJ disruption and ZO-1 protein dicreased in ALF, in liver injury, inflammation involves sequential activation of signaling pathways that result in the production of pro-and anti-inflammatory mediators. Among the pro-inflammatory mediators, the TNF-alpha and TNF-alpha R1 systems play central roles in the physiological regulation of intestinal barrier function [22,23]. TNF-alpha and IFN-gamma can induce intestinal epithelial barrier dysfunction [24]. In the present study, we found that in GalN/LPS-treated mice, TNF-a level reached a first peak at 2 h after GalN/LPS injection. We did not observe bacterial invasion of the intestinal mucosa or hepatocyte necrosis at this timepoint. The second peak occurred 9 h after the injection, at this timepoint we did observe bacterial invasion of the intestinal mucosa and hepatocyte necrosis. But bacterial invasion and hepatocyte necrosis were not observed in mice injected with either GalN or TNF-alpha alone. We thought that the first peak in TNF-alpha was the result of GalN/LPS injection, not ALF [23]. Then TNF-alpha was removed through degradation, whereas the second peak was released by activated macrophages, dendritic cells and kupffer cells, which was reported by Nakama T et al[24]. Moreover, some researchers have found that endotoxin (lipopolysaccharide: LPS) infection due to bacterial translocation is intimately involved in the organ failure. LPS that has translocated into portal blood binds to LPS-binding protein (LBP), was transported to the monocytes and Kupffer cells in liver sinusoids. Inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-alpha et al are produced and released by monocytes and Kupffer cells [25]. This study show that the bacterial invasion may play a role in the occurring of the second TNF-alpha peak, their relationship needs to be further investigated.

In addition, we found that the decrease in ZO-1 expression was correlated with an increase in the serum level of TNF-alpha. Many researchers have found that some cytokines can induce endocytosis of TJ proteins [26] and internalization of epithelial TJ proteins [27]. Reductions in levels of the tight junction protein, occludin, in intestinal epithelial cells may be caused by the production of TNF-alpha in mice with fulminant hepatic failure [28]. TNF-alpha-induced increase in Caco-2 cell TJ permeability was mediated by NF-kappa B activation. The increase in permeability was associated with NF-kappa B-dependent downregulation of ZO-1 protein expression and altered junctional localization [29-31]. In this study we found that event chronology is more important because it gives us some vital clues. The first TNF-alpha peak 2 h post GalN/LPS injection may induce the ZO-1 down expression and the tight junction disruption observed at 9 h. The pathophysiological processes of ALF in vivo is complicated, TNF-alpha plays an important role. TNF-alpha perhaps is an initiator which can induce more cytokines such as IL-6 and IFN-gamma, which can aggravate liver injury and initiate the development of ALF, and the disruption of TJ intestinal. The first TNF-alpha peak occurred at 2 h post injection may induce the ZO-1 down expression and the tight junction disruption observed at 9 h timepoint.

There was no any damage on TJs and no decrease in the expression of ZO-1 on the mice group accepted recombinant TNF-alpha, the purpose of this study was to discolse the change of TJ in ALF process, a positive finding could be observed if mice accepted a high dose of recombinant TNF-alpha, a further study need to performed in the future.

In order to study the role of TNF-alpha further, we used TNF-alpha antibody and anti-TNFR antibody. TNF-alpha antibody could neutralize the quantity of TNF-alpha, and anti-TNFR antibody could block the combination between TNF-alpha and TNF-alpha R. When TNF-alpha was blockaded with anti-TNF-alpha IgG antibody or anti-TNF-alpha R1 antibody, there was a significant decrease in the mice of liver failure and no bacterial invasion or hepatocyte necrosis. These data indicate that TNF-alpha is an important mediator of bacterial invasion of the intestinal mucosa during ALF. Moreover, we found that a significant reduction in ZO-1 mRNA expression in ALF mice and a significant induction of ZO-1 mRNA expression in ALF mice pretreated with either anti-TNF-alpha IgG antibody or anti-TNF-alpha receptor1 antibody. These findings suggest that TNF-alpha downregulates ZO-1 protein expression in intestinal tissue by inhibiting ZO-1 mRNA expression.

This study demonstrated the changes in intestinal mucosal morphology in mice with ALF. These changes were associated with disruption of TJ structure, changes in epithelial cell microvilli (disarrangement, distortion, and swelling or shrinkage) and mitochondrial matrices (mitochondrial swelling and disturbance of cristae). The disruption of the intestinal mucosa and consequent bacterial invasion of the body in ALF may be caused by reduced levels of the TJ-associated protein, ZO-1, the production of which was not controlled by transcription. These changes were caused by an elevated serum level of TNF-alpha, as they were absent when TNF-alpha was blocked by anti-TNF-alpha IgG antibody or anti-TNF-alpha R1 antibody. This study confirmed that TNF-alpha damages TJs and affects the expression of ZO-1 protein in vivo. TNF-alpha also may participate in the pathophysiological mechanism of SBP complicated to ALF. The mechanism of TNF-alpha-induced changes during ALF is complex and arrants further study.
