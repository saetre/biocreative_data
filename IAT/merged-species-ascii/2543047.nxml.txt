Background

###begin p 3
Nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) is a head and neck malignancy with high occurrence in South-East Asia and Southern China. Recent findings suggest that epigenetic inactivation of multiple tumor suppressor genes plays an important role in the tumourigenesis of NPC. BRD7 is a NPC-associated bromodomain gene that exhibits a much higher-level of mRNA expression in normal than in NPC biopsies and cell lines. In this study, we explored the role of DNA methylation in regulation of BRD7 transcription.

The presence of CpG islands within BRD7 promoter was predicted by EMBOSS CpGplot and Softberry CpGFinder, respectively. Nested methylation-specific PCR and RT-PCR were employed to detect the methylation status of BRD7 promoter and the mRNA expression of BRD7 gene in tumor cell lines as well as clinical samples. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSA) and luciferase assay were used to detect the effects of cytosine methylation on the nuclear protein binding to BRD7 promoter.

We found that DNA methylation suppresses BRD7 expression in NPC cells. In vitro DNA methylation in NPC cells silenced BRD7 promoter activity and inhibited the binding of the nuclear protein (possibly Sp1) to Sp1 binding sites in the BRD7 promoter. In contrast, inhibition of DNA methylation augments induction of endogenous BRD7 mRNA in NPC cells. We also found that methylation frequency of BRD7 promoter is much higher in the tumor and matched blood samples from NPC patients than in the blood samples from normal individuals.

BRD7 promoter demethylation is a prerequisite for high level induction of BRD7 gene expression. DNA methylation of BRD7 promoter might serve as a diagnostic marker in NPC.

NPC is a head and neck malignancy with high occurrence in South-East Asia and Southern China [1,2]. The development of this EBV-associated cancer may involve cumulative genetic and epigenetic changes in a background of predisposed genetic and environmental factors [3,4]. Genome-wide studies have unraveled multiple chromosomal abnormalities with involvement of specific oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes [5,6]. BRD7 has been recently identified as a bromodomain gene in NPC cells by cDNA Representational Difference Analysis (cDNA RDA) [7]. As a member of the bromodomain genes family, BRD7 may be considered as a component of chromatin remodeling complexes which possess histone acetyltransferase activity [8,9]. Together with E1B-AP5, BRD7 functions as an inhibitor of basic transcription in several viral and cellular promoters in the nucleus [10]. An alternative role of BRD7 arises from the evidence that BRD7 exhibits a much higher level of mRNA expression in normal nasopharyngeal epithelia than in NPC biopsies and cell lines [11,12]. Indeed, over-expression of BRD7 in NPC cells can effectively inhibit cell growth and cell cycle progression from G1 to S phase by transcriptional regulation of some key cell cycle related genes [13-15]. Our previous studies revealed the full-length promoter -404/+46 of BRD7 gene, and showed that Sp1 specifically bound to BRD7 promoter [16]. However, little is known about the down-expression of BRD7 in NPC cells. In this report, we reveal that DNA methylation results in the suppression of BRD7 expression in NPC cells. BRD7 promoter activity is regulated by methylation of CpG sites with the (G+C)-rich promoter region. DNA methylation inhibitor, 5-Aza-CdR, up-regulates BRD7 expression in NPC 5-8F cells. More importantly, the methylation frequency of BRD7 promoter is much higher in the tumor and matched blood samples from NPC patients than that in the blood samples from normal individuals. These results will be helpful in further understanding the transcription-repression mechanism of the BRD7 gene in NPC cells and the establishment of noninvasive approach in the early detection and surveillance of NPC.

Previous studies have shown that BRD7 was down-regulated in NPC biopsies and NPC cell lines [11]. Genomic DNA obtained from various cell lines was treated with sodium bisulfite under conditions where cytosines are converted to uracils, while methylated cytosines remain unmodified. By using methylation-specific and unmethylation-specific primers described in Fig. 2A, we performed methylation-specific PCR and revealed that HNE1, CNE1, 6-10B, 5-8F, SW480 and Hela cells exhibited a methylated BRD7 promoter, whereas no methylation of BRD7 promoter was found in COS7 and BHK-21 cells (Fig. 2B). RT-PCR showed down-expression of BRD7 mRNA in HNE1, CNE1, 6-10B, 5-8F, SW480 and Hela cells as compared to COS7 and BHK-21 cells. The data indicated that the mRNA expression of BRD7 gene is inversely correlated to the methylation status of BRD7 promoter in NPC cell lines.

To determine whether DNA methylation and chromatin modification contribute to the regulation of BRD7 expression in NPC 5-8F cells, BRD7 mRNA level was measured in the presence of various concentrations of 5-Aza-CdR alone, TSA alone or 5-Aza-CdR combined with TSA. As shown in Fig. 3A, BRD7 mRNA expression in NPC 5-8F cells was increased by 7 fold by 5-Aza-CdR (3.75 muM) and by 4 fold by TSA (1000 nM) relative to controls. The addition of TSA to 5-Aza-CdR did not result in additional enhancement of the BRD7 gene expression in NPC 5-8F cells. Methylation-specific PCR results showed that as low as 3.75 muM of 5-Aza-CdR was sufficient to completely reverse the methylation of BRD7 promoter in 5-8F cells (Fig. 3B). These data suggest that hypomethylation increased BRD7 mRNA expression in 5-8F cells. Therefore, the restoration of BRD7 induction by 5-Aza-CdR or TSA treatment could be related a direct demethylation of BRD7 promoter.

Sodium bisulfite deaminates unmethylated cytosine to uracil in single-stranded DNA under conditions in which the 5-methylcytosine remains nonreactive. Thus, all cytosine residues remaining at the time of sequencing represent cytosines that were methylated in the original DNA sequence. Genomic DNA from 5-8F cells treated with or without 3.75 muM of 5-Aza-CdR was analyzed. Sequencing analysis showed that the cytosines (labeled with *) at -374, -362, -352, -329, -226, -9, -5 bp were methylated in BRD7 promoter of 5-8F cells and were unmethylated in 5-8F cells treated with 3.75 muM of 5-Aza-CdR (Fig. 4B). Two "C" (labeled with *) at -260 and -170 bp appear. It could not be due to CpG methylation, possibly due to insufficient bisulfited treatment.

Cytosine methylation in the promoter region, when present within regulatory elements, could potentially interfere with binding of specific transcription factors to these motifs. Our previous studies confirmed that the MYC-MAX binding site at -260/-246 was non-specific [16]. To investigate whether cytosine methylation within Sp1 binding sites at -353/-337 and -330/-317 interfere with nuclear factor binding, we compared the binding abilities in EMSA reactions of a 20-bp oligomer (nucleotides -353/-337 and -330/-317), which contained the two different Sp1 elements and neighboring cytosines, in unmethylated and methylated forms. First we examined the abilities of unmethylated and methylated -353/-337 to compete with the unmethylated -353/-337 probe in binding to nuclear proteins from 5-8F cells. As seen in Fig. 5A, two sequence-specific gel shift complexes were observed with labeled unmethylated -353/-337 as a probe (lane 1 of Fig. 5), but no complex was formed with labeled methylated -353/-337 as a probe (lane 2 of Fig. 5). In competition EMSA reactions, 50-fold excess of unlabeled unmethylated -353/-337 oligomers were sufficient to completely inhibit complex formation (lane 3, 4 of Fig. 5), but none of the DNA-protein bands were inhibited by the addition of a 100-fold excess of unlabeled methylated -353/-337 oligomers (lane 5, 6 of Fig. 5), suggesting that the unmethylated -353/-337 oligomer binds activated protein. Then we compared the abilities of unmethylated and methylated -330/-317 oligomers to bind nuclear proteins from 5-8F cells in EMSA reactions using labeled unmethylated -330/-317 or methylated -330/-317 as probes. A strong and a weak DNA-protein complexes were formed with labeled unmethylated -330/-317 as probes (lane 7 of Fig. 5), whereas no DNA-protein complexes were formed with methylated -330/-317 as probes (lane 8 of Fig. 5). In the competition assay, both of them were completely inhibited with cold unmethylated -330/-317 (lane 9 of Fig. 5), but none of them were inhibited by cold methylated -330/-337 (lane 11, 12 of Fig. 5). These results suggested that methylation of cytosines at -353/-337 and -330/-317 significantly inhibited nuclear protein (possibly Sp1) binding to BRD7 promoter.

To investigate the effect of in vitro CpG methylation on BRD7 promoter activity, we treated BRD7 promoter reporter construct pGL3-404/+46, pGL3-404/+46/GFP with SssI methylase. After confirming the complete methylation status with restriction enzyme HpaII (Fig. 6A), Met-pGL3-404/+46, was transfected into COS7, BHK-21, HNE1, CNE1, 6-10B, 5-8F, SW480 and Hela cells. As shown in Fig. 6B, the luciferase activity driven by methylated BRD7 promoter was significantly decreased in all the detected cell lines. To further confirm the effects of methylation on promoter activity, methylated GFP reporter construct Met-pGL3-404/+46/GFP was transfected into 5-8F cells. It exhibited no GFP fluorescence in 5-8F cell lines (Fig. 6C). These results were consistent with that of the luciferase assay, indicating that DNA methylation of BRD7 promoter completely silenced its activity.

BRD7 is a recently identified bromodomain gene. It exhibits much higher-level of mRNA expression in normal nasopharyngeal epithelia than in NPC biopsies and cell lines [11,12]. Over-expression of BRD7 in NPC cells is effective in inhibiting cell growth and cell cycle progression of NPC cells [13-15], but little is known about its down-expression in NPC cells. In this study, we found that BRD7 promoter is hemimethylated in a number of NPC cell lines including HNE1, CNE1, 6-10B and 5-8F cell lines, and that the methylation status of BRD7 promoter is inversely proportional with BRD7 mRNA expression in NPC cells. Thus, pharmacological inhibition of DNA methylation by 5-Aza-CdR enhanced BRD7 mRNA expression in NPC cells. This is in agreement with previous studies that, indeed, hemimethylation is sufficient to inhibit the expression of p16ink4A [17] and hMLH1 gene [18] in HCT116 and HT29 cell lines, respectively. Numerous studies have suggested that DNA methylation can suppress gene transcription either by directly inhibiting the interaction of transcription factors with their regulatory sequences or by attracting methylated DNA binding proteins that, in turn, recruit histone deacetylases and histone methyltransferases, resulting in an inactive chromatin structure [19,20]. Our study indicates that DNA methylation represses BRD7 gene transcription by directly inhibiting the interaction of transcription factors with their regulatory elements, as judged by the inability of TSA to potentiate 5-Aza-CdR-mediated expression of BRD7 gene. Sp1 is a well-investigated factor that regulates transcription through specific sequences in G/C-rich promoter regions and is often critical for transcription initiation of TATA-less promoters [21]. We identified several Sp1 binding sites in BRD7 promoter. Sp1 has high affinity to BRD7 promoter [16]. Sequence analysis of the bisulfite-modified BRD7 promoter demonstrated that cytosine residues flanking functional Sp1 elements at -353/-337 and -330/-317 are methylated. It is known that methylation of specific cytosine residues in or near transcription regulatory motifs can block accessibility of the transcription factor [22-24]. Indeed, we found that methylation of cytosines flanking the -353/-337 and -330/-317 element impaired the ability of nuclear protein to bind the Sp1 binding sites in BRD7 promoter. Moreover, in vitro methylation of BRD7 promoter construct with SssI methylase leads to an almost complete loss of the activity of BRD7 promoter in NPC cell lines. NPC is highly radiosensitive and chemosensitive, but treatment of patients with locoregionally advanced disease remains problematic [25,26]. New biomarkers for NPC, including DNA copy number of EBV or methylation of multiple tumour suppressor genes, which can be detected in serum and nasopharyngeal brushings, have been developed for the molecular diagnosis of this tumor. Recent findings suggest that epigenetic inactivation of multiple tumor suppressor genes plays an important role in the tumourigenesis of NPC, such as aberrant methylation of the 5-CpG island of Ras association domain family 1A (RASSF1A), RARbeta2, death-associated protein kinase (DAP-kinase), p16 (CDKN2A), p15 (CDKN2B), p14 (ARF) and O6-methylguanine DNA methyltransferase (MGMT), DLC1, TSLC1, TIG1 in NPC [27-33]. In the present study, among the 18 NPC patients, aberrant promoter methylation of BRD7 gene was detected in 100% of tumor biopsies and matched blood samples of NPC patients. In contrast, weak promoter methylation of BRD7 gene was observed in half of the blood samples from normal, healthy, age-matched individuals, indicating that epigenetic inactivation of BRD7 gene plays an important role in the tumorigenesis of NPC. This is a provocative observation, suggesting that the methylation status of BRD7 promoter may serve as a clinical biomarker for early detection and prescreening patients with clinical symptoms or individuals at high risk as well as in monitoring patients for recurrence. Further studies are necessary to confirm this.
