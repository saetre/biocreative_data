Mammalian cardiac muscle contains two myosin alkali light chains: 1) the atrial light chain (MLC1A), and 2) the ventricular light chain (MLC1V) predominantly expressed either in the atrium or in the ventricle. In this report we describe the isolation and characterization of the complete gene for rat MLC1V. The rat MLC1V gene is approximately 6.5 kb long and the mRNA coding sequences are organized in 7 different exons. Comparison of this gene sequence with other known MLC1 gene sequences revealed that the exon-intron organization is highly conserved within the MLC1 gene family. The derived protein sequence of rat MLC1V showed a higher sequence homology with human ventricular (96%) MLC1V than with rat fast skeletal MLC1f (74%), suggesting functional similarities between different MLC1V proteins. S1 nuclease mapping and primer extension analysis demonstrated that this gene is expressed only in ventricular and slow twitch skeletal muscle tissues and is transcribed from the same promoter and transcription initiation site.
