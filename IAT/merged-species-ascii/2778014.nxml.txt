The pathogenesis of deep venous thrombosis (DVT) involves an interaction between hereditary and acquired factors. Prothrombin gene mutation is one of the hereditary risk factors. We evaluated the frequency of the prothrombin gene mutation in patients with DVT and its relation to oral warfarin anticoagulant therapy response.

Prothrombin gene mutation was looked for in 40 DVT patients with poor response to warfarin. The results were compared with 40 DVT patients with a normal response to warfarin and 30 healthy blood donors. Blood samples were also assessed for protein C, protein S, anti-thrombin III and anticardiolipin antibodies (ACA) levels.

Prothrombin gene mutation was found in normal and poor DVT responders (6/40 and 13/40, respectively; p = NS) as well as in healthy controls (1/30). Patients with recurrent DVT or a family history of DVT were significantly (p<0.0001) more likely to have the prothrombin mutation than other DVT patients. Non prothrombin abnormalities (protein C, anti-thrombin III and ACA) were more common in poor responders than controls (p<0.0037) as were ACA (p<0.034).

The pathogenesis of DVT involves an interaction between hereditary and acquired conditions [2-4]. Generally, DVT occurring in the setting of a recognized risk factor is defined as secondary, whereas that occurring in the absence of risk factors is termed primary or idiopathic [5].

In primary DVT, tendency toward venous thrombosis could arise from hyperactive coagulation pathway, hypoactive anticoagulant mechanisms, or hypoactive fibrinolysis [2, 6]. With the identification of the well-characterized risk factors associated with secondary DVT, there is increasing interest in the laboratory identification of primary thrombotic risk factors. Identification of these risk factors may affect treatment and identify other affected family members before the onset of symptoms. This could justify the use of prophylactic anticoagulant therapy during high-risk periods [7].

Over the past few years, studies have focused on the role of mutations in genes that encode proteins involving thrombosis pathways. Prothrombin (factor II) is one of these proteins. It is the precursor of the serine protease thrombin, a key enzyme acting as a procoagulant, through platelet activation and the generation of fibrin and factors Va, VIIIa, and XIIIa, and subsequently as an anticoagulant, by activating circulating protein C [2, 6]. Therefore, regulation of thrombin activity is crucial for maintaining hemostatic balance [7]. The gene encoding prothrombin is 21-kb-long located on chromosome 11, position 11p11-q12 [8, 9]. The prothrombin gene is organized in 14 exons, separated by 13 introns with the 5' upstream untranslated (UT) region and the 3'- UT region which may play regulatory roles in gene expression [6, 10]. One genetic variation in the 3'-UT region of the prothrombin gene is the G to A transition at nucleotide position 20210, at or near the cleavage site of the mRNA precursor to which poly A is added [8]. This is termed as the factor II G 20210 A mutation.

In 1996, Poort et al. reported that the factor II G20210A mutation is associated with an increased risk of venous thrombosis [6]. Several studies confirmed this initial observation [10, 11].

The prevalence of carriers of factor II G20210A mutation in healthy Northern Europeans is 1.7% whereas in Southern Europeans the prevalence is nearly double (3%) [12]. In contrast, factor II G20210A mutation was found in only 1 of 441 African Americans [13] and was completely absent among 231 Amerindians from Brazil and 210 Japanese subjects [11, 14]. Patients with this heterozygous gene mutation have increased prothrombin levels and therefore, a thrombotic tendency [2].

The study population was divided into 2 groups: the first group was the Poor Responders, defined as the DVT patients who fail to reach the intended level of INR with the usual dose of warfarin (usually 1 - <9 mg/day), those patients usually require more than 9 mg/day to reach the therapeutic INR level [15-19]; we recruited 40 patients during the study period. This first group was compared with a second group of 40 randomly selected DVT Normal Responders, defined as those who reached an INR between 2 and 3. In addition, a control group of 30 healthy blood donors living in the same area were randomly selected; none of them had a previous history of DVT.

Detection was done by real-time PCR assay [20] using the LightCycler prothrombin G20210A mutation detection kit (Roche Molecular Biochemicals, Catalog No. 2 236 842) [21]. The 165 bp fragment of prothrombin gene is monitored by adjacent hybridization probes that are designed to bind on 1 amplicon strand. The 3' end of 1 probe is labeled with fluorescein (FLU), whereas the 5' end of an adjacent probe is labeled with LightCycler-Red640 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) as the anchor probe. When both probes hybridize in close proximity, only after hybridization to the template DNA, fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) occurs, producing a specific fluorescence emission of LC-Red as a result of FLU excitation. Increasing the temperature during fluorescence reading yields a temperature/fluorescence curve from which the melting point of the probe can be derived. When the appropriate conditions are chosen, the mismatch under the detection probe caused by a single point mutation leads to a substantial decrease in the melting point of the probe [16]. DNA was isolated from 200 microL of EDTA-treated blood with the QIAamp DNA Mini Kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The DNA was eluted in 200 microL of elution buffer and stored at -20 degreesC. PCR reactions were performed in a final volume of 20 microL in the LightCycler glass capillaries, which contained 2 microL of 1x Light Cycler prothrombin G20210A mutation detection mix, 2microL of 1x Light Cycler prothrombin G20210A mutation reaction mix, and 5 microL of DNA solution. PCR-grade water was added to a final volume of 20 microL. Each run included a positive control, which is heterozygous DNA control, and negative control, which is PCR-grade water.

On treating patients with acute DVT, we faced patients who did not show the usual elevation of PT/INR in response to usual doses of warfarin. This may reflect an elevated prothrombin level due to a genetic mutation [19]. This mutation may, not only, cause the low response to oral anticoagulant, but may also contribute to the recent and future episodes of DVT [2]. Patients with this gene mutation may need higher doses of warfarin (to reach INR target levels) for longer periods [15, 22].

In the present study, analysis of risk factors showed that recurrent DVT was numerically higher but not significant in the poor responders than for the normal responders. Family history was also higher in the poor responders, but not significantly so. This may reflect the presence of a specific risk factor for DVT in the poor responders group. The rest of the risk factors showed similarity with no significant differences between the poor and normal responders. This agrees with the fact that these are recognised risk factors that may cause DVT in all patients. It also suggests that multiple risk factors might be necessary before clinically evident DVT develops even in patients with thrombotic gene mutation [23].

We detected the factor II G20210A mutation in 20 individuals in our study population (n=110). Homozygous mutation was found in only 1 patient in the poor responders group, while heterozygous mutation was found in the 3 groups. The gene mutation was recognized in 1(3.4%) of the normal population, which agrees with others who found this mutation in 1%, 1.7% and 3% of the normal Pakistan, Northern and Southern European population, respectively [11, 12, 24]. However, our finding only represents the 30 studied healthy blood donors. Larger studies are needed to define the exact prevalence in our community.

Heterozygous gene mutation was found in 30% of the poor responders and 15% of the normal responders. This supports the concept that factor II G20210A mutation may cause high prothrombin levels [6] which may, in turn, be responsible for resisting oral anticoagulants. The presence of the same mutation in some normal responders may be explained by the presence of different degrees of mutation that did not clinically affect the prothrombin levels. This gene mutation with less clinical significance was previously suggested [25].

Our findings agree with previous reports that suggested 3 to 6 fold higher risk of developing DVT in prothrombin gene mutation patients than the normal population [2, 9]. This also points to the importance of screening the patient's family as they may be at increased risk of developing DVT. However, the interpretation of our results is limited by the small sample size and selection bias.

Protein C, anti-thrombin III and ACA abnormalities were found in more poor responders DVT patients than controls. Bernd et al. [26] suggested that special caution is needed when giving anticoagulants to patients with protein C deficiency. Because protein C is a vitamin K dependent factor, the administration of warfarin could lead to sudden decrease in protein C before any noticeable decrease in coagulation factors. This could cause enhanced thrombosis and diffuse skin necrosis. Also, ACA was significantly more common in poor responders than control subjects. It has also been suggested that patients with ACA and venous thromboembolism are resistant to usual intensities of warfarin therapy, which may prompt more intense anticoagulation of these patients. However, no substantial difference was seen between the ACA-positive and ACA-negative patients, for several thromboplastins [27].

To add to the dilemma of DVT and genetic disorders, pharmacogenetic studies should be ideally be carried out in DVT patients before warfarin anticoagulant therapy as Leung et al. 2007 [28] reported that patients with Cytochrome P-450 CYP2C9*2, CYP2C9*3, or VKORC1*2 genotype (c.-1639G>A) in presence of Factor V Leiden and/or factor II G20210A mutation require significantly reduced doses, and are at a higher risk of serious bleeding.

In conclusion, our findings suggest that factor II G20210A mutation may be more common in DVT patients who are poor responders to warfarin. Factor II G20210A mutation was more common in patients with recurrent DVT or positive family history of DVT.
