Nuclear (UNG2) and mitochondrial (UNG1) forms of human uracil-DNA glycosylase are both encoded by the UNG gene but have different N-terminal sequences. We have expressed fusion constructs of truncated or site-mutated UNG cDNAs and green fluorescent protein cDNA and studied subcellular sorting. The unique 44 N-terminal amino acids in UNG2 are required, but not sufficient, for complete sorting to nuclei. In this part the motif R17K18R19is essential for sorting. The complete nuclear localization signal (NLS) in addition requires residues common to UNG2 and UNG1 within the 151 N-terminal residues. Replacement of certain basic residues within this region changed the pattern of subnuclear distribution of UNG2. The 35 unique N-terminal residues in UNG1 constitute a strong and complete mitochondrial localization signal (MLS) which when placed at the N-terminus of UNG2 overrides the NLS. Residues 11-28 in UNG1 have the potential of forming an amphiphilic helix typical of MLSs and residues 1-28 are essential and sufficient for mitochondrial import. These results demonstrate that UNG1 contains a classical and very strong MLS, whereas UNG2 contains an unusually long and complex NLS, as well as subnuclear targeting signals in the region common to UNG2 and UNG1.
