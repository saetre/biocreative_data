Mutant AraC proteins were selected for their ability to induce but not to repress, or their ability to repress but not to induce the araBAD operon. One such unusual mutant is able to bind to the araI site with an affinity only two to three-fold weaker than the wild type AraC protein, but the mutant protein was shown, both in crude extracts and when purified, to contact only two of the three major groove regions of the DNA that are contacted by the wild type protein.
