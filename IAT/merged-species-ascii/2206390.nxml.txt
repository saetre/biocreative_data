It has been suggested that taurine chloramine (TauCl) plays an important role in the downregulation of proinflammatory mediators. However, little is known about its effect on the expression of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs). In this study, we investigated the effects of TauCl on synovial expression of MMPs. The effects of TauCl on MMP expression in IL-1beta stimulated fibroblast-like synoviocytes (FLSs) were studied using the following techniques. Real-time PCR and semi-quantitative PCR were employed to analyze the mRNA expression of MMPs. ELISA was used to determine protein levels of MMPs. Western blot analyses were performed to analyze the mitogen-activated protein kinase and inhibitor of nuclear factor-kappaB (IkappaB) kinase signalling pathways. Finally, electrophoretic mobility shift assay and immunohistochemistry were used to assess localization of transcription factors. IL-1beta increased the transcriptional and translational levels of MMP-1 and MMP-13 in rheumatoid arthritis FLSs, whereas the levels of MMP-2 and MMP-9 were unaffected. TauCl at a concentration of 400 to 600 mumol/l greatly inhibited the transcriptional and translational expression of MMP-13, but the expression of MMP-1 was significantly inhibited at 800 mumol/l. At a concentration of 600 mumol/l, TauCl did not significantly inhibit phosphorylation of mitogen-activated protein kinase or IkappaB degradation in IL-1beta stimulated rheumatoid arthritis FLSs. The degradation of IkappaB was significantly inhibited at a TauCl concentration of 800 mumol/l. The inhibitory effect of TauCl on IkappaB degradation was confirmed by electrophoretic mobility shift assay and immunochemical staining for localization of nuclear factor-kappaB. TauCl differentially inhibits the expression of MMP-1 and MMP-13, and inhibits expression of MMP-1 primarily through the inhibition of IkappaB degradation, whereas it inhibits expression of MMP-13 through signalling pathways other than the IkappaB pathway.

The characteristics of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) include chronic proliferative synovitis, infiltration of inflammatory immune cell types into the synovial fluid of joints, and cartilage destruction. Proliferative fibroblast-like synoviocytes (FLSs) play crucial roles in both joint damage and propagation of inflammation because they produce many mediators of inflammation and matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), which contribute to cartilage degradation in joints [1]. Immune cells recruited into joint cavities by FLSs also contribute to progressive destruction of cartilage in distal joints [2]. Among the range of detrimental immune cells that are present in RA joints, neutrophils have been a primary focus of research in RA because of their number and function [3-7]. Once activated, neutrophils secrete various mediators, including MMPs and, in particular, the reactive oxygen intermediates nitric oxide and hypochlorous acid (HOCl) [8,9]. Thus, neutrophils play an important role in the pathogenesis of RA [9].

However, neutrophils also appear to possess homeostatic mechanisms that can reduce the inflammatory response. Activated neutrophils contain substantial quantities of taurine, which is one of the most abundant free intracellular amino acids present in mammalian tissues and blood cells [10,11]. Taurine acts as a scavenger of HOCl, which is produced by the myeloperoxidase/hydrogen peroxide/chloride system of activated neutrophils and monocytes [12]. It reacts with HOCl to form taurine chloramine (TauCl). Notably, TauCl has been shown to play a major role in downregulating the expression of inflammatory mediators such as chemokines, cytokines, cyclo-oxygenase-2 and inducible nitric oxide synthase in various types of cells [13-18]. Such inhibitory effects have also been demonstrated in animal models of arthritis [19,20]. These inhibitory effects may stem from the suppressive effects of TauCl on expression of proinflammatory mediators (prostaglandin E2, nitric oxide, and cytokines) and bone erosion related enzymes, such as MMPs.

MMPs, which are primarily produced in fibroblast-like synoviocytes (FLSs) in RA, are proteases that participate in irreparable proteolytic degradation and in the remodelling of the extracellular matrix. MMPs can be classified into five main groups, according to their substrate specificities, primary structures and cellular localizations [21]: collagenases (MMP-1, MMP-8 and MMP-13), gelatinases (MMP-2 and MMP-9), stromelysins (MMP-3 and MMP-10), matrilysins (MMP-7 and MMP-26) and membrane-bound membrane-type MMPs (MMP-14, MMP-15, MMP-16, MMP-17, MMP-24 and MMP-25). The MMP-1 and MMP-13 collagenases play dominant roles in RA and osteoarthritis because they are rate-limiting components of the collagen degradation process [22,23]. In particular, MMP-13 is a potent protease that is capable of degrading a wide range of collagenous and noncollagenous extracellular matrix macromolecules [24,25]. MMP-13 is remarkably active against collagen type II, which is the predominant collagen in cartilage [26]. To date, investigations of TauCl have focused on its inhibitory effects on the expression of proinflammatory mediators. However, despite the important roles played by MMPs in cartilage erosion, the effects of TauCl on expression of MMPs are not well understood. In this report we show that TauCl inhibits the increased expression of the MMP-1 and MMP-13 genes in IL-1beta stimulated RA FLSs.

After obtaining informed consent, synovial tissues were collected from RA patients who met the 1987 American College of Rheumatology criteria for the diagnosis of RA and who were undergoing therapeutic joint surgery. FLSs were isolated as follows. Tissues were digested with gentle shaking in 20 ml RPMI 1640 (Gibco-BRL, Grand Island, NY, USA) containing 1 mg/ml collagenase (Gibco-BRL) at 37degreesC for 90 min, filtered through a 70 mum cell strainer and cultured in 75 cm2 culture flasks with Dulbecco's modified essential medium (Gibco-BRL) supplemented with 20% (vol/vol) foetal bovine serum (Gibco-BRL) and 1x antibiotic-antimycotic (Gibco-BRL). After the cells had grown to confluence, they were detached with 0.25% trypsin (Gibco-BRL) and split at a 1:4 ratio. FLS passages three to six were used for all experiments. Visual examination of cell morphology under light microscopy and fluorescence activated cell sorting analysis of cells stained with anti-CD11b antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA, USA) confirmed that FLSs accounted for more than 95% of the cells.

TauCl was synthesized by mixing equimolar amounts of sodium hypochlorite (Aldrich Chemical, Milwaukee, MI, USA) and taurine (Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA). TauCl formation was verified by UV absorption (200 to 400 nM) [27]. Endotoxin-free or low-endotoxin grade water and buffers were used. Stock solutions of taurine and TauCl were kept at 4degreesC and used within 3 days.

TRIzol(R) reagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) was used to extract total RNA from arthritic FLSs (2.5 x 105 cells/60-mm dish/2 ml serum-free media) that had been starved in serum-free media overnight and treated with IL-1beta for 6 hours in the presence or absence of TauCl. Complementary DNA was synthesized from 1 mug total RNA in 20 mul reverse transcription reaction mixture containing 5 mmol/l MgCl2, 1x RT buffer, 1 mmol/l dNTP, 1 U/mul RNase inhibitor, 0.25 U/mul AMV reverse transcriptase, and 2.5 mumol/l random 9-mers. For semi-quantitative PCR, aliquots of cDNA were amplified with the primers in a 25 mul PCR mixture containing 1x PCR buffer, 0.625 units of TaKaRa Ex Taqtrade mark HS, and 0.2 mumol/l of specific upstream primers, in accordance with the manufacturer's protocol (TaKaRa Bio, Kyoto, Japan). The PCR conditions for the MMPs were as follows: 30 to 33 cycles at 95degreesC for 45 s, 55 to 60degreesC for 45 s, and 72degreesC for 45 s. PCR products were subjected to electrophoresis in 1.5% agarose gels containing ethidium bromide, and the bands were visualized under UV light. The primers were synthesized by Bioneer Co. Ltd (Seoul, Republic of Korea), and their sequences are listed in Table 1.

For real-time quantitative PCR analysis, the reaction was carried out using the LightCycler PCR system (Roche Diagnostics, Meylan, France), with the DNA-binding SYBR Green I dye used to detect the PCR products. A serial dilution was used to generate each standard curve. Each 20 mul reaction mixture contained 1x LightCycler-DNA Master SYBR Green I, a specific primer, along with 2 mul cDNA. After 2 min denaturation at 95degreesC, the MMPs and beta-actin underwent 40 reaction cycles at 95degreesC for 5 s, 55 to 60degreesC for 10 s (annealing) and 72degreesC for 13 s. Product specificity was determined by melting curve analysis, as described in the LightCycler manual. The results are expressed as ratios of MMP transcripts to beta-actin transcripts, with the quantity of transcripts in each sample expressed as a copy number. The ratio of MMP/beta-actin mRNA was assigned a value of 100%, with the corresponding results calculated as relative percentages.

FLSs (5 x 105 cells) cultured in 60-mm dishes were serum starved overnight and stimulated by IL-1beta (10 ng/ml) for 10 or 30 min in the presence or absence of TauCl. The cells were subsequently washed twice in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and treated with 50 mul lysis buffer (20 mmol/l Tris-Cl [pH 8.0], 150 mmol/l NaCl, 1 mmol/l EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 20 mug/ml chymostatin, 2 mmol/l phenylmethylsuphonyl fluoride [PMSF], 10 mumol/l leupeptin, and 1 mmol/l 4-[2-aminoethyl]benzenesulfonyl fluoride). Cells were scraped using a rubber policeman before addition of another 50 mul lysis buffer. The cells were transferred to a microcentrifuge tube, incubated on ice for 30 min with occasional agitation every 5 min and centrifuged for 15 min at 12,000 rpm (16,090 g), and the supernatant was then analyzed for protein concentration using the Bio-Rad Protein Assay Kit (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA). Thirty micrograms of cytoplasmic protein extract were then boiled in 5x Laemmli sample buffer for 5 min. The samples were separated by 12% SDS-PAGE and transferred to a Hybond-ECL membrane (Amersham, Arlington Heights, IL, USA). The membranes were blocked with 6% nonfat milk dissolved in TBST buffer (10 mmol/l Tris-Cl [pH 8.0], 150 mmol/l NaCl, 0.05% Tween 20). The blots were probed with various rabbit polyclonal antibodies for phosphorylated extracellular signal regulated kinase-1/2 (phospho-ERK-1/2), phospharylated p38 (phospho-p38), phospharylated c-jun amino-terminal kinase (phospho-JNK), and inhibitor of nuclear factor-kappaB (IkappaB)alpha (Cell Signaling Technology, Beverly, MA, USA) diluted 1:1000 in Tris-buffered saline for 2 hours and incubated with 1:1000 dilutions of goat anti-rabbit IgG secondary antibody, coupled with horseradish peroxidase. The blots were developed using the ECL method (Amersham). For re-probing, the blots were incubated in the stripping buffer (100 mmol/l 2-mercaptoethanol, 2% SDS, 62.5 mmol/l Tris-HCl [pH 6.7]) at 50degreesC for 30 min with occasional agitation.

In brief, 10 mug nuclear protein was incubated with 0.25 mug of poly(dI-dC) (Amersham) and 32P-labelled DNA probe (5,000 counts per minute) in binding buffer (10 mmol/l Tris-HCl [pH 7.5], 50 mmol/l NaCl, 1 mmol/l MgCl2, 0.5 mmol/l EDTA, 5% glycerol and 0.5 mmol/l DTT) for 30 min at 30degreesC. The protein-DNA complexes were then analyzed on 5% native polyacrylamide gels. For the supershift experiment, antibodies were included in the above reaction mixture and incubated at 4degreesC for 3 hours before the addition of the 32P-labelled DNA probe. The oligonucleotide sequences used to detect NF-kappaB activity were as follows: 5'-AGT TGA GGG GAC TTT CCC AGG-3' (sense) and 5'-GCC TGG GAA AGT CCC CTC AAC T-3' (antisense).

FLSs were cultured at 4 x 104 cells/well in four-well Lab-Tek chamber slides (Falcon; Becton Dickinson Labware, Oxnard, CA, USA) in order to visualize the translocation of NF-kappaB to the nucleus under IL-1beta stimulation. After serum starvation overnight, the cells were stimulated with IL-1beta at 10 ng/ml for 90 min, washed with cold PBS, and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 20 min. Cells were permeabilized with PBS and 0.5% Triton X-100 in PBS for 10 min, and were then incubated for 30 min with the blocking buffer, 5% goat serum, in order to prevent nonspecific binding. The cells were incubated with 5 mug/ml rabbit polyclonal anti-NF-kappaB p65 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) overnight, followed by incubation with 20 mug/ml cyan3-conjugated goat anti-rabbit antibody for 60 min at room temperature. After washing, the cells were counterstained with 0.1 mg/ml DAPI for 30 min at room temperature. The coverslips were fixed with mounting media (DakoCytomation, Carpinteria, CA, USA), and the slides were visualized using confocal microscopy (Carl Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany).

The stimulation of arthritic FLSs using IL-1beta greatly upregulated the expressions of the MMP-1 and MMP-13 collagenases, as determined by ELISA (Figure 1a), real time PCR (Figure 1b) and semi-quantitative RNA analysis (Figure 1c). However, the expressions of the gelatinases MMP-2 and MMP-9 remained unchanged (Figure 1). MMP-2 and MMP-9 remained unchanged at the mRNA level, even after 24 hours of stimulation, which indicates that IL-1beta did not stimulate MMP-2 and MMP-9 (data not shown). Consistent with the mRNA levels of MMP-1 and MMP-13, ELISA analyses of culture supernatants at 24 hours revealed that IL-1beta upregulated the expressions of MMP-1 and MMP-13 at the protein level by about 30-fold and 15-fold, respectively (Figure 1a). The protein levels of the MMP-2 remained unchanged, whereas the protein levels of the MMP-9 genes were below the ELISA detection limit (data not shown).

TauCl differentially inhibits the expression of MMPs in IL-beta-stimulated RA FLSs. The expressions of the collagenases (matrix metalloproteinase [MMP]-1 and MMP-13) and the gelatinases (MMP-2 and MMP-9) were determined by (a) ELISA analysis, (b) real time PCR and (c) semi-quantitative RNA analysis. Synovial cells (5 x 105 cells/60 mm dish/2 ml serum-free media) were treated with taurine chloramine (TauCl) 30 min before 24 hours of IL-1beta (10 ng/ml) stimulation for MMP protein analysis by ELISA. Cells (2.5 x 105 cells/60 mm dish/2 ml serum-free media) were treated with TauCl 30 min before 6 hours of stimulation with IL-1beta (10 ng/ml) for RNA level analysis. IL-1beta stimulated the expression of the MMP-1 and MMP-13 genes, but it did not affect the expression of MMP-2 or MMP-9. TauCl differentially inhibited the expressions of MMP-1 and MMP-13. Experiments were performed in duplicate with cells from three patients. Values are expressed as means +/- standard deviation. *P < 0.01 versus control group (no IL-1beta); #P < 0.05 and ##P < 0.01 versus IL-1beta treatment group without TauCl.

To identify whether TauCl inhibits the expression of MMPs, FLSs were treated with TauCl 30 min before 24 hours or 6 hours of IL-1beta stimulation for protein analysis and RNA analysis, respectively. Treatment with TauCl at concentrations of 400 and 600 mumol/l differentially inhibited the expressions of MMP-1 and MMP-13. The expression of MMP-1 remained unchanged at TauCl 400 and 600 mumol/l, whereas MMP-13 levels were reduced to about 50% or 20% of that observed in the IL-1beta treated group (with no TauCl treatment), respectively (Figure 1a). However, at a TauCl concentration of 800 mumol/l, the protein expressions of MMP-1 and MMP-13 diminished to 50% and 10%, respectively.

Consistent with the effects of TauCl on the protein levels of MMP-1 and MMP-13, RNA analyses revealed that the levels of MMP-13 were more sensitive to TauCl at a concentration of 600 mumol/l than were the levels of MMP-1. At a TauCl concentration of 800 mumol/l, the transcriptional expressions of the MMP-1 and MMP-13 genes diminished to 20% and 5%, respectively (Figure 1b,c).

IL-1beta stimulates the signal transduction pathways of both mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and IkappaB kinase in chondrocytes and astrocytes [28,29]. To identify the pathways that are involved in enhancing MMP-1 and MMP-13 expression under IL-1beta stimulation, the levels of phospho-ERK-1/2, phospho-JNK, phospho-p38MAPK and IkappaBalpha were measured according to the duration of stimulation. IL-1beta treatment led to remarkable increases in the phosphorylation of ERK-1/2 and p38MAPK by 10 min, and the increased levels were maintained for 45 min. The level of phospho-JNK peaked at 30 min. IkappaBalpha was completely degraded at 30 min but recovered by 60 min, which indicates that IkappaBalpha was fully phosphorylated within 30 min of activation of IL-1beta (Figure 2a).

A TauCl concentration of 800 mumol/l significantly inhibited the inhibitor of nuclear factor-kappaB (IkappaB)/nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) signalling pathway by inhibiting the degradation of IkappaBalpha. The mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signalling pathway, including extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)-1/2, p38 and c-jun amino-terminal kinase (JNK), was unaffected.

We investigated the level of MAPK phosphorylation in an effort to clarify the inhibitory mechanism of TauCl on MMPs. As shown in Figure 2b, TauCl did not significantly inhibit the phosphorylation of ERK-1/2, p38, or JNK, even when the highest test concentration of 800 mumol/l was used. At 800 mumol/l, TauCl strongly blocked the IkappaB degradation that normally occurs upon IL-1beta stimulation, which suggests that TauCl prevents NF-kappaB from migrating to the nucleus by inhibiting the degradation of IkappaB. The effectiveness of TauCl as an inhibitor of IkappaB was investigated by comparing it with MG132, which is an NF-kappaB inhibitor that slows IkappaB degradation by deactivating the proteasome [30]. TauCl inhibited IkappaB degradation as potently as MG132, in this instance; however, the concentration of TauCl employed was greater than that of MG132 (Figure 3).

To further demonstrate that the effects of IkappaB degradation extended to the transnuclear migration of NF-kappaB, levels of NF-kappaB in the nucleus were assessed using EMSA (Figure 4) and immunohistochemistry (Figure 5). As shown in Figure 4, at a concentration of 800 mumol/l, TauCl completely blocked the nuclear binding of NF-kappaB; however, at 600 alphamol/l, TauCl did not block binding activity. These results were confirmed by confocal microscopy. After 90 min of IL-1beta stimulation, the majority of cytoplasmic NF-kappaB migrated into the nucleus, as indicated by strong nuclear NF-kappaB staining following stimulation and strong cytoplasmic staining before stimulation (Figure 5). Confirming previous findings, the migration of NF-kappaB into the nucleus was not inhibited at TauCl concentrations of up to 600 mumol/l. However, at a concentration of 800 mumol/l, TauCl blocked the transnuclear migration of NF-kappaB.

After serum starvation overnight, the cells were treated with taurine chloramine (TauCl) 30 min before stimulation with IL-1beta (10 ng/ml) for 90 min. IL-1beta stimulation induced the migration of NF-kappaB from the cytoplasm into the nucleus (second column), whereas NF-kappaB was found only in the cytoplasm of nonstimulated cells (first column). At a concentration of 800 mumol/l, TauCl completely inhibited the migration of NF-kappaB into the nucleus (fifth column). All pictures were taken at a magnification of 200x.

Because IL-1beta is believed to play a major role in synovial inflammation, RA FLSs stimulated with IL-1beta in vitro have been used to mimic the synovial proliferation that occurs in RA patients suffering from inflammation [31]. IL-1beta is also known to stimulate many proinflammatory mediators in a variety of cell types [32]. In addition, IL-1beta is a potent inducer of metalloproteinase production by FLSs; however, little investigation has been conducted to determine its effects on the gelatinases (MMP-2 and MMP-9) [33]. In the present study, we found that IL-1beta strongly stimulated the expression of collagenases (MMP-1 and MMP-13). Gelatinase expression was weakly activated by IL-1beta stimulation. However, IL-1beta is known to induce high levels of gelatinase expression in other cell types [34-36].

IL-1beta activates different signalling pathways in different cell types. Thus, we investigated signalling pathways in IL-1beta stimulated RA FLSs [37]. IL-1beta stimulated the pathways of both MAPK (ERK, p38 and JNK) and IkappaB kinase within 30 min, with pathway activation subsiding to the basal levels of nonstimulated cells by 60 min. The activation of these pathways led to the activation of a number of transcriptional factors that enhance the expression of various proinflammatory mediators. Among these factors, NF-kappaB is a key regulator of inflammatory gene transcription, and it is known to be activated in RA synovia and chondrocytes [38].

TauCl differentially inhibited the expression of MMPs in IL-1beta stimulated RA FLSs. The expression of MMP-13 was significantly inhibited at concentrations of 400 to 600 mumol/l TauCl, whereas the expression of MMP-1 was not significantly inhibited at this concentration. To clarify the inhibitory mechanism of TauCl on MMPs, the levels of both MAPK phosphorylation and IkappaB degradation were investigated in IL-1beta stimulated RA FLSs. TauCl did not significantly inhibit the phosphorylation of ERK-1/2, p38, or JNK, even at 800 mumol/l, whereas IkappaB degradation was significantly inhibited at 800 mumol/l. These findings indicate that the inhibition of the IkappaB signalling pathways by TauCl was primarily dependent on the inhibition of IkappaB degradation. This finding is consistent with previous reports showing that TauCl modifies the backbone of IkappaB through amino acid oxidation of IkappaB, thus allowing IkappaB to become resistant to degradation [39,40]. Confocal microscopic examination of the NF-kappaB immunostaining results indicated that a TauCl concentration of 800 mumol/l was required to inhibit IkappaB degradation completely. Partial inhibition of IkappaB degradation was seen at a TauCl concentration of 600 mumol/l, as reflected by NF-kappaB immunostaining in both the cytoplasm and the nucleus. This may indicate that signalling pathways other than the MAPK and IkappaB pathways are involved in the stimulation of MMP-1 and MMP-13. In support of this idea, protein kinase Cdelta is known to play a key role in the stimulation of MMP-13 via crosstalk with MAPKs in basic fibroblast growth factor stimulated human adult articular chondrocytes [41]. At concentrations lower than 800 mumol/l, TauCl may inhibit or block minor pathways that are involved in the upregulation of MMP-1 and MMP-13. At a critical concentration (600 to 800 mumol/l), IkappaBalpha degradation is completely inhibited, thereby preventing the migration of NF-kappaB into the nucleus.

TauCl is less toxic than its precursor HOCl/OCl-, but cytotoxic effects of TauCl at high concentrations have been reported. Its toxicity appears to differ between cell types [42]. Kontny and coworkers [43] reported that TauCl caused progressive necrosis of RA FLSs at concentrations of 500 mumol/l or greater. In our study, the RA FLSs used in the experiments were not significantly affected by a TauCl concentration of 800 mumol/l for 24 hours, even though cytotoxicity was detected in RA FLSs from some patients (Figure 6). TauCl toxicity appeared to vary between individual RA patients. In addition, different cell passages might have contributed to the variance in sensitivity to TauCl, because RA FLSs exhibit different characteristics according to passage [44,45]. Although it remains uncertain whether the TauCl concentration used in this experiment can be a physiologic concentration, TauCl may remain at a high concentration in extracellular fluids because the intracellular and extracellular concentrations of taurine in mammalian tissues are 10 to 70 mmol/l and 20 to 100 mumol/l, respectively [46].

The differential effects of TauCl on the expressions of MMP-1 and MMP-13 may also be related to other transcription factors that are differentially involved in the activations of MMP-1 and MMP-13. For example, Runxa2 was found to stimulate strongly the transcriptional activation of MMP-13, but it had no effect on MMP-1 expression in human chondrosarcoma cells [47]. In addition, many transcriptional binding sites, such as activator protein-1 and Ets/polymavirus enhancer 3 (OSE-2), have been identified in the human MMP-13 proximal promoter [48-50]. An AG-rich element regulatory site was recently found in the human MMP-13 proximal promoter [51]. This and other transcription factors may contribute to the increased expression of MMP-13 in IL-1beta stimulated FLSs. The interaction of TauCl with these as yet unidentified factors remains unknown. Furthermore, these transcription factors may function at a TauCl concentration that inhibits the degradation of IkappaB.

The degree of the inhibitory effect of TauCl was compared with that of an NF-kappaB inhibitor, namely MG132. At a concentration of 800 mumol/l, the inhibitory effect of TauCl on IkappaB degradation was as potent as that of 1 mumol/l MG132. Because MMP-13 exhibits the greatest activity toward the degradation of type II collagen, a major component of the cartilage extracellular matrix, the control of MMP-13 expression is crucial when attempting to delay the degradation of cartilage [26]. At lower concentrations of TauCl, inhibition of MMP-13 expression would be a potentially effective strategy to control the destruction of joint cartilage in RA and osteoarthritis. Above all, TauCl may be produced as a part of the homeostatic response to infection and inflammation, thus playing a critical role in limiting the duration and intensity of immune inflammation [52]. In support of this hypothesis, synovial fluid neutrophils of RA patients exhibit impaired generation of TauCl [53].

In summary, TauCl differentially inhibited the increased expression levels of MMP-1 and MMP-13 in IL-1beta stimulated RA FLSs. It inhibited the expression of MMP-1 primarily through inhibition of IkappaB degradation, although it did not appear to inhibit the expression of MMP-13 through inhibition of the IkappaB signalling pathway.

Given that MMP-13, which is inhibited by TauCl, is remarkably active against collagen type II, and that synovial fluid neutrophils of RA patients exhibit impaired generation of TauCl, the involvement of TauCl in destruction of joint cartilage should receive greater focus. This may yield insights into the molecular mechanisms of joint destruction in RA.
