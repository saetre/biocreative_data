We have determined the sequence of ovalbumin RNA (ov-mRNA) using a double-stranded cDNA (dscDNA) plasmid. We have also determined the sequence of the previously characterized exonic regions of the chicken ovalbumin gene. The comparison of these various sequences has shown that there are no additional interruptions in the mRNA-coding sequences above those 7 already characterized. There is only one single base discrepancy between the two mRNA sequences determined using the dscDNA or the genomic clones. This demonstrates the accuracy and reproducibility of the cloning and sequencing techniques. The ovalbumin mRNA sequence was found to be 1872 nucleotides in length, 13 nucleotides larger than the previous value reported by McReynolds et al. [Nature 273, 723-728 (1978)].
