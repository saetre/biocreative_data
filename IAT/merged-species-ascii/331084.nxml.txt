The mutY gene of Escherichia coli, which codes for an adenine glycosylase that excises the adenine of a G-A mispair, has been cloned and sequenced. The mutY gene codes for a protein of 350 amino acids (Mr = 39,123) and the clone genetically complements the mutY strain. The protein shows significant sequence homology to E. coli endonuclease III, an enzyme that has previously been shown to have glycosylase activity on damaged base pairs. Sequence analysis suggests that, like endonuclease III, MutY is an iron-sulfur protein with a [4Fe-4S]2+ cluster.
