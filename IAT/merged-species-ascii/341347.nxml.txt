We have isolated from a genomic library a murine recombinant clone containing the gene coding for interleukin-1 beta m-RNA. A 7000 b.p. DNA fragment has been sequenced. Sequences homologous with human IL-1 beta cDNA have been found distributed within 7 exons. The translation of these sequences allows the prediction of a protein 269 aminoacids long. Hybridization of P388D1 RNA from cells stimulated with phorbol myristic acetate with a genomic DNA probe shows the existence of a 1.6 Kb murine IL-1 beta mRNA which is absent in the unstimulated cells. The comparative analysis between the murine IL-1 beta and the human IL-1 alpha genes shows extreme conservation of the aminoacids at the exon junctions. This observation together with the similarity in number and size of the exons suggests that these genes have diverged from a common ancestor.
