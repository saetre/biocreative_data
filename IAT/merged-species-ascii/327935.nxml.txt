The recombinant plasmid pH21-1 consists of mouse-derived complementary DNA (cDNA) in the E. coli plasmid pMB9. The mouse insertion has been completely sequenced, and encodes the CH3 domain and half the CH2 domain of the immunoglobulin gamma1 heavy chain. The predicted amino acid sequence differs at several positions from that previously published for this protein. The pattern of codon usage resembles that in some other eukaryotic messenger RNAs. A computer program has been used to predict the optimum secondary structure for the mRNA encoding the CH3 domain and the inter-domain junction.
