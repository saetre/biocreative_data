In inflammation, inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) produces nitric oxide (NO), which modulates inflammatory processes. We investigated the effects of Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitors, AG-490 and WHI-P154, on iNOS expression and NO production in J774 murine macrophages stimulated with interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma). JAK inhibitors AG-490 and WHI-P154 decreased IFN-gamma-induced nuclear levels of signal transducer and activator of transcription 1alpha (STAT1alpha). JAK inhibitors AG-490 and WHI-P154 decreased also iNOS protein and mRNA expression and NO production in a concentration-dependent manner. Neither of the JAK inhibitors affected the decay of iNOS mRNA when determined by actinomycin D assay. Our results suggest that the inhibition of JAK-STAT1-pathway by AG-490 or WHI-P154 leads to the attenuation of iNOS expression and NO production in IFN-gamma-stimulated macrophages.

Nitric oxide (NO) is a small gaseous signalling molecule that is synthesized from amino acid L-arginine in a reaction catalyzed by nitric oxide synthase (NOS). In mammalian cells, there are three isoforms of the enzyme: neuronal nNOS and endothelial eNOS are constitutively expressed and the third isoform, iNOS, is induced in response to proinflammatory cytokines and bacterial products in inflammatory and tissue cells [4, 8, 13]. Once iNOS is expressed, it produces high amounts of NO for prolonged periods. NO production through iNOS pathway is regulated mainly at the level of iNOS expression [8, 10]. In inflammation, NO modulates immune responses and inflammatory process [10, 16], and is associated with the pathophysiology of various inflammatory diseases such as asthma [18] and arthritis [23]. Compounds that inhibit iNOS expression or iNOS activity have a promise as antiinflammatory drugs based on their effects in various forms of experimentally-induced inflammation [22].

One of the central cytokines involved in the induction of iNOS expression and NO production in macrophages is interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma). IFN-gamma regulates iNOS expression at transcriptional and post-transcriptional level [8, 10]. One of the intracellular signal transduction pathways that are activated by IFN-gamma is Janus kinase (JAK)-signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) -pathway [17]. In the present study, we investigated the effects of two JAK inhibitors, AG-490 and WHI-P154, on the IFN-gamma-induced iNOS expression and NO production in cultured macrophages. Both compounds inhibited iNOS expression and NO production in IFN-gamma-treated macrophages along with their inhibitory effect on activation of STAT1.

Activation of the JAK-STAT signalling pathway in J774 mouse macrophages was studied by measuring STAT1 phosphorylation and nuclear translocation of STAT1alpha after IFN-gamma-treatment. In cells treated with IFN-gamma, tyrosine (Tyr701) phosphorylation of STAT1 was detected 15 min after addition of IFN-gamma and it was further enhanced up to 60 minutes (Figure 1(a)). Phosphorylated STATs dimerize and diffuse into the nucleus to initiate transcription [6]. Therefore we investigated the nuclear translocation of STAT1alpha in IFN-gamma-stimulated J774 macrophages. The presence of STAT1alpha in nuclear extracts was measured by Western blot. The level of STAT1alpha in the nucleus increased in a time-dependent manner after addition of IFN-gamma into the culture. In nuclei, low levels of STAT1alpha were detected already 5 min after exposure to IFN-gamma and it was increased up to 30 minutes (Figure 1(b)).

Both AG-490 and WHI-P154 decreased the nuclear translocation of STAT1alpha in a concentration-dependent manner (Figure 2). WHI-P154 was somewhat more potent than AG-490, and at 10 muM drug concentration, WHI-P154 decreased the IFN-gamma-induced nuclear translocation of STAT1alpha by approximately 50% when measured after 30 min incubation with IFN-gamma.

To investigate the effects of JAK inhibitors on NO production in J774 macrophages, the cells were treated with IFN-gamma in the absence or in the presence of increasing concentrations (3, 10, and 30 muM) of JAK inhibitors AG-490 and WHI-P154, and NO production was detected as nitrite accumulation in the culture medium. IFN-gamma induced NO production in J774 macrophages and it was inhibited in a concentration-dependent manner by AG-490 and WHI-P154 (Figure 3). WHI-P154 was somewhat more potent inhibitor of NO production than AG-490. Cytotoxicity as a contributing factor was ruled out by XTT test. When the compounds were added to cells 6 h after IFN-gamma stimulation, no effect on NO production was seen. This suggests that the compounds do not inhibit iNOS activity but rather suppress iNOS expression.

The effects of JAK inhibitors, AG-490 and WHI-P154, on iNOS mRNA expression in IFN-gamma treated cells were measured by quantitative PCR. Both AG-490 (10 muM) and WHI-P154 (10 muM) reduced iNOS mRNA levels by 60% when measured after 4 h incubation (Figure 5(a)). To study whether the JAK inhibitors affect the rate of iNOS mRNA degradation, actinomycin D assay was applied. An inhibitor of transcription, actinomycin D (0.1 mug/mL), was added into the culture after 6 h incubation with IFN-gamma or a combination of IFN-gamma and the drugs tested. Cells were harvested at time points 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6 h after the addition of actinomycin D. Neither AG-490 nor WHI-P154 affected the decay of iNOS mRNA (Figure). The results suggest that AG-490 and WHI-P154 suppress iNOS expression at the level of transcription rather than at the level of regulation of the stability of iNOS mRNA.

In the present study, we tested the effects of two JAK inhibitors, AG-490 and WHI-P154, on the activation of JAK-STAT1-signalling pathway, iNOS expression, and NO production in IFN-gamma-treated macrophages. JAK inhibitors AG-490 and WHI-P154 decreased IFN-gamma-induced iNOS expression and NO production along with inhibition of STAT1 activation. To our knowledge, down-regulation of iNOS expression and NO production by JAK inhibitor WHI-P154 has not been reported previously. The inhibitors did not affect the decay of iNOS mRNA.

Typically, cytokine stimulation involves the ligation of two different receptor subunits, and this results in the formation of JAK heterodimers and their subsequent autophosphorylation. IFN-gamma signalling preferentially leads to activation of STAT1 [6], which is phosphorylated on Tyr701 by JAK [12]. Phosphorylation of STAT1 induces STAT1 dimerization, nuclear translocation, and initiation of transcription of gamma activated site (GAS) -driven genes [7]. In our study, we followed STAT1 activation by detecting STAT1 (Tyr701) phosphorylation and by probing nuclear lysates for STAT1alpha at different time points after IFN-gamma activation. The results show that STAT1 was activated in 15 minutes after IFN-gamma-stimulation in J774 cells. Similar results have been reported recently when whole cell and nuclear lysates of J774 cells were immunoblotted for phosphorylated STAT1 [3].

STAT1 has been reported to act as a key transcription factor in IFN-gamma-dependent mouse iNOS expression [1], whereas NF-kappaB, another important transcription factor in the induction of iNOS, is merely involved in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced iNOS expression and has a minor role following IFN-gamma stimulation [1, 24]. An IFN-gamma-activated site (GAS) is necessary for full expression of iNOS in response to IFN-gamma and LPS [2, 15]. In addition, macrophages derived from STAT1-deficient mice displayed severely impaired NO production in response to a combination of IFN-gamma and LPS [15].

In the present study, stimulation of J774 macrophages by IFN-gamma led to the phosphorylation and nuclear translocation of STAT1, which was inhibited by AG-490 and WHI-P154. On molar basis, WHI-P154 was somewhat more potent inhibitor than AG-490. Similarly to our results, AG-490 has previously been shown to prevent JAK2 phosphorylation and to decrease STAT1 phosphorylation in J774 cells [1] and to decrease activation of STAT1 pathway in B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL) cells [14]. WHI-P154 was designed to specifically inhibit JAK3, and it has been shown to inhibit IL-2-triggered JAK3-dependent STAT activation in 32Dc11-IL-2Rbeta-cells [20]. WHI-P131 (another WHI-P154-related JAK inhibitor) has been shown to inhibit STAT1 activation in B-CLL cells, in platelets, and in mesenchymal stem cells [14, 19, 21]. Here we extend the earlier data by showing that WHI-P154 inhibits STAT1 activation also in IFN-gamma-treated macrophages.

In the present study, IFN-gamma induced iNOS expression and NO production in J774 macrophages, and it was inhibited by JAK inhibitors, AG-490 and WHI-P154, in a dose-dependent manner along with their inhibitory action on STAT1 activation. When the drugs were added to the culture 6 h after IFN-gamma, no effect on NO production was detected suggesting that the compounds do not inhibit iNOS activity. The results confirm the earlier studies showing that AG-490 inhibits IFN-gamma-induced iNOS expression in macrophages [1]. To our knowledge, down-regulation of iNOS expression and NO production by JAK inhibitor WHI-P154 has not been reported previously.

The regulation of iNOS expresion is controlled at the level of mRNA stability in addition to the transcriptional regulation [8, 10]. In murine macrophages, dexamethasone, and SP600125, an inhibitor of c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), reduced LPS-induced iNOS expression by destabilizing the mRNA [9, 11]. In contrast, IFN-gamma has been shown to retard iNOS mRNA degradation when compared to iNOS mRNA induced by LPS alone [9]. In the present study, the effects of AG-490 and WHI-P154 on iNOS mRNA decay were tested by actinomycin D assay. JAK inhibitors, AG-490 and WHI-P154 did not affect the rate of degradation of iNOS mRNA in cells treated with IFN-gamma. This suggests that AG-490 and WHI-P154 inhibit iNOS expression at transcriptional level and they do not regulate mechanisms involved in the iNOS mRNA stabilization.

In conclusion, we have shown that JAK inhibitors, AG-490 and WHI-P154 down-regulate STAT1 activation, iNOS expression, and NO production in IFN-gamma-treated macrophages. A better understanding of the mechanisms regulating iNOS expression and NO production in inflammation could facilitate the development of novel anti-inflammatory drugs acting through iNOS pathway.
