We report the first and complete nucleotide sequence of a human gamma 3 heavy chain constant region gene (C gamma 3). This gene displays the same organization than the others C gamma genes and exhibits normal RNA splice and polyadenylation sites. A comparison of its primary sequence with those of C gamma 1, C gamma 2 and C gamma 4 genes confirms the high degree of homology (95%) of the human family in both coding and non-coding regions, and the divergence of the hinge region. The C gamma 3 gene we sequenced codes for a Gm(b) gamma 3 chain (EZZ). Comparison with other known protein sequences reveals that only two specific aminoacids are involved in the Gm(b) and Gm(g) allotypes, which suggests an important part of the spatial configuration in the allotypic specificities.
