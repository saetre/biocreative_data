Catalase is a tetrameric hemoprotein which degrades H2O2. Recombinant phage clones containing the human catalase gene have been isolated and characterized. The gene is 34 kb long and is split into 13 exons. The precise size and location of the exons has been determined. In addition, essentially full length catalase cDNA clones have been isolated and sequenced and used to tentatively identify the 5'-end of the gene. This assignment, if correct, predicts that the region upstream of the gene does not contain a TATA box. This region is GC rich (67%) and contains several CCAAT and GGGCGG sequences which may form part of the promoter. Translation of the catalase mRNA appears to begin immediately upstream of the amino-terminal Ala residue of catalase.
