The nucleotide excision repair (NER; dark-repair) of (6-4)photoproducts ((6-4)PPs) was assayed in cells from a permanent Drosophila melanogaster embryonic cell line, Kc, after exposure to 20 or 40 J/m2 ultraviolet (UV) light. Induction rates in the transcriptionally active genes Gart and Notch as well as in the inactive white locus is similar. They are formed with a frequency of about one-third of that of cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers (CPDs). In all three genes, (6-4)PPs are repaired with the same rate and to the same extent: 31% of the (6-4)PPs are removed in 4 hours post-irradiation and after 16 hours repair is nearly complete. In none of the three genes strand-specific repair was found. Exposure of cells that were irradiated with 40 J/m2 UV to photoreactivating light for 1 hour prior to dark-repair incubation, resulted in enhanced repair of (6-4)PPs.
