The position and role of the unique N-terminal transmembrane (TM) helix, S0, in large-conductance, voltage- and calcium-activated potassium (BK) channels are undetermined. From the extents of intra-subunit, endogenous disulfide bond formation between cysteines substituted for the residues just outside the membrane domain, we infer that the extracellular flank of S0 is surrounded on three sides by the extracellular flanks of TM helices S1 and S2 and the four-residue extracellular loop between S3 and S4. Eight different double cysteine-substituted alphas, each with one cysteine in the S0 flank and one in the S3-S4 loop, were at least 90% disulfide cross-linked. Two of these alphas formed channels in which 90% cross-linking had no effect on the V50 or on the activation and deactivation rate constants. This implies that the extracellular ends of S0, S3, and S4 are close in the resting state and move in concert during voltage sensor activation. The association of S0 with the gating charge bearing S3 and S4 could contribute to the considerably larger electrostatic energy required to activate the BK channel compared with typical voltage-gated potassium channels with six TM helices.

The large-conductance, voltage and calcium (Ca2+)-activated K+ channel (BK, maxi-K, slo, KCNMA1) is expressed in many cell types, including smooth muscle and neurons. BK channel is opened by a rise in intracellular Ca2+ and by depolarization. The outward K+ flux conducted by the BK channel moves the membrane potential in the hyperpolarizing direction, suppressing activation of voltage-dependent channels. To the extent that an increase in intracellular Ca2+ concentration is due to the activation of voltage-gated Ca2+ channels, the BK channel is a negative feedback regulator of cytoplasmic Ca2+ concentration.

The BK channel pore is formed by a tetramer of alpha subunits. BK alpha is homologous to the pore-forming subunit of other voltage-gated K+ channels, as can be seen, for example, in its alignment with Kv1.2 and KvAP (Fig. 1 A), the structures of which have been determined to high resolution (Jiang et al., 2003; Long et al., 2005). All voltage-dependent K+ channels have six transmembrane (TM) helices, S1-S6. The BK alpha subunit has an additional TM helix, S0, which is N terminal to S1-S6. (Wallner et al., 1996; Meera et al., 1997). Where S0 is located relative to S1-S6 in the folded structure of BK alpha has not previously been examined.

Previous work has implicated S0 in the expression and function of the channel. Transfection of cells with BK lacking S0 yielded neither functional (Wallner et al., 1996; Morrow et al., 2006) nor biochemically detectable channels on the cell surface (unpublished data). The alpha mutants F25W, L26W, and S29W, which are on the same side of the predicted S0 helix, yielded channels with rightward shifted conductance-voltage (G-V) curves compared with wild-type (WT) alpha (Koval et al., 2007). In addition, replacement of S0 and the preceding N-terminal residues of human BK alpha with the comparable residues in Drosophila BK alpha interfered with the functional modulation of this chimera by human beta1 subunit (Wallner et al., 1996).

We used disulfide cross-linking to determine the relative proximities of S0 to the other TM helices in alpha and to determine the effects on channel function of tethering S0 to its neighboring TM helices. We substituted cysteine (Cys) for the first four residues we predicted would just flank the extracellular end of the membrane-embedded portions of the TM helices and expressed 47 double-Cys alpha mutants containing one Cys flanking S0 and another Cys flanking one of the other TM helices. We determined both the extent of endogenous disulfide bond formation (in the absence of added oxidizing agents) in alpha heterologously expressed in HEK293 cells and trafficked to the cell surface and the functional effects of the cross-links. We conclude that the extracellular end of S0 is centrally positioned among the extracellular ends of the voltage sensor domain helices, S1-S4, and is particularly close to the extracellular ends of S3 and S4 in both the resting and active states of the voltage sensor.

In most experiments, no oxidizing agent was added to the cells. In experiments to test the susceptibility of two Cys on the cell surface to reform a disulfide after reduction, we used the doubly charged oxidant, 4,4'-(azodicarbonyl)-bis-[1,1-dimethylpiperazinium, diiodide] (quaternary piperazinium diamide [QPD]) (Kosower et al., 1974), the synthesis of which was based on that of 4,4'-(azodicarbonyl)-bis-[1-methylpiperazide] (Bose et al., 1984). In brief, N-methylpiperazine was added slowly to a solution of 0.5 equivalent of diethyl diazenedicarboxylate in petroleum ether:ether (3:1) at 0degreesC. After 4 h stirring at room temperature, the product was filtered and crystallized from hexane/benzene as golden needles. It was quaternized by treatment with excess methyl iodide in acetonitrile at room temperature to yield QPD as a yellow-orange solid. The structure was confirmed by NMR (1H NMR[DMSO-d6, 400 MHz] delta [ppm] 3.97 [m, 4H], 3.83 [m, 4H], 3.57 [m, 4H], 3.52 [m, 4H], 3.19 [s, 12H]); the purity was >98%.

Mutants of the BK alpha subunit (mSlo1, KCNMA1, GenBank/EMBL/DDBJ accession no. ) were generated by site-directed mutagenesis using QuikChange XL (Stratagene). The beta1 (KCNMB1) subunit was cloned by RT-PCR from murine smooth muscle RNA (CLONTECH Laboratories, Inc.). Cys substitutions were made in a pseudo-wild-type background (pWTalpha) with the following mutations (Fig. 1 A). The FLAG epitope (DYKDDDDK) and a linker (SPGDS) were added to the N terminus. Cys 14 and Cys 141 were each mutated to Ala. The human rhinovirus (HRV-3C) protease consensus cleavage site, LEVLFQGP, which is cleaved between the Q and G, was inserted by mutating Ala89 to Leu and by inserting LFQGP between Val91 and Gly92 (site indicated in Fig. 1 A by *). This construct is called pWT-HRV alpha.

Predicted extracellular residues are shown in upper case and the rest in lower case. The extracellular residues that we mutated to Cys are shown in reverse contrast. These Cys substitutions were made in a pseudo-wild-type (pWT) construct, the sequence of which was altered as indicated in boxes above the wild-type sequence (see Materials and methods). We used ClustalW to align BK alpha residues 106-333, which contain S1-S6, with KvAP residues 31-260 and Kv1.2 residues 97-387. (B) Scheme of the threading of BK alpha through the membrane. The locations of the changes we made in wild-type alpha to generate pseudo-wild-type alpha with a HRV-3C protease cleavage site are shown. The extracellular regions flanking S0-S6, in which Cys were substituted, are indicated by filled rectangles.

The cell lysate was mixed with Neutravidin-Sepharose beads (Pierce Chemical Co.) for 90 min at room temperature. In a typical sample, lysate of approximately25% of the cells from a 100-mm plate in 240-mul lysis buffer was mixed with 30 mul of a 50% slurry of Neutravidin beads, previously washed and suspended in PBS. The beads were washed seven times with lysis buffer (without NEM and protease inhibitors) and two additional times with HRV buffer (in mM, 150 NaCl, 50 Tris, pH 7.5, 1 EDTA, 0.5% Triton X-100). The beads were mixed with 5 U of HRV-3C protease (Novagen) in 50 mul HRV-3C buffer and nutated overnight at 4degreesC. To elute bound protein and fragments released by cleavage, we added 100 mul 8 M urea, 4% SDS, 200 mM Tris, pH 8, and heated the mixture to 100degreesC for 2 min. After a short spin, the supernatant was collected. A 75-mul portion was treated with 2 mul of 400 mM DTT to reduce disulfides. Both the unreduced and the reduced portions were electrophoresed, transferred to nitrocellulose, and immunoblotted by sequential treatment with anti-BK-alpha-C-terminus antibody (BD Bioscience), horseradish-peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody, and ECL reagent (Pierce Super Signal West). We quantitated the chemiluminescence from each band with a CCD camera (Alpha Innotech Corporation) and ImageQuant software (Molecular Dynamics).

Part of each sample was exhaustively reduced, and the reduced and unreduced portions were electrophoresed in adjacent lanes. We calculated the extent of cross-linking, uncorrected for the efficiency of cleavage, from the lane with the unreduced portion and the efficiency of protease cleavage from the lane with the reduced portion. The calculation of the corrected extent of cross-linking is as follows (Fig. 2). In the reduced lane, the density of the 110-kD band divided by the sum of the densities of the 110-kD band and the 125-kD band is the fraction of alpha cleaved by protease; i.e., the efficiency of cleavage. In the unreduced lane, the same quotient is the uncorrected fraction of alpha that was not cross-linked, and hence ran as 110-kD after cleavage. This fraction was corrected to 100% cleavage by dividing it by the efficiency of protease cleavage, yielding the corrected fraction of alpha that was not cross-linked. The corrected fraction of alpha that was cross-linked equals one minus the corrected fraction of uncrosslinked alpha.

Determination of disulfide cross-linking. (A) Scheme of the method, in which cleavage at the HRV-3C protease site in the S0-S1 loop of alpha produces an approximately15-kD N-terminal fragment and an approximately110-kD C-terminal fragment. Shown schematically are the species generated from different starting alpha forms after treatment with protease and then treatment with DTT. (B) Western blots illustrating cross-linking of Cys pairs and controls. The blots were developed with an antibody against a C-terminal epitope, reacting with both the 125-kD full-length alpha and with the 110-kD C-terminal fragment generated by HRV-3C protease cleavage. (i) Control showing that the mobility of pWT alpha is not affected either by DTT (lane 1) or by HRV-3C protease followed by DTT (lane 2). (ii) alpha with an HRV site is cleaved by HRV-3C protease and is unaffected by DTT. (iii) alpha in which the native pair, Cys14 and Cys141, is endogenously cross-linked, as shown by the preponderance of the 125-kD band after protease treatment (lane 1) and the loss of this band after protease and DTT (lane 2). In panels iv, v, and vi are shown the endogenous cross-linking of three additional pairs of Cys, one Cys in each case in S0 and one in S1 (iv), S2 (v), or S3-S4 (vi). At the bottom of each gel is the fraction of alpha cross-linked corrected for the efficiency of cleavage (see Materials and methods).

The amounts of DNA required to yield equivalent coexpression of a single-Cys alpha mutant in S0 and a single-Cys alpha mutant in S5 or S6 were determined based on quantitative immunoblotting. The single-Cys mutants were coexpressed in HEK293 cells. After 48 h, the cell surface proteins were biotinylated, and the cells were lysed as above. Biotinylated proteins were captured on Neutravidin beads, which were washed and eluted, also as above. There was no cleavage step. Samples were size fractionated on SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose, and immunoblotted with anti-BK-alpha antibody. The extents of S0 to S5 and S0 to S6 cross-linking were determined by the density of the dimer band at 250 kD divided by the sum of densities of the bands at 125 kD and 250 kD. Similar results were obtained by including the densities of the lanes around the expected positions of trimer (375 kD) and of tetramer (500 kD).

We focused on two types of functional effects of mutations and cross-linking. The effect on V50 was calculated as DeltaV50 = V50,MUT - V50,pWT-HRV. The effects on the rate constants of opening and closing were calculated as log(kMUT/kpWT-HRV). The rationale is that V50 is proportional to the free energy between ground states and log(k) is proportional to the free energy between a ground state and a transition state, and therefore V50s can be added and subtracted, and the same applies to log(k)s.

Because the double Cys mutants were cross-linked to different extents, the observed functional characteristics were a composite of the characteristics of channels composed of uncrosslinked and of cross-linked alpha subunits in varying proportions. To estimate the effects of the disulfide cross-links themselves, we made some simplifying assumptions: (a) the effect of cross-linking increases linearly with the extent of cross-linking; (b) the effect of two uncrosslinked Cys is the sum of the effects of each single Cys mutation; and (c) in cross-linked Cys, the effect of the disulfide cross-link predominates over the effect of the replacement of the native residues. Based on these assumptions, we calculated what the functional effects would be if the Cys were 100% cross-linked.

Our approach was to mutate to Cys at least the first four residues just extracellular to the membrane domain of each TM helix. The TM helices in BK alpha were predicted originally by Wallner et al. (1996); the PHDhtm algorithm (Rost et al., 1995) predicted similar boundaries of the TM helices. Furthermore, the predicted BK S1-S6 helices align with the homologous S1-S6 of KvAP (Jiang et al., 2003) and Kv1.2 (Long et al., 2005) (Fig. 1 A), although the boundaries of the membrane-embedded domains are not precisely defined in these channels crystallized from detergent solution.

BK alpha contains two extracellular Cys, Cys14 and Cys141, which we mutated to Ala to generate our background construct, pseudo-wild-type (pWT) alpha. In addition, we inserted a human rhinovirus-3C (HRV-3C) protease cleavage site between S0 and S1 (Fig. 1) to permit the detection of intrasubunit cross-links (Wolin and Kaback, 2000). The construct with the HRV-3C site we call pWT-HRV, the functional characteristics of which are identical to WT (see below). In this background, we substituted Cys for the four residues flanking S0, S1, and S2, and two of the four residues in the loop between S3 and S4. In addition, in the pWT alpha background, we substituted Cys for eight residues flanking S5 and six residues flanking S6. Among all the possible combinations, we tested 47 double-Cys mutants, in which one Cys was in the flank of S0 and one Cys was in flank of one of the other helices. We focused our analysis on cell surface channels, assuming that only well-folded and assembled alpha tetramers were trafficked to the surface membrane. We selected these channels by biotinylating the surface proteins in intact cells with the relatively impermeant sulfoNHS-LC-biotin and by capturing the biotinylated channels on avidin beads after cell lysis. The efficiencies of transfection and cell surface expression of the double-Cys alpha mutants involving S0-S4 and of pWT alpha were similar.

The alpha subunit has an apparent molecular mass of approximately125 kD (Knaus et al., 1995). Intersubunit disulfide cross-links would generate dimers, trimers, or tetramers of 250, 375, and 500 kD, respectively. By contrast, alpha with an intrasubunit disulfide cross-link between S0 and another helix had no change in mass and no detectable change in electrophoretic mobility. In the presence of a disulfide between S0 and another helix, HRV-3C cleavage between S0 and S1 also did not change the mass or the mobility (Fig. 2 B). After both HRV-3C cleavage and reduction of the disulfide, however, two fragments are obtained, a 15-kD N-terminal fragment and a 110-kD C-terminal fragment, as shown schematically (Fig. 2 A) and experimentally (Fig. 2 B). The extent of intrasubunit cross-linking was quantitated as described in the Materials and methods.

To quantitate the extent of intrasubunit cross-linking, we cleaved the biotinylated and Neutravidin-bound alpha with HRV-3C protease. The alpha subunit and fragments of alpha were eluted from the Neutravidin beads in SDS, and a portion of the sample was reduced with DTT. Unreduced and reduced samples were electrophoresed and immunoblotted with an antibody against the C terminus of alpha. We quantitated the relative amounts of the 125-kD and the 110-kD species by measuring the chemiluminescence generated by a secondary HRP-tagged antibody (Fig. 2 B). We adjusted the conditions of cleavage by HRV-3C protease so that there was no cleavage of pWT alpha, which does not contain a HRV-3C cleavage site (Fig. 2 B, i). Under these conditions, pWT-HRV was cleaved by HRV-3C protease approximately70% (Fig. 2 B, ii). In each experiment, the efficiency of cleavage was determined and was used in the calculation of the extent of cross-linking (see Materials and methods).

We tested in wild-type alpha modified only with the HRV-3C site whether the two extracellular, wild-type Cys, namely Cys14, seven residues N terminal to S0, and Cys141, seven residues N terminal to S2, form a disulfide bond. There was extensive endogenous, intrasubunit disulfide-bond formation (Fig. 2 B, iii). We conclude that in WT BK alpha, the extracellular, N-terminal tail preceding S0 is tethered to the loop between S1 and S2 by a disulfide between Cys14 and Cys141.

Mean extents of endogenous disulfide-bond formation between Cys substituted in the extracellular flank of S0 and Cys substituted in the extracellular flanks of S1-S6. (A) S0 flank and S1 flank; (B) S0 flank and S2 flank; (C) S0 flank and S3-S4 loop; (D) S0 flank and S5 flank; and (E) S0 flank and S6 flank. The four residues substituted by Cys in the S0 flank are indicated along the front edge of the base, and the residues substituted by Cys in the paired flank are indicated along the right edge of the base. The extent of disulfide bond formation is represented by bars in the z direction, placed at the intersection of the lines from the paired Cys-substituted residues. In the cases in which the mean extent of disulfide bond formation was zero, the value 0.5% was plotted to identify these pairs as tested. Pairs that were not tested lead to empty intersections. Except for S3-S4, the residues closest to the membrane are closest to the front, right corner of the base. For the S3-S4 loop, L199 is closest to the predicted membrane domain of S3, and S202 is closest to the predicted membrane domain of S4. (F) Proposed location of the extracellular end of S0 relative to the extracellular ends of S1-S6, consistent with the extents of disulfide bond formation. We have taken a model of the structure of Kv1.2 in the closed state (Yarov-Yarovoy et al., 2006) as a model for the structure of BK alpha S1-S6. In this en face view, each of the four alpha subunits is rendered in a distinct color. We have marked the extracellular end of each TM helix with a numbered circle in the same color as the subunit. The extracellular end of S0 is indicated as a circle marked with a zero. Its position is consistent with the cross-linking results in A-E. We have taken the means of the top three extents of cross-linking in each of the panels A-E as a measure of the relative proximity between the segments: the mean extent of cross-linking from S0 to S1 was 66 +/- 20%; from S0 to S2, 52 +/- 11%; from S0 to S3-S4, 96 +/- 0%; from S0 to S5, 8 +/- 1%; and from S0 to S6, 2 +/- 1%.

The patterns of intrahelix cross-linking between S0 and S1, S2 and S3-S4 in alpha expressed alone (Fig. 3, A-C) were nearly the same in alpha coexpressed with WT beta1 (Table S1). In six double-Cys mutants that we tested functionally, we found that coexpressed beta1 associated with the cross-linked alpha, based on beta1 modulation of the conductance-voltage (G-V) curve (see below), but we do not know whether that association preceded disulfide bond formation in alpha.

We also tested the susceptibility to disulfide formation of Cys flanking S0 with Cys flanking S5 and S6. Given the structure of the homologous Kv1.2 (Fig. 3 F), any cross-linking between S0 and S5 or S6 was likely to be between different subunits and to result in dimers or higher oligomers. Nevertheless, we first tested double-Cys mutants of alpha, one Cys flanking S0 and one Cys flanking S5 or S6, in the same subunit. These resulted in no significant cross-linking. These constructs, however, yielded poor surface expression, and the mutants tested showed no function, even after reduction with DTT. In a second approach, we coexpressed equal amounts of two single-Cys alpha mutants, an alpha with a Cys substituted in the S0 flank and an alpha with a Cys substituted in the flank of S5 or S6. All single mutants with a Cys just in S5 or S6 expressed well and resulted in functional channels. The hybrid channels resulting from transfection with both an alpha S0 mutant and alpha S5 or S6 mutant also expressed well. Because there was no detectable cross-linking between S0 and any Cys within four residues of the membrane domain of either S5 or S6, we made Cys mutations further out from the membrane. We tested Cys substituted for the first eight residues flanking S5 and for four residues among six flanking S6. There was <8% cross-linking among any of the 32 different combinations of S0 and S5 Cys mutants (Fig. 3 D) and among any of the 16 combinations of S0 and S6 Cys mutants (Fig. 3 E; also Table S1). To control for possible interference with the cross-linking by Cys277 in the pore helix (Fig. 1 A), we also retested all of these combinations in a background in which Cys277 was mutated to Ala (Savalli et al., 2006), none of which showed any more cross-linking than previously seen (unpublished data). It is likely that the extracellular end of S0 is not close to the extracellular ends of S5 and S6.

We examined the function of the cross-linked channels to determine whether or not they were in a near-native conformation. We assume that a near-native structure would have near-native function. We note first that the background constructs, pWT-HRV alpha and pWT alpha, and WT alpha have the same activation and deactivation kinetics (Fig. 4, A-C), and the same G-V curves and sensitivity to Ca2+ (Fig. 4 D). In addition, all three were identically modulated by coexpressed beta1 (unpublished data). We infer that the native cross-link between Cys14 and Cys141 in WT alpha, but not present in pWT alpha and pWT-HRV alpha, does not influence these electrophysiological properties.

Function of background constructs and single-Cys mutants. Macroscopic currents conducted by (A) wild-type (WT) alpha, (B) pseudo-wild type (pWT) alpha with the native extracellular Cys mutated to Ala (i.e., C14A, C141A), and (C) pWT alpha with the HRV consensus site inserted between S0-S1 transmembrane segments (pWT-HRV alpha). Each construct was expressed in HEK293 cells, and the currents shown were in response to step depolarizations to 0, 40, and 80 mV, in 10 muM Ca2+. (D) For WT, pWT, and pWT-HRV in inside-out macropatches, normalized conductance is plotted against the activating voltage. The data were from the maximum of the tail currents obtained after stepping the voltage from the plotted voltage to -80 mV in nominally zero (open symbols) or 10 muM (filled symbols) Ca2+. The data were fit by 1/{1 + exp[-zF(V - V50)/RT)] }. (E) For each of the single-Cys mutants indicated on the abscissa, V50 was determined as in D in nominally 0 and 10 muM Ca2+. From the mean V50 (n > 3) was subtracted the mean V50 for pWT-HRV to obtain DeltaV50. (F) For each single-Cys mutant, the time course of activation at 240 mV was fit with an exponential function to estimate the rate constant for activation; the mean rate constants (n > 4) were divided by the mean rate constant for activation of pWT-HRV, and the log of this ratio is plotted. Similarly, the mean rate constants for deactivation at -80 mV were determined and divided by the mean deactivation rate constant for pWT-HRV. The log of this ratio is shown. The errors in the differences and ratios are propagated from the standard errors of the means of the arguments, and the errors in the logs are from the approximation log(x +/- err) = log(x) + log(1 +/- err/x) approximately log(x) +/- 0.434(err/x), where err is the standard error of the mean x.

We determined the functional effects of mutating each of the eight residues, one at a time, to Cys (Fig. 4, E and F).

Because the double Cys mutants were endogenously cross-linked to different extents, as we determined above, the observed functional characteristics were a composite of the characteristics of channels composed of uncrosslinked and of cross-linked alpha subunits in varying proportions. To compare the functional effects of the different cross-links, we normalized (see Materials and methods) the functional effects to 100% cross-linking (Fig. 5).

It was notable that two cross-links between S0 and S3-S4, R20C to L199C and R17C to R201C, had almost no effect on the V50 or on the rate constants for activation and deactivation (Fig. 5, E-H; Fig. S2), implying that these residues are close in the resting, activated, and transitions states. Other cross-links between S0 and S3-S4 did have significant effects on V50 or gating kinetics. The cross-links between R17C, G18C, and Q19C, in the S0 flank, and L199C, in the S3-S4 loop, all caused a rightward shift in the G-V curves (Fig. 5 E), indicating that more electrostatic energy was needed to activate the channel; i.e., the closed state was stabilized relative to the open state. By contrast, cross-links between Q19C or R20C and R201C caused a leftward shift in the G-V curve and hence stabilized the open state relative to the closed state (Fig. 5 G). The shifts were similar in 0 and 10 muM Ca2+, implying that the cross-links did not affect the dependence of V50 on Ca2+.

Consistent with the above shifts in V50 were the changes in activation and deactivation kinetics. For all S0 Cys to S3-S4 L199C cross-links that caused a rightward shift in V50, the rate constants for activation were slowed more than the rate constants for deactivation (Fig. 5, E and F). In contrast, for the pairs between S0 and R201C that showed a leftward shift in V50, the rate constants for deactivation were slowed more than the rate constants for activation (Fig. 5, G and H).

All cross-links from the S0 flank to the S1 flank and from the S0 flank to the S2 flank resulted in effects on V50 or on the kinetics of activation and deactivation (Fig. 5, A-D; Fig. S2). These effects could reflect the cross-linking of Cys substituted for residues that in the native structure are in different positions in the different states of the voltage sensor, or the effects could reflect a perturbation of a static part of the structure that in turn affects parts that do move. Again, that these perturbations do not completely disrupt channel function and that the extents of endogenous cross-linking are moderately high indicate that the Cys involved, and the native residues they replaced, are not far apart in either the resting or the activated states of the voltage sensor.

In three double-Cys mutants with large DeltaV50s, we tested by reduction of the disulfide on the cell surface whether the functional changes were due to disulfide bond formation per se or to the effects of the mutations (Fig. 6). We exposed outside-out patches to 20 mM DTT at pH 8.0 for 5-10 min (Fig. 6, A-D). DTT shifted the G-V curves back toward the G-V curves of the single Cys mutants, leftward in R17C-P137C (Fig. 6, B and E) and rightward in R20C-R201C (Fig. 6, D and E). In R20C-F144C (Fig. 6, C and E), DTT shifted the G-V curve rightward toward the G-V curve of the single mutant, F144C, the only single mutant the function of which was significantly different than that of pWT-HRV (Fig. 4 E). DTT did not affect the G-V curve of pWT-HRV (Fig. 6 A). Also, in no case did DTT increase the maximum tail currents at -80 mV, from which we conclude that there was no pool of channels held in a nonfunctional state by disulfide cross-linking.

One criterion of the near-native structure of cross-linked double-Cys mutant was that they were transported to the cell surface. Another criterion would be whether the disulfide cross-link could be reduced and reoxidized at the cell surface. For reoxidation we used a membrane-impermeant, novel bis-quaternary-ammonium diamide derivative (QPD) (Fig. 7 A), which, like diamide, can induce disulfide bond formation. QPD did not induce cross-linking of the single-Cys mutants (unpublished data). We tested the reformation by QPD of the disulfide between G18C and L199C and between R20C and R201C (Fig. 7 B), two pairs that were almost completely cross-linked endogenously and in which the cross-link had measurable functional effects. In both cases, DTT reduced, and QPD reformed, the disulfides.

We also determined whether QPD could restore the functional effects of cross-linking G18C-L199C alpha and R20C-R201C alpha (Fig. 7 C). In G18C-L199C alpha, endogenous cross-linking shifted the G-V curve to the right relative to pWT-HRV (Fig. 5 E); DTT shifted it to the left; and QPD shifted it back to the right (Fig. 7 C). In R20C-R201C alpha endogenous cross-linking shifted the G-V curve to the left relative to pWT-HRV (Fig. 5 G). DTT shifted the G-V curve to the right relative to that of the unreduced mutant, and QPD shifted the curve back toward that of the endogenously cross-linked alpha (Fig. 7 C). QPD did not affect the V50 of the single mutants (Fig. 7 D). Thus, for these two mutants, the cross-link could be reduced and reformed at the cell surface with similar effects on V50 to those resulting from endogenous cross-linking.

Disulfide Cross-linking

Our approach to locating S0 among the other TM helices, S1-S6, was to mutate to Cys, one at a time, at least the first four residues just extracellular to the membrane domain of the TM helices. In the polar juxtamembrane environment, the Cys thiol can ionize to the reactive thiolate and is accessible to oxidizing reagents and oxidizing enzymes. Furthermore, Cys just outside the membrane domain of different TM helices are more or less in the same plane parallel to the membrane. Because at least four consecutive positions are mutated, all directions parallel to the membrane are sampled, whatever the local secondary structure, and in neighboring segments at least some substituted Cys are likely to be pointing toward each other and susceptible to disulfide bond formation.

The induction of disulfide bond formation between substituted Cys has been widely used to infer the structure and structural dynamics of proteins (Bass et al., 2007). In Shaker K+ channels, disulfide bond formation between substituted Cys has provided evidence for the proximity between the extracellular end of S4 of one subunit and the extracellular end of S5 of an adjacent subunit (Laine et al., 2003; Elliott et al., 2004), an arrangement that is compatible with the model in Fig. 3 F. Also in Shaker, cross-linking was obtained between the extracellular end of S4 and positions approximately six residues from the extracellular ends of S1 and S2 (Campos et al., 2007).

Even though the centers of the sulfur atoms in a disulfide are only 3 A apart, disulfide bond formation has been induced between Cys SH known to be 15 A apart in the crystal structure of a protein (Butler and Falke, 1996). This is consistent with the fluctuating nature of protein structures, where even some moderately distant residues have finite probability of colliding, the shorter the distance, the greater the probability. Based on this, the relative proximities of cysteines have been inferred from the relative rate constants for disulfide bond formation (Bass et al., 2007). Distance, however, is not the only determinant of the rate constant for disulfide bond formation. Structural flexibility and the likelihood of overcoming steric hindrance and of achieving the correct orientation for reaction may differ in different parts of a protein. The electrostatic environment also plays a role in at least two ways: it affects the pKA of the cysteine thiol (the thiolate is the reactive species), and it affects the collision probability of the charged reactants. At the water-accessible surface of a protein, these effects are modest in the absence of a local, high concentration of positive or negative side chains (Hansen et al., 2005).

We determined the extent of endogenous disulfide bond formation in intact cells. No oxidizing agent was added. Endogenous disulfide formation of a protein targeted to the cell membrane can be due to uncatalyzed Cys thiol oxidation by dissolved O2 (i.e., spontaneous disulfide formation) or to catalytic oxidation by protein disulfide isomerase (PDI) homologues in the ER(Wilkinson and Gilbert, 2004), by secreted PDI homologues (Jiang et al., 1999), or by secreted oxidases (Becker et al., 2006). Endogenous disulfide bond formation between juxtamembrane Cys in membrane proteins has been observed (Whitley et al., 1993; Jansen and Akabas, 2006; Iscla et al., 2007). For membrane-spanning proteins, only Cys in the extracytoplasmic domain or close to the exofacial lipid-water interface are substrates for PDI homologues (Luo et al., 2004; Lu et al., 2006; Wilkinson and Gilbert, 2004).

The mechanism of PDI and its homologues provides a rationale for relating the extent of disulfide bond formation to the proximity of the Cys involved. These enzymes make and break disulfides repeatedly in the context of chaperone-enabled refolding, so that at the end of the process the disulfides formed are the most stable ones possible (Wilkinson and Gilbert, 2004). It seems likely that if there are only two extracellular Cys accessible in the target protein, then the extent of disulfide formation should depend on the stability of this target disulfide relative to the stability of the disulfide between the two Cys in the catalytic site of the PDI homologue. Thus, the stability of the PDI catalytic site disulfide provides a baseline. Like the rate constant for disulfide bond formation discussed above, the stability of the target disulfide depends on the proximity of the two Cys in a stable structure of the protein. The stability of the disulfide-bonded structure will depend on the differences in both electrostatic and nonelectrostatic terms in the free energy difference between the disulfide bonded structure and the structures with free cysteines. We sought to determine the average proximity of short segments of the BK alpha by testing multiple Cys pairs to average out the effects of relative orientation and local electrostatics.

As a measure of the relative proximity of the extracellular flank of S0 to the flanks of S1-S6, we averaged the top three extents of cross-linking for each group (Fig. 3, A-E). In a model of BK alpha based on a Rosetta model of Kv1.2 in the closed state (Yarov-Yarovoy et al., 2006), we placed a circle representing the extracellular end of S0 in a location that satisfies qualitatively the relative proximities estimated from the mean extents of cross-linking and is consistent with the lack of cross-linking to S5 and S6 (Fig. 3 F). The extracellular end of S0 is in a cove three-quarters surrounded by the extracellular ends of S1-S4, closest to the short loop between S3 and S4.

Our inference is based not only on the high extent of endogenous cross-linking of the S0 flank to the S1 and S2 flanks and to the S3-S4 loop but also on the lack of significant cross-linking to the flanks of S5 and S6. We guarded against the possibility that this lack of cross-linking could be due to a misalignment normal to the membrane plane by testing Cys substituted in positions six (S6) and eight (S5) residues from the predicted extracellular side of the membrane (Fig. 3, D and E). There was a small extent of cross-linking of S0 to Cys five and eight residues from the membrane domain of S5 (Fig. 3 D), most likely a reflection of the flexibility of the S0 flank and the increased flexibility of the S5 flank some distance from the membrane. Could the meager extent of cross-linking of S0 to S5 and S6 be due to the suppression of the reactivity of the Cys due to local negatively charged residues? Although we do not know the exact three-dimensional structure of these regions in BK alpha, Asp and Glu are not concentrated in the sequences around the residues mutated to Cys (Fig. 1 A). There are as many negatively charged residues in or around the flanks of S1 and S2, which did cross-link to S0, as around the flank of S5, which did not cross-link to S0. Furthermore, the flank of S0 is positively charged, which should more than compensate for the effect of negatively charged residues around a Cys in another flank (Hansen et al., 2005).

Functional Effects of Cross-linking

Our initial purpose of looking at the functional effects of the cross-linking was to determine whether or not a cross-linked alpha was in a near-native conformation. Our assumption was that near-normal function implies near-normal structure. We found that each of the 16 double-Cys mutants that we tested for function were expressed at the cell surface and were functional. Thus, the most highly cross-linked double-Cys mutants were functionally competent and had near-native structures.

Of course, the combination of the mutation of two native residues to Cys and the cross-linking of the Cys by a disulfide bond must perturb the native structure to some extent. What can we infer about the structural dynamics of the cross-linked segments from the functional effects of cross-linking? This question is easiest to answer for cross-links that form endogenously to a high extent and have no functional effects. Two cross-links between S0 and S3-S4, R20C to L199C and R17C to R201C, had almost no effect on the V50 or on the rate constants for activation and deactivation (Fig. 5, E-H; Fig. S2). Because the extents of endogenous cross-linking of these pairs were 96% and 88%, respectively, we conclude that the two Cys in each of these pairs, and the native residues that they replaced, are near neighbors in the resting state of the voltage sensor in which disulfide bond formation takes place. But they are also likely to be closely apposed in the activated state of the voltage sensor, because the cross-linked structures favor neither the open nor the closed state. If the cross-link stabilized either state, DeltaV50 would have been significantly different than zero, which it was not. Furthermore, the two Cys (and the native residues that they replaced) are unlikely to move relative to one another during the transitions between states, because the cross-linking of the substituted Cys has little effect on the kinetics of opening and closing. We conclude that the two Cys, and the residues that they replaced, are close neighbors in the closed, open, and transition states of the channel.

The native residues, R20 and L199, are predicted to be the first residues just flanking the membrane domains of S0 and S3, respectively. Thus, the adjacent membrane domains of S0 and S3 in both the deactivated/closed and activated/open states and in the transition states are also close. Similarly, R17C and R201C formed a cross-link between the S0 flank and the S3-S4 loop, two residues from the membrane domain of S4. It seems likely that the four residues flanking the extracellular end of S0 and the four-residue loop between S3 and S4 follow close, parallel trajectories, because all of the double-Cys mutants in these segments cross-linked nearly completely (Fig. 3 C; Table S1). Thus, to the extent that the extracellular ends of S3 and S4 move during activation and deactivation, the extracellular end of S0 moves with them. Some of the cross-links between the S0 flank and the S3-S4 loop do result in changes in V50 or in the rate constants of activation and deactivation (Fig. 5, E-H), which is consistent with some differences in the interface between these segments in the resting, transition, or activated states.

Whatever the interactions are between the S0 flank and the S3-S4 loop, their residues are not irreplaceable for the function of alpha alone, because deletion of the N-terminal extracellular residues, starting with R20, did not perturb the function of alpha; this deletion did, however, prevent the modulation of the V50 by by beta1(Morrow et al., 2006). Therefore, the effect of S0 on the properties of the BK voltage sensor must depend on interactions either with the S0 membrane domain, for which there is evidence (Koval et al., 2007), and/or with the intracellular S0-S1 loop.

Compared with other voltage-gated K+ channels, BK channel V50s for both gating current and for opening are shifted to much more positive voltages. Although the BK channel has a smaller gating charge, the electrostatic energy for activating the voltage sensors is greater for the BK channel than that for other voltage-gated K+ channels. F x qgating x V50,gating is a measure of the standard free energy difference per mole between the resting and the activated states. For the BK channel composed of alpha alone, qgating is 0.55 charges per subunit and V50 is 156 mV (Stefani et al., 1997; Horrigan and Aldrich, 1999; Bao and Cox, 2005); thus, the standard free energy difference is 8.5 kJ/mole-subunit. For Kv1.2 (Scholle et al., 2004), Kv2.1 (Scholle et al., 2004), and Shaker (Schoppa et al., 1992), the standard free energy differences range from -3.6 to -15 kJ/mole-subunit. Thus, the standard free energy difference, activated state minus resting state, is 12 to 23 kJ per mole-subunit (2.9 to 5.5 kcal/mol-subunit) more positive in BK channel than in Kv1.2, Kv2.1, or Shaker channels. Niu et al. (2004) suggested that the cytoplasmic Ca2+-dependent linker-gating ring complex exerts drag on the BK channel gate and the voltage sensor. Given the position of S0 in the midst of S1-S4 and its close proximity to S3 and S4, it seems possible that S0 also contributes to the stabilization of the resting state of the BK channel relative to other voltage-gated K+ channels.

Spontaneous oxidation of protein Cys is very slow in the absence of metal catalysts (Wilkinson and Gilbert, 2004; Becker et al., 2006) and is unlikely to be faster than the rate of spontaneous intramolecular disulfide bond formation in dithiothreitol, which has a k </= 0.05/h at neutral pH and room temperature (unpublished data). The half-time for internalization of the K+ channel, Kv1.4, transiently transfected in HEK293 cells, was 87 min (i.e., kIN = approximately0.5/h) (Jugloff et al., 2000), and kIN = 0.4/h to 0.8/h for an N-type Ca2+ channel, also transiently transfected in HEK293 cells (Bernstein and Jones, 2007). Assuming a similar kIN for BK alpha and that catalytic disulfide bond formation is taking place mainly in the ER, kOX </= 0.05/h, kOX/kIN < 0.1, and Eq. A10 applies.
