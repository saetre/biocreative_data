A survey of tRNA genes and retroelements (Ty) in the genome of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae is presented. Aspects of genomic organization and evolution of these genetic entities and their interplay are discussed. Attention is also given to the relationship between tRNA gene multiplicity and codon selection in yeast and the role of Ty elements.
