Loss-of-function in the apoptosis-inducing genes is known to facilitate tumorigenesis. AFX (FOXO4), a member of forkhead transcription factors functions as a tumor suppressor and has 2 isoforms, AFXalpha (505 a.a.) and AFXzeta (450 a.a.). In human cancer cells, we identified an N-terminally deleted form of AFXalpha (alpha198-505), translated from a downstream start and 2 short N-terminal AFX proteins (90, and 101 a.a.) produced by aberrant splicing.

Methods and Findings

###begin p 5
We investigated the expression and role of these AFX variants. Cell transduction study revealed that short N-terminal AFX proteins were not stable. Though alpha(198-505) protein expression was detected in the cytoplasm and nucleus, alpha(198-505) expressing cells did not show a nucleocytoplasmic shuttling mediated by PI3 kinase signaling. Whereas, we observed this shuttling in cells expressing either AFXalpha or AFXzeta protein. AFXzeta and alpha(198-505) lost the ability to transactivate BCL6 or suppress cyclin D2 gene expression. These variants did not induce cancer cell death whereas AFXalpha resulted in apoptosis. We found that AFXzeta and alpha(198-505) suppress the AFXalpha stimulation of BCL6 promoter in a dose dependent manner, indicating dominant negative activity. These variants also inhibited AFXalpha induction of apoptosis.

AFX (FOXO4) is a member of the class O (FOXO) subfamily of forkhead transcription factors that includes the functionally related proteins FOXO1 (FKHR), FOXO3a (FKHRL1), and FOXO4 [1], [2]. FOXO transcription factors have important roles in metabolism, cellular proliferation, and apoptosis. Overproduction of FOXOs induces either cell cycle arrest or apoptosis. When relieved of FOXO activity, cells re-enter the cell cycle and start to proliferate [3]. A role for FOXO members in tumorigenesis was initially suggested by the observation that FOXO members are involved chromosomal translocations in certain types of tumors [4], [5]. The PAX3-FKHR fusion product has been shown to transform cells in culture [6]. However, translocations involving FOXO proteins might also result in loss-of-function of a FOXO allele.

AFX is known to have two isoforms, AFXalpha (505 amino acids) and AFXzeta (450 amino acids) [7]. AFXzeta is a splice variant that encodes a shorter protein lacking amino acids 58-112, including the first 16 amino acids of the forkhead domain. AFXalpha is ubiquitously expressed, whereas AFXzeta is expressed predominantly in liver, kidney, pancreas, heart, and placenta. AFXzeta transcripts are not detected in ovary, testis, brain, prostate, colon, and leukocyte. The different tissue distributions AFXalpha and AFXzeta suggest distinct transcriptional regulation and actions on a different subset of target genes.

PCR amplification of reverse-transcribed cDNA samples from human cancer cell lines was performed using a primer set that anneals to both AFXalpha and AFXzeta cDNAs. The upper band (445 bp) corresponds to AFXalpha and lower band (290 bp) contains AFXzeta. There was a slight difference in the size of AFXzeta bands among the cell lines, prompting us to consider possible splicing variants (Fig. 1A). Direct sequencing of lower bands identified the AFXzeta isoform, as well as overlapping and mixed sequences near splice acceptor site of AFXzeta isoform (not shown). The lower bands were cloned and sequenced to investigate these sequences further. Two novel splicing variants were identified, in which the splice acceptance occurred aberrantly at 4 and 14 bases before splice acceptor site of the AFXzeta isoform (Fig. 1B, C). This aberrant splicing results in either a 4 or 14 base insertion, leading to a shift of the reading frame and producing premature stop codon. Splicing variants with the 4 or 14 base insertion encode predicted proteins of 90 (AFXtr1) or 101 (AFXtr2) amino acids, respectively (Fig. 1C). A variety of tumor cells showed different patterns of AFX transcripts (Fig. 1A). Either AFXtr1 or AFXtr2 were detected in most tumor cells. AFXzeta was detected in DOV13, OVCA429, CaCO2, HEK293, and 293FT cells. AFXalpha expression was absent in OVCA429 and 293FT cells. JEG3 cells express only AFXalpha. Percent ratio of AFXzeta, AFXtr1, and AFXtr2 was different each other according to tumor cells (Fig. 1A).

We became interested in the N-terminally truncated AFXalpha proteins because AFXtr1 and AFXtr2 are prematurely terminated in exon 1, and three potential alternative start codons (M1, M2, and M3) are present in exon 1b and 2 (Fig. 2A). M3 is the methionine codon located at the end of forkhead domain. It contains a consensus Kozak sequence for initiation of translation and thus potentially encodes an N-terminally deleted AFXalpha. Western blot analyses using an anti-HA antibody from the lysate of 293FT cells transfected with C-terminal hemaglutinin (HA) epitope-tagged AFXalpha detected an additional band, suggesting a presence of N-terminally deleted AFX protein (Fig. 2B, arrow). In order to identify this product, we generated three N-terminally deleted AFX constructs tagged with C-terminal-HA epitope {alpha(131-505)-HA, alpha(178-505)-HA, and alpha(198-505)-HA}. Western blotting with anti-AFX antibody (C-terminal specific) after immunoprecipitation with anti-HA antibody of transfected cell lysates confirmed the presence of the alpha(198-505) protein (Fig. 2C, arrow).

Cellular protein processing and localization of AFX variants was examined by immunofluorescence (IF) staining. JEG3 cells were transfected with the constructs carrying the N- or C-terminal HA epitope in-frame with AFXalpha-HA, AFXzeta-HA, or alpha(198-505)-HA. Immunofluorescence positivity was detected in about 5-8% of JEG3 cells. No protein expression was detected in cells transfected with HA-AFXtr1 and HA-AFXtr2 (Data not shown). To achieve high levels of gene expression, we generated adenoviral vectors carrying these constructs. After determining the dose of adenoviral vectors required to achieve 95-100% expression of the control beta-galactosidase gene in HeLa cells, protein expression was still not detected for vectors containing HA-AFXtr1 or HA-AFXtr2 (data not shown), whereas 90-95% of cells expressed AFXalpha-HA, AFXzeta-HA, or alpha(198-505)-HA in either cytoplasms and nuclei (Fig. 3A). These results indicate that the short aminoterminal-AFX proteins are not appropriately processed or stable in the cells, although the product from the alternate translation start site alpha(198-505) is produced.

The effect of the cell signaling on subcellular localization was assessed by adding insulin, EGF, or LY294002 (a PI3 kinase inhibitor). Insulin and EGF treatment induced the excursions of AFXalpha and AFXzeta to cytoplasms and LY294002 pretreatment prevented these excursions, indicating that nucleocytoplasmic shuttling of AFXalpha or AFXzeta protein is occurred and regulated by PI3 kinase signaling pathway. Whereas alpha(198-505) expressing cells did not show this shuttling (Fig. 3B). This defect may be due to the fact that alpha(198-505) has lost two binding sites for 14-3-3 protein and half of the nuclear localization sequence (182-211 amino acids) [8], [9], [10], [11].

The transcriptional activity of AFXzeta and alpha(198-505) was compared to AFXalpha using a luciferase reporter system. The amounts of plasmid vectors transfected were carefully optimized to minimize nonspecific effects [12] and luciferase values were normalized by protein measurements. AFXzeta and alpha(198-505) did not stimulate 3IRS-TATA-Luc, whereas AFXalpha activated this reporter about 15-fold (Fig. 4A). Two representative target genes, BCL6 and cyclin D2, were also examined. BCL6 is a transcriptional repressor of BCL-XL, an antiapoptotic protein, and the AFX protein is thought to induce activates apoptosis by stimulation of BCL6 [13]. The cell cycle inhibition by AFX protein involves down-regulation of cyclin D [14]. In 293FT cells, AFXzeta and alpha(198-505) did not stimulate BCL6p-Luc or suppress CD2p-Luc, whereas AFXalpha stimulated BCL6p-Luc 13-fold and suppressed CD2p-Luc by 75% (Fig. 4B, C). RT-PCR and Western blot analyses were used to investigate the effect of the AFX variants on the expression of BCL6 or cyclin D2 in cells infected with adenoviral vectors carrying AFXalpha, AFXzeta, or alpha(198-505). Whereas AFXalpha induced BCL6 expression in MCF7 cells, Ad-zeta or Ad-alpha(198-505) did not increase either BCL6 mRNA or protein (Fig. 4D). Ad-alpha suppressed cyclin D2 expression, however Ad-zeta or Ad-alpha(198-505) lost the ability to suppress its expression in MCF7 or OVCA429 cells (Fig. 4E). These results indicate that the AFX variants are loss-of-function mutants.

We examined whether AFX variants might inhibit AFXalpha induction of apoptosis through dominant negative activity. An additional adenoviral vector {Ad-alpha(1-200)} were constructed containing AFXalpha(1-200), a C-terminal truncation mutant that contains a functional DNA-binding domain, but lacks a transactivation domain. A similar FOXO1(1-255) construct has been shown to have dominant negative activity [15], [16]. Ad-alpha(1-200) infection alone did not induce cell death in HepG2, T47D, HeLa, OVCA429, and OVCA420 cells (data not shown). Co-infection of Ad-alpha with equal (5 PFU/cell) or higher (15 PFU/cell) amounts of Ad-E, Ad-zeta, Ad-alpha(198-505), or Ad-alpha(1-200) in T47D cells were performed to investigate the effect of AFX variants on AFXalpha induction of apoptosis. Because high amounts of adenoviral vector alone induce cell death, control infections were performed using Ad-E, an MOI (10 and 20 PFU/cell) that was equal to total amount of co-infected adenoviral vectors. Co-infection of Ad-alpha and Ad-E induced 30-40% more cell death compared to corresponding amounts of Ad-E infection. Co-infection of Ad-zeta, Ad-alpha(198-505), or Ad-alpha(1-200) prevented AFXalpha induction of cell death (Fig. 5B), suggesting dominant negative activity of AFX variants. Cellular examination was also performed using double immunofluorescent. HeLa cells expressing nucleic AFXalpha alone showed apoptotic nuclei, whereas HeLa cells co-expressing AFXalpha with AFXzeta or alpha(198-505) did not show apoptosis. Of note, AFXalpha was co-localized with AFXzeta or alpha(198-505) in nuclear speckles of these cells (Fig. 5C).

The mechanism of dominant negative activity of AFX variants was assessed further by examining effects on transcriptional regulation of 3IRS-TATA-Luc, BCL6p-Luc, and CD2p-Luc. Co-transfection of AFXalpha with equal or increasing amounts of the AFX variants was preformed in the context of these luciferase reporters. Co-transfection with the AFX variants reduced the AFXalpha-induced transactivation of 3IRS-TATA-Luc and BCL6p-Luc in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 6A, B). The reduction by AFXzeta was comparable to that of alpha(1-200). However, the AFX variants did not reverse AFXalpha suppression of CD2p-Luc activity (Fig. 6C). These results suggest that the inhibition of AFXalpha-induced apoptosis is mediated through dominant negative activity of AFX variants on AFXalpha in BCL6 gene expression.

In this report, we identified spliced forms of AFX transcripts in multiple human cancer cell lines. Short aminoterminal AFX proteins (AFXtr1 and AFXtr2) produced by aberrant splicing were not stable, suggesting AFX inactivation by aberrant splicing. However, alternative splicing and translation produced AFXzeta and alpha(198-505), respectively. AFXzeta and alpha(198-505) lost the ability to transactivate BCL6 or to suppress cyclin D2 gene expression. Although inactive as individual transcription factors, AFXzeta and alpha(198-505) exert dominant negative activity on AFXalpha stimulation of BCL6 gene. These variants also lost the ability to induce apoptosis but they inhibited AFXalpha induced apoptosis, presumably through dominant negative activity on the BCL6 gene. Inactivation of AFX by aberrant splicing and the dominant negative function of the AFX splicing variants could therefore provide a growth advantage during cancer progression.

It has been suggested that AFXalpha and AFXzeta may antagonized each other because of their distinct transcriptional activity for different target genes. For example, AFXzeta stimulates PEPCK, G6Pase promoters, whereas AFXalpha does not activate these promoters [7]. We also observed distinct transcriptional regulatory function for AFXalpha and AFXzeta. The CD2 promoter was weakly stimulated by AFXzeta and repressed by AFXalpha (Fig. 4C). A novel finding in this study is the dominant negative function of AFXzeta or alpha(198-505) on AFXalpha regulation of the BCL6 promoter. A number of AFXalpha binding sites have been demonstrated in BCL6 promoter [13]. One AFXalpha binding site was also competed by a known forkhead-binding site (IRS) derived from the IGFBP-1 promoter [13]. Consistent with this, we also observed dominant negative activity by the AFX variants on AFXalpha stimulation of 3xIRS promoter construct. These results indicate that the dominant negative activity by AFX variants may be mediated through IRS (GCAAAACAA AC TTATTTTGAA).

The induction of BCL6 accounts for part of the apoptotic mechanism mediated by AFXalpha. FOXO dependent expression of IGFBP-1 [17], FasL [18], [19] and Bim [20]-[23] have also been shown to promote apoptosis. Direct FOXO binding activity has been demonstrated in the FasL promoter (GTAAATAAATA) and the Bim promoter (GTAAACAC). It is possible that the AFX variants may also influence AFXalpha activation of these genes.

Of note, the AFX variants did not reverse AFXalpha suppression of the CD2 promoter. FOXO factors have been shown to elevate p27KIP1 expression and induce cell cycle arrest [24], [25]. FOXO3a and AFX have also been shown to inhibit the cell cycle through downregulation of cyclin D by a p27KIP1-independent mechanism [2], [14], [26]. Chromatin immunopreciptation (ChIP) using the cyclin D1 [27] and cyclin D2 promoters [28] demonstrated FOXO binding on the cyclin D promoters. However, a recent study suggested that transcriptional repression of D-type cyclin may not involve direct binding of FOXO factors to cyclin D1 or D2 promoters [26]. These results suggest that transcription repressors activated by AFXalpha might play a role in downregulation of cyclin D.

An important question is whether there is a causal relationship between AFX splicing variants and cancer. For this to be feasible, the alternative splicing products would need to be expressed at significant levels compared with the normally spliced product [29]. We compared the pattern of AFX transcripts in two different cell lines (HEK 293 and 293FT) originated from same cells. By RT-PCR there was a decrease of the AFXalpha transcript in 293FT cells, whereas HEK293 cells still possessed it (Fig. 1A). HEK293 cells are transformed by the adenovirus E1 gene and 293FT cells were additionally transformed by simian virus (SV) 40 large tumor antigen. Loss of the AFXalpha transcript and the appearance of the AFX variants could contribute to the higher proliferation of 293FT cells relative to HEK293 cells (data not shown). However, the mechanism described in our study remains to be determined in primary tumors.

Defects in mRNA splicing occur frequently in human cancer cells [29] but the mechanisms leading to splicing defects in cancer are poorly understood. A point mutation in the genomic splice site or regulatory elements have been shown in selected splicing defects [30]-[32]. However, DNA sequencing of the intronic and exonic portions of AFX gene did not reveal mutations. Variations in the composition, concentration, localization, and activity of transacting regulatory factors may also modulate splice-site recognition and usage [33], [34]. Activation of the oncogenic signal pathway also stimulates aberrant splicing [35]. It is of interest to better understand how splicing regulatory factors in cancer cells might affect AFX aberrant splicing and thereby cell survival.

Total RNA was extracted from each cells using TRIZOL reagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) as described by the manufacturer. RNA (20 mug) was treated with DNAse-I (Promega, Madison, WI) for 30 min at room temperature. Random hexamers and AMV reverse transcriptase (RT) were used to synthesize cDNA using 10 mug of DNAse-I treated RNA. A portion (1/40) of the cDNA solution was used for amplification of AFX. Cycle conditions were: 2 min hot start at 96degreesC, followed by 35 cycles of 1 min at 94degreesC, 45 sec at 56degreesC, followed by 1 min at 72degreesC, and a final extension at 72degreesC for 5 minutes. An aliquot (50%) of each PCR reaction was resolved by electrophoresis on 1.8% agarose gels and DNA products were visualized with ethidium bromide.

Transfected or infected cells were reseeded on cover glasses precoated with fibronectin. Twenty four hrs later, cells were fixed in cold methanol for 10 min and permeabilized in 0.4% Triton-X/PBS for 10 min. After washing with TBS/0.05% Tween, rat monoclonal anti-HA high affinity antibody (Clone 3F10, 2.5 mug/ml, Roche Diagnostic Co, Manm, Germany) was incubated for 2 hrs. Visualization was performed using anti-rat Ig-biotin, F(ab')2 fragment (5 mug/ml, Jackson Immunoresearch, city) and streptavidin-Texas Red (1:100, Vector Laboratories Inc., Burlingame, CA). Cell images were analyzed using a Zeiss microscope (Axioskop, Carl Zeiss Inc., Oberkochen, Germany). For N-terminal specific antibody against AFX (Goat, AFX-N, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. Santa Cruz CA), biotinylated anti-goat antibody (1:300, Vector lab) was used. Each antibody was optimized and titrated to minimize nonspecific activity.
