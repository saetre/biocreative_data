Reactive oxygen species produce different lesions in DNA. Among them, 7,8-dihydro-8-oxoguanine (8-oxoG) is one of the major oxidative products implicated in mutagenesis. This lesion is removed from damaged DNA by base excision repair, and genes coding for 8-oxoG-DNA glycosylases have been isolated from bacteria, yeast and human cells. We have isolated and characterized the cDNA encoding the rat 8-oxoG-DNA glycosylase (rOGG1). Expression of the cDNA in the fgp mutY Escherichia coli double mutant allowed the purification of the untagged rOGG1 protein. It excises 8-oxoG from DNA with a strong preference for duplex DNA containing 8-oxoG:C base pairs. rOGG1 also acts on formamidopyrimidine (FaPy) residues, and the K m values on 8-oxoG and FaPy residues are 18.8 and 9.7 nM, respectively. When acting on an oligonucleotide containing an 8-oxoG residue, rOGG1 shows a beta-lyase activity that nicks DNA 3' to the lesion. However, rOGG1 acts on a substrate containing an apurinic site by a beta-delta elimination reaction and proceeds through a Schiff base intermediate. Expression of rOGG1 in E.coli fpg mutY suppresses its spontaneous mutator phenotype.
