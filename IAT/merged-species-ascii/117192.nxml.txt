Activating transcription factor 3 (ATF3) is a member of the ATF/CREB family of transcription factors and its expression is increased by various pathophysiological conditions and in several cancer cells. In this study, we describe two alternatively spliced ATF3DeltaZip mRNAs: ATF3DeltaZip2a and ATF3DeltaZip2b. Both variants encoded the same truncated protein of 135 amino acids, which lacked the leucine zipper domain and was incapable of binding to the ATF/CRE motif. The ATF3DeltaZip2 protein was shown to be localized in the nuclei and counteracted the transcriptional repression by the full-length ATF3. Western blot analysis showed that ATF3DeltaZip2 was expressed in cells exposed to A23187. Further study showed that, similar to the full-length ATF3, the expression of ATF3DeltaZip2 was induced by a wide range of stress stimuli. However, its expression was not detectable in cancer cells that constitutively over-expressed ATF3. Taken together, our results suggest that ATF3DeltaZip2, a protein derived from alternatively spliced mRNAs, is induced by various stress signals and may modulate the activity of the full-length ATF3 protein during stress response.

Alternative splicing of pre-mRNA encoding transcription factors is one of the common mechanisms for generating the complexity and diversity of gene regulation (1-3). It produces a variety of functionally distinct isoforms from a single gene by use of different combinations of splice junctions. For example, alternative splicing within the DNA binding domain of Pax-6 (4) and Wilm's tumor-associated protein 1 (5) alters their DNA binding specificity. Alternative splicing of the transactivation domains in Pax-8 (6), the POU homeodomain family protein Pit-1 (7), and the zinc finger transcription factor GATA-5 (8) results in isoforms possessing different activation potencies. Deletion of the activation domain in AML1a (9) and CREB (10) by splicing produces variants with dominant negative activity. Thus, additional genetic complexity and diversity might be accomplished by altering regulatory properties through expression of alternatively spliced isoforms of transcription factor.

Transcriptional repressor activating transcription factor 3 (ATF3) is one of the immediate early response genes (11-14). It is induced upon exposure of cells to a variety of physiological and pathological stimuli, including seizure, toxic chemicals such as carbon tetrachloride (15), anti-cancer drugs (16), proteasome inhibitor (17), genotoxic agents (18), homocysteine (19) and ischemia-coupled with reperfusion (20). ATF3 is also rapidly induced in regenerating liver (12), or in cells treated by growth-stimulating factors such as serum (21,22). Furthermore, it is over-expressed in murine melanoma cells with high metastatic potentials (23), or esophageal cancer cells (24). Thus, ATF3 functions in both cellular stress response and cell proliferation.

ATF3 is composed of 181 amino acids and the region from amino acid 40 to 84 has been reported to have the transcriptional repression activity (25). The basic/leucine zipper (bZip) domain from 88 to 147 amino acids is required for dimer formation and specific DNA binding (21,25). ATF3 forms homodimer with itself and the resulting dimer represses transcription from various promoters with ATF sites (21). In addition, this ATF3 homodimer has been demonstrated to repress tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha-induced E-selectin gene expression (26), and arsenite-induced GADD153 gene expression (27,28). ATF3 also forms dimers with other bZip proteins. Heterodimers of ATF3 with c-Jun and JunB have been reported to activate transcription in transient transfection assays (25). Interestingly, adenovirus E1A induces the expression of ATF3 and leads to the formation of c-Jun/ATF3 heterodimer. Significantly, this activity of E1A is thought to play a role in its ability to transform cells (29). Therefore, ATF3 can activate or repress target genes by forming homo- or heteromeric complexes, and some of these activities have been implicated in significant biological functions.

Previously, an alternative spliced isoform ATF3DeltaZip was isolated from HeLa cells stimulated by serum (21). It lacks the leucine zipper domain and does not bind to the ATF/CRE sequence, but stimulates transcription of reporter driven by promoters with or without ATF/CRE motif, presumably by sequestering co-inhibitory factors away from the promoters (21). Thus, ATF3DeltaZip regulates the expression of target genes. However, the functional significance of the alternative splice variants, or the presence of other forms of truncated ATF3 remains largely unknown.

In this report, we describe a novel form of alternatively spliced ATF3DeltaZip2 and characterized its expression in stress response and in cancer cells. ATF3DeltaZip2 expression was highly induced by various stress stimuli, but not in cancer cells over-expressing ATF3. It may regulate gene expression of cells in response to stress stimuli.

Resultant expression plasmids, pEGFP-ATF3DeltaZip2 and pHA-ATF3DeltaZip2, encoded the ATF3DeltaZip2 protein that was N-terminally fused to GFP and HA peptide, respectively. Each plasmid (1 microg) for ATF3DeltaZip2 and pCIATF3 (1 microg) for full-length ATF3 was transfected into Cos-7 cells using Superfect (Qiagen) as described (19). At 24 h post-transfection, ATF3DeltaZip2 and ATF3 were detected by GFP fluorescence or immunostaining using mouse monoclonal anti-HA antibody and anti-ATF3 antibody, respectively. For counter-staining of nuclei, cells were also stained by DAPI.

Cos-7 cells (3 x 105 cells) grown in RPMI medium to 70-80% confluency in a 35 mm dish were cotransfected with pLuc-4xATF and effector plasmids as indicated. At 24 h post-transfection, the supernatant of cell extracts was assayed for firefly and sea pansy luciferase activity using a dual luciferase reporter assay system (Promega) as described (19). pRL-CMV (Toyo Ink, Tokyo, Japan) containing the sea pansy luciferase gene was used as an internal control of transfection and expression.

We previously reported that ATF3 expression is induced in HUVECs by homocysteine and various stimuli (19). During our analysis by RT-PCR using a pair of primers, primer 5' and primer 3' indicated in Figure 1A, we observed two bands of 858 and 767 bp in addition to the 546 bp full-length ATF3 mRNA in HUVECs after treatment with A23187 (Fig. 1B, lane 3). To test whether these are alternative spliced mRNAs containing the exon D described previously (21), we performed PCR using primer 5' and primer Zip3 localized in exon D (Fig. 1A). As shown in Figure 1B, lane 6, a band of 554 bp was produced, suggesting the presence of an alternatively spliced mRNA containing exon D. However, because two alternatively spliced isoforms were expected from the two bands observed above (858 and 767 bp), we suspected that this pair of primers failed to distinguish the isoforms. Sequence analysis of this PCR product (554 bp) revealed a previously unknown exon, designated as exon D' in this report (Figs 1A and 2). We then designed a primer called primer Zip4 from the new exon, and performed PCR using primer Zip4 and primer 3'. As shown in Figure 1B, lane 9, two bands of 510 and 419 bp were amplified. These bands were produced after reverse transcription using oligo-dT primer, suggesting that the bands were alternative splice variants. Therefore, we determined the sequence of these RT-PCR products and compared them with that of the human ATF3 gene. Results showed that the additional two bands in Figure 1B represented alternatively spliced isoforms of ATF3 mRNA. We named them ATF3DeltaZip2a and b. As shown in Figure 2A, both isoforms utilized a novel 3'-acceptor site in the intron C that is at 76 bases upstream from exon D. Therefore, this 76 base sequence was designated as exon D' in this study. ATF3DeltaZip2a and b, however, differed in the splicing between exons D and E. Splicing of intron D occurred in ATF3DeltaZip2b as in the full ATF3, but no splicing was observed in ATF3DeltaZip2a, which was amplified as a 91 bp larger fragment than ATF3DeltaZip2b in RT-PCR analysis (Figs 1B and 2A). This 91 bp sequence was the same as the intron D sequence in the human ATF3 gene (BAC RP11-248, accession no. AL606913 in the BAC draft sequence).

In Figure 2, the nucleotide and predicted amino acid sequence of ATF3DeltaZip2a and b were aligned and compared with those of full-length ATF3 and ATF3DeltaZip. Both variants of ATF3DeltaZip2 encoded the same protein composed of 135 amino acids, among which 1-115 amino acids are common to those of full-length ATF3 and ATF3DeltaZip (Fig. 2B). At the C-terminal, the ATF3DeltaZip2 protein contained the basic region but deleted the leucine zipper domain, which was replaced by a novel sequence of 20 amino acids. Therefore, ATF3DeltaZip2 is a C-terminally truncated protein.

As the first step to understand the significance of ATF3DeltaZip2 in vivo, we performed semi-quantitative analysis of the relative expression of ATF3DeltaZip2. Figure 3 shows a representative RT-PCR analysis of the A23187-treated HUVECs using primer 5' and primer 3'. The amount of PCR products was analyzed at every two cycles from the 16th to the 24th cycle, and the density of each band was compared. The combined amount of mRNAs for ATF3DeltaZip2a and b was 34 +/- 4% compared with that of full-length ATF3, based on the data at linear range of amplification from the 18th to the 22nd cycle. This indicates that the induction of ATF3DeltaZip2 is approximately one- third of that for full-length ATF3. We further examined whether ATF3DeltaZip, which is induced in serum-stimulated HeLa cells (21), was present in the A23187-treated cells. RT-PCR using a pair of primer 5' and Zip3 for amplifying both ATF3DeltaZip and DeltaZip2, followed by sequence determination, could not detect ATF3DeltaZip (data not shown). Thus, A23187 treatment selectively induced the expression of ATF3DeltaZip2, but not of ATF3DeltaZip. These data indicate that ATF3DeltaZip2 is the major alternatively spliced isoform in the A23187-treated HUVECs.

We next examined whether ATF3DeltaZip2 protein was expressed in the A23187-treated HUVECs. Western blot analysis showed that the full-length ATF3 and a protein of lower molecular weight were induced after treatment with A23187 (Fig. 4, lane 3), while these bands were not detected in control cells (lane 2). The lower band showed the same migration mobility as the Flag-tagged ATF3DeltaZip2 (lanes 3 and 4). We note that the anti-ATF3 antibody used in this experiment was generated against the full-length ATF3 protein (21). It could recognize the N-terminal portion of ATF3 and thus both the full-length ATF3 and the ATF2DeltaZip2 proteins. It also detected a non-specific band around 35 kDa in HUVEC cell extracts. The anti-ATF3 antibody C-19 (from Santa Cruz) recognizes the C-terminal region of ATF3 and could not detect the ATF3DeltaZip2 protein (data not shown). These results indicate that ATF3DeltaZip2 protein is expressed in the A23187-treated HUVECs.

To obtain evidence for possible gene regulation by ATF3DeltaZip2, we expressed it as GST fusion protein in E.coli, and tested its DNA binding activity. Figure 5 shows that the full-length ATF3-GST fusion protein formed the protein-DNA complex that was specifically abolished by the wild-type ATF/CRE motif, but not by the mutant sequence (lanes 2-5). In contrast, GST-ATF3DeltaZip2 did not yield a DNA-protein complex, indicating that ATF3DeltaZip2 protein is not capable of binding to the ATF/CRE sequence. Next, we sought to determine subcellular localization of ATF3DeltaZip2 protein. For this purpose, we transiently expressed ATF3DeltaZip2 in Cos-7 cells and examined its localization by immunostaining. Figure 6 shows that ATF3DeltaZip2 was localized in nuclei when it was fused to GFP or HA epitope. Full-length ATF3 and ATF3DeltaZip were also localized in nuclei in this assay (data not shown). These data clearly indicate that ATF3DeltaZip2 protein is present in nuclei.

We next determined whether ATF3DeltaZip2 is capable of regulating gene transcription since ATF3DeltaZip is reported to stimulate transcription, presumably by sequestering co-inhibitory factors away from the promoters (21). Thus, we tested whether ATF3DeltaZip2 could affect gene expression in a reporter assay. Figure 7 shows that full-length ATF3 repressed the expression of reporter gene containing four repeats of the ATF/CRE motif, while ATF3DeltaZip2 alone had no effect. However, when ATF3DeltaZip2 was co-expressed with full ATF3, it remarkably counteracted the repression by the full-length ATF3 and further stimulated the reporter activity. Since there was no significant difference between the raw and normalized luciferase activity, this result is consistent with that for ATF3DeltaZip (21). The data clearly indicate that ATF3DeltaZip2 is capable of regulating the ATF/CRE-dependent gene expression.

The expression of ATF3 is induced by a wide range of pathophysiological stimuli (13,15). Thus, we investigated whether the expression of ATF3DeltaZip2 is also induced by stress stimuli other than A23187. Figure 8A shows that both full-length ATF3 and ATF3DeltaZip2 were induced in HUVECs after treatment by several stimuli including homocysteine, thapsigargin, tunicamycin, hydrogen peroxide and TNF-alpha, although the level of ATF3DeltaZip2 mRNA was variable and most significant in the A23187-treated cells. In Saos2 cells, these stimuli also induced ATF3DeltaZip2 (Fig. 8B, lanes 3-7). We further examined the effect of MMS, MG132 and colchicine, because these agents can induce ATF3 (16-18). As shown in Figure 8B, lanes 9-11, these agents induced both ATF3 and ATF3DeltaZip2. It is also reported that the expression of ATF3 is elevated in several cancer cells and that its expression correlates with high metastatic potency (23,24). Thus, several esophageal cancer cells that exhibit high expression of ATF3 were examined. Figure 8C shows that the ATF3DeltaZip2 mRNA was not detectable in these cancer cells. Taken together, our results indicate that, although ATF3DeltaZip2 is co-induced with the full-length ATF3 by many stress stimuli, it is not co-expressed with ATF3 in these esophageal cancer cells.

Alternative splicing is a powerful and versatile regulatory mechanism that affects gene expression and results in functional diversification of proteins. The primary transcript encoding the ATF3 protein is alternatively spliced to produce ATF3DeltaZip2, which is produced through the activation of alternative splicing between the 5' donor site of intron C and the novel 3' acceptor site in intron C (Fig. 2). We also showed that the truncated ATF3 protein that had the same mobility as ATF3DeltaZip2 was expressed in response to stress stimuli (Fig. 4), providing evidence that ATF3DeltaZip2 mRNA could be translated into a protein. This is of particular importance since mRNA harboring a premature stop codon might be subject to nonsense-mediated decay, resulting in the translational repression of mRNA (34,35). Nonsense-mediated decay of mRNA is most likely to occur when the premature termination codon is present upstream of the most 3' exon-exon junction (34). We speculate that ATF3DeltaZip2a mRNA is not a target of decay since its termination codon is present downstream of the most 3' exon-exon junction (Fig. 2). In contrast, ATF3DeltaZip2b mRNA could be a target of decay since the nonsense codon is present upstream of junction of exon D and E. However, more investigation is required to determine whether ATF3DeltaZip2 mRNA is subject to the decay system.

The expression of ATF3DeltaZip2 was induced in cells exposed to various stimuli. These include a wide range of agents, such as genotoxic agents, proteasome inhibitors, oxidative stress, agents that perturb calcium homeostasis, inhibitors of N-glycosylation, and proinflammatory cytokines. Some of these agents, A23187, thapsigargin, tunicamycin and homocysteine, are inducers of endoplasmic reticulum stress and cause the unfolded protein response. Since all the stress stimuli described in this study also induced the full-length ATF3, what is the biological function of co-inducing ATF3DeltaZip2 during stress response? ATF3DeltaZip2 lacks the leucine zipper domain and is incapable of binding to the ATF/CRE motif. Thus, it is defective in forming heteromeric complexes with other factors, such as c-Jun, JunB, ATF2 or GADD153. As shown in Figure 7, ATF3DeltaZip2 rescued the reporter activity repressed by the full-length ATF3 in a transient transfection assay. However, when the amount of DNA encoding ATF3DeltaZip2 was increased, it stimulated the reporter activity. This is consistent with the inhibitory co-factor model proposed previously (21). In that model, ATF3 represses promoters with the ATF/CRE sites by stabilizing the inhibitory co-factors at the promoters. When not bound to DNA, however, ATF3 could sequester the inhibitory co-factors away from the promoters, resulting in stimulation of transcription (21). Since ATF3DeltaZip2 is similar to ATF3DeltaZip in that it does not bind to the ATF/CRE sites, our results of stimulation of transcription by ATF3DeltaZip2 may be consistent with the model. It is thus possible that one function of co-inducing ATF3DeltaZip2 is to modulate the transcriptional effects of the full-length ATF3 during stress. Co-induction of alternatively spliced mRNAs that encode proteins with opposite functions has been described previously. One example is the co-induction of DeltaFosB with full-length FosB (36). DeltaFosB lacks the C-terminal region of FosB and inhibits the function of FosB and other Fos proteins (36). The counteracting effect of ATF3DeltaZip2 on ATF3 brings up an important question. What is the physiological significance of ATF3 expression during stress response? Although the answer is not clear, one notion is that ATF3 contributes to the detrimental consequences of stress response (13,15). This notion is mainly derived from the ectopic expression approach. Transgenic mice expressing ATF3 in selective tissues have been demonstrated to have malfunction in the target tissues. As an example, transgenic mice expressing ATF3 in the pancreas have a defect in endocrine function and develop symptoms characteristic of insulin-dependent diabetes (37). Furthermore, transgenic mice expressing ATF3 in the heart have conduction abnormality and contractile dysfunction (38). Therefore, ATF3 appears to be a part of the cellular response that leads to detrimental outcomes. Due to the intrinsic limitations of the transgenic approach, experiments using different approaches are required to substantiate this notion. However, if the full-length ATF3 protein is indeed a detrimental component of stress response, then the co-induction of ATF3DeltaZip2 may be a part of the efforts to alleviate the detrimental consequence.

In this context, we note that ATF3 is also induced by signals that induce cell proliferation (12-14) and is expressed in certain cancer cells (23,24). Recently, ATF3 was shown to partially transform chick embryo fibroblasts by promoting growth factor-independent proliferation (39). It is intriguing that ATF3 expression correlates with high potentials of metastasis in murine melanoma cells (23), and its down-regulation by anti-sense oligonucleotides effectively suppressed the growth of human colon cancer cells in mice (40). In our study, very little or no expression of ATF3DeltaZip2 was observed in cancer cells that over-express the full-length ATF3. Therefore, the lack of a built-in mechanism to modulate the activities of the full-length ATF3 protein may be a part of the differences that distinguish cancer cells from cells eliciting stress response. However, at present, it is not known whether this discrepancy of expression of ATF3 and ATF3DeltaZip2 has a functional role in cell proliferation.

In summary, our demonstration of a novel alternative spliced ATF3DeltaZip2 provides a molecular basis for diverse functions of the immediate early response gene ATF3, and strengthens the pivotal role of alternative splicing during the stress response. Furthermore, this might provide a clue to investigating the molecular device for controlling the stress response and cell proliferation.

 RT-PCR analysis of ATF3DeltaZip2 mRNA in A23187-treated HUVECs. (A) Primers used in this study and their locations in the human ATF3 gene are shown. Exons are indicated by boxes, and labeled as A, B, C, D and E as in Liang et al. (33). Exons D' and E' are novel ones described in the text. Initiation codon ATG in exon B is shown under primer 5'. Stop codons for the full-length ATF3 (*), ATF3DeltaZip (*1) and ATF3DeltaZip2 (*2) are shown. (B) HUVECs (3 x 105 cells) were treated with 10 microM A23187 for 4 h, and total RNA (1 microg) was assayed for RT-PCR using primer 5' and primer 3' (lanes 1-3), primer 5' and primer Zip3 (lanes 4-6), or primer Zip4 and primer 3' (lanes 7-9). Lanes 1, 4 and 7 are derived from untreated cells; all the other lanes are from A23187-treated cells with (lanes 3, 6 and 9) or without (lanes 2, 5 and 8) RT. Bands of 546, 858 and 767 bp represented products of full-length ATF3, ATF3DeltaZip2a and ATF3DeltaZip2b, respectively (lane 3). 554 bp was the product derived from ATF3DeltaZip2a and b (lane 6); note that the primer set used in this experiment (primer 5' and primer Zip3) does not distinguish ATF3DeltaZip2a from ATF3DeltaZip2b. 510 and 419 bp represented ATF3DeltaZip2a and ATF3DeltaZip2b, respectively (lane 9). M, the 123 bp DNA size marker.

 Splicing events for generating ATF3DeltaZip2a and b and comparison of their nucleotide and amino acid sequences. (A) Splicing events for generating ATF3DeltaZip2a and b and their nucleotide and amino acid sequences are compared with those for full-length ATF3 and ATF3DeltaZip as described in Liang et al. (33). Exon D' is comprised of a 76 base sequence of intron C (shaded squares) that precedes exon D. Exon E' is an original intron D of 91 bp (dotted square) and transcribed into ATF3DeltaZip2a mRNA. Leucine residues in the zipper region were marked. (B) Schematic representations of the full-length ATF3, ATF3DeltaZip and ATF3DeltaZip2 are shown. Basic, Zip, A and R represent the basic, leucine zipper, activation, repression region, respectively (21).

 Semi-quantitative measurement of ATF3DeltaZip2 and full ATF3 mRNA. Total RNA (1 microg) from the A23187-treated HUVECs was subjected to RT-PCR using primer 5' and primer 3' and the expression of full ATF3 and ATF3DeltaZip2 was measured at various cycles of PCR. A typical experiment is shown in (A). In (B), the logarithm of density of each band was plotted against the number of PCR cycles, and the ratio of expression of ATF3DeltaZip2 to full ATF3 was determined from data at the linear amplification range of PCR. Results were means +/- SE bars of three independent experiments. The amount of ATF3DeltaZip2 represents a total of ATF3DeltaZip2a and b.
