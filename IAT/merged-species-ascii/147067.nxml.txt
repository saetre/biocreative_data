The PR264/SC35 splicing factor belongs to the family of SR proteins which function as essential and alternative splicing factors. Here, we report that the human PR264/SC35 locus is bidirectionally transcribed. Double in situ hybridization experiments have allowed simultaneous detection of sense and antisense RNA in human CCRF-CEM cells, suggesting that expression of the corresponding genes is not mutually exclusive. We have characterized three main classes of ET RNAs encoded by the opposite strand of the PR264/SC35 gene and containing PR264/SC35-overlapping sequences, PR264/SC35-non overlapping sequences or a combination of both. We show that their expression results from the use of alternative promoters, exons and polyadenylation signals. PR264/SC35-non overlapping ET mRNA species potentially encode two protein isoforms (449 and 397 amino acids) and are expressed from the PR264/SC35 promoting region. Northern blots and RNase protection analyses indicate that ET polyadenylated RNAs are differentially expressed in several human cell lines. Similar studies performed in the mouse have revealed that the bidirectional transcription of the PR264/SC35 locus is a conserved mechanism and that the open reading frame identified in a subset of human ET mRNAs is highly conserved (93% homology). Northern blot analyses performed with several murine tissues confirmed the differential expression of the ET gene and revealed that it is predominantly expressed in the testis.
