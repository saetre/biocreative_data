Background

###begin p 3
Oestrogen receptor beta (ERbeta) modulates ERalpha activity; wild type ERbeta (ERbeta1) and its splice variants may therefore impact on hormone responsiveness of breast cancer. ERbeta2/ERbetacx acts as a dominant negative inhibitor of ERalpha and expression of ERbeta2 mRNA has been proposed as a candidate marker for outcome in primary breast cancer following adjuvant endocrine therapy. We therefore now assess ERbeta2 protein by immunostaining and mRNA by quantitative RT-PCR in relation to treatment outcome.

###begin p 5
ERbeta2-specific immunostaining was quantified in 141 primary breast cancer cases receiving adjuvant endocrine therapy, but no neoadjuvant therapy or adjuvant chemotherapy. The expression of mRNA for ERbeta2/ERbetacx was measured in 100 cases by quantitative RT-PCR. Statistical analysis of breast cancer relapse and breast cancer survival was performed using Kaplan Meier log-rank tests and Cox's univariate and multivariate survival analysis.

Results

###begin p 7
High ERbeta2 immunostaining (Allred score >5) and high ERbeta2 mRNA levels were independently associated with significantly better outcome across the whole cohort, including both ERalpha positive and negative cases (Log-Rank P < 0.05). However, only ERbeta2 mRNA levels were significantly associated with better outcome in the ERalpha + subgroup (Log-Rank P = 0.01) and this was independent of grade, size, nodal status and progesterone receptor status (Cox hazard ratio 0.31 P = 0.02 for relapse; 0.17 P = 0.01 for survival). High ERbeta2 mRNA was also associated with better outcome in node negative cases (Log Rank P < 0.001).
###end p 7
###begin p 8
ERbeta2 protein levels were greater in ERalpha positive cases (T-test P = 0.00001), possibly explaining the association with better outcome. Levels of ERbeta2 protein did not correlate ERbeta2 mRNA levels, but 34% of cases had both high mRNA and protein and had a significantly better outcome (Log-Rank relapse P < 0.005).

Conclusion
###end title 9
###begin p 10
High ERbeta2 protein levels were associated with ERalpha expression. Although most cases with high ERbeta2 mRNA had strong ERbeta2 immunostaining, mRNA levels but not protein levels were independently predictive of outcome in tamoxifen-treated ERalpha + tumours. Post-transcriptional control needs to be considered when assessing the biological or clinical importance of ERbeta proteins.

Oestrogen Receptor alpha (ERalpha) is an accepted prognostic marker in breast cancer and is used to plan adjuvant endocrine treatment (e.g. use of the anti-oestrogen tamoxifen). The majority of the breast cancers are positive for ERalpha (ERalpha+), but not all patients with ERalpha+ cancer respond to endocrine therapy and many subsequently succumb to local relapse or metastasis. The failure of some breast cancers to respond to tamoxifen, currently the most common adjuvant endocrine treatment, is a major clinical problem and several resistance mechanisms have been elucidated [1,2].

ERbeta and its splice variants are differentially expressed in a variety of normal tissues and cancers including breast [3,4], but not all published studies are in agreement about the role of ERbeta isoforms in breast cancer [4-13]. The ERbeta2/ERbetacx variant arises from alternative splicing of the last ERbeta exon. This produces a truncated ERbeta protein unable to bind oestradiol as a result of a disorientated helix12 in the ligand binding domain [14,15]. ERbeta2 acts as a dominant negative modulator of ERalpha [14,16] and therefore might be expected to have a protective effect in breast tumorigenesis or outcome, at least for ERalpha + breast cancer.
###end p 13

Further verification of ERbeta variants, including ERbeta2, as potential clinical markers is still required. Many previous studies make use of mRNA levels as a surrogate marker for ERbeta protein expression and few have attempted to relate mRNA to protein levels. Other studies that do assess the expression of ERbeta protein use techniques that rely on detection of N-terminal epitopes that are shared by most variants. A good proportion of studies also fail to take into account menopausal status, stage of the disease or the treatment given.

We have previously identified ERbeta2 mRNA levels as being more closely associated with treatment outcome than mRNA levels of ERbeta1 or ERbeta5 [17] in a treatment-specific cohort of postmenopausal women receiving adjuvant endocrine treatment but not chemotherapy. However in the same setting, mRNA levels for the wild-type ERbeta1 isoform do not correlate well with protein levels [9]. With the aim of clarifying the significance of ERbeta2 expression in tamoxifen response and investigating the relationship between ERbeta2 mRNA and protein levels, we have therefore set out to evaluate both expression of ERbeta2 protein by immunostaining and expression of ERbeta2 mRNA by quantitative RTPCR (qRTPCR). Our hypothesis was that ERbeta2 may be associated with outcome following adjuvant tamoxifen treatment of breast cancers and therefore be useful as a predictive marker or give some insight into mechanisms of resistance.
###end p 15
###begin p 16
We were able to confirm a significant association of both high ERbeta2 protein and high mRNA levels with good outcome, but ERbeta2 protein levels were not a useful marker of outcome. Strong ERbeta2 staining was associated with better outcome, but not independently of ERalpha. Although ERbeta2 mRNA and protein levels did not correlate with each other, approximately one third of cases (34%) were seen to have both high mRNA and high protein levels; these had a significantly better outcome than the other cases, so ERbeta2 protein may have a role in improved outcome for a subset of breast cancers.

Patients undergoing treatment for invasive breast cancer during the period 1993 and 1999 at the Royal Liverpool University Hospital were identified from a database at the Cancer Tissue Bank Research Centre (CTBRC), University of Liverpool [9]. A total of 141 postmenopausal patients (Table 1) with primary breast cancer were selected, median age was 68 years (range 47-87). They had been treated by surgery (47 mastectomy, 94 wide local excision) and radiotherapy (70 cases), but had not received systemic chemotherapy or primary endocrine therapy. All patients received adjuvant endocrine therapy; either tamoxifen (n = 133) or as part of the ATAC trial (n = 8). Clinical and histological characteristics are summarized in Table 1. ERalpha and progesterone receptor (PgR) status was obtained from review of histopathology notes or determined immunohistochemically using a cut-off of 10% positive cells [9]. Ki67 immunostaining was reported previously as % positive tumour cells [9]. Clinical follow-up data was recorded by retrospective case-note review with data from surviving patients censored at the date last seen. Outcome measures were breast cancer relapse (BCR) and breast cancer survival (BCS). Median follow-up was 71 months for BCR (range 9 to 113) and 79 months for BCS (range 11 to 113). Ethical approval for the study was obtained from The Liverpool Adult Research Ethics Committee (Reference 01/116), who also approved the collection of samples by the CTBRC with informed consent.

Based on estimates of proportions of ERbeta2 positive cases from our previous study [17] and available outcome data, we determined that this study would have 80% power with an alpha value of 0.05 to detect a hazard ratio below 0.73 or above 1.40 in the whole cohort (below 0.63 or above 1.74 in the ERalpha + cohort), which we considered appropriate to give an indication of clinical utility.

Histological sections (4 mum) were cut from the formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded specimens, placed onto 3-aminopropyltriethoxysilane-coated slides and endogenous peroxidase activity was blocked using 3% (v/v) hydrogen peroxide. Tissues were subjected to antigen retrieval by microwaving for 10 minutes in antigen unmasking solution (H3300, Vector Laboratories Ltd., Peterborough, UK). Slides were pre-incubated in Protein Block Serum-Free (DakoCytomation, Ely, UK) for 10 minutes. Immunostaining for ERbeta2 was performed overnight at 4degreesC with mouse anti-human ERbeta2 monoclonal antibody MCA2279S (clone no 57/3, Serotec; raised to the unique C-terminal region [18] and previously used for breast tumour staining [4]), diluted 1 in 25 in 0.1% (w/v) BSA, 50 mM Tris, 15 mM NaCl, pH7.6. The bound antibodies were detected using the DAKO LSAB2 system, according to manufacturer's recommendations (DakoCytomation). The bound antibodies were visualized as a brown stain by incubating with DAB chromogen (Sigma-Aldrich, Gillingham, UK). Sections were counterstained with Mayers' Haemotaxylin (Sigma-Aldrich) and mounted in DPX (Merck, Dorset, UK). In controls the ERbeta2 antibody was preincubated with a molar excess of immunising synthetic peptide (CMKMETLLPEATMEQ [18]) prior to application to sections from positively-staining specimens. Nuclear staining was abolished in these blocked controls, but some cytoplasmic staining remained. Scoring of tumour sections was performed for nuclear staining only. Stained slides were analysed independently by two observers (RV and VA) using light microscopy; the percentage of positively stained malignant cells was estimated (%+) as was the staining intensity, an immuno-score (Allred) was calculated according to the Allred system [19].

RNA of suitable quality for 100 cases was obtained from the CTBRC; testis RNA (Promega, Southhampton, UK) and MCF7 cell line RNA were used as positive controls. Cases were selected for RNA analysis following independent histological review of adjacent sections, so as to avoid high levels of tissue heterogeneity. Samples from all cases consisted of at least 75% tumour cells and 67% of cases had at least 90% tumour cells. Inflammatory infiltrates were present in a minority of cases (at 10% in 15 cases and at 25% in 4 cases).

Reverse transcription was performed in duplicate as described previously with oligo-dT primers [17], but using 1.5 mug total RNA and Superscript III reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen, Paisley, UK). Quantitative PCR for ERbeta2 was performed on a Bio-Rad Icycler Real-Time PCR machine (Bio-Rad Laboratories Ltd., Hertfordshire, U.K.) using 4 mu1 of a 1/2 dilution of cDNA per reaction (equivalent to cDNA from approximately 150 ng of total RNA). ERbeta2 PCR reactions included 1x IQ Supermix (Bio-Rad) and PCR primers and a Taqman probe (as given in Table 2). For control gene PCR (HPRT, GAPDH) and ERalpha 4 mul of a 1/50 dilution was used and the reaction contained IQ SYBR Green Supermix (Bio-Rad). The PCR reactions consisted of a hot-start Taq Polymerase activation step of 95degreesC for 3 minutes, followed by conditions shown to be produce unique, specific bands for each mRNA (Table 2). Expression levels of mRNA for each gene were calculated using standard curves produced with the relevant cloned cDNAs and correcting for the control genes (HPRT and GAPDH). All amplicons crossed introns to avoid amplification of genomic DNA and the identity of PCR products was confirmed by agarose gel electrophoresis and DNA sequence analysis, as described previously [17].

Power calculations were performed using the PS program [20] with survival analysis implementation of Schoenfeld and Richter [21]. All other statistical analyses were performed using the SPSS package (Windows, v.11). The degree of agreement for immunostaining between observers was assessed using the Kappa statistic. Pearson correlation and Spearman's rank correlation were used as measures of association. Student's T-test and the Mann-Whitney U test (MW) were used to compare between groups of cases defined by other variables; for paired data paired T-tests and Wilcoxon signed ranks tests were used. Optimal cut-points for continuous variables were determined using Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) plots for BCR and BCS at 5 years after surgery. Curves for outcome were generated using the Kaplan-Meier method for censored data, with surviving patients' data being censored at the date of their last clinic visit, and were compared using the Log Rank test. Unadjusted hazard ratios (HR) +/- 95% confidence intervals (CI) were obtained using Cox's univariate analysis. Cox's regression model was used for multivariate survival analysis. For outcome analysis grade was dichotomised as grade 3 vs. other grades, size was dichotomised as T1 vs. other sizes.

Previous assessments of the role of ERbeta2 in breast cancer treatment outcome have been limited, with most clinical studies being performed in broader groups of patients and focussing on other associations, largely related to pathology. Our own previous data [17] was based on a semi-quantitative RTPCR analysis using an assay in which ERbeta5 is co-amplified with ERbeta2 and distinguished based on size of the PCR product, similar to the triple-primer assay used elsewhere [22,23]. We found that, using the arbitrary cut-off imposed by detection sensitivity, ERbeta2 mRNA expression was more closely associated with survival benefit than ERbeta1 or ERbeta5 mRNA expression. We therefore set out to establish whether ERbeta2 protein levels similarly predicted patient outcome. We defined discriminatory cut-points of ERbeta2 levels in a non-arbitrary manner, using ROC analysis, and used these to assess the relationship between ERbeta2 expression and outcome.

A cohort of 141 cases were stained by immunohistochemistry for ERbeta2 (Table 1) including 98 ERalpha + cases. ERbeta2 staining was assessed by 2 observers (R.V., V.A.) using the Allred scoring system and also as percentage positive cells (%+), with good agreement between observers (Allred Spearman 0.91 P = 1.0 x 106, %+ Pearson 0.92 P = 3.4 x 1059). At the cut-point used for outcome analysis the Kappa score was 0.87. A consensus score was produced and used herein, representative examples of immunostaining are shown in Figure 1. The frequencies of each score were: score 0, 2 cases (1.4%); 3, 3 cases (2.1%); 4, 9 cases (6.4%); 5, 27 cases (19.1%); 6, 39 cases (27.7%); 7, 61 cases (43.3%).

ERbeta2 immunostaining significantly correlated with that for ERalpha (%+ Pearson 0.42 P = 7.8 x 107, Allred Spearman 0.40 P = 4.1 x 106) and to a lesser extent PgR (%+ Pearson 0.18 P = 0.035). ERbeta2 immunostaining was greater in ERalpha + cases (mean %+ = 69) than in ERalpha- cases (mean %+ = 52; P = 0.00001 T-test) and ERbeta2 Allred score was greater in PgR+ cases than PgR- cases (P = 0.033 MW). The percentage of ERbeta2 positive cells were somewhat lower in grade 3 cases (P = 0.042 MW), in keeping with the association with ERalpha status. There was no association with Ki67 staining, vascular invasion, nodal status, age or size, or with ERbeta1-specific immunostaining [9]; most previous studies have similarly failed to show clear links to many clinical and pathological parameters.

The association seen here between ERbeta2 and ERalpha has not always been seen by others. Although case selection and clinical setting may have some bearing on this, it is also possible that such correlations are due to better tissue preservation of antigens in some blocks of tissue. We do not think that this is the case here, as in the same cohort ERalpha but not ERbeta2 inversely correlated with p53 immunostaining (unpublished data) and ERalpha did not correlate with ERbeta1 [9]. If antigen preservation was a major influence on immunostaining patterns it is unlikely that such complex inter-relationships would be evident.

ERbeta2 status significantly associated with ERalpha status (P = 0.001 Chi square) and within the subgroup of ERalpha positive women who received adjuvant tamoxifen there were 18 ERbeta2 low cases and 67 ERbeta2 high cases (79%).

Within the group as a whole (ERalpha + and ERalpha- cases), high ERbeta2 protein levels were significantly related to a better relapse free survival (BCR P = 0.049 Log Rank, Figure 2), but not breast cancer survival (BCS P = 0.16, Figure 3). However, in both cases the survival curves converge at later time-points; with shorter follow-up time a stronger relationship with outcome was seen (5-year BCR P = 0.018 Log Rank, HR 0.50 CI 0.27-0.90 P = 0.020; 7 year BCS P = 0.048 Log Rank, HR 0.50 CI 0.27-0.90 P = 0.020).

When ERalpha status and ERbeta2 immunoscore were included as the only two variables in multivariate analysis of 5 year BCR, ERalpha status was independently significant (HR 0.38 CI 0.22-0.66 P = 0.001) whereas ERbeta2 did not retain independent significance (HR 0.76 CI 0.43-1.33 P = 0.33). When ERbeta2 immunoscore, ERalpha, grade, size and nodal status were included in this multivariate analysis, only nodal status (HR 3.1 CI 1.5-6.2 P = 0.001) and grade (HR 1.5 CI 1.1-2.2 P = 0.026) were independently significant. When considering only ERalpha +, tamoxifen-treated cases there was no relationship between ERbeta2 immunostaining at outcome (BCR P = 0.95, BCS P = 0.65 Log Rank).

One previous study of only 50 ERalpha positive cases using immunostaining with a different antibody raised to the same ERbeta2-specific epitope [7] similarly failed to show any predictive association with adjuvant tamoxifen treatment. However this analysis was based on detecting differences in staining between "sensitive" and "resistant" cases using the crude measure of relapse within 5 years of tamoxifen therapy. Unpublished observations [12] also failed to show any predictive value in an adjuvant setting and a similar lack of association between ERbeta2 immunostaining and outcome has recently been demonstrated in the neoadjuvant setting [4]. Hence the early outcome benefit seen with strong ERbeta2 immunostaining was not identified previously. However, an association of ERbeta2 protein with a favourable outcome has been seen in a metastatic and locally advanced setting [10]. In this case, not only was the clinical setting different, but ERbeta2 was assessed by western blot. Therefore the present study is the largest to date to assess immunostaining of ERbeta2 as a predictive marker of outcome in the postmenopausal, adjuvant endocrine setting. Results indicate that ERbeta2 protein levels did not apparently relate closely to outcome for ERalpha + cases. Rather there was some association of ERbeta2 immunostaining with better outcome in broader cohorts of patients (including ERalpha- cases), due in part to a correlation between ERalpha and ERbeta2 protein levels.

ERbeta2 immunostaining results are at odds with previous semi-quantitative RTPCR results. We therefore performed a repeat RTPCR analysis on a larger series of patients, but with fully quantitative RTPCR using independent cDNA synthesis reactions and different splice variant specific PCR conditions. A subgroup of 100 cases (Table 1) with suitable quality mRNA available were used in qRTPCR for ERbeta2, ERalpha and control genes HPRT and GAPDH. Expression of ERbeta2 mRNA (mean 0.006 attomoles per mug total RNA) was significantly lower (P < 106 paired T-test) than that of ERalpha (mean 25 attomoles per mug total RNA). These low levels of ERbeta mRNA (also seen with ERbeta1 and ERbeta5, results not shown) may contribute to technical difficulties in reproducibly measuring ERbeta variants and hence to the lack of consistency between different studies.

In the 100 case (ERalpha + and ERalpha -) qRTPCR cohort (Table 1), high grade (BCR & BCS P </= 0.001), positive nodal status (BCR & BCS P </= 0.0005), larger size (BCS P = 0.042), ERalpha negative status (BCR P = 0.009, BCS P = 0.041) and PgR negative status (BCR P = 0.032, BCS P = 0.026) were all associated with poor outcome (Log Rank). Using an ROC-derived optimal cut-point (0.0040 attomoles per mug total RNA) for this 100 case cohort in Kaplan Meier Log Rank analysis, there was a significant association between higher ERbeta2 mRNA expression and good outcome (BCR P = 0.046 Log Rank, HR 0.51 CI 0.26-1.00 P = 0.0496). As with ERbeta2 immunoscore, this association was stronger at 5 years (5-year BCR P = 0.016 Log Rank, HR 0.39 CI 0.18-0.87 P = 0.020). Notably, unlike ERbeta2 immunostaining, no significant association was found between ERbeta2 mRNA and ERalpha immunostaining. Also unlike ERbeta2 protein, ERbeta2 mRNA and ERalpha status were independently associated with BCR at 5 years (ERbeta2 HR 0.43 CI 0.20-0.95 P = 0.036, ERalpha HR 0.36 CI 0.18-0.75 P = 0.006). These two measures of ERbeta2 expression therefore seem to behave differently in relation to ERalpha status and treatment outcome.

Further outcome analysis was limited to ERalpha positive women who received adjuvant tamoxifen and had a defined breast cancer related outcome (n = 62 BCR, n = 58 BCS). High grade (BCR P = 0.006, BCS P = 0.0008) and positive nodal status (BCR P = 0.003, BCS P = 0.007) maintained their association with worse outcome (Log Rank). ROC plots for BCR and BCS at 5 years indicated a significant relationship between good outcome and high qRTPCR values for ERbeta2 (BCR area under curve 0.68 CI 0.52-0.84, P = 0.036) and the optimal cut-point was 0.0039 attomoles per mug total RNA. There were significant associations between outcome and ERbeta2 mRNA level using the ROC-derived cut-point (Figures 2 and 3). High ERbeta2 mRNA was significantly associated with better outcome (BCR P = 0.0095 Log Rank, HR 0.32 CI 0.13-0.79; BCS P = 0.011 Log Rank, HR 0.25 CI 0.08-0.79). The 5-year cumulative relapse-free population was 81% in the ERbeta2-high group (standard error 8%), compared to 55% in the ERbeta2-low group (standard error 10%); the 5-year cumulative BCS was 89% in the ERbeta2-high group (standard error 6%), compared to 62% in the ERbeta2-low group (standard error 10%).

In Cox multivariate analysis of the ERalpha + tamoxifen-treated cohort including grade, size, nodal status and PgR status, high ERbeta2 mRNA had independent significance for good outcome: for BCR ERbeta2 (HR 0.31 CI 0.11-0.86, P = 0.024) and nodal status (HR 3.7 CI 1.2-11.5, P = 0.022) were independently significant; for BCS ERbeta2 (HR 0.17 CI 0.05-0.65, P = 0.0095) and grade (HR 1.8 CI 1.03-3.3, P = 0.041) were independently significant. Notably there was no significant association between ERbeta2 and grade, size, nodal status or PgR status in this treatment-specific cohort (all P > 0.35 Chi-square). In ERalpha +, node negative cases (n = 33), using a lower cut-off (0.00185 attomoles per mug total RNA), ERbeta2 was significantly associated with better outcome (BCR P = 0.0005, BCS P < 0.00005 Log Rank); the 5 year cumulative relapse-free population was 96% in the ERbeta2-high group (standard error 4%), compared to 39% in the ERbeta2-low group (standard error 24%).

Our results indicate that ERbeta2 isoform mRNAs may be an independent marker for ERalpha + cases that respond well to adjuvant tamoxifen treatment. In node negative cases, where the need for additional markers of response is greatest, our study shows that low ERbeta2 mRNA levels are significantly related to worse outcome; as the cases in this subgroup analysis was small, a larger study of node negative patients is warranted. The fully quantitative nature of the qRTPCR results allows comparison of mRNA levels between different ER isoforms and of variant levels between tumours, but necessitated selection of optimal cut-points (in this case using ROC analysis) for the dichotomization required for standard outcome analysis. It should be noted that, whilst such dichotomization is useful in demonstrating associations with outcome, true utility of ERbeta variant mRNA measurement will only be demonstrated with larger patient cohorts and may be better achieved by treating mRNA quantitation as a continuous variable, as in other RTPCR based outcome predictors [24].

Association of staining for ERbeta2 protein with mRNA expression

Associations between high levels of ERbeta2 protein (immunoscore) or mRNA (qRTPCR) and improved outcome have been seen, but only the qRTPCR results are significant in the clinically relevant ERalpha + cohort. It is therefore important to establish the relationship between mRNA and protein levels in clinical samples. Notably, most previous RTPCR-based analyses have failed to take into account the possible translational control when assigning biological or clinical relevance to ERbeta isoform expression.

When assessing the relationship between immunostaining and qRTPCR for paired samples from each case, no correlation was seen between levels of protein and mRNA for ERbeta2 [Pearson (%+) -0.12 P = 0.24; and Spearman (Allred) -0.08 P = 0.40]. This is in contrast to ERalpha in the same cohort [Pearson (%+) 0.30 P = 0.003; Spearman (Allred) 0.50 P = 1.0 x 10-6], but a similar lack of correlation was seen previously for ERbeta1 [9]. Due to tissue heterogeneity, any mRNA analysis of tissue homogenates without selection can contribute to discordance with immunostaining results that are scored on specific cell types. In order to minimise the impact of such artefacts, we selected cases for mRNA analysis that had high proportions of tumour cells (see Methods). It is known that lymphocytes express ERbeta2 mRNA, but when 14 cases with inflammatory infiltrates were excluded there was still no significant correlation between ERbeta2 mRNA and protein expression. A major factor in the discordance is that many cases express high levels of protein, but low mRNA levels; a situation that is not likely to arise from expression of mRNA in non-tumour cells. It is however possible that heterogeneity of expression in the different parts of the tumour specimen used for mRNA and protein analysis contributes to the lack of correlation and in situ analysis of mRNA and protein in adjacent sections might address this.

High ERbeta2 protein levels and high ERbeta2 mRNA levels, when entered into a Cox multivariate model, were independently associated with better relapse-free survival in the whole cohort (ERbeta2 protein HR 0.40 CI 0.20-0.80 P = 0.010, ERbeta2 mRNA HR 0.43 CI 0.22-0.83 P = 0.013). In multivariate analysis of mRNA and protein in the ERalpha + tamoxifen-treated cohort, only high ERbeta2 mRNA levels were significantly associated with lower BCR (HR 0.28 CI 0.212-0.72 P = 0.008), but a trend remained for protein (HR 0.42 CI 0.15-1.19 P = 0.10). Similar results were obtained for analysis of BCS. This indicates that both mRNA and protein levels may contribute to the relationship of ERbeta2 with improved outcome.

Using the cut-points optimised for outcome analysis, the majority of cases (69%) with high ERbeta2 mRNA levels also had high levels of ERbeta2 protein. However, only a minority of cases (44%) with high ERbeta2 protein were also classified as having high ERbeta2 mRNA. Thus ERbeta2 mRNA expression is frequently associated with expression of significant levels of ERbeta2 protein, but ERbeta2 protein expression is often dissociated from mRNA expression. Hence, there is a subset of cases (34%) with concomitant high ERbeta2 mRNA and protein and another subset of cases (44%) in which high protein levels are not accompanied by high mRNA levels. The cases with both high ERbeta2 protein and mRNA had a significantly better outcome than those with low levels of either mRNA or protein or both (P = 0.011 Log Rank, Figure 2). When cases with high ERbeta2 protein and RNA were compared a group consisting of all other cases they had significantly better outcome: in the whole cohort of ERalpha + and ERalpha- cases, (BCR P = 0.002 Log Rank, HR 0.67 CI 0.51-0.88 P = 0.004; BCS P = 0.003 Log Rank, HR 0.61 CI 0.43-0.87 P = 0.006) and for ERalpha + tamoxifen-treated cases (BCR P = 0.004 Log Rank, HR 0.61 CI 0.43-0.88 P = 0.009; BCS P = 0.009 Log Rank, HR 0.56 CI 0.34-0.91 P = 0.020). The outcome benefit of concomitant high ERbeta2 mRNA and protein levels was particularly marked at shorter follow-up, where this measure was the only independent marker of improved outcome in the ERalpha + tamoxifen-treated cohort using Cox multivariate analysis including grade, size PgR status and nodal status (5-year BCR HR 0.48 CI 0.24-0.95 P = 0.036, 7 year BCS HR 0.46 CI 0.23-0.92 P = 0.029). In the ERalpha + tamoxifen-treated, node negative cases, having both high ERbeta2 mRNA and protein was significantly related to an improved BCS (P = 0.028 Log Rank).
###end p 59
###begin p 60
Although ERbeta2 protein levels are apparently not directly related to mRNA levels, expression of ERbeta2 protein may be important because good outcome was observed for those cases assessed as having both high mRNA and protein levels and this was independent in multivariate analysis. It is possible therefore that the relatively poor utility of ERbeta2 protein assessment by immunostaining as a measure of outcome prediction may be due to high levels of ERbeta2 protein in some cases (with lower levels of ERbeta2 mRNA) being related to some form of protein stabilization, or detection of inactive ERbeta2. The disparity between protein and RNA expression for ERbeta2 is even suggestive of an inverse relationship. Nevertheless a significant proportion of cancers (34%) had both high protein and high mRNA levels and these had a significantly better outcome than the remaining cases. This suggests that transcription of ERbeta2 mRNA drives ERbeta2 protein levels in some cases, and these cases do particularly well on tamoxifen treatment. It is perhaps unsurprising that previous studies of ERbeta2 protein expression did not find significant associations between ERbeta2 and outcome in ERalpha + tamoxifen treated cases as these did not include measurement of ERbeta2 mRNA levels. They were thus unable to distinguish between ERB2 protein associated with increased transcription and that possibly present due to some form of post-transcriptional control (or perhaps the breakdown of normal control).

Whilst our data would suggest that high ERbeta2 levels could contribute to an improved outcome in a subgroup of patients, it provides further evidence that determination of ERbeta2 protein by immunostaining is unlikely to provide the predictive test that is needed for better targeting of additional therapy in those women for whom adjuvant tamoxifen is not likely to be sufficient. The failure to link protein expression to outcome measures does not preclude the use of ERbeta2 mRNA levels in a clinical setting. Low ERbeta2 mRNA was significantly associated with worse outcomes in ERalpha + tamoxifen-treated patients independently of other factors such as grade and nodal status. Larger trials to validate ERbeta2 mRNA as a biomarker are needed and should be extended to alternative adjuvant endocrine therapies such as aromatase inhibitors.
