During the process of metastasis, cells are subjected to various apoptotic stimuli. Aberrant expression of apoptotic regulators often contribute to cell metastasis. Heat shock protein 27(HSP27) is confirmed as an apoptosis regulator, but its antiapoptotic mechanism in metastatic hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells remains unclear.

Levels of HSP27 protein and its phosphorylation in Hep3B, MHCC97L to MHCC97H cells with different metastatic potentials were determined by western blot analysis. MHCC97H cells were transfected with specific small interference RNA (siRNA) against HSP27. The in vitro migration and invasion potentials of cells were evaluated by Transwell assay. The apoptosis ratio of MHCC97H cells was analyzed by TUNEL staining and Flow Cytometry. Alteration of signal transduction pathway after HSP27 knockdown in MHCC97H cells was evaluated through a Human Q Series Signal Transduction in Cancer Gene Array analysis. Nuclear NF-kappaB contentration and endogenous IKK activity were demonstrated by ELISA assay. The association of IKKalpha, IKKbeta, IkappaBalpha with HSP27 and the association between IKKbeta and IKKalpha in MHCC97H cells were determined by co-immunoprecipitation assay followed by western blot analysis.

HSP27 protein and its phosphorylation increased in parallel with enhanced metastatic potentials of HCC cells. siRNA-mediated HSP27 knockdown in MHCC97H significantly suppressed cells migration and invasion in vitro and induced cell apoptosis; the prominently altered signal transduction pathway was NF-kappaB pathway after HSP27 knockdown in MHCC97H cells. Furthermore, inhibition of HSP27 expression led to a significant decrease of nuclear NF-kappaB contentration and endogenous IKK activity. In addition, HSP27 was associated with IKKalpha, IKKbeta, IkappaBalpha in three HCC cells above. ELISA assay and western blot analysis also showed a decrease of the association between IKKbeta and IKKalpha, the association between phosphor-HSP27 and IKK complex, and an increase of total IkappaBalpha but reducing tendency of phosphor-IkappaBalpha when HSP27 expression was efficiently knocked down in MHCC97H cells.

Metastasis is a complex process that requires the sequential completion of multiple steps in which various molecules are involved [1]. During metastasis process, cells are subjected to various apoptotic stimuli. Thus, in addition to genetic changes that promote up-regulated proliferation, successful metastatic cells must have a decreased sensitivity to apoptotic stimuli [2]. As many metastatic cancer cells exhibit aberrations in levels and functions of key apoptotic regulators, exploiting these alterations to induce tumor cell apoptosis offers a promising therapeutic target [3]. Numerous studies show that NF-kappaB has anti-apoptotic effects which have been implicated in a variety of biological processes [4]. The association of NF-kappaB pathway activation with inflammation-associated/driven tumor promotion, progression, and metastasis was demonstrated in several mouse models [5]. It was found that suppressing chronic NF-kappaB activation at later stages resulted in the apoptotic death of transformed hepatocytes and failure to progress to hepatocellular carcinoma [6].

Heat shock protein 27 (HSP27) is an ATP-independent chaperone that confers protection against apoptosis through various mechanisms, including interacting with and inhibiting components of both stress and death-receptor induced apoptotic pathways [7]. For example, when overexpressed in response to various stimuli, HSP27 facilitates phosphorylated IkappaBalpha proteasome mediated proteolysis and enhances NF-kappaB activity, which could account for its antiapoptotic properties [8]. Moreover, increased levels of HSP27 expression may render tumours more resistant to host defence mechanisms and increase the metastatic potential of tumors cells [9]. Recently, our previous study showed the important effect of HSP27 on metastatic hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells motility [10]. These documents above suggest there may be an internal mechanism which answers for regulation of HSP27 on apoptosis in metastatic HCC cells.

In order to elucidate the assumption, in this study, we demonstrated significant effects of HSP27 on HCC cells motility and apoptosis in vitro. Analysis of the cDNA microarray data revealed such effects may be related to the regulation of HSP27 on NF-kappaB pathway activation in metastatic HCC cells, which was confirmed in further biochemical investigation.

HSP27 siRNA duplex (sense:5'-ACGGUCAAGACCAAGGAUGdTdT-3'; antisense: 5'-CAUCCUUGGUCUUGACCGUdTdT-3') were purchased from Cell Signaling Technology. 2 x 106 cells were transfected with a final concentration (100 nM) of HSP27 siRNA using Lipofectamine 2000 for 24 hr to detect mRNA level and for 48 hr to detect protein level in the presence of control or HSP27 siRNA according to the manufacture instruction (RNAi group), because siRNA duplex are generally depleted in less than three days at when the interference effect of siRNA will be weak. Lysates were prepared in lysis buffer and equal amounts of protein were subjected to immunoblot analysis. Cells which were transfected with non-specific siRNA (MOCK group) or non-treated MHCC97H cells (MHCC97H group) were parallelly demonstrated.

The procedures of RT-PCR were the same as the previous study [12]. Briefly, the total RNA of cells was extracted by Trizol (Invitrogen). cDNA synthesis was performed in 20 mul reaction system of reverse transcription including 3 mug RNA. Compound amplification of HSP27 and GAPDH acting as internal control was then carried out using equal cDNA as template. The sequence of primers is listed, HSP27: 5'-ccagagcagagtcagccagcat-3'(sense), 5'-cgaaggtgactgggatggtga-3' (antisense); GAPDH: 5'-ccatgttcgtcatgggtgtgaacca-3' (sense), 5'-gccagtagaggcagggatgatgttc-3' (antisense). The program of PCR: 95degreesC 30 s, 57degreesC 40 s, 72degreesC 40 s and 25 cycles were performed and PCR products were separated by 2% agarose gel electrophoresis, then scanned and analyzed by VDS imagemaster system (Pharmacia). Hsp27 primers used in this study yield an expected single band (576 bp), GAPDH primers product a 251 bp single band.

In vitro invasion assay was performed using 24-well Transwell unit with polycarbonate filters (Corning Costar, Cambridge, MA). The HCC cells with RNAi treatments were placed in the upper part of the Transwell, incubated for indicated time, fixed with methanol, and stained with hematoxylin for 10 min followed briefly by eosin. Cells in the upper chamber were removed by cotton swab and the cells that invaded through the Matrigel and were located on the underside of the filter (16 fields/filter) were counted. Three invasion chambers were used per condition. The values obtained were calculated by averaging the total number of cells from three filters. Experimental procedures of in vitro migration assay are the same as the in vitro invasion assay described above except that the filter was not coated with Matrigel for the migration assay.

In addition to TUNEL-staining, we attempted to confirm apoptotic rates by FACS using 5,5-6,6-tetra-chloro-1,1-3,3-tetraethylbenzimidazolyl-carbocyanine iodide (JC-1, Molecular Probes, Invitrogen Corporation, CA, USA)-staining, because the loss of mitochondrial membrane potential is an early indicator for apoptosis [13,14]. JC-1 staining solution was freshly prepared in a concentration of 10 mug/mL prior to use with DMEM medium without phenol red. Cells were cultured and treated with HSP27 siRNA for 24 hr. After washing with PBS (pH 7.4), 300 muL staining solution was added and the cells were incubated for 15 min at 37degreesC and 5% CO2 in the dark. Then washed twice in PBS, and resuspended in 300 mul PBS. The cells were then analyzed with a FACScan flow cytometer (Becton & Dickinson, Mountain View, CA, USA). JC-1 exhibits potential-dependent accumulation in mitochondria, indicated by a fluorescence emission shift from green (529 nm, FL1) to red (590 nm, FL2). In apoptotic cells, the ratio of red to green fluorescence decreases if the mitochondrial membrane depolarizes.

Nuclear extracts were prepared from treated and control MHCC97H cells using a nuclear extraction kit (Active Motif). Activated NF-kappaB in the samples was determined by oligonucleotide-based ELISA (Active Motif). Treated and control samples were normalized and incubated in 96-well microtiter wells, and the activated NFkappaB in the nuclear extracts attached to a consensus nucleotide sequence (5'-GGGACTTTCC-3') that was coated onto the microtiter wells. Attached NF-kappaB was captured by antibody to NF-kappaB (p65) and detected by an anti-rabbit-HRP-conjugated IgG. Color development was performed with hydrogen peroxide/TMB chromogenic substrate, and intensity of the developed color proportionately represented the quantity of NFkappaB in each sample. The specificity of the binding of NFkappaB of the samples with the nucleotide sequence was determined by comparison to the control binding, determined by adding either free consensus nucleotide or mutated nucleotide to the reaction buffer. The sample values were normalized with the total cell protein determined by protein assay kit (Pierce).

Expression of HSP27 was distinctly inhibited after RNA interference. Levels of HSP27 and phosphorylated HSP27 in Hep3B, MHCC97L and MHCC97H cells were up-regulated through western blot analysis of whole cell lysate using specific antibodies (A). PCR products of HSP27 in MHCC97H after siRNA transfection for 24 hr (B) and its protein expression after siRNA transfection for 48 hr (C) were significantly reduced in MHCC97H cells. The values on bottom of the bands represent the densitometric estimation of the relative density of the band, calculated by comparing the ratio of intensity of MHCC97L and MHCC97H cell line with that of Hep3B cell line (the ratio in Hep3B was set as baseline 1.0).

To obtain insights into whether HSP27 was directly related to HCC cells motility and invasion ability or not, knockdown of HSP27 with small interference RNA (siRNA) was performed in MHCC97H cells with higher metastatic potential. Expression of HSP27 in MHCC97H cells showed a significant decrease on the levels of mRNA (Fig. 1B) and protein (Fig. 1C) in HSP27 RNAi group, compared with MOCK group and control MHCC97H group. The results indicated expression of HSP27 in MHCC97H cells was efficiently inhibited. Then we detected cells motility and invasion in the three groups through in vitro migration and invasion assay. The results showed that the number of HSP27-RNAi MHCC97H cells through the filter (Migration assay: 98 +/- 8; Invasion assay: 79 +/- 7) was markedly less than the numbers of MOCK cells (Migration assay: 191 +/- 11; Invasion assay:201 +/- 5) and MHCC97H cells without any treatment (Migration assay: 207 +/- 10; Invasion assay:211 +/- 4) (P < 0.05) (Fig. 1D). Thus, inhibition of HSP27 expression suppressed significantly MHCC97H cells migration and invasion in vitro.

Through TUNEL in situ detection, we found that apoptosis ratio of cells increased in MHCC97H cells after 24 hr treatment with siRNA against HSP27 (Fig. 2A, B), compared with MOCK group and MHCC97H cells group. In addition to TUNEL-staining, we attempted to reconfirm the apoptosis ratio of HSP27-RNAi MHCC97H with 24 hr treatment by measuring the mitochondrial membrane potential changes using JC-1-staining, because the loss of mitochondrial membrane potential is an early indicator for apoptosis[13,14]. It was shown that the percentage of apoptotic cells was increased to 36.12% in RNAi group, compared with 17.13% in MOCK group and 12.12% in control MHCC97H group (Fig. 2C). These results indicated inhibition of HSP27 expression increased HCC cells apoptosis ratio.

To investigate preferentially altered signal transduction pathway in MHCC97H cells after HSP27 knockdown, the Human Q Series Signal Transduction in Cancer Gene Array including marker genes with functions related to cell signal transduction pathways was used. Combined with ratio values 2-fold difference, significantly down-regulated genes including NFKB1 (NFkappaB), IL2, NFKBIA (IkappaBalpha), LTA, PECAM1 passed statistic t-test. The results were reconfirmed by real-time PCR with different and specific primer pairs [see Additional file 1]. Through Pathway Miner software analysis, these down-regulated genes indicated the preferential change of NF-kappaB pathway after inhibition of HSP27 expression in MHCC97H cells.

Microarray analysis results promoted us to elucidate a role of HSP27 on activation of NF-kappaB pathway in HCC cells. Firstly, after HSP27 knockdown, it was found that level of activated NF-kappaB in nuclei decreased about 0.5-fold in MHCC97H cells (Fig. 3A). Then, concentration of nuclear NF-kappaB was detected in Hep3B, MHCC97L and MHCC97H cells. It showed there was an increased tendency of nuclear NF-kappaB concentration from Hep3B to MHCC97H cells (Fig. 3B), which was identical to consecutively up-regulated expression pattern of HSP27 in the three cell lines (Fig. 1A). These results suggested that HSP27 may have an effect on NF-kappaB activation in metastatic HCC cells.

To further confirmed this idea, immunoprecipitates from Hep3B, MHCC97L and MHCC97H cells using HSP27 antibody were analyzed by SDS-PAGE, followed by western blot analysis with activated NF-kappaB p65, IKKalpha, IKKbeta and IkappaBalpha-specific antibodies. As shown in Fig. 4A, IKKalpha, IKKbeta and IkappaBalpha were detected out in the immunoprecipitates, but not activated NF-kappaB p65. Further IKK assay analysis showed that IKK activity was highest in MHCC97H cells, followed by MHCC97L cells and then Hep3B cells (Fig. 4B), which was consistent with the elevated tendency of NF-kappaB activation in the three HCC cell lines. In addition, phosphorylation of HSP27 in immunoprecipitates from Hep3B, MHCC97L, MHCC97H cells was determined by western blot analysis with IKKalpha antibody, it was found that phosphorylated HSP27 which was associated with IKK complex reduced from Hep3B, MHCC97L to MHCC97H cells (Fig. 4C).

HSP27 interacts with key molecular (IKKbeta, IKKalpha, IkappaBalpha) of NF-kB pathway in HCC cell lines. The precipitated IKKbeta, IKKalpha, IkappaBalpha with anti-HSP27 antibody or normal mouse IgG1 were detected by western blot analysis in Hep3B, MHCC97L and MHCC97H cells, the HSP27 contents in the precipitates were used as equal loading amount control (A). Endogenous IKK activity in Hep3B, MHCC97L and MHCC97H cells (B) and in RNAi, MOCK and MHCC97H cells (D) was detected through IKK assay. The absorbed value of reaction solution from MHCC97H cells or Hep3B cells served as a percent control. The precipitated HSP27 and phosphorylated HSP27 with IKK complex by using anti-IKKalpha antibody were detected in Hep3B, MHCC97L and MHCC97H cells, the IKKalpha contents in the precipitates were used as equal loading amount control (C). Moreover, the precipitated IKKbeta with anti-IKKalpha antibody or precipitated IKKalpha with anti-IKKbeta antibody and normal rabbit IgG1 in RNAi, MOCK and MHCC97H cells were demonstrated by western blot analysis and the association between IKKalpha and IKKbeta was reduced. The IKKalpha or IKKbeta contents in the precipitates were used as equal loading amount control (E). In addition, total IkappaBalpha (F) and phosphorylated IkappaBalpha (G) were also analyzed by western blot analysis or ELISA in RNAi, MOCK and MHCC97H cells.

Although HSP27 is induced transiently after periods of cell stress, it is often constitutively over-expressed in tumor cells [9,15]. In addition, increased HSP27 is responsible for the increase in experimental endothelial cell metastasis and further associated with metastatic disease in breast and ovarian cancers [16,17]. Our previous studies and this study showed that up-regulated expression of HSP27 was related to malignant potentials of HCC cells [10,12,18], it suggested a role of HSP27 in HCC development and progression.

It is hypothesized that tumor cells with elevated levels of heat-shock proteins have a selective pro-survival advantage that contributes to the process of tumorigenesis and enhancement of malignant potentials. Moreover, the precondition of gaining such advantages requires persistent activation of proliferation signal or blockage of apoptosis pathway [7,19]. It is also well-known that HSP27 is able to block apoptosis at different stages because of its interaction with a number of partners implicated in the apoptotic pathways [20,21]. Furthermore, the capacity of HSP27 to interact with one or another partner seems to be determined by the oligomerization/phosphorylation status which is two activation forms of HSP27 [22-24]. Through flow cytometry and TUNEL label analysis, we found that apoptotic ratio of metastatic HCC cells increased significantly after inhibition of HSP27 expression. The data suggested an important role of up-regulated HSP27 in inhibiting HCC cells apoptosis.

To elucidate the effect of up-regulated HSP27 on HCC cells apoptosis, through a signal transduction cDNA microarray analysis, we found that these significantly different genes were prominently related to NF-kappaB signal transduction pathway in HCC cells. It seems likely that regulation of HSP27 on NF-kappaB pathway activation is involved in metastatic HCC cells apoptosis.

It is reported that IkappaB kinase/NF-kappaB (IKK/NF-kappaB) signaling pathway plays critical roles in a variety of physiological and pathological processes. During the process, the control of IkappaBalpha phosphorylation in response to all other NF-kappaB activating stimuli rests on the shoulders of the IkappaB kinase (IKK) complex [25]. Moreover, the association of NF-kappaB pathway activation with tumor promotion, progression, and metastasis was well documented [26]. In diverse cell types, NF-kappaB signaling pathway has been shown to have a critical role in regulating the apoptotic program. Whether NF-kappaB promotes or inhibits apoptosis appears to depend on the specific cell type and the type of inducer [27]. In this research, we observed that activated NF-kappaB in nuclei increased gradually from Hep3B, MHCC97L to MHCC97H cells. It is accordance with some studies in HCC [28]. More intriguingly, we have found that the level of nuclear activated NF-kappaB reduced after HSP27 knockdown, indicating depletion of HSP27 inhibited NF-kappaB pathway activation in HCC cells. It was reported that, as a component of IKK complex, Hsp90/Cdc37 was related to regulation of IKK activity, indicating heat shock protein could be involved in regulation of NF-kappaB signal pathway activation [29]. Therefore, we next examined effects of HSP27 on key molecules of NF-kappaB pathway.

We demonstrated that HSP27 was associated with IKKalpha, IKKbeta and IkappaBalpha in HCC cells. The result indicated that effects of HSP27 on NF-kappaB pathway activation may be from its interaction with IKKalpha, IKKbeta and IkappaBalpha. It was also found in this study that basal level of phosphorylated HSP27 and IKK activity increased consecutively from Hep3B to MHCC97L, MHCC97H cells, which was consistent with activated NF-kappaB in nuclei. It suggested NF-kappaB pathway activation may be IKK-dependent in our metastatic HCC cell lines. In addition, IKK complex in HCC cells was not only associated with phosphorylated HSP27, but with non-phosphorylated HSP27, and it also showed that phosphorylated HSP27 associated with IKK complex reduced from Hep3B, MHCC97L to MHCC97H cells. Therefore, it was possible that phosphorylation of HSP27 may have a negative effect on activation of IKK complex through interacting with some intercellular kinases [30], whereas non-phosphorylated HSP27 may maintain IKK signalosome specific conformation or assist the IKK resolubilization in HCC cells, which can be implied by suppression of endogenous IKK complex activity in HSP27-knockdown HCC cells. Alternatively, it has been reported that HSP90 could regulate IKK receptiveness to post-translational modification or even the activity of enzymes that carry out such modifications [31]. Whether HSP27 plays such a role in HCC cells needs further study.

In addition, our findings also showed, after HSP27 depletion by siRNA, the level of total IkappaBalpha mildly increased but its phosphorylated ratio showed a reduced tendency in HCC cells. It suggested that HSP27 may play dual roles in IkappaBalpha degradation, not only favors a proteasome complex for IkappaBalpha degradation through direct association with IkappaBalpha, but also enhances indirectly IkappaBalpha phosphorylation through IKK complex.

In summary, the results reported in the present study suggested at some extent the contribution of HSP27 to metastatic HCC cells apoptosis, which involves more than one single mechanism. Particularly relevant in this regard is the regulation of HSP27 on key molecules of NF-kappaB signaling pathway. This study provides a new insight for analyzing the role of HSP27 in HCC cells resistance against apoptosis.
