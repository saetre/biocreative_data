We have determined the mutation in a patient with acute intermittent porphyria. The mRNA coding for porphobilinogen deaminase was reverse transcribed then the cDNA was enzymatically amplified in vitro. Upon sequencing of a polymerase chain reaction product of abnormal size we found that this fragment lacked exon 12 of the gene. We analysed a genomic fragment containing exon 12 and determined that the patient was heterozygous for a point mutation G A at the last position of exon 12. We propose that this base change is responsible for an abnormal processing of the mutant allele such that exon 12 is missing in the mature mRNA. The resulting aberrant mRNA encodes a truncated protein which is inactive but stable and can be detected using antibodies directed against the normal enzyme.
