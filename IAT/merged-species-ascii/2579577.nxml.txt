Background
###end title 2
###begin p 3
The primary cilium is a sensory organelle generated from the centrosome in quiescent cells and found at the surface of most cell types, from where it controls important physiological processes. Specific sets of membrane proteins involved in sensing the extracellular milieu are concentrated within cilia, including G protein coupled receptors (GPCRs). Most GPCRs are regulated by beta-arrestins, betaarr1 and betaarr2, which control both their signalling and endocytosis, suggesting that betaarrs may also function at primary cilium.

In cycling cells, betaarr2 was observed at the centrosome, at the proximal region of the centrioles, in a microtubule independent manner. However, betaarr2 did not appear to be involved in classical centrosome-associated functions. In quiescent cells, both in vitro and in vivo, betaarr2 was found at the basal body and axoneme of primary cilia. Interestingly, betaarr2 was found to interact and colocalize with 14-3-3 proteins and Kif3A, two proteins known to be involved in ciliogenesis and intraciliary transport. In addition, as suggested for other centrosome or cilia-associated proteins, betaarrs appear to control cell cycle progression. Indeed, cells lacking betaarr2 were unable to properly respond to serum starvation and formed less primary cilia in these conditions.

Conclusions/Significance
###end title 6
###begin p 7
Our results show that betaarr2 is localized to the centrosome in cycling cells and to the primary cilium in quiescent cells, a feature shared with other proteins known to be involved in ciliogenesis or primary cilium function. Within cilia, betaarr2 may participate in the signaling of cilia-associated GPCRs and, therefore, in the sensory functions of this cell "antenna".

An increasing number of reports have highlighted the function of the primary cilium (PC) in the control of several physiological processes. The PC is a hair-like cellular extension found at the surface of most vertebrate cells. This sophisticated microtubule-based organelle has been shown to sense multiple mechanical and chemical stimuli from the environment and to elicit specific cellular responses, which play crucial roles in embryonic development and homeostatic processes in adulthood. The PC has also recently been implicated in the regulation of cell cycle progression and, as a consequence, a lack of PC was associated with increased proliferation [1]-[3].

PC formation (ciliogenesis) takes place in quiescent or differentiated cells. PCs are assembled from the mother centriole of the unique centrosome present in these cells, which therefore corresponds to the basal body of PC. The mother centriole is docked at the membrane through its distal appendages and gives rise to the microtubule-based 9+0 axoneme, which forms the skeleton of this "antenna" like extension of the plasma membrane. Whereas the basal body shares many properties with classical centrosomes, made of two centrioles and of a pericentriolar matrix, the axoneme represents a unique domain, characterized by the exclusion of many proteins and the enrichment of specific soluble, cytoplasmic, as well as membrane-associated components [1]-[3]. This sorting is achieved through a complex process mediated by highly conserved machineries, involved in both the selection of ciliary proteins, which likely contain specific motifs and the transport along the axonemal microtubule doublets. The components of these machineries can either be specifically devoted to ciliary-protein transport and/or ciliogenesis, as IFT (intraflagellar transport) proteins [4], or participate in other cellular processes, as reported for the aPKC-par3-par6 polarity cassette [5], [6], the 14-3-3 adaptor protein [5] and Kif3A, a kinesin required for the anterograde transport towards the tip of the PC [4]. Polycystins, proteins involved in mechano-sensation of tubular renal cells [7] and growth factor receptors [3] figure among the proteins that are highly enriched in ciliary membranes.

Receptors belonging to the G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) family are involved in the sensing of many different kinds of molecules including odorants, ions, amines, proteins or light, and thus regulate a large array of physiological processes. Some GPCRs accumulate at the PC, such as the somatostatin type 3 receptor, which is localized at PCs in neurons [8], or smoothened (smo), the GPCR-like transmembrane protein controlling the Hedgehog pathway [9], for which translocation to the PC is essential for signalling activity [10], [11]. Most GPCRs are regulated by non visual arrestins, arrestin2 and arrestin3, also known as beta-arrestin1 (betaarr1) and beta-arrestin2 (betaarr2), which uncouple activated receptors from G-proteins, promote their endocytosis through clathrin-coated pits and mediate receptor-dependent activation of MAP kinases [12], [13].

betaarrs regulate numerous key physiological and developmental processes as shown by the fact that the lack of both isoforms results in early embryonic lethality [14]. They are highly conserved among higher eukaryotes, although only vertebrates express the two isoforms, which show a high sequence homology and are encoded by two separate genes. betaarr isoforms share most of their partners and functions, however, several isoform-specific roles have also been described. In particular, only betaarr2 displays an active nucleocytoplasmic shuttling, which redistributes nuclear binding partners to the cytoplasm, whereas regulation of histone acetylation at certain promoters was only reported for betaarr1 [15], [16]. Interestingly, betaarr2, not betaarr1, was found in the cilia of olfactory neurons [17], [18], suggesting that the former might regulate odorant receptors within these structures, which are very similar to PCs. Here, we report that betaarr2 is specifically localized to the centrosome of cycling cells. Since most PC-associated proteins are also present at the centrosome in cycling cells, we investigated if betaarr2 could also be localized to the PC.

When expressed as a GFP-fusion, betaarr2 showed a diffuse cytoplasmic distribution except one or two bright spots close to the nucleus. This localization was suggestive of the centrosome and, confirming this hypothesis, the spots were also decorated with pericentrin (Figures 1A and S1A), a centrosomal marker. The centrosomal targeting of betaarr2-GFP was specific, as betaarr1-GFP or GFP alone were not enriched at sites of pericentrin staining (Figure 1A and S1A).

The accumulation of betaarr2-GFP at the centrosome was quantified, based on GFP-associated fluorescence. Normalized fluorescence at the centrosome for both GFP alone and betaarr1-GFP was close to 1 (1.15 and 1.20, respectively), whereas that of betaarr2-GFP (2.45) clearly showed accumulation at this organelle (Figure 1B). This new specific localization of betaarr2 was independent of the tag fused to the protein, as betaarr2 fused with Cherry (betaarr2-Ch), a different fluorescent protein [19], was also enriched at the centrosome (Figure S1B).

Endogenous betaarr2 targeting to the centrosome was subsequently investigated using betaarr2-specific antibodies and mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs), derived from wild-type (WT), betaarr2 (2KO), betaarr1 (1KO) and betaarr1/2 double knock-out (1/2KO) embryos [14] as controls (Figures S2 and S3). Both antibodies specifically stained bright spots close to the nucleus, which colocalized with pericentrin or gamma-tubulin (Figures 2, S3 and S4). In addition, localization of betaarr2 at the centrosome was found in both interphasic (Figures 2A and S4) and mitotic cells (Figure 2B). No colocalization was detected with alpha-tubulin in mitotic cells (Figure 2B), indicating that betaarr2 is not associated with the mitotic spindle. Altogether, these results show that betaarr2 is associated with the centrosome throughout the entire cell cycle.

The centrosome is composed of two centrioles which are involved in distinct functions [20]. Careful analysis of the staining patterns revealed that the distribution of betaarr2 within the centrosome was restricted to structures close to, but distinct from gamma-tubulin-containing areas (Figure 2A, insets, and Figure S4B). To more precisely characterize betaarr2 localization at the centrosome, we used centrin as a marker of the distal part of centrioles [20]. Both betaarr2 antibodies and betaarr2-Ch stained two spots juxtaposed to each centrin-decorated structures (Figure 2C), indicating that betaarr2 is targeted to the proximal region of centrioles. This specific localization was further confirmed with 3D reconstruction of deconvoluted images, in which juxtaposition of betaarr2 and centrin was clearly visible (Figure 2D). Combined, these results establish that betaarr2 is targeted to the proximal region of the centrioles (Figure 2E) and that this localization is not modified during the cell cycle.

Targeting of proteins to the centrosome can be achieved through microtubule dependent transport or independently of microtubules by a dynamic exchange with cytoplasm [21]. As shown in Figure 3A, betaarr2 was still present at the centrosome in cells treated with nocodazole or taxol, drugs which destabilize or stabilize microtubules, respectively. Normalized fluorescence of betaarr2 at the centrosome was indeed similar in drug-treated cells compared to control (Figure 3B), suggesting that targeting of betaarr2 to the centrosome is independent of microtubules. This hypothesis was further tested following the dynamic of betaarr2 at the centrosome by fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (Figure 3C). Live cells were treated with nocodazole for one hour at 37degreesC before and during dynamic analysis, a condition which did result in inhibition of microtubule-based transport (Figure S5). In the presence of nocodazole, centrosome-associated betaarr2-GFP fluorescence was recovered after photo-bleaching (Figure 3C), with similar kinetics as in control cells (data not shown). These results suggest that the localization of betaarr2 at the centrosome likely results from a dynamic exchange between a centrosomal and a cytoplasmic pool.

(A) HeLa cells expressing betaarr2-GFP fusion were untreated (control) or treated with nocodazole or taxol (10 microM) to depolymerize or stabilize microtubule network respectively. Cells were fixed and stained for microtubules (alpha-tubulin) and for the centrosome (pericentrin). Insets show higher magnifications of regions around centrosomes. Scale bar represents 5 microm. (B) Centrosome-associated fluorescence intensity for GFP was normalized to the cytoplasmic signal in the same cells for each condition. Values are the means (+/- SD) of at least 15 cells from three independent experiments. (C) Live HeLa cells transiently expressing betaarr2-GFP fusion were treated for one hour at 37degreesC with nocodazole (10 microM) then used for FRAP experiments. A small region containing the centrosome was bleached twice with 100% of laser intensity (one second per bleach). Images of a representative cell before (bb), just after bleaching (pb) and 90 seconds after bleaching (+90s) are shown. Insets show higher magnifications of the bleached region. Fluorescence intensity of betaarr2-GFP at the centrosome was normalized to cytoplasmic staining within an identical region in the cytoplasm. The FRAP experiments were done in at least 5 cells from two independent transfections.

Since the basic functions of the centrosome are the nucleation and anchoring of microtubules [21], we investigated if betaarr2 could affect these processes. Neither process was perturbed by absence or overexpression of betaarr2 (Figure S6). In addition, we could not detect any increase of multinucleated cells in betaarr-deficient MEFs (data not shown), suggesting that these proteins did not show any role in cytokinesis, another key function of the centrosome [21]. These data therefore suggest that betaarrs in general are not involved in classical functions of the centrosome.

PC formation can be induced in vitro in both fibroblasts and RPE1 cells, a widely used model to study ciliogenesis, by growing cells to confluence and this process can be enhanced upon serum starvation (see methods). PC can then be identified using anti-acetylated-tubulin (AT) antibodies, which stain the stabilized array of microtubules forming the axoneme. The basal body, which corresponds to the unique centrosome of these cells, can be identified using centrosomal markers.

After induction of PC assembly in RPE1 cells (Figure 4), endogenous betaarr2 was found in the axoneme, as indicated by its colocalization with AT (Figure 4A) and corroborated by 3D-reconstruction of deconvoluated images (Figure 4B). The specific targeting of betaarr2 to the axoneme was confirmed using transfected betaarr2-Ch which, at low expression levels, did colocalize with AT (Figure 4C). In addition, both endogenous and transfected betaarr2 were also present in two spots at the base of the axoneme (Figure 4, arrows), which colocalized with pericentrin (Figure 4D), thus corresponding to the basal body. Finally, betaarr2-Ch colocalized with the active form of smoothened (smo*) at the level of the axoneme but not at the basal body (Figure 4E), indicating a possible function in the regulation of cilia-dependent signalling pathways (see discussion).

To establish betaarr2 targeting to PC in vivo, distribution of betaarr2 was analyzed in mouse kidney sections (Figure 4F), where PCs are located at the luminal side (Lu) of tubular epithelial cells [22]. The staining pattern of the betaarr2 antibody was similar to that found in cultured cells, showing a colocalization of betaarr2 and AT at the apical membrane of epithelial cells (Figure 4F). Together, these data show that betaarr2 is targeted to primary cilia in vivo and in vitro, in both the basal body and the axoneme.

The ability of the 2KO MEFs to form PC upon serum starvation was compared to that of WT MEFs. As shown in Figure 5A and 5B, 76.5% of WT MEFs displayed an assembled PC, indicated by a unique AT-positive 2 microm long rod-like structure, while only 51.5% of the 2KO MEFs exhibited a PC. Similar results were obtained when antibodies against polyglutamylated-tubulin were used to visualize PCs (Figure S7), indicating that the observations based on AT stainings were not just due to side effects of microtubule acetylation.

Because betaarrs are redundant for most functions, we investigated the effect of depleting either betaarr1 alone or both betaarr1 and betaarr2 on the number of PCs. MEFs lacking betaarr1 were not affected in their ability to form PCs, with a similar proportion of ciliated cells being measured, compared to wild-type cells (Figure 5A and 5B). This result is consistent with the fact that RPE1 cells do not express detectable amounts of betaarr1 (Figure S3B) and do form PC (Figures 4, and 5). In contrast, 1/2KO MEFs were greatly impaired in their ability to form PC, with only approximately18% of ciliated cells (Figure 5A and 5B), indicating that ciliogenesis is severely affected in cells completely devoid of betaarrs. As expected from these observations, depletion of endogenous betaarr2 in RPE1 cells with two different small interfering RNA (siRNA), resulted in markedly reduced ciliogenesis in low serum conditions, compared to a non relevant siRNA (luciferase, Figure 5C and 5D).

A close link likely exists between PC assembly and control of cell cycle progression. It is assumed that only cells exiting the cell cycle and entering into G0 phase can form a cilium. On the other hand, ciliogenesis defects result in cell cycle progression and uncontrolled proliferation 2, 27. Since our data indicate that cells lacking betaarr2 are affected in their ability to form PCs, we investigated whether these cells would also exhibit defects in proliferation.

We first found that the presence of a PC was correlated with exit from the cell cycle and entry into G0 phase. Wild-type MEFs (Figure 6A) were grown in low serum for two days after confluence to induce PC formation. Cells were then stained for both AT and Ki-67, a nuclear protein expressed in cells cycling from G1 to M [28]. Although in high serum conditions most cells (>80%) showed nuclear Ki-67 staining (Figure 6B), in low serum conditions (Figure 6A and 6B), ciliated cells (arrows) were not positive for Ki-67 (blue nuclei) whereas adjacent non-ciliated cell expressed this proliferation marker (pink (blue and red) nucleus). These results confirmed that ciliated cells were in G0 phase.

We subsequently confirmed that ciliogenesis defects observed in betaarr2-depleted cells are correlated with cell cycle dysregulation. In WT MEFs, serum starvation induced a decrease of the proportion of cells positive for Ki-67, from 80% in cells grown in high serum, to 50% and 25% for cells grown in low serum for 24 and 48 hours, respectively (Figure 6B). Interestingly, the percentage of Ki-67 positive cells was inversely correlated with the number of ciliated cells (compare with Figure 5B). When 2KO and 1/2KO MEFs were grown in the same conditions, the number of cells positive for Ki-67 moderately decreased upon serum starvation but remained constant from 24 to 48 hours with 60 to 70% of the cells remaining positive for Ki-67 at 48h (Figure 6B). Since the percentage of ciliated cells was decreased in betaarr2 deficient cells (Figure 5B), it appears that the defect in PC formation is correlated with an absence of response to low serum conditions and impaired exiting from cell cycle to enter in the G0 phase. Similarly, an increased proportion of Ki-67 positive cells was also found in RPE1 cells depleted for betaarr2 and grown in low serum conditions (Figure 6C).

In cystic kidney disease, a pathological condition associated with impaired formation and/or function of PCs, cyst formation is due to both loss of planar polarity and increased mitosis in tubular cells [22]. Moreover, recent studies showed that Polaris, a protein responsible for a mouse model of polycystic kidney disease, controls cell cycle progression [26]. When MEFs were grown in high serum conditions, 2KO and 1KO cells showed increased proliferation compared to wild type cells, a phenotype more pronounced in 1/2KO cells (Figure 6D, p<0.01 at 72h). Interestingly, cells lacking both betaarr isoforms kept growing even in low serum conditions (Figure 6E, p = 0.001 at 72h). Therefore, the marked defect in ciliogenesis observed in 1/2 KO cells is likely to result from the inability of these cells to respond to signals that inhibit cell proliferation.

14-3-3 proteins (comprising beta, gamma, epsilon, eta, zeta, tau and sigma isoforms) are molecular adaptors, which often interact with consensus phosphorylated serine/threonine motifs of many proteins, thereby controlling a wide array of processes including signalling, cell cycle and apoptosis [29]. Interestingly, the 14-3-3zeta isoform was found to interact with the aPKC-Par3-Par6 polarity cassette [30], whereas depletion of 14-3-3eta, which was found in a molecular complex with Par3 and the kinesin Kif3A, resulted in ciliogenesis defects [5]. Unpublished yeast two-hybrid data revealed that betaarrs interact with 14-3-3 proteins, in agreement with a recent proteomic study [31]. The implication of 14-3-3eta in ciliogenesis and its connection with intraciliary transport through Kif3A, prompted us to characterize these interactions with betaarr2.

Endogenous 14-3-3 proteins were precipitated by a GST-betaarr2 fusion (Figure 7A) and the interaction between betaarr2 and the 14-3-3zeta isoform was confirmed by co-immunoprecipitation experiments showing that endogenous 14-3-3zeta interacts with Flag-tagged betaarr2 (Figure 7B). The betaarr2 C-terminus contains a motif (RPQSAP), similar to phosphorylated 14-3-3 consensus binding sites (Figure 7B). However, mutation of S361 within this motif did not affect the interaction of betaarr2 with endogenous 14-3-3zeta, which co-immunoprecipitated as efficiently with both the S361A and S361D mutants of betaarr2 (Figure 7B), indicating that the interaction of betaarr2 with 14-3-3 might be constitutive. This hypothesis is consistent with the observations that 14-3-3 proteins interact with recombinant GST-betaarr2 and that the 14-3-3/betaarrs interaction was not affected by GPCR activation (data not shown and ref [31]). A phosphorylation-independent interaction of betaarr2 with 14-3-3 proteins would not be unique, since it has already been reported for other partners of 14-3-3 [29].

Interaction of betaarr2 with 14-3-3zeta was extended to the other isoforms and we found that flag-tagged betaarr2, could co-immunoprecipitate with almost all 14-3-3 proteins (data not shown), including 14-3-3eta (Figure 7C), the isoform which has been implicated in ciliogenesis [5]. Finally, the possible colocalization of 14-3-3 proteins with betaarr2 was analyzed at the centrosome and PCs. In contrast to what was observed in kidney cells [5], 14-3-3 proteins were not detected on the axoneme of PCs in RPE1 or MEFs. In these cells, 14-3-3 proteins were only found at the centrosome or basal body where they colocalized with gamma-tubulin (Figures S8 and data not shown) and with betaarr2 (Figure 7D and data not shown).

Endogenous Kif3A was also precipitated by GST-betaarr2 (Figure 8A), an interaction confirmed by colocalization studies. Indeed, as reported in vivo[32], Kif3A was found in the cytoplasm and at the tip of the axoneme where it was colocalized with betaarr2 (Figure 8B). Finally, because Kif3A was reported to co-immunoprecipitate with 14-3-3eta [5], [30], we investigated whether betaarr2 could be present in the same molecular complex. Supporting this hypothesis myc-14-3-3eta co-immunoprecipitated with both Flag-tagged betaarr2 and endogenous Kif3A (Figure 8C).

###begin p 56
Our data show that betaarr2 shares many of the hallmarks of proteins found at the primary cilium or involved in ciliogenesis: it is targeted to the centrosome in cycling cells and to the basal body and axoneme of PC in quiescent cells; its depletion results in accelerated and uncontrolled cell growth resulting in impaired ciliogenesis.

Similar to many PC proteins, such as, Polaris/IFT88, IFT20 or IFT57 [26], [33], betaarr2 was found at the centrosome in cycling cells and more precisely at the proximal part of the centrioles (Figures 1 and 2). Although we could not find evidence for a role of betaarr2 in the basic functions of the centrosome, betaarr2 shares with other centrosome-associated proteins a role in cell cycle regulation. The centrosome participates in several different cell cycle regulatory events, such as G1/S transition, cytokinesis, and monitoring of DNA damage, functions which involve the recruitment of specific sets of proteins [34]. Recent studies showed that depletion of structural centrosomal proteins, such as PCM-1 or pericentrin results in a p53-dependent G1/S arrest [35], [36], suggesting that the centrosome itself is involved in cell cycle control. Consistent with these observations, we found that betaarrs-deficient cells do not respond properly to serum starvation, as shown by their persistent growth in low serum and their failure to enter in G0 phase, whereas they proliferate faster in high serum conditions (Figure 6). The strong additive effect of the simultaneous depletion of both betaarrs likely reflects the fact that each isoform may have specific points of impact.

A role of betaarr1 was reported in G1/S transition downstream of IGF receptor [37], and via a receptor-independent enhancement of p27 transcription, which, in turn, inhibits G1/S transition [38]. Consistent with our observations on 1KO MEFs (Figures 5 and 6), depletion of betaarr1 in the latter study was shown to increase cell proliferation. betaarr2 was also reported to control cell growth in response to nerve growth factor in PC12 cells [39]. However, the mechanism by which betaarr2 controls cell cycle appears to be different. betaarr2 interacts with mdm2, the E3 ubiquitin ligase controlling the stability of p53, a transcriptional factor which plays a major role in cell cycle regulation [40]. betaarr2 was specifically reported to actively exclude mdm2 from the nucleus [41], to stabilize p53 by this mechanism, leading to either induction of apoptosis [41] or cell cycle arrest at G2/M transition [41], [42]. Thus, the lack of betaarr2 would favour destabilization of p53 and then promote cell cycle progression and increased proliferation, as observed here in cells depleted for betaarr2 (Figures 5 and 6). Altogether, these data support the idea that betaarrs have distinct but converging roles in cell cycle regulation and control of cell proliferation.

Our results strikingly paralleled those reported on Polaris, a protein found at the centrosome in cycling cells, which is involved in intra-ciliary transport and required for ciliogenesis. Overexpression of Polaris prevented G1/S transition and induced apoptosis, whereas its depletion promoted cell-cycle progression and increased cell growth [26]. A role in cell cycle control is shared by other IFT proteins such as IFT27 [43] but not all [33]. Altogether, these notions highlight the functional connections between centrosome-associated proteins, IFT proteins and p53 and highlight the centrosome as a meeting point for both proliferative and anti-proliferative controllers [34].

Another similarity between betaarr2 and Polaris is that the increased proliferation observed in betaarrs-depleted cells is correlated with reduced ciliogenesis in response to serum starvation, as observed in betaarr-deficient MEF and siRNA-treated RPE1 cells (Figures 5 and 6 and ref [26]). In a recent study, which also reported the localization of betaarrs at PC, betaarrs-deficient MEF cells did not show ciliogenesis defects [44]. The discrepancy with our findings is likely due to differences in cell culture conditions. Indeed, the authors of the previous study found that only 20% wild-type MEF cells formed PC, consistent with what was previously described for MEF grown in high serum conditions [45]. In the present study, we analyzed ciliogenesis in response to serum starvation, a widely used experimental condition to induce PC assembly. In these conditions we repeatedly observed that approximately70% of wild-type MEF cells were ciliated (Figure 5), as described elsewhere [46]. Altogether, these data suggest that the effect of betaarrs expression on ciliogenesis is only observed upon serum starvation.

In addition, from our data, it appears that the effect on ciliogenesis is likely linked to uncontrolled proliferation rather than direct effect on the ciliogenesis itself. We observed a striking correlation between the inability to enter in G0 in response to serum starvation, increased proliferation and reduced ciliogenesis. Therefore, if betaarr-deficient cells are unable to enter in G0 even in response to serum starvation they would not be able to build a cilium. In addition, we observed an increased proportion of cycling cells among ciliated single betaarr1 and betaarr2 KO cells (Figure S9). Interestingly, an aberrant outgrowth of PC in cycling cells was recently described upon depletion of Cep97 and CP110 proteins [47]. These data suggest that depletion of betaarrs may also result in a disconnection between the presence of a PC and cell cycle arrest.

Although the betaarr-dependent control of PC formation reflects the role of these proteins on cell proliferation, a direct role in ciliogenesis or in the transport of PC proteins cannot be excluded. The constitutive interaction of betaarr2 with 14-3-3 and Kif3A (Figures 7 and 8), which are both involved in ciliogenesis, can support this hypothesis. In addition, betaarr2 interaction with Kif3A and 14-3-3 proteins might control its transport within PCs. Indeed, in photoreceptor cells, visual arrestin (varr) regulates the signalling activity of rhodopsin, the light-sensing GPCR. In response to light varr is transported from the inner segment (cell body) to the outer segment (rhodopsin containing compartment), through the connecting cilium, which is a modified PC [48]. In the absence of Kif3A, varr is unable to reach the outer segment in response to light [49], suggesting that Kif3A is responsible for its transport through the connecting cilium. Finally, in the absence of light, varr is also localized in the connecting cilium and at the basal body [50]-[53], paralleling our observations showing a constitutive targeting of betaarr2 to PC. The possible role of Kif3A in the targeting of betaarr2 to PC could not be tested in our cellular models, since depletion of Kif3A resulted in major ciliogenesis defects (Figure S10) as previously reported [25], [32], [54].

While this article was in preparation, a recent study reported that betaarrs mediate the interaction of smo with Kif3A leading to the targeting of active smo to PC [55]. Whether this observation could account for a more general function of betaarrs in the targeting of GPCRs to PCs is a key question to be addressed. Our preliminary results indicate that the Somatostatin type 3 receptor (SST3R), a GPCR described in neuronal PC [8], was efficiently targeted to the axoneme in betaarr-deficient cells (Figure S11). These data suggest that betaarrs are not implicated in the targeting of all GPCRs to PC. Interestingly, contrasting with what was reported for smo, activation of SST3R is not required for PC targeting, which rather appears constitutive (Figure S11 and [56]) and dependent on Bardet Bield Syndrome proteins [56].

Another open issue is the exact function of betaarr2 within the cilium in the context of GPCRs physiology. Our data indicate that betaarr2 is constitutively localized to PC: it was found within the axoneme in serum-starved cells and this localization was not modified by the expression of constitutively active form of smo (Figure 4 and data not shown). One of the key functions of betaarr2 at the plasma membrane is to mediate internalization of agonist-activated GPCRs through clathrin-coated pits. However, despite the presence of clathrin-coated pits at the base of primary cilia (unpublished observations), there is no evidence in the literature for internalization of proteins found in the membrane of PC. Finally, betaarr2 might participate in the desensitization of activated GPCRs localized at PC, as shown for odorant receptors in olfactory neurons [17], [57], [58] and reminiscent of the function of varr in the outer segment of visual cells. Interestingly, activated rhodopsin of the outer segment is not internalized in response to light [48], suggesting that in PCs, receptors might be sequestered from classical downregulation pathways involving clathrin-mediated endocytosis.

Dynamic of betaarr2 at the centrosome was analyzed by FRAP (fluorescence recovery after photobleaching). Hela cells expressing betaarr2-GFP were treated or not with nocodazole (1h, 37degreesC, 10 microM) and analyzed using a laser scanning confocal microscope (TCS SP2 AOBS, Leica) after excitation with a 488-nm laser line from an argon laser as previously described [66]. Briefly, a region containing the centrosome was exposed to two consecutive pulses of 1 second with 100% of the laser intensity, and recovery of fluorescence was analyzed for 90 seconds taking an image every 1.3 seconds. Images were then analyzed using Metamorph to quantify normalized fluorescence at the centrosome (see Methods). The final images were generated using NIH image () or scion image () and Photoshop (Adobe Systems Inc.).

To calculate normalized fluorescence of GFP or Cherry fusions at the centrosome, transfected HeLa cells were fixed and stained for pericentrin and the pericentrin staining was then used to define a region corresponding to the centrosome. Briefly, the option "Auto Threshold for light objects" allowed us to transform stainings in objects which were then circled by selecting the option "Create regions around objects" in Metamorph. The resulting regions were then transferred to the GFP or Cherry corresponding images, and the fluorescence intensity corresponding to GFP/Cherry in the centrosome (CE) was measured. To normalize these values to the local background, a region of the same size was selected outside the cell to measure the noise of the camera (CN) and another one in the cytoplasm (CY) of the same cell allowing us to normalize centrosome-associated signal to the expression level of the GFP/Cherry fusions in each cell. Normalized fluorescence at the centrosome was then calculated as follows: NF = (CE-CN)/(CY-CN). To measure the expression level of Ki-67 in nuclei of MEFs, DAPI staining was used to define a region corresponding to the nucleus of each cell as indicated above for centrosomes. Ki-67-associated fluorescence was then measured within these regions. To discriminate between Ki-67 negative and positive cells, the average fluorescence intensity of Ki-67 was measured in ciliated cells and nuclei were considered as positive if their Ki-67-associated fluorescence was above this average value.

The proliferation test was performed using UptiBlue reagent (Interchim, Montlucon, France) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, MEFs cells were seeded at 1000 cells/well (100 microL) in 96-well microtiterplates. Each assay was performed in triplicate. After 0, 24, 48 or 72 hours, 10 microL of UptiBlue working solution was added to each well and fluorescence was read at 590 nm on Typhoon(c) 9400 scanner (GE Healthcare, Piscataway, NJ, USA; with settings: excitation laser at 532 nm, filter 580BP30, PMT 350 V). For each cell line, proliferation rate was determined as a ratio of the fluorescence intensity emitted at lambda = 590 nm for time t less associated background above the fluorescence intensity emitted for time t = 0 less associated background.

Characterization of anti-betaarr2 antibodies. Description of the immunogenic peptides used to generate anti-betaarr2 polyclonal antibodies: The rARR rabbit polyclonal antibody is sold as an antibody against both betaarr2 and betaarr1 but a single amino-acid difference in the immunogenic peptide makes it more specific for betaarr2. The gBARR2 goat polyclonal was raised against a peptide specific of human betaarr2 and not conserved in betaarr1. However, a single amino acid difference between human and rodent betaarr2 is likely to explain its poor reactivity against murine endogenous betaarr2 observed in both western blot and immunofluorescence (data not shown). HeLa cells were transiently transfected with plasmids encoding for betaarr2-GFP, then fixed and stained for the anti-betaarr2 antibodies, including the rabbit polyclonal rARR anti-arrestin (A) and the goat polyclonal gBARR2 anti betaarrestin2 (B). In coloured images, betaarr2-GFP staining is in green, endogenous betaarr2 in red and nuclei stained with DAPI are in blue. Insets show higher magnifications of representative areas corresponding to the centrosome containing region of cells expressing (1) or not (2) GFP-betaarr2 in the same field. GFP-betaarr2 expressing cells showed increase staining with the anti-betaarr2 antibodies showing that they did work for immunofluorescence. In non-transfected cells, the antibodies showed a diffuse staining in the cytoplasm and illuminated two bright spots, suggesting that both antibodies are able to detect both overexpressed and endogenous betaarr2. Scale bars represent 5microm.

The rARR antibody is specific for betaarr2 and stains the centrosome. It has to be stressed here that, independently of the commercial source, we observed a variability between batches of commercial anti-betaarr2 antibodies; while almost all batches did detect overexpressed betaarr2, some were unable to detect endogenous betaarr2 in neither western-blot or immunofluorescence experiments. The efficiency of each batch was then tested by western-blot using WT and betaarrs-KO MEFs as described below. (A and B) betaarr2 expression was assessed in mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) derived from wild type (WT), betaarr2 deficient (2KO), both betaarr1 and betaarr2 deficient (1/2KO) mice, RPE1 (retinal pigment epithelial cells) or HeLa cells by western blotting (WB) using the rabbit polyclonal antibody against betaarr2 (rARR, (A)) or a monoclonal antibody against betaarr1 (mbeta1, (B)). An antibody against alpha-adaptin subunit of the clathrin adaptor complex AP2 was used as a loading control. (C) WT or 1/2KO MEFs were fixed and stained for the centrosomal marker gamma-tubulin (gamma-tub) and endogenous betaarr2 (rARR). Insets show higher magnifications of representative areas. Scale bar represents 5microm. (D) Centrosome-associated fluorescence intensity corresponding to rARR staining in 2KO and 1/2KO MEFs was normalized to that found for WT MEFs. Values are the means (+/- SD) of at least 20 cells from three independent experiments (**: p<0.001). The data show that the signals observed with the rARR antibody in both western-blot and immunofluorescence experiments do depend on the expression of betaarr2.

Targeting of betaarr2 to the centrosome does not depend on microtubules. To confirm that microtubles were effectively affected in live cells treated with nocodazole in Figure 3, control or nocodazole-treated cells were fixed and stained using antibodies against alpha-tubulin (alpha-tub) and Giantin, a Golgi marker. As expected, treatment of the cells with nocodazole resulted in disruption of microtubules and dispersion of the Golgi stacks in cell periphery.
