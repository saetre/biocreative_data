The DNA base excision repair pathway is responsible for removal of oxidative and endogenous DNA base damage in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes. This pathway involves formation of an apurinic/apyrimidinic (AP) site in the DNA, which is further processed to restore the integrity of the DNA. In Escherichia coli it has been suggested that the major mode of repair involves replacement of a single nucleotide at the AP site, based on repair synthesis studies using oligonucleotide substrates containing a unique uracil base. The mechanism of the post-incision steps of the bacterial base excision repair pathway was examined using a DNA plasmid substrate containing a single U:G base pair. Repair synthesis carried out by repair-proficient ung, recJ and xon E.coli cell extracts was analyzed by restriction endonuclease cleavage of the DNA containing the uracil lesion. It was found that replacement of the uracil base was always accompanied by replacement of several nucleotides ( approximately 15) 3' of the uracil and this process was absolutely dependent on initial removal of the uracil base by the action of uracil-DNA glycosylase. In contrast to findings with oligonucleotide substrates, replacement of just a single nucleotide at the lesion site was not detected. These results suggest that repair patch length may be substrate dependent and a re-evaluation of the post-incision steps of base excision repair is suggested.
