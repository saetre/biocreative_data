The full length-mouse XPC cDNA contains a 2703 bp orf which encodes a polypeptide containing 900 amino acids. Overall, there is 75% identity in nucleotide sequence and 73% identity in amino acid sequence between mouse and human genes. The C-terminal half is more conserved (80%) than the N-terminal half (65%). Northern analysis has revealed a constitutive expression pattern for both human and mouse transcripts in various tissues examined. However, high level expression was observed in liver, testis and kidney in both species. The human XPC gene was cloned from a cosmid library and the full-length gene was found to span -24 kb. Analysis of the genomic structure indicated that the transcribed sequence is divided into 15 exons.
