A new class of murine retrovirus-related sequences (MuRRS) is described. These 5.7 kb long transposon-like DNA-elements start and end with approximately 600 bp long repeats identical to previously identified solitary LTR-like elements (LTR-IS). There are about 50 - 100 5.7 kb elements and about 500 - 1000 solo LTR-IS elements per mouse haploid genome. Sequence analysis of one cloned MuRRS element revealed several possible open reading frames with partial sequence homologies to retroviral gag, pol and env genes.
