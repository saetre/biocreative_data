The forkhead domain (FHD)-containing developmental transcription factor FOXC1 is mutated in patients presenting with Axenfeld-Rieger malformations. In this paper, we report the introduction of positive, negative or neutral charged amino acids into critical positions within the forkhead domain of FOXC1 in an effort to better understand the essential structural and functional determinants within the FHD. We found that FOXC1 is intolerant of mutations at I87. Additionally, alterations of amino acids within alpha-helix 1 of the FOXC1 FHD affected both nuclear localization and transactivation. Amino acids within alpha-helix 3 were also found to be necessary for transactivation and can have roles in correct localization. Interestingly, changing amino acids within alpha-helix 3, particularly R127, resulted in altered DNA-binding specificity and granted FOXC1 the ability to bind to a novel DNA sequence. Given the limited topological variation of FHDs, due to the high conservation of residues, we anticipate that models of forkhead domain function derived from these data will be relevant to other members of the FOX family of transcription factors.

Autosomal dominant mutations in the FOX family transcription factor FOXC1 underlie Axenfeld-Rieger (AR) malformations mapping to human chromosome 6p25 (1,2), thought to arise because of defects in neural crest cell migration and differentiation (3) [for a review see (4,5)]. Patients with AR malformations present with ocular features that include iris hypoplasia, iridocorneal adhesions, posterior embryotoxon and corectopia. The most severe ocular consequence of AR malformations is the development of glaucoma, a progressively blinding condition, in 50% of the AR patients. Non-ocular features of AR malformations include dental and umbilical anomalies. Cardiac anomalies have been observed to infrequently cosegregate with AR malformations (6-8).

Work in animal models has demonstrated the importance of FOXC1 as a developmentally key transcription factor. Recombinant Foxc1 null mice die peri- or post-natally with massive skeletal, cardiac, ocular and urogenital anomalies (3,8-11). Heterozygous Foxc1+/- mice are viable but recapitulate the spectrum of ocular defects seen within humans carrying FOXC1 mutations (12). Some of these ocular anterior segment defects in heterozygous Foxc1+/- mice can be modified by Tyrosinase, a member of a family of genes involved in melanin biosynthesis (13). FOXC1 is also involved in TGF-beta signaling (3,14) and is required for the transcription of another important regulator of developmental processes, the T-box gene Tbx1 (15). The activation of Tbx1 can be induced by Shh, with induction mediated by FOXC proteins (15). Together with a highly related protein, FOXC2 (Figure 1), FOXC1 is thought to act as an important regulator of somitogenesis (15-17).

FOXC1 contains the forkhead domain (FHD), a highly conserved sequence of approximately 110 amino acids. The three-dimensional topology of the FHD was first resolved using X-ray crystallography on Foxa3 (formerly HNF3gamma) bound to a DNA target (18) and has since been studied using NMR analysis of FOXC2, Foxd3 and FOXO4 (19-21). This DNA-binding motif is a variant of the helix-turn-helix motif, consisting of three alpha-helices, two beta-sheets and two large loops that form 'wing-like' structures (18-21). This region functions as a DNA-binding domain and contains the sequences required for nuclear localization of FOXC1 (22-24).

In vitro site selection experiments were used to determine that FOXC1 bound a nine-base-pair core sequence 5'-GTAAATAAA-3' with high affinity (25). These experiments also found that when the FOXC1 FHD binds, it bends the DNA approximately94degrees, while in the context of full length FOXC1, the bound DNA is bent approximately112degrees (26). Experiments analyzing FOX binding sites upstream of the Tbx1 gene found that FOXC1 is also able to bind the DNA sequence 5'-AAAACAAACAGGC-3' in EMSAs (15).

Outside the FHD, FOXC1 contains N- and C-terminal transactivation domains, allowing FOXC1 to act as a transcriptional activator, as well as a transcriptional inhibitory domain C-terminal to the FHD (22). FOXC1 is phosphorylated, probably in the inhibitory domain region, but the functional significance of FOXC1 phosphorylation is undetermined (22).

All of the disease-causing missense mutations within FOXC1 identified to date in patients with AR malformations are located within the FHD (Table 1). Analyses of FOXC1 missense mutations characterized through both molecular modeling and biochemical means revealed several different modes of impairment to FOXC1 function (24,26,27). These impairments include defects in localization of FOXC1 to the nucleus, defects in DNA-binding capacity, defects to transactivation and alterations to DNA-binding specificity. One mutation (I87M) was found to reduce levels of FOXC1 either by destabilizing FOXC1 or by reducing efficiency of the translation of FOXC1 mRNA. These molecular defects do not appear to be dependent upon the position of the mutations within the FHD.

To deepen our understanding of FHD function, we have created a molecular model of the FOXC1 FHD to predict residues that are critical for function and structure of FOXC1. Critical amino acid positions within the FOXC1 FHD were chosen and converted to an alanine (neutral charge), glutamic acid (negative) or lysine (positive charged) residue. Our model of the FOXC1 FHD was used to predict the effect that these conversions would have on the structure of the FHD. The effect of these conversions on FOXC1 function was then determined by cell biology and biochemical analyses. Our results have revealed the locations of residues that are critical for the translocation of FOXC1 to the nucleus, that guide the interactions of FOXC1 with DNA and organize the FHD in such a manner that FOXC1 is stable, competent to bind DNA and able to activate transcription. We anticipate that this information will also allow prediction of the effects on structure and function of alterations of FHD amino acids of other members belonging to the FOX family of transcriptional regulators.

The FOXC1 pcDNA His/Max4 protein expression construct has been previously described (24). For mutagenesis reactions, a fragment of FOXC1 from 106 to 777 was PCR amplified and cloned into pGEM T Easy (Promega) using primers 5'-ggc tac acc gcc atg c-3' (forward) and 5'-gct ctc gat ctt ggg cac-3' (reverse). This was then subjected to mutagenesis using the Quickchangetrade mark (Stratagene) mutagenesis kit according to the manufacturer's protocol and primers summarized in Table 2, with the addition of 5% dimethylsulfoxide. The primers used for mutagenesis contained degenerate oligonucleotides at the site of interest, so that all the three desired mutagenesis products could be obtained from a single reaction. Potential mutant constructs were sequenced and confirmed mutant fragments subcloned back into the FOXC1 pcDNA His/Max4 construct. The final constructs were sequenced again to ensure the integrity of the construct.

FOXC1 was mutated independently to an alanine (A), a glutamate (E) or a lysine (K) residue at positions P79, L86, I87, I91, I126 and R127 by site-directed mutagenesis (Figure 1). The rationale for choosing these positions was based upon both molecular modeling and threading analyses indicating that these changes probably perturb FHD structure, as well as empirical observations from the studies of naturally occurring missense mutations at these positions (24,26,27).

Expression and western-blot analysis of the recombinant proteins revealed that all the plasmid constructs expressed recombinant FOXC1 with the exception of FOXC1 mutated at position 87 (Supplemental Figure 1). When I87 was converted to an A, E or K, the FOXC1 protein could not be detected by western-blot analysis (Figure 2B). Northern-blot analysis was carried out to ensure that mRNA was, in fact, being expressed from the transfected recombinant FOXC1 plasmid (Figure 2A). FOXC1 87A/E/K mRNA was detected by northern-blot analysis, but FOXC1 87A/E/K protein could not be detected by western-blot analysis. This finding is consistent with the notion that alterations of I87 drastically affect the cellular levels of soluble recombinant FOXC1 protein.

Previous work has shown that missense mutations within the FHD are able to disrupt the normal nuclear localization of FOXC1 in COS-7 cells (26). Based on this observation, the subcellular localization of the FOXC1 charge conversion proteins was tested. By immunofluorescence, the subcellular localization of the FOXC1 mutant proteins was found to be highly variable and dependent upon both the position of the amino acid change and the charge of the amino acid change (Figure 3 and Table 4). With the exception of amino acid residue R127, conversion of the amino acid into the neutral alanine amino acid had the least severe disruption on nuclear localization of FOXC1. Nuclear localization was least perturbed by the presence of the neutral charged P79A (91% nuclear), with the charged amino acids P79E and P79K being more disruptive to FOXC1 localization, at 80 and 75% nuclear respectively. At position L86, the change to the uncharged alanine disrupts the nuclear localization of FOXC1 to a degree similar to what is seen with P79K. Again, when charged amino acids are substituted for leucine at position 86, subcellular localization becomes more perturbed (L86E at 51% nuclear, L86K at 64% nuclear) than what is seen with alanine substitution (72% nuclear). The localization of FOXC1 that is observed with mutations at amino acid positions 79 and 86 is predominantly nuclear within individual cells, but is not confined as strictly to the nucleus compared to cells expressing wild-type FOXC1. When charged amino acids are substituted for the isoleucine at position 91, the disruption becomes severe, with 25% of the population showing nuclear localization for I91E and only 5% of the cellular population showing nuclear staining when FOXC1 carries the I91K mutation. I91A shows levels of nuclear localization that are similar to levels seen with L86E. The differences to nuclear localization upon substitution of differently charged amino acids is most pronounced in I126 and R127, both of which are located in alpha-helix 3 of the FHD. The substitution of charged residues at I126 prevents the strict nuclear localization of FOXC1 in any of the cells in the population, leading instead to mixed nuclear and cytoplasmic staining as well as only cytoplasmic staining. The mislocalization of FOXC1 I126E and I126K appears to be different from the mislocalization when the other amino acids are altered. As can be seen in Figure 3, a major part of the immunofluorescent signal given by these mutations appears to localize to a perinuclear space, within what is likely the endoplasmic reticulum, a site of protein degradation. Conversely, FOXC1 carrying the I126A alteration shows much stronger nuclear localization, where levels are similar to what is seen with P79K or L86A. Finally, FOXC1 R127A, at 56% nuclear localization, does have a nuclear localization defect, but this is much less severe than the disruption seen for FOXC1 R127E, in which mislocalization is complete. Interestingly, nuclear localization of FOXC1 R127K approaches wild-type levels (88%) with little defect in localization seen.

As the FHD is the domain through which FOXC1-DNA interactions are mediated, it was of interest to test how the altering of the amino acid and charge at different positions affects the ability of FOXC1 to bind an in vitro derived FOXC1 binding site (Table 3) (24,25). As seen in Figure 4, FOXC1 with alterations to amino acids P79, L86 or I91 is still able to bind the FOXC1 binding site, although in some cases this binding capacity is reduced. The binding capacity of FOXC1 P79A and P79K is at wild-type levels or near wild-type levels, while P79E appears to bind with a 3- to 4-fold reduction in affinity for the FOXC1 binding site (Figure 4A). The binding capacity of FOXC1 L86A, E or K is at wild-type FOXC1 levels or near wild-type FOXC1 levels (Figure 4B). Binding capacity of FOXC1 with alterations at I91 is reduced in the cases of I91A and I91K with 3- to 4-fold reductions in affinity for the FOXC1 binding site (Figure 4C). FOXC1 I91E binds the FOXC1 binding site with wild-type FOXC1 affinity.

The deficiencies in FOXC1 binding are more pronounced when A, E or K are introduced at positions I126 or R127. Binding capacity of FOXC1 is completely disrupted by the presence of a lysine or glutamic acid at 126 (Figure 4D). When an alanine is present, binding capacity is retained; however, there is an approximate 4-fold increase in the amount of FOXC1 I126A protein required for wild-type levels of DNA binding. Two of the R127 changes, R127A and R127K, show residual binding capacity, but the levels of this capacity are reduced to well below 10x wild-type FOXC1 levels (Figure 4E). The R127E mutation shows no capacity for DNA binding by this assay.

It has been shown previously that mutations within alpha-helix 3 are able to alter the binding site specificity of FOXC1 (24). It is also known that the specificity of many protein-DNA interactions rely upon the interactions of charged amino acid side chains such as arginines, lysines and glutamic acids, and the charges inherent in the DNA (29). We therefore utilized a series of FOXC1 binding site variants (Table 3) to test whether, in fact, any of the mutations tested in this study were able to alter the binding site specificity of FOXC1. All the altered FOXC1 molecules appeared to bind the variant oligonucleotides in a pattern similar to that seen for FOXC1 (data not shown), with the exception of R127A and R127K (Figure 5) which display altered binding site specificity in comparison with wild-type FOXC1. R127A has a reduced binding affinity for variant oligonucleotides 1 and 2 compared to wild-type FOXC1 affinity for these oligonucleotides (Figure 5A). Interestingly, while wild-type FOXC1 is unable to bind oligonucleotide 7, the R127A FOXC1 recombinant protein is able to weakly bind this variant oligonucleotide. In a manner that is strikingly different from wild-type FOXC1 or any of the other mutant FOXC1 proteins tested in this and other studies, R127K has an affinity for variant oligonucleotide 7 that is stronger than the affinity of FOXC1 R127K for the FOXC1 binding site (Figure 5B). These data indicate that alpha helix 3 of the FHD in FOXC1 may play a strong role in regulating the specificity of FOXC1-DNA interactions.

FOXC1 is able to potently drive expression of a reporter construct when the FOXC1 binding site is present in front of the construct promoter (see Figure 6 inset). The effect of the different charges at the different positions on the ability of FOXC1 to drive transactivation was tested. The majority of constructs tested had severely reduced transactivation activity, including those FOXC1 mutations that retained DNA-binding activity (FOXC1 79A/E, 86A/E/K, 91A/E/K, 126A). Notable exceptions were FOXC1 P79K, R127A and R127K. FOXC1 P79K retained an average transactivation capacity of 66% of wild-type activity, while FOXC1 R127A and R127K had transactivation capacities of 36 and 38% of wild-type FOXC1 activity, respectively.

These experiments provide an in-depth analysis of critical positions within the FHD delineating the nature of essential structural and functional determinants within the FOXC1 FHD (Table 5). This study represents the largest analysis of the FHD domain undertaken for any FOX class protein to date. Since the FHD is a highly conserved domain, with limited three-dimensional topological variations, this study should facilitate the modeling of missense mutations within the FHD for all the members of the FOX family of transcription factors.

Wild-type FOXC1 localizes completely to the nucleus in almost all cells within a given cell population (24,26,27). To date, no mechanism has been identified whereby FOXC1 is differentially localized in response to environmental stimuli or post-translational modifications, such as the insulin-stimulated phosphorylation of FOXO proteins by PKB and subsequent redistribution of FOXO proteins to the cytosol [for a review see (30)]. When analyzing these mutations of FOXC1, mixed localization of FOXC1 to both the nucleus and the cytoplasm of the cell is often seen. This incomplete localization could be due to inefficient transport of defective FOXC1 molecules into the nucleus, or, alternatively, may reflect a defect in the ability of FOXC1 to be retained within the nucleus.

Alterations at position 79 located N-terminal to alpha-helix 1 cause the mildest disruptions of the positions tested herein, to the nuclear localization of FOXC1 (Table 4). P79 is oriented in such a way that the amino acid residue extends away from the DNA (Figure 7A) and thus is unlikely to be critical for formation of the FOXC1-DNA complex. These data would indicate that the FHD must be largely intact and the native structure preserved, as none of the alterations at position 79 appeared to alter either the affinity of FOXC1 for the FOXC1 binding site or the specificity of FOXC1 affinity for the FOXC1 binding site. Changes from a proline at amino acid 79, however, do appear to change the overall structure of FOXC1 sufficiently so that problems with not only the distribution of FOXC1, but also its transactivation do occur. It is interesting that while FOXC1 P79K shows more of a defect in FOXC1 subcellular localization (25% mislocalization; Table 4) compared with P79A/E it is the only one of the three that retains the capacity for transactivation, even at 66% of wild-type levels (Figure 6). Clearly, while the conformation of FOXC1 P79K is altered suffiently as to result in a defect in the way this mutant protein interacts with the nuclear transport machinery, the molecule is intact enough to both bind the FOXC1 binding site and participate in transcription from a reporter construct.

The mutations located within alpha-helix 1 can have mild (86 A/E/K and 91 A/E/K) or more severe (87 A/E/K) effects. Previous work has shown that a naturally occurring I87M missense mutation is able to reduce the levels of FOXC1 protein produced in COS-7 cells (24), similar to what is seen in this study with the I87 A/E/K mutations. These data imply that I87 is critical in the formation of a stable FHD and FOXC1 molecule with alterations of the isoleucine at position 87 reducing the levels of soluble recombinant FOXC1 protein.

The FOXC1 86 A/E/K and 91 A/E/K mutations impede the exclusive localization of FOXC1 to the nucleus (Figure 3 and Table 4). The localization defects to FOXC1 91 A/E/K are interesting for two reasons. Previous characterizations of naturally occurring FOXC1 L86F, I91S, I91T mutations indicate that mutations to position 91 severely impair nuclear localization, while the L86F mutation shows wild-type nuclear localization of FOXC1 (26,27). Previous work has also defined a nuclear localization accessory signal that lies within amino acid residues 78-93, encompassing the I91 position (22). Molecular modeling predicts that I91 is oriented inwards towards the hydrophobic core of the FHD (Figure 7A). Taken together, these data indicate that I91 plays a critical role in organizing the FHD with respect to interactions between the nuclear transport machinery and FOXC1.

All six of these helix 1 mutations severely disrupt FOXC1 transactivation but retain the ability to bind the FOXC1 binding site, though DNA binding is reduced with some of the mutations. Thus, while the FHD is grossly intact, these helix 1 mutations must have effects that extend beyond the FHD, either increasing the potency of the inhibitory domain C-terminal to the FHD and/or preventing function of both the N-terminal and C-terminal transactivation domains of FOXC1 (22). Amino acids L86 and I91 therefore appear to be critical in organizing the structure of the FHD in such a manner that the FOXC1 molecule as a whole is transcriptionally competent.

Mutations in helix 3 appear to have drastic effects on the function of FOXC1 with respect to localization, transactivation and/or DNA-binding specificity. Conversion of I126 to a neutrally charged alanine residue perturbs both the subcellular distribution of FOXC1 and DNA-binding capacity of FOXC1 to some extent, but the FHD domain retains enough wild-type structure to facilitate FOXC1 localization and DNA binding. Molecular modeling of the FHD predicts that I126 is an important residue in the formation of a hydrophobic core bounded by the three primary alpha-helices (24). The substitution to an alanine is likely to preserve the hydrophobicity of the core, allowing the basic structure of the FHD to remain intact, while the charged substitutions (FOXC1 126E and 126K) would introduce hydrophilic amino acid residues into the hydrophobic core, disrupting the FOXC1-DNA interactions. All three of the FOXC1 126 constructs fail to transactivate gene expression (Figure 6). These data imply that although FOXC1 I126A retains enough native structure to allow both FOXC1 interactions with the nuclear transport machinery and FOXC1-DNA interactions, the overall structure of FOXC1 is altered to an extent that perturbs the transactivation domains that lie at the N and C terminals of the FOXC1 protein. It is also possible that the change in conformation enhances the inhibitory effects of the inhibitory domain rather than diminishing the function of the transactivation domains.

The R127 position is a highly conserved position in FOX proteins and again, conservation of the amino acid charge causes the least disruption of FOXC1 localization. Interestingly, both FOXC1 R127A and K, while still binding the FOXC1 binding site with reduced affinity, were found to have alterations to binding-site specificity compared to both wild-type FOXC1 and each other (Figure 5). The specificity of binding of FOXC1 R127A appears to become less stringent with binding of variant oligonucleotides 6-9, while conversely, the binding specificity of R127K appears to be altered so that this FOXC1 molecule now has a higher affinity for variant oligonucleotide 7 (gtaaattaa) than for the FOXC1 binding site (gtaaataaa) (Figure 5).

Resolution of the crystal structure of FOXA2 (18) and NMR of the solution structure of FOXC2 (20), the latter containing a FHD 97% identical to that of FOXC1, indicates that helix 3 lies across the DNA in the major groove, possibly functioning as a recognition helix. Previous work has shown that an I126M missense mutation is able to alter the binding specificity of FOXC1 (24), though not to the same extent as what is seen with 127K. The crystal and NMR resolved structures show that the R127 side chain extends away from the amphipathic helix 3 and is likely to be a contact point between FOXC1 and DNA. A molecular model, based on threading experiments in which FOXC1 was threaded through FOXC2 coordinates, shows the R127 residue extending away from alpha-helix 3, into the major groove of the DNA (Figure 7A). Thus, the positively charged 127K would attract the negatively charged DNA, whereas 127A would neither attract nor repulse. Hence, both these FOXC1 constructs would still be able to bind. The presence of the negative charge at this contact point would create repulsion between FOXC1 R127E and the DNA.

In spite of showing a severe reduction in binding to the FOXC1 binding site, both FOXC1 R127A and R127K are able to drive expression of a reporter construct, at levels that are 36% and 38% of wild-type FOXC1 levels, respectively (Figure 6). It would appear that, based on the levels of transcription relative to the levels of binding, the transactivation domains are properly organized in FOXC1 R127A/K molecules. These data indicate that the key role of R127 is to function in the proper recognition and binding of the FOXC1 binding site, as well as indicating that R127 does not function to organize the FHD in such a manner as to make FOXC1 transcriptionally competent.

It remains a formal possibility that the FOXC1 mutants that are able to bind DNA by EMSA, but show a transactivation defect in in vivo luciferase assays, may have an in vivo defect in DNA binding that underlies the transactivation defect. However, data from the FOXC1 R127A and R127K mutants are not consistent with this possibility. These two mutants retain sufficient DNA binding to facilitate transactivation, indicating that EMSA experiments may be more sensitive to defects in DNA binding than the transactivation assays. Further investigation of the consequences of FOXC1 mutations upon FOXC1-DNA binding and transactivation functions will necessitate utilization of bona fide FOXC1 target genes in the context of native chromatin. Such investigations are currently underway.

The FHD is highly conserved, and structural studies have shown limited three-dimensional variation between different FOX FHDs which implies limited variation in modes of DNA recognition. The structural basis of differences in DNA sequence recognition remains undetermined; however, there is evidence that the third helix, which is positioned in the major groove of DNA (31), and the second wing (25) guide protein-DNA interactions. Rather than alterations in the gross topology of the FHD being the basis of DNA recognition, it is thought that differences in charge along the interface between the FHD and DNA provide the basis for sequence specificity (21). Differences in charge along the interface between the FOXC1 binding site and helix-3 of the FOXC1 FHD are likely to underlie the alterations in DNA-binding specificities that are seen in FOXC1 127A and 127K mutant proteins.

A ribbon model showing the positions of the disease-causing missense mutations in the FHD of FOXC1 is shown in Figure 7A. A wire diagram summary of the functional sub-domains of the FOXC1 FHD is shown in Figure 7B. As amino acids predicted to be critical for FOXC1 structure on the basis of this model were actually found to be key determinants of FOXC1 structure and function by our subsequent biochemical analyses, we have confidence that this FOXC1 model has further predictive value.

Finally, this study illustrates the success in merging predictive bioinformatic analyses with experimental cell biology to achieve testable models of protein structure. These studies demonstrate the functional importance of not only the individual amino acids within the FHD of FOXC1 but also demonstrate how alpha-helix 1 and alpha-helix 3 secondary structures in the FHD are involved in FOXC1 function. Helix 1 appears to be involved in the organization of the FHD in such a manner that FOXC1 can be translocated to or retained within the nucleus and is transcriptionally active. Helix 3 appears to also be involved in organization of the FHD so that FOXC1 nuclear translocation or retention occurs and FOXC1 is transcriptionally competent; it also plays a major role in controlling FOXC1-DNA interactions.

Given the high degree of conservation between FHD domains within the FOX family, with respect to the three dimensional topology (18-21), this combination of biological and computational analysis is a framework which will allow for predictive modeling of changes within the FHDs not only for members of the C class of FOX proteins but also for FHDs of other FOX classes as well.

 Conversion of R127 into an alanine or lysine residue alters the binding specificity of FOXC1. FOXC1 containing cell extracts were incubated with 32P-labeled FOXC1 binding site or variant oligonucleotides (see Table 3) and resolved by native PAGE. Position of the predominant FOXC1-DNA complex is indicated with the filled gray arrowhead, an asterisk indicates oligonucleotides that the FOXC1 constructs bind with altered affinity. FOXC1 127A no longer binds oligonucleotides 1 and 2 while binding oligonucleotide 7. FOXC1 127K binds oligonucleotide 7 with a greater affinity than its affinity for the FOXC1 binding site.
