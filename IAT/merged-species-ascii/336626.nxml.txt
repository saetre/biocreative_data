The finger motif is a tandemly repeated DNA-binding domain recently identified in the primary structure of several eukaryotic transcriptional regulatory proteins. It was first described for Xenopus TFIIIA, a factor required for transcription of 5S ribosomal genes and subsequently identified in regulatory proteins from other eukaryotic organisms including yeast, Drosophila and mammals. In this paper we report the isolation and characterization of two human cDNA clones both encoding for multifingered protein products. Transcriptional studies indicate that the two finger genes are expressed in a variety of human tissues. Moreover, upon in vitro induced terminal differentiation of human HL-60 and THP-1 myeloid cell lines the expression of both genes is drastically reduced. These data provide support for the existence of a human multigene family coding for regulatory finger proteins which are likely involved in the processes of cell differentiation and/or proliferation.
