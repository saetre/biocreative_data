Phosphorylation of histone H2AX on Ser 139 (gammaH2AX) is one of the earliest events in the response to DNA double-strand breaks; however, the subsequent removal of gammaH2AX from chromatin is less understood, despite being a process tightly coordinated with DNA repair. Previous studies in yeast have identified the Pph3 phosphatase (the PP4C orthologue) as important for the dephosphorylation of gammaH2AX. By contrast, work in human cells attributed this activity to PP2A. Here, we report that PP4 contributes to the dephosphorylation of gammaH2AX, both at the sites of DNA damage and in undamaged chromatin in human cells, independently of a role in DNA repair. Furthermore, depletion of PP4C results in a prolonged checkpoint arrest, most likely owing to the persistence of mediator of DNA damage checkpoint 1 (MDC1) at the sites of DNA lesions. Taken together, these results indicate that PP4 is an evolutionarily conserved gammaH2AX phosphatase.

In response to DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs), the histone H2A variant H2AX is rapidly phosphorylated by the phosphatidylinositol(3) kinase-like kinases ATM, DNA-PKcs and ATR (ataxia telangiectasia mutated, DNA-dependent protein kinase catalytic subunit and ataxia telangiectasia and Rod3 related, respectively) to form gammaH2AX (Rogakou et al, 1998). This phosphorylation event produces a large chromatin domain of up to 1 Mb surrounding DNA lesions, which acts as a signal for the recruitment and accumulation of DNA repair and signalling proteins (Rogakou et al, 1999; Celeste et al, 2003). For example, the checkpoint mediator MDC1 (mediator of DNA damage checkpoint 1) binds to gammaH2AX directly through an interaction between the MDC1 tandem BRCT domains and an H2AX epitope encompassing phosphoserine 139 and its free carboxyl terminus (Stucki et al, 2005). The gammaH2AX-MDC1 complex, in turn, promotes the recruitment of many proteins such as 53BP1 (tumour protein p53-binding protein 1), NBS1 (Nijmegen breakage syndrome 1), RNF8 (ring-finger protein 8) and BRCA1 (breast cancer 1 early onset) to mediate DNA repair and checkpoint signalling (Harper & Elledge, 2007).

Although the formation of gammaH2AX and its role in promoting protein recruitment to the sites of DNA damage are becoming increasingly understood, much less is known about how and why it is removed from chromatin once DNA repair has been effected. The removal of gammaH2AX from sites of DNA damage is evidently tightly regulated, as it is closely correlated with DNA repair. Mechanisms must therefore exist to restrict gammaH2AX to sites of DNA lesions. These systems most likely comprise phosphatases that erase the gammaH2AX histone marker and histone/nucleosome remodelling activities that remove gammaH2AX from sites of DNA damage (Linger & Tyler, 2007). How these two processes integrate together is so far not understood.

Work in budding yeast recently identified the product of the PPH3 gene as the sole gammaH2AX phosphatase in this organism (Keogh et al, 2006). Pph3 encodes the orthologue of the mammalian PP4 phosphatase catalytic subunit (PP4C; Cohen et al, 1990; Ronne et al, 1991; Brewis et al, 1993). The yeast PP4 complex does not seem to have a direct function in DNA repair but rather acts to couple DSB repair with termination of checkpoint signalling, a process commonly referred to as checkpoint recovery (Keogh et al, 2006). The role of Pph3 in checkpoint recovery is at least in part due to its function as a gammaH2AX phosphatase, as the delay in checkpoint recovery manifested by pph3Delta cells is largely alleviated by the expression of a non-phosphorylatable H2A mutant (Keogh et al, 2006). Taken together, these results indicate that the formation of the gammaH2AX chromatin domain and its dissolution are important in the control of checkpoint signalling. By contrast, recent work in human cells attributed the function of gammaH2AX phosphatase to PP2A rather than PP4 (Chowdhury et al, 2005), raising doubts about the function of PP4 in the dephosphorylation of gammaH2AX in species other than yeast.

Here, we address directly whether PP4 contributes to the dephosphorylation of gammaH2AX in human cells. First, we show that immunopurified PP4 readily dephosphorylates gammaH2AX in vitro. Depletion of PP4C by RNA interference in cycling or irradiated cells results in increased steady-state levels of gammaH2AX. Furthermore, depletion of PP4C slows down the turnover of gammaH2AX after the pharmacological inhibition of ATM and DNA-PK, indicating that PP4C is a physiological gammaH2AX phosphatase. Consistent with this idea, depletion of PP4C results in persistent gammaH2AX foci-positive cells, suggesting that PP4 acts at the sites of DNA damage. Intriguingly, dissolution of gammaH2AX foci in PP4C-depleted cells is nevertheless observed 6 h post-irradiation despite the persistence of phosphorylated H2AX in the chromatin fraction. These results indicate that PP4 counteracts gammaH2AX not only at the sites of DNA damage but also in undamaged chromatin. Finally, we observe a checkpoint recovery defect associated with the depletion of PP4C, suggesting that PP4 has a function in the termination of checkpoint signalling. Taken together, these results indicate that PP4 is an authentic gammaH2AX phosphatase important for the spatio-temporal regulation of the DNA damage checkpoint.

In yeast, Pph3 encodes the yeast orthologue of human PP4C, which is part of a protein complex composed of Pph3, Psy2 and Psy4 (Gavin et al, 2002; Ho et al, 2002; Gingras et al, 2005). This complex is conserved in human cells and contains, in addition to PP4C, the PP4R2 and PP4R3 regulatory subunits. As PP2A rather than PP4 has been implicated as a mammalian gammaH2AX phosphatase, we sought to determine whether human PP4 can also dephosphorylate gammaH2AX. First, we tested whether purified PP4 dephosphorylates gammaH2AX in vitro. For this purpose, we acid-extracted histones from U2OS cells irradiated with a dose of 100 Gy to obtain histone preparations enriched in gammaH2AX (supplementary Fig S1 online). As a source of phosphatases, we immunopurified epitope-tagged PP1C, PP2ACalpha, PP4C or the catalytically inactive PP4C-H56Q and PP4C-R86A mutants from stably transfected 293 cells where the expression of epitope-tagged PP2ACalpha and PP4C was found to be near wild-type levels (supplementary Fig S2 online). We opted to immunopurify protein phosphatase complexes rather than to purify free catalytic subunits to retain as much as possible the subunit composition of the PP2A and PP4 holoenzyme complexes. This approach is important to minimize a well-known loss of substrate specificity seen with isolated catalytic subunits (Tung et al, 1985), as their regulatory proteins allow the Ser/Thr phosphatases to interact with various targets under appropriate regulation. By using the criterion of activity against 6,8-difluoro-4-methylumbelliferyl phosphate, all wild-type phosphatase complexes were found to be active, whereas the catalytically inactive PP4C mutants had negligible activity (supplementary Fig S2 online). As shown in Fig 1, PP2ACalpha can readily dephosphorylate gammaH2AX, as reported previously (Chowdhury et al, 2005). Furthermore, PP4C-but neither PP1 nor the PP4C phosphatase-dead mutants-also robustly dephosphorylates gammaH2AX in a dose-dependent manner (Fig 1A-C). Finally, we immunoprecipitated epitope-tagged PP4R2, the orthologue of yeast Psy4, as a means of immunopurifying PP4C in complex with regulatory subunits. As shown in Fig 1D, immunoprecipitates of PP4R2 are able to dephosphorylate gammaH2AX robustly to a level that is at least equivalent to immunopurified PP4C. From these results, we conclude that PP4C acts as a gammaH2AX phosphatase in vitro.

Next, we examined the impact of PP4C and PP2AC depletion on the total levels of gammaH2AX. We transfected small interfering RNA (siRNA) duplexes to deplete PP4C or PP2AC from U2OS cells (Fig 2A). As PP2AC is encoded by two genes in the human genome, giving rise to two proteins-alpha and beta-that are 97% identical to each other (Zhou et al, 2003), our targeting duplexes were designed to silence the expression of both proteins. Using this strategy, siRNA-mediated depletion of PP4C and PP2ACalpha/beta in U2OS cells decreased the levels of both catalytic subunits to about 20% of the control levels. Levels of gammaH2AX were estimated by immunoblotting before or 1-8 h after a 10 Gy dose of X-rays. As shown in Fig 2A, depletion of PP4C and PP2AC each resulted in a marked increase in the total levels of gammaH2AX in both non-irradiated and irradiated cells. To control for off-target effects, we repeated the experiment using other siRNAs and obtained similar results (supplementary Fig S3 online). Depletion of PP4R2 also resulted in an increase in the total levels of gammaH2AX (Fig 2B), placing PP4R2 as part of a PP4C-containing complex that regulates the levels of gammaH2AX in human cells. Furthermore, irradiation of cells with a 10 Gy dose of X-rays did not induce rapid apoptosis in PP4C- and PP2AC-depleted cells, suggesting that the persistence of gammaH2AX was independent of apoptosis (supplementary Fig S4 online). To test whether this increase in phosphorylation was due to lingering DSBs imparted by a DNA repair defect, we examined DSB rejoining kinetics in control, PP2AC- and PP4C-depleted cells by neutral comet assays. As shown in Fig 2C,D, PP2AC-silenced cells are mildly impaired in the repair of X-ray-induced DSBs, which is consistent with the previously described function of PP2AC in the repair of camptothecin-induced lesions (Chowdhury et al, 2005). By contrast, PP4C-silenced cells underwent DNA repair as efficiently as control cells. These data suggest that silencing PP2AC might lead to lingering DSBs that could affect steady-state phosphorylation of H2AX in human cells. By contrast, PP4C reduces the levels of gammaH2AX independently of a role in DNA repair.

PP2A-type enzymes have been linked to gammaH2AX through the regulation of ATM activity (Goodarzi et al, 2004). Therefore, we sought to test whether PP4 acts directly on gammaH2AX or indirectly by promoting the activity of ATM or DNA-PK, the two main H2AX kinases (Stiff et al, 2004). For this purpose, we examined the turnover of gammaH2AX after the combined inhibition of ATM and DNA-PK. In preliminary studies, we found that a combination of the ATM inhibitor KU55933 and the DNA-PKcs inhibitor (DNA-PKi) KU57788 suppressed the irradiation-induced formation of gammaH2AX (supplementary Fig S5 online). Therefore, we treated siRNA-transfected cells with both inhibitors 60 min post-irradiation to inhibit the phosphorylation of H2AX, and monitored the decay of gammaH2AX by immunoblotting. Using this experimental scheme, depletion of PP4C resulted in slower kinetics of H2AX dephosphorylation (Fig 2E). These results indicate that PP4C can bring about dephosphorylation of H2AX in vivo, independently of an effect on ATM and DNA-PK.

To identify the pools of gammaH2AX targeted by PP4, we assessed the kinetics of gammaH2AX focus formation and dissolution by indirect immunofluorescence (Fig 3A). To support the gammaH2AX data, we also examined MDC1 foci dynamics, as the recruitment of MDC1 to DSB sites occurs through a direct interaction with gammaH2AX (Stucki et al, 2005; Fig 3B). MDC1 foci therefore represent a functional readout of gammaH2AX at DSB sites. In contrast to the result shown in Fig 2A, gammaH2AX foci diminished rapidly in both PP4C- and PP2AC-depleted cells (Fig 3A). However, as shown in Fig 3A and quantified in Fig 3C, PP4C-depleted cells showed a slower decrease in gammaH2AX foci-positive cells than control-transfected cells during the recovery from irradiation, whereas depletion of PP2AC did not affect gammaH2AX foci kinetics. The slower dissolution of gammaH2AX foci in PP4C-depleted cells was observed with a second independent siRNA (Fig 3D) and was rescued by the introduction of an siRNA-resistant PP4C cDNA (supplementary Fig S6 online), confirming the specificity of the phenotype. In addition, MDC1 foci dynamics closely matched those of the gammaH2AX foci (Fig 3B,E). We also examined the dissolution of irradiation-induced gammaH2AX foci after the addition of the ATM (KU55933) and DNA-PK (KU57788) inhibitors to exclude the possibility that depletion of PP4 results in an increase in the activity of ATM or DNA-PK. As shown in Fig 3F, we found that the depletion of PP4C slowed the rapid dissolution of gammaH2AX foci. Finally, we present as supplementary information online data examining gammaH2AX focus morphology in PP4-depleted cells that are also consistent with a delay in focus dissolution (supplementary Fig S7 online). From these observations, we conclude that PP4 could dephosphorylate gammaH2AX at the sites of DNA damage, whereas PP2A might not have a principal function at these sites after treatment with irradiation. However, other mechanisms must also be important to remove this histone marker from the chromatin that surrounds the DSB.

The persistence of irradiation-induced phosphorylation of H2AX in PP4- or PP2A-depleted cells, as detected by immunoblotting (Fig 2), conflicts with our observation that dissolution of gammaH2AX foci still occurs in those cells, despite being slowed in the case of PP4. As the removal of gammaH2AX from repaired chromatin is most likely to be the result of the combined action of phosphatases and histone exchange (Heo et al, 2008), we assessed whether the lingering gammaH2AX observed in PP4-depleted cells is found in the nucleoplasm or associated with the chromatin after cell fractionation (Mendez & Stillman, 2000). We monitored the distribution of histone H3 to estimate nucleosome eviction or exchange. In the absence of irradiation, neither histone H3 nor gammaH2AX was detected in the nuclear soluble fraction of control-transfected cells (supplementary Fig S8 online). After irradiation, or in PP4C-depleted cells, we observed an increase in gammaH2AX and histone H3 in the soluble fraction, suggesting that gammaH2AX stimulates histone exchange, as recently shown (Fig 3G; Heo et al, 2008). Nevertheless, we found that most of the persistent gammaH2AX seen in PP4C-depleted cells remained associated with the chromatin fraction, despite the detectable increase in histone exchange or eviction (Fig 3G). On the basis of these results, we conclude that PP4 dephosphorylates gammaH2AX primarily in the chromatin rather than in the nucleoplasm. A surprising corollary to these results is that recycling gammaH2AX into chromatin might be an important step before its dephosphorylation. Indeed, as extensive chromatin remodelling and nucleosome eviction occurs during DSB repair, we propose that cells might have co-opted this process to promote the rapid removal of gammaH2AX and dephosphorylation.

The observation that focused dissolution of MDC1 is slowed after the depletion of PP4C suggests that PP4 might antagonize checkpoint signalling by stimulating focus disassembly at the sites of DNA damage. This possibility echoes the situation in yeast, in which Pph3 promotes G2/M checkpoint recovery (Keogh et al, 2006). Therefore, we established a system that monitors recovery from the G2/M arrest after irradiation treatment (Fig 4A). By using this experimental scheme, we find that the percentage of phospho-histone H3-positive cells 1 h post-irradiation is comparable among control and PP4C siRNA-transfected cells, indicating that PP4 is not involved in the initiation of the G2/M checkpoint (Fig 4B,C). However, at later time points, we observed that control cells began entering mitosis 7 h post-irradiation, whereas PP4C-depleted cells began entering mitosis more than 9 h after the initial arrest (Fig 4D; supplementary Fig S9 online). Seen from another angle, at the 8 h post-irradiation time point, PP4C-depleted cells showed a 3.3-fold reduction in the number of cells that entered mitosis (Fig 4B,C). These data indicate that PP4 has an important and evolutionarily conserved function during recovery from checkpoint arrest.

In conclusion, our results indicate that PP4 is a gammaH2AX phosphatase in human cells that acts on gammaH2AX not only at chromatin surrounding DNA damage but also at intact chromatin and that it is required for recovery from the DNA damage checkpoint (Fig 4E). The function of PP4 in the dephosphorylation of gammaH2AX is therefore evolutionarily conserved, whereas that of PP2A seems to have been acquired during eukaryotic evolution (or lost by budding yeast). We made the surprising observation that PP4 and PP2A do not act redundantly. PP4 dephosphorylates gammaH2AX at irradiation-induced DSBs, whereas PP2A has a minimal function at those sites. Our finding conflicts with a previously published report (Chowdhury et al, 2005), in which PP2AC-depleted cells showed persistent gammaH2AX foci after treatment with camptothecin (a topoisomerase I inhibitor). Here, we note the possibility that PP4 and PP2A might respond to different types of DNA damage. In addition, the delayed kinetics of dissolution of gammaH2AX foci, which was seen by Chowdhury et al (2005) in PP2AC-depleted cells, could also simply be due to the observed DNA repair defect. Future work will be aimed at deciphering whether PP4 and PP2A have distinct functions in the turnover of H2AX phosphorylation and also how they cooperate with the chromatin remodelling processes that act at the sites of DNA damage to control the DNA damage response.
