Both the epidermal growth factor receptor signaling pathway and microRNA (miRNA) play an important role in lung cancer development and progression. To address the potential role of miRNA in epidermal growth factor receptor signaling, we identified miR-125a-5p as a downstream target, using an miRNA array. We further demonstrated that miR-125a-5p inhibited migration and invasion of lung cancer cells. Moreover, miR-125a-5p regulated the expression of several downstream genes of epidermal growth factor receptor signaling. Importantly, examination of lung cancer samples revealed a significant correlation of miR-125a-5p repression with lung carcinogenesis. Taken together, our results provide compelling evidence that miR-125a-5p, an epidermal growth factor-signaling-regulated miRNA, may function as a metastatic suppressor.

Lung cancer is the most frequent cause of cancer death in the USA, with a mortality of approximately 85% for all stages, according to population statistics [1]. Furthermore, it is the most common cancer both in incidence rate and in death rate in developing countries such as China [2]. Clinical data have shown that most lung cancer patients eventually suffer relapse and/or metastasis after complete excision of the cancer, even if they were at stage IA [3]. Despite the progress that has been made in recent decades, the mechanism of lung cancer development, including relapse and metastasis, is not fully understood.

Growth factor signal transduction pathways play key roles in various physiological and pathological processes, encompassing metabolism, growth, proliferation, stress, development, and apoptosis. Abnormalities in these signaling pathways lead to various developmental disorders and diseases. In severe cases, aberrant growth factor signaling may even give rise to tumors. Among these pathways, epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signaling appears to be particularly important for epithelial malignancies, including lung cancer [4]. However, despite the clinical importance, the underlying molecular mechanism by which EGFR signaling regulates lung cancer development remains poorly understood.

Recent studies have indicated that microRNAs (miRNAs) are extensively involved in various signaling pathways [5-7]. MicroRNAs are a class of small, noncoding RNAs that play important roles in different biological processes. Interestingly, since Calin et al. first reported that miR-15 and miR-16 are deleted or downregulated in the majority (approximately 68%) of chronic lymphocytic leukemia cases [8], accumulating evidence has implicated miRNA in human cancer [9]. Additionally, altered expression of miRNA has been shown to mediate tumor metastasis [10,11]. However, the relationship between miRNA and EGFR signaling remains largely elusive.

Here, we set out to characterize the regulation of miRNA expression by EGFR activation, using microarray analysis. We further determined that miR-125a-5p could negatively regulate lung cancer cell migration and invasion in vitro, and that this was frequently decreased in lung cancer patients. Our data strongly implicate miR-125a-5p as a potential inhibitor of tumor metastasis.

It has been well established that EGFR signaling plays a crucial role in lung tumorigenesis. Interestingly, accumulating evidence has now implicated miRNA in the formation and malignant progression of human cancer. To examine the potential relationship between EGFR signaling and miRNA, we first performed miRNA expression profiling after epidermal growth factor (EGF) stimulation using the miRHuman_10.0_070802 miRNA array, which contains 711 probes. Through comparison of RNA prepared from a combination of three lung cells, A549, PC9, and H1299, before or after EGF stimulation, our profiling analysis revealed 39 miRNAs with significantly different expression levels (P < 0.01; Table 1). To further determine the requirement for EGFR signaling in the expression of miRNA listed in Table 1, we blocked EGFR signaling with gefitinib. Gefitinib is an inhibitor of tyrosine kinase that competes with ATP for binding to the intracellular kinase domain, preventing receptor activation and the engagement of downstream signaling transducers [12]. Thus, it has been widely used to interfere with EGFR signaling. Consistent with previous observations [13,14], PC9 cells, which express a mutant EGFR and have been extensively explored before, were more sensitive to gefitinib. Thus, a low concentration of gefitinib could abolish the phosphorylation of EGFR, extracellular signal-related kinase (ERK)1/2 and Akt after EGF stimulation. However, H1299 and A549 cells expressed wild-type EGFR, and were less sensitive to gefitinib. Only a high concentration of gefitinib could decrease the phosphorylation of EGFR, ERK1/2, and Akt after EGF stimulation (Fig. 1A). Accordingly, our miRNA array analysis showed that, among the 39 miRNAs listed in Table 1, five miRNAs, inducing let-7i, miR-24, miR-25, miR-29b, and miR-125a-5p, could be reversed by gefitinib (Fig. 1B).

Gefitinib inhibited EGF-induced EGFR, ERK1/2 and Akt phosphorylation and reversed EGF-stimulated miRNA expression in lung cancer cells. (A) Western blot showed that, after EGF (20 ng.mL-1) stimulation, phosphorylation of EGFR, ERK1/2 and Akt occurred in PC9, A549 and H1299 lung cancer cells, and that this could be almost completely abolished by gefitinib at different concentrations. (B) After EGF stimulation, miRNA microarray analysis revealed that the expression of 39 miRNAs was significantly altered (P < 0.01). Among these, five miRNAs, let-7i, miR-24, miR-25, miR-29b, and miR-125a-5p, were further confirmed as EGFR-regulated miRNAs by gefitinib treatment. **P < 0.01 as compared with the serum-starved medium group. (C) Quantitative RT-PCR showed that the mir-125a-5p level was significantly reduced after EGF (20 ng.mL-1) stimulation in all three cell lines, and that this effect was reversed by gefitinib. The value for miR-125a-5p in the EGF group was set at 1, and the relative amounts of miR-125a-5p in the other groups were plotted as fold induction.

We further verified our array results by quantitative PCR, which revealed the expression of miR-24, miR-25, miR-29b and miR-125a-5p to be bona fide targets of EGFR signaling (significantly regulated by EGF treatment and reversed by gefitinib). Among these candidates, miR-125a-5p appeared to be particularly intriguing, because its level was altered most significantly by EGF stimulation (Fig. 1C), and it has been shown that miR-125a regulates the phosphorylation of ERK1/2 and Akt in breast cancer cells [6].

EGFR signaling has been shown to play an important role in cell migration and invasion [15]. Thus, the marked repression of miR-125a-5p after EGFR activation prompted us to investigate whether miR-125a-5p influenced tumor metastasis. We first performed Transwell cell migration assays. PC9 cells were selected as a model system with which to assess the function of miR-125a-5p, because they expressed endogenous miR-125a-5p at a relatively high level before EGF stimulation (Fig. 1C). Our results showed that treatment with antisense miR-125a-5p could significantly increase cell motility (Fig. 2A). To examine their invasion capability, cells transfected with antisense miR-125a-5p or negative control were plated on top of a layer of extracellular matrix (ECM) extracted from mouse sarcoma. Consistent with the migration results, knockdown of miR125a-5p significantly promoted invasion (Fig. 2A). To further determine the function of miR125a-5p in cell migration, we tested the polarized migration of cells by a wound-healing assay. As shown in Fig. 2B, PC9 cells transfected with antisense miR125a-5p healed the scratch wound much faster than the negative control. Representative photographs of migration, invasion and wound-healing are shown in Fig. 2C. Taken together, our data pointed to an important role of miR-125a-5p in regulating cell migration and invasion, suggesting that it might regulate the metastasis of lung cancer.

In addition to regulating migration and invasion, EGFR signaling also influences proliferation, angiogenesis, apoptosis, and cell cycle progression [15]. After finding that miR-125a-5p negatively regulated cell migration and invasion, we went on to determine whether miR-125a-5p had an impact on cell proliferation, angiogenesis, apoptosis, and cell cycle progression. We first examined its potential function in cell proliferation, which contributes heavily to tumor development. A comparison with mock-transfected cells showed that antisense miR-125a-5p significantly enhanced PC9 cell growth (Fig. 3A).

To gain further insights into the role of miR-125a-5p in lung carcinogenesis and to examine the clinical relevance of our findings, we investigated the expression of miR-125a-5p in a panel of lung cancer patient samples together with paired counterpart normal tissues. With the criterion of a 2-DeltaDeltaCt value change of no less than 2 between the malignant and normal groups, we found that 33.33% (5/15) of lung cancer samples showed significantly decreased expression of miR-125a-5p by real-time RT-PCR. Thus, our results suggested that downregulation of miR-125a-5p might contribute, at least partially, to lung cancer development in human patients.

The EGFR signal transduction pathway regulates essential cellular functions, and appears to play a central role in the etiology and progression of numerous epithelial malignancies, including lung cancer [4]. Moreover, the function of EGFR mutations in survival of lung cancer patients and clinical respones to gefitinib has been reported [16,17]. Thus, the identification and characterization of potential factors that regulate EGFR pathways are critical to our understanding of lung cancer development and progression.

Emerging evidence has revealed the profound role of various miRNAs in regulating cancer development. Different miRNAs have been implicated in the formation of neoplasms, malignant progression, and metastasis. To examine the potential miRNA targets of EGFR signaling, we used the miRHuman_10.0_070802 miRNA array, and identified miR-125a-5p as being regulated by EGFR activation. To examine the cellular function of miR-125a-5p, we employed comprehensive in vitro approaches to establish the inhibitory role of miR-125a-5p in cell proliferation, angiogenesis, cell motility, and invasion. It is also of great interest and importance to note that about one-third of the human lung cancer samples that we examined revealed significant downregulation of miR-125a-5p expression. Consistent with our findings, miR-125a-5p has also been reported to be downregulated in breast cancer biopsy specimens [18,19]. Further investigations will be performed to determine whether miR-125a-5p expression is clinically correlated with lung cancer metastasis. Interestingly, the present results, which showed miR-125a-5p negatively regulating cancer cell metastasis, are consistent with our previous work, which suggested that miR-125a-5p is negatively correlated with lung cancer metastasis [11]. Together, the findings presented here strongly suggest that miR-125a-5p may function as a tumor suppressor.

Except for let-7i, miR-24, miR-25, miR-29b, and miR-125a-5p, our miRNA array analysis also indicated another 42 miRNAs with significant differences by comparing miRNA expression before and after gefitinib treatment (P < 0.01; Table S2). Interestingly, among them, some miRNAs, such as miR-16, miR-143, miR-200b, and miR-205, were shown to be involved in human cancer [8,20,21].

In view of our findings here and the results of Scott et al. [6], showing that miR-125a blocked ERK1/2 and Akt signaling in breast cancer cells, we will determine whether miR-125a-5p regulates the phosphorylation of Akt and/or ERK1/2 in lung cancer cells, and whether miR-125a-5p downregulates ErbB2 and ErbB3 in lung cancer cells, because the present work only focused on the functional analysis of miR-125-a-5p.

In conclusion, we identified miR-125a-5p, an EGFR-regulated miRNA, as a potential tumor metastasis suppressor. Our results further substantiated the role of miRNA in tumorigenesis, and revealed the possibility of using miRNAs as potential therapeutic targets to specifically suppress oncogenic signaling pathways that go awry in human cancers.

In both the migration assay and the invasion assay, an initial equilibrium, obtained by adding 0.6 mL of RPMI-1640 with 10% fetal bovine serum to the multiple-well plate, was employed to enhance cell attachment. For the invasion assay, the inserts were coated with extracellular matrix gel from Engelbreth-Holm-Swarm mouse sarcoma (Sigma, Santa Clara, CA, USA). On the following day, 1 x 105 cells suspended in 0.1 mL of fresh medium without fetal bovine serum were added to the insert. Forty-eight hours after seeding, the cells on the upper surface of the membrane were removed using cotton buds. Cell monolayers on the lower surface of the insert were fixed and stained using standard cytological techniques.
