The transforming growth factors (TGF)-beta, TGF-beta1, TGF-beta2 and TGF-beta3, and their receptors [TbetaRI, TbetaRII, TbetaRIII (betaglycan)] elicit pleiotropic functions in the prostate. Although expression of the ligands and receptors have been investigated, the splice variants have never been analyzed. We therefore have analyzed all ligands, the receptors and the splice variants TbetaRIB, TbetaRIIB and TGF-beta2B in human prostatic cells.

Interestingly, a novel human receptor transcript TbetaRIIC was identified, encoding additional 36 amino acids in the extracellular domain, that is expressed in the prostatic cancer cells PC-3, stromal hPCPs, and other human tissues. Furthermore, the receptor variant TbetaRIB with four additional amino acids was identified also in human. Expression of the variant TbetaRIIB was found in all prostate cell lines studied with a preferential localization in epithelial cells in some human prostatic glands. Similarly, we observed localization of TbetaRIIC and TGF-beta2B mainly in the epithelial cells with a preferential localization of TGF-beta2B in the apical cell compartment. Whereas in the androgen-independent hPCPs and PC-3 cells all TGF-beta ligands and receptors are expressed, the androgen-dependent LNCaP cells failed to express all ligands. Additionally, stimulation of PC-3 cells with TGF-beta2 resulted in a significant and strong increase in secretion of plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) with a major participation of TbetaRII.

In general, expression of the splice variants was more heterogeneous in contrast to the well-known isoforms. The identification of the splice variants TbetaRIB and the novel isoform TbetaRIIC in man clearly contributes to the growing complexity of the TGF-beta family.

Transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta is a secreted cytokine implicated in a wide variety of biological processes such as apoptosis, motility, tumorigenesis, proliferation, differentiation, and gene expression [1]. In mammals three TGF-betas, TGF-beta1, TGF-beta2 and TGF-beta3, have been cloned, and although they show very often overlapping functions in vitro, the isoform-specific knockout mice revealed non-redundant and non-overlapping phenotypes. Approximately 50% of the TGF-beta1 knockout mice died during embryogenesis from yolk sac defects; the survivors developed inflammatory disorders and died typically within one month [2-4]. TGF-beta2 knockout mice were perinatally lethal and developed defects in different organs such as heart, kidney, testis, as well as various craniofacial defects and axial and appendicular skeletal defects [5]. Moreover, TGF-beta3 knockout mice were perinatally lethal due to a delayed lung development and defective palatogenesis [6,7].

Secretion and inactivation of the TGF-betas is regulated by the latency-associated peptides (LAPs) which are generated from the respective N-terminal TGF-beta proteins by cleavage [8]. Additionally, latent TGF-beta binding proteins (LTBP1-4) are covalently attached to the LAPs and mediate storage in the extracellular matrix (ECM). After activation by proteolytic enzymes or acidic environment the TGF-betas bind with high affinity to the serine/threonine kinase receptor TbetaRII which in turns phosphorylates TbetaRI. Activation of the receptor complex propagates the signal downstream to the Smad proteins, who regulate many TGF-beta-induced transcriptional responses [9]. Alternatively, TGF-beta2 can bind to the accessory receptor TbetaRIII, who facilitates binding of TGF-beta2 to TbetaRII. However, signal transduction is initiated again by TbetaRI. Recently, it was shown that TGF-beta2 might also bind to an alternative splice product of the TbetaRII gene, mainly expressed in osteoblasts and mesenchymal cells. The receptor isoform TbetaRIIB binds TGF-beta2 also in the absence of TbetaRIII and then activates TbetaRI starting the signal transduction [10]. However, recently it was shown in human chondrocytes that TbetaRIIB exerted a higher affinity for TGF-beta1 than for TGF-beta2 [11]. In addition to alternative splicing of TbetaRII, TGF-beta2 and TbetaRI also were demonstrated to be alternatively spliced in human prostatic PC-3 cells [12] and embryonic stem cells from mouse [13], respectively.

TGF-betas are believed to be involved in several aspects of carcinogenesis. At the beginning of tumor formation the TGF-betas might inhibit proliferation of cancer cells, but with ongoing dedifferentiation, the TGF-betas and the receptors seem to enhance motility and metastasis of the tumor cells [1,14]. In more advanced and especially metastasised stages higher serum levels of TGF-beta1 were found [15] and reduced expression of TbetaRII and TbetaRI in the tumor tissue was associated with poor prognosis [16].

Recently, analyses of alternative splicing indicated that approximately 40-60% of human genes express splice variants, suggesting that alternative splicing contributes to the growing complexity of the human genome [17]. In many transcripts, addition or deletion of complete exons or introduction of an early stop codon may result in a truncated or unstable mRNA [18]. Alternative splicing has been shown to be involved in ligand binding to growth factor receptors like TbetaRIIB [10], cell adhesion or various human diseases [19]. Additionally, alternative splicing occurs sometimes during developmental processes and may be restricted to distinct tissues [18]. Interestingly, it was reported that more alternative splicing was found in organs such as testis, pancreas, placenta, and liver [20]. Up to date many groups have presented genomic analyses of alternative splicing by use of expressed sequence tags (EST, [e.g. [21-23]] or microarrays [20]. Most of these results are now available in databases [17].

In this study, we have analyzed the mRNA expression of the TGF-betas and the receptors TbetaRI-III mainly in human prostatic cells available to us and identified the splice variants TGF-beta2B, TbetaRIB, TbetaRIIB and the new variant TbetaRIIC. Of note, the alternatively spliced exons were found in the N-terminal part of the proteins and extracellular domains of the receptors. The splice variant TGF-beta2B could be identified in more species than the other isoforms and showed less sequence variation among the various species. Furthermore, this is the first report showing localization of the splice variants TbetaRIIB, TbetaRIIC and TGF-beta2B in human prostate tissue.

The search in the literature (PubMed) and sequence databases for TGF-betas and their high-affinity receptors displayed deleted or additional exons. Alternative splicing of the TGF-beta ligands was described for TGF-beta1 in pig [24] and for TGF-beta2 in human and rat [12,25]. Alternative splicing of the high-affinity receptors was demonstrated for TbetaRI in mouse, rat and boar [13,26,27], and for TbetaRII in mouse and human [28-30].

Alignment of the human ESTs with the genomic sequence of the TbetaRI revealed several irregular ESTs but none of them with additional exons. We also identified a pseudogene of the TbetaRI gene on chromosome 19 reaching from exon 2 to exon 4 and a short stretch of 62 base pairs (bp) from the 3'-UTR (Fig. 1A). The pseudogene showed 87 sequence aberrations in 550 bp (16%) compared to the TbetaRI cDNA.

A 12 bp extension of the third exon of the TbetaRI was first found in mouse and rat [13,26] and recently in boars [27], but not in human. Therefore, we cloned both variants of TbetaRI, with and without the 12 bp extension (Acc. Nos.  and , respectively) from the human stromal cells hPCPs [33] (Figs. 1A,B). mRNA expression of TbetaRI and TbetaRIB was found in the stromal hPCPs cells and epithelial LNCaP cells, whereas PC-3 cells only expressed TbetaRI and not TbetaRIB (Fig. 1B). Because the splice variant TbetaRIB was only weakly expressed, we obtained improved PCR results by using a primer containing the 12 bp extension (Fig. 1B, Table 1). The additional exon 3B codes for 4 amino acids in the extracellular domain of the receptor and is also found in dogs and pigs (Fig. 1C). Up to date, the sequence of TbetaRI is not available for Canis familiaris (Fig. 1C). According to the exon classification [34] exon 3B with the 12 bp extension belongs to the exon-type with internal acceptor sites.

An alternatively spliced exon between the first two exons of the TbetaRII gene was described for mouse and human [28-30] (Fig. 2A-C). The cassette type exon 2B consists of 75 bp and codes for 25 amino acids. Due to admission of exon 2B amino acid exchange occurs at the splice site junction between both receptor variants, from isoleucine to valine in human and from phenylalanine to valine in the mouse sequence (Fig. 2B,C). Exon 2B shows 14 nucleotide exchanges between the human and mouse sequence coding for 7 different amino acids. In contrast the nucleotide and amino acid sequence from Pan troglodytes is 100% identical to human, whereas the nucleotide sequence from Macaca mulatta demonstrated two different nucleotides, thus resulting in one amino acid exchange.

The alignment of the ESTs with the genomic sequence revealed the novel transcript TbetaRIIC (Acc. No. ) with the alternatively spliced exon 4B comprising 108 nucleotides arranged in frame and encoding 36 amino acids (Fig. 3). Exon 4B belongs to the cassette type of exons and is part of the extracellular domain of the receptor (Fig. 2A). The nucleotide and amino acid sequence from Pan troglodytes demonstrated one different nucleotide thus resulting in one different amino acid, whereas the nucleotide sequence from Macaca mulatta demonstrated 7 different nucleotides, thus resulting in 5 amino acid exchanges compared with the human sequence (Fig. 3).

The alternatively spliced exon 2B was found in the human EST database (e.g. BG898778, Fig. 4A). We also analyzed the truncated TbetaRII sequence provided by Yang et al. [35] and found that it was identical to exon 1 and exon 2 and some nucleotides in the 3'-UTR, thus resulting in a truncated receptor isoform as published (Fig. 4A). Additionally, only one EST for TbetaRIIC could be identified (Fig. 4A). Expression of TbetaRII and TbetaRIIB was apparent in the prostate cells hPCPs, PC-3 and LNCaP (Fig. 4B). In contrast to the weak expression of TbetaRIB compared to TbetaRI, the long variant TbetaRIIB is as strongly expressed as TbetaRII. Because TbetaRIIC was very weakly expressed in the prostatic cell lines and the EST BG955255 was derived from colon tissue, we also analyzed the colon cancer cells Caco-2. With nested RT-PCR, mRNA expression could be detected in Caco-1, PC-3 and hPCPs, but only very weakly in LNCaP cells (Fig. 4B). Despite the low expression, we found mRNA expression in up to 20 normal tissues (Fig. 4B). Furthermore, we identified an aberrant splicing pattern at the 5'-end of the alternative exon of TbetaRIIC, where an alternative AG was used for splicing (Fig. 4C), resulting in a preliminary stop codon (Fig. 3). Although expression of TbetaRIICDelta4 was low compared to TbetaRIIC (Fig. 4C), it was apparent in all cell lines and tissues studied.

The alignment of the TGF-beta1 gene with the ESTs did not show any new exons. Because in the TGF-beta2 gene the alternatively spliced exon 2B between the first two exons was found as mentioned above, we tested whether this was also the case for the TGF-beta1 cDNA. However, in the prostatic cells no additional exon was identified (data not shown). Besides LNCaP all cell lines studied showed expression of TGF-beta1 (Fig. 5B). Additionally, we tested whether exons 4 and 5 were deleted in the human sequence as has been published for the porcine sequence [24]. However, in the prostatic cell lines studied this deletion was not detectable (Fig. 5B).

For the TGF-beta2 gene an additional cassette type exon between exons 1 and 2 was published for man and rat [12,25] and is now also available for monkeys, dogs, rabbits and mice (Fig. 6). The coding sequence is 84 bp in all species, resulting in additional 28 amino acids with a change from asparagine to aspartic acid in TGF-beta2B at the splice site (Fig. 6). Nucleotide and amino acid sequences of TGF-beta2B of the different species are more closely related to the human sequence than these of TbetaRIIC or TbetaRIIB. For example, the nucleotide and amino acid sequence of TGF-beta2B from Pan troglodytes and Macaca mulatta is 100% identical to the human sequence (Fig. 6), whereas the nucleotide sequence of TbetaRIIC from Pan troglodytes and Macaca mulatta is only 99.1% and 93.5%, respectively, identical to the human sequence (Fig. 3).

The alignment of the TGF-beta3 cDNA sequence with the EST database only yielded incorrectly spliced exons (Fig. 7C). We found an annotation for alternative splicing of TGF-beta3 in the ASDB database [22]. Although the TGF-beta3 gene could be found in this genomic clone, the alternative splicing does belong to the next gene, adjacent to TGF-beta3. mRNA expression of TGF-beta3 was investigated with primers located in exon 1 and exon 2 to test for possible new exons. However, we only observed one specific amplicon in all prostatic cell lines except for LNCaP cells (Fig. 7D). Expression of the housekeeping gene glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) for all cell lines used is shown in Fig. 7D.

We used a sensitive ELISA to determine the amounts of plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) in the supernatant of PC-3 cells which are known to secrete PAI-1 [36]. Stimulation of PC-3 cells with 10 ng/ml recombinant TGF-beta2 demonstrated a highly significant approximately 10-fold increase in PAI-1 secretion compared to the unstimulated control (Fig. 9). Antibody perturbation experiments performed with three different antibodies against TbetaRII, TbetaRIIB and TbetaRIIC showed a significant reduction (approximately 30%) in secretion of PAI-1 only for the anti-TbetaRII antibodies compared to the stimulation with TGF-beta2 (Fig. 9). Although antibodies against TbetaRIIB and TbetaRIIC demonstrated a reduction of 14% and 21%, respectively, in PAI-1 secretion, the effects were not significant.

Secretion of PAI-1 by PC-3 cells was quantified by ELISAs. TGF-beta2 alone (-) stimulated secretion of PAI-1 significantly compared to the control (Ctrl). Antibody perturbation experiments with antibodies specific for the extracellular domains of TbetaRII (RII), the alternative exons of TbetaRIIB (RIIB) and TbetaRIIC (RIIC), demonstrated a significant decrease in the amount of PAI-1 only for TbetaRII compared to the stimulation with TGF-beta2 (-) or the unspecific antibody (ctrl-R). For the sake of clarity, we have not indicated that the antibody perturbation experiments were also significantly different to the control (Ctrl) without any TGF-beta2 treatment. An unspecific antibody (ctrl-R) did not inhibit PAI-1 secretion stimulated by TGF-beta2. Each experiment was independently repeated five times (n = 5) in duplicate, with each value given as the mean +/- SEM. Statistically significant differences are indicated (*, P < 0.05; ***, P < 0.001).

We have analyzed the mRNA expression of the TGF-betas and their respective high-affinity receptors in human prostatic cells available to us and identified alternative splicing in TbetaRI, TbetaRII and TGF-beta2 (Table 2). It is striking that the alternatively spliced exons are located in the N-terminal part of the proteins, whereby in both receptors the additional amino acids were part of the extracellular domain. Also, the novel isoform TbetaRIIC is characterized by 36 additional amino acids in the extracellular domain. Up to date, the variant TGF-beta2B is sequenced in more species and showed less sequence variations than TbetaRIIB and TbetaRIIC. Additionally, we demonstrated that the splice variants are translated and found a preferential epithelial localization in the human prostate. For the first time we could show that stimulation of PC-3 cells with TGF-beta2 resulted in a significant and strong increase in secretion of PAI-1 with a major participation of TbetaRII and to a lesser extent that of TbetaRIIB and TbetaRIIC.

Analysis of mRNA expression of TGF-betas and their receptors in human prostatic cell lines showed very controversial results. It is generally accepted that PC-3 cells express TGF-beta1, TGF-beta2 and TGF-beta3 [37,38] and even more the TGF-beta2 gene was originally cloned from PC-3 cells [12]. In line with this, our study also showed expression of all TGF-beta ligands in the stromal hPCPs and PC-3. However, experiments with LNCaP yielded controversial results. Whereas mRNA expression for TGF-beta1 to TGF-beta3 was demonstrated [37] all other studies including this one could not find mRNA expression of TGF-beta1 in LNCaP cells [39,40]. Our study showed expression of all TGF-beta ligands in the stromal cells hPCPs which is in accordance with the results for other stromal cell lines derived from the human prostate [41]. However, this study confirmed an earlier report showing that PC-3 cells express the splice variant TGF-beta2B [12].

PC-3 cells showed expression of TbetaRI and TbetaRII, which was confirmed in this study. In LNCaP cells expression of TbetaRII was found, but TbetaRI was not expressed [42,43]. However, another study [44] like the present detected mRNA expression by RT-PCR in LNCaP cells. For stromal prostatic cells expression of TbetaRI and TbetaRII was found by us and others [45]. This is the first study to show expression of TbetaRIII and the receptor splice variants TbetaRIB and TbetaRIIB and to identify a novel transcript termed TbetaRIIC which will be discussed below. Only the stromal cells hPCPs expressed all receptor splice variants as well as TGF-beta2B (Table 2). Except for the splice variant TbetaRIB, PC-3 cells also expressed all receptor splice variants, whereas LNCaP cells did not express TGF-beta2B which is in line with the missing expression of all TGF-beta ligands. Interestingly, these cells did also not express the newly identified splice variant TbetaRIIC (Table 2).

Agrotis et al. [30] have demonstrated, that TbetaRI is more abundant in contractile smooth muscle cells than the variant TbetaRIB. Additionally, they found that TbetaRI displayed a greater ability to induce PAI-1 mRNA in response to TGF-beta1, whereas TbetaRIB performed slightly better in growth inhibition [30]. Interestingly, we identified for TbetaRI a pseudogene on chromosome 19, reaching from exon 2 to exon 4 and a short stretch of 62 bp from the 3'-UTR of the gene.

In contrast to TbetaRI which mainly is important for signal transduction, TbetaRII is involved in direct interaction with the ligands TGF-beta1, TGF-beta2 and TGF-beta3 [1]. In TbetaRII the additional exon 2B was hypothesized to be involved in high-affinity binding of TGF-beta2 to the receptor isoform TbetaRIIB also in the absence of TbetaRIII [10]. However, it was shown recently that TGF-beta2 could bind to soluble TbetaRIIB or TbetaRII only in combination with soluble TbetaRI [46] and that also TGF-beta1 could interact with TbetaRIIB [11]. Furthermore, the TbetaR knockouts, TbetaRI [47], TbetaRII [48] and TbetaRIII [49], revealed non-overlapping phenotypes with the TGF-beta2 null mice [5], although TbetaRIII knockouts displayed reduced TGF-beta2 binding [49]. This implies that either the high-affinity receptor for TGF-beta2 is still not found or that receptor combinations might be responsible for the interaction.

Expression of TbetaRII was found in the human prostate in normal and tumor tissue primarily in the epithelial cells with a diminished expression in more advanced stages [16]. Similarily our results with TbetaRIIB also showed a distinct localization in the epithelial cells of normal and tumor tissue of the human prostate.

Our analysis clearly showed the expression of a novel transcript variant TbetaRIIC in PC-3, hPCPs cells, Caco-2 and up to 20 normal tissues including human prostate, indicating a ubiquitous expression in human organs. The additional and alternatively spliced exon encodes 36 amino acids located in the extracellular domain in close proximity to the transmembrane domain. Although the database search for protein domains revealed no similarities to other proteins or specific motifs, it is noteworthy, that the additional domain contains two additional cysteines which might be important for protein folding. Interestingly, we found a deletion of 4 bp at the 5'-end of the additional exon 4B in TbetaRIICDelta4, possibly resulting in a truncated receptor. Although expressed at a very low level, it was found in normal tissue and preliminary results suggest this to be also the case in tumor samples. Interestingly protein localization of TbetaRIIC was also found mainly in the epithelial cells of the human prostate but in very few glands.

The splice variant TGF-beta2B mRNA was first described in the prostatic cell line PC-3 [12,50] and in rats in skeletal muscles, aorta, primary bronchus, heart, uterus, sciatic nerve, and spinal cord [25]. Additionally, TGF-beta2B mRNA and protein were found in most somatic and germinal cells of mouse and rat [51]. TGF-beta2B was also demonstrated to be secreted by BSC-40 cells from monkeys [52]. The additional exon of TGF-beta2B is part of the LAP-domain which is important for correct secretion and inactivation of the mature C-terminal TGF-beta2 dimer [8]. The alternatively spliced exon 2B contains 3 additional cysteine residues which might be important for the formation of cysteine bonds and therefore might influence protein folding. However, TGF-beta2B is secreted and forms a latent complex with the LAP [52]. It is important to note that TGF-beta2B is cleaved similarly to TGF-beta2 and yields a mature monomer/dimer of exactly the same size as mature TGF-beta2 [52]. Because only mature TGF-beta2 binds to the receptor it is equal whether mature TGF-beta2 is cleaved from the short TGF-beta2 variant or long TGF-beta2B variant. Whether the existence of the two different TGF-beta2 LAP complexes is required for different binding to LTBPs and thus might be stored differently in the ECM warrants further investigation.

Up to date TGF-beta2B was identified in most species, whereas TbetaRIB and TbetaRIIB were found in fewer species. It is noteworthy that TbetaRIIB is not as well conserved between human and mouse than TGF-beta2B and up to date was not found in rat [51]. Therefore, we conclude that TbetaRIIB is not as ubiquitously expressed in the different species like the other variants and therefore could not serve as a ubiquitous receptor for TGF-beta2. In line with this assumption, we could observe only a moderate decrease in PAI-1 secretion after inhibition of TbetaRIIB or TbetaRIIC after stimulation of PC-3 cells with TGF-beta2. However, this is the first report showing a 10-fold increase of PAI-1 secretion in PC-3 cells after stimulation with TGF-beta2.

In general, mRNA expression of the TGF-beta and TbetaR splice variants was more heterogeneous and weaker compared to the variants without the alternative exons. The variant TGF-beta2B was identified in most species and is up to date the best conserved isoform among the various species. Similarly, the splice variant TbetaRIB was also found in many species in contrast to the isoforms TbetaRIIB and TbetaRIIC which showed a more restricted species distribution. This is the first report showing a distinct localization of TGF-beta2B, TbetaRIIB and TbetaRIIC in the human prostate mainly in the epithelium.

Total RNA from the cell lines was isolated with Trizol (Gibco BRL, Karlsruhe, Germany) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Total RNA of Caco-2 cells was isolated using RNAeasy isolation kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) according to manufacturer's protocol. Reverse transcription was performed using 2 mug of total RNA and Omniscript (Qiagen), except for total RNA from Caco-2, which was reverse transcribed as described elsewhere [54]. Primers used for PCR are denoted in Table 1 and were intron-spanning to overcome genomic contamination. PCR was performed on a Hybaid Omnigene Thermocycler (MWG Biotech, Ebersberg, Germany) using mainly PanScript Taq polymerase (Pansystems, Aidenbach, Germany) as described [55]. Amplification with the primers 5-TGFB3E1/3-TGFB3E2 was performed with the Platinum Taq Polymerase (Invitrogen, Karlsruhe, Germany) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The first round of the nested PCR to clone TbetaRIIC was done with the primers 5-HTBR2E3/3-HTBR2E4 from which 20 mul were used for the second round with the primers 5-HTBR2Z/3-HTBR2E4. The other fragment of Tbeta RIIC was also cloned after a nested PCR with the primers 5-HTBR2B/3-HTBR2CD in the first round and primers 5-HTBR2E3/3-HTBR2CD were used for the second round. The nested PCR was performed with the Qiagen Taq DNA Polymerase and solution Q (Qiagen) on a PTC100 cycler (Biozym, Germany). Amplification was carried out for 35 cycles, except for 5-GAPDH/3-GAPDH which was run for 25 cycles and 5-HTBR2E3/HTBR2CD which was run for 30 cycles. After an initial heating to 94degreesC for 4 min, each cycle consisted of denaturing at 94degreesC for 45 sec, annealing at the temperatures indicated in Table 1 for 45 sec and elongation at 72degreesC for 90 sec except for the last extension which lasted 5 min. PCR products were separated on agarose gels, extracted with Qiaex (Qiagen), subcloned into the pCR2.0 vector (Invitrogen) and subsequently sequenced by MWG Biotech and GENterprise (Mainz, Germany). Amplification with the Cy-5 labeled primer 5-HTBR2E3 with the primer 3-HTBR2CD to detect TbetaRIICDelta4 was performed as described [56], except that cDNA instead of genomic DNA was used. PCR fragments were separated on 8% polyacrylamide gels [56].

The exon and intron pattern of the TGF-betas and their receptors was either found in the NCBI sequence database or determined by sequence comparison of the cDNAs with the genomic sequences by using the Blast tool. Each exon of the respective cDNAs was aligned with all available ESTs from human. Then, every EST was aligned with the genomic sequences to find alternatively/incorrectly spliced exons, which were analyzed for standard splice sites (GT-AG at the 5'- and 3'-end, respectively) and for a continuous open reading frame. Only good candidates which fulfilled both criteria were further analyzed by RT-PCR.

These peptide sequences are highly homologous in most species and did not show any homology to other proteins. Polyclonal antibodies were also affinity-purified on a sepharose column. Specificity of the antibodies was tested in ELISAs (CovAbtest, Coring) and western blots. Negative controls were performed with the preimmune serum and showed no binding.

Quantitation of PAI-1 was performed with the highly sensitive PAI-1 Antigen ELISA Kit (Technoclone, Vienna, Austria), according to the manufacturer's instructions. PC-3 cells (50,000 cells/well) were seeded on 24-well plates and grown in DMEM (+10% FCS and antibiotics) at 37degreesC and 5% CO2 for 24 h. Then, medium was changed to DMEM containing the antibodies against TbetaRII (diluted 1:12.5, AF-241-NA, R&D Systems), TbetaRIIB (diluted 1:12.5, AF1300, R&D Systems), and TbetaRIIC (diluted 1:12.5). Control incubations were performed (i) without antibody, and (ii) by replacement of the antibodies by anti-goat IgG (1:12.5; Invitrogen, Karlsruhe, Germany). After incubation at 37degreesC and 5% CO2 for 1 h, TGF-beta2 (10 ng/ml) was added. The cells were grown at 37degreesC for 72 h and collected supernatants were stored with protease-inhibitors (Complete Mini, Roche, Mannheim, Germany) at -20degreesC until the PAI-1 ELISA was performed.

All experiments were repeated independently at least three times in duplicate. Values from all experiments were used for calculation of the means and their respective standard errors of the mean (SEM). Statistical tests of one way analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by the non-parametric test of Kruskal Wallis were used to determine significant differences between different experimental groups and the controls by using GraphPad Instat 3 (GraphPad, San Diego, USA). P values less than 0.05 were considered statistically significant.
