A transcript has been localized proximal to the dopa decarboxylase (Ddc) gene within a cluster of genes involved in cuticle formation and catecholamine metabolism in Drosophila. This gene, which has been identified as I(2)37Cc, maps 2.0kb from the 5' end of the Ddc gene and is transcribed in the same direction as Ddc. We describe a new deficiency which in conjunction with previous deficiencies localizes the I(2)37Cb and I(2)37Cc loci to the cytogenetic interval 5' to Ddc. We present the sequence of the Cc gene and corresponding cDNA. The Cc message contains several open reading frames 5' to the large open reading frame responsible for the lethal complementation group, suggesting that expression of Cc function may be regulated translationally. The Cc transcript is expressed in early embryos, late embryos, late third instar larvae and adults. We discuss the implications of these findings with respect to the gene organization in the region.
