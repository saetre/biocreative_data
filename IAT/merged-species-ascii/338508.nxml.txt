The Philadelphia (Ph') translocation involves rearrangement of the bcr gene located on chromosome 22. Hybridization experiments revealed the presence of multiple bcr gene-related loci within the human genome. Two of these were molecularly cloned and characterized. Both loci contain exons and introns corresponding to the 3' region of the bcr gene. Restriction enzyme and DNA sequence analysis indicate a very high degree of conservation between bcr and the two related genomic sequences. Both bcr-related loci are located on chromosome 22, one centromeric, the other telomeric, of the bcr gene. Within the two bcr related genomic sequences, fragments or the complete coding sequences of an unrelated gene were found to be present. This gene was identified; it encodes gamma-glutamyl transferase, an enzyme involved in the glutathione metabolism.
