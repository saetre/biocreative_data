A cDNA encoding a nuclear-encoded chloroplast nucleic acid-binding protein (NBP) has been isolated from maize. Identified as an in vitro DNA-binding activity, NBP belongs to a family of nuclear-encoded chloroplast proteins which share a common domain structure and are thought to be involved in posttranscriptional regulation of chloroplast gene expression. NBP contains an N-terminal chloroplast transit peptide, a highly acidic domain and a pair of ribonucleoprotein consensus sequence domains. NBP is expressed in a light-dependent, organ-specific manner which is consistent with its involvement in chloroplast biogenesis. The relationship of NBP to the other members of this protein family and their possible regulatory functions are discussed.
