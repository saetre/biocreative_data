DNA polymerase (pol) lambda is homologous to pol beta and has intrinsic polymerase and terminal transferase activities. However, nothing is known about the amino acid residues involved in these activites. In order to precisely define the nucleotide-binding site of human pol lambda, we have mutagenised two amino acids, Tyr505 and the neighbouring Phe506, which were predicted by structural homology modelling to correspond to the Tyr271 and Phe272 residues of pol beta, which are involved in nucleotide binding. Our analysis demonstrated that pol lambda Phe506Arg/Gly mutants possess very low polymerase and terminal transferase activities as well as greatly reduced abilities for processive DNA synthesis and for carrying on translesion synthesis past an abasic site. The Tyr505Ala mutant, on the other hand, showed an altered nucleotide binding selectivity to perform the terminal transferase activity. Our results suggest the existence of a common nucleotide-binding site for the polymerase and terminal transferase activities of pol lambda, as well as distinct roles of the amino acids Tyr505 and Phe506 in these two catalytic functions.

DNA polymerase (pol) lambda is a nuclear enzyme that has been assigned, based on sequence homology, to the family X polymerases, comprising pol beta, pol micro and terminal transferase (TdT) (1). The gene encoding the novel pol lambda was cloned and mapped to mouse chromosome 19 and to human chromosome 10. Furthermore, isolation of endogenous pol lambda from calf thymus has been described (2). Pol lambda has 32% amino acid identity to pol beta and contains all four pol beta structural subdomains, named fingers, palm, thumb and the 8 kDa 5'-deoxyribose phosphate lyase (dRP lyase) domain. How ever, the high homology of pol lambda with pol beta is exclusively confined to the C-terminal half of the protein (amino acids 244-575) containing the catalytic site. Pol lambda contains an intrinsic dRP lyase activity and can substitute for pol beta in in vitro base excision repair (3). Both the human and the calf thymus enzymes were able to synthesise DNA on a template containing abasic (AP) sites with the same efficiency as on undamaged DNA, thus suggesting a potential role of pol lambda in translesion synthesis (2,4). Moreover, it has recently been demonstrated that human pol lambda interacts functionally and physically with proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA). This interaction stabilises the binding of pol lambda to the primer template, thus increasing its affinity for the hydroxyl primer and its processivity in DNA synthesis, without affecting the nucleotide incorporation rate. PCNA also stimulated efficient synthesis by pol lambda across an AP site leading to elongation past the lesion (4).

Beside pol beta and pol lambda, other members of polymerase family X are TdT and pol micro (5). Interestingly, whereas pol beta does not possess terminal transferase activity, both pol lambda and pol micro are able to add nucleotides to the 3'-end of a single-stranded (ss)DNA (6,7). These different properties of pol beta and pol lambda might reflect a different architecture of the active site. Sequence alignments of the members of the polymerase X family showed two long motifs of conserved residues, which have been shown to constitute the dNTP-binding site in the crystal structures of pol beta and TdT (8-13). The first motif is LYFTGS in human pol beta (amino acids 271-275) and human pol lambda (amino acids 504-509) and LGWTGS (amino acids 447-452) in human TdT. Essential roles in dNTP binding and catalysis have been shown for the pol beta residues Y271 and F272 (12,14,15). These residues correspond to Y505 and F506 of human pol lambda and to G449 and W450 of human TdT. Additional important amino acids involved in nucleotide binding by pol beta are R254 and R258 (8), the latter being adjacent to the F272 side chain in the crystal structure of pol beta complexed with its substrates. Interestingly, homology modelling revealed that the putative nucleotide-binding pocket of pol lambda has a more hydrophobic character with respect to that of pol beta, since the pol beta residue R258 is replaced in pol lambda by the moderately hydrophobic residue I492, which lies close to F506.

Since it is not known whether the same residues of pol lambda are responsible for both the template-dependent (i.e. DNA polymerase) and template-independent (i.e. terminal transferase) activities, we have generated three pol lambda mutants: Y505A, F506G and F506R. While the first two (Y505A and F506G) allowed us to test the effects of the lack of the corresponding aromatic side chains, the F506R mutant was generated to test the effect, if any, of replacement of the Phe ring with a positively charged chain within the hydrophobic nucleotide-binding pocket of pol lambda. We have analysed the effects of these mutations on both the DNA polymerisation and terminal transferase activities of pol lambda. Our data suggest a common nucleotide-binding site for both the DNA polymerase and terminal transferase functions of pol lambda and that the Y505A and F506G/R mutations affect these two activities differently.

Restric tion sites used for further cloning are in italic and changed codons are in bold. PCR products were double digested with the appropriate enzymes, agarose gel purified and ligated into plasmid pRSETb (BamHI and EcoRI cloning sites). Pfu DNA polymerase used for PCR was from Promega. Sequencing of Y505A, F506G and F506R pol lambda mutants was performed with a BigDye Terminator cycle sequencing kit (Perkin-Elmer) and analysed in an ABI 310 automated sequencer. Recombinant human wild-type (wt) pol lambda and the Y505A, F506G and F506R pol lambda mutants were expressed and purified as described (7). After purification, the proteins were >90% homogeneous, as judged by SDS-PAGE and Comassie staining, and had specific activities of 200 000 U/mg for pol lambda wt, 80 000 U/mg for the Y505A pol lambda mutant, 10 700 U/mg for the F506G pol lambda mutant and 11 000 U/mg for the F506R pol lambda mutant. One unit of polymerase activity corresponds to the incorporation of 1 pmol total dTMP into acid-precipitable material in 60 min at 37degreesC in a standard assay containing 0.5 microg (as nucleotides) of poly(dA).oligo(dT)10:1 and 10 microM dTTP. Recombinant human PCNA was isolated as described (4).

For kinetic analysis, enzymatic activity was measured in the presence of 25 nM pol lambda wt and Y505A and 75 nM pol lambda F506G and F506R and increasing concentrations of DNA or nucleotide substrate. For dTTP incorporation, concentrations tested were 0.1, 0.2, 0.75, 1.25, 5, 10 and 25 microM. For DNA substrate utilisation, poly(dA).oligo(dT) concentrations used (as 3'-OH ends) were 10, 20, 40, 80 and 200 nM. Enzymatic activity was measured at the 16 min time point, which corresponded to the mid-point of the linear phase of the reaction, as determined by time-dependent incorporation experiments. The Km and Vmax values were calculated by plotting the initial velocity dependence on substrate concentration and fitting the data to the Michaelis-Menten equation in the form:

Human pol lambda, either wild-type or the Y505A, F506G or F506R mutant, was titrated in DNA polymerase assays with a 5'-end-labelled 17:73 primer/template DNA oligonucleotide substrate. All the reactions were performed in the presence of Mn2+, which has been shown to be the optimal divalent cation for pol lambda (21), and the products were resolved by sequencing gel analysis. As shown in Figure 1A, both the F506 pol lambda mutants (lanes 1-6) displayed a strongly reduced activity compared to the wild-type (lanes 10-12). On the other hand, the pol lambda Y505A mutant (lanes 7-9) showed only a moderate reduction in catalytic activity at low enzyme concentrations (compare lanes 8 and 9 to lanes 11 and 12), but nearly identical activity at high concentrations (compare lane 7 with lane 10). These results indicated a highly distributive mode of synthesis by pol lambda, as already reported (4). Both the pol lambda wt and the Y505A mutant showed a strong stop site around positions +42 to +45 (giving a product of approximately59-62 nt, indicated by the arrow), corresponding to a G-rich sequence. The kinetic parameters for nucleotide incorporation and DNA binding were determined for the four enzymes as described in Materials and Methods, and are summarised in Table 1. The pol lambda F506R and F506G mutants showed a 50- to 100-fold decrease in the apparent kcat value with respect to the wild-type. Interestingly, the F506G mutant had nearly 30-fold lower Km values for both the nucleotide and the DNA substrates with respect to the wild-type enzyme, resulting in similar efficiencies of substrate utilisation (kcat/Km values). On the other hand, the F506R substitution did not have any significant effect on the apparent Km value for the nucleotide substrate with respect to pol lambda wt, but showed a 27-fold decrease in the Km value for the 3'-OH primer end with respect to the wild-type enzyme. As a result, the F506R mutant displayed a 77-fold reduction in nucleotide utilisation efficiency (kcat/Km values), whereas the efficiency of DNA substrate utilisation was reduced only 4-fold. The pol lambda Y505A mutant, on the other hand, showed only a 3-fold reduction in its apparent kcat value, with nucleotide and DNA substrate utilisation efficiencies nearly identical to pol lambda wt.

Human pol lambda has been shown to interact with PCNA, which stimulates its processivity (4). In order to test the responsiveness of the mutant enzymes to PCNA, pol lambda wt and the Y505A, F506G and F506R mutants were tested in the absence or presence of increasing concentrations of human PCNA, under distributive conditions. As shown in Figure 1B, PCNA stimulated synthesis by pol lambda wt and the Y505A mutant in a very similar manner (compare lanes 1-5 with lanes 6-10). On the other hand, the pol lambda F506G and F506R mutants were severly impaired in their polymerase activity compared to the wild-type, synthesising products of 10-15 nt in both the absence and presence of PCNA (compare lane 15 with lanes 11-14 and lane 20 with lanes 16-19). Due to the experimental conditions used, the products shown in Figure 1B were synthesised in distributive mode (i.e. with multiple primer turnover by the enzyme). In order to more precisely assess the impact of PCNA on processivity of the enzyme, we tested the four different pol lambda (wt, Y505A, F506G and F506R) under processive (i.e. single primer turnover) conditions.

The approach used consisted of measuring DNA synthesis on a 5'-end-labelled synthetic 18:73mer primer/template DNA oligonucleotide substrate, in the absence or presence of an excess of unlabelled poly(dA).oligo(dT) trapping substrate. When challenged with the trapping DNA, all the polymerase molecules that dissociated from the oligonucleotide substrate should be sequestered by the cold poly(dA).oligo(dT). Thus, the number of nucleotides incorporated in the presence of the trap should be equal to the processivity of the enzyme, defined as the number of incorporation events for a single DNA binding event. The effectiveness of this method has been proven previously with pol lambda wt (4). The results of this experiment are shown in Figure 2A. In the absence of the trapping agent, pol lambda wt (lane 1) and the pol lambda Y505A mutant (lane 3) were able to synthesise full-length products, whereas the pol lambda F506R and F506G mutants (lanes 5 and 7, respectively) stopped after approximately10-11 incorporation events. In the presence of the trap, pol lambda wt and the pol lambda Y505A mutant again showed comparable processivity of approximately10 nt (compare lane 2 with lane 4). On the other hand, the pol lambda F506R mutant showed a processivity of 1-2 nt (lane 6) and the F506G of 3-4 nt only (lane 8). We next tested the effect of PCNA on the processivity of pol lambda wt and the F506G mutant only. As shown in Figure 2B, processivity of the F506G mutant could not be stimulated by increasing amounts of PCNA (compare lane 2 with lanes 3-6), whereas stimulation was observed with the wild-type enzyme (compare lane 8 with lanes 9-11). Since PCNA has been shown to increase the stability of the enzyme:primer complex, without affecting its rate of nucleotide incorporation, these results suggest that the main defect induced by the F506G mutation was a reduction of the catalytic rate.

Pol lambda has been shown to be able to synthesise DNA across an AP site lesion on the template strand (2,4). Pol lambda wt and the Y505A and F506G mutants were titrated under standing start conditions, using a 18/73mer primer/template DNA oligonucleotide substrate. The 18mer primer was annealed to nucleotides 26-44 of the 73mer template, thus leaving a single-stranded 5'-tail of 25 nt available for synthesis (see Materials and Methods for details). The 73mer oligonucleotide contained a single synthetic AP site (tetrahydrofuran moiety) in place of the G at position 25. Thus, upon annealing of the 18mer primer, an abasic site resulted at position +1 of the template. As shown in Figure 3A, in the presence of all four dNTPs pol lambda wt (lanes 1-3) and the Y505A mutant (lanes 4-6) were able to synthesise a full-length product starting from the lesion. On the other hand, the F506G mutant aborted DNA synthesis after incorporation of one nucleotide (lanes 7-9), corresponding to the position of the AP site. These results suggested that the F506G mutant, albeit able to incorporate one nucleotide in front of the lesion, was severly impaired in its ability to elongate the resulting primer end. Next, pol lambda wt and the F506G mutant were tested on the same 18/73mer substrate with the lesion, in the presence of increasing concentrations of all four dNTPs. As shown in Figure 3B, while the wild-type enzyme was able to catalyse both incorporation in front of the lesion and subsequent elongation (lanes 2-9) independent of the dNTP concentration, the F506G mutant could only add one nucleotide at the position corresponding to the AP site and was unable to further elongate the nascent DNA chain, even at high dNTPs concentrations (lanes 10-17). When total DNA synthesis (calculated from the intensities of the bands) was plotted as a function of the nucleotide substrate concentration (Fig. 3C), pol lambda wt showed an apparent maximal rate of elongation of 0.32 min-1, whereas the F506G mutant exhibited a rate of 0.05 min-1.

We have recently shown that pol lambda has intrinsic terminal transferase activity, with a preference for pyrimidine nucleotides (7). This is also evident from the time-course experiments shown in Figure 4A, where the terminal transferase activity of pol lambda wt was tested with a 66mer ssDNA oligonucleotide as substrate, in the presence of different radioactively labelled deoxynucleotides. Pol lambda incorporated all three pyrimidine nucleotides (dTTP, dCTP and dUTP) with higher efficiency than the purine dATP, in accordance with previous data (7). Next, the pol lambda mutants Y505A, F506G and F506R were compared under the same conditions to pol lambda wt in the presence of labelled dTTP. As can be seen from Figure 4B and C, the Y505A mutant showed a reduced ability to incorporate dTTP, compared to the wild-type enzyme, whereas the mutants F506G and F506R showed almost no detectable activity. These results indicated that the two pol lambda residues Y505 and F506 are important for polymerisation in both the DNA polymerase and terminal transferase activities.

Pol lambda wt and pol lambda Y505A were compared in a terminal transferase assay for their ability to incorporate dTTP or dATP in the presence of either Mn2+ or Mg2+ as the metal activators. Both metals were tested since it is known that the nature of the divalent ion can influence the nucleotide specificity of polymerases. In particular, pol lambda has recently been shown to utilise both Mg2+ and Mn2+, but with very different efficiencies (18). As shown in Figure 5A and B, the terminal transferase activity of pol lambda, either wild-type or the mutant, showed a clear preference for Mn2+ as the activating metal. However, in the presence of both Mn2+ and Mg2+, the pol lambda Y505A mutant showed reduced dTTP incorporation with respect to pol lambda wt, whereas the incorporation of dATP was comparable for the two enzymes. In order to better understand the molecular basis for this effect, a detailed kinetic and thermodynamic analysis was performed for the incorporation of pyrimidine (dTTP and dUTP) and purine (dATP) nucleotides by the terminal transferase activity of pol lambda wt and the Y505A mutant. The results are summarised in Table 2. The apparent rate of incorporation (kcat) of pol lambda wt was 4- and 3-fold higher for dTTP and dUTP, respectively, than for dATP, thus explaining the observed preference for pyrimidine nucleotides as substrates for the terminal transferase activity. Pol lambda Y505A, on the other hand, showed comparable efficiency of dATP incorporation (kcat/Km values) with respect to the wild-type, but a 3- to 4-fold reduction in the incorporation efficiencies of dTTP and dUTP. This effect was mainly due to differences in the Km values for the pyrimidine nucleotides of the pol lambda Y505A mutant with respect to pol lambda wt. Interestingly, comparison of the kinetic parameters for dTTP and dUTP incorporation for the DNA polymerisation activity reported in Table 1 with the corresponding values for the terminal transferase activity reported in Table 2 revealed that the difference between pol lambda wt and the Y505A mutant for pyrimidine utilisation was specific for the terminal transferase activity.

In mammalian cells, four members of the pol X family have been identified so far: pol beta, TdT, pol lambda and pol micro (5). Pol beta performs template-directed incorporation of nucleotides, whereas TdT adds nucleotides to the 3'-end of a DNA strand, in a template-independent manner. Strikingly, pol lambda and pol micro possess both template-directed polymerisation and terminal transferase activities (7,17). Crystal structures are available for pol beta and TdT (8-13). Based on these structures and on mutagenesis studies, the residues important for nucleotide binding and catalysis have been identified. Sequence alignments with the other members of the polymerase X family showed that these residues belong to highly conserved domains. One of the conserved dNTP-binding domains is shown in Figure 6. Its sequence is LYFTGS in human pol beta (amino acids 270-275) and human pol lambda (amino acids 504-509) and LGWTGS (amino acids 447-452) in human TdT. In pol beta, the Y271 residue has been shown to constitute the floor of the dNTP-binding pocket and was proposed to contribute to stabilisation of the enzyme-primer complex by engaging a hydrogen bond with the primer base (12). It is interesting to note that Y271 is conserved in pol lambda (corresponding to Y505), but not in TdT, which bears a glycine at this position (G447). This suggests that the function of this residue is different for template-directed polymerases and for TdT. The adjacent amino acid (F272 in pol beta) plays an essential role in catalysis. When pol beta adopts its 'closed' conformation prior to catalysis, the phenyl ring of F272 disrupts the salt bridge between D192 and R258, freeing D192 to coordinate the nucleotide binding metal ion (12). Interestingly, the pol beta residue R258 is not conserved in pol lambda, whose corresponding amino acid is I492. However, in a structural model of the pol lambda structure, based on the known structures of pol beta and TdT, the F506 side chain has been predicted to be in close contact with the I492 residue, similarly to the F272 and R258 side chains in pol beta. A F272L mutation has been described, which greatly increased the error rate of pol beta (15). The F272 residue of pol beta corresponds to W449 in human TdT. In the crystal structure of murine TdT, the aromatic ring of residue W450 was shown to be parallel and stacked with the base ring of the incoming nucleotide and also to make contacts with its sugar moiety (13). These observations suggest an important role of an aromatic residue at this position for both template-dependent and template-independent DNA polymerases.

According to this prediction, the pol lambda F506G/R mutants analysed in the present work showed a 50- to 100-fold reduction in the apparent catalytic rate (kcat) for template-dependent nucleotide incorporation (Table 1) and virtually undetectable terminal transferase activity (Fig. 4B and C) with respect to pol lambda wt. Interestingly, we found a strong decrease in the processivity of the the pol lambda F506G/R mutants, which dissociated after every two to four incorporation events (Fig. 2A), together with a concomitant increase in the apparent affinity of the mutated enzymes for the primer-template (Table 1). Since processivity is defined as the number (n) of incorporation events per dissociation event, n = kpol/koff, where kpol is the true polymerisation rate and koff is the rate of dissociation of the enzyme from the template, one possibility is that the F506G/R mutations lower both the dissociation rate (koff) and the catalytic rate (kpol), so that kpol approximately 2-4 koff, hence n approximately 2-4. The alternative possibility is that these mutations increased the koff rate of the enzyme from the DNA template. However, this would be in contrast to the observed increase in the affinity for the DNA template (Table 1). Moreover, in such a case we would have expected to see at least a partial rescue of the processivity upon addition of PCNA, since it has been shown that PCNA lowers the koff rate of pol lambda for dissociation from the template. The experiments shown in Figures 1B and 2B, however, clearly indicated no effect of PCNA on the processivity of the F506G/R mutants.

The ability of a particular polymerase to bypass a non-instructional lesion like an AP site depends on its ability to adopt a less constrained conformation at the nucleotide-binding site (19), which usually preferentially accommodates the templating base and the complementary nucleotide. We have compared the AP translesion capacity of pol lambda wt and the Y505A and F506G mutants under standing start conditions. The F506G mutant showed an impaired capacity to catalyse elongation past the lesion under these conditions (Fig. 3A). The apparent maximal rate of translesion synthesis was calculated as 0.32 min-1 for the wild-type enzyme and 0.05 min-1 for the F506G mutant. Comparison with the kcat values listed in Table 1 for normal DNA synthesis showed that pol lambda wt had an approximately34-fold reduction in its catalytic rate, due to the presence of an abasic site at position +1. On the other hand, the F506G mutant showed only a 4-fold reduction in reaction rate. The mutant enzyme can catalyse only the first step of the AP site bypass process, namely incorporation in front of the lesion, but not elongation, whereas pol lambda wt can do both. This suggests that, rather than incorporation in front of the lesion, the subsequent elongation is the major rate-limiting step for pol lambda. Based on the increased distributivity of the F506G mutant (Fig. 2), we propose that during bypass of an abasic site by pol lambda the enzyme can incorporate one nucleotide in front of the lesion without dissociating. Subsequent elongation of the resulting primer end, on the other hand, causes a major pausing of the enzyme. Due to its severely impaired catalytic efficiency and reduced processivity, the F506G mutant likely dissociates from the template during this pausing phase before having the chance to incorporate one additional nucleotide, resulting in virtually no elongation beyond the AP site. It is interesting here to note that the Y505A mutation had no detectable effect on the bypass ability of pol lambda, however, as summarised in Table 1, both the apparent Km and kcat for nucleotide incorporation of the pol lambda Y505A mutant were decreased with respect to the wild-type enzyme. This phenotype was very similar to that observed for the corresponding Y271A mutant of pol beta (14), and might suggest a perturbation of the nucleotide-binding pocket.

Clear evidence for a role of the pol lambda Y505 residue in nucleotide binding specificity comes from the results on the effects of this mutation on the terminal transferase activity of pol lambda. As shown in Figure 4 and Table 2, the pol lambda Y505A mutant had a reduced ability to catalyse the terminal addition of pyrimidine deoxynucleotides to single-stranded DNA, but showed similar efficiency to the wild-type enzyme when purine deoxynucleotides were used as substrates. The apparent catalytic rates (kcat values) for the wild-type pol lambda terminal transferase activity (Table 2) were much lower than the corresponding rates for template-dependent nucleotide incorporation (Table 1). This was likely due to the very high distributivity of the terminal transferase reaction, which usually adds only a few nucleotides for each DNA binding event. Thus, at steady-state, the limiting rate of the reaction is indeed dissociation of the enzyme from the DNA substrate, hence kcat approximately koff.

In summary, the results presented here suggest essential functional roles in both the template-dependent (i.e. DNA polymerase) and template-independent (i.e. terminal transferase) activities of pol lambda for two highly conserved residues in the nucleotide-binding pocket of the X family polymerases. The F506 residue appears to have a critical role in catalysis, whereas the Y505 residue seems to be critical for the specificity of nucleotide incorporation by the pol lambda terminal transferase activity.

Reactions were carried out under the conditions described in Materials and Methods, in the presence of 50 nM 5'-end-labelled 18/73mer primer-template oligonucleotide (see Materials and Methods for details of the sequence) containing a single synthetic AP site at position +1. Pol lambda wild-type (80 nM, lanes 2-9) or F506G (75 nM, lanes 10-17) was tested in the presence of increasing concentrations of nucleotides, as indicated at the bottom of the panel.

The arrow on the right side indicates the position of the product resulting from incorporation of a nucleotide in front of the lesion. (C) The bands of the gel shown in (B) were quantified by scanning densitometry. Since the concentration of the input substrate was known, the relative intensities, normalised for the total intensity of each lane, were converted into apparent velocities (pmols min-1), which were then plotted against the nucleotide substrate concentrations. Curves were fitted to the Michelis-Menten equation as described in Materials and Methods.

 A highly conserved nucleotide-binding domain in X family DNA polymerases. The sequence of human pol lambda (lambdahu) has been aligned to murine pol lambda (lambdamus), human pol beta (betahu), human TdT (tdthu) and murine TdT (tdtmus). The two residues considered in this study have been highlighted in yellow and the respective substitutions made by site-directed mutagenesis are indicated in red, below the human pol lambda sequence. The Trp residue in the TdT sequence, which is functionally homologous to the Phe of pol lambda and pol beta, is highlighted in green. Light blue shading was used to box all the other amino acids conserved in at least three different enzymes. The identity within these nine amino acids is 100% between human and mouse pol lambda, 100% between human and mouse TdT, 77.8% between pol lambda and pol beta, 66.7% between TdT and pol lambda and 44.4% between TdT and pol beta.
