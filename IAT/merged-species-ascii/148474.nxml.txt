The Schizosaccharomyces pombe homologue of Mre11, Rad32, is required for repair of UV- and ionising radiation-induced DNA damage and meiotic recombination. In this study we have investigated the role of Rad32 and other DNA damage response proteins in non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) and telomere length maintenance in S.pombe. We show that NHEJ in S.pombe occurs by an error-prone mechanism, in contrast to the accurate repair observed in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Deletion of the rad32 gene results in a modest reduction in NHEJ activity and the remaining repair events that occur are accurate. Mutations in two of the phosphoesterase motifs in Rad32 have no effect on the efficiency or accuracy of end joining, suggesting that the role of Rad32 protein may be to recruit another nuclease(s) for processing during the end joining reaction. We also analysed NHEJ in other DNA damage response mutants and showed that the checkpoint mutant rad3-d and two recombination mutants defective in rhp51 and rhp54 (homologues of S.cerevisiae RAD51 and RAD54, respectively) are not affected. However disruption of rad22, rqh1 and rhp9 / crb2 (homologues of the S.cerevisiae RAD52, SGS1 and RAD9 genes) resulted in increased NHEJ activity. Telomere lengths in the rad32, rhp9 and rqh1 null alleles were reduced to varying extents intermediate between the lengths observed in wild-type and rad3 null cells.
