Background
###end title 2
###begin p 3
Proteolysis of huntingtin (Htt) plays a key role in the pathogenesis of Huntington's disease (HD). However, the environmental cues and signaling pathways that regulate Htt proteolysis are poorly understood. One stimulus may be the DNA damage that accumulates in neurons over time, and the subsequent activation of signaling pathways such as those regulated by IkappaB kinase (IKK), which can influence neurodegeneration in HD.

Methodology/Principal Findings
###end title 4
###begin p 5
We asked whether DNA damage induces the proteolysis of Htt and if activation of IKK plays a role. We report that treatment of neurons with the DNA damaging agent etoposide or gamma-irradiation promotes cleavage of wild type (WT) and mutant Htt, generating N-terminal fragments of 80-90 kDa. This event requires IKKbeta and is suppressed by IKKalpha. Elevated levels of IKKalpha, or inhibition of IKKbeta expression by a specific small hairpin RNA (shRNA) or its activity by sodium salicylate, prevents Htt proteolysis and increases neuronal resistance to DNA damage. Moreover, IKKbeta phosphorylates the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-xL, a modification known to reduce Bcl-xL levels, and activates caspases that can cleave Htt. When IKKbeta expression is blocked, etoposide treatment does not decrease Bcl-xL and activation of caspases is diminished. Similar to silencing of IKKbeta, increasing the level of Bcl-xL in neurons prevents etoposide-induced caspase activation and Htt proteolysis.

Conclusions/Significance
###end title 6
###begin p 7
These results indicate that DNA damage triggers cleavage of Htt and identify IKKbeta as a prominent regulator. Moreover, IKKbeta-dependent reduction of Bcl-xL is important in this process. Thus, inhibition of IKKbeta may promote neuronal survival in HD as well as other DNA damage-induced neurodegenerative disorders.

Huntington's disease is a neurodegenerative disorder caused by expansion of a CAG repeat, which is translated into a polyglutamine (polyQ) stretch in the N-terminus of Htt protein [1]. Neurotoxicity in HD is attributed to the cleaved N-terminal fragments of mutant Htt [2]-[4]. Wild type Htt is also cleaved and inactivated by proteases, and its deletion in the central nervous system (CNS) promotes neurodegeneration and is deleterious for development [5]-[6]. The neuroprotective functions of WT Htt include inhibition of caspase-3, induction and transport of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), and guarding against DNA damage and excitotoxicity [7]-[11].

DNA double-stranded breaks progressively accumulate in the aging brain, and elevated DNA damage is found in HD patients and HD animal models [11]-[14]. The vulnerability of neurons to DNA damage in HD is further exemplified by reduced expression of nuclear proteins such as high mobility group B 1(HMGB1), which protects against genotoxic stress [12], [15]. Elevated expression of HMGBs protects against polyQ-induced neurotoxicity in primary neurons and in a Drosophila polyQ model [15]. DNA damage induced by oxidative stress is also an important factor in the development of neurotoxicity and phenotypic changes in a chemical model of HD [16]. Thus, accumulation of DNA damage is a potential regulator of HD pathology. However, the mechanism for how DNA damage influences neurotoxicity in HD is not well understood. One contributing factor may be the DNA damage-induced activation of p53 and IKK signaling pathways, which have been implicated in HD neurotoxicity [14], [17]-[18].

DNA damage is a potent inducer of IKK [17]. The core complex has two kinases, IKKalpha and IKKbeta, and a regulatory subunit, IKKgamma [19]. As an activator of NF-kappaB, the IKK complex regulates inflammation, cytokine production and cell survival. The IKKbeta subunit is the predominant kinase responsible for inflammatory responses [19]. Excessive IKKbeta activity is, however, implicated in several neurodegenerative disorders, including HD, Alzheimer's disease (AD), and Parkinson's disease (PD) [18], [20]-[21]. It is relevant that HD patients have chronically elevated levels of inflammatory cytokines in the serum and CNS long before the onset of symptoms [22], implying that persistent dysregulation of IKK may occur early in the disease. In contrast, IKKalpha can repress IKKbeta activity and reduces the production of inflammatory cytokines [23]. IKKalpha also has neuroprotective properties and promotes memory reconsolidation in the hippocampus [24]. Moreover, nuclear IKKalpha inhibits the activity of tumor suppressor p53 that is induced by DNA damage, and increases cellular resistance to genotoxic stress [25]. P53 is elevated in HD brains and reducing its activity ameliorates HD symptoms in animal models [14].

We previously showed that HD mouse models have elevated IKKbeta/NF-kappaB in the CNS, and blocking IKKbeta activity prevents degeneration of medium-sized spiny neurons caused by a toxic fragment of mutant Htt [18]. Here we report that DNA damage-induced IKKbeta is an important activator of Htt proteolysis, while IKKalpha inhibits this event. We present evidence for a signaling network that involves phosphorylation and reduction of Bcl-xL by IKKbeta, and subsequent activation of caspases, which can cleave Htt.

In this study we used a human embryonic neuronal stem cell line (MESC2.10) isolated from the midbrain of an eight-week-old embryo [26], to characterize the signaling between DNA damage, IKKbeta activation and Htt turnover. To establish the model, MESC2.10 neuroblasts were differentiated and examined for expression of neuronal markers. Upon differentiation, MESC2.10 cells acquire neuronal morphology (Fig. 1A) and express neuron-specific proteins such as PSD-95, beta-catenin and the neurofilament Tuj-1 (Fig.1B, top two panels and 1C). These neurons can be maintained for more than two weeks without significant apoptosis (Fig. 1B, third panel). To induce DNA damage, we first used the topoisomerase inhibitor etoposide, which produces DNA double-stranded breaks in post-mitotic neurons [27]. The induction of DNA damage in MESC2.10 neurons was confirmed by nuclear staining of phosphorylated histone H2aX (gamma-H2aX), a surrogate marker of DNA damage (Figs. 1C and 1D) [28]. We used an acute etoposide treatment of 6 hr to avoid neuronal death, which occurs after prolonged incubation [27].

To determine if DNA damage activates IKK in neurons we first performed in vitro kinase assays using recombinant IkappaBalpha as the substrate for IKKbeta complexes immunoprecipitated from the extracts of etoposide-treated neurons. We find that IKKbeta is activated 2 hrs after etoposide treatment and remains active for up to 4 hrs (Fig. 2A top panel). These results are consistent with the effects of etoposide on IKKbeta in non-neuronal cells [17]. We were also interested in whether DNA damage influences IKKalpha activity, since this subunit appears to play a prominent role in survival and neuronal plasticity [24]-[25]. To obtain IKKalpha complexes devoid of IKKbeta, neuronal extracts were first depleted by prior incubation with anti-IKKgamma and -IKKbeta antibodies, and IKKalpha complexes were subsequently immunoprecipitated. IKKalpha activity is routinely tested in vitro by phosphorylation of IkappaBalpha, although in vivo this phosphorylation is predominantly performed by IKKbeta [19]. Interestingly, MESC2.10 neurons display constitutive IKKalpha activity (Fig. 2B, top lane 1). MESC2.10 neurons are grown in complex medium with several growth factors, some of which might be responsible for activation of IKKalpha. Longer treatment with etoposide, however, reduces IKKalpha activity (Fig. 2B, lanes 4). We also observe a decrease in the level of IKKalpha protein, which may contribute to the low IKKalpha activity (Fig. 2B, bottom panel). Thus, induction of DNA damage has opposite effects on the activity of IKKalpha and IKKbeta in neurons.

Induction of p53 by DNA damaging agents promotes the expression of Htt [29]. Consistent with these observations, we find that treatment of MESC2.10 neurons with etoposide increases the level of endogenous, full-length Htt approximately4-fold (Fig. 3A, top panel, asterisk, lanes 1-3). The elevation of Htt overlaps in time with accumulation of nuclear p53 (Fig. 3B, top panel, lanes 1-4). Longer exposure of neurons to etoposide induces proteolysis of endogenous Htt, however, generating N-terminal fragments of approximately80 kDa (Fig. 3A, top panel, lane 4, arrow). These data suggest that accumulation of DNA damage in neurons activates proteolytic enzymes that can cleave Htt.

(A) EGFP and IKKalpha-transduced neurons were treated with 10 microM of etoposide for the indicated times. Extracts were examined for Htt by Western blotting. The top panel shows staining with anti-Htt (mAb 2166) antibody. The asterisk indicates full-length endogenous Htt and the arrow shows the cleaved products. The second panel shows staining for tubulin. Fold changes for full-length Htt levels were obtained by measuring the band intensity in each lane, normalized to tubulin and compared to non-treated control. (B) p53 accumulates in the nucleus of etoposide treated neurons. Nuclear extracts from MESC2.10 neurons were examined for the presence p53 by Western blotting. Lanes 1-4 are nuclear extracts from MESC2.10 neurons with EGFP and lanes 5-8 are from neurons that were transduced with IKKalpha lentiviruses (Fig. 1C). Staining with anti-lamin B1 was used to ensure equal loading (bottom panel). (C) Western blot analysis of IKKalpha levels in the control and IKKalpha-expressing neurons. MESC2.10 neuroblasts were transduced with an IKKalpha recombinant lentivirus and differentiated as described in M&M. EGFP lentivirus was used as a control. Top panel shows the Western blot for IKKalpha and bottom panel is staining of the same blot for tubulin.

To confirm that Htt cleavage is induced by DNA damage and not other, secondary effects of etopoisde, we examined whether DNA damage induced by gamma-irradiation of neurons could have a similar effect on Htt cleavage. As expected, gamma-irradiation also generates an Htt fragment similar in size to that produced by etoposide treatment (Fig. S1). Interestingly, induction of Htt proteolysis by gamma-irradiation occurs faster than etoposide treatment and is prominent by 4 hr post-irradiation, whereas maximal Htt proteolysis induced by etoposide requires approximately6 hr. The difference maybe due to rapid induction of double stranded DNA breaks by irradiation.

Since etoposide treatment reduces the level and activity of IKKalpha (Fig. 2B), we examined whether increasing its level could rescue the effects of DNA damage on Htt protein. MESC2.10 neurons were transduced with an IKKalpha lentivirus, which increases the level of IKKalpha by approximately3-fold (Fig. 3C). Indeed, this enables the IKKalpha+ neurons to resist etoposide-induced Htt proteolysis (Fig. 3A, top panel, lanes 5-8). IKKalpha+ neurons display a higher basal level of full-length WT Htt than controls (Fig. 3A, compare lanes 1 and 5), and accumulation of p53 in IKKalpha+ neurons (Fig. 3B, top panel, lanes 5-8) has no additional effect on Htt levels. The lack of further Htt elevation in IKKalpha+ neurons may be due to inhibition of p53 transcriptional activity by elevated IKKalpha [25]. While the interaction between p53, IKKalpha and Htt expression remains to be explored in detail, these findings support a protective role for IKKalpha in reducing proteolysis of endogenous, WT Htt in neurons with DNA damage.

In contrast, IKKbeta activity is induced by DNA damage (Fig. 2A). Thus, we hypothesized that reducing its level may be protective. Towards this end, we silenced IKKbeta expression with a specific, anti-IKKbeta small hairpin RNA (shRNA) expressed from a lentivirus (Fig. 4A), and treated the neurons with etoposide. We find that, similar to the effect of elevating IKKalpha, silencing IKKbeta expression reduces the proteolysis of Htt (Fig. 4B). Silencing of IKKbeta expression or inhibition of its kinase activity by sodium salicylate [30] also blocks Htt cleavage induced by gamma-irradiation (Fig. S1, lanes 8 and 5, respectively). Thus, IKKbeta activation by DNA damage promotes Htt cleavage, and increasing IKKalpha or reducing IKKbeta blocks this event.

It is relevant that etoposide-induced IKKbeta activates p65 NF-kappaB DNA binding in MESC2.10 neurons (Figs. 4C and D). Interestingly, the DNA binding activity of p65 is significantly reduced in neurons with elevated IKKalpha (Fig. 4C). While IKKalpha is known to inhibit IKKbeta/NF-kappaB in immune cells [23], this has not been reported for post-mitotic neurons. Therefore, the protective effects of IKKalpha in response to DNA damage may include inhibition of IKKbeta activity. However, inhibitors of NF-kappaB do not influence Htt proteolysis, suggesting that IKKbeta regulation of Htt proteolysis is NF-kappaB independent (see below). Etoposide has no effect on the activation of p52 NF-kappaB in MESC2.10 neurons (Fig. 4D).

Several caspases, including caspase-3 and -6, are known to cleave Htt between amino acids 500-600 generating fragments similar in size to those observed in our DNA damage paradigm (Fig. 3A) [2]-[5]. To better understand the role of the IKKs in etoposide-induced Htt cleavage, we measured the activity of the caspases. Both procaspase-3 and -6 levels are reduced after 6 hrs of etoposide treatment (Fig. 5A, lane 4), which coincides with the timing of Htt proteolysis (Fig. 3A, lane 4). Consistent with the reduction of procaspases, the extracts of etoposide-treated neurons display elevated caspase-3 and caspase-6 activities and are blocked by specific caspase inhibitors (Figs. 5B and 5C, columns 2 and 3, respectively). On the other hand, neurons with elevated IKKalpha resist activation of procaspase-3 and procaspase-6 (Fig. 5A, compare lanes 4 and 8). Moreover, extracts of etoposide-treated IKKalpha+ neurons contain reduced caspase-3 and caspase-6 activity (Figs. 5B and 5C, column 6, respectively). Blocking IKKbeta activity with sodium salicylate, a potent inhibitor of IKKbeta [30], or silencing its expression by shRNA also lowers the etoposide-induced activation of caspases (Figs. 5B and 5C, columns 4 and 8, respectively). Thus, the opposite effects of IKKalpha and IKKbeta on caspase activation in the context of DNA damage may underlie their differential effects on Htt cleavage.

For the specific inhibitors neurons were first pretreated with 20 microM of Ac-DEVD-CHO, caspase-3 inhibitor (C3I) or 20 microM of Ac-VEID-CHO, caspase-6 inhibitor (C6I), or 5 mg/ml of sodium salicylate (NaSal) one hr prior to etoposide treatment for 6 hrs. Extracts were incubated with either caspase-3 substrate (DEVD conjugated to p-nitroanaline) or caspase-6 substrate (VEID conjugated to p-nitroanline) in a 96 well plate at 37degreesC for 1 hr. Enzyme activities for caspase-3 (B) or caspase-6 (C) were measured in a microplate reader. Results are shown as relative enzyme activity and represent averages of three experiments.

Activation of caspases can be triggered by several mechanisms, including reduction in Bcl-xL [31]. The prosurvival protein Bcl-xL, which is abundant in the CNS, has recently been implicated in Htt proteolysis in a chemical model of HD [32]-[33]. We find that the level of intact Bcl-xL is reduced in extracts of neurons treated with etoposide (Fig. 6A, lane 6). In contrast, etoposide treatment does not affect Bcl-xL in neurons with elevated IKKalpha or reduced IKKbeta expression (Fig. 6A, lanes 2 and 4, respectively). To confirm that Bcl-xL is important for blocking of DNA damage-induced Htt proteolysis, we increased its expression in MESC2.10 neurons using a recombinant lentivirus (Fig. 6B, second panel, lanes 3 and 4). As predicted, elevated Bcl-xL prevents Htt proteolysis by DNA damage and this overlaps in time with prevention of caspase-3 activation (Fig. 6B first and third panels, respectively). Although Bcl-xL expression prevents DNA damage-induced Htt cleavage, some reduction in the level of full-length Htt is also observed. Whether etoposide treatment induces production of other Htt fragments that are not detected by this anti-Htt antibody and not protected by Bcl-xL, remains to be investigated. Overall, these studies indicate that Bcl-xL level is a critical component of caspase-mediated Htt proteolysis induced by DNA damage, and is likely influenced by IKKbeta.

The level of Bcl-xL mRNA in MESC2.10 neurons is not affected by etoposide (data not shown), indicating that Bcl-xL reduction is likely due to enhanced protein turnover. Although phosphorylation-induced degradation of Bcl-xL in the presence of genotoxic agents is a necessary step for induction of apoptosis, it is unclear which kinase(s) mediates this event [31]. We tested the possibility that activated IKKbeta phosphorylates Bcl-xL. To avoid contamination with other neuronal kinases that may co-immunoprecipitate with IKKbeta, we used recombinant IKKs for in vitro kinase assays with Bcl-xL as the substrate. Indeed, IKKbeta phosphorylates Bcl-xL (Fig. 6C, top panel), and this is specific since inhibition of IKKbeta by sodium salicylate prevents this reaction, and IKKalpha does not phosphorylate Bcl-xL. Thus, IKKbeta is a novel kinase that modifies Bcl-xL and reduces its level in stressed, post-mitotic neurons. This is consistent with the unchanged levels of Bcl-xL in etoposide-treated neurons in which IKKbeta expression has been silenced (Fig. 6A).

Generation of N-terminal fragments of mutant Htt is thought to initiate neurotoxicity, culminating in HD [2]-[4]. We tested whether DNA damage also promotes the proteolysis of full-length mutant Htt. In a striatal neuronal line obtained from HD knock-in mice (HdhQ111/Q111) [34], we find that etoposide treatment also promotes cleavage of full-length, mutant Htt protein (Fig. 7, top panel, lane 2). This proteolysis is blocked by inhibition of caspase-3 or IKKbeta activity (Fig. 7 top panel, lanes 3 and 4). Moreover, cleavage of Htt overlaps in time with reduction of Bcl-xL, which is prevented by inhibition of IKKbeta with sodium salicylate (Fig. 7, second panel). Taken together, these results indicate that, in post-mitotic neurons, DNA damage-activated IKKbeta facilitates Htt proteolysis indirectly by promoting Bcl-xL turnover and activating a caspase pathway. Thus, in the context of neuronal DNA damage, IKKbeta activation is detrimental and its inhibition may be protective in HD and potentially in other neurodegenerative disorders where DNA damage plays a role.

The novel aspects of present work are the triggering of Htt proteolysis by DNA damage and the identification of IKKbeta as a prominent regulator of enzymes known to cleave Htt. We propose that in post-mitotic neurons, IKKbeta activation by DNA damage promotes Htt cleavage by influencing Bcl-xL and a caspase pathway. Conversely, our data support a protective role for IKKalpha, whose expression in neurons prevents DNA damage-induced Htt proteolysis (Fig. 8).

(A) DNA damage activates IKKbeta, which can phosphorylate Bcl-xL and enhance its degradation (arrow 1). Reduction of Bcl-xL levels triggers the activation of caspases, which cleaves Htt. IKKbeta inhibition block degradation of Bcl-xL, caspases activation, and proteolysis of Htt. Similar to the inhibition of IKKbeta, elevation of Bcl-xL also prevents caspase activation and Htt proteolysis. On the other hand, etoposide treatment reduces the activity of IKKalpha (arrow 2). This may enhance IKKbeta activation and/or block expression of neuroprotective proteins that are essential for interfering with caspase activation and maintaining Htt levels. Elevated IKKalpha expressed from a lentivirus overcomes these deficiencies and prevents Htt proteolysis.

Although acute IKKbeta activation is known to be predominantly pro-survival, under certain circumstances it promotes apoptosis and neurodegeneration [20], [35]. For example, conditional deletion of IKKbeta delays apoptosis by inhibiting caspase-3 in regressing mammary epithelial cells [35]. Aberrant activation of IKKbeta has also been implicated in neurotoxicity in HD, PD, AD, multiple sclerosis, and ischemia-induced neuronal death [18], [21], [36]-[38]. Our data indicate that activation of IKKbeta by DNA damage may injure neurons by increasing the turnover of WT Htt. It is notable that both WT and mutant Htt are cleaved in our DNA damage paradigm. Neurons in HD brains, which have WT and mutant copies of Htt, may therefore be susceptible to DNA-induced damage on both counts. In addition to loss of WT Htt function, cleavage of the mutant Htt could also generate toxic N-terminal fragments that are amyloidogenic [4]. Thus, DNA damage-induced IKKbeta in the HD brain may set in motion one of the earliest events in HD pathology. Other insults such as chronic exposure to pro-inflammatory cytokines, which are elevated in the plasma and brain tissue of pre-symptomatic HD patients, may also cause persistent activation of IKKbeta in neurons and further exacerbate the cleavage of Htt [19], [22]. A potential source for these cytokines is the activated microglia that are detected in various parts of HD brains, including striatum and hypothalamus [39], [40]. It is interesting that deletion of IKKbeta in microglia reduces neurodegeneration in a chemical model of HD by suppressing the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines [41]. While the role of cytokines in IKKbeta-dependent Htt proteolysis remains to be characterized, we can speculate that activation of IKKbeta in neurons may trigger Htt proteolysis cell autonomously, as in the induction of DNA damage, or non-autonomously by chronic exposure to pro-inflammatory cytokines produced by microglia (41). It is also of interest that inhibitors of IKKbeta reduce proteolysis of amyloid precursor protein (APP) and subsequent Abeta42 production [38]. The regulation of amyloidogenic proteins such as Abeta and N-terminal Htt fragments by activated IKKbeta is an intriguing area for future work.

In contrast to IKKbeta, IKKalpha promotes neuronal survival and prevents Htt proteolysis. This could simply result from suppression of IKKbeta activity by IKKalpha (Fig. 4C) [23]. However, IKKalpha has several other neuroprotective properties that could be important. For example, IKKalpha activates CREB binding protein (CBP), a transcriptional co-activator of many neuronal signaling pathways including BDNF expression [25], [42]. Enhancement of the histone acetyltransferase activity of CBP is known to reduce the toxicity of mutant Htt [43]. IKKalpha also inhibits the transcriptional activity of p53, which has been implicated in HD pathogenesis, and promotes neuronal plasticity and memory formation in the hippocampus [14], [24]-[25]. Thus, IKKalpha may prevent Htt proteolysis independent of IKKbeta by modulating expression and/or activation of gene products that antagonize the toxic effects of DNA damage. Further examination of IKKalpha using gene therapy or compounds that selectively enhance its functions in vivo is worthy of investigation in HD animal models.

The mechanism of Htt proteolysis is complex and probably involves integration of multiple signaling pathways. Our results identify Bcl-xL as a potential mediator of DNA damage-induced Htt proteolysis (Fig. 6). Bcl-xL participates in neuronal survival, and its degradation results in synaptic degeneration [32]. Our findings indicate that DNA damage reduces Bcl-xL levels in an IKKbeta-dependent manner. A role for IKKbeta is supported by the inability of etoposide to reduce Bcl-xL in neurons expressing an shRNA targeting IKKbeta, or following pretreatment with sodium salicylate, a potent inhibitor of IKKbeta (Figs. 6A and 7). We propose that IKKbeta reduces Bcl-xL levels by phosphorylation (Fig. 6C), a modification known to promote Bcl-xL degradation [31]. Phosphorylation-dependent reduction of Bcl-xL is suggested to play a role in spinal cord neuronal injury and is implicated in Htt proteolysis in the striatum of 3-nitropropionic acid injected mice [33], [44]. Thus, reduction of Bcl-xL may be the signal that leads to activation of caspases that target Htt (Fig. 8). Inhibition of caspase-3 activation and Htt proteolysis in neurons with elevated Bcl-xL further supports this notion (Fig. 6B).

Environmental factors appear to play a role in the development of HD, since the age of onset is variable among patients with similar polyQ expansions [45]. Accumulation of DNA damage as well as activation of modifiers that influence Htt proteolysis could impact disease progression. Our data indicate that IKKbeta induced by DNA damage in neurons can be very significant, and inhibition of IKKbeta can prevent depletion of WT Htt as well as the production of toxic N-terminal fragments of mutant Htt. It is noteworthy that IKKbeta is itself activated by N-terminal fragments of mutant Htt [18]. Thus, Htt proteolysis and IKKbeta activation can form a toxic feedback loop that could promote neurodegeneration. This cycle can be influenced by cytokines that are induced by IKKbeta activation and which are elevated in HD patients [22]. IKKalpha, on the other hand, may act as a brake to suppress excessive IKKbeta activation and reduce neurotoxicity (Fig. 8). Thus, the ratio of IKKalpha to IKKbeta activity may be a determinant of Htt proteolysis in stressed neurons. Identification of the IKKs as regulators of Htt proteolysis offers novel targets to search for molecules that prevent one of the earliest events in HD pathogenesis.

The methods for generation and differentiation of MESC2.10 human neuroblasts have been reported previously [26]. Briefly, neuroblasts obtained from an 8 week-old human embryo were transduced with a retrovirus encoding a tetracycline-regulated v-myc to promote proliferation. These neuroblasts were grown on poly-lysine and laminin coated plates in DMEM/F12 in the presence N2 and B-27 neuronal supplements (Invitrogen) and 20 ng/ml FGF-2 (Promega). To differentiate MESC2.10 cells, proliferation medium was replaced DMEM/F12 medium containing 2 microg/ml of doxycycline and 5 microM cAMP.

For most experiments we used approximately120 microg of lysate for SDS-PAGE and Western blotting with the indicated antibodies. Reactive bands in Western blots were detected by enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) using a gel documentation system. Sodium salicylate (5 mg/ml), caspase-3 inhibitor (Ac-DEVD-CHO) and casapse-6 inhibitor (Ac-VEID-CHO) were added at 20 microM 1 hr prior to etoposide treatment. To examine the effects of etoposide on mutant Htt differentiated mouse striatal cells (HdhQ111/Q111) were treated with etoposide and analyzed as described for MESC2.10 cells.

Differentiated neurons on coverslips were treated with 10 microM etoposide for 4 hr. Cells were fixed and stained with a rabbit antibody that specifically recognizes H2aX phosphorylated at Ser 139 (gamma-H2aX) (1:500) (R&D systems). Anti-Tuj-1 was used to label the cytoplasm (1:1000). Goat anti-rabbit conjugated to FITC (green) and goat anti-mouse conjugated to rhodamine (red) was used as secondary antibodies. Pictures were captured with a confocal microscope.

IKKalpha was cloned into the lentiviral FUGW vector under the control of a ubiquitin promoter [46]. An EGFP-lentivirus was used as a control. The Bcl-xL cDNA was cloned from MESC2.10 neurons by RT-PCR using standard procedures and its identity confirmed by sequencing. The cDNA was subsequently inserted into FUGW lentiviral vector. The shRNAs for IKKbeta cloned in a lentiviral backbone was purchased from Open Biosystems (Huntsville, AL). Lentiviruses were produced by transfection of 293 cells using calcium phosphate precipitation [46]. Supernatants of virus-producing cells were harvested 48 hr post-transfection and concentrated on Amicon Ultra columns (Millipore, MA). An EGFP virus was used as a control to monitor viral titer. A multiplicity of infection of 4:1 was used to infect MESC2.10 neuroblasts. Expression of IKKalpha, Bcl-xL and reduction of IKKbeta were determined by Western blotting.

IKKbeta activity was assayed as described previously [18]. To determine IKKalpha activity, lyastes were first depleted of IKKbeta complexes using 4 microg of anti-IKKgamma and anti-IKKbeta antibodies coupled to protein G. The depleted lysates were used to isolate IKKalpha complexes with 2 microg of anti-IKKalpha antibody. GST-IkappaBalpha was used as a substrate to measure kinase activity. To examine whether IKKs phosphorylate Bcl-xL, 0.5 microg of either IKKalpha or IKKbeta were incubated with 1 microg of full-length Bcl-xL in the presence of 32P-gamma-ATP for 30 min at 30degreesC. GST protein was used as a negative control. All kinase products were examined by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography.

Nuclear extracts for control or etoposide-treated MESC2.10 neurons were obtained using the cell fractionation kit from pierce according to the instructions provided. Fifty microg of each nuclear extract was incubated for an hour at RT on 96 well plates (Clonetech, Mountain View, CA) coated with consensus NF-kappaB oligonucleotides (p65 or p52). Mutated NF-kappaB oligonucleotides were used to confirm binding specificity. For competition assays, nuclear extracts were pre-incubated with NF-kappaB oligonucleotides for 1 hr on ice and then added to the coated wells. After washing, each well was incubated with anti-p65 or anti-p52 antibodies for 30 min at 37degreesC. Wells were washed as recommended by the manufacturer (Clontech), followed by incubation with a secondary antibody conjugated to HRP. TMB (3, 3', 5, 5'-tetramethylbenzidine) was added for 10 min. Binding was measured in a microplate reader at 655 nm.

To measure the activity of caspase-3 or -6, the colorimetric assay kits from R&D Systems were used according to manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, MESC2.10 neurons were pre-incubated with caspase-3 inhibitor (Ac-DEVD-CHO), casapse-6 inhibitor (Ac-VEID-CHO) or sodium salicylate (5 mg/ml) 1 hr prior to etoposide treatment, which was for an additional 6 hrs. Cells were lysed as instructed. Fifty microg of each lysate was incubated with either caspase-3 substrate (DEVD conjugated to p-nitroanaline) or caspase-6 substrate (VEID conjugated to p-nitronalaine) in a 96 well plate at 37degreesC for 1 hr. Enzyme activities for caspase-3 or -6 were measured with a microplate reader at 405 nm. Results are shown as relative enzyme activity and represent average of three experiments.
