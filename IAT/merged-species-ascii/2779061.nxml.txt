Changes in lens protein expression during zebrafish development results in a smooth gradient of refractive index necessary for excellent optical function. Age-related changes in crystallin expression have been well documented in mammals but are poorly understood in the zebrafish.

In the zebrafish lens, a systematic analysis of protein content with age was performed using size exclusion chromatography (SEC) combined with linear trap quadrupole Fourier transform tandem mass spectrometry (LTQ-FT LC-MS/MS; rank-order shotgun) proteomics in lenses of larval, juvenile, and adult zebrafish.

alpha-Crystallins, previously shown to have low abundance in the zebrafish lens, were found to increase dramatically with maturation and aging. SEC determined that beta-crystallin was predominant at 4.5 days. With age, the alpha- and gamma-crystallins increased, and a high molecular weight fraction appeared between six weeks and six months to become the dominant component by 2.5 years. Similarly, shotgun proteomics determined that beta-crystallins were the predominant proteins in the young lens. With age, the proportion of alpha- and gamma-crystallins increased dramatically. After crystallins, calpain 3, membrane, and cytoskeletal proteins were most abundant. Five new beta-crystallins and 13 new gamma-crystallins were identified.

Lens crystallins are proteins expressed at high concentrations in lens cells to achieve the high index of refraction required for normal optical function. Crystallin proteins are organized in short-range, glass-like order in the cytoplasm and are vital for the development and maintenance of lens transparency [1-3]. alpha-Crystallins, members of the small-heat shock protein family, protect against lens opacity by preventing the aggregation of unfolding proteins and maintaining cytoskeletal organization [4-8]. Similarly, mutations in alpha-, beta-, or gamma-crystallins have been linked to loss of transparency and human congenital cataract formation [9,10].

The expression levels of different crystallins vary throughout development and aging, which leads to different crystallin levels in different regions of the lens since lens cells are retained throughout the lifespan of an organism. Changing crystallin expression may be vital for lens function, which depends on a smooth gradient of refractive index that corrects for spherical and chromatic aberration [11-13]. Age-related changes in crystallin expression have been well documented in mammals but are poorly understood in the zebrafish, which as an aquatic vertebrate has an even higher index of refraction in the lens than the mammal. In terrestrial species, the cornea contributes to image refraction at the air-cornea barrier while in aquatic species, the index of refraction of the cornea is almost identical to water so the lens is responsible for image refraction [14].

There are many similarities in the optical and biophysical properties of zebrafish and mammalian lenses including expression of many of the same crystallins. Both zebrafish and mammalian lenses contain alphaA- and alphaB-crystallins, although the zebrafish has a gene duplication in alphaB-crystallin resulting in the expression of both alphaBa- and alphaBb-crystallins [15-17]. The beta-crystallin proteins are also similar between zebrafish and mammals, and it has been proposed that six beta-crystallin genes are found in all vertebrates [18,19]. gamma-Crystallins are more divergent. Humans and mice contain genes for gammaA- through gammaF-crystallins, although gammaD- and gammaF-crystallins are pseudogenes in humans and these are specific to terrestrial mammals. Both zebrafish and mammals express gammaN-and gammaS-crystallins, and zebrafish additionally have multiple members of the gammaM-crystallin family of aquatic crystallin in the lens [20-22].

While crystallin gene and protein expression have been examined in the adult zebrafish lens and a few additional embryonic crystallins have been identified, this report is the first systematic analysis of changing crystallin expression during development and aging. We used size exclusion chromatography (SEC) combined with linear trap quadrupole Fourier transform tandem mass spectrometry (LTQ-FT LC-MS/MS; rank-order shotgun) proteomics to analyze protein expression in the lenses of larval, juvenile, and adult zebrafish. Advanced shotgun proteomics techniques allowed the identification of parent proteins from individual peptides in a complex protein sample [23,24]. With mass accuracies below 5 parts-per-million, shotgun proteomics is more sensitive than two dimensional (2D) polyacryamide gel electrophoresis for separation and detection of proteins with low abundance [25]. As expected, SEC and proteomics were consistent in the demonstration of varying levels of protein expression with age, especially among the crystallins. alpha-Crystallins, previously shown to have low abundance in the zebrafish lens, were found to increase dramatically during maturation and aging. Shotgun proteomics also identified novel crystallin peptides in the zebrafish lens that confirmed the existence of hypothetical crystallins in the zebrafish genome.

Fish were housed at 28.5 degreesC on a 14/10 h light/dark cycle and cared for in accordance with the University of Washington Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. Lenses were dissected from WIK wild-type zebrafish, euthanized in 0.2 mM tricaine solution at 4.5 days (50 lenses), 10 days (50 lenses), three weeks (20 lenses), six weeks (20 lenses), six months (4 lenses), and 2.5 years (4 lenses) of age. All lenses appeared to be transparent. Fresh lenses were homogenized in 20 mM Tris-HCl and 1 mM EDTA, pH 8.0 on ice. After homogenization, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF) was added to the solution to yield a final concentration of 0.1 mM. Homogenized lenses were immediately prepared for mass spectrometric analysis or analyzed by size exclusion chromatography.

Lens homogenates were separated into major protein components using a Biosep SEC-S3000 column (Phenomenex, Torrance, CA) and an AKTApurifiertrade mark fast protein liquid chromatography (FLPC) (Amersham Biosciences, Pittsburgh, PA). A 50 mul sample of zebrafish lens homogenate (~2 mg/ml protein) was injected onto the column. The sample was eluted using 20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0 at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. Protein elution was measured by absorbance at 280 nm. Fractions were collected every 250 mul, and select fractions were prepared for analysis using mass spectrometry. Each chromatogram was run at least three times. Individual molecular weight standards from the Gel Filtration Calibration Kit (GE Healthcare, Buckinghamshire, UK) were run to calculate fraction size. Protein concentration was calculated for each fraction from the six-week lenses using a bicinchoninic acid assay (BCA) protein assay kit (Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA).

Mass spectrometry was used to identify and quantify proteins present in zebrafish lens homogenates and select SEC fractions. Fifty microliters of sample was mixed with 50 mul of 12 M urea, 100 mM NH4HCO3, 7 mul of 1.5 M Tris-HCl pH 8.0, and 2.5 mul of 200 mM tris(2-carboxyethyl)-phosphine (TCEP). The sample was allowed to incubate at 37 degreesC for 1 h. Next, 20 mul of 200 mM iodoacetamide was added, and the sample was incubated for 1 h at 22 degreesC in the dark. After incubation, 4 mul of 1 M dithiothreitol (DTT) was added to the sample to react with excess iodoacetamide and incubated for 1 h at 22 degreesC. The sample was then mixed with 800 mul of 25 mM NH4HCO3 and 200 mul of methanol. One microliter of 1 mg/ml sequencing grade trypsin (Promega, Madison, WI) was added to the sample and allowed to incubate at 22 degreesC for 16 h. The sample was dried and dissolved in 190 mul of 5% acetonitrile (ACN) and 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid (TFA). The sample was loaded onto a pre-equilibrated UltraMicro Spin C18 column (Nest Group, Southborough, MA) for desalting. Peptides were eluted from the column using 80% acetonitrile (ACN) and 0.1% TFA. The peptide sample was dried and dissolved in 100 mul of 5% acetonitrile (ACN) and 0.1% formic acid.

Peptides were subjected to collision induced dissociation (CID) during LTQ-FT LC-MS/MS (Thermo Scientific) analysis to generate peptide tandem mass spectra (known as shotgun proteomics). Gas phase fractionation (GPF) was used to increase both individual protein sequence and proteome coverage [26]. For quantification with GPF analysis, data was acquired in quadruplicate. Each data set had four sets of identical stage 1 mass spectrometry (MS1) data from which "peptide quantity" was derived and four sets of unique stage 2 mass spectrometry (MS2) data sets from which peptide sequences were derived. With GPF, the MS2 data was acquired from four unique mass-to-charge ratio (m/z) ranges (400-600, 600-800, 800-1200, and 1200-2000), while the MS1 data was always acquired from the 400-2000 m/z range to provide the statistical significance needed for quantification. The software SEQUEST (Thermo Scientific) generated peptide sequence matches and identified parent proteins based on the International Protein Index (). The algorithms, Peptide-Prophet and Protein-Prophet, used statistical routines to assign probability scores to the peptide sequence best fit and the likelihood that the parent protein was present [27,28]. Only proteins with a statistical probability score greater than or equal to 0.9 were included in the analysis. Spectral counting was used to calculate rank order from a single sample [29].

Size exclusion chromatography of the whole lens homogenates from WIK wild-type zebrafish determined the differences in major protein components in the larval (4.5 days, 10 days, 3 weeks), juvenile (6 weeks), adult (6 months), and aged (2.5 years) time points (Figure 1). Purified human alphaB-crystallin eluted from the column at 9.76 ml. Selected fractions from the six-month old lenses were analyzed by rank-order shotgun proteomics to confirm the protein composition of the predicted beta-crystallin, gamma-crystallin, and high molecular weight peaks (Table 1). The beta-crystallin peak fraction (10.50-10.75 ml) contained only beta-crystallins. The gamma-crystallin peak fraction (12.50-12.75 ml) contained five different gamma-crystallins and betaB2-crystallin, which was also present in the beta-crystallin peak. The high molecular weight peak fraction (9.25-9.50 ml) contained all three alpha-crystallins present in the fish lens as well as three gamma-crystallins, which were not observed in the gamma-crystallin peak. The shotgun proteomics confirmed that the major components in zebrafish lens crystallins separated by size exclusion chromatography into alpha-, beta-, and gamma-crystallin and high molecular weight peaks as observed in mammalian species.

Size exclusion chromatography of zebrafish lens homogenates during development and aging. Absorbance at 280 nm for detection of proteins was plotted versus elution volume (x-axis), which corresponds with molecular size. Individual protein molecular weight standards are shown at the bottom of the graph. High molecular weight aggregates elute early followed by a broad peak of polydisperse alpha-crystallin oligomers with an average size of 24 subunits. Next, a broad peak of beta-crystallin elutes from the column, which forms octamers, tetramers, and dimers, and finally, gamma-crystallins, which are monomeric, were observed. The youngest lenses (4.5 days) were dominated by a large broad beta-crystallin peak. alpha-Crystallin and gamma-crystallin abundance increased during lens maturation, and a high molecular weight peak, first observed at six months, increased with age to become the largest peak by 2.5 years.

In the homogenate of the 4.5-day lens, three broad protein peaks were observed, a small alpha-crystallin peak (9.78 ml), a large beta-crystallin peak (10.62 ml), and a small gamma-crystallin peak (11.79 ml; Figure 1). The alpha-crystallin peak remained small throughout the larval stage while the gamma-crystallin peak increased progressively at 10 days and three weeks. At six weeks when zebrafish reach the juvenile stage, the alpha-crystallin protein fractions (9.00-10.25 ml) increased dramatically to approximately 22% of the total protein concentration. At this stage, the beta-crystallin fractions (10.25-11.50 ml) were approximately 36% and the gamma-crystallin fractions (11.50-13.50 ml) were 42% of the total protein. No high molecular weight peak was present up to six weeks, suggesting that the juvenile zebrafish lens contained undetectable levels of high molecular weight protein aggregates.

By six months of age, a significant high molecular weight peak (9.01 ml) was observed (Figure 1). The broad alpha-crystallin (10.01 ml) and beta-crystallin (10.73 ml) peaks remained well defined. The gamma-crystallin peak observed at 11.62 ml appeared smaller than the corresponding peak in the six-week profile, and two new, smaller molecular weight gamma-crystallin peaks (12.18 and 12.43 ml) were present. These peaks could represent the expression of different gamma-crystallin proteins in the adult zebrafish lens or truncation products, which had not yet aggregated. When the 2.5-year-old, aged lens homogenate was separated using SEC, a high molecular weight peak (8.96 ml) was observed, although the 2.5-year-old lenses remained completely transparent by slit-lamp examination (Figure 2) and microscopy after removal (not shown).

alpha-Crystallin proteins increased in abundance during maturation and aging (Table 2), similar to the SEC results. alpha-A-crystallin was the 28th most abundant protein at both 4.5 days and three weeks and increased to become the most abundant protein by six months. Neither alphaBa- nor alphaBb-crystallins were detected in the 4.5-day-old or three-week-old lenses while both were abundant in the six-month-old lenses.

beta-Crystallin proteins were frequently detected at all ages of lens examined (Table 2), consistent with SEC results. betaB1-crystallin was the most abundant protein at 4.5 days and three weeks, and betaA4-crystallin was the most abundant protein detected at six weeks. betaB3-crystallin was the second most abundant protein at six months (behind alphaA-crystallin). Five novel beta-crystallin proteins were detected in addition to the nine previously described beta-crystallins (Table 2, ). A phylogenetic analysis was conducted using the reported gene sequences for the six human beta-crystallin genes, the nine previously reported zebrafish beta-crystallin genes, and the five novel beta-crystallin-like genes detected by shotgun proteomics (Figure 3). The two previously named "betaA1c-crystallin predicted" and "betaA1-like-crystallin" aligned with the betaA-crystallin family genes, and these genes were re-titled betaA1c- and betaA1d-crystallins. Three novel proteins, zgc:171773, zgc:171636, and LOC553473, aligned closely with human and zebrafish betaB1-crystallin. These three novel proteins have been titled betaB1b-, betaB1c-, and betaB1d-crystallins. betaB1b- and betaB1c-crystallins were especially abundant in the juvenile zebrafish lens (Table 2).

Because so many different gamma-crystallins were observed in the zebrafish lens, few gamma-crystallins appeared in the top 10 most abundant proteins at any age. The exceptions to this were gammaMX-crystallin, which was abundant at all ages examined, gammaN2-crystallin, which was among the top five proteins in the larval and juvenile fish lens, and gammaS1-crystallin, which was the third most abundant protein in the six-month-old lenses (Table 3). Of the 24 gamma-crystallins described previously, only five were detected in the 4.5-day-old lens while 18 different gamma-crystallins were detected in the six-months-old lens. This result corresponded with the SEC data, which showed increasing gamma-crystallin abundance during aging. In addition to the 24 gamma-crystallins described previously, 13 novel gamma-crystallin family proteins were detected in the zebrafish lens (Table 3, ). A phylogenetic tree was constructed from the gene sequences of known and novel zebrafish gamma-crystallin proteins (Figure 4). One gene (zgc:153846) aligned with gammaM1-crystallin and was titled gammaM1b-crystallin. Two genes (zgc:110028 and 110021) aligned with gammaMX-crystallin and were titled gammaMXb- and gammaMXc-crystallins. The remaining 10 novel gamma-crystallins all aligned with the gammaM2-crystallin family and were named accordingly, gammaM2d9-16-, gammaM2e-, and gammaM2f-crystallin. The genes of 30 out of the 36 gamma-crystallins detected in addition to five other gamma-crystallin-like genes that were not detected were all located on chromosome 9 (Figure 5).

The lens specific proteins, major intrinsic protein of the lens (Mip) 1 and Mip2, were detected at all ages studied. Mip2 was more abundant than Mip1 in the younger lenses while Mip1 abundance increased in the adult zebrafish lens. Three proteins known to be expressed in the zebrafish lens, Grifin, lengsin, and Scinla [33-35], were not detected in the 4.5-day-old larval lens and increased in abundance during maturation and aging. Two proteins associated with human familial Alzheimer disease were constitutively expressed at all ages, thimet oligopeptidase 1 and valosin-containing protein [36-39]. Several housekeeping proteins were detected at all ages examined, confirming that the shotgun proteomics method is a sensitive and effective method of protein detection and analysis.

Ribosomal proteins comprised 37% (39/106) of the total proteins detected in the 4.5-day-old lens (). At three weeks, 26% (29/112) of the total proteins were ribosomal (), and at six weeks, ribosomal proteins decreased to 11% (15/136; ). At six months, ribosomal proteins comprised only 8% (18/234) of the total detectable lens proteins (). The decreasing abundance of ribosomal proteins may correlate with decreasing translation of new lens proteins with age and may also protect lens cells against deleterious effects of aging.

The earliest report of zebrafish alphaA-crystallin transcripts was in the 24 hours post-fertilization (hpf) lens [40,41], and the alphaA-crystallin promoter was shown to drive lens expression of a green fluorescent protein (GFP) transgene starting at 25 hpf [15]. Neither alphaBa- nor alphaBb-crystallin transcripts were detected up to 48 hpf in whole zebrafish [40,41], although an alphaBa-crystallin polyclonal antibody was reported to stain the lens, retina, and brain at 24, 48, and 72 hpf [42] so the onset of alphaB-crystallin expression remains to be clarified. alphaB-crystallin transcripts were easily detected in the adult zebrafish lens [16,17]. In the 4.5 days post-fertilization (dpf) larval lens, the alphaA- but not alphaB-crystallin was detected and increased in both the alpha-crystallin peak fraction and the high molecular weight fraction during maturation and aging. alpha-Crystallins are vital for the development and maintenance of lens transparency and protect against protein unfolding and aggregation that lead to lens opacity [4-6,8,43]. The presence of all three alpha-crystallins plus gamma-crystallins in the high molecular weight peak fraction at six months (Table 1) was expected because alpha-crystallin acts as a molecular chaperone to prevent gamma-crystallin aggregation during aging [17,22,44,45]. While the current study reported alpha-crystallin to be as high as 22%, a previous study reported that alpha-crystallin comprised only 7.8% of the total zebrafish lens protein [19]. The difference may be related to the age of the fish in which alpha-crystallin content was measured. The 2.5-year-old zebrafish lenses examined in this study were completely transparent so it would be surprising if the adult zebrafish lens contained less than 10% of alpha-crystallin. Rodents, which have a similar life-span to zebrafish, have about 21.5% of alpha-crystallin in their lenses at six weeks [46], which is very similar to our observation that alpha-crystallins comprised 22% of total protein in the six-week-old zebrafish lens. The total amount of alpha-crystallin combined with its dramatic increase during lens maturation is consistent with the importance of alpha-crystallin in its protection against lens opacification during aging [4,8,47].

betaB1-crystallin was the most abundant protein in the zebrafish lens at both 4.5 days and three weeks. Size exclusion chromatography results demonstrated that total beta-crystallin content was much higher than alpha- or gamma-crystallin in the larval zebrafish lens. betaB1-crystallin transcripts were first detected in the zebrafish lens at 20 hpf, making it the earliest reported zebrafish lens crystallin [18]. In contrast to the zebrafish, betaB1-crystallin is negligible in the embryonic mouse lens and sharply upregulates at birth, becoming the most abundant beta-crystallin in the mouse by six weeks of age [48]. Analysis of rodent lenses during maturation detected a high percentage of gamma-crystallin in the newborn lens with increasing alpha- and beta-crystallins over the next few weeks [46,49]. gamma-Crystallins were dominant in the embryonic dogfish lens [50]. Finally, newborn human lenses contain 35% alpha-crystallin, 40% beta-crystallin, and 25% gamma-crystallin [51]. While there are similarities in protein content of vertebrate lenses, there are differences in the timing of the expression of alpha-, beta-, and gamma-crystallins.

This study identified novel zebrafish crystallins. Eight "embryonic" gamma-crystallins, gammaM2d1- through gammaM2d8-crystallin, were identified in normal 2 dpf embryonic lenses, which had not been previously detected in the adult lens [22]. In the 4.5 dpf larval lens, we detected only two of these proteins, gammaM2d7- and gammaM2d8-crystallin, as well as six other novel gammaM2d-crystallin-family members. All but two of the "embryonic" gamma-crystallins, gammaM2d3- and gammaM2d4-crystallin, were detected in at least one of the time points measured in addition to eight novel gammaM2d-crystallin-family members, gammaM2d9- through gammaM2d16-crystallin. Because none of the gamma-crystallins were abundant in the six-month old lens and many of them were abundant in the six-week-old lenses, it would be most accurate to refer to gammaM2d1- through gammaM2d16-crystallin as embryonic and juvenile crystallins. Genes for all of these crystallins were found on chromosome 9. In contrast, the four gammaS-crystallins were abundant in the six-month-old lenses and rarely found in younger lenses so these could be considered adult crystallins. The more divergent gammaN1-, gammaN2-, and gammaMX-crystallins had a more stable expression pattern and were moderately abundant at all ages examined. Even though zebrafish are known to have frequent gene duplications like alphaBa- and alphaBb-crystallins, 36+ gamma-crystallins were a surprisingly large number, and a large percentage of these genes were found to be on chromosome 9 within a 400 kilobase-pair sized region of the gene (0.74% of the total chromosome 9 length; Figure 4). The functional purpose for so many gamma-crystallin proteins in the zebrafish lens remains to be determined, especially because the non-refractive role of gamma-crystallin is poorly understood.

The total number of ribosomal subunit proteins detected in the lens decreased dramatically during lens maturation, which would be expected due to the large decrease in the need to translate new proteins over time. The observed decrease in ribosomal proteins may also serve to protect the lens from aging as decreases in expression of the 60S ribosomal subunit has been correlated with increased cell survival [52-54].

The development and maintenance of lens transparency is especially important for zebrafish, which are visual hunters. In contrast, mice rely on other senses for obtaining food. The optical and biochemical similarities with the human lens and the experimental advantages of external lens development make the zebrafish a valuable model for studies of the lens during eye development and aging, which are currently conducted in several prominent zebrafish laboratories [19,20,55-58]. The results reported in the current study detail crystallin protein expression throughout zebrafish lens maturation and aging and provide a foundation for future systematic studies of the functional importance of crystallins in the development and maintenance of lens transparency and refraction in the vertebrate lens.
