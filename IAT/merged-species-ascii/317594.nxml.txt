We have determined the complete nucleotide sequence of RNA1 of the tobravirus pea early browning virus [PEBV] from an overlapping series of cDNA clones. The 7073 nucleotide sequence contains four open reading frames [ORFs]. The 5' proximal ORF encodes a 141K polypeptide, and readthrough of the opal [UGA] termination codon of this ORF would lead to the synthesis of a second, 201K polypeptide. Both of these polypeptides have extensive amino acid homology with the putative replicase proteins of tobacco rattle virus [TRV] and tobacco mosaic virus [TMV]. The third ORF encodes a 30K polypeptide which has homology with the TRV 29K and TMV 30K putative cell-to-cell spread proteins. The fourth, 3' proximal ORF encodes a 12K polypeptide which has extensive homology with the TRV 16K protein whose function is unknown. Examination of the amino acid sequences of the 12K and 16K gene products reveals in each the presence of two multiple-cysteine/histidine motifs, a finding which suggests that these proteins might have zinc and/or nucleic acid-binding properties.
