Ochre suppressor tRNA was partially purified from strains of Saccharomyces cerevisiae containing the serine-inserting class III suppressor SUQ5-ol. RNA sequence analysis of this tRNA indicated that the suppressor is derived from a UCA-decoding tRNA Ser by a G leads to U substitution in the middle position of the anticodon. The suppressor further differs from the wild-type UCA-decoding tRNA Ser in that the mutant anticodon lacks the modified uridine found in the wobble position of the wild-type tRNA and contains instead another modification in or near the anticodon.
