A full-length cDNA clone of alfalfa mosaic virus (AMV) RNA3 was prepared and sequenced. The 2,037 base sequence contains two open reading frames of 903 and 666 nucleotides that code for a 32,400 dalton protein (32.4K protein) and the 24,380 dalton coat protein, respectively. A 5'-noncoding sequence of 240 bases preceeding the 32.4K protein contains homologous regions that may have a function in its translation. The intercistronic junction is 49 bases long, the last 36 bases representing the 5'-end of the subgenomic RNA4. The remaining 179 bases comprise the 3'-terminal noncoding sequence.
