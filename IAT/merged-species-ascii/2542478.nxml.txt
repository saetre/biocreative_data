Receptor protein tyrosine phosphatase alpha (RPTPalpha) phosphatase activity is required for intracellular signaling cascades that are activated in motile cells and growing neurites. Little is known, however, about mechanisms that coordinate RPTPalpha activity with cell behavior. We show that clustering of neural cell adhesion molecule (NCAM) at the cell surface is coupled to an increase in serine phosphorylation and phosphatase activity of RPTPalpha. NCAM associates with T- and L-type voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels, and NCAM clustering at the cell surface results in Ca2+ influx via these channels and activation of NCAM-associated calmodulin-dependent protein kinase IIalpha (CaMKIIalpha). Clustering of NCAM promotes its redistribution to lipid rafts and the formation of a NCAM-RPTPalpha-CaMKIIalpha complex, resulting in serine phosphorylation of RPTPalpha by CaMKIIalpha. Overexpression of RPTPalpha with mutated Ser180 and Ser204 interferes with NCAM-induced neurite outgrowth, which indicates that neurite extension depends on NCAM-induced up-regulation of RPTPalpha activity. Thus, we reveal a novel function for a cell adhesion molecule in coordination of cell behavior with intracellular phosphatase activity.

Cell interactions in the nervous system depend on multiple cues acting sequentially or in parallel. Adhesion molecules initiate recognition of the extracellular matrix and other cells, and, as transmembrane receptors, activate intracellular signaling cascades fundamental to all aspects of cell behavior. This line of communication is important not only during ontogenetic development but also in the adult nervous system during functional changes, such as learning, memory, and regeneration after traumatic injury. The neural cell adhesion molecule (NCAM) has been recognized as an important mediator of cell interactions via its extracellular domain, which consists of immunoglobulin-like and fibronectin type III-homologous structures that act as ligand and receptors in homophilic and heterophilic cell interactions. Two of the major isoforms of NCAM with molecular masses of 180 kD (NCAM180) and 140 kD (NCAM140) are transmembrane glycoproteins that trigger signaling cascades in the cell interior when clustered either by their natural ligands or by antibodies (Schuch et al., 1989; for review see Maness and Schachner, 2007). Signaling cascades triggered by NCAM have been implicated in neurite outgrowth, neuronal survival, and synaptic plasticity (Rutishauser et al., 1988; Luthi et al., 1994; Bukalo et al., 2004; Walmod et al., 2004).

The most well-described intracellular signaling pathways activated by NCAM to induce neurite outgrowth and neuronal differentiation include activation of PKC with subsequent NCAM-dependent redistribution of the enzyme to cholesterol-enriched plasma membrane microdomains, so-called lipid rafts, where PKC activates GAP43 (Leshchyns'ka et al., 2003; Korshunova et al., 2007). Association of PKC with NCAM depends on the FGF receptor (Leshchyns'ka et al., 2003), which associates with NCAM and is activated in response to NCAM clustering at the cell surface (Niethammer et al., 2002; Kiselyov et al., 2005).

Another pathway includes activation of p59fyn (hereafter referred to as fyn)/FAK (Beggs et al., 1994, 1997) being induced in response to NCAM clustering or via binding of the glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) to NCAM (Paratcha et al., 2003). Activation of this pathway depends on NCAM's association with glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored proteins, such as prion protein (Santuccione et al., 2005) and GFRalpha1, a cognate receptor for GDNF (Paratcha et al., 2003), and palmitoylation of the intracellular domain of NCAM (Niethammer et al., 2002), linking NCAM to p59fyn enriched in lipid rafts. We have previously found that this pathway is induced by NCAM140, which associates with the receptor protein tyrosine phosphatase alpha (RPTPalpha) by direct interaction (Bodrikov et al., 2005). When NCAM is clustered at the neuronal cell surface, the NCAM140-RPTPalpha complex is further stabilized by the membrane-cytoskeleton linker protein spectrin and redistributes to lipid rafts, where RPTPalpha binds to and activates fyn (Bodrikov et al., 2005).

We now present evidence that clustering of NCAM at the cell surface results in an enhancement of serine phosphorylation and phosphatase activity of RPTPalpha. By investigating the mechanisms of NCAM-dependent RPTPalpha activation, we found that PKCdelta, which had been shown in other studies to mediate activation of RPTPalpha (Brandt et al., 2003), is not involved in NCAM-induced activation. Instead, we identified calmodulin (CaM)-dependent protein kinase IIalpha (CaMKIIalpha) as a previously unrecognized enzyme to bind to and phosphorylate RPTPalpha at two serine residues that increase the phosphatase activity of RPTPalpha. We show that clustering of NCAM at the cell surface induces lipid raft-dependent activation of CaMKIIalpha, which then phosphorylates RPTPalpha at the two serine residues, which, in turn, leads to activation of fyn. Overexpression of RPTPalpha mutated in both serine residues interferes with NCAM-induced neurite outgrowth of hippocampal neurons in vitro. These observations attribute an important role in the trifunctional interaction between NCAM, CaMKIIalpha, and RPTPalpha in lipid rafts and thus add a new dimension in NCAM-mediated signaling pathways.

To analyze the role of NCAM in regulation of the phosphatase activity of RPTPalpha, RPTPalpha was immunoprecipitated from NCAM+/+ and NCAM-/- brain lysates. We then used two commercially available phosphotyrosine-containing peptides derived from the epidermal growth factor receptor, which serve as substrates for many protein tyrosine phosphatases, and estimated the efficiency of the release of phosphate from these peptides in the presence of RPTPalpha immunoprecipitates. This analysis showed that the phosphatase activity of RPTPalpha from NCAM-/- brains was reduced by approximately55% when compared with RPTPalpha from NCAM+/+ brains (Fig. 1 A).

NCAM140 clustering induces phosphorylation of RPTPalpha on Ser180 and Ser204 and enhances the phosphatase activity of RPTPalpha. (A) Graph shows phosphatase activity of RPTPalpha from NCAM+/+ and NCAM-/- brain lysates. (B-D) RPTPalpha immunoprecipitates were probed by Western blotting with antibodies against RPTPalpha and phospho serines (B and C) or subjected to serine phosphorylation estimation by the alkaline hydrolysis (D). Note that similar levels of RPTPalpha were immunoprecipitated from NCAM+/+ and NCAM-/- brain lysates (B). Mock immunoprecipitation with nonspecific IgG served as a control. Phosphatase activity and serine phosphorylation of RPTPalpha are reduced in NCAM-/- brains. Graph in C shows quantitation of the blots in B with optical density for NCAM+/+ brains set to 100%. In A and D, mean values of phosphatase activity (A) or phosphate released by alkaline (D) in RPTPalpha immunoprecipitates from NCAM+/+ brains were set to 100%. (E) RPTPalpha-negative fibroblasts transfected with RPTPalphaWT alone or cotransfected with NCAM140 and RPTPalphaWT, RPTPalphaS180A, RPTPalphaS204A, or RPTPalphaS180/204A were treated with NCAM polyclonal antibodies or nonspecific rabbit IgG. Note that similar levels of NCAM140 were expressed in cells (lysates) and that similar levels of RPTPalpha were immunoprecipitated from the lysates (IP: HA-tag). Mutation of Ser180 and/or Ser204 does not influence coimmunoprecipitation of NCAM140 with RPTPalpha. Immunoprecipitated RPTPalpha was then subjected to the serine phosphorylation estimation by the alkaline hydrolysis (top) and phosphatase activity analysis (bottom). Application of NCAM antibodies but not IgG increased serine phosphorylation and phosphatase activity of RPTPalphaWT in NCAM140-RPTPalphaWT-cotransfected cells. Phosphorylation and activation of RPTPalpha mutants were inhibited. Mean values of phosphate released by alkaline (top) or phosphatase activity (bottom) in RPTPalpha immunoprecipitates from IgG-treated NCAM140-RPTPalphaWT-cotransfected cells were set to 100%. Mean values +/- SEM are shown (A and D, n >/= 8; C, n = 6; E, n >/= 6). *, P < 0.05 (paired t test).

Because the phosphatase activity of RPTPalpha is regulated by phosphorylation, we analyzed phosphorylation of RPTPalpha by probing RPTPalpha immunoprecipitates with antibodies against phosphorylated serine residues by Western blotting. In addition, we estimated levels of phosphate released from serine residues of the immunoprecipitated RPTPalpha by alkaline treatment. Both methods showed that serine phosphorylation of RPTPalpha was reduced in NCAM-/- brains by approximately60% (Fig. 1, B-D).

Phosphorylation of Ser180 and Ser204 within RPTPalpha intracellular domain has been shown to be critical for the induction of RPTPalpha phosphatase activity (Stetak et al., 2001; Zheng et al., 2002). To analyze the role of Ser180 and Ser204 in NCAM-mediated RPTPalpha regulation, an HA tag containing wild-type RPTPalpha (RPTPalphaWT) and RPTPalpha mutants with Ser180 (RPTPalphaS180A), Ser204 (RPTPalphaS204A), or both (RPTPalphaS180/204A) substituted with alanine were coexpressed with NCAM140 in RPTPalpha-deficient fibroblasts. Similar levels of NCAM140 coimmunoprecipitated with RPTPalphaWT and RPTPalpha mutants from lysates of transfected cells (Fig. 1 E). Thus, mutation of Ser180 and Ser204 does not affect the binding of RPTPalpha to NCAM. Clustering of NCAM140 at the surface of fibroblasts by NCAM antibodies increased levels of serine phosphorylation of RPTPalphaWT by approximately200% (Fig. 1 E). In contrast, phosphorylation of RPTPalphaS180A and RPTPalphaS180/204A in response to NCAM140 clustering was blocked, whereas phosphorylation of RPTPalphaS204A was partially inhibited (Fig. 1 E). Hence, Ser180 and Ser204 are phosphorylated in response to NCAM140 clustering, with Ser180 being required for NCAM-dependent RPTPalpha phosphorylation.

Phosphatase activity of RPTPalphaWT was increased after NCAM140 clustering by approximately250% (Fig. 1 E). Phosphatase activity of RPTPalpha mutants, however, was reduced when compared with RPTPalphaWT. Mutation of Ser180 induced a stronger inhibitory effect on the catalytic activity of RPTPalpha when compared with Ser204 (Fig. 1 E). The catalytic activity of RPTPalpha was fully inhibited when both Ser180 and Ser204 were mutated (Fig. 1 E). In contrast to fibroblasts transfected with NCAM140, application of NCAM antibodies to the fibroblasts cotransfected with RPTPalphaWT and NCAM180 or NCAM120 did not result in phosphorylation and activation of RPTPalphaWT (Fig. S1, available at ). Hence, NCAM140 is the major NCAM isoform involved in regulation of RPTPalpha activity.

Previous studies indicated that among all PKC isoforms, only PKCdelta phosphorylates RPTPalpha on Ser180 and Ser204 in nonneuronal cells (den Hertog et al., 1995; Tracy et al., 1995; Zheng et al., 2002; Brandt et al., 2003). NCAM associates with and induces activation of several PKC isoforms (Leshchyns'ka et al., 2003; Kolkova et al., 2005), but its role in PKCdelta activation has not been analyzed. We thus analyzed whether NCAM regulates RPTPalpha phosphorylation by inducing PKCdelta activation. RPTPalpha coimmunoprecipitated with PKCdelta (Fig. 2 A), and PKCdelta coimmunoprecipitated with NCAM (Fig. 2 B) from brain lysates. However, levels of activated PKCdelta phosphorylated at Thr505 in the activation loop of the kinase were not changed in NCAM-/- brain homogenates (Fig. 2 C). Furthermore, similar levels of activated PKCdelta coimmunoprecipitated with RPTPalpha from NCAM+/+ and NCAM-/- brain lysates (Fig. 2 D). Thus, NCAM does not regulate association of RPTPalpha with PKCdelta, nor does it regulate PKCdelta activation in the brain. In agreement, the most prominent NCAM isoform that coimmunoprecipitated with PKCdelta was the smallest GPI-linked NCAM isoform with a molecular mass of 120 kD (NCAM120; Fig. 2 A). NCAM120 lacks the intracellular domain and therefore probably associates indirectly with PKCdelta, as has been shown for spectrin, another intracellular binding partner of NCAM120 that associates with NCAM120 via lipids (Leshchyns'ka et al., 2003).

CaMKIIalpha is another serine/threonine protein kinase that associates with NCAM (Sytnyk et al., 2006). CaMKIIalpha coimmunoprecipitated with RPTPalpha from brain lysates (Fig. 3 A). Interestingly, binding of CaMKIIalpha to RPTPalpha was reduced in NCAM-/- brains (Fig. 3 A). Levels of activated Thr286-phosphorylated CaMKIIalpha were also reduced in NCAM-/- brains (Fig. 3 B). Hence, NCAM regulates CaMKIIalpha activation and RPTPalpha-CaMKIIalpha complex formation.

(A) RPTPalpha immunoprecipitates (IP) from NCAM+/+ and NCAM-/- brain lysates were probed by Western blotting with antibodies against CaMKIIalpha. Note that similar levels of RPTPalpha were immunoprecipitated. Mock immunoprecipitation with nonspecific IgG served as control. Coimmunoprecipitation of CaMKIIalpha with RPTPalpha is reduced in NCAM-/- brain lysates. (B) NCAM+/+ and NCAM-/- brain homogenates were probed by Western blotting with antibodies against total and active Thr286-phosphorylated CaMKIIalpha and GAPDH (loading control). The levels of active CaMKIIalpha were reduced in NCAM-/- brain homogenates. Graphs show quantitation of the blots (mean +/- SEM, n = 6 for A and B) with optical density for NCAM+/+ probes set to 100%. *, P < 0.05, paired t test. (C) NCAM was clustered at the cell surface of cultured hippocampal neurons by NCAM antibodies (H28live). Neurons were then fixed and colabeled with antibodies against RPTPalpha and CaMKIIalpha. A high-magnification image of a neurite is shown. NCAM clusters overlap with accumulations of RPTPalpha and CaMKIIalpha (arrows). Bar, 5 mum. (D) CaMKIIalpha immunoprecipitates from NCAM+/+ and NCAM-/- brain lysates were probed by Western blotting with antibodies against NCAM. NCAM140 and NCAM180 coimmunoprecipitated with CaMKIIalpha. Mock immunoprecipitation with nonspecific IgG served as a control.

In agreement, in cultured hippocampal neurons maintained in vitro for 24 h, CaMKIIalpha accumulated in growth cones of the growing neurites, where distributions of CaMKIIalpha and NCAM partially overlapped (see Fig. 7 B). Clustering of NCAM at the cell surface of neurites with NCAM antibodies applied to live neurons induced partial redistribution of RPTPalpha to NCAM clusters (Fig. 3 C; Bodrikov et al., 2005). Overlapping accumulations of NCAM and RPTPalpha also colocalized with CaMKIIalpha aggregates (Fig. 3 C). Thus, CaMKIIalpha is a likely candidate involved in NCAM140-induced RPTPalpha phosphorylation accompanying NCAM clustering.

In agreement with this idea, NCAM140 coimmunoprecipitated with CaMKIIalpha from brain lysates (Fig. 3 D). NCAM180 also coimmunoprecipitated with CaMKIIalpha (Fig. 3 D), in accordance with our previously published data (Sytnyk et al., 2006). It is interesting in this respect that clustering of NCAM140 induced activation of both CaMKIIalpha and RPTPalpha (Figs. 1 and S2, available at ), whereas clustering of NCAM180 induced activation of CaMKIIalpha but not RPTPalpha (Figs. S1 and S2). The intracellular domain of NCAM140 binds to the intracellular domain of RPTPalpha with higher affinity than the intracellular domain of NCAM180 in in vitro binding assays (Bodrikov et al., 2005). Furthermore, only NCAM140 but not NCAM180 associates with RPTPalpha in transfected CHO cells (Bodrikov et al., 2005). Collectively, previous observations and our new data suggest that the tight association of NCAM140 with RPTPalpha is required for CaMKIIalpha-mediated serine phosphorylation of RPTPalpha.

To directly analyze the CaMKIIalpha-mediated serine phosphorylation of RPTPalpha, recombinant intracellular domains of RPTPalpha (RPTPalpha-ID) were used in an in vitro phosphorylation assay: incubation of RPTPalpha-ID with recombinant CaMKIIalpha resulted in a pronounced increase in serine phosphorylation and phosphatase activity of RPTPalpha-ID (Fig. 4 A).

RPTPalpha is phosphorylated by CaMKIIalpha on Ser180 and Ser204. (A) Recombinant RPTPalpha-ID-GST or GST coupled to beads were incubated with CaMKIIalpha. The gel stained with Coomassie blue shows that approximately equal amounts of RPTPalpha-ID-GST and GST were bound to beads. The beads, treated and nontreated with CaMKIIalpha, were then subjected to the analysis of serine phosphorylation by alkaline hydrolysis (bottom left) or phosphatase activity (bottom right).

Next, we verified whether CaMKIIalpha also phosphorylates endogenous full-length RPTPalpha, which was immunopurified from NCAM-/- brain lysates to assure that serine phosphorylation of RPTPalpha was not saturated. Incubation of RPTPalpha with recombinant CaMKIIalpha resulted in RPTPalpha phosphorylation (Fig. 4 B). Similarly, RPTPalpha was phosphorylated by CaMKIIalpha immunopurified from rat brain and used instead of recombinant CaMKIIalpha (unpublished data). Bisindolylmaleimide I (BisI), an inhibitor of PKC isozymes, among them PKCdelta, had no effect on RPTPalpha phosphorylation in these experiments (Fig. 4 B), which excluded the possibility that RPTPalpha was phosphorylated by PKCdelta copurified with RPTPalpha from brain lysates. Phosphorylation of RPTPalpha by recombinant CaMKIIalpha was blocked in the presence of KN62, an inhibitor of CaMKIIalpha (Fig. 4 B).

To analyze the sites of CaMKIIalpha-mediated phosphorylation, RPTPalphaWT and RPTPalphaS180A, RPTPalphaS204A, and RPTPalphaS180/204A mutants were transfected into RPTPalpha-negative fibroblasts. Transfected proteins were then immunoisolated from cell lysates and incubated with recombinant CaMKIIalpha. Incubation with CaMKIIalpha resulted in an approximately sixfold increase in serine phosphorylation of RPTPalphaWT, whereas CaMKIIalpha-mediated serine phosphorylation of RPTPalphaS180A and RPTPalphaS204A was reduced and serine phosphorylation of RPTPalphaS180/204A was fully blocked (Fig. 4 C). The levels of serine phosphorylation of RPTPalpha induced by CaMKIIalpha correlated with the levels of RPTPalpha phosphatase activity after incubation with CaMKIIalpha: the highest increase in the phosphatase activity was observed for RPTPalphaWT, being lower for RPTPalphaS180A and RPTPalphaS204A, whereas it was not detectable for RPTPalphaS180/204A (Fig. 4 C). Interestingly, mutation of Ser180 had a more profound effect on CaMKIIalpha-induced serine phosphorylation and phosphatase activity of RPTPalpha than the Ser204 mutation (Fig. 4 C), which correlates with the effect of these mutations on NCAM-induced RPTPalpha phosphorylation (Fig. 1). We conclude that CaMKIIalpha phosphorylates RPTPalpha at Ser180 and Ser204.

To confirm that NCAM140-induced serine phosphorylation of RPTPalpha is mediated by CaMKIIalpha in live cells, CHO cells were cotransfected with NCAM140 and RPTPalphaWT and treated with NCAM antibodies in the absence or presence of the CaMKIIalpha inhibitor KN62. Application of NCAM antibodies strongly increased serine phosphorylation of RPTPalphaWT in transfected cells, as measured by Western blotting with phosphoserine-specific antibodies (Fig. 5 A). NCAM-dependent serine phosphorylation of RPTPalphaWT was inhibited by KN62 (Fig. 5 A), which indicates that CaMKIIalpha activation is required for NCAM-induced RPTPalpha phosphorylation.

Because RPTPalpha is the major phosphatase that induces fyn activation in NCAM-activated signaling (Bodrikov et al., 2005), we analyzed whether CaMKIIalpha activity is required for fyn activation in response to NCAM clustering at the cell surface. Application of NCAM antibodies to CHO cells cotransfected with NCAM140 and RPTPalphaWT increased levels of Tyr531-dephosphorylated and thus activated fyn in these cells, as measured by Western blot analysis (Fig. 5 B). NCAM-induced fyn activation was completely inhibited by KN62 (Fig. 5 B).

Similarly, KN62 inhibited fyn activation in response to application of NCAM antibodies or NCAM-Fc to cultured neurons as shown by immunofluorescence labeling or Western blot analysis of active fyn with antibodies specific for Tyr531-dephosphorylated or Tyr416-autophosphorylated fyn (Fig. 5, C-F). The PKCdelta inhibitor BisI had no effect on NCAM-induced fyn activation (Fig. 5 F). Thus, we conclude that CaMKIIalpha activity is required for NCAM-induced RPTPalpha-mediated fyn activation.

Clustering of NCAM140 and NCAM180 induces their redistribution to lipid rafts (Niethammer et al., 2002; Leshchyns'ka et al., 2003; Bodrikov et al., 2005; Santuccione et al., 2005). Therefore, we analyzed whether lipid rafts play a role in NCAM-induced CaMKIIalpha activation. In cultured hippocampal neurons extracted with cold 1% Triton X-100 and colabeled with antibodies against Thr286-phosphorylated CaMKIIalpha and the lipid raft marker PI(4,5)P2 (Niethammer et al., 2002), accumulations of activated CaMKIIalpha partially overlapped with the clusters of PI(4,5)P2 (Fig. 6 A), which indicates that cytoskeleton- and/or lipid raft-associated detergent-insoluble pools of CaMKIIalpha were present in neurites. Clustering of NCAM at the cell surface with NCAM antibodies resulted in an approximately threefold increase in the levels of detergent-insoluble active CaMKIIalpha and a higher overlap in distribution of CaMKIIalpha and PI(4,5)P2 along neurites when compared with neurons treated with nonspecific immunoglobulins (Fig. 6 A). This observation suggests that activation of CaMKIIalpha in response to NCAM clustering occurs in lipid rafts.

In agreement, Western blot analysis of the cytosolic, total membrane, and lipid raft fractions isolated from the brain tissue of young mice showed that activated CaMKIIalpha accumulated in lipid rafts (Fig. 6 B). In contrast, total CaMKIIalpha protein was broadly distributed in all fractions (Fig. 6 B). Importantly, levels of activated CaMKIIalpha but not total CaMKIIalpha protein, fyn, or glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) were reduced in the cytosolic fraction and lipid rafts from NCAM-/- versus NCAM+/+ brains (Figs. 6 B and S3, available at ), which indicates that NCAM is implicated in the activation of CaMKIIalpha that accumulates in lipid rafts and/or redistributes to the soluble pool.

To analyze whether redistribution of NCAM to lipid rafts is required for CaMKIIalpha activation and RPTPalpha phosphorylation, CHO cells were cotransfected with RPTPalphaWT and NCAM140 or NCAM140DeltaCys, an NCAM140 mutant with inactivated palmitoylation sites within its intracellular domain that blocks its association with lipid rafts (Niethammer et al., 2002). Application of NCAM antibodies to NCAM140-transfected cells resulted in a pronounced increase in the levels of activated CaMKIIalpha and serine phosphorylation of RPTPalphaWT in these cells (Fig. 6, C and D). Although expression levels of NCAM140DeltaCys were similar to those of NCAM140, application of NCAM antibodies did not influence levels of activated CaMKIIalpha and phosphorylated RPTPalphaWT in NCAM140DeltaCys-transfected cells nor in GFP-transfected cells used as a negative control (Fig. 6, C and D). NCAM140-dependent CaMKIIalpha activation and RPTPalpha phosphorylation and activation were also blocked in CHO cells treated with methyl-beta-cyclodextrin (Fig. S3), an agent that binds to cholesterol, thereby destroying the integrity of lipid rafts (Niethammer et al., 2002). Thus, association of NCAM with lipid rafts is required for NCAM-dependent CaMKIIalpha activation and RPTPalpha phosphorylation.

CaMKIIalpha activation depends on an increase in cytosolic Ca2+ that binds to CaM. Binding of Ca2+-CaM to the regulatory domain of the kinase activates the kinase by releasing the catalytic domain from inhibition by autoregulatory sequences proximal to the CaM binding site. NCAM clustering at the cell surface has been shown to be accompanied by an increase in Ca2+ concentration in the cytosol, with the VDCC of the T and, to a lower extent, L type playing a major role in NCAM-dependent Ca2+ influx to the cell (Schuch et al., 1989; Kiryushko et al., 2006). T- and L-type VDCC were present at high levels in lipid rafts from brain tissue (Fig. 6 B), thus they are well poised to provide Ca2+ for CaMKIIalpha activation in response to NCAM redistribution to lipid rafts. Moreover, T- and L-type VDCC associated with NCAM in the brain, as shown by coimmunoprecipitation of these VDCC with NCAM from brain lysates (Fig. 7 A). Although L-type VDCC are known to accumulate in growth cones being involved in cytoskeleton rearrangements (Ohbayashi et al., 1998), much less is known about T-type VDCC. Colabeling of cultured hippocampal neurons with antibodies against NCAM, T-type VDCC, and CaMKIIalpha showed that all three proteins accumulated in growth cones and, in particular, growth cone filopodia (Fig. 7 B). When NCAM was clustered at the neuronal surface with NCAM antibodies, T-type VDCC and CaMKIIalpha accumulated in NCAM clusters along neurites (Fig. 7 C). Thus, we hypothesize that clustering of NCAM at the growth cones induces formation of the NCAM-T- and L-type VDCC-CaMKIIalpha complex, thereby linking CaMKIIalpha to the Ca2+ source.

Next, we verified the role of T- and L-type VDCC in NCAM-dependent CaMKIIalpha activation. In cultured hippocampal neurons, clustering of NCAM at the neuronal surface induced an approximately80% increase in the levels of activated Thr286-phosphorylated CaMKIIalpha along neurites, as shown by immunocytochemical analysis (Fig. 8 A). Pimozide, a T-type VDCC inhibitor, completely blocked this effect (Fig. 8 A). Nifedipine, an L-type VDCC inhibitor, also inhibited NCAM-dependent CaMKIIalpha activation, although with a slightly lower efficiency than pimozide (Fig. 8 A).

NCAM-induced CaMKIIalpha activation depends on Ca2+ influx via T- and L-type VDCC. (A) Cultured hippocampal neurons were incubated with pimozide and nifedipine, inhibitors of T-and L-type VDCC, respectively. Neurons were then stimulated with rat NCAM monoclonal antibodies (H28live) or nonspecific rat IgG, then fixed and colabeled with antibodies against activated Thr286-phosphorylated CaMKIIalpha. Representative images are shown. Note that clustering of NCAM without inhibitors induces an increase in active CaMKIIalpha levels along neurites and that active CaMKIIalpha accumulates in NCAM clusters. Pimozide and nifedipine inhibit CaMKIIalpha activation.

Similarly, pimozide and nifedipine inhibited NCAM-dependent CaMKIIalpha activation in cultured cortical neurons analyzed by Western blotting (Fig. 8 B). Importantly, pimozide and nifedipine also blocked NCAM-dependent dephosphorylation of fyn at Tyr531 (Fig. 8 B). Hence, we conclude that NCAM induces Ca2+ influx via T- and L-type VDCC for CaMKIIalpha activation, which results in up-regulation of the phosphatase activity of RPTPalpha and fyn dephosphorylation and activation.

In neurons exposed to NCAM-Fc in the culture medium (Fig. 9 A) or seeded on top of NCAM-transfected fibroblasts (Williams et al., 1995), the KN62 inhibitor of CaMKIIalpha abolished the NCAM-dependent increase in neurite outgrowth over the baseline level of nonstimulated neurons, which indicates that CaMKIIalpha activity is required for NCAM-mediated neurite outgrowth.

NCAM-induced phosphorylation of RPTPalpha on Ser180 and Ser204 is required for NCAM-mediated neurite outgrowth. (A) Cultured hippocampal neurons were treated with Fc or NCAM-Fc in the presence or absence of KN62. Graph shows mean lengths of neurites +/- SEM normalized to the mean neurite length in neurons treated with Fc in the absence of KN62 (n > 200).

To analyze whether CaMKIIalpha-dependent RPTPalpha phosphorylation on Ser180 and/or Ser204 is required for NCAM-mediated neurite outgrowth, cultured neurons were transfected with GFP or cotransfected with GFP and RPTPalphaWT or the RPTPalpha mutants RPTPalphaS180A, RPTPalphaS204A, or RPTPalphaS180/204A. These mutations within RPTPalpha did not affect binding of RPTPalpha to NCAM (Fig. 1). Hence, RPTPalpha mutants overexpressed in neurons should act in a dominant-negative fashion by substituting for endogenous RPTPalpha in the NCAM-RPTPalpha complex. Overexpression of RPTPalphaWT in neurons resulted in enhanced neurite outgrowth most likely caused by the nonspecific outgrowth-promoting activation of Src-family kinases by RPTPalphaWT (Fig. 9 B). Exposure of GFP-transfected neurons to NCAM-Fc applied in the culture medium increased neurite lengths by approximately100% when compared with Fc-treated GFP-transfected control neurons (Fig. 9 B). A similar, approximately100% increase in neurite length was observed for NCAM-Fc-versus Fc-treated RPTPalphaWT-transfected neurons (Fig. 9 B). However, neurites in NCAM-Fc-treated RPTPalphaWT-transfected neurons were approximately two times longer than in NCAM-Fc-treated GFP-transfected neurons, which indicates that RPTPalphaWT potentiates the response to NCAM-Fc (Fig. 9 B). RPTPalphaS180A and RPTPalphaS204A mutants showed a reduced ability to promote neurite outgrowth and to enhance responsiveness to NCAM-Fc when compared with RPTPalphaWT (Fig. 9 B). The RPTPalphaS180A mutant was strongly impaired in its ability to nonspecifically promote neurite outgrowth but did not completely block the response to NCAM-Fc. In contrast, the RPTPalphaS204A mutant strongly interfered with the response to NCAM-Fc but was still able to nonspecifically promote neurite outgrowth at a level that was not different from that of RPTPalphaWT. A plausible explanation for this observation is that Ser180 and Ser204 may play slightly distinct roles in the maintenance of the unregulated basal versus the NCAM-mediated, thus regulated, neurite outgrowth. A double mutant RPTPalphaS180/204 did not promote neurite outgrowth and totally blocked the NCAM-Fc-induced response (Fig. 9 B). Thus, we conclude that CaMKIIalpha-mediated phosphorylation of Ser180 and Ser204 within the RPTPalpha intracellular domain is required for NCAM-induced neurite outgrowth.

In this study, we have further explored the cascades of molecular interactions activated by the neural cell adhesion molecule NCAM; the molecular players in the functional interconnection had been previously implicated in NCAM-dependent neurite outgrowth. The tyrosine kinase fyn was the first to be identified as an NCAM-associated signaling partner that triggers the MAP kinase/FAK-related downstream signaling of NCAM, leading to activation of transcription factors, such as CREB (Beggs et al., 1997; Schmid et al., 1999; Jessen et al., 2001). The fyn pathway then became very important as a cosignaling pathway in NCAM-induced signaling, which needed to be activated in lipid rafts in parallel with the FGF receptor located outside of lipid rafts in order to trigger converging signaling cascades to enhance neurite outgrowth (Niethammer et al., 2002). Because the intracellular domain of NCAM does not contain sequences known to induce fyn activation, we previously investigated the relationship between NCAM and the well-known activator of Src-family tyrosine kinases, of which fyn is a member, the receptor protein tyrosine phosphatase RPTPalpha. RPTPalpha that dephosphorylates Tyr-531 of fyn to activate the enzyme (Bhandari et al., 1998) is highly enriched in neurons and growth cones (Helmke et al., 1998), where it colocalizes with NCAM (Bodrikov et al., 2005). We identified RPTPalpha as a direct binding partner of NCAM140, linking this NCAM isoform to fyn. Interestingly, the interaction between NCAM and RPTPalpha was enhanced by spectrin (Bodrikov et al., 2005), which also interacts directly with the intracellular domains of the transmembrane isoforms of NCAM, NCAM140, and, in particular, NCAM180 (Pollerberg et al., 1986, 1987; Sytnyk et al., 2002; Leshchyns'ka et al., 2003) and indirectly via lipid rafts with the GPI-anchored isoform NCAM120 (Leshchyns'ka et al., 2003).

In this study, we expand our previous findings by showing that clustering of NCAM at the cell surface enhances serine phosphorylation and phosphatase activity of RPTPalpha, thus identifying NCAM as the first recognition molecule and surface receptor that not only associates with but also regulates the catalytic activity of RPTPalpha. The catalytic phosphatase activity of RPTPalpha can be enhanced by PKC-mediated Ser180 and/or Ser204 phosphorylation of the intracellular domain of RPTPalpha (den Hertog et al., 1995; Tracy et al., 1995; Stetak et al., 2001; Zheng et al., 2002), with PKCdelta but not other PKC isoforms playing the major role in the phosphorylation of RPTPalpha on Ser180 and Ser204 (Brandt et al., 2003). However, we found that PKCdelta is not involved in NCAM-induced activation. In agreement with this notion is the observation that 2.5-10 muM of the PKCdelta inhibitor rottlerin did not inhibit RPTPalpha serine phosphorylation in nonstimulated NIH3T3 fibroblasts, and that very high concentrations of rottlerin (50 muM) only mildly affected RPTPalpha serine phosphorylation (unpublished data), which suggests that other enzymes are involved. Furthermore, we show that BisI, a PKCdelta inhibitor, does not block RPTPalpha-mediated fyn activation in response to NCAM clustering. Accordingly, we identified CaMKIIalpha as a previously unrecognized enzyme that binds to and phosphorylates RPTPalpha at serine residues Ser180 and Ser204, increasing the phosphatase activity of RPTPalpha. We also show that CaMKIIalpha, which associates with NCAM via spectrin (Sytnyk et al., 2006), is activated in response to clustering of NCAM at the cell surface. Calmodulin, which associates with RPTPalpha in the presence of Ca2+, may thus play a role in CaMKIIalpha activation (Liang et al., 2000). NCAM-induced CaMKIIalpha activation then leads to phosphorylation of RPTPalpha at Ser180 and Ser204, which, in turn, leads to activation of lipid raft-enriched fyn (Fig. 10).

A schematic model of molecular interactions induced by NCAM140 clustering and resulting in fyn activation. (A) Nonclustered NCAM140 resides outside of lipid rafts and does not associate with RPTPalpha, CaMKIIalpha (shown as a holoenzyme), and fyn, which are present in inactive forms in the plasma membrane outside of lipid rafts, in the cytosol and in lipid rafts, respectively. (B) NCAM140 clustering induces palmitoylation of the intracellular domain of NCAM140 that promotes NCAM140 redistribution to lipid rafts, where it binds to prion protein (PrP). In parallel, NCAM140 clustering induces FGFR activation, promoting arachidonic acid production (not depicted), which results in arachidonic acid-dependent Ca2+ influx (Williams et al., 1994) via T- and L-type VDCC. An increase in Ca2+ concentration promotes binding of Ca2+/CaM to CaMKIIalpha, releasing the catalytic domain of CaMKIIalpha from inhibition by autoregulatory sequences proximal to the CaM binding site (not depicted). By associating with T- and L-type VDCC, NCAM anchors CaMKIIalpha, which is bound to NCAM140 via spectrin, near the Ca2+ influx sites. NCAM-induced aggregation of CaMKIIalpha in lipid rafts promotes transautophosphorylation of the CaMKIIalpha holoenzymes at Thr286, resulting in the constitutive activation of CaMKIIalpha. (C) In parallel to CaMKIIalpha activation, NCAM140 promotes redistribution of RPTPalpha to lipid rafts. In lipid rafts, activated CaMKIIalpha (only one CaMKIIalpha molecule is shown for simplicity) phosphorylates RPTPalpha at Ser180 and Ser204, which changes the conformation of RPTPalpha, resulting in enzyme activation. (D) Activated RPTPalpha binds and dephosphorylates fyn at Tyr531, activating the enzyme. Downstream targets of active fyn include the Ras-MAP (MAP) kinase pathway, the sustained activity of which is required for neuronal differentiation (not depicted).

Overexpression of RPTPalpha in neurons enhances basal neurite outgrowth rates, probably by nonspecific activation of Src-family kinases. Indeed, overexpression of RPTPalpha in nonneuronal cells results in persistent activation of Src, with concomitant cell transformation and tumorigenesis (Zheng et al., 1992, 2000), and mutation of Ser180 or Ser204 blocks neoplastic transformation of cells by RPTPalpha (Zheng et al., 2002). This suggests that phosphorylation and activity of RPTPalpha are tightly regulated in normal cells. Homeostatic mechanisms that coordinate changes in RPTPalpha phosphatase activity are therefore intimately linked with the changes in cell behavior. It is thus not surprising that disturbance of the relationship of NCAM with RPTPalpha may link NCAM to tumorigenesis in different cell types that express NCAM (Cavallaro and Christofori, 2004a,b).

Our study again emphasizes the importance of lipid-enriched microdomains, the so-called lipid rafts. The fact that NCAM uses this signaling platform for fyn activation has previously been shown by ablating the palmitoylation sites in the intracellular domain of NCAM, which target the two major transmembrane isoforms of NCAM to lipid rafts (Niethammer et al., 2002). NCAM-dependent fyn activation was also reduced in prion protein-deficient mice, which correlates with reduced levels of NCAM in lipid rafts isolated from these mice and implicates prion protein as a lipid raft-recruiting signal for NCAM (Santuccione et al., 2005). In this study, we provide further details on the molecular interactions induced by NCAM in lipid rafts by showing that if the targeting of NCAM140 to lipid rafts is disturbed, NCAM-induced activation of CaMKIIalpha in lipid rafts and subsequent phosphorylation and activation of RPTPalpha, and thus of fyn, are reduced. Because aggregation and oligomerization of CaMKIIalpha is necessary for full activation of the enzyme (Hudmon et al., 2005), we propose that the special environment of lipid rafts promotes oligomerization of NCAM-associated CaMKIIalpha to induce its full activation (Fig. 10). In agreement, clustering of NCAM increases the levels of detergent-insoluble oligomerized CaMKIIalpha in cultured hippocampal neurons (Sytnyk et al., 2006). Association of NCAM with T- and L-type VDCC accumulating in lipid rafts should then bring CaMKIIalpha into the vicinity of the sites of Ca2+ influx into the cell (Fig. 10). Thus, our present study confirms the importance of lipid rafts in cell signaling for neurite outgrowth. The generation of such platforms during ontogenetic development appears to be crucial for neurite outgrowth. It will be interesting to determine whether such cell adhesion molecule-mediated platforms are required for synaptic plasticity in the adult brain, which requires functional and structural modifications of synaptic membranes and associated signaling mechanisms.

NCAM was clustered at the neuronal surface using NCAM-Fc, rat monoclonal (clone H28), or rabbit polyclonal antibodies against the extracellular domain of NCAM. Application of these three agents produced similar levels of fyn activation in cultured neurons and fibroblasts cotransfected with NCAM140 and RPTPalphaWT (Figs. 5 and S4, available at ). 8 mug/ml NCAM-Fc and 8 mug/ml of human Fc, or 10 mug/ml NCAM polyclonal antibodies and 10 mug/ml nonspecific rabbit IgG were applied to live neurons in the culture medium for 10 min in a CO2 incubator. Rat monoclonal antibodies H28 or 10 mug/ml nonimmune rat IgG were applied to live neurons for 15 min and clustered by secondary antibodies applied for 5 min, followed by washing for 5 min, all in a CO2 incubator. We have found that with this protocol, fyn and CaMKIIalpha were activated within 5 min after secondary antibody application, and levels of active fyn and CaMKIIalpha reached a plateau within 10 min after secondary antibody application (Fig. S5). When indicated, 10 muM of the CaMKIIalpha inhibitor KN62 (Merck & Co., Inc.) or 0.5 muM of the PKC inhibitor BisI was applied 1 h before stimulation with antibodies or NCAM-Fc. 10 muM nifedipine and 5 muM pimozide (both from Alomone Laboratories Ltd.) were applied for 10 min before stimulation.

Brain homogenates were prepared using a Potter homogenizer in HOMO buffer (1 mM MgCl2, 1 mM CaCl2, 1 mM NaHCO3, and 5 mM Tris, pH 7.4) containing 0.32 M sucrose (HOMO-A) and centrifuged at 700 g for 10 min at 4degreesC to pellet nuclei and mitochondria. The resulted supernatants were centrifuged at 100,000 g at 4degreesC for 30 min. Supernatants obtained after centrifugation were used as fractions enriched in cytosolic proteins, whereas pellets were used as total membrane fractions. Rafts were isolated from total membrane fractions as described previously (Leshchyns'ka et al., 2003). In brief, membranes were resuspended in ice-cold TBS, pH 7.5, and extracted for 20 min on ice with 4 volumes of 1% Triton X-100 in TBS. Extracted membranes were mixed with equal volume of 80% sucrose in 0.2 M sodium carbonate, overlaid sequentially with 30% sucrose in TBS, 10% sucrose in TBS, and TBS, and centrifuged at 230,000 g for 17 h at 4degreesC. The lipid raft fraction was collected at the interface between 10 and 30% sucrose, pelleted by centrifugation at 100,000 g for 1 h at 4degreesC, and resuspended in TBS. Total protein concentration was measured using the BC kit (Interchim).

Human Fc-tagged extracellular domain of mouse NCAM and GST-tagged intracellular domains of RPTPalpha were used as described previously (Chen et al., 1999; Bodrikov et al., 2005). Calmodulin-dependent protein kinase IIalpha (CaMKIIalpha) was obtained from New England Biolabs, Inc.

Recombinant CaMKIIalpha or CaMKIIalpha immunopurified from rat brain (BIOMOL International, L.P.) was activated according to the manufacturer's instructions. For analysis of the phosphorylation in vitro, proteins were immunoprecipitated from CHO cells, fibroblasts, or brain homogenates as described in the Immunoprecipitation and coimmunoprecipitation section. Mock immunoprecipitation with nonspecific IgG served as a control of immunoprecipitation specificity, and beads with immunoprecipitated nonspecific IgG obtained after mock immunoprecipitation were used as control in phosphorylation reactions. Beads were then washed twice with RIPA buffer, three times with TBS, and diluted in TBS. To analyze phosphorylation of recombinant RPTPalpha-ID, they were coupled to glutathione beads. Glutathione beads with GST coupled instead of RPTPalpha-ID were used as control. Beads were washed three times with TBS and diluted in TBS. Equal volumes of control beads or beads with proteins of interest were incubated for 30 min at 30degreesC in CaMKIIalpha reaction buffer (New England Biolabs, Inc.) supplemented with 200 muM ATP in the presence of activated CaMKIIalpha, then washed with TBS, centrifuged for 1 min, and used for Western blot analysis or protein phosphorylation estimation.

Serine/threonine phosphorylation was analyzed by the alkaline hydrolysis of phosphate from seryl and threonyl residues in phosphoproteins. Because mutations of Ser180 and Ser204 within RPTPalpha-ID completely inhibited serine/threonine phosphorylation of RPTPalpha, we refer to this method as to the analysis of serine phosphorylation of RPTPalpha throughout the text. In brief, beads containing phosphorylated and control proteins were treated with 1 N NaOH for 30 min at 65degreesC. The reaction was stopped by the addition of a similar volume of 3.1 N HCl, and released phosphate was measured using Malachite green phosphate detection kit (R&D Systems) according to manufacturer's instructions.

Control beads and beads with immunoprecipitated RPTPalpha were washed twice with RIPA buffer, three times with TBS, and diluted in TBS. Glutathione beads with GST or recombinant RPTPalpha-ID were washed and diluted in TBS. Phosphatase activity was measured using a nonradioactive phosphatase assay system (Promega) according to manufacturer's instructions.

Proteins were separated by 8% SDS-PAGE and electroblotted onto nitrocellulose transfer membrane (PROTRAN; Sigma-Aldrich) overnight at 5 mA. Immunoblots were blocked in milk and incubated with appropriate primary antibodies followed by incubation with peroxidase-labeled secondary antibodies and visualized using Super Signal West Pico reagents (Thermo Fisher Scientific) on BIOMAX film (Sigma-Aldrich). For immunoblots labeled with phospho-specific antibodies, 3% of BSA was used instead of milk. Molecular weight markers were prestained protein standards from Bio-Rad Laboratories. For quantitative comparisons of chemiluminescence between the lanes, the same amounts of total protein or equal amounts of immunoprecipitates were loaded in each lane. All preparations were performed three times and at least two Western blots were performed with an individual sample (n >/= 6). Values from all Western blots were used to calculate mean values and standard errors of the mean. The chemiluminescence quantification was performed using TINA 2.09 software (University of Manchester) or Scion Image for Windows (Scion Corporation). Group comparisons were made using a paired t test.

Fig. S1 shows the analysis of the Ser180 and Ser204 phosphorylation and phosphatase activity of RPTPalphaWT, expressed in RPTPalpha-negative fibroblasts alone or together with NCAM120 or NCAM180, after application of NCAM polyclonal antibodies or nonspecific rabbit IgG to transfected fibroblasts. Fig. S2 shows the analysis of the RPTPalphaWT phosphorylation and CaMKIIalpha, PKCdelta, and fyn activation in CHO cells that were cotransfected with RPTPalphaWT and NCAM120, NCAM140, NCAM180, or GFP and treated with NCAM antibodies or nonspecific rabbit IgG. Fig. S3 shows levels of activated CaMKIIalpha in lipid rafts from NCAM+/+ and NCAM-/- brains, and provides the analysis of the influence of lipid raft disruption by methyl-beta-cyclodextrin on CaMKIIalpha activation and RPTPalpha phosphorylation and activation in NCAM140-transfected CHO cells. Fig. S4 contains a comparison of the effects of NCAM clustering by polyclonal or monoclonal antibodies against the extracellular domain of NCAM or by NCAM-Fc on fyn activation in RPTPalpha-negative fibroblasts cotransfected with NCAM140 and RPTPalphaWT. Fig. S5 shows the time course of NCAM-dependent fyn and CaMKIIalpha activation in dissociated hippocampal neurons treated with NCAM monoclonal antibodies or nonspecific rat IgG.
