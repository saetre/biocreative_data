The murine Hmgi-c gene, a member of the Hmgi gene family, contains five exons encompassing >110 kb of genomic DNA at the pygmy locus on mouse chromosome 10. Northern analysis identified a 4.1 kb transcript which contains a 324 bp open reading frame encoding a 12 kDa HMGI-C protein. Further analysis defined both the 5' and 3' untranslated regions of the Hmgi-c mRNA species as 658 and 2967 bp respectively. The HMGI-C protein has three consecutive AT hook DNA binding domains and an acidic domain, each of which are encoded by individual exons; such an organization is conserved among the HMGI gene family members from insects to mammals. Similar to the HMGI/Y proteins, the HMGI-C protein does not function as a typical transcriptional activator. Developmental studies revealed that the Hmgi-c gene is expressed predominantly during mouse embryogenesis. Since the human homolog is disrupted in a number of tumors, HMGI-C could play an important role in cell proliferation and differentiation during mammalian development.
