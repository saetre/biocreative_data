The rearranged lambda 2 gene of the mouse plasmacytoma cell line MOPC315 has been cloned and sequenced. A comparison of its sequence with the sequence of the unrearranged (germ-line) V, J and C gene segments shows that the sequences of the V gene segments differ at six positions. The sequence of the J and C gene segments remained unchanged. These results add support to the hypothesis that somatic mutations occur in immunoglobulin in genes and that these mutations do not involve the C gene segment. The degree of homology of the elements of the lambda 2 gene with those of the lambda 1 gene and C lambda 3 and C lambda 4 gene fragments suggest a pathway of evolution by gene duplication of the immunoglobulin lambda light chain locus. According to this scheme the original structure V0-J0C0 gave rise to a structure V0-J1C1-J11C11 by duplication of the J0C0 region. A second duplication encompassing the whole region resulted in the present structure: V1-J3C3-J1C1/V2-J2C2-J4C4.
