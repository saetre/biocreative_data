In cancer, Transforming Growth Factor beta (TGFbeta) increases proliferation and promotes invasion via selective loss of signalling pathways. Oesophageal adenocarcinoma arises from Barrett's oesophagus, progresses rapidly and is usually fatal. The contribution of perturbed TGFbeta signalling in the promotion of metastasis in this disease has not been elucidated. We therefore investigated the role of TGFbeta in Barrett's associated oesophageal adenocarcinoma using a panel of cell lines (OE33, TE7, SEG, BIC, FLO). 4/5 adenocarcinoma cell lines failed to cell cycle arrest, down-regulate c-Myc or induce p21 in response to TGFbeta, and modulation of a Smad3/4 specific promoter was inhibited. These hyperproliferative adenocarcinoma cell lines displayed a TGFbeta induced increase in the expression of the extracellular matrix degrading proteinases, urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA) and plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 (PAI-1), which correlated with an invasive cell phenotype as measured by in vitro migration, invasion and cell scattering assays. Inhibiting ERK and JNK pathways significantly reduced PAI and uPA induction and inhibited the invasive cell phenotype. These results suggest that TGFbeta Smad-dependent signalling is perturbed in Barrett's carcinogenesis, resulting in failure of growth-arrest. However, TGFbeta can promote PAI and uPA expression and invasion through MAPK pathways. These data would support a dual role for TGFbeta in oesophageal adenocarcinoma.

Transforming Growth Factor beta (TGFbeta), and the components of its signal transduction pathway, are known to demonstrate tumour suppressor activity. In many human cancers, there are inactivating mutations in components of the TGFbeta pathway resulting in uncontrolled proliferation. In addition, through its actions on both the tumour cells and the surrounding stromal cells, TGFbeta can enhance invasion, motility and metastasis. TGFbeta can thus play a dual role in the initiation and malignant progression of human cancer [1], [2].

TGFbeta signalling occurs through activation of type I and II trans-membrane serine/threonine kinase receptors, which leads to the phosphorylation of Smad 2 and 3. This complex, in association with Smad 4 translocates to the nucleus resulting in transcriptional activation of downstream targets [3]. The anti-proliferative effects of TGFbeta in normal epithelial cells are achieved through the inactivation of cyclin dependent kinases (cdk) 2, 4 and 6, which lead to cell cycle arrest. This is mediated by the rapid induction of the cdk4/6 inhibitor p15INK4B, and the cdk2 inhibitor p21CIP1/WAF1. Another key event in TGFbeta mediated cell cycle arrest involves the repression of c-Myc. This transcription factor binds the promoters of p15INK4B and p21CIP1/WAF1 and suppresses their expression [4]. Rapid transcriptional down-regulation of c-Myc by TGFbeta relieves this repression, allowing binding of the heteromeric Smad complex [5]. The net effect of this is to halt the cell cycle in G1, and thus potently inhibit proliferation [6].

TGFbeta is frequently overexpressed by epithelial cancer cells which become unresponsive to its anti-proliferative effects and this leads to paracrine stimulation of stromal cells within the tumour microenvironment [6]. As a result there is stimulation of angiogenesis and upregulation of extracellular matrix (ECM) degrading proteinases. Expression of the urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA) is upregulated by TGFbeta [7], which through the formation of plasmin enables the tumour cell to penetrate the basement membrane. Overexpression of uPA has been observed in invasive malignancies of the breast, colon and stomach [8]. The uPA inhibitor plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 (PAI-1) is another TGFbeta target gene that is up-regulated in advanced cancers [8]. The paradox of an elevated expression level of PAI promoting tumour invasion is partially explained by the observation that this inhibitor can promote cell migration and angiogenesis, independent of the effects on plasmin activity [9], [10].

In contrast to the plethora of information about mutations in the TGFbeta signal cascade in colon, gastric and pancreatic cancers [2], [11]-[13], the contribution of perturbed TGFbeta signalling in oesophageal adenocarcinoma has not been elucidated completely. Oesophageal adenocarcinoma usually arises through a multi-step sequence from Barrett's metaplasia to dysplasia and carcinoma [14]. Recent in vivo and in vitro evidence suggests that inactivation of SMAD4, lack of RUNX3 and inability to degrade SnoN may be some of the causes for the unresponsiveness of oesophageal cancer to TGFbeta anti-proliferative effect [15]-[17]. This therefore begs the question whether TGFbeta can promote invasion in this disease in the context of deranged SMAD4 signalling.

The signalling pathways by which TGFbeta exerts its effects on migration and invasion are gradually being elucidated. The activated TGFbeta receptor complex is now known to activate kinase pathways independently of Smad signalling and these have been shown to stimulate the expression of both uPA and PAI [18]-[20]. These pathways include the phosphoinositol-3 kinase (PI3K)[9], and the mitogen activated protein kinases (MAPK) particularly extracellular signal regulated kinase (ERK),[21]c-jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) [22], and p38 [23].

The specific aims of this study were therefore: 1). To determine whether TGFbeta can simultaneously affect proliferation (cell cycle, c-Myc and p21 expression) and invasion indices (ECM proteinase expression and functional invasive characteristics) in oesophageal adenocarcinoma cell lines; 2). To elucidate the cell signalling pathways involved in these responses.

First, the effect of TGFbeta on cell cycle progression and expression of cell cycle associated genes, p21 and c-myc, was assessed. The control experimental conditions were cells treated with serum free media (SF), which is known to induce cell cycle arrest, and cells treated with SF media followed by release into the cell cycle by complete media (C), (Figure 1A and 1B). All cells maintained in serum free media for 24 h demonstrated an increase in the proportion of cells in G0/G1 (Figure 1A, 1B). The cells were also arrested by stimulation with UV light as determined by a BrdU incorporation assay (data not shown). However, when cultured in the presence of TGFbeta (T) only 1/5 BE adenocarcinoma cell lines (OE33), exhibited an increase in the fraction of cells in G0/G1 (11% OE33 p<0.05), (Fig 1A, 1B). Since the inhibition of proliferation in response to TGFbeta would be expected to occur as a result of an up-regulation of p21CIP/WAF1 and a decreased expression of c-Myc, the effect of TGFbeta on these mRNA expression levels was examined. Real time PCR demonstrated that only OE33 cells exhibited a significant increase in p21 and decrease in c-Myc expression (Figure 2A and 2B), (p<0.05 in both cases). TGFbeta is thus unable to significantly alter the expression of c-myc and p21 mRNA, and halt cell cycle progression in 4/5 BE invasive adenocarcinoma cell lines. This is in keeping with our previous data on cell proliferation measured using the MTT assay [17].

Nuclear translocation of Smad 2/3 (Fig 3A) and phosphorylation of Smad 2 and 3 (Fig 3B) were observed in all cell lines following stimulation with TGFbeta. Nuclear accumulation of Smad2/3 in BIC, which does not express Smad4, confirms early work suggesting that Smad4 is not necessary for Smad 2/3 nuclear translocation [3]. The nuclear translocation of Smad 2/3 and of the phosphorylation of Smad 2 and 3 attest to the functionality of the TGFbeta pathway. However, the cells remain unable to decrease their proliferation as a result of TGFbeta stimulation. Therefore, to determine whether the inability of TGFbeta to regulate the cell cycle is secondary to a lack of Smad dependent transcriptional regulation we used a (CAGA)12-luciferase reporter. The lack of Smad 4 expression in BIC makes this cell line the perfect negative control for transcriptional regulation of the TGFbeta pathway. BIC and SEG both display no transcriptional activity while the low transcriptional activity in TE7 and FLO may not be sufficient to trigger an anti-proliferative response. Only the TGFbeta responsive cells, OE33, demonstrated a marked induction of transcriptional activity in TGFbeta treated cells compared to control cells (Figure 3C) (68+/-5.5; p<0.01). Hence, the non-responsiveness to the anti-proliferative effects of TGFbeta may be due, at least partly, to a lack of Smad-dependent transcriptional regulation, which might stem from Smad4 inactivation, the inability to degrade SnoN and possibly other unknown mechanisms [16], [17].

The ability of TGFbeta to regulate the genes uPA and PAI, which are associated with ECM modulation, was then assessed. All cell lines, with the exception of BIC up-regulated either PAI and/or uPA in response to TGFbeta. (Figure 4A and 4B; OE33, FLO p<0.001; TE7, SEG p<0.05 for PAI and OE33, SEG, FLO p<0.01; TE7, p<0.05 for uPA). TGFbeta was thus able to up-regulate the expression of both genes associated with ECM modulation in 4/5 cell lines, including three lines (TE7, SEG and FLO) that lacked Smad-dependent transcriptional responses and growth suppression by TGFbeta.

To characterise the molecular basis for the differential responses of the cell lines to TGFbeta, we analysed some of the Smad independent kinase pathways known to activate genes associated with ECM.[22] Overall, the levels of phosphorylated JNK did not vary following TGFbeta treatment (Figure 5). The levels of phosphorylated Akt and ERK1/2 were increased in TE7 (1.6 and 5.3 fold respectively) and SEG (1.7 and 1.8 fold respectively) following 4 hours of stimulation with TGFbeta (Figure 5 and Figure S1 shows densitometry data). Only pAKT was increased in OE33 (1.8 fold) following treatment but very little variation was observed in BIC and FLO (figure S1). There was no change in total expression levels of these kinases (data not shown). BIC cells did not show an induction of uPA, PAI and Smad independent kinase pathways and were therefore not studied further.

Specifically, in OE33 and SEG, TGFbeta induced up-regulation of PAI mRNA was significantly diminished by LY294002 (OE33, SEG p<0.001). Inhibition of ERK activity by PD98059 significantly diminished TGFbeta induced up-regulation of PAI mRNA in all cell lines (OE33, TE7 p<0.05; SEG p<0.001; FLO p<0.01), (Figure 6A). Following inhibition of JNK activity by SP600125 there was a reduction of the TGFbeta induced up-regulation of PAI by a minimum of 50% in all cell lines analysed (p<0.05 for all cell lines). These findings were generally confirmed for a second of each class of kinase inhibitor (wortmannin, U0126 and Curcumin), (table S1), although ERK inhibition with UO126 was less effective than PD98059 possibly because of differential specificity of these inhibitors for MEK1 and 2. A similar pattern was seen when uPA expression was assessed in inhibitor treated cells (Figure 6B). Whereas, the effects of PI3K inhibition had a variable effect on uPA expression, inhibition of ERK by PD98059, and inhibition of JNK by SP600125 markedly reduced (by a minimum of 40%) the TGFbeta induction of uPA in all BE adenocarcinoma cells (Figure 6B). Overall, the most consistent results were seen with the JNK inhibitors since both inhibitors (SP600125 and Curcumin) significantly reduced the up-regulation of PAI and uPA in all cell lines, (table S1).

Next we determined whether inhibition of these kinase pathways had an effect on PAI and uPA enzyme activity, as well as expression levels. Zymography and reverse zymography indicated that TGFbeta induces an increase in the proteolytic activity of uPA (increase in the white band intensity), and an increase in the ability of PAI to retard the action of uPA in all cells lines analysed (increase in the dark band intensity), (Fig 7A-D, compare lane C with T). The inhibition of PI3K activity by LY294002, and inhibition of ERK signalling by PD98059 resulted in a variable effect on uPA and PAI activity depending on the cell line (densitometry given as figure S2). Inhibition of JNK by SP600125 resulted in the most consistent decrease in activity of uPA and PAI (Figure 7A-D, compare lane T with SP for each cell line with a variation between 0.1 and 0.5 fold on densitometric analysis, figure S2). The expression and the enzyme activity data thus suggests that activation of the ERK and JNK pathways is important for TGFbeta induced up-regulation of PAI and uPA in BE adenocarcinoma cells.

We determined the ability of TGFbeta to influence the invasiveness of cells using three in vitro assays: aggregation, invasion and wounding. An aggregation assay measures the ability of cells to grow in an anchorage-independent manner; invasion assays through matrigel measures the ability of cells to degrade the basement membrane and to migrate through it while the wounding assay only measures the ability of cells to migrate to occupy an empty space. Therefore a highly invasive cell in vitro should not form aggregates, should migrate through matrigel and to close up a wound. TGFbeta had significant effects on at least one assay for each of the adenocarcinoma cells lines, compared to the control (no TGFbeta), (Table 1). In order to examine the effect of kinase inhibitors these were only used in the cells lines exhibiting an increase in their invasive phenotype for a particular assay in response to TGFbeta.

Therefore, aggregation was performed for TE7, SEG, FLO and OE33, invasion for TE7, SEG and OE33 and wounding for OE33. With regards to aggregation, the presence of all three kinase inhibitors diminished the cell scattering ability (a higher score denotes less scattering) of TGFbeta in all the cell lines to a greater or lesser extent (Figure 8A). The increase in TGFbeta-induced invasion observed in TE7, SEG and OE33 cells was significantly inhibited by LY294002 in TE7 cells (p<0.05), by SP600125 in SEG (p<0.05) and by all three inhibitors in OE33 (Figure 8B; p<0.001, LY294002; p<0.01, PD98059; p<0.001, SP600125). In OE33, the TGFbeta induced increase in wound healing over 24 h (p<0.05), is significantly diminished by all three kinase inhibitors (Figure 8C; p<0.05). Overall inhibition of the JNK pathway with SP600125 had the most consistent effect seen in SEG, FLO and OE33 in all three of the assays.

These data suggest a dual role of TGFbeta in the regulation of both the proliferative and invasive properties of BE adenocarcinoma in vitro. 4/5 BE cell lines are unable to mount an anti-proliferative response to TGFbeta. However, the loss of TGFbeta responsiveness is selective, such that the same cell lines that fail to exhibit an anti-proliferative response demonstrate a TGFbeta dependent increase in the expression of PAI and uPA via PI3K, ERK and JNK (Table 2). The effect of kinase inhibitors on expression levels and the enzyme activity of uPA and PAI suggest that the ERK and JNK MAPK pathways may play a role. TGFbeta induced activation of kinase pathways is functionally significant since their inhibition results in a reduction of cellular invasive properties in vitro.

TGFbeta unresponsiveness in the BE adenocarcinoma cells could be attributed to an inability to down-regulate c-Myc, similar to breast cancer cells [24]. Given that all of the unresponsive cells in our panel do not demonstrate a TGFbeta induced increase in transcriptional activity of a TGFbeta reporter plasmid, defective Smad-mediated signal transduction is a possible underlying mechanism (Figure 3). However, since the Smad3/4 reporter construct is not the native promoter and may miss possible enhancer or suppressor elements this conclusion must be interpreted with caution. Furthermore, other mechanisms such as the inability to degrade SnoN have been described in oesophageal cells as a possible reason for a lack of responsiveness to TGFbeta [16].

In contrast, there was a modest TGFbeta dependent activation of kinase pathways (PI3K, ERK and JNK MAPK) in BE adenocarcinoma cells (Figure 5). This is interesting since inhibition of PI3K, ERK and JNK MAPK decreased the TGFbeta induced expression of the ECM genes PAI and uPA (Figure 6). The PAI promoter contains motifs complementary to the binding sequence of AP-1 [25], [26], while the uPA promoter also contains two AP-1 binding sites [27]. Targets of the MAPK pathways ERK and JNK include the transcription factors c-Fos, c-Jun and ATF-2, which can undergo c-Fos/c-Jun or c-Jun/ATF-2 heterodimerisation to form AP-1. Activation of MAPK pathways can thus increase the expression of PAI and uPA [28], [29]; however, we cannot rule out the contribution of other pathways such as matrix metalloproteinases which also contain AP-1 promoter sites and are involved in ECM remodelling during invasion.

The combination of uPA, uPA receptor and PAI is crucial in the modulation of ECM homeostasis and tumour invasion as demonstrated in breast and prostate cancer cells [30], [31] and oesophageal adenocarcinoma cells made to over-express uPA in vitro[11]. Elevated levels of uPA and PAI can also enhance migration, through modulation of cell-to-matrix adhesion [7], [32]. The involvement of PAI and uPA in invasion may explain the functional significance of the inhibition of kinase pathways on the invasive properties of oesophageal adenocarcinoma cells (Figure 8). It is worth noting that OE33 was the only cell line that had a demonstrable increase in the SMAD reporter construct as well as increased kinase activity in response to TGFbetal. For this cell line it is not possible to rule out a contribution of Smad activation in the TGFbetal response of OE33 cells although the invasive properties were significantly reduced by kinase inhibitors (Figure 8).

uPA and PAI expression through the activity of ERK and JNK may also be relevant for tumour progression in vivo. For example, in prostate, breast and pancreatic carcinoma cells, JNK, or the upstream activator of both kinases, MKK4, has been demonstrated to mediate growth of cells in vitro, and as xenografts in vivo[33], [34]. Furthermore, over-expression of PAI and uPA has been shown to correlate strongly with tumour stage and to be of independent prognostic significance in oesophageal adenocarcinoma [13], [35].

In conclusion, we have shown that there is a divergent response to TGFbeta in cells from BE adenocarcinoma. The Smad dependent anti-proliferative response is lost; however, the ability of TGFbeta to induce ECM genes PAI and uPA prevails. This occurs predominantly through the ERK and JNK MAPK pathways, and thus contributes to the invasive properties of the oesophageal tumour cell. Such a differential response utilising different cell signalling pathways may allow TGFbeta to play a role in both the initiation and progression of oesophageal adenocarcinoma.

Cells were grown in a 60 mm dish to confluency, and then wounded using a hand held engraving drill (Minicraft MB168) fitted with a cut down 10 microL pipette tip. Wound area was measured using an eyepiece graticule and calibrated using a haemocytometer grid, at 10x magnification. The wounded monolayer was washed with PBS, and then cultured in serum free medium, containing 10 ng/mL TGFbeta1 alone or with LY294002 (20 microM), PD98590 (20 microM) or SP600125 (20 microM) for 24 h. The wound area was again measured, the absolute change in wound size deduced and the % healing at 24 h then calculated. In each experiment 8 wounds were made and each experiment was repeated at least three times.
