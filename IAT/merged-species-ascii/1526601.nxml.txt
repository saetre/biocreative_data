Bone marrow CD34+ cells from rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients have abnormal capacities to respond to tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha and to differentiate into fibroblast-like cells producing matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-1. We explored the expression of mRNA for nuclear factor (NF)kappaB in RA bone marrow CD34+ cells to delineate the mechanism for their abnormal responses to TNF-alpha. CD34+ cells were purified from bone marrow samples obtained from 49 RA patients and 31 osteoarthritis (OA) patients during joint operations via aspiration from the iliac crest. The mRNAs for NFkappaB1 (p50), NFkappaB2 (p52) and RelA (p65) were examined by quantitative RT-PCR. The expression of NFkappaB1 mRNA in bone marrow CD34+ cells was significantly higher in RA than in OA, whereas there was no significant difference in the expression of mRNA for NFkappaB2 and RelA. The expression of NFkappaB1 mRNA was not correlated with serum C-reactive protein or with the treatment with methotrexate or oral steroid. Silencing of NFkappaB1 by small interfering RNA abrogated the capacity of RA bone marrow CD34+ cells to differentiate into fibroblast-like cells and to produce MMP-1 and vascular endothelial growth factor upon stimulation with stem cell factor, granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor and TNF-alpha without influencing their viability and capacity to produce beta2-microglobulin. These results indicate that the enhanced expression of NFkappaB1 mRNA in bone marrow CD34+ cells plays a pivotal role in their abnormal responses to TNF-alpha and, thus, in the pathogenesis of RA.

Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic inflammatory disease characterized by hyperplasia of synovial lining cells, consisting of macrophage-like type A synoviocytes and fibroblast-like type B synoviocytes [1]. It has been appreciated that type A synoviocytes, which are also called intimal macrophages, are derived from monocyte precursors in the bone marrow [1]. On the other hand, type B synoviocytes, which are also called fibroblast-like synoviocytes, have the morphological appearance of fibroblasts as well as the capacity to produce and secrete a variety of factors, including proteoglycans, cytokines, arachidonic acid metabolites, and matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), that lead to the destruction of joints [1]. Apart from type A synoviocytes, the origin of type B synoviocytes has been unclear [1]. Of note, we have recently demonstrated that bone marrow CD34+ cells from RA patients have abnormal capacities to respond to tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha and to differentiate into fibroblast-like cells producing MMP-1, suggesting that bone marrow CD34+ progenitor cells might generate type B synoviocytes and thus could play an important role in the pathogenesis of RA [2].

TNF-alpha is one of the first triggers to be found effective for the activation of nuclear factor (NF)kappaB in RA synovium [3]. This mechanism of activation was followed by up-regulation of several inflammatory genes usually found in active RA. Accordingly, a number of studies have shown that TNF-alpha blockade has beneficial effects in the treatment of RA [4]. Moreover, inhibition of NFkappaB by the antioxidant N-acetylcysteine significantly reduced TNF-alpha- and NFkappaB-dependent gene expression and synovial proliferation [3]. We thus hypothesized that abnormal responses of RA bone marrow CD34+ cells to TNF-alpha might result from abnormal expression of NFkappaB genes. The current studies were undertaken, therefore, to explore the expression of mRNA for various components of NFkappaB in bone marrow CD34+ cells in RA.

Bone marrow samples were obtained from 49 patients with RA (8 males and 41 females: mean age, 58.6 years; age range, 35 to 78 years) who satisfied the American College of Rheumatology 1987 revised criteria for RA [5] and gave informed consent in accordance with the World Medical Association Declaration of Helsinki Ethical Principles for Medical Research Involving Human Subjects. The samples were taken during joint operations via aspiration from the iliac crest under anesthesia. As a control, bone marrow samples were similarly obtained from 31 patients with osteoarthritis (OA; 3 males and 28 females; mean age, 71.2 years; age range, 49 to 81 years) who gave informed consent. Most patients with RA and OA were taking non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. Of the 45 patients with RA, 23 were treated with low dose methotrexate (MTX) and 33 were taking oral steroids when bone marrow samples were obtained. No OA patients were taking MTX or oral steroid.

Mononuclear cells were isolated by centrifugation of heparinized bone marrow aspirates over sodium diatrizoate-Ficoll gradients. CD34+ cells were purified from the mononuclear cells by positive selection with magnetic beads (CD34 progenitor cell selection system; Dynal, Oslo, Norway). The cells thus prepared were >95% CD34+ cells and <0.5% CD19+ B cells, as previously described [2]. In addition, CD34+ cells derived from bone marrow aspirates from the iliac crests of healthy individuals (purity >95%) were purchased from BioWhittaker (Walkersville, MD, USA).

Total RNA was isolated from purified bone marrow CD34+ cells using the Trizol reagent (Life Technologies, Grand Island, NY, USA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. cDNA samples were prepared from 1 mug of total RNA using the SuperScript reverse transcriptase preamplification system (Life Technologies) with oligo (dT) primer and subjected to PCR. Real-time quantitative PCR was performed using the LightCycler rapid thermal cycler system (Roche Diagnostics, Lewes, UK) with primer sets for NFkappaB1, NFkappaB2, RelA or beta-actin and Light Cycler-Fast Start DNA master SYBR Green I (Roche Diagnostics). The primers were designed using Oligo Primer Analysis Software version 5.0 (Takara Bio Inc., Ohtsu, Japan). The detail of primer sequences is shown in Table 1. Quantitative analysis was performed using LightCycler Software v.3.5. PCR reaction conditions composed of denaturing at 95degreesC for 10 minutes for 1 cycle, followed by 40 cycles of denaturing (10 seconds at 95degreesC), annealing (10 seconds at 60degreesC (NFkappaB2, RelA) or 62degreesC (NFkappaB1, beta-actin)), and extension (5 seconds (NFkappaB1), 6 seconds (NFkappaB2, RelA), or 10 seconds (beta-actin) at 72degreesC).

Purified bone marrow CD34+ cells (obtained from three RA patients and three OA patients) were treated with IntraPreptrade mark Permeabilization Reagent (Immunotech, Marseille, France), followed by staining with phycoerythrin (PE)-conjugated anti-NFkappaB p50 (E-10; a mouse IgG1 monoclonal antibody against amino acids 120 to 239 mapping at the amino terminus of human NFkappaB p50; Santa Cruz Biotech, Santa Cruz, CA, USA) or PE-conjugated normal mouse IgG1 (Santa Cruz). The cells were analyzed using an EPICS XL flow cytometer (Coulter, Hialeah, FL, USA) equipped with an argon-ion laser at 488 nm. A combination of low-angle and 90degrees light scatter measurements (forward scatter versus side scatter) was used to generate a bit map gating to identify bone marrow cells using Cyto-Troltrade mark Control Cells (Coulter) and Immuno-Troltrade mark Cells (Coulter) as standards. Specific mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) for NFkappaB1 (p50) was calculated by subtracting the non-specific MFI of staining with the isotype-matched control mouse IgG1.

SMARTpool(R) small interfering RNA (siRNA) for NFkappaB1 (p50) gene and nonsense scrambled control siRNA were purchased from Dharmacon (Lafayette, CO, USA). Chemical transfection of siRNAs into bone marrow CD34+ cells was performed using siPORTtrade mark Amine Transfection Agent (Ambion, Austin, TX, USA) according to the manufacturer's directions. Briefly, purified bone marrow CD34+ cells were cultured in a 24-well microtiter plate (N0. 3524; Costar, Cambridge, MA, USA) at 2 x 105 cells per well in 0.2 ml culture medium in the presence of SCF (10 ng/ml) and GM-CSF (1 ng/ml). After 24 hours of incubation, chemical transfection of siRNAs was performed, and incubated for 4 hours.

After transfection of siRNAs, the cells were cultured with SCF (10 ng/ml) and GM-CSF (1 ng/ml) in 1.0 ml culture medium for 48 hours and then harvested for RNA extraction. Alternatively, the cells were cultured in a 24-well microtiter plate at 2 x 105 cells per well in 1.0 ml culture medium for 4 weeks in the presence of SCF (10 ng/ml), GM-CSF (1 ng/ml) and TNF-alpha (10 ng/ml) without medium change, as previously described [2]. The differentiation of fibroblast-like cells was observed under the phase-contrast light microscopy. The concentrations of MMP-1 and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in the culture supernatants were measured using the Biotrak human MMP-1 ELISA system (Amarsham Pharmacia Biotech, Buckinghamshire, UK) and human VEGF immunoassay kit (BioSource International, Camarillo, CA, USA), respectively. The concentrations of beta2-microglobulin (beta2MG) were determined by an ELISA as previously described [6].

Comparison between RA and OA patients and between RA patients with MTX or steroid and those without MTX or steroid was carried out using Welch's t test. Significance of the effects of siRNA transfection on the generation of fibroblast-like cells and on the production of MMP-1 and VEGF was evaluated by Wilcoxon's signed rank test. Correlation between serum C-reactive protein and NFkappaB1 mRNA in bone marrow CD34+ cells and that between NFkappaB1 mRNA and protein were evaluated using a liner regression test. Correlation between NFkappaB1 mRNA in bone marrow CD34+ cells and the generation of fibroblast-like cells was analyzed using a Spearman's rank correlation test.

The expression of mRNA for NFkappaB1 (p50), NFkappaB2 (p52), and RelA (p65) in bone marrow CD34+ cells is shown as the ratio of the copy numbers to those of beta-actin mRNA in Figure 1. The expression of NFkappaB1 mRNA was significantly higher in RA bone marrow CD34+ cells than in OA bone marrow CD34+ cells (p = 0.005351), whereas there were no significant differences in the expression of NFkappaB2 mRNA (p = 0.130116). Although the expression of RelA mRNA appeared to be lower in RA bone marrow CD34+ cells than in OA bone marrow CD34+ cells, it did not reach statistical significance (p = 0.192150). These results indicate that the expression of mRNA for components of NFkappaB1 is exclusively enhanced in bone marrow CD34+ cells from patients with RA.

Next, experiments were carried out to examine whether the elevation of NFkappaB1 mRNA expression parallels the elevation of NFkappaB1 protein expression in bone marrow CD34+ cells. The protein expression of NFkappaB1 was evaluated by staining of permeabilized bone marrow CD34+ cells from three RA patients and three OA patients with anti-NFkappaB p50 monoclonal antibody, followed by analysis with flow cytometry. As can be seen in Figure 2, bone marrow CD34+ cells express NFkappaB1 (p50) protein, the quantity of which can be expressed as MFI. Moreover, there is significant correlation between MFI for NFkappaB1 and NFkappaB1 mRNA in the six bone marrow CD34+ cells (Figure 3). The results indicate that the elevation of NFkappaB1 mRNA leads to the increase in NFkappaB1 protein expression.

Of note, 22 and 33 of the 45 RA patients were treated with MTX and oral steroids, respectively, whereas no OA patients were taking either MTX or oral steroids. It is therefore possible that MTX and oral steroids might have affected the expression of NFkappaB1 mRNA in bone marrow CD34+ cells. As shown in Figure 4, however, there were no significant differences in the expression of NFkappaB1 mRNA in bone marrow CD34+ cells between RA patients taking MTX or oral steroids and those who were not, although the expression of NFkappaB1 mRNA appeared to be lower in RA patients taking MTX or oral steroids. It is unlikely, therefore, that the medication the RA patients were taking would have resulted in the upregulation of NFkappaB1 mRNA expression in bone marrow CD34+ cells. It should be also noted that the expression of NFkappaB1 mRNA in bone marrow CD34+ cells was not significantly correlated with serum C-reactive protein (CRP) levels in RA patients (Figure 5). The data thus indicate that the upregulation of NFkappaB1 mRNA in bone marrow CD34+ cells is independent of the activity of the systemic inflammation, as reflected by serum CRP.

There was a variation in the expression of NFkappaB1 mRNA among the RA patients. We next examined the relationship of the initial levels of NFkappaB1 mRNA in RA bone marrow CD34+ cells with their capacity to differentiate into fibroblast-like cells. As shown in Figure 6, there was a significant correlation between the NFkappaB1 mRNA expression and the generation of fibroblast-like cells from bone marrow CD34+ cells upon stimulation with SCF, GM-CSF and TNF-alpha for 4 weeks in 12 RA patients. The data indicate that the enhanced expression of NFkappaB1 mRNA is important for the enhanced generation of fibroblast-like cells.

Previous studies have demonstrated that TNF-alpha plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of RA [4]. It is possible, therefore, that the up-regulation of NFkappaB1 mRNA in bone marrow CD34+ cells might be secondary to the increased levels of TNF-alpha in the born marrow; experiments were carried out to test this possibility. Highly purified bone marrow CD34+ cells from healthy individuals were cultured in the presence of TNF-alpha (10 ng/ml) for 24 hours, after which the expression of mRNA for various components of NFkappaB was examined. As shown in Figure 7, treatment of bone marrow CD34+ cells with TNF-alpha upregulated not only the expression of NFkappaB1 (p50) mRNA, but that of NFkappaB2 (p52) mRNA and RelA (p65) mRNA. Since only the expression of NFkappaB1 mRNA, but not that of NFkappaB2 mRNA and RelA mRNA, was significantly upregulated in RA bone marrow CD34+ cells, the increased expression of NFkappaB1 mRNA in RA bone marrow CD34+ cells might not be accounted for simply by the increased levels of TNF-alpha in the bone marrow.

We next examined whether silencing of NFkappaB1 (p50) mRNA in RA bone marrow CD34+ cells might correct their abnormal responses to TNF-alpha. As shown in Figure 8, treatment of bone marrow CD34+ cells with siRNA for NFkappaB1 reduced the expression of NFkappaB1 mRNA by approximately 80%. More importantly, reduction of NFkappaB1 mRNA markedly suppressed the generation of fibroblast-like cells from RA bone marrow CD34+ cells upon stimulation with SCF, GM-CSF and TNF-alpha (Figures 9 and 10). Accordingly, silencing of NFkappaB1 by siRNA significantly decreased the levels of MMP-1 and VEGF in culture supernatants of RA bone marrow CD34+ cells (Figure 11). Since bone marrow CD34+ cells proliferate in response to SCF, GM-CSF and TNF-alpha, it was possible that differences in MMP-1 and VEGF might be a result of alteration in cell proliferation by NFkappaB1 siRNA. Previous studies disclosed that beta2MG is produced by a number of cell types, including lymphocytes, myeloid cells, and tumor cells [7-9]. The production of beta2MG generally correlates with cell proliferation [6-9]. In fact, the levels of beta2MG in the culture supernatants paralleled the viable cell counts of bone marrow CD34+ cells stimulated with SCF, GM-CSF and TNF-alpha. Of note, silencing of NFkappaB1 also significantly decreased the ratios of MMP-1 and VEGF to beta2MG (MMP-1/beta2MG and VEGF/beta2MG) in culture supernatants of RA bone marrow CD34+ cells (Figure 12). Consistently, whereas siRNA for NFkappaB1 inhibited the differentiation of RA bone marrow CD34+ cells stimulated with SCF, GM-CSF and TNF-alpha into fibroblast-like cells (Figure 13), it significantly influenced neither the viable cell numbers nor the levels of beta2MG in the culture supernatants (Figure 14). These results confirm that the enhanced expression of NFkappaB1 mRNA in RA bone marrow CD34+ cells led to their abnormal capacity to differentiate into fibroblast-like cells producing MMP-1 upon stimulation with SCF, GM-CSF and TNF-alpha without affecting cell viability or proliferation. The data suggest, therefore, that the enhanced expression of NFkappaB1 mRNA in bone marrow hematopoietic stem cells might play a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of RA.

The importance of TNF-alpha in the pathogenesis of RA has been well appreciated. Thus, anti-TNF-alpha antibodies and soluble TNF receptors have been demonstrated to have beneficial effects in the treatment of RA [4]. On the other hand, increasing attention has been paid to the role of bone marrow abnormalities in the pathogenesis of RA. In this regard, we demonstrated that RA bone marrow CD34+ cells have abnormal capacities to respond to TNF-alpha and to differentiate into fibroblast-like cells producing MMP-1 [2]. It should be noted that NFkappaB plays an important role in signal transduction and expression of a variety of genes, including MMP-1, under the influence of TNF-alpha [3]. The results in the current study have demonstrated that the expression of mRNA for NFkappaB1 is increased in RA bone marrow CD34+ cells. Of note, the expression of NFkappaB1 mRNA was significantly correlated with that of NFkappaB1 protein. Moreover, the initial levels of NFkappaB1 mRNA in RA bone marrow CD34+ cells were correlated with their capacity to differentiate into fibroblast-like cells upon stimulation with TNF-alpha. The data suggest that the increased expression of NFkappaB1 mRNA might lead to constitutive overproduction of NFkappaB p50 molecules and thus result in abnormal responses to TNF-alpha of RA bone marrow CD34+ cells. Of note, bee venom and its major component melittin have been shown to display anti-arthritic effects through inactivation of NFkappaB [10]. Since bee venom and melittin delay and reduce nuclear translocation of the p50 subunit of NFkappaB but not p65 (RelA) [10], the importance of NFkappaB p50 rather than p65 in the pathogenesis of inflammatory arthritides has been underscored.

In the present study, significant numbers of RA patients were treated with MTX and oral steroids. However, there were no significant differences in the expression of NFkappaB1 mRNA in bone marrow CD34+ cells between RA patients receiving MTX or oral steroids and those who were not, although the expression of NFkappaB1 mRNA appeared to be lower in RA patients receiving these drugs. It is suggested, therefore, that administration of MTX and oral steroids might have made the differences in the expression of NFkappaB1 mRNA in bone marrow CD34+ cells between RA and OA less marked. On the other hand, the expression of NFkappaB1 mRNA in bone marrow CD34+ cells was not correlated with serum CRP levels in RA patients. The upregulation of NFkappaB1 mRNA in bone marrow CD34+ cells might not, therefore, be secondary to systemic inflammation, but may be a primary abnormality intrinsic to RA.

In the present study, the expression of mRNA for RelA (p65) appeared to be decreased in RA bone marrow CD34+ cells compared with that in OA bone marrow CD34+ cells, although this decrease did not reach statistical significance. Of note, a previous study demonstrated that embryonic fibroblasts from RelA-deficient mice are defective in the TNF-alpha mediated induction of mRNAs for IkappaBalpha [11]. Moreover, in RelA deficient fibroblasts, IkappaBbeta protein was absent, presumably due to the decreased stability of IkappaBbeta mRNA [11]. Since IkappaB plays an important role in inhibition of translocation of NFkappaB into the nucleus, the decrease in RelA mRNA might result in enhanced activation of NFkappaB related genes through upregulation of the translocation of NFkappaB. It is suggested, therefore, that the decreased expression of RelA mRNA in RA bone marrow CD34+ cells might also contribute to abnormal response to TNF-alpha.

It is possible that the upregulation of NFkappaB1 mRNA in bone marrow CD34+ cells might be secondary to the increased levels of TNF-alpha in the bone marrow. In fact, the treatment of bone marrow CD34+ cells from healthy individuals with TNF-alpha resulted in the increased expression of NFkappaB1 mRNA. However, TNF-alpha also enhanced the expression of mRNAs for NFkappaB2 and RelA in bone marrow CD34+ cells from healthy individuals. Of note, the expression of RelA mRNA appeared to be rather decreased in RA bone marrow CD34+ cells as mentioned above. Taken together, these data strongly suggest that the enhanced expression of NFkappaB1 mRNA might not be due simply to the increased levels of TNF-alpha in the bone marrow. Further studies to explore the mechanism of abnormal expression of NFkappaB1 mRNA in bone marrow CD34+ cells would be important for delineation of the pathogenesis of RA.

The role of the enhanced expression of NFkappaB1 mRNA in RA bone marrow CD34+ cells in their abnormal responses to TNF-alpha was further confirmed by the experiments of selective silencing of NFkappaB1 mRNA. Reduction of NFkappaB1 mRNA in RA bone marrow CD34+ cells by transfection of siRNA for NFkappaB1 markedly suppressed the generation of fibroblast-like cells as well as the production of MMP-1 and VEGF under the influence of TNF-alpha without affecting the viability or the capacity to produce beta2MG. These results indicate that upregulation of NFkappaB1 mRNA expression leads to the enhanced responses of RA bone marrow CD34+ cells to TNF-alpha. Thus, the enhanced NFkappaB1 mRNA expression might be a critical defect in RA bone marrow CD34+ cells.

Autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) has been used to treat severe RA in limited case reports [12,13]. However, a study with large numbers of patients has disclosed that recurrence of RA is frequent in patients who received autologous HSCT [14,15]. Frequent recurrence after autologous HSCT for RA suggests that abnormalities in bone marrow stem cells might persist after the treatment [16,17]. It is possible that the enhanced expression of NFkappaB1 mRNA might be closely related with such abnormalities in bone marrow stem cells, although further studies are required to confirm this point. It would also be important to explore whether there might be another transcription factor that could be inhibited without suppressing the differentiation of bone marrow CD34+ cells into fibroblast-like cells in order to confirm the importance of NFkappaB1 mRNA expression in the pathogenesis of RA.

The present study has revealed the enhanced expression of NFkappaB1 mRNA in RA bone marrow CD34+ cells as possible intrinsic abnormalities in bone marrow, resulting in abnormal responses to TNF-alpha. Further studies to delineate the mechanisms for the abnormal NFkappaB1 mRNA expression would be important for a complete understanding of the pathogenesis and etiology of RA.
