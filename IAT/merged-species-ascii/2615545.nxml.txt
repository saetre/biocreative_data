Asthma, one major respiratory consequence, appeared around 6-9% prevalence in general population 1. The incidence of asthma appeared the increased trend during past decade. Asthma is caused by a complex interaction between multiple candidate genes and environmental factors. However, the related molecular basis for this upper airway disorder remains unclear. The raised incidence of asthma has been attributed to increased environment contamination, overusage of antibiotics as well as constitutional and genetic factors. However, the mechanistic roles of the disease-associated SNPs have yet to be elucidated especially in the context of the pathophysiology of asthma. Furthermore, the related factor for predicting asthma susceptibilities remains obscure.

Numerous cytokines play an important role in allergic immune disorders, such as asthma. Proinflammatory cytokines could contribute to this inflammatory process for asthma 2. These cytokines regulate diverse biological functions by binding to receptors at the cell surface to activate complex signal transduction pathways, including the signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) signaling pathways. The STAT pathway mediates the signals of a wide range of cytokines, growth factors and hormones. Aberrant activation of STAT pathway may predispose to cell dysfunction or dysregulation. Signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) has been demonstrated to be associated with asthma susceptibilities 3. Some STAT gene variation (C39134A) might be associated with IgE regulation and atopy 4. .

Infectious diseases have a major impact on both the development and severity of asthma. Innate immunity status and related genetic variations have been reported to be associated with inflammatory disorders such as asthma. Toll-like receptors (TLRs) are involved in immune responses towards various micro-organisms. TLRs are innate immune sensors of microbial cell wall products that initiate early host responses 5. TLRs play a pivotal role in the induction of first-line defense mechanisms of the immune system and trigger adaptive immune responses to microbial pathogens.

The CD40 protein plays important roles in cell-mediated and humoral immune responses 6. CD40 protein is expressed in a variety of cell types. CD40 ligation causes cells to produce inflammatory cytokines and cellular adhesion molecules. CD40 gene polymorphisms exert a genetic effect on IgE production in patients with asthma through translational regulation of CD40 expression on B cells 6. Asthma is characterized by airway smooth muscle hyperplasia, inflammatory cell infiltration, and increased expression of cytokines. These cytokines have the potential to alter the expression of surface receptors such as CD40 ligand on the airway smooth muscle cell 7.

Reviewing MEDLINE database, few investigator demonstrated the correlation of STAT2, TLR4 and CD40 gene polymorphisms with asthma. Furthermore, literatures about the genetic associations of STAT2, TLR4, and CD40 upon asthma are inconsistent. In this survey, our genetic targets were all import roles amongst the complex pathogenesis of asthma, including the cytokine signals (STAT), viral defense (TLR) and immune response (CD40). We aimed to evaluate whether STAT2, TLR4 and CD40 gene polymorphisms are attractive markers for predicting the susceptibility of asthma. We also performed linkage and association analyses in these candidate regions. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first survey in this field.

Bronchial asthma is a chronic airway disorder characterized by reversible bronchial hyper-responsiveness and airway inflammation. Asthma is a multifactorial disease influenced by genetic and environmental factors. While environmental factors are critical for asthma development, genetic factors also play a major role in its clinical expressions 9. Oxidative stress is a key component of inflammation. Inflammation is a key mechanism in asthma. Variation in genes encoding inflammatory responses might influence asthma risk through interaction with chronic inflammation and pro-inflammatory environmental risk factors, such as sedentary conditions, lifestyle, and air pollutions. However, the mechanism for asthma is complex. The precise physiological stimulus mediating asthma presentation remains obscure.

Growing evidences suggest that asthma is a multi-step process of genetic alterations. Some possible factors have been implicated with asthma, including cytokines, signal ligants, and defense factors. Genetic surveys for asthma might provide insight into related pathophysiology and mechanisms. During past decades, several loci and genes have been found to be associated with the disorder 10. Numerous genetic factors might interfere with the inflammatory capacity of leukocytes, thus altering whole body allergy and asthma events. Some patients with different clinical phenotypes might display variable susceptibilities toward asthma.

STAT is associated with endothelial expression, transcription and regulations of cytokines, including interleukin, nitric oxide synthesis, p21 and interferon 11. STAT function has been implicated in the transduction of signals for growth, reproduction, viral defense, and immune regulation 12. STAT cascade are required for cytokines, growth factors, G-proteins and hormones (growth hormone and prolactin) 13. Expression of some cytokines could be regulated by STAT proteins 14. Transcription factors of STAT family are required for cellular responses to multiple signaling molecules 15. After ligand binding-induced activation, STAT proteins are phosphorylated and translocated to the nucleus 16. Then STAT binds to nuclear DNA elements in the promoters of specific genes, which further alter the transcriptional activity of these loci.

STAT gene is a positional candidate located on chromosome 2 17. STAT gene may be associated with predisposition to allergic diseases 18. STAT gene represents one of the most promising candidate genes for asthma 19. Numerous disorders were associated with STAT expressions, including asthma 3,20. Leung et al. demonstrated the association between STAT6* C1570T genetic variation and lung function changes in asthma individuals 3. Litonjua et al. indicated the STAT3 genetic polymorphism might participate in inflammatory pathways that have an impact on level of lung function 20. Li et al. suggested that STAT-4 T90089C but not STAT-6 G2964A polymorphisms might be the genetic factors for the risk of asthma in Chinese population 21. STAT gene might be involved in the development of eosinophilia and changes in total IgE levels in asthma individuals 19,22.

TLR, a key element in activating inflammatory cascade, plays a critical mediator of the immune response to pathogens. TLRs are highly conserved trans-membrane proteins that play an important role in the detection and recognition of microbial pathogens. Alterations of TLR signaling molecules might be associated with clinical presentation and susceptibility to infectious diseases such as asthma. TLRs play important roles in the signaling of many pathogen-related molecules and endogenous proteins associated with immune activation 23. TLR signaling could induce the production of inflammatory cytokines and proteins in antigen presenting cells. Since leukocyte adhesion is a critical event in airway inflammation and asthma, it is logical to suspect TLR might be involved in asthma pathogenesis. TLR pathway plays an important role in mediating whole body inflammation, which has been implicated in the development of chronic disease.

CD40 ligand is a transmembrane glycoprotein structurally related to tumour necrosis factor-alpha. CD40 ligation has been shown to promote antigen-presenting functions of immune cells, which express CD40 receptor. Some disorders have been demonstrated to be associated with CD40, including Graves' disease (GD) 24, atherosclerosis 25, multiple sclerosis 26. CD40 gene polymorphism (C-1T)*C/C genotype has been reported to be associated with Graves' disease (GD) 24. The interruption of CD40 signaling might produces a more fibrous and stable atherosclerotic lesion 25. Carriers of T allele showed a trend for a lower stimulatory index compared with individuals with C homozygote, which might further interfere with the illness course of multiple sclerosis 26. The CD40 protein might influence the production and function of immunoglobulin E 6.

Single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) results from a base substitution mutation. Some cytokine polymorphisms have been reported to be protective or susceptible associated with asthma 27. SNPs in protein-coding regions might result in a missense mutation (synonymous), with a change of amino acids or a nonsense mutation (non-synonymous) occurring in a termination codon. In addition, SNPs in promoter regions could result in reduced or increased gene expression, whereas SNPs in introns could result in defective splicing or a change in transcription rate if a regulatory element is mutated. SNPs occur on average every 1.9 kb in the genome where 1.42 million SNPs have been mapped with over 60,000 being represented within exons and untranslated regions 28. In this study, we firstly observed some association existed between asthma susceptibility and STAT2 genetic variations. It suggested that STAT gene might be susceptibility genes for asthma.

Based on this association and linkage surveys, it is logical to speculate that STAT2*C related genotype alterations could be primarily responsible for the aberrant immune response that characterizes asthma. STAT2*C related genotypes and allele variants might directly or indirectly influence the mRNA translations for innate immune events. The STAT2 genetic variation might result in the synonymous coding change. Therefore, it is plausible to suspect the intervention, modification, determination or involvement of these STAT2 genetic variations upon the expression or stability of STAT2 as well as the following pathogenesis of asthma.

In this survey, we observed the non-association between STAT2 genotypes with FEV1 or FEV1/FVC, which suggested its roles upon asthma susceptibility rather than severities. Furthermore, there are also predictive values about its effects upon protein sequence. It suggested some STAT2 polymorphisms, might be associated with asthma risk as well as playing potential candidate genetic markers in predicting the susceptibility of asthma. There is biological plausibility for an association between the STAT2 polymorphisms in the exon or promoter regions and asthma risk. Our study should permit a more precise evaluation of the risks associated with individual susceptibility genes and a better insight into asthma pathogenesis. These polymorphisms might have potential influences upon the expression of these repair proteins. However, the real roles and relationships of these genetic traits upon asthma remain complex to be clarified, especially concerning the effects of smoking or life styles additions.

In this survey, we also observed the non-correlations of asthma with the TLR4 and CD40 polymorphisms. This intervening sequence located on mRNA-untranslated region might not influence the amino acid coding, mRNA production, genetic expression and illness susceptibilities. These findings suggested some genetic variations within the TLR4 and CD40 might not be associated with the genetic presentation such as transcription and translations as well as asthma phenotypes and susceptibilities. In addition, the additional effects among TLR4 and CD40 halotypes might not be associated with the susceptibility and contribution for asthma. To the best of our knowledge, this is among the first few study to address the issue of an interaction between genetic variations of STAT2, TLR4 and CD40 and asthma risk.

Taken together, STAT2*C genotype and allele might be correlated with asthma development and pathogenesis. In contrast, TLR4 and CD40 polymorphisms as well as the additional effects of their halotypes were not associated with the different susceptibility and contribution for asthma. These findings highlighted the values and potentials of the STAT2-realted genes upon the future surveys of asthma. STAT2 rs2066807 polymorphisms might become potential markers for the prediction of asthma susceptibility. It also provides a valuable insight into the pathogenesis of asthma. Additional in-vitro or in-vivo researches are requested, including functional studies correlating genotype and phenotype for specific STAT2 alleles within endothelium tissues for airway. After the clarification of these issues, some STAT2 genetic variations might become useful markers to predict the future development of novel therapies for asthma as well as the modulating or interfering factors of related pathogeneses.
