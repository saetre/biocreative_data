We have isolated four clones which hybridize with U6 (4.8S) nuclear RNA, a mammalian small nuclear RNA(nRNA), from DNA of BALB/C mouse liver. Their restriction maps are totally different from each other, indicating that they derived from different loci in the mouse genome. The nucleotide sequences around the hybridizing region in the three clones have been determined. One clone gives a gene that is co-linear with the U6 RNA. There is a sequence TATAAAT beginning 31 nucleotides upstream of the gene, which may suggest that the U6 RNA is transcribed by RNA polymerase II. The other two clones contain a pseudogene for the U6 RNA which has 7 or 9 nucleotide changes from the RNA. The pseudogenes are surrounded by radically different sequences from those surrounding the gene, and they are closely linked to a pseudogene for another snRNA, 4.5S-I RNA, or a part of highly repetitive an interspersed sequence B1.
