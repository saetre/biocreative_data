The relative growth of the neocortex parallels the emergence of complex cognitive functions across species. To determine the regions of the mammalian genome responsible for natural variations in cortical volume, we conducted a complex trait analysis using 34 strains of recombinant inbred (Rl) strains of mice (BXD), as well as their two parental strains (C57BL/6J and DBA/2J). We measured both neocortical volume and total brain volume in 155 coronally sectioned mouse brains that were Nissl stained and embedded in celloidin. After correction for shrinkage, the measured cortical and noncortical brain volumes were entered into a multiple regression analysis, which removed the effects of body size and age from the measurements. Marker regression and interval mapping were computed using WebQTL.

An ANOVA revealed that more than half of the variance of these regressed phenotypes is genetically determined. We then identified the regions of the genome regulating this heritability. We located genomic regions in which a linkage disequilibrium was present using WebQTL as both a mapping engine and genomic database. For neocortex, we found a genome-wide significant quantitative trait locus (QTL) on chromosome 11 (marker D11Mit19), as well as a suggestive QTL on chromosome 16 (marker D16Mit100). In contrast, for noncortex the effect of chromosome 11 was markedly reduced, and a significant QTL appeared on chromosome 19 (D19Mit22).

This classic pattern of double dissociation argues strongly for different genetic factors regulating relative cortical size, as opposed to brain volume more generally. It is likely, however, that the effects of proximal chromosome 11 extend beyond the neocortex strictly defined. An analysis of single nucleotide polymorphisms in these regions indicated that ciliary neurotrophic factor (Cntf) is quite possibly the gene underlying the noncortical QTL. Evidence for a candidate gene modulating neocortical volume was much weaker, but Otx1 deserves further consideration.

The absolute and relative volumes of anatomically defined brain regions-such as the mammalian cerebral cortex-are of functional importance both within and across species [1-4]. In humans, the volume of the cerebral hemispheres ranges between 850 and 1380 cm3 in young adults [5]. Further, neocortical size is hereditarily specified, with over eighty percent of the variance of human neocortical gray matter volume being genetically determined [6]. At present, little is known about the genomic determinants of such natural variation.

Further, cognitive ability is related to neocortical size. For example, Reiss et al. showed that IQ is positively correlated with cerebral volume in children [7]. Thompson et al. provided evidence based on quantitative MRI volumetric measurements that not only is neocortical volume genetically determined (h2 > 0.8), but that Spearman's g, a measure of fluid intelligence, was significantly linked to frontal lobe neocortical volume. Similar findings also have been reported by Posthuma et al. [9].

These results provide evidence that neocortical volume is very much genetically determined and linked to cognitive abilities. However, such studies provide no evidence concerning the genomic mechanisms that underlie these highly heritable traits. For this all important question, quantitative neuroanatomical studies of the neocortex of recombinant inbred strains of mice provide one important path to unravelling the genomics of brain size. The discovery of the genes that differentially regulate neocortical volume is a primary question for contemporary cognitive neuroscience. The study of RI mice might provide some insight into this problem. Here, we report the first empirical study of this fundamental problem.

From these measurements, both in vivo cortical brain and in vivo noncortical brain volumes were calculated.

To assess the reliability of the stereological measurements, cortical brain area was remeasured blindly in 94 brain sections. The test-retest reliability coefficient indicated that the measurements were highly reliable (r = 0.984). Similarly, reliability for total fixed brain volume remeasured for twenty mice was also very high (r = 0.996).

The size of brain structure is not only regulated by structure-specific genes, but varies with other factors, which may include body weight (BW), age, and sex. To statistically remove these influences from our histological phenotypes, a multiple-regression analysis was performed using body weight, the logarithm of age, and sex as predictor variables, a standard procedure in QTL analysis. Body weight and the logarithm of age were the only significant predictor variables for in vivo cortical brain volume, yielding the following regression equation for adjusted cortical volume:

The linkage disequilibrium between a measured phenotypic trait, like regressed cortical volume or regressed noncortical volume, and any genomic marker can be measured using the likelihood ratio statistic (LRS). This is a quantitative estimate of the probability that each individual marker does or does not overlie one of the polygenes regulating the phenotypic trait.

We computed the LRS for each of 3,795 marker positions on chromosomes 1 through 19 as well as chromosome X, using webQTL as a genotype source and mapping engine [10,11]. Similar results were also obtain in preliminary analyses using the previous marker set containing 788 more sparsely distributed WebQTL markers.

The LRS depends upon the ratio of a model not incorporating information about the marker in question (the reduced model) to a model incorporating genetic information (the full model), as shown in Equation 3. In marker regression, the LRS for a particular marker is a function of the ratio of the sum of squared deviations from the mean for the phenotypic variable x to the sum of the squared deviations of the variable from the submeans that are obtained when the phenotypes are segregated according to the parental allele value at that marker:

The boundaries of each QTL were determined by examination of the distribution of the LRS scores of the markers surrounding the QTL peak. All peaks were well formed and sharp. Following Van Ooijen [13] we located the nearest markers for which the value of the LRS was reduced by at least 9.2 units, corresponding to the 95 percent confidence limits for the QTL. Kim et al. has recently confirmed that this method is both accurate and unbiased [14].

Brain size is known to vary with body size in a wide variety of species, including mice and other rodents [3,15]. However, an examination of the regression analyses reported above for phenotype versus predictor variables suggests that the covariation between brain volume and body size is very much weaker for cerebral cortex than it is for noncortical brain volume. We tested this relationship by first computing the Pearson product moment correlation coefficients for body weight and in vivo cortical volume (r = .224) and in vivo noncortical volume (r = .537). We then used Fisher's r-to-z transformation [[16], page 49] to statistically test for a significant difference between these correlations. The result provides evidence that the mammalian cerebral cortex is significantly less regulated by factors related to body size than are most other regions of the central nervous system (z = -3.235, p < 0.01).

QTL analyses provide the mechanism for locating genomic regions in which allele values are closely associated with a phenotypic trait. The results of the QTL analysis of 3,795 markers across the mouse genome for association with regressed cortical volume are shown in Figure 1. There are two prominent spikes in the LRS profile for residual cortical volume. Table 3 shows the LRS values produced by marker regression.

The most significant marker (p </= 0.05 genome-wide) is D11Mit19 at 25.4 megabases (mb) on chromosome 11. Two other nearby markers (S11Gnd020.100 and D11Mit135) also show suggestive association with regressed cortical volume. Because of the restricted genomic resolution afforded by the available number of recombinant inbred strains, we treat these three markers as reflective of a single QTL in the immediate vicinity of D11Mit19.
###end p 47

There is a second, suggestive QTL for residual cortical volume on chromosome 16. This is reflected by a linkage disequilibrium with two adjacent markers, D16Mit9 (6.0 mb) and D16Mit100 (11.5 mb). These markers on proximal chromosome 16 also contribute to the genetic specification of neocortical volume.

To estimate the minimal proportion of phenotypic variance accounted for by each of these two QTL markers, we calculated the partial eta squared () from an analysis of variance with the markers D11Mit19 and D16Mit100 and their interaction as factors. These proportions are 0.22 for D11Mit19 and 0.14 for D16Mit100. The proportion attributable to the interaction of the two markers was negligible.

There are significant and suggestive QTLs for regressed noncortical brain volume as well, two of which do not affect cortical volume, and the third affects both, but to differing degrees. Figure 2 presents the corresponding QTL analysis for regressed noncortical brain volume.

A significant association between this regressed noncortical volume and the mammalian genotype may be seen on proximal chromosome 19. This is most evident at marker D19Mit22 (10.0 mb), which reaches genome-wide significance on many - but not all - permutation tests. Because the results of all permutation tests vary slightly from sample to sample, any LRS score that lies within this narrow range will reach significance with some instances of the permutation test, but not others. Thus, we conclued that this QTL neither greatly exceeds nor falls far short of the genome-wide 0.05 significance level.

This QTL extends to neighboring markers D19Mit42 (9.4 mb) and D19Mit127 (12.1 mb). These markers appear to be indicative of a single QTL harboring one or more genes that regulate noncortical, but not cortical, brain size.

Composite interval mapping [17] can increase the sensitivity of a search for additional QTLs associated with a phenotype by incorporating the variance associated with previously identified significant QTLs to the background of the additive model. Composite interval maps were constructed for both residual phenotypes, but no additional QTLs emerged from these analyses.

The various strains of BXD mice differ considerably from each other in both cortical and noncortical brain volume. However, these two compartments of the mouse brain show quite different dependencies on body size. Nearly 30 percent of the variance in noncortical brain volume can be accounted for by body size in our data (see Striedter [19] for a history of the study of brain and body size).

In contrast, our measurements suggest that neocortical brain volume is much less dependent on body size, with only about 5 percent of that compartment being predictable from body weight. Neocortex appears to be regulated by factors that differ substantially from those regulating other regions of the central nervous system, a conclusion that complements recent observations made by Bush and Allman [4].

Our data suggest a more specific interpretation. Using our phenotypic data we can compare the the proportion of variance accounted for R2 on chromosome 11 at D11Mit19 for neocortex alone (0.34), whole brain volume or brain weight (0.29), and noncortex (0.21), all regressed for body weight and the logarithm of age. The R2 values are highest for neocortex, lowest for noncortex, and intermediate for the whole brain. It is clear that this QTL is not a generic determinant of brain size, but rather selectively exerts its effects on the neocortex and perhaps some adjacent forebrain structures such as the olfactory bulb.

Using the criteria described above, SNP filtering revealed polymorphisms in the coding or untranslated regulatory regions of twenty known genes. The filtered known genes within the chromosome 11 confidence interval for neocortex are E030025D05Rik, AW011752, 4931428D14Rik, C330012F17Rik, 2010316F05Rik, 2510006C20Rik, Stc2, Il9r, 3300001G02Rik, Rhbdf1, Mpg, Hba-x, A230090E05, Stk10, Fbxw1b, Fgf18, Gabrp, Kcnmb1, Dock2, and Vrk2.

A third possibility is that the gene is known, but was excluded in SNP filtering. Thus, it is of interest that there is a known gene within the QTL on chromosome 11 that is specifically related to neocortex development. Otx1 (chromosome 11 at 21.8 mb) plays a major and selective role in the development of the mammalian neocortex [21,22]. Otx1 is expressed early in development and provides a molecular basis for the development of the deep layers of the cerebral cortex, as well as in the development of the eye, olfactory system, and cochlea.

Otx1 is closely related to Otx2, which modulates the development of the mammalian brainstem. Interestingly, the expression of Otx2 is regulated by two distant enhancers, one located 75 kb upstream and the other 115 kb downstream from Otx2 itself on chromosome 14 [23]. If similar enhancers exist for Otx1, they would have been excluded by our SNP filtering procedure. A search of the Celera database reveals that there are 85 D/B SNPs within +/- 150 Kb of Otx1. If any of these SNPs lay within a putative Otx1 enhancer, it could provide a molecular basis for the QTL. Thus, Otx1 may still be a reasonable candidate gene mediating the effects of the chromosome 11 QTL for neocortical volume.

In the analysis of regressed noncortical volume, the single QTL detected with genome-wide significance was on proximal chromosome 19. This genomic region had absolutely no effect on regressed cortical volume. Thus, the data display a classical pattern of double dissociation: one factor that affects cortical volume more than noncortical volume and a second factor that shows the mirror image pattern. Double dissociation is an important criterion in neuropsychology, because it provides positive logical proof of the specificity of effects. The same argument can be made in the present case as well.

Ctnf is a one of the gp130 family of cytokines and acts as a survival factor for a number of different neuronal cell types. Originally discovered as a factor that supports the survival of parasympathetic nerve fibers in the ciliary ganglia, Ctnf is now known to play an active role in neuronal maintenance within the central nervous system [24]. Recent reports have also shown that Ctnf modulates central nervous system neurogenesis as well [25]. Thus, it is not unreasonable to conclude the genetically controlled natural variations in Ctnf expression might modulate brain size in BXD recombinant inbred mice. Ctnf is indeed a strong candidate gene for understanding the QTL on chromosome 19 related to noncortical brain volume.

Our localization of QTLs regulating neocortical size may have broader, more cognitive implications. Gibson, in a recent theoretical paper on brain size and mental capacity [[2], p.17], concludes: perhaps "those genetic factors that control enhanced brain size, especially the size of the sensori-motor control for the oral and manual organs, the neocortical association areas, the basal ganglia, and the cerebellum would emerge as the prime genetic determinants of the mental abilities of human infants." Properly designed QTL analyses using the appropriate behavioral phenotypic measures in recombinant inbred mice could help resolve this question.

In vivo cortical volume was determined for each mouse using the NIH ImageJ digital measurement system. First, the area of the neocortex as it appears in the serial sections was measured by manually tracing the neocortex. Since the boundary of the molecular layer was extremely variable in some images, the dorsal boundary of the neocortex was taken as the inner edge of the molecular layer, which was clearly discernable in all images. The resulting measurements were then corrected for molecular layer area by a factor determined from images in which both the inner and outer boundaries were clear. In the posterior coronal sections, the lateral boundary of the neocortex was taken as the neocortical-piriform cortex border.

Shrinkage during tissue processing is significant and variable, but can be compensated for to produce accurate estimates of in vivo cortical volume. To do so requires measuring the total volume of the processed specimens, which was calculated using ImageJ. The contrast and brightness of all digitized sections were adjusted to permit measurement using the ImageJ particle analysis feature. This automatic feature was highly reproducible. To correct each individual mouse brain for shrinkage, the measured specimen neocortical volume was multiplied by the ratio of fresh brain weight to measured total specimen brain volume, assuming a brain density of about 1.05 mg/mm3 in fixed tissue. This restores the volume lost from the fresh brain during histology. The average volumetric shrinkage was 64%, which corresponds to a linear shrinkage of 29%.

QTL Plot for Residual Neocortal Volume. The red upper line indicates the LRS value for genome-wide significant QTL and the lower grey line the level of suggestive QTL according to the criteria of Lander and Kruglyak [33]. There is a genome-wide significant linkage disequilibrium located in the proximal portion of chromosome 11. There is also a suggestive association on proximal chromosome 16. Notice that there is no significant association between neocortical volume and any marker on chromosome 19.

QTL Plot for Residual Noncortal Volume. Here, the effect of the QTL on proximal chromosome 11 is attenuated and no longer significant. There is a suggestive association on the distal portion of chromosome 15 and a significant QTL on chromosome 19. Thus, there is a double dissociation between neocortex and noncortex for significant QTLs on chromosomes 11 and 19.

Summary of neocortical and related phenotypic measures in 34 BXD recombinant inbred strains and their parental strains. Measured neocortical volume was corrected for the effects of shrinking produced by fixation and embedding in celloidin by multiplying each value by the ratio of the original brain weight to the measured fixed total brain volume. Since the specific gravity of fresh brain is just slightly more than 1.00, brain weight in grams can be taken as a close approximation of brain volume in cubic centimeters. Thus, in vivo brain volume was estimated by fresh brain weight in grams, as provided for each mouse by the Mouse Brain Library. Noncortical volume was estimated as measured total volume minus neocortical volume and was similarly corrected for shrinkage.

LRS for regressed cortical and noncortical volume. The criteria LRS values for regressed cortical volume are 21.18 (highly significant at the genome-wide 0.001 level), 17.37 (significant at the genome-wide 0.05 level) and 9.91 (suggestive), following the conventions of Lander and Kruglyak [33]. The corresponding values for regressed noncortical brain volume are 20.90 (highly significant), 17.00 (significant) and 9.89 (suggestive). Genome-wide highly significant findings are marked by double asterisks, significant findings by a single asterisk. Chromosomal position is given in megabases.
