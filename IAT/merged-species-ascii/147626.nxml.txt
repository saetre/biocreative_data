The murine parotid secretory protein (PSP) gene is expressed selectively at high levels in parotid and sublingual salivary glands. Previously, the transcriptional activity of a PSP mini-gene, called Lama, was shown to be dependent on a 1.5 kb region located 3 kb upstream of the transcription start site. Here, functional studies in transgenic mice demonstrate that this proximal regulatory region has properties of a parotid and sublingual gland specific enhancer. Protein-binding experiments identify multiple sequence-specific binding complexes spanning the entire 1.5 kb enhancer region. Several sequence elements bound specifically by parotid and/or sublingual gland nuclear extracts, including consensus binding elements for previously described transcription factors as well as novel binding elements are located in the proximal enhancer region. A deletion analysis of the enhancer region in transgenic mice identified a core sequence of 700 bp. This region contains five elements bound specifically by nuclear proteins isolated from the PSP-expressing parotid and sublingual glands. Two of these elements, denoted parotid gland element I (PGE I) and sublingual gland element I (SLE I), are novel salivary gland specific binding elements, bound uniquely by parotid and sublingual gland nuclear extracts, respectively.
