Introduction

###begin p 3
Sox9 and p300 cooperate to induce expression of cartilage-specific matrix proteins, including type II collagen, aggrecan and link protein. Tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, found in arthritic joints, activates nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB), whereas retinoic acid receptors (RARs) are activated by retinoid agonists, including all-trans retinoic acid (atRA). Like Sox9, the activity of NF-kappaB and RARs depends upon their association with p300. Separately, both TNF-alpha and atRA suppress cartilage matrix gene expression. We investigated how TNF-alpha and atRA alter the expression of cartilage matrix genes.

Primary cultures of rat chondrocytes were treated with TNF-alpha and/or atRA for 24 hours. Levels of transcripts encoding cartilage matrix proteins were determined by Northern blot analyses and quantitative real-time PCR. Nuclear protein levels, DNA binding and functional activity of transcription factors were assessed by immunoblotting, electrophoretic mobility shift assays and reporter assays, respectively.

Together, TNF-alpha and atRA diminished transcript levels of cartilage matrix proteins and Sox9 activity more than each factor alone. However, neither agent altered nuclear levels of Sox9, and TNF-alpha did not affect protein binding to the Col2a1 48-base-pair minimal enhancer sequence. The effect of TNF-alpha, but not that of atRA, on Sox9 activity was dependent on NF-kappaB activation. Furthermore, atRA reduced NF-kappaB activity and DNA binding. To address the role of p300, we over-expressed constitutively active mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase (caMEKK)1 to increase p300 acetylase activity. caMEKK1 enhanced basal NF-kappaB activity and atRA-induced RAR activity. Over-expression of caMEKK1 also enhanced basal Sox9 activity and suppressed the inhibitory effects of TNF-alpha and atRA on Sox9 function. In addition, over-expression of p300 restored Sox9 activity suppressed by TNF-alpha and atRA to normal levels.

Conclusion
###end title 8
###begin p 9
NF-kappaB and RARs converge to reduce Sox9 activity and cartilage matrix gene expression, probably by limiting the availability of p300. This process may be critical for the loss of cartilage matrix synthesis in inflammatory joint diseases. Therefore, agents that increase p300 levels or activity in chondrocytes may be useful therapeutically.

Members of the Sry-type high mobility group box (Sox) transcription factor family are regulators of tissue-specific gene expression (for review, see Wegner [1]). A subset of Sox proteins is responsible for controlling cartilage development and chondrocyte function by regulating the expression of specific matrix genes. L-Sox5, Sox6 and Sox9 are necessary regulators for induction and maintenance of cartilage-specific collagen expression by chondrocytes [2]. L-Sox5 and Sox6 heterodimerize via inherent leucine zippers and bind DNA, but they lack transactivation domains necessary to control transcription. In contrast, Sox9 contains a carboxyl-terminal transactivation domain and probably serves to regulate gene transcription directly. Consequently, L-Sox5 and Sox6 synergize with Sox9 to induce transcription of the type II collagen gene by binding to the 48-base-pair (bp) minimal enhancer region [2-4]. Sox9 also coordinates expression of two other cartilage extracellular matrix molecules, aggrecan and link protein, through activity at regulatory regions of each gene [5,6].

Homeostatic maintenance of mature cartilage is characterized by continual production and degradation of extracellular matrix, processes that are coordinated in chondrocytes via factors such as the Sox proteins. In contrast, cartilage degeneration in joint diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis and osteoarthritis results from a shift in this balance toward catabolism. One factor found in the synovial fluid of rheumatoid and osteoarthritic patients is the inflammatory cytokine tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha [7-9]. In addition to upregulating the expression of catabolic factors such as matrix metalloproteinases and aggrecanases [10,11], TNF-alpha downregulates expression of transcripts for type II collagen, aggrecan and link protein by chondrocytes [12-14]. Signalling events that mediate these changes in gene expression include activation of nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB), extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1/2 and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase pathways, and decreases in Sox9 protein expression [13-15].

Inhibitor of NF-kappaB (IkappaB) mask the nuclear localization signal on NF-kappaB. When cells are stimulated by TNF-alpha, IkappaB is phosphorylated by activated IkappaB kinase. Phosphorylated IkappaB is ubiquitinated and degraded by the 26S proteasome, permitting NF-kappaB isoforms to homodimerize or heterodimerize, enter the nucleus and alter gene transcription (for review, see Karin and Ben-Neriah [16]). Preventing the activation of NF-kappaB allows Sox9 to retain its full activity at the type II collagen enhancer in the presence of TNF-alpha [13], suggesting a relationship between these transcription factors.

Some transcription factors can be directly regulated by binding of membrane-permeable agonists. An example of such an agonist is all-trans retinoic acid (atRA), a metabolite of vitamin A, that is bound preferentially by the alpha, beta and gamma retinoic acid receptors (RARs) [17]. RARs act as homodimers or heterodimers with members of the retinoid X receptor family to transactivate genes.

Regulation of retinoid signalling is critical for the development and maintenance of cartilage. In chondroprogenitor cells, activation of retinoid receptors, particularly RARalpha, decreases Sox9 activity at the type II collagen enhancer and reduces the content of glycosaminoglycans in the extracellular matrix. Moreover, treatment of equine articular cartilage explants with atRA results in loss of glycosaminoglycans as a consequence of reduced proteoglycan synthesis [18]. Furthermore, mice fed a diet high in retinyl acetate, a synthetic derivative of vitamin A, exhibit cartilage atrophy and other osteoarthritic characteristics [19]. In addition, increasing retinoid levels in humans accelerates hypertrophy of chondrocytes and ossification (hyperostosis), which contributes to the progression of degenerative joint diseases [20]. Thus, retinoids, including atRA, appear to have negative effects on matrix synthesis and homeostasis in cartilage.

Interestingly, adult mice fed diets deficient in vitamin A exhibit generalized increases in basal NF-kappaB activity [21]. Upon administration of retinoic acid, NF-kappaB activity is reduced, which suggests an effect of RARs on function rather than expression of NF-kappaB. Recombinant NF-kappaB p65 and members of both the RAR and retinoid X receptor families of retinoic acid receptors associate with each other in vitro [22]. Furthermore, addition of an atRA analogue to macrophage cell extracts decreases TNF-alpha-induced binding of NF-kappaB to DNA [22]. Consistent with these results, administration of atRA reduces joint destruction in collagen-induced inflammatory arthritis [23].

Co-factors associated with regulatory transcription factors play vital roles in the transactivation of genes. Sox9, NF-kappaB and RARs share the common co-factor p300, an acetylase that is required for full activity of these transcription factors [24-26]. In the present study, we investigated the mechanism by which such transcription factors integrate to regulate gene expression. We determined the effect of co-activation of NF-kappaB and RARs on Sox9 function and cartilage matrix gene expression. We found that atRA and TNF-alpha signalling converge in the nucleus to promote greater reductions in Sox9 activity and matrix gene expression than signalling from each alone. These reductions in Sox9 activity are consistent with limitation in the availability of p300 for Sox9 when NF-kappaB and RARs are also activated. Thus, agents that promote p300 activity or availability may be useful therapeutically to maintain cartilage matrix production in inflammatory joint disease.

Primary chondrocytes were isolated (8 to 12 x 105 cells/rat) from the femoral condyles of 1-day-old Sprague Dawley rats (Charles River, St. Hyacinthe, Quebec, Canada), as described previously [13]. The Animal Use Subcommittee of the University of Western Ontario Council on Animal Care approved the use of rats in these studies. Chondrocytes were plated on tissue culture plastic (Falcon, Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA) at a density of 3.0 to 4.25 x 104 cells/cm2 and grown in RPMI-1640 media supplemented with 5% foetal bovine serum, 100 U/ml penicillin, 100 mug/ml streptomycin and 10 mmol/l HEPES (Invitrogen Life Technologies Inc., Burlington, Ontario, Canada). The medium was changed every 3 days until cultures reached confluence, typically after 6 to 8 days.

Total RNA was isolated using Trizol (Invitrogen Life Technologies Inc.) and quantified spectrophotometrically. Northern blot hybridizations were performed as described previously [13] using probes corresponding to the C-propeptide of mouse type II collagen (pKN225) [3], rat aggrecan core protein (p1353) [27] and mouse 18S rRNA (Ambion, Austin, TX, USA), radiolabelled with [alpha32P]-dCTP (3000 Ci/mmol; NEN, Boston, MA, USA) using a random-primed oligonucleotide method (Prime-a-gene labeling kit; Promega, Madison, WI, USA). For quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) analysis, total RNA was processed using an RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen, Mississauga, Ontario, Canada). Amplification reactions were prepared by adding RNA (25 ng) to TaqMan One Step RT-PCR Master Mix (4309169; Applied Biosystems Inc., Streetsville, Ontario, Canada) containing primers to rat type II collagen (Rn00564954_m1), aggrecan 1 (Rn00573424_m1), link protein (Rn00569884_m1), or GAPDH (glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase; 4308313; Applied Biosystems Inc.). Reverse transcription and qPCR reactions were performed in a Prism 7900 HT Sequence Detector (Applied Biosystems Inc.). Briefly, samples were incubated for 30 min at 48degreesC to make cDNA templates, followed by a maximum of 40 amplification cycles, alternating between 95degreesC for 15 seconds and 60degreesC for 1 minute. Results were analyzed using SDS v2.1 software (Applied Biosystems Inc.).

Cells from confluent cultures were detached using trypsin-EDTA (Invitrogen Life Technologies Inc.), pelleted, resuspended in serum-free culture medium, plated into 48-well dishes (3.4 x 104 cells/well) and transfected with reporter plasmids. The reporter plasmids included the following: a kappaB reporter (BD Biosciences, Mississauga, Ontario, Canada), comprising four tandem repeats of the kappaB response element upstream of the firefly luciferase reporter sequence, expressed upon NF-kappaB activation; a retinoic acid response element (RARE) firefly luciferase reporter (pWl-beta RARE3-luc), regulated by activation of RARs via retinoic acid [28]; and a type II collagen enhancer luciferase reporter containing four repeats of the 48-bp minimal enhancer of the type II collagen gene (pGL3 [4 x 48]) [28], each with a binding site for Sox9. Previous studies have shown that multiple repeats of the minimal enhancer are required for optimal output [29]. For some experiments, chondrocytes were co-transfected with reporter constructs and expression constructs for constitutively active mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase (caMEKK)1 (Clontech, Mountain View, CA, USA), a phosphorylation site-deficient IkappaB (IkappaB-2N; pSVK3-IkappaB-2NDelta4) [30], or p300. In all experiments, chondrocytes were co-transfected with a 0.002 mug renilla luciferase plasmid (pRL-SV40; Promega), which was used in most cases to control for transfection efficiency.

After 24 hours of incubation in serum-containing culture medium, chondrocytes were incubated in serum-free medium (control medium), TNF-alpha (Sigma Aldrich, Mississauga, Ontario, Canada), atRA (Sigma Aldrich), or a combination of TNF-alpha and atRA for 24 hours.

Confluent cultures were serum-deprived overnight before addition of TNF-alpha and/or atRA for 24 hours. Nuclear extracts were prepared using a method modified from that reported by Dignam and coworkers [31], as previously described [13]. Equal concentrations (30 mug) of nuclear protein extracts were resolved by electrophoresis on 7.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gels. Proteins were transferred onto nitrocellulose membrane (Protran; Schleicher & Schuell, Keene, NH, USA) by electroblotting, and equivalency of loading was verified by staining with Ponceau red. Membranes were blocked in 5% nonfat milk (Carnation, North York, Ontario, Canada) in Tris-buffered saline plus 0.05% Tween 20 for 1 hour, followed by incubation with the primary antibody overnight in blocking buffer. Membranes were washed with Tris-buffered saline plus 0.05% Tween 20 and incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody. Protein-antibody complexes were visualized using SuperSignal West Pico Chemiluminescent Substrate (Pierce Biotechnology Inc.), followed by exposure to Hyperfilm-ECL (Amersham Biosciences, Baie D'Urfe, Quebec, Canada). Membranes were stripped using 1 mol/l glycine pH 2.5 before re-probing. For NF-kappaB p65 and RARalpha immunoblots, relative band intensities were calculated as the ratio of the band intensity of NF-kappaB p65 or RARalpha to that of beta-catenin that served as a loading control.

We first investigated how expression of extracellular matrix genes responded to TNF-alpha and atRA. Chondrocytes were treated for 24 hours with TNF-alpha and/or increasing concentrations of atRA. Following treatment, transcript levels of type II collagen, aggrecan core protein and link protein were determined by Northern blot analysis and/or qPCR (Figure 1). TNF-alpha significantly reduced levels of type II collagen, aggrecan core protein and link protein mRNA. Treatment of cells with atRA reduced mRNA levels of all three matrix genes in a concentration-dependent manner. Interestingly, co-treatment of cells with TNF-alpha and atRA decreased levels of these transcripts more than each factor alone. These results suggest that signalling from TNF-alpha and atRA converge to influence the activity of transcription factors, such as Sox9, that are necessary for the expression of cartilage matrix genes.

Effects of TNF-alpha and atRA on matrix gene expression. Chondrocytes were treated with or without tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha (30 ng/ml) and/or all-trans retinoic acid (atRA; 1, 10, or 100 nmol/l) for 24 hours. Total RNA was evaluated for aggrecan core protein (ACP), type II collagen (Col2a1) and 18S rRNA by (a) Northern blot analysis and by (b, c) quantitative real-time PCR, whereas link protein mRNA was evaluated only by (d) quantitative real-time PCR. TNF-alpha and atRA alone decreased aggrecan, type II collagen and link protein transcript levels. Co-treatment with TNF-alpha and atRA further decreased mRNA transcript levels of aggrecan, type II collagen and link protein. Panel a: Northern blots are representative of three independent experiments; 18S rRNA levels were used to verify equal loading. Panels b to d: data are ratios of matrix gene: Gapdh transcript levels normalized as a fraction of the ratios in untreated cultures (first bar), and are expressed as means +/- standard error (the number of independent experiments was seven for panel b, five for panel c, and five for panel d). Data were evaluated by one-way analysis of variance and Tukey's multiple comparisons test.

We investigated the activity of Sox9 using a reporter construct based on the type II collagen minimal enhancer (Figure 2a). TNF-alpha significantly reduced Sox9 reporter activity (approximately 47%). Sox9 reporter activity also decreased with increasing concentrations of atRA. At 10-9 mol/l atRA, co-treatment with TNF-alpha resulted in a further decrease in Sox9 reporter activity, which is consistent with the observed changes in expression of cartilage matrix protein transcripts.

Effects of TNF-alpha and atRA on Sox9 activity. Chondrocytes were transfected with (a) the type II collagen enhancer luciferase reporter and some cultures were also co-transfected with (b) a phosphorylation site-deficient inhibitor of nuclear factor-kappaB (IkappaB-2N). Cultures were then treated with or without tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha (30 ng/ml) and/or all-trans retinoic acid (atRA; 1, 10, or 100 nmol/l) for 24 hours. Panels a: TNF-alpha and atRA separately decreased Sox9 activity. Greater decreases in Sox9 activity were induced by treatment with TNF-alpha and atRA (1 nmol/l). Panel b: IkappaB-2N did not significantly increase basal levels of Sox9 activity (1.3 +/- 0.2 fold increase [mean +/- standard deviation]) compared with untreated cells transfected with Sox9 reporter only (P > 0.05). IkappaB-2N attenuated the effect of TNF-alpha on Sox9 activity, but regulation of Sox9 activity by atRA was maintained. Data are ratios of Sox9-regulated firefly luciferase units to constitutive SV40-regulated renilla luciferase units, normalized as a fraction of the ratios in untreated cultures (first bar), and are expressed as means +/- standard error (the number of independent experiments was six for panel a and four for panel b). Data were evaluated by repeated measures analysis of variance and Tukey's multiple comparisons test.

Previously, we found that regulation of Sox9 activity at the type II collagen enhancer was dependent on NF-kappaB activation [13]. To determine whether the effects of TNF-alpha and atRA were both mediated by NF-kappaB, we restricted NF-kappaB nuclear translocation by over-expression of IkappaB-2N - an IkappaBalpha that is resistant to phosphorylations required for NF-kappaB release (Figure 2b). IkappaB-2N did not significantly alter basal Sox9 activity or the reduction of Sox9 activity following atRA treatment alone. In contrast, IkappaB-2N did eliminate the further reduction observed in the presence of both TNF-alpha and atRA (10-9 mol/l). These results indicate that reduction of Sox9 activity by atRA is independent of NF-kappaB activation.

Since Sox9 activity was decreased by TNF-alpha and atRA, we determined whether there were changes in protein complex binding to the Col2a1 48-bp minimal enhancer sequence or alterations in nuclear levels of Sox9. Chondrocytes were treated with TNF-alpha and nuclear extracts were analyzed by EMSA. TNF-alpha did not change the amount of protein complex bound to the 48-bp minimal enhancer sequence (Figure 3a). In addition, TNF-alpha and atRA (alone or in combination) did not change nuclear levels of Sox9 assessed by immunoblot (Figure 3b). Taken together, these findings indicate that the observed changes in Sox9 activity are independent of changes in DNA binding or nuclear protein levels.

Effect of TNF-alpha on Sox9-DNA binding and Sox9 nuclear protein levels. (a) Chondrocytes were treated for 24 hours with or without tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha (30 ng/ml). Nuclear extracts (10 mug) were incubated with double-stranded 32P-labelled oligonucleotides corresponding to the Col2a1 minimal enhancer sequence and resolved on a 4% polyacrylamide gel. Where indicated, excess unlabelled specific oligonucleotides (a: 40x or b: 80x) were added as competitors. TNF-alpha did not change the amount of protein complex (arrowhead) bound to the oligonucleotide. Results shown are representative of three independent experiments. (b) Chondrocytes were treated for 24 hours with or without TNF-alpha (30 ng/ml) and/or atRA (100 nmol/l). Nuclear extracts (30 mug) were resolved on a 7.5% polyacrylamide gel and immunoblotted with antibody recognizing Sox9. The 64 kDa band corresponding to Sox9 (arrowhead) was quantified by densitometry. Data were normalized as a fraction of band density in untreated chondrocytes and are expressed as means +/- standard error (three independent experiments). Data were evaluated by one-way analysis of variance. There was no significant change in the level of Sox9 nuclear protein (P > 0.05).

On their own, TNF-alpha (30 ng/ml) and atRA (10-9 mol/l) reduced Sox-9 activity by about 50%, and together activity was reduced by about 75% (Figure 2a). Because their effects were not completely additive, we determined whether there are interactions between atRA and TNF-alpha signalling that influence NF-kappaB or RAR activity. Chondrocytes were transfected with a kappaB luciferase reporter construct and were treated with TNF-alpha and/or atRA (Figure 4a). As expected, TNF-alpha induced NF-kappaB activity. atRA alone had no effect on basal NF-kappaB activity. However, atRA significantly inhibited TNF-alpha-activated NF-kappaB activity, suggesting that active RARs suppress NF-kappaB activity.

We next evaluated whether activation of NF-kappaB influences RAR function. Chondrocytes were transfected with a RARE reporter and treated with TNF-alpha and/or atRA (Figure 4b). As expected, atRA increased RAR activity in a concentration-dependent manner. TNF-alpha did not change basal or atRA-induced RAR activity. Thus, under these conditions, NF-kappaB had no inhibitory effect on RAR activity.

To define further the inhibitory effect of atRA on NF-kappaB activity, we examined the effects of atRA on nuclear localization of NF-kappaB and its affinity for DNA. The presence of NF-kappaB p65 in nuclear extracts from chondrocytes treated with TNF-alpha and/or atRA was analyzed by immunoblot (Figure 5). TNF-alpha, but not atRA, induced nuclear localization of the NF-kappaB p65 isoform (Figure 5a,b). Furthermore, in the presence of TNF-alpha, treatment of cells with atRA did not significantly reduce the amount of nuclear p65. Moreover, no significant changes in nuclear levels of RARalpha protein were observed (Figure 5a,c). Thus, reduction in functional activity of NF-kappaB was not associated with changes in nuclear levels of NF-kappaB p65 or RARalpha.

We next evaluated the possibility that RAR activation changes the binding of NF-kappaB to DNA. Nuclear extracts of cells treated with TNF-alpha and/or atRA were analyzed by EMSA and supershift/antibody interference assays (Figure 6). TNF-alpha, but not atRA, induced formation of a complex bound to the kappaB consensus site that contained the NF-kappaB p65 isoform. Interestingly, addition of anti-RARalpha antibody reduced the TNF-alpha-activated complex, indicating that RARalpha is a member of this complex (Figure 6; compare lanes 2 and 4, and lanes 10 and 12). Furthermore, atRA decreased the intensity of TNF-alpha-activated complexes bound to the kappaB consensus site (Figure 6; compare lanes 2 and 8 to 10). When chondrocytes were treated with both TNF-alpha and atRA, the complex that remained bound to DNA contained p65 and RARalpha (Figure 6; compare lanes 10, 11 and 12). Taken together, we conclude that atRA binding to RARalpha decreases the affinity for DNA of the p65/RARalpha complex that is formed in response to TNF-alpha.

Chondrocytes were treated with or without tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha (30 ng/ml) and/or all-trans retinoic acid (atRA; 1, 10, or 100 nmol/l) for 24 hours. Nuclear extracts were incubated with 32P-radiolabelled kappaB consensus DNA and resolved on a 4% polyacrylamide gel. TNF-alpha induced the formation of a complex of proteins that contained both nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) p65 and retinoic acid receptor (RAR)alpha bound to the kappaB consensus site (a, lane 2). Addition of antibody against NF-kappaB p65 gave rise to a supershifted complex (b, lanes 3 and 11). Antibody against RARalpha interfered with binding of the complex to DNA (lanes 4 and 12). atRA decreased the amount of TNF-alpha-activated complex bound to the kappaB consensus site in a concentration-dependent manner (lanes 8 to 10). The TNF-alpha-activated complex that remained bound in the presence of atRA (0.1 mumol/l) contained p65 and RARalpha (lanes 11 and 12).

Changes in transcription factor function can result from alterations in the level or activity of the transcription factor itself or of its required co-factors. Active MEKK1 induces NF-kappaB nuclear localization by promoting the degradation of IkappaB [32]. In addition, MEKK1 phosphorylates p300, increasing its histone acetylase activity [33]. Thus, the effect of active MEKK1 on NF-kappaB and RAR activity was investigated.

Chondrocytes were co-transfected with a caMEKK1 expression construct and either kappaB or RARE reporter constructs (Figure 7). caMEKK1 dramatically increased basal NF-kappaB activity. For example, basal NF-kappaB activity was enhanced approximately 24-fold in the experiment shown (compare first columns in Figure 7a and Figure 4a from the same representative experiment; P < 0.001). Treatment of caMEKK1-transfected chondrocytes with TNF-alpha did not further increase NF-kappaB activity; however, activity levels were still 4-fold greater than those in cells transfected with reporter alone and treated with TNF-alpha (compare second columns in Figure 7a and Figure 4a). Interestingly, treatment of caMEKK1-transfected chondrocytes with atRA, alone or in combination with TNF-alpha, did not reduce NF-kappaB activity (Figure 7a). Thus, NF-kappaB function was maximized by caMEKK1 and was also protected from inhibition by atRA.

RAR activity was not altered by expression of caMEKK1 in either the absence or presence of TNF-alpha (compare first two columns in Figure 7b and Figure 4b). In contrast, atRA-induced RAR activity was increased approximately 11-fold in caMEKK1-transfected chondrocytes compared with cells transfected with reporter alone (compare Figure 7b and Figure 4b; P < 0.001). To determine the effect of NF-kappaB activation by caMEKK1 on RAR function, cells were co-transfected with caMEKK1 and IkappaB-2N. IkappaB-2N inhibits NF-kappaB activation but should not affect other signalling events initiated by caMEKK1. As expected, IkappaB-2N inhibited NF-kappaB activity induced by caMEKK1 (Figure 7a). Surprisingly, IkappaB-2N dramatically increased atRA-induced RAR activity in MEKK1-transfected cells (Figure 7b).

In summary, caMEKK1 increases the functional activity of both NF-kappaB and atRA-induced RARs. Furthermore, in caMEKK1 expressing cells, atRA does not reduce NF-kappaB function. Finally, inhibition of NF-kappaB further enhances the effect of caMEKK1 on atRA-induced RAR function. It is likely that the caMEKK1-induced increases in NF-kappaB and RAR activity are mediated by hyperactivation of p300.

To investigate the effect of caMEKK1 expression on Sox9 functional activity, cells were co-transfected with the caMEKK1 expression construct and the Sox9 reporter. Over-expression of caMEKK1 significantly increased basal Sox9 activity compared with cells lacking caMEKK1. A comparison of the non-normalized data from the first columns of Figure 8a and Figure 2a revealed that caMEKK1 increased Sox9 activity by 3.7 +/- 0.7 fold (mean +/- standard deviation; P < 0.01; data are from the same series of experiments). Moreover, in contrast to the reductions in Sox9 activity observed in cells lacking caMEKK1 (Figure 2a), TNF-alpha significantly increased Sox9 activity (Figure 8a). atRA significantly reduced Sox9 activity in cells expressing caMEKK1, but only at the highest concentration used (Figure 8a). In summary, caMEKK1 increased Sox9 functional activity, as it did NF-kappaB and RAR functional activity. caMEKK1 also reversed the inhibitory effect of TNF-alpha on Sox9 activity. Finally, the sensitivity of Sox9 to atRA was reduced by caMEKK1 expression. Thus, the activity state of p300, the common co-factor and MEKK1 target, probably plays a vital role in regulating Sox9, NF-kappaB and RAR function.

Effect of caMEKK1 and ectopic p300 on Sox9 activity. (a) Chondrocytes were co-transfected with the Sox9 reporter and constitutively active mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase (caMEKK)1 expression vector and treated for 24 hours with or without tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha (30 ng/ml) and/or all-trans retinoic acid (atRA; 1, 10, or 100 nmol/l). TNF-alpha significantly increased Sox9 activity, whereas the highest concentration of atRA decreased Sox9 activity. Co-treatment with atRA and TNF-alpha resulted in Sox9 activity levels equivalent to that observed in untreated cultures containing caMEKK1 (first bar). Data are ratios of Sox9-regulated firefly luciferase units to renilla luciferase units normalized as a fraction of the ratio in untreated cultures (first bar), and are expressed as means +/- standard error. Data were evaluated by repeated measures analysis of variance and Tukey's multiple comparisons test (three independent experiments). Bars labelled with the same lower case letters are not significantly different (P > 0.05). (b) Chondrocytes were transfected with Sox9 reporter alone (closed bars) or in combination with p300 expression vector (open bars) and then treated with TNF-alpha and/or atRA, as indicated. Co-transfection with the p300 expression vector significantly increased Sox9 activity in comparison with similarly treated normal cells (* significant effect of p300, P < 0.05). Under most conditions, over-expression of p300 also maintained Sox9 activity at a level comparable to that observed in normal, untreated chondrocytes (first closed bar). Data are Sox9-regulated luciferase units normalized to level in normal, untreated chondrocytes. #Significant difference compared with the first closed bar (P < 0.05).

We next investigated directly whether availability of p300 contributes to the reduction in Sox9 activity induced by activation of NF-kappaB and RARs. Cells were co-transfected with the Sox9 reporter and a p300 expression construct. Cells over-expressing p300 exhibited significantly increased Sox9 activity compared with cells transfected with Sox9 reporter alone (Figure 8b). Ectopic p300 expression did not prevent reductions in Sox9 activity in response to TNF-alpha and atRA. However, under most conditions, over-expression of p300 maintained Sox9 activity at a level comparable to that observed in normal, untreated chondrocytes. Thus, increasing the availability of p300 increases Sox9 activity even when NF-kappaB and RARs are active.

Sox9 is required for expression of cartilage matrix genes [4-6]. We demonstrated a reduction in Sox9 activity after treatment with atRA or TNF-alpha, consistent with previous reports of the individual effects of these factors in condensing mesenchymal cells and articular chondrocytes [13,28]. We extended these studies by treating chondrocytes with both atRA and TNF-alpha, revealing a further decrease in Sox9 activity compared with each factor alone. Such a loss could be attributable to either a reduction in Sox9 protein level or altered activity. However, we found no effect of TNF-alpha or atRA on Sox9 nuclear protein levels. Moreover, TNF-alpha did not alter the level of protein complexes bound to the Col2a1 48-bp minimal enhancer sequence. Consistent with these findings, previous studies have shown that levels and stability of Sox9 mRNA are not altered over a 24-hour period following treatment of mouse chondrocytes with 0.1 mumol/l atRA [34], which is the highest concentration used in the present study. In other studies, TNF-alpha partially reduces Sox9 protein levels over a period of 8 hours through a NF-kappaB-dependent, post-transcriptional mechanism in mouse chondrocytes [15,35]. In our system, changes in activity of Sox9 in response to TNF-alpha and atRA are probably due to alternate modes of regulation, independent of changes in protein levels or DNA binding.

For full gene transactivation function, Sox9 requires the recruitment of the histone acetylase p300 [25,36]. p300 is a common co-factor that is required by multiple transcription factors, including Sox9, NF-kappaB and RARs, for full activity. In the present study, ectopic expression of p300 increased basal Sox9 activity. Moreover, increasing p300 levels maintained Sox9 activity in the presence of TNF-alpha and atRA, at a level comparable to that observed in normal, untreated cells. The over-expression of p300 did not attenuate the reductions in Sox9 activity induced by NF-kappaB and RAR activation, suggesting that greater expression of p300 is necessary to overcome these reductions. In contrast, caMEKK1, which hyperactivates p300, attenuated the reductions in Sox9 activity; this suggests that both p300 levels and activity are limiting in chondrocytes.

Further evidence that p300 is a limiting co-factor in chondrocytes comes from studies of genetically modified mice. Animals heterozygous for p300 or its closely related family member Cbp exhibit growth abnormalities, including defects in bone and cartilage [37,38]. Consequently, activation of transcription factors that sequester p300 (such as NF-kappaB and RARs) may suppress cartilage matrix synthesis.

Reductions in p300 availability or activity may contribute to the teratogenic effects of retinoids. Imbalances in atRA have major effects on chondrocyte development. atRA inhibits the expression of Sox9 in chondroprogenitor cells, resulting in major cartilage and bone abnormalities [39]. In addition, acute arthritic symptoms can arise when patients are treated with retinoids for dermatologic disorders such as acne [40,41], which is consistent with the effects of retinoids in mice [19] and is possibly due to reduced cartilage matrix production [18].

In the present study we observed decreases in the functional activity of NF-kappaB in the presence of atRA, which is consistent with the decreases in NF-kappaB/DNA interactions seen in macrophages treated with the atRA analogue TTNPB. In addition, over-expression of p300 rescues NF-kappaB activity reduced by 9-cis RA activation of retinoid X receptors [22]. Our results suggest that atRA-activated RARs not only limit p300 availability for Sox9 but also limit its availability for activated NF-kappaB. On the other hand, NF-kappaB activation can influence retinoid responsive elements. For example, over-expression of NF-kappaB p50 or p65 decreases 9-cis RA-activated retinoid X receptor activity in macrophages [22]. However, we found no reciprocal reduction in RAR activity when chondrocytes were treated with both TNF-alpha and atRA.

Regulation of transcription factor activity by p300
###end title 73
###begin p 74
Differences in the affinity for p300 may contribute to the pattern of regulation of transcription factor activity observed in the present study. Because atRA reduced both Sox9 and NF-kappaB activity in chondrocytes, active RARs may have a higher affinity for p300 compared with Sox9 or NF-kappaB. Thus, active RARs would be able to transactivate genes optimally, even when NF-kappaB has translocated to the nucleus. NF-kappaB and Sox9 appear to have similar command of p300, because Sox9 activity was reduced by approximately 50% when NF-kappaB was activated. However, the demand for p300 is controlled not only by relative affinity but also by relative stoichiometry of the transcription factors activated in the nucleus.

Manipulating the acetylase activity of p300 can reveal its role in regulating the function of transcription factors. In the present study, caMEKK1 enhanced the functional activities of NF-kappaB, RARs and Sox9. One explanation for these increases is post-translational modification of p300. p300 is phosphorylated in both the carboxyl-terminal and amino-terminal regions by a kinase in the MEKK1 pathway, resulting in increased acetylase activity [33]. In the present study, caMEKK1 increased NF-kappaB, atRA-induced RAR and Sox9 activity, suggesting that hyperactive p300 can circumvent its own limiting levels.

Another explanation for increased transcription factor activity in response to active MEKK1 is increased nuclear translocation of specific transcription factors. Active MEKK1 initiates the degradation of IkappaB, freeing NF-kappaB to enter the nucleus [32,42]. Therefore, the maximization of NF-kappaB activity induced by caMEKK1 observed in the present study may result from activating more NF-kappaB than is possible with TNF-alpha alone. Under basal conditions, NF-kappaB activation did not reduce RAR activity; however, when NF-kappaB was maximally activated by caMEKK1, it did suppress RAR activity. This effect is likely due to increased nuclear NF-kappaB sequestering a greater proportion of p300.
###end p 76
###begin p 77
The additional increases to Sox9 activity induced by caMEKK1 and TNF-alpha observed in the present study suggest other post-translational modifications to Sox9 or p300 by signals initiated by TNF-alpha that are independent of hyperactivated p300. The possible mechanisms associated with this regulation require further investigation.

Increases in transcription factor activity can also result from direct acetylation by p300, as seen with NF-kappaB [43]. Human NF-kappaB p65 has three lysine (K) residues that are targets of acetylation by p300, each serving a different role. Acetylation of K221 is required for DNA binding and, in conjunction with acetylation of K218, inhibits association with IkappaBalpha. Reduced p300 availability or activity would decrease acetylation at the K221 site, thereby suppressing NF-kappaB binding to DNA. This mechanism could contribute to the reduction in binding to DNA of the TNF-alpha-activated complex observed under conditions in which chondrocytes were subjected to both TNF-alpha and atRA. Acetylation at K218 is probably unaffected, because we did not observe any changes in nuclear localization of NF-kappaB p65 in the presence of both TNF-alpha and atRA. More interestingly, acetylation of K310 is required for full NF-kappaB transcriptional activity. Hyperactivation of p300 induced by caMEKK1 could cause changes in NF-kappaB acetylation, leading to maximal NF-kappaB functional activity. In particular, increased acetylation of K310 may explain part of the increase in NF-kappaB activity that we observed when caMEKK1 is expressed in the chondrocytes. Thus, active MEKK1 may increase the acetylase function of p300, allowing associated transcription factors (such as those studied here) to overcome the limiting levels of p300 and increase their activity.

Conclusion
###end title 79
###begin p 80
In this study, we investigated how active transcription factors, sharing common co-factors, regulate gene expression. We have shown that Sox9 activity and expression of cartilage matrix genes are limited by coincident activation of NF-kappaB and RARs. We have also shown that Sox9 activity can be maintained in the presence of TNF-alpha or atRA by ectopically over-expressing p300 or increasing p300 acetylase function. Thus, crosstalk among Sox9, NF-kappaB and RARs involving p300 represents a key mechanism for the coordinated regulation of matrix gene expression in chondrocytes. Moreover, p300 may be a relevant target for therapeutic intervention in arthritis.
