Deposition of amyloid-beta protein (Abeta) is a major pathological hallmark of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Abeta is generated from gamma-secretase cleavage of amyloid precursor protein (APP). In addition to APP, gamma-secretase also cleaves other type I integral membrane proteins, including the Notch receptor, a key molecule involved in embryonic development.

To explore selective gamma-secretase inhibitors, a combination of five methods was used to systematically determine these inhibitors' profiles on the gamma-secretase cleavage of APP and Notch. When two potent gamma-secretase inhibitors, compound E (cpd E) and DAPT, were used in a conventional in vitro gamma-secretase activity assay, cpd E completely blocked Abeta generation from the cleavage of substrate APP C100, but only had a minor effect on Notch cleavage and NICD generation. Next, cpd E and DAPT were applied to HEK293 cells expressing a truncated Notch substrate NotchDeltaE. Both cpd E and DAPT were more potent in blocking Abeta generation than NICD generation. Third, a reporter construct was created that carried the NICD targeting promoter with three Su(H) binding sequences followed by the luciferase gene. We found that the inhibition of NICD generation by cpd E and DAPT was consistent with the reduced expression of luciferase gene driven by this Notch targeting promoter. Fourth, levels of "Notch-Abeta-like" (Nbeta*) peptide derived from two previously reported chimeric APP with its transmembrane domain or the juxtamembrane portion replaced by the Notch sequence were quantified. Measurement of Nbeta* peptides by ELISA confirmed that EC50's of cpd E were much higher for Nbeta* than Abeta. Finally, the expression levels of Notch target gene her6 in cpd E or DAPT-treated zebrafish were correlated with the degree of tail curvature due to defective somitogenesis, a well characterized Notch phenotype in zebrafish.

Genetic and neuropathologic evidence suggests that Alzheimer's disease (AD) is caused partly by the overproduction and lack of clearance of the amyloid beta peptide (Abeta) [1]. This Abeta peptide is generated by sequential cleavages of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) by beta-secretase, which generates a 12 kDa C-terminal stub of APP (C99), and by gamma-secretase to yield two major species of Abeta that end at residue 40 (Abeta40) or 42 (Abeta42) [2,3]. In addition to cleaving APP, gamma-secretase also mediates the final proteolytic cleavage of the Notch receptor [4,5]. Notch signaling is critical to a wide variety of cell fate determinations during embryonic development as well as throughout adulthood. After ectodomain shedding, the remaining membrane-bound C-terminal stub is cleaved by gamma-secretase to release the Notch-1-beta peptide (Nbeta, similar to amyloid beta peptide from APP) and the Notch IntraCellular Domain (NICD). NICD is subsequently translocated to the nucleus where it regulates gene expression [5-7].

There are about 50 gamma-secretase substrates in addition to APP and Notch that include DCC [8], ErbB-4 [9,10], E- and N-cadherin [11,12], CD44 [13,14], LRP [15], Nectin1alpha [16], Delta and Jagged [17], Glutamate Receptor Subunit 3 [18], APLP1 and APLP2 [19-21], p75 Neurotrophin Receptor [22], Syndecan3 [23], Colony Stimulating factor-1 [24] and Interleukin-1 Receptor II [25]. All of these substrates are type I membrane proteins and have diverse functions, including transcriptional regulation, cell-cell adhesion, regulation of ion conductance, and neurotrophin signaling. The cleavage of these proteins can be blocked by reported gamma-secretase inhibitors and are fully dependent on each gamma-secretase component [26].

gamma-Secretase is composed of presenilin 1 (PS1), anterior pharynx defective-1 (Aph-1), presenilin enhancer-2 (Pen-2), and nicastrin (Nct). PS1 carries the catalytic site of gamma-secretase, as we have demonstrated that a mutation of two critical aspartate (Asp) residues abrogates enzymatic activity [27]. Nicastrin is required for gamma-secretase activity [28-35] and is an important component in the complex, possibly functioning as the receptor for different substrates [36]. Genetic screens further revealed the aph-1 gene and the pen-2 gene that encodes two essential components of the gamma-secretase complex [37,30,38]; overexpression of all four components results in increased gamma-secretase activity, both in mammalian cells [39-44] and in yeast [45].

Among all reported gamma-secretase inhibitors, transition-state analogues prevent Abeta generation and bind directly to PS1 and PS2 [46,47]. Most reported gamma-secretase inhibitors specifically block the cleavage at both sites in APP and Notch without differentiating between the two substrates. It has been reported that a subset of NSAIDS (nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs) that include ibuprofen, indomethacin and sulindac sulphide, specifically block the cleavage of the gamma-secretase substrates at the middle of transmembrane domain (TMD) without affecting the generation of the intracellular domains (ICDs) of several type I transmembrane proteins that include APP, ErbB-4, and Notch [48]. These NSAIDs directly modulate gamma-secretase complex and become a part of a new class of gamma-secretase modulators [49-54]. Another gamma-secretase modulator is Gleevec that has been approved for the treatment of chronic myeloid leukemia and gastrointestinal stromal tumors. In addition to Gleevec binding to Abelson leukemia (Abl) tyrosine kinase, it also was shown to selectively inhibit APP cleavage and Abeta production without affecting Notch cleavage at the concentration of 10 muM [55].

Two potent gamma-secretase inhibitors, DAPT and compound E (cpd E), show a range of IC50 values in blocking gamma-secretase activity in both in vitro and cell-based assays. For cpd E, the IC50 for NICD and Abeta generation in cultured cells was found as low as 1.7 nM [56] and 0.3 nM [57], respectively. De novo Abeta and AICD generation in vitro was inhibited by DAPT with IC50 values ranging from 10-100 nM [58,59]. A direct comparison of NICD and AICD levels in an in vitro gamma-secretase activity assay showed a partial inhibition of NICD generation by DAPT at 50 nM, and AICD at 100 nM [60]. Different assay systems were implemented in these various studies to measure the IC50 values of the gamma-secretase inhibitors. Since there were a variety of assays used, it was difficult to compare the potency toward the cleavage of APP and Notch among different systems.

The current study combined five assay methods and systematically determined the pharmacological profile of cpd E and DAPT on gamma-secretase cleavage of APP and Notch. This approach includes the measurements of the potency of gamma-secretase inhibitors and their effect on the inhibition of the gamma-secretase activity in vitro, NICD generation, NICD downstream transcription activation, cleavage of APP/Notch chimeric substrates, and Notch downstream target gene expression in zebrafish. Previous studies showed that treating zebrafish with DAPT at the late blastula stage caused defects in somitogenesis and neurogenesis [61]. Similarities have been observed between DAPT-treated embryos and previously reported zebrafish Notch pathway mutants like bea, des, aei, and wit [62,63]. The increased neurogenesis in DAPT-treated embryos can be reduced by microinjecting NICD mRNA. Interestingly, defective somitogenesis was not observed in zebrafish embryos that were treated with the Abeta-lowering JLK non-peptidic isocoumarin inhibitors [64]. In this study, the expression levels of Notch target gene her 6 were correlated to the phenotypes that were observed in the embryos treated with DAPT and cpd E. This provided an in vivo system to test the effect of gamma-secretase inhibitors on Notch signaling in a whole vertebrate animal.

To characterize the direct effect of two gamma-secretase inhibitors cpd E and DAPT on APP/Notch cleavage, a conventional in vitro gamma-secretase assay to quantify their inhibitory potency was used [58,65,66]. The incubation of gamma-secretase complex with purified substrates at 37degreesC for 4 hr was followed by Western Blot (WB) to determine the quantity of newly generated NICD. A newly generated band that corresponds to the predicted size of the NICD-Flag was detected (Fig. 1A and 1B). A clear reduction of NICD generation in samples containing DAPT (Fig. 1A) or cpd E (Fig. 1B) was found, and the reduction was dose dependent.

Generation of NICD and Abeta from purified APP and Notch substrate C100 and N100 in an in vitro gamma-secretase activity assay. The E. coli generated APP- and Notch-based, 100-residue gamma-secretase substrates C100-Flag and N100-Flag were mixed with the membrane vesicles solubilized in CHAPSO after DMSO or compounds were added. The mixture was incubated at 37degreesC for 4 hours. A. A dose-dependent inhibition of NICD generation by DAPT. Generation of NICD was detected by Western blot (WB) with antibody 1744 specifically recognizing N-terminus of NICD. B. Generation of NICD was inhibited in the presence of 100 nM of cpd E. C. Levels of NICD determined by WB were quantified by densitometry (dotted line). Levels of Abeta generated from the gamma-secretase cleavage of C100 in the presence of DAPT were determined by ELISA (solid line). Comparison of NICD and Abeta generation in the presence of DAPT suggests that high concentrations of DAPT were more potent in blocking Abeta than NICD generation. D. NICD (dotted line) and Abeta (solid line) generation in the presence of cpd E were compared. Cpd E inhibited Abeta generation with an IC50 of 1 nM and is more potent in inhibiting Abeta than NICD.

The same preparation of gamma-secretase complex was mixed with C100Flag followed by ELISA to quantify the levels of newly generated Abeta. As expected, both DAPT (Fig. 1C) and cpd E (Fig. 1D) blocked gamma-secretase cleavage of APP C100Flag and caused a dose-dependent reduction of Abeta production.

Close comparison of the inhibition profile of cpd E and DAPT on Abeta and NICD generation revealed a divergence in their potencies. Low concentrations of DAPT did not show much difference in inhibiting NICD and Abeta generation, but 10 and 100 muM of DAPT blocked ~60% of NICD generation compared to a complete depletion of Abeta production (Fig. 1C). While 100 nM of cpd E could almost deplete any Abeta generation from substrate APP C100, its effect on NICD was much less obvious (Fig. 1D). There was only minor reduction of NICD levels compared to DMSO controls. This led to the speculation that certain gamma-secretase inhibitors may specifically inhibit APP at a particular range of doses that have minimum effect on Notch signaling.

Since many compounds could behave differently in vitro versus in culture cells, cpd E and DAPT were tested in cultured cells (Fig. 2). HEK293 cells stably expressing Swedish mutant APP were transiently transfected with NotchDeltaE, a truncated Notch construct that is readily cleaved by the gamma-secretase to generate NICD for downstream signaling transduction [67]. NotchDeltaE expressing cells were treated with increasing concentrations of DAPT or cpd E. Cell lysates were subjected to WB for measuring the generation of NICD (Fig. 2A), and conditioned media were collected for Abeta measurement by ELISA (Fig. 2B,C).

Generation of NICD and Abeta from NotchDeltaE and APP expressing cells. A. Twenty four hrs after the construct carrying NotchDeltaE was transfected into APP expressing HEK293 cells, cells were treated with DAPT or cpd E for 8 hr and lysed for WB with antibody 1744 to specifically detect the N-terminus of NICD. Bottom panel, the antibody against alpha-tubulin was applied to normalize the amounts of lysates used for WB. B. Levels of NICD determined by WB were quantified by densitometry (dotted line). Levels of Abeta generated from the gamma-secretase cleavage of APP in the presence of DAPT were determined by ELISA. Comparison of NICD and Abeta generation in the presence of DAPT suggests that high concentrations of DAPT had a greater inhibition of Abeta than NICD. C. NICD (dotted line) and Abeta (solid line) production from cpd E-treated cells were compared. Cpd E inhibited Abeta generation with an IC50 of ~8 nM, and it shows a greater inhibition of Abeta than NICD. D. A luciferase reporter construct driven by HES1 promoter was transfected into HEK293 cells followed by treatment with cpd E or DAPT. Both gamma-secretase inhibitors blocked transcriptional activation of NICD dependent luciferase activity.

Semi-quantification of NICD levels was detected by WB, and the inhibition profile of DAPT (Fig. 2B) and cpd E (Fig. 2C) were compared on NICD and Abeta generation in cultured cells. It was found that high doses of DAPT and cpd E could not completely eliminate NICD generation in cultured cells. This was in contrast to Abeta levels that were efficiently reduced to almost undetectable levels. Since Notch signaling and levels of NICD can be examined by quantifying the expression of the Notch target gene, a Hes-1 reporter construct (Hes-Luc) was generated by insertion of three Su(H) binding sequences in the pGL3-pro luciferase reporter vector. Hes-Luc and NotchDeltaE were transiently transfected into HEK293 cells, and transfected cells were treated with different concentrations of cpd E or DAPT. Consistent with the levels of NICD that was freshly generated in cultured cells, luciferase activities were inhibited by relatively high doses of cpd E and DAPT. At the concentrations of cpd E and DAPT that completely blocked Abeta generation (Fig. 2B and 2C), about 50% luciferase activities remained, i.e., inhibition of NICD generation was less efficient compared to Abeta blockage (Fig. 2D).

Two cDNA constructs expressing chimeric APP and Notch were previously reported to generate chimeric "Notch-Abeta-like" (Nbeta*) peptide [68]. One construct has its transmembrane domain (TMD) replaced by the Notch TMD (APP-m-NOTCH) and the other with the juxtamembrane portion of the APP ectodomain (the alpha-secretase cleavage region) replaced by the corresponding sequence in Notch (APP-alpha-NOTCH) [68]. Taking advantage of different combinations of ELISA antibodies (see Methods), effects of cpd E on the generation of Abeta and Nbeta* peptides from these chimeric APP-Notch substrates were quantified by ELISA.

Individual construct APP, APP-alpha-Notch or APP-m-Notch was transiently transfected into HEK293 cells. These chimeric protein expressing cells were treated with cpd E, and the levels of Abeta and Nbeta* were measured by ELISA. Again, it was found that the effective concentration (EC) for inhibiting 50% of Abeta production by cpd E was less than 0.1 nM, but the EC50 for Nbeta* from alpha-Notch was at ~8 nM (Fig. 3A). Similar results were obtained when m-Notch was expressed in HEK293 cells. At least two magnitude of difference was observed, with EC50 for cpd E was ~0.03 nM for APP, compared to EC50 for Nbeta* at ~1 nM (Fig. 3B).

Measurements of in vitro gamma-secretase activity and cell-based Abeta/NICD generation have shown different inhibition potencies. To examine the inhibitory effect in vivo, zebrafish embryos were treated with DAPT or cpd E. Because different gamma-secretase inhibitors may impact various metabolic pathways in zebrafish embryos, especially during development, the phenotypes of zebrafish embryos treated with high concentrations of DAPT and cpd E were compared. The major phenotype we examined was curved tail caused by defective somitogenesis.

Morphological alteration in DAPT- or cpd E-treated embryos was compared and correlated to the somitogenesis associated with the inhibition of Notch signaling. The treated embryos were examined using a stereomicroscope and it was found that embryos treated with 50 muM DAPT had a much shorter and curved tail, compared to control DMSO-treated embryos (Fig. 4A). The curvature was obvious when a lateral view of zebrafish was obtained. Cpd E, on the other hand, did not show any curvature when treated at 50 muM. Because the EC50 values for DAPT and cpd E to reduce NICD generation in cultured cells were ~1000 nM and 10 nM, respectively (Fig. 2B and 2C), 50 muM of DAPT and cpd E were chosen as the highest concentrations for the treatment.

To examine the effect of DAPT and cpd E on Notch signaling, embryos treated with different concentrations of DAPT or cpd E were stained by whole mount in situ hybridization using a her6 probe (Fig 5). The expression level of Notch downstream target gene her6 correlates to the levels of Notch signaling, i.e., a loss of her6 staining corresponds to an inhibition of gamma-secretase mediated Notch signaling. We have focused on the specific effect of gamma-secretase inhibitors on Notch signaling in brain region.

In DMSO-treated embryos, her6 expression was mainly clustered in the ventral midbrain and ventral hindbrain (Fig. 5). In the presence of 50 muM DAPT, the her6 expression was significantly reduced or disappeared in most areas, reflecting a strong inhibition of gamma-secretase activity. When embryos were treated with a lower concentration of DAPT at 5 muM, staining of her6 started to appear in those areas found in DMSO-treated embryos. Embryos treated with 0.5 muM DAPT showed a very similar staining pattern to the control embryos. Interestingly, cpd E showed a weaker effect on the expression levels of her6. There was a reduction of her6 staining in those embryos that were treated with highest testing doses of cpd E. When the her6 staining is linked to morphological alterations (Fig. 5), the level of reduction in Notch signaling is closely linked with the severity of phenotypes that was observed in these zebrafish, i.e., the curvature of the tails.

Our knowledge of gamma-secretase components distinguishing different substrates provides a molecular basis for the modulation of gamma-secretase complex. Nicastrin has been found to interact with both APP and Notch and is involved in substrate recognition and interaction [36]. An artificial elongation of the Pen-2 N-terminus leads to an increased Abeta42 production [69], indicating that Pen-2 might function as a modulator to influence the gamma-secretase cleavage of APP. Identification of a key regulator of gamma-secretase complex TMP21 further suggests that cleavage of APP and Notch could be distinguished and modulated [70]. While the development of gamma-secretase inhibitors is one of the major directions for AD therapeutics, completely blocking the gamma-secretase-mediated proteolytic process of about 50 substrates interferes with fundamental steps in many biological functions. Therefore, identifying gamma-secretase modulators that only block the cleavage of APP, but not other substrates is ideal. Different from earlier studies that have identified NSAIDs and Gleevec for specific blockage of Abeta production without affecting the gamma-secretase cleavage of Notch, the current study has provided a systematic approach to identify gamma-secretase inhibitors to modulate the gamma-secretase cleavage of APP and Notch separately.

We have analyzed two potent gamma-secretase inhibitors DAPT and cpd E using different quantification methods to determine the pharmacological profile of blocking the cleavage of APP and Notch. The range of inhibition concentrations vary among these methods. However, the effective inhibitory concentrations for Notch cleavage were always found to be higher than those concentrations for APP cleavage. In a conventional in vitro gamma-secretase activity assay, 0.1 muM of cpd E completely blocked Abeta generation from the cleavage of substrate APP C100, and only had minor effect on Notch cleavage and NICD generation. Cpd E selectively inhibited the gamma-secretase cleavage of APP at low concentrations, i.e., from 0.1 nM to 10 nM. However, at the same concentrations, we found that DAPT did not inhibit the gamma-secretase cleavage of APP and Notch (Fig. 1C). When higher concentration of DAPT was used in our in vitro gamma-secretase activity assay, a partial inhibition of Notch cleavage was observed, in contrast to an almost complete inhibition of APP cleavage. Therefore, DAPT selectively blocked the gamma-secretase cleavage of APP at higher concentration compared to compound E. When cpd E or DAPT were applied to HEK293 cells that expressed the substrate NotchDeltaE, we found that both compounds were more potent in blocking Abeta generation than NICD production. DAPT at concentrations of 1 muM or higher reduced Notch cleavage to about 50% in both in vitro gamma-secretase activity assay (Fig. 1B) and cell culture based assay (Fig. 2B). Cpd E at 0.1 muM reduced Notch cleavage to ~50% in both systems. For the gamma-secretase cleavage of APP, DAPT was able to inhibit the levels of Abeta to 50% at the concentration of 1 muM in vitro and ~0.5 muM in cultured cells, respectively. Compound E, on the other hand, was able to reduce the levels of Abeta to 50% at the concentrations of 1 nM and 5 nM in two systems. Therefore, DAPT and cpd E showed similar potencies in cultured cells and in vitro gamma-secretase activity assay. The level of NICD inhibition was consistent with the reduced expression of Luciferase gene driven by a Notch target gene promoter containing three Su(H) binding sequences. Using two previously reported chimeric cDNA constructs expressing APP-m-NOTCH or APP-alpha-NOTCH, cpd E showed much higher EC50's for lowering the levels of Nbeta* derived from the cleavage of APP-m-NOTCH and APP-alpha-NOTCH. Finally, the expression levels of Notch target gene her6 in a whole animal zebrafish, as measured by in situ hybridization, were correlated with the dose-dependent phenotypic effect of DAPT. The effect of cpd E was less obvious and hence, consistent with a less reduction of her6 expression.

Previous studies have applied similar compounds to differentiate their effect on the gamma-secretase cleavage of Notch and APP, and some showed selective inhibition of Abeta production without Notch phenotypes in animals [71]. Lewis et al. have used a set of compounds for the test, and some of these compounds (like compound 1) have similar structures to DAPT [72]. Using cultured cells to test the potencies of different compounds, they found that Notch and APP cleavages cannot be easily dissected apart [72]. We have used additional methods to determine the inhibition profile of DAPT and cpd E, including in vivo animal based assays. In cultured cells expressing NotchDeltaE or chimeric APP-Notch proteins, cpd E was more effective in inhibiting APP than Notch substrate. DAPT showed similar effect in cultured cells and in an in vitro gamma-secretase activity assay. Both gamma-secretase inhibitors DAPT and cpd E are believed to interact with the core component of the gamma-secretase complex, PS. Mutation of two aspartate residues in PS1 leads to a complete loss of function for gamma-secretase which suggests that these two aspartates may constitute the active site of gamma-secretase [27]. Both aspartyl protease transition state mimic and non-transition-state gamma-secretase inhibitor could specifically bind the N- and C-terminal fragments of PS1 [73,46,57]. The binding of the gamma-secretase inhibitor to PS1 NTF/CTF could be then competitively suppressed by the presence of cpd E [57]. DAPT was found to specifically interact with the C-terminal region of PS1 [59]. Studies that use helical peptide inhibitors to block the gamma-secretase complex suggest that a docking and an active site exist for the gamma-secretase complex, and that the docking site might be located at the PS subunit interface, a site very close to the active site [74]. It is not clear whether different concentrations of DAPT and cpd E may affect the docking site in a way that differentiate the binding of APP and Notch to the gamma-secretase complex.

Both DAPT and cpd E have been used to treat animals. DAPT was specifically tested in zebrafish [61]. Zebrafish have a highly conserved gamma-secretase complex. Both zebrafish PS1 (Psen1) and the PS2 homolog (Psen2) are expressed during the segmentation and later stages [75-77]. Nicastrin has been identified in the zebrafish genome, and only one copy of Psen1, Psen2, Pen-2, and Aph-1 gene has been found [30]. Once the highly similar zebrafish gamma-secretase complex is inhibited by DAPT, somitogenesis is severely affected leading to curved tails, a phenotype well-characterized for altered Notch signaling [61]. In this study, a dose dependent effect of DAPT on zebrafish phenotypes was observed, and a curvature of zebrafish tail was found in embryos treated with 50 muM of DAPT. Although the EC50 of DAPT for inhibiting Notch signaling was much lower in cultured cells (1-10 muM, Fig. 2), it is not surprising that a high concentration of DAPT was necessary to induce a phenotype in a whole animal (50 muM, Fig. 4). For cpd E, the highest concentration used to treat embryos was 50 muM compared to an EC50 that was below 0.1 muM for the inhibition of NICD generation in cultured cells (Fig. 2). For both DAPT and cpd E, there is no data on pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics and ADME of these two compounds in zebrafish. While both cpd E and DAPT are cell permeable, a lack of dramatic phenotypic alteration in embryos treated with 50 muM cpd E could be best explained by a slightly reduced expression level of her6 gene. This indicates that Notch signaling was not significantly perturbed at this concentration of cpd E in a whole animal.

Administration of cpd E into guinea pig resulted in a dose-dependent inhibition of brain cortical gamma-secretase activity and correspondingly, decreases in plasma, CSF and brain Abeta levels [78]. Treatment of a transgenic mouse expressing human familial AD linked V717F APP with DAPT also leads to a dose-dependent, acute decrease in brain Abeta [79]. Treatment of AD patients with another gamma-secretase inhibitor, LY450139 dihydrate, reduces plasma Abeta40. This compound was well tolerated in these patients [80-82]. Therefore, modulated inhibition of gamma-secretase is feasible in human subjects, and potent inhibitors used at appropriate doses appear to be promising in preventing the progression of Abeta pathology.

Our measurement of Abeta and Notch-Abeta-like peptides from chimeric APP proteins could be used for efficient cell-based screening of gamma-secretase modulators. These modulators could be tested by in vitro gamma-secretase activity assay. The in vivo test results presented here of these compounds in a vertebrate zebrafish further validate our quantitative methods to differentiate their selectivity for APP, Notch and potentially other gamma-secretase substrates.

The E. coli generated APP- and Notch-based, 100-residue gamma-secretase substrates C100-Flag and N100-Flag were purified as previously described [65]. C100-Flag substrate contains an initiating methionine, the 99 C-terminal residues of APP that start at the alpha-secretase site, and a Flag tag. N100-Flag substrate contains a similar initiating methionine, 99 amino acids that start at the TACE cleavage site, and a Flag tag. The membrane vesicles were solubilized in 1% CHAPSO-HEPES and diluted in a final concentration of 0.2% CHAPSO-HEPES. Phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) and phosphatidylcholine (PC) were added to the final concentration of 0.02% PE and 0.08% PC. After adding DMSO or test compounds to the solubilized gamma-secretase complex, substrate C100-Flag or N100-Flag was added to the mixture, then followed by incubation at 37degreesC for 4 hours [65,83]. Two compounds have been used in this study, compound E (cpd E), {(S,S)-2-[2-(3,5-Difluorophenyl)-acetylamino]-N-(1-methyl-2-oxo-5-phenyl-2,3-dihydro-1H-benzo [e] [1,4] diazepin-3-yl)-propionamide} [57] and DAPT {N-[N-(3,5-Difluorophenacetyl-L-alanyl)]-S-phenylglycine t-Butyl Ester} [79]. Cpd E was provided by Dr. Michael Wolfe.

Sandwich ELISAs for Abeta were performed as described [84]. The capture antibodies, 2G3 (to Abeta residues 33-40) and 4G8 (to Abeta residues 17-24), were used for Abeta40 and Abeta total species, respectively. The detecting antibodies were biotinylated 82E1 (to Abeta residues 1-16) for Abeta1-40/total or biotinylated 266 for Abetax-40 species. The use of mid-region and C-terminal capturing antibodies and N-terminal detecting antibody for chimeric "Notch-Abeta-like" peptide (Nbeta*) has been documented [68]. The combination of several capture/detecting antibodies are use to measure Abeta and Nbeta* derived from different precursors. The capture antibody 2G3 and detecting antibody 82E1 were used for measuring Nbeta* from APP-alpha-Notch expressing cells. Since the APP-alpha-NOTCH is the fusion protein with its juxtamembrane portion of the APP ectodomain (the alpha-secretase cleavage region) replaced by the corresponding sequence in Notch, the epitopes in APP sequence could still be recognized by 2G3 (C-terminus) and 82E1 (N-terminus). The capture antibody 4G8 and detecting antibody 82E1 were used for measuring Nbeta* from APP-m-Notch expressing cells. Since the APP-m-NOTCH is the fusion protein with its transmembrane domain (TMD) replaced by the Notch TMD, the epitopes in APP sequence could be recognized by 4G8 (mid-region before TMD) and 82E1 (N-terminus). Antibody 82E1 was purchased from Immuno-Biological Laboratories, Inc., Minneapolis, MN. Antibody 4G8 was purchased from Signet Laboratories, Inc., Dedham, MA. Antibody 1744 that specifically detect the N-terminus of NICD was purchased from Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA.
