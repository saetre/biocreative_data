The nucleotide sequence of the control region of the divergent argECBH operon has been established in the wild type and in mutants affecting expression of these genes. The argE and argCBH promoters face each other and overlap with an operator region containing two domains which may act as distinct repressor binding sites. A long leader sequence - not involved in attenuation - precedes argCBH. Overlapping of the argCBH promoter and the region involved in ribosome mobilization for argE translation explains the dual effect of some mutations. Mutations causing semi-constitutive expression of argE improve putative promoter sequences within argC. Implications of these results regarding control mechanisms in amino acid biosynthesis and their evolution are discussed.
