Background

###begin p 3
It has been recently demonstrated that in Frontotemporal Lobar Degeneration (FTLD) memory deficits at presentation are commoner than previously thought. Apolipoprotein E (ApoE) genotype, the major genetic risk factor in sporadic late-onset Alzheimer Disease (AD), modulates cerebral perfusion in late middle-age cognitively normal subjects. ApoE epsilon4 homozygous have reduced glucose metabolism in the same regions involved in AD.

ApoE genotype influenced both clinical and functional features in FTLD. ApoE epsilon4-carriers were more impaired in long-term memory function (ApoE epsilon4 vs. ApoE non epsilon4, 6.3 +/- 3.9 vs. 10.1 +/- 4.2, p = 0.004) and more hypoperfused in uncus and parahippocampal regions (x,y,z = 38,-6,-20, T = 2.82, cluster size = 100 voxels; -32,-12,-28, T= 2.77, cluster size = 40 voxels).

The present findings support the view that ApoE genotype might be considered a disease-modifying factor in FTLD, thus contributing to define a specific clinical presentation, and might be of relevance for pharmacological approaches.

Memory deficits are not considered prominent characteristics at disease onset, but more recent studies demonstrated that amnesia at presentation in pathologically proved FTLD cases is commoner than previously thought [2]. Notwithstanding, the underlying basis of such impairment is still unexplained.

Apolipoprotein E (ApoE) is established as the major genetic risk factor in sporadic late-onset Alzheimer Disease (AD), which is mainly characterised by memory impairment [3]. Moreover, it has been demonstrated that ApoE genotype modulates cerebral perfusion in late middle-age cognitively normal subjects, ApoE epsilon4 homozygous having reduced glucose metabolism in the same regions involved in AD [4].

Based on these observations, we hypothesised that ApoE genotype might play a key-role in influencing the cerebral functional pattern as well as the degree of memory deficits in FTLD patients. To this aim, FTLD patients were enrolled, ApoE genotype defined, and neuropsychological standardized assessment as well as Single Photon Emission Tomography (SPECT) cerebral perfusion patterns assessed.

All patients fulfilled international consensus criteria for FTLD [5-7]. In keeping with other studies, we retain the term FTLD as a general super-ordinate label with a subsequent subdivision into five major clinical subtypes : 1. Behavioural or frontal variant FTD (fvFTD) [7], 2. Semantic Dementia (SD) [7], 3. Progressive Non-fluent Aphasia (PNFA) [7], 4. Progressive Supranuclear Palsy (PSP) [6], and 5.

All subjects performed a somatic and neurological evaluation, laboratory examinations, a brain structural Magnetic Resonance Imaging study, and a brain functional SPECT study. ApoE genotype was determined. Thirty-two out of 52 patients (60%) performed cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) Tau, Phospho-Tau and Abeta dosage to further confirm FTLD diagnosis, being Abeta dosage within the normal range and thus further excluding other kind of dementia, i.e. AD.

Global cognitive function assessment was made according to a standardized battery, including the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) [8]. The neuropsychological assessment was made with the following tests: Raven Colored Progressive Matrices [9], Controlled Oral Word Association Test and Category Fluency [10], Clock Drawing Test [11], Rey Complex Figure Copy and Recall [12], Story Recall Test [13], Digit Span [14], Trail Making Test A and B [15], Token Test [16], and De Renzi Imitation Test [17]. Instrumental Activities of Daily Living (IADL) [18], and Basic Activities of Daily Living (BADL) [19] were assessed as well. Behavioural and psychiatric disturbances were evaluated by Neuropsychiatry Inventory (NPI) [20], and Frontal Behavioral Inventory (FBI) [21].

Basic image processing and voxel-based data analyses were performed by SPM02 routines (Wellcome Department of Cognitive Neurology, London, UK) implemented in MATLAB 6.1 (Mathworks, Sherborn, MA) [23]. SPECT images were spatially normalized by affine 12-parameter transformation onto a SPECT template conforms to the Talairach and Tournoux space. Normalized images were represented on a 79 x 95 x 68 matrix with 2 x 2 x 2 mm voxel size. To account for individual variability in structure-function relationships, an isotropic Gaussian filter was used to smooth the spatially normalized SPECT images with a FWHM of 8 mm.

Fifty-five patients with the clinical diagnosis of FTLD entered the study from March 2003 through April 2005. Among them, three were subsequently excluded to avoid confounds: one because of SPECT perfusion pattern involving temporo-parietal region and cingulate areas, and two because of low CSF Abeta and high CSF Tau levels, thus resembling AD pattern.

The whole FTLD patient group was divided into two subgroups, according to the presence (ApoE epsilon4+) or the absence (ApoE epsilon4-) of ApoE epsilon4 allele. Demographic and clinical characteristics of ApoE epsilon4- and ApoE epsilon4+ patients are reported in Table 1. The two subgroups neither differed for global cognitive impairment or for IADL or BADL scores. ApoE epsilon4+ carriers showed worse performances in Short Story recall compared to ApoE epsilon4- (6.3 +/- 3.9 vs. 10.1 +/- 4.2, p = 0.004). Raven Colored Progressive Matrice scores were worse in ApoE epsilon4+ carriers, but the performance was within the normal range in both subgroups (ApoE epsilon4+ vs. ApoE epsilon4-, 19.0 +/- 7.0 vs. 24.6 +/- 5.5, p = 0.003).

In order to exclude the effect of clinical endophenotypes in determining the hypoperfusion pattern, the clinical diagnoses (fvFTD, SD, PNFA, PSP and CBD) were introduced as nuisance variable in the analysis, and the results were confirmed.

The present study demonstrates that in a large series of mildly affected FTLD patients, ApoE epsilon4+ allele can influence the phenotypic expression, accounting for a greater susceptibility to uncus and parahippocampal functional impairment. Indeed, this functional pattern is associated with worse performances in test tapping long term memory functions.

It has been recently highlighted that FTLD may be characterised by memory impairment, but the possible genetic determinants of the so called amnestic FTLD have not been identified yet [2]. The autopsy-proven evidence of amnesic deficits in FTLD has suggested that pathologies mainly characterised by memory impairment, such as AD, could share the same genetic risk factors.

In AD, the role of ApoE genotype is well established [24], and it has been recently demonstrated that ApoE genotype modifies the phenotype in AD patients, the lack of ApoE epsilon4 directing away the pathological process from medial temporal structures [4].

ApoE genotype affects not only AD, but it may also cognitive performances in normal aging, epsilon4 allele-carriers showing altered memory-related cognitive processing [25]. Furthermore, cross-sectional positron emission tomography studies found that cognitively normal carriers of the ApoE epsilon4 allele have abnormally low measurements of the cerebral metabolic rate for glucose in the same regions as patients with AD.

No definite genetic risk factor of non-monogenic FTLD has been identified yet. Although the role of the epsilon4 allele of ApoE has been well established in AD, studies of ApoE allele distribution in patients with FTLD have produced variable results. Literature data on the role of ApoE genotype as a risk factor for FTLD development are controversial. Some studies have reported an increased frequency of the ApoE epsilon4 allele in FTLD; others have found no relationship between ApoE genotype and the risk of FTLD development [26-31]. Our results suggest higher ApoE epsilon4 allele frequency in FTLD (39.1%) compared to the reported incidence in healthy control subjects.

Notwithstanding, data on a possible modulating effect of ApoE genotype on functional and neuropsychological features have not been available yet. The data of the present work, if replicated in larger studies with neuropathological confirmation, may have implications for our understanding of the pathogenesis of FTLD and factors influencing the regional predilection. The fact that the ApoE epsilon4 genotype in our patients was associated with greater hippocampus hypoperfusion suggests the existence of common ApoE-related pathways involved in the development of different clinical FTLD subtypes.
