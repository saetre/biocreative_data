The nucleotide sequence of black beetle virion (BBV) RNA2 has been determined. RNA2 is 1399 b long. Its 5' terminus is capped. Its 3' terminus has an unidentified moiety that renders the RNA resistent to polyadenylation and ligation. The first AUG codon at base 23 is followed by an open reading frame for a protein 407 amino acids long, the predicted size of coat protein precursor. A second open reading frame for a putative protein 72 amino acid residues long begins at base 1110. No other large open reading frames exist. The 5' half of the RNA can be folded into a long, imperfect hairpin of high predicted stability. The 3' half of the RNA can fold into a complex set of multiply bifurcated stem and loop regions.
