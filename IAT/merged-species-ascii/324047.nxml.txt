From recently published data on the amino-terminal structures of human and mouse interferons, we have predicted and synthesised an oligonucleotide capable of priming specifically the reverse transcription of human fibroblast interferon mRNA present within a total mRNA population. From these transcripts we determined the sequence of the 5'-terminus of the mRNA and identified a putative pre-peptide signal sequence. This enabled us to predict the sequence of another primer capable of directing the synthesis of interferon double-stranded cDNA corresponding to the entire coding region of the mRNA. Further sequencing studies also enabled us to establish the identity of 47 consecutive amino acids beginning with the methionine residue at the amino-terminus of the mature protein.
