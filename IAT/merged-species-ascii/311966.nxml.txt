The human lecithin-cholesterol acyltransferase (LCAT) gene has been sequenced to completion. The gene is divided into six exons spanning approximately 4,200 bp. Exon five codes for amino acids homologous to the interfacial active site of several lipases, and also codes for an amphipathic alpha-helix resembling the carboxy terminus of apolipoprotein E. Blot hybridization data suggest that there is only one LCAT gene in humans. The 1550 base LCAT mRNA can be detected in liver and HepG2 (hepatocyte) cells, but not in small intestine, spleen, pancreas, placenta or adrenal tissue.
