Tamoxifen is still the most widely used drug in hormone therapy for the treatment of breast cancer. Its benefits in adjuvant treatment are well documented in controlled and randomized clinical studies, which have demonstrated an increase in disease-free intervals of patients with positive hormonal receptors. However, the mechanisms involved in endocrine resistance are not clear. Laboratory and clinical data now indicate that bi-directional molecular cross-talk between nuclear or membrane ER and growth factor receptor pathways may be involved in endocrine resistance. We recently found a functional interaction between alpha6beta4 integrin and ErbB-3 receptor to maintain the PI3K/Akt survival pathway of mammary tumour cells. We sought to improve understanding of this process in order to provide the involvement of both receptors insight into mechanism of Tamoxifen resistance.

Using human breast cancer cell lines displaying different levels of alpha6beta4 and ErbB-3 receptors and a series of 232 breast cancer biopsies from patients submitted to adjuvant Tamoxifen monotherapy for five years, we evaluated the functional interaction between both receptors in relationship to Tamoxifen responsiveness. In mammary carcinoma cells, we evidenced that the alpha6beta4 integrin strongly influence Akt phosphorylation through ErbB-3 protein regulation. Moreover, the ErbB-3 inactivation inhibits Akt phosphorylation, induces apoptosis and inhibits in vitro invasion favouring Tamoxifen responsiveness. The analysis of human tumors revealed a significant relationship between alpha6beta4 and ErbB-3 in P-Akt-positive and ERbeta1-negative breast cancers derived from patients with lower disease free survival.

We provided evidence that a strong relationship occurs between alpha6beta4 and ErbB-3 positivity in ERbeta1-negative breast cancers. We also found that the association between ErbB-3 and P-Akt positivity mainly occurs in ERbeta1-negative breast cancer derived from patients with lower DFS indicating that both receptors are clinically relevant in predicting the response to Tamoxifen.

In many breast cancer (BC), activation of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) pathway may deeply reduce the efficacy to targeted therapies [1]-[3]. In the last few years, a strong activation of the PI3-K/Akt signaling pathway was observed in tumor cells that express high levels of integrin alpha6beta4, a laminin receptor implicated in tumor progression and invasion [4]-[9]. The involvement of this integrin in tumor progression is supported by large experimental evidence. In mammary and ovary carcinoma cell lines, alpha6beta4 integrin associates with ErbB-2 overexpression and co-operates to promote a PI3K-dependent invasion and survival [10], [6]. In MMTV-Neu mice, the introduction of a targeted deletion of the beta4 cytoplasmic domain revealed that beta4 integrin promotes tumor progression cooperating with ErbB-2 signaling [11]. Inactivation of alpha6beta4 integrin by RNA interference inhibits tumor growth both in vitro and in vivo[12]-[14] and strongly reduces the activity of the PI3K pathway inducing apoptosis upon hormone deprivation and TAM treatment in MCF7 BC cells [12]. In addition, we have recently evidenced that the alpha6beta4-induced PI3K-dependent survival pathway of two different BC cell lines is due to the capability of alpha6beta4 integrin to enhance ErbB-3 expression. This enhancement results in an increase of ErbB-2/ErbB-3 heterodimerization and consequently in the activation of the PI3K survival pathway [15]. Collectively, these studies suggest a strong cooperation between alpha6beta4 integrin and EGFR family members in mammary tumors and highlight a pathway by which this integrin might contribute to BC tumorigenicity and responsiveness to treatments.

BC remains one of the most heterogeneous tumors in terms of capability to give metastases, expression of hormone receptors and responsiveness to therapies and is the first cause of death for women aged 35-45 years [16]. Tamoxifen (TAM) is still the most widely used drug in hormone therapy for the treatment of this neoplasia. Its benefits in adjuvant treatment and metastatic disease are well documented in controlled and randomized clinical studies, which have demonstrated an increase in disease-free intervals and overall survival of patients with positive hormonal receptors [17]. However, endocrine therapies do not always work in patients, despite the presence of hormone receptors in their tumors [18]. Originally, only estrogen receptor (ER) alpha and progesterone receptor (PgR) were thought to be involved in hormone signaling. However, a second ER, termed ERbeta, was subsequently discovered, adding another dimension of complexity to the regulation of hormone response [19]-[20]. Insights into the mechanisms of endocrine therapy resistance, although still cause for debate, have come from several studies concerning the biology of ERs and the various signaling pathways in the cell with which they communicate. Laboratory and clinical data now indicate that bidirectional molecular cross-talk between nuclear or membrane ER and growth factor receptor pathways may be involved in endocrine resistance [21]. An understanding of these ER activities at the molecular level may yield new strategies to prevent or overcome resistance to TAM and other forms of treatment.

In the present work, using ER-positive human BC cell lines, we investigated the functional interaction between alpha6beta4 and ErbB-3 proteins in relationship to TAM responsiveness. In addition, with the aim to translate our in vitro study to an in vivo model, we carried out immunohistochemical (IHC) analysis to evaluate the functional relationship between desease-free survival (DFS) and expression of alpha6beta4, ErbB-2, ErbB-3, P-Akt and ERbeta1 in a retrospective series of 232 ERalpha and/or PgR positive BCs derived from patients which had been homogeneously submitted to adjuvant TAM monotherapy. Combining our analyses, we provide evidence that alpha6beta4 expression is functionally associated with ErbB-3 and P-Akt molecules in vitro. However, even though alpha6beta4 expression in vivo is still strongly associated with ErbB-3 positivity and ERbeta1 negativity, it does not influence patient outcome. Interestingly, we report for the first time a strong association of ErbB-3 and P-Akt positivity that mainly occurs in ERbeta1 negative BC derived from patients with lower DFS. This result suggests that both receptors are clinically relevant in predicting the response to Tamoxifen treatment.

We first evaluated the expression level of ERalpha and ERbeta, beta4 integrin subunit, ErbB2, and ErbB-3 in a series of human mammary tumor cell lines including MDA-MB 231, MDA-MB 361, SKBr3, BT474, BT549, and T47D. Analysis of ERalpha by Western blotting (Figure 1A) and ERbeta1 by RT-PCR, using specific primers to detect ERbeta1 mRNA, (Figure 1B) showed that BT549 cells were negative for both ERs whereas the other cell lines were positive for at least one ER. Then, the expression of ERbeta1 protein was evaluated by immunocytochemistry (Figure S1). The data obtained confirmed the expression of ERbeta1 protein in each cell line that resulted positive for ERbeta1 mRNA. As expected, the analysis of the other receptors by cytofluorimetry showed that MDA-MB 361, SKBr3 and BT474 and T47D cells express considerable levels of ErbB-2 protein (Figure 1C) [22]. Moreover, the same cells express beta4 and ErbB-3 proteins at comparable levels, whereas BT549 and MDA-MB 231 cells displaying low levels of ErbB-2 and beta4 proteins were also ErbB-3 negative, supporting our recent finding that beta4 overexpression regulates ErbB-3 protein at translational level [15].

Given that alpha6beta4 integrin is the receptor for laminin 5 (LM5) and, as we previously demonstrated, ligation of the integrin to this substrate enhances PI3K signaling, we first verified the level of Akt phosphorylation upon stimulation in the mammary tumor cell lines. To this end, MDA-MB 361, BT474, SKBr3, BT549 and MDA-MB 231 cells were spread onto LM5 for 20 minutes and the level of Akt activity was evaluated by Ser473 phosphorylation. As reported in Figure 2A, a strong enhancement of Akt phosphorylation was detectable in the cells expressing alpha6beta4, ErbB-2 and ErbB-3 receptors (i.e., MDA-MB 361, BT474 and SKBr3 cells) while, it did not occur in cells expressing low levels of beta4, ErbB-2 and undectable level of ErbB-3 (i.e., BT549 and MDA-MB 231) (Figure 2A). As expected, after 60 minutes of LM5 stimulation, the phosphorylation of Akt returned to the basal levels (data not shown).

To confirm the essential role of ErbB-3 protein in the activation of Akt by alpha6beta4, a beta4 shRNA (beta4si) or an ErbB-3 siRNA (B3si) were expressed in MDA-MB 361, BT474 and SKBr3 cells, as previously described [15]. As expected, depletion of beta4 resulted in a strong reduction of beta4 compared to the levels found in scramble (scr) control cells. Of interest, beta4 depletion also caused a strong reduction of ErbB-3 expression and Akt phosphorylation (Figure 2B, upper panel). Moreover, ErbB-3 depletion resulted in a strong reduction of ErbB-3 expression and, at the same time, of Akt phosphorylation (Figure 2B, lower panel). Since alpha6beta4 regulates ErbB-3 level and the depletion of either beta4 or ErbB-3 proteins resulted in a strong inhibition of Akt activation, the data confirm the essential role of ErbB-3 in the activation of Akt by alpha6beta4 integrin in mammary tumor cells (Figure 2B).

To further evaluate the function of ErbB-3 in the PI3K survival pathway, we analyzed cell death and apoptosis in the absence of hormones and under TAM treatment of ErbB3 positive (SKBr3, MDA-MB 361, BT474 and T47D) and ErbB3 negative (MDAMB231) cell lines. As shown in Figure 3A and 3B, in the absence of hormones, depletion of ErbB-3 protein caused per se a strong cell death compared to scr cells (SKBr3/B3i 32% vs SKBr3/scr 8%, p = 0.001; MDA MB361/B3i 42% vs MDA MB361/scr 6%, p<0.0001; BT474/B3i 35% vs BT474/scr 11%, p = 0.04; T47D/B3i 39% vs T47D/scr 7%, p = 0.04). Cell death was further increased by TAM treatment (SKBr3/B3si/TAM 48% vs SKBr3/scr/TAM 19%, p<0.0001; MDA MB361/B3si/TAM 55% vs MDA MB361/scr/TAM 21%, p<0.0001; BT474/B3si/TAM 38% vs BT474/scr/TAM 18%, p = 0.02; T47D/B3si/TAM 42% vs T47D/scr/TAM 10%, p = 0.005) as also assessed by cleavage of PARP, a marker of apoptotic death (Fig. 3B). The results we obtained on cell death and apoptosis on T47D cells strongly reinforce our hypothesis that ErbB-3 sustains the survival function of mammary tumor cells in the absence of hormone stimuli. Indeed, this cell line is negative for ERbeta1 expression, does not respond to TAM treatment, and undergoes apoptosis only upon ErbB-3 depletion. MDAMB231 cells that are ErbB-3 negative, even if are ERbeta1 positive, do not respond to TAM treatment and proliferate and survive as well as untreated cells (p = 0.82) (Fig. 3A,B), indicating that these cells have developed other survival pathway(s).

SKBr3, MDA-MB 361, BT474, T47D and MDAMB231 cells transfected as described in A were assayed for their ability to invade matrigel in the absence of hormone and under TAM treatment. Statistical differences were evaluated by T test (p<0.05).

It is widely reported that TAM resistance and, as a consequence, tumor progression may be also due to PI3K activation [23]. In order to understand the role of ErbB-3 in the invasion process, we evaluated the invasive capability of scr and ErbB-3-depleted SKBr3, MDA-MB-361, BT474, T47D cells in the absence of hormones and upon TAM treatment. As shown in Figure 3C, depletion of ErbB-3 protein caused per se a strong inhibition of the invasion compared to scr cells (percent of invasion: SKBr3/B3si 50% vs SKBr3/scr 100%, P = 0.001; MDA MB361/B3si 54% vs MDA MB361/scr 100%, p<0.0001; BT474/B3si 70% vs BT474/scr 100%, p = 0.03; T47D/B3si 62% vs T47D/scr 100%, p = 0.04). The inhibition of the invasion in ErbB-3-depleted cells further increased following TAM treatment compared to scr cells (percent of invasion: SKBr3/B3si/TAM 35% vs SKBr3/scr/TAM 85%, p<0.0001; MDA MB361/B3si/TAM 42% vs MDA MB361/scr/TAM 82%, p<0.0001; BT474/B3si/TAM 61% vs BT474/scrTAM 83%, p = 0.04; T47D/B3si/TAM 50% vs T47D/scr/TAM 90%, p<0.001). As expected, TAM treatment does not alters the capability of MDAMB231 cells to invade matrigel (p = 0.06) (Figure 3C). Representative invading stained cells are showed on Figure S2. Collectively, these data indicate a role of ErbB-3 protein in the mechanisms that regulate the invasion of mammary tumor cells. Since we have previously demonstrated that beta4 depletion reduces the responsiveness of mammary tumor cells to TAM treatment, our data also suggest that a cooperative signaling between ErbB-3 and alpha6beta4 integrin could influence resistance to hormone therapy in vivo.

To verify whether the functional interaction between alpha6beta4 integrin and ErbB-3 receptor also occurred in vivo, we studied 232 biopsies of BC patients surgically treated at our Institute and submitted to adjuvant TAM therapy. The detailed clinicopathological characteristics of the patients are described in Table 1. These tumors were first analyzed by IHC for the expression of beta4 integrin subunit, ErbB-3, ErbB-2, ERbeta1 and P-Akt expression. As summarized in Figure 4A, of the 232 cases analyzed, beta4 exhibited a strong homogeneous (score 2) or heterogeneous (score 1) immunoreaction in 170 BC (73,3%). 77 BC (33,2%) overexpressed ErbB-3 and 158 (68,1%) were ERbeta1 positive. Moreover, we found that 136 BC (59%) were P-Akt positive, while 59 (25,4%) were positive for ErbB-2. Representative immunohistochemically positive cases for beta4, ErbB-3, P-Akt, ERbeta1 and ErbB-2 and control tissue sections are shown in Figure 4B.

Table 2 summarizes the associations between beta4 expression and biopathological factors in our series of 232 BC patients. We found that all tumors, which were positive for ErbB-3 receptor, showed a higher score in beta4 expression, beta4 immunoreaction being significantly associated to ErbB-3 (p = 0.003). Interestingly, we also found that the majority of high beta4-positive tumors were ERbeta1-negative (p<0.0001). In contrast, beta4 was not significantly related to P-Akt, ErbB-2 protein and any conventional pathological parameters, namely tumor size, grading and nodal status.

Each variable that significantly affected DFS in the univariate analyses were introduced into a Cox proportional risk model. Multivariate analyses revealed that tumor size (HR 2.24, C.I. 1.10-4.53, p = 0.02), grading (G2 vs G1, HR 5.61, C.I. 1.25-25.30, p = 0.02 and G3 vs G1, HR 10.23, C.I. 2.07-50.45, p = 0.004), ErbB-3 expression (HR 2.16, C.I. 1.10-4.22, p = 0.024) and lack of ERbeta1 (HR 3.28, C.I. 1.56-6.87, p = 0.002) were independent prognostic variables influencing DFS. ERbeta1 negativity appears to be the most powerful prognostic indicator of a reduced DFS, indicating that ERbeta1 positive tumors are more likely to be responsive to TAM therapy.

In contrast, as shown in Figure 6, the results obtained provide statistically significant evidence which indicates that the association of ErbB-3 positivity with ERbeta1 negativity (p<0.0001) as well as the concomitant overexpression of p-Akt and ErbB3 (p = 0.0005) can identify subsets of patients with a high probability of relapsing within five years due to a worse response to TAM therapy.

It is widely known that alpha6beta4 integrin expression and signaling are involved in the mechanisms that regulate tumor progression and resistance to apoptotic stimuli [4]-[9], [13], [15]. One of these mechanisms involves the ability of alpha6beta4 integrin to regulate the translation of ErbB-3 receptor in a manner which is eIF-4E-dependent [15]. The ErbB-3 up-regulation associated with alpha6beta4 integrin over-expression results in an increase of ErbB-2/ErbB-3 heterodimerization and consequent Akt phosphorylation favoring the survival of BC cells [15]. In the present work, we extended our previous study [15] to a novel panel of human BC cell lines which express different levels of alpha6beta4 integrin confirming that the integrin expression correlates with ErbB-3 protein positivity. We also showed that beta4 integrin depletion inhibits ErbB-3 translation and strongly reduces Akt activity while, ErbB-3 depletion abrogates Akt phosphorylation. Furthermore, the involvement of ErbB-3 in tumor progression was also supported by the finding that its depletion, in the absence of hormone stimuli, induces apoptosis, inhibits the in vitro invasion and favors TAM responsiveness. Given that ErbB-3 protein binds the regulatory subunit of PI3K but lacks kinase activity [24], our observations imply that ErbB-2/ErbB-3 sustains the survival of BC cells in the absence of ERs signaling through the activation of PI3K pathway. This hypothesis is strongly supported by recent findings which demonstrate that ErbB3 down-regulation by RNA interference abrogates ErbB-2-mediated TAM resistance in BC cells [25].

Our results are of particular clinical interest, since the anti-estrogen TAM plays a central role in the treatment of human BC. Nevertheless, many tumors appear to be refractory to TAM, making it necessary to discover predictive markers that can accurately identify hormone responsive tumors. In this setting, till the discovery of ERbeta, ERalpha was the single most informative marker, receptor-negative tumors rarely benefiting from endocrine therapy [26]-[27]. In particular, it is important to note that cell-based studies have suggested that coexpression of ERbeta in ERalpha-positive cells may modulate the ability of the cells to respond to estrogens [28]-[29] and studies using mice with targeted disruption of the ERbeta gene have further supported this idea [30]. There is considerable evidence suggesting that for each action to block estrogen stimulation of BC cells, there are different reactions that tumor cells can adopt to escape the attempts to block their growth [31]. The activation of growth factor signaling is involved in the mechanism of resistance to endocrine therapy and it has been hypothesized that it may substitute estrogen in sustaining the growth and survival of BC cells [31].

Even though we found a significant correlation between beta4 and ErbB-3 expression and ERbeta1 negativity, in the BCs we analyzed, the expression of the integrin did not influence the patient outcome.

ErbB-3 proteins mainly occurred in the P-Akt-positive and ERbeta1-negative BC derived from patients with lower DFS. Although previous experimental studies have implied that alpha6beta4 integrin facilitates tumor progression by regulating growth factor receptors signaling [15], to our knowledge this is the first study demonstrating an in vivo correlation between beta4 and ErbB-3 expression suggesting that beta4 can regulate ErbB-3 protein in vivo and favor indirectly tumor progression.

The high percentage of mammary tumors we analyzed which over-express beta4 integrin subunit is consistent with previous findings [8]. Although in vivo alpha6beta4 integrin expression has not been extensively evaluated, there are two separate studies reporting that 90% of advanced BC expressed alpha6 subunit [32] and that high level of alpha6beta4 expression in mammary tumor has prognostic value [33]. Furthermore, the over-expression of beta4 integrin subunit in the ERbeta1-negative tumors we have analyzed is also in agreement with a recent study which demonstrates that laminin-binding integrins and especially beta4 integrin subunit is elevated in ER-negative BC [34].

These and numerous other studies conducted in vivo in a smaller number of tumors clearly indicate that beta4 molecule mediates the signaling events which play a role in tumor progression [8]. This hypothesis is based on the capability of this integrin to enhance not only the translation of growth factor receptor but also of key growth factor such as VEGF [13], [35]. It has been observed that ablation of alpha6beta4 expression by shRNA in BC cells impaired the ability of these cells to form xenograft tumors and to produce VEGF [13]. Moreover, the finding that the depletion of alpha6beta4 integrin in mammary cells inhibits the PI3K pathway and facilitates the responsiveness to TAM treatment [12] correlates with the capability of alpha6beta4 integrin to regulate ErbB-3 translation and subsequent Akt activation [15]. We can hypothesize that alpha6beta4 integrin controls the translation of key molecules whose functions are strictly related to carcinoma survival. The ability of alpha6beta4 integrin to control ErbB-3 expression in vitro[15] and the strong relationship between beta4 and ErbB-3 receptor (P = 0.003, see Table 2) we observed in vivo confirms this hypothesis. Although in the BC we analyzed, beta4 does not directly influence the patient outcome, its expression may influence a different regulation of ErbB-3 and consequently, as suggested by our analyses, PI3K activation through its heterodimerization with ErbB-2. Collectively, these phenotypic alterations may have a significant impact on DFS.

From our data it is evident that ErbB-3 may represent a key molecule involved in the mechanisms of TAM resistance in ERbeta1-negative BC. This finding is in agreement with a recent report demonstrating that ErbB-3 modulates ErbB-2-mediated proliferation, colony formation and resistance to TAM treatment [25]. Even though there are many studies on the role of ErbB-2 in BC prognosis and therapeutic response, little is known regarding the role of ErbB-3 protein in these processes [18]. However, in agreement with our data, it has been found that the DFS is shorter in patients with ErbB-3 overexpression and that the level of ErbB-3 expression in primary BC seems to be involved in tumor progression from non-invasive to invasive tumors [36]. Moreover, it has also been shown that ErbB1-3 positive tumors had significantly poorer survival [37]. The strong relationship we found between ErbB-3 and P-Akt positivity and low DFS relative to patients with ERbeta1-negativity reinforces the hypothesis that growth factor signaling is involved in the mechanism of resistance to endocrine therapy. However, from our study, it is clear that ERbeta1 negativity appears to be the most powerful prognostic factor influencing DFS in response to TAM treatment and this data is in agreement with previous observations showing that low level of ERbeta predict resistance to TAM treatment [38]. Together these studies provide strong evidence that ERbeta1 is a predictor of response to TAM treatment in BC.

We can conclude that, even though the regulation of mammary tumor growth and survival by ERs and EGFR family members and the biology of beta4 integrin in tumors are not completely known, our in vitro and in vivo results provide strong evidence of a functional cooperation among these factors in supporting the survival of mammary tumors and this cooperation in ERbeta1-negative tumors may result in a decreased responsiveness to TAM therapy.

We studied a cohort of 232 hormonal receptor positive breast cancer patients surgically treated at the Regina Elena Cancer Institute (Rome, Italy) between 1986 and 2002, who had received an up-front adjuvant hormonal monotherapy with TAM at the dose of 20 mg per day for a maximum of 5 years. Invasive breast cancers were classified according to the World Health Organization Classification of Tumors [41] and were graded according to Bloom and Richardson. The information recorded for each patient consisted of: age at surgery, menopausal status, tumor size, axillary node status, histotype, and histologic grade. Patients selected for the study presented complete follow-up data and uniform methodology for hormone receptor content determination.

beta4 integrin, ERbeta1, P-AKT(ser473), ErbB-2 and ErbB-3 expression were assessed by indirect immunoperoxidase staining. Immunohistochemical staining was carried out on 5-microm-thick paraffin-embedded tissues. Sections were harvested on SuperFrost Plus slides (Menzel-Glaser, Braunschweig, Germany).

###begin p 84
The deparaffinized and rehydrated sections were pretreated by microwave in 1mM citrate buffer (pH6.0) at 430 W (two 10' cycles followed by a 5' one) for ERbeta1 and at 760 W (three 5' cycles) for p-AKT(ser473), ErbB-2, ErbB-3 and beta4 antigen.

Sections were incubated overnight with the anti-ERbeta1 (clone PPG5/10, Biogenex,Space, Milan, Italy), the anti-beta4 integrin (clone 450-11A directed to the cytoplasmic tail of the subunit) [12], the anti p-AKT(ser473) (Cell Signaling Technology, Sial, Rome, IT) and the anti-c-ErbB-3 (ErbB-3, clone RTJ-1, Novocastra Menarini, Florence, IT). ERbeta1 was considered positive when more than 20% of neoplastic cells showed a nuclear immunoreactivity. ErbB-2 and ErbB-3 overexpression was determined as defined in the HercepTest kit guide (0 or 1+ negative, 2+ and 3+ positive).

The integrin beta4 subunit was evidenced both in the membrane and in the cytoplasm of neoplastic cells and was scored considering both intensity and frequency from 0 to 2 according to the following criteria: 0. No Reaction, 1. Low Reaction (1-10% of positive cells with score +/++/+++ or >10-50% with score +), 2. High Reaction (>10-50% of positive cells with score ++/+++ or >50% with score +/++/+++). The P-AKT(ser473) immunostaining was scored as described for beta4 protein.

The immunoreactions were revealed by a streptavidin-biotin-peroxidase system (Super Sensitive Link-Label IHC Detection System, Biogenex) using 3-amino-9-ethylcarbazole (Dako, Milan, IT) as a chromogenic substrate. All sections were slightly counterstained with Mayer's hematoxylin and mounted in aqueous mounting medium (UCS Diagnostics, Rome, IT). Evaluation of the immunohistochemical results was done independently and in blinded manner by two investigators (M.M, and P.A.).

The correlation between beta4 integrin expression and the biopathological characteristic variables was tested by the Pearson Chi-Square test. For the purpose of our study, disease-free survival (DFS) was considered as a measure of poor outcome. The disease free survival was calculated from the date of tumor diagnosis to the date of first recurrence or metastasis. Patients without recurrence were censored at the time of last follow-up or death. The Hazard risk and the confidence limits were estimated for each variable using the Cox univariate model and adopting the most suitable prognostic category as the referent group. The DFS curves were estimated by the Kaplan-Meier product-limit method. The log-rank test was used to assess differences between subgroups, and significance was defined as p<0.05.

A multivariate Cox proportional hazard model was also developed using stepwise regression (forward selection) with predictive variables which were significant in the univariate analyses. The enter limit and remove limit were p = 0.10 and p = 0.15, respectively. The SPSS (11.0) statistical program was used for analysis.
