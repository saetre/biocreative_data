Inflammation is a hallmark of acute lung injury and chronic airway diseases. In chronic airway diseases, it is associated with profound tissue remodeling. Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-alpha (PPARalpha) is a ligand-activated transcription factor, that belongs to the nuclear receptor family. Agonists for PPARalpha have been recently shown to reduce lipopolysaccharide (LPS)- and cytokine-induced secretion of matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) in human monocytes and rat mesangial cells, suggesting that PPARalpha may play a beneficial role in inflammation and tissue remodeling.

We have investigated the role of PPARalpha in a mouse model of LPS-induced airway inflammation characterized by neutrophil and macrophage infiltration, by production of the chemoattractants, tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), keratinocyte derived-chemokine (KC), macrophage inflammatory protein-2 (MIP-2) and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1), and by increased MMP-2 and MMP-9 activity in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF). The role of PPARalpha in this model was studied using both PPARalpha-deficient mice and mice treated with the PPARalpha activator, fenofibrate.

Upon intranasal exposure to LPS, PPARalpha-/- mice exhibited greater neutrophil and macrophage number in BALF, as well as increased levels of TNF-alpha, KC, MIP-2 and MCP-1, when compared to PPARalpha+/+ mice. PPARalpha-/- mice also displayed enhanced MMP-9 activity. Conversely, fenofibrate (0.15 to 15 mg/day) dose-dependently reduced the increase in neutrophil and macrophage number induced by LPS in wild-type mice. In animals treated with 15 mg/day fenofibrate, this effect was associated with a reduction in TNF-alpha, KC, MIP-2 and MCP-1 levels, as well as in MMP-2 and MMP-9 activity. PPARalpha-/- mice treated with 15 mg/day fenofibrate failed to exhibit decreased airway inflammatory cell infiltrate, demonstrating that PPARalpha mediates the anti-inflammatory effect of fenofibrate.

Using both genetic and pharmacological approaches, our data clearly show that PPARalpha downregulates cell infiltration, chemoattractant production and enhanced MMP activity triggered by LPS in mouse lung. This suggests that PPARalpha activation may have a beneficial effect in acute or chronic inflammatory airway disorders involving neutrophils and macrophages.

Inflammation is a feature of both acute lung injury and chronic airway diseases. In chronic airway diseases such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), it is associated with profound tissue remodeling that contributes to impaired lung function [1]. Lipopolysaccharides (LPS), which are biological active components of the outer membrane of gram-negative bacteria, are important inducers of lung inflammation. Inflammatory response triggered by LPS is characterized by neutrophil and macrophage recruitment and by the release of chemoattractants including tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), and the CXC and CC chemokines, interleukin-8 (IL-8) and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1), respectively [2-5]. These inflammatory events reproduce some of the features of the inflammatory response observed during acute lung injury or COPD [1,6].

In mice, airway inflammation induced by LPS is associated with an increase of the matrix metalloproteinases (MMP), MMP-2 and MMP-9 [7,8]. MMP are a family of zinc- and calcium-dependent endopeptidases that play a major role in tissue remodeling [9,10]. Indeed, MMP degrade the majority of the extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins, including collagens, gelatins and proteoglycans, an activity which may contribute to lung injury by promoting infiltration accross basement membrane and activation of inflammatory cells [9,11]. Among MMP, MMP-2 (gelatinase A) preferentially produced by fibroblasts and other connective tissue cells, and MMP-9 (gelatinase B) mainly found in inflammatory cells, such as neutrophils and macrophages are of particular interest, since they cleave the major constituent of basement membrane, type IV collagen [9,10].

With the exception of neutrophils, normal tissues do not store MMP and constitutive expression is minimal. However, during inflammation and tissue remodeling, MMP expression is upregulated [9]. Levels or activity of several MMP have been found to be raised in animal models of acute lung injury (for review: [12]). Upregulation of MMP was also observed in chronic airway diseases associated with tissue remodeling, such as asthma and COPD (for review: [1,13]). Indeed, increased levels of MMP-9 have been reported in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF), blood or sputum from patients with asthma or COPD [14-17].

Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-alpha (PPARalpha) is a ligand-activated transcription factor, that belongs to the nuclear receptor family. PPARalpha regulates gene expression by binding as a heterodimeric complex with the retinoid X receptor to specific DNA sequences known as peroxisome proliferator response elements. PPARalpha was first identified for its role in the regulation of lipid and carbohydrate metabolism (for reviews: [18,19]). However, subsequent data have demonstrated that it exhibits also a potent anti-inflammatory activity. Indeed, mice deficient in PPARalpha (PPARalpha-/-) were reported to display an exacerbated reaction to various inflammatory stimuli, including LPS in the skin and the vessel [20-22]. Conversely, animals treated with PPARalpha activators such as fibrates exhibited a decreased response. Anti-inflammatory activity of fibrates appeared as unrelated to their lipid-lowering activity, since treatment with fenofibrate was shown to reduce inflammatory response associated with cerebral injury in absence of any improvement in plasma lipid levels in the mouse [23]. More recently, PPARalpha agonists were shown to reduce LPS- and cytokine-induced MMP-9 secretion in human monocytes and rat mesangial cells, suggesting that PPARalpha may also play a beneficial role in tissue remodeling [24,25].

Male wild-type (PPARalpha+/+) and homozygous knockout (PPARalpha-/-) mice (SV/129/C57BL/6) were expanded from breeding pairs [26] and used at the age of 9 weeks. Nine-week-old male C57BL/6 mice were purchased from Charles River Laboratories (Saint-Germain-sur-l'Arbresle, France). Animals were maintained under controlled environmental conditions with a 12 h/12 h light/dark cycle according to the EU guide for use of laboratory animals. Food (UAR-Alimentation, Villemoisson, France) and tap water were available ad libitum. Animal experimentation was conducted with the approval of the government body that regulates animal research in France.

Eighteen to twenty-four hours after the last LPS administration, mice were anaesthetized by i.p. injection of ketamine (150 mg/kg) and xylazine (10 mg/kg). A plastic cannula was inserted into the trachea and airways were lavaged by 10 instillations of 0.5 ml ice-cold saline supplemented with 2.6 mM EDTA (saline-EDTA). BALF recovered from the two first instillations were centrifuged (4100 rpm for 5 min at 4degreesC), and the resulting supernatant was stored at -20degreesC until MMP and cytokine measurements.

Cells were then resuspended in 500 mul ice-cold saline-EDTA and total cell counts were determined using a hemocytometer (Neubauer's chamber). Differential cell counts were assessed on cytologic preparations obtained by cytocentrifugation (Cytospin 3, Shandon Ltd, Runcorn, Chershire, UK) of 200 mul of diluted BALF (250 000 cells/ml in ice-cold saline-EDTA). Slides were stained with Hemacolor (Merck, Dormstadt, Germany) and determinations were performed by counting at least 400 cells for each preparation. Cells were identified as macrophages and neutrophils, and expressed as absolute numbers from total cell counts.

BALF samples were separated under non-reducing conditions by electrophoresis on a 7% acrylamide-separating gel containing 1 mg/ml gelatin and sodium dodecyl sulfate, as previously described [7]. After electrophoresis, gels were washed twice with 2.5% Triton X-100, rinsed with water and incubated overnight at 37degreesC in 50 mM Tris pH 8.0 containing 5 mM CaCl2 and 1 nM ZnCl2. Gels were stained with Coomassie Brilliant blue and destained in a 25% ethanol and 10% acetic acid solution. Gelatinase (MMP-2 and MMP-9) activities that appeared as clear bands against a blue background were quantified by measuring intensity of the bands by densitometry using the Densylab software (Bioprobe Systems, Les Ulis, France). Results were expressed as percentages of the intensity of a given sample loaded as internal standard onto each gel.

Cell infiltration induced by LPS was associated with a significant increase in BALF levels of the chemoattractants, TNF-alpha, KC and MCP-1 in both PPARalpha+/+ and PPARalpha-/- mice (Figure 2). These levels were however 1.5- (p = 0.0003), 2.3- (p = 0.0008) and 3.5-fold (p = 0.0012) greater, respectively in PPARalpha-/- animals when compared to PPARalpha+/+ mice (Figure 2). PPARalpha-/- mice exposed to LPS also displayed a significant rise in MIP-2 in BALF (2.0-fold, p = 0.0065), whereas LPS-treated PPARalpha+/+ animals exhibited no changes in this chemokine.

Saline-exposed PPARalpha-/- mice exhibited similar low MMP-2 (76 kDa) and MMP-9 (105 kDa) activity in BALF when compared to saline-exposed PPARalpha+/+ animals (Figure 3). Upon exposure to LPS, PPARalpha+/+ and PPARalpha-/- mice displayed a significant increase in both MMP-2 and MMP-9 activity, when compared to animals exposed to saline (Figure 3). MMP-2 levels were similar in LPS-treated PPARalpha-/- and PPARalpha+/+ mice (61 +/- 8 vs 58 +/- 4). In contrast, MMP-9 levels were 1.8-fold (p < 0.0001) greater in PPARalpha-/- animals than in PPARalpha+/+ mice.

Exposure to LPS resulted in marked increases in total cell, neutrophil and macrophage number in BALF from C57BL/6 mice (Figure 4). These increases were dose-dependently reduced by fenofibrate (0.15 to 15 mg/day). Reduction in total cell, neutrophil and macrophage number reached 80% (p < 0.0001), 91% (p < 0.0001) and 64% (p < 0.0001), respectively in BALF from mice treated with 15 mg/kg of the PPARalpha activator when compared to mice treated with the vehicle, CMC (Figure 4). Fenofibrate (15 mg/day) inhibited also total cell (p = 0.0055), neutrophil (p < 0.0001) and macrophage (p = 0.0064) infiltrate induced by LPS in PPARalpha+/+ mice (Table 1). In contrast, LPS-exposed PPARalpha-/- mice treated with 15 mg/day fenofibrate failed to exhibit changes in inflammatory cell infiltrate, demonstrating that PPARalpha mediates the anti-inflammatory activity of fenofibrate (Table 1).

Using both genetic and pharmacological approaches, our data clearly showed that PPARalpha downregulates cell infiltration, chemoattractant production and enhanced MMP activity triggered by LPS in mouse lung.

As expected, wild-type mice exposed to LPS exhibited a massive recruitment of inflammatory cells in the airways, composed of neutrophils and macrophages. This cell infiltration was associated with an increase in BALF levels of the pro-inflammatory and chemoattractant cytokine, TNF-alpha and by a rise in the levels of the CXC chemokines, MIP-2 and KC and of the CC chemokine, MCP-1. Exposure to LPS also induced a marked increase in MMP-2 and MMP-9 activity in BALF, when compared to saline exposure. This model reproduced several features of the inflammatory response observed during acute lung injury or COPD [1,6,13]. Using this model, we found that PPARalpha-/- mice exposed to LPS displayed enhanced neutrophil and macrophage number in BALF when compared to PPARalpha+/+ animals, whereas wild-type mice treated with the PPARalpha activator, fenofibrate exhibited reduced cell infiltrate. Furthermore, we demonstrated fenofibrate selectivity by showing absence of effect of fenofibrate in PPARalpha-/- animals. Taken together, these results suggest that PPARalpha activation may have a beneficial effect in airway inflammatory diseases involving neutrophil and monocyte recruitment. In agreement with our results, Birrell et al. recently proposed that agonists of another PPAR receptor, PPARgamma may have a therapeutic potential in respiratory diseases involving neutrophilia [29]. Our study adds to these previous findings by showing that PPARalpha agonists may also be effective in blocking recruitment of monocytes, which play a pivotal role in the pathophysiology of COPD, as well as of pulmonary fibrosis. By contrast, Trifilieff et al. found that PPARalpha ligands failed to inhibit neutrophil recruitment induced by LPS in BALF from mice [30]. Differences in the mode of exposure to LPS could explain this discrepancy. Indeed, whereas these authors exposed female mice intranasally to a single high dose of LPS (0.3 mg/kg) for a short period of time (3 h), the present study was carried out in male animals using four repeated instillations of a 7.5-fold lower dose of LPS (40 mug/kg). Indeed, these modes of exposure may trigger different inflammatory responses. Likewise, nature (GW 9578 vs fenofibrate) and route of delivery (local vs oral) of PPARalpha agonists may be another source of discrepancy. Therefore, by both genetic and pharmacological approaches, our data clearly demonstrate that PPARalpha downregulates neutrophil and monocyte infiltration in mouse lung.

We also found that PPARalpha-/- mice exposed to LPS displayed increased levels of TNF-alpha in BALF when compared to PPARalpha+/+ animals, whereas wild-type mice treated with fenofibrate exhibited reduced TNF-alpha levels. As a pro-inflammatory cytokine, TNF-alpha that is released by macrophages or airway epithelial cells upon activation plays an important role in neutrophilic inflammation induced by LPS [4]. Indeed, TNF-alpha triggers the release of CXC chemokines, such as MIP-2 and KC that are involved in LPS-induced intrapulmonary recruitment of neutrophils [2,3]. As well, MCP-1, which plays a central role in monocyte recruitment to inflamed tissues, is produced by pulmonary macrophages and airway epithelial cells in response to TNF-alpha or LPS [31,32]. In the present study, release of MIP-2, KC and MCP-1 triggered by LPS instillation was greater in BALF from PPARalpha-/- mice when compared to PPARalpha+/+ animals. Conversely, wild-type mice treated with fenofibrate displayed decreased levels of these chemokines when compared to vehicle-treated animals. Taken together, our results suggest that downregulation of TNF-alpha and of the CXC and C-C chemokines, MIP-2, KC and MCP-1 contributes to PPARalpha-induced inhibition of neutrophil and macrophage airway recruitment in our model.

PPARalpha agonists were recently reported to reduce LPS- and IL-1beta-induced secretion of MMP-9 in human monocytes and rat mesangial cells, respectively [24,25]. However, the effect of PPARalpha on MMP production in vivo is so far unknown. In the present study, we demonstrate that PPARalpha downregulates increase in MMP-2 and MMP-9 activity triggered by LPS in mouse lung. Indeed, whereas PPARalpha-/- mice displayed a greater increase in MMP activity in BALF upon exposure to LPS when compared to PPARalpha+/+ animals, wild-type mice exposed to LPS exhibited decreased levels of MMP when treated by fenofibrate. Sources of MMP in the lung are numerous, particularly under inflammatory conditions. Among them, neutrophils and macrophages are considered as the major sources of MMP-9 [11]. Therefore, downregulation of MMP-9 production by PPARalpha may result from decreased cell infiltration. In neutrophils, MMP-9 is stored in specific granules from which it is readily released, in particular upon stimulation by LPS or chemoattractant factors, like IL-8 [33]. Downregulation of MMP-9 production by PPARalpha could alternatively result from decreased neutrophil activation. MMP-9 is believed to play a major role in lung remodeling. Indeed, in addition to digestion of extracellular matrix proteins, MMP-9 increases the activity of other proteases, as well as of chemoattractants and growth factors (for review: [34]). By providing evidence that PPARalpha downregulates MMP activity in vivo, our study reinforces the idea that the nuclear receptor PPARalpha may play a beneficial role in tissue remodeling.

Several studies have reported that PPARalpha inhibits the NF-kappaB pathway, which plays a critical role in LPS signaling as well as in the expression of the chemokines, MIP-2, KC and MCP-1 and of MMP-9 [35]. This property could account for the beneficial effect of PPARalpha observed in the present study. However, several other mechanisms could be involved. This includes production of anti-inflammatory mediators, such as IL-10. Indeed, fenofibrate was reported to suppress autoimmune myocarditis in rats by stimulating expression of this cytokine [36]. As well, inhibition of cell recruitment could be implicated. Thus, activation of PPARalpha was reported to inhibit chemotaxis of inflammatory cells, including macrophages [37,38]. Finally, resolution of inflammation through stimulation of inflammatory cell apoptosis may also be involved, since activation of PPARalpha was shown to induce apoptosis of macrophages [39].

In conclusion, using both genetic and pharmacological approaches, our study provides evidence that PPARalpha downregulates neutrophil and monocyte infiltration induced by LPS in mouse lung. Our data also demonstrated that this beneficial effect of PPARalpha involves downregulation of the production of neutrophil and monocyte chemoattractants, including the CXC and C-C chemokines, MIP-2, KC and MCP-1, and of MMP that play a major role in tissue remodeling. We postulate that PPARalpha agonists, and in particular fenofibrate may have a therapeutic potential in airway inflammatory disorders involving neutrophil and monocyte, such as acute lung injury and COPD.
