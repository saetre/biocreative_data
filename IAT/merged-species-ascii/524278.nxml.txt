The human Ogg1 glycosylase is responsible for repairing 8-oxo-7,8-dihydroguanine (8-oxoG) in both nuclear and mitochondrial DNA. Two distinct Ogg1 isoforms are present; alpha-Ogg1, which mainly localizes to the nucleus and beta-Ogg1, which localizes only to mitochondria. We recently showed that mitochondria from rho0 cells, which lack mitochondrial DNA, have similar 8-oxoG DNA glycosylase activity to that of wild-type cells. Here, we show that beta-Ogg1 protein levels are approximately80% reduced in rho0 cells, suggesting beta-Ogg1 is not responsible for 8-oxoG incision in mitochondria. Thus, we characterized the biochemical properties of recombinant beta-Ogg1. Surprisingly, recombinant beta-Ogg1 did not show any significant 8-oxoG DNA glycosylase activity in vitro. Since beta-Ogg1 lacks the C-terminal alphaO helix present in alpha-Ogg1, we generated mutant proteins with various amino acid substitutions in this domain. Of the seven amino acid positions substituted (317-323), we identified Val-317 as a novel critical residue for 8-oxoG binding and incision. Our results suggest that the alphaO helix is absolutely necessary for 8-oxoG DNA glycosylase activity, and thus its absence may explain why beta-Ogg1 does not catalyze 8-oxoG incision in vitro. Western blot analysis revealed the presence of significant amounts of alpha-Ogg1 in human mitochondria. Together with previous localization studies in vivo, this suggests that alpha-Ogg1 protein may provide the 8-oxoG DNA glycosylase activity for the repair of these lesions in human mitochondrial DNA. beta-Ogg1 may play a novel role in human mitochondria.

Reactive oxygen species (ROS) generated during normal metabolism can oxidize proteins, lipids and nucleic acids (1,2). Oxidation of DNA is thought to be involved in tumorigenesis, aging and various degenerative disorders (3,4). 8-oxo-7,8-dihydroguanine (8-oxoguanine, 8-oxoG) is perhaps the best-characterized oxidative DNA adduct, and thought to be one of the most common. 8-oxoG pairs with adenine as well as cytosine in DNA (5). If the adenine opposite 8-oxoG in DNA is not removed GC-->TA transversions occur during DNA replication (6). The major pathway for the removal of 8-oxoG is base excision repair (7,8). Base excision repair is initiated by a lesion-specific DNA N-glycosylase that recognizes and excises the damaged base. Bacterial Fpg and eukaryotic Ogg1 proteins are the major 8-oxoG DNA glycosylases. Both enzymes possess an associated apurinic/apyrimidinic (AP) lyase activities, such that they remove 8-oxoG and cleave the DNA backbone (9). The biological relevance of the 8-oxoG DNA glycosylase activity is demonstrated by a recent study showing that low Ogg1 activity strongly associates with increased risk of lung cancer (10).

Mitochondria are the primary intracellular source of ROS. Particularly high levels of 8-oxoG have been detected in mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) (3,11), up to 16 times higher than in nuclear DNA (12). There is a growing body of evidence that accumulation of damage and mutation in mtDNA may contribute to tumorigenesis, aging and age-associated degenerative diseases (13-15). Mitochondria also possess an Ogg1 activity (16-18). Using OGG1-/- mice, we recently demonstrated that Ogg1 is the only 8-oxoG DNA glycosylase in mouse liver mitochondria and that liver mtDNA from these animals accumulates 20 times more 8-oxoG than wild type (WT) (19). Similarly, the disruption of Saccharomyces cerevisiae OGG1 gene causes spontaneous mutations in mtDNA, doubling the rate of petite formation in comparison to WT (20). Thus, Ogg1 appears to be essential for the maintenance of mtDNA integrity in eukaryotes (21).

The human OGG1 gene has been cloned by several groups [reviewed in (22)]. It consists of eight exons and produces two major distinct transcripts via alternative splicing (23-26). Thus, two isoforms of human Ogg1 proteins have been identified: alpha-Ogg1 (alternatively Ogg1 type 1a), and beta-Ogg1 (type 2a). alpha-Ogg1 mRNA is transcribed from exons 1 to 7, and beta-Ogg1 mRNA from exons 1 to 6 plus exon 8. The alpha-isoform is a 345 amino acids (39 kDa) protein that localizes mainly in nuclei, whereas beta-Ogg1 is a 424 amino acids (47 kDa) protein that appears to be localized exclusively in mitochondria (26,27). These studies, along with one report showing an 8-oxoG DNA glycosylase activity for beta-Ogg1 using large amounts of recombinant protein (25), led to the idea that beta-Ogg1 provides the 8-oxoG DNA glycosylase activity detected in human mitochondrial extracts.

The first 316 amino acids are common between the two isoforms, whereas the C-termini are quite different. The alpha-Ogg1 protein has been extensively characterized biochemically and structurally. The active site for DNA glycosylase activity requires Lys-249 and Asp-268, both located in the conserved helix-hairpin-helix structural element that is followed by a Gly/Pro-rich loop and a conserved aspartic acid motif (HhH-GPD), which is essential for DNA glycosylase as well as DNA binding activity (28-30). Arg-154 is required for recognition of the base opposite the damage (28,31). Amino acid residues 9-26 comprise a mitochondrial location signal (MLS) (26), though a dominant nuclear localization signal (NLS) is also present in amino acids 335-342 [Figure 1; (32)]. On the other hand, no information regarding substrate specificity, kinetic characteristics or binding activities is available for beta-Ogg1.

Human cells that lack mtDNA (rho0) are a particularly interesting model for studying the regulation of proteins involved in mtDNA transactions (33,34), nuclear-mitochondrial cross-talk and mitochondrial physiology and biochemistry (35). Although these cells do not have a functional electron transport chain, they still have mitochondria with a transmembrane potential and undergo mitochondrial-dependent apoptosis (36). We have recently demonstrated that rho0 cells retain most mtDNA repair activities, including 8-oxoG incision activity, at levels only slightly lower than WT cells (37). Here, we found a dramatic reduction in beta-Ogg1 protein levels in the mitochondria of rho0 cells. In order to reconcile these observations, we purified a recombinant beta-Ogg1 protein to characterize its biochemical properties. However, we failed to detect 8-oxoG DNA glycosylase activity in the recombinant protein. Since the C-terminal region of alpha- and beta-Ogg1 differ substantially and beta-Ogg1 lacks an alphaO helix that has been implicated in activity (38), we investigated whether the amino acid sequence different for the beta-isoform could account for its lack of DNA glycosylase activity. For these studies, we generated a series of mutant proteins, with specific amino acid substitutions in alpha-Ogg1 to identify the amino acid changes that could account for the inability of beta-Ogg1 to catalyze 8-oxoG excision. Our results indicate that the C-terminal alphaO helix is necessary for Ogg1 activity. We also identified a novel amino acid, Val-317, necessary for the DNA binding and glycosylase activities of this protein.

WT human alpha-OGG1-encoding region was amplified from pUC18-HOG1 by PCR using primers OG1-F-Bam and OG1-A-R-HIN as shown in Supplementary Table I. beta-OGG1-coding region was amplified from pPR171 using primers OG1-F-Bam and OG1-B-R-HIN. For construction of alpha-Ogg1 Stop325, primer Stop325 was used instead of OG1-A-R-HIN. Forward and reverse primers contained BamHI and HindIII restriction sites, respectively, and after digestion with appropriate restriction endonucleases, PCR-amplified fragments were inserted into the BamHI-HindIII site in pQE-30Xa. All mutant proteins were generated from the pQE-30Xa OGG1-WT plasmid by QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit II XL (Stratagene) with sets of forward and reverse primers according to the manufacture. To construct alpha-Ogg1 fused with beta-Ogg1 C-terminus, alpha-Ogg1 coding region at positions 1-327 was initially cloned into pQE- 30Xa BamHI-SalI site, followed by the cloning of the coding region of position 317-424 of beta-Ogg1 into the SalI-HindIII site. The DNA sequence of all of constructs was verified.

The culture was then transferred to 500 ml of LB broth supplemented with 200 mug/ml ampicillin and 25 mug/ml kanamycin, and incubated with vigorous shaking (200 r.p.m.) until OD600 reached 0.5. Culture flasks were placed on ice for 5 min to equilibrate the culture temperature, and 1 mM isopropyl-1-thio-beta-d-galactopyranoside (IPTG) was added. Bacteria were further incubated at 15degreesC for 20 h with vigorous shaking. Cells were collected by centrifugation at 3000 g for 10 min, washed once with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), and the pellet was stored at -80degreesC until use. Cell pellets were suspended in 10 ml of lysis buffer [20 mM HEPES-NaOH pH 7.4, 300 mM NaCl, Complete EDTA-free protease inhibitor cocktail, 0.5 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF), 0.05% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol]. After two cycles of freeze-thawing, the cells were sonicated and clarified by centrifugation at 27 000 g for 30 min. After addition of 20 mM imidazole to the supernatant, the sample was mixed with 2 ml of Ni-NTA agarose (Qiagen) equilibrated with lysis buffer containing 20 mM imidazole. After gentle mixing for 1 h at 4degreesC, unbound proteins were washed with 40 ml of lysis buffer containing 20 mM imidazole, and bound proteins were eluted with 10 ml of lysis buffer containing 60, 300 and 500 mM imidazole, sequentially. Most of the His-tagged human Ogg1 eluted in the 300 mM imidazole fraction. The active fraction was dialyzed against 1000 volumes of 20 mM HEPES-NaOH pH 7.4, 50 mM NaCl, 1 mM DTT and 50% glycerol, and stored at -20degreesC.

Pre-cultures were grown in 5 ml of LB medium supplemented with 200 mug/ml ampicillin, 25 mug/ml kanamycin and 1% glucose, transferred to 250 ml of 2x YT medium supplemented with 200 mug/ml ampicillin and 25 mug/ml kanamycin, and incubated at 37degreesC until OD600 reached 0.6. The temperature was then reduced to 15degreesC, and bacteria were incubated without IPTG-induction for 16 h. The cell pellet, obtained as described above, was stored at -80degreesC until use. Cell pellets were suspended in 10 ml of B/PERII reagent (Pierce) supplemented with protease inhibitor cocktail, and gently shaken for 10 min. Samples were clarified by centrifugation at 27 000 g for 15 min. GST-beta-Ogg1 was purified using a GST fusion protein purification kit (Pierce) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The active fraction was dialyzed to remove glutathione; glycerol was added to a final concentration of 10%, and the samples stored at -80degreesC.

His-tagged beta-Ogg1 was expressed in E.coli BK3004 cells that were previously transformed with pG-Tf2, which expresses the GroES-GroEL chaperone protein. BK3004 bacteria containing both pG-Tf2 and pQE-OGG1B were pre-cultured in 30 ml of LB medium supplemented with 200 mug/ml ampicillin, 25 mug/ml chloramphenicol and 25 mug/ml kanamycin. The pre-culture was transferred to fresh LB medium (3 l) containing 200 mug/ml ampicillin, 25 mug/ml chloramphenicol, 50 mug/ml kanamycin and 10 ng/ml tetracycline. After reaching an OD600 of 0.4, IPTG was added to a final concentration of 0.5 mM, and cultures were incubated for an additional 5 h at 30degreesC. Cells were spun down at 3000 g for 10 min, and washed once with PBS. Cell pellets were kept at -80degreesC until use. Cell pellets were suspended in Buffer A [20 mM HEPES-NaOH pH 7.4, 30 mM NaCl, 0.2% polyoxyethylene ether W-1 (Lubrol PX), 0.05% Triton X-100 and 10% glycerol] containing Complete EDTA-free protease inhibitor cocktail and 5 mM imidazole, and the cells were disrupted by sonication. For dissociation of the chaperone proteins from the recombinant Ogg1, 10 mM MgSO4 and 10 mM ATP were added to the sample, followed by incubation at 37degreesC for 10 min. Samples were kept on ice for 5 min and clarified by centrifugation at 20 000 g for 45 min at 4degreesC. Imidazole was added to the supernatant at 5 mM final concentration, the sample was mixed with 2 ml of Ni-NTA agarose equilibrated with buffer A containing 5 mM imidazole, and incubated at 4degreesC for 1 h with gentle rotation. Unbound proteins were washed out with 40 ml of buffer A containing 5 mM imidazole, and bound proteins were eluted with 20 ml of buffer A containing 20, 60, 300 and 500 mM imidazole, respectively. A single band eluted with 500 mM imidazole. This fraction was then dialyzed with 25 mM HEPES-NaOH pH 7.4, 50 mM NaCl, 20% glycerol and 0.5 mM PMSF. Samples were concentrated using a Microcon YM-30 (Millipore) and analyzed by SDS-PAGE, and the fraction containing Ogg1 was stored at -80degreesC.

Previously we reported that mitochondria from cultured human rho0 cells that lack mtDNA have only slightly reduced levels of 8-oxoG DNA glycosylase activity relative to WT cells (37). In the present study, we measured beta-Ogg1 protein levels in mitochondria isolated from those cells. Despite similar 8-oxoG incision activities, beta-Ogg1 protein level was significantly reduced (approximately80%) in rho0 cells as determined by western blot analysis (Figure 2A and C). These contradictory results suggested that either beta-Ogg1 is regulated differentially in rho0 or is not the major 8-oxoG DNA glycosylase in human mitochondria. Thus, we decided to characterize the biochemical properties of recombinant beta-Ogg1.

Human beta-Ogg1 has a putative membrane-binding domain in the C-terminal portion of the protein (Figure 1). In addition, immunohistochemical studies have suggested that the protein localizes to the inner mitochondrial membrane (40). In the present study, human beta-Ogg1 was expressed as hexa histidine- (His-) and glutathione S-transferase (GST)-tagged proteins, with the tags fused to the N-terminus of the protein. The solubility of the recombinant protein was very low, particularly for the His-tagged protein, possibly due to the acidic and hydrophobic nature of the C-terminus, and it often accumulated in inclusion bodies. To circumvent this problem, His-beta-Ogg1 (Figure 3A, lane 4) was co-expressed with the bacterial chaperones GroEL-GroES. His-alpha-Ogg1, His-beta-Ogg1 and GST-beta-Ogg1 were then purified from E.coli expression systems to near homogeneity (Figure 3A, lanes 1, 4 and 2, respectively). The estimated molecular masses, as determined from Coomassie blue-stained gels, were in agreement with the calculated molecular masses for the fusion proteins (Figure 3A). The identity of the recombinant proteins was also verified by western blot with His-, GST-, or mtOgg1-antibodies (data not shown).

alpha-Ogg1 removes 8-oxoG from DNA and cleaves the DNA strand at the 3' side of the resulting AP site via its AP lyase activity (beta-elimination). In order to compare the enzymatic activities of alpha- and beta-Ogg1, we performed an incision assay with an 8-oxoG containing oligonucleotide (Supplementary Table I). While His-alpha-Ogg1 efficiently incised the substrate at the 8-oxoG position, GST-beta-Ogg1 did not generate any cleaved products, even when 100-fold more recombinant beta-Ogg1 was used (Figure 3B). Longer incubation times resulted only in the appearance of non-specific cleavage products (Figure 3C). Similar results were obtained with His-beta-Ogg1 (data not shown). No cleavage products were detected from oligonucleotides containing 8-oxoG/G, 8-oxoG/A, 8-oxoG/T, 8-oxoG/C, G/C and AP site/C in the beta-Ogg1 (data not shown). We also failed to detect beta-Ogg1 8-oxoG DNA glycosylase activity following various modifications of the assay conditions, including length of oligonucleotides (up to 50mer), pH, NaCl, Zn2+ and Mg2+ concentrations (data not shown). Recombinant beta-Ogg1 expressed in a baculovirus expression system was also partially purified and analyzed. Again, no incision activity could be detected (data not shown), suggesting that the lack of activity is not due to some required post-translational modification specific to eukaryotic cells.

beta-Ogg1 also did not bind to an oligonucleotide containing 8-oxoG/C, as determined by EMSA (Figure 3D). Significant amounts of shifted DNA were observed in the lanes incubated with alpha-Ogg1, while incubation with beta-Ogg1 did not produce any significant complex formation. From these observations, we concluded that the recombinant form of beta-Ogg1 does not have 8-oxoG DNA glycosylase activity.

To investigate the possibility that the longer C-terminal domain of beta-Ogg1 inhibits catalytic activity, we generated a chimeric protein comprised of the alpha-Ogg1 catalytic domain (residues 1-327) fused to the beta-Ogg1 C-terminal tail (317-424) (Figure 4A). Due to the cloning strategy, two amino acids (Val-Asp) were also inserted into the junction of the MixAB fusion protein. The recombinant chimera (total length 437 amino acids, calculated molecular mass 51.5 kDa) was partially purified as a His-tagged protein (Figure 4B) and quantified by western blot, using a known concentration of His-alpha-Ogg1 as a standard. In the DNA incision assay, the MixAB protein showed similar 8-oxoG DNA glycosylase activity to that of WT alpha-Ogg1 (Figure 4C). The partially purified MixAB preparation showed two bands that cross-reacted with the anti-Ogg1 antibody, suggesting that part of the recovered protein had been cleaved into smaller species. To determine whether the glycosylase activity was due to the full length, 51.5 kDa MixAB chimera, or to the smaller, faster migrating species, we performed a NaBH4-trapping assay (Figure 4D). In the lanes incubated with MixAB protein, we detected a DNA-protein complex of slower mobility (lanes 5-7) than WT alpha-Ogg1 (lanes 2-4), suggesting that the MixAB protein retains the 8-oxoG DNA glycosylase activity. These results indicate that the longer C-terminal tail of the recombinant beta-Ogg1 per se does not cause the lack of 8-oxoG DNA glycosylase activity.

The function of the unique C-terminus of beta-Ogg1 (108 amino acid residues) is not known (Figure 1). Using a secondary structure prediction program (39), we predicted the formation of an alpha-helix (alphaO) in the C-terminus of alpha-Ogg1, but no formation of this alpha-helix in beta-Ogg1 (Figure 5A). The crystal structure of alpha-Ogg1 (28) confirmed the presence of an alphaO-helix domain in this region (amino acids 313-323). The study of Bruner and colleagues also showed that a phenylalanine residue at position 319 interacts with 8-oxoG, and may be critical for 8-oxoG recognition by the Ogg1 protein (Figure 5B, adapted from Entrez Structure pdb code 1HU0). Van der Kemp and co-workers (2004) recently reported that a F319A mutant alpha-Ogg1 is deficient in 8-oxoG DNA glycosylase and binding activities (38). beta-Ogg1 has a leucine at position 319, and thus may not form a complete alpha-helix in the C-terminus (Figure 5A and B). We aligned the Ogg1 amino acid sequences from various organisms (Figure 5A) and found that Phe-319 is highly conserved in all Ogg1 orthologues except in human beta-Ogg1.

In order to determine whether the phenylalanine to leucine substitution in beta-Ogg1 renders it inactive, we mutated Phe-319 in alpha-Ogg1 to the aliphatic amino acid glycine (F319G), disrupting the aromatic ring of phenylalanine, and to leucine (F319L), as found in beta-Ogg1. We purified the His-tagged mutant proteins F319G and F319L. The DNA sequence at the mutated sites of each expression vector was verified (Supplementary Figure 1A), and each protein was purified to homogeneity (Figure 6A). A mutant beta-Ogg1 protein, in which Leu-319 was substituted by phenylalanine was also generated, and partially purified (Figure 6B).

Glycosylase activity of the mutant proteins was determined using oligonucleotides containing 8-oxoG/C (Figure 6C). The F319G substitution in alpha-Ogg1 completely abolished 8-oxoG incision activity in the mutant alpha-Ogg1 protein (lanes 5-7), similarly to the F319A mutant reported by van der Kemp et al. (38). Interestingly, the F319L substitution in alpha-Ogg1, as found in beta-Ogg1, only partially decreased the activity, as incubation of the substrate with this mutant protein resulted in the generation of incision products (lanes 8-10), although the specific activity was 2.1-fold weaker than WT alpha-Ogg1 (lanes 2-4). Conversely, the mutant beta-Ogg1 L319F did not show any significant activity (lanes 11-13), suggesting that some other amino acid changes in beta-Ogg1 cause the lack of glycosylase function. The DNA binding activity of the mutant proteins to 8-oxoG was also characterized (Figure 6D). Surprisingly, the F319L mutant alpha-Ogg1 protein did not stably bind to the 8-oxoG/C-containing substrate (lanes 8-10), even though this mutant showed 8-oxoG incision activity. On the other hand, the lanes incubated with beta-Ogg1 L319F mutant showed some DNA binding activity. To confirm that the signal observed in the EMSA gel was indeed from L319F beta-Ogg1 mutant protein, an EMSA with cold substrate was resolved in a polyacrylamide gel and transferred to a PVDF membrane, and the membrane hybridized with anti-mtOgg1 antibody. As shown in Supplementary Figure 1B, the shifted signal in a radioactive EMSA corresponded to the western blot signal of beta-Ogg1. These observations suggest that Phe-319 is important, but its substitution alone does not explain the lack of 8-oxoG DNA glycosylase activity in beta-Ogg1.

Since the L319F substitution did not render beta-Ogg1 an active glycosylase, we systematically mutated each amino acid in the 317-323 region of alpha-Ogg1 to the corresponding amino acid in the beta-Ogg1 sequence, generating the mutants V317G, F319L, S320G, A321N, D322A, L323F (Figure 7A). A mutant alpha-Ogg1 in which the entire 317-323 stretch was substituted for the beta-Ogg1 sequence was also generated (317-323/alpha-beta). To further test the effect of end-capping of the alphaO-helix domain, the R324D mutant protein was also prepared. In order to investigate a possible contribution of the C-terminal portion (amino acids 326-345), a mutant protein lacking this region was generated (Stop325). These proteins were then expressed, partially purified and quantified by western blot. In NaBH4-mediated DNA trapping assays with 8-oxoG/C (Figure 7B), the mutant proteins V317G and F319L showed significantly weaker complex formation with 8-oxoG/C, indicative of lower DNA glycosylase activity. DNA-enzyme complex trapping was completely eliminated in the 317-323/alpha-beta mutant protein. Accordingly, 8-oxoG incision (Figure 7C) and DNA binding (Figure 7D) activity were much reduced in the V317G mutant compared with WT, and completely abolished in the 317-323/alpha-beta mutant. These results suggest that Val-317 is a critical residue for 8-oxoG DNA glycosylase activity, a residue that had not been identified previously.

We next generated the corresponding beta-Ogg1 mutant proteins in which positions 317 and 319 contained the amino acids found in alpha-Ogg1, G317V and G317V/L319F. However, neither substitution significantly increased 8-oxoG DNA incision or binding activities in these mutants protein (data not shown). It is possible that the alphaO-helix formation is still incomplete in these mutant proteins.

To evaluate the DNA binding activity of alpha-Ogg1 mutant proteins, EMSA was performed using a synthetic AP site analogue tetrahydrofran (THF)-containing oligonucleotide (Supplementary Figure 2). WT, F319G and F319L proteins showed efficient binding activity to THF, while V317G and 317-323/alpha-beta proteins did not. A K249Q mutant protein, previously shown to lack 8-oxoG DNA glycosylase activity and AP lyase activity (29), still retained significant binding activity to THF, suggesting that this mutation does not disrupt the recognition/binding mechanism (summarized in Table 1). Altogether, our results suggest that Val-317 is crucial for DNA binding activity. However, since the Val-317 mutant protein loses the ability to bind to the substrate in the first place, these analyses do not allow us to speculate whether it is also critical for catalytic activity.

The results above clearly indicate that beta-Ogg1 lacks 8-oxoG glycosylase activity, and thus this protein likely does not account for this activity in human mitochondria. We next purified mitochondria from GM1310 cells in order to evaluate the relative levels of Ogg1 isoforms in mitochondria in vivo. Before freeze-storage, mitochondria were purified as described in Materials and Methods and treated with Proteinase K to eliminate any cross-contamination of nuclear and cytosolic proteins. Purity of the mitochondrial suspensions was assessed by western blot with the abundant nuclear protein Lamin B1. As shown in Supplementary Figure 3, LaminB1 was readily detected in nuclear extracts but not detected in the mitochondrial fraction. beta-Ogg1 protein levels in GM1310 mitochondria were quantified by western blot using polyclonal anti-beta-Ogg1 antibody and purified GST-beta-Ogg1 as standards (Figure 8A). We estimated that 100 mug GM1310 mitochondria contained 218.5 fmol of beta-Ogg1. Nishioka et al. (26) detected about 5 ng of beta-Ogg1 in 100 mug of mitochondria from other human cell lines, corresponding to about 100 fmol beta-Ogg1 (Table 2). Since alpha-Ogg1 also contains a mitochondrial localization signal in its N-terminus, we measured alpha-Ogg1 levels in GM1310 mitochondria by western blot (Figure 8B). Possible nuclear contamination was again assessed and no LaminB1 signal was detected in up to 200 mug of mitochondria. In the blot with anti-Ogg1 polyclonal antibody, we detected a significant signal of approximately39 kDa protein in the mitochondrial fraction. We also detected a strong signal at approximately25 kDa in the mitochondrial fraction, which is likely a non-specific cross-reacting band, since there is no report of Ogg1 isoforms of such molecular weight. From those blots, we estimated that mitochondria contain 12.3 fmoles of alpha-Ogg1 per 100 mug protein.

To determine the relative distribution of alpha-Ogg1 between nuclear and mitochondrial compartments, we calculated the ratio of protein content between nuclear and mitochondrial fractions in GM1310 cells, using the ratio of nuclear LaminB over mitochondrial CoxIV from the whole cell extract. The levels of these two proteins were measured in whole cell (25 mug), nuclear (5 mug) and mitochondrial (50 mug) extracts by western blot (Table 3). A calculated ratio of 4.2:1 (nuclear:mitochondrial) was obtained. After standardization, we calculated that the semi-quantified amounts of alpha-Ogg1 were 132.3 and 12.3 fmol in 420 and 100 mug of nucleus and mitochondria, respectively (Table 2). This suggests that about 10% of alpha-Ogg1 localizes to mitochondria.

We report that recombinant beta-Ogg1 does not show 8-oxoG DNA glycosylase activity. Two residues that are not conserved in beta-Ogg1, Val-317 and Phe-319, were identified as necessary for DNA binding and 8-oxoG DNA glycosylase activity in alpha-Ogg1. These results explain the observation that rho0 mitochondria contained only 20% of beta-Ogg1 protein compared with WT, despite displaying similar 8-oxoG DNA glycosylase activity. We detected significant levels of alpha-Ogg1 in human GM1310 mitochondria, implying that this isoform may be responsible for 8-oxoG repair in mitochondria.

beta-Ogg1 has been considered to be the major 8-oxoG DNA glycosylase in human mitochondria since the observation by Nishioka et al. (26) that it localizes solely to this compartment. While cloning the human Ogg1 gene, Roldan-Arjona and colleagues purified beta-Ogg1 (25), and in that study, incision activity was detected on an 8-oxoG-containing oligonucleotide. However, those experiments employed very high concentrations of recombinant beta-Ogg1 (1 mug, 20 pmol) compared to substrate (75 fmol), resulting in a specific activity of beta-Ogg1 that was 100-fold lower than that of Fpg. We did not detect any glycosylase activity of beta-Ogg1 in this study under any of the numerous conditions tested (see below). Our experiments with rho0 cells (Figure 2) showed that beta-Ogg1 protein levels can decrease by 80% with no concomitant change in mitochondrial 8-oxoG incision activity. These observations suggest that beta-Ogg1 may not be the major mitochondrial 8-oxoG DNA glycosylase. It should also be noted that beta-Ogg1 is not present in rat and mouse [reviewed in (22)]. Using western blot detection of endogenous alpha- and beta-Ogg1 in human GM1310 mitochondria (Figure 8), we detected 12.3 fmol of alpha-Ogg1 and 218.5 fmol of beta-Ogg1 per 100 mug of mitochondria (Table 2). Thus, our data suggest that alpha-Ogg1 performs the 8-oxoG DNA glycosylase activity in human mitochondria. Among rat, mouse and human, the alpha-isoform of Ogg1 is highly conserved (84% identity in amino acid sequence) (22), underscoring the importance of alpha-Ogg1 in genomic stability.

Recombinant beta-Ogg1 was expressed and purified with two different fusion epitopes, GST and hexa-histidine, and from an fpg-deficient cell line in order to avoid contamination with endogenous E.coli Fpg protein. The His-fused beta-Ogg1 was also co-expressed with the chaperones, GroEL and GroES, which are bacterial homologues of the human mitochondria chaperones Hsp60 and Hsp10, to facilitate proper protein folding during expression (41). To address the possibility that a post-translational modification specific to eukaryotic cells was required for activity, we also purified beta-Ogg1 from an insect cell expression system. However, in all cases, no significant 8-oxoG DNA glycosylase activity was detected with recombinant beta-Ogg1, although alpha-Ogg1 expressed in parallel was active under all conditions. The beta-Ogg1 also did not display any AP-lyase activity. To investigate the strand scission, after incision reaction, we also stopped the reaction in the presence of NaOH with heat, and no cleaved product was detected (data not shown), suggesting no uncoupled glycosylase activity in beta-Ogg1. We therefore conclude that recombinant beta-Ogg1 may in fact not have a physiologically significant 8-oxoG DNA glycosylase activity. We have tested a wide range of relevant concentrations, buffers, conditions, and substrates.

The three-dimensional structure of the catalytic core of human Ogg1 in complex with 8-oxoG containing oligonucleotides has been solved at a resolution of 2.1 A (28). This study revealed that residues Cys-253 and Phe-319 interact with opposite pi-faces of 8-oxoG, suggesting that these amino acids form an 8-oxoG recognition pocket. 8-oxoG also forms hydrogen bonds with Gly-42, Gln-315 and two water molecules (Figure 5B). beta-Ogg1 lacks the phenylalanine residue at position 319 (Figure 5A). We used a site-directed mutagenesis approach to determine how the sequence differences between alpha- and beta-isoforms of Ogg1 affect 8-oxoG recognition and catalysis of its removal. During the preparation of this manuscript, van der Kemp et al. (38) reported that a F319A mutant alpha-Ogg1 lost 8-oxoG incision ability, similar to the F319G mutant we constructed (Figure 6C and D). Bacterial AlkA, MutY, Nth and human Ogg1 DNA glycosylases are all members of the endonuclease III family of proteins, with Trp-272 in AlkA, Met-185 in MutY and Ile-180 in Nth DNA glycosylases corresponding to Phe-319 of human Ogg1 (42-44). All these amino acids have hydrophobic side chains, suggesting that hydrophobic interactions are necessary for the formation of alpha-helix structures and for interactions with lesions in DNA. The absence of this phenylalanine residue in beta-Ogg1 suggests that this protein lacks the critical 8-oxoG recognition structure. This conclusion is further supported by the observation that the F319L alpha-Ogg1 mutant protein lost DNA binding activity, although it retained some DNA glycosylase activity (Figure 6C and D). Moreover, the L319F beta-Ogg1 mutant protein showed slightly recovered DNA binding activity to 8-oxoG, but no detectable 8-oxoG DNA glycosylase activity. These observations can be reconciled if Phe-319 is critical for 8-oxoG recognition, with other critical amino acid residues present in the C-terminal alphaO helix playing a more prominent role in the base excision reaction. In this study, we found that the V317G mutant alpha-Ogg1 also lost DNA glycosylase activity. Val-317 is located in the middle of the alphaO helix, and its side chain does not face 8-oxoG, whereas the residues Gln-315 and Phe-319 do (Figure 5B). It is likely that Val-317 does not directly interact with 8-oxoG, however, since valine is a hydrophobic amino acid contributing to alpha-helix stabilization, V317G mutant protein likely causes disruption of the alphaO helix, preventing correct positioning of the 8-oxoG for Ogg1 activity. As summarized in Table 1, our results suggest that stable formation of the alphaO helix is critical not only for 8-oxoG DNA glycosylase activity but also for DNA binding activity.

In order to excise 8-oxoG from DNA, Ogg1 is thought to initially bend the DNA at the minor groove of undamaged DNA, searching for modifications that can promote drastic kinking (45). 8-oxoG stimulates the bending of DNA, causing a greater distortion of the DNA double helix structure at the damage site (46). Ogg1 then finds this distortion and likely flips the 8-oxoG residue out, allowing for the interaction of the lesion with a specific pocket in the protein. These interactions then allow the catalytic activity of Ogg1 to take place, cleaving the N-glycosylic bond and releasing 8-oxoG. Norman et al. (47) investigated the structure of a catalytically inactive Ogg1 mutant (K249Q) with oligonucleotides containing either 8-oxoG or an abasic site analogue (THF) that is not cleaved by Ogg1. They suggested that substrate recognition and catalysis were coupled, observing that the alphaO-helix slightly shifted away from the active site residue Asp-268. This phenomenon would explain why the F319A mutant retains about 60% of AP lyase activity compared with WT (38) and that the F319L mutant (Figure 6) looses binding activity but retains some 8-oxoG incision activity. Based on these findings, we conclude that beta-Ogg1 lacks DNA glycosylase activity because its amino acid sequence does not support the correct assembly of the C-terminal alphaO helix. Further support for this conclusion comes from the observation that substituting seven amino acids in alpha-Ogg1 in the alphaO helix region, positions 317-323, with the corresponding sequence in beta-Ogg1 (317-323/alpha-beta protein, Figure 7) completely abrogates 8-oxoG DNA glycosylase activity.

In this study, we presented evidence that recombinant beta-Ogg1 does not have DNA glycosylase activity due to the lack of the C-terminal alphaO helix (Figure 7), and alpha-Ogg1 is present in human mitochondria (Figure 8) and probably accounts for the 8-oxoG incision activity. The question still remains whether beta-Ogg1 has glycosylase activity in vivo, and if not, what its biological role is. For instance, the possibility exists that beta-Ogg1 has repair activities for novel substrates, such as base lesions and RNA substrate, or requires yet unidentified co-factors, including other proteins. It should be noted that beta-Ogg1 contains a long tail located in the C-terminus of the protein. This tail was predicted to form a long coiled-coil structure, spanning a transmembrane domain (Figure 5A), which may suggest a role in anchoring the protein in membranous structures. The long tail per se did not affect 8-oxoG DNA glycosylase activity as shown in Figure 4. It is also possible that beta-Ogg1 participates in another step of base excision repair since it retains the HhH-GPD motif which is highly conserved in EndoIII DNA glycosylase family, and this is currently under investigation. We are now developing beta-Ogg1 knock-down and/or over-expressing cell lines to obtain a better understanding of the biological roles of beta-Ogg1.

 Structure of the two major human Ogg1 isoforms. Schematics of alpha- (345 amino acids) and beta-Ogg1 (424 amino acids) proteins are shown. The first 316 amino acids are common for both isoforms, while the C-termini vary considerably. The mitochondrial localization signal (MLS, position 9-26), nuclear localization signal (NLS, 335-342) and HhH-GPD motif are indicated. The functions of amino acids Gly-12, Arg-154, Lys-249 and Asp-268 are indicated, based on previous functional studies. The function of the beta-Ogg1 C-terminus is unknown. A transmembrane domain (position 400-422) in a highly hydrophobic region was predicted by the SOSUI system (32).

 Effect of the long C-terminal tail of beta-Ogg1 on 8-oxoG DNA glycosylase activity. (A) The catalytic domain of alpha-Ogg1 (position 1-327) was fused to the long C-terminal tail of beta-Ogg1 (317-424). At the junction, two internal amino acids (Val-Asp) were inserted because of the cloning strategy, to generate restriction endonuclease SalI site. This engineered protein was named as MixAB. (B) The MixAB protein was partially purified as a His-tagged protein from E.coli fpg-deficient cells, and the amount of the MixAB protein was quantified by western blot using a known concentration of purified His-alpha-Ogg1. The arrowhead indicates the signal corresponding to His-MixAB protein (calculated molecular mass 51.5 kDa). (C) 8-oxoG DNA glycosylase activity of MixAB protein. WT alpha-Ogg1 (lanes 2 and 3) and MixAB (lanes 4 and 5) protein were incubated with a 30mer oligonucleotide (10 nM) containing 8-oxoG/C, at 37degreesC for 30 min. The concentrations of protein added were 1 nM (lanes 2 and 4) and 10 nM (lanes 3 and 5). (D) NaBH4-mediated DNA trapping assay: 100 mM NaBH4 was added to the DNA glycosylase assay, in order to covalently link the complex between substrate and reacting protein. The products were separated on 8-16% Tris-glycine SDS-polyacrylamide gel. C1 and C2 indicate substrate complexes with MixAB and WT alpha-Ogg1, respectively. The concentrations of protein added were 50 nM (lanes 2 and 5), 100 nM (lanes 3 and 6) and 500 nM (lanes 4 and 7).

 Structure of the C-terminus of Ogg1. (A) Sequence alignments of Ogg1 orthologues from various species. The C-terminal amino acid sequences were obtained from Entrez Protein entries in NCBI, and aligned by ClastalW. The conserved phenylalanine (amino acid 319) in the human alpha-Ogg1 is marked. The other conserved amino acids are shaded. Secondary structure of human alpha- and beta-Ogg1 proteins was predicted using the computer-based GOR secondary structure prediction program and the SOSUI system, as described in Materials and Methods, and the predicted helix domain is illustrated. The NLS (335-342) in alpha-Ogg1 and the transmembrane domain (400-422) in beta-Ogg1 were expressed as helix domains. The formation of the alphaO helix domain (313-323 in alpha-Ogg1) has been found previously (28). (B) Relative location of alphaO helix and 8-oxoG residue in the active pocket. This figure was obtained from Entrez Structure (pdb code 1HU0) and modified by Cn3D. Important amino acids residues are marked in yellow.

 Screening of 8-oxoG DNA glycosylase-deficient mutant alpha-Ogg1 proteins. (A) Amino acid sequence alignment of the alphaO helix domain from alpha- and beta-Ogg1 proteins. alphaO helix domain is located between amino acids 313-323 in alpha-Ogg1. Since the first 316 amino acids are common between alpha- and beta-Ogg1 proteins, only positions 317-323 were targeted for site-directed mutagenesis. Each amino acid in alpha-Ogg1 was substituted with the corresponding amino acid in beta-Ogg1. As a result, V317G, F319L, S320G, A321N, D322A, L323F His-alpha-Ogg1 mutant proteins were generated. R324D was also generated to test the effect of alphaO helix-end capping. In addition, all seven amino acids in alpha-Ogg1 were substituted at once for those in beta-Ogg1 (317-323/alpha-beta). To exclude the effect of positions 326-345 in alpha-Ogg1 on the activity, a Stop325 protein was also generated, in which positions 326-345 were deleted. (B) DNA trapping assay: 1 pmol of each protein was applied to a NaBH4-mediated DNA trapping assay with oligonucleotide containing 8-oxoG/C, as described earlier. Purified Fpg protein (30.2 kDa) was used as positive control. (C) DNA incision assay with mutant proteins. WT, V317G, F319L and 317-323/alpha-beta Ogg1 proteins were used for DNA incision assay with 10 nM of oligonucleotides containing 8-oxoG/C. The protein amounts added were 0 (lane 1), 1 nM (lanes 2, 5 and 8), 5 nM (lanes 3, 6 and 9) and 10 nM (lanes 4, 7 and 10). For lanes 11-13, 10 nM (lane 11), 100 nM (lane 12) and 500 nM (lane 13) of 317-323/alpha-beta alpha-Ogg1 mutant proteins were added to reactions. (D) DNA binding assay: 10 nM of oligonucleotide containing 8-oxoG/C was incubated with WT (10, 50 and 100 nM), V317G, F319L and 317-323/alpha-beta (10, 100 and 500 nM). Products were analyzed by EMSA.
