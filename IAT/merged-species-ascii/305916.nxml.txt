A novel in situ hybridization technique is described. This non-radioactive technique combines, for the first time, the high spacial resolution and rapid signal development of the non-isotopic approach with the previously unrivalled sensitivity of autoradiography. The procedure, which employs biotin labelled DNA probes and a streptavidin-alkaline phosphatase based detection system, is compatible with pre G-banding and can be performed on archival material. Unique sequences as small as 1 Kb are detectable. Using this technique, we have mapped the N-myc oncogene and the gene for beta-Nerve Growth Factor to 2p24 and 1p13 respectively.
