NF-kappaB is a prototypic stress-responsive transcription factor that acts within a complex regulatory network. The signaling dynamics of endogenous NF-kappaB in single cells remain poorly understood. To examine real time dynamics in living cells, we monitored NF-kappaB activities at multiple timescales using GFP-p65 knock-in mouse embryonic fibroblasts. Oscillations in NF-kappaB were sustained in most cells, with several cycles of transient nuclear translocation after TNF-alpha stimulation. Mathematical modeling suggests that NF-kappaB oscillations are selected over other non-oscillatory dynamics by fine-tuning the relative strengths of feedback loops like IkappaBalpha. The ability of NF-kappaB to scan and interact with the genome in vivo remained remarkably constant from early to late cycles, as observed by fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP). Perturbation of long-term NF-kappaB oscillations interfered with its short-term interaction with chromatin and balanced transcriptional output, as predicted by the mathematical model. We propose that negative feedback loops do not simply terminate signaling, but rather promote oscillations of NF-kappaB in the nucleus, and these oscillations are functionally advantageous.

In mammalian cells, various signals such as hormones, cytokines, and cell-cell interfaces elicit changes in gene expression mediated by inducible transcription factors. Many latent transcription factors also induce expression of genes that provide feedback loops upon their signaling pathways. The negative feedback genes are generally thought to functionally terminate the signaling action of the transcription factor. These feedback loops also create the potential for the transcription factor activity to oscillate between active and inactive states over hours [1], [2], [3]. However, the significance of such oscillations is unclear. Are periodic cycles a mere side effect of the pathway settling back to the basal state, or do they have a functional role in signaling?

NF-kappaB is a classical example of a transcription factor subject to negative feedback loops. NF-kappaB regulates numerous cell signaling processes and its activity is controlled in part by the level of nuclear translocation. In resting cells, the predominant dimer p65:p50 exists mostly as a cytoplasmic complex bound to its inhibitor IkappaB proteins. Numerous upstream signals induce degradation of the IkappaB proteins following phosphorylation by the IkappaB kinase complex (IKK). This release from latency in the cytoplasm allows active NF-kappaB to translocate into the nucleus and activate expression of target genes, including several feedback genes [4]. One such target is the Nfkbia gene which codes for IkappaBalpha. The re-synthesis of IkappaBalpha acts as strong negative feedback, causing the inactivation of NF-kappaB and its re-localization to the cytoplasm. However, previous biochemical and genetic investigations have indicated that the propensity to oscillate, driven by induction of IkappaBalpha, is counteracted by mechanisms that modulate and dampen the oscillation [4], [5], [6], [7]. Observations at least from cell populations show rapid down-regulation of NF-kappaB after activation. This has led to the view that NF-kappaB signaling is biphasic, i.e. its activity rises rapidly and is strongly attenuated by feedback inactivation, and an oscillatory behavior after the first cycle of NF-kappaB activity might be insignificant or even deleterious for cellular function. However, the inherent limitation of kinetic studies using cell populations [1], [3], [8], [9] is that transient activities that are not synchronized from cell to cell cannot be detected even by the most quantitative assays (Fig. 1A) [10], [11].

(A) The population average time course of nuclear NF-kappaB (red) can show strongly damped oscillation even when the individual cells (black, 20 out of 1000 shown) have sustained oscillatory dynamics. Thousand hypothetical sine waves were generated to have a period slightly varying from 2 hours (15% S.D. in cycle frequency) and linearly decreasing amplitude. The late peaks become unsynchronized, making the average profile appear constant. (B) The knock-in mice have the endogenous p65 locus replaced by GFP-p65 and have wild-type phenotype. (C) A typical time series of a single living cell treated with 10 ng/ml TNF-alpha and imaged overnight. The low GFP level required special image acquisition setup.

The nuclear:total ratio of GFP-p65 plotted is for the cell in (C), where the labeled arrows correspond to the images. The ratio was obtained as the mean nuclear intensity divided by mean cellular intensity (see Methods). The periodogram on right has a single sharp peak and indicates that the estimated period is approximately1.5 hours for this cell.

Here, we report single-cell observations that show the prevalence of sustained oscillations in endogenous NF-kappaB localization. Using instant perturbations of the system and real-time monitoring, we show that the network dynamics can be altered as predicted by a mathematical model. We also observe a previously unsuspected nucleus-to-cytoplasm transport of active NF-kappaB. Through computational modeling and experimental evaluation, we explore the signaling roles of distinct NF-kappaB dynamics that occur in multiple timescales. Finally, we find that the fast interaction of NF-kappaB with chromatin remains the same from first to later cycles of nuclear localization, and the recurrent cycles contribute productively to the transcriptional output of the system.

To observe real time dynamics, we monitored the localization of NF-kappaB in single living cells, which are the basic unit for pathway operations and are the definitive context for probing pathway dynamics unambiguously. We used fibroblasts derived from knock-in mice where the endogenous p65 gene was replaced by GFP-p65 (Fig. 1B) [12]. This approach allows live cell imaging of the endogenous p65, without any of the potential problems associated with over-expressed proteins. The protein expression level of GFP-p65 in our knock-in fibroblasts was comparable to that in wild-type fibroblasts ([12] and data not shown). Activation profiles of p65 target genes in response to TNF-alpha were also very similar to wild-type cells ([12] and data not shown). Together with the normal phenotype of the knock-in mice [12], these data indicate that the GFP-p65 is functional and the NF-kappaB regulatory network is physiological. Since the expression of GFP-p65 was as low as the endogenous level, a microscope with a special optical scanner was necessary to visualize and quantify the GFP signal (see Materials and Methods, Fig. S1, Videos S1, S2).

Figure 1 (C, center plot in D) shows an example of a time lapse experiment after TNF-alpha stimulation where we quantify the nuclear:total ratio of GFP-p65. The long-term dynamics of p65 in individual single cells ranged from 1approximately2 cycles to dramatic oscillations with 6approximately7 cycles. A minority of cells had a single cycle with subsequent minor and irregular fluctuations (8 oscillating cells and 2 non-oscillators are shown in Fig. 2A). Most cells showed multiple striking peaks; later peaks had gradually decreasing amplitudes but were clearly discernible. Often the p65 flux out of the nucleus between the periodic cycles was so efficient as to reduce the nuclear level to a basal state. We subjected the time course data from 95 cells to Fourier analysis (Fig. 1D) and found that the majority of the cells (79%) oscillated with a somewhat variable period with a median value of 2.2 hours (n = 75, Fig. 2B). Cells that were not treated with TNF-alpha had no nuclear translocation of p65 as expected (Fig. 2A bottom panel). Although we classified the time courses into two categories by the presence/absence of a strong periodic component, we cannot rule out the possibility that even the 'non-oscillating' cells may have weak oscillations which can nevertheless mediate some signaling effect.

To gain systems-level insight on the parameters that influence the observed NF-kappaB behavior in different cells after TNF-alpha stimulation, we explored variability and robustness properties of a minimal mathematical model that captures some essential pathway components (see Fig. 3A and Supplementary Information, Fig. S2) [13]. Parameter analysis is often done by varying one parameter at a time, fixing all the other parameter values. While computationally manageable, this results in an extremely limited investigation of the system properties [14] (Fig. 3B). Instead, we employed an extensive multi-parameter sampling approach, where a large set of random parameter combinations was chosen for model simulations. Exploration of a range of possible parameter values is necessary because of the uncertainty in the model parameter values that were inferred or compiled from reported experiments [15]. In fact, individual cells are likely to have slightly variable rate constants for each molecular process in the model.

It includes essential regulatory events such as IKK activation, inducible/constitutive degradation of IkappaBalpha, nuclear import/export, inducible synthesis of IkappaBalpha, and post-stimulus attenuation of IKK activity. The quantitative model is described in full by the differential equations in Fig. S2A. (B) Two different approaches for parameter variation. Unlike single parameter variation, where one parameter is varied at a time from the reference value and the rest are fixed (top), we varied all parameter values simultaneously in a random fashion (bottom). (C) The dynamical model was numerically solved for a random sample of 1000 parameter combinations. Each kinetic parameter was varied by two orders of magnitude around the reference value (see Supplementary Information). From the simulated temporal profiles eight dominant patterns were extracted by K-means cluster analysis (K = 8). For each cluster, individual time courses of free nuclear p65 are shown in black, and a representative profile is in red. The underlying system parameter values (s, neg) that correspond to the simulations within the given cluster are presented to the right of each cluster plot. Only the two most influential parameters are plotted out of 18 co-varied parameters. The red dot indicates the reference parameter values.

Our computer simulations revealed several possible patterns of response for the NF-kappaB network after activation (Fig. 3C). Distinct patterns were readily identifiable when the K-means clustering algorithm was applied to group similar time courses. Numerous optimizations of K-means with different numbers of clusters indicated that these eight clusters were reproducible and representative. The patterns that closely represent the experimentally observed oscillatory profiles (clusters 5, 7, and 8, Fig. 3C; Fig. 2A, left 8 plots) were from parameter values that occupy a significantly broad region in the 18-dimensional parameter space. This implies that oscillation is a robust feature of this network.

Our multi-parameter variation analysis also shows a pattern with non-oscillating, one-peak responses (cluster 2), which is similar to the experimentally observed profile of non-oscillating cells (Fig. 2A, right 2 plots). This pattern resulted from parameter values for hyperactive IkappaBalpha induction and/or fast IKK inactivation. Thus, with an appropriate choice of feedback parameter values, the NF-kappaB system could operate in a non-oscillating mode, which may be embodied by the non-oscillating cells. The absence of some computationally predicted scenarios (clusters 1, 3, 4, and 6) from the experimentally observed time course profiles could be partly due to some unrealistic combinations of parameter values in our variation analysis. Alternatively, it might reflect a preference of the NF-kappaB regulatory network for oscillations, suggestive of functional advantage.

Next we extensively examined the correlation of these distinct responses with the underlying parameter values, and found that 16 out of 18 parameters had no clear influence on system dynamics (Fig. S2E), while inducible synthesis of IkappaBalpha and post-stimulus IKK inactivation are the major processes that determine the kinetic behavior (Fig. 3C). Notably, these are precisely the mechanisms that represent the two classes of negative feedback loops in the regulatory network. For example, low IkappaBalpha synthesis rate and/or persistent IKK activity explain the aberrant response pattern with no post-stimulus attenuation (cluster 3).
###end p 21
###begin p 22
Taken together, observed dynamic patterns and modeling indicate that diverse behaviors, including non-oscillatory responses, are possible from the NF-kappaB network, and indeed a small fraction of cells do not oscillate. The above multi-parameter variations suggest that the relative strengths of the two classes of negative feedback is a strong determinant of NF-kappaB dynamics and that the oscillatory behavior represents a robust but selective pattern of the network dynamics. The prevalence of the oscillatory pattern, over other possible behaviors, suggests that it might be chosen for specific function and adaptive value, rather than imposed by the system design and thus inevitable.

Next we wished to investigate the functional role of NF-kappaB dynamics by altering the natural oscillations. Some commonly used perturbation methods, however, presented serious problems for our systems approach. For example, siRNA, widely used for specific down-regulation of genes, would be impossible to model at the single cell level because silencing action takes effect over a long time (approximatelyhours) with its own kinetics, and cell-to-cell heterogeneity is invariably significant. Similarly, genetically disrupted cells settle into altered steady states long before the experiments by compensatory mechanisms, complicating model-based comparison of mutant behavior to that of wild-type. Thus, we chose to use nearly instantaneous inhibitors that interfere with key steps in the NF-kappaB network, using Leptomycin B (LMB), an inhibitor of nuclear protein export, and Cycloheximide (CHX), an inhibitor of protein synthesis.

LMB blocks nuclear export of p65 into the cytoplasm, an enabling mechanism behind NF-kappaB oscillation. When cells are simultaneously treated with TNF-alpha and LMB, a single pulse of free nuclear NF-kappaB is expected to be followed by the formation of the NF-kappaB:IkappaBalpha complex in the nucleus. This is also predicted by model simulations (Fig. 4A, upper panel; Parameter values were from cluster 5, 7, 8 in Fig. 3C, and all export rates were reduced by 105-fold at t = 0; An example decomposition plot for TNF-alpha alone is shown in Fig. S2C for comparison). Time lapse imaging confirmed that total nuclear p65 accumulates in the nucleus (Fig. 4B, upper panel). The nuclear retention of IkappaBalpha-bound inactive NF-kappaB by LMB matches previous reports well [16].

(A) Perturbed dynamics were simulated using the model in Fig. 3 and the parameter values from clusters 5, 7, and 8, with the additional modifications to nuclear export terms or the induced IkappaBalpha synthesis term for LMB or CHX effects, respectively (see text). The graphs show the time courses of free, IkappaBalpha-complexed, and total p65 in the nucleus, as predicted by the model. The red curves indicate the free and complexed components of a typical profile of nuclear p65. Inhibition of nuclear export allows one cycle of free p65 whereas inhibition of negative feedback induces constant activity. (B) Experimentally observed time lapse profiles of nuclear p65 level for single cells co-treated with LMB or CHX. Cells were treated with 10 ng/ml TNF-alpha and either 5 nM LMB or 2.5 microg/ml CHX, and followed by live cell imaging. (C) Nuclear export of free p65 was simulated using the model in Fig. 3 with the parameter values from clusters 5, 7, and 8, and s was reduced by 100-fold at t = 0 for the CHX effect. In addition, nuclear import parameters (iNF, iI) were reduced to 10-5 at t = 90 min after TNF-alpha and CHX co-treatment. The total nuclear p65 amount (which is close to the free p65 amount under this condition) is shown in the upper panel. The first 10 minute interval after inhibition of import is plotted on the expanded time axis on the right, to facilitate comparison to the experimentally measured time course in (D). (D) Fluorescence loss in photobleaching (FLIP) was performed to determine any ongoing exchange of p65 between the nucleus and the cytoplasm after its apparently complete nuclear translocation induced by TNF-alpha alone or in co-treatment with CHX or LMB. A circular spot in the cytoplasm was repeatedly bleached for 10 minutes while the nuclear mean intensity was monitored (inset). The relatively short timeframe for the FLIP protocol did not allow measurements up to complete loss of GFP signal. Error bars are S.E.

On the other hand, co-treatment of CHX together with TNF-alpha inhibits IkappaBalpha re-synthesis, a dominant mechanism that drives the system dynamics toward oscillatory regimes. Live imaging showed that CHX constrains p65 in the nucleus for hours, as expected (Fig. 4B, lower panel). Nuclear p65 is predicted to be active (free of IkappaBalpha) under this condition (Fig. 4A, bottom panel; Parameter values were from cluster 5, 7, 8 in Fig. 3C, and s was reduced by 100-fold at t = 0).

We noticed an unexpected difference between the time lapse imaging data from TNF-alpha only, TNF-alpha/LMB co-treated, and TNF-alpha/CHX co-treated cells: The temporal profiles of nuclear GFP-p65 in cells treated with TNF-alpha and LMB showed significantly higher peak translocation, in comparison to cells treated with TNF-alpha alone or with CHX (Fig. S3). This suggests the existence of the reverse-translocating (nucleus-to-cytoplasm) p65 molecules even during the early activation phase of NF-kappaB after TNF-alpha treatment, which had not been appreciated previously. It also implies that the nuclear p65 level at a given moment is simply the net result of the constituent fluxes.

We therefore asked whether p65 molecules may be exported from the nucleus independently of IkappaB. First, we ran model simulations with the IkappaBalpha synthesis rate set to zero (at t = 0), and also all nuclear import rates were reduced to zero when nuclear NF-kappaB level is maximal (at t = 90 min). If there was no export, blockade of nuclear import at this time would not have any effect on the nuclear p65 level. The simulation results showed gradual efflux of p65 into the cytoplasm that is appreciable within minutes for a wide range of parameter values (Fig. 4C). This was due to the slow export of free NF-kappaB that was allowed in the mathematical model, which was masked by the dominant IkappaBalpha-mediated export during the normal TNF-alpha induced dynamics (Fig. S2).

We then experimentally validated this somewhat neglected possibility by fluorescence loss in photobleaching (FLIP) (Fig. 4D). When cells are treated with TNF-alpha and CHX together, no IkappaB molecules are present because their re-synthesis is blocked after their TNF-alpha-dependent degradation. When p65 nuclear translocation was apparently complete (30 to 60 minutes after co-treatment), a cytoplasmic spot was bleached repeatedly. This caused a decrease in nuclear GFP-p65 signal, indicating the presence of p65 export into the cytoplasm. The observed time course is in agreement with the predicted loss of nuclear p65 (Fig. 4C), implying that NF-kappaB continuously exports out to the cytoplasm in an IkappaBalpha-independent manner. The retrograde flux of p65 was detectable only when the nuclear p65 level was maximal. When p65 was still accumulating in the nucleus 10 to 25 minutes after TNF-alpha and CHX, the same FLIP protocol did not produce a reduction in nuclear GFP-p65 level, most likely due to the import flux canceling out the loss by the export flux (Fig. S4). We note that a putative nuclear export signal within p65 has been reported [17].

The extent of FLIP in the presence of IkappaBalpha (TNF-alpha alone) was slightly faster than that observed in cells treated with TNF-alpha and CHX, which suggests that p65 export is indeed enhanced by IkappaBalpha (Fig. 4D). As a negative control, FLIP was applied to cells co-treated with TNF-alpha and LMB, which resulted in little or no reduction in nuclear GFP signal (Fig. 4D). These data indicate an inherent tendency of NF-kappaB to shuttle out to the cytoplasm independently of IkappaB. We also confirmed that IkappaBalpha increases p65 export efficiency upon TNF-alpha stimulation.

Taken together these results demonstrate that the nucleocytoplasmic shuttling of NF-kappaB is bi-directional and does not require oscillations or IkappaBalpha. This implies that NF-kappaB shuttles continuously, sampling the full intracellular environment, with or without concurrent oscillations in the level of nuclear p65.

We predicted that the functional consequences of CHX and LMB perturbations would be extremely different on p65 activity, despite the similar effect on its nuclear localization. LMB would render NF-kappaB bound to IkappaBalpha, thus unable to bind chromatin, whereas CHX would maintain its ability to bind chromatin. To address this experimentally and compare perturbed conditions with the unperturbed behavior, we first evaluated features of the distinct p65 cycles in the nucleus using an assay with the temporal precision to resolve the asynchronous cycles in single cells. We note that a functional transcription factor scans the genome by binding and dissociating to chromatin repeatedly, and by diffusing within the nucleus [18]. This activity is indicated by a fast recovery of signal from the GFP fusion protein during fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP), a widely utilized assay. We recently discovered that functional NF-kappaB binds to target chromatin sites, with fast exchange kinetics on the timescale of seconds [19]. The chromatin residence time of p65, and its mobility measured by FRAP, are affected by its DNA binding affinity: a higher affinity mutant p65 has a slower mobility and lower affinity mutants have faster mobility [19], . Of note, the reported numbers of p65 molecules per cell and NF-kappaB binding sites in the genome are within an order of magnitude (60,000 [21] and 14,000 [19], [22], respectively). Such comparable numbers suggest that FRAP measurements from the nucleus of our GFP-p65 knock-in cells reflect some binding activity of endogenous p65 in living cells.

We used a non-invasive optimized line FRAP technique [23] (Fig. 5A, B) in conjunction with real time monitoring, and found that p65 mobility during peak of nuclear translocation did not change from early to late cycles of TNF-alpha induced oscillations (Fig. 5C, top panel). This result implies that p65 in the late translocation cycles is capable of diffusing on and interacting with the genome as effectively as the first p65 molecules activated after TNF-alpha. This is remarkable given the numerous feedback and post-translational mechanisms that act upon p65 to attenuate its activity following stimuli.

In contrast, when oscillations were blocked by either LMB or CHX, intranuclear p65 mobility measured by line FRAP was progressively altered with time. LMB induced faster mobility of GFP-p65, which is consistent with unproductive interaction of p65 with the chromatin (Fig. 5C, bottom left panel). CHX, however, effectively slowed down p65 mobility in the nucleus, indicative of prolonged binding of p65 with target chromatin and inefficient genome scanning (Fig. 5C, bottom right). These opposite outcomes are in line with the predicted differences in terms of free NF-kappaB. It is equally important to note that p65 mobility is still rather fast despite the absence of IkappaB in this condition, indicating that IkappaBalpha is not necessary for 'displacing' NF-kappaB from target promoters [24]. Our data suggest that p65 detaches from target chromatin without IkappaBalpha intervention, and IkappaBalpha might simply capture displaced p65, either in the nucleus or in the cytoplasm. Together with the FLIP data in Fig. 4D, the FRAP results support the idea that NF-kappaB has an inherent tendency to dissociate from the chromatin and shuttle out to the cytoplasm, as a feature of its dynamic behavior.

The dynamical systems analysis and the mobility data from line FRAP suggest that even the late periodic cycles of NF-kappaB oscillations may contribute significantly to the functional response induced by TNF-alpha. To assess the role of oscillations on transcription, we measured by qRT-PCR the gene expression kinetics of representative NF-kappaB targets. 'Early' genes were maximally transcribed within half an hour after TNF-alpha stimulation, while 'intermediate' and 'late' primary target genes were activated later and highly expressed only after 1.5 and 3 hours, respectively (Fig. 6).

LMB co-treatment with TNF-alpha strongly inhibited the induction of all genes examined, leaving only a transient pulse of expression for immediate early genes.

On the contrary, CHX co-treatment dramatically exaggerated the induction profiles of most genes, with its strongest effect on early genes for which the transcriptional output increased by 5approximately50 fold (Fig. 6). The enhanced transcription is again consistent with the model prediction and increased chromatin residence time of p65 in living cells for this condition.
###end p 46

Thus, one signaling cycle or constant action of NF-kappaB from LMB or CHX, respectively, induced opposite functional consequences: premature termination or uncontrolled accumulation of target gene transcripts. Our data also imply that oscillatory activity of NF-kappaB strongly constrains the expression of the immediate early genes. The dramatic difference between TNF-alpha and TNF-alpha/CHX co-treatment suggests that transcription of NF-kappaB dependent genes may not occur continuously after TNF-alpha treatment, but rather in bursts with intermittent 'off' periods, echoing periodic p65 cycles.

Oscillations of NF-kappaB have been reported to be strongly damped with one or two cycles from cell population studies [1], while sustained oscillations were detected in single cells expressing fluorescent fusion proteins for p65 [3]. Due to potential artifacts from the additional copies of p65, the single cell results could not be directly applicable to dynamics of endogenous p65 [9]. Because biochemical analysis of asynchronous oscillations is nearly impossible, real-time monitoring of endogenous p65 in single cells was necessary to solve the limitations of the previous approaches. Here we used an ideal physiological NF-kappaB system-MEF cells with knocked-in GFP-tagged p65-and multiple sensitive optical techniques to visualize the endogenous dynamics. Our work clearly demonstrate the existence of periodic cycles of NF-kappaB nuclear localization, and establish by line FRAP that NF-kappaB is active during successive cycles. This finding revises the previous understanding that NF-kappaB oscillations occur only in cells lacking IkappaBbeta and IkappaBepsilon but not in wild-type cells [25].

We also examined the dynamics of NF-kappaB observable in disparate timescales from seconds to hours, and summarize below their functional implications suggested by our data. On the time scale of seconds, NF-kappaB binding to the chromatin is highly dynamic [19], enabling fast scanning of the genome. This 'search and activate' operation has to occur all within a very short timeframe, since the nuclear presence of NF-kappaB is limited to a brief time window during each oscillatory cycle. The dissociation can occur independently of IkappaBalpha and may be mediated by other mechanisms [26], [27], [28].
###end p 51
###begin p 52
On the time scale of minutes, NF-kappaB shuttles continuously between the nucleus and the cytoplasm, allowing for full sampling of the intracellular signaling status and also potentially refreshing itself from inactivating modifications. NF-kappaB shuttling can proceed without the intervention of IkappaBs, which has not been recognized previously.
###end p 52
###begin p 53
On the scale of hours, oscillations in the nuclear NF-kappaB level are sustained often up to several cycles, and appear to be determined mostly by the relative strengths of distinct negative feedback loops. Mathematical modeling suggests that the NF-kappaB network could have selected for non-oscillatory behaviors through the parameter values for the induction kinetics of IkappaBalpha and the negative feedback upon IKK. A small fraction of cells that respond to TNF-alpha with a single cycle in our live imaging further support the idea that the system can avoid oscillation. The sustained NF-kappaB oscillations seen in most cells despite these alternatives open the possibility that the multiple-cycle action of NF-kappaB has a functional advantage over non-oscillatory behaviors.

Consistent with this hypothesis, p65 mobility by FRAP, reflecting its chromatin residence time, is maintained through the recurrent NF-kappaB cycles, and is sensitive to perturbations of the natural oscillations. Moreover, such perturbations also alter the transcription of targets, from early to late genes. The late cycles, absent in LMB co-treatment, contribute significantly to late gene expression, while continuous presence of active NF-kappaB in the nucleus in CHX co-treatment produces exaggerated transcriptional responses. These results suggest that the oscillatory mode of NF-kappaB action may be a cellular trade-off between efficient pulse expression of immediate early genes and the need for NF-kappaB to monitor the signaling status for several hours before acting on the modified chromatin landscape [29], [30] (Fig. 7). Limiting the transcription of the immediate genes by periodic inactivity is important in various signaling contexts, especially because many of these encode secreted cytokines and chemokines. Their overproduction would be dangerous in vivo with far-reaching consequences. In summary, fast transient interaction with the chromatin, continuous nucleocytoplasmic shuttling, and long-term oscillations are distinct but inter-dependent mechanisms in functional signaling by NF-kappaB (compare models in Fig. 7).

Fine-tuning transcriptional output by NF-kappaB oscillations.

(A) When there are little or no NF-kappaB oscillations, immediately accessible target genes are continuously induced. Gene-specific mechanisms attenuate the transcription of these genes over time, while a different group of genes become responsive. In this model, overall gene expression kinetics does not critically depend on NF-kappaB dynamics. (B) Sustained NF-kappaB oscillations allow only pulses of expression for the immediate early genes, as the transcription factor interacts transiently with the chromatin at discrete times. In later signaling cycles, NF-kappaB returns with characteristic genome-scanning competency and acts on late-accessible genes, without having accumulated early transcripts at a high level. Therefore, NF-kappaB oscillations, which are strongly coupled with upstream signaling kinetics, ensure balanced gene expression programs.
###end p 56
###begin p 57
The functional relevance of oscillations suggests a previously unappreciated signaling role for the distinct negative feedback loops within the NF-kappaB regulatory network. Given that negative feedback mechanisms and their relative strengths are major determinants of the oscillatory dynamics, they do not simply function to terminate signaling. Instead, they may promote oscillatory actions of transcription factors for optimal transcriptional responses.

Because both LMB and CHX affect numerous cellular factors that are not specific to NF-kappaB, we attempted to minimize pleiotropic effects and cytotoxicity by eliminating pre-incubation and by using low drug concentrations (5 nM LMB and 2.5 microg/ml CHX).

Live cell imaging of GFP-p65 knock-in MEF was performed using Zeiss LSM 5 Live with an incubation system where cells were stably maintained at 37degreesC with humidified 5% CO2. Time lapse images were acquired at 5 min intervals with a single frame per stage position using 1% of excitation at 489 nm, 63X Plan-Apochromat oil objective (1.4 NA), 0.5 zoom, and a 495 nm long pass filter. Focus was automatically corrected before each time point by a customized the Zeiss Multitime autofocus macro. TNF-alpha was treated at the second time point by a gentle injection through a tubing. Acquired LSM files were exported to 16 bit TIFF files for further analysis.

In each time lapse field, we excluded from analysis the cells that moved out of view, died, overlapped with other cells, or divided during the time course. Cell boundaries were identified first automatically by intensity-thresholding then by manual correction. Nuclear boundaries were all manually drawn. The same cells were tracked from the previous time point by finding cells with the closest cell centroids. Background subtracted intensities were used to calculate the ratio of mean nuclear intensity to mean total cellular intensity.

Each time course profile was analyzed by Fast Fourier Transform and the corresponding periodogram was generated to reveal any periodic components. A time course was considered to represent an oscillating p65 if the periodogram had one global maximum or if there was a sharp local maximum at a period less than 5 hours whose value was greater than 70% of the global max. The latter case corresponded to time course profiles where there was a global profile as well as an oscillating component. We are also exploring an alternative method borrowed from audio signal processing, to look for finer temporal components. Some examples are shown in Figure S5.

The delay differential equations (DDE) model in [13] was modified by including a term (neg in Fig. S2) to represent the inactivation of IKK by various mechanisms including A20, CYLD, and IKK autophosphorylation. The reference parameter values are listed in Figure S2B[13]. In the multiparameter variation analysis, each rate constant was varied by 2 orders of magnitude around the reference value (from 0.1 to 10 fold) and was randomly combined with others by the Latin Hypercube Sampling method to limit the total computational load at a manageable level. The time delay parameter for IkappaBalpha synthesis was constrained to vary between 30 and 55 minutes to avoid an unrealistic range. 1000 samples of parameter combinations were generated and used for DDE simulations. The 1000 time course profiles for free nuclear p65 were classified into eight types using a K-means cluster analysis. All computations were implemented in MATLAB.

Mathematical modeling and simulations for the core NF-kappaB network dynamics. (A) The 9-variable, 18-parameter delay differential equations model was adapted from [Sung et al. 2004 Mol. Pharm.] with the addition of a term that represents the post-stimulus attenuation of IKK activity ('neg IKK' for the equation for IKK). For simulating TNF-alpha treatment, we used stimulus input k(t) which was fixed for our parameter variations to produce a step-like activation of IKK at t = 0. We note here some simplifications implemented in the model. We combined certain multiple biochemical reactions into single terms. The parameter neg represents the rate of inactivation of IKK by multiple mechanisms. The model also simplifies the induced synthesis of IkappaBalpha which in fact comprises of transcription, RNA processing and transport, translation and protein folding. All of these are lumped into a single synthesis term with a delay. Similarly, the catalyzed degradation of IkappaBalpha initiated by IKK (rate r1) represents a complex series of reactions including phosphorylation at two serines, ubiquitination, and degradation. Such signal induced degradation is distinguished from the basal degradation of free or NF-kappaB bound IkappaBalpha that occur with rate dg1 or dg2. Notation for the molecule concentrations as model variables: NF = NF-kappaB I = IkappaBalpha IKK = the active IKK complex A colon between two variables indicates a complex of the corresponding proteins, and variables with subscript 'n' denote nuclear species. (B) The table describes all the molecular processes that are represented in the model and the reference values for the corresponding parameters. All values are from [Hoffmann et al 2002 Science] except for the following: tau, neg, and s are parameters for simplifying terms that represent multiple biochemical processes. Therefore, their values were estimated arbitrarily so that the TNF-alpha response profile from these reference parameter values is qualitatively similar to that in [Hoffmann et al 2002 Science]. In fact, we did not assume that any of the parameter values were appropriate for our cells, and instead relied on extensive parameter variations to look for all possible behaviors of the dynamical system from different parameter values. (C) The example below illustrates typical plots from model simulations for TNF-alpha induced p65 oscillations. The graphs show the time courses of free, IkappaBalpha-complexed, and total p65 in the nucleus, as predicted by the model. The red curves indicate the three p65 species in the nucleus from a single run of simulation. (D) The time courses of free active IKK for the eight clusters are shown below. Clusters 1 through 8 correspond to those in Figure 3C. (E) The parameters other than s and neg do not correlate with the distinct patterns of p65 dynamics. The plots below show the parameters d1 (NF-kappaB:IkappaBalpha complex dissociation rate) and r1 (IKK phospho-ubiquitin-degradation of IkappaBalpha), for the eight clusters in Figure 3C. Plots for all the other parameter pairs look very similar to this.

Control FLIP experiments for the nucleus-to-cytoplasm flux of free NF-kappaB in Figure 4D. Fluorescence loss in photobleaching (FLIP) was performed with the same protocol as for the experiment in Figure 4D to compare FLIP under different conditions (TNF-alpha only, TNF-alpha + CHX or LMB), as well as FLIP during p65 import. A circular spot in the cytoplasm was repeatedly bleached while the nuclear mean intensity was monitored. The plot in A shows the same data as in Figure 4D for comparison, FLIP time courses acquired 25 minutes after treatments, when p65 translocation is almost complete. Fluorescence profiles are the average of at least 4 cells from three independent experiments acquired at 25 min, 40 min and 55 min after treatment. In TNF-alpha + CHX there is a decrease in nuclear GFP-p65 signal, indicating the presence of p65 export into the cytoplasm. When cells are treated with TNF only, the rate of p65 export to the cytoplasm is slightly faster, possibly indicating a role of IkBalpha in removing p65 from the nucleus. In TNF + LMB treated cells, the retrograde flux is almost undetectable, as expected. The plot in B shows the FLIP time course during (not after) the massive nuclear translocation of p65 within 25 minutes after TNF-alpha or TNF-alpha + CHX co-treatment. Fluorescence profiles are the averages of at least 10 cells from five independent experiments acquired at 10 min after treatment. In TNF-alpha + CHX treated cells, there is a slight gain of nuclear p65, instead of a loss, due to a greater nuclear influx of p65 molecules from the unbleached cytoplasmic region in comparison to p65 influx from the bleached area. In TNF-alpha treated cells, there is a net nuclear loss indicating that p65 export is faster than its import. The error bars indicate S.E.

Application of an alternative signal processing algorithm to representative GFP-p65 time course profiles. We tested an analysis method that is widely used in audio signal processing, against various oscillatory profiles of GFP-p65 time courses in response to TNF-alpha. First, each time course data y (t) ( = nuclear:total ratio of GFP-p65) was adjusted by baseline subtraction and normalization: y_signal (t) = (y(t) - min y(t))/(max y(t) - min y(t)). Zeros were padded to extend toward negative t values. The y_signal (t) was further processed by Hanning window to produce y_hanning (t). Fast Fourier Transform was then applied to y_hanning and its Bode plot in log scales was generated. The plots in the left column show y_signal (t) as solid curves and y_hanning (t) as dashed. The corresponding Bode plots are shown in the right column. Although this analysis may show fine spectral features of the temporal profiles, it seems less obvious how to classify patterns from Bode plots. Nonetheless, at least the dominant periodic components of p65 seem to be revealed by either this method or our original analysis method in Fig. 1D.
