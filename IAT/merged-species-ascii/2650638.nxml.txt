Mammalian Gene Collection (MGC) verified over 9000 human full-ORF genes and FLJ Program reported 21 243 cDNAs of which 14 409 were unique ones and 5416 seemed to be protein-coding. The pity is that epididymis cDNA library was missing in their sequencing target list. Epididymis is a very important male accessory sex organ for sperm maturation and storage. Fully differentiated spermatozoa left from testis acquire their motility and capacity for fertilization via interactions with the epididymal epithelium duct lumen during passage through this convoluted duct. Here, we report that 20 000 clones from a healthy male epididymis cDNA library have been sequenced. The sequencing data provided 8234 known sequences and 650 unknown cDNA fragments. Hundred and six of 650 unknown cDNA clone inserts were randomly selected for fully sequencing. There were 25 unknown unique sequences and 19 released but unreported sequences came out. By northern blot analysis, four sequences randomly selected from the 19 released sequences with no known function showed positive mRNA signals in epididymis and testis. The signals for three of six from those unknown group showed as epididymis abundant in a region-specific manner but not in the testis and other tissues tested. All the sequencing data will be available on the website www.sdscli.com.

In 2002, Mammalian Gene Collection (MGC) sequenced and verified over 9000 human full-ORF genes and 7800 candidate full-ORF genes.1 One year after, full-length Japan Program (FLJ) reported 21 243 cDNAs, of which 14 409 (10 897 clusters) were unique ones and half of them (5416) seemed to be protein-coding.2 Ten months later, International Human Genome Sequencing Consortium announced on Nature that the euchromatic sequence of the human genome has been finished.3 The current genome sequence (Build 35) contains 2.85 billion nucleotides interrupted by only 341 gaps. It covers 99% of the euchromatic genome and is accurate to an error rate of 1 event per 100 000 bases. It seems to encode only 20 000-25 000 protein-coding genes.3 These advances should serve as a firm foundation for biomedical research in the decades ahead. Next step, people will be interested in profiling the temporal and special gene expression patterns in the individual human organs or cells on a genome-wide scale and comparing with some normal physiological processes and diseases status as well. However, we noticed that although MGC constructed >100 cDNA libraries, derived from a wide variety of tissues and cell lines (complete list at http://mgc.nci.nih.gov), and FLJ constructed 107 human cDNA libraries enriched for full-length cDNA clones, representing 61 tissues, 21 primary cell cultures, and 16 cell lines used to select the putative full-ORF clones, one reproductive organ, epididymis, which is beside the testis, connecting it with the vas deferens, has been neglected by both of the above groups. Mammalian spermatogonia undergo mitosis, meiosis, and some morphological changes to become a fully differentiated sperm in testis. But they are not mature, they pass through the epididymis, a convoluted duct, bathe in the duct lumen, and interact with some proteins in these particular microenvironments so that they acquire forward motility and fertility potential and become a so-called matured sperm stored in the end of this duct waiting for ejaculation. It was also reported that a great number of genes exclusively expressed in this organ. Besides, the epididymal epithelial cells in different regions of the duct, namely caput (the head part), corpus (the middle part), and cauda (the tail part), expressed different proteins secreted into the lumen and created an ever-changed microenvironment. For example, sperm gain their forward motility just in the caput region. Recently, the mouse epididymis has been divided into 10 segments anatomically by lobules bounded by connective tissue septa.4 Analysis of differentially regulated genes in the mouse epididymis by DNA array demonstrates that more than 2168 genes, approximately13% of the genes expressed in the epididymis, differ in their level of expression in different segments by at least fourfold. The large number of regulated genes within a grossly dissected single organ is unprecedented. In comparison, only 1186 genes are differentially regulated (fourfold, P = 0.01) between the kidney and the liver, two distinct organs with very different functions. This suggests that sperm maturation, transport, and storage in the epididymis are highly complex events. The more and more people pay attentions to this organ. Because understanding the molecular mechanisms of sperm maturation in epididymis will be of great helps not only in answering how the expression of region-specific programmatically expressed genes was controlled but also in male contraceptive drug design, personalized diagnosis, and treatment of infertility and sperm health evaluation. To this end, human genome U133 plus 2.0 microarray covered over 47 000 transcripts and variants representing 38 500 well-characterized human genes were applied by our lab to obtain a full profile of gene expression in the epididymis of a fertile young male.5 Genes expressed exclusively or predominantly within one region could be searched from this data resources on the website http://www.scbit.org/human_epididymis_transcriptomes) conveniently. However, those unknown epididymis-specific genes were still absent on the DNA chip. All of these urged us to complete this defect. Here, we partially sequenced a cDNA library for an adult human epididymis. We want to provide the following informations: (i) a list of the cDNAs expressed in the adult human epididymis; (ii) among them, which genes have been reported, which genes are just a known sequence but without any characterization data, and which genes are totally novel; (iii) are the novel ones human epididymis-specific and even region-specific in human epididymis? The data are not only useful for the epididymis community but also good for addendum the human transcriptome.

Human epididymis was obtained from male of age 28 with one-child reproductive history and normal spermatogenesis without the other related diseases (the donor died of accident and were voluntary to donate), which was approved by the Ethics Committee of Shanghai Institutes for Biological Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciences. Samples were sliced into 1 mm3 under low temperature, frozen by nitrogen, and stored at -70degreesC. Human epididymis total RNA was extracted by Trizol (Invitrogen). The quality was determined by electrophoresis on a 1.1% formaldehyde degenerated agarose gel.

The cDNA library of human epididymis was constructed by Creator SMART cDNA Library Construction Kit (CLONTECH) according to the manufacturer's suggestions. Finally, the human epididymal cDNA was ligated into the vector pDNR-LIB and 5 microL of ligation product was transformed to 25 microL of electrocompetent cell XL1-Blue. The entire transformation mixture was transferred to the tubes containing 970 microL of LB broth. The method of consecutive dilution was used to titer the bacteria solution.6 After incubating with shaking (225 rpm) for 1 h at 37degreesC, 1 microL of each transformation mixture was added into the appropriate tube containing 1 mL of LB broth and then 1 microL of dilution was added into 1 mL of LB broth. Combine 1 microL of final dilution with 50 microL of LB broth and spread it onto LB/Cm plates. Inverted the plates and incubated at 37degreesC overnight. The number of colonies was counted to determine the titer (cfu/mL). Calculated the titer according to the following formulas: colony x 103 x 103 cfu/mL.

Creator SMART cDNA Library Construction Kit (CLONTECH) was used to construct the library. It is the case that PCR employed in SMART kit can result in the clone frequencies bias. However, in this work, we have introduced the minimal PCR cycles (18 cycles) as recommended by the manufacturers which would reduce the bias significantly. The titer of this cDNA library is 2 x 107 cfu/mL. The 14 clones randomly selected from this library were examined to evaluate the quality of this library. Fig. 1C showed that 13 of 14 clones were positive. The distribution of the insert size was as follows: >1 kb for two clones, >700 bp for three clones, >500 bp for seven clones, and 400 bp for one clone. The quality of our library might be not very high because it contained a lot of relatively short inserts. However, it is true that the size of many epididymis-specific transcripts is quite small, less than 1 kb, such as at least 19 beta-defensins,10 7 lipocalins,11 HE1, HE4, and HE5.12

It indicated that either the transformation efficiency (92.8%) or the insert length was high enough. For further testing the quality of the inserts, 1000 clones were sequenced at the 5'-teminal. The 450 bp sequencing data in average proved that 92.5% clones were positive. Among them, 92% of which could be found in the EST bank (December 2003) and only 8% could not. Seventy-five percentage of the insert sequence was protein coding, corresponding to 693 genes. To this end, we decided to sequence them all.

As we know, the appearing frequency of the clones with same insert in the library was determined by their expression levels and in a direct proportion manner. So the number of the clones was not equal to the number of genes. And the insert of the clones could not be entirely the full-length cDNA. Owing to the financial limitation, we could not sequence all the clones in the library. According to the transcriptomes data from the human epididymis by DNA array, 26 893 qualifiers as 'present signal > 1' and 15 946 qualifiers as 'present signal > 50' were found in the whole epididymis, accounting for approximately49 and 29% of the total on the array respectively were found in the whole epididymis. So, 49 and 29% of the gene number 25 000 which were announced by the International Human Genome Sequencing Consortium would be around 12 250 and 7250 respectively to be expressed in epididymis. The DNA array data also showed that the gene expression level in epididymis was not the same. The variations sometimes were very high. There were 0.4% genes with 'present signal > 5000', 6.8% genes with 'present signal > 500', 58.3% genes with 'present signal > 50'. It indicated that 41.7% of them (with 'present signal > 1') expressed in a very low level might be neglected. Therefore, we chose those genes with 'present signal > 50' holding 29% of the whole gene number 25 000 which will be only approximately7250 genes expressed in human epididymis being sent for sequencing. Besides, both MGC and FLJ programs also sequenced 10 000 clones per each cDNA library only. So, we decided to sequence 20 000 clones. It might be enough to reveal those sequences for 29% of the total genes (approximately7250 genes) expressed in this library. The route map for analyzing these sequencing data was summarized in Fig. 2.

After removal of those recognizable contaminating sequences and the same sequence from different clones, the 5'-terminal one-pass sequences of the 20 000 clones were narrowed down to 7450. These sequences were blasted against NR and EST database published on the March 2003. Six thousand seven hundred and fifty cDNA sequences could be found and the rest 650 ones could not. After further analysis by using tblastx software against NR, EST database, GeneBank, and ProteinBank Swissprot, it was found that 5390 cDNAs had been reported with somewhat various biological functions using the software Genespring 7.0. Table 1 showed the classification of their functions and the numbers of genes belong to. Fig. 3 showed the chromosome localization of the 3394 cDNAs reported. Notably, quite low frequency appeared on chromosome 12 and Y for the epididymis transcripts. Although the rest 1360 cDNA sequences can be found on the database, they were only a predicted sequence resulted from bioinformatics. 650 ESTs could not be found in all the databases and they were submitted to GenBank (EH041735-EH041927, FE192591-FE193047). The frequency of each of 7450 clones appearing in the sequenced 20 000 clones was also evaluated. Most of the clones are low-copy clones with the frequency no >10 among 20 000 clones. The contents of medium-copy (frequency 11-100) and high copy (frequency >100) clones are only 1.7% among the 7400 non-redundant clones.

For further understanding the nature of these so-called novel cDNA fragments, 106 of 650 clones were randomly selected for fully sequencing. The 106 sequences were submitted to GenBank (DV643899 approximately DV643998, DQ822205, DQ823637, DQ823638, EF426753, EF426754, EF426755). After getting rid of the contaminations or some repeated ones and being pieced together as long as possible, 79 independent unknown sequences were identified by Blast searching against GenBank NR database. These sequences were further searched against human genome database. Fifteen of 79 were found with significant redundant sequence in human genome and seemingly non-coding-transcripts; 8 of 79 clones were surprisingly not found in human genome; 19 of them have already been released during the course of this project but their function is still totally unknown; 25 sequences seemed to be totally unknown and unique in human genome (Fig. 2).

For further checking if these novel genes expressed in human epididymis, 6 of 25 novel clones were selected for northern blot analysis. Con16, 32, and 33 did express in human epididymis even in a region-specific manner and not in testis (Fig. 4A and Table 2). Con32 and 33 were abundant in corpus region and con16 was abundant in cauda epididymis. Their tissue specificity was further tested by RT-PCR (Fig. 5). Epididymis-specific gene ESC42 was used as positive control which has the highest expression in caput epididymis.7 Con32 and 33 were exclusively expressed in human epididymis and con16 was expressed in human epididymis except lung. These three sequences have been extended by electronic cloning (EST overlapping and extension) and 5'race and have been deposited in GenBank. Con16 belongs to the defensin family and con32 belongs to the colipase family. They might play the important roles in sperm maturation and innate immunity in male reproductive tract. Northern blot analysis was also applied for testing if 4 of 19 released but unknown sequences were present in human epididymis. Although all of them (Con8, 29, 79, 97) did express in human epididymis, it looked neither epididymis-specific nor region-specific (Fig. 4B and Table 2). Since the released sequences were found in the cDNA library from non-epididymis tissues, it is not surprised to find these four clones were not epididymis-specific and also expressed in testis. The information dealing with these clones are summarized in Table 2.

Next, we used BLAST search to compare the sequences for the reminder 544 of 650 clones again with relevant data sets published on the March of 2006. 342 of 544 EST sequence could be found in the NR and EST database during the course of this project. The sequences for the rest 202 clones were regarded as unknown ESTs and 193 of them were submitted to the EST database (EH041735-EH041927).

Fifteen reported human epididymis-specific genes and eight monkey epididymis-specific genes newly discovered by our lab were checked in this cDNA library for qualifying its representative. It is happy to see that all the above cDNAs could be detected in this library shown in Table 3 and Fig. 6. However, only 69.6% of them could be found in our sequencing data. This means that sequencing 20 000 clones is not enough to cover all the expressing transcripts in this library. In another words, due to the financial limitation, at least one of three genes in this library had not been sequenced. Nevertheless, Table 3 showed that there is 87% of the 15 reported epididymis-specific genes could be found in our sequencing data, but only 37.5% for the eight newly discovered ones. Notably, it seems that those genes appearing in our sequencing data are basically with higher expression level. It makes sense, because as we mentioned above that the probability for the cDNA clone appearing in the library was determined by their expression levels and in a direct proportion manner. From this point of view, the sequencing data presented in this report might include the majority of the human epididymal transcriptome with relatively higher expression level. Further works based on the novel cDNAs resource will be good for revealing the whole transcriptome for an organ-human epididymis.

In summary, the provided data possess the following significances. (i) Providing a list of the reported genes which are also expressed in epididymis. With the aid of human epididymis cDNA array data on our website, people can know the expression level and region localization of the particular genes in epididymis. (ii) Providing a number of unknown ESTs which are expressed in human epididymis. It is the source making the novel epididymis expressed gene discovery much more convenient. (iii) Providing a number of epididymis-specific transcripts which make up for the deficiency of the updated human transcriptome.
