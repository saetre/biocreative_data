Patients with chronic inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) are at an increased risk of colorectal cancer (CRC) and it is estimated that one in six persons diagnosed with IBD will develop CRC. This fact suggests that genetic variations in inflammatory response genes may act as CRC disease risk modifiers.

In order to test this hypothesis we investigated a series of polymorphisms in 6 genes (NOD2, DLG5, OCTN1, OCTN2, IL4, TNFalpha) associated with the inflammatory response on a group of 607 consecutive newly diagnosed colorectal cancer patients and compared the results to controls (350 consecutive newborns and 607 age, sex and geographically matched controls).

Of the six genes only one polymorphism in TNFalpha(-1031T/T) showed any tendency to be associated with disease risk (64.9% for controls and 71.4% for CRC) which we further characterized on a larger cohort of CRC patients and found a more profound relationship between the TNFalpha -1031T/T genotype and disease (64.5% for controls vs 74.7% for CRC cases above 70 yrs). Then, we investigated this result and identified a suggestive tendency, linking the TNFalpha -1031T/T genotype and a previously identified change in the CARD15/NOD2 gene (OR = 1.87; p = 0,02 for CRC cases above 60 yrs).

Biological and epidemiological data indicate a clear association between chronic inflammation and malignancy [1]. Patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), including Crohn disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC), are at increased risk of developing colorectal cancer [2]. Epidemiological and linkage studies strongly suggest the involvement of genetic factors in IBD, especially those associated with inflammation.

Recently, it has been shown that the NOD2/CARD15 (nucleotide oligomerisation domain 2/caspase activating recruitment domain 15) gene is implicated in the susceptibility to Crohn's disease [3,4]. NOD2/CARD15 is expressed intracellularly in monocytes/macrophages and granulocytes, where it activates the nuclear factor NF-kappaB, making it responsive to bacterial lipopolysaccharides which culminate in the activation of apoptosis [5]. Patients harbouring mutant NOD2 alleles are presumably deficient in the activation of NF-kappaB and consequently the appropriate response to bacterial infection [5-7]. Among patients with CD, the frequency of C-insertion mutation in exon 11 of NOD2 is about three times higher compared to control populations [4].

The association between IBD and polymorphisms in other inflammation-related genes involved in the innate immune response like DLG5 [9], IL-4 [10], OCTN [11], TNFalpha [12] have been reported but their relationship to disease risk requires further investigation. Together, the associations between polymorphisms in inflammatory response genes and IBD make them attractive candidate susceptibility genes for colorectal cancer since approximately 1:6 individuals with IBD will develop malignancy [13]. In addition, there is sufficient evidence to suggest that remodeling of the immune system with age may also alter cancer risk [14] and consequently alterations in the activity of TNFalpha may become more pronounced with age.

In the present study, we evaluated whether single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within a number of inflammatory response genes are associated with an increased risk of colorectal cancer. Ten SNPs in the following six genes: NOD2 (2140 C/T, 2722 G/C), DLG5 (113 G/A), OCTN1 (1672 C/T), OCTN2 (-207 G/C), IL4 (-590 C/T) and TNFalpha (-308 G/A, -857 C/T, -863 C/A, -1031 T/C) were screened in a consecutive series of colorectal cancer patients using a two-staged approach.

During the second stage of the investigation a further 257 consecutive, newly diagnosed colorectal cancer (CRC) patients from Szczecin were combined with the first 350 CRC patients to give a final 607 cases and compared to 607 age, year of birth, sex and geographically matched healthy controls from families negative for a cancer family history. The CRC patients - 316 males and 291 females - were collected between the years 1996 and 2006 with the average age of disease diagnosis being 63.2 (range 27-92 yrs). Definite diagnosis of Crohn disease has not been established in any CRC patients.

Cases and controls were genotyped by using the PCR-RFLP method described by others for the following SNPs: TNFalpha -857, -863, -1031 [16], TNFalpha -308 [17], IL-4 -590C/T [18], NOD2 2140C/T, 2722G/C [19], 3020insC [8], DLG5113G/A [9]. Genotyping of OCTN1 1672C/T was performed using the following primers F: TAGTCTGACTGTCCTGATTGGAAGC, R: TGCTTATTCTCCCTAAGGCATTTTGG followed by AluI restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analysis.

For OCTN2 -207G/C polymorphism analysis the primers F: CCGCTCTGCCTGCCAGCGGG, R: CAAGACCGTCCGCGGAGGGTAGG and a HpaII RFLP were used. For each SNP studied a random number were taken and subjected to direct sequencing analysis to reduce the risk that the genotypes were a result of genotyping error. The concordance between the samples taken for DNA sequencing compared to PCR-RFLP analysis was 100 percent. If samples failed to amplify after three attempts the sample and its partner were left out of the analysis such that all analyses were performed on matched pairs.

During the first stage of the study ten polymorphisms in six genes were analysed and no significant differences in the frequencies of nine of the variants was observed in the CRC group compared to the newborn control population. Only one polymorphism (TNFalpha -1031 T/T) showed a tendency towards being over-represented in the CRC group compared to the newborn control population. The frequency of the TNFalpha -1031 T/T genotype was 71.4% in the CRC group against 64.9% in the newborn control population.

To better define the relationship between the TNFalpha -1031T/T SNP and cancer risk a further 257 consecutively collected CRC patients were assayed for the presence of the T/T genotype and the results compared to an adult control population that has been matched for year of birth, age, sex and domicile (Table 1). The results reveal that the -1031T/T genotype in the CRC group overall when compared to the control population was not significantly different in its frequency (71.0% vs 67.7%).

Previously we have shown in the Polish population that the NOD2 3020insC mutation is associated with CRC risk [8], which remained in this new analysis (Table 1). A combined analysis of patients harbouring the NOD2 mutation and the TNFalpha -1031T/T SNP was performed. The combined analysis was performed on 607 CRC patients and 607 matched healthy controls in order to determine if the TNFalpha -1031 T/T SNP acts in association with the NOD2 3020insC change. From this analysis a total of 41 cases were identified in the CRC group compared to 27 in the control group, which revealed an over-representation of the two SNPs in the CRC group compared to the control group (OR 1.50, p = 0.45). The average age of disease onset in persons harbouring both polymorphisms compared to those only harbouring the TNFalpha -1031T/T change was found to 69.8 years of age (range 48-84) compared to non-carriers 65.3 years of age (range 30-92), which was not statistically significant. Conversely, we observed a trend toward a protective effect in that there was an under-representation of the TNFalpha -1031 C/C and NOD2 3020insC negative carriers in the CRC population (OR 0.49, p = 0.45) (see Table 2).

In the present study, we compared the frequency of a series of polymorphisms in different inflammatory response genes associated with IBD (DLG5, IL-4, OCTN, TNFalpha and NOD2) in colorectal cancer cases against controls. The results indicate that the TNFalpha -1031 TT variant frequency had a tendency to be over-represented in the CRC population compared to an unmatched newborn control population and compared to stringently matched controls. In addition, the association observed in the CRC group compared to the matched controls became more apparent when the CRC patients were stratified by age. The increasing association of the TNFalpha -1031 T/T genotype with the age of diagnosis of colorectal cancer suggests that there is a link between age-related remodeling of the immune system [14] which results in a greater predisposition to disease with aging in the presence of this polymorphism.

Other polymorphisms were also investigated within the TNFalpha promoter region of the gene (-857 C/T, -308 G/A, -238 G/A) and they appeared to confer no protective influence on colorectal cancer risk, a finding which is consistent with other observations [20-23]. Nevertheless associations of the TNFalpha promoter -1031 polymorphism together with the -308 and -238 polymorphisms have also been made with respect to invasive breast carcinoma [24] and an increased risk of gastric cancer [25]. Other malignancies have also been investigated but no significant differences in the distribution of the -1031 T/T variant have been found in nasopharyngeal carcinoma [26] or in malignant melanoma [27]. There is no information about the relationship between the TNFalpha -1031 T/T polymorphism and colorectal cancer and further studies are necessary to confirm above results.

We have previously reported an association between the NOD2 3020insC mutation and colorectal cancer risk [8] which has been confirmed in two other reports [28,29] but remains controversial as two other reports failed to identify any association [13,30]. In this current report, instead of using general population controls to determine whether the frequency of the NOD2 3020insC mutation was over-represented in our CRC population we used an age, year of birth, sex and domicile matched control population and identified a similar association between this mutation and disease. An age dependent trend was also observed for CRC patients over 50 years of age.

By undertaking a combined analysis of carriers of the NOD2 3020insC mutation who have the TNFalpha -1031T/T genotype and comparing their frequency in the CRC population to the matched control population a more pronounced interaction emerges. There appears to be an over-representation of NOD2 3020insC and TNFalpha -1031T/T carriers in the CRC group compared to the matched control group suggesting that it is the combined effect of the two polymorphisms that is particularly important and that their influence becomes more profound with age as evidenced by the increasing over-representation of the two polymorphisms in older CRC patients.

Our studies have several obvious limitations: the size of the study population is relatively small and some stratifications were performed that increased the likelihood of false positive outcomes as a result of the multiple comparison testing. Finally, additional larger investigations using other larger patient groups in ours as well as other populations are required to unequivocally determine the role of these SNPs on CRC risk.

Conclusion
###end title 45
###begin p 46
In conclusion, it appears that independently both the TNFalpha-1031T/T and the NOD2 3020insC polymorphisms may act as low risk modifiers of colorectal cancer risk. Together, the evidence presented in this report suggests an additive effect of the two polymorphisms that becomes increasingly important with advancing age with respect to the risk of CRC. Studies on a larger cohort of colorectal cancer cases and matched controls are necessary to clarify the relationship between the TNFalpha -1031T/T and NOD2 3020insC polymorphisms and CRC.
