The nucleotide sequence of the SV40 genome region between the Hind K fragment and the Eco RI cleavage site has been determined by a combination of three different approaches : analysis of RNA products obtained by transcription with Escherichia coli DNA dependent RNA polymerase, partial degradations with snake venom exonuclease and base-specific chemical degradation of 5'-terminal labeled restriction fragments. This nucleotide sequence shows only one open reading frame and allows the deduction of a small segment of the amino acid sequence of VP1, the major structural protein.
