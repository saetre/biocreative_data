The regulatory region of the lysC gene (that encodes the lysine-sensitive aspartokinase of Escherichia coli) has been identified and purified by the use of lysC-lacZ fusions. Its regulatory sequence has been determined. No signals similar to those described in the case of an attenuation mechanism could be found in the long leader sequence existing between the starts of transcription and of translation.
