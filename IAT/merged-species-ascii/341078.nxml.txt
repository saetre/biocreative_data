Sequence analysis of an 8.4 kb fragment containing five chicken histone genes shows that an H4-H2A gene pair is duplicated and inverted around a central H3 gene. A left and right region, each of 2.1 kb are 97% homologous and the boundaries of homology coincide with ten base pair repeats. These boundary regions also contain highly conserved gene promoter elements, suggesting that interaction of transcriptional machinery with histone genes may be connected with recombination in promoter regions, resulting in the inverted duplication structure seen in this cluster.
