Monoclonal antibodies directed against rabbit reticulocyte protein synthesis initiation factor 4A (eIF-4A) were used to isolate mouse cDNA clones expressing eIF-4A protein sequences in E. coli. The identity of cDNA clones encoding eIF-4A sequences was confirmed by hybrid-selected translation and peptide mapping of the translation product. Analysis of the mRNA coding for eIF-4A from mouse liver and HeLa cells by Northern hybridization revealed two discrete mRNA species of approximately 2000 and 1600 nucleotides in length. The existence of two mRNAs in mouse and HeLa cells encoding eIF-4A was confirmed by cDNA sequencing.
