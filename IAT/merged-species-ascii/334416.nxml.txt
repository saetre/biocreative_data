Genetic and biochemical evidence suggests there are at least three DNA polymerases required for replication in eukaryotic cells. However, Drosophila embryonic cells have a very short duration S phase which is regulated differently. To address the question of whether embryos utilize different DNA polymerases, we employed Mono Q anion exchange chromatography to resolve the DNA polymerase activities. Two types of DNA polymerase, DNA polymerase delta and DNA polymerase alpha, were distinguished by: 1. copurification of DNA primase or 3'-5'exonuclease activities; 2. immunoblot analysis with alpha-specific polyclonal antisera; 3. sensitivity to aphidicolin and BuPdGTP; and 4. processivity measurements with and without Proliferating Cell Nuclear Antigen. These observations suggest that Drosophila embryos, similar to nonembryonic cells, have both alpha- and delta-type DNA polymerases.
