In man, elevated levels of plasma lipoprotein (a)(Lp(a)) is a cardiovascular risk factor, and oxidized phospholipids are believed to play a role as modulators of inflammatory processes such as atherosclerosis. Polyamines are potent antioxidants and anti-inflammatory agents. It was therefore of interest to examine polyamines and their metabolism in LPA transgenic mice.

Concentration of the polyamines putrescine, spermidine and spermine as well as the activity of peroxisomal polyamine oxidase and two other peroxisomal enzymes, acyl-CoA oxidase and catalase were measured. The mice were fed either a standard diet or a diet high in fat and cholesterol (HFHC). Some of the mice in each feeding group were in addition given aminoguanidine (AG), a specific inhibitor of diamine oxidase, which catalyses degradation of putrescine, and also inhibits non-enzymatic glycosylation of protein which is implicated in the aetiology of atherosclerosis in diabetic patients. Non-transgenic mice were used as controls.

Intestinal peroxisomal polyamine oxidase activity was significantly higher in LPA transgenic mice than in the non-transgenic mice, while intestinal peroxisomal catalase activity was significantly lower. Hepatic beta-oxidation increased in Lp(a) transgenic mice fed the HFHC diet, but not in those on standard diet.

The present results indicate a connection between peroxisomal enzyme activity and the presence of the human LPA gene in the murine genome. The effect may be a result of changes in oxidative processes in lipid metabolism rather than resulting from a direct effect of the LPA construct on the peroximal gene expression.

Elevated levels of plasma lipoprotein (a) Lp(a) are a significant cardiovascular risk factor in man [1]. We have earlier reported development of arteriosclerosis in aorta of mice transgenic for cDNA representing the human gene for Lp(a), hLPA, on a standard diet [2,3], while the non-transgenic mice only sporadically developed arteriosclerosis. In the LPA cDNA-transgenic animals, apolipoprotein(a), (apo(a)), occurs free in plasma, and we found a significant correlation between the plasma apo(a) concentration and the size of aortic lesions.
###end p 11

The present investigation, based on tissue samples from the animals in the above-mentioned study, was undertaken to uncover if polyamines could influence on the atherosclerotic development. There were no leftovers of blood and the aortic wall for polyamine measurements. The liver and kidney were therefore chosen.

The rationale for examining the polyamines, spermidine and spermine, is that their positive charges strongly interact with phospholipids and inhibit lipid peroxidation [4], and to a certain extent protect liposome from oxidation [5]. In addition, spermine exhibits an anti-inflammatory effect [5] and exerts an antagonistic action on platelet aggregation [6]. Since cell proliferation in the vascular walls is important in the development of atherosclerotic lesions, knowledge of levels and metabolism of polyamines are per se of interest because of their well-known importance for cell growth and differentiation. In addition it was of interest to measure the activity of the peroxisomal polyamine oxidase, an enzyme important in converting polyamines [7]. Examination of the activity of peroxisomal enzymes was of interest also because the peroxisomal proliferators activated receptors (PPARs) are known to be involved in the development of arteriosclerosis (for review, see [8]. We have earlier shown that feeding rats a diet enriched in polyamines resulted in a decrease in hepatic polyamine oxidase and catalase activity, which could be restored by simultaneously supplementing the diet with clofibrate, a peroxisomal proliferator and a hypolipidemic drug [9].
###end p 13
###begin p 14
The fact that the hypolipidemic drug, clofibrate, changed the activity of polyamine oxidase indicates that the fat content of tissues may influence polyamine metabolism. It was therefore of special interest to examine if fat loading had any effect on liver polyamine content, and on polyamine oxidase activity.

In the present study we found that polyamine oxidase activity was higher in transgenic mice than in non-transgenic animals. In order to examine whether this reflects a general increase in peroxisomal enzymes, we measured the activity of two other peroxisomal enzymes, catalase and beta-oxidase. Catalase decomposes H2O2, a product of oxidase activity, and thereby protects the cell against the toxic effect of H2O2, while peroxisomal beta-oxidation plays the important physiological role of oxidation very long fatty acids and the side chain of cholesterol.

Some groups of mice were treated with AG because AG inhibits the formation of non-enzymatic glycosylation of proteins [10], which are implicated in the aetiology of diabetic complications, including arteriosclerosis [10,11], and because AG is a well-known specific inhibitor of diamine oxidase, which catalyses degradation of putrescine, the precursor of the polyamines; spermidine and spermine.

We here report that the introduction of the human LPA gene into FVB mouse resulted in no significant changes in the polyamine concentration in liver and kidneys, but it changed the activity of three peroxisomale enzymes namely: intestinal polyaminoxidase and catalase and hepatic acyl-CoA oxidase (responsible for beta-oxidation). There seemed to be less hepatic steatosis in the transgenic mice compared to the control FVB mice.

Body-weight decreased by 2-5% during the experimental period. Animals treated with aminoguanidine showed the highest weight-loss. The reduction in the body weight may be related to the relatively high age of the mice. Mice on the high fat diet, showed an intermittent increase in body weight of 2-9%, with a peak about 3 weeks after start. However, mean body weight at the end of the treatment period, was not significantly different from those of the groups fed a standard diet (data not shown).

The polyamine oxidase activity in the small intestine was about twice as high as in the liver. Data showing the effects of the treatments on intestinal polyamine oxidase activity are presented in Fig 1.

Introduction of cDNA representing the LPA gene together with the transferrin promotor, into the mouse genome resulted in changes in activity of the peroxisomale enzymes polyamine oxidase and catalase in the small intestine, but not in the liver (Figs. 2, 3, 4). This is in contrast to the fact that the LPA gene is expressed in liver, but not in the intestines [13], indicating that the effect on the intestinal enzymes must be secondary. Since the genes coding for polyamine oxidase (Locus ID no Mm 212503) and for acyl-CoA oxidase (Locus ID no. Mm 11430) are located on different mouse chromosomes, 7 and 11, respectively, it is unlikely that the observed changes in these enzyme activities were caused by the introduction of the LPA gene with a transferrin promotor, in or near the regulator region of the gene for these enzymes.

The increased intestinal polyamine oxidase activity in LPA transgenic mice compared to non-transgenic mice (Fig. 1), indicates an altered peroxisomal polyamine metabolism. When the activity of the H2O2 producing polyamine oxidase enzyme is increased in the transgenic mice, an increase in the catalase activity should be anticipated. However, the opposite was the case.(Fig. 2) Increased polyamine oxidase activity can therefore not be explained by a general increase in activity of peroxisomal enzymes. The increase in H2O2 production from enhanced polyamine oxidase activity is probably marginal, compared with H2O2 production from other sources. The observed changes in hepatic peroxisomal beta-oxidation (Fig. 3) cannot explain the decrease in the catalase activity because peroxisomal beta-oxidation did not change in the control mice and even increased in the LPA-transgenic mice on HFHC diet. The increased peroxisomal beta-oxidation in LPA transgenic mice on the HFHC diet is in agreement with reports showing that diets high in fat, particular those containing hydrogenated fat, cause increased of peroxisomal beta-oxidation [14,15]. In non-transgenic mice the same diet caused no significant increase of peroxisomal beta-oxidation. It follows that mice, transgenic with respect to LPA may be more prone than non-transgenic mice to increase of peroxisomal beta-oxidation probably because of the low fat content (Fig. 2).

The observed increase in polyamine oxidase and beta-oxidase activity together with a decrease in catalase activity indicate that also other oxidative processes are changed as a result of the introduction of the LPA gene. This seems interesting in the view of the possible role of oxidized phospholipids as modulators of inflammatory processes. Thus, modified phospholipids accumulate at sites of inflammation such as atherosclerotic lesions [16]. Furthermore, oxidized phospholipids are shown to induce expression of atherosclerosis-related genes [17]. Additional evidence has been provided by the use of murine natural monoclonal IgM antibody, EO6, which binds to oxidation-specific epitopes on oxidized low-density lipoprotein. A high correlation between plasma Lp(a) and EO6 was then found [18].

The conclusion so far must be that changes in the three peroxisomal enzyme activities in LPA-transgenic mice is more likely to be caused by altered lipid metabolism in these animals, rather than by a direct effect of the LPA construction on the expression of the peroxisomal genes.

The hepatic spermidine and spermine concentration were almost unaffected by aminoguanidine treatment (Fig. 4 and 5). The same was true for the kidneys. Although the polyamine concentration in the standard diet was much higher than in the HFHC diet, the HFHC diet resulted in higher hepatic spermidine concentration. It seems not likely that differences in the intestinal micro flora caused the observed differences in hepatic polyamine content between the two feeding groups.

The HFHC fed group had higher levels of hepatic fat, as judged by the amount of fat filled vacuoles (steatosis) than those on the standard diet. However, we found no significant correlation between hepatic steatosis and hepatic levels of spermidine or spermine. In spite of that, we suggest that hepatic lipid level may be of importance for the hepatic polyamine level. The fact that spermine binds to negatively charged lipids, e.g. phospholipids [19] may in part explain the increased spermine concentration in liver.

Spermidine in plasma can bind to HDL [20], which is known to inhibit the formation of oxidized low-density lipoprotein (LDL) [21]. Polyamines, especially spermine, are also potent antioxidants and anti-inflammatory agents [5]. The polyamine concentrations have further been reported to inhibit platelet aggregation in hypercholesterolemic rabbits [6]. Studies of the role of polyamines in atherogenesis/thrombogenesis are therefore called for.

The spermidine/spermine ratio is known to be high in fast growing tissue. Thus, in rat liver at birth the ratio is 4.5, whereas this ratio at 9 months is 0.8 [22]. One can only speculate if the cell turnover rate for liver cells in mice fed the HFHC diet, that have a hepatic spermidine/spermine ratio on 0.76, is reduced compared to that of mice on a standard diet where the corresponding ratio was 1.32.

For two of the feeding groups there was significantly lower degree of hepatic steatosis in the transgenic mice than in the non-transgenic animals (Fig 7) suggesting differences in lipid metabolism. We have earlier reported a significantly higher rate of aortic lesions in LPA transgenic mice than in non-transgenic animals and a positive correlation between apo(a) level and size of aortic lesions [2,3]. This, together with the fact that inflammatory cells only could be seen in the aortic fat infiltrations, not in that of the liver, indicate that there are different mechanisms involved in the deposition of lipids in aortic lesions and in liver cells.

An increase in polyamine oxidase activity in hLPA transgenic mice, and an increase in beta-oxidation in transgenic mice fed a HFHC diet, together with a decrease in catalase activity may indicate that also other oxidative processes are changed as a result of the introduction of the LPA gene. Such changes would be of great interest because oxidation products are known to be important in the development of arteriosclerosis.

This stock of mice have also been used in a parallel investigation of effects of the LPA gene on the development of aortic lesions [2,3]. Forty-one transgenic mice with cDNA representing the human LPA gene linked to the mouse transferrin promotor were studied. The mice were of a hybrid genetic background of strain C57BL/6 crossed with strain SJL [2,3]. The original transgenic breeder mice were a generous gift from Dr. Richard M. Lawn, Falk Cardiovascular Research Center, Stanford University, CA., USA. Twenty-nine non-transgenic littermates from breeding between transgenic and non-transgenic mice were used as controls. DNA analyses of white blood cells were performed to ascertain the LPA transgenic status of the mice. The mice were of both sexes and between 49 and 67 weeks of age when the study started (see Table 1).

Catalase activity, peroxisomal beta-oxidation and polyamine oxidase activity were measured in 6 randomly selected mice from each of 7 groups of animals, whereas all 5 mice in the transgenic group on HFHC diet and AG were examined. As seen in Fig. 3 the numbers of mice in some other groups were also less than 6, due to accidental loss of some samples.

Tissue specimens were weighed and thereafter homogenized in 4 volumes of 5% trichloroacetic acid. Hexane diamine was added as an internal standard. The homogenates were kept on ice for 1 hr, followed by centrifugation at 2degreesC for 10 min at 5000 gav. The supernatant was stored at -20degreesC until analyzed. The polyamines were dansylated [27,28] and separated by HPLC [29] on a Radial PAK-A column (Waters, Milford, Ma., USA).

Liver tissue for morphometric studies were removed and immediately placed in a buffered formaldehyde solution. The examination was made routinely on sections of liver, in paraffin blocks, stained with Oil red O and counterstained with hematoxylin. Hepatic steatosis was identified by light microscopy as empty vacuoles in the cytoplasm of liver cells (Fig. 7). For definitive identification of lipid, frozen sections from separate specimens were stained with Oil Red O. The same pathologist examined the sections blindly, and all measurements were performed four times. The evaluation of visible fat in the liver cells was assessed using a semi quantitative scale from 0 to 3. Zero indicates that no vacuolated liver cells could be detected. In the slightest degree of steatosis (grade 1) tiny vacuoles are found in small parts of the lobule, whereas in the severe case (grade 3) almost every liver cell is affected and most cells have large vacuoles. "Moderate" (grade 2) denotes fatty changes between that of slight and severe steatosis (Fig. 7).
