Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by neurodegeneration and changes in cellular processes, including neurogenesis. Proteolytic processing of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) plays a central role in AD. Owing to varying APP processing, several beta-amyloid peptides (Abeta) are generated. In contrast to the form with 40 amino acids (Abeta40), the variant with 42 amino acids (Abeta42) is thought to be the pathogenic form triggering the pathological cascade in AD. While total-Abeta effects have been studied extensively, little is known about specific genome-wide effects triggered by Abeta42 or Abeta40 derived from their direct precursor C99.

Here we studied the transcriptomic and proteomic responses to increased or decreased Abeta42 and Abeta40 levels generated in human neuroblastoma cells. Genome-wide expression profiles (Affymetrix) and proteomic approaches were combined to analyze the cellular response to the changed Abeta42- and Abeta40-levels. The cells responded to this challenge with significant changes in their expression pattern. We identified several dysregulated genes and proteins, but only the cellular retinoic acid binding protein 1 (CRABP1) was up-regulated exclusively in cells expressing an increased Abeta42/Abeta40 ratio. This consequently reduced all-trans retinoic acid (RA)-induced differentiation, validated by CRABP1 knock down, which led to recovery of the cellular response to RA treatment and cellular sprouting under physiological RA concentrations. Importantly, this effect was specific to the AD typical increase in the Abeta42/Abeta40 ratio, whereas a decreased ratio did not result in up-regulation of CRABP1.

We conclude that increasing the Abeta42/Abeta40 ratio up-regulates CRABP1, which in turn reduces the differentiation potential of the human neuroblastoma cell line SH-SY5Y, but increases cell proliferation. This work might contribute to the better understanding of AD neurogenesis, currently a controversial topic.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a genetically heterogeneous disorder because mutations in multiple genes are involved along with non-genetic factors [1]. The risk may be determined by the effects of numerous loci, some of which may produce only minor contributions. Amyloid precursor protein (APP), presenilin1, presenilin2 and the apolipoprotein E epsilon4 allele have been associated with AD [2,3]. These genes are assumed to be responsible for approximately 50% of the genetic background of the disease, suggesting that further susceptibility genes exist. Genetic analyses of kindred with AD have pointed to beta-amyloid peptides (Abeta) as the initiating molecules in the development of the disease.

Biochemical work on APP processing revealed that pathogenic mutations alter processing in such a way that more Abeta42 is produced. Genetic and biochemical data together suggested that Abeta42 accumulation was the primary event in the pathogenesis of AD. Abeta42, but not the more abundant Abeta40, may cause neuronal dysfunction and trigger neurodegeneration in vivo [4,5]. APP is cleaved by beta-secretase within its ectodomain, resulting in the generation of the C-terminal fragment C99, which is further cleaved by the gamma-secretase complex. APP processing results in the release of different peptides. To focus on Abeta, we used the standard construct that maintains APP sorting and the relevant processing events [6,7]. The pathological mechanism of how Abeta42 or Abeta40 acts is unclear. To elucidate the underlying mechanisms, we used a combined transcriptomic-proteomic approach and utilized APP point mutations to modulate the Abeta42/Abeta40 ratio. Using a genome and proteome-wide approach provided us with the maximum amount of information possible. We identified cellular retinoic acid binding protein 1 (CRABP1) as the exclusive transcript and protein showing strong differential expression as a consequence of an increased Abeta42/Abeta40 ratio. Accordingly, cells with the increased Abeta42/Abeta40 ratio showed a reduced ability to differentiate. Remarkably, a decreased Abeta42/Abeta40ratio did not affect CRABP1 expression. CRABP1 is involved in retinoic acid (RA)-induced differentiation [8-10] and is expected to play a crucial role in neurogenesis [11].

Neurogenesis is reported to be enhanced in the hippocampi [12] of patients with AD [13] where it may produce cells to replace neurons lost in the disease [14]. The effect of AD on neurogenesis has recently been reproduced in a transgenic mouse model [15] in which APP mutations lead to increased incorporation of BrdU and expression of immature neuronal markers in two neuroproliferative regions: the dentate gyrus and the subventricular zone. As neurogenesis is increased in these mice in the absence of neuronal loss, it might be triggered by more subtle disease manifestations, for example the initial accumulation of the Abeta peptide. In transgenic mice, overexpressing familial AD variants of APP and/or PS1 dramatically diminished survival of newborn neurons 4 weeks after birth [16]. This data hints at an increased neurogenesis in AD, but in contrast to this, also point to early detrimental events shortly after the neurons are born.

A total of 20 mug of RNA was reverse transcribed into cDNA by using oligo(dT) primers (Proligo) and the Superscripttrade mark Double-Stranded cDNA Synthesis Kit (Invitrogen). We in vitro transcribed 3.3 mul of purified cDNA using the BioArraytrade mark High Yieldtrade mark RNA Labeling Kit (Enzo Life Sciences). We fragmented 15 mug of purified cRNA using the GeneChip(R) Eukaryotic Hybridization Control Kit (Affymetrix). We hybridized 15 mug of fragmented cRNA to whole genome HG-U133 A and HG-U133 B oligonucleotide arrays. Chips were washed, stained, scanned and the quality of the created dat-file images was evaluated by using MAS 5.0 and Gene Operating Software GCOS 1.2 (Affymetrix). The quality of each sample was controlled (see Additional file 1). Transcriptomic data was analyzed with MAS 5.0, GCOS 1.2 (both Affymetrix) and Array Assist 3.3 (Stratagene). Chp-files were created by using the PLIER algorithm. P-values were calculated from three independent experiments using either a two class unpaired t-test or one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA). Further data analysis was performed with Excel (Microsoft). For data normalization, filtering details and data output, see Additional files 1, 2 and 3.

Proteins were identified as described recently [23]. Briefly, an automated platform [24] was used to digest the proteins in-gel with trypsin and to prepare the proteolytic peptides for matrix assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF-MS). For each sample a peptide mass fingerprint (PMF) spectrum and fragment ion spectra of up to four selected precursor ions were acquired within the same automated analysis loop using an Ultraflex I mass spectrometer (Bruker Daltonics). Database searches were performed with the Mascot Software 2.0 (Matrix Science). Only proteins represented by at least one peptide sequence above the significance threshold in combination with the presence of at least four peptide masses assigned in the PMF were considered as identified.

We studied the transcriptomic and proteomic response to an altered Abeta42/Abeta40 ratio in human neuroblastoma cells. An increased or decreased Abeta42/Abeta40 ratio revealed differentially expressed transcripts, of which the 60 most up-regulated were used here. For the corresponding proteomic approach the 20 most up-regulated proteins were selected to validate altered protein expression. Only the overlap of transcriptomic and proteomic data was used for further analysis. To analyze altered Abeta generation in a controlled manner, C99-overexpression constructs encoding the C-terminal part of APP (C99) were used [6,7]. This peptide is identical to the APP-derived C99, the ultimate precursor for Abeta generation. C99 is processed by gamma-secretase in the same manner as APP-derived C99, making it an ideal substrate to study gamma-secretase function or its cleavage products Abeta42 and Abeta40 without the influence of beta-secretase. Since, due to a point mutation, the constructs generated peptides only differing in a single amino acid outside the Abeta domain (at position 45 or 50, C99I45F and C99V50F, respectively) compared with the wild-type construct (C99WT), they were ideal for gene expression profiling, enabling us to minimize potential technical variation influencing gene expression.

C99 overexpression in independent cell clones. SH-SY5Y cells were stably transfected with a pCEP-vector containing the amyloid precursor protein C-terminal fragment C99WT, and constructs bearing the point mutations C99I45F and C99V50F. The same cell line was transfected with an empty vector (negative control). Eight clones (clone 1-3 for C99WT, clone 1-3 for C99I45F and clone 1-2 for C99V50F) with approximately similar expression levels and C99V50F clone 3, showing stronger expression, were selected and used for transcriptome and proteome analysis. Apart from analyzing the complete set of three clones, data analysis for the transcriptomic approach was also performed by excluding clone 3 (C99V50F) resulting in no significant difference compared to the triplicates.

Abeta42 and Abeta40 generated from their direct precursor C99 in independent cell clones. Abeta42 and Abeta40 were immunoprecipitated from conditioned media of SH-SY5Y cells, overexpressing C99, using specific antibodies for Abeta42 and Abeta40. Both Abeta species were detected by Western blotting using antibody W02. C99 is intracellularly cleaved, generating different amounts of Abeta42 and Abeta40 in C99I45F and C99V50F. C99I45F generates more Abeta42 than Abeta40, whereas C99V50F generates more Abeta40 than Abeta42.

Direct comparison of C99I45F and C99V50F (baseline experiment, C99V50F) revealed effects mediated by an altered Abeta42/Abeta40 ratio for CRABP1 by a fold change distinctly deviating from 1.0, and an effect mediated by C99 for neurofilament 3 (NEF3), neurofilament light polypeptide 68 kDa (NEFL) and internexin neuronal intermediate filament protein alpha (INA) by a fold change close to 1.0, because C99 was approximately equally expressed in both mutants. Significance was determined performing an unpaired t-test for the direct comparison of both mutants. As to be expected, p-values were high for not differentially expressed genes [62,63].

Expression of CRABP1 was measured by quantitative real-time PCR with cyclophilin A as an endogenous normalization control (cyclophilin A was selected out of 10 normalization controls; see Additional file 1). Measurements reflect the mean of three independent clones, measured in triplicate. The fold change for CRABP1 of mutant C99I45F (Abeta42/Abeta40upward arrow) compared with C99WT was 4.1 (standard deviation of the fold change: +/- 2.3). In contrast to this, the differential expression of CRABP1 was below our defined cut-off (<1.9) for C99V50F (Abeta42/Abeta40downward arrow) compared with C99WT and thus was regarded as not differentially expressed.

CRABP1 is involved in RA metabolism and transport [27] and we found it up-regulated as a consequence of an increased Abeta42/Abeta40 ratio. This raised the question of whether cells with an increased Abeta42/Abeta40 ratio show altered responses to RA treatment. SH-SY5Y cells were stably transfected with the constructs increasing or lowering the Abeta42/Abeta40 ratio (Figure 2). These cells were treated with 0.1-1000 nM RA in the absence or presence of serum. After 6 days, differentiation was evaluated by observing the length and number of outgrowing protrusions by phase contrast microscopy (Figure 5, 1A and 5, 1B).

Increased Abeta42/Abeta40 ratio reduced responsiveness of SH-SY5Y cells to RA and the knock down of up-regulated CRABP1 rescued their differentiation potential. Phase contrast images showing living human neuroblastoma cells (SH-SY5Y), grown on collagen coated glass cover slips and treated with 1 nM retinoic acid (RA). Differentiation was evaluated by the number, shape and length of outgrowing protrusions: (1A) C99I45F (Abeta42/Abeta40upward arrow); (2A) C99V50F (Abeta42/Abeta40downward arrow). Differentiation was evaluated after RA-treatment for 6 days. Both cultures were 50% confluent when RA was added (day zero). C99I45F reached 90-100% confluency after 4-6 days without any signs of differentiation, whereas C99V50F did not exceed more than 60-70% confluency (after 6-10 days) but showed strong differentiation. C99I45F was also evaluated at 60-70% of confluency showing no signs of differentiation (data not shown), thus strong confluency of C99I45F (shown here) does not conceal putative signs of differentiation. (B) C99I45F (Abeta42/Abeta40upward arrow): 30 nM siRNA was administered to the cells for 24 hours in combination with a treatment of 1 nM RA for 2.5 days. After 2.5 days, the effects of more than 50% knockdown of CRABP1 (2B) was compared with a nonsense sequence (negative control, (1B)). (C) C99I45F: same conditions as in (B) except that RA was administered for 4 days. Differentiation was evaluated after 4 days. Knockdown of CRABP1 (2C) was compared with a nonsense sequence (negative control, (1C)). (D) C99I45F: same conditions as in (C), but with another preparation from the same experiment as in (C). (B) and (C) show preparations from different experiments. Experiments were repeated three times with consistent results.

Furthermore, the cell shape and number of cells were evaluated. We selected 1 nM RA for the subsequent functional validation and C99I45F-transfected cells were treated with 1 nM RA for 6 days (Figure 5, 1A). No signs of differentiation were observed, irrespective of the cell confluency and duration of RA treatment (cells were checked daily by light microscopy for up to 10 days). In contrast to this, the cells expressing C99V50F (Figure 5, 2A) showed differentiation at 1 nM RA treatment for 6 days: the cells were approximately 30-60% confluent and did not reach 100% confluency after 10 days. Cells had an average of two to four protrusions. This differentiation was observed from 0.1-10 nM RA, which approximately corresponds to physiological plasma concentrations [28,29]. At concentrations of 100 nM or more RA, differentiation could also be observed for the C99I45F transfected cell line.

If an increased Abeta42/Abeta40 exerts the diminished differentiation behavior via CRABP1, a CRABP1 knockdown in C99I45F cells should rescue this effect. We administered 30 nM siRNA to C99I45F SH-SY5Y cells for 24 hours in combination with a treatment of 0.1-1000 nM (1 nM shown in Figure 5) for 2.5 to 4 days in the absence (data not shown) or presence of serum. Serum withdrawal can mimic differentiation ('pseudo differentiation') and was therefore excluded from further analysis. A more than 50% knockdown of CRABP1 was detected by quantitative real-time PCR (p = 0.0002, n = 3).

Differentiation was evaluated after 2.5 days and 4 days. Knockdown of CRABP1 in combination with 1 nM RA (Fig. 5, 2B-2D) resulted in a strong change of cell shape, whereas transfection with a nonsense sequence, combined with 1 nM RA (negative control, Figure 5, 1B-1D) did not alter the shape of the cells. The strongest differentiation was observed at 1 nM RA. No differentiation could be observed for treatment with siRNA, but without RA or treatment with 1 nM RA, but without siRNA (data not shown). After CRABP1 knockdown and RA-treatment the cells were approximately 30-80% confluent (Figure 5, 2B-2D) and did not reach 100% confluency after 10 days. The extent of interconnections between cells was clearly increased (Figure 5, 2D) compared with the negative control (Figure 5, 1D). See Additional file 1 for an enlarged picture.

Three further genes may have influenced the effects mediated by RA. Chip analysis revealed the following differential expression: Cytochrome P450 family 26 subfamily B polypeptide 1 (CYP26B1), a RA-metabolizing enzyme [27], was found to be up-regulated 1.8-fold (p = 0.01, n = 3) in C99I45F (Abeta42/Abeta40upward arrow), whereas C99V50F (Abeta42/Abeta40downward arrow) showed no differential expression (compared with C99WT). Direct comparison of both mutants (C99I45F/C99V50F) revealed a 2.6-fold up-regulation for CYP26B1 in mutant C99I45F (p = 0.02, n = 3). Retinoic acid receptor (RAR)-related orphan receptor B (RORB) was down-regulated 2.0-fold (p = 0.049, n = 3) in C99V50F (compared with C99WT), whereas it was not differentially expressed in C99I45F. RAR beta (RARB) was not differentially regulated in C99V50F, whereas it was up-regulated 1.4-fold (p = 0.05, n = 3) in C99I45F (compared with C99WT).

Human instead of murine cells were used for transcriptomics and proteomics to facilitate potential comparability with patient-derived data sets. The human neuroblastoma cell line SH-SY5Y has characteristics close to primary neurons, is used to demonstrate differentiation processes [30-33] and is a frequently used neural cell line for microarray studies [34-37].

Associations between AD and RA transport and metabolism are known [38,39]. It was shown that disruption of the retinoid signaling pathway causes a deposition of Abeta in the adult rat brain [40]. RA amounts are determined by many regulatory proteins, such as retinoid binding proteins, retinoid anabolizing and catabolizing enzymes [41]. CYP26B1 has been linked to AD and psychosis [42]. One crucial mechanism whereby the availability of RA is regulated is by binding to CRABP1. CRABP1 is a protein with a molecular weight of 15.4 kDa, localized in the cytoplasm. The gene is strongly conserved in evolution and is assumed to play an important role in RA-mediated differentiation and proliferation processes. It may regulate the access of RA to the nuclear RARs. In the adult brain the two main regions of RA signaling are the olfactory bulb and the hippocampus [43]; both regions are predominantly affected in late onset Alzheimer's disease (LOAD) [41]. CRABP1 and RA are inversely regulated [44]. CRABP1 binds RA and prevents its entering the nucleus and in cells with low CRABP1 expression RA enters the nucleus and binds to RARs [8-10].

An association between CRABP1 and Abeta has not yet been established. In this study we have demonstrated that an increased Abeta42/Abeta40 ratio resulted in CRABP1 up-regulation. Furthermore, we demonstrated that up-regulated CRABP1 reduced the differentiation potential of SH-SY5Y cells. C99I45F-transfection of SH-SY5Y cells resulted in differentiation only if exposed to 100 nM or more of RA, but the same cell line showed already strong differentiation at 1 nM RA when CRABP1 was knocked down by more than 50%. Therefore, we estimate that a 50% knockdown of CRABP1 makes cells more sensitive to RA by approximately a factor of 101-102. The physiological plasma concentration of RA in humans is approximately 10 nM and 8.4 pmol g-1 in the hippocampi of mice [45]. Excess of exogenous RA may over-saturate the binding capacities of CRABP1 allowing the remaining RA to bind to the RARs [46]. This provides an explanation for our finding that treatment with an excess of RA (>100 nM) makes no difference in the differentiation behavior detectable, but differences are evident at low (physiological) levels of RA. CRABP1 transfection of AMC-HN-7 cells results in an increased CYP26-mediated catabolism of RA [27]. This decreases the RA level accessible to the nuclear receptors. Indeed, we found CYP26B1 to be up-regulated in C99I45F, but not in C99V50F. RORB was down-regulated in C99V50F, but not in C99I45F. Furthermore RARB was not differentially regulated in C99V50F, but up-regulated in C99I45F. These observations might reflect a response of the cells to an increased RA level in C99V50F or a decreased RA level in C99I45F, respectively. An inverse regulation of receptors and their ligands is often observed [47].

Association of nAChR and AD has been described previously [48]. Moreover, there has been found to be a linkage of the chromosomal locus 15q24 to mental retardation [49] and linkage of the flanking regions (15q22 and 15q26) to AD [50,51]. This linkage may be explained by the presence of alpha polypeptide 3, 4 and 5 of the nAChR, or of CRABP1, located on the same chromosomal locus.

We observed down-regulation of the neurofilaments NEF3, NEFL and INA as a result of C99 overexpression. Interestingly, these three neurofilaments were up-regulated in response to Abeta42 and Abeta40 overproduction. This may indicate a role of NEF3, NEFL and INA in the axonal 'clogging' phenomenon [52-55] observed in neurons induced by APP or its cleavage products [56].

Treating neural stem cells with Abeta increases the total number of neurons in a dose-dependent manner [57]. In our study we used neuroblastoma cells, which share related proliferation and differentiation properties with neural stem cells. We observed increased proliferation of human neuroblastoma cells in consequence of an increased Abeta42/Abeta40 ratio via CRABP1 and suggest that this influences neurogenesis by promoting proliferation. However, the newly generated neurons may be prevented from adopting a functional phenotype, as a consequence of CRABP1 up-regulation restricting the quantity of RA. This view is supported by a study showing that RA induces neurite outgrowth in SH-SY5Y cells [58]. Theoretically, it seems possible that CRABP1 knock-down would release the block of terminal differentiation of neurons in AD and thus improve the differentiation of neural stem cells into a functional phenotype. RA has often been used to terminally differentiate neuroblastoma cells [59,60] as well as primary neuroblasts [61]. We observed outgrowing protrusions typical for RA-induced differentiation. Moreover, we observed that growth stopped or slowed down in a RA concentration depending manner, which is characteristic of an effective differentiation process.

Our study focused on an increased Abeta42/Abeta40 ratio, which is typical for AD. It does not allow us distinguish between pure Abeta42 and pure Abeta40 effects, because intracellular processing by gamma-secretase typically generates less Abeta40 when more Abeta42 is generated and vice versa. However, we emphasize that our approach better resembles in vivo conditions than approaches in which Abeta42 or Abeta40 is added from outside the cells. In our approach C99 is intracellularly cleaved resulting in different Abeta42/Abeta40 levels, which are released into the extracellular space. This is closer to in vivo conditions than treating cells artificially with Abeta42 or Abeta40.

The generation of different Abeta42/Abeta40 ratios is inherently accompanied by the generation of other C99 cleavage products like the p3 peptides, the APP intracellular domains (AICDs) and further cleavage products. The C99 point mutations are expected to equally shift the p340/p342 and Abeta42/Abeta40 ratios, but little is known about how these mutations affect the AICD production. Neurons produce very little p3 from C99, and the AICD sequence starts at the epsilon- and not at the gamma-site of APP, therefore it would be expected that the main effect of the mutations analyzed is due to altered Abeta generation. This, however, does not exclude the possibility that several C99 cleavage products work in concert with each other.

In summary, we found that an increased Abeta42/Abeta40 ratio up-regulated CRABP1, reducing the availability of free RA. This resulted in an increased tendency towards proliferation accompanied by a reduced potential to differentiate. This effect could be rescued by knocking down CRABP1. We speculate that Abeta42 induces the initial steps in neurogenesis by boosting neuronal precursor cell proliferation while preventing the terminal differentiation into mature neurons. This scenario may provide an explanation for why in AD there is an increase in neurogenesis and at the same time an increased risk for neurodegeneration.

We conclude that the differentiation potential of the human neuroblastoma cell line SH-SY5Y is reduced via CRABP1 up-regulation as a consequence of an increased Abeta42/Abeta40 ratio.
