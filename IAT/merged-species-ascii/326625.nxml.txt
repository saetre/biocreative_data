The nucleotide sequence of the gpt coding for the enzyme xanthine guanine phosphoribosyl transferase has been determined. The gene codes for a protein of molecular weight 16,950. The construction of deletions in the gpt gene which can be used for the genetic analysis of mutations in the gpt gene, is described.
