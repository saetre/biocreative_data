The mechanisms of transmigration of inflammatory cells through the sinusoids are still poorly understood. This study aims to identify in vitro conditions (cytokine treatment) which may allow a better understanding of the changes in PECAM (platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule)-1-gene-expression observed in vivo.

In this study we show by immunohistochemistry, that there is an accumulation of ICAM-1 (intercellular cell adhesion molecule-1) and ED1 positive cells in necrotic areas of livers of CCl4-treated rats, whereas there are few PECAM-1 positive cells observable. After the administration of CCl4, we could detect an early rise of levels of IFN-gamma followed by an enhanced TGF-beta protein level. As shown by Northern blot analysis and surface protein expression analysed by flow cytometry, IFN-gamma-treatment decreased PECAM-1-gene-expression in isolated SECs (sinusoidal endothelial cells) and mononuclear phagocytes (MNPs) in parallel with an increase in ICAM-1-gene-expression in a dose and time dependent manner. In contrast, TGF-beta-treatment increased PECAM-1-expression. Additional administration of IFN-gamma to CCl4-treated rats and observations in IFN-gamma-/- mice confirmed the effect of IFN-gamma on PECAM-1 and ICAM-1-expression observed in vitro and increased the number of ED1-expressing cells 12 h after administration of the toxin.

The early decrease of PECAM-1-expression and the parallel increase of ICAM-1-expression following CCl4-treatment is induced by elevated levels of IFN-gamma in livers and may facilitate adhesion and transmigration of inflammatory cells. The up-regulation of PECAM-1-expression in SECs and MNPs after TGF-beta-treatment suggests the involvement of PECAM-1 during the recovery after liver damage.

Inflammatory cells leave the circulation at sites of local inflammation through a series of distinct sequential steps that are classified as rolling, activation, tight adhesion, transmigration and passage across the basement membrane [1-6]. Due to the specialized sinusoids, inflammatory processes in the liver are thought to differ from those in other organs. It has been suggested that SECs of the normal liver - in contrast to capillary endothelial cells - only express a restricted set of adhesion molecules [7-9].

PECAM-1 is known to be expressed on the surface of endothelial cells, circulating platelets, monocytes, granulocytes and some subsets of T-lymphocytes. PECAM-1 has been proposed as one of the main players in transendothelial migration of neutrophils, monocytes, and natural killer cells in both in vivo and in vitro models, since by the use of antibodies directed against PECAM-1, transmigration and inflammation could be significantly reduced [10-12]. However, the pathomechanisms involving PECAM-1 are still a matter of debate, since in a PECAM-1-knock-out-mouse model, transmigration of inflammatory cells and inflammatory damage were almost unchanged [13].

In our previous studies, we have demonstrated that PECAM-1 is expressed in SECs and MNPs of the rat liver. Furthermore, we have shown that the PECAM-1 expression in SECs and MNPs is decreased after CCl4-treatment in vivo before inflammatory phagocytes accumulate in the pericentral area of rat livers and following IFN-alpha-treatment of cultured SECs and MNPs in vitro. In contrast, ICAM-1-gene expression is upregulated early after CCl4 administration, reaching a maximum after 24 h. Thereafter, ICAM-1 is decreasingly expressed in SECs, reaching the control level of the value at 0 h after 48-72 h. In MNPs ICAM-1 is maximally expressed 6 h after CCl4 administration and thereafter expression declines to control levels 72 h after CCl4 administration. [14,15].

Since we have seen that there is a down-regulation of PECAM-1 in the rat liver after the administration of CCl4, in this study we aimed to identify further cytokines that are responsible for the down-regulation of PECAM-1 on SECs and on transmigrating mononuclear phagocytes (MNPs), but also to identify cytokines that allow the reversal of this effect on both cell types.

A pivotal role in pathomechanisms of liver injury has been assigned to IFN-gamma next to IFN-alpha [16] and it has been demonstrated that IFN-gamma can induce IFN-alpha expression in MNPs [17]. TGF-beta is a known pleiotropic cytokine with profibrogenic and anti-inflammatory capacities [18]. In this study we measured the concentration of IFN-gamma and TGF-beta in the rat liver at different time points after CCl4-administration paying particular attention to the early time points. Furthermore we tested the modulation of PECAM-1 and ICAM-1-expression in SECs and MNPs following IFN-gamma-treatment in vitro and in vivo. We also studied the effect of TGF-beta on PECAM-1 expression in isolated SECs and MNPs. Whereas IFN-gamma reduces PECAM-1 expression in parallel with the increase of ICAM-1 expression, TGF-beta up-regulates both molecules and is also able to counteract the down-regulating effect of IFN-gamma on PECAM-1 expression in vitro.

###begin p 14
These data strongly suggest an early down-regulation of PECAM-1 in parallel to an ICAM-1 up-regulation as a possible important mechanism for the adhesion and transmigration of inflammatory cells. However, further in vitro and in vivo studies are required to confirm this hypothesis. The TGF-beta induced PECAM-1 up-regulation may be of importance during the recovery phase.

Immunostaining of sections from a normal rat liver using a monoclonal antibody against rat PECAM-1 revealed positivity along the sinusoids in a similar pattern to ICAM-1 (Figure 1), suggesting PECAM-1 positivity of SECs. Staining of sequential sections by antibodies against PECAM-1 and against markers of MNPs (ED1) suggests that the positivity along the sinusoids of the normal rat liver is also partly due to MNPs (Figure 1).

To analyze PECAM-1 immunoreactivity under conditions of inflammation, we used a model of CCl4-induced liver damage, which is characterized by the accumulation of inflammatory cells (mostly MNPs) starting 12 h after the administration of CCl4 and peaking after 48 h, when pericentral necrotic areas can be seen. The possibility that some PECAM-1 positive cells are myofibroblasts (MFB), activated HSCs (hepatic stellate cells), or liver myofibroblasts deriving from cells different from quiescent HSCs can be excluded since isolation of these cell types at different time points after CCl4 administration and primary cultures of HSC or liver myofibroblasts from normal rat livers never showed any PECAM-1-gene expression (data not shown).

During recent years, an important role for IFN-gamma and TGF-beta in acute and chronic liver damage has been suggested (for review see [19-21]). Since we aimed to identify cytokines responsible for the modulation of PECAM-1 and ICAM-1 in vivo, we measured the concentrations of IFN-gamma and TGF-beta protein in liver homogenates after a single CCl4-administration using EIA or Elisa. Compared to the livers of untreated controls (time point 0 h), there was an early steep increment in IFN-gamma expression with a maximum 9 h after CCl4 administration, reaching a level of 46 pg per mg of liver wet weight. At 24 h after CCl4 administration the IFN-gamma concentration peaked at the level of the control livers. At 96 h after CCl4 administration the IFN-gamma expression returned to the level seen in the livers of untreated rats. (Figure 2). TGF-beta expression only slightly increased during the first 12 h after CCl4-administration. However it increased significantly thereafter with a maximum after 72 h, reaching a level of 67 pg per mg of liver wet weight and returned to the level seen in the livers of untreated rats after 96 h (Figure 2).

Since measurement of cytokine levels in over the whole liver gave no information on possible local variations in concentration we performed Western Blot analysis of p-STAT1 and p-SMAD2/3 in SECs isolated at different time points after CCl4 administration. p-STAT1 was found to be increased at 12 h and 24 h after CCl4-administration, indicating that a receptor-mediated IFN signal transduction lasts longer than suspected from the cytokin levels of the total liver. In order to investigate at which time points after CCl4-administration TGF-beta induces intracellular signaling in SECs we performed Western Blot analysis of p-SMAD2/3. Whereas TGF-beta expression is increased between 24 h and 72 h after CCl4-administration, p-SMAD2/3 is decreased in SECs isolated 24 h-48 h after CCl4-administration. Thereafter p-SMAD2/3 is found to be increased.

We analysed the modulation of the PECAM-1 specific transcript level in cultured SECs and MNPs following treatment with IFN-gamma (Figure 3). SECs at day one after isolation were cultured in the absence or presence of IFN-gamma under serum reduced conditions (0.3% FCS). Testing different concentrations of IFN-gamma (100, 1000, 10000 U/ml) indicated that the strongest effects of IFN-gamma on the PECAM-1 transcript level were found at a concentration of 10000 U/ml. As shown in Figure 3A, IFN-gamma causes a decrease in the PECAM-1 specific transcript level. In contrast the ICAM-1 mRNA level in SECs was increased by IFN-gamma-treatment. Furthermore, different stimulation periods (4 h, 8 h, 12 h, and 24 h of incubation with IFN-gamma) were compared indicating maximal effects on PECAM specific transcripts after 8 to 12 h of stimulation. It is noteworthy, that an increase of ICAM-1 and a parallel decrease of PECAM-1 could already be observed after 4 h of treatment (Figure 3B) suggesting that the regulation of the two genes may take place at the same time.

Since we were interested in the modulation of PECAM-1 by IFN-gamma not only on SECs but also on the transmigrating MNPs, we also tested MNPs. In MNPs from normal rat livers at day 1 after isolation cultured in the absence or presence of IFN-gamma (100, 1000, 10000 U/ml) a maximal decrease of PECAM-1 specific transcripts was revealed using 10000 U/ml of IFN-gamma for 12 h. At the same time the ICAM-1 mRNA level was increased in MNPs following IFN-gamma-treatment (Figure 3A).

Since we had noted the TGF-beta levels increasing during the recovery phase of CCl4 induced liver injury, we wanted to analyze whether TGF-beta could have reverse effects on PECAM-1-expression compared to IFN-gamma. When SECs or MNPs were cultured in the presence of TGF-beta for different time periods (4 h, 8 h, 12 h, and 24 h) a maximal increase of PECAM-1 specific transcript level was reached after 12 h to 24 h of stimulation. In addition, cells were treated with TGF-beta in different concentrations (1, 3 and 10 ng/ml) for 12 hours under serum reduced conditions (0.3% FCS). While no effect of TGF-beta on the PECAM-1 mRNA-level was detectable at a concentration of 1 ng/ml, treatment with TGF-beta at a concentration of 3 or 10 ng/ml resulted in an increased PECAM-1 specific transcript level in SECs and in MNPs (Figure 4). The strongest effects were revealed using 10 ng/ml of TGF-beta. An increase of ICAM-1 specific transcript levels was observed in SECs following the treatment with TGF-beta. There was no significant increase in ICAM-1 specific transcript level in MNPs.

In order to investigate whether TGF-beta is capable of reversing the effect of IFN-gamma on PECAM-1 and ICAM-1 expression on SECs or MNPs or whether both cytokines simply have inverse but independent effects we additionally cultured SECs or MNPs with IFN-gamma and TGF-beta. Northern Blot analysis revealed that coadministration of IFN-gamma and TGF-beta inhibits the PECAM-1-downregulating effect of IFN-gamma on both cell types. On the other hand coadministration of both cytokines had no additional effect on upregulation of ICAM-1 (Figure 5).

For a functional proof that IFN-gamma leads to an early decrease of PECAM-1 and to an early increase of ICAM-1 specific transcripts in vivo we used an IFN-gamma-/- mice knockout model (B6.129S7-Ifngtm1Ts) [22]. In control mice (female C57BL mice), similar CCl4-administration levels to those previously used in rats leads to an early decrease of PECAM-1 specific transcripts and to an increase of ICAM-1 specific transcripts. Whereas an increase of ICAM-1 specific transcripts can also be observed in IFN-gamma-/- mice livers after CCl4-administration, no significant decrease of PECAM-1 specific transcripts was evident (Figure 7A). A histological comparison after inducing acute liver damage by CCl4 showed that the degree of damage in the IFNgamma-/- mice was less than in the control mice. Furthermore the damaged pericentral areas were smaller, less fatty and the occurrence of necrotic areas, which were also smaller in the liver sections from IFNgamma-/- mice, was observed later (48 h vs. 24 h after CCl4 administration). Even 72 h after CCl4 administration the hepatocytes are more vital (Fig. 7B).

To further analyse whether the effects of IFN-gamma observed in vitro in the previous experiments can be reproduced in vivo, rats were treated either with CCl4 or with IFN-gamma and CCl4 in parallel. Measurement of the IFN-gamma concentration in liver homogenates by means of ELISA revealed an increase of 5-10% in the IFN-gamma concentration in liver tissue following the intraperitoneal treatment with 50000 U IFN-gamma. Since, from the in vitro and in vivo experiments we expected the effects of IFN-gamma within the first 10 h after treatment, livers were analyzed (3 h, 6 h, 12 h after treatment) for changes in PECAM-1 and ICAM-1-gene-expression by Northern blot analysis (Figure 8).

Since differences in adhesion molecule expression following the additional treatment with IFN-gamma could be observed up to 6 h after treatment, sections of rat livers were analysed by indirect immunostaining with a monoclonal antibody against the ED1 antigen at 3 h, 6 h, and 12 h after the treatment to analyze whether the amount of recruited inflammatory cells was influenced. The staining of control livers revealed the previously observed pattern of non-parenchymal cells situated around the vessels. At 12 h after CCl4-treatment the number of ED1-positive cells around the vessels and along the sinusoids increased. Interestingly, when rats were treated with the combination of IFN-gamma and CCl4 the number of ED1 positive cells at 12 h was significantly higher than in the livers of animals treated with CCl4 alone (Figure 9).

Since we have seen that there is a down-regulation of PECAM-1 in rat livers after the administration of CCl4, in this study we aimed to identify cytokines that were responsible for the down-regulation of PECAM-1 on SECs and on transmigrating MNPs, but we also wanted to identify cytokines that allow the reversal of this effect on both cell types. In this study, we show that in CCl4-treated rat livers there is an early rise of levels of IFN-gamma and - during the recovery phase - an increase of TGF-beta-protein level. Similar observations for TGF-beta levels after induced liver damage have also been reported by others [23,24]. However especially measurements of the early time points are missing in the literature. This might be the reason for reports of a decrease of IFN-gamma after inducing liver damage [25]. In vitro studies indicated that IFN-gamma-treatment induced a decrease of PECAM-1-gene-expression in parallel with an increase in ICAM-1-gene-expression. Furthermore, TGF-beta-treatment resulted in an increase of PECAM-1-expression in SECs and MNPs. TGF-beta - also inhibited the effect of IFN-gamma treatment. However, the temporal course of the cytokine expression in vivo after administration of the damaging noxae does not perfectly match the temporal course of changes in the expression of PECAM-1 or ICAM-1. This has two major causes. Firstly, in vivo, many intercellular contacts and additional cytokines have an impact on PECAM-1 and ICAM-1 expression on SECs and MNPs e.g. IFN-alpha [15] which shows a similar expression profile compared to IFN-gamma. Secondly, local differences in the concentration of the cytokines can lead to increased levels of the cytokines around SECs or MNPs when levels in the total liver are already decreased. The observation that IFN-gamma or TGF-beta signalling as measured by p-STAT1 or p-SMAD2/3 is delayed and can be observed when the levels of IFN-gamma or TGF-beta are already decreasing supports this thesis.

The in vitro effect of IFN-gamma could be confirmed in vivo, since the administration of IFN-gamma (0,4 mug per mg liver wet weight, which is comparable to the concentration used for the in vitro treatment (0.01 to 0.1 mug/ml of IFN-gamma)), together with CCl4 further decreased the PECAM-1 transcript level and also further increased the number of ED1-positive cells in the liver at 12 h after the administration of CCl4 compared to the single CCl4 administration to the animals. In contrast, in IFN-gamma-/- mice the lack of IFN-gamma may be responsible for the missing early decrease of PECAM-1 and the reduced increase of ICAM-1.

To study the involvement of cell adhesion molecules during inflammation and tissue damage in vivo several approaches have been used. It has been difficult to block inflammation using reagents directed against single molecules. Several studies, however, revealed that the transmigration of monocytes and of neutrophils could be inhibited using antibodies against PECAM-1 in vitro [12], and in vivo, as the administration of antibodies against PECAM-1 or the administration of the soluble domain 1 of PECAM-1 blocked the accumulation of leukocytes in different models of inflammation [10,11,26,27]. In PECAM-1-knock-out-mice, however, only a slowing of inflammatory cells transmigrating through the basement membrane was observed. This slowing had no effect on the total number of transmigrated cells [13].

In vivo data showing a reduced PECAM-1 expression in inflammatory cells have been interpreted as if PECAM-1 down-regulation were a consequence of the transmigration [28]. Our results demonstrate that in vitro and in vivo treatment with IFN-gamma down-regulates the expression of PECAM-1 in liver cells at an early time point. The in vitro studies reveal a decreased PECAM-1-expression on SECs and on MNPs. These data support the hypothesis that PECAM-1 has to be down-regulated to facilitate transmigration. A confirmation of this hypothesis could be seen in a model of abdominal aortic transplantation. The transmigration of MNPs was unexpectedly enhanced when aortic allografts from PECAM-1 knock-out-mice were transplanted compared to transplanted allografts from wild type mice [29]. The authors suggested that this phenomenon might be due to the fact that PECAM-1 is concentrated at interendothelial junctions and is thereby important for the structural stability of the endothelial barrier. In PECAM-1 deficient grafts this endothelial stability could be reduced during the inflammatory episode after transplantation making it easier for macrophages to transmigrate through the endothelium.

Another relevant finding of the in vivo experiments is the increase of TGF-beta concentration in the liver during the recovery phase after CCl4-administration, when IFN-gamma - and IFN-alpha concentration have already been decreased. TGF-beta is a pleiotropic cytokine with profibrogenic and anti-inflammatory capacities [18]. The data presented in this study show that in cultured SECs and MNPs, TGF-beta increases PECAM-1-expression. Furthermore, TGF-beta inhibited the effect of IFN-gamma on the PECAM-1 transcript level. Although an up-regulation of PECAM-1-gene-expression by TGF-beta-treatment has been observed using a human macrophage cell line (U937 cells) [30], this is the first report showing similar effects on endothelial cells and on tissue macrophages. These data indicate a different modulation of PECAM-1 by IFN-gamma and TGF-beta in SECs and MNPs. Under normal conditions SECs are an efficient barrier against corpusculate matter. Early production of IFN-gamma after administration of toxic agents could not only induce an increase of ICAM-1 expression, but also a decreased PECAM-1 expression, which is essential for the tight adhesion and for the transmigration of inflammatory cells into the parenchyma. During liver repair cytokines such as TGF-beta may be effective in reestablishing the endothelial barrier.

Whereas IFN-gamma has previously been shown to exert antifibrotic effects in man and mice by abrogating TGF-beta signalling [31,32], inducing an acute liver damage in IFN-gamma knockout mice revealed that the degree of damage was reduced and delayed when compared to control mice. This suggests that, least in the early time points after administration of a damaging noxae, IFN-gamma is involved in an increase of liver damage without antagonizing TGF-beta. From these data, blockage of IFN-gamma signalling in the early time points after liver damage, thereby inhibiting downregulation of PECAM, could be a valuable tool in the treatment of patients during the early phases of liver damage.

Acute liver damage was induced in 8 weeks old male Wistar rats (body weight about 200 g) by oral administration of a carbon-tetrachloride/maize oil solution (50% v/v) as described [36-38]. Control animals were treated with maize-oil only. Six animals in each group were sacrificed 3 h, 6 h, 9 h, 12 h, 24 h, 48 h, 72 h, and 96 h after a single high dose CCl4 administration. Furthermore, 16 animals were treated with IFN-gamma (50000 IU/100 g body weight which is about 0.4 mug per mg of rat liver, assuming that about 80% of the intraperitoneally injected IFN-gamma reaches the liver) in addition to CCl4-treatment. Animals were sacrificed 3 h, 6 h, 12 h, and 24 h after the treatment, since we expected IFN-gamma induced modulation of gene expression to take place at early time points after the administration. For inducing liver damage in mice a carbon-tetrachloride/maize oil solution (50% v/v) was administrated intraperitoneally with a concentration of 1 ml CCl4/kg.

MNPs from normal rat livers were isolated according to the method of De Leeuw et al. [40] as described previously [41]. SECs from normal rat livers were obtained according to Knook et al. [42] with modifications as described [14,15,36]. MNPs were cultured in M-199 supplemented with 10% FCS. SECs were cultured on collagen-coated tissue culture plates in endothelial cell medium (Promo cell, Heidelberg, FRG) supplemented with epidermal growth factor (10-11 mg/ml), basic fibroblast growth factor (10-9 mg/ml), 0.15% insulin and 2% FCS. The medium was replaced every day. Purity of SECs was more than 91% as tested by incorporation of dioctadecyl tetramethyl indocarbocyanine perchlorate acetylated low density lipoprotein and electron microscopy of SECs as described in [14,15,43]. Freshly isolated MNPs from normal livers were more than 99% viable and more than 98% pure (as tested by ED1/ED2 staining). On day 1 of culture, SECs and MNPs were washed three times with Gey's balanced salt solution and were incubated in serum reduced (0.3% FCS) culture medium with increasing concentrations of IFN-alpha (10, 100, 1000, U/ml), IFN-gamma (10, 100, 1000, 10000 U/ml which is 0.01 to 0.1 mug/ml), or TGF-beta (1, 3, and 10 ng/ml).
