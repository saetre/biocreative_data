The organization of the X-linked gene for human hypoxanthine phosphoribosyltransferase (HPRT, EC 2.4.2.8.) has been determined by a combination of restriction endonuclease mapping, heteroduplex analysis and DNA sequence analysis of overlapping genomic clones. The entire gene is 42 kilobases in length and split into 9 exons. The sizes of the 7 internal exons and the exon-intron boundaries are identical to those of mouse HPRT gene. The 5' end of the gene lacks the prototypical 5' transcriptional regulatory sequence elements but contains extremely GC-rich sequences and five GC hexanucleotide motifs (5'-GGCGGG-3'). These structural features are very similar to those found in the mouse HPRT gene and to some of the regulatory signals common to a class of constitutively expressed "housekeeping" genes. Several transcriptional start sites have been identified by nuclease protection studies. Extensive sequence homology between the mouse and human genes is found in the 3' non-coding portion of the gene.
