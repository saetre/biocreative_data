RNA transcribed from the human epsilon globin gene was studied in K562 cells and human embryos of 5-10 weeks gestation. Using both primer extension and S1 analysis RNA molecules were found which extend 53 +/- 1 bp, 55 +/- 1 bp and 270 +/- 1 bp upstream from the first coding base and are colinear with the gene. The first pair of molecules represent transcripts initiating at the canonical cap site but the other species represents a transcript over 200 nucleotides longer which initiates upstream of the CAAT and ATAA boxes.
