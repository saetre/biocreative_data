The kinetics of open complex formation were measured by migration retardation assay and DNase I footprinting at the activator-dependent promoters ara P1, lac P1 and gal P1. In each case, the rate of open complex formation was significantly faster if the activator, AraC for ara and CAP for lac and gal, had been added before RNA polymerase. The results indicate that complexes of transcriptional activators, RNA polymerase and promoter can exist in two states, one which can form open complexes rapidly and one which cannot.
