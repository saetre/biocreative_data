A cosmid containing eight exons of the gene coding for the microtubule-associated tau protein was subjected to the exon trapping assay. All the constitutive exons contained in the cosmid (4, 5, 7 and 9) were efficiently captured regardless of size. Of the four alternatively spliced exons, three (3, 4A and 8) were not isolated by the assay, but the behavior of exon 6 depended on the identity of its flanking exons.
