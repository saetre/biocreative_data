A clone corresponding to a thyroid hormone receptor was isolated from a Xenopus laevis cDNA library prepared from folliculated oocytes. The cDNA encodes a protein of 418 amino acid residues with a domain structure, including a putative DNA binding region with two zinc fingers, similar to other members of the v-erbA-related superfamily of receptors. The encoded protein resembles the TR alpha 1-type receptor of the rat. When expressed in COS cells the protein product binds triiodothyronine with a Kd of 0.12 nM. The receptor mediates thyroid-hormone-inducible expression of a reporter gene which includes a thyroid hormone response element in its upstream region.
