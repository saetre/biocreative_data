In this study, we have investigated the role of C-terminal binding proteins (CtBPs) and histone deacetylases (HDACs) in the repressive activity of the nuclear receptor cofactor Receptor-Interacting Protein 140 (RIP140). We have defined the interaction of both CtBP1 and CtBP2 with RIP140 and delineated two motifs (PIDLS and PINLS) differentially required for in vitro interaction. Using different approaches (titration of endogenous CtBPs, mutagenesis and transfection in CtBP knock-out cells), we find that recruitment of CtBPs only partially explains the negative regulation exerted by RIP140. We then demonstrate that RIP140 associates in vitro not only with class I HDACs but also with class II enzymes such as HDAC5. This interaction mainly involves the N-terminus of RIP140 (residues 27-199) and two domains of HDAC5. Moreover, the two proteins functionally interfere in transfection experiments, and confocal microscopy indicates that they co-localize in the nucleus. Interestingly, using the specific HDAC inhibitor trichostatin A, we show that HDAC activity is dispensable for active transrepression by RIP140. Finally, we demonstrate that the C-terminal region of RIP140 contains two additional silencing domains and confers strong active transrepression independently of HDAC activity and CtBPs. Altogether, these data indicate that transcriptional inhibition by the cofactor RIP140 involves complex mechanisms relying on multiple domains and partners.

INTRODUCTION

###begin p 4
Estrogens are steroid hormones that regulate growth and differentiation of a large number of target tissues such as the mammary gland, the reproductive tract and skeletal and cardiovascular systems. These hormonal effects are mediated through two distinct intracellular receptors, ERalpha and ERbeta, which belong to the superfamily of nuclear receptors. ERs bind as homo- or heterodimers to specific DNA response elements (EREs) located within the regulatory regions of target genes. The ligand-dependent transcriptional activity of ERs is mediated by two distinct activation domains, a constitutive activation function-1 (AF-1) located within the N-terminus of the molecule (A/B domain) and a hormone-dependent AF-2 associated with the ligand-binding domain. Depending on cell and promoter contexts, these two domains function independently or synergistically.

Ligand binding induces a conformational change that promotes the recruitment of a large set of co-activator proteins (1). These transcription mediators act either by stabilizing the formation of a transcription pre-initiation complex or by facilitating chromatin disruption through various enzymatic activities that target histone tails. Several coactivators exhibit histone acetyltransferase activity (CBP/p300, SRC-1, ACTR and p/CAF), whereas others correspond to arginine methyltransferase (CARM1), kinase (TIF1alpha) or ubiquitin ligase (E6AP). On the other hand, ERalpha has been shown to interact specifically with co-repressors such as N-CoR in the presence of partial antiestrogens such as 4-hydroxytamoxifen (OHTam). These co-repressors in turn recruit histone deacetylases such as HDAC2 and HDAC4 (2), and we have recently shown that HDAC activity was required for the transrepressive effect of partial antiestrogens (3).

One of the first proteins to be identified as a hormone-recruited cofactor was Receptor-Interacting Protein 140 (RIP140) (4). The human RIP140 gene is located in a gene-poor region of chromosome 21 (5). This gene encodes a protein of 1158 residues which interacts with a large number of nuclear receptors such as ERalpha, TR, RAR and RXR (6), AR (7), VDR (8) PPARalpha/LXRalpha (9), GR (10), SF1 and DAX-1 (11). RIP140 also interacts with other transcription factors such as the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (12), 14-3-3 (13) or c-jun (14).

Despite its recruitment by agonist-liganded receptors, RIP140 exhibits a strong transcriptional repressive activity, which was initially attributed to competition with co-activator binding on nuclear receptors (15). However, RIP140 could also support active repression, and more recent studies have suggested that both class I HDACs and the CtBP1 protein could be recruited and contribute to its inhibitory activity (16,17). HDACs are chromatin-modifying enzymes which participate in the dynamic control of histone acetylation and counterbalance the activity of HATs, thus switching chromatin structure to a condensed state associated with transcription repression. In humans, numerous HDACs have been identified to date and are classified in three classes: class I (HDACs 1-3 and 8), class II (HDACs 4-7 and 9-11) and class III (seven human proteins homologous to yeast SIR2 enzyme) (18). CtBPs (C-terminal binding proteins) are highly conserved transcriptional co-repressors involved in various processes such as development, cell cycle regulation and transformation (19). The two family members (CtBP1 and CtBP2) are largely homologous and play both unique and redundant roles, as shown by gene invalidation (20). In Drosophila and vertebrates, CtBPs mediate transcriptional repression by a large number of factors and, according to the promoter, CtBP-mediated repression is dependent or independent of HDAC activity (19).

In this study, we have analysed the mechanisms by which RIP140 inhibits the regulation of gene transcription by estrogens. We have characterized the molecular mechanisms mediating RIP140 inhibitory activity by defining the respective roles and binding domains of the two CtBPs and class II HDACs on the RIP140 molecule. Finally, we show that the C-terminal part of RIP140 also conferred strong active repressive activity. Altogether, our data indicate that inhibition of estrogen signalling by RIP140 involves multiple domains and partners.

MCF-7 and HeLa human cancer cells were derived from stocks routinely maintained in the laboratory. Monolayer cell cultures were respectively grown in Ham's F-12/Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (1:1) (F12/DMEM) or in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (FCS) (InVitrogen, Cergy-Pontoise, France) and antibiotics. Mouse embryo fibroblasts (MEFs) derived from CtBP1+/-CtBP2+/- or from CtBP1-/-CtBP2-/- mice (20) were obtained from Dr Hildebrand (Pittsburgh, PA) and cultured in DMEM with 10% FCS. For transient transfection experiments, cells were plated at approximately80% confluence (106 cells/35 mm diameter well) and transfected in 6-well plates by the calcium phosphate method using CMV-betaGal as an internal control. Jurkat T cells were grown in suspension in RPMI supplemented with 10% FCS and transfected using the Lipofectamine 2000 reagent (InVitrogen, Cergy-Pontoise, France) according to the manufacturer's instructions (24-well plates). Cell extract preparation was carried out as recommended by Promega Corporation. Cells were lysed at 4degreesC for 10 min in 0.4 ml of lysis buffer (25 mM Tris pH 7.8, 2 mM EDTA, 10% glycerol, 1% Triton X-100). Luciferase activity was measured on 100 microl supernatant aliquots during 1 s after injection of 100 microl of luciferase detection solution using a luminometer (Labsystem, Les Ulis, France). When comparing basal levels between different cell lines, transfection data were normalized by the beta-galactosidase activities determined as described (31) and expressed as relative luciferase activities.

RIP140 belongs to an atypical class of nuclear receptor transcription co-regulators which are recruited by agonist-liganded nuclear receptors but negatively regulate their activity. As previously reported by others (33), we found that RIP140 actively inhibits transcription when fused to the heterologous DNA-binding domain (DBD) of the yeast GAL4 transcription factor (Gal-RIP plasmid). In various cell types, transfection of increasing concentrations of Gal-RIP strongly decreased the expression of the luciferase reporter gene driven by different promoters. Moreover, the intrinsic inhibitory effect of RIP140 was also efficient when we used an amplified system based on the activation of the reporter gene by the chimaeric LexA-VP16 fusion protein. As shown in Figure 1, Gal-RIP transfection led to a 10-fold decrease in transcription which was comparable with the effect of Gal-SHP, another ER co-repressor (34), whereas the Gal4 DBD alone was without any effect. This intrinsic ability of RIP140 to silence transcription in transient transfection assays suggested that it may be mediated through interaction with others repressors.

CtBP1 was previously shown to interact with RIP140 both in vitro and in vivo through a PIDLSCK sequence (17). The data presented in Figure 2A confirmed that CtBP1 expressed as a GST fusion protein was able to bind in vitro translated full-length RIP140. Interestingly, we observed a comparable interaction of RIP140 with CtBP2, another member of the family highly homologous to CtBP1.

The results indicated that the central region of the molecule encompassing residues 429-739 was the main interacting domain for CtBP1, although a faint binding was detected with the N-terminus of RIP140. The central region contains the known PIDLS motif (residues 440-444) and a second potential CtBP-binding motif (sequence PINLS located between residues 565 and 569) which was not previously identified. Interestingly, a search of sequence databases indicated that the two motifs are conserved in mouse and zebrafish cDNAs, suggesting that they both could play functional roles (A.Castet, unpublished observation).

Site-directed mutagenesis was performed to inactivate the two sites independently or simultaneously (mutPIDLS, mutPINLS and mutPID/NLS, respectively), either in the context of the GST-RIP(429-582) chimaeric protein (Fig. 2C) or in the full-length RIP140 molecule (Fig. 2D). In vitro interaction assays performed in both ways essentially gave similar results and demonstrated that both sites were involved in the interaction between RIP140 and CtBP1, with the PIDLS motif being clearly more potent than the PINLS sequence.

Interestingly, differences appeared in the in vitro binding of RIP140 to CtBP1 and CtBP2 since the central region of RIP140 was less efficient at recruiting CtBP2 than CtBP1, the N-terminus and central domains of RIP140 being equally able to retain labelled CtBP2 (Fig. 2B). In support of this observation, the residual binding of full-length labelled RIP140 mutated on either PIDLS site alone or both PIDLS and PINLS sites was more important on GST-CtBP2 than on GST-CtBP1 (Fig. 2D).

Together, these results indicate that RIP140 (i) interacts in vitro with both CtBP1 and CtBP2; and (ii) contains several binding sites for CtBPs (including two PIxLS-binding motifs) which are differentially involved in these interactions.

By western blot analysis, we showed that CtBPs were expressed at high levels in various human cancer cell lines (Fig. 3A). A single band migrating with an apparent mol. wt of 48 kDa and corresponding to CtBP1 and CtBP2 was detected with a comparable intensity in ER-positive (MCF-7 and T-47D) or ER-negative (MDA-MB231, MDA-MB435 and MDA-MB436) human breast cancer cell lines. Similar results were obtained in other cells of human or simian origin (HeLa, COS-1 or CV1 cells) whereas, in two of three human endometrial cancer cell lines, an additional faster migrating band was detected [corresponding probably to the previously described N-terminally truncated version of CtBP1 (35)]. The high expression of endogenous CtBPs could explain why overexpression of CtBP1 or CtBP2 in transient transfection did not significantly increase RIP140 repressive activity [(17) and data not shown].

To determine the relative role of CtBPs in RIP140-mediated transcriptional repression, we therefore introduced the double mutation of the PIDLS and PINLS sites in the RIP140 protein and compared its inhibitory activity with that of the wild-type protein. As shown in Figure 3B, the mutant RIP140 protein efficiently repressed the reporter gene transcription (42% of repression as compared with 75% for the wild-type protein), suggesting that, in these conditions, transcriptional inhibition by RIP140 was in part CtBP independent. We performed the same type of experiment with the Gal-RIP chimaeric proteins and obtained exactly the same results (53% repression with the PID/NLS mutant instead of 75% for the wild-type protein) (Fig. 3C).

We then used another approach based on the functional knock-out of CtBPs. Over-expression of the CtBP-interacting domain of the adenovirus E1A protein (E1A-CID) (21) again only partially relieved RIP140 transrepression activity (50% repression instead of 71%), either in the context of a fusion with the Gal4 DBD (Fig. 3D) or when evaluated on ERalpha activity (data not shown). Finally, we investigated the repressive activity of RIP140 on ERalpha activity in MEFs derived from an animal knock-out for both the CtBP1 and CtBP2 genes (20). As shown in Figure 4A, western blot analysis confirmed that the expression of CtBPs was lost in CtBP-/- MEFs when compared with CtBP+/- cells. However, when we analysed the effect of RIP140 expression on ERalpha activity, we found that transrepression was still effective in MEFs which do not express CtBPs (41% repression versus 51% in CtBP+/-).

We also analysed the inhibitory potential of the Gal-RIP protein in CtBP-/- or CtBP+/- cells. As shown in Figure 4B, a slight but not significant reduction in the ability to repress transcription was noticed in CtBP-deficient cells (61% versus 73% in CtBP+/- cells). We then analysed the activity of the isolated central domain of RIP140 encompassing the two CtBP-binding sites. This region clearly repressed luciferase activity in CtBP-expressing fibroblasts (79% inhibition) but was only poorly active in CtBP-/- cells (21% repression). As expected, re-expression of either CtBP1 or CtBP2 in knock-out cells restored a full repression of the central domain which became as active as the full-length molecule (Fig. 4C).

Altogether, these results supported a strong in vitro interaction of CtBPs with the central domain of RIP140 exhibiting a convincing CtBP-dependent transrepression when tested as an isolated module. However, in our cell system, when we considered the full-length RIP140 molecule, CtBPs were clearly not the main mediators of RIP140 repressive activity, suggesting that other effectors might exist.

Amongst the mechanisms that might explain the inhibitory effect of RIP140 on nuclear receptor activity, the recruitment of class I HDACs (HDAC1 and 3) has been evoked in the case of RAR/RXR heterodimers (16). As shown in Figure 5A, we confirmed that class I HDACs could be recruited in vitro by RIP140. In GST pull-down experiments, we observed a specific interaction of RIP140 not only with HDAC1 [as previously described (16)] but also with HDAC2.

We then tested whether RIP140 could interact with class II HDACs, and our results showed that both HDAC5 (Fig. 5B-D) and HDAC6 (data not shown) could bind to RIP140. In order to define more precisely the interaction domains on RIP140 and HDAC5, we performed interaction assays with deletion mutants of the two partners. When tested as GST fusion proteins, we found that the major interacting domain of HDAC5 on RIP140 was located in the N-terminus of the molecule (Fig. 5B). However, both the central and the C-terminal regions of RIP140 also retained in vitro translated HDAC5, though the strength of these interactions appeared less intense. By deletion analysis in the N-terminus region of RIP140, we found that the main interaction domain for HDACs (both class I and II) corresponds to a region encompassing residues 27-199 and requires a sequence between residues 115 and 199 (Fig. 5C and data not shown for class I enzymes). On the other hand, both fragments of HDAC5 corresponding to residues 123-673 and 674-1113 (encompassing the catalytic site) interacted with in vitro translated RIP140, whereas no retention was observed with the N-terminus of HDAC5 (residues 1-122) (Fig. 5D). Again, we observed a preferential interaction of the two HDAC domains with the N-terminus region of RIP140, and the binding of the sequence corresponding to the last 576 residues of RIP140 (amino acids 682-1158) was almost undetectable.

To further support the in vitro interaction between RIP140 and HDAC5, we used confocal microscopy to define whether the two proteins could co-localize in intact cells. We transiently co-transfected expression vectors for YFP-RIP140 together with CFP-HDAC5 in COS-1 cells. As expected from previous reports (13,29), both proteins were detected in the nuclear foci, and confocal analysis revealed that the two signals merge nicely (Fig. 6A). This therefore suggested that over-expressed RIP140 and HDAC5 co-localized in subnuclear compartments.

Finally, to evidence a functional link between the two factors, we investigated if over-expression of one of the two molecules could modulate the transcriptional activity of the other. In our transient transfection experiments, HDAC5 produced almost no effects on RIP140 transcriptional repression (data not shown). In contrast, as shown in Figure 6B, we noticed that RIP140 over-expression significantly amplified the transcriptional repression of Gal-HDAC5 proteins. Interestingly, this effect was obtained only with constructs corresponding to the sequences that we found to interact in vitro with RIP140 (domains 123-673 and 180-1113). No decrease in luciferase activity was noticed when RIP140 was co-transfected with the Gal4 DBD alone or with the Gal4-HDAC5 mutant corresponding to residues 1-122. Altogether, these data suggested that RIP140 and HDAC5 could functionally interact in the cell nucleus.

We then investigated whether the enzymatic activity of HDACs was required for their in vitro interaction with RIP140 and for its transrepressive activity. It has been reported in some cases that HDAC could inhibit transcription independently of their deacetylase activity. As shown in Figure 7A, TSA, a potent HDAC inhibitor, did not significantly modify the binding of radiolabelled RIP140 on HDAC1, HDAC2 or HDAC5 (domain 674-1113) expressed as GST fusion proteins.

To investigate whether TSA could relieve RIP140 transcriptional repression, we first used the simplified system with the full-length RIP140 or different regions of the molecule fused to the Gal4 DBD (Fig. 7B). In these conditions, we found, as expected, that transrepression of the HDAC-interacting domain [Gal-RIP(27-199)] was severely impaired by TSA treatment. Interestingly, the same effect was noticed for the CtBP-binding region [Gal-RIP(429-739)], suggesting a CtBP-mediated HDAC recruitment on this isolated domain. However, in the same conditions, the Gal-RIP still efficiently repressed transcription even in the presence of TSA, suggesting that in the context of the full-length protein, HDAC activity was dispensable for active repression.

Similar results were obtained on RIP140-mediated repression of ERalpha-dependent transactivation. As shown in Figure 7C, treatment with increasing concentrations of TSA did not relieve the repressive effect of RIP140 on estradiol-dependent transactivation of ERalpha. This was obtained in different cell types (data not shown), on two reporter plasmids with either the beta-globin or the thymidine kinase promoters and also evidenced when ERalpha transactivates through an ERE-independent mechanism (14). Together, these results did not support the idea that HDAC enzymatic activity was required for transcriptional repression of ERs by RIP140.

To investigate whether other domains of RIP140 could be involved in transcriptional repression, we generated a Gal4 fusion protein containing only the COOH moiety of RIP140 [Gal-RIP(753-1158)]. When tested in transient transfection, this domain strongly repressed transcription and, in dose-response experiments, this region was even more potent in silencing transcription than the full-length protein (Fig. 8A), or than the two other repressive regions corresponding to the N-terminus or the central part of RIP140 (data not shown).

The C-terminal domain was active on several reporter constructs bearing different promoters and was found to confer a strong repression in all the cell lines that we tested (Fig. 8B and data not shown). As expected from the in vitro interaction data (Figs 2B, and 5B and D) and from the results obtained in transient transfection with the full-length protein, repression conferred by the C-terminal part of RIP140 was not sensitive to TSA treatment and was very potent in CtBP-/- MEFs (Fig. 8C).

To delineate more precisely the C-terminal repression domain(s), we generated other deletion mutants. As shown in Figure 8D, this allowed us to demonstrate that two regions (corresponding to residues 753-804 and 848-1158) supported efficient transcriptional repression in transfection experiments. Together these results indicated that the intrinsic repressive activity of RIP140 involved multiple domains. The two main domains, which are independent of CtBP and HDAC activities, are located in the C-terminal part of the molecule.

RIP140 is an atypical transcription regulator, which, despite its hormone-dependent recruitment by nuclear receptors, negatively regulates their transcriptional activation. In this study, we have characterized the interaction of RIP140 with different interacting proteins (CtBP and HDAC) which could act as downstream effectors, and we have defined the role of these molecules in estrogen transcriptional signalling.

Our results demonstrate that RIP140 interacts in vitro with both CtBP1 and CtBP2 by means of various domains. The association of CtBP1 with the central region of RIP140 involves two motifs (PIDLS and PINLS). Previous studies have identified CtBP-interacting proteins harbouring two binding sites, such as EBNA3A (36), xTcf-3 (37) and Evi-1 (38). This supports the notion that CtBPs could bind some of their target proteins as homo- or hetero-dimers (39) but such a binding stoichiometry remains to be demonstrated in the case of RIP140. In addition, a direct interaction between CtBPs and HDACs has been demonstrated [for a review see Chinnadurai (19)], and it is therefore conceivable that ternary complexes comprising HDAC/CtBP and RIP140 may exist under some conditions. Interestingly, since reticulocyte lysates contain detectable HDAC activity, we could speculate that the binding of CtBPs that we observed with the N-terminal moiety of RIP140 could be in fact indirect and mediated by HDACs through regions that do not contain a recognizable PxDLS motif [for a review see Turner and Crossley (40)]. Our data suggest that the relative importance of these different modes of recruitment by RIP140 may vary for CtBP1 and CtBP2 (see Fig. 2B and D). Several lines of evidence obtained from the corresponding gene inactivation studies in mice indicate that the two CtBPs might exhibit different properties (20). Moreover, it has been shown that SUMOylation preferentially affects the CtBP1 protein, controlling its cellular localization and its co-repressor function (41).

Despite the clear interaction in vitro with RIP140, we found that, in our model, CtBPs could only partly explain its repressive action. This was based on the functional inactivation of CtBPs using the CID of E1A and on the use of MEFs devoid of CtBP1 and CtBP2. In addition, as it has been shown that the co-repressor function of CtBPs could be regulated by the NAD+/NADH ratio (42), we have tested whether agents that perturb the cellular redox status could modify the intrinsic repressive activity of RIP140. Treatment of cells with 200 microM CoCl2, which has been shown to significantly enhance the repression of ZEB and its interaction with CtBP1 (42), did not modify the repressive activity of Gal-RIP (data not shown). Our results are in accordance with the data published by Vo et al. showing that the mutation of the PIDLS motif in the context of the full-length RIP140 only partially relieved the repression of an (ERE)2-pS2-CAT reporter gene (17). More recent data have confirmed that the CtBP-binding motif is not essential for intrinsic repression by RIP140 (43). However, it has been shown recently that Pak1 could phosphorylate CtBP and decrease its transcriptional repressive activity (44). The amount of phosphorylated CtBP, which may vary from one cell to another, could therefore account for variation in the level of CtBP-dependent repression by RIP140.

In the present study, we have also demonstrated that RIP140 associates with class II HDACs and have shown that a sequence comprised between residues 115 and 199 of RIP140 is needed for the interaction. Surprisingly, we found that the repressive activity of full-length RIP140 was not affected by inhibition of HDAC enzymatic activity. This contrasts with two previously published studies, which described a TSA-sensitive repression by RIP140 of RAR/RXR (16) or SF-1 (45). Our results are, however, not inconsistent, since several groups have reported that class IIa HDACs, i.e. HDAC4 (46,47), HDAC5 (22), HDAC7 (29) and HDAC9 (48), have the potential to repress transcription in a deacetylase- independent manner. HDAC10, which is a class IIb enzyme, exhibits the same property (49). Moreover, the highly homologous HDAC6 and HDAC10 both appear more resistant to inhibitors of HDAC activity (49,50). The precise pattern of expression of the different HDACs in estradiol-responsive cells is not known and it would be interesting to define the relative expression of class I and class II enzymes in these cells. The apparent discrepancy of our results with the data showing that the inhibitory effect of RIP140 on RAR/RXR is relieved by TSA (16) could be explained by the nature of the nuclear receptor and/or cell or promoter context. As pointed out by Fernandes et al. (51), the inhibition of estrogen- and glucocorticoid-dependent transcription by LCoR appeared sensitive to TSA, whereas progesterone- or vitamin D-dependent transcription was not affected. The demonstration of a regulatory role of HDACs in RIP140-mediated repression, independently of their deacetylase activity, would require their invalidation by either genetic recombination or small interfering RNA approaches. Interestingly, HDACs and CtBPs have been shown to participate in the negative regulation of a large number of transcription factors and, in the case of MEF2, both proteins appear to be recruited by MITR in a multicomponent co-repressor complex (52). Based on our results showing that RIP140 over-expression co-localizes with HDAC5 and amplifies its silencing activity (Fig. 6), it might be important to determine whether RIP140 could participate in the repression of other transcription factors such as MEF2.

Finally, our results indicate that RIP140 is a complex transcription factor, which possesses multiple transcription regulatory modules, including two newly identified domains in the C-terminal region of the protein (Fig. 9). During the revision of this manuscript, Christian et al. (53) also reported, in support of our conclusions, that the C-terminal region of RIP140 contained silencing domains. This C-terminal region supports strong repressive activity but does not require HDAC activity or CtBPs. We have investigated whether this region could bind other known transcription repressors such as Suv39H1 and HP1 proteins, but failed to detect a significant interaction, and we are currently trying to identify which partners could mediate this negative control of transcription. Interestingly, the mapping of several distinct domains is reminiscent of the situation observed for ER transcriptional coactivators such as members of the SRC family and CBP/p300, which also contain several separate activation domains (1). In addition, this also suggests that the overall repressive activity of RIP140 may depend on the interplay among these negative regulatory modules, which could be differently active according to the cell type, promoter or nuclear receptor considered.

In vitro interaction of RIP140 with CtBPs. (A) GST pull-down assays were carried out as described in Materials and Methods using bacterially expressed GST-CtBP1 or GST-CtBP2 proteins to retain 35S-labelled RIP140. (B) GST-RIP140 proteins containing different regions of the molecule, i.e. GST-RIP(27-439), GST-RIP(429-739) or GST-RIP(683-1158), were tested for their interaction with 35S-labelled CtBP1 and CtBP2. (C) GST pull-down assays were performed to precipitate 35S-labelled CtBP1 with the GST-RIP(429-582) protein containing the wild-type or mutated sequences for the PIDLS (mutPIDLS), PINLS (mutPINLS) or both (mutPID/NLS) sites. (D) GST-CtBP1 or GST-CtBP2 proteins were used to pull-down radiolabelled RIP140 either wild type or mutated for the PIDLS (mutPIDLS), PINLS (mutPINLS) or both sites (mutPID/NLS). Results are expressed as a percentage of the binding of the wild-type RIP140.

 Role of CtBPs in transcriptional repression by RIP140. (A) A western blot experiment using an antibody specific for CtBP1 and CtBP2 was performed as described in Materials and Methods. Cell lines from various tissues were analysed. MCF-7 and T47-D are derived from ERalpha-positive breast carcinoma, whereas MDA-MB231, MDA-MB435 or MDA-MB 436 are from ERalpha-negative breast carcinoma. Ishikawa (Ishi), RL-95 and HEC1A are from endometrium, HeLa cells from a cervix carcinoma, and CV-1 and COS-1 from African green monkey kidney. (B) Transient transfections of HeLa cells were performed using Lipofectamine 2000 reagent as described in Materials and Methods. The ERE-betaGlob-Luc reporter (125 ng) and ERalpha (50 ng) expression plasmid were transfected together with either the vectors encoding RIP140 wild type, mutated for the PIDLS and PINLS sites (mutPID/NLS), or the empty vector only (750 ng). Relative luciferase activity was measured 24 h after the treatment of cells with 17beta-estradiol (E2, 10-8 M) or vehicle alone and is expressed as a percentage of control in the presence of E2. (C) HeLa cells were transiently transfected with the 17M5betaGlob-Luc reporter construct (1 microg) together with 1.5 microg of Gal-RIP wild type (black box) or mutated for the two motifs PIDLS and PINLS (Gal-RIPmutPID/NLS, grey box) versus empty vector alone (white box). Luciferase activity was measured 48 h after transfection and is expressed as a percentage of control with Gal4 alone. Results are the mean (+/-SD) of three values obtained in three independent experiments. (D) HeLa cells were transiently transfected with the pSV40G5E1BLuc reporter (1 microg) together with 1 microg of Gal-RIP plasmid (black boxes) or empty vector (white boxes) in the presence or absence of the pcDNA3-dl1119 plasmid (2.5 microg) allowing the expression of the E1A exon 2 (E1A-CID). Results are expressed as relative luciferase activity (% of control) and are the mean (+/-SD) of six values from two independent experiments.

(A) MEFs (either CtBP+/- or CtBP-/-) were transiently transfected with the ERE-betaGlob-Luc reporter (0.5 microg) together with the ERalpha (0.2 microg) and RIP140 (1.8 microg) expression plasmid (black boxes) or empty vector (white boxes) in the presence of 17beta-estradiol (E2) or 4-hydroxytamoxifen (OHTam, 10-8 M). Results are expressed as raw luciferase activity and are the mean (+/-SD) of six values from two independent experiments. The level of expression of CtBPs assessed by western blot analysis in the two types of MEFs is also shown. (B) Empty vector (1 microg), Gal-RIP full-length construct and its central part comprised between residues 429 and 739 were transiently transfected in CtBP+/- (white boxes) or CtBP-/- (black boxes) MEFs together with the L8G5-Luc reporter and the LexA-VP16 activator plasmids. Cells were transfected using Lipofectamine 2000 reagent. Results are expressed as relative luciferase activity (percentage of control Gal4) and are the mean of three values. (C) Transient transfections were realized in CtBP-/- MEFs using Lipofectamine 2000 reagent. Gal4, Gal-RIP or Gal-RIP(429-739) expression plasmids (1 microg) have been transfected together with the L8G5-Luc reporter and the LexA-VP16 activator plasmids in the presence or absence of CtBP1 or CtBP2. Luciferase activity which represents the mean (+/-SD) of three values was measured 48 h after the transfection and is expressed as a percentage of each control without RIP140.
