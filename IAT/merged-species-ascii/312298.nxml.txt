We have analyzed several randomly selected mRNAs, of the relatively abundant category, on the basis of maternal or zygotic origin and translational efficiency at different developmental stages. For this purpose, clones from a Xenopus embryo cDNA library were hybridized with cDNA probes prepared with poly(A)+RNA from polysomes and from mRNPs of embryos at different stages. The results obtained indicate that the majority of the relatively abundant mRNAs (38 out of 61) is subject to some kind of translational regulation during embryogenesis. Moreover, 30 clones have been selected as corresponding to mRNAs that behave, from the point of view of transcriptional and translational regulation, similarly to previously studied ribosomal protein (r-protein) mRNAs. Sequence analysis of 20 of these selected cDNAs has shown that half of them are in fact homologous to already sequenced r-protein mRNAs. Unexpectedly we have found that also the mRNA for alpha-cardiac actin and another mRNA homologous to creatine kinase M mRNA have a similar translational regulation during embryogenesis.
