Several studies have shown that the clinical phenotypes of dentinogenesis imperfecta type II (DGI-II) may be caused by mutations in dentin sialophosphoprotein (DSPP). However, no previous studies have documented the clinical phenotype and genetic basis of DGI-II in a Mongolian family from China.

We identified a large five-generation Mongolian family from China with DGI-II, comprising 64 living family members of whom 22 were affected. Linkage analysis of five polymorphic markers flanking DSPP gene was used to genotype the families and to construct the haplotypes of these families. All five DSPP exons including the intron-exon boundaries were PCR-amplified and sequenced in 48 members of this large family.

All affected individuals showed discoloration and severe attrition of their teeth, with obliterated pulp chambers and without progressive high frequency hearing loss or skeletal abnormalities. No recombination was found at five polymorphic markers flanking DSPP in the family. Direct DNA sequencing identified a novel A-->G transition mutation adjacent to the donor splicing site within intron 3 in all affected individuals but not in the unaffected family members and 50 unrelated Mongolian individuals.

Dentinogenesis imperfecta type II (DGI-II) (OMIM # 125490) is an autosomal dominant dental disorder with a complete penetrance that affects both the primary and the permanent teeth [1]. DGI-II is characterized by amber and opalescent teeth, abnormal dentine leading to obliteration of the pulp chamber, and enamel that, although unaffected, tends to fracture. This causes the dentine to undergo rapid attrition, leading to a marked shortening of the teeth. The gene DSPP is located in the 6.6-cM D4S2691-D4S2692 interval at 4q21 and encodes a precursor protein, which is cleaved to yield dentine sialoprotein (DSP) and dentine phosphoprotein (DPP) [2-4]. A nonsense mutation in DSPP has been reported to cause DGI-II in a Chinese family [5] and other DSPP mutations have subsequently been demonstrated in Chinese families with DGI-II [6-9]. In addition, families with DGI-II in other countries have been reported with mutations in DSPP [10-15]. However, the genetic basis of DGI-II in Mongolian families has not been explored before. In the present study, we describe a large, five-generation Mongolian family with DGI-II and report a novel DSPP mutation in this family.

We identified a large, five-generation Mongolian family with DGI-II consisting of 64 living family members, of which 22 were affected (Figure 1). All living members were examined clinically and taken for panoramic dental tomograms. The clinical and radiographic images were published under the patients' written permission. The study "Gene Research on Dentinogenesis Imperfecta in Mongolian Families" was approved by the Research Ethics Committee of Peking Union Medical College.

Mutation screening was carried out using direct DNA sequence analysis. The exons of the DSPP gene were amplified by primers flanking the exon-intron boundaries (Table 1). Exon 4 was amplified into two, and Exon 5 was amplified into six fragments. PCR conditions for exons 1-5 were as followlling: a 5-min initial denaturation at 94degreesC, 35 cycles of 1- min denaturation at 94degreesC, 1- min annealing at 58degreesC, 58degreesC,50degreesC, 60degreesC, 60degreesC, 60degreesC,64degreesC, 60degreesC, 60degreesC, 55degreesC, and 55degreesC, respectively, and a 1-min extension at 72degreesC, and a 5-min final extension at 72degreesC.

In the five-generation Mongolian family with DGI-II, the proband was a man aged 32 (Figure 1, IV5 ). His permanent teeth showed a shade of brown and almost complete attrition of the enamel layer without a history of periapical infections. All affected individuals showed discoloration and severe attrition of their teeth with obliterated pulp chambers. In addition, the enamel, although unaffected, had tended to fracture, causing the dentine to undergo rapid attrition, leading to a marked shortening of the teeth. Both the primary and the permanent teeth were affected (Figure 2). No high-frequency hearing loss or obvious skeletal abnormalities were found in any of the affected individuals.

Haplotype analysis showed that haplotype 3-2-3-4-1 cosegregated with the disease in this family, indicating that the disease locus was linked to the chromosome region harboring DSPP, and that DSPP was a candidate gene (Figure 1).

We identified a novel mutation (IVS3+3A-->G) in DSPP in a large Mongolian family suffering from dentinogenesis imperfecta II (DGI-II). This novel mutation (IVS3+3A-->G) resulted in a donor splicing site change from wild-type GTAT to mutated GTGT in one of the two DSPP alleles that co-segregate in affected individuals. This mutation did not exist in unaffected family members or in an additional 50 healthy Mongolian controls. These results suggest that the A-->G mutation caused DGI-II in this Mongolian family.

DGI-II is a clinically heterogeneous disorder caused by DSPP mutations [7,17-19]. Previous studies have reported DGI-II families with a mis-sense mutation in exon 2 [6], a nonsense mutation in exon 3 [5], splicing site mutations in intron 3+1 [6,9] and a frameshift mutation in intron 2 [9]. However, the molecular mechanisms by which DSPP mutations cause DGI-II are still unclear. In this Mongolian family, we speculate that the novel mutation is likely to produce a new splicing site and destroy the original splicing site within intron 3. This mutation may result in the abnormal intron splicing and lead to exon-skipping with a loss of exon 3, which encodes part of dentin sialoprotein protein. Because tissue samples from this family were unavailable, we were unable to prepare mRNA from the affected individuals to determine the sequences of DSPP transcripts.

To our knowledge, this study is the first report of a novel DSPP mutation causing DGI-II in a Mongolian family from China. This mutation differs from those found previously in other Chinese families and in families of other ethnic groups. Mongolians represent one of the major ethnic minority groups in China. They reside on the Inner Mongolian grassland in the northeast of China, where they live a nomadic lifestyle. This Mongolian family, whose forebears lived on the Horqin grassland in the eastern part of Inner Mongolia for many generations, is a relatively homogeneous population with characteristics that are advantageous for genetic research, including low divorce rate, limited mobility, consistent dietary habits and favorable environmental factors.
