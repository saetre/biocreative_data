The kinetic constants for cleavage of the tRNA(Tyr)Su3 precursor by the M1 RNA of E. coli RNase P were determined in the absence and presence of the C5 protein under single and multiple (steady state) turnover conditions. The rate constant of cleavage in the reaction catalyzed by M1 RNA alone was 5 times higher in single turnover than in multiple turnovers, suggesting that a rate-limiting step is product release. Cleavage by M1 RNA alone and by the holoenzyme under identical buffer conditions demonstrated that C5 facilitated product release. Addition of different product-like molecules under single turnover reaction conditions inhibited cleavage both in the absence and presence of C5. In the presence of C5, the Ki value for matured tRNA was approximately 20 times higher than in its absence, suggesting that C5 also reduces the interaction between the 5'-matured tRNA and the enzyme. In a growing cell the number of tRNA molecules is approximately 1000 times higher than the number of RNase P molecules. A 100-fold excess of matured tRNA over enzyme clearly inhibited cleavage in vitro. We discuss the possibility that RNase P is involved in the regulation of tRNA expression under certain growth conditions.
