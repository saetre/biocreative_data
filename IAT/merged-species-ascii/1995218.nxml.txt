Tumors expressing a transforming growth factor-beta type I receptor (TbetaRI) mutant with sequence deletions in a nine-alanine (9A) stretch of the signal peptide are reported to be highly associated with disease progression. Expression of this mutant could interfere with endogenous TGFbeta signaling in the cell. However, little is known about the importance of the remaining part of the signal peptide on the cellular function of TbetaRI.

We cloned and identified four new in-frame deletion variants of TbetaRI, designated DM1 to DM4, in pleural effusion-derived tumor cells. Intriguingly, DM1 and DM2, with a small region truncated in the putative signal peptide of TbetaRI, had a serious defect in their protein expression compared with that of the wild-type receptor. Using serial deletion mutagenesis, we characterized a region encoded by nucleotides 16-51 as a key element controlling TbetaRI protein expression. Consistently, both DM1 and DM2 have this peptide deleted. Experiments using cycloheximde and MG132 further confirmed its indispensable role for the protein stability of TbetaRI. In contrast, truncation of the 9A-stretch itself or a region downstream to the stretch barely affected TbetaRI expression. However, variants lacking a region C-terminal to the stretch completely lost their capability to conduct TGFbeta-induced transcriptional activation. Intriguingly, expression of DM3 in a cell sensitive to TGFbeta made it significantly refractory to TGFbeta-mediated growth inhibition. The effect of DM3 was to ablate the apoptotic event induced by TGFbeta.

We identified four new transcript variants of TbetaRI in malignant effusion tumor cells and characterized two key elements controlling its protein stability and transcriptional activation. Expression of one of variants bestowed cancer cells with a growth advantage in the presence of TGFbeta. These results highlight the potential roles of some naturally occurring TbetaRI variants on the promotion of tumor malignancy.

Malignant pleural effusions are good sources of transforming growth factor beta (TGFbeta)-resistant tumor cells. They frequently contain high levels of TGFbeta of around 7.5 ng/mL [1]. However, epithelial tumor cells shedding or migrating from local primary tumor sites are still alive and grow well in the pleural effusions. Such cells are believed to have some defects in the TGFbeta receptors or in receptor-mediated signaling pathways. Therefore, in the present study, tumor cells derived from pleural effusions of patients with lung cancer were chosen for examining the gene expression and gene integrity of these receptors.

Type I TGFbeta receptor (TbetaRI) is a key signaling receptor for TGFbeta to conduct Smad-mediated transcriptional activation in a cell. There are three major cell surface receptors characterized for TGFbeta ligands, designated TbetaRI, TbetaRII, and TbetaRIII. In early signaling events, TGFbeta binds to its cell surface TbetaRII, followed by the recruitment and phosphorylation of TbetaRI on a juxtamembrane glycine/serine (GS)-rich domain. This phosphorylation results in the association of R-Smads (Smad2 and Smad3) with a shared partner, Smad4, to form heterotrimers that undergo nuclear translocation to regulate TGFbeta-responsive genes. The putative function of TbetaRIII in these events is to facilitate ligand binding to TbetaRI and TbetaRII [2]. Among these TGFbeta receptors, the type I plays a pivotal role in conducting the TGFbeta stimulus from cell surface into the nucleus to deliver various biological outcomes. Functional disruption, mutation, or aberrant expression of the TGFbeta type I receptor gene (Tgfbr1) is frequently associated with human diseases, including cancers [3-6].

The Tgfbr1 gene is a tumor susceptible allele. Over 30% of patients with ovarian cancer harbor somatic changes in exons 1 to 6 [7-9]. Most changes are in-frame deletions or insertion mutations in the nine-alanine (9A) stretch of the putative signal peptide or missense mutations in the catalytic kinase domain of the receptor. Other TbetaRI transcript variants with sequence defect in the peptide have been also reported in the rat kidney [10]. Notably, a gene variant with a three-alanine deletion (Tgfbr1-6A) in the 9A stretch was found recently in a variety of cancers [5,7,11,12], suggesting that this signal peptide is a susceptible site for its gene mutation. Transfection of this variant has been shown to convert TGFbeta growth inhibitory signals into growth stimulatory signals in cells [13]. However, little is known about cellular functions of regions in the signal peptide other than the 9A stretch.

We found four naturally occurring TbetaRI variants in three patients with lung cancer. All variants have different in-framed truncations in the signal peptide. Molecular dissection of the peptide using serial deletion mutagenesis characterized two novel functional regions that participate in maintaining TbetaRI protein stability and receptor-mediated transcriptional regulation in cells. Expression of one of these variants in a cell could lead to its refractoriness to TGFbeta, supporting an idea that naturally occurring TbetaRI may have a role in tumor progression. Collectively, our data suggest that the signal peptide of TbetaRI can be a susceptible region for mutation resulting in TGFbeta insensitivity in cancer. Mutations occurred in different regions of the signal peptide may display distinct TbetaRI defect modes and suggest that the variants with these mutations may represent potential therapeutic targets in cancers.

Four new Tgfbr1 transcript variants were found in pleural effusion-derived tumor cells. Total RNA was extracted from patient cells CA427, CA528, CA1109, and from the normal control cells, WI38 and HUVEC, and reverse-transcribed into cDNA. Nested-PCR amplification reactions using two pairs of primers, P1 and P2, located in the 5' and 3' untranslated regions were performed to clone out the endogenous Tgfbr1 transcript variants from the cells. Gel electrophoresis of the amplicons revealed that at least two additional Tgfbr1 transcript variants in the patient cells. However, no extra band was detected in the normal control cells, except for the 1.5 kb band representing the wild-type Tgfbrl transcript (Fig. 1A). After gene cloning and sequencing, four new in-framed deletion variants were identified in the patients totally. The nucleotide sequences of each variant in the truncated region are shown in Figure 1B and listed in Table 1. They were designated as DM1 and DM2, with sizes around 1.5 kb, and DM3 and DM4, with 0.3 kb and 0.9 kb deletions, respectively (Fig. 1C). Intriguingly, all the variants had varied nucleotide deletions in a sequence coding for the putative signal peptide of TbetaRI. The proteins encoded by the DM3 and DM4 transcript variants also lack the transmembrane domain and either partial or entire extracellular and GS-rich regions, respectively. Thus, the data suggest that the insensitivity of effusion tumor cells to TGFbeta may be caused by defects in the protein integrity of TbetaRI.

Total RNA was extracted from WI38, HUVEC, and pleural effusion-derived tumor cells followed by reverse transcription. Nested PCR reactions amplified Tgfbr1 coding sequences using two pairs of primers, P1 and P2, as indicated at the top of Panel C. The resultant amplicons were resolved in a 1% agarose gel followed by gel purification, gene cloning, and direct sequencing. The nucleotide sequences flanking the truncated region(s) in each variant are marked at the top of Panel B. Panel C: Schematic illustration of the Tgfbr1 variants. DM1 and DM2 are in-frame variants lacking nucleotides 16-75 and 15-80, respectively, located in the signal sequence of the Tgfbr1 gene. DM3 and DM4 represent cytoplasmic variants lacking transmembrane and partial intracellular domains, as indicated.

To detect the in vivo expression of Tgfbr1 transcript variants directly, ribonuclease protection assays were carried out using individual antisense riboprobes for these endogenous variants in CA1109 effusion cells. The data shown in Figure 2 confirm that the existence of these four transcript variants was not an artifact of the reverse transcription or PCR reactions but that they occurred naturally in the tumor cells. We subsequently genotyped Tgfbr1 gene from the tumor cells to determine if this deletion event was caused by a somatic mutation. Gene amplification was carried out by PCR amplification using published primers [9] to target the intronic sequences of exons 1, 2, or 3. The results obtained from direct sequencing showed no detectable mutations in the effusion tumor and normal control cells (data not shown). Apparently, the nucleotide deletions in the signal peptides sequence of those transcripts do not occur at the gene structural level but may be contributed by RNA editing or undefined post-transcriptional cellular processes.

Detection of transcripts of Tgfbr1 variants by RNase protection analysis. Total RNA extracted from CA1109 effusion tumor cells were protected by corresponding antisense riboprobes, as indicated at the top. The riboprobes were synthesized by T7 RNA polymerase using T7 promoter-containing DNA fragment of individual variant as a template. The predicted protected fragments are 263 bp for D1 (DM1), 192 bp for D2 (DM2), 151 bp for D3 (DM3), and 90 bp for D4 (DM4). Lanes 5 and 6: the mixed riboprobes (M) were incubated with (+) or without (-) RNase A/T1, respectively. Lanes 1-4: the total RNA (10 mug aliquots) was hybridized with individual purified antisense riboprobes and the protected fragments were resolved on a 6% acrylamide/8 M urea sequencing gel. * Indicates an unidentified Tgfbr1 transcript variant in CA1109 tumor cells protected by the anti-DM3 riboprobe.

Because no reliable antibody specific to TbetaRI was available, the coding sequences of these variants were constructed and expressed as C-terminal HA-tagged proteins in HEK293 and R1B cells. Western blotting analyses indicated that the variants had great differences in their protein expression. Notably, DM1, lacking nucleotides 16-75, and DM2, lacking nucleotides 15-80, were expressed at extremely low levels in the cells as compared with the expression of the wild-type control and the other two variants (Fig. 3A). The same expression pattern was also observed in R1B (Fig. 3A) and Cos-7 cells (data not shown), indicating that the differential expression must be cell type independent. An experiment using a plasmid encoding green fluorescence protein co-transfected with the individual variant genes showed that there were no substantial differences in gene transfection efficiency, ranging from 84.4% to 90.9% as determined by flow cytometric analyses. Consistently, reverse transcriptase (RT)-PCR analysis using P3 primers, as indicated in Figure 3, showed that no distinction in the level of RNA transcript among the exogenous variants was detected in the cells.

To determine if an element in the signal peptide might affect TbetaRI expression, the sequence from nucleotide 16 to nucleotide 117 was serially deleted as shown schematically in Figure 4A. The DS1 mutant lacks nucleotides 16-51, which code for a peptide N-terminal to a 9A stretch. The DS2 mutant protein has a peptide truncation in the 9A stretch itself, which has been reported to be susceptible to nucleotide deletion in patients with several types of cancer [5,7,13]. The DS3 mutant, with deletion of nucleotides 79-117, encodes a protein lacking a peptide C-terminal to the 9A stretch. The data shown in Figure 4B clearly indicate that deletion of the small sequence of nucleotides 16-51 (DS1) is sufficient to impair the expression of TbetaRI protein. Accordingly, both DM1 and DM2 variants with deletion of this sequence also demonstrated the same defect in their protein expression. In Figure 4C, RT-PCR analysis further confirmed that differential protein expression among those deletion mutants was not because of differences in the levels of their transcripts. In contrast to DS1, the deletion of nucleotides 52-78 (DS2) or 79-117 (DS3) affected expression only slightly. Thus, the peptide encoded by nucleotides 16-51 is a key element modulating the cellular expression of the TbetaRI protein.

Using wild-type Tgfbr1 (WT) as a template, the regions 5' or 3' to the 9A stretch sequence or the 9A stretch itself were truncated serially by site-directed deletion mutagenesis and designated as DS1, DS3, and DS2, respectively. HEK 293 cells were either untransfected (UN) or transfected with individual variants or vector control (VC) plasmid, as indicated at the top. The cells were divided into two groups for Western blotting or RT-PCR analyses 24 h after transfection. Panel B: Western blotting. Each lysate (30 mug) was resolved on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel, immunoblotted with HA-specific antibody, and reprobed with anti-beta-Actin antibody as a loading control. Panel C: RT-PCR. Total RNA was extracted from each transfectant and reverse transcribed. PCR reactions using P3 primers, as indicated at the bottom of Panel A, were utilized and the resultant amplicons were resolved on 1% agarose gels. A beta-Actin transcript and its protein were used as loading controls, as indicated on the right.

To determine if a sequence deletion of the signal peptide might affect translation efficiency resulting in failure of expression of TbetaRI, the DM1 was chosen because it had the lowest protein expression among those variants. The experiment coupling in vitro transcription and translation demonstrated no distinct difference between DM1 and the wild-type control on the translation efficiency (Fig. 5A).

Protein stability of exogenous wild-type TbetaRI-HA and the DM1 variant in HEK293 cells. Panel A: Translation efficiency. A plasmid (1 mug) encoding for wild-type (WT) TbetaRI or DM1 was transcribed and translated in vitro using a coupled reticulocyte lysate system. 35S-labeled proteins were resolved on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and visualized by autoradiography. The control plasmid (C) encoded for luciferase polypeptide (61 KDa). Panel B: Half-lives of wild-type TbetaRI and DM1. Cells were transfected with a plasmid encoding for wild-type TbetaRI (WT) or the DM1 variant. After 24 h transfection, the transfectants were treated with 50 mug/mL cycloheximide (CHX) for the designed time courses, as indicated at the top. WT (15 mug) and DM1 (150 mug) transfectant lysates were analyzed by Western blotting using an anti-HA antibody. Panel C & D: Protein stability of DM1 and DM2 associated with proteosome-related degradation. Transfectants were treated simultaneously with CHX and 5 muM, 20 muM MG132, or DMSO (vehicle control) for 30 min in Panel C. Transfectants treated with CHX and 20 muM MG132 or 10 muM lactacystin (Lata) for 60 min were shown in Panel D. Protein levels were determined by Western blotting of WT, DM1, and DM2 transfectant lysates using an anti-HA antibody. The same blot was reprobed with beta-actin antibody as a control.

To examine the possibility that a lack of the peptide encoded by nucleotides 16-75 would affect the turnover rate of the DM1 protein, its half-life and stability were examined. The DM1 gene was transfected into HEK 293 cells followed by blocking translation machinery with cycloheximide (CHX). The half-life of the DM1 protein (about 30 min) was much shorter than that of the wild-type protein (90 min) (Fig. 5B). These data are in agreement with a previous report using pulse-chase metabolic labeling [5]. Co-treatment with an ubiquitin-proteasome inhibitor, MG132, and cycloheximide rescued the DM1 protein from degradation (Fig. 5C and 5D). The same conclusion was obtained from an experiment using the DS1 variant as a target protein (data not shown). However, this effect was not seen in the experiment using a 20S proteasome inhibitor, lactacystin (Fig. 5D), indicating that degradation of the DM1 and DS1 proteins is through an ubiquitin-dependent process. Thus, the data clearly indicate that the peptide encoded by nucleotides 16-51 is a key element involved in TbetaRI protein stability.

To test function of these naturally occurring TbetaRI variants on TGFbeta-mediated signaling, receptor-mediated transcriptional activation was examined by a reporter gene assay. The p3TP-Lux reporter containing a TPA-responsive element and PAI-1 promoter was co-transfected with individual variant genes into the TbetaRI-null cell line, R1B. In response to TGFbeta stimulation, receptor-mediated transcriptional activation was determined from the corresponding luciferase activity. Compared with transcriptional activation mediated by wild-type TbetaRI after protein normalization, truncation of a peptide encoded by nucleotides 16-51 for the DS1 mutant did not affect its receptor function (Fig. 6A). Similar results were also seen in the DM1 and DM2 mutants with deletion of this peptide. In contrast, truncation of a peptide C-terminal to the 9A stretch (DS3) dramatically impaired its capability to conduct TGFbeta signaling. A consistent result was also observed in the DM3 and DM4 variants lacking this peptide. Thus, these data suggest that at least two functional subdomains are located on the putative signal peptide for TbetaRI to control its protein expression and downstream signaling.

R1B cells were transiently transfected with 1 mug of either wild-type (WT) TbetaRI or truncated variants, as indicated in the bottom, 1 mug of p3TP-Lux, and 0.05 mug of pRL-TK plasmid which was used to correct the differences in transfection efficiency between experiments. After transfection for 24 h, the cells were treated with TGFbeta1 (5 ng/mL) for 24 h and luciferase activities in each lysates were determined using a dual-luciferase reporter assay system (Promega). Data are the mean +/- SEM luciferase activities of four independent experiments normalized to individual protein level. Panel B. Effects of TbetaRI variants on TGFbeta-induced cell growth.

To examine if transcriptional activation induced by these variants might affect cellular function, R1B cells were transfected with individual variant genes and their growths were measured using a standard MTT assay. In the presence of TGFbeta, the DM1, DM2, and DS1 variants significantly suppressed the growth of R1B cells although their protein expression levels were much lower than that of the wild-type one (Fig. 6B). This data strongly suggests that the expression levels are sufficient to transduct the extracellular TGFbeta signal, activate gene transcription, and exert biological action in R1B cells. In contrast, lack of a peptide C-terminal to the 9A stretch in DM3, DM4, and DS3 almost abrogated their signaling capability, indicating that they are non-functional receptors.

To test if the coexistence of these variants might alter the cellular function of TGFbeta-sensitive cells, MCF-7 stable transfectants expressing individual TbetaRI variants were established and cell growth was determined by MTT assay. To eliminate possible artifacts associated with individual cell clones, mixed transfectants were used. No measurable difference on cell growth was observed among them in the absence of TGFbeta. However, the DM3 variant, surprisingly, rescued 44.2% of growth suppression induced by TGFbeta, but only partial prevention was seen in the cells expressing DM4 (Fig. 7A). The action of DM3 is, at least partially, attributed to the abolishment of TGFbeta-induced apoptotic event (Fig. 7B). On the other hand, as expected for DM1 and DM2, expression of either variant only produced a slight difference from the control in the presence of TGFbeta. This may result from two possibilities. First, MCF-7 cells have endogenous TGFbeta receptors and intact downstream signaling pathways to respond to TGFbeta stimulation. Increasing expression of exogenous signaling molecule(s) is not always proportional to enhance the signaling magnitude or biological outcomes [12,14]. Second, it might be caused by saturated signaling capacity in the cells. Furthermore, the expression level of DM1 or DM2 is quite low and probably barely affects endogenous signaling in TGFbeta-responsive MCF-7 cells. In summary, these results suggest that the existence of some TbetaRI variants in cancer cells can bestow them with a growth advantage in a tumor microenvironment such as that in malignant pleural effusions with high levels of TGFbeta.

The type I receptor of TGFbeta (TbetaRI) has a central role to transmit TGFbeta stimulation into the nucleus by activating its downstream Smad- and non-Smad-mediated pathways and modulating gene transcriptions to conduct its biological effects in cells [15,16]. Functional disruption, mutation, or aberrant expression of the Tgfbr1 gene could cause many human diseases, including cancers [3-6]. In the present study, we identified two additional functional elements in the signal peptide of TbetaRI beside published mutations in the 9A stretch. Sequence loss or deletion of a 12-residue peptide upstream to the 9A stretch, which is encoded by nucleotides 16-51, showed a dramatic impairment of TbetaRI expression because of its labile protein stability. On the other hand, a 13-residue peptide immediately downstream to the stretch is apparently involved in receptor-mediated signaling activation. In contrast, removal of the 9A stretch itself had only a mild effect on the protein expression and function of TbetaRI. Intriguingly, Pasche et al. recently reported that deletion of three alanine residues in the stretch conferred certain advantages for tumor growth and was associated with the malignancy of colorectal cancer [13]. Our study also demonstrated that the presence of the DM3 variant could counteract TGFbeta action. These findings disclose an unexpected additional complexity in the response of tumor cells to TGFbeta-mediated growth regulation.

In contrast to previously reported TbetaRI variants, the four newly discovered truncated forms defined in this study are apparently not caused by somatic mutations. Germ-line predisposing or cancer-associated somatically acquired mutations are usually considered the major cause for malfunction of the Tgfbr1 gene. Those mutations are composed of nucleotide transversion, insertion, and deletion mutations. Around 30% of patients with ovarian cancer bear a dinucleotide insertion in exon 5 of the Tgfbr1 gene [9]. Another tumor-susceptible allele is Tgfbr1-6A. A meta-analysis of 12 case-control studies by Pasche et al. [4] indicates that Tgfbr1-6A carriers have an increased risk of colon, breast, and ovarian cancers compared with non-carriers. In addition, there was a much higher frequency of this allele found in colorectal tumor tissue than in germ-line DNA extracted from the same patients [13], suggesting that acquisition of Tgfbr1-6A allele may be contributed by cancer-associated somatic deletions. However, this clinical correlation between the frequency of this allele and increased cancer risk is quite controversial since other studies did not reach the same conclusion [17-19]. One possible interpretation for this is that Tgfbr1-6A is also a common polymorphism in healthy individuals (11.2% to 19.7%) [11]. Hence, the frequency between cancer patients and controls is not distinctly different. A meta-analysis of case-control studies for heterogeneity from different groups may be marginally significant. Intriguingly, neither our laboratory nor others [20] have found this mutant allele in patients with lung cancer. Hence, acquisition of lung cancer-associated mutations to TbetaRI may be through post-transcriptional processes rather than because of sequence defects in its genomic DNA. One plausible mechanism for this is RNA editing, as several mammalian tumor-associated transcript mutants can be generated through this process [21-23].

RNA editing is a widespread phenomenon in eukaryotes and it involves insertions, deletions, or nucleotide conversion leading to post-transcriptional base changes in mRNA and tRNA [24]. This cellular process is also observed in mammalian transcripts and some of them are associated with tumorigenesis such as in the glutamate receptor [21], Ptpn6 [22], and Wt-1 [23]. Consistent with our finding, Choi [10] also reported an insertion of four or five amino acid residues in the carboxyl terminus of extracellular domain of naturally occurring rat Alk-5 (Tgfbr1) transcripts. This finding further strengthens our hypothesis that cancer cells may modulate their sensitivity to TGFbeta by generation of its receptor variants through a post-transcriptional process and interfere with endogenous existing signaling. At least, DM3 in this study may be such a case.

Sequence deletions in the Tgfbr1 transcripts are not merely through a single biological process. In addition to the truncations in the signal peptide, the deletion of nucleotides 344-574 in the sequence for DM3 and nucleotides 97-972 in that for DM4 are consequences of major alternative gene splicing. Alignment of the published human Tgfbr1 gene sequence [25] with the nucleotide sequences encoding these two variants revealed that the deletions occur precisely between exons 2 and 4 for DM3 and between exons 1 and 6 for DM4. Hence, generation of these transcript variants is probably involved in at least two post-transcriptional processes: alternative RNA splicing or RNA editing or even a yet undefined biological process.

Regulation of protein degradation requires accurate identification. Frequently, a small region of protein sequence provides information that targets the protein for degradation such as the degradation motif of IkappaB [26], the stability-regulating region of MOS [27], and the N-terminal residues of some proteins [28,29]. The action for the degradation is either mediated by ubiquitin-dependent [30] or -independent [31] proteolytic pathways. Removal of the 12-residue peptide upstream to the 9A stretch in the DM1, DM2, and DS1 variants greatly shortened their protein half-lives (Fig. 5). Treatment with MG132, an ubiquitin-proteasome inhibitor, but not of lactacystin, a highly specific inhibitor of the 20S proteasome, rescued them from degradation. Therefore, this 12-residue peptide might have an indispensable role in the protection of TbetaRI against ubiquitin-dependent protein degradation. The protective role played by this peptide is probably to target a newly synthesized polypeptide of TbetaRI onto the endoplasmic reticulum membrane and prevents it from prolonged exposure to cytoplasmic proteolytic machinery. However, this is not the case for TGFBR1-6A. Pasche et al. [13] showed that the removal of three alanine residues from the 9A stretch did not measurably affect its membrane targeting. Thus, the essential role of the 12-residue peptide for membrane targeting of TbetaRI variants needs to be clarified.

Additionally, a region C-terminal to the 9A stretch in the signal peptide, ranging from residue 27 to residue 39, has a tremendous effect on TbetaRI-mediated transcriptional activation. Lack of this region in the DM3, DM4, and DS3 variants showed no dramatic difference from the wild-type one in their protein expression, but all failed to conduct TGFbeta signaling (Fig. 6). This result clearly indicates the critical role of this region for the function of TbetaRI. Based on amino terminal sequencing in a previous report [13] or using a SignaIP program [32], the data indicate that the major cleavage site of the putative signal peptide is located between residues 33 and 34. Hence, loss of the cleavage site could be a potential factor accounting for DS3's refractoriness to TGFbeta. One plausible speculation is that the signal peptides un-cleaved from these variants, and in turn, interfere with their ability to bind with ligand. However, there might be other residues in this region critical for the receptor function.

The co-existence of TbetaRI variants might confer survival benefits to tumor cells. This hypothesis is supported by our present data, showing that the expression of DM3 enabled MCF-7 cells to resist TGFbeta-induced growth inhibition markedly. A similar observation was also reported in the TGFBR1-6A variant [13]. However, in contrast to this variant, the DM3 protein not only loses the truncated region of DS3, but also lacks the transmembrane domain, juxtamembrane region, and GS motif. In our gene reporter and cell proliferation assays in R1B cells (Fig. 6), those data further confirm that DM3 is a non-functional receptor and mainly localized in the cytosol. One previous study by Saitoh et al. [33] showed that a deletion mutant lacking its juxtamembrane region could be still associated with TbetaRII and transduce TGFbeta signaling. Therefore, we speculate that this DM3 variant can modulate TGFbeta-mediated signaling activation by competing with endogenous wild-type TbetaRI in the cells for association with the type II receptor and thereby blocking some downstream signaling pathways. This working hypothesis is currently supported by our unpublished data, showing that DM3 could significantly abolish TGFbeta-induced JNK activation and have a potential role in tumorigenesis. However, another possibility that secondary signals generated by this variant may directly deregulate the TGFbeta-induced cell apoptosis should also not be ruled out since it still contains an intact serine/threonine kinase domain. Compared to DM3, DM4 loses several kinase subdomains, particularly for subdomains III-V, which have been shown to include a key region for the transduction of TGFbeta signaling [34]. The expression of this variant could also rescue TGFbeta-induced growth suppression in a cell although the magnitude of the blocking effect was much weaker than that of DM3. If the molecular mechanism mediated by DM4 is the same as by DM3 remains to be elucidated.

Although the involvement of TGFBR1-6A and our newly discovered variants in tumorigenesis has not been substantially validated in vitro or in vivo studies, this implication seems to be supported by published data from several clinical studies. Thus, Chen et al. [8] performed genotyping for the Tgfbr1 gene in 34 patients with ovarian cancer. The data showed that 7 out of 34 (21%) patients had either deleted or point mutations in the truncated regions of DM3 or DM4. Wang, et al. [9] found that around 31.3% of ovarian cancer patients had a 2-nucleotide insertion at codons 276-277 (nucleotides 825-831), also located in this region. Thus, these findings suggest that mutations in Tgfbr1 are likely responsible for human ovarian carcinogenesis. However, the evidence from our and Zhang's [20] laboratories obviously indicate that mutations of Tgfbr1 probably do not result from defects in its DNA level. Hence, for association of Tgfbr1 mutations with lung cancer, a large-scale case-control study on mutations of its transcript is required to test any correlation between the frequency of mutated transcripts and their potential to cause malignancy.

Loss of functional TbetaRI resulting in insensitivity to TGFbeta is frequently associated with tumor malignancy [35,36]. The disclosure of these two hitherto undiscovered regions on the signal peptide of TbetaRI in this study adds pivotal knowledge to the molecular understanding of its protein expression and receptor function and provides an alternative molecular target for monitoring disease progression. First, these data demonstrate that a small deletion in the putative signal peptide of TbetaRI is a common feature for the pleural effusion-derived tumor cells we have examined so far, but this is not found in normal control cells. Second, the serial site-directed deletion mutagenesis resolved an indispensable role for TbetaRI protein stability of the 12-residue peptide upstream to the 9A stretch of the signal peptide. Deletion of a 13-residue peptide downstream to the 9A sequence produced serious impairment to receptor-mediated transcriptional activation. Third, study of the effects of these naturally occurring variants on cell growth has provided a plausible interpretation for how effusion tumor cells can survive in a microenvironment enriched with TGFbeta. Finally, these observations indicate that a small sequence deletion in the signal peptide can cause distinct consequences for TbetaRI protein expression or receptor function and suggest that DM3 might act as an oncogene, regulating TGFbeta-induced pathways that may be amenable to therapeutic intervention.

Total RNA from WI38 cells, human umbilical endothelial cells (HUVECs), and effusion-derived tumor cells was extracted using the High Pure RNA Tissue kit (Roche Diagnostics, Indianapolis, IN) and reverse-transcribed using SuperScript III reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) as described in the manufacturer's instructions. Subsequently, nested-PCR reactions were performed to clone a Tgfbr1 coding sequence containing AUG start and UAA stop codons using two pairs of gene-specific primers, P1 and P2 (Fig. 1C), located in the 5' - and 3' -untranslated regions of the Tgfbr1 gene (NCBI database: NM_004612). To facilitate gene amplification of the highly GC-rich TbetaRI sequences, Advantage-GC polymerase (Clontech Co., Mountain View, CA) was used according to the manufacturer's instructions. Subsequently, PCR products were cloned into pIVEX2.5 (Roche) to generate C-terminus HA-tagged wild-type TbetaRI and its variants. Subsequently, the gene inserts were subcloned into the pcDNA3.1 vector (Invitrogen) at the 5' -Hind III and 3' -Apa I sites to improve protein expression in HEK 293 cells.

HA-tagged TbetaRI variants and beta-Actin were analyzed by Western blotting. HEK 293 or R1B cells were transiently transfected with each gene construct using Lipofectamine (Invitrogen) or ExGene500 (Fermantas, Hanover, MD), respectively. For increasing protein expression, transfected R1B cells were infected with T7 vaccinia viruses as described previously [40]. The transfectants were lysed 24 h after the transfection in a lysis buffer [10 mM Na2HPO4, 150 mM NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 10 mM NaF] supplemented with 1 x protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche Diagnostics). Approximately 15 or 150 mug of the lysates were resolved by electrophoresis in 10% or 15% SDS-containing polyacrylamide gels, as indicated in the figure legends. The proteins were blotted onto nitrocellulose transfer membranes (Schleicher & Schuell, Keene, NH) and probed with anti-HA-tag (Covance, Berkeley, CA), or anti-beta-Actin (Sigma, St. Louis, MO) antibodies.
