The location of the Escherichia coli RNase P cleavage site was studied both in vitro and in vivo. We show that selection of the cleavage site is dependent on the nucleotide at the cleavage site and the length of the acceptor-stem. Within the acceptor-stem the number of nucleotides on the 5'-half of the acceptor-stem appears to be the important determinant, rather than the number of base pairs in the acceptor-stem. We also demonstrate that the length of the T-stem and a G to C substitution at position 57 in the tRNA(Tyr)Su3 precursor influence the location of the cleavage site under certain conditions. With respect to the function of the subunits of RNase P our data suggest that the nucleotide at position 333 in M1 RNA, and the C5 protein, are important for the identification of the cleavage site.
