An important model system for studying the process leading to productive transcription is provided by the superfamily of nuclear receptors, which are for the most part ligand-controlled transcription factors. Over the past years several 'orphan' nuclear receptors have been isolated for which no ligand has yet been identified. Very little is known about how these 'orphan' receptors regulate transcription. In this study we have analysed the biochemical and transcriptional properties of the neuronally expressed orphan nuclear receptor RORbeta (NR1F2) and compared them with the retinoic acid receptor heterodimer RXRalpha-RARalpha (NR2B1-NR1B1) and Gal-VP16 in vitro. Although RORbeta binds to its DNA-binding sites with comparatively low affinity, it efficiently directs transcription in nuclear extracts derived from a neuronal cell line, Neuro2A, but not in nuclear extracts from non-neuronal HeLa cells. In contrast, RXRalpha-RARalpha and the acidic transcription factor Gal-VP16 support transcription in Neuro2A and HeLa nuclear extracts equally efficiently. These observations point to a different (co)factor requirement for transactivation by members of the NR1 subfamily of nuclear receptors.

INTRODUCTION

The spatio-temporal regulation of gene expression is one of the key issues in differentiation and development. A central role in the control of gene expression is played by transcription factors that bind to specific enhancer/promoter elements and activate or repress transcription of a specific gene. The complex mechanism of transcriptional activation permits tight control at multiple levels, such as binding of the transcription factor to its response element, recruitment of co-activator/co-repressor complexes and the basal transcription machinery and facilitating reinitiation of transcription.

 Among many model systems the nuclear receptors of the thyroid/steroid superfamily have been of particular importance in the continuing dissection of the mechanisms responsible for control of transcription. The nuclear receptor superfamily now comprises more than 50 distinct members which have been grouped into six different subfamilies based on sequence similarities in the two well-conserved regions of this family, the DNA-binding and the ligand-binding domains (1).

 The 'classical' nuclear receptor acts as a ligand-controlled transcription factor which responds either to steroid hormones, small lipophilic molecules or vitamins. The last few years have witnessed major breakthroughs in understanding the molecular mechanisms of transcription signal transmission by these receptors (for reviews see 2,3 and references therein). In addition to these 'classical' receptors, a rather large number of proteins have been identified that share the overall protein structure of nuclear receptor family members but for which no ligand has (yet) been found. These receptors are commonly referred to as 'orphan' receptors (4).

 Some orphan receptors have DNA-binding and dimerisation properties very similar to those of 'classical' receptors, including their ability to bind as homodimers or RXR heterodimers to half-sites arranged either as a palindrome or direct repeats. However, a subgroup of orphan receptors exists that bind as monomers to so-called extended half-sites. Nucleotides 5' of the conserved receptor half-site (AGGTCA) are contacted by these orphan receptors increasing DNA binding affinity and providing specificity in the recognition of monomeric response elements (5). An intriguing question is how the transcriptional activity of orphan receptors is regulated in the absence of a ligand and of a heterodimerisation partner. It is possible that the transcriptional activity of orphan receptors is controlled by protein modifications. Alternatively, these receptors may display a constitutive ability to bind either co-repressor or co-activator complexes.

 A good model system for studying transcriptional control by orphan receptors that bind to DNA as monomers is the subgroup of the ROR (NR1F) (also referred to as RZR) and the Rev-erb (NR1D) receptors. In transient transfections members of the ROR subgroup appear to act as constitutive activators, whereas members of the Rev-erb subgroup act as constitutive repressors.

 Two members of the ROR subgroup, RORalpha (NR1F1) (6,7) and RORbeta (NR1F2) (8), are highly related but display very different expression patterns. While RORalpha is ubiquitously expressed, RORbeta expression is restricted to neuronal cells, in particular to areas in the central nervous system that are involved in the processing of sensory information (spinal cord, thalamus and sensory cerebellar cortices) and the major areas of circadian rhythm regulation (retina, pineal gland and suprachiasmatic nuclei) (9). Despite the high degree of amino acid similarity, we recently demonstrated that these two receptors display different DNA-binding behaviors (10), suggesting that specific transcriptional regulation mechanisms may be in place for these transcription factors.

 To unravel the mechanism underlying regulation of transcription by monomeric binding orphan receptors, we expressed RORbeta using the vaccinia virus system and compared its DNA-binding and transcriptional properties with those of the RXRalpha-RARalpha (NR2B1-NR1B1) heterodimer and the synthetic acidic activator Gal-VP16 in vitro. In this report we show that although RORbeta has a weak affinity for its response elements compared with the RXRalpha-RARalpha heterodimer, it potently drives transcription in Neuro2A but not in HeLa nuclear extracts. RXRalpha-RARalpha and Gal-VP16 are able to efficiently activate transcription in both Neuro2A and HeLa nuclear extracts.

For the preparation of 32P-labelled oligonucleotides, two complementary single-stranded oligos were annealed and incubated with [gamma-32P]dATP and T4 polynucleotide kinase (BioLabs). Electromobility shift assays were performed as previously described (10). Off-rate experiments were performed by adding a 500-fold molar excess of specific oligonucleotides to the preformed protein-DNA complexes. Complexes formed during the band shift reactions were separated on pre-cooled, pre-run (1 h, 200 V) 4% polyacrylamide gels containing 0.25x TBE at 4degreesC and 200 V.

Aliquots of 10 ml packed cell volume (PCV) of HeLa cells and 3 ml PCV of Neuro2A cells were used to prepare crude nuclear extracts (17). The nuclear extracts had a final KCl concentration of 400 mM. A typical nuclear extract preparation had a protein concentration of 5-8 mg/ml. Transcription reactions were performed as described (10). The final KCl concentration in the transcription buffer for RXRalpha-His6-RARalpha and Gal-VP16 transcription were set to 80 mM, for RORbeta transcription to 50 mM. Aliquots of 4-8 microg crude nuclear extract preparations were used per reaction. A typical transcription reaction was performed by preincubating the samples for 40 min at 30degreesC in the absence of nucleotides. After addition of nucleotides the procedure was followed for up to 60 min reaction time. Single round transcription experiments were performed by adding Sarkosyl to a final concentration of 0.05% 30 s after nucleotide addition.

To assess the transcriptional properties of RORbeta, a histidine-tagged fusion protein, His6-RORbeta, was expressed in HeLa cells using the vaccinia virus expression system and purified over a Ni2+-NTA column. The SDS-PAGE polypeptide pattern of a typical His6-RORbeta preparation revealed a polypeptide of approximately50 kDa which was not present in preparations from HeLa cells infected with wild-type vaccinia virus (Fig. 1A and data not shown). Western blot analysis using a polyclonal antiserum raised against RORbeta identified the 50 kDa polypeptide as RORbeta (Fig. 1B). Apart from RORbeta, other poly(His)-containing polypeptides present in vaccinia-infected as well as in non-infected HeLa cells bind to Ni2+-NTA (Fig. 1A, lanes 2-5 and data not shown). The purity of His6-RORbeta was estimated to be 5-10%.

Since DNA binding of a transcription factor is a prerequisite for transcriptional activation, the DNA-binding properties of His6-RORbeta were analysed in electrophoretic mobility shift assays. Several oligonucleotides were used containing either a single or two consensus half-sites (AGGTCA) in a direct or palindromic configuration (Fig. 2A). Because DNA binding of RORalpha and RORbeta reportedly depends on sequences 5' of the consensus half-site (7,8,18), the ROR-responsive element (RORE) used throughout the experiments contained a thymine at position -1 and an adenine at position -4 preceeding the nuclear receptor half-site. His6-RORbeta readily bound as a monomer to a single half-site (RE1) (Fig. 2B, left). Two complexes were obtained on POP, a binding site containing two half-sites in a palindromic configuration (Fig. 2B, middle). In agreement with published results (8,19), two distinct complexes were also detected using response elements consisting of two half-sites arranged as direct repeats with 7 or 8 spacing nucleotides (DR+7 and DR+8; data not shown). Both protein-DNA complexes were supershifted with a RORbeta-specific antiserum, whereas the preimmune serum did not alter the mobility of the complexes (Fig. 2C). Binding of His6-RORbeta to TREpal, containing two palindromically arranged consensus binding sites without appropriate 5'-extensions, was very inefficient; a weak protein-DNA complex migrating at the position of a monomer was obtained only at high receptor concentrations (Fig. 2B, right).

 Next, the relative affinity of His6-RORbeta for the RORE was assessed. For this purpose, off-rate experiments were performed and compared with those of the related RXRalpha-His6-RARalpha heterodimer (Fig. 2D). In these assays vaccinia-expressed receptors were preincubated with labelled oligonucleotide probes to allow formation of protein-DNA complexes. Dissociation of the pre-formed protein-DNA complexes was measured as a function of time by loading aliquots onto a continuously running acrylamide gel at 0, 1, 4 and 16 min after addition of a 500-fold molar excess of specific cold competitor. While the RXRalpha-His6-RARalpha heterodimer complex bound to the RAREbeta2 element was not or only marginally affected by addition of excess competitor (Fig. 2D, right; 20), His6-RORbeta-DNA complexes formed on the POP element dissociated rapidly after addition of competitor (Fig. 2D, left). Similar results were obtained using other ROREs (RE1, DR+8 and DR+7) (data not shown).

 Taken together, these data show that His6-RORbeta can bind to elements that contain either one or two extended binding sites. However, His6-RORbeta has a low affinity for the response elements tested compared with the affinity of the related nuclear receptor heterodimer RXRalpha-His6-RARalpha for RAREbeta2.

To assess the transcriptional activity of His6-RORbeta, we established an in vitro transcription system similar to that described for the RXRalpha-His6-RARalpha heterodimer (10,11). The reporter construct contained a RORE in front of the TATA box of the tk promoter fused to a G-less cassette of 380 nt (Fig. 3A). A template with the adenovirus major late TATA box initiator fused to a G-less cassette of 320 nt (TI) served as an internal control, monitoring the basal transcriptional activity of the extracts. Since RORbeta is expressed predominantly in neuronal tissues, nuclear extracts from the neuroblastoma cell line Neuro2A were used in initial experiments as a source of basal transcription factors and putative cofactors. For quantitative analysis, transcription levels were measured using a Phosphorimager.

 His6-RORbeta preparations boosted the level of transcription up to 30-fold from the palindromic POP element-containing template in a concentration-dependent manner, whereas the levels of transcription from the internal control were not or only marginally affected (Fig. 3B, lanes 1-4; Fig. 3C, lanes 1 and 2; Fig 3D, lanes 1-4). The increase in levels of transcription is specific for His6-RORbeta because control extracts derived from wild-type vaccinia virus-infected cells did not boost the level of transcription from the specific reporters (Fig. 3B, lanes 5-7). Furthermore, His6-RORbeta-dependent transcription was very low to undetectable when a reporter was used containing the TREpal element that did not support binding of RORbeta (Fig. 2B right and Fig. 3B, lanes 8-10). Maximal transactivation by His6-RORbeta was observed with a template containing four extended binding sites (4RE1) (Fig. 3C and data not shown). Taken together, the ability of His6-RORbeta to bind to the ROREs correlates with its ability to mediate transcription through these elements.

 Next, we wanted to compare the transcriptional activities of RORbeta and RXRalpha-RARalpha. We previously showed that RXRalpha-His6-RARalpha is a transcriptional activator in HeLa nuclear extracts when a transcription template was used that contained a fragment of the RARbeta2 promoter with two natural DR5 elements (RAREbeta2) (11). Therefore, in vitro transcription reactions were performed with His6-RORbeta and RXRalpha-His6-RARalpha in Neuro2A and HeLa nuclear extracts.

 RXRalpha-His6-RARalpha strongly boosted transcription from the RARbeta2 promoter-containing template in the neuronal extracts (Fig. 3C, lanes 7 and 8). In addition, RXRalpha-His6-RARalpha activated transcription very efficiently from a template containing a TREpal binding site in front of the minimal tk promoter, which is identical to the POP-tk reporter except for the 4 bp flanking the palindromic element, the so-called 5'-extension (Fig. 3C, lanes 9 and 10). Loading the heterodimer with all-trans retinoic acid did not further enhance the level of transcription under the conditions used in these experiments (data not shown). The experiments revealed that RORbeta and RXR-RAR are comparably efficient in transcriptional activation in Neuro2A nuclear extracts in vitro.

 When the transcriptional activities of His6-RORbeta and RXRalpha-His6-RARalpha were compared in HeLa nuclear extracts, only few transcripts instigated by His6-RORbeta could be detected using templates containing the POP binding site (Fig 3D, lanes 5-8). RORbeta was also unable to activate transcription efficiently from templates containing two extended binding sites arranged as direct repeats (DR+7 and DR+8) or four extended binding sites (4RE1) (data not shown). In contrast, RXRalpha-His6-RARalpha activated transcription very efficiently from RARbeta2 (Fig. 3D, lanes 9 and 10), as well as from the TREpal template (Fig. 3D, lanes 11 and 12), indicating that the HeLa nuclear extracts were capable of supporting activated transcription.

 The formation of functional PICs can be measured by single round transcription assays (21). One commonly used method to restrict transcription to a single round in vitro is addition of the anionic detergent Sarkosyl shortly after transcription reactions have been started by addition of nucleotides. Addition of a defined concentration of Sarkosyl prevents PIC assembly as well as formation of the first phosphodiester bonds, but not elongation of an initiated transcript (22). To define the optimal conditions in our experimental set-up (schematic presentation in Fig. 4A), the transcriptional activity of RORbeta was analysed at different Sarkosyl concentrations. Addition of Sarkosyl to a final concentration of up to 0.025% during PIC assembly (a) or to a final concentration of up to 0.05% prior to formation of the first phosphodiester bonds (b) prevented transcription (Fig. 4B, lanes 1, 2, 7, 8, 13 and 14, and 3, 4, 9, 10, 15 and 16, respectively), indicating that these processes cannot take place under these conditions. Addition of 0.05% (final concentration) Sarkosyl 30 s after addition of nucleotides (c), i.e. after the formation of the first phosphodiester bonds, resulted in a low but appreciable level of transcription, consistent with only one round of transcription (Fig. 4B, lanes 17 and 18 and Fig. 4D). Addition of higher concentrations of Sarkosyl (0.08%) prevented transcription altogether (Fig. 4B, lanes 19-24). These results suggest that adding Sarkosyl to a final concentration of 0.05% immediately following addition of nucleotides limits transcription to a single round (single round condition). The underlying assumption of this interpretation is that formation of PICs is saturated after 40 min.

 To test this hypothesis, in vitro transcription reactions with RORbeta were preincubated under single round conditions for different time periods (Fig. 4C). In our experimental system 10-15 min preincubation was necessary to detect the first RORbeta-dependent transcripts. The level of transcription did not further increase after 40 min, indicating that saturation of PIC formation was reached.

 To assess the ability of RORbeta to support single round transcription in HeLa and Neuro2A nuclear extracts, in vitro transcription experiments under single and multiple round conditions were performed with RORbeta and RXRalpha-His6-RARalpha. Experiments with the unrelated transcription factor Gal-VP16 served as additional controls. In vitro transcription experiments with His6-RORbeta were performed with templates containing either the 4RE1 or the POP binding site. His6-RORbeta behaved in a similar fashion on both templates. In the experiments presented templates with the 4RE1 binding site were used. The transcriptional activity of RXRalpha-His6-RARalpha was analysed on templates containing a fragment of the RARbeta2 promoter. In single round assays only transcription from the specific template was examined to avoid competition between the templates. To ensure reproducibility of the experiments, every experiment was repeated several times; the experiments presented are typical examples.

 Figure 5 demonstrates that His6-RORbeta, RXRalpha-His6-RARalpha and Gal-VP16 were able to support low but consistent single round transcription in Neuro2A (Fig. 5A) and HeLa (Fig. 5B) nuclear extracts (lanes 4, 8 and 12, respectively). Thus all three proteins, including RORbeta, promoted preinitiation complex formation in Neuro2A and HeLa nuclear extracts.

 Next, we determined the ratio of transcripts under multiple and single round conditions [indicated in Figs 4-6 as the ratio (mr)/(sr)] for His6-RORbeta, RXRalpha-His6-RARalpha and Gal-VP16 in Neuro2A and HeLa nuclear extracts. In Neuro2A nuclear extracts, His6-RORbeta, RXRalpha-His6-RARalpha and Gal-VP16 (Fig. 5A, lanes 1-4, 5-8 and 9-12, respectively) efficiently instigated transcription under multiple round conditions. In HeLa nuclear extracts, however, efficient transactivation under multiple round conditions could be observed for RXRalpha-His6-RARalpha (Fig. 5B, lanes 5-8) and Gal-VP16 (Fig. 5B, lanes 9-12), but not for His6-RORbeta (Fig. 5B, lanes 1-4). The number of transcripts instigated by RORbeta in HeLa nuclear extracts under multiple to single round conditions was approximately equal.

 The observed difference in transcriptional behavior of His6-RORbeta and RXRalpha-His6-RARalpha may have been caused by the differential requirements of the basal promoter used in these experiments, i.e. the minimal tk versus the RARbeta2 promoter. To rule this out, the experiments were repeated for RXRalpha-His6-RARalpha using an artificial template that contained a TREpal binding site in front of the minimal tk promoter. RXRalpha-His6-RARalpha activated transcription efficiently from this template in Neuro2A as well as in HeLa nuclear extracts, indicating that the basal promoter composition of the templates did not influence the transcriptional behavior of the proteins (Fig. 5C). Taken together, these experiments suggest a different transcriptional behavior of the two nuclear receptors RORbeta and RXRalpha-RARalpha in HeLa nuclear extracts in vitro.

 The observation that His6-RORbeta instigated significantly more transcripts in Neuro2A as compared with HeLa nuclear extracts prompted us to assess the rate at which His6-RORbeta boosts formation of functional preinitiation complexes in Neuro2A and HeLa nuclear extracts. As already demonstrated in Figure 4C, the rate of PIC assembly can be measured by performing experiments under single round conditions at different preincubation times. In Neuro2A as well as HeLa nuclear extracts, transcripts were synthesised in the presence of RORbeta proportional to the time of preincubation (Fig. 6A). These experiments suggest that His6-RORbeta recruits PICs with equal efficiency in Neuro2A and HeLa nuclear extracts. Thus, the low amount of transcripts instigated by RORbeta in HeLa nuclear extracts is not due to an extract-dependent insufficiency in the formation of functional PICs.

 Next, we investigated the time required by His6-RORbeta, RXRalpha-His6-RARalpha and Gal-VP16 to synthesise the equivalent of a single round of transcription to assess the rate at which transcripts are synthesised in HeLa and Neuro2A nuclear extracts. In vitro transcription experiments were performed under multiple round conditions and stopped at different times after addition of nucleotides (reaction times). RORbeta-induced transcripts reached the equivalent of a single round transcription within 5 min after addition of nucleotides in Neuro2A (Fig. 6B, left) as well as in HeLa (Fig. 6B, right) nuclear extracts. This suggests that the rate of the synthesis of transcripts instigated by RORbeta does not differ significantly in Neuro2A and HeLa nuclear extracts. Similar results were obtained for RXRalpha-His6-RARalpha and Gal-VP16 (data not shown).

 Similar experiments were performed with longer reaction times to assess the transcriptional efficiency of the proteins in the extracts. In Neuro2A nuclear extracts His6-RORbeta-instigated transcription resulted in doubling of the amount of transcripts every approximately10-13 min, whereas no further increase in the number of transcripts could be observed in HeLa nuclear extracts (Fig. 6C). In contrast, RXRalpha-His6-RARalpha and Gal-VP16 continuously produced transcripts in Neuro2A as well as in HeLa nuclear extracts.

 Taken together, these experiments demonstrate that His6-RORbeta is equally efficient in supporting single round transcription in Neuro2A and HeLa nuclear extracts. However, in vitro the ability of RORbeta to instigate transcripts is impaired in HeLa nuclear extracts.

RORbeta is an orphan member of the nuclear receptor superfamily that belongs to subfamily 1, with T3R and RAR as the most prominent members (1). Notwithstanding the extensive amino acid similarity between these receptors, our study suggests that the mechanism of transcriptional activation mediated by RORbeta may differ from those of RAR and T3R. Firstly, RORbeta binds DNA as a monomer (8,10,19; this study), whereas T3R and RAR require heterodimerisation with RXR (20,23). In agreement with these results, RAR is transcriptionaly active in vivo and in vitro only as an RXR heterodimer, while RORbeta activates transcription as a monomer (10).

 In off-rate experiments the heterodimers RXRalpha-RARalpha and RXRalpha-T3Ralpha have high affinity for their cognate DNA-binding sites (20), whereas the affinity of RORbeta (this study) and RORalpha (24) for a single, as well as a double, extended half-site is comparatively weak. Although the artificial binding sites used in this study have been shown to be optimal for RORbeta DNA binding in vitro and for transcriptional activation in vivo (8,19), the existence of natural ROREs with high(er) affinities cannot be ruled out. Despite the different affinities for their cognate binding sites, RORbeta and RXRalpha-RARalpha are equally efficient in the recruitment of functional PICs to DNA. It is important to note that PIC formation is a rather slow process. Several studies have determined the half-time of complex recruitment (i.e. the preincubation time required to obtain 50% of the final amount of transcripts generated under single round conditions) to be between 8 and 20 min (25-27). Saturation of PIC formation has been shown to require, as in our study, up to approximately40 min (27).

 Comparing the number of transcripts instigated by RORbeta and RXRalpha-RARalpha under single versus multiple round transcription conditions (Fig. 5), we observed an insufficiency of HeLa nuclear extracts to support RORbeta-dependent in vitro transcription. Whereas in Neuro2A nuclear extracts transactivation by RORbeta resulted in continuous production of transcripts, in HeLa nuclear extracts the accumulation of transcripts ceased after 5 min. In contrast, RXRalpha-RARalpha and the unrelated transcription factor Gal-VP16 supported transcription in Neuro2A and HeLa nuclear extracts beyond the initial 5 min of incubation. This observation shows that HeLa nuclear extracts were in principle able to support efficient transactivation.

 There are several explanations as to why transcription mediated by RORbeta ceased after an initial short period of transcription in HeLa nuclear extracts. RORbeta, in comparison with RXRalpha-RARalpha and Gal-VP16, might depend more strongly on a general factor(s) that is required for subsequent rounds of transcription and is limited in HeLa nuclear extracts. Putative candidates could be factors required for promoter clearance, such as the general transcription factor TFIIH (28,29), or for elongation of subsequent transcription rounds, such as the elongation factor SII (30).

 Another intriguing possibility is that RORbeta facilitates cofactor-dependent reinitiation in Neuro2A but not in HeLa nuclear extracts. Several in vitro studies have shown that reinitiation of transcription is fast as compared to the slow first round of transcription. In the first round of transcription, a preinitiation complex has to be recruited to the promoter, which appears to be a very slow process in vitro. At some promoters a committed complex consisting of TFIID and other factors such as TFIIA, TFIIB, TFIIH, TFIIE and Mediator has been detected after the initial polymerase escape (29,31-34). Such a committed complex might act as a scaffold for rapid formation of subsequent reinitiation complexes. Whether the continued presence of an activator is required to stabilise such a complex is unclear (27,31,35) and may depend on the transcription factor and template (29). Several activators, such as the heat shock factor or estrogen receptor, have been shown to enhance not only PIC assembly but also the rate of reinitiation in cell-free systems (31,36). RORbeta might instigate transcription efficiently in Neuro2A but not in HeLa nuclear extracts due to the presence of an extract-specific factor(s) in Neuro2A nuclear extracts that facilitates RORbeta-dependent reinitiation of transcription. Such a factor might be a cell type-specific homologue of TBP, such as TRF (37), or a cell type-specific cofactor involved in reinitiation. Alternatively, the impaired ability of RORbeta to reinitiate transcription in HeLa nuclear extracts could be caused by the presence of an inhibitory factor in HeLa nuclear extracts that specifically blocks RORbeta-dependent reinitiation.

 The analysis of reinitiation mechanisms is difficult since it requires proof that initiation of the second and later rounds derive from the promoter already used in the first round of transcription, i.e. it has to be excluded that the transcripts synthesised at a later stage of incubation originate from previously untranscribed promoters. This is of particular importance since several studies have demonstrated that in cell-free transcription assays only a few per cent of the promoters are transcribed (21). The experiments shown in this study do not address the reinitiation mechanism and further experiments are necessary to analyse whether the transcripts produced in the first and subsequent rounds of transcription are derived from the same promoters.

 The presence of a cell type-specific transcription mechanism seems likely in the light of other studies. Transient transfection studies have shown that the ligand-binding domains of RORalpha (24) and RORbeta (19) display a neuronal-specific transcriptional activity when they are fused to a Gal4 DNA-binding domain. In addition, a neuronal-specific cofactor for RORbeta has recently been identified (38). This cofactor, called NIX1, does not activate but inhibits RORbeta-dependent transactivation when overexpressed in transient transfection assays.

 In summary, we have demonstrated that the orphan nuclear receptor RORbeta is a comparatively strong transcriptional activator in vitro when considering its low affinity for ROREs. RORbeta is as equally efficient as such strong DNA-binding factors as RXRalpha-RARalpha and Gal-VP16 in PIC stabilisation and continuous transcriptional activation in Neuro2A nuclear extracts. We further showed that RORbeta, in contrast to RXRalpha-RARalpha and Gal-VP16, cannot instigate continuous transcription in HeLa nuclear extracts. This observation suggests a different (co)factor requirement for transactivation by members of the NR1 subfamily of nuclear receptors. Fractionation and further characterisation of nuclear extracts needs to be pursued to gain insight into the mechanism of transactivation by the orphan receptor RORbeta.
