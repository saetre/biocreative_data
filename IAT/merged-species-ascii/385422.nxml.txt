There are a large number of uncharacterized cDNA clones that code for novel proteins with homology to known signaling molecules. We have identified a novel molecule from the HUGE database that is related to a previously known molecule, AMSH (associated molecule with the SH3 domain of STAM), an adapter shown to be involved in BMP signaling. Both of these molecules contain a coiled-coil domain located within the amino-terminus region and a JAB (Domain in Jun kinase activation domain binding protein and proteasomal subunits) domain at the carboxy-terminus. We show that this novel molecule, which we have designated AMSH-2, is widely expressed and its overexpression potentiates activation of TGF-beta-dependent promoters. Coimmunoprecipitation studies indicated that Smad7 and Smad2, but not Smad3 or 4, interact with AMSH-2. We show that overexpression of AMSH-2 decreases the inhibitory effect of Smad7 on TGF-beta signaling. Finally, we demonstrate that knocking down AMSH-2 expression by RNA interference decreases the activation of 3TP-lux reporter in response to TGF-beta.

This report implicates AMSH and AMSH-2 as a novel family of molecules that positively regulate the TGF-beta signaling pathway. Our results suggest that this effect could be partially explained by AMSH-2 mediated decrease of the action of Smad7 on TGF-beta signaling pathway.

TGF-beta ligands belong to a large and expanding family of multifunctional cytokines which include the activins, inhibins, bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs), growth/differentiation factors, Mullerian inhibiting substance and Nodal. Members of this family regulate a broad range of physiological processes, including organogenesis, proliferation, differentiation, adhesion, motility and apoptosis [1,2]. Mutations in downstream components of the TGF-beta signaling pathways have been implicated in several human diseases [3].

TGF-beta superfamily members signal through a receptor complex formed by the association of two transmembrane proteins designated I and II, each possessing serine/threonine kinase activity (for reviews see [1,4,5]). TGF-beta binding induces the assembly of the type I and type II receptors [6,7], thereby enabling the type II receptor to phosphorylate and activate the type I receptor [8,9]. Activated type I receptors then phosphorylate Smad2 and Smad3 receptor-regulated Smad proteins (R-Smads) at the carboxy terminal motif SSxS [10,11]. Phosphorylated R-Smads interact with Smad 4, the unique Co-Smad [11-13]. This complex accumulates in the nucleus where it regulates transcriptional activity of several genes in association with transcriptional activators and corepressors (for reviews see [14-17]).

The specific transcriptional outcome in response to TGF-beta is achieved by the interplay of intracellular regulators at different levels. Within the Smad family of proteins, Smad6 and 7 (I-Smads) negatively regulate TGF-beta signaling [18-20]. Smad6 also inhibits BMP signaling, while activin signaling is negatively regulated by Smad7 [21]. In addition to the Smad proteins, other regulatory molecules work as adapter and/or scaffolding proteins, such as SARA, that mediates the access of Smads to activated receptors [22]. Finally, the specific outcome of TGF-beta signaling is modulated by several other signaling pathways (for review see [15,23]).

The human unidentified gene-encoded large proteins database (HUGE) contains long cDNAs and is a valuable tool to discover new proteins, and to predict structural features with a possible functional relevance [24,25]. Through the analysis of the cDNA clones contained in this database, we have identified a novel protein that is highly similar to AMSH (associated molecule with the SH3 domain of STAM) [26]. Systematic analysis using specific reporters for several pathways showed that this novel molecule, designated AMSH-2, positively regulates TGF-beta signaling system but not the TNF signaling pathway.

We have adopted a systematic strategy to identify and characterize cDNAs encoding novel proteins containing domains that have a role in signal transduction pathways [27-29]. We have used the HUGE database as a primary public resource as it contains mostly uncharacterized full-length cDNAs. By analyzing the domain composition of the predicted proteins, we identified a cDNA [Genbank ] with an open reading frame of 461 amino acids (Figure 1A). The domain composition of the predicted protein was obtained by searching the SMART database [30] and revealed a coiled-coil domain spanning amino acids 149 to 176 in the N-terminus of the molecule and a JAB domain [31-33] (amino acids 268 to 394) located in the carboxy terminal region of the molecule (Figure 1B). A search of GenBank database revealed a similar molecule, AMSH, which had been identified on the basis of its ability to interact with STAM and showed a similar domain composition. Alignment of the novel protein against human AMSH revealed a 75% identity within the JAB domain, with an overall identity of 56% between the two molecules (Figure 1A). We have designated this novel protein AMSH-2 after its paralog AMSH. Upon searching the human genomic database, we found that AMSH-2 gene was located on 10q23.33. A detailed analysis of the genomic structure of the gene encoding for AMSH-2 revealed that the coding region spans 10 exons (Figure 1C). All the intron-exon boundaries followed the GT/AG rule for splice junctions [34].

In order to determine the tissue expression of AMSH-2, we probed a Northern blot containing poly A+ mRNA from several human tissues with a radiolabeled AMSH-2 probe. We found a single band of approximately 2.3 kb which was detected in almost all the tissues examined (Figure 2A, left panel). Probing a cancer cell line northern blot revealed a band of similar size in most of the cell lines, including HL60, Hela S3, Molt-4, Raji, SW480 and A549 (Figure 2A, right panel).

We found ESTs corresponding to AMSH-2 mRNA in brain, testes, bone, pancreas, fetal liver, kidney, colon, stomach, bone marrow, placenta, breast, pectoral muscle, hypothalamus, ovary as well as in a number of cell lines of different origins, including T cell leukemia, NT2 neuronal and B-cell CLL [35].

We raised an antibody against the carboxy terminus of AMSH-2 and measured the expression of AMSH-2 protein in different cell lines. For this purpose, HepG2 and 293T cells lines were metabolically labeled with 35S and cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with preimmune or anti-AMSH-2 antiserum. We observed a band with a molecular weight of approximately 56 kDa, which is in agreement with the predicted molecular weight of AMSH-2.

We next examined the effect of overexpression of AMSH-2 on a number of signaling pathways. Since AMSH-2 is expressed in HepG2 and 293T cells, we chose these cell lines for our assays. Given the similarity between AMSH-2 and AMSH, and the ability to AMSH to regulate BMP signaling, we hypothesized that AMSH-2 may affect signaling by TGF-beta. We first tested the effect of AMSH-2 overexpression on TGF-beta signaling pathway using p3TP-lux reporter plasmid which is a standard reporter to evaluate TGF-beta signaling [6]. This reporter construct contains the luciferase gene under the control three consecutive TPA response elements and a 96 bp fragment of the PAI-1 promoter that is regulated by TGF-beta and is also highly inducible in response to TGF-beta. Overexpression of AMSH-2 in HepG2 cells increased the level of luciferase activity driven by the 3TP promoter upon TGF-beta stimulation as compared to cells transfected with vector alone (Figure 3A). As this promoter is derived from the Plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) promoter, we also tested the effect on PAI-1 luciferase activity [36]. When we cotransfected AMSH-2 into HepG2 cells together with this reporter, a similar increase in the luciferase levels was observed indicating that AMSH-2 is likely a positive regulator of TGF-beta signaling (Figure 3B).

A) Effect of AMSH-2 on TGF-beta induced transcriptional activity of 3TP driven luciferase. HepG2 cells were cotransfected with 3TP-lux reporter together with the empty vector or increasing amounts of AMSH-2 Myc construct. Twenty-four hours posttransfection, cells were serum-starved and left untreated (white bars) or stimulated (black bars) with 5 ng/ml TGF-beta1 for 16-20 h before the luciferase and beta-galactosidase activities were measured. B) Effect of AMSH-2 on TGF-beta induced transcriptional activity of PAI-1 luciferase. HepG2 cells were cotransfected with PAI-1 reporter together with the empty vector or 0.9 mug/ml of AMSH-2 Myc construct. A similar procedure as described in A was followed. C) AMSH-2 does not stimulate NF-kB signaling pathway. 293 cells were cotransfected with ELAM luciferase reporter construct together with an empty vector, 0.9 mug/ml of AMSH-2 Myc construct or 0.9 mug/ml of TRAF-2, used as a positive control. Forty-eight hours posttransfection, luciferase and beta-galactosidase activities were measured.

To account for possible non-specific effects, we tested the effect of AMSH-2 overexpression on the TNF signaling pathway. We used an ELAM-luciferase reporter construct as a reporter for activation of this pathway. This reporter contains the ELAM-1 promoter (-730 to +52) and is well known to be induced by TNF stimulation [37]. We therefore cotransfected 293 cells with ELAM-luciferase and either AMSH-2, empty vector or TRAF2, a prototypical member of the TRAF family of adapter proteins known to potentiate TNF signaling pathway [38-40]. We did not observe any increase in the luciferase levels in AMSH-2 transfected cells as compared with the empty vector, although overexpression of TRAF2 led to a significant upregulation of the promoter (Figure 3C). Taken together, these results imply that the AMSH-2 regulates TGF-beta signaling pathway.

The ability of AMSH-2 to regulate TGF-beta signaling could be explained by several mechanisms, including interaction with Smad2, Smad3, Smad4, or Smad7 [41]. To determine whether AMSH-2 interacts with these Smads, we coexpressed AMSH-2 with epitope tagged Smad constructs in 293T cells. As shown in Figure 4A, we observed an association between AMSH-2 and Smad7 but not with Smads 3 or 4 (Figure 4A). We also observed association between Smad2 and AMSH-2. These findings are similar to that observed for AMSH, since this molecule interacts strongly with Smad6 and 7; but differ in that AMSH does not with any R-Smads [41].

A) AMSH-2 interacts with Smad2 and Smad7, but not with Smad3 or Smad4. Vector or AMSH-2 V5 construct were coexpressed in 293T cells together with the Smad proteins as indicated on the top of the figure. Lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-V5 antibody and western blotted with anti-Flag or anti-HA antibodies. To control for Smad and AMSH-2 protein expression part of the lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-Flag, anti-HA or anti-V5 antibodies and western blotted with the same antibodies. B) Smad7 inhibitory effect on TGF-beta signaling pathway is rescued by AMSH-2. HepG2 cells were cotransfected with 3TP-lux reporter together with the empty vector or 10 ng/ml of Smad7 with or without 0.3 mug/ml of AMSH-2 Myc construct. Twenty-four hours posttransfection, cells were serum-starved and left untreated (white bars) or stimulated (black bars) with 5 ng/ml TGF-beta1 for 16-20 h before luciferase and beta-galactosidase activities were measured.

Because AMSH-2 interacts with Smad7, we also analyzed the effect of AMSH-2 on the ability of Smad7 to inhibit TGF-beta signaling in HepG2 cells. As expected, overexpression of Smad7 attenuated the induction of p3TP-luciferase activity by TGF-beta (Figure 4B). Interestingly, overexpression of AMSH-2 negated the inhibitory effect of Smad7 on p3TP expression stimulated by TGF-beta (Figure 4B). Therefore AMSH-2 can rescue the inhibitory effects of Smad7 on TGF-beta signaling pathway. Given the sequence similarity between AMSH and AMSH-2, it is indeed possible that AMSH-2 also interacts with Smad6. Smad6 has been shown to inhibit the TGF-beta pathway [42] and AMSH is able to rescue the inhibitory effect of Smad6 on BMP signaling pathway [41]. If AMSH-2 is able to interact with Smad6, the effect of AMSH-2 on TGF-beta signaling pathway could be explained by its interaction with both Smad7 and Smad6.

The use of small interfering RNAs (siRNA) has been proven a powerful tool to suppress the expression of specific proteins in mammalian cells [43,44]. We have shown that overexpression of AMSH-2 positively regulates TGF-beta-dependent transcriptional activation of 3TP-lux reporter. To assess the effect of depletion of endogenous AMSH-2, we designed a specific siRNA to silence AMSH-2. This siRNA was cotransfected in HepG2 cells and the effect on the transcriptional activity of the 3TP driven luciferase reporter was analyzed. As a positive control we used an siRNA targeted against Smad7. Cotransfection of siRNA specific for AMSH-2 cause a decrease in the luciferase activity upon stimulation with TGF-beta when compared with cells cotransfected with a commercially available randomly ordered RNA scrambled RNA. As expected, we observed an increase in luciferase activity in the cells transfected with a siRNA specific for Smad7 (Figure 5). These knock down experiments confirm that AMSH-2 positively regulates TGF-beta signaling pathway.

AMSH-2 RNA interference has a negative effect on TGF-beta signaling pathway. HepG2 cells were transfected with 3TP-lux reporter and scramble, laminA/C, AMSH-2 or Smad7 siRNA duplexes as indicated in the bottom of the graph. Forty-eight hours posttransfection cells were serum-starved and left treated (black bars) or not (white bars) with 5 ng/ml TGF-beta1.

Our results indicate that AMSH-2 is a positive regulator of TGF-beta signaling. This effect might be mediated through the interaction with the inhibitory Smad7 as AMSH-2 is capable of negating the inhibitory effects of Smad7 in TGF-beta signaling pathway. Further, use of siRNA to knock down the expression of AMSH-2 reduces signaling by TGF-beta. Similar to our studies, it has been suggested that AMSH might be involved in TGF-beta signaling. AMSH can interact with both I-Smads (i. e. Smads 6 and 7) and is a positive regulator of BMP signaling pathway [41]. The high degree of homology between these paralogs suggests that AMSH-2 might also interact with Smad6, and therefore might regulate BMP signaling. Although further research needs to be conducted to elucidate the exact mechanism of action of AMSH-2, it is clear that AMSH and AMSH-2 belong to a new family of molecules that positively regulate TGF-beta signaling pathway.

A human cDNA clone [Genbank ] was used as described [24,25]. To generate wild type AMSH-2 expression vector with a carboxy-terminal Myc epitope, we subcloned AMSH-2 open reading frame into the Nco I and Xho I sites of pEF/myc/cyto (Invitrogen, Carsbad, CA) by standard PCR procedures using the primers: AAAACCATGGATCAGCCTTTTACTGTGAATTC (5' primer) and AAACTCGAGCTGTTCAGATGGTGATGATGAC (3' primer). To generate AMSH-2 V5 carboxy-terminal-tagged expression vector, the open reading frame of AMSH-2 was subcloned into Nco I and Xho I sites of pEntr4 (Invitrogen) using the same 5' primer as described above and AAACTCGAGAGCTGTTCAGATGGTGATGATGACCTAG (3' primer), and transferred to pEF1/V5-HisB (Invitrogen), which has been previously made gateway compatible by inserting a cassette in the EcoRV site.
