Escherichia coli DNA was digested with restriction endonucleases BamHI, PstI, EcoRI, SalI, HindIII, XhoI, BglII, SmaI, HpaI and with selected double and triple combinations of the same enzymes. The digests were electrophoresed and hybridized with 32P-labelled ribosomal RNA by using the Southern blotting technique. The resulting bands could be arranged into seven groups, and it was possible to construct a unique physical map of the seven rRNA genes (operons) of the bacterial chromosome. Mapping information obtained on several transducing phages and recombinant plasmids carrying rRNA genes, and mapping data published in the literature helped to determine the final map. The results suggest that phage lambda daroE152 carries a "hybrid" rRNA gene which was probably formed by recombination between two different chromosomal rRNA genes.
