The overall frequencies of IL-1B-31 T, -511 T, +3954 T and IL-1RN VNTR alleles in patients with locally advanced gastric cancer were all comparable with those in controls. No significant differences were found in the distribution of IL-1B-31 T, -511 T and IL-1RN VNTR between patients with cachexia and without. Patients with cachexia showed a significantly higher prevalence of IL-1B+3954 T allele than those without (P = 0.018). In a logistic regression analysis adjusted for actual weight, carcinoma location and stage, the IL-1B+3954 CT genotype was associated with an odds ratio of 2.512 (95% CI, 1.180 - 5.347) for cachexia.

Cancer cachexia is a syndrome characterized by a marked weight loss, anorexia, asthenia and anaemia, accounting for at least 20% of deaths in neoplastic patients [1]. Unlike starvation, which depletes fat stores form adipose tissue while conserving protein from the wasting of skeletal muscle, in cachexia neither fat nor protein is spared. Progressive weight loss is a common feature of cancer and is responsible not only for a poor quality of life and poor response to chemotherapy, but also short survival time irrespective of tumor mass or the presence of metastases, and it also interferes with cancer therapy [2]. Although the mechanism of cancer cachexia remains largely unresolved, several key mediators have been identified. One set is proinflammatory cytokines [3], including TNF-alpha, IL-1beta, IL-6 and IFN-gamma [4,5]. In humans, there is increasing evidence that the host's cytokine response is genetically determined. Polymorphic gene sequences of certain cytokines could be potential markers of susceptibility and clinical outcome in different human infectious diseases. However, to the best of our knowledge, no study has addressed the correlation of cytokine polymorphisms of IL-1beta gene with the likelihood of cachexia from locally advanced gastric cancer.

IL-1beta is a potent proinflammatory cytokine released by macrophages in systemic inflammatory responses. It not only has important biologic effect but also regulates inflammatory reaction and immune response through promoting other cytokines expressions, such as IL-6 and IL-12. Studies have documented constitutive IL-1beta protein production in human and animal cancer cell lines including sarcomas and ovarian and transitional cell carcinomas. Solid tumors in which IL-1beta has been shown to be up regulated include breast, colon, lung, head and neck cancers, and melanomas, and patients with IL-1beta producing tumors have generally bad prognoses. It has also been reported that this cytokine was the factor responsible for enhanced protein degradation in rats, and repeated administration of IL-1 to rats induced anorexia and weight loss [6]. In vivo, the potentially injurious proinflammatory effects of IL-1beta are counterbalanced by the action of the interleukin-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1RN) [7]. Extensive evidence indicates that the biologic function of secreted IL-1RN is to competitively inhibit the binding of circulating IL-1beta to cell-surface receptors [8,9], and IL-1RN levels increase late during the course of an inflammatory event to terminate acute inflammation [7].

The production of IL-1beta and IL-1RN are depended on several factors, there is increasing evidence that the genetic factors plays an important role. The IL-1B and the IL-1RN genes are located on chromosome 2q14, within a 360 kb region. In the IL1B gene there are two diallelic polymorphisms at positions -511, -31 in the promoter region and at position + 3954 in the fifth exon. The IL-1RN gene has a penta-allelic polymorphic site in intron 2 containing variable numbers of an 86 bp tandem repeat sequence. In recent years, in vitro and in vivo studies have indicated that IL-1B -511 T and +3954 T alleles enhance IL-1beta and IL-1RN productions and the circulating levels of the two cytokines in humans [10,11]. It has been reported that proinflammatory genotypes of the interleukin-1 loci were associated with a significantly increased risk of a chronic hypochlorhydric response to H. pylori infection and gastric cancer in a Caucasian population, presumably by altering IL-1beta levels in the stomach [12,13], but an influence of IL-1beta gene polymorphisms on susceptibility of cachexia from gastric cancer has not been evaluated. In view of the roles of IL-1beta played in cachexia, we postulated that its polymorphisms might have some association with the development of cancer cachexia.

The causes of cachexia are thought to be multifactorial but primarily related to hypercatabolism and loss of appetite due to circulating tumor-related substances and cytokines [14,15]. Working from assumption of substantial inflammatory contribution to cancer cachexia, we hypothesized that IL-1B-31 T/C, -511 C/T, +3954 C/T and IL-1RN gene polymorphisms have some relationship with the development of cachexia associated with locally advanced gastric cancer. We also determined whether the gene polymorphisms studied were associated with the susceptibility to locally advanced gastric cancer.

The protocol was approved by the local Ethics Committee, and informed consent was obtained from each of the patient or a close relative. All of the consecutive patients with locally advanced gastric cancer from June 1, 2004 to June 1, 2006 were prospectively considered. To be eligible for enrollment, all of the subjects had to be Chinese Han Population. The exclusion criteria were the following: (1) anorexia nervosa; (2) pyloric obstruction; (3) major gastrointestinal disease, chronic renal failure, diabetes and HIV; (4) hepatic, peritoneal, pelvic and distant metastasis; (5) consanguineous mating. Immediately after admission and before any surgical or medical procedure was begun, patients were investigated for the presence of anorexia, weight loss, smoking and drinking water status. The controls were recruited from hospital attendees in two centers with no family history of gastric cancer. They were matched with patients for age and sex, without any malignant diseases and infectious disorders.

In view of the inflammatory nature of cancer cachexia, we explored the role of polymorphisms in genes related to inflammation in gastric cancer. The frequency of IL-1B-31 T, -511 T, +3954 T and IL-1RN VNTR alleles found in this study is comparable to the previous reports in China [20-22]. We found that polymorphisms studied are not associated with a significantly increased risk of locally advanced gastric cancer. However, a significantly increased frequency of IL-1B+3954 T allele was noted in patients with cachexia from locally advanced gastric cancer, which has not been reported previously.

Before evaluating the role of a cytokine polymorphism played in a disease, three questions need to be answered [23,24]. First, are the subjects homogeneous? To avoid artifact in population admixture, we selected only Chinese Han people in China. In addition, the consanguineous mating subjects were precluded from our study. Second, does the product of the studied gene play an important role in the pathogenesis of the disease? The central roles for IL-1beta in the occurrence of cachexia have been demonstrated by many studies [3,5,25]. Third, does the gene polymorphism produce a relevant alteration in the level or function of the gene product? In vitro and in vivo studies have indicated that these alleles enhance IL-1beta and IL-1RN productions and the circulating levels of the two cytokines in humans [10,11].

Since El-Omar et al [26] reported that IL-1B-31CC and IL-1RN*2/*2 genotypes were associated with a significantly increased risk of GC in Caucasians, some contradictory results from studies in different countries have been reported. Therefore, before evaluating the role of a cytokine polymorphism played in cachexia associated with gastric cancer, one important question need to be answered. Are the gene polymorphisms studied correlated with gastric cancer? In the present study, we investigated the roles of IL-1B-31 T/C, -511 C/T, +3954 C/T and IL-1RN VNTR as host risk factors for gastric cancer, but failed to demonstrate an association between polymorphisms studied and gastric cancer susceptibility. Susceptibility to gastric cancer in patients with proinflammatory genetic profile is a fascinating hypothesis that has been mainly confirmed in studies from Poland [26], Portugal [27,28], and the America [29]. In contrast, other studies performed in Asian failed to confirm this finding [20,30,31]. Although there is no clear explanation for these conflicting results, the different genetic background of Western and Asian populations could be an important factor. In addition, gastric cancer is a multifactorial disease. The marked geographic variation, time trends, and the migratory effect on gastric cancer incidence suggest that environmental or lifestyle factors are major contributors to the etiology of this disease. Thus, it is necessary to perform large-scale case-control studies considering lifestyle factors such as diet and drinking habits before a final statement of the role of IL-1B gene polymorphism in gastric cancer can be made. However, our present study from this Chinese population provides evidence that no association was seen between polymorphisms studied and gastric cancer, and thus no evidence that these loci contribute to advanced gastric cancer susceptibility.

While the precise mechanism of cachexia is unclear it is self evident that the inflammatory process is exceedingly strong in weight losing cancer patients [32]. In this study, we examined the cytokine polymorphism frequencies in the patients with locally advanced gastric. However, the distribution of cytokine polymorphisms within the patients varied, with IL-1B+3954 T allele being found significantly more frequently in the cachexia patients than in non-cachexia patients (P < 0.05). Logistic regression adjusted for actual weight, carcinoma location and stage, the IL-1beta+3954 CT genotype was associated with an odds ratio of 2.512 (95% CI, 1.180 - 5.347) for cachexia. In vitro study demonstrated that IL-1beta+3594 T at the 5th exon significantly influences the production of IL-1beta [10]. Therefore, we induce that gene-controlled high production of IL-1beta are likely to play some role in the occurrence of cachexia from patients with advanced gastric cancer. However, in studies with a relatively small sample size, such as the present study, attention should be paid to the evaluation of significant factors suggested by statistical analysis, especially when they have relatively large P values (0.01 <P < 0.05). There is a possibility that such factors show a false-positive result.

There are several strengths of our gene association study. First, patients were recruited from two centers; the number of patients is relatively big compared with studies with smaller sample size. Second, to avoid artifact in population admixture, we selected only Chinese Han people in China, thus limiting the chance of population stratification due to ethnic. Third, we studied four separate but related genes, which allows direct comparison of the results of each gene polymorphism association with outcome. However, the interpretation of our study results is limited because it might be more valuable to measure the actual level or to assess the expressions of IL-1beta in the gastric mucosa according to the polymorphisms. In addition, we didn't evaluate the protein loss of the subjects because such factor was difficult to be expressed numerically and to be evaluated objectively. Doubtless, further studies will identify whether the product of the studied genes play an important role in the pathogenesis of cachexia from advanced gastric cancer.

###begin p 54
In summary, the present study from this Chinese population provides evidence that IL-1beta allele may contribute to the occurrence of cachexia associated with locally advanced gastric cancer. Studies with large sample sizes and multiple SNPs of other important cytokines are needed to further elucidate the genetic factors involved in the etiology of cachexia from gastric cancer.
