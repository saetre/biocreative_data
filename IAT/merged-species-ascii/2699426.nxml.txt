Dectin-1 is a pattern-recognition receptor recognizing beta-(1,3)-glucans found on fungal cell walls. Dectin-1 plays an important role in immunity to fungi by mediating phagocytic clearance of fungal particles and inducing transcription of innate response genes. We show here that the two processes are linked and that Dectin-1 signalling for inflammation is attenuated by phagocytosis. Blocking Dectin-1 ligand-dependent internalization using either actin polymerization or dynamin inhibitors, large non-phagocytosable beta-glucan particles or poorly phagocytic cells leads in all cases to enhanced and sustained activation of downstream signalling pathways and culminates in production of high levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines. These findings establish the importance of phagocytosis not only in the clearance of pathogens, but also in the modulation of pattern-recognition receptor signalling and strongly suggest that internalization is the first step to attenuation of Dectin-1-mediated pro-inflammatory responses.

Direct recognition of microbes by pattern-recognition receptors on DC and MPhi is central to initiating immune responses against infectious organisms 1. TLR are most prominent among the pattern-recognition receptors involved in pro-inflammatory processes, but we and others have recently shown that Dectin-1 is a non-TLR receptor that also has the capacity to induce the expression of innate response genes in DC and MPhi 2-8. Dectin-1 is a C-type lectin expressed on myeloid cells that binds to beta-1,3-glucans found on the cell walls of fungi and some bacteria 2. Dectin-1 signals via a novel hemITAM motif that becomes phosphorylated by Src family kinases on receptor engagement 9, 10. This allows recruitment and activation of the spleen tyrosine kinase (Syk), which then couples to downstream pathways, including those leading to production of reactive oxygen species and, via the adaptor CARD9, to the activation of NF-kappaB 7, 9-11. The latter, together with NFAT and transcription factors activated by MAP kinases downstream of Syk, regulates the expression of a plethora of innate response genes, including those encoding co-stimulatory molecules and pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines 7, 9-12. Notably, unlike the TLR, Dectin-1 not only regulates gene expression but can also function as a phagocytic receptor 10, 13, 14. Phagocytosis is one of the first lines of defense from infection and is a complex process involving mobilization of the actin cytoskeleton and subsequent particle engulfment 14, 15. To what extent Dectin-1 internalization during phagocytosis impacts on signalling for innate gene induction remains unclear. We show here that blocking of Dectin-1 ligand-dependent internalization leads to sustained activation of MAP kinases and increased cytokine production. These results demonstrate the importance of phagocytosis not only in the clearance of the pathogen but also in the modulation of C-type lectin-initiated inflammatory responses.

Different particulate beta-glucans have been used to study signalling by Dectin-1 in MPhi and DC. Some investigators, including ourselves, have previously utilized curdlan, a large particulate (1,3)-beta-glucan from Alcaligenes faecalis16, to demonstrate that triggering of the Dectin-1/Syk pathway independently of TLR signalling promotes DC activation, including secretion of cytokines such as IL-6, TNF-alpha, IL-2, IL-10 and IL-12p40 7, 17. Others have used beta-glucan microparticles (Glu-mp), a highly purified microparticulate form of (1,3)-beta-d-glucan from Saccharomyces cerevisiae, to stimulate MPhi 3, 18, 19. In those cells, Glu-mp induces phosphorylation of both Syk kinase and its substrate SLP-76 but does not lead to cytokine and chemokine production 3. However, Glu-mp potently synergises with TLR agonists in promoting the activation of NF-kappaB and the production of TNF-alpha, MIP-1alpha and MIP-2 3. These studies suggested that distinct types of beta-glucan vary in their ability to trigger Dectin-1-dependent innate responses and/or that DC and MPhi possess intrinsically distinct responses to Dectin-1 engagement.

To test the former hypothesis, we compared the ability of Glu-mp and curdlan with activate DC, using production of inflammatory cytokines as the major readout. First, we confirmed that, like curdlan 7, Glu-mp preparations acted as specific ligands for Dectin-1. We found that fluorescent Glu-mp binds to Dectin-1-transfected HEK293 cells but not to the parental cell line (Fig. 1A, left). In addition, fluorescent Glu-mp bound to WT bone-marrow-derived DC (BMDC) but not to cells derived from Dectin-1-deficient mice, indicating that DC do not possess compensatory receptors for binding beta-glucans (Fig. 1A, right). To directly compare the ability of curdlan and Glu-mp preparations to stimulate DC, cells were cultured with curdlan or Glu-mp and the levels of IL-6, IL-2, TNF-alpha and IL-12p40 in supernatants were measured after 16 h. Glu-mp induced much lower levels of cytokines when compared with curdlan (Fig. 1B). Extensive titration studies established that even when used at maximal dose, Glu-mp induced at best one-hundredth to one-tenth the amount of TNF-alpha and IL-6 that could be elicited by an optimal dose of curdlan (Fig. 1B). Thus, Glu-mp is markedly weaker than curdlan at stimulating DC. This is consistent with the data obtained with MPhi 3 and therefore suggests that the differences previously noted for Glu-mp and curdlan are not only attributable to the use of different cell types 3, 7.

Curdlan forms insoluble particles of >100 mum diameter that cannot be phagocytosed (data not shown). In contrast, Glu-mp size is approximately 1 mum and, even though the particles have a tendency to form larger aggregates (5 mum), they are readily phagocytosed by either MPhi or DC (Fig. 2A). To examine if internalization of Glu-mp affects its ability to stimulate DC activation, we blocked phagocytosis using actin polymerization inhibitors 20. Like binding, the uptake of Glu-mp was Dectin-1-dependent and was completely blocked by pre-treatment of DC with latrunculin A (Fig. 2A). Notably, such blockade converted Glu-mp into a potent stimulus for induction of IL-6, IL-2, TNF-alpha and IL-12p40 (Fig. 2B). The effect was not restricted to latrunculin A as it could be mimicked with other actin polymerization inhibitors such as cytochalasin D, all of which rendered Glu-mp as potent a stimulus as curdlan (Fig. 2B and D, and data not shown). Interestingly, the potency of the latter was paradoxically reduced by DC treatment with the same drugs (Fig. 2B), possibly because actin inhibition impairs the ability of DC to migrate and form conjugates with the large curdlan particles (data not shown). The potentiation of the Glu-mp stimulatory activity by actin polymerization inhibitors was not due to the presence of contaminating TLR agonists in the drug preparations, which acted in a synergistic fashion with Dectin-1 signals 3, 4, 8, because it was still observed when using MyD88-deficient or MyD88/TRIF doubly deficient BMDC that lack all TLR signalling (Fig. 2C and D). In addition, the stimulatory activity of Glu-mp in the presence of the drugs remained strictly Dectin-1-dependent (Fig. 2C), as expected. In contrast, the response to a control TLR9 agonist such as CpG was Dectin-1-independent and MyD88/TRIF-dependent (data not shown). These data indicate that manipulation of actin-dependent endocytic processes markedly affects the ability of Dectin-1 agonists to induce pro-inflammatory responses. In this regard, the previously noted potency of curdlan as an innate stimulus appears to relate to its ability to form large particles that cannot be internalized.

Internalization of cell surface signalling receptors can result in two distinct outcomes. Some receptors, such as TGF-beta receptor, nerve growth factor receptor and epidermal growth factor receptor continue to signal from endosomes, amplifying downstream responses before being eventually degraded 21-26. In contrast, for the BCR, uptake is associated with diminished Ca2+ fluxes and decreased activation of RelA, Akt and ERK, suggesting that productive signalling occurs before receptor translocation to endosomes 27-30. To determine the effect of internalization on Dectin-1 signalling, we evaluated MAP kinase (ERK, p38, JNK) activation in BMDC stimulated with Glu-mp in the presence or absence of actin polymerization inhibitors. Cells stimulated with Glu-mp in the absence of latrunculin A displayed weak and transient phosphorylation of ERK and no detectable activation of p38 or JNK (Fig. 3A). In contrast, in cells stimulated in the presence of latrunculin A, we observed a strong and sustained activation of all three MAP kinases (Fig. 3A), mimicking the action of curdlan (Fig. 3B and Ref. 7).

To prove that the actual lack of internalization rather than a general actin polymerization block is responsible for enhancing Dectin-1-mediated inflammatory responses, we analyzed the effect of a dynamin inhibitor, dynasore 31-33. Because this reagent needs to be used in serum-free conditions, which are not compatible with BMDC survival (data not shown), we utilized HEK293 cells stably transfected with Dectin-1. Like DC, such transfectants avidly internalized Glu-mp and this was fully blocked in the presence of dynasore (Fig. 3C). Notably, the same cells stimulated with Glu-mp in the presence of dynasore showed strong and sustained phosphorylation of ERK (Fig. 3D). In contrast to latrunculin A (Fig. 3A), dynasore did not induce ERK phosphorylation by itself (Fig. 3D), supporting the notion that the strong MAPK activation observed is selectively attributable to blockade of internalization.

Finally, to diminish particle internalization while avoiding possible non-specific effects associated with chemical inhibitors, we tested cells with low phagocytic activity. In contrast to Dectin-1-expressing HEK293 cells, the B-cell hybridoma LK35.2 does not avidly internalize Glu-mp even after transfection with Dectin-1 (data not shown). We therefore stimulated LK cells expressing Dectin-1 with Glu-mp and curdlan at different doses and evaluated their ability to produce IL-2 as a readout of Dectin-1/Syk activation 9. Notably, in contrast to its low stimulatory activity on DC, Glu-mp acted as a significant inducer of cytokine production by Dectin-1-expressing LK cells, being only slightly weaker than curdlan (Fig. 3E). Thus, in poorly phagocytic cells, curdlan and Glu-mp act as comparable agonists for Dectin-1-mediated inflammatory responses.

In this study, we have used two specific ligands, curdlan and Glu-mp, to explore the effect of Dectin-1 internalization on downstream responses. We show here that curdlan is much more potent than Glu-mp at stimulating pro-inflammatory gene expression in DC and that this correlates with the inability of the cells to ingest curdlan particles. Notably, we show that Glu-mp can be converted into a "curdlan-like" stimulus simply by blocking phagocytic uptake, using dynamin or actin polymerization inhibitors, or by using poorly phagocytic cells unable to efficiently internalize Glu-mp. Notably, during the revision of this paper, complementary results were reported by Rosas et al., who similarly conclude that Dectin-1-mediated pro-inflammatory responses are associated with "frustrated phagocytosis" of beta-glucan-containing particles 34. Taken together, the results from the two studies suggest that internalization of Dectin-1 following interaction with ligand leads to attenuation of signalling pathways involved in innate gene induction. This does not exclude the possibility that Dectin-1 may still signal inside the endosome for alternative responses like reactive oxygen species production 10, 13. Nevertheless, our data suggest that Dectin-1 behaves like another Syk-coupled receptor, the BCR, in that it signals primarily from the cell surface for induction of gene expression 27-30. The explanation for this phenomenon remains unclear even in the case of the BCR but it could be that phosphatases involved in attenuation of the signal have better access to Dectin-1 once the receptor is internalized or that the assembly or stability of signalling complexes is physically disrupted by receptor endocytosis 27-30. Our observations on the regulation of Dectin-1 signalling may therefore be particularly relevant for understanding the role of innate immune receptors such as C-type lectins that play a dual role in microbe phagocytosis and in inducing inflammation.
