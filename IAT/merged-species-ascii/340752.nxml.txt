A cDNA for chicken avidin was identified in a chicken oviduct cDNA library by screening with antibodies and synthetic oligodeoxyribonucleotides. Four recombinant clones were characterized and each contained the sequence of the oligonucleotide probes used in screening. They were capable also of expressing an antigen recognizable by a polyclonal or a mixture of monoclonal antibodies raised against avidin. The longest clone, lambda cAV4, contained the entire coding sequence of avidin along with a signal peptide of 24 amino acids. An avidin mRNA, approximately 700 nucleotides in length, was induced by a single injection of progesterone over a period of twenty four hours. The avidin mRNA was distributed in a tissue-specific manner, since detectable concentration of the mRNA appeared only in the oviduct after stimulation with progesterone alone or with a combination of progesterone and estrogen. No avidin mRNA was detected in the liver or kidney under these conditions. Preliminary results on the genomic complexity of avidin suggest a single copy gene. Isolation of the natural gene for avidin and studies on its regulation now can be initiated using the cDNA probe.
