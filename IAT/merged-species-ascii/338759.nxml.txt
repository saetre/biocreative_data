Noncoding regions within the cluster of immunoglobulin heavy chain constant genes in the human genome contained a number of repeats. In the mu-delta intron, two repeating units were contained. One 442-base-long fragment located JH-mu intron (defined as "sigma mu(sigma mu)") occupied the position in the mu-delta intron. The other 1166-base-long fragment located somewhere in front of S (class switch) region of C gamma gene was also found in the mu-delta intron. We defined the repeats in the mu-delta intron as "SIGMA (sigma)". The polarities of the longer repeats in the genome were opposite between the mu-delta intron and the upstreams of C gamma genes. These inverted copies (defined as sigma gamma 3 and sigma gamma 4), located 6 kb upstream of their respective C gamma's, were apparently transcribed in vitro, via RNA polymerase III and transcripts should have contained tRNA-like structures. Small DNA fragments capable of encoding tRNA-like structures were also found in corresponding regions of mouse Ig C gamma cluster.
