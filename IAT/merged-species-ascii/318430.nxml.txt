The enzyme 5-aminolevulinate synthase (ALA-S) catalyzes the first step in heme biosynthesis. In this study, the mouse erythroid gene has been cloned and analyzed in order to investigate the regulation of ALA-S expression during erythroid differentiation. The gene spans approximately kbp and consists of 11 exons and 10 introns. The first exon is 37 bp, non-coding, and followed by a 6kb intron. The mRNA capsite was mapped by primer extension and defines a promoter that contains no apparent TATA element. S1 nuclease analysis detects the presence at low levels of a 45 bp-deleted form of the ALA-S mRNA created by the use of an alternative splice site at the intron 2/exon 3 junction. Five DNAse I hypersensitive sites were detected in chromatin from uninduced and induced MEL cells. One site is at the promoter; the others are in the body of the gene. No significant differences were observed in the patterns or intensity of the hypersensitive sites in the uninduced and induced MEL cells, however, no sites in ALA-S were observed in NIH 3T3 cells or in deproteinized DNA. Thus, these sites are specific for erythroid chromatin but appear to be established at an earlier stage of differentiation than represented by the uninduced MEL cell.
