The ability of the transcription factor NF-kappaB to upregulate anti-apoptotic proteins has been linked to the chemoresistance of solid tumors to standard chemotherapy. In contrast, recent studies have proposed that, in response to doxorubicin, NF-kappaB can be pro-apoptotic through repression of anti-apoptotic target genes. However, there is little evidence analyzing the outcome of NF-kappaB inhibition on the cytotoxicity of doxorubicin in studies describing pro-apoptotic NF-kappaB activity. In this study, we further characterize the activation of NF-kappaB in response to doxorubicin and evaluate its role in chemotherapy-induced cell death in sarcoma cells where NF-kappaB is reported to be pro-apoptotic. Doxorubicin treatment in U2OS cells induced canonical NF-kappaB activity as evidenced by increased nuclear accumulation of phosphorylated p65 at serine 536 and increased DNA-binding activity. Co-treatment with a small molecule IKKbeta inhibitor, Compound A, abrogated this response. RT-PCR evaluation of anti-apoptotic gene expression revealed that doxorubicin-induced transcription of cIAP2 was inhibited by Compound A, while doxorubicin-induced repression of other anti-apoptotic genes was unaffected by Compound A or siRNA to p65. Furthermore, the combination of doxorubicin and canonical NF-kappaB inhibition with Compound A or siRNA to p65 resulted in decreased cell viability measured by trypan blue staining and MTS assay and increased apoptosis measured by cleaved poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase and cleaved caspase 3 when compared to doxorubicin alone. Our results demonstrate that doxorubicin-induced canonical NF-kappaB activity associated with phosphorylated p65 is anti-apoptotic in its function and that doxorubicin-induced repression of anti-apoptotic genes occurs independent of p65. Therefore, combination therapies incorporating NF-kappaB inhibitors together with standard chemotherapies remains a viable method to improve the clinical outcomes in patients with advanced stage malignancies.

Nuclear Factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) plays a major role in a number of oncogenic processes, including development, metastasis and treatment outcomes [1]-[3]. This family of evolutionarily conserved transcription factors (p65 or RelA, p50/p105, p52/p100, RelB and cRel), which share a common Rel homology domain, typically exists as homo- or hetero-dimers in the cytoplasm where they are bound by inhibitory kappaB proteins (IkappaB), such as IkappaBalpha. In response to a variety of stimuli, the inhibitory kappaB kinase (IKK) complex, consisting of two catalytic subunits (IKKalpha and IKKbeta) and a regulatory subunit (IKKgamma/NEMO), can phosphorylate the IkappaB proteins targeting them for degradation by the 26S proteasome. As a result, NF-kappaB is released and can translocate to the nucleus to modulate gene transcription. A number of target genes have been identified, including anti-apoptotic proteins, proteins involved in angiogenesis, and proteins regulating cellular proliferation [2], [3].

The activation of anti-apoptotic gene transcription by NF-kappaB has been linked to the ability of malignancies to resist the cytotoxic effects of standard chemotherapeutics. Previous work from our laboratory and others has demonstrated that NF-kappaB is activated in response to a number of chemotherapies and irradiation [4]. Specifically, in fibrosarcoma cells, the induction of NF-kappaB activity by etoposide resulted in increased expression of A1/Bfl-1 while inhibition of NF-kappaB blocked the induction of A1/Bfl-1 and resulted in enhanced etoposide-induced cell death [5]. Moreover in colon cancer cells, NF-kappaB inhibition combined with CPT-11 (active metabolite of camptothecin) resulted in decreased xenograft growth when compared to chemotherapy alone [6], [7]. Similar effects of NF-kappaB inhibition have also been demonstrated in lung cancer and breast cancer [8], [9]. These studies collectively support an important role for NF-kappaB in the chemoresistance of solid tumors.

However, some recent reports have challenged this model and proposed that NF-kappaB activity seen in response to DNA damage induced by ultraviolet radiation and chemotherapeutics can function to promote cell death [10]-[12]. The most common stimuli used to reportedly induce pro-apoptotic NF-kappaB activity are the anthracycline, doxorubicin, and its analogues [10]-[12]. Two distinct mechanisms have been proposed to mediate this effect. Campbell et al. demonstrated that in osteosarcoma cells daunorubicin induces recruitment of NF-kappaB together with histone deacetylases to silence the transcription of Bcl-xL [11]. On the other hand, Ho et al. demonstrate that treatment of breast cancer cells with doxorubicin generates an NF-kappaB complex that is deficient in both phosphorylation and acetylation and represses anti-apoptotic gene transcription in a mechanism independent of histone deacetylases [12]. These studies further suggest that NF-kappaB activation may be required for doxorubicin to induce cell death and therefore that combining targeted NF-kappaB inhibition could actually serve to counteract the desired cell killing effects of chemotherapy [11], [12]. While these two studies describe mechanisms by which NF-kappaB can silence the expression of selective genes, there is little evidence in the literature demonstrating that inhibition of NF-kappaB activity renders chemotherapy less effective.

Answering this question is critical to determining the potential benefits or hazards to employing NF-kappaB inhibition as an adjunct to standard chemotherapy. Currently, the primary chemotherapy treatment of advanced stage sarcomas is doxorubicin, which only yields a 15-35% response rate [13], [14]. This dismal response, in combination with the fact that the therapeutic options have not changed in 20 years, highlights the highly chemoresistant nature of this disease [13]. As such, we employed the osteosarcoma model used by Campbell et al. in order to further evaluate and characterize the response of NF-kappaB to doxorubicin, specifically focusing on determining whether the induced activation of NF-kappaB is pro- or anti-apoptotic. To that end, in this study, we demonstrate that doxorubicin-induced repression of certain anti-apoptotic genes occurs through a mechanism that is independent of canonical NF-kappaB activity. Moreover, we show that doxorubicin-induced NF-kappaB activity in sarcomas is transcriptionally active and that targeted inhibition of canonical NF-kappaB activation enhances the cytotoxic effects of doxorubicin through increased apoptotic cell death.

Initially, we sought to characterize the effects of IKK inhibition using the small molecule IKKbeta inhibitor [15], Compound A, on the ability of doxorubicin to activate NF-kappaB. To that end, U2OS cells were stimulated with doxorubicin (2 microM) for 3 hours with or without a one hour pretreatment with Compound A (5 microM). Cells treated with DMSO served as controls. Activation of the canonical NF-kappaB pathway was assessed by measuring the phosphorylation of IkappaBalpha at the serine 32 and 36 residues (p-IkappaBalpha32,36). Additionally, we evaluated the phosphorylation status of p65 at the serine 536 residue (p-p65536) as this modification has been shown to be important for transcriptional activity [1]. We found that treatment with doxorubicin resulted in a significant increase in p-IkappaBalpha32,36 (Figure 1A). This corresponded to a decrease in total levels of IkappaBalpha, which is consistent with proteasomal degradation (Figure 1A). Simultaneously, we determined that doxorubicin stimulation generated a substantial increase in p-p65536 when compared to untreated controls (Figure 1A). However, in cells pretreated with Compound A there was complete inhibition of doxorubicin-induced phosphorylation of both IkappaBalpha and p65 (Figure 1A). In order to confirm that doxorubicin can induce phosphorylation of p65 following 3 hours of treatment, we also examined this response in HT1080 fibrosarcoma cells. Similar to the response seen in U2OS cells, doxorubicin did induce a significant increase in p-p65536 at both 1.5 and 3-hour time points (Figure S1). Together these results demonstrate that doxorubicin activates the canonical NF-kappaB pathway and that targeting the IKK complex with Compound A efficiently blocks doxorubicin-induced NF-kappaB activity. Moreover, contrary to previously published work [11], doxorubicin treatment of U2OS cells induces phosphorylation at the serine 536 residue on p65 measured at 3 hours post treatment, suggesting that it may be transcriptionally active (see discussion).

(A) U2OS cells were pretreated with Compound A (Cmpd A, 5 microM) for 1 h and then stimulated with doxorubicin (Dox, 2 microM) for 3 h. Whole cell extracts were evaluated for canonical NF-kappaB activation by western blot. Doxorubicin induces phosphorylation of IkappaBalpha (p-IkappaBalpha32,36) and p65 (p-p65536) compared to DMSO-treated controls. Inhibition of the IKK complex with Cmpd A blocks doxorubicin-mediated increase in p-IkappaBalpha32,36 and p-p65536. (B) Nuclear extracts were prepared from U2OS cells treated with Dox+/-Cmpd A for 3, 6, and 12 hours and evaluated by EMSA. Doxorubicin treatment results in increased NF-kappaB DNA-binding activity at all times points. Pretreatment with Cmpd A successfully inhibits the activation of NF-kappaB by doxorubicin. Supershift analysis confirms that the activated complex of NF-kappaB contains both p65 and p50 subunits. (C) Western blot of nuclear extracts harvested from cells treated with Dox+/-Cmpd A demonstrates that doxorubicin induces nuclear translocation of p65 phosphorylated at serine 536 (p-p65536), and this is inhibited by the addition of Compound A.

Understanding that doxorubicin activates NF-kappaB downstream of the IKK complex, we then analyzed the effects of IKK inhibition with Compound A on the nuclear activity of NF-kappaB in response to doxorubicin. U2OS cells were treated with doxorubicin with or without Compound A for 3, 6 and 12 hours and nuclear extracts were isolated. We then assessed NF-kappaB DNA-binding activity in vitro using EMSA. We found that treatment with doxorubicin results in a robust increase in NF-kappaB DNA-binding activity at all time points compared to the DMSO-treated controls (Figure 1B, Lanes 4, 6, and 8). Supershift analysis confirmed that this activated complex contained both p65 and p50 subunits (Figure 1B). Importantly, when cells were pretreated with Compound A for one hour, doxorubicin-induced NF-kappaB DNA-binding activity was strongly inhibited (Figure 1B, Lanes 5, 7, and 9).

In order to confirm the results of the EMSA, we also examined the effects of doxorubicin treatment on the levels of nuclear p65. As above, U2OS cells were stimulated with doxorubicin in the presence or absence of Compound A and nuclear extracts were isolated. These extracts were then evaluated by western blot for the presence of p65. Consistent with the EMSA results, U2OS cells treated with doxorubicin for 3 and 6 hours had a significant increase in nuclear translocation of p65 when compared to DMSO-treated controls (Figure 1C). Again we noted the presence of increased phosphorylation at the serine 536 residue in cells exposed to doxorubicin (Figure 1C). When cells were pretreated with Compound A, the ability of doxorubicin to induce nuclear translocation of NF-kappaB was eliminated (Figure 1C). These results confirm that in response to doxorubicin, U2OS cells activate NF-kappaB leading to its accumulation in the nucleus. Moreover, these results further indicate that targeted inhibition of the IKK complex with Compound A is an effective means of blocking NF-kappaB nuclear activity, which is important for the analysis of downstream gene targets.

We next evaluated the outcome of doxorubicin-induced NF-kappaB activity on gene expression. Following treatment with doxorubicin alone or in combination with Compound A for 3 and 6 hours, total RNA was extracted and evaluated for mRNA levels of potential NF-kappaB target genes by real time RT-PCR. First, we analyzed the effects of doxorubicin treatment on the transcription of IkappaBalpha, as it is directly regulated by NF-kappaB. Following three hours of doxorubicin stimulation, we determined that the mRNA levels of IkappaBalpha were increased nearly 5-fold compared to DMSO-treated controls (Figure 2A). By 6 h, the transcriptional activation began to subside and only a 2-fold elevation in IkappaBalpha mRNA was identified. This pattern of induction corresponds to the strong induction of p65 phosphorylation described above (Figure 1A and 1C). Furthermore, co-treatment with the IKK inhibitor completely abolished the doxorubicin-induced increase in IkappaBalpha transcription (Figure 2A). These results illustrate that the induction of IkappaBalpha transcription by doxorubicin is regulated by NF-kappaB, confirming that doxorubicin-induced NF-kappaB is transcriptionally active and is not globally repressive in its function.

(A) U2OS cells were stimulated with doxorubicin (Dox) with or without Compound A (Cmpd A) for the indicated times. Total RNA was isolated and evaluated using real time RT-PCR and results are displayed as relative gene expression compared to DMSO-treated controls. Doxorubicin treatment increased transcription of IkappaBalpha and cIAP2, decreased transcription of XIAP, Survivin, Bcl-xL, and Bcl2, and did not alter cIAP1 transcription (black bars). Inhibition of NF-kappaB activation with Cmpd A blocked the induction of IkappaBalpha and cIAP2, but had no effect on the doxorubicin-mediated repression of the other anti-apoptotic genes (gray bars). (B) U2OS cells were transfected with either a non-targeting control siRNA (siCont) or siRNA directed against p65 (sip65). After 48 h incubation, the cells were treated with doxorubicin (Dox) for 12 hours and changes in levels of anti-apoptotic proteins were assessed by western blot. Knockdown of the p65 subunit decreased the basal expression of cIAP2, but did not alter baseline protein levels of XIAP, Bcl-xL, or Survivin. Moreover, the absence of p65 did not alter the ability of doxorubicin to repress the expression of these same proteins.

To further evaluate the transcriptional activity of NF-kappaB in response to doxorubicin, we analyzed the expression patterns of a panel of anti-apoptotic genes in these cells. We selected genes that belong to both the Inhibitor of Apoptosis Protein (IAP) family and the Bcl-2-like protein family as they have been reported to be NF-kappaB regulated, both positively and negatively, in various cellular model systems [3]. Interestingly, we determined that doxorubicin treatment had varying effects on these genes. While there was no effect of doxorubicin on the expression of cIAP1 compared to DMSO-treated controls, there was a significant 2.5-fold induction of cIAP2 mRNA transcription following 3 hours of treatment (Figure 2A). On the other hand, when we examined other IAPs, we found that exposure to doxorubicin resulted in transcriptional repression of XIAP and Survivin (Figure 2A). Similarly, doxorubicin's ability to silence gene expression was also seen with Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL (Figure 2A), consistent with the results seen by Campbell et al [11].

However, in cells pretreated with Compound A prior to doxorubicin stimulation, we discovered that NF-kappaB inhibition had no effect on basal expression of cIAP1, although combination treatment did result in a modest decrease in cIAP1 mRNA (Figure 2A). When we evaluated cIAP2, we found that the addition of Compound A successfully inhibited the doxorubicin-induced increase in transcription, in addition to substantially decreasing basal mRNA levels (Figure 2A). Contrary to these results, combining NF-kappaB inhibition with doxorubicin did not alter the pattern of transcriptional repression of XIAP, Survivin, Bcl-2, or Bcl-xL seen in cells treated with doxorubicin alone (Figure 2A). These results provide further evidence that NF-kappaB is transcriptionally active in response to doxorubicin as evidenced by the regulation of cIAP2, which mirror the results seen with IkappaBalpha. Moreover, our data reveal that the ability of doxorubicin to cause transcriptional repression of the anti-apoptotic genes XIAP, Survivin, Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL is not dependent on NF-kappaB activity, at least that regulated by IKKbeta.

In order to expand on these results and further evaluate if the effects at the mRNA level translated to protein expression, we selectively depleted the p65 subunit in U2OS cells using siRNA and then evaluated the effects of doxorubicin treatment on anti-apoptotic proteins. Cells transfected with a non-targeting siRNA (siCont) served as controls. The successful depletion of p65 was confirmed using western blot (Figure 2B). Interestingly, the increased transcription of cIAP2 did not translate to increased protein levels following exposure to doxorubicin. However, in the absence of p65, the levels of cIAP2 were significantly decreased basally and in response to doxorubicin (see Discussion). On the other hand, similar to the transcriptional results seen with Compound A, the knockdown of p65 did not alter the baseline protein expression of XIAP, Survivin, or Bcl-xL (Figure 2B). Moreover, treatment with doxorubicin resulted in decreased levels of these three anti-apoptotic genes and this pattern was unchanged in cells lacking the p65 subunit (Figure 2B). These results in combination with the transcriptional results seen using IKK inhibition support a role for NF-kappaB in both basal and doxorubicin-induced expression of cIAP2, and further suggest that NF-kappaB canonical activity is not mechanistically important for doxorubicin-induced repression of anti-apoptotic genes such as XIAP, Survivin, and Bcl-xL.

Having established that NF-kappaB activity has a selective transcriptional effect on cIAP2 and no effect on the doxorubicin-induced repression of other anti-apoptotic genes, we then explored the outcome of NF-kappaB inhibition on the cytotoxicity of doxorubicin. First, we evaluated the effects of combined treatment with doxorubicin and Compound A on cell growth and viability. A growth study was conducted using four treatment groups, DMSO, Compound A, doxorubicin, and doxorubicin plus Compound A. U2OS cells were seeded in 6-well plates and treated every 48 hours. The total number of live cells was then counted every 2 days using trypan blue staining. Although treatment with Compound A or doxorubicin individually had a modest effect on cell growth early, it appeared only to delay cell growth (Figure 3A). However, combination treatment with doxorubicin and Compound A resulted in a significant decrease in cell number that persisted throughout the course of the study (Figure 3A).

(A) U2OS cells were seeded in 6-well plates and treated every 48 hours with DMSO, doxorubicin (Dox, 5 ng/ml), Compound A (Cmpd A, 5 microM), or Dox+Cmpd A. The total number of live cells was counted at 2-day intervals. While both Dox alone and Cmpd A alone resulted in some decrease in cell growth, the combination of NF-kappaB inhibition with doxorubicin substantially enhanced the cytotoxic effects of doxorubicin alone. (B) U2OS cells were pretreated with DMSO or Cmpd A and then exposed to Dox at either 0.5 microM or 2 microM for 24 hours. The number of cells was then measured using an MTS assay and displayed as the percent of total cells compared to DMSO-treated controls. Although Cmpd A alone had minimal effect on cell number, its combination with Dox at either dose resulted in decreased number of cells compared to doxorubicin alone. (C) U2OS cells treated with Dox+/-Cmpd A for the indicated time points were evaluated for the presence of the apoptotic markers cleaved PARP and cleaved Caspase 3. Treatment with Dox alone had minimal effects on apoptosis. However, the combination of NF-kappaB inhibition and Dox resulted in a significant increase in both cleaved PARP and cleaved Caspase 3, which is consistent with increased apoptotic cell death.

In order to further evaluate the outcome of combining NF-kappaB inhibition with doxorubicin, U2OS cells were seeded in a 96-well plate and subjected to treatment with DMSO, Compound A (5 microM), doxorubicin (0.5 microM or 2 microM), or doxorubicin plus Compound A for 24 hours. The overall number of cells was then quantified using an MTS assay. Treatment with Compound A alone had no effect on the overall number of cells compared to controls, while doxorubicin demonstrated a dose-dependent decrease in cell proliferation (Figure 3B). Consistent with the results of the growth study, when U2OS cells were pretreated with Compound A prior to the addition of doxorubicin there was a greater decrease in cell number compared to cells treated with doxorubicin alone (Figure 3B). Moreover, by incorporating NF-kappaB inhibition with the chemotherapy, equivalent cytotoxic effects of doxorubicin alone at 2 microM could be achieved using 75% less chemotherapeutic drug (Figure 3B).

Finally, we analyzed U2OS cells treated with either doxorubicin alone or in combination with Compound A for the presence of cleaved poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) and cleaved Caspase 3 to determine if increased apoptosis was a component of the enhanced cytotoxicity. While doxorubicin was able to induce low levels of apoptosis by 12 hours, the combination of NF-kappaB inhibition and doxorubicin resulted in a substantial increase in the accumulation of cleaved PARP and cleaved Caspase 3 (Figure 3C). These results support a role for NF-kappaB activation in the inherent chemoresistance of osteosarcomas. Understanding that cIAP2 was regulated by NF-kappaB and induced by doxorubicin, we questioned whether this anti-apoptotic gene alone enabled U2OS cells to evade the cytotoxic effects of doxorubicin. However, selective depletion of cIAP2 using siRNA did not result in increased apoptosis in cells treated with doxorubicin (data not shown and see Discussion). The combination of these assays illustrates that increased NF-kappaB activity seen in response to doxorubicin inhibits the cell killing potential of doxorubicin.

In order to further explore the mechanism behind NF-kappaB-mediated chemoresistance, we initially further dissected the means by which doxorubicin activates NF-kappaB. Based on previous results from our laboratory showing an important role for both IKKalpha and IKKbeta in the NF-kappaB response to doxorubicin [16], we hypothesized that similar functions of these kinases existed in osteosarcomas. To address this question, U2OS cells were transfected with siRNA targeting the IKKalpha subunit, the IKKbeta subunit, or both. A non-targeting siRNA (siCont) served as a control. The cells were incubated for 48 hours and then stimulated with doxorubicin for 3 hours. Whole cell extracts were then evaluated for phosphorylation of p65 at the serine 536 residue. We discovered that the knockdown of either IKKalpha or IKKbeta resulted in diminished levels of doxorubicin-induced p-p65536 when compared to cells transfected with siCont (Figure 4A). However, in the absence of either catalytic subunit alone, doxorubicin was able to generate a modest increase in NF-kappaB activation compared to untreated controls, but targeting both subunits completely prevented the induction of p-p65536 (Figure 4A). Consistent with our previous work in fibrosarcomas, doxorubicin activates canonical NF-kappaB signaling through both IKKalpha and IKKbeta. Although it has been recently shown that IKKalpha can activate the canonical pathway as a compensatory mechanism in the absence of IKKbeta [17], our data demonstrates that in sarcomas both catalytic subunits mutually contribute to the activation of NF-kappaB in response to doxorubicin.

(A) U2OS cells were transfected with siRNA constructs targeting IKKalpha (siIKKalpha), IKKbeta (siIKKbeta) or a non-targeting control siRNA (siCont). The cells were then treated with doxorubicin (Dox) for 3 hours. Western blot confirmed that siIKKalpha and siIKKbeta achieved selective knockdown of their respective subunits. Analysis of phosphorylation of p65 (p-p65536) demonstrated that the decrease in either IKKalpha or IKKbeta alone did not completely eliminate the ability of doxorubicin to induce p-p65536. However, knockdown of both catalytic subunits resulted in complete inhibition of the doxorubicin-induced increase in p65 phosphorylation.

Understanding that IKKalpha actively participates in the canonical NF-kappaB response to doxorubicin, we proceeded to evaluate the effects of doxorubicin on the alternative NF-kappaB pathway. Specifically, we treated U2OS cells with doxorubicin (2 microM) in the presence or absence of Compound A (5 microM) for 6 hours. Cytoplasmic and nuclear extracts were then prepared and evaluated for the presence of p52, a critical component and effector of the alternative NF-kappaB pathway. Interestingly, we found that treatment with doxorubicin did increase the levels of p52 in the nucleus when compared to DMSO-treated controls (Figure 4B). This nuclear accumulation of p52 was effectively inhibited when cells were pretreated with Compound A (Figure 4B, see Discussion).

Next we evaluated the individual contributions of each NF-kappaB subunit to the chemoresistance of osteosarcomas. To do so we transfected U2OS cells with siRNA targeting the p65 subunit, the p100 subunit (the precursor for p52), or a non-targeting control. The cells were then treated with doxorubicin for 12 hours and assessed for the onset of apoptosis. Western blots confirmed that adequate and selective knockdown of the individual subunits was achieved (Figure 5). Treatment with doxorubicin alone was unable to induce measurable apoptosis (Figure 5). The results were similar when cells lacking p100/p52 were stimulated with doxorubicin (Figure 5). However, in cells in which p65 was depleted, exposure to doxorubicin resulted in a substantial increase in levels of cleaved PARP and cleaved Caspase 3 indicating ongoing apoptosis (Figure 5). The inability of sip100 to enhance doxorubicin-induced cell death, demonstrates that the enhanced nuclear accumulation of p52 does not directly contribute to the U2OS cells' resistance to the apoptotic effects of chemotherapy. On the other hand, the p65 subunit has an active role in the ability of osteosarcomas to resist the cytotoxic effects of doxorubicin, highlighting the importance of canonical NF-kappaB signaling as a critical mechanism underlying the chemoresistance of sarcomas.

Western blot for p65 confirmed significant knockdown. Evaluation of p100 levels revealed a modest decrease of p100 in the cells lacking p65 and complete knockdown in the cells treated with sip100. Importantly, the levels of p52 were not affected by sip65, but were substantially decreased in the absence of its precursor p100. Analysis of the apoptotic markers cleaved PARP and cleaved Caspase 3, revealed a robust increase in apoptosis in response to doxorubicin only in cells lacking the p65 subunit.

Our study demonstrates an important role for NF-kappaB activity in the ability of osteosarcomas to resist the cytotoxicity of the commonly used chemotherapeutic, doxorubicin. In contrast to previously published work [11], we show that in response to doxorubicin, a transcriptionally active form of p65 is generated and accumulates in the nucleus. This in turn leads to the increased transcription of cIAP2 and IkappaBalpha. We also illustrate that the repression of several anti-apoptotic genes by doxorubicin occurs in a manner independent of canonical NF-kappaB activity. Importantly, the combination of canonical NF-kappaB inhibition with doxorubicin resulted in enhanced cytotoxicity compared to doxorubicin alone, in part through increased apoptotic cell death.

Previously, others have reported that doxorubicin or its analogue daunorubicin activates NF-kappaB in such a manner that it recruits p65 to repress its target genes. In those studies, there is increased DNA-binding activity by EMSA in response to drug treatment, but no change is identified in the level of phosphorylated p65 at the serine 536 residue [11], [12], which has been established as a important modification for NF-kappaB transcriptional activity [1]. In contrast to the results seen by Campbell et al. after 5 hours of treatment with chemotherapy [11], in our study we identified a significant increase in p65 phosphorylation at serine 536 following 3 hours of treatment with doxorubicin in both U2OS and HT1080 cells. This difference in exposure to doxorubicin suggests that an earlier assessment of response may be critical to identify changes in p65 phosphorylation. The importance of early evaluation of treatments on NF-kappaB activity is also evident in the assessment of transcriptional targets, as this early increase in p-p65536 did correlate with increased transcription of IkappaBalpha and cIAP2. On the other hand, Ho et al. demonstrated that doxorubicin treatment in MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells did not increase p65 phosphorylation at serine 536 at any time from 10 minutes up to 24 hours and concordantly demonstrated a decrease in cIAP2 transcription [12]. Similarly, we also did not identify any alterations in p-p65536 in these breast cancer cells after 1.5 or 3 hours of doxorubicin treatment (Figure S1). Therefore, identifying the presence or absence of this modification could serve as a marker to determine whether canonical NF-kappaB activated by chemotherapeutics is transcriptionally active or repressive, respectively.

In addition to the absence of post-translational phosphorylation at serine 536, reports in the literature supporting a repressive function for NF-kappaB have relied on evaluating a limited subset of anti-apoptotic genes and correlating those expression patterns with luciferase reporters [11], [12], [18]. However, this correlation can be difficult in the setting of transient activation of NF-kappaB and time required to accumulate firefly luciferase for an accurate reading. For instance in U2OS cells, we reveal that the induction of transcription of IkappaBalpha and cIAP2 is identified early following 3 hours of doxorubicin treatment, and subsequently declines. Under such conditions, the use of a luciferase reporter assay, which requires sufficient treatment times to allow for translation and accumulation of firefly luciferase, may not accurately depict the subtle changes at individual promoters at shorter time points. This issue is evident in our study, where despite identifying increased mRNA levels for two NF-kappaB target genes, the NF-kappaB luciferase reporter assay shows decreased expression of the reporter gene in cells treated with doxorubicin (Figure S2). Additionally, if the mechanism by which doxorubicin represses gene transcription is not regulated by NF-kappaB, it may also silence the transcription of exogenous luciferase reporters.

Moreover, reports that link NF-kappaB activity to the repression of anti-apoptotic genes lack substantial evidence examining the overall effects of NF-kappaB inhibition on the cytotoxicity of doxorubicin, which is an important question in regards to future clinical applications [11], [12]. As a result, in the present study we incorporated several techniques to assess the outcome of combining targeted NF-kappaB inhibition with chemotherapy on cell growth, cell number and apoptosis. Using the IKKbeta inhibitor, Compound A, we illustrate that blocking the induction of NF-kappaB activity can enhance the efficacy of doxorubicin, as evidenced by decreased cell growth and increased levels of cleaved PARP and cleaved Caspase 3. We then further confirmed that canonical NF-kappaB signaling is important to the chemoresistance of U2OS cells by showing similar increases in apoptosis when cells were first depleted of p65 using siRNA prior to treatment with doxorubicin. Based on these results, NF-kappaB is anti-apoptotic in its function in response to doxorubicin and inhibiting the activation of canonical NF-kappaB is an effective means for overcoming the chemoresistance in sarcomas.
###end p 43
###begin p 44
However, the mechanism underlying the anti-apoptotic function of NF-kappaB in U2OS cells remains elusive. In light of the fact that selective depletion of cIAP2 did not generate enhanced apoptosis (data not shown), the classical model of NF-kappaB-mediated induction of anti-apoptotic genes may not be sufficient, in and of itself, to explain the added benefits seen in the combination treatment groups. Further studies are ongoing to determine the key targets downstream of canonical NF-kappaB activation that are responsible for mediating the resistance to doxorubicin-induced cell death in sarcomas.

Given the active role of IKKalpha in the canonical NF-kappaB response to doxorubicin, it will be important to further identify the contributions of p52 activation to the ability of sarcoma cells to evade the toxicity of standard chemotherapy. In our study we demonstrate that doxorubicin treatment induces an increase in nuclear accumulation of p52, and we further show that IKK inhibition with Compound A abrogates this response. Further studies will be necessary to determine if the increase in nuclear p52 is the result of true activation of the non-canonical pathway through IKKalpha-mediated phosphorylation of p100 and its subsequent cleavage to p52, or if there are other mechanisms downstream of IKKalpha and IKKbeta that are driving additional NF-kappaB subunits to the nucleus. In addition to determining the mechanism leading to increased nuclear p52, it will be important to identify its contribution to chemoresistance in response to doxorubicin. Although we demonstrate that its knockdown in isolation did not enhance cell death, p52 may contribute in other ways to the ability of U2OS cells to evade cytotoxic effects of chemotherapy. Specifically, further investigation of the potential role of p52 in the regulation of the cell cycle in osteosarcoma cells treated with doxorubicin will be important as others demonstrated p52's ability to influence the expression of several key cell cycle regulators such as Cyclin D1 and p21 [19]-[21].

Furthermore, as the drive to design and discover new cancer therapeutics continues, it is important to realize the importance of the IKKalpha subunit in cancer chemoresistance. To date, the majority of research on targeted inhibition has focused on the IKKbeta subunit because of its role in NF-kappaB activation by cytokines [2]. In this study, we demonstrate that selective depletion of either IKKalpha or IKKbeta alone is not sufficient to inhibit the activation of canonical NF-kappaB activity. Additionally, treatment with the IKKbeta inhibitor Compound A at lower doses (1 microM) was unable to completely inhibit the activation of canonical NF-kappaB (data not shown). However, by increasing the concentration of Compound A (5 microM), we were able to completely block doxorubicin-induced canonical NF-kappaB activity. Given that Ziegelbauer et al. demonstrated that although Compound A is more selective for IKKbeta it also effectively inhibits IKKalpha at higher concentrations [15], we hypothesize that Compound A at higher doses targets both IKKalpha and IKKbeta and therefore can prevent downstream activation of canonical NF-kappaB signaling by doxorubicin. The combination of these results, together with our previous work [16], highlights an important and active role for IKKalpha in chemotherapy-induced activation of canonical NF-kappaB activity. Moreover, Lam et al have recently shown that IKKalpha can be recruited to activate p65 as a compensatory response in the absence of IKKbeta [17]. Therefore, achieving adequate and complete inhibition of NF-kappaB activation as an adjunct to conventional chemotherapy is likely to require successful targeting of both subunits, rather than isolated inhibition of IKKbeta alone.

For malignancies resistant to standard chemotherapies like sarcomas, where the chemotherapeutic options have not changed in nearly 20 years, nor has the 12-16 month median survival for patients with metastatic disease, the concept of combating the inherent chemoresistance of solid tumors with novel biologic therapies has never been more important [13]. Our results demonstrate that the transcription factor NF-kappaB actively influences the cellular response to chemotherapy. Therefore, combination therapies incorporating NF-kappaB inhibitors, such as small molecules targeting the IKK complex, together with standard chemotherapies remains a viable method to improve the clinical outcomes in patients with advanced stage malignancies.

U2OS human osteosarcoma cells, HT1080 human fibrosarcoma cells, and MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells were obtained form American Type Culture Collection (ATCC, Rockville, MD). The U2OS cells, HT1080 cells and MDA-MB-231 cells were maintained in McCoy's 5A medium (Mediatech, Inc., Manassas, VA), MEM-Alpha medium, and DMEM medium (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA), respectively. All growth media was supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 100 microg/ml penicillin and 100 microg/ml streptomycin. Cell cultures were maintained at 37degreesC with a mixture of 95% air and 5% CO2. Cells were treated with doxorubicin (1 microg/ml) and harvested at the indicated time points. Inhibition of NF-kappaB was accomplished using a small molecule inhibitor of IKKbeta (Compound A) obtained from Theralogics (Chapel Hill, NC). It can target both IKKalpha and IKKbeta subunits, but exhibits a greater affinity for IKKbeta [15]. Cells were pretreated with Compound A for 1 hour prior to stimulation with doxorubicin. For all experiments incorporating treatment with Compound A, cells treated with DMSO served as a control.

Doxorubicin induces phosphorylation of p65 in HT1080 cells. HT1080 fibrosarcoma cells and MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells were treated with doxorubicin (DOX) for 1.5 and 3 hours. Whole cell lysates were then evaluated for the presence of phosphorylation of p65 at serine 536 (p65536). Doxorubicin treatment resulted in increased levels of p65536 at both time points in HT1080 cells, but did not alter the level of p65 phosphorylation in MDA-MB-231 cells.

Doxorubicin treatment represses NF-kappaB luciferase reporter. U2OS cells were transfected with both a 3xkappaB firefly luciferase reporter construct and a Renilla construct to serve as a control for transfection efficiency. After incubation for 24 hours, the cells were subsequently stimulated with doxorubicin (Dox) with or without Compound A (Cmpd A) for 12 hours. The cells were then lysed and evaluated using a dual luciferase assay. Treatment with doxorubicin resulted in repression of the NF-kappaB reporter when compared to DMSO treated controls. Additionally, Compound A alone or in combination with doxorubicin was also capable of silencing the NF-kappaB reporter.
