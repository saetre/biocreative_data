The mouse glycinamide ribonucleotide formyltransferase (GART) locus is known to produce two functional proteins, one by recognition and use of an intronic polyadenylation site and the other by downstream splicing. We now report a similar intronic polyadenylation mechanism for the human GART locus. The human GART gene has two potential polyadenylation signals within the identically located intron as that involved in intronic polyadenylation in the mouse gene. Each of the potential polyadenylation signals in the human gene was followed by an extensive polyT rich tract, but only the downstream signal was preceded by a GT tract. Only the downstream signal was utilized. The polyT rich tract which followed the functional polyadenylation site in the human GART gene was virtually identical in sequence to a similarly placed region in the mouse gene. An exact inverted complement to the polyT rich stretch following the active polyadenylation signal was found in the upstream intron of the human gene, suggesting that a hairpin loop may be involved in this intronic polyadenylation.
