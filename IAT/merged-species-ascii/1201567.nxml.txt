Cyclooxygenase 2 (COX-2), the inducible form of prostaglandin G/H synthase, is associated with several human cancers including pancreatic adenocarcinoma. Pancreatic stellate cells (PSCs) play a central role in the intense desmoplasia that surrounds pancreatic adenocarcinoma. The present study examined COX-2 expression in PSCs. PSCs isolated from normal rats, were cultured and exposed to conditioned medium (CM) from the human pancreatic cell line, PANC-1.

COX-2 was found to be constitutively expressed in PSCs, and COX-2 protein was up-regulated by PANC-1 CM. Moreover, the induction of COX-2 by PANC-1 CM was prevented by U0126, an extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) 1/2 inhibitor suggesting that activation of ERK 1/2 is needed for stimulation of COX-2. Finally, NS398, a selective COX-2 inhibitor, reduced the growth of PSCs by PANC-1 CM, indicating that activation of COX-2 is required for cancer stimulated PSC proliferation.

Vitamin A-containing cells were first reported in 1982 by Watari et al. in vitamin A loaded mice using fluorescence and electron microscopy [1]. This cell type was subsequently identified by electron microscopy in normal rat and human pancreatic tissues [2]. These cells were identified as pancreatic stellate cells (PSCs) by Apte et al and Bachem et al in 1998 [3,4]. In the normal pancreas, stellate cells are quiescent and can be identified by the presence of vitamin A-containing lipid droplets in the cytoplasm. In response to pancreatic injury or inflammation, PSCs are transformed ("activated") from quiescent phenotypes into highly proliferative myofibroblast-like cells which express the cytoskeletal protein alpha-smooth muscle actin (alpha-SMA), and produce type I collagen and other extracellular matrix components. Many of the morphological and metabolic changes associated with the activation of PSCs in animal models of fibrosis also occur when these cells are cultured on plastic in serum-containing medium.

Activated PSCs have also been implicated in the deposition of extracellular matrix components in pancreatic adenocarcinoma [5]. In patients with pancreatic cancer, an intense, interstitial, fibrillar staining for PSCs is evident in the peritumoral fibrous regions. Procollagen I staining colocalized with alpha-SMA to these fibroblast-shaped cells suggests that they are responsible for the deposition of matrix components and the desmoplastic reaction that surrounds the pancreatic tumor [5].

Cyclooxygenases (COXs) are key rate-limiting enzymes involved in the conversion of arachidonic acid to prostaglandin (PG) H2, the precursor of a variety of compounds including PGs, prostacyclin, and thromboxanes. Two isozymes are found in mammalian tissues, COX-1 and COX-2. COX-1 is expressed constitutively in a wide variety of tissues, where it is involved in the maintenance of tissue homeostasis. In contrast, COX-2, which is not expressed in resting cells, is the inducible form of the enzyme responsible for PG production at sites of inflammation. Growth factors, cytokines, tumor promoters, and other inflammatory mediators can induce COX-2 expression [6,7]. COX-2 expression and activity is up-regulated in pancreatic cancer, but absent in normal pancreatic acinar and duct cells [8-10]. Some scattered cells in normal pancreatic tissues express COX-2 [11,12].

In early primary PSCs, cytoplasmic COX-2 staining was detected (Figure 1). However, early primary cultured PSCs (quiescent cells) were alpha-SMA negative (Figure 1). After passage, PSCs flattened and developed long cytoplasmic extensions (activated PSCs), and showed positive immunostaining for COX-2 and alpha-SMA (Figure 2).

On days one and four in primary culture, PSCs expressed low levels of alpha-SMA (Figure 3). Between day 7 and day 20, alpha-SMA expression increased substantially (Figure 3). In. contrast, the COX-2 protein was detected in primary cultured PSC from day 1 through day 20 (Figure 3).

Since COX-2 is increased by PANC-1 CM, the role of COX-2 in PANC-1 CM-induced PSC proliferation was investigated using a specific COX-2 inhibitor, NS398. PANC-1 CM increased PSC thymidine incorporation as well as cell number compared to control medium (Figure 6). Inhibition of COX-2 with NS398 resulted in a concentration-dependent decrease in thymidine incorporation and cell number.

The present study revealed that PSCs express COX-2 constitutively and when activated. The two isoforms of COX, COX-1 and COX-2, differ in many respects. COX-1 is a housekeeping gene that is expressed in most tissue, while COX-2 is not detected in most normal tissues. In the pancreas, islet cells display a strong expression of COX-2 [9]; however, some scattered basal cells in normal pancreas express COX-2 as well, though less than seen in islet cells [11,12]. In hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) which are similar to PSCs, COX-2 expression is virtually undetectable by Western blot analysis in protein extracts obtained from freshly isolated HSC [15]. However, serum-deprived unstimulated HSC express low levels of the COX-2 protein and expression is dramatically enhanced in response to IL-1alpha, TNF alpha or endothelin-1 [15,16]. The present study suggests that COX-2 expression is independent of the activation status in isolated PSCs. While there is no marked expression of COX-2 in desmoplastic areas of pancreatic cancers [8-10], it is possible that the enzyme is up-regulated early in the activation of stellate cells in vivo but increased expression may not be required for maintenance of stellate function once activated.

Stimulation of PSC by PANC-1 CM increased the expression of COX-2. Oncogenes, growth factors, cytokines, chemotherapy and tumor promoters stimulate COX-2 transcription via protein kinase C and RAS-mediated signaling. Stimulation of either protein kinase C or RAS-mediated signaling enhances mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase activity, which in turn, activates transcription of COX-2 [17]. We have previously reported that PANC-1 CM enhances ERK 1/2 activation and growth of PSCs [18]. We speculate that a growth factor is responsible for these effects, however, our attempts to identify the candidate using receptor antagonists and immunoneutralization have not been successful. Inhibition of ERK1/2 phosphorylation by U0126 prevented the PANC-1 CM-stimulated increase in PSC COX-2 protein production. In previous studies U0126 alone had no effect on ERK1/2 or COX-2 expression [19,20]. This suggests that the MAP kinase pathway plays a role in cancer-induced stimulation of COX-2 in PSCs. The reported biological consequences of COX-2 up-regulation include growth stimulation inhibition of apoptosis [21], increased metastatic potential [22] and promotion of angiogenesis [23]. Increased expression of COX-2 in PSCs by PANC-1 CM may contribute to tumor progression.

Finally, the proliferation of PSCs was inhibited by treatment with NS398, a COX-2 inhibitor. In pancreatic carcinomas, COX-2 is overexpressed and NS398 inhibits tumor growth [8,9,24]. This COX-2 inhibitor alone has no effect on expression of COX-2 or ERK1/2 and shows no toxicity at the concentration used in the present studies [20,24]. Recent studies have demonstrated a role for the COX-2 enzyme and PGE2 in the regulation of epithelial cell growth and angiogenesis [23,25,26]. These properties will need to be studied further in pancreatic adenocarcinoma and stellate cells. NS-398 has been previously shown to inhibit cell proliferation of colorectal carcinoma by inducing apoptosis in a COX-2-independent fashion [27]. More studies are needed to confirm the mechanism of inhibition by NS398.

Conclusion
###end title 37
###begin p 38
The COX-2 protein is up-regulated in pancreatic stellate cells by pancreatic cancer-conditioned media. The induction of COX-2 by pancreatic cancer cells is mediated by extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1/2 (ERK1/2). The COX-2 induction by pancreatic cancer cells is involved in mediating PSC proliferation. Therefore, COX-2 may play an important role in the regulation of desmoplasia in pancreatic cancer and inhibition of this enzyme may prevent or reduce this response.

The eluates were lyophilized and reconstituted in fresh IMDM with 1% FBS, forming what we refer to as PANC-1 conditioned medium (CM). In total extracts of 100 ml pf PANC-1 conditioned media were purified and reconstituted in 20 ml of media for PSC culture. Control medium consisted of only serum-free medium without PANC-1 cells which underwent are same Sep-Paking procedure.

COX-2 and alpha-SMA expression in PSCs was evaluated by immunohistochemical staining. Cultured PSCs were grown directly on glass coverslips in six-well plates, and immunostained for COX-2 using peroxidase-labeled streptavidin for immunohistochemistry (KPL, Inc., Maryland) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Cells were fixed for 30 minutes in acetone at -20degreesC. Thereafter, glass coverslips were air-dried and stored at 4degreesC until the cells were stained. Endogenous peroxidase activity was blocked by incubation in methanol with 0.3% hydrogen peroxidase for 30 minutes. After immersion in normal goat serum for 30 minutes, the slides were incubated with COX-2 (murine) polyclonal antibody (Cell Signaling Technology, Inc., Beverly, MA) diluted 1:200 in tris-buffered saline (TBS) 1x bovine serum albumin and stored in a humid chamber overnight at 4degreesC. The slides were incubated with anti-mouse immunoglobulins for 10 minutes at 37degreesC, followed by peroxidase conjugated streptavidin for 30 minutes at room temperature. Finally, color was developed incubating the slides for 8 minutes, with diaminobenzine (DAB Reagent Set; KPL, Inc., Maryland). Expression of alpha-SMA was examined in a similar manner by using monoclonal anti-alpha-SMA antibody (Sigma, St Louis, MI).

Following the treatment of cells with PANC-1 CM for 48 hours, DNA synthesis was measured by adding to each well 0.5 muCi of 3H-methyl thymidine and incubating these plates for the final 24 hours. The cell protein was precipitated with 10% trichloroacetic acid overnight, washed twice with phosphate buffered saline (PBS) and then dissolved by adding 0.25 ml of 0.5 mol/l NAOH to each well. Incorporation of 3H-methyl thymidine into DNA was measured by adding 1 ml of scintillation cocktail (ScintiSafe Plus 50%, S x 25-5, Fischer Scientific, Pittsburgh, PA) followed by count measurements using the Wallac WinSpectral liquid scintillation counter (Wallac Turku, Finland).

Expression of COX-2 and alpha-SMA were detected by Western blotting. Protein extracts (5 mug) from each sample were separated by gel electrophoresis using a 10% sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel (SDS-PAGE). Known molecular weight protein standards were run alongside the samples. Separated proteins were then transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA), which was incubated for one hour at room temperature in blocking buffer (TBS and 0.1% Tween 20 with 5% nonfat dry milk). A murine COX-2 polyclonal antibody was diluted 1:2000 buffer (TBS and 0.1% Tween 20 with 5% nonfat dry milk). After incubation with the primary antibody overnight at 4degreesC, the membrane was exposed to the secondary antibody with gentle agitation for one hour at room temperature. Western Blots were visualized using Chemiluminescence Luminol Reagent (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., CA). alpha-SMA expression was examined in a similar manner by using monoclonal anti-alpha-SMA antibodies. Bands from individual western blots were quantified densitometrically and the mean +/- SEM for each time point or concentration calculated for presentation.
