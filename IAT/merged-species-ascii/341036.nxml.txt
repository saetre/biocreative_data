A BALB/c mouse genomic library was screened with a murine interferon alpha 2 (MuIFN-alpha 2) cDNA coding region fragment. Eight clones were isolated which contain different mouse chromosomal segments related to the MuIFN-alpha 2 probe and a 28 kilobase (kb) region of mouse genomic DNA containing four different MuIFN-alpha genes (alpha 1, alpha 4, alpha 5 and alpha 6) was identified and characterized; an intergenic 1000 nucleotide long conserved sequence was found to be associated with three of these four alpha genes, indicating that this alpha-IFN gene cluster evolved through tandem duplications. Sequence analysis revealed the absence of a polyadenylation site in the 3' untranslated region of MuIFN-alpha 1, and showed that one of the genes (alpha 4) contains an internal deletion of 5 amino acids in the coding region.
