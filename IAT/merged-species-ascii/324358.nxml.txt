We present the sequences at the 5' and 3' ends of one hsp 70 gene variant which is derived from the chromosomal locus 87A7. The 5' end of the hsp 70 mRNA has also been determined. 550 bp upstream from the 5' end of the hsp 70 mRNA, there is a very A+T rich region shown by heteroduplex analysis to be also present at the same position in other hsp 70 genes9. The 5' end of the hsp 70 mRNA was found 26 bp after a characteristic "Hogness box". The first ATG codon was found 250 bp downstream from the 5' end of the hsp 70 mRNA. We also determined the termination codon at the 3' end of the hsp 70 gene. Comparisons with other genes are discussed.
