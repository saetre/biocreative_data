The Kruppel-like factors make up a multigene family of transcription factors that have discrete patterns of expression, implying they play important biological roles in the tissues in which they are expressed. We have identified and characterized the cDNA for a novel murine transcription factor that is an additional member of the Kruppel-like family of transcription factors, named intestinal-enriched Kruppel-like factor (IKLF). This gene appears to be a homolog of the human BTEB-2 gene, although it exhibits a different pattern of tissue expression and the translated product is larger. IKLF is expressed in a limited number of tissues; the highest levels of IKLF expression are found in the digestive tract. IKLF shows temporal changes in expression during embryogenesis indicating that this gene is developmentally regulated. In addition, IKLF expression is limited to the epithelial lining of the intestine and is localized primarily to the base of the crypts in the adult intestine. The IKLF cDNA encodes for a 446 amino acid protein and is able to transactivate by binding specific DNA elements that are also recognized by other members of the Kruppel-like family. In addition, mutations in the activation domain attenuate the ability of this protein to function as a transcription factor. Collectively, these findings show that we have identified a transcription factor that is expressed predominantly in the epithelial crypt cells of the gastrointestinal tract and is a member of the Kruppel-like family of transcription factors.
