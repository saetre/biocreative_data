We have used modification of specific amino acid residues in the E. coli ribosomal protein L10 as a tool to study its interactions with another ribosomal protein, L7/L12, as well as with ribosomal core particles and with 23S RNA. The ribosome and RNA binding capability of L10 was found to be inhibited by modification of one more of its arginine residues. This treatment does not affect the ability of L10 to bind four molecules of L7/L12 in a L7/L12-L10 complex. Our results support the view that L10's role in promoting the L7/L12-ribosome association is due primarily to its ability to bind to both 23S RNA and L7/L12 simultaneously.
