DNA-sequence analysis of 300 nucleotides from the region of cloned, double-stranded ovalbumin cDNA corresponding to the 5' end of ovalbumin messenger RNA was accomplished using the technique of Maxam and Gilbert (Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci. USA (1977) 74,560-564). The AUG initiation codon was located 52 nucleotides from the AT linkers used in cloning and immediately adjacent to the amino terminal peptide of ovalbumin, indicating the absence of a "signal peptide" in this protein. The nucleotide sequence coding for a phosphorylated peptide from ovalbumin was also found. These results demonstrate that the coding portion of mRNAov begins near the 5' end of the molecule leaving some 600 nucleotides of noncoding information at the 3' end.
