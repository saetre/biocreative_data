The complete nucleotide sequence of mRNA for beta-subunit of rat brain S-100 protein was determined from recombinant cDNA clones. The sequence was composed of 1488 bp which included the 276 bp of the complete coding region, the 120 bp of the 5'-noncoding region and the 1092 bp of the 3'-noncoding region containing two polyadenylation signals. In addition, the poly(A) tail was also found. The amino acid sequence deduced from the nucleotide sequence was homologous to the amino acid sequence of bovine S-100 beta subunit except 4 residues showing species differences. From the viewpoint of evolutionary implications, the homology between the nucleotide sequence of S-100 and those of rat intestinal Ca-binding protein (ICaBP) and calmodulin (CaM) was examined. A dot-blot hybridization of poly(A) RNA from the developing rat brains using a labeled cDNA showed a rapid increase in S-100 mRNA at 10-20 postnatal days. The presence of S-100 mRNA in C-6 glioma cells is also described.
