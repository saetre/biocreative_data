A recombinant plasmid (designated pID2) carrying the E. coli gene for tRNAPhe has been isolated from a plasmid bank constructed by the ligation of a total EcoRI digest of E. coli K12 DNA into the EcoRI site of pACYC184 DNA. The plasmid was selected by virtue of its ability to complement a temperature-sensitive lesion in the gene (PheS) for the alpha-subunit of phenylalanyl-tRNA synthetase. Crude tRNA isolated from such transformants exhibited elevated levels of phenylalanine acceptor activity. The tRNAPhe gene has been localized within the first 300 base pairs of a 3.6 kb SalI fragment of pID2. The sequence of the gene and its flanking regions is presented.
