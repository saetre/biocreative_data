Four small nuclear RNAs (snRNAs) have been isolated from Drosophila melanogaster flies. They have been characterized by base analysis, fingerprinting, and injection into Axolotl oocytes. The size of the molecules and the modified base composition suggest that the following correlations can be made: snRNA1 approximately U2-snRNA; snRNA2 approximately U3-snRNA; snRNA3 approximately U4-snRNA; snRNA4 approximately U6-snRNA. The snRNAs injected into Axolotl oocytes move into the nuclei, where they are protected from degradation. The genes coding for these snRNAs have been localized by "in situ" hybridization of 125-I-snRNAs to salivary gland chromosomes. Most of the snRNAs hybridize to different regions of the genome: snRNA1 to the cytological regions 39B and 40AB; snRNA2 to 22A, 82E, and 95C; snRNA3 to 14B, 23D, 34A, 35EF, 39B, and 63A; snRNA4 to 96A. The estimated gene numbers (Southern-blot analysis) are: snRNA1:3; snRNA2:7; snRNA3:7; snRNA4:1-3. The gene numbers correspond to the number of sites labeled on the polytene salivary gland chromosomes.
