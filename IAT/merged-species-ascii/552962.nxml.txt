We investigated the mechanisms by which protein kinase C (PKC) regulates the expression of the alpha2(I) collagen gene in normal dermal fibroblasts. Reduction of PKC-alpha activity by treatment with Go697-6 or by overexpression of a dominant negative (DN) mutant form decreased alpha2(I) collagen gene expression. This decrease required a sequence element in the collagen promoter that contains Sp1/Sp3 binding sites. Reduction of PKC-delta activity by rottlerin or overexpression of DN PKC-delta also decreased alpha2(I) collagen gene expression. This effect required a separate sequence element containing Sp1/Sp3-binding sites and an Ets-binding site. In both cases, point mutations within the response elements abrogated the response to PKC inhibition. Forced overexpression of Sp1 rescued the PKC inhibitor-mediated reduction in collagen protein expression. A DNA affinity precipitation assay revealed that inhibition of PKC-delta by rottlerin increased the binding activity of endogenous Fli1 and decreased that of Ets1. On the other hand, TGF-beta1, which increased the expression of PKC-delta, had the opposite effect, increasing the binding activity of Ets1 and decreasing that of Fli1. Our results suggest that PKC-delta is involved in the regulation of the alpha2(I) collagen gene in the presence or absence of TGF-beta. Alteration of the balance of Ets1 and Fli1 may be a novel mechanism regulating alpha2(I) collagen expression.

Systemic sclerosis or scleroderma is an acquired disorder which typically results in fibrosis of the skin and internal organs. Although the pathogenesis of this disease is still unclear, it includes inflammation, autoimmune attack and vascular damage, leading to the activation of fibroblasts and disturbed interactions with different components of the extracellular matrix (ECM) (1,2). Thus, abnormal scleroderma fibroblasts which are responsible for fibrosis may develop from a subset of cells that have escaped from normal control mechanisms (3,4). However, despite recent advances in understanding the regulation of collagen gene expression, the mechanisms responsible for the pathologic increase in the expression of collagen genes in scleroderma have not been elucidated.

Fibroblasts from affected scleroderma skin cultured in vitro produce excessive amounts of various collagens, mainly type I and type III collagens (5,6), and display increased transcription of the corresponding genes (7,8). Many of the characteristics of scleroderma fibroblasts resemble those of normal fibroblasts stimulated by transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta1 (9,10), suggesting that the activation of dermal fibroblasts in scleroderma may be a result of stimulation by TGF-beta signaling (11,12). Thus, the inhibition of TGF-beta signaling is thought to be one of the most reliable approaches to the treatment of scleroderma, and there have been several reports that such an inhibition can decrease collagen expression in vivo or in vitro (13,14).

Jimenez et al. recently demonstrated that the inhibition of protein kinase C (PKC)-delta by a specific inhibitor of PKC-delta rottlerin or by the overexpression of the dominant negative mutant form (DN) of PKC-delta suppressed the expression of the alphaI(I) and alphaI(III) collagen genes in both normal and scleroderma dermal fibroblasts in vitro, without affecting the expression of other genes examined (15). Furthermore, they showed that scleroderma cells display higher levels of immunoreactive PKC-delta protein using immunofluorescence microscopy and immunoblotting. Their results indicate that PKC-delta may be involved in the regulation of collagen genes in normal and scleroderma fibroblasts, and suggest that the inhibition of this signaling pathway may be another therapeutic approach for this disease. However, the mechanisms by which collagen gene expression is regulated by PKCs in human dermal fibroblasts remain unclear.

Fibroblasts were grown to 50% confluence in 100 mm dishes in MEM with 10% FCS. The medium was replaced with serum-free medium, and fibroblasts were transfected with the alpha2(I) collagen promoter constructs, expression vectors or corresponding empty constructs, employing FuGENE6 as described previously (34). In order to correct minor variations in transfection efficiency, pSV-beta-galactosidase vector (Promega, Madison, WI) was included in all transfections. After 48 h of incubation, cells were harvested in 0.25 M Tris-HCl, pH 8 and fractured by freeze-thawing. Extracts, normalized for protein content as measured with the Bio-Rad reagent, were incubated with butyl-CoA and [14C]-chloramphenicol for 90 min at 37degreesC. Butylated chloramphenicol was extracted using an organic solvent (2:1 mixture of tetramethylpentadecane and xylene) and quantitated by scintillation counting. Each experiment was performed in duplicate.

First, we examined the effects of PKC inhibitors, calphostin C (whole PKC inhibitor), rottlerin and Go6976 (specific PKC-alpha inhibitor), on the expression of type I procollagen in dermal fibroblasts by immunoblotting. As shown in Supplementary Figure 1A and B, two polypeptides, corresponding to the two chains of type I procollagen, were detected in the conditioned medium and cell lysates. It has been already shown that the altered ratio of the alpha1(I) to alpha2(I) chain is attributed to the difference in the immunoreactivity of anti-type I collagen antibody to the alpha1(I) and alpha2(I) chain (18). PKC inhibitors both decreased the secretion of type I procollagen into conditioned medium and reduced the deposition of type I procollagen in the cell lysates. To note, rottlerin had the greatest inhibitory effect (over 80% reduction), which was consistent with previous reports (15), whereas Go6976 decreased the levels of type I procollagen modestly (almost 50% reduction). These results suggest that PKCs are involved in the basal expression of type I procollagen in dermal fibroblasts.

To determine whether the reduction of type I procollagen protein expression by these reagents was correlated with the corresponding mRNA levels, human dermal fibroblasts were incubated in the presence or absence of these inhibitors under the same conditions, and mRNA expression was analyzed by northern blotting. The alpha2(I) collagen mRNA level was significantly reduced after the stimulation with these reagents in comparison with the control level (Supplementary Figure 1C). However, the expression of GAPDH mRNA was not affected by these inhibitors, demonstrating that the indicated concentration of these inhibitors did not have generalized toxic effects. Thus, the effect of these inhibitors on the type I procollagen protein level paralleled that on the mRNA level.

The steady-state level of mRNA can be affected by the level of gene transcription and/or the stability of mRNA. To establish whether the decrease in alpha2(I) collagen mRNA levels after the treatment with PKC inhibitors takes place at the transcriptional level or the posttranscriptional level, we wished to determine whether these reagents decreased the stability of the alpha2(I) collagen mRNA. Following the inhibition of transcription by the addition of actinomycin D, the loss of alpha2(I) collagen mRNA treated by the inhibitors was not significantly different from that observed in the untreated cells (Supplementary Figure 1D). The failure of these inhibitors to decrease the half-life of alpha2(I) collagen mRNA suggests that alpha2(I) collagen gene expression is regulated at the level of transcription by these inhibitors.
###end p 39
###begin p 40
To confirm this, we determined the effects of these reagents on the alpha2(I) collagen promoter activity in dermal fibroblasts by conducting transient transfection assays using the full-length COL1A2/CAT construct. alpha2(I) collagen promoter activity was reduced by treatment with these inhibitors for 24 h to the same extent as the level of protein or mRNA (Supplementary Figure 1E). These results suggest that the basal activity of PKC is essential to maintain the basal transcriptional activity of the alpha2(I) collagen gene.

Several investigators doubt the specificity of Go6976 and rottlerin toward PKC-alpha and -delta, respectively (35,36). Thus, we examined the effects of DN PKC-alpha or -delta on the expression of type I procollagen protein. The overexpression of these constructs also reduced the expression of type I procollagen protein in a dose-dependent manner (Supplementary Figure 1F), whereas DN PKC-epsilon had no effect, although HA-recombinant proteins were expressed at similar levels. These results confirm that basal type I procollagen protein or alpha2(I) collagen gene expression in normal fibroblasts is regulated by at least two signaling pathways, PKC-alpha and PKC-delta.

To identify potential regulatory elements of the human alpha2(I) collagen gene by Go6976 or DN PKC-alpha, we performed transient transfection assays using a series of 5'-deletions of the alpha2(I) collagen promoter linked to the CAT reporter gene. Basal promoter activities of these constructs have been well examined previously (21).

The bp -148approximately+58 construct and the longer constructs responded to Go6976 or DN PKC-alpha, but the subsequent bp -108approximately+58 construct showed little reactivity (Figure 1A). On the other hand, the overexpression of WT PKC-alpha did not affect any of these deletion constructs. The results indicate that the PKC-alpha inhibitor-response element is located between bp -148 and -108 in the alpha2(I) collagen promoter, and that the signaling activity of PKC-alpha is saturated in normal dermal fibroblasts.

This region contains the TCCTCC motif, which can function as SBS in the alpha2(I) collagen promoter (19) as well as integrin alphav promoter (37). To determine whether this motif contributed to the PKC-alpha-mediated promoter activity, the effects of substitution mutations in the TCCTCC motif were investigated (Figure 1B). The alpha2(I) collagen promoter constructs carrying substitution mutations between bp -128 and -123 were unresponsive to Go6976 treatment or co-transfection with DN PKC-alpha. None of the other substitution mutations in this promoter affected the effects of Go6976 or DN PKC-alpha.

To further elucidate whether the TCCTCC sequence from the alpha2(I) collagen promoter mediated the effects of Go6976 or DN PKC-alpha using a heterologous promoter, three copies of the 12 bp oligonucleotide (from bp 131 to 120) containing the TCCTCC motif were cloned in both orientations into the pBL-CAT5 vector carrying thymidine kinase gene promoter elements. The vector construct pBL-CAT5 alone was not affected by PKC-alpha inhibitors, whereas the insertion of 'TCC' oligonucleotides consistently resulted in a modest reduction in promoter activity by the inhibitors, independent of orientation (Figure 1C), which is similar to the previous report (21). These results suggest that PKC-alpha mediates the basal alpha2(I) collagen gene expression through the TCCTCC motif specifically in dermal fibroblasts.

Next, we examined the potential regulatory elements of the human alpha2(I) collagen gene by rottlerin or DN PKC-delta. Transient transfection assays using a series of 5'-deletions of the alpha2(I) collagen promoter revealed that the bp -353approximately+58 construct and the longer constructs responded to rottlerin or DN PKC-delta, but these inhibitors did not affect the promoter activity of the subsequent bp -264approximately+58 construct, indicating the PKC-delta-inhibitor-response element is located between bp -353 and -264 (Figure 1D). On the other hand, unlike WT PKC-alpha, the overexpression of WT PKC-delta-induced promoter activity, and their response element was also located between bp -353 and -264 in the alpha2(I) collagen promoter. This result confirms the PKC-delta responsive element, and indicates that the signaling activity of PKC-delta is not saturated in normal dermal fibroblasts.

This PKC-delta responsive element contains the EBS and three GC-boxes, which can function as the SBS (23,26,38). Thus, the effects of substitution mutations at these binding sites were investigated (Figure 1E). Mutating all three SBS resulted in a significant reduction in reactivity to rottlerin, DN or WT PKC-delta, while mutating the EBS had a significant but weaker effect on the responsiveness. Mutating both the EBS and the SBS resulted in a complete abolishment of their effects. Mutating SBE did not affect the reactivity. Thus, the integrity of both the SBS and the EBS are thought to be critical for PKC-delta-mediated basal alpha2(I) collagen promoter activity.

Our results suggest that Go6976 or DN PKC-alpha down-regulates the alpha2(I) collagen gene expression via the SBS, whereas rottlerin or DN PKC-delta reduces it via the SBS and EBS. To further investigate the involvement of Sp1/3 in the effects of PKC inhibitors, we determined whether the amount of Sp1 or Sp3 was affected by PKC inhibitors. Immunoblotting revealed that the expression levels of these transcription factors in cell lysates were not altered by the treatment with Go6976 or rottlerin (Figure 2A). Additionally, the phosphorylated levels of Sp1 were also unchanged (Figure 2B).

On the other hand, we determined whether forced overexpression of Sp1 or Sp3 could recover the PKC inhibitor-mediated reduction in type I procollagen protein. Twenty-four hours after transfection, the cells were treated with PKC inhibitors, and 72 h later the medium was collected. Immunoblotting revealed that transient transfection of Sp1 itself did not increase the expression of type I procollagen protein, but recovered the reduction by Go6976 or rottlerin in a dose-dependent manner (Figure 2C). In particular, the effect of Go6976 was completely recovered by Sp1 overexpression. The overexpression of Sp3 did not have such effects on type I procollagen protein expression (Figure 2D). These results confirm that Sp1 mediates the suppressive effects of PKC inhibitors without altering the expression or phosphorylation, and that PKC-alpha mediates basal collagen gene expression mainly via Sp1.

Next, we examined how the Ets family was correlated with the PKC-delta-mediated basal alpha2(I) collagen gene expression. In previous reports, both Ets1 and Fli1 were found to bind to the EBS between bp -285 and -282 of the alpha2(I) collagen promoter in a electrophoretic mobility shift assay using nuclear extracts from normal dermal fibroblasts. Furthermore, Ets1 and Fli1 had opposite effects on the alpha2(I) collagen gene expression: Fli1 inhibited the alpha2(I) collagen promoter activity by competing with Ets1 (23,38). Immunoblotting revealed that the amount of Ets1 in cell lysates was reduced and that of Fli1 was increased after the stimulation with rottlerin compared with the levels in control cells (Figure 2E). This indicated that rottlerin reduces Ets1 expression which has a positive effect on alpha2(I) collagen promoter activity, and induces expression of Fli1 which has a suppressive effect.

Additionally, to determine the binding activities of Ets1 and Fli1, we performed a DNA affinity precipitation assay using the COL-EBS oligo, containing the EBS and the SBS of the alpha2(I) promoter. As a negative control, we used the COL-EBS-M oligo, which has a mutated EBS of COL-EBS oligo. The results showed that only the COL-EBS oligo bound endogenous Fli1 strongly after rottlerin treatment for 3 h, whereas the binding of Ets1 to the EBS was decreased (Figure 2F). EBS-M oligo did not bind Ets1 or Fli1 even after the treatment with rottlerin. To note, the binding activity of Sp1 was unchanged by rottlerin in both EBS oligo and EBS-M oligo, however, it was decreased in EBS-M oligo. These results suggest that Ets1 or Fli1 binds to this site in a specific manner, and that the balance of Ets1 and Fli1 binding to the promoter by rottlerin mediates the suppression of alpha2(I) collagen promoter activity.

As shown above, the signaling activity of PKC-delta is not saturated in normal dermal fibroblasts.

It is generally accepted that inactive PKC isoforms are located in the nucleus or cytoplasm, and translocated to the plasma membrane and/or cytoskeleton after activation (40,41). Immunofluorescent labeling revealed that the stimulation of dermal fibroblasts with TGF-beta increased the size of each cell. Only PKC-delta was translocated to the plasma membrane and cytoskeleton in TGF-beta1-treated dermal fibroblasts (Figure 3B). These results indicate that PKC-delta expression is up-regulated and PKC-delta is activated by the treatment with TGF-beta1.

As mentioned above, the overexpression of WT PKC-delta increased the promoter activity in dermal fibroblasts, which is abolished by mutating both EBS and SBS between bp -353 and -264 of the promoter. Thus, we speculated that TGF-beta1 affects the SBS and EBS via the PKC-delta signaling pathway. Because the SBS, the so-called GC-box, has been reported to be one of the TGF-beta-response elements in the alpha2(I) collagen promoter (42,43), we then wished to confirm the involvement of the balance of Ets1 and Fli1 on EBS in the TGF-beta1 signaling pathway. Thus, we determined the binding activities of Ets1 and Fli1, by conducting DNA affinity precipitation assays using the COL-EBS oligo. In fact, the addition of TGF-beta1 increased the binding of Ets1 to the EBS and decreased that of Fli1 in normal fibroblasts (Figure 3C), although TGF-beta1 was reported not to change Ets1 protein expression and to suppress Fli1 protein expression (23,44). These results indicate that the balance of Ets1 and Fli1 may also be involved in the TGF-beta-mediated up-regulation as well as rottlerin-mediated down-regulation of the alpha2(I) collagen gene.

Previously, Go6976 was shown to have little or no effect on the alpha2(I) collagen mRNA expression or promoter activity in renal mesangial cells (47). However, there was a large difference in the dose of this reagent between our study and theirs. The expression of GAPDH mRNA was not affected in our study, indicating that the inhibitory effect of Go6976 was not due to a generalized toxic effect. Furthermore, we confirmed the involvement of PKC-alpha in the regulation of alpha2(I) collagen gene expression by the overexpression of DN PKC-alpha. Our results suggest that Go6976 as well as DN PKC-alpha down-regulates alpha2(I) collagen gene expression via Sp1. However, Go6976 did not alter the total amount of Sp1 or the level of phosphorylated Sp1. Although the mechanism by which Sp1 mediates the transcriptional regulation of the alpha2(I) collagen gene by PKC signaling is presently unknown, it is possible that PKCs affect the interaction of Sp1 with histones or other chromatin components (20). Such a mechanism has recently been described for the regulation of the mouse alpha2(I) collagen promoter by TGF-beta/TNF-alpha, where these cytokine treatments affected the interaction of CTF/NF1 with histone H3 (48,49).

Our study indicated that PKC-delta mediates alpha2(I) collagen promoter activity via Sp1 and Ets1/Fli1 in normal fibroblasts. Synergism between Sp1 and Ets1 has been reported in parathyroid hormone-related protein promoters (50). Moreover, Sp1 and Ets1/Fli1 cooperation is implicated in the regulation of the alpha2(I) collagen promoter (23,38). Although rottlerin altered the Ets1/Fli1 ratio in the EBS of the alpha2(I) collagen promoter, this reagent did not change the levels of phosphorylated Ets1/Fli1 or binding activity of Sp1. Because their nucleotide-recognition elements lie in relatively close proximity, there may be synergism between Sp1 and Ets1/Fli1 in the regulation of this promoter through the modification of chromatin structure. This speculation is supported by the finding that the binding activity of Sp1 to GC-box is decreased by the mutation in the EBS, as shown in Figure 2F or Figure 3C.

Deletion analysis of the human alpha2(I) promoter identified active segments mediating basal promoter activity between bp -376 and -108 (51). Although PKC-alpha- and PKC-delta-response elements shown by our results were included in this region, these two signaling pathways acted on separate regions of the promoter. It is known that each member of the PKC family can have independent effects on a single gene regulation. Overexpression of PKC-alpha or -delta was reported to induce collagenase promoter activity through a 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate-response element (52). On the other hand, PKC-alpha and PKC-theta are thought to have opposite effects on calcineurin-regulated retinoid X receptor transcription during T-cell activation (53). Furthermore, the response element of PKC-alpha differs from that of PKC-theta in the MDR1 promoter in human breast carcinoma cells (54). A similar phenomenon may occur in the regulation of alpha2(I) collagen gene expression.

We also confirmed the association between PKC-delta and TGF-beta1 stimulation. TGF-beta-induced-PKC-delta signaling affected the SBS and the Ets1/Fli1 ratio in the EBS leading to the activation of the collagen promoter. The GC-boxes (42,43), the AP-1 binding site (55) and the SBE (56) have been reported as TGF-beta-response elements in the alpha2(I) collagen promoter, and are located between bp -353 and -186 in the promoter. Our results indicated that the EBS is also involved in the TGF-beta response, which is located in the same region. We speculate that PKC-delta translocated to the plasma membrane and/or cytoskeleton that may regulate transcription of the alpha2(I) collagen gene via downstream signaling cascades including Ras, Raf, MEK1/2 or ERK1/2. For example, it was recently reported that TGF-beta activates ERK mitogen-activated protein kinase, which is implicated in transcriptional regulation by the Ets family, to enhance collagen expression in which PKC-delta may play some role (57,58). The balance of Ets1 and Fli1 may be a novel mechanism regulating alpha2(I) collagen expression. Taken together, our results suggest that PKC-delta is involved in the regulation of the alpha2(I) collagen gene in the presence or absence of TGF-beta.

Kubo et al. reported that Fli1 protein expression is consistently down-regulated in scleroderma dermal fibroblasts (44). The up-regulation of PKC-delta and the down-regulation of Fli1 in scleroderma may be caused by the stimulation of TGF-beta signaling. The inhibition of PKC-delta may be effective for the improvement of abnormal collagen overexpression. Further clarification of the role of PKC-delta in collagen expression could provide a novel strategy for the treatment of fibrotic reactions, including those occurring in scleroderma.

Participation of transcription factors in the alpha2(I) collagen gene's down-regulation by PKC inhibitors in normal fibroblasts. (A) To determine the amounts of Sp1 or Sp3 in cell lysates, fibroblasts were serum-starved for 24 h and treated with PKC inhibitors for the period indicated. Immunoblotting was performed using anti-Sp1 or Sp3 antibody. The same membrane was then stripped and reprobed with anti-beta-actin antibody as a loading control. (B) Dermal fibroblasts were serum-starved for 24 h and treated with PKC inhibitors for 24 h. Cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-Sp1 antibody to examine the phosphorylation levels of Sp1 as described in 'Materials and Methods'. One experiment representative of three independent experiments is shown. Phosphorylated Sp1 levels quantitated by scanning densitometry and corrected for the total level of Sp1 in the same samples are shown relative to the level in untreated cells (1.0). (C and D) For immunoblot analysis, the transient transfection of the Sp1 or Sp3 expression vector in normal dermal fibroblasts was performed as described in 'Materials and Methods'. Twenty-four hours after the transfection, cells were treated with the indicated dose of PKC inhibitors for 72 h. Conditioned media and cell lysates (normalized for protein concentrations as measured with the Bio-Rad reagent) were subjected to immunoblotting with anti-type I collagen antibody and antibody for HA or beta-actin, respectively. Type I procollagen protein levels quantitated by scanning densitometry and corrected for the levels of beta-actin in the same samples are shown relative to the level in untreated cells (1.0). (E) To determine the amounts of Ets1 or Fli1 in cell lysates, human dermal fibroblasts were serum-starved for 24 h and treated with rottlerin for the period indicated. Immunoblotting was performed using anti-Ets1 or Fli1 antibody. The same membrane was then stripped and reprobed with anti-beta-actin antibody as a loading control. (F) Cell lysates were prepared from normal fibroblasts in the presence or absence of rottlerin for 12 h and incubated with the COL-EBS oligo or the COL-EBS-M oligo as described under 'Materials and Methods'. Proteins bound to these nucleotides were isolated with streptavidin-agarose beads, and Sp1, Ets1 or Fli1 was detected by immunoblotting. The levels of Ets1 (open bars) and Fli1 (closed bars) bound to COL-EBS oligo quantitated by scanning densitometry are shown relative to the level in untreated cells (1.0). The mean +/- SE from four independent experiments is presented. *P < 0.05 as compared with the value in untreated cells. EBS, Ets-binding site. (G) Ets1 or Fli1 phosphorylation on threonine (top panel) or serine (middle panel) was determined in fibroblasts treated with rottlerin for the indicated periods of time. Ets1 or Fli1 levels were determined using monoclonal anti-Ets1 or Fli1 antibody on the same filter (bottom panel).

The effects of TGF-beta1 on the expression of PKC-alpha and -delta in normal fibroblasts. (A) To determine the amounts of PKC-alpha and -delta in cell lysates, fibroblasts were serum-starved for 24 h and treated with TGF-beta1 for the period indicated. Immunoblotting was performed using anti-PKC-alpha or -delta antibody. The same membrane was then stripped and reprobed with anti-beta-actin antibody as a loading control. (B) The subcellular distribution of PKC-alpha and -delta was visualized using immunofluorescence. Fibroblasts were serum-starved for 24 h and incubated in the presence or absence of TGF-beta1 for 1 h. Magnification: x630. (C) Fibroblasts were serum-starved for 24 h and treated with TGF-beta1 (2 ng/ml) for 12 h. Cell lysates were incubated with the COL-EBS oligo or COL-EBS-M oligo as described under 'Materials and Methods.' Proteins bound to each nucleotide were isolated with streptavidin-agarose beads, and Sp1, Ets1 or Fli1 was detected by immunoblotting. The levels of Ets1 (open bars) and Fli1 (closed bars) bound to COL-EBS oligo quantitated by scanning densitometry are shown relative to the level in untreated cells (1.0). EBS, Ets-binding site.
