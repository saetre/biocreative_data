The DNA sequence of the araC regulatory gene from Escherichia coli B/r has been determined by the base-specific chemical cleavage reactions of Maxam and Gilbert. An open reading frame is found which codes for a protein of 292 amino acids. A nonsense mutation, araC5, is shown to result from a G to A transition at nucleotide 429 converting the tryptophan codon TGG to the amber codon TAG. A deletion which does not recombine with any known point mutation in araC, delta(araCO)719, removes all but the last 22 codons of the gene.
