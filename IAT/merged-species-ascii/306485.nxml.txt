Transcription of the tRNA-tufB operon of Escherichia coli: activation, termination and antitermination.

Signals setting the level of transcription of the tRNA-tufB operon have been studied by deletion mapping. TufB transcription was measured in vivo with plasmid-borne tRNA-tufB:galk operon fusions. Removal of the sequences from -133 to -58 with respect to the transcription start point, results in a 90% decrease of tufB transcription. This demonstrates the presence of a region, upstream of the tRNA-tufB promoter, that enhances the expression of the operon. DNA fragments bearing this upstream activator region do not display an abnormal electrophoretic mobility, as has been observed for the rrnB P1 upstream activator. Deletions starting in the first tRNA gene and directing towards tufB reveal at least two sites that influence tufB transcription. One signals transcription termination in the intergenic region between thrT and tufB. The other may be involved in antitermination. Possible mechanisms underlying antitermination and termination are considered in the light of the nucleotide sequence.
