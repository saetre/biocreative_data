A 6.9 kilobase Eco R1 fragment containing genes for two U1 RNAs has been isolated from a library of mouse DNA. The two genes code for an RNA which is very similar, if not identical, to mouse U1b RNA as judged by S1 nuclease mapping. This RNA is one base longer than the mouse U1a RNA, human U1 RNA, and rat U1 RNA and differs in six nucleotide substitutions from rat U1 RNA. The two genes are five kilobases apart and the U1 RNAs are coded for on opposite strands of the DNA with the 5' ends juxtaposed. The sequences flanking the genes are identical for 700 bases 5' to the gene and at least 80 bases 3' to the gene.
