3'-processing of mRNA precursors depends on several protein factors. One of them, cleavage and polyadenylation specificity factor (CPSF) is required for the cleavage of the mRNA precursor or as well as for the tail elongation reaction. We have obtained complementary DNA encoding the 160 kDa subunit, which had previously been shown to interact with the AAUAAA polyadenylation signal. The cDNAs code for an open reading frame of 1444 amino acids. The translated protein has a calculated molecular weight of 161 kDa and a predicted pl of 6.2. Polyclonal antibodies raised against a bacterially expressed fragment of the cDNA recognise 160 kDa subunit of purified calf thymus CPSF. The sequence contains a possible nuclear localisation signal but none of the known RNA binding motifs. It does, however, show sequence similarities to a UV-damaged DNA binding protein (UVdDb).
