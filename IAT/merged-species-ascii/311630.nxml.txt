The sequence of the trans-acting positive transcription factor TFIIIA has been deduced by sequencing cDNA and genomic DNA clones. Using DNA from a homozygous diploid animal we show that there is one gene for TFIIIA per haploid genome of X. laevis. Protein sequencing of proteolytic fragments of TFIIIA orients the protein in its interaction with the internal control region (ICR) of the 5S RNA gene. The protein lies along the DNA with its carboxyl terminus at the 5' end of the ICR and its amino terminus at the 3' end. The developmental pattern of TFIIIA and its mRNA during oogenesis and embryogenesis are consistent with the idea that the abundance of TFIIIA plays an essential role in the developmental change in 5S RNA gene expression. The change to almost exclusive somatic 5S RNA gene expression by gastrulation occurs using either the TFIIIA that was synthesized by oocyte and/or TFIIIA synthesized from maternal mRNA.
