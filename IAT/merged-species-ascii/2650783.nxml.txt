Background

###begin p 3
The cell-cell adhesion molecule cadherin-11 is important in embryogenesis and bone morphogenesis, invasion of cancer cells, lymphangiogenesis, homing of cancer cells to bone, and rheumatoid arthritis. However, very little is known about the regulation of cadherin-11 expression.

Methodology/Principal Findings
###end title 4
###begin p 5
Here we show that cell density and GSK-3beta regulate cadherin-11 levels in cancer cells. Inactivation of GSK3beta with lithium chloride or the GSK3 inhibitor BIO and GSK3beta knockdown with siRNA repressed cadherin-11 mRNA and protein levels. RNA Polymerase II chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments showed that inhibition of GSK3 does not affect cadherin-11 gene transcription. Although the cadherin-11 3'UTR contains putative microRNA target sites and is regulated by Dicer, its stability is not regulated by GSK3 inhibition or density. Our data show that GSK3beta regulates cadherin-11 expression in two ways: first a beta-catenin-independent regulation of cadherin-11 steady state mRNA levels, and second a beta-catenin-dependent effect on cadherin-11 3'UTR stability and protein translation.

Conclusions
###end title 6
###begin p 7
Cadherin-11 mRNA and protein levels are regulated by the activity of GSK3beta and a significant degree of this regulation is exerted by the GSK3 target, beta-catenin, at the level of the cadherin-11 3'UTR

Cadherin-11, also known as OB-cadherin was first identified in mouse osteoblasts and is normally expressed in cells with a mesenchymal phenotype and of mesodermal origin, including the mesenchyme of the kidney and brain during development [1]. Cadherin-11 is also expressed in cartilage synoviocytes and is an important mediator of the synoviocyte reaction that characterizes rheumatoid arthritis [2], [3]. The cadherin-11 knockout mouse exhibits bone and behavioral abnormalities and is resistant to induction of rheumatoid arthritis [2], [3]. Additionally, cadherin-11 is expressed in several types of cancer including breast and prostate cancers, osteosarcoma, and colon cancer [4]-[8]. In these cancers cadherin-11 expression is associated with the most aggressive and most metastatic cancer cells.

Little is known about the regulation of cadherin-11 expression. TGFbeta1 regulates cadherin-11 in cultured extravillous cytotrophoblasts, and progesterone, but not 17-beta-estradiol, regulates cadherin-11 in cultured endometrial stromal cells undergoing decidualization [9], [10]. During development cadherin-11 is expressed in cranial neural crest cells of the developing Xenopus embryo, and XWnt-8 overexpression increases Xcadherin-11 mRNA in Xenopus animal cap cells [11], [12].

The principle pathway associated with canonical Wnt signaling involves inhibition of GSK3. GSK3 is intricately involved in many pathways essential to cellular function. Other mechanisms that also negatively regulate GSK3beta include GSK3beta phosphorylation on Ser9 by Akt and inhibition by LiCl treatment and 6-bromoindirubin-3'-oxime (BIO) treatment [18]-[20]. In the absence of canonical Wnts, GSK3 binds and phosphorylates beta-catenin, in a multi-protein complex including axin, adenomatous polyposis coli (APC), and protein phosphatase 2A. Phosphorylation by GSK3beta results in beta-catenin protein degradation [13]-[15]. In the presence of canonical Wnts, activated Disheveled prevents GSK3-dependent phosphorylation of beta-catenin [17].

In this study we use breast cancer cells with low levels of endogenous activated GSK-3 and beta-catenin and prostate cancer cells with constitutively activated GSK-3 and beta-catenin to show that, GSK3beta regulates cadherin-11 expression in two ways. The first mechanism is through beta-catenin-independent regulation of steady state cadherin-11 mRNA levels. The second mechanism involves a beta-catenin-dependent effect on cadherin-11 3'UTR stability and protein translation.

MDA-MB-231 cells, a mesenchymal-like breast cancer cell line that expresses cadherin-11, have undetectable levels of other cadherins and low levels of activated beta-catenin. In pilot experiments we noticed that cadherin-11 expression varied noticeably depending on the number of cells plated. Figure 1 shows that cells grown at higher cell densities had markedly increased cadherin-11 mRNA (Figure 1A) and protein (Figure 1B) expression on a per cell basis compared to those grown at low density. In Xenopus laevis, cadherin-11 is regulated by xWnt8, although it is not known if the cadherin-11 gene is a direct transcriptional target or if either the canonical or non-canonical pathways are involved [11]. To test if the canonical Wnt pathway regulates cadherin-11 in MDA-MB-231 cells, we treated cells with lithium chloride (LiCl), an inhibitor of GSK3beta. LiCl treatment repressed cadherin-11 mRNA and protein levels and blocked the effects of increased cell density (Figure 1A, B). Cadherin-11 protein levels were also inhibited by LiCl in three other cell-lines (BT549, Hs578t and PC-3 Figure 1C). Remarkably, N-cadherin, which is endogenously expressed by these cell-lines and not by MDA-MB-231 cells, was unaffected by LiCl, strongly indicating that inhibition of GSK3beta specifically regulated cadherin-11 expression. If the effects of LiCl are due to transient inhibition of GSK3beta we anticipated that removal of LiCl should reverse its effects on cadherin 11. Figure 1D shows that this is indeed the case as cadherin-11 levels returned to control values 12 hours following LiCl washout. To confirm that the effects of LiCl were related to inhibition of GSK3beta, we treated cells with 6-bromoindirubin-3'-oxime (BIO), a small molecule kinase inhibitor selective for GSK3alpha/beta (Figure 1E, F). Inhibition of GSK3beta with BIO stabilized beta-catenin, and like LiCl, reduced cadherin-11 mRNA and protein accumulation. Furthermore, siRNA directed against GSK3beta mRNA decreased cadherin-11 protein expression in the absence of either LiCl or BIO in MDA-MB-231 but not in PC-3 cells (Figure 1G). Therefore, GSK3beta knockdown had little effect on cadherin-11 levels in PC-3 cells (Figure 1G). Unlike MDA-231 cells, PC-3 cells have high levels of nuclear activated beta-catenin as a result of a PTEN mutation and constitutive inactivation of GSK3beta [21]. Consequently, removal of GSK3beta in these cells may have less effect as it is already inactivated.

To test if GSK3beta regulates cadherin-11 expression at the level of transcription, MDA-MB-231 cells were treated with the RNA polymerase II inhibitor, actinomycin D and were compared to the results of cells treated with LiCl. Figure 2A shows that cadherin-11 mRNA levels declined following either LiCl or actinomycin D treatment. However, in this experiment, and on other occasions, we noticed that LiCl treatment repressed cadherin-11 mRNA levels more rapidly than actinomycin D suggesting an additional non-transcriptional level of regulation. If the effects of GSK3beta inhibition on cadherin-11 mRNA have a transcriptional component, we would anticipate that recruitment of RNA polymerase II to the cadherin-11 gene to decrease. To test this hypothesis, we carried out RNA polymerase II chromatin immunoprecipitation assays (Pol II ChIP) using cadherin-11 specific primers which amplify a portion of intron 1 (see Materials and Methods). Figure 2B shows that, as expected, actinomycin D markedly reduced the amount of Pol II recruited to both GAPDH and the cadherin-11 gene. However, even though cadherin-11 mRNA levels are markedly reduced by treatment of cells with BIO (Figure 1) it did not affect Pol II recruitment to the cadherin-11 gene (Figure 2B). In other experiments we found that members of the Snail/Slug family, transcriptional repressors known to be regulated by GSK3beta and by beta-catenin are not involved in cadherin-11 repression (Figure S1) [22]. Taken together these experiments indicate that inhibition of GSK3beta by LiCl or BIO influences cadherin-11 mRNA and protein levels by mechanisms largely independent of transcriptional repression.

In many situations regulation of mRNA stability and its capacity for translation are mediated by the 3'-untranslated region (UTR). If the cadherin-11 3'-UTR is important in the normal regulation of cadherin-11 expression we might expect it to be conserved across species. Table 1 shows the percent identity of the human cadherin-11 and E-cadherin transcripts and 3'-UTRs compared with other species. Remarkably for a region that is not translated the cadherin-11 3'-UTR was almost completely conserved across species (94% human with mouse). In contrast the E-cadherin-3'UTR is poorly conserved (17% human with mouse). Analysis of the secondary structure of this region of both the cadherin-11 and E-cadherin 3'UTRs revealed a high degree of stem loop structures (Figure 3B and Figure 3C). These observations strongly suggest that the cadherin-11 3'UTR has a conserved regulatory function.

The NCBI database identifies a region of the cadherin 3'UTR which spans approximately 1 kb and includes a traditional poly-A signal and site. However, the Ensembl database identifies a cadherin-11 3'UTR of roughly 3 kb which includes a second poly A signal 2363 bp from the stop codon (Figure 3A). The poly-A signal sequences (AAUAAA) within the 3'UTR are bolded in Figure 3A. Blue highlighted sequences indicate Shaw-Kamens sequences, also known as AU-rich elements (AREs [Shaw and Kamen, 1986]). Many microRNA binding elements also exist in the cadherin-11 3'UTR (too numerous to indicate) as determined by ARGONAUTE 2 and miRanda. To determine the actual length of the cadherin-11 3'UTR, total RNA was isolated from PC3 metastatic prostate cancer cells (Figure 3D), MDA-MB-231 cells (data not shown), and MRC5 lung fibroblast cells (data not shown) for analysis. Primers were designed approximately every 500 bp of the Ensembl sequence to make progressively shorter PCR products. In all three cell lines primers designed to produce a PCR product of 1451 bp amplify a product, but the primers designed to make a product of 1952 bp do not (Figure 3D). Although, this 501bp does not include a poly-A signal or addition site one does exist at position 2363 indicating that this longer transcript may be an alternate 3'-UTR.

To investigate the function of the cadherin-11 3'-UTR, it was cloned from MDA-MB-231 genomic DNA. A series of stop codons were included at the 5'-end of the construct followed by the DNA sequence directly 3' to exon 13, the 3'-UTR. Both the NCBI and Ensembl 3'UTRs were cloned using the red highlighted primer sequences in Figure 3A into a luciferase reporter vector and named luc-CDH11 3'UTR NCBI and luc-CDH11 3'UTR Ensembl, respectively.

In cadherin-11 positive PC-3 and MDA-231 cells both luc-CDH11 3'UTR NCBI and luc-CDH11 3'UTR Ensembl were significantly less active than pGL3, which has the SV40 poly A addition signal and site (Figure 4A). In HEK293 cells which do not express cadherin-11, luc-CDH11 3'UTR Ensembl was more active than either control vector or luc-CDH11 3'UTR NCBI (Figure 4A). These data indicate that the both cadherin-11 3'UTRs confer destabilization properties when expressed in cells which normally make cadherin-11. In contrast, in HEK293 cells, which do not normally make cadherin-11, luc-CDH11 3'UTR Ensembl but not luc-CDH11 3'UTR NCBI is stabilizing.

To investigate if microRNA influenced the activity of luc-CDH11 3'-UTR we knocked down Dicer, which is essential for the production of microRNAs. Removal of Dicer significantly increased the activity of luc-CDH11 3'-UTR indicating that microRNAs regulate the endogenous activity of the cadherin-11 3'-UTR (Figure 4B). Consistent with a role for miRNA, several putative miRNA binding sites exist in this region, however, none of these predicted miRNAs was regulated by inhibition of GSK3beta (Figure S2). These data demonstrate that although miRNAs can regulate luc-CDH11 3'-UTR this is not the mechanism whereby GSK3beta inhibition regulated cadherin-11 mRNA levels. Unlike siRNAs, which always direct mRNA degradation, miRNAs often regulate protein translation without affecting mRNA levels [23]-[25]. To test this we examined the effects of Dicer knockdown on cadherin-11 protein and mRNA levels. Figures 4C and 4D show that even in the face of Dicer knockdown, endogenous cadherin-11 mRNA and protein levels were unchanged and the repressive effects of LiCl were not reversed. These data indicate that although the basal activity of the cadherin-11 3'UTR is affected by Dicer knockdown, cadherin-11 mRNA and protein levels are not.

Perhaps the best known substrate of GSK3beta is beta-catenin and many studies have shown that Wnt-mediated inhibition of GSK3beta stabilizes and activates cytoplasmic beta-catenin [17], [26]. Although the effects of inhibition of GSK3beta on cadherin-11 are not mediated transcriptionally it is possible that stabilization of beta-catenin may repress cadherin-11 mRNA and/or protein levels using an alternative mechanism. To test this PC-3 cells, which normally express high levels of activated beta-catenin, were transfected with luc-CDH11 3'UTR Ensembl or luc-CDH11 3'UTR NCBI and treated with beta-catenin siRNA [21]. Like Dicer knockdown, knockdown of beta-catenin significantly increased the activity/stability of both cadherin-11 3'UTR reporters (Figure 5A). However, in contrast to Dicer knockdown, removal of beta-catenin significantly increased cadherin-11 protein and steady state mRNA levels in PC-3 cells (Figure 5C).

The majority of patients dying from breast or prostate cancer have metastases to the skeleton. Although bone metastases are incurable, patients survive several years suffering serious morbidity, including fractures, spinal cord compression, severe bone pain, and hypercalcemia [5], [27]. In the adult, cadherin-11 is strongly expressed in bone as well as certain metastatic cancers, particularly those inclined to metastasize to bone [4], [6], [27]. Once in the bone, it is possible that these cadherin-11-expressing tumor cells activate either osteoclasts or osteoblasts, depending on the type of cancer metastasis, leading to bone remodeling. As the bone is remodeled, growth factors are released into the matrix further stimulating the tumor cells by creating a fertile environment for growth. These changes are reminiscent of those that occur during rheumatoid arthritis, a disease that is also characterized by an important role for cadherin-11 in the activated synoviocyte [2], [3]. Given its role in these important diseases we sought to determine how cadherin-11 expression is regulated. In the present study we show that cadherin-11 mRNA and protein levels are increased by high cell density and are markedly regulated by the activity of the ubiquitous serine/threonine kinase GSK3beta. Remarkably, a significant degree of regulation is exerted by the GSK3beta target, beta-catenin, at the level of the cadherin-11 3'UTR.

The best studied mechanism by which GSK3beta is regulated is Akt-dependent serine phosphorylation. Growth factors, such as insulin, activate the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt pathway. PI3K converts PIP2 to PIP3, a critical step necessary for the activation of PKB/Akt. PTEN is a phosphatase commonly mutated in cancers that is necessary for the dephosphorylation of PIP3 thereby inhibiting Akt activation. Once activated Akt acts on many cellular proteins including mTOR, caspase 9, Bad, IKK, and GSK3beta. Akt phosphorylates GSK3beta on serine 9 and GSK3alpha on serine 21 to inhibit their kinase activity. Understanding GSK3beta regulation by the Akt pathway is important to the present study because a PTEN mutation in PC-3 prostate cancer cells results in activated Akt, GSK3beta inhibition, and activation of endogenous beta-catenin [28]. Importantly, GSK3beta is central to the promotion of inflammation in various inflammatory diseases including colitis and arthritis [29], [30]. The second well-defined mechanism of GSK3beta regulation is the canonical Wnt pathway in which inhibition of GSK3beta and stabilization of beta-catenin results in marked changes in gene expression. Although many studies have observed that Wnt-GSK3beta-mediated activation of beta-catenin results in accumulation of nuclear and cytoplasmic beta-catenin, most studies concentrate on the function of beta-catenin as a transcriptional co-activator of TCF, and more recently nuclear receptors, in the nucleus [31]-[33]. However, beta-catenin has significant homology to the RNA binding protein pumilio and several recent studies have pointed to an important role for beta-catenin in post-transcriptional regulation [34]. For example, beta-catenin regulates VEGF-D, cyclooxygenase-2 and cyclin D1 mRNA stability potentially by interaction with their respective 3'-UTRs [35]-[38]. beta-catenin can also regulate alternative splicing of estrogen receptor beta (ERbeta) in colon cancer cells [35]-[38]. The ribosome-associated factor eIF6 associates with beta-catenin and the complex may have a role in translational regulation in concert with miRNAs [39], [40]. However, although the endogenous activity of the cadherin-11 3'-UTR is regulated by Dicer, cadherin-11 mRNA and protein regulation by GSK3beta are not, ruling out a role for miRNAs in this process. Our data show that the activity of the cadherin-11 3'-UTR is regulated by beta-catenin in cells which normally express activated beta-catenin such as PC-3 prostate cancer cells. Taken together these data point to an important role for GSK3beta and beta-catenin in cadherin-11 mRNA and protein homeostasis and may lead to the development of therapeutics for diseases such as, metastatic prostate and breast cancer and rheumatoid arthritis, that are characterized by elevated cadherin-11. Indeed inhibition of GSK3beta or ablation of the GSK3beta gene ameliorates inflammation dependent arthritis [29].
