The DNA sequence of the early coding region of polyoma virus is presented. It consists of 2739 nucleotides. The sequence predicts that more than one reading frame can be used to code for the three known polyoma virus early proteins (designated small, middle and large T-antigens). From the DNA sequence, the 'splicing' signals used in the processing of viral RNA to functional messenger RNAs can be predicted, as well as the sizes and sequences of the three proteins. Other unusual aspects of the DNA sequence are noted. Comparisons are made between the DNA sequences and the predicted amino acid sequences of the respective large T-antigens of polyoma virus and the related virus Simian Virus (SV) 40.
