The genetically unstable Mutator Strain of D. melanogaster is characterised by a high frequency of spontaneous mutations and their reversions. Three forked mutants were obtained independently and several reversions arose spontaneously with frequency of 10(-3)-10(-4). The sites of integration and excision of the gypsy retrotransposon were analysed by Southern blot analysis and sequencing of PCR fragments. In all cases gypsy had inserted at the end of the third exon of the major transcript of the forked gene, causing the duplication of TCCA target sequence. All the reversions resulted from precise excision of the gypsy. A double mutant containing ct6 and f1, caused by gypsy insertions into untranslated regions of the corresponding genes, was constructed. Two spontaneous ct6f+ revertants as well as one ct+f1 revertant were obtained from this line. Sequence analysis of gypsy integration and excision sites revealed that in all cases gypsy excision was also precise. These experiments constitute the first demonstration of precise excision of LTR-containing elements from their host genomes.
