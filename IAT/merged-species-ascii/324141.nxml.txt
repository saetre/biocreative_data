A nucleotide sequence of 2271 basepairs has been determined from cloned E. coli DNA which contains ompA. Withing that sequence, starting at nucleotide 1037, an open translational reading frame encodes a protein of 367 amino acids which starting with amino acid 22 agrees with the primary structure of protein II. The preceeding 21 amino acids constitute a typical signal sequence. There is a non-translated region of 360 nucleotides in front of the translational start. The insertion point of an IS1 element 110 nucleotides upstream from the start codon and an amber codon at the position of amino acid residue 28 have been localized in the DNA from two ompA mutants.
