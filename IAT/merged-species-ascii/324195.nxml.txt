The distal region of the Escherichia coli ribosomal RNA operon rrnD has been sequenced to identify transfer RNA genes which might be contained within this transcriptional unit, and to define a possible transcription termination site. A nucleotide sequence corresponding to the gene for tRNA1thr is located between two genes for 5S rRNA. The spacer region between the proximal 5S rRNA gene and the tRNA1thr gene is 12 base pairs long, whereas the spacer region between the distal 5S rRNA gene and the tRNA1thr gene is 37 base pairs. Possible sites for RNA processing are discussed, and the sequence of the tRNA1thr gene is found to possess the same anticodon as the tRNA3thr gene. A putative transcription termination site for rrnD was located about 25 base pairs distal to the 3' end of the second 5S rRNA gene. The rrnD and rrnC terminators are compared with each other and with other prokaryotic terminators. Located at exactly the same site on the complementary strand is another putative transcription termination site for a gene being transcribed towards rrnD. The possibility of overlapping terminators is discussed.
