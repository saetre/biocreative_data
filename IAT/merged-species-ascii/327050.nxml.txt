From a human genomic library we have isolated and sequenced a beta-actin-related pseudogene (Hbeta Ac-psi l) which is free of intervening sequences. Several nucleotide insertions and deletions and translational stop codons generated within the protein-coding region indicate that this gene is functionless.
