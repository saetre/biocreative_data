We recently showed that beta-defensins have antimicrobial activity against nontypeable Haemophilus influenzae (NTHi) and that interleukin 1 alpha (IL-1 alpha) up-regulates the transcription of beta-defensin 2 (DEFB4 according to new nomenclature of the Human Genome Organization) in human middle ear epithelial cells via a Src-dependent Raf-MEK1/2-ERK signaling pathway. Based on these observations, we investigated if human middle ear epithelial cells could release IL-1 alpha upon exposure to a lysate of NTHi and if this cytokine could have a synergistic effect on beta-defensin 2 up-regulation by the bacterial components.

The studies described herein were carried out using epithelial cell lines as well as a murine model of acute otitis media (OM). Human cytokine macroarray analysis was performed to detect the released cytokines in response to NTHi exposure. Real time quantitative PCR was done to compare the induction of IL-1 alpha or beta-defensin 2 mRNAs and to identify the signaling pathways involved. Direct activation of the beta-defensin 2 promoter was monitored using a beta-defensin 2 promoter-Luciferase construct. An IL-1 alpha blocking antibody was used to demonstrate the direct involvement of this cytokine on DEFB4 induction.

Middle ear epithelial cells released IL-1 alpha when stimulated by NTHi components and this cytokine acted in an autocrine/paracrine synergistic manner with NTHi to up-regulate beta-defensin 2. This synergistic effect of IL-1 alpha on NTHi-induced beta-defensin 2 up-regulation appeared to be mediated by the p38 MAP kinase pathway.

We demonstrate that IL-1 alpha is secreted by middle ear epithelial cells upon exposure to NTHi components and that it can synergistically act with certain of these molecules to up-regulate beta-defensin 2 via the p38 MAP kinase pathway.

Following the common cold, otitis media (OM), or inflammation of the middle ear, is the most frequent illness resulting in visits to physicians and the most common cause of hearing impairment in children [1]. The majority of the cases of OM are caused by three pathogens: Streptococcus pneumoniae, nontypeable Haemophilus influenzae (NTHi) and Moraxella catarrhalis [2,3].

Bacterial adherence to mucosal surfaces is a first step in respiratory infections. NTHi, S. pneumoniae and M. catarrhalis have all been shown to adhere to human upper respiratory epithelial cells [4-10]. Li and colleagues demonstrated that NTHi binds to and activates toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2) on the surface of epithelial cells [11]. The TLRs have been shown to be involved in the activation of many host genes, including cytokines, chemokines and antimicrobial peptides such as beta-defensin 2 [12-14].

The defensins are cationic (polar) molecules with spatially separated hydrophobic and charged regions. In vitro, the defensins (at micromolar concentrations) have a broad spectrum of antimicrobial activity against bacteria, fungi, and even some enveloped viruses [15,16]. In humans and other vertebrates, the defensins can be divided into the alpha- and beta-defensin subfamilies on the basis of the position and bonding of six conserved cysteine residues. The alpha-defensins are produced by neutrophils and intestinal Paneth's cells [17]. The beta-defensins, on the other hand, are mainly produced by epithelial cells of the skin, kidneys, and trachea-bronchial lining of nearly all vertebrates [18-20]. Multiple beta-defensin genes have been identified and three have been characterized at the peptide level [21-23]. beta-defensin 1 is expressed constitutively by variety of cell types, while beta-defensin 2 expression is highly up-regulated by exposure to inflammatory stimuli such as bacterial components or proinflammatory cytokines [24,25].

We have recently shown that both human beta-defensin 1 and 2 have bactericidal /bacteriostatic activity against NTHi [26]. Moreover, in another study, we demonstrated that IL-1alpha can upregulate the transcription of beta-defensin 2 in human middle ear epithelial cells, mediated by a Src-dependent Raf-MEK1/2-ERK signaling pathway [27]. In accord with our observations, IL-1alpha has also shown to be a potent activator of beta-defensin 2 in intestinal epithelial cells [28]. Furthermore, the biological relevance of IL-1alpha as an inducer of beta-defensin 2 in the tubotympanum has been demonstrated in in vivo studies that have shown IL-1alpha to be one of the cytokines induced in a rat model of OM [29].

In the present study we demonstrate that NTHi treatment of human middle ear epithelial cells results in release of IL-1alpha and that this cytokine and NTHi can synergistically up-regulate human beta-defensin 2 (DEFB4) expression. Here, a note should be added regarding the new nomenclature of the b-defensin family of molecules . Human b-defensin 2 is now called DEFB4 and its mouse orthologue is called b-defensin 4 (Defb4). This change has created some confusion in the scientific community. Thus, to avoid confusion and remain consistent with the nomenclature used in our previous studies, will continue to refer to molecule under investigation as b-defensin 2.

NTHi strain 12, originally a clinical isolate from the middle ear fluid of a child with acute otitis media, was used in this study [30]. A single colony of NTHi was harvested from a chocolate agar plate, inoculated into 30 ml of brain heart infusion broth supplemented with nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (3.5 mug/ml) and placed in a shaking incubator overnight. The supernatant was discarded after centrifugation at 10,000 x g for 10 minutes. The pellet was resuspended in 10 ml of phosphate-buffered solution (PBS) and sonicated to lyse the bacteria. The lysate was then centrifuged at 10,000 x g for 10 min and the supernatant was collected. The protein concentration of the NTHi lysate was determined using the Bicinchoninic (BCA) protein assay and was in the range of 0.15 mg/ml.

All aspects of animal handling were performed according to approved IACUC guidelines. The mice were transtympanically inoculated with 10 mul of the NTHi lysate (1:10 dilution) after anesthesia with Ketamine (5 mg/100 g). Middle ear mucosal RNA was then harvested at 6, 9, 12 and 24 hours post inoculation by irrigation of the bulla with three, 3.5 mul Trizol washes (Invitrogen). Briefly, the mice were anesthetized using Ketamine (5 mg/100 g), and then decapitated. A small incision (1 cm) was made in the retroauricular area and the cortical bone of the bulla was exposed after dissection. A hole, sized 2 mm x 2 mm, was made using the sharp scalpel followed by irrigation of the bulla with Trizol. The total Trizol volume was then increased to 200 mul and RNA was precipitated per the manufacturer's instructions. The middle ear mucosa was inflamed in all NTHi-treated mice, but effusion was not seen in all groups. No sepsis or death occurred as a result of the experimental treatment.

Culture medium from human middle ear epithelial cells was collected 48 hours after NTHi lysate treatment and the release of cytokines was analyzed using a membrane blotted with various anti-cytokine and chemokine antibodies. IL-1alpha, MIP-1beta, IL-6, IP-10, IL-8 and RANTES were present at significantly higher levels after stimulation with NTHi lysate (Figure 1A). Additionally, NTHi lysate treatment resulted in the secretion of IL-1alpha, but not IL-1beta (data not shown). In order to test the effect of the cytokines on beta-defensin 2 mRNA levels, human middle ear epithelial cells, Hela and A549 cells were treated with IL-1alpha, MIP-1beta, IL-6, IP-10, IL-8 and RANTES. As shown in Figure 1B, only IL-1alpha treatment resulted in an up-regulation of beta-defensin 2 (DEFB4) mRNA in HMEEC and A549 cells, but not in Hela cells.

(A) Human cytokine macroarray analysis shows NTHi-induced release of cytokines by middle ear epithelial cells. Cell culture medium was harvested at 48 hrs after NTHi lysate treatment and the released cytokines were detected using asolid phase multiplexed protein assay in a sandwich ELISA format. Cells were treated with NTHi lysate (NTHi) or vehicle (No Tx). (B) Real time quantitative PCR analysis shows regulation of beta-defensin 2 (DEFB4) mRNA by cytokines and chemokines. Only IL-1alpha treatment results in an up-regulation of beta-defensin 2 (DEFB4) mRNA in HMEEC and A549 cells, but not in Hela cells.

Levels of secreted IL-1alpha were quantified by ELISA, and were at 46.0 +/- 6.1 pg/ml/106 cells and 76.8 +/- 13.9 pg/ml/106 cells (mean +/- standard deviation) after 24 and 48 hours, respectively (Figure 2A). No IL-1 protein was detectable in media from the control cells or after 4 hours. To study the time course of the induction of IL-1alpha mRNA by NTHi components, Hela, A549 and HMEEC cells were treated with the bacterial lysate and RNA was extracted from the cells at different times. As shown in Figure 2B, treatment of the cells with NTHi lysate up-regulated IL-1alpha expression in a time dependent manner in Hela, A549 and HMEEC cells. To study the effect in animals, NTHi lysate was inoculated into the mouse middle ear. The middle ear mucosa was inflamed in all NTHi-treated mice, but effusion was not noted in all cases. As shown in Figure 2C, inoculation of NTHi lysate into the middle ear resulted in the up-regulation of IL-1alpha mRNA in the mouse model.

(A) HMEEC releases IL-1alpha by treatment with NTHi lysate. Cell culture medium was collected at 4, 24 and 48 hrs after treatment. Released IL-1alpha was quantified using ELISA (ND - not detectable). Treatment with NTHi lysate up-regulates IL-1alpha expression in a time dependent manner in Hela, A549 and HMEEC cells (B). Cells were treated with NTHi lysate for 2, 4 and 8 hours, and real time quantitative PCR was performed after RNA purification and reverse transcription. Inoculation of NTHi lysate into the middle ear results in the up-regulation of IL-1alpha mRNA in the mouse model (C). Mice were transtympanically inoculated with NTHi lysate and mucosal RNA was extracted after 6, 9, 12 and 24. Control animals received PBS. The RNA samples were reverse transcribed and analyzed by real time quantitative PCR. Values are given as mean +/- standard deviation. N = 3. *: p < 0.05, **: p < 0.01.

To test if NTHi components and IL-1alpha could synergistically activate beta-defensin 2 transcription, the human beta-defensin 2 (DEFB4) promoter construct was transfected into HMEEC followed by treatment with NTHi lysate and IL-1alpha, separately or together. As shown in Figure 3, treatment of HMEEC with NTHi lysate (Figure 3A) or IL-1alpha (Figure 3B) separately resulted in an up-regulation of the beta-defensin 2 promoter activity in a dose dependent manner. Interestingly, NTHi treatment of HMEEC resulted in the up-regulation of beta-defensin 2 while Hela and A549 cells poorly responded (Figure 3C). Co-treatment of HMEEC cells with suboptimal doses IL-1alpha and NTHi lysate, however, had a synergistic effect on the activation of the beta-defensin 2 mRNA (Figure 3D) and its promoter (Figure 3E). In contrast, this synergistic effect was not noted in Hela or A549 cells (Figure 3D). Moreover, the synergistic effect in HMEEC cells was inhibited by the p38 inhibitor (SB203580), but not by the MEK inhibitor (PD98059) (Figure 4). These results suggest that unlike IL-1alpha, which up-regulates beta-defensin 2 transcription via the ERK pathway, the synergistic up-regulation of beta-defensin 2 transcription by IL-1alpha and NTHi components is mediated via the p38 MAP kinase pathway.

In order to prove that IL-1alpha was the cytokine responsible for the transcriptional activation of the beta-defensin 2 promoter, HMEEC culture medium was collected 48 hrs after treatment of the cells with the NTHi lysate, diluted 1:4 with fresh media and treated with an IL-1alpha neutralizing antibody, or with pre-immune IgG. The antibody treated medium was next added to human middle ear epithelial cells transfected with the beta-defesnisn 2 promoter construct. As shown in Figure 5, the activity of the beta-defensin 2 (DEFB4) promoter was up-regulated by conditioned medium from NTHi-treated cells. Moreover, the observed induction could be blocked with anti IL-1alpha antibody, suggesting a major role for this cytokine in the up-regulation of beta-defensin 2.

Treated medium - 1:4 dilution of the conditioned medium from cells treated with NTHi lysate for 48 hours. Control medium (Con-M) - 1:4 dilution of conditioned medium from non-treated cells. Anti-IL-1alpha antibody (20, 40 and 80 mug/ml), but not pre-immune IgG, can block the transcriptional activation of the beta-defensin 2 promoter in a dose dependent manner.

Our results suggest that middle ear epithelial cells release IL-1alpha when stimulated by NTHi components, and that this cytokine acts in an autocrine/paracrine manner to synergistically up-regulate beta-defensin 2 transcription. Furthermore, in contrast to IL-1alpha's effect on beta-defensin 2 transcription, which is mediated via the ERK MAP kinase pathway, the synergistic effect of this cytokine on beta-defensin 2 transcription by NTHi components appears to be mediated by the p38 MAP kinase pathway (Figure 6).

Our results suggest that middle ear epithelial cells release IL-1alpha when stimulated by NTHi components and that this cytokine acts in an autocrine/paracrine synergistic manner with NTHi to up-regulate beta-defensin 2. Furthermore, in contrast to IL-1alpha that acts via the ERK MAP kinase pathway to induce beta-defensin 2 transcription, the synergistic effect of this cytokine on beta-defensin 2 up-regulation by NTHi molecules appears to be mediated by the p38 MAP kinase pathway (Figure 6). Such synergism may be a way of boosting the epithelial cells' initial response to NTHi and its components.

The signaling mechanisms appear to be more complicated in the presence of both exogenous and endogenous inducers. NTHi, an exogenous inducer and TNF-alpha, an endogenous inducer synergize with each other to induce NF-kappaB activation and consequently up-regulate inflammatory mediators including IL-1beta and IL-8 as well as TNF-alpha [32]. NTHi first interacts with its receptors of host cells such as Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2) [14], and leads to the activation of multiple signaling cascades resulting in the up-regulation of inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-alpha. The up-regulated TNF-alpha in response to NTHi synergize with NTHi to induce NF-kappaB via two distinct signaling pathways, the NIK-IKK-IkappaBalpha and the MEKK1-MKK3/6-p38 MAPK pathways [32].

Strains of NTHi, a small gram-negative bacterium, exist as commensal organisms in the human nasopharynx [33]. Nasopharyngeal colonization of NTHi may persist for prolonged periods of time, even in the antibody-containing mucosal secretions since the bacteria undergo antigenic variation. This can occur by several molecular mechanisms such as point mutation, gene amplification, phase variation or horizontal gene transfer and homologous recombination [34]. Although NTHi rarely causes life-threatening infections, it is nonetheless a clinically important pathogen since it causes otitis media in children and exacerbates chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in adults [35,36]. The interactions between NTHi and the host are not well understood. These interactions determine chronic colonization with or without inflammation or disease. The interaction of NTHi antigens and specific host molecules are likely to be involved in the transition of NTHi from a commensal to a pathogenic organism. Further studies are, however, needed to elucidate these mechanisms.

Our results showed that the induction of beta-defenin 2 by NTHi is not a pan-epithelial response, in that Hela and A549 cells do not highly respond to NTHi lysates, whereas HMEEC cells do. In addition, although NTHi treatment up-regulated IL-1alpha expression in Hela, A549 and HMEEC cells, treatment of the cells with IL-1alpha resulted in the up-regulation of beta-defensin 2 only in A549 and HMEEC, but not in Hela cells. These results indicate that expression patterns of receptors or signaling molecules is cell-specific and thus determines the responses to extracellular stimuli. Our results are in agreement with earlier reports of the hypo-responsiveness of A549 cells to lipopolysaccharide (LPS), and of A549 and normal human bronchial epithelial cells to Gram-positive group B Streptococci [37,38]. A deficiency in the expression of TLR2 and 4 may also explain the lack response of these cells to NTHi as well. Our experimental observation of the non-responsiveness of Hela cells to NTHi, is on the other hand different from previous observations demonstrating transcriptional up-regulation of beta-defensin-2 by LPS [39] or activation of NF-kappaB by NTHi [14]. This apparent difference, however may be explained by Mineshiba and colleagues' use of LPS and the fact that Shuto and coworkers studied the nuclear translocation of NF-kappaB, which may not be in itself sufficient for the transcriptional activation of beta-defensin-2 in Hela cells.

Although the autolysis of NTHi has not been documented, it is likely that NTHi undergoes autolysis similar to that seen with Haemophilus influenzae type b [40], S. pneumoniae [41] or E. coli [42]. Cytoplasmic, as well as membrane components of NTHi are thought to persist in the effusion and act as long lasting inducers of inflammation. This notion is supported by the fact that bacterial DNA is detectable in most sterile effusions [43], whereas endotoxin is detectable in 60% of the cases [44]. While the molecules (possibly surface antigens) of intact NTHi have been demonstrated to induce proinflammatory cytokines in human respiratory epithelial cells [45], other studies have shown that the cytoplasmic fraction of lysed NTHi also contains important molecules for stimulating epithelial cells [46,47]. The NTHi lysate used in this study was prepared by sonification of the bacteria and mimics normal pathophysiology.

Although the acidic form, known as IL-1alpha, and the neutral form, IL-1beta, only share 45% homology at the nucleic acid level, both proteins bind to the same receptor [48,49]. Furthermore, both proteins are pleiotropic and affect processes such as inflammation, immunity and hemopoiesis. Moreover, while IL-1beta is active only in its secreted form, IL-1alpha is active as an intracellular precursor, a membrane-associated cytokine, as well as a secreted molecule.

Our results suggest a role for IL-1alpha but not IL-1beta in the up-regulation of beta-defensin 2 transcription. These results are consistent with the observations that IL-1alpha and not IL-1beta, released from epithelial cells infected with respiratory syncytial virus, enhanced expression of intercellular adhesion molecule-1 in pulmonary epithelial cells [50]. Moreover, our data suggest that the induction of IL-1alpha production in middle ear epithelial cells and the autocrine/paracrine effect of this molecule may be one of the central events involved in the up-regulation of chemotactic factors for the recruitment of immune cells into the middle ear. It should be noted that although the concentration of IL-1alpha released into the culture medium was less than 100 pg/ml/106 cells, since the molecule is acting in an autocrine manner, its effective concentration is likely to be much higher locally.

In our previous studies, we demonstrated that IL-1alpha could up-regulate beta-defensin 2 transcription via a Src-dependent MEK1/2-ERK1/2 signaling pathway [27]. Interestingly however, the present study shows that the p38 MAP kinase, not the ERK1/2 pathway is involved in synergism of IL-1alpha and NTHi components. Moreover, our preliminary results suggest that the p38 MAP kinase pathway is involved in the activation of beta-defensin 2 transcription by NTHi (unpublished data). We postulate that the activation of ERK and p38 MAP kinase pathways can result in a synergistic up-regulation of beta-defensin 2. These results point to the complexity of the signaling pathways that control the expression of innate immune molecules such as beta-defensin 2 and indicate the need for further investigation into the regulation of beta-defensin 2 by NTHi and IL-1alpha.

We demonstrate that epithelial cell-derived IL-1alpha can synergistically act with NTHi components to up-regulate human beta-defensin 2 (DEFB4) via the p38 MAP kinase pathway.
