The complete nucleotide sequence of the Escherichia coli recB gene which encodes a subunit of the ATP-dependent DNase, Exonuclease V, has been determined. The proposed coding region for the RecB protein is 3543 nucleotides long and would encode a polypeptide of 1180 amino acids with a calculated molecular weight of 133,973. The start of the recB coding sequence overlaps the 3' end of the upstream ptr gene, and the recB termination codon overlaps the initiation codon of the downstream recD gene, suggesting that these genes may form an operon. No sequences which reasonably fit the consensus for an E. coli promoter could be identified upstream of the proposed recB translational start. The predicted RecB amino acid sequence contains regions of homology with ATPases, DNA binding proteins and DNA repair enzymes.
