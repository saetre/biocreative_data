We have cloned and characterized a novel cellular gene that is promoted by an intracisternal A-particle (IAP) LTR and expressed in the mouse placenta (mouse IAP promoted placental gene, MIPP). A 1067bp cDNA clone containing an IAP LTR U5 region duplicated in its 5' terminus and an ORF coding for a potential 202 amino acids protein was isolated from an 8.5 day old mouse embryo cDNA library. Sequence analysis of the 5' region of a genomic clone revealed the presence of a solo IAP LTR with the same U5 duplication, and primer extension analysis confirmed that transcription of the MIPP gene is under the control of the IAP LTR. Expression of the MIPP gene parallels that of IAP genes in normal mouse tissues with abundant transcripts present in the placenta and also in the myeloma MOPC-315. The MIPP-encoded protein is composed of four 48-amino acid repeat units and shares homology with a vaccinia virus gene product. MIPP-related sequences were also detected in higher eukaryotic genomes including human.
