A new member of the ras genes superfamily was isolated from a cDNA library derived from a rat liver cell line (BRL-3A). The predicted 201 amino acids ras-like protein shows 30-35% homology with other members of the ras and ras-related gene products so far described. Conserved features include the GTP-binding and hydrolysis domains and the carboxyl terminal cysteine residues. A protein of the expected size (Mr 23,000) was synthesized in an in vitro transcription-translation system. The BRL-ras gene is present in single copy in the rat genome and is ubiquitously expressed at high levels in all tissues and cell lines examined.
