The function of pancreatic beta-cells is the synthesis and release of insulin, the main hormone involved in blood glucose homeostasis. Estrogen receptors, ERalpha and ERbeta, are important molecules involved in glucose metabolism, yet their role in pancreatic beta-cell physiology is still greatly unknown. In this report we show that both ERalpha and ERbeta are present in pancreatic beta-cells. Long term exposure to physiological concentrations of 17beta-estradiol (E2) increased beta-cell insulin content, insulin gene expression and insulin release, yet pancreatic beta-cell mass was unaltered. The up-regulation of pancreatic beta-cell insulin content was imitated by environmentally relevant doses of the widespread endocrine disruptor Bisphenol-A (BPA). The use of ERalpha and ERbeta agonists as well as ERalphaKO and ERbetaKO mice suggests that the estrogen receptor involved is ERalpha. The up-regulation of pancreatic insulin content by ERalpha activation involves ERK1/2. These data may be important to explain the actions of E2 and environmental estrogens in endocrine pancreatic function and blood glucose homeostasis.

Estrogen receptors are emerging as important molecules for glucose homeostasis [1]. It is known that ERalpha knock-out (ERalphaKO) mice are obese and insulin resistant [2]. ERalpha is implicated in beta-cell survival [3]. It has been reported that estrogen function deficiency in men, due to the absence of ERalpha or aromatase, results in impaired glucose metabolism to such an extent that one patient developed type II diabetes mellitus [4]. Similar abnormalities were found in aromatase-deficient (ArKO) mice [5]. Recently, it has been described that both ERalpha and ERbeta regulate the glucose transporter GLUT4 in skeletal muscle [6] and insulin sensitivity in the liver [7].

As described above, the role of estrogen receptors in glucose metabolism has been mainly studied in tissues other than the endocrine pancreas. However, the endocrine pancreas is crucial in the control of blood glucose homeostasis, because beta-cells synthesize and release insulin, the only hormone able to reduce glycaemia. Therefore, to understand how estrogens affect beta-cell adaptation to physiological situations such as pregnancy, it is essential to investigate the role of ERalpha and ERbeta in this cellular system.

In addition to the role that estrogen receptors may play in the physiology of pancreatic beta-cells, we should bear in mind that any disruption of beta-cell physiology is associated with the development of type II diabetes mellitus. Indeed, recent epidemiological reports link the existence of endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs) in blood, such as persistant organic pollutants (POPs) [8] and phthalates [9], with type II diabetes and insulin resistance. In particular, the estrogenic pollutant Bisphenol-A (BPA) was described as altering pancreatic beta-cell function and blood glucose homeostasis in mice [10].

BPA is the monomer employed to make polycarbonate plastic and resins used as lining for metal cans and as a plasticizer in other widely used plastics such as polyvinyl chloride (PVC) and polyethylene terephthalate (PET). Under normal conditions, this endocrine disruptor has been shown to leach from food and beverage containers [11], [12] as well as from dental sealants [13]. Widespread human exposure to significant amounts of BPA has been reported. For example, BPA was found in the urine of 95% of US citizens [14] and its concentration in human serum ranges from 0.2-1.6 ng/ml serum (0.88-7.0 nM) 15, 16.

The mechanism proposed for BPA actions has been based on its binding to ERalpha and ERbeta, inducing estrogenic signals that modify gene expression [17]. However, the affinity of BPA for ERs was reported to be 10,000-100,000-fold lower than that of 17beta-estradiol [18], [19] and it was shown to have a lower effect in several bioassays, such as the uterotrophic one [20]. Because of this, BPA has been considered to be a weak estrogen.

In this study, we demonstrate that doses of BPA within the range found in human serum, as well as physiological doses of E2 regulate pancreatic insulin synthesis in intact islets of Langerhans. This long-term action is mediated by the estrogen receptor ERalpha. These results shed light on the role of ERalpha in the physiology of the endocrine pancreas and its consequences on blood glucose homeostasis.

Intact islets of Langerhans from adult male mice were cultured in the presence of 11mM glucose and increasing concentrations of E2 for 48 hours. Insulin content increased following an inverted-U dose-dependent response (Fig. 1A) at doses similar to the physiological concentrations of E2 observed in the mouse during pregnancy [21] and in the proestrus stage [22]. Insulin content was also higher in the majority of single cultured beta-cells when measured with immunocytochemistry (Fig. S1). The islet cell viability remained high and similar in both E2 and vehicle-treated islets (Fig. S2). Islet area was unchanged in E2 vs. vehicle-treated islets (Fig. 1B) and no increase on BrdU incorporation was observed, indicating no replication of beta-cells in response to E2 treatment. Together, these experiments suggest that the increase in insulin content is not a consequence of an increase in beta-cell mass.

We then investigated the possibility that the modulation of insulin gene expression was responsible for the increase in insulin content in pancreatic beta-cells. A temporal expression profiling of the insulin mRNA was evaluated by quantitative real time PCR in cultured islets. As shown in figure 1D, insulin mRNA levels were induced 1.6 fold 6 hours after islets were exposed to 10nM E2. Semiquantitative RT-PCR experiments after 48 hours exposure to E2 gave essentially the same result (Fig. S3).

We next studied whether the aforementioned increase in insulin content by E2 is accompanied by an alteration in insulin secretion. The experiment in figure 2A shows that at various stimulatory glucose concentrations, islets incubated with 1 nM E2 for 48 hours secrete more insulin than those treated with vehicle. This increase in insulin release is not the consequence of an alteration in the stimulus-secretion coupling process, since no change in intracellular calcium concentration dynamics was observed in response to high glucose (Fig. 2B). None of the parameters analyzed showed significant differences, basal [Ca2+]i levels in the absence of stimuli, increment of [Ca2+]i in response to glucose (peak size) or the area under the traces, an indicator of the global Ca2+ amount entering into the islet (Fig. 2C-E).

These experiments suggest that physiological concentrations of E2 produce an increase in insulin gene expression and content along with an enhanced insulin release in response to stimulatory glucose concentrations. The results are consistent with the concept that increased insulin secretion in response to stimulatory glucose in E2-treated islets may be a consequence of their higher insulin content. Nonetheless, we cannot rule out the possibility that an effect of E2 on alpha-cells may affect insulin release [23]-[25].

To analyse if environmental estrogens act like the endogenous hormone we performed similar experiments using BPA instead of E2. Figure 3A shows a BPA-induced increase of insulin content following an inverted U-shape dose response curve, with a significant effect observed at 1 nM and 10 nM BPA when compared to vehicle exposed islets. Note that 1 nM BPA was equally effective than E2. Higher concentrations of BPA as 1 microM produced no increase in insulin content. Therefore BPA, like E2, increases pancreatic insulin content in a non-monotonic manner.

This non-monotonic behaviour of BPA occurs not only in vitro, but also in vivo. It was previously described that pancreatic insulin content increased in response to BPA in vivo[10]. In our study, mice were exposed daily to 100 microg/kg or 1 mg/kg BPA for 4 days. We then measured the insulin content of the islets isolated from BPA or vehicle-treated mice and found that the low dose of BPA increased insulin content while the high dose had no effect (Fig. 3B).

To determine whether the nuclear estrogen receptors mediate E2 and BPA effects in islets, we used the pure antiestrogen ICI182,780, that blocks both ERalpha and ERbeta. Figures 4A and B show that ICI182,780 completely blocks both E2 (Fig 4A) and BPA (Fig 4B) effects in a dose dependent manner, indicating that estrogen receptors are involved.

As an initial step towards identifying the ER used by E2 and BPA to modify insulin content, the expression of ERalpha and ERbeta was investigated in pancreatic beta-cells. RT-PCR and immunocytochemistry performed on mouse islets of Langerhans confirmed that beta-cells express both ERalpha and ERbeta (Fig. 4C-D and Fig. S4). The location of estrogen receptors in subcellular organelles is important since they trigger their actions in different cellular compartments ranging from the plasma membrane to the nucleus [26]. Both receptors have been reported in the nucleus, cytosol, mitochondria and associated to the plasma membrane [27]-[32]. We studied the location of ERalpha and ERbeta in whole islets of Langerhans using immunofluorescence and confocal microscopy. Both ERalpha and ERbeta were present in the cytoplasm and the nucleus (Fig. 4E, Fig. S5). Overall, our data suggest that both ERalpha and ERbeta are expressed in beta-cells and localized inside and outside the nucleus.

In order to evaluate which estrogen receptor is involved in the effect of 17beta-estradiol and BPA, we used the specific agonists for estrogen receptors, PPT and DPN. The ERalpha agonist PPT had the same effect on insulin content as E2 (Fig. 5A). Remarkably, the increase in insulin content by PPT mimicked the inverted-U dose response described for E2. However, the ERbeta agonist DPN produced no effect at any of the tested concentrations (Fig. 5B), indicating that the role of ERbeta in beta-cells differs from the one of ERalpha. The effect of the ERalpha agonist PPT was blocked by the antiestrogen ICI182,780 (Fig. 5C).

To unequivocally demonstrate the extent of ERalpha activation in regulating pancreatic insulin content we used islets from ERalphaKO and ERbetaKO mice [33]. The absence of ERalpha or ERbeta did not affect the non-stimulated insulin content of cultured islets when compared to wild-type mice (Fig. 6A-D). The behavior in terms of [Ca2+]i signals induced by glucose was unchanged between wild type and ERalphaKO/ERbetaKO mice (Fig. S6). This result is in agreement with the normal insulin secretion observed in islets from ERalphaKO and ERbetaKO mice [7]. Islet size was similar between islets from wild type and KO mice (12426+/-510 microm2 for ERalphaWT and 12123+/-415 microm2 for ERalphaKO; 15720+/-612 microm2 for ERbetaWT and 15977+/-764 microm2 for ERbetaKO; at least 100 islets from at least 3 different mice).

Exposure to E2 (Fig. 6A, B) or BPA (Fig. 6C, D) strongly increased insulin content in islets from wild-type mice, yet this effect was completely abolished in islets from ERalphaKO mice (Fig. 6A, C). This effect was observed in vivo, in mice treated with 100 microg/Kg/day for 4 days. No increase in insulin content was obtained in islets from E2-treated ERalphaKO mice (Fig. S7). In contrast, a strong increase in insulin content was observed in E2 and BPA cultured islets from ERbetaKO mice (Fig. 6B, D). Overall, these experiments argue strongly that ERalpha is the main estrogen receptor involved in the regulation of insulin content by both BPA and E2.

BPA has been considered a weak estrogen when acting through ERalpha and ERE. In our experiments, however, both E2 and BPA act at equal doses through ERalpha. It is unlikely that ERalpha operates via ERE, because ERE has not been described in the promoters of mouse insulin genes (types I and II) and the use of the TESS (Transcription Element Search Software) software [34] did not reveal any putative ERE. It is known that E2 works as well via alternative pathways triggered outside the nucleus that involve either PI3-Kinase or ERKs activation [35], [36].

To investigate the involvement of alternative pathways, such as the MAPK one, we measured the activation of ERK1/2 in response to PPT. Using antibodies against phosphorylated ERK1/2, we obtained increased levels of activated ERK1/2 15 minutes after treatment with the ERalpha agonist PPT (Fig. 7A and B). Activation of ERK1/2 occurs in the cytoplasm with no apparent translocation of activated ERK1/2 to the nucleus (Fig 7A). As shown in figure 4D, ERalpha is located in the cytoplasm as well.

Next, we investigated the role that ERKs may have in regulating pancreatic insulin content following ERalpha activation. We exposed cultured islets to either 1 nM of the ERalpha specific agonist PPT, BPA or E2, in the presence of specific inhibitors of ERK1/2, c-Src and PI3K (Fig. 7C). The graph shows that the increase in insulin content by the three ERalpha ligands was completely abolished by the ERK1/2 blocker PD98059. The c-Src inhibitor PP1 showed a tendency to also inhibit the effect of the ERalpha agonists in insulin content, although it is only statistically significant in the case of BPA. These experiments point to the possible involvement of ERK1/2 in the ERalpha regulation of insulin content.

Discussion

###begin p 45
The present work points to a significant role of ERalpha in the regulation of insulin synthesis by estrogens. Long-term exposure to physiological levels of E2 and environmentally relevant doses of BPA up-regulates pancreatic insulin content through a mechanism involving activation of ERalpha.
###end p 45
###begin p 46
Results presented here suggest that E2-induced increase of pancreatic insulin content was a consequence of an up-regulation of insulin mRNA levels rather than an increase of beta-cell viability or beta-cell mass.

###xml 162 166 <span type="species:ncbi:10090">mice</span>
Converging evidence from experiments performed with specific ERs agonists, PPT and DPN, the antiestrogen ICI182,780, as well as the use of ERalphaKO and ERbetaKO mice, have demonstrated that both E2 and BPA up-regulation of insulin content is mediated by ERalpha.

Despite the fact that ERalphaKO mice are insulin resistant [1], islets from both ERalphaKO and ERbetaKO mice presented normal Ca2+ signals in response to glucose, indicating that the stimulus secretion coupling was unaltered. Consequently, insulin secretion in response to glucose in these islets was unchanged when compared to WT [7]. Islet area was similar between WT and KO mice indicating that beta-cell mass was unaffected. Furthermore, insulin content after 48 hours culture was unaltered in control conditions for both ERalphaKO and ERbetaKO mice. E2 or BPA increase insulin content in cultured islets from WT and ERbetaKO mice, while it remained unchanged in islets from ERalphaKO mice. The absence of effect of E2 in increasing insulin content in ERalphaKO mice was observed in vivo when mice were treated for 4 days.

The effect of both E2 and BPA occurs following an inverted-U shape dose-response curve, being significant at doses as low as 100pM-1 nM. The use of the specific ERalpha agonist PPT suggests that the sole activation of ERalpha is enough to provoke this inverted-U dose response. The absence of effect of high BPA exposure was observed in vivo. Although the action of BPA observed in vivo may reflect the in vitro effect, we must take into account that a regulation of other parameters by BPA may also contribute, these include blood glucose and insulin levels as well as insulin sensitivity. This non-monotonic response has been described in other cellular systems and has important implications for the risk assessment of endocrine disruptors, since standard testing of xenobiotic estrogenic chemicals only involves testing a few very high doses [37]-[39].

In the past, BPA was considered a "weak" estrogen because of its low binding affinity to both ERalpha and ERbeta [18], [19], as well as for having a low transcriptional activity through these ERE binding receptors [40]. It is rather surprising that the low levels used in our work have such a large effect, the same as E2, on insulin content up-regulation. Examples of low dose effects of BPA have been reported in a wide variety of tissues and cell types [20], [37], [41], although the mechanisms of action to explain them are still unclear. One explanation to be considered is that BPA may act via ERalpha through mechanisms other than binding to ERE, through other transcription factors binding to their respective response elements [42]. Our data indicate that in beta-cells, ERalpha is located inside and outside the nucleus and it is known that outside the nucleus it can activate protein kinases [43], [44]. It is therefore plausible that ERalpha activation by BPA occurs at low doses when the response is initiated outside the nucleus through alternative signalling pathways [26], [36], [45]. Our results indicate that ERalpha activation by the specific ERalpha agonist PPT rapidly activates ERK1/2. In addition, increment of pancreatic insulin content by PPT, E2 and BPA was blocked by the ERK1/2 inhibitor PD98059.

It is documented that insulin gene transcription is regulated by ERK1/2 [46], [47]. It is also well established that E2 induces rapid responses through alternative mechanisms that involve ERalpha and ERKs [26], [35], [36], [48]. Activation of ERKs by low doses of BPA has also been reported in rat cerebellar cortex [49].

In addition to the action of BPA described above, the present report demonstrates that 17beta-estradiol increases pancreatic beta-cell insulin mRNA levels, insulin content and insulin secretion at levels within the range reached during pregnancy and at proestrus stage [21], [22]. During pregnancy, islets adapt to the increased demand for insulin undergoing major changes in their structure and function. Among these changes, the increase of insulin synthesis [50], [51] is of great importance. Our results indicate that E2 acting through ERalpha may be an important hormone involved in endocrine pancreas adaptation during pregnancy.

It is important to note that E2-increased insulin content and secretion will be beneficial when it occurs during an appropriate period of time and at doses within the physiological range. This may happen during pregnancy. However, if this estrogenic action occurs at an inappropriate time, or at doses out of the physiological levels, it may cause adverse effects such as insulin resistance [10]. This may happen when there is an exposure to an environmental estrogen, such as BPA, which causes insulin resistance in healthy male mice [10]. Therefore the ERalpha mediated increase of insulin content by BPA in pancreatic beta-cells may contribute to the BPA-provoked insulin resistance demonstrated in vivo[10].

Data were acquired using ORCA software from Hamamatsu (Hamamatsu Photonics, Barcelona, Spain). Fluorescence changes are expressed as the ratio of fluorescence at 340nm and 380 nm (F340/F380). Results were plotted and analyzed using commercially available software (Sigmaplot, Jandel Scientific).

Islets isolated as previously described were fixed with Bouin's solution for 5 min and washed with PBS. Then, they were dehydrated with 30, 50, and 70% ethanol, for 3 min each, and washed with PBS. After this, islets were treated with 0.5% Triton X-100 for 15 min and then washed with PBS. The non-specific staining was blocked with PBS supplemented with 0.1% Triton X-100 and 5% serum from the same host as the secondary antibody used. After the islets had been incubated for 1h at room temperature, primary antibodies were added to the blocking solution. These were: anti-insulin (1:200, I2018, Sigma), anti-ERalpha, G-20 (1:100, sc-544, Santa Cruz), and anti-ERbeta, L-20 (1:100, sc-6822, Santa Cruz). The islets were incubated overnight with the primary antibodies at 4degreesC, except for the anti-ERbeta, which was kept for 2 days at 4degreesC. Secondary antibodies (Alexa Fluor(R) Molecular Probes) were used at 1:1000 in PBS+0.1% Triton X-100+1% serum from the same host as the secondary antibody, for 1h at room temperature. To stain mitochondria, live islets were previously incubated with 500nM Mitotracker(R) Red CMXRos (Molecular Probes) for 30 min, then washed with PBS and fixed as described. To label nuclei, 1 microM ethidium homodimer-1 (Molecular Probes) was used for 15 min at room temperature at the end of the protocol. To stain the plasma membrane, 1 microg/ml wheat germ agglutinin-tetramethylrhodamine was used (Molecular Probes) and added at the same time as the primary antibody. A confocal Zeiss Pascal 5 microscope and a Zeiss 10X objective (numerical aperture = 0.3) were used too obtain images for quantification; a Zeiss 40X objective (numerical aperture = 1.3) was used for the rest. The images were analyzed using LSM Zeiss software (Zeiss, Jena, Germany). Immunofluorescence intensity was measured in the plane with maximum fluorescence. The results were expressed as average pixel intensity and normalized with respect to the mean value of the pixel intensity of vehicle-treated islets.

The Live/Dead(R) Viability/Cytotoxicity kit for mammalian cells (Molecular Probes) was used to test the viability of the islets of Langerhans after being cultured for 48h. The manufacturer's instructions were followed. After 48h in culture with vehicle or 1 nM E2, islets were incubated with 2 microM calcein and 4 microM ethidium homodimer-1 for at least 30 min at room temperature, while gently being shaken. Then the islets were examined using the previously mentioned confocal microscope and the 40X objective. Images of 2.5 microm sections of whole islets were taken every 3 microm and the number of dead cells per islet were counted as nuclei stained with ethidium homodimer-1.
