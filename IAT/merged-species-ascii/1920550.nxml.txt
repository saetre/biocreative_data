To identify malaria antigens for vaccine development, we selected alpha-helical coiled coil domains of proteins predicted to be present in the parasite erythrocytic stage. The corresponding synthetic peptides are expected to mimic structurally "native" epitopes. Indeed the 95 chemically synthesized peptides were all specifically recognized by human immune sera, though at various prevalence. Peptide specific antibodies were obtained both by affinity-purification from malaria immune sera and by immunization of mice. These antibodies did not show significant cross reactions, i.e., they were specific for the original peptide, reacted with native parasite proteins in infected erythrocytes and several were active in inhibiting in vitro parasite growth. Circular dichroism studies indicated that the selected peptides assumed partial or high alpha-helical content. Thus, we demonstrate that the bioinformatics/chemical synthesis approach described here can lead to the rapid identification of molecules which target biologically active antibodies, thus identifying suitable vaccine candidates. This strategy can be, in principle, extended to vaccine discovery in a wide range of other pathogens.

Human Plasmodium falciparum (Pf) infection is a dramatic public health problem. Today approximately forty percent of the world's population is at risk of malaria. Malaria causes more than 300 million acute clinical cases, and at least one million deaths annually. Ninety percent of malaria deaths occur in sub-Saharan African countries mostly among young children and pregnant women (). Thus, there is an urgent need of a malaria vaccine. However, vaccine discovery, in general and particularly in malaria, is still a very empirical process. In fact, protective antigens do not bear any structural, physico-chemical or sequence-related characteristics that would allow their identification. For protective humoral responses, the only recognized characteristics of antigens are their antigenicity/immunogenicity and accessibility. In addition, the lack of surrogate markers of protection renders the vaccine discovery process difficult and time consuming. Hence, in spite of a constant and impressive progress in molecular biology techniques and antigen identification and expression [1], [2], vaccine discovery is still labor-intensive, making the approach fastidious, costly and poorly adapted to high-throughput screening. Proper protein folding and solubility remain a limitation in numerous cases. Thus, overcoming the bottlenecks of manufacturing and identification of fragments/proteins, as possible targets of a protective immune response still constitute a scientific and technical challenge.

We addressed this challenge by combining bioinformatics, chemical peptide synthesis and functional protection assays. We focused on the search for alpha-helical coiled coil motifs that, in general, do not exhibit a folding problem, and are a target of effective antibodies for several current malaria vaccine candidates (eg. LSA-1 [3], LSA-3 [4], MSP-3 [5], and MSP-6 [6] and other pathogens [7]. MSP-1, another leading malaria vaccine [8], also contains predicted alpha-helical coiled coil regions (unpublished results). Our choice was based on the following considerations. First, the alpha-helical coiled coil motif bears a characteristic seven amino acid residue repeat (abcdefg)n with hydrophobic residues located in a and d positions and hydrophilic residues generally elsewhere. This motif can be easily identified by bioinformatic analysis. Secondly, an important known characteristic of the alpha-helical coiled coil domains is that, taken separately from the whole protein, they frequently and readily fold into the same stable oligomeric structure [9]. Thirdly, for this reason, the alpha-helical coiled coil fragments are frequently recognized by conformational dependent antibodies, and can similarly elicit antibodies reactive with structurally "native" epitopes. In addition, these domains are short (about 40 residues) and can be rapidly produced by chemical synthesis. Furthermore, when the antibodies have an anti-parasite biological activity, this designates the corresponding proteins/fragments as potential, novel vaccine candidates to be further developed and assessed. Here, we focus on the Pf parasite erythrocytic stage, a target of protective antibodies and describe a straightforward, rapid procedure based on bioinformatic analysis of alpha-helical coiled-coil motifs and peptide synthesis.

The screening of the Pf genome [10] using generalized sequence profiles [11] identified several hundred proteins containing putative alpha-helical coiled coil motifs. Through proteome and transcriptome data [12]-[14] we assessed which of these molecules are expressed in the Pf parasite erythrocytic stage. The combined analysis/assessment identified over 100 segments associated with this stage and displaying the putative alpha-helical coiled coil motifs with high probability score (Table S1). Out of these alpha-helical coiled coil fragments, in general 30-40 amino acids long, present either in the same protein or in different ones, 95 were chemically synthesized and HPLC purified. Among them, longer peptides (up to 70 amino acids), which contained one or more alpha-helical coiled coil domains, were also synthesized (antigenS 1, 12 and 83; Table S1). The selected antigens were then tested in ELISA assays for reactivity with three panels of sera obtained from adult donors from Burkina Faso, Tanzania and Colombia, respectively. To our surprise, all of the alpha-helical coiled coil fragments were antigenic, though the prevalence of responders varied greatly (Tables 1 and S1). In this manner, 71 proteins were identified whose lengths varied from 200 to 10,000 amino acids. Twenty-one peptides with the highest prevalence of responders and ELISA mean OD value were selected for further studies. Variation in recognition among the three panels of sera may be due to differences in the genetic background of the hosts, of the parasites and, most likely, to distinct malaria transmission conditions in the three regions. The high level of recognition of the alpha-helical coiled coil motifs may be explained by the fact that taken separately from the whole protein these fragments readily fold into the same stable structure in aqueous solution.

Indeed, circular dichroism (CD) studies of selected peptides associated with biological activities (Tables 1 and 2) indicate that they predominantly assume an alpha-helical conformation in water. Peptides 14, 27 and 45 (Figure S1A) exhibit a CD pattern characteristic of a high alpha-helical content, whereas the remaining peptides show CD profiles similar to that shown for peptide 12 (Figure S1B) or intermediate between those shown in Figures S1A and S1B characteristic of a partial alpha-helical organization. When analyzed by size exclusion chromatography on FPLC columns, peptides presented elution profiles between those exhibited by chymotrypsin and ribonuclease (MW 24 and 13kDa, respectively). The CD and size exclusion chromatography results suggest that peptides adopt an alpha-helical coiled-coil structure, which need to be unambiguously ascertained by NMR and ultra-centrifugation studies.

To test the biological activity of peptide-specific antibodies, the latter were purified by affinity chromatography using three serum pools obtained from Papua New Guinean adults. The 3 serum pools were first tested in ELISA assays against 21 peptides that were the most antigenic (Table 1); from these, 18 peptide-specific antibodies were purified from the most positive serum pool and tested again in ELISA. These 18 antibodies all reacted with parasite native proteins in infected red blood cells as shown by IFAT (Figure 1A; Table 2). Reactivity was restricted to blood stages, since the antibodies did not react with sporozoites stages (data not shown), and this reactivity was also peptide-specific as shown by IFAT competition assays with the corresponding peptide (Figure 1A).

The specificity of the antibodies obtained was investigated in detail, particularly since several peptides contain glutamic acid (Glu)-rich sequences which are known to generate cross reactivity among several malarial Glu-rich proteins [15]. Cross-reactions were systematically investigated using each of the 18 affinity-purified antibodies on each of the 18 peptides. Results show that -with few exceptions- each antibody preferentially recognizes the peptide against which antibodies were affinity-purified, i.e. they are specific for the corresponding peptide (Table S2). To determine if non-specific antibody binding to solid phase-adsorbed antigens could be responsible for the rare cross-reactivities detected, ELISA competition assays were performed. To this end, binding of antibodies to the solid phase-adsorbed antigen was competed against increasing concentrations of the homologous or cross-reacting peptides. Only homologous peptides competed best whereas peptides having sequence similarity did not (Figures 2A, 2B, and S2B), or at a much higher concentration (Figure S2A) including the shorter Glu-rich peptides derived from the C-terminus of peptide 27 and 45 (Figures 2A and 2B). Finally, the pattern of recognition of peptides by the various sera tested, which differ markedly from one to the other (data not shown), confirms the above results i.e., specificity of antibodies to the corresponding peptide.

Clinical experiments have shown that the Antibody-Dependent Cell-mediated Inhibition (ADCI) of P. falciparum malaria represents one of the mechanisms controlling parasitemia and thereby clinical manifestations in humans [16]. Twelve peptide-specific antibodies proved able to induce a strong (more than 40%) and intermediate (lower than 40%) monocyte-dependent parasite killing (Table 1), whereas, in the absence of monocytes, no direct effect of antibodies on parasite growth was observed. The effects were in the range observed with antibodies from African adults who have the highest natural protection known against malaria. Therefore peptide-specific, human affinity-purified antibodies were functionally effective as shown by their ability to react with parasite proteins and to inhibit parasite growth. Thus, in vitro functional assays show that peptide-specific antibodies elicited by natural exposure to the parasite can induce protective mechanisms effective against malaria.

Sixteen peptides -twelve targeted by ADCI positive antibodies and four controls-were used to immunize CB6F1 mice (Table 2). Eleven of them elicited an intermediate or high antibody response, four of which also recognized the parasite protein in infected erythrocytes as determined by IFAT (Figure 1B; Table 2). As seen before for human antibodies, recognition was restricted to blood stages since sporozoites were negative in IFAT assays (data not shown) and by IFAT competition assays with the corresponding peptide (Figure 1B). Anti-peptide 27 mouse antibodies, which are positive in IFAT, are also specific for the homologous peptide 27 but not for the sequence related peptides 9, 12 and 45 (Table S2). Thus, peptides, which were chosen for their propensity to form alpha-helical coiled coil, can induce the production of antibodies that recognize epitopes present in the native protein. Improvement of the immunogenicity and structural specificity of the remaining peptides might be achieved in the future by a) a short elongation at the N- and C- terminal ends, b) stabilizing the alpha-helix as suggested by Cooper et al. and Lu and Hodges [17], [18] and/or c) use of other adjuvants.

Genetic polymorphism in current vaccine candidates is a major limitation to vaccine development. However available genotyping studies of our peptide sequences in parasite isolates of worldwide origin indicate very limited polymorphism (PlasmoDB 5.2, and unpublished sequencing data). A few peptide DNA sequences show deletion of one entire heptad repeat so that the shorter region still preserves its potential for the alpha-helical coiled coil formation.

With regard to the structural features and cellular location prediction of the proteins corresponding to the peptides selected for ADCI assays (Table 1), 15 of the proteins contain a pentapeptide conforming to the PEXEL consensus [19, 20; 21, 22], but that none of these have a position within the amino acid sequence that conforms to the location of known active PEXEL motifs (see Materials and Methods and Table S3); 12 have trans-membrane segments, and none of them has a GPI anchor. Only one protein contains a signal sequence. Fourteen proteins are predicted to be in the cytoplasm, one in the nucleus, one in the mitochondria, and one in the peroxysomes (Table S3). The prediction of the sub-cellular localization of these proteins should be taken with caution because gene annotation is being constantly updated and/or protein trafficking of the parasite is complex and not fully elucidated [23].

Further investigations will be required to determine the actual localization of the corresponding antigens. The predicted localization is a priori surprising for molecules able to trigger an ADCI activity. However, recent studies have shown that in addition to merozoite surface proteins, soluble proteins released at the time of schizont rupture were equally effective at triggering ADCI provided they defined at least two epitopes [24], which is the case for alpha-helical coiled coil heptad repeats. Therefore, molecules expressing a trans-membrane domain that can be exported to the parasite or host cell membrane, as well as molecules present in the cytoplasm of maturing schizonts and released by bursting schizonts can trigger antibodies to cross-link Fc-gamma receptors on monocytes to achieve Pf parasite killing.

In conclusion, an approach combining a genome-wide search by bioinformatics of alpha-helical coiled coil protein motifs and chemical synthesis can lead to the rapid identification and development of new malaria vaccine candidates. In fact, this approach is straightforward and easy to scale up; vaccine formulations may comprise mixtures of peptides or single constructs made up of several epitopes. In principle, this strategy can be extended to the discovery of proteins and vaccine candidates in other complex pathogens.

The Pf 3D7 genome [10] was used for the bioinformatics analysis. The generalized sequence profile method and the pftools package [11] were used to search for the short alpha-helical coiled coil domains. The coiled coil profiles were constructed using an alignment of several amino acid sequences corresponding to the known coiled coil domain. Two profiles containing four and five heptad repeats were used for the analysis. The cut-off levels of the profiles were chosen by tests performed against sequence database of proteins with the known 3D structures. Subsequently, the coiled coil regions selected by this approach were tested manually for the presence of the characteristic heptad repeats. These proteins were also analyzed by the COILS program [25].

The selected alpha-helical coiled coil containing proteins were further tested on their possible surface location and GPI anchoring by using the following programs: identification of potential signal peptides, SecretomeP and SignalP () [26]; transmembrane spanning regions (TMPRED  and TMHMM ; [27], [28]), and GPI-anchored proteins (; [29]) and prediction of sub-cellular localization (pTARGET ; [30]). To identify the PEXEL-like motifs in sequences of the selected proteins we used the following pattern [KR][GAVLIMFWPSTCYNQ][LIA][GAVLIMFWPSTCYNQ] [DEQ] that represents a combination of the PEXEL patterns indicated in recent papers [21], [22]. The presence of the identified proteins in the asexual erythrocytic stages was also checked using the published data on the transcriptome and proteome of this stage of development of P. falciparum (; [31]).

Cells were then distributed on polystyrene 96-well flat-bottomed culture plates (TPP, Trasadingen, Switzerland) and adherent MN were selected by incubation for 2 h at 37degreesC, in a humidified 5% CO2 atmosphere. More than 90% of the adherent cells obtained in this manner were MN as estimated by the non-specific esterase test (alpha-naphtyl acetate esterase; Sigma). MN from each donor were tested prior to ADCI assays and only those without direct inhibitory effect were used in assays.

To wells containing 2x105 MN purified as described above, 50 microl of an asynchronous parasite culture at 0.5 % parasitemia and 4 % hematocrit were added. Wells were then supplemented with test or control antibodies (Ab) and the total volume adjusted to 100 microl with culture medium. After 48 h and 72 h, 50 microl of culture medium were added to each well and after 96 h the ADCI assay was stopped and the final parasitemia was determined by light microscopy on Giemsa-stained smears by counting >/=50,000 red blood cells. For each Ab tested, duplicate wells included the following controls 1) non-specific monocytic inhibition, both MN+parasite, and MN+N-IgG+parasites and 2) direct inhibition by control or test IgG, both N-IgG+parasites, and test Abs+parasites. PIAG and N-IgG were used at a final concentration of 1 mg/ml as positive and negative controls respectively. Immunopurified tests Abs were used at 15 microg/ml. The Specific Growth inhibitory Index (SGI) which considers the parasite growth inhibition due to the effect of test Abs cooperating with MN was calculated as follows: SGI = 100x[1-(% parasitemia with MN and test Abs/% parasitemia test Abs)/(% parasitemia with MN and N-IgG/% parasitemia N-IgG)].

ELISA inhibition assay using anti-human peptide specific antibodies. Binding of peptide specific antibodies to peptides 76 (S2A) and 9 (S2B) absorbed on ELISA plates was inhibited by incubating specific antibodies (1-2 microg/ml) with peptides 14, 76 and 81 (S2A) and peptides 8 and 9 (S2B), respectively (see Material and Methods). Peptides 14, 76 and 79 share NNM or MNN as sequence similarity while peptides 8 and 9 do not exhibit any apparent sequence similarity.
