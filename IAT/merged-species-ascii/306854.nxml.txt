The human glycine tRNA synthetase gene (GlyRS) has been cloned and sequenced. The 2462 bp cDNA for this gene contains a large open reading frame (ORF) encoding 685 amino acids with predicted M(r) = 77,507 Da. The protein sequence has approximately 60% identity with B. mori GlyRS and 45% identity with S. cerevisiae GlyRS and contains motifs 2 and 3 characteristic of Class II tRNA synthetases. A second ORF encoding 47 amino acids is found upstream of the large ORF. Translation of this ORF may precede the expression of GlyRS as a possible regulatory mechanism. The enzyme was expressed in E. coli as a fusion protein with a 13 kDa biotinylated tag with an apparent M(r) = 90 kDa. The fusion protein was immunoprecipitated from crude bacterial extract with human EJ serum, which contains autoantibodies directed against GlyRS, and with rabbit polyclonal serum raised against a synthetic peptide derived from the predicted amino acid sequence of human GlyRS. Bacterial extract containing the fusion protein catalyses the aminoacylation of bovine tRNA with [14C]-gly at 10-fold increased level above normal bacterial extract and confirms that the cDNA encodes human GlyRS.
