Several cDNA clones encoding mouse DNA topoisomerase II were obtained from a mouse spermatocyte cDNA library and the entire coding sequence of the gene was determined. The mouse DNA topoisomerase II consists of 1528 amino acids with a molecular weight of 173 kDa. It shares significant homologies with the other eucaryotic enzymes, although species-specific sequences are observed in their highly charged C-terminal regions. The complete mouse TOP2 cDNA was put under yeast GAL1 promoter and examined for complementation of top2ts mutation in S.cerevisiae. We found that the cloned mouse gene could rescue the temperature-sensitive top2ts mutation, depending on its induction by galactose. The functional expression of the mouse DNA topoisomerase II in yeast was further confirmed by enzymatic assays and by immunological methods with antibodies specific for the mouse enzyme.
