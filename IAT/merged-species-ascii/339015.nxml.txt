Antigen receptors on most T-cells are heterodimeric glycoproteins, comprised of an alpha chain and a beta chain. These chains are encoded by discontiguous variable (V), diversity (D) and joining (J) gene segments that rearrange to produce a contiguous and functional alpha or beta chain gene. To investigate the size and diversity of the germline repertoire of alpha-chain gene segments, we have characterized and sequenced 20 alpha chain cDNAs. Among these cDNA clones, we have found 4 J alpha and 4 V alpha sequences that have not yet been described. The relationship of these "new" gene segments to those already characterized is discussed.
