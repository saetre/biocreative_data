The sequence of the first 149 nucleotides of the major leftward RNA of bacteriophage lambda has been determined. Preliminary sequence information was also obtained for a portion of the untranscribed area immediately upstream of the point on the template when RNA synthesis normally starts. Several restriction endonuclease sites, deletion endpoints, and single base changes have been localized within the sequence. The first potential translation initiation codon which is not followed by an in-phase termination codon is a GUG located 90 nucleotides from the transcription startpoint.
