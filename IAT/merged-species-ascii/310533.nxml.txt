Probably one of the first proteinaceous enzymes was an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RDRP). Although there are several conserved motifs present in the RDRPs of most positive and double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) viruses, the RDRPs of the dsRNA viruses show no detectable sequence similarity outside the conserved motifs. There is now, however, a group of dsRNA viruses of lower eucaryotes whose RDRPs are detectably similar. The origin of this sequence similarity appears to be common descent from one or more noninfectious viruses of a progenitor cell, an origin that predates the differentiation of protozoans and fungi. The cause of this preservation of sequence appears to be constraints placed on the RDRP by the life-style of these viruses--the maintenance of a stable, persistent, noninfectious state.
