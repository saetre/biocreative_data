The yeast Mre11 is a multi-functional protein and is known to form a protein complex with Rad50 and Xrs2. In order to elucidate the relationship between Mre11 complex formation and its mitotic functions, and to determine domain(s) required for Mre11 protein interactions, we performed yeast two-hybrid and functional analyses with respect to Mre11 DNA repair and telomere maintenance. Evidence presented in this study indicates that the N-terminal region of Mre11 constitutes the core homo-dimerization and hetero-dimerization domain and is sufficient for Mre11 DNA repair and maintaining the wild-type telomere length. In contrast, a stretch of 134 amino acids from the extreme C-terminus, although essential for achieving a full level of self-association, is not required for the aforementioned Mre11 mitotic functions. Interestingly, deletion of these same 134 amino acids enhanced the interaction of Mre11 with Rad50 and Xrs2, which is consistent with the notion that this region is specific for meiotic functions. While Mre11 self-association alone is insufficient to provide the above mitotic activities, our results are consistent with a strong correlation between Mre11-Rad50-Xrs2 complex formation, mitotic DNA repair and telomere maintenance. This correlation was further strengthened by analyzing two mre11 phosphoesterase motif mutants ( mre11-2 and rad58S ), which are defective in DNA repair, telomere maintenance and protein interactions, and a rad50S mutant, which is normal in both complex formation and mitotic functions. Together, these results support and extend a current model regarding Mre11 structure and functions in mitosis and meiosis.
