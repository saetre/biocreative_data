We have cloned a cDNA encoding a novel octamer binding factor Oct6 that is expressed in undifferentiated ES cells. Expression of the Oct6 gene is downregulated upon differentiation of these cells by aggregate formation. Furthermore the gene is transiently up regulated during retinoic acid induced differentiation of P19 EC cells, reaching maximum levels of expression one day after RA addition. Sequence analysis of the cDNA encoding the Oct6 protein indicated that the Oct6 gene is a member of the POU-HOMEO domain gene family. The gene expresses a 3 kb mRNA encoding a 449 amino acid protein with an apparent molecular weight of 45 kD. The sequence of the Oct6 POU domain is identical to that of the rat SCIP (Tst-1) gene. The Oct6 expression pattern suggests a role for this DNA binding protein in neurogenesis as well as early embryogenesis.
