The complete nucleotide sequence of mutH gene from E. coli has been determined. Based on the deduced amino acid sequence, the MutH protein has a molecular weight of 25.4 kdaltons in agreement with the previous estimates based on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of the purified protein. Deletion analysis of the DNA sequences upstream of mutH has identified the promoter region for this gene. Two independently isolated temperature sensitive alleles of the mutH gene have also been sequenced. One mutation results in an amino acid change at position 27 (thr to leu) while the other occurs at position 156 (asp to asn).
