The amino acid sequence of rat ribosomal protein S8 was deduced from the sequence of nucleotides in a recombinant cDNA and confirmed from the NH2- and carboxyl-terminal amino acid sequences of the protein. Ribosomal protein S8 contains 207 amino acids (the NH2-terminal methionine is removed after translation of the mRNA) and has a molecular weight of 23,928. Hybridization of the cDNA to digests of nuclear DNA suggests that there are 7-9 copies of the S8 gene. Ribosomal protein S8 contains a possible internal repeat that has 12 or 13 residues, is basic, and occurs 5 times in the protein.
