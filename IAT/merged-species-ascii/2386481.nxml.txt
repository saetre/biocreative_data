The incidence rate of pancreatic cancer has increased significantly in recent years. Recent studies examining the origin of pancreatic cancer have revealed that molecular alterations, including changes in tumor suppressor genes and oncogenes involved in multiple cellular signaling pathways, may have a significant role in the multistage carcinogenesis of pancreatic cancer [1].

DNA methylation at CpG islands is the major epigenetic modification of mammalian genomes and is required for gene regulation and genome stability [2]. Aberrant DNA methylation, especially the hypermethylation of tumor suppressor genes, has been reported to be associated with the inactivation of tumor suppressor genes and tumorigenesis [3]. Methyl-CpG binding domain protein 1 (MBD1) is a mammalian protein that binds methylated CpG islands symmetrically and couples DNA methylation to transcriptional repression [4]. This biological property suggests a role for MBD1 in the silencing of tumor suppressor genes that may contribute to tumorigenesis [4,5]. We have previously reported that MBD1 is over-expressed in human pancreatic carcinomas and that over-expression of MBD1 correlated significantly with lymph node metastasis [6]. However, the role of MBD1 in the development of pancreatic cancer is still unknown.

In this study, we silenced MBD1 expression in the pancreatic cancer cell line BxPC-3 using the RNA interference (RNAi) technique. We used two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2-DE) to detect differential protein expression in the BxPC-3/MBD1-siRNA and control BxPC-3/vector cell lines. The differential expression patterns between the two cell lines were identified by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF-MS). Our data provide some insight into the functional mechanism of MBD1 in the development of pancreatic cancer.

The restriction endonucleases BamH I and Hind III were used to linearize the PGCsi-U6/Neo/GFP vector (kindly provided by Professor Huang Weida, Department of Biochemistry, Fudan University). The annealed double stranded oligonucleotides were ligated into the BamH I and Hind III sites of the linear pGCsi-U6/Neo/GFP vector using T4 DNA ligase. The plasmid was then transformed and recombinant plasmid DNA was extracted for DNA sequencing.

Quantification results were expressed in terms of the cycle threshold (CT) value. The comparative CT method [7] was used to quantify relative MBD1, vimentin and GRP78 expression. Briefly, the CT values were averaged for each triplicate. Differences between the mean CT values of MBD1, vimentin, GRP78 and those of beta-actin were calculated as delta CT = CT (target gene) -CT (beta-actin). Final results, expressed as N-fold differences of gene expression between BxPC-3/MBD1-siRNA and control BxPC-3 cells, were determined as 2-delta delta CT (delta delta CT = delta CT BxPC-3/MBD1-siRNA - delta CT control BxPC-3).

After incubation at 37degreesC for 1 hour, the lysates were centrifuged at 15000 rpm for 30 minutes at 4degreesC. The concentration of the total protein in the supernatant was determined using the Bradford method. Protein samples were diluted to 350 mul with rehydration solution (7 M urea, 2 M thiourea, 15 mM DTT, 0.5% IPG (immobilized pH gradient) buffer, and trace bromophenol blue) and applied to IPG strips (pH 4-7, Amersham Biosciences, Sweden) for 12 hours. Isoelectric focusing (IEF) was performed on an Ettan IPGphor (Amersham Biosciences). Focused IPG strips were equilibrated for 15 minutes in a solution (6 M urea, 2% SDS, 30% glycerol, 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.8 and 1% DTT), followed by 15 minutes in the same solution containing 2.5% iodoacetamide instead of 1% DTT. Equilibrated strips were placed on 10% acrylamide gels containing SDS. SDS-PAGE was performed on a PROTEAN II system (Bio-Rad, USA). After electrophoresis, silver staining was performed as described previously [8].

The protein spots were excised using an Ettan spot picker (Amersham Biosciences) and digested with trypsin. Briefly, silver-stained protein spots were destained with 15 mM potassium ferricyanide and 50 mM sodium thiosulfate (1:1) and washed with Millipore-Q water. The gel pieces were dehydrated with acetonitrile, dried in a vacuum centrifuge, and incubated in 20 mul of digestion solution containing 20 mM ammonium bicarbonate and 20 ng/mul sequencing grade trypsin (Promega, USA). After the tryptic digestion at 37degreesC for at least 3 hours, the resultant peptides were extracted (50 mul of 50% acetonitrile), desalted with ZipTip C18 columns (Millipore Corp, USA), and eluted with 2.5 mul of 50% acetonitrile containing 0.5% TFA (Triflouroacetic acid) and 3 mg/ml alpha-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid. Samples were spotted onto stainless steel MALDI sample target plates, and analyzed by 4700 Proteomics Analyzer MALDI-TOF/TOF mass spectrometer (Applied Biosystems, USA) in the positive ion reflector mode. Peptide matching and a protein search against the NCBI databases were performed using the Mascot search engine.

The siRNA sequences targeting MBD1 were successfully cloned into the pGCsi-U6/Neo/GFP plasmid. DNA sequencing was performed to confirm that the recombinant plasmid was constructed correctly (data not shown). The plasmid expressed green fluorescent protein (GFP) to allow observation of the transfected cells by fluorescent microscopy. Twenty-four hours after transfection, transfected BxPC-3 cells expressed GFP. Cells were selected with G418 (800 mug/mL) for approximately three weeks: positive cell clones were identified by fluorescent microscopy (Fig 1). Western blot analysis revealed that the expression of MBD1 in BxPC-3/MBD1-siRNA cells was significantly lower than in BxPC-3/vector and untreated BxPC-3 cells (Fig 2A). Quantitative RT-PCR confirmed that MBD1 in BxPC-3/MBD1-siRNA cells was downregulated about 14.76-fold than in control cells (Fig 5A).

To investigate the changes in protein expression in pancreatic cancer after MBD1 knock-down, we performed a comparative proteomic study between BxPC-3/MBD1-siRNA and BxPC-3/vector cell lines. Fig 3 shows two representative 2-DE maps from BxPC-3/MBD1-siRNA and BxPC-3/vector cell lines in the pH range 4-7. Among the spots investigated, almost 30 proteins were differential expressed. But some of them were unknown proteins that could not be identified, and some of them with different PI and MW finally proved to be the same protein (such as 348 and 429, both identified as tubulin beta), which suggest different post-translational modification. Finally, 14 spots were identified as differentially expressed proteins between the BxPC-3/MBD1-siRNA and BxPC-3/vector cell lines. Using image analysis we found that five spots (429, 896, 384, 922, 363) were up-regulated and nine spots (391, 1177, 1264, 640, 557, 703, 649, 1023, 218) were down-regulated after the silencing of MBD1 using RNAi (Fig 4).

MBD1 is a mammalian protein that binds symmetrically methylated CpG sequences and regulates gene expression in association with DNA methylation [2]. A powerful transcriptional repression domain (TRD) at the C terminus of MBD1 can actively repress transcription at a distance [4]. Thus, MBD1 may have an important role in the silencing of tumor suppressor genes that are hypermethylated at their promoter CpG islands in cancer cells [5,10].

Previously, we have shown that the gene expression of MBD1 is significantly increased in pancreatic carcinomas compared to normal pancreatic tissue, with a simultaneous decrease in the expression of some tumor suppressor genes (CDH1, RB) [11]. We also found that the protein and mRNA expressions of MBD1 in pancreatic carcinoma were significantly higher than in normal tissues. Furthermore, the expression of MBD1 correlated with lymph node metastasis [6]. However, the role of MBD1 during the development of pancreatic cancer is still unknown.

The present study combined a proteomic approach with RNAi technology to identify proteins associated with MBD1 function in pancreatic cancer. We successfully used RNAi technology to construct a recombinant MBD1-siRNA plasmid that stably knocked-down MBD1 gene expression in the BxPC-3 human pancreatic cancer cell line. We identified 14 differentially expressed protein spots between the two cell lines using MALDI-TOF-MS.

MBD1 affect gene expression according to the status of DNA methylation. Fujita N et al indicated that MBD1 acts as a transcriptional regulator depending on the density of methyl-CpG pairs through the cooperation of MBD, CXXC, and TRD sequences. MBD1v1 represses transcription preferentially from both unmethylated and sparsely methylated promoters, while MBD1v3 inhibits densely methylated but not unmethylated promoter activities. Moreover, they also found that MBD1 enhanced transcription from the some methylated promoter [2]. In our study, 9/14 proteins were downregulated and 5/14 proteins were upregulated after MBD1 knock-down, maybe related with different transcriptional regulation way of MBD1.

Among the 14 MBD1-associated proteins identified in this study, vimentin was found to be down-regulated 20-fold in the BxPC-3/MBD1-siRNA cell line compared to the control BxPC-3/vector cell. Vimentin, a major intermediate filament protein of mesenchymal cells, was found to be over-expressed in some human cancer tissues and associated with prognostic indicators [12,13]. Vimentin exon-1 sequences are methylated in most of colon cancer tissues and aberrant methylation of vimentin has become a novel molecular biomarker of colorectal cancer [14]. In the short term RNAi experiment, the mRNA level of vimentin was also down-regulated after MBD1 knock-down, indicated that MBD1 may involve in DNA methylation of vimentin and mediate the expression of vimentin in pancreatic cancer.

We also found that several members of the HSP family (GRP78 and HSP A8) were down-regulated in the absence of MBD1. GRP78 promotes tumor proliferation, survival, metastasis, and resistance to a wide variety of therapies [15,16]. Indeed, it has been shown that cancer cells adapt to chronic stress in the tumor microenvironment by inducing the expression of GRP78 [15,16]. Studies show that Heat shock proteins are methylated in mammalian cells and HSPs expressions are associated with aberrant methylation of promoter CpG islands [17-19]. In this study, the down-regulation of both GRP78 and HSP A8 after MBD1 knock-down, suggest that MBD1 may affect the expression of HSPs in pancreatic cancer through DNA methylation.

Many of the proteins that were found to be down-regulated by the knock-down of MBD1 have been shown to be over-expressed in certain cancers. For example, stathmin, a microtubule-destabilizing protein, is expressed at high levels in a wide variety of human cancers [20,21]. Inhibition of stathmin expression in malignant cells has been shown to interfere with cell cycle progression and abrogates the transformed phenotype [20,21]. hnRNP K, involved in regulating transcription, mRNA shuttling, RNA editing and translation, has been reported to be overexpressed in several human cancer tissues [22,23]. In colorectal cancer, patients who presented with hnRNP K-positive tumors had a poorer survival outcome [22,23]. EIF3 plays an essential role in the rate-limiting initiation phase of translation, and increased mRNA and protein levels have been detected in several human tumors. Furthermore, over-expression of eIF3 is reportedly a prognostic biomarker for poor clinical outcome [24]. Cofilin 2, an actin-depolymerizing factor that is mainly expressed in smooth muscle cells of collateral arteries, has been associated with angiogenesis [25]. Most of these proteins play an important role in tumorigenesis, some of them are prognostic biomarkers for human malignant tumors, and some were involved in methylation. For instance, different methylation sites in hnRNP K have been identified and shown to influence protein-protein interactions [26]. Stathmin also presents aberrant methylation in prostate cancer cell [27]. Down-regulation of these tumor-related proteins after MBD1-knock-down suggests that MBD1 may play a significant role in pancreatic cancer through regulating methylation.

Among the five proteins that were up-regulated, ER-60 protease and P4 hb are multifunctional proteins that belong to the protein disulfide isomerase family that is a chaperone protein and related with tumor cell migration and invasion [28-30]. Tubulin beta2, the subunit protein of microtubules, is present in the cell nuclei of a variety of cancers [31]. In colorectal cancer research, methylated DNA sequence within tubulin was identified [32]. Since these proteins were up-regulated after knock-down of MBD1, they might be novel MBD1-associated proteins in pancreatic cancer.

###begin p 61
We established a MBD1 knock-down BxPC-3 pancreatic cancer cell line using a stable RNAi method. The comparative proteomic approach is a useful strategy of proteomics to analyze and compare the differentially expressed proteins and identify novel target molecules in unknown pathways. These differential proteins may be associated with the function of MBD1, our findings provide some insight into the functional mechanism of MBD1 in the development of pancreatic cancer.
