Type III Neuregulin1 (Nrg1) isoforms are membrane-tethered proteins capable of participating in bidirectional juxtacrine signaling. Neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs), which can modulate the release of a rich array of neurotransmitters, are differentially targeted to presynaptic sites. We demonstrate that Type III Nrg1 back signaling regulates the surface expression of alpha7 nAChRs along axons of sensory neurons. Stimulation of Type III Nrg1 back signaling induces an increase in axonal surface alpha7 nAChRs, which results from a redistribution of preexisting intracellular pools of alpha7 rather than from increased protein synthesis. We also demonstrate that Type III Nrg1 back signaling activates a phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase signaling pathway and that activation of this pathway is required for the insertion of preexisting alpha7 nAChRs into the axonal plasma membrane. These findings, in conjunction with prior results establishing that Type III Nrg1 back signaling controls gene transcription, demonstrate that Type III Nrg1 back signaling can regulate both short-and long-term changes in neuronal function.

The Neuregulin1 (Nrg1) gene encodes an extremely important and diverse family of proteins that signal by binding to the ErbB family of receptor tyrosine kinases. Nrg1-ErbB signaling regulates neural development, glial growth, myelination, and the maintenance of synaptic connections in both the peripheral and central nervous system (Michailov et al., 2004; Taveggia et al., 2005; Chen et al., 2006; Lopez-Bendito et al., 2006). Nrg1 activation of ErbB signaling regulates the levels of several ion channels, including subtypes of neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs; Yang et al., 1998; Liu et al., 2001; Kawai et al., 2002; Chang and Fischbach, 2006), N-methyl-d-aspartic acid receptors (Ozaki et al., 1997; Gu et al., 2005), alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid receptors (Kwon et al., 2005; Li et al., 2007), and gamma-amino butyric acidA receptors (Rieff et al., 1999; Okada and Corfas, 2004). Nrg1 has been implicated as a schizophrenia susceptibility gene, and the potential relationship between Nrg1 and circuits affected in schizophrenia underscores the importance of determining the molecular mechanisms of action of Nrg1 signaling in the developing and adult nervous systems (Stefansson et al., 2002).

The Nrg1 gene encodes over a dozen different protein products. Multiple promoters and alternative splicing leads to the synthesis of three (and perhaps as many as six) classes of proteins differing in their amino-terminal domains, as well as in the EGF-like domain (alpha or beta), and/or in the length of the C termini (Falls, 2003). These differences in primary sequence translate into subtle and dramatic differences in signaling strategies. Although Types I and II Nrg1 are either directly secreted or released after constitutive cleavage, Type III Nrg1 remains membrane tethered as a result of its unique N-terminal transmembrane domain (Wang et al., 2001; Taveggia et al., 2005). Thus, Types I and II Nrg1 can participate in paracrine signaling, whereas Type III Nrg1 predominantly signals in a juxtacrine manner. Additionally, it has been shown that Type III Nrg1 also functions as a receptor, in that Type III Nrg1-ErbB interaction results in signaling within the Type III Nrg1-expressing cell (Bao et al., 2003, 2004).

The integrity of a neuron-neuron synapse is determined by several molecular interactions between pre- and postsynaptic cells. Throughout the central and peripheral nervous system, nAChRs function as cation-selective ligand-gated ion channels and play important roles in synaptic signaling (Berg and Conroy, 2002). There is increasing evidence for the importance of nAChRs in the modulation of transmitter release from presynaptic terminals (McGehee et al., 1995; MacDermott et al., 1999), neuronal survival (Dajas-Bailador et al., 2000; Mechawar et al., 2004), and postsynaptic signaling (Zhang et al., 1996; Zhang and Berg, 2007). Individual nAChR channels have unique biological functions that are determined by the pentameric combination of 11 distinct subunits: alpha2-alpha7, alpha9, alpha10, and beta2-beta4 (Rosenberg et al., 2002). Of particular interest are the alpha7* nAChRs (alpha7-containing nAChRs) because of their high permeability to calcium and abundant expression in both mammalian and avian peripheral nervous systems (Roth and Berg, 2003; Fucile et al., 2005).

The Type III isoform of Nrg1 was identified as the nerve-derived factor responsible for increasing acetylcholine-evoked currents in neurons and was shown to regulate expression of neuronal nAChR subunit mRNAs, including that of alpha7 (Yang et al., 1998). More recent findings in our laboratory reveal a requirement for presynaptic Type III Nrg1 in potentiation of glutamatergic transmission by nicotine in a central sensory motor-gating circuit (Du, C., C. Zhong, M. Hancock, D.A. Talmage, and L.W. Role. 2004. Society for Neuroscience 34th Annual Meeting; unpublished data). These results inspired us to investigate the molecular mechanisms underlying presynaptic Type III Nrg1's cell-autonomous effect on functional alpha7* nAChRs along axonal projections.

In this paper, we show that presynaptic Type III Nrg1 is required for normal levels of presynaptically targeted alpha7* nAChRs in primary sensory neurons. Sensory neurons from Type III Nrg1 mutant mice exhibit deficits of the surface expression of alpha7* nAChRs. Acute stimulation of Type III Nrg1 back signaling increases the number of alpha7* nAChRs on sensory axons from wild-type (WT), but not from homozygous Type III Nrg1, mutant embryos. These increases in axonal surface alpha7* nAChRs result from redistribution of preexisting intracellular pools of alpha7 rather than from increased alpha7 protein synthesis. Increases in surface pools of alpha7* nAChR are accomplished, at least in part, by local activation of a phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PtdIns 3K) signaling pathway, which in turn stimulates the membrane insertion of intracellular alpha7* nAChRs.

Subsets of primary sensory neurons within the dorsal root ganglia (DRG) express Type III Nrg1 and alpha7 nAChR subunit mRNAs (Boyd et al., 1991; Wolpowitz et al., 2000; Genzen et al., 2001; Taveggia et al., 2005). In the following experiments, we examined the expression of alpha7* nAChRs and Type III Nrg1 on the surface of axons from sensory neurons of WT or Type III Nrg1-/- mouse embryos. Embryonic neurons were used for these experiments because mutant mice lacking Type III Nrg1 die at birth (Wolpowitz et al., 2000).

To label surface alpha7* nAChRs, primary sensory neurons were labeled with alphaBgTx-488 (Alexa 488-conjugated alpha-bungarotoxin) before fixation and permeabilization (Fig. 1 A). alpha-BgTx is an effective reagent for probing alpha7* nAChRs because of its high affinity for alpha7* nAChRs (Ravdin and Berg 1979). After fixation and permeabilization, we applied antibodies recognizing the cysteine-rich domain of Type III Nrg1 (red) or neurofilament (NF) proteins (blue; Fig. 1 A; Yang et al., 1998). In neurons from WT mice, axons were studded with distinct puncta of alphaBgTx-488 and Type III Nrg1 along the same sensory axons. Pretreatment with 5 muM methyllycaconitine or 1 muM of nicotine before addition of alphaBgTx-488 blocked surface labeling of alpha7* nAChRs, confirming the specificity of surface alphaBgTx-488 labeling (Fig. 1 D). We repeated this analysis using sensory neurons isolated from Type III Nrg1-/- embryos. Labeling with alphaBgTx-488 identified discrete clusters of alpha7* nAChRs on the axonal surface of mutant neurons (Fig. 1 A). However, when we quantified the number of these alphaBgTx-488 clusters we found that the mutants had approximately50% fewer clusters than WT neurons (WT, 6.47 +/- 0.69 clusters/100 mum; Type III Nrg1-/-, 3.22 +/- 0.59 clusters/100 mum; Fig. 1 B). Additionally, we found that the mutants had a 35% reduction in mean cluster area relative to WT neurons (WT, 0.26 +/- 0.02 mum2; Type III Nrg1-/-, 0.17 +/- 0.02 mum2; Fig. 1 C).

Decreased surface expression of alpha7* nAChRs along axons of Type III Nrg1-/- sensory neurons. Sensory ganglia were extirpated from embryonic day (E) 14.5 WT or Type III Nrg1-/- embryos and plated as explants. After 2 d in vitro, neurons were labeled for surface alpha7* nAChRs with alphaBgTx-488 (green). Neurons were fixed, permeabilized, and stained for Type III Nrg1 (red) and NF protein (blue). (A) Representative micrographs of alphaBgTx-488 clusters along NF-positive axons of WT and Type III Nrg1-/- sensory neurons at 2 d in vitro. Type III Nrg1 staining was detected along WT (a) but not Type III Nrg1-/- (d) axons. Fewer surface alphaBgTx-488 clusters were detected along mutant axons (e) as compared with WT (b). Confocal images were acquired from a 100x oil objective. Bar, 5 mum. (B) Quantification of surface alphaBgTx-488 clusters per 100 mum of axonal length revealed an approximately50% reduction of clusters along mutant axons. The graph shows means +/- SEM. Data were pooled from three independent experiments. Statistical significance determined by ANOVA. *, P < 0.001 (Statview). (C) Quantification of the surface alphaBgTx-488 cluster area. Loss of Type III Nrg1 expression resulted in an approximately35% reduction of alphaBgTx-488 cluster area. Data pooled from three independent experiments were analyzed using nonparametric statistics and presented as box plots (see Materials and methods). Statistical significance was determined by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov Test. *, P < 0.0001 (Statview). (D) Pretreatment of sensory neurons with 1 muM of nicotine (Nic; b and e) or 5 muM methyllycaconitine (MLA; c and f) prevents surface alphaBgTx-488 labeling along axons. Bar, 10 mum. (E) Immunoblot analysis of total alpha7 subunit protein levels in sensory neurons from E14.5 WT, Type III Nrg1+/-, and Type III Nrg1-/- embryos cultured for 2 d in vitro (a). MAPK1/2 probing in the bottom panel shows equal lysate loading. Immunoblots of total alpha7 subunit protein levels in brain extracts from WT or alpha7 nAChR-/- embryos are also shown (b). Glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase probing in the bottom panel shows equal lysate loading (b). (F) In WT sensory neurons, nicotine application (1 muM for 1 min) resulted in an increased internal concentration of Ca2+ (indicated in pseudo color; described in Materials and methods). The white arrowhead highlights an axonal region affected by nicotine. Bar, 10 mum. (G) Changes in internal concentration of Ca2+ in response to application of nicotine in WT and mutant axons are plotted. Note that 100 nM alphaBgTx completely eliminated the response to nicotine in WT axons and that sensory axons from Type III Nrg1-/- animals did not respond to nicotine. Data are from two independent experiments. The graph shows means +/- SEM. Statistical significance was determined by ANOVA with post-hoc Fisher's PLSD test. *, P < 0.0001 (Statview).

Although there is a difference in alpha7* nAChR clusters expressed along axons of Type III Nrg1-/- sensory neurons, we did not detect an overall reduction of total alpha7 protein in mutant neurons (Fig. 1 E). This result, coupled with our findings in Fig. 1 (A-C), indicates that Type III Nrg1 specifically affects the surface expression of alpha7* nAChRs. The decrease in surface alpha7* nAChRs along axons of Type III Nrg1-/- neurons did not result from general deficits in endocytic recycling because these neurons retained WT rates of transferrin receptor recycling (Fig. S1, A and B, available at ). We next looked to see whether Type III Nrg1-/- neurons have defects in axonal targeting of presynaptic proteins. We did not detect differences in the axonal targeting of synaptophysin or vesicular glutamate transporter 1 (vGlut1) along mutant axons (Fig. S1, C and D).

To demonstrate that the alphaBgTx-488 surface binding measurements reflected the presence of functional alpha7* nAChRs, we quantified internal concentrations of Ca2+ along sensory axons after a 1-min application of 1 muM of nicotine. In response to nicotine, we detected an increase in internal concentrations of Ca2+ within 1 min along axons of WT neurons (Fig. 1, F and G). When this experiment was repeated in the presence of 1 muM alphaBgTx, we did not detect an increase in intracellular concentrations of Ca2+, indicating that the nicotine-induced changes were mediated by functional alpha7* nAChRs. Nicotine application did not increase internal Ca2+ concentrations in Type III Nrg1-/- axons (Fig. 1 G), a result which is consistent with a significant decrease in surface alpha7* nAChRs in these neurons.

Type III Nrg1 functions as a membrane-tethered bidirectional signaling molecule (Bao et al., 2003, 2004). To test the possibility that Type III Nrg1, acting as a receptor, contributes to the regulation of alpha7* nAChR levels on sensory axons, we treated WT or Type III Nrg1-/- sensory neurons with 2 nM of either the extracellular domain (ECD) of ErbB2 (B2-ECD; control) or ErbB4 (B4-ECD) for 24 h (Fig. 2, A and B). B4-ECD, but not B2-ECD, binds with high affinity to the EGF-like domain of Nrg1 (Fig. S2 A, available at ; Fitzpatrick et al., 1998; Bao et al., 2003). We visualized alpha7* nAChRs present on the surface of sensory axons by labeling with alphaBgTx-488 (green) before fixation (Fig. 2 A). Treating WT sensory neurons with B4-ECD for 24 h led to an increase in the number of alphaBgTx-488 clusters on the axonal surface (from 6.47 +/- 0.69 clusters/100 mum in control cultures to 10.38 +/- 1.59 clusters/100 mum; Fig. 2 B). When we repeated the experiment using sensory neurons from Type III Nrg1-/- embryos, there was no significant change in the number of alphaBgTx-488 clusters on mutant axons (from 3.07 +/- 0.72 clusters/100 mum in control cultures to 2.74 +/- 1.14 clusters/100 mum in B4-ECD treated). This effect did not result from general changes in the levels of surface proteins, as we did not detect a change in the axonal surface levels of TrkA in response to a 24-h B4-ECD treatment (Fig. S1, E and F).

We next asked how soon after B4-ECD treatment the increase in surface alpha7* nAChRs was seen. In sensory neurons treated with B4-ECD, we detected an increase in the surface expression of alpha7* nAChR clusters along axons within 1 h, with the maximal response occurring after 6 h (Fig. 2 C) and sustained for 24 h (Figs. 1 B, 2 B, and 3 A). Many of the surface alpha7* nAChR clusters induced by B4-ECD treatment were localized in close proximity to membrane-bound B4-ECD (Fig. 2 D).

Type III Nrg1 back signaling increases the surface expression of alpha7* nAChRs in the absence of protein synthesis. Dissociated sensory neurons from E11 chick embryos were cultured for 2 d in vitro and treated with either B2-ECD (control) or B4-ECD for 1 or 24 h. (A) Quantification of surface or total pools of alpha7* nAChR by 125I-alphaBgTx radiolabeling in sensory neurons treated with either B2-ECD (control) or B4-ECD for 24 h. In response to a 24-h B4-ECD treatment, we detected an approximately2.7-fold increase in surface 125I-alphaBgTx binding compared with control conditions (B2-ECD [control], 1,339.15 +/- 329.77 cpm; and B4-ECD, 3,562.81 +/- 1,111.19 cpm). B4-ECD treatment did not induce a change in total 125I-alphaBgTx binding as compared with the control (B2-ECD [control], 11,159.74 +/- 1,059.79 cpm; and B4-ECD, 12,258.85 +/- 580.11 cpm).

Prior studies have shown that activation of ErbB tyrosine kinase signaling can alter the surface expression of alpha7* nAChRs in neurons (Liu et al., 2001; Kawai et al., 2002; Chang and Fischbach, 2006). To verify that the increase in surface clusters we detected in response to B4-ECD treatment was mediated by Type III Nrg1 acting as a receptor, we assessed the response of sensory neurons treated with B4-ECD in the presence of 2 muM ErbB inh. (inhibitors of ErbB tyrosine kinase activity; PD 168393 and PD 158780) for 1 h (Fig. 2 E). We also assessed the effect on alpha7* nAChRs of acute activation of ErbB signaling by treating neurons with recombinant Nrg1beta peptide (Nrg1-ECD, 10 ng/ml). In response to B4-ECD treatment, we detected an increase in surface alpha7* nAChR clusters along axons in the presence of ErbB inh. (ErbB inh., 12.31 +/- 2.43 clusters/100-mum axonal length; and ErbB inh. + B4-ECD, 20.94 +/- 2.37 clusters/100-mum axonal length; Fig. 2 E). Conversely, we did not detect an increase in axonal surface alpha7* nAChR clusters in response to Nrg1-ECD treatment (B2-ECD [control], 11.30 +/- 1.74 clusters/100-mum axonal length; and Nrg1-ECD, 13.20 +/- 2.72 clusters/100-mum axonal length; Fig. 2 E). Collectively, these results indicate that in sensory neurons, Type III Nrg1, acting as a receptor for B4-ECD, regulates the surface expression of alpha7* nAChR, whereas activation of ErbB tyrosine kinases does not.

Stimulation of Type III Nrg1 back signaling elicits a transcriptional response mediated by the Nrg1 intracellular domain (Bao et al., 2003, 2004). To determine if Type III Nrg1-dependent regulation of axonal alpha7* nAChR levels resulted from Nrg1 intracellular domain-induced synthesis of alpha7 and/or changes in alpha7* nAChR surface expression along axons, we compared measures of total (surface and internal) neuronal 125I-alphaBgTx binding (Fig. 3 A) and total immunoreactive alpha7 nAChR protein (Fig. 3 B) in sensory neurons treated with B2-ECD (control) or B4-ECD for 24 h. We also asked whether B4-ECD treatment increased surface alpha7* nAChR levels in the presence of a protein synthesis inhibitor (Fig. 3, C-E).

Surface alpha7* nAChRs were quantified by 125I-alphaBgTx labeling in live in vitro preparations of chick sensory neurons and, in parallel, the total pool of alpha7* nAChRs was quantified by 125I-alphaBgTx binding after permeabilization with 0.5% saponin (Fig. 3 A). Under basal conditions, approximately12% of the total alpha7* nAChRs were on the surface, which is similar to prior results emphasizing the large internal pools of nAChRs in neurons (Cho et al., 2005). After a 24-h treatment with B4-ECD, we observed an approximately2.7-fold increase in surface 125I-alphaBgTx binding. In B4-ECD-stimulated neurons, approximately30% of the alpha7* nAChRs were at the surface, but the total pool of 125I-alphaBgTx-labeled sites was not changed. These results are consistent with Type III Nrg1 back signaling inducing a relocalization of alpha7* nAChRs from preexisting internal pools to clusters along the axonal surface. Results on increased surface versus total alpha7* nAChRs were confirmed by immunoblot assay (Fig. 3 B). These results indicate that in sensory neurons, Type III Nrg1, acting as a receptor, can increase axonal surface alpha7* nAChRs without significantly increasing the size of the total alpha7* nAChR pool.

To extend our examination of the idea that Type III Nrg1 back signaling stimulates insertion of preexisting alpha7* nAChRs into the axonal membrane, we repeated the B4-ECD stimulation of dispersed sensory neurons in the presence of the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide (CHX; Fig. 3, C-E). Neurons were pretreated with 10 mug/ml CHX for 45 min and then stimulated for an additional hour with either B2-ECD (control) or B4-ECD. Neither the B4-ECD-induced increase in the number of surface alphaBgTx-488 clusters (Fig. 3 D) nor the increase in cluster area (Fig. 3 E) were affected by the CHX pretreatment (CHX, 9.72 +/- 1.65 clusters/100-mum axonal length; CHX + B4-ECD, 19.96 +/- 2.83 clusters/100-mum axonal length; CHX, 0.23 +/- 0.02 mum2; and CHX + B4-ECD, 0.32 +/- 0.01 mum2). Thus, the increase in surface alpha7* nAChRs resulted from a redistribution of preexisting receptors rather than from new receptor synthesis.

Prior studies have shown that endocytosis can alter the surface expression of neurotransmitter receptors (Man et al., 2007; Xia et al., 2007). Using a pharmacological inhibitor of endocytosis, phenylarsine oxide (PAO; Hertel et al., 1985), we investigated whether B4-ECD-mediated increase in the surface expression of alpha7* nAChR clusters was caused by alterations in receptor endocytosis. We applied PAO to sensory neurons for 45 min before B2-ECD (control) or B4-ECD treatment. Although PAO did not significantly alter the number of surface alpha7* nAChR clusters along axons under control conditions, it significantly increased the area of the clusters (from 0.2 +/- 0.01 mum2 under control conditions to 0.29 +/- 0.03 mum2 after PAO treatment; Fig. 4 C). After B4-ECD treatment for 1 h, we detected an increase in both the number and area of surface alpha7* nAChR clusters along axons when endocytosis was blocked (Fig. 4 B, PAO, 16.03 +/- 2.69 clusters/100-mum axonal length; and PAO + B4-ECD, 29.77 +/- 3.41 clusters/100-mum axonal length; Fig. 4 C, PAO, 0.29 +/- 0.03 mum2; and PAO + B4-ECD, 0.34 +/- 0.04 mum2). Based on our findings, we conclude that the increase in surface alpha7* nAChRs results from an increase in membrane insertion rather than a decrease in endocytosis.

Our main objective in the following experiments was to test for signaling pathways activated downstream of Type III Nrg1 that might direct membrane targeting of alpha7* nAChRs. Because of the substantial evidence that PtdIns 3K signaling is a major regulator of membrane protein trafficking (Tengholm and Meyer, 2002; Man et al., 2003; Viard et al., 2004; Chae et al., 2005), we asked whether stimulation of Type III Nrg1 back signaling activated PtdIns 3K signaling. Sensory neurons were stimulated with B2-ECD (control) or B4-ECD for 5 min and then labeled with an antibody recognizing the PtdIns 3K product, phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5 trisphosphate (PIP3; Fig. 5 A). In neurons treated with B4-ECD, we detected an increase in PIP3 staining along tau-positive axons. This response was comparable to that seen after acute treatment with 100 ng/ml NGF and was completely blocked in cultures pretreated with 500 nM of the PtdIns 3K inhibitor wortmannin (WM).

Type III Nrg1 back signaling activates the PtdIns 3K signaling pathway. (A) Dissociated sensory neurons from E11 chick embryos were treated for 5 min with B2-ECD (control), B4-ECD, 50 ng/ml NGF, or 10 ng/ml of soluble Nrg1beta peptide (Nrg1-ECD). In parallel, neurons were treated with WM for 45 min before B4-ECD stimulation (WM + B4-ECD). Neurons were fixed, permeabilized, and costained for PIP3 (red) and tau protein (blue) to label axons. Both B4-ECD (g) and NGF (i) treatment induced puncta of PIP3 along tau-positive axons. Neither B4-ECD stimulation in the presence of WM (c and h) nor that of Nrg1-ECD (e and j) induced an increase in PIP3. Confocal images were obtained with a 40x oil objective. Bar, 10 mum. (B) Immunoblot analysis of phospho-Akt (Ser 473) in WT or Type III Nrg1-/- sensory neurons treated with either B2-ECD (control) or B4-ECD for 10 min. In WT neurons, B4-ECD treatment induced an approximately threefold increase in phospho-Akt, whereas no response was detected in mutant neurons. Total Akt in the bottom panel shows equal lysate loading. The bar graph represents phospho-Akt normalized to total Akt immunoreactive bands. Data are representative of three independent experiments. The graph shows means +/- SEM. Statistical significance was determined by ANOVA with post-hoc Fisher's PLSD test. *, P < 0.002 (Statview). (C and D) E14.5 WT (a and b) or Type III Nrg1-/- (c and d) DRG explants were treated with B2-ECD (control) or B4-ECD for 10 min. Surface-bound B4-ECD or B2-ECD were labeled with an antibody against the human Fc domain (anti-Fc; green) before fixation. Neurons were fixed, permeabilized, and stained for phospho-Akt (red) and NF protein (blue). B4-ECD treatment increased phospho-Akt along Fc-positive axons of WT neurons (b and D) but did not do so along axons of mutant neurons (d). Note the close proximity of anti-FC and phospho-Akt puncta in the high-power micrograph shown in e. The asterisk denotes an axon negative for both anti-Fc and phospho-Akt immunolabeling (c). A 63x oil objective was used (a-d). Confocal imaging was obtained with a 100x oil objective (D). Bar: (a-d)10 mum; (D) 5 mum. (E) Quantification of the average fluorescence intensity (AFI) of phospho-Akt along axons of WT or Type III Nrg1-/- sensory neurons treated with B2-ECD (control) or B4-ECD for 10 min or 1, 2, or 6 h (see Materials and methods). Along WT axons, B4-ECD treatment induced increases in phospho-Akt. Along axons of mutant neurons, we did not detect an increase in phospho-Akt in response to B4-ECD treatment. The graph shows means +/- SEM. Data are from three independent experiments. Statistical significance was determined by ANOVA. *, P < 0.02.

As an additional test of whether Type III Nrg1 back signaling activates a PtdIns 3K signaling pathway, we measured the phosphorylation status of the PtdIns 3K effector kinase Akt in WT and Type III Nrg1-/- sensory neurons (Fig. 5, B-D; and Fig. S3, A-D, available at ). After a 10-min B4-ECD treatment, we detected phospho-Akt in puncta along B4-ECD-bound axons of WT neurons; however, we did not detect a change in phospho-Akt in axons from mutant explants (Fig. 5, C and D). The response to B4-ECD treatment was selective for the neurons and for the PtdIns 3K-Akt pathway. There was no activation of Akt in nonneuronal cells (Fig. S3 A) and there was no activation of MAPK in neurons (Fig. S3 E). Additionally, B4-ECD treatment was able to induce activation of Akt when ErbB kinase activity (Fig. S3 C) and NGF/TrkA signaling (Fig. S3 D) were blocked. Thus, we conclude that Type III Nrg1 back signaling rapidly and locally activates PtdIns 3K signaling.

We tested whether PtdIns 3K activation is required for Type III Nrg1-mediated changes in alpha7* nAChR surface expression (Fig. 6). We treated dispersed sensory neurons with either B2-ECD (control) or B4-ECD for 1 h in the presence of 500 nM of the PtdIns 3K inhibitor WM. Surface alpha7* nAChR clusters were labeled with alphaBgTx-488 (green), after which neurons were fixed and immunolabeled with an antibody against NF protein (blue; Fig. 6 A). In response to the B4-ECD treatment, we detected a significant increase in the number (Fig. 6 B) and area (Fig. 6 C) of alphaBgTx-488 clusters along NF-positive processes. WM treatment alone did not affect the number of alphaBgTx-488 clusters but did inhibit the response to B4-ECD, preventing the increase in the number of axonal surface alpha7*nAChRs (Fig. 6 B, B2-ECD [control], 9.08 +/- 1.53 clusters/100-mum axonal length; B4-ECD, 17.41 +/- 1.48 clusters/100-mum axonal length; WM, 9.58 +/- 2.17 clusters/100-mum axonal length; and WM + B4-ECD, 10.75 +/- 1.27 clusters/100-mum axonal length). Pretreatment with 5 muM of a small molecule inhibitor of Akt kinase activity (Akt inhibitor [Akt inh.]) also prevented the response to B4-ECD (Fig. 6 B, Akt inh., 10.33 +/- 1.42 clusters/100-mum axonal length; and Akt inh. + B4-ECD, 8.48 +/- 1.58 clusters/100-mum axonal length). Both WM and Akt inh. prevented the increase in surface alphaBgTx cluster area in response to B4-ECD treatment (Fig. 6 C, B2-ECD [control], 0.25 +/- 0.02 mum2; B4-ECD, 0.35 +/- 0.02 mum2; WM, 0.22 +/- 0.02 mum2; WM + B4-ECD, 0.23 +/- 0.02 mum2; Akt inh., 0.22 +/- 0.02 mum2; and Akt inh. + B4-ECD, 0.25 +/- 0.02 mum2). We conclude that Type III Nrg1 back signaling activates PtdIns 3K signaling and that PtdIns 3K/Akt activities are required for Type III Nrg1-induced targeting of alpha7* nAChRs to the axonal surface.

Nrg1-ErbB signaling plays an important role in synaptic plasticity, in part by regulating the levels of pre- and postsynaptic receptors and ion channels (Ozaki et al., 1997; Huang et al., 2000; Chae et al., 2005; Gu et al., 2005; Kwon et al., 2005; Bjarnadottir et al., 2007; Li et al., 2007; Role and Talmage, 2007; Woo et al., 2007), including nAChRs containing the alpha7 subunit (Yang et al., 1998; Liu et al., 2001; Kawai et al., 2002; Chang and Fischbach, 2006). In this study we demonstrate that Type III Nrg1, acting as a receptor for ErbB4, controls the insertion of alpha7* nAChRs into axonal membranes. Type III Nrg1 accomplishes this by activating a local PtdIns 3K signaling pathway. These findings expand the repertoire of identified mechanisms by which Type III Nrg1 bidirectional signaling contributes to the establishment and the maturation of functional presynaptic terminals (Bao et al., 2003, 2004). Our major findings supporting this conclusion are the following: genetic disruption of Type III Nrg1 affects surface alpha7* nAChR levels; Type III Nrg1 functioning as a receptor can regulate insertion of preformed alpha7* nAChRs into axonal surfaces; and Type III Nrg1 activates an axonal PtdIns 3K signaling pathway that mediates increased levels of surface alpha7* nAChRs.

Prior work has shown that presynaptic Type III Nrg1 is critical for establishing stable interactions with postsynaptic partners and, ultimately, for the survival of neuromuscular synapses as well as for glia development and myelination (Wolpowitz et al., 2000; Michailov et al., 2004; Taveggia et al., 2005; Chen et al., 2006). Our studies demonstrate that Type III Nrg1 acts as a presynaptic signaling receptor. Activation of presynaptic Type III Nrg1 signaling, either by postsynaptic ErbB4 (as shown in Fig. S4, available at ), by the ErbB3 present on glia, or after depolarization (Bao et al., 2003, 2004), locally regulates the levels of presynaptic alpha7* nAChR surface expression. As a result, Type III Nrg1 back signaling, by regulating presynaptic alpha7* nAChRs, alters the magnitude of acetylcholine modulation of neurotransmitter release (MacDermott et al., 1999; Jones and Wonnacott, 2004).

We demonstrate that stimulating Type III Nrg1 activates a PtdIns 3K signaling pathway and that PtdIns 3K and Akt activity are required for increased surface expression of alpha7* nAChRs. At present, we do not know the molecular details of how Type III Nrg1 communicates with the PtdIns 3K signaling pathway or what Akt substrates regulate alpha7* nAChR trafficking. The intracellular domains of Type III Nrg1 lack known functional motifs that could mediate protein-protein interactions.

PtdIns 3K and its product PIP3 are ubiquitous signaling molecules that link cell surface receptors to intracellular downstream effectors. PtdIns 3K signaling regulates the trafficking of several cell surface proteins, such as glucose transporter 4 (Tengholm and Meyer, 2002), excitatory amino acid carrier 1 glutamate transporter (Davis et al., 1998), calcium channels (Viard et al., 2004), and alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid receptors (Man et al., 2003). An increased understanding of the molecular mechanisms that regulate trafficking of these proteins is certain to inform our further studies on presynaptic alpha7* nAChR targeting.

We have used alphaBgTx binding to identify both surface and internal pools of alpha7* nAChRs. alphaBgTx binding requires at least partial assembly of alpha7 subunits into pentamers (Mitra et al., 2001). Because we do not see effects of Type III Nrg1 back signaling on alphaBgTx binding in permeabilized cells, it is unlikely that the early stages of assembling alpha7 subunits into functional receptors are targeted by back signaling. Assembly of alpha7* nAChRs and trafficking of alpha7* nAChRs through the exocytic pathway can be influenced by synaptic scaffolding proteins such as PICK1 (Baer et al., 2007), reversible palmitoylation (of alpha7* nAChRs by itself; Drisdel et al., 2004), tyrosine residues on unidentified proteins (Cho et al., 2005), and chronic nicotine (Marks et al., 1992). Any of these mechanisms might represent convergent targets with Type III Nrg1-PtdIns 3K signaling for influencing the rate of ER/Golgi to plasma membrane trafficking of alpha7* nAChRs.

Targeting nAChRs to presynaptic locales is an important part of establishing a plastic synapse. The alpha7* nAChRs in particular play a critical role in sustained modulation of neurotransmitter release (McGehee et al., 1995; Girod et al., 2000). Deficits in Type III Nrg1 signaling compromise the ability of nicotine to elicit sustained glutamatergic transmission at ventral hippocampal to nucleus accumbens synapses (Du, C., C. Zhong, M. Hancock, D.A. Talmage, and L.W. Role. 2004. Society for Neuroscience 34th Annual Meeting; unpublished data) and, based on the results presented here, we would predict a similar effect on nicotine/acetylcholine modulation of glutamate release from primary sensory afferents in the dorsal spinal cord (Genzen and McGehee, 2003). From the present data, we cannot say whether the requirement for Type III Nrg1 signaling is limited to developmental synaptogenesis or whether it continues to affect presynaptic alpha7* nAChR targeting to established synapses, contributing to the maintenance of synaptic plasticity throughout the lifespan. If Type III Nrg1 signaling does continue to regulate presynaptic levels of alpha7* nAChR or other receptors, then modulation of Type III Nrg1 signaling in sensory axons could contribute to adaptive physiological changes or to pathological changes in sensory transduction (Bermingham-McDonogh et al., 1997; Kerber et al., 2003).

There are interesting parallels between our findings and pathophysiological studies. Increasing evidence from genetic linkage studies has identified both the NRG1 (Stefansson et al., 2002; Harrison and Law, 2006) and the alpha7 nAChR gene CHRNA7 (Freedman et al., 2001; Leonard and Freedman, 2006) as susceptibility genes for schizophrenia. Postmortem studies have demonstrated decreased levels of alphaBgTx binding in the hippocampus of schizophrenic patients (Freedman et al., 1995; Breese et al., 2000), and decreased levels of alpha7 mRNA and alphaBgTx binding in dorsal lateral prefrontal cortex of schizophrenic brain are associated with risk alleles at the NRG1 locus (Mathew et al., 2007). It is worth noting that these risk alleles at the NRG1 locus also have been associated with increased expression of Type I and IV Nrg1 (Law et al., 2006). This raises the possibility that excess levels of soluble Nrg1 peptide disturbs the balance of bidirectional Nrg1-ErbB signaling that serves to ensure normal levels of functional alpha7* nAChRs.

Cells were fixed and incubated in rabbit anti-Alexa 488 (1:250; Invitrogen) overnight at 4degreesC, followed by secondary antibody incubation. Surface cluster number and area were measured along NF-positive processes (>/=10 mum from soma) using Metamorph software. The lengths of axonal processes were measured by manually tracing NF-positive processes. Control cultures in each experiment were used to define the threshold for measuring clusters at 50% maximum intensity and greater than or equal to four contiguous pixels (Kawai et al., 2002). To determine nonspecific binding, cultures were treated with 1 muM of nicotine or 5 muM methyllycaconitine before labeling.

For normally distributed data, statistical significance was evaluated by ANOVA with a post-hoc Fischer's PLSD test for multiple comparisons (Statview; Adept Scientific). Non-normally distributed data were analyzed using nonparametric methods and are presented using box plots. The boxes include data points within the middle 50%. The bottom marks the twenty-fifth percentile, the middle line the fiftieth percentile, and the top the seventy-fifth percentile. Vertical lines mark the fifth and ninety-fifth percentiles (see Devay et al. [1999] for a detailed description of data presentation). Statistical significance was evaluated by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test.

In Fig. S1, we show that endocytic recycling of transferrin (A and B) and the trafficking of presynaptic proteins vGlut1 and synaptophysin (C and D) are not impaired in Type III Nrg1-/- sensory neurons. Additionally, we show that activation of Type III Nrg1 back-signaling does not induce an increase in the surface expression of TrkA along axons (E and F). Fig. S2 shows soluble ErbB4-ECD (B4-ECD) bound to Type III Nrg1 puncta along WT axons only (A). B4-ECD treatment induces an increase in the axonal surface expression of alpha7*nAChRs in a dose-dependent manner (B). Fig. S3 shows that Type III Nrg1 back signaling activates Akt in neurons and not nonneuronal cells (A). Inhibition of ErbB (B) or TrkA (C) kinase activity does not prevent the B4-ECD-induced response. We also show that B4-ECD treatment does not activate MAPK in neurons (D). Fig. S4 consists a diagram summarizing a mechanism by which Type III Nrg1 back-signaling regulates the levels of alpha7*nAChRs along axons. Online supplemental material is available at .
