We report the nucleotide sequence of a gene encoding the constant region of a human immunoglobulin gamma 1 heavy chain (C gamma 1). A comparison of this sequence with those of the C gamma 2 and C gamma 4 genes reveals that these three human C gamma genes share considerable homology in both coding and noncoding regions. The nucleotide sequence differences indicate that these genes diverged from one another approximately 608 million years ago. An examination of hinge exons shows that these coding regions have evolved more rapidly than any other areas of the C gamma genes in terms of both base substitution and deletion/insertion events. Coding sequence diversity also is observed in areas of CH domains which border the hinge.
