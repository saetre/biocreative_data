Optineurin is a ubiquitously expressed multifunctional cytoplasmic protein encoded by OPTN gene. The expression of optineurin is induced by various cytokines. Here we have investigated the molecular mechanisms which regulate optineurin gene expression and the relationship between optineurin and nuclear factor kappaB (NF-kappaB). We cloned and characterized human optineurin promoter. Optineurin promoter was activated upon treatment of HeLa and A549 cells with tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFalpha). Mutation of a putative NF-kappaB-binding site present in the core promoter resulted in loss of basal as well as TNFalpha-induced activity. Overexpression of p65 subunit of NF-kappaB activated this promoter through NF-kappaB site. Oligonucleotides corresponding to this putative NF-kappaB-binding site showed binding to NF-kappaB. TNFalpha-induced optineurin promoter activity was inhibited by expression of inhibitor of NF-kappaB (IkappaBalpha) super-repressor. Blocking of NF-kappaB activation resulted in inhibition of TNFalpha-induced optineurin gene expression. Overexpressed optineurin partly inhibited TNFalpha-induced NF-kappaB activation in Hela cells. Downregulation of optineurin by shRNA resulted in an increase in TNFalpha-induced as well as basal NF-kappaB activity. These results show that optineurin promoter activity and gene expression are regulated by NF-kappaB pathway in response to TNFalpha. In addition these results suggest that there is a negative feedback loop in which TNFalpha-induced NF-kappaB activity mediates expression of optineurin, which itself functions as a negative regulator of NF-kappaB.

Optineurin is a cytoplasmic protein that is ubiquitously expressed although it shows higher level of expression in retina, brain, heart, skeletal muscle, placenta and kidney [1]-[4]. Mutations in optineurin are associated with certain glaucomas, a group of eye diseases that cause blindness [5]-[14]. Optineurin interacts with several proteins such as Rab8, Huntingtin, myosin VI, RIP, transcription factor IIIA, metabotropic glutamate receptor, TBK1 etc [1], [15]-[20]. Based on interaction with myosin VI, its role in vesicular trafficking between Golgi and plasma membrane has been proposed [17]. Recently it has been shown that optineurin negatively regulates TNFalpha-induced NF-kappaB activation by binding to polyubiquitinated RIP (19). Towards the C-terminal end, a ubiquitin-binding domain has been identified in optineurin, which is also present in NEMO, a sub-unit of protein kinase IKK complex involved in NF-kappaB regulation [19]. Optineurin plays a role in the regulation of expression of many genes [21] although the mechanisms involved are yet to be elucidated. Optineurin gene and protein expression is induced by treatment of cells with TNFalpha and interferons [1], [16]. However the mechanisms by which these cytokines activate optineurin gene expression are not known.

TNFalpha is a cytokine that plays an important role in inflammation, immune response, regulation of cell death, cell proliferation and cancer [22], [23]. The biological effects of TNFalpha are mediated by its binding to trimeric receptor, TNFR-1 which results in activation of two important signalling pathways that lead to activation of transcription factor NF-kappaB and caspase-8. NF-kappaB comprises a family of inducible transcription factors that serve as important regulators of host immune response and inflammatory response [22], [23]. NF-kappaB is also involved in protecting cells from apoptosis by inducing many anti-apoptotic genes. NF-kappaB activity is regulated through association with an inhibitor, IkappaB which keeps NF-kappaB in the cytoplasm [22], [23]. NF-kappaB is activated in the trabecular meshwork cells in glaucoma where it is involved in cytoprotection in response to oxidative stress [24].

Overexpressed optineurin provides protection to NIH 3T3 cells against cell death induced by high level of oxidative stress [4]. Recently we have shown that overexpression of normal optineurin sensitizes RGC-5 cells to TNFalpha-induced cell death whereas in HeLa cells it reduces TNFalpha-induced cell death [25]. It is likely that altered level of endogenous optineurin may affect survival of cells under certain conditions of stress. It has been suggested that reduction in expression of optineurin due to mutation in the coding region, rather than altered function may contribute to the development of glaucoma [19]. Therefore it is important to understand the molecular mechanisms which regulate the level of optineurin.

Here we have investigated the molecular mechanisms which regulate optineurin gene expression, and also studied the relationship between optineurin and NF-kappaB. We have cloned and characterized human optineurin promoter. The results presented here show that optineurin promoter activity induced by TNFalpha is regulated by NF-kappaB, which itself is in turn, negatively regulated by optineurin.

TNFalpha has been shown to induce optineurin gene and protein expression in HeLa and some other cells [1], [16]. To understand the molecular mechanisms involved in TNFalpha-induced optineurin gene expression we used human lung carcinoma cell line A549 which is responsive to TNFalpha. Initially we confirmed that TNFalpha treatment increases optineurin gene expression in A549 cells in a time-dependent manner as determined by real time RT-PCR analysis (Fig. 1A). The optineurin mRNA level increased by 3 hours of TNFalpha treatment reaching maximum level after 6 hours. The optineurin mRNA level remained at increased level even after 24 hours of treatment with TNFalpha. The level of optineurin protein increased gradually upon TNFalpha treatment and reached high level after 24 hours (Fig. 1B). In contrast IRF-1 protein level showed a transient increase after 3 hours of TNFalpha treatment and declined thereafter (Fig. 1B).

We cloned about 1 kb of DNA sequence upstream of human optineurin cDNA sequence by designing appropriate primers. This putative optineurin promoter sequence matched completely with the sequence reported in human genome data base. This putative promoter was cloned in pGL-3 promoterless vector upstream of luciferase reporter gene. This promoter-reporter plasmid (FP) was transfected in HeLa cells and after 24 h these cells were lysed for reporter assays. This promoter showed 147-fold higher activity than the promoterless vector (figure not shown). The activity of this promoter was increased by 2.3-fold upon treatment of cells with TNFalpha in A549 cells (Fig. 1C) and by 60% in HeLa cells (Fig. 1D).

The nucleotide sequence of this 1077 bp putative promoter, which includes 221 bp of exon-1, is shown in Figure 2A. There are 4 splice variants reported for optineurin mRNA in the database which differ in their 5'-untranslated region but code for the same 577 amino acid protein (Accession Nos. NM_001008211, NM_001008212, NM_001008213 and NM_021980). Exon-1 is present in all these 4 variants. The beginning of exon-1 is denoted as +1. Analysis of this promoter showed several putative Sp1 sites and one NF-kappaB site located immediately upstream of transcription start site (Fig. 2A). There is no TATA box or initiator element present in this promoter. Putative binding sites for heat shock factors, HSF1 and HSF2, MyoD, neuron-restrictive silencing factor (NRSF, also known as REST) and cyclic AMP response element binding protein (CREB) were also identified. A smaller promoter was made which contained putative Sp1 sites and the NF-kappaB site (-136 to +221; named DP). This smaller promoter was activated by TNFalpha as the full length promoter in A549 and HeLa cells (Fig. 1C, D). The smaller promoter showed more basal activity than the full length promoter in A549 as well as in HeLa cells (Fig. 1C, D). These results showed that the DNA sequence elements which mediate TNFalpha-induced as well as basal promoter activity are present in the small promoter. In addition these results suggest that a negative regulatory element is present in sequences upstream of the minimal promoter.

One of the important signalling pathways induced by TNFalpha results in the activation of transcription factor NF-kappaB. Therefore we mutated the putative NF-kappaB site in optineurin promoter and analysed the effect of this mutation on reporter activity. Three nucleotides in the core sequence of putative NF-kappaB binding site were mutated (GGG changed to CTC, Fig. 2B). Mutation of NF-kappaB site in full length as well as minimal promoter resulted in nearly complete loss of activation by TNFalpha in A549 cells (Fig. 2C, D). In addition, basal promoter activity was also significantly reduced in full length as well as minimal promoter (Fig. 2C, D). These results showed that NF-kappaB site is required for activation of optineurin promoter by TNFalpha. In addition our results suggest that NF-kappaB site is required for basal promoter activity.

A synthetic oligonucleotide corresponding to putative NF-kappaB site present in the optineurin promoter was used for gel shift assay (Fig. 3A). The oligonucleotide was labelled with 32P and incubated with nuclear extract prepared from A549 cells treated with TNFalpha for 15 min. Binding to this oligonucleotide was competed out with 50-fold excess of unlabeled self oligonucleotide and also with consensus NF-kappaB-binding oligonucleotide (Fig. 3B) but not by a mutant oligonucleotide in which NF-kappaB site was inactivated by substitution of 3 nucleotides (Fig. 3B). Preincubation of the nuclear extract with p65 NF-kappaB antibody resulted in the super shift of the band. Gel shift assay was also carried out with nuclear extract from control untreated cells which did not show the upper band shifted by p65 antibody (Figure 3C). These results along with mutational analysis of the promoter show that a functional NF-kappaB-binding site is present in optineurin promoter.

The gel shift assay showed that p65 was able to bind NF-kappaB site present in the optineurin promoter. To further analyse the role of p65 NF-kappaB, A549 cells were transfected with optineurin promoter-reporter plasmid with or without p65 expression plasmid. Coexpression of p65 resulted in an increase in promoter activity but the mutant promoter (in which NF-kappaB site was abrogated) was not activated by p65 (Fig. 4A).

In resting cells most of the NF-kappaB remains inactive due to its sequestration in the cytoplasm by a group of inhibitory proteins known as inhibitors of kappaB (IkappaB). Upon stimulation by a cytokine like TNFalpha, IkappaBs are rapidly phosphorylated and then degraded by ubiquitin proteasome pathway resulting in the nuclear translocation of NF-kappaB. Since NF-kappaB activation depends on IkappaB, we looked into the effect of IkappaB on optineurin promoter activity. For this purpose we used a super-repressor form of IkappaBalpha in which two serine residues (S32, S36) are mutated so that it is not phosphorylated or degraded. Optineurin promoter reporter plasmids were transfected with or without IkappaBalpha super-repressor plasmid in A549 cells. After 6 hours of transfection TNFalpha was added. TNFalpha increased the promoter activity by 2.6 fold. Overexpression of IkappaBalpha super-repressor abrogated the TNF-alpha induced activation of the promoter. Basal activity of the promoter was also reduced upon coexpression of IkappaBalpha (Fig. 4B). These results suggest that optineurin promoter activity is regulated by IkappaB-NF-kappaB pathway in response to TNFalpha.

Our experiments described so far suggested that NF-kappaB plays an important role in optineurin promoter activation by TNFalpha. We next examined the role of NF-kappaB in optineurin gene expression in response to TNFalpha. For this purpose we used proteasome inhibitor MG132 which inhibits NF-kappaB activation by preventing degradation of IkappaB [26]. A549 cells were pretreated with MG132 for 30 min and then treated with TNFalpha for 6 hours. Blocking of NF-kappaB activation by MG132 resulted in inhibition of TNFalpha-induced optineurin gene expression as determined by real time RT-PCR analysis (Fig. 4C). Blocking of NF-kappaB activation also resulted in reduced level of TNFalpha-induced optineurin protein level (Fig. 4D). We also used NF-kappaB inhibitor SN-50 to check its effect on TNFalpha-induced optineurin gene expression. Pretreatment of A549 cells with SN-50 resulted in inhibition of TNFalpha-induced optineurin gene expression (Fig. 4E).

Various lines of evidence suggest that NF-kappaB is a regulator of optineurin gene expression. Some targets of NF-kappaB are known to regulate NF-kappaB activity in signaling pathways [22], [27]. Therefore we examined the role of optineurin in the modulation of TNFalpha-induced NF-kappaB activation. The effect of ectopic expression of wild type optineurin and its E50K mutant on TNFalpha-induced NF-kappaB activation was determined. HeLa cells were transfected with NF-kappaB luciferase reporter construct along with or without optineurin expression plasmids. After 22 hours of transfection these cells were treated with TNFalpha for 4 hours. Overexpression of optineurin or E50K mutant did not affect the basal NF-kappaB reporter activity. In response to TNFalpha the NF-kappaB reporter was activated to 3.7 fold. This TNFalpha-induced NF-kappaB reporter activity was partially inhibited by optineurin (Fig. 5A). These observations suggest that optineurin negatively regulates TNFalpha-induced NF-kappaB activation. The inhibition of NF-kB activation by E50K mutant was significantly more (P<0.05) than that observed with wild type optineurin. This was not due to higher level of expression of mutant optineurin (Figure 5B). To further validate these observations, effect of overexpression of optineurin and its E50K mutant on TNFalpha-induced nuclear translocation of NF-kappaB p65 was investigated. HeLa cells grown on coverslips were transfected with a plasmid expressing HA-tagged optineurin, and after 24 hours these cells were treated with TNFalpha for 30 min. The cells were then stained for optineurin (HA antibody) and NF-kappaB p65. Microscopic examination of cells revealed that nuclear translocation of NF-kappaB p65 was inhibited in most of the cells expressing exogenous optineurin and its E50K mutant (Fig. 5C).

TNFalpha stimulus results in rapid phosphorylation and proteasome mediated degradation of IkappaB proteins, resulting in nuclear translocation of NF-kappaB subunits where they regulate the expression of target genes. HeLa cells were infected with adenoviruses expressing wild type or E50K mutant optineurin and were treated with TNFalpha for 6 min and 12 min. A significant amount of IkappaB-alpha was degraded by 6 min of TNFalpha stimulation and by 12 min it was almost completely degraded. In cells overexpressing E50K mutant, substantial levels of IkappaB-alpha persisted even after 12 min of TNFalpha treatment suggesting that E50K mutant inhibits TNFalpha-induced IkappaB-alpha degradation (Fig. 5D). IkappaB-alpha levels were higher in TNFalpha-treated cells expressing E50K mutant compared to those expressing wild type optineurin. These results suggest that E50K mutant optineurin inhibits TNFalpha-induced NF-kappaB activation by possibly affecting an upstream event.

A recent study has shown that optineurin binds lysine 63-linked polyubiquitin chains, and competes with NEMO for the binding of ubiquitinated RIP. A mutation in the conserved ubiquitin binding region (D474N) abolishes ubiquitin binding ability of optineurin and NF-kappaB activation [19]. Since E50K mutant optineurin inhibits TNFalpha-induced NF-kappaB activation more strongly than wild type optineurin, a mutant of optineurin containing both E50K and D474N mutations was generated to gain further insights into the regulation of TNFalpha-induced NF-kappaB signaling by mutant optineurin. HeLa cells were transfected with D474N or E50K or E50K-D474N mutants along with NF-kappaB luciferase reporter. As expected the D474N mutant optineurin did not inhibit TNFalpha-induced NF-kappaB activation. However, the E50K-D474N double mutant also did not inhibit TNFalpha- induced NF-kappaB activation (Fig. 5A). The expression of mutants was confirmed by Western blotting (Fig. 5B). To further validate these observations, sub-cellular distribution of p65 subunit of NF-kappaB was studied. HeLa cells were transfected with either D474N or E50K-D474N mutants and 24 hrs after transfection, cells were treated with TNFalpha for 30 min. Immunostaining of p65 showed that in response to TNFalpha, p65 translocates to nucleus in cells expressing D474N mutant and in those expressing E50K-D474N mutant optineurin (Fig. 5C). These observations suggest that the inhibition of NF-kappaB activation by E50K mutant requires a functional ubiquitin binding region.

Since overexpression of optineurin inhibited TNFalpha-induced NF-kappaB activity, we determined the effect of downregulation of endogenous optineurin on basal and TNFalpha-induced NF-kappaB activity. For this purpose two shRNAs were expressed which target two different regions of optineurin mRNA. Infection of HeLa cells with adenoviruses expressing shRNAs (Ad-shOptn1 and Ad-shOptn2) resulted in significant decrease in optineurin protein level after 72 hours of infection, as determined by western blotting (Fig. 6A); however there was no significant change in the level of IkappaBalpha or NF-kappaB p65. A virus expressing shRNA of unrelated sequence of same length was used as a control. To determine the effect of downregulation of optineurin on NF-kappaB activity, HeLa cells were infected with Ad-shOptn1, Ad-shOptn2 or control viruses. After 48 h of infection these cells were transfected with NF-kappaB reporter plasmid along with beta-galactosidase expression plasmid. After another 22 hours, these cells were treated with TNFalpha for 4 hours. Downregulation of optineurin by both shRNAs resulted in significant increase (P<0.05) in basal as well as TNFalpha-induced NF-kappaB activity (Fig. 6A, B). To determine the effect of optineurin knockdown upon IkappaBalpha levels, HeLa cells were infected with the required adenoviruses and after 72 hours treated with TNFalpha for 6 min. Western blot analysis showed that downregulation of optineurin by both shRNAs resulted in enhanced degradation of IkappaB upon TNFalpha stimulation (Fig. 6C). These results suggest that endogenous optineurin inhibits TNFalpha-induced NF-kappaB activation and this inhibition occurs at a step upstream of IkappaB degradation.

To begin to understand the molecular mechanisms which regulate optineurin gene expression we have cloned and characterized optineurin gene promoter. This promoter is active in HeLa as well A549 cells and is activated upon treatment of cells by TNFalpha. This promoter does not have a TATA box or an initiator element. It showed several putative Sp1 sites and one NF-kappaB site. Mutation of NF-kappaB site resulted in loss of activation of promoter by TNFalpha. In addition basal promoter activity was also reduced. Overexpression of IkappaBalpha resulted in inhibition of basal as well as TNFalpha-induced promoter activity. These results show that NF-kappaB is a crucial regulator of optineurin promoter activity. The location of NF-kappaB site immediately upstream of exon-1, requirement of NF-kappaB site for basal promoter activity and lack of an initiator element lead us to speculate that NF-kappaB might be involved in initiation of transcription from this promoter. Activation of optineurin promoter by TNFalpha suggests that TNFalpha-induced induction of optineurin gene expression is likely to be due to the activation of the promoter. A recent study has identified several target genes of NF-kappaB including optineurin [28].

Deletion analysis resulted in identification of a minimal or core promoter (-136 to +221) which is activated by TNFalpha and shows higher basal activity than the longer promoter in both HeLa as well as A549 cells. Higher basal activity of smaller promoter suggests that negative regulatory elements are present between -856 and -136 region of the promoter. However the negative regulatory elements present between -856 and -136 region do not seem to play a role in TNFalpha-induced activation because the core promoter shows as much activation by TNFalpha as the longer promoter. Presence of a putative MyoD-binding site in optineurin promoter might explain high level of optineurin mRNA reported in skeletal muscle from human and monkey [1], [2].

The NF-kappaB activity is increased in the trabecular meshwork cells obtained from the eyes of glaucomatous patients of diverse etiology [24]. Cells of the trabecular meshwork regulate aqueous outflow which controls intraocular pressure. It was shown that enhanced NF-kappaB activity, due to higher level of interleukin-1, protects glaucomatous trabecular meshwork cells from apoptosis induced by oxidative stress [24]. NF-kappaB p50-deficient mice develop glaucoma-like optic neuropathy [29]. Thus NF-kappaB has cytoprotective function in various tissues of the eye. Recently it has been shown that over-expressed optineurin protects NIH 3T3 cells from apoptosis induced by oxidative stress [4]. Whether NF-kappaB-induced optineurin contributes to cytoprotection against oxidative stress, is yet to be investigated.

Recently it has been shown that optineurin negatively regulates basal as well as TNFalpha-induced NF-kappaB activity in some cell lines like HeLa S3 and Hek293 [19]. Our results show that optineurin inhibits TNFalpha-induced NF-kappaB activity in HeLa cells although basal activity was not inhibited. However downregulation of endogenous optineurin by shRNA resulted in upregulation of basal as well as TNFalpha-induced NF-kappaB activity. It has been suggested that TNFalpha-induced NF-kappaB activity is inhibited by optineurin due to its competition with NEMO for binding to ubiquitinated RIP [19]. The mechanism by which optineurin negatively regulates basal NF-kappaB activity is yet to be determined. A glaucoma-associated mutant of optineurin, E50K, showed significantly more inhibition of TNFalpha-induced NF-kappaB activation in HeLa cells. However this may not have any relevance to glaucoma.

NF-kappaB activation is associated with several diseases such as chronic inflammation, cancer and glaucoma [24], [30], [31]. Induction of optineurin gene expression by metastasis promoting protein S100A4 [32] and the regulation of optineurin promoter by NF-kappaB provide a basis for exploring the role of optineurin in cancer development.

On the basis of our results we suggest that there is a negative feedback loop in which TNFalpha-induced NF-kappaB activity induces expression of optineurin, which itself functions as a negative regulator of NF-kappaB. Some other negative regulators of NF-kappaB, such as IkappaB and CylD, are also induced by NF-kappaB in response to TNFalpha [22], [27]. Since optineurin protein level increases significantly after 18-24 hours of treatment with TNFalpha, it is likely that optineurin plays a more significant role in modulating NF-kappaB activity at a later stage.
###end p 46
###begin p 47
In conclusion our results show that the induction of optineurin gene expression and promoter activation by TNFalpha is mediated by NF-kappaB through a binding site in the promoter. Our results also suggest that the relationship between NF-kappaB and optineurin is quite complex because NF-kappaB induces optineurin, which negatively regulates NF-kappaB activity. Since NF-kappaB and optineurin have been linked to glaucoma, their reciprocal regulation might have relevance to etiopathogenesis of glaucoma.

The optineurin promoter was cloned from human genomic DNA by utilizing the PCR. The primers used were: forward, Opt-F, 5'-CCGCTCGAGTCAGGCTTGGCCAGGCA3' Opt-R, 5'-CCCAAGCTTCTGCCGCCCGGCTTGGCTT3'. The amplified promoter fragment of 1077 bp was cloned into the pMOSBlue vector (Amersham) and sequenced. The sequence of this promoter matched completely with that present in the database (Homo sapiens chromosome 10 genomic contig, reference assembly, Ref. NT_077569.2 HS10_77618 from nucleotide 7504122 to 7505198). Deletion construct (357 bp; named DP) was made from the full length promoter (FP) using forward primer 5'-CCGCTCGAGACGGACAGCGAGGGTGGGTA-3' and same reverse primer as used for amplifying full length promoter. The optineurin promoter fragment was then excised by digestion with HindIII and XhoI, and subcloned into the pGL3-BASIC vector (Promega, Madison, WI, USA). NF-kappaB site in both the FP and DP were mutated by site directed mutagenesis with the primers, 5'-GGG CCC CTC AAA TTC CCC GGC G-3' and 5'-CGC CGG GGA ATT TGA GGG GCC C-3'. The nucleotide sequence of all constructs was confirmed by automated DNA sequencing. Putative transcription factor binding sites were determined by using MatInspector from Genomatics Software. For determining promoter activity the cells grown in 24-well plates were transfected with 100 ng of the required pGL3 construct, 50 ng of pCMV.SPORT-beta-gal (Invitrogen) and with the required amount of the other plasmids. The total amount of plasmid in each transfection was kept constant (400 ng for each well of a 24-well plate) by adding control plasmid. Lysates were generally made 24 hour post-transfection. Preparation of lysates and luciferase assays were carried out as per the instruction of manufacturer (Promega). Relative luciferase activities were calculated after normalizing with beta-galactosidase enzyme activities.

EMSA was carried out as previously described in detail [35]. Briefly, nuclear extracts were prepared from A549 cells after treatment with TNF-alpha for 15 min and then stored at -70degreesC. EMSA was performed by incubating 2 microl of nuclear extract for 15 min at 37degreesC with 1 ng of 32P-end-labeled 22-mer double-stranded oligonucleotide containing the NF-kappaB-binding site (5'-GGG CCC GGG AAA TTC CCC GGC G-3'). The DNA-protein complex formed was separated from free oligonucleotide on 5% native polyacrylamide gel, and the gel was then dried. The specificity of binding was examined by competition with the unlabeled self, mutant and consensus oligonucleotides.

Downregulation of endogenous optineurin was achieved by shRNA (small hairpin RNA) mediated knockdown. For this purpose adenoviral vectors expressing shRNAs were generated. As a first step the shRNA expression vectors targeting two different regions of optineurin were generated essentially as described [33], [36]. The desired oligonucleotides were annealed and cloned into BbsI-XbaI sites of U6 promoter plasmid mU6 pro. The optineurin sequence targeted by shOptn1 was from nucleotides 1076-1094 and for shOptn2 was from 2046-2064 (GenBank accession NM_001008211). The sequences of the oligonucleotides used for cloning were:

The adenoviral vectors expressing shRNAs were generated by using pAdEASY system [37] kindly provided by B. Vogelstein (Howard Hughes Medical Institute and Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Center, The John Hopkins Medical Institutions, Baltimore, MD, USA). The transcriptional units of shOPTN1 and shOPTN2 shRNAs from the pMU6 vector were subcloned into the adenoviral vector as described previously [37], [38]. The shRNA cassettes were released along with the mU6 promoter by HindIII-XbaI digestion and cloned into pAdTrack plasmid upstream of CMV-GFP cassette. Recombinant plasmids were generated by homologous recombination in AdEasier cells. The recombinant adenoviral plasmids were linearized with PacI and transfected in HEK293T cells using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). Recombinant viruses were collected after 15 days by lysing these HEK293T cells. A control virus was also made which expressed unrelated shRNA of the same length. All these adenoviruses express GFP to monitor the infection of cells.
