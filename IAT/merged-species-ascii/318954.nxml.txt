The primary structures of a cDNA and the genomic DNA of a gene selectively expressed in chronic lymphocytic leukemia were determined. A computer search of the nucleotide sequence data bank identified this gene as the invariant gamma-chain associated with class II histocompatibility antigens. The invariant gamma-chain genomic sequence spans about 11 kilobases, with eight exons and seven introns. Three of the introns contain members of the Alu repeat family. A putative cap site and promoter sequence were identified at the 5' end of the gene. One or two copies of the gene is present in each haploid genome, and no evidence for amplification or polymorphism was obtained.
