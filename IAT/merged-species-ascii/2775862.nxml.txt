It has been reported that the immune response due to alpha-Gal epitopes is an important factor in tissue valve failure. The elimination of the interaction between the natural anti-Gal antibodies and alpha-gal epitopes on the xenografts is a prerequisite to the success of xenografts in humans. Previously, we reported that the green coffee bean alpha-galactosidase could remove all alpha-Gal epitopes from cell surface of porcine aortic valve and pericardial tissue, but it has limitations on cost effectiveness. In this study we wanted to know whether the recently produced recombinant human alpha-galactosidase A has the same effective enzymatic activity as green coffee bean alpha-galactosidase in removing alpha-Gal epitopes from the same tissues. After treating fresh porcine aortic valve and pericardial tissue with recombinant alpha-galactosidase A, each sample was stained with Griffonia simplicifolia type I isolectin B4 indirect immunoperoxidase avidin-biotin technique. We then examined whether the alpha-Gal epitopes were reduced or abolished in each consecutive concentration of recombinant alpha-galactosidase A by comparing the degree of the Griffonia simplicifolia isolectin B4 staining. As a result, the recombinant alpha-galactosidase A could remove cell surface alpha-Gals on porcine aortic valve and pericardial tissue as effectively as green coffee bean alpha-galactosidase.

Tissue valves are considered as ideal human cardiac valve substitutes because they have excellent hemodynamic properties and chronic anticoagulants are not necessary. However, the structural failure after prolonged usage prevents widespread adaption of the tissue valves, especially for young age groups (1). The reasons for the structural failure of the implanted tissue valves include repetitive mechanical wear, chronic inflammatory response by glutaraldehyde fixation, and pannus overgrowth. Recently, it has been found that the mammalian cell surface xenoantigen called alpha-Gal epitopes are still present on the commercially available, glutaraldehyde fixed tissue valves (2). Additionally it has been reported that patients who received these tissue valves exhibited increased levels of natural anti-Gal antibody titers against alpha-Gal epitopes (2). Therefore, it is believed that the animal immune response may play an important role in structural damage of the commercially available, glutaraldehyde fixed tissue valves.

The alpha-Gal epitopes on the mammalian cell surface trigger a strong immune response, especially on endothelial cells, resulting in a hyperacute rejection when we transplant mammalian organs to the primates (3). On the other hand, xenoantigen mediated immune response of the tissue valves were not seriously considered until now because the valvular tissue and pericardium of mammals were treated with glutaraldehyde to eradicate xenoantigenicity and potential risk of xenozoonosis before using them to make tissue valves. However, after anti-Gal immune response in glutaraldehyde treated, commercially available tissue valves was recently observed, there is a heightened concern in the immune response as a cause of tissue valve structural failure.

In porcine aortic valvular tissue and pericardial tissue, it became possible to stain alpha-Gal epitopes on the cell surface with Griffonia simplicifolia isolectin B4 (GS-IB4) immunohistochemical stain (4-6). And as green coffee bean alpha-galactosidase is known to degrade alpha-Gal epitopes at the site of Galalpha 1-3Gal chain (7-9), it is possible that it could remove alpha-Gal epitopes from those tissues. Previously we examined this possibility and reported that all alpha-Gal epitopes could be removed from porcine valvular and pericardial cell surfaces using green coffee bean alpha-galactosidase (10). Meanwhile, there are limitations in cost effectiveness using green coffee bean alpha-galactosidase in the commercial valve manufacturing process. Therefore, we decided to investigate whether recently made, easily available recombinant human alpha-galactosidase A has same enzymatic activity as green coffee bean alpha-galactosidase, and whether the recombinant enzyme can effectively eradicate alpha-Gal epitopes on the cell surface of porcine aortic valve and pericardium. Additionally, we used standard indirect immunoperoxidase avidin-biotin technique in detecting alpha-Gals on cell surface instead of previously used immunofluorescent method.

The heart and pericardium of pigs, aged 6-12 months, were obtained from the local slaughter house and transported in 4℃ normal saline bag to our facility. After removing the aortic valve and pericardial tissue, the tissue was thoroughly washed with phosphate buffered saline (PBS). Samples of the valve and pericardial tissue of 5x5 mm size were excised and washed with PBS 3 times, 5 min each. The samples were then immersed into 30% sucrose solution for preventing cell rupture during freezing process. Next, the frozen sample were sectioned and were mounted on the slides and fixed with cold acetone for 10 min. After thorough washing in PBS 3 times, for 5 min each, the sections were incubated on the slides in 1/500 diluted 500 mg/mL GS-IB4/biotin conjugates (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, U.S.A.) at 37℃ for 1 hr. Again sections were washed as above. After blocking with 100 mL of 1% bovine serum albumin (BSA)/PBS at 37℃ for 1 hr, sections were washed as above. 100 mL of 5 mg/mL horseradishperoxidase (HRP) conjugated Streptavidin (HRP-SA) (Pierce Biotechnology, Rockford, IL, U.S.A.) were applied to the slides and incubated at 37℃ for 1 hr. Thorough washing with PBS was followed. Finally 3,3'-diaminobenzidine (DAB) substrate (DAB kit, Vector Lab., Burlingame, CA, U.S.A.) was applied on the tissue slide for 5 min and the slides were observed under mounting media. In this indirect immunoperoxidase avidinbiotin technique using DAB as a substrate, brown staining spots on the cell surface indicate GS-IB4 bound alpha-Gal epitopes.

Recombinant human alpha-galactosidase A (Isu Abxis, Seoul, Korea) made from chinese hamster ovary mammalian cells were used in our experiment. 100 mM HEPES buffer solution at pH 5.0 was prepared, and used to make concentrations of recombinant alpha-galactosidase A of 1.0, 5.0, 10.0 unit/mL. The sliced aortic valve and pericardial tissue of pig of 5x5 mm size were incubated with each of the solution for 24 hr under 4℃. After 24 hr, the tissues were washed with PBS solution for 5 min 3 times, then immersed into 30% sucrose solution. After then alpha-Gal epitopes on the enzyme treated aortic valve and pericardial tissue were stained as described above.

The images representing the distribution of alpha-Gal epitopes on porcine aortic valve and pericardial tissue before and after treatment with recombinant alpha-galactosidase A were obtained via GS-IB4 conjugated indirect immunoperoxidase avidinbiotin staining technique. After removing alpha-Gal epitopes with consecutive incubations in 1.0, 5.0, 10.0 unit/mL of recombinant alpha-galactosidase A, we noted that different degrees of alpha-Gal epitopes were removed from the tissues according to tissue type and enzyme concentration.

An enzyme concentration of 1.0 unit/mL was not enough to completely eradicate the alpha-Gal epitopes from cell surface of the aortic valve (Fig. 1). At 5.0 unit/mL, nearly all alpha-Gal epitopes were removed from cell surface according to GS-IB4 staining (Fig. 2). There were no differences between 5.0 unit/mL to 10.0 unit/mL enzyme concentrations in removing alpha-Gal epitopes from the cell surface of the porcine aortic valve (Fig. 3). Therefore, we could conclude that about 5.0 unit/mL concentration of recombinant alpha-galactosidase A with reaction conditions of pH 5.0, temperature 4℃, 24 hr of incubation was enough to remove all alpha-Gal epitopes from cell surface of porcine aortic valve. On the other hand, in porcine pericardial tissue, enzyme concentration of 1.0 unit/mL (Fig. 4) and even 5.0 unit/mL (Fig. 5) were not enough to completely eradicate alpha-Gal epitopes from cell surface. At 10.0 unit/mL, all the alpha-Gal epitopes from the cell surface of pericardium were removed according to GS-IB4 staining (Fig. 6). Therefore, in porcine pericardial tissue, the more recombinant alpha-galactosidase A was needed to remove all alpha-Gal epitopes from cell surface than that needed in aortic valve. This finding is in accordance with the result of our previous study (10).

Improving the durability of the tissue valves are crucial, not only for the children-adolescent patients but also for the increasing number of elderly patients receiving tissue valves in the aortic valve position. Recently, nearly 70% of aortic valve replacement in the patients older than 70 yr were done using tissue valves (11, 12). The tissue valve degeneration have been caused by degenerative calcification, glutaraldehyde related calcification (13), mechanical wear, and pannus overgrowth. Recently it was shown that alpha-Gal epitopes, responsible for hyperacute rejection in xenotransplantation, were still present on glutaraldehyde fixed, commercially available tissue valves. Also an increased number of anti-Gal antibodies in the patients who received those tissue valves was noted (2). Therefore, it is possible that the alpha-Gal-anti-Gal immune reaction may play a certain role in valve calcification and degradation after tissue valve replacement and removing alpha-Gals from the surface of the tissue valves can improve the durability of the tissue valves. Until now two methods of removing alpha-Gal epitopes from porcine tissues are available. One is enzymatic removal using alpha-galactosidase (7-9). The other is creating an alpha-1,3 galactosyltransferase deficient pigs (alpha-Gal knockout pigs) with the recently well established animal cloning methods (14, 15). Using alpha-Gal knockout pigs is theoretically ideal and we can use organs and tissues without a fear of hyperacute rejection. But it is not feasible now. alpha-Gal degrading enzyme is easy to use and inexpensive. However, in the enzyme treated organs alpha-Gal reappears after a certain time (9). To remove alpha-Gal epitopes from cardiac valvular and pericardial tissues, enzymatic removal is feasible because no alpha-Gal reappearance occurs in such tissues. So, we used enzymatic method to remove alpha-Gals from cell surface of the tissues.

Green coffee bean alpha-galactosidase is a plant enzyme which eradicates the xenoantigenicity of alpha-Gal by cleaving Galalpha1-3Gal chain of alpha-Gal(Galalpha1-3Galbeta1-4GlcNAc) (7-9). Previously we reported that alpha-Gal epitopes could be removed from porcine aortic valve and pericardial tissue using green coffee bean alpha-galactosidase (Sigma, St. Louis, MO, U.S.A.) (10). But green coffee bean alpha-galactosidase is not cost effective for the commercial valve manufacturing process.

Fabry disease, which exhibits X-linked genetic trait, is a congenital human alpha-galactosidase A deficiency representing early peripheral neuropathy, late chronic renal failure, coronary artery disease and cerebral vascular disease. It is well known that enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) using recombinant human alpha-galactosidase A is helpful for those patients (16, 17). Recently, recombinant human alpha-galactosidase A with Chinese hamster ovary mammalian cell expression system was developed for ERT in Fabry disease. This enzyme cleaves exactly the same site of alpha-Gal as green coffee bean alpha-galactosidase (10), which can also applied in removing alpha-Gal epitopes from cell surface of porcine aortic valve and pericardial tissue. In aortic valve, the recombinant enzyme of 5.0 unit/mL concentration could remove almost all alpha-Gals under reaction condition of pH 5.0, temperature 4℃, 24 hr of incubation. In pericardial tissue, 10.0 unit/mL concentration of the recombinant enzyme was needed.

There are several methods which can detect alpha-Gal epitopes in the tissues. First and most popular is detecting alpha-Gals with Griffonia simplicifolia type I isolectin B4 which highly specifically bind to cell surface alpha-Gals (4-6). Others are using monoclonal antibody M86 made by Galili (18), using FITC labeled anti-immunoglobulin M, anti-immunoglobulin G which are species specific secondary antibodies derived from anti-Gal immunoglobulin M and anti-Gal immunoglobulin G, respectively (7). We previously reported that all three methods of alpha-Gal detection technique must be simultaneously used to prove complete removal of alpha-Gals from cell surface (10). But in this study we intended to prove only that recombinant human alpha-galactosidase A can just as effectively remove alpha-Gal epitopes from porcine aortic valve and pericardial tissue as green coffee bean alpha-galactosidase. In other words, we did not intend to prove the completeness of removal of alpha-Gals from cell surface of those tissues. So, we did not use the three methods simultaneously. In this study we used standard indirect immunoperoxidase avidin-biotin technique instead of previously used FITC labeled immunofluorescent method in detecting GS-IB4 bound to alpha-Gals on cell surface. We used DAB (DAB kit, Vector Lab., Burlingame, CA, U.S.A.) as a substrate for the indirect immunoperoxidase avidin-biotin staining method and as a result, the cell surface alpha-Gals exhibit brown colors. In this way we could examine the distribution of alpha-Gals on cell surface more precisely and avoid autofluorescence issues of FITC.

In this study, we conclude that alpha-Gal epitopes can be removed from the porcine aortic valve and pericardial tissue using the recombinant human alpha-galactosidase A as effectively as using green coffee bean alpha-galactosidase. Thus with this recombinant enzyme, alpha-Gal deficient, more durable tissue valves can be made more economically in the future.
