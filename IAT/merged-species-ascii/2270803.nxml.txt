AMI at young age (< 45 years) is a multifaceted disorder characterized by low mortality rates, less extensive coronary artery disease (CAD), good residual left ventricular function, and a favourable prognosis [1]. In addition, young patients show lower occurrence of diabetes and hypertension, but in contrast family history of CAD, hypercholesterolemia, and smoking are more frequent [2].

Genes regulating vascular function, lipid metabolism, coagulation, fibrinolysis and inflammation factors have been only partially investigated in AMI at young age, reporting controversial results [3]. Some polymorphisms in prothrombin gene seem to be associated with increased risk of AMI at young age and Factor VII Leiden polymorphisms seem to be protective, whereas contrasting results have been reported for the polymorphism G894T in the nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) gene and polymorphism C677T in the 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) gene.

TGF-beta1 is a cytokine expressed by a broad variety of cells, including platelets, connective, haematopoietic and endothelial tissue cells [5]. TGF-beta1 is the most abundant isoform of the TGFbeta family, and it is a multifunctional cytokine regulating cell growth, differentiation and matrix production [6]. TGF-beta1 has been found to enhance the expression of mRNA encoding endothelin in vascular endothelial cells [7] and the synthesis of extracellular matrix components such as collagen, fibronectin, and proteoglycan [8].

Recent evidence suggests that pathological misregulation of the transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) pathway could be implicated in the development of several major diseases, including myocardial infarction [9], fibrotic disease [10], and inflammation processes [4]. In particular, higher levels of serum or plasma TGF-beta1 have been observed in subjects with hypertension, in association with cardiac and renal disease [11,12] or in dilated cardiomyopathy [13], both exacerbated by smoke, although leading to conflicting conclusions.

We selected three TGF-beta1 variants, two of them (G-800A and C-509T) being in the promoter region, near to the consensus DR1 or DR5 nuclear hormone receptor binding sites, crucial for influencing the TGF-beta1 synthesis. The third selected polymorphism Leu10Pro (T > C transition) is located into the peptide signal sequence and could interfere with its activity by influencing the transport of the preprotein to the endoplasmic reticulum [14].

TGF-beta1 is involved in many biological processes and misregulations in the TGF-beta pathways have been investigated in pathologic states such as cardiac hypertrophy [20], atherosclerosis [21] and inflammation processes [4]. Increased TGF-beta1 mRNA expression was also observed in human restenotic lesions [22]; on the other hand, it was postulated that increased expression of TGF-beta1 at the artery wall level, by inhibition of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC), could consequently inhibit the accumulation of lipid in vessel wall [14].

The G-800A variant, occurring at 800 base pairs upstream the 5' principal transcription start site, is located in a crucial consensus CREB half-site [24]; the A allele could inhibit the binding to the transcription factors CRE-BP, which appeared implicated in the regulation of other TGFbeta-gene family elements. As the G-800A, so the C-509T variant is a promoter polymorphism, located in a transcription factor consensus binding site; the T allele could affect the TGFbeta1 expression levels [14]. Both polymorphisms are situated close to the consensus DR1 or DR5 nuclear hormone receptor binding sites, known as crucial sequences in the regulation of the TGF-beta1 synthesis in vitro [24] and in vivo [24].

In a study of Yokota et al. [14] it was reported a correlation of the wild type allele of C-509T with low TGF-beta1 plasmatic concentration. According to these results, the T allele of C-509T was found associated with higher circulating TGF-beta1 levels [24], often related to hypertension, and in association with cardiac disease [12] or to dilated cardiomyopathy [13]. The C-509T polymorphism (and its haplotypes) was also recently found associated with myocardial infarction in men [9], even after adjustment for smoking habits, age, hypertension, diabetes and hypercholesterolemia. This result is in agreement with a possible described correlation between genetic variants in the inflammatory genes and the risk modulation of ischaemic heart disease [4]. Moreover, the Leu10Pro variant [14] was found in association with myocardial infarction (MI) in Japanese patients (OR = 3.5 p < 0.0001), although a previous European study [25] did not show any association between this polymorphism and MI.

We have found that both C-509T and Leu10Pro polymorphisms could modulate genetic susceptibility to juvenile AMI, whereas no significant differences was observed for G-800A, in agreement with some studies [9,14], but not with others [25].
###end p 69
###begin p 70
Contrasting results could be partly explained by the heterogeneity of the studies, due both to different prevalence of classical risk factors or to different genetic and ethnic backgrounds.

Our results on C-509T and Leu10Pro polymorphisms seem to support the possible relevance of this gene. In fact Leu10Pro does not change the amino-acidic polarity [25], but it is located in a crucial position [14], as above mentioned.

The relevance of C-509T and Leu10Pro is also strengthened by the haplotype results indicating a possible increased risk of AMI conferred by the GTC haplotype and a protective effect of the GCT haplotype. According to these results the putative "protective" haplotype (GCT) carries both the C-509T and Leu10Pro wild type alleles, whereas the putative "predisposing" haplotype GTC carries the mutated alleles. Moreover the two haplotypes were the most common both in cases and in controls, supporting the idea that common variants/haplotypes could be really important in determining common diseases [26]. Although the above described crucial location of the G-800A variant in the genome sequence, we did not observe a significant association between G-800A and AMI.

###begin p 73
The lack of significant results for TGF-beta1 polymorphisms/haplotypes in the follow-up analysis seems to suggest that different genetic mechanisms could be responsible for the progression of AMI.

Conclusion
###end title 74
###begin p 75
In conclusion, although it is clear that AMI is a multifactorial disease due to the combination of many genetic and well known environmental risk factors, this is the first study reporting on a significant association between TGF-beta1 polymorphisms/haplotypes and the occurrence of AMI at young age.
###end p 75
###begin p 76
Although these results warrant further investigation on larger sample size and in-depth biochemical analysis relating, for example, haplotypes to the TGF-beta1 serum levels, they indicate also the need to better clarify the role of TGF-beta pathway in AMI.
