The cytokine interleukin (IL)-1beta is a key mediator of the inflammatory response and has been implicated in the pathophysiology of acute and chronic inflammation. IL-1beta is synthesized in response to many stimuli as an inactive pro-IL-1beta precursor protein that is further processed by caspase-1 into mature IL-1beta, which is the secreted biologically active form of the cytokine. Although stimulation of membrane-bound Toll-like receptors (TLRs) up-regulates pro-IL-1beta expression, activation of caspase-1 is believed to be mainly initiated by cytosolic Nod-like receptors. In this study, we show that polyinosinic:polycytidylic acid (poly[I:C]) and lipopolysaccharide stimulation of macrophages induces pro-IL-1beta processing via a Toll/IL-1R domain-containing adaptor-inducing interferon-beta-dependent signaling pathway that is initiated by TLR3 and TLR4, respectively. Ribonucleic acid interference (RNAi)-mediated knockdown of the intracellular receptors NALP3 or MDA5 did not affect poly(I:C)-induced pro-IL-1beta processing. Surprisingly, poly(I:C)- and LPS-induced pro-IL-1beta processing still occurred in caspase-1-deficient cells. In contrast, pro-IL-1beta processing was inhibited by caspase-8 peptide inhibitors, CrmA or vFLIP expression, and caspase-8 knockdown via RNAi, indicating an essential role for caspase-8. Moreover, recombinant caspase-8 was able to cleave pro-IL-1beta in vitro at exactly the same site as caspase-1. These results implicate a novel role for caspase-8 in the production of biologically active IL-1beta in response to TLR3 and TLR4 stimulation.

IL-1beta is a master cytokine that mediates several immune responses and is synthesized as an inactive precursor that is processed into biologically active IL-1beta in response to various proinflammatory stimuli (1). It is generally accepted that pro-IL-1beta processing in response to infection and other proinflammatory conditions is mediated by caspase-1 (2). There are 11 caspases in humans, but only caspase-1 has been shown to mediate pro-IL-1beta processing. Many caspases are implicated in apoptosis, but certain caspases also exert nonapoptotic functions, including proliferation, differentiation, and NF-kappaB activation (3).

Recognition of Toll-like receptors (TLRs) by microbial or other danger-associated molecules induces the NF-kappaB-dependent transcription of the IL-1beta gene encoding an inactive pro-IL-1beta protein. Signaling leading to the proteolytic processing of pro-IL-1beta by caspase-1 is initiated by a distinct set of so-called Nod-like receptors (NLRs) as part of the "inflammasome," which is an intracellular multiprotein complex that also contains caspase-1 (2, 4-10). In this study, we demonstrate the existence of a Toll/IL-1R domain-containing adaptor-inducing IFN-beta (TRIF)-dependent signaling pathway that mediates processing and secretion of IL-1beta in response to TLR3 and TLR4 stimulation. Most interestingly, we show that TLR3- and TLR4-induced pro-IL-1beta processing is mediated by caspase-8.

We first examined the potential of TLRs to initiate pro-IL-1beta processing. TLR signaling depends on four different adaptor proteins (MyD88, MAL/TIRAP, TRAM/TICAM-2, and TRIF/TICAM-1), which bind to specific TLRs and mediate two main signaling pathways, leading to activation of NF-kappaB and IFN regulatory factor (IRF) transcription factors (11). The LPS receptor TLR4 uses MAL and TRAM as bridging adaptors for MyD88 and TRIF, respectively. The double-stranded RNA receptor TLR3 only needs TRIF, whereas all other TLRs signal via MyD88. TLR2 also requires MAL to recruit MyD88. Overexpression of each TLR adaptor was previously shown to activate NF-kappaB. Therefore, in a similar approach, we first tested whether overexpression of specific TLR adaptor proteins in human embryonic kidney 293T (HEK293T) cells triggers processing and secretion of ectopically expressed pro-IL-1beta. Production of mature IL-1beta was measured in an IL-1 bioassay (Fig. 1 A, top), as well as by Western blotting (Fig. 1 A, bottom). Interestingly, whereas all four TLR adaptors induced the activation of an NF-kappaB-dependent reporter gene (unpublished data), mature IL-1beta production could only be detected upon overexpression of the TLR3 and TLR4 adaptor protein TRIF. TRIF signaling to NF-kappaB is known to involve the binding of the TRIF N-terminal domain with TRAF6, as well as the binding of the TRIF C-terminal receptor-interacting protein (RIP) homology interaction motif (RHIM) with RIP1 (12, 13). Deletion of the C-terminal Toll/IL-1 receptor domain (TIR) and RHIM containing part of TRIF completely abolished its ability to induce pro-IL-1beta maturation (Fig. 1 B). On the other hand, a TRIF mutant lacking the TIR domain, but still containing the more C-terminal RHIM domain, was equally potent as full-length TRIF. These data illustrate an important role of the C-terminal RHIM containing domain of TRIF in signaling to pro-IL-1beta processing.

The specific ability of TRIF overexpression to trigger pro-IL-1beta processing indicates that TRIF might mediate pro-IL-1beta processing in response to TLR3 and TLR4 stimulation. We therefore tested the ability of polyinosinic:polycytidylic acid (poly[I:C]) and LPS, respectively, to initiate pro-IL-1beta processing in either WT or TRIF-deficient peritoneal macrophages. To exclude a contribution of TRIF-induced changes in pro-IL-1beta expression caused by the ability of TRIF to also activate NF-kappaB, cells were stimulated with poly(I:C) and LPS in the presence of the translation inhibitor cycloheximide (CHX), and pro-IL-1beta expression was first induced by pretreating the cells with the synthetic bacterial lipoprotein (BLP) and TLR2 ligand Pam3Cys-SK4, which was previously shown to up-regulate pro-IL-1beta without inducing its processing (6). Under these conditions, poly(I:C) and LPS significantly induced pro-IL-1beta processing and secretion of mature IL-1beta by peritoneal macrophages, which was completely prevented in TRIF-deficient macrophages (Fig. 1 C). As expected, BLP did not trigger pro-IL-1beta processing. It should be mentioned that CHX not only prevented the up-regulation of pro-IL-1beta by LPS and poly(I:C), but also increased the constitutive and inducible processing of pro-IL-1beta (unpublished data). A similar effect of CHX has recently been described for pro-IL-1beta processing in response to muramyl dipeptide binding to NOD2 (7). This probably reflects the inhibitory effect of CHX on the expression of a negative regulator of pro-IL-1beta processing.

Besides binding to membrane-bound TLR3, poly(I:C) is also recognized by cytosolic MDA5, which triggers NF-kappaB and IRF activation (14). In addition, NALP3 (also known as Cryopyrin) is a cytosolic NLR that has been shown to play a critical role in the activation of caspase-1 in response to double-stranded RNA treatment of bone marrow-derived macrophages (8). To further demonstrate that the poly(I:C)-induced pro-IL-1beta processing that we observe is initiated by TLR3, we tested pro-IL-1beta processing in HEK293-TLR3 cells and BLP-primed peritoneal macrophages from WT and TLR3-deficient mice, respectively. Poly(I:C) clearly stimulated pro-IL-1beta processing in HEK293-TLR3 cells (Fig. 2 A) and WT macrophages, but not in TLR3-deficient macrophages (Fig. 2 B). Moreover, pro-IL-1beta processing after poly(I:C) treatment of BLP-primed macrophages was unaffected by MDA5 and NALP3 small interfering RNA (siRNA; Fig. 2 C, top). Knockdown was verified via quantitative PCR (qPCR) of NALP3 and MDA5 mRNA (Fig. 2 C, middle and bottom right). Decreased pro-IL-1beta processing in response to LPS plus ATP, which is known to require NALP3 (9, 10), was used as a positive control for the effect of NALP3 siRNA (Fig. 2 C, middle left). Similarly, decreased IRF-7 mRNA induction upon intracellular delivery of poly(I:C), which is known to initiate MDA5 signaling to type I IFN production, leading to IRF-7 expression (14), was used as a positive control for the effect of MDA5 siRNA (Fig. 2 C, bottom left). Collectively, these data demonstrate that the stimulatory effect of extracellular poly(I:C) on pro-IL-1beta processing is mediated by TLR3 and its adaptor TRIF.

NLR-mediated activation of caspase-1 is believed to be responsible for pro-IL-1beta processing in response to multiple stimuli (2, 4-10). To study the role of caspase-1 in the TLR-initiated pro-IL-1beta processing observed in this study, we compared the potential of poly(I:C) and LPS to stimulate pro-IL-1beta processing in BLP-primed peritoneal macrophages from WT and caspase-1-deficient mice. As a positive control, peritoneal macrophages were stimulated with LPS plus ATP, which induces caspase-1-mediated pro-IL-1beta processing by activating the NLR NALP3 (9, 10). Interestingly, poly(I:C)- or LPS-induced pro-IL-1beta processing were only slightly reduced in caspase-1-deficient macrophages compared with WT macrophages (Fig. 3 A, left), whereas LPS plus ATP-induced pro-IL-1beta processing was completely abolished in the absence of caspase-1 (Fig. 3 A, right). These data indicate that TLR3 and TLR4 can trigger pro-IL-1beta processing independent of caspase-1. This was further confirmed by the fact that treatment of peritoneal macrophages or pro-IL-1beta transfected HEK293-TLR3 cells with the caspase-1 inhibitor Ac-WEHD-cho fails to completely inhibit poly(I:C)-induced pro-IL-1beta processing (Fig. 3, B and C). Remarkably, the pan-caspase inhibitor z-VAD-fmk significantly inhibited pro-IL-1beta processing, whereas the caspase-3 and -7 inhibitor z-DEVD-cmk had no effect. In addition, overexpression of CrmA, which is a potent inhibitor of caspase-1, -4, -5, and -8 (15), diminished poly(I:C)-induced pro-IL-1beta processing in HEK293-TLR3 cells (Fig. 3 C).

It should be noted that several proteases other than caspase-1 were previously shown to proteolytically activate pro-IL-1beta under certain conditions (16). However, none of these belong to the caspase family. Our observation that poly(I:C)-induced pro-IL-1beta processing can be inhibited by z-VAD-fmk and CrmA pointed to a role for caspase-8. This was further suggested by the fact that overexpression in HEK293T cells of WT caspase-8, but not its catalytically inactive mutant, induced pro-IL-1beta processing and secretion of biological active IL-1beta (Fig. 4 A). Similar results were obtained upon overexpression of caspase-1 (unpublished data). Consistent with the aforementioned inhibitory effect of z-VAD-fmk and CrmA, also more specific inhibition of caspase-8 with z-IETD-fmk or the viral caspase-8 inhibitor vFLIP prevented TLR3-induced pro-IL-1beta processing (Fig. 4 B). Similarly, siRNA-mediated knockdown of caspase-8 completely prevented poly(I:C)-induced processing in HEK293-TLR3 cells (Fig. 4 C), as well as poly(I:C)- and LPS-induced pro-IL-1beta processing in RAW264.7 murine macrophages (Fig. 4 D). Altogether, these experiments demonstrate a crucial role for caspase-8 in the production of mature IL-1beta in response to TLR3 and TLR4 stimulation. To analyze whether caspase-8 can directly cleave pro-IL-1beta into its mature form, we compared the ability of recombinant caspase-1 and -8 to process pro-IL-1beta in vitro. Both caspases were able to process pro-IL-1beta into an intermediate and mature form (Fig. 5 A). In contrast, caspase-3 only generated the intermediate form (Fig. 5 B, left). Caspase-1 produces mature IL-1beta by cleaving pro-IL-1beta after Asp117 (17). Interestingly, mutation of Asp117 also prevented the in vitro generation of mature IL-1beta by caspase-8, whereas mutation of two other potential cleavage sites that are conserved in mouse and human pro-IL-1beta (Asp105 and Asp108) had no effect (Fig. 5 B). These results demonstrate that caspase-8 and -1 cleave pro-IL-1beta at the same site.

Poly(I:C)- and LPS-induced pro-IL-1beta processing is caspase-8 dependent. (A) HEK293T cells were cotransfected with pro-IL-1beta and either WT caspase-8 or caspase-8 C362A. 24 h later, processing of pro-IL-1beta was analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting of total cell lysates (bottom). Secretion of biologically active IL-1beta into the corresponding cell supernatants was analyzed via IL-1 bioassay (top). Expression of caspase-8 was verified by Western blotting. (B) Pro-IL-1beta-transfected HEK293-TLR3 cells were incubated for 6 h with 25 mug/ml poly(I:C). 1 h before incubation, cells received 50 muM z-VAD-fmk, 50 muM z-IETD-fmk, or 0.05% DMSO (solvent control). Where indicated, cells were cotransfected with pCAGGS-CrmA-E (100 ng) or pCR3.1-Flag-vFLIP (50-100-200 ng). Pro-IL-1beta processing and secretion of biologically active IL-1beta was analyzed as described in A. (C) HEK293-TLR3 cells were transfected with either control nontargeting (N-i) or caspase-8 siRNA (C8-i). 72 h later, cells were treated for 6 h with 25 mug/ml poly(I:C) and analyzed for pro-IL-1beta processing and secretion of biologically active IL-1beta, as described in A. Knockdown of caspase-8 was verified by Western blotting. (D) RAW264.7 macrophages were transduced with either control nontargeting shRNA (Ctrl-sh) or caspase-8 shRNA (Casp-8-sh). 72 h later, cells were primed with BLP and subsequently incubated with poly(I:C), LPS, BLP, or control medium as described in the Materials and methods. Pro-IL-1beta processing was analyzed by Western blotting of total cell lysates (TL) and IL-1beta immunoprecipitates (IP) from the corresponding cell supernatant. Knockdown of caspase-8 was verified by Western blotting. Data are representative of two (C and D) or three (A and B) independent experiments.

In conclusion, the data described in this study demonstrate that TLR3 and TLR4 stimulation induces a TRIF-dependent signaling pathway that leads to the caspase-1-independent maturation of pro-IL-1beta. More specifically, we provide evidence that caspase-8 mediates pro-IL-1beta processing in response to TLR3 and TLR4 stimulation. Caspase-8 has been best characterized as a cysteine protease that cleaves specific substrates to transmit apoptotic signals downstream of death receptors. Additionally, roles for caspase-8 in mediating T, B and NK cell proliferation, macrophage differentiation, NF-kappaB activation, maintaining lymphocytes homeostasis, and suppressing immunodeficiency have become evident (3, 18). Full caspase-8 knockout mice are embryonic lethal, but tissue-specific inactivation has also revealed the key role of caspase-8 in innate and adaptive immunity (3, 18). The role described for caspase-8 in pro-IL-1beta processing in macrophages further supports its immunoregulatory function. Because conditional deletion of caspase-8 in myeloid cells results in defective macrophage differentiation (18), we were unable to study pro-IL-1beta processing in caspase-8 knockout macrophages. However, siRNA-mediated knockdown of caspase-8 completely prevented TLR3- and TLR4-induced pro-IL-1beta processing in HEK293T cells, as well as in macrophages.

In contrast to our data that show a role for TRIF and caspase-8 in TLR3- and TLR4-induced pro-IL-1beta processing, it has previously been reported by others that LPS and poly(I:C) can initiate caspase-1-mediated pro-IL-1beta processing independent of TLRs or TLR-associated adaptor molecules (5, 19), but involving the NALP3 inflammasome (5, 8-10). It should be noted, however, that in the aforementioned reports, LPS- or poly(I:C)-induced caspase-1 activation required an additional pulse with ATP, which triggers a P2X7- and pannexin-1-mediated potassium efflux and cytosolic delivery of bacterial products to intracellular NALP3 (5). In fact, the essential role of NALP3 and caspase-1 in LPS-plus-ATP-induced pro-IL-1beta processing was also confirmed in this study (Fig. 2 C and Fig. 3 A). In this context, it is worth mentioning that one of the original studies describing the caspase-1 knockout mice already reported that trace levels of mature IL-1beta can be found in the supernatant of caspase-1-deficient macrophages stimulated for 30 min with LPS plus ATP, and further cultured for 3 h in the absence of ATP (20). Collectively, these data illustrate that differences in experimental conditions (e.g., costimulation with ATP or intracellular delivery of microbial products) might determine the signaling pathway that is used to induce pro-IL-1beta processing.

Interestingly, caspase-1-independent pro-IL-1beta processing has also been reported in turpentine- and zymosan-treated mice and macrophages (21), as well as in Fas-stimulated neutrophils (22). Consistent with the latter data, we were also able to show caspase-8 activation and pro-IL-1beta processing in response to Fas overexpression in HEK293T cells (unpublished data). Because Fas-induced pro-IL-1beta processing was previously reported to be sensitive to the pan-caspase inhibitor z-VAD.fmk, we speculate that caspase-8 is also involved in Fas-induced pro-IL-1beta processing.

Consistent with the essential role of TRIF in TLR3- and TLR4-induced pro-IL-1beta processing, we did not observe pro-IL-1beta processing in response to TLR2, which does not signal via TRIF. Similarly, in contrast to TLR3 and TLR4, TLR2 stimulation did not induce caspase-8 processing, which is representative for caspase-8 activation (unpublished data). It is worth mentioning that caspase-8 has already been implicated in TLR3- and TLR4-induced signaling as part of a TRIF-RIP1-Fas-associated Death Domain-containing protein-caspase-8 complex leading to apoptosis (23, 24). In this context, we noticed that poly(I:C) and LPS also induced macrophage cell death upon longer incubation, especially when the synthesis of antiapoptotic proteins was inhibited by CHX (unpublished data). Although a detailed study of the underlying signaling mechanisms leading to caspase-8-mediated pro-IL-1beta processing in response to TLR3 or TLR4 stimulation is beyond the scope of this study, it can be expected that a similar TRIF-RIP1-Fas-associated Death Domain-containing protein-caspase-8 pathway leads to pro-IL-1beta processing. This is also supported by the specific coimmunoprecipitation of caspase-8 and its activated processing product with WT TRIF, but not with a RIP1 binding-deficient RHIM mutant of TRIF, from HEK293T cells (unpublished data). Collectively, these data implicate an important function for caspase-8 at the crossroads of proinflammatory and proapoptotic signaling. Classically, apoptosis is defined as a type of cell death that does not induce inflammation (25). This is most probably true in most cases of apoptosis, in which dying cells do not express pro-IL-1beta or activated caspase-8. However, in pathological conditions associated with pro-IL-1beta up-regulation and caspase-8 activation, inflammatory responses could be enhanced by the caspase-8 mediated processing and release of IL-1beta from apoptotic macrophages. In view of the possible use of caspase-8 inhibitors as therapeutic agents, it will be important to identify those disease conditions in which caspase-8 is involved in the cleavage of pro-IL-1beta.
