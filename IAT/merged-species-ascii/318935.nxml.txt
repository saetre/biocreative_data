In this communication, we describe several features of the D. melanogaster gene which codes for ribosomal protein 49 (rp49). Nucleotide sequence analysis in conjunction with primer extension and S1 nuclease protection experiments show that the structure of the rp49 gene consists of a 102 bp 5' exon, a single 59 bp intron, and a 420 bp 3' exon, encoding a total of 132 amino acids. The rp49 gene shares many features with other abundantly expressed Drosophila genes, including codon preference, which are discussed.
