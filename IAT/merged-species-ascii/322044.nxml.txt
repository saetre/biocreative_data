Ribosomal protein S15 and polynucleotide phosphorylase of E. coli are encoded by two adjacent genes, rpsO and pnp, respectively. Analysis of in vivo transcripts from these two genes shows that they are within the same operon (S15 operon). By correlating the 5' and 3' ends of their in vivo transcripts with the DNA sequence, we have identified several features of the operon structure. These features include a promotor upstream from rpsO, an attenuator downstream from rpsO and an RNA processing site between these two genes.
