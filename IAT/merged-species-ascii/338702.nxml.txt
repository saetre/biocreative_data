Here we report the DNA structure of the left 1.5 kb of two newly isolated full length members of the rat L1 DNA family (L1Rn, long interspersed repeated DNA). In contrast to earlier isolated rat L1 members, both of these contain promoter-like regions that are most likely full length. In addition, the promoter-like region of both members has undergone a partial tandem duplication. A second internal region of the left end of one of the reported members is also tandemly duplicated. The propensity of the left end of rat L1 elements to undergo this form of genetic rearrangement, as well as other structural features revealed by the present work, is discussed in light of the fact that during evolution the otherwise conserved mammalian L1 DNA families have each acquired completely different promoter-like regions. In an accompanying paper [Nur, I., Pascale, E., and Furano, A. V. (1988) Nucleic Acids Res. 16, submitted], we report that one of the rat promoter-like regions can function as a promoter in rat cells when fused to the Escherichia coli chloramphenicol acyltransferase gene.
