A combination of point mutations disrupting both stem 1 and stem 2 of U5 snRNA (U5AI) was found to confer a thermosensitive phenotype in vivo. In a strain expressing U5AI, pre-mRNA splicing was blocked before the first step through an inability of the mutant U5 snRNA to efficiently associate with the U4/U6 di-snRNP. Formation of early splicing complexes was not affected in extracts prepared from U5 snRNA mutant cells, while the capacity of these extracts to splice a pre-mRNA in vitro was greatly diminished. In addition, significant levels of a translation product derived from intron containing pre-mRNAs could be detected in vivo. The SSD1/SRK1 gene was identified as a multi-copy suppressor of the U5AI snRNA mutant. Single copy expression of SSD1/SRK1 was sufficient to suppress the thermosensitive phenotype, and high copy expression partially suppressed the splicing and U4/U6.U5 tri-snRNP assembly pheno-types. SSD1/SRK1 also suppressed thermosensitive mutations in the Prp18p and U1-70K proteins, while inhibiting growth of the cold sensitive U1-4U snRNA mutant at 30 degrees C. Thus we have identified SSD1/SRK1 as a general suppressor of splicing mutants.
