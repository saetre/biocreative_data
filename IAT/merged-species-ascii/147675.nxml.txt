The transcript levels of DNA replication genes and some recombination genes in Saccharomyces cerevisiae fluctuate and peak at the G1/S boundary in the mitotic cell cycle. This fluctuation is regulated by MCB (Mlu I cell cycle box) elements which are bound by the DSC1/MBF1 complex consisting of Swi6 and Mbp1. It is also known that some of the MCB-regulated genes are induced by treatment with DNA damaging agents and in meiosis. In this report, the function of SWI6 in meiosis was investigated. Delta swi6 cells underwent sporulation as did wild-type cells. However, the deletion mutant cells showed reduced spore viability and lower frequency of recombination. The transcript levels of the recombination genes RAD51 and RAD54 , which have MCB elements, were reduced in Delta swi6 cells. The transcript levels of SWI6 itself were also induced and declined in meiosis. Furthermore, an increased dosage of SWI6 enhanced the transcript level of the RAD51 gene and also the recombination frequency in meiosis. These results suggest that SWI6 enhances the expression level of the recombination genes in meiosis in a dosage-dependent manner, which results in an effect on the frequency of meiotic recombination.
