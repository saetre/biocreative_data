Bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) are critical growth factors in the osteogenic differentiation of progenitor cells during development in embryos and fracture repair in adults. Although recombinant BMPs are in use clinically, their clinical efficiency needs to be improved. The biological activities of BMPs are naturally regulated by extracellular binding proteins. The specific hypotheses tested in this study were as follows: the BMP inhibitor chordin is produced endogenously during the osteogenic differentiation of human mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs); and blockade of the activity of the BMP inhibitor increases the rate of osteogenic differentiation of human MSCs in vitro.

Human MSCs were derived from bone marrow from an iliac crest aspirate and from patients undergoing hip hemiarthroplasty. The MSCs were induced down the osteogenic pathway using standard osteogenic differentiation media, and expressions of BMP-2 and chordin were determined by gene expression analysis. During osteogenic differentiation, chordin knockdown was induced using RNA interference. Osteogenic differentiation was assessed by measuring the expression of alkaline phosphatase and calcium deposition. The differences in expression of osteogenic makers between groups were compared by analysis of variance, followed by Gabriel post hoc test.

We demonstrate the expression of BMP-2 and chordin in human MSCs during osteogenic differentiation. Knockdown of chordin by RNA interference in vitro resulted in a significant increase in the expression of the osteogenic marker alkaline phosphatase and the deposition of extracellular mineral, in response to osteogenic stimulation.

Bone regeneration is regulated by a number of growth factors, among which the bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) have received considerable attention because of their clinical applications. BMPs exert a wide range of effects on cells and tissues that are involved in the repair process, including recruitment of mesenchymal stem cell (MSCs) from surrounding tissues to the fracture site, their proliferation and differentiation into osteoblasts and chondrocytes, and invasion of blood vessels.

Cellular responses to BMPs are initiated by their binding to transmembrane receptors, whose cytoplasmic domains become phosphorylated at specific serine and threonine residues, thereby triggering Smad intracellular signalling pathways [1]. The biological activities of BMPs can be modulated extracellularly by several binding proteins, including noggin, gremlin, follistatin and chordin. The latter is a BMP antagonist that was initially characterised in the Spemann organizer. It is a 120 kDa protein, containing four cysteine-rich domains of about 79 amino acids each [2-4], which bind to BMP-2 and BMP-4, thereby preventing their interaction with BMP receptors [2].

Endogenous BMP production is an essential component of normal membranous ossification [5] and the early stages of fracture healing [6]. Using a well characterized in vitro model, it was shown that BMP-2 is expressed endogenously by bone marrow cells, with a level of expression that is dependent on the degree of cellular osteogenic differentiation [7-9]. Moreover, antagonism of endogenous BMP signalling reduces the osteogenic differentiation of a murine preosteoblastic cell line [10].

The exogenous addition of individual BMPs can stimulate osteogenic differentiation of MSCs [8,11,12] and promote fracture healing in animal models [13-15]. Recombinant human BMP-2 and BMP-7 are used clinically in spinal fusion and the healing of tibial fractures. To obtain a clinically acceptable result, these proteins are used at wildly supraphysiological, highly expensive concentrations, and there is a pressing need to improve their efficiency. In this paper, we identify chordin as an important endogenous inhibitor of the osteogenic differentiation of human MSCs that could be targeted to improve fracture repair.

Human MSCs were obtained from two sources, the first one being a commercially available bone marrow aspirate from a 19-year-old male donor (Clonetics-Poietics, Walkersville, MD, USA). This was plated at 10 mul aspirate/cm2 on a 150 cm2 tissue culture plate (Costar, Cambridge, MA, USA) and cultivated until confluency in 25 ml of basal medium (BM), Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) containing 1,000 mg/l glucose (Invitrogen Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA, USA), supplemented with 10% foetal bovine serum (FBS; Stem Cell Technologies, Vancouver, Canada), which had been commercially screened from carefully selected lots, and 1% antibiotic-antimycotic (Invitrogen). MSCs were selected from the marrow aspirate on the basis of their ability to adhere to tissue culture plastic. Nonadherent, haematopoietic cells were removed during the first medium replacement after 3 days in culture. Primary culture human MSCs were subsequently detached using 0.25% trypsin/1 mmol/l EDTA (Invitrogen), replated at 1,000 cells/cm2, and cultured until confluency to generate first passage MSCs. These were frozen in Recovery Cell Culture Freezing Medium (Invitrogen), stored in liquid nitrogen, and further expanded for osteogenic differentiation studies at the appropriate time.

The second source of human MSCs was an Institutional Review Board approved aspiration of the medullary cavities of femora of four patients undergoing hip hemiarthroplasty, as described previously [16]. There were three female patients aged 71, 76 and 78 years, and a male aged 77 years. Briefly, the marrow cells were layered on Ficoll (Sigma-Aldrich) and centrifuged for 30 minutes at 400 g. The mononuclear cells collected from the Ficoll-supernatant interface were cultured in BM at a density of 5 x 107 per 75 cm2 flasks (Becton Dickinson, Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA). After 2 weeks in primary culture, cells were passaged at seeding densities between 100 and 1,000 cells/cm2, trypsinised and stored in Recovery Cell Culture Freezing Medium in liquid nitrogen.

Before osteogenic differentiation, 6,000 cells/cm2 of human MSCs were seeded in BM in each well of 24-well plates (Becton Dickinson Labware, Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA). Each experimental condition was repeated in quadruplicate. On day 1 of culture, approximately 24 hours after cells were seeded, BM was removed and immediately replaced with an appropriate volume of osteogenic differentiation medium (OM) consisting of DMEM with 4,500 mg/l glucose (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% FBS (Stem Cell Technologies), 1% antibiotics, and the osteogenic stimulants 100 nmol/l dexamethasone, 50 mug/ml ascorbate phosphate and 3 mmol/l beta-glycerophosphate. First to third passage cells were used for osteogenic differentiation studies. Media of all cultures was changed every 3 days.

Osteogenic differentiation of human MSCs was evaluated after 10 and 21 days in BM or OM. Medium was aspirated directly from the wells. Cultures were quantitatively compared on the basis of the expression of alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity and incorporation of calcium in the extracellular matrix. The deposition of a mineralized matrix was further examined by staining with Alizarin Red.

ALP activity was determined by measuring the conversion of p-nitrophenyl phosphate to p-nitrophenol. The substrate solution was prepared by dissolving 4-nitrophenyl phosphate disodium salt hexahydrate into a substrate buffer consisting of 50 mmol/l glycine and 1 mmol/l MgCl2 at a pH of 10.5. Cultures were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and 250 mul of the substrate solution was added to each well. Following a 15-minute incubation, the resulting solution was transferred to tubes containing the same volume of 1 mol/l NaOH. The cells were immediately washed with PBS twice and solubilized with a cell lysis buffer for protein assay. The cell lysis buffer consisted of 50 mmol/l Tris, 150 mmol/l NaCl and 0.2% Triton X-100 (Fisher Biotech, Fairland, NJ, USA; pH 7.2).

The quantity of p-nitrophenol liberated from the substrate was determined by comparison to a standard curve. The absorbance was read at 405 nm on a UVmax Kinetic Microplate Reader (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA, USA). Readings were obtained within the linear range of the standard curve. ALP activity was normalized to the number of cells (as determined by the WST-1 assay described below) and expressed as nitrophenol product/minute/absorbance.

Mineral was then collected after dissolution with 300 mul of 0.6 mol/l hydrocholoric acid at room temperature overnight and the samples assayed the following day. Incorporation of calcium in the extracellular matrix was quantified using the commercial diagnostic kit QuantiChrom Calcium Assay Kit (DICA-500; Bio Assay Systems, Hayward, CA, USA), in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions. Absorbances were compared with curves prepared using standard solutions of calcium. Calcium deposition was expressed as mumoles per tissue culture well (mumol/well).

RT-PCR was performed to evaluate the expression of BMP-2 and chordin, using the housekeeping gene GAPDH (glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase) as an internal control. cDNA was generated using the High Capacity cDNA reverse transcription Kit (Applied Biosystems, Warrington, UK). PCR was performed using the Invitrogen Platinum Taq (Invitrogen) method, in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions. The PCR primers were designed on the basis of the published human gene sequences (Table 1; Invitrogen). PCR amplication was performed using an MJ Research PTC-2000 Peltier thermal cycler (GMI, Ramsey, MN, USA) in the following sequence: denaturation at 94degreesC for 90 seconds followed by a specific number cycles of denaturation (Table 1) at 94degreesC for 30 seconds, annealing at the temperature shown below for each specific primer for 30 seconds, and extension at 72degreesC for 6 seconds followed by a last extension at 72degreesC for 10 minutes (Table 1). A 20 mul aliquot of the PCR product was added to 10 mul loading buffer (consisting of 50% glycerol, 0.2 mol/l EDTA [pH 8.0] and 0.05% bromophenol blue), and the resulting solution electrophoresed on 2% agarose gel stained with GelRed nucleic acid stain (Cambridge Biosciences, Cambridge, UK). As well as the tested samples, a 100 base pair DNA ladder (Hyperladder IV; Bioline, London, UK), a positive control prepared from the reverse transcription of human total RNA (Promega UK, Southampton, UK) and a negative control of molecular biology grade water were also included on each gel. Photographs of the gel were taken under ultraviolet light with a Syngene high-resolution camera (Synoptics, Cambridge, UK) and images acquired and stored with a Genesnap software (Syngene, Cambridge, UK).

MSCs were cultured in BM or OM for 20 days. The usual change in phenotype of MSCs from spindle-shaped cells (when cultured in BM) to more cuboidal-shaped cells (when cultured in OM) was noted. The osteogenic phenotype of MSCs was confirmed by the increase in ALP activity at day 10 (Figure 1) and positive Alizarin Red staining at day 21 for cells cultured in OM, but not BM (Figure 1). These data confirm the ability of human MSCs to undergo osteogenesis in response to OM.

BMP-2 expression was weakly detectable in MSCs exposed to 5 and 10 days of BM (Figure 2a). Osteogenic differentiation induced an increase in the expression of BMP-2 (Figure 2a). Chordin mRNA expression was not detectable by RT-PCR when the MSCs were cultured in BM. However, there was detectable expression of chordin transcripts in MSCs cultured in OM, with an apparent increased expression at day 10 compared with day 5 (Figure 2a).

Expression of BMP-2 and chordin transcripts during osteogenic differentiation of human mesenchymal stem cells. (a) Temporal progression of bone morphogenetic protein (BMP)-2 and chordin expression during osteogenic differentiation of human MSCs over a 10-day period. Human MSCs were cultured in basal media (BM) or osteogenic media (OM) for 5 or 10 days. (b) Effect of small interfering RNA (siRNA) on chordin expression. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) were transfected with either control or chordin siRNA and then grown in OM for the 3 or 10 days. RNA was extracted and reverse transcribed, and PCR amplification of chordin, BMP-2 and GAPDH (glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase) sequences was performed.

To assess the effect of chordin knockdown on osteogenic differentiation, we first determined whether we could transfect siRNA into human MSCs, by using BLOCK-iT Oligo fluorescent siRNA and detecting its presence using a Cytomics FC500 MPL flow cytometer. As measured by fluorescence-labelled siRNA using a flow cytometer, transfection with 100, 200 and 300 nmol/l oligomucleotides respectively resulted in 51%, 91% and 99% efficiencies of transfection (Figure 3). Based on these data, the dose of 300 nmol/l siRNA was used in further experiments to screen the designed candidate siRNAs.

Subsequently, the cells were transfected with chordin-specific siRNA and were cultured for 3 days (for mRNA analysis), 10 days (for mRNA analysis and ALP assay), and 21 days (for calcium deposition assay). After 3 and 10 days of culture, total RNAs were extracted from the human MSCs. RT-PCR analysis showed that the human MSCs transfected with chordin siRNA had undetectable chordin gene expression, whereas the control siRNA cells exhibited detectable chordin mRNA expression (Figure 2b).

There were no significant calcium deposits in cells cultured with BM (Figure 1). There was no difference in morphology between the control siRNA and chordin siRNA treated cells. Human MSC proliferation in the presence of Lipofectamine control, control siRNA and chordin siRNA was monitored for 7 days (as described in Materials and methods [above]). The relative number of cells was determined spectrophotometrically using WST-1 assay at 3, 5 and 7 days of culture. After 5 and 7 days, cells treated with chordin siRNA had decreased proliferation, as compared with untreated cells, and cells treated with transfection reagent only or control siRNA (P < 0.005; Figure 4).

We next examined the functional consequences of chordin knockdown on the osteogenic differentiation of human MSCs cultured in OM. MSCs were cultured for 10 or 21 days in OM following transfection of chordin-specific siRNA. Treatment with chordin siRNA, but not the control siRNA, resulted in an approximately threefold increase of ALP expression relative to untreated controls (Figure 5a). We also found that chordin siRNA (but not control siRNA) treatment of human MSCs cultured for 21 days in OM increased calcium mineral deposition by approximately twofold, relative to untreated controls (Figure 5b). Consistent with this result, chordin siRNA treated cells stained more intensely with Alizarin Red than those treated with control siRNA (Figure 5c).

In this study, expression of BMP-2 and chordin during the in vitro osteogenic differentiation of human MSCs was confirmed. BMP-2 transcripts were expressed constitutively by MSCs cultured in BM. Induction of osteogenic differentiation was associated with an increase in the expression of BMP-2. Chordin mRNA expression was not detectable by conventional PCR, when the MSCs were exposed to BM. However, chordin expression was detectable when the cells were induced down the osteogenic pathway, with apparently increased expression at day 10 compared with day 5. These findings confirm data from previous studies, in which the expression of BMP-2 and chordin increased with the osteogenic differentiation of MSCs in this culture model system [8,19]. Einhorn and colleagues [8] also demonstrated that the blockade of endogenously produced BMP-2 activity with a specific antibody reduced the osteogenic differentiation of murine MSCs by 80%.

In the present study, it was further demonstrated that chordin knockdown accelerates early osteogenesis and leads to increased deposition of mineral at late time points. The suppression of chordin led to an increase in the bioavailability of endogenously produced BMP-2 to drive the differentiation of osteoprogenitors. These findings are consistent with earlier literature suggesting that BMP antagonists of this type regulate osteoblast differentiation and adult bone formation 5,20,21]. The exogenous application of chordin also limits in vitro osteogenesis [19]. Overall, these findings confirm that BMP-2 is important in driving and sustaining osteogenic differentiation in this in vitro model. This effect of BMP-2 is blunted by the known BMP inhibitor, chordin, which is concurrently expressed during the osteogenic differentiation of the progenitor cells.

To date, biological methods of enhancing bone regeneration in clinical use have centred around the promotion of osteoinduction via the delivery of BMPs. However, targeting BMP inhibitors, such as chordin, may provide a novel means of improving fracture repair and fulfilling other relevant osteogenic needs.

Noggin is another extracellular BMP inhibitor, and has a mode of action similar to that of chordin. The expression of the noggin gene is essential for proper skeletal development [22]. Transgenic mice over-expressing noggin in the bone microenvironment have decreased trabecular bone volume and impaired osteoblastic function, leading to osteopenia and fractures [20]. Noggin endogenous expression has been demonstrated in animal models of fracture repair [23,24]. It was recently reported that the suppression of noggin enhances osteogenesis in murine cell lines and accelerates in vivo bone formation in an intra-membranous animal model [25]. Whether noggin is effective in human cells undergoing osteogenic differentiation remains to be determined.

###begin p 68
###xml 302 307 <span type="species:ncbi:9606">human</span>
In addition to noggin and chordin, it is possible that a similar enhancement of osteogenesis could be achieved through reduced expression of other BMP antagonists. Our preliminary results (data not shown) suggest that follistatin and gremlin are also expressed during the osteogenic differentiation of human MSCs. It remains uncertain which BMP inhibitor or combination of inhibitors would produce the greatest effect.

As well as promoting osteogenesis, suppression of chordin decreased cellular proliferation by 35%. This decrease in cellular proliferation may be a result of an increase in the differentiation of the MSCs, because there exists an inverse relationship between proliferation and differentiation of osteoprogenitor cells during bone formation [26]. Chordin suppression also leads to an increase in the bioavailability of BMP-2 and it was previously reported that BMP-2 decreases the proliferation of human MSCs in osteogenic medium [11,27,28]. BMP-2 also induces an increase in the extracellular matrix of osteoblastic cells in vitro and thereby contributes to a decrease in their proliferation [27].

This study is limited by the relatively small number (five) of cell donors on which the hypothesis was tested. However, we believe that the findings in the study can be extrapolated to cells from a large population of donors because there is consistently a significant and large increase in expression of osteogenic markers, as a result of chordin knockdown in cells from all donors tested. Another factor to consider is whether the age of the donors had an influence on the results of this study. Four donors were over 70 years old and one donor was aged 19. The relative increase in expression of the osteogenic markers in the young donor, as a result of chordin knockdown, was within the range of that of the donors over 70 years old. MSCs from young donors are commercially available, but they are expensive. On the other hand, cells derived from older donors were obtained by collecting bone marrow, which would have been discarded, at hip surgery. It is unlikely that there would be any difference in the response of MSCs from donors of different age groups. The capacity of human MSCs to differentiate into osteoblasts and adipocytes is maintained irrespective of donor age [29]. Prior studies suggest that there are no intrinsic defects in human MSCs with ageing and that extrinsic factors present in the ageing environment of MSC may be responsible for the impaired osteoblast functions observed with ageing. Hormonal differences with ageing may be a factor as sera obtained from aged donors are less potent inducers of osteoblast differentiation of human MSC, as compared with sera obtained from young donors [30].

Clinical application of these findings will require targeting chordin or other such BMP antagonists in vivo. This may be achieved with local injection of siRNA at the site of skeletal injury, an approach that is yet to be validated in animal models. Alternative approaches include the use of neutralizing antibodies, gene transfer and the design of small molecule antagonists.
