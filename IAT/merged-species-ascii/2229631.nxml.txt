Results
###end title 6
###begin p 7
There were more acanthosis and fewer nerve fibres in epidermis and papillary dermis of involved compared with non-involved skin. Whereas there was no significant change in the number of substance P and calcitonin gene-related peptide-positive nerve fibres between the involved and non-involved skin, there was an increase in the epidermal fraction of 5-hydroxtrytamine 1A (5-HT1A) receptor and serotonin transporter protein (SERT) immunoreactivity in the involved skin. The number of 5-HT2AR, CD3-positive cells, and SERT-positive cells, most of them being CD3 positive, was increased in involved skin. There was an increase in mast cells in the involved skin, and these cells were often located close to the basement membrane. There was a strong tendency to a correlation between 5-HT2AR positive cells in the papillary dermis of involved skin and low cortisol ratios, being an indicator of chronic stress.

Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a common chronic skin disease, which affects about 2% to 3% of the adult population.1 It produces an extremely itchy skin. A marked increase in the prevalence of AD in urbanized societies has occurred during the past decades.2

The skin controls and transmits contacts with the external world. It is an integral component of the immune, nervous, and endocrine systems, and there are numerous lines of crosstalk between these systems established intracutaneously.5 The skin contains an extensive neural network represented by unmyelinated sensory fibres and receptors for neuropeptides and neurotransmitters identical to those expressed in the central neuroendocrine system.6

The free nerve endings of the sensory nerves, C-fibres, are widely distributed in the epidermis, and most of them reach the stratum granulosum. Activation of sensory unmyelinated neurones evokes the release of neuropeptides, such as substance P.

Serotonin [5-hydroxtrytamine (5-HT)] is an amine that acts as a neurotransmitter in a wide variety of sites in the central and peripheral nervous system.13 It is involved in numerous body functions. Functional dysregulation may lead to sleep disorders, anxiety, depression, and aggressivity. Serotonin is also of importance for basic cell functions such as proliferation, differentiation, maturation, and migration. Serotonin is present in serotonergic neurones in the central nervous system, and in the periphery, it is released from platelets and mast cells (in rodents) after tissue injury.

Pathways for the biosynthesis and biodegradation of serotonin have been characterized in human and rodent skin and in their major cellular populations.13 Serotonin in the skin causes pro-oedema, vasodilatory, proinflammatory, and pruritogenic effects via its receptors.14

Serotonin generally exerts its effects through seven families of receptors.15 Of these subtypes, the 5HT1A and 5HT2A receptors have been suggested to have opposing functions in a variety of cellular and behavioural processes.16 The serotonin transporter protein (SERT) regulates 5-HT concentrations in the synaptic cleft via recycling released serotonin, thus terminating the action of 5-HT, and is a target for serotonin reuptake inhibitors.

Psychological stress can provoke many cutaneous dermatoses associated with abnormal epidermal barrier function, such as AD.17 Stress involves different neuromediators, such as sensory neuropeptides, including the substance P-NK-1 receptor system, 11 and the serotonergic system, in, for example, raphe.18 There is a colocalization of serotonin and sensory neuropeptides in the nervous system.19

Salivary cortisol samples were obtained from all patients. The salivary samples were collected in plastic vials at 08:00 h on three consecutive days. At 10:00 h p.m. on the last day, 0.25 mg dexamethasone was administered orally, followed by a new cortisol test on the following morning. The samples were stored at -20 degreesC until analysis. The cortisol concentrations were determined using a radioimmunoassay kit (Spectria Cortisol, Orion Diagnostica, Espoo, Finland) after centrifugation of the samples. The ratio of the mean of the previous three values to the last cortisol value was determined, a low ratio being an indicator of chronic stress.20

These sites had not been treated with topical steroids for at least 14 days. The biopsies were fixed in Lanas fix (10% formalin and 0.4% picric acid) at 4 degreesC for 2 h. They were then rinsed in cold phosphate buffer with 10% sucrose (4 degreesC) for at least 48 h, snap frozen, and stored at -70 degreesC until being further processed.

It has earlier been reported that the density of cutaneous nerves is higher in atopic skin than in the skin of healthy controls.22, 23 The quality of nerve fibres are also changed in AD patients, the nerve endings being thin and running straight through the epidermis.24

In a previous study, 26 there was a decreased number of PGP 9.5-positive fibres and NGF receptor in the epidermis in patients with prurigo nodularis. Maybe the loss of fibres is due to mechanical damage, which might lead to collateral sprouting of other nerve fibres or regeneration of the damaged nerve fibres.

There was an increase in the ratio of 5-HT1AR and SERT fractions of the immunoreactive epidermis in involved compared to non-involved skin. This is interesting since there is a relation between 5-HT1AR and SERT, the function of SERT and influence on the 5-HT concentration being associated with a modulation of 5-HT1A autoreceptors.27

The creation of a skin barrier is linked to a decreased production of lamellar bodies, which in turn is attributed to a diminished de novo synthesis of epidermal lipids, including cholesterol.17 Cholesterol is an essential component of eucaryotic membranes. It is of special interest that the function of the 5-HT1AR is dependent on cholesterol (see ref. 30). In this respect, it may be mentioned that cholesterol can also be metabolized to steroid hormones in the skin.31 In addition, the 5-HT1A and 5-HT2A receptor functions have been reported to be dependent on steroids.32

Regarding the intrusion of 5-HT2AR-positive cells into the epidermis, this might be due to effect on interstitial collagenases, being mediated by the 5-HT2AR (see ref. 33). An antagonist to the 5-HT2A receptor has been shown to decrease the expression of matrix metalloproteinase.34

The mast cells in the present investigation could be seen to be increased in the involved compared to non-involved skin and as well to attach to the basement membrane. Mast cells are known to be able to activate matrix metalloproteinases via the production of tryptase.36 Tryptase itself and the activated matrix proteinases can degrade various components of the pericellular/extracellular matrix.
