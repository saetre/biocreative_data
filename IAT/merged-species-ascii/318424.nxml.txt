I factors in Drosophila melanogaster are transposable elements structurally related to Mammalian LINEs. Their transposition is activated at high frequencies during I-R hybrid dysgenesis and is associated with the production of mutations of various sorts. Very few of these mutations have been studied at the molecular level; those reported so far result either from chromosomal rearrangements or from insertions of complete I factors. We have analysed three I-R induced yellow mutations and have found that one of them is due to the insertion of an I element very similar to the complete I factor, whereas the other two are due to insertions of I elements that are truncated at their 5' ends; one of them exhibits an unusual 3' end. We discuss possible mechanisms of production of such modified I elements.
