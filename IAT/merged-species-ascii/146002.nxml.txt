SPSF I and II are two cellular proteins which bind specifically to single-stranded DNA. SPSF I and II binding sites are found in the minimal origin of replication of BPV-1 DNA and near the P2 promoter of the cellular c-myc gene. DNA-binding properties of the two proteins to single-stranded oligonucleotides of different lengths and sequences were quantified by determination of DNA-binding constants. The binding constant of SPSF proteins to the lower strand of the BPV-1 origin was determined to be 1.5 x 10(-10) M-1. Peptide sequences derived from purified SPSF I and II revealed the identity of at least one of the SPSF proteins with the so-called HeLa Pur alpha factor. The HeLa Pur alpha factor was identified previously by virtue of its capacity to bind to purine-rich strands of the PUR element found in initiation zones of DNA replication [Bergemann, A.D., Ma,Z.-W. and Johnson, E.M. (1992) Mol. Cell. Biol. 12, 5673-5682]. Expression of the Pur cDNA confirmed the identity of the Pur alpha protein with the 42 kDa SPSF I protein. Analysis of several Pur alpha cDNA clones revealed the existence of an extended 3'-untranslated region in all Pur mRNAs.
