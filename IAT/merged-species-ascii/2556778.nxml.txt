B cells activated by antigen in T cell-dependent immune responses can become short-lived plasma cells, which remain in the spleen, or germinal center-derived memory or plasma cells, which show evidence of affinity maturation and, in the case of plasma cells, migrate to the bone marrow. We show that this cell fate decision can be governed by the cytokine environment engendered by activated dendritic cells (DCs). DCs from mice lacking the Fc receptor gamma chain exhibited an activated phenotype in vitro. They secreted more of the proinflammatory cytokine IL-12, which led to the preferential generation of short-lived splenic plasma cells, with ensuing low affinity antibodies and a diminished recall response. Understanding the factors that regulate antigen-activated B cell differentiation and memory cell formation has implications for both antibody-mediated autoimmune disease and protective antibody responses.

B cells responding to antigen in a T cell-dependent response can be activated to become short-lived plasma cells with no memory capabilities, or germinal center cells, which mature to become either long-lived plasma cells or memory B cells. The nature of the antibody-producing cell influences the duration of the antibody response as well as the affinity and isotype of the antibody that is made, all of which constitute important parameters of protective immunity. The phenotype of the autoreactive B cell producing the autoantibody in patients with autoimmune disease may also influence both the pathogenicity of the autoantibody and the response to therapy. Antibody responses that include a memory cell compartment may be important in protective immunity, but as autoantibody responses they may be more difficult to eradicate. Thus, understanding the conditions that lead to the generation of either short-lived plasma cells or long-lived plasma cells and memory cells may be of considerable clinical importance.

We have previously described a model of antigen-induced autoimmunity in which we can examine the inductive phase of the autoreactive humoral response. BALB/c mice immunized with a peptide mimotope of double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) will develop antibodies that are cross-reactive with dsDNA and peptide. These antibodies deposit in renal glomeruli and cause proteinuria. Because there is minimal cellular infiltrate in the kidney, probably because of a lack of renal vulnerability to antibody-mediated disease in this strain, the model is one of nephrotic syndrome (1). The autoantibody response in these mice is T cell-dependent, with antigen-specific T cells producing Th1 cytokines on antigen challenge (2).

Our understanding of the immunological function of gamma chain-associated FcRs has been facilitated by studies from Takai et al. (3) on FcR-associated gamma chain-null mice (Fcgamma-/-). The Fcgamma-/- mice have a selective defect in the expression of FcRs on the cell surface as well as in the FcR-mediated signal cascade. Interestingly, disruption of the FcR gamma chain in NZB/NZW mice uncouples immune complex formation from the inflammatory response in the kidney, implying a pathogenic role of FcR gamma chain in autoimmune disease (4).

There are several factors involved in determining the phenotype of antigen-experienced B cells, including BCR signal strength (5), expression of transcription factors (6), and costimulatory influences (7-9). In the course of studying renal pathology in peptide-immunized mice deficient in the FcR gamma chain (Fcgamma-/-), we made the surprising observation that Fcgamma-/- mice preferentially develop short-lived plasma cells and fail to develop a germinal center response. We show that this altered B cell response is a consequence of increased IL-12 production by DCs.

Immunization of BALB/c mice with a peptide mimotope of dsDNA, DWEYSVWLSN, octamerized on a polylysine backbone (multiple antigenic peptide [MAP] peptide) induces antibodies that cross-react with peptide and dsDNA (1). We immunized Fcgamma-/- and WT mice i.p. with MAP peptide in CFA and boosted with antigen in IFA on days 7 and 14. By day 28, Fcgamma-/- mice generated significantly higher serum titers of both antipeptide (approximately fivefold) and anti-dsDNA antibody (approximately sevenfold; Fig. 1 a). The difference in serum antibody reactivity did not reflect a difference in the kinetics of the response, as both strains exhibited a similar timing of antibody production (Fig. 1 a). An antigen-specific IgM response was induced in WT and Fcgamma-/- mice. Consistent with the IgG response, there was a higher IgM response in Fcgamma-/- mice at week 2, but this declined to the basal level by week 4 in both strains (Fig. S1, available at ).

Fcgamma-/- mice display an increased production of antigen-specific antibodies in their serum and increased renal antibody deposition. (a) Fcgamma-/- (gray triangles) and WT (black squares) mice (n = 5 in each group) were immunized with 100 mug MAP peptide and boosted twice (arrows indicate time of boosts). Serum was collected on days 0, 14, 28, 42, and 56, and antipeptide and anti-dsDNA IgG ELISAs were performed. P </= 0.05 in both graphs. (b) Mice were immunized as described in a. 7-wk serum was assayed for isotype-specific antipeptide antibody ELISAs. Titrations were twofold and began at the dilution indicated on the x-axis. Gray triangles show Fcgamma-/- mice and black squares show WT mice. IgG1, P = 0.02; IgG2a, P = 0.048. n = 5. (c) Kidneys were taken at day 91, and sections were stained for IgG deposition. Sections shown above are representative of five mice in each group. Sections were magnified 100x. Bars, 50 mum. 50 glomeruli were counted in each kidney section, and the percent positive for IgG deposition was graphed. *, P </= 0.05. Proteinuria was determined by measuring the amount of protein in the urine of mice at day 91 after immunization. (d) Both WT and Fcgamma-/- mice were immunized with 100 mug MAP peptide in CFA on day 0 and boosted on day 7 with MAP peptide in IFA. On day 56, mice were challenged with 100 mug MAP peptide in IFA, and serum was collected 5 d after challenge. Antipeptide ELISAs were performed. P </= 0.05. (e) WT and Fcgamma-/- mice (five in each group) were immunized with 100 mug 10-2-BSA and boosted twice. Day-0, -14, -28, and -42 serum was assayed by ELISA for anti-10-2 IgG. P </= 0.05. Data are presented as mean +/- SD.

One explanation for the greater IgG serum reactivity in Fcgamma-/- mice would be an increased affinity of antipeptide antibodies. We, therefore, performed inhibition ELISAs with soluble peptide and calculated apparent affinities by determining the molar concentration of soluble antigen that led to 50% inhibition of the antibody reactivity (10). Contrary to our initial expectation, antipeptide antibodies from Fcgamma-/- mice had a log lower apparent affinity than antipeptide antibodies from WT mice (1.4 x 105 vs. 2.2 x 106; P </= 0.01), demonstrating that the increased titers resulted from the production of more antigen-specific antibody.

Furthermore, although IgG1 was the predominant isotype observed in both the antipeptide and anti-dsDNA response in WT mice, Fcgamma-/- mice produced both IgG1 and IgG2a antipeptide (Fig. 1 b) and anti-dsDNA antibodies (not depicted). This did not reflect an intrinsic bias toward increased IgG2a, as the isotype distribution for total serum IgG was similar in both mouse strains (not depicted).

Because the difference in antibody titer between strains was approximately5-10-fold, we believed it was important to ask whether this increase in serum antibody titer might be of pathological significance. Kidneys from MAP peptide-immunized Fcgamma-/- mice, analyzed 13 wk after the initial antigen challenge, had significantly more glomerular IgG deposition than WT kidneys, and the mice displayed increased proteinuria (Fig. 1 c). Thus, the antibodies from Fcgamma-/- mice, although of lower affinity than the antibodies in WT mice, were still of sufficient affinity to cause glomerular dysfunction. This observation is consistent with clinical experience where a four- to eightfold increase in autoantibody titer may correlate with the onset of disease or with increased disease activity. For example, an antinuclear antibody titer of 1:40 is normal, whereas an eightfold increase to 1:320 is highly significant for disease. Likewise, a four to eightfold increase in anti-DNA antibody titer in a patient with SLE will often precede a clinical flare (11).

High affinity antibody responses are generated by a germinal center reaction in which B cells undergo somatic hypermutation and there is selection for survival of B cells making the highest affinity antibodies. These cells mature to become long-lived plasma cells and memory cells. To determine if the lack of a high affinity antibody response reflected a failure of B cells to undergo germinal center maturation, we questioned whether Fcgamma-/- mice developed a memory response. WT and Fcgamma-/- mice were immunized and boosted with MAP peptide. 8 wk later, mice were challenged with 100 mug MAP peptide. 5 d later, blood was collected to measure the antipeptide response in serum. Fig. 1 d shows that WT mice have a rapid increase in the serum antipeptide response, which was not observed in Fcgamma-/- mice. These data suggest a significant reduction in the population of memory B cells in Fcgamma-/- mice.

To determine whether Fcgamma-/- mice immunized with a nonself antigen would also develop an enhanced serum response, we examined the response of Fcgamma-/- mice to 10-2, a peptide mimotope of phosphorylcholine, conjugated to BSA (12). As seen in Fig. 1 e, Fcgamma-/- mice made significantly more anti-10-2 antibodies (an approximately threefold increase in titer) than WT mice. In addition, although WT mice made predominantly IgG1 anti-10-2 antibodies, Fcgamma-/- mice also produced antigen-specific IgG2a antibodies (unpublished data). Thus, the strain-specific difference in antibody response was not limited to an autoreactive response.

The increased antipeptide and anti-DNA response in Fcgamma-/- mice might reflect either a B cell-intrinsic phenotype or, alternatively, a different response to immunization in non-B cells. To test whether the difference was B cell intrinsic, splenic B cells from WT or Fcgamma-/- mice were transferred to B cell-deficient BALB/c mice (muMT). Both WT B cell-reconstituted and Fcgamma-/- B cell-reconstituted muMT mice were immunized with MAP peptide. As shown in Fig. 2, there was no statistically significant difference in serum antipeptide response between WT and Fcgamma-/- B cell-reconstituted mice. Moreover, analysis of splenic B cell subsets (mature vs. immature and transitional vs. follicular vs. marginal zone) confirmed that there was no difference in B cell differentiation between Fcgamma-/- and WT BALB/c B cells. The expression of several cell surface markers (CD22, CD40, CD43, CD79b, CD27, MHC II, Fas, CD80, and CD86) also was not different between Fcgamma-/- and WT BALB/c B cells. B cell function, assayed by IgM-mediated apoptosis and B cell proliferation to anti-IgM plus anti-CD40 antibody or anti-CD40 antibody plus IL-4, was also similar between both strains (unpublished data). Thus, the phenotype and function of naive B cells of both strains were indistinguishable.

Antipeptide response of muMT mice reconstituted with either WT B cells or Fcgamma-/- B cells. Spleens were taken from 6-8-wk-old WT and Fcgamma-/- mice. B cells were purified as described in Materials and methods, and 2 x 107 total B cells were adoptively transferred to muMT mice i.v. After 2 wk, muMT mice with WT B cells or Fcgamma-/- B cells were immunized with 100 mug MAP peptide as described. Blood was collected on days 0, 14, 28, and 42, and the antipeptide antibody was measured by ELISA. Closed circles, muMT mice with WT B cells; open circles, muMT mice with Fcgamma-/- B cells. Each circle represents an individual mouse, and the horizontal bar is the mean.

Because the antibody response in Fcgamma-/- mice was of low affinity and the memory response was impaired, we hypothesized that there was a defect in germinal center maturation, which generates both memory B cells and long-lived plasma cells, and a preferential generation of short-lived plasma cells (13-16). Short-lived plasma cells develop in T cell-dependent responses but do not display affinity maturation and are not associated with a clonally related memory B cell population (17, 18). After activation with antigen, short-lived plasma cells reside primarily in the extrafollicular foci of the spleen, whereas long-lived plasma cells preferentially migrate to the BM (16-19). First, we determined the number of antibody-secreting cells (including plasmablasts, short-lived plasma cells, and long-lived plasma cells) in the spleen. There was a higher percentage of B220lo and CD138+ cells in the B cell population in MAP peptide-immunized Fcgamma-/- mice compared with WT mice on day 8 (Fig. 3 a). To determine the location of B220lo and CD138+ cells within the spleen, immunohistochemistry was performed on spleens of immunized mice. The majority of CD138+ cells were positioned outside the B cell follicles where short-lived plasma cells reside (Fig. 3 b). CD138+ cells colocalized with kappa chain positivity but not with CD4 positivity (unpublished data). To confirm this observation, we also performed peptide-specific ELISPOT assays of splenic B cells. Fig. 3 c shows that 2.5-fold more cells secreting specific antibody were present in spleens of Fcgamma-/- mice than in WT spleens. By day 28, splenic plasma cells from both Fcgamma-/- and WT mice declined in number, presumably because of apoptosis of short-lived plasma cells.

Immunized Fcgamma-/- mice have increased numbers of plasma cells in their spleen and decreased numbers in their BM compared with WT mice. (a) Spleens were taken from WT and Fcgamma-/- mice on days 0, 8, and 12 after immunization, and splenocytes were stained with PE-conjugated goat anti-mouse CD138 and FITC-conjugated goat anti-mouse B220. The percentage of cells that were CD138+ and B220lo was analyzed by FlowJo software. Mean +/- SD of two independent experiments is shown, and each experiment contained pooled cells from three mice. (b) Spleens were taken at days 0, 4, and 8 after immunization, and frozen tissue sections were incubated with anti-B220-FITC (green) and anti-CD138-PE (red). Results are representative of at least three mice per group. Images are magnified 10x and insets are 40x. Arrows indicate the position of CD138+B220lo cells. Bars, 100 mm. (c) Antipeptide ELISPOTs were performed on splenocytes taken on day 21 after immunization. Fcgamma-/- mice are shown in gray and WT mice are shown in black. There were five mice in each group. P </= 0.05. Data are mean +/- SD. (d) BM was obtained on days 21 and 35 after primary immunization. CD138+ cells were purified by sorting. An equal number of CD138+ cells from each strain were plated for an antipeptide ELISPOT assay. The number of spots was counted and total number of antipeptide antibody secreting cells was enumerated (mean +/- SD of four mice). *, P </= 0.05.

Long-lived plasma cells migrate to the BM, where they secrete antibody. To determine whether long-lived plasma cells were being generated in Fcgamma-/- mice, we enumerated plasma cells by peptide-specific ELISPOT assays in the BM. Plasma cells were detectable in the BM between days 21 and 35 after the initial immunization. Fcgamma-/- mice had 5.3-fold fewer peptide-specific plasma cells in the BM on day 35 (Fig. 3 d). These results were consistent with the preferential generation of short-lived plasma cells in Fcgamma-/- mice in contrast to the predominance of long-lived plasma cells present in the BM of WT mice.

Because the antipeptide antibody response was previously shown to be a T cell-dependent response in WT mice (2), we questioned whether the antibody response in Fcgamma-/- mice was also T cell dependent, as it displayed less evidence of germinal center formation. Fig. 4 a shows that antibody generation is abolished in CD4 T cell-depleted mice. Thus, the diminished germinal center response is not caused by an absent T cell response.

The antipeptide response in Fcgamma-/- is T cell dependent. (a) Fcgamma-/- mice were injected i.p. with 500 mug GK1.5 mAb (circles) or saline (squares) on days -1, 0, and +1. All mice were immunized, boosted with 100 mug MAP peptide, and boosted as described in Materials and methods (arrows indicate time of boost). Serum was collected on days 0, 14, 28, and 42, and an antipeptide ELISA was performed. *, P </= 0.05 (n = 3). (b) 105 BMDCs were pulsed with MAP peptide and cultured with T cells from MAP peptide-immunized WT or Fcgamma-/- mice in a 1:1 (BMDC/T) ratio. 3 d later, 3H-thymidine was added and incorporated thymidine was measured. *, P </= 0.05. These results are representative of three independent experiments. (c) Vbeta usage was measured in WT and Fcgamma-/- mice. T cells were harvested from naive and MAP peptide-immunized WT and Fcgamma-/- mice as described in Materials and methods. T cells were incubated with peptide in vitro for 14 d. Naive and cultured CD4+ T cells were stained with fluorochrome-labeled anti-Vbeta chain antibodies. CD4 T cells expressing particular Vbeta chains were analyzed by FlowJo software. Data are presented as mean +/- SD.

Antigen-specific T cells are activated by MAP peptide immunization in Fcgamma-/- mice. To demonstrate T cell activation in Fcgamma-/- mice, we assessed antigen-specific proliferation of T cells from MAP peptide-immunized mice. T cells from MAP peptide-immunized Fcgamma-/- and WT mice proliferated in response to antigen (Fig. 4 b). In fact, the response of T cells from Fcgamma-/- T cells was greater than that of WT T cells. To ascertain whether this enhanced T cell response reflected a change in T cell repertoire, we assessed Vbeta usage. Fig. 4 c shows that there was no significant difference in TCR Vbeta chain usage between WT and Fcgamma-/- mice, either before or after MAP peptide immunization. Furthermore, antigen-specific T cells from both strains produced IL-2 and IFN-gamma (unpublished data). These data demonstrate that T cells in Fcgamma-/- mice were activated to at least the same extent as T cells from WT mice after MAP peptide immunization. Thus, the altered antibody response is not a consequence of a failure of T cell priming.

To demonstrate directly that Fcgamma-/- mice display reduced germinal center maturation of B cells, we asked whether the reduced affinity of serum antibodies in Fcgamma-/- mice reflected a relative lack of somatic hypermutation occurring in the Fcgamma-/- mice, as somatic hypermutation is a feature of the germinal center response and a critical contribution to affinity maturation. To address this question, we generated antigen-specific hybridomas from WT and Fcgamma-/- mice immunized with MAP peptide. We examined the number of mutations in the region downstream of the rearranged JH in B cells making antipeptide antibody. We chose to enumerate mutations in this region because it has been shown to undergo hypermutation. Because it is not a coding region, it is not subject to the pressures of selection. As seen in Fig. 5 a, hybridomas from Fcgamma-/- mice had many fewer mutations. Splenic histology displayed fewer germinal centers in Fcgamma-/- mice after immunization (Fig. 5 b). This was confirmed by quantification of B220+ PNA+ cells in the spleen (Table S1, available at ). There were very few PNA+ cells in the B220+ population in Fcgamma-/- mice on days 8 and 16 after immunization compared with WT mice (Fig. 5 c). We also measured activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID) induction in germinal center B lymphocytes because expression of AID is suppressed in mature B cells and only expressed in germinal center B cells (20). WT mice display a significant induction of AID in germinal center B cells. Fcgamma-/- mice, however, did not show any significant induction of AID, which is consistent with a diminished germinal center reaction in these mice (Fig. 5 d). These studies all support a reduced germinal center response in Fcgamma-/- mice.

Fcgamma-/- mice display a diminished germinal center response. (a) The JH2 to JH4 region was sequenced in MAP peptide-immunized mice (three mice in each group). Charts depict the mean mutation frequencies (frequency is defined as mutations per base pair sequenced x 10-3) for the hybridoma clones that were sequenced (center of pie) and the proportion of sequences with mutations (numbers of mutations outside the pie slice). (b) Representative images of spleen sections from immunized WT and Fcgamma-/- mice. Spleens were obtained on each designated day after immunization protocol and frozen for staining. Sections were stained with B cell-specific antibody B220-PE (red) and with germinal center marker PNA-FITC (green; three mice in each group). Bars, 100 mm. (c) Enumeration of PNA+ B cells. Spleens were collected from WT and Fcgamma-/- mice on days 0, 8, and 16 after immunization. Splenocytes were stained with FITC-conjugated PNA and PE-conjugated goat anti-mouse B220. Cells were analyzed on an LSRII and the populations of B220+PNA+ and B220+PNA- were calculated by FlowJo software. Closed circles, WT BALB/c; open circles, Fcgamma-/- mice. Each circle represents an individual mouse and the horizontal bar denotes the mean. *, P </= 0.05. (d) AID induction in germinal center B cells. Both WT and Fcgamma-/- mice were immunized at day 0 and killed at day 12. Purified B cells were further stained with FITC-conjugated PNA. B220+ and PNA+ cells were sorted as germinal center cells and B220+PNA- cells were sorted as nongerminal center cells. Total RNA was extracted from each population and AID expression was measured by real-time PCR. The analysis was performed on B cells isolated from each of three WT or Fcgamma-/- mice. Mean +/- SD.of the individual mice is shown. *, P </= 0.05.

Vogel et al. (21) showed that IL-12 can bind directly to B cells and induce plasma cell formation, and Dubois et al. (22, 23) have shown that DCs can induce naive B cells to proliferate in an IL-12-dependent manner. We therefore examined whether BM-derived DCs (BMDCs) from Fcgamma-/- mice were more potent producers of IL-12 and stimulators of B cell proliferation. IL-12 was measured in immature and LPS-matured BMDCs by intracellular flow cytometry and cytokine ELISA. Flow cytometry, which measured IL-12 p40, demonstrated a twofold increase in the number of DCs producing IL-12 in Fcgamma-/- mice (Fig. 6 a). A cytokine ELISA for IL-12 p40/70 detected IL-12 production only by LPS-stimulated BMDCs and confirmed a two- to threefold increase in production by Fcgamma-/- DCs (Fig. 6 b). Real-time PCR also demonstrated increased induction of IL-12p35 and p40 in LPS-stimulated BMDC from Fcgamma-/- mice (Fig. 6 c). Fcgamma-/- BMDCs also displayed significantly higher expression of MHC II, CD80, and CD86 than WT BMDCs (Fig. S2, available at ). Finally, we measured IL-12 expression in splenic DCs after MAP peptide immunization in vivo. Both WT and Fcgamma-/- mice were immunized. On days 1 and 3, total splenic DCs were purified and further cultured for 16 h to permit cytokine secretion. Fig. 6 d demonstrates that splenic DCs from Fcgamma-/- mice expressed about twofold more IL-12 than DCs from WT mice by day 3.

Fcgamma-/- BMDCs exhibit increased IL-12 secretion compared with WT BMDCs. (a) Unstimulated and LPS-stimulated BMDCs were stained with anti-CD11c PE extracellularly and anti-IL-12-APC intracellularly and analyzed by flow cytometry. These results are representative of three independent experiments. (b) LPS-stimulated BMDCs were cultured for 24 h, and an anti-IL-12 cytokine ELISA was performed on the supernatant. Fcgamma-/- BMDCs are shown in gray and WT BMDCs are shown in black. IL-12 levels were not detectable by ELISA in unstimulated cultures. The assay was performed in triplicate. *, P </= 0.05 . Results are representative of mean +/- SD of three independent experiments. (c) Total RNA was purified from unstimulated or LPS-stimulated BMDCs for 4 h. 1 mug of total RNA was used for PCR. S18 rRNA gene was amplified as an internal control. Relative expression of IL-12a and b was calculated as described in Materials and methods. *, P </= 0.05. The results are mean +/- SD of three experiments. (d) IL-12 produced by splenic DCs. Mice were immunized as described previously and splenic DCs were purified on days 1 and 3 after immunization. Cells were plated at 106 /ml in 24-well plates for 16 h. IL-12 in the supernatant was analyzed by ELISA. *, P </= 0.05 (mean +/- SD of three individual mice). (e) Splenic B cells and peritoneal macrophages were isolated and the purity of the populations was determined as described in Materials and methods. For B cells, 106 cells/ml were plated in 24-well plates alone, with 5 mug/ml of LPS, or with 5 mug/ml LPS with 20 mug/ml of activating anti-CD40 antibodies and incubated for 18 h. Supernatants were harvested and IL-12 p40 was measured as described. For macrophages, 106 cells/ml were cultured in 24-well plates with or without 2 mug/ml LPS for 18 h. IL-12 p40 and p70 in the supernatant was measured by ELISA (mean +/- SD of four individual mice).

Because there are other cell types that can produce IL-12 upon activation, we measured production of IL-12 by macrophages and B cells. As seen in previous studies, LPS stimulation strongly induced production of IL-12 from peritoneal macrophages, but there was no difference between WT and Fcgamma-/- macrophages. B cells from WT and Fcgamma-/- mice also produced equal amounts of IL-12 p40 after upon LPS and LPS plus anti-CD40 antibody stimulation. (Fig. 6 e).

To confirm that the increased IL-12 could lead to an expanded B cell population, naive WT B cells were cultured with anti-CD40 antibody and irradiated BMDCs from either Fcgamma-/- or WT mice. After 5 d in culture, B cells proliferated in the presence of Fcgamma-/- BMDCs, whereas little or no BMDC-dependent proliferation was seen in the presence of WT BMDCs (Fig. 7 a). Furthermore, when a neutralizing anti-IL-12 antibody was added at the beginning of the culture, B cell proliferation driven by Fcgamma-/- BMDCs decreased by as much as 80% (Fig. 7 b). Because anti-IL-12 antibody recognizes both the p35 and the p40 subunits of IL-12 and p40 is also a subunit of IL-23, there is a possibility of inhibition of both cytokines by the anti-IL-12 antibody. To address this problem, IL-12a (p35)-specific siRNA was used. Transfection efficiency was determined and specificity of IL-12a siRNA was confirmed using control siRNA and analyzing gene expression of IL-12b (Fig. S3, available at ). Consistent with the results using anti-IL-12 antibody, IL-12a siRNA transfection of BMDCs abrogated the proliferation of B cells (Fig. 7 c). The inhibition was specific, as transfection with control siRNA showed no significant reduction in B cell proliferation. Therefore, Fcgamma-/- DCs are potent stimulators of B cell proliferation, and their stimulatory function depends largely on the production of IL-12.

Lymphocyte proliferation with BMDCs. (a) 5 x 104 WT B cells were cultured for 6 d in the presence of anti-CD40 mAb with varying numbers of irradiated BMDCs from either WT (black bars) or Fcgamma-/- (gray bars) mice. B cell proliferation was determined by 3H incorporation. The assay was performed in triplicate. *, P </= 0.05; **, P </= 0.01. These results are mean +/- SD of three independent experiments. (b) The proliferation assay was performed as above with WT B cells and Fcgamma-/- BMDCs in the presence (gray bars) or absence (black bars) of 10 mug of neutralizing monoclonal anti-IL-12 antibody. The results are reported as the difference in proliferation between cultures in which BMDCs are present and absent. These results are mean +/- SD of three independent experiments. (c) A proliferation assay was performed with siRNA-transfected BMDCs. BMDCs were generated from WT mice and Fcgamma-/- mice. 10 muM of either anti-IL-12a or control siRNA was transfected, as described in Materials and methods, at day 7 of culture. The next day, siRNA-transfected and -untransfected DCs were incubated with 1 mug/ml LPS to mature DCs. Proliferation assays were performed as described in Materials and methods. The results are mean +/- SD of five indivual mice.

To confirm that the increased IL-12 production by DCs accounted for the altered antibody response seen in vivo in Fcgamma-/- mice, we determined if WT mice given supplemental IL-12 would produce more plasma cells in spleen. WT mice were injected i.p. with 1 mug of either soluble IL-12 or saline on days -1, 0, and +1 of the immunization schedule. Antigen boosts were given with no additional IL-12. 11 d after the last boost, WT mice treated with IL-12 had approximately threefold more splenic antibody-secreting cells than untreated mice, which is similar to the difference observed in Fcgamma-/- mice (Fig. 8 a). IL-12-treated WT mice also experienced an approximately35% decrease in BM plasma cells, which is also similar to Fcgamma-/- mice (Fig. 8 b). Thus, exogenous IL-12 caused WT mice to acquire a phenotype of antigen-specific B cells similar to that of Fcgamma-/- mice. We confirmed this observation in a study of Fcgamma-/-.IL-12a+/- mice. First, we examined the effect of IL-12 in WT, Fcgamma-/- mice, or Fcgamma-/-.IL-12a+/- mice. The level of expression of IL-12 p35 assessed by real-time PCR showed decreases in both WT and Fcgamma-/-.IL-12a+/- mice compared with Fcgamma-/- mice (Fig. S4, available at ). MAP peptide-immunized Fcgamma-/-.IL-12a+/- mice generated a low number of antipeptide antibody secreting cells in spleen, which is similar to WT mice (Fig. 8 c), and a high number of plasma cells in the BM, which is also similar to WT mice (Fig. 8 d). The enhanced B cell response of the Fcgamma-/- mice can, therefore, be attributed, at least in part, to increased IL-12 production by DCs, as it is altered when IL-12 production is diminished.

Understanding mechanisms underlying the commitment to a particular B cell fate has clinical importance. Memory cells can proliferate extensively upon secondary challenge, and long-lived plasma cells can secrete antibody for long periods of time without antigen contact. Therefore, the prevalence of autoreactivity in the memory population may result in a chronic antibody-mediated disease. In contrast, short-lived plasma cells may generate large amounts of a pathogenic antibody that, as shown in this study, does not necessarily need to be of the highest affinity to cause organ damage.

Through the analysis of Fcgamma-/- mice, we have demonstrated that DCs participate in determining B cell differentiation in vivo. Fcgamma-/- B cells became predominantly splenic plasma cells upon activation instead of forming the more heterogeneous population of short-lived and long-lived plasma cells and memory cells seen in WT mice. Current data suggest that the majority of splenic plasma cells are short lived, whereas plasma cells in the BM can be either short lived or long lived (15, 18, 19, 24). In our study, Fcgamma-/- mice had a transient surge of plasma cells in the spleen, while displaying a diminished rise in plasma cells in the BM and a reduced memory B cell response. In contrast, WT mice had a smaller population of splenic plasma cells and an increase in BM plasma cells after immunization and demonstrated B cell memory upon secondary challenge with antigen. Fcgamma-/- mice produced significantly higher serum titers of specific antibody than WT mice and displayed class switching to IgG2a as well as IgG1. The increase in serum antipeptide and anti-DNA response appears to be an FcR-dependent phenomenon because FcgammaRI-/- immunized with MAP peptide showed a similar phenotype (Fig. S5, available at ). These features of the response may account for the increased glomerular dysfunction. Interestingly, antibodies from Fcgamma-/- displayed less affinity maturation. This serologic data were confirmed by the demonstration of reduced GL-7-positive cells in splenic B cells of Fcgamma-/- mice (unpublished data) and less somatic mutation in antigen-specific hybridomas. Because some studies suggest that short-lived and long-lived plasma cells arise from completely separate precursors (25), we are currently studying the B cells responding to antigen in WT and Fcgamma-/- mice to determine if the same clones are activated or whether the plasma cell precursors differ between the strains.

DCs have previously been shown to mediate a critical function in B cell activation by transporting antigen from the periphery to T and B cells (26). The altered B cell phenotype we observed in Fcgamma-/- could also be traced to the influence of Fcgamma-/- DCs and IL-12. Fcgamma-/- DCs had a more mature phenotype and produced at least twofold more IL-12 than WT DCs. Several studies have established a role for IL-12 in B cell differentiation and function. IL-12 can induce plasma cell formation and B cell heavy chain class switching to IgG1 and IgG2a. The switch to IgG2 is IFN-gamma-dependent, whereas the promotion of differentiation to plasma cells and the switch to IgG1 does not require IFN-gamma (27). Studies in human primary B cells have also shown that IL-12 up-regulates IL-12Rbeta2 expression and IFN-gamma production by B cells, possibly allowing them to function as B effector cells and promote the activation of Th1 cells (28). Notably, although IL-12 promotes short-lived plasma cells, perhaps in synergy with CD40L (27), memory B cell differentiation occurs independently of IL-12 (22, 23). In our study, when IL-12 was administered to WT mice, the mice responded to antigen immunization with the generation of more splenic plasma cells and fewer BM plasma cells, a pattern mimicking that seen in immunized Fcgamma-/- mice. Therefore, IL-12 produced by DCs seems to be highly influential in directing B cell differentiation. It is possible that this difference in differentiation pathway reflects a change in the environment in which the B cell resides rather than a direct effect on the B cell. We do not favor this explanation, as chemokine expression in the spleen is similar in both strains (Fig. S6, available at ). Furthermore, IL-12 has been shown by others to act directly on B cells (21). Interestingly, CR2 (CD21/CD35) has also been reported to diminish the development of long-lived plasma cells while leaving intact the generation of short-lived plasmablasts, germinal center, and memory B cells. This effect is mediated through the regulation of Blimp-1 and XBP-1, which are critical transcription factors in plasma cell differentiation (29). CR2, like FcR, appears to function through a B cell-intrinsic pathway that specifically arrests the differentiation of long-lived plasma cells. We should note, however, that antigen-specific T cell proliferation was enhanced in Fcgamma-/- mice. The enhanced number of antigen-specific T cells expressing CD40L and available to interact with antigen-specific B cells may also contribute to the preferential generation of short-lived plasma cells. Thus, both the direct action of DCs on B cells as well as the action of T cells in Fcgamma-/- mice may contribute to skewing the B cell response.

Although the differences in IL-12 production between the mouse strains may seem small, we have previously shown in studies of hormonal effects on B cells that a 20% change in expression of CD22 can affect B cell receptor signaling and alter negative selection (30). Recently, McGaha et al. (31) have shown that a 50% increase in FcgammaRIIb expression in B cells can prevent disease in lupus-prone mice. Thus, it should not be surprising that a twofold increase in IL-12 production by DCs can affect B cell differentiation. In fact, a study of experimental myasthenia gravis in mice also demonstrated that exogenous IL-12 given in a similar protocol led to increased serum antibody (27).

A previous study reported no alteration in humoral response to the hapten NP in Fcgamma-/- mice. This study was performed on C57BL/6 mice deficient in the FcR gamma chain and may reveal a strain-dependent difference in FcR gamma chain function. It is also possible, however, that the force of selection for high-affinity antibodies in the NP model is so strong that differences in B cell differentiation were obscured. Some effects were seen that were similar to those we report. For example, in the reported study that Fcgamma-/- mice had fewer splenic germinal centers after immunization.

We do not yet fully understand why the absence of the gamma chain leads to the observed DC phenotype. Studies on gamma chain-deficient mice have focused on alterations in expression and function of FcRI, FcRIII, and FcRIV (32). To confirm that the serological changes were mediated through FcR engagement, we have immunized FcRIII-deficient mice with MAP peptide. These mice show increased serum antipeptide antibodies (fivefold increase) and an activated phenotype of BMDCs. Similarly, DCs derived from BM cells under serum-free conditions also display an activated phenotype, which is, again, consistent with FcR engagement modulating DC function (26). The activated phenotype was abrogated by addition of purified IgG to the culture. Although gamma chain-containing Fc receptors have been demonstrated to be activating receptors, we speculated that engagement of these receptors may diminish the response to other activating receptors. Such reciprocal regulation of toll-like receptor 9 and IgE receptor signaling has already been demonstrated. Production of type I IFN by plasmacytoid DC is inhibited by preexposure of FcepsilonRI to IgG (33). These two signaling pathways counterregulate the development of Th1 and Th2 immune response. Park-Min et al. (34) recently demonstrated that immune complexes binding to FcgammaRIII suppresses LPS-mediated IFNgamma signaling in both human peripheral blood mononuclear cells derived macrophages and murine peritoneal macrophages. A recent publication reported that human peripheral monocyte-derived DC cultures exposed to immune complexes show diminished differentiation. Furthermore, in response to TLR-mediated stimulation, they produced less IL-12 (35). This inhibition was mediated mainly through FcgammaRI but, to a lesser extent by FcgammaRII. Thus, there is precedent for an absence of engagement of activating FcRs permitting an enhanced response in other activation pathways. Although the mechanism for the altered function of Fcgamma-/- DC requires further confirmation, it is apparent that the difference in IL-12 production by DCs affects B cell differentiation. This study reports the first in vivo manipulation that leads to differential formation of short-lived and long-lived plasma cells. Understanding how to modulate B cell differentiation will facilitate an appreciation of the role of both short-lived and long lived plasma cells. Furthermore, knowledge of the B cell phenotype responsible for the production of antiself or antimicrobial antibodies will help in the design of therapeutic strategies in autoimmune disease, as well as in optimizing vaccine development.

Cells from the draining lymph nodes of naive mice or mice immunized 7 d earlier with MAP peptide in CFA or CFA alone were harvested and plated at 3 x 106 cells/ml in IMDM supplemented with 10% FCS, 2 mM glutamine, 100 U/ml penicillin, 100 mug/ml streptomycin, and 50 muM beta-mercaptoethanol in the presence of 50 mug/ml MAP peptide. 7 d later, the cultures were supplemented with 50 U/ml of recombinant human IL-2 (Invitrogen) and 3 x 106 RBC-depleted irradiated (1,500 rads) splenocytes/ml along with fresh medium. 14 d after the initial culture, cells were collected. 2 x 105 cells were stained with 100 mul of 1 mug/ml CD4-PE in 2% FCS/PBS for 30 min on ice and then stained for the various Vbeta chains using FITC-labeled antibodies. All labeled antibodies were obtained from BD Biosciences and data were acquired using a FACScan (Becton Dickinson). Peptide-specific T cells were identified by comparison of lymph node cultures from mice immunized with MAP peptide in CFA to those from mice immunized with CFA alone. Little proliferation was detected in the latter with 3-4 times as many live cells found in the peptide-specific cultures compared with the CFA controls.

Mice were injected i.p. with 1 mug rIL-12 or saline on days -1, 0, and 1 after immunization with MAP peptide in CFA. Mice were then boosted as described in Materials and methods with no further administration of IL-12. On day 25, mice were killed, and a peptide-specific ELISPOT assay was performed on splenocytes. BM cells were harvested, and plasma cells were enumerated by flow cytometry as described above.

BALB/c WT and Fcgamma-/- mice were immunized as described in Materials and methods. 3 d after boosting, mice were killed and total splenocytes were harvested. Cells were fused with the NSO myeloma fusion partner using standard hybridoma technology. 2 wk after fusion, antipeptide antibody secreting clones were screened. Genomic DNA was purified from positive clones by TRIzol reagent. The JH2-JH4 region was amplified using Pfu turbo (Stratagene) followed by previously described protocol (38). PCR was performed with the following primers: 5' primer, 5'-GGCACCACTCTCACAGTCTCCTCAGG-3'; and 3' primer, 5'-TGAGACCGAGGCTAGATGCC-3'. PCR conditions were the following: 95degreesC for 30 s, 60degreesC for 30 s, and 72degreesC for 15 min for 35 cycles. PCR products were purified and sequenced at the DNA sequencing facility at the Columbia University Medical Center.
