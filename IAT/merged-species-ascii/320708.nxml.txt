The primary structure of the promoter region for a ribosomal RNA transcription unit (rrnG) of Escherichia coli K12 has been determined. The sequence was obtained from 1 1.5 kbp EcoRI fragment derived from the hybrid plasmid pLC23-30. This fragment contains 455 bp preceding P1 of the rrnG promoter region and 674 bp of the rrnG 16S RNA gene. The sequence before the rrnG promoter region contains an open reading frame (ORF-BG) followed by a possible hairpin structure that resembles other known transcription terminators. The sequence of the rrnG promoter region is similar but not identical to that of rrnA and rrnB. Several minor differences between the sequences of the 16S RNA genes of rrnG and rrnB were also noted. In addition, sequences were found that could generate special structures involving the promoter regions of rrn loci. Such structures are described and their possible involvement in the regulation of ribosomal RNA synthesis is discussed.
