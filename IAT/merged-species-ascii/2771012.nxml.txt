Amyloid-beta is recognized as the major constituent of senile plaque found in subjects with Alzheimer's disease. However, there is increasing evidence that in a physiological context amyloid-beta may serve as regulating apolipoprotein, primarily of the triglyceride enriched lipoproteins. To consider this hypothesis further, this study utilized an in vivo immunological approach to explore in lipogenic tissue whether amyloid-beta colocalizes with nascent triglyceride-rich lipoproteins.

In murine absorptive epithelial cells of the small intestine, amyloid-beta had remarkable colocalization with chylomicrons (Manders overlap coefficient = 0.73 +/- 0.03 (SEM)), the latter identified as immunoreactive apolipoprotein B. A diet enriched in saturated fats doubled the abundance of both amyloid-beta and apo B and increased the overlap coefficient of the two proteins (0.87 +/- 0.02). However, there was no evidence that abundance of the two proteins was interdependent within the enterocytes (Pearson's Coefficient < 0.02 +/- 0.03), or in plasma (Pearson's Coefficient < 0.01).

Conclusion
###end title 6
###begin p 7
The findings of this study are consistent with the possibility that amyloid-beta is secreted by enterocytes as an apolipoprotein component of chylomicrons. However, secretion of amyloid-beta appears to be independent of chylomicron biogenesis.

Amyloid-beta is recognized as the principal protein in senile plaques in subjects with Alzheimer's disease (AD) [1]. Generated from the slicing of amyloid precursor protein (betaAPP) by secretases, the synthesis of amyloid-beta can be differentially modulated by cellular lipid homeostasis. Studies in cell culture and in vivo suggest that cholesterol inhibits amyloid-beta biogenesis [2-4], although this effect may be dependent on the distribution of free and esterified cholesterol within the plasma membrane and within lipid rafts [5]. In contrast, in vivo studies found that chronic ingestion of diets enriched in saturated-fats (SFA) had a potent stimulatory effect on enterocytic amyloid-beta abundance [6].

Several lines of evidence suggest that one physiological role for amyloid-beta is as a regulating apolipoprotein, particularly of the triglyceride-rich lipoproteins (TRL's). Koudinov et al reported that amyloid-beta is secreted by hepatocytes as a lipoprotein complex [7]. Significant plasma abundance of amyloid-beta was also found in the TRL fraction of control subjects and amyloid-beta enrichment in TRL's was evident in subjects with AD, or with mild cognitive impairment [8]. Ingestion of a lipid rich meal also causes a transient increase in plasma of soluble APP, concomitant with postprandial lipaemia [9] and when injected intravenously associated with TRL-emulsions, amyloid-beta increased uptake in fat-rich tissues relative to liver [10].

The betaAPP is expressed on the plasma membrane of a number of tissues including lipogenic organs such as liver [6]. Proteolytic cleavage of betaAPP generally results in the extracellular release of amyloid-beta which is then chaperoned by transporter proteins [11-14]. However, hydrophobic domains within amyloid-beta [15] results in rapid folding of amyloid-beta that make it unlikely to readily associate with lipoproteins already secreted into circulation. Rather, immunhistochemistical studies show amyloid-beta abundance within the perinuclear region of hepatocytes and absorptive epithelial cells of the small intestine [4,6,7,16], suggesting that amyloid-beta may form part of the primordial lipoprotein during the lipidation process. Consistent with the latter, using a phage display Nelson and Alkon showed that amyloid-beta bound tightly with several apolipoproteins found commonly with TRL [17]. To further consider the possibility that amyloid-beta becomes associated with nascent lipoproteins, in this study we utilized sensitive three-dimensional (3D) immunofluorescent (IF) microscopy to explore if enterocytic abundance of amyloid-beta is associated with chylomicrons. Apolipoprotein (apo) B, an obligatory component of TRL secreted by intestine and liver, was used as a marker of enterocytic chylomicron distribution and plasma abundance of TRL.

The protocols described in this study were approved by an accredited National Health and Medical Research Council of Australia Animal Ethics Committee (Curtin University Animal Experimentation and Ethics Committee Reference number R02-07). Six-week-old female C57BL/6J mice (Animal resources centre, Murdoch, Western Australia) were divided randomly into a low-fat (LF) or saturated fatty acid (SFA) diet group. Low fat mice were given chow that contained 3.6% (w/w) as unsaturated fat and 0.4% SFA (AIN93M, Specialty Feeds, Western Australia). The SFA enriched chow contained 12.9% (w/w) as saturated fats and 7.4% as unsaturated oils (SF07-50, Specialty feeds, Western Australia). Both diets were free of cholesterol. Digestible energy for LF and SFA feed were 15.1 MJ/kg and 18.8 MJ/kg respectively and feed was available ad libitum. After three-months of dietary intervention, mice were sacrificed by pentobarbital injection. The small intestine was isolated and flushed with chilled phosphate buffered saline (PBS, pH 7.4). A 2 cm segment of the small intestine distal to the duodenum was fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for a minimum of 24 h, processed and longitudinal segments embedded in paraffin wax. Serial sections of 5 mum thick were cut on microtome and mounted on silanised slides for histology and immunofluorescence microscopy.

An established double IF labelling method was utilized as previously described [18]. Cross reactivity was prevented using a biotin-avidin amplification technique microscopy. The concentration of the primary antibody used with biotin-avidin amplification is substantially below the threshold required for detection by standard IF and does not interfere with detection of the second protein.

Digital images were captured using AxioCam mRM and ApoTome on a Zeiss Axiovert 200 M inverted microscope and visualized with Plan-NeoFluar lenses (Carl Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany). Excitation and emission were achieved by using filters 43 (Ex BP545/25, beam splitter FT570 and Em BP605/70) and 38 (Ex BP470/40, beam splitter FT495 and Em BP525/50) to determine fluorescence of Alexa546 and Alexa488 respectively. Filter 49 (Ex G365, beam splitter FT 395 and Em BP445/50) was used to detect nuclei stain DAPI. Individual channels are devoid of fluorescence from other emission sources and are therefore clear of bleed-through.

Three-dimensional images were captured using the ApoTome optical sectioning mode which allows the creation of a 3D image based on the 'stacking' of consecutive 2D images. Each 3D image consisted from 8-10 2D images, and the axial distance of Z-stack was 0.5 mum for 200x. There were 6 animals per group with a minimum of 40 images per mouse used for analysis. Fluorescent intensity and area were determined using the measurement and colocalization module available on AxioVision v4.7.1 software (Carl Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany).

There are several algorithms capable of achieving measures of colocalization or association via measurement of fluorescent pixel spatial orientation and pixel intensity. The Pearson's correlation coefficient (r) is a commonly used quantitative estimate of association (abundance) for proteins [19]. However, as Pearson's correlation is a measure of variance from the mean pixel intensity, it does not provide information of the area of overlap. A modification to Pearson's correlation coefficient developed by Manders et al (1993) eliminates the average grey values from the Pearson's formula to allow the quantification of overlapping pixels from each channel [19]. The degree of colocalization for the proteins is positively related to the Manders coefficient, known commonly as the 'overlap coefficient' (OC). The AxioVision software utilizes an automated procedure based on spatial statistics to determine Pearson's correlation coefficient and Manders OC, thereby avoiding selection bias by manual selection methods.

Enterocytic chylomicrons were detected by determining the distribution of apo B, an obligatory structural component of chylomicrons. Significant amounts of amyloid-beta and apo B were found to be enriched within the perinuclear region of cells. Amyloid-beta and apo B colocalized with the Golgi-apparatus, towards the basolateral surface of the cell and within the lacteals (Figure 1). The patterns of distribution for amyloid-beta and apo B remained essentially the same in LF and SFA fed mice (Figure 2), however abundance of each protein more than doubled in SFA fed mice compared to LF fed animals (Table 1, columns 1 and 2).

To explore if abundance of the amyloid-beta was inter-dependent with TRL biogenesis and secretion, correlation analysis with apo B was determined within enterocytes and in plasma respectively. Pearson's correlation analysis found that just 2% of amyloid-beta and apo B fluorescent intensities were positively associated in enterocytes of LF or any of the SFA fed mice (table 1). Similarly, in plasma there was no evidence that the principal isoforms of amyloid-beta (amyloid-beta40 and 42) were associated with intestinal or hepatic apo B lipoproteins (figure 3).

In this study the distribution and abundance of amyloid-beta and apo B were detected in small intestinal enterocytes using an established double-labeled avidin-biotin IF microscopy technique [18]. Amyloid-beta and chylomicron-apo B were remarkably colocalized in enterocytes, consistent with release of amyloid-beta as a lipoprotein complex [7]. We also confirm that chronic consumption of SFA increases enterocytic amyloid-beta and now show that this occurrence is concomitant with a substantially greater abundance of enterocytic apo B [6]. However, there was no evidence from this study that the biogenesis of amyloid-beta and apo B are inter-dependent based on Pearson's correlation analysis within enterocytes and in plasma.

The biosynthesis of chylomicrons occurs in a multi-step process that requires the progressive lipidation of apo B an obligatory structural component of primordial lipoproteins secreted by the small intestine [20,21]. A number of proteins are reported to associate with nascent chylomicrons prior to secretion, including apo A-I, A-IV, apo J, apo D, apo E and small molecular weight proteins such as apo C-II. Nascent chylomicrons are then transported via the Golgi-apparatus to the basolateral membrane and secreted into lymphatics. The results from this study suggest that amyloid-beta is secreted from small intestinal enterocytes as an apolipoprotein of chylomicrons.

Immunoreactivity for amyloid-beta and apo B was found selectively within the ER/Golgi-apparatus and not on the plasma membrane. The findings are consistent with biogenesis of amyloid-beta at the ER and translocation to primordial lipoproteins, rather than as a consequence of beta APP processing. Similar results in hepatocyte cultures with secretion of amyloid-beta also occurring exclusively as a lipoprotein complex [7].

Dietary SFA promote chylomicron biogenesis by stimulating apo B lipidation [22,23], an essential step to avoid post-translational degradation by intracellular proteases [24]. Greater lipid substrate availability (as a result of SFA ingestion) reduces the proportion of apo B that would otherwise be degraded. The SFA dietary intervention used in this study essentially doubled enterocytic apo B and a similar increase in amyloid-beta abundance was observed. However, the mechanisms by which SFA stimulate amyloid-beta abundance and association with nascent chylomicrons are less clear. Saturated-FA may have a broader non-specific effect on enterocytic protein synthesis and consistent with the possibility of substrate driven biogenesis, Patil (2006) [25] found in neurons treated with palmitic acid resulted in increased upregulation BACE, a key enzyme complex involved in the processing of beta APP. Alternatively, amyloid-beta is an amphiphatic protein with a C-terminal domain that avidly binds with negatively charged hydrophobic lipids [15]. Increased substrate availability and synergistic lipidation of amyloid-beta and apo B may promote the incorporation of amyloid-beta into nascent chylomicrons and subsequently stimulate further synthesis of the proteins.

The SFA induction and secretion of enterocytic amyloid-beta may be important in the context of AD risk. Recent studies suggest that blood-to-brain delivery of amyloid-beta may contribute to amyloidosis, particularly when the concentration of circulating amyloid-beta is chronically elevated [26-28]. This study suggest that SFA's increase synthesis and secretion of TRL associated amyloid-beta concomitant with deterioration in blood-brain barrier integrity [29]. Indeed, the hypothesis is supported by studies in transgenic mice that over-express amyloid-beta. In beta APP/presenilin 1 transgenic mice, the plasma concentration correlated with secretion rates into blood of TRL's, which was increased 3-8 fold above wild-type mice [27]. Moreover, there was a positive association between plasma TRL-amyloid-beta secretion with onset of cerebrovascular and parenchymal amyloidosis [29].

Conclusion
###end title 47
###begin p 48
In this study, evidence in vivo that amyloid-beta is secreted as a chylomicron complex and is stimulated by dietary SFA's is presented. Exploring this phenomenon in the context of plasma amyloid-beta homeostasis and lipoprotein kinetics may provide insight into the putative association of high-fat diet with AD risk.
