Introduction

###begin p 3
Metastasis is a complex process involving loss of adhesion, migration, invasion and proliferation of cancer cells. Cell adhesion molecules play a pivotal role in this phenomenon by regulating cell-cell and cell-matrix interactions. CD146 (MCAM) is associated with an advanced tumor stage in melanoma, prostate cancer and ovarian cancer. Studies of CD146 expression and function in breast cancer remain scarce except for a report concluding that CD146 could act as a tumor suppressor in breast carcinogenesis.

To resolve these apparent discrepancies in the role of CD146 in tumor cells, we looked at the association of CD146 expression with histoclinical features in human primary breast cancers using DNA and tissue microarrays. By flow cytometry, we characterized CD146 expression on different breast cancer cell lines. Using siRNA or shRNA technology, we studied functional consequences of CD146 downmodulation of MDA-MB-231 cells in migration assays. Wild-type, mock-transfected and downmodulated transfected cells were profiled using whole-genome DNA microarrays to identify genes whose expression was modified by CD146 downregulation.

Microarray studies revealed the association of higher levels of CD146 with histoclinical features that belong to the basal cluster of human tumors. Expression of CD146 protein on epithelial cells was detected in a small subset of cancers with histoclinical features of basal tumors. CD146+ cell lines displayed a mesenchymal phenotype. Downmodulation of CD146 expression in the MDA-MB-231 cell line resulted in downmodulation of vimentin, as well as of a set of genes that include both genes associated with a poor prognosis in a variety of cancers and genes known to promote cell motility. In vitro functional assays revealed decreased migration abilities associated with decreased CD146 expression.

Conclusions
###end title 8
###begin p 9
In addition to its expression in the vascular compartment, CD146 is expressed on a subset of epithelial cells in malignant breast. CD146 may directly or indirectly contribute to tumor aggressiveness by promoting malignant cell motility. Changes in molecular signatures following downmodulation of CD146 expression suggest that CD146 downmodulation is associated with the reversal of several biological characteristics associated with epithelial to mesenchymal transition, and the phenomenon associated with the metastatic process.

Metastasis is a complex process involving loss of adhesion, migration, invasion and proliferation of cancer cells that receive signals and interact with the extracellular matrix, neighboring cells and growth factors. Cell adhesion molecules play a pivotal role in metastasis by regulating cell-cell and cell-matrix interactions [1].

CD146 (or MCAM, Mel-CAM, MUC18, S-endo1) was first described on malignant melanomas [2]. CD146 is a 113 kDA membrane glycoprotein that belongs to the immunoglobulin superfamily. It contains five immunoglobulin-like domains, one transmembrane region and a short cytoplasmic tail. The presence of several protein kinase recognition motifs in the cytoplasmic domain suggests the involvement of CD146 in cell signaling [3]. CD146 mediates homotypic and heterotypic adhesion between cells, although the ligand or the counter receptor is not known [4]. CD146 is a component of the inter-endothelial junction [5], and is now recognized as a marker of mesenchymal cells [6]. Its role in endothelial development is suggested by studies in the zebra fish [7]. The direct or indirect role of CD146 in cell migration has been suggested by several observations [8]. A recent report supports the importance of CD146 as a marker of bone marrow stromal cells with the ability to transfer the hematopoietic microenvironment to heterotopic sites [9]. Finally, CD146 is expressed on a small subset of activated T cells [10].

CD146 is structurally related to gicerin, a molecule that promotes metastasis of lymphoma cells in chicken [11] and metastasis of mouse mammary carcinoma cells [12]. Forced expression of CD146 in nonmetastatic melanoma cell lines increases their metastatic ability in mouse models [13]. More recent reports indicate that CD146 is overexpressed on prostate cancer cells [14], and that CD146 overexpression increases metastasis of prostate cancer cells in nude mice [15]. CD146 is associated with advanced tumor stage in ovarian cancers and could be a poor-prognosis factor that predicts early tumor relapse [16]. In pulmonary adenocarcinomas, CD146 expression is associated with shorter patient survival [17].

Antibodies against CD146 inhibit tumor growth of different xenografted tumor models: melanoma [18] and leiomyosarcoma, pancreatic cancer or hepatocarcinoma [19]. More recently, vaccination against murine melanoma cells expressing CD146 was shown to protect mice from lethal doses of melanoma cells [20].

Studies of CD146 expression and function in breast cancer - the leading cause of cancer morbidity and mortality among women - remain scarce, and mostly focus on circulating endothelial cells [21] or on tumor neoangiogenesis [22]. A previous report demonstrated that CD146 is expressed on epithelial and myoepithelial cells, and on 100% of benign proliferative epithelial lesions of the breast, but in only 18% of breast carcinomas, leading to the conclusion that CD146 could act as a tumor suppressor in breast carcinogenesis [23].

To resolve these apparent discrepancies in the role of CD146 in various models of malignancies, we further investigated CD146 expression in malignant human breast tissues to determine whether CD146 was associated with any particular tumor subtype, or biological or clinical feature. Our data suggest a role for CD146 in cell motility and progression in breast cancers, consistent with its role in other malignancies.

Breast tumor specimens were obtained from consecutive cancer patients treated at our institution, following informed consent and a review of the protocol by the Institut Paoli-Calmettes Comite d'Orientation Strategique (Institutional Review Board). Histological types included ductal carcinomas, lobular, mixed, tubular, medullar and other types. The median age of patients was 59 years (range 24 to 94 years). Women were treated according to guidelines used in our institution: after surgery, 93% received locoregional radiotherapy, 51% received adjuvant chemotherapy (anthracyclin-based regimen in most cases) and 52% received adjuvant hormonotherapy (tamoxifen, most cases). Tumor tissues were obtained before the initiation of systemic therapy.

Tissue microarrays were prepared as described previously [24], and were evaluated by the mean score of a minimum two core biopsies for each case. Slides were evaluated under a light microscope by two independent observers on the Spot Browser device (Alphelys, Plaisir, France) and were rated by the quick score [25], except for the tyrosine kinase receptor ERBB2 status (HercepTest kit; Dako France S.A.S., Trappes, France). Internal positive controls such as epidermis or benign breast lobules were used. Estrogen receptor (ER) and progesterone receptor (PR) were considered positive when at least 1% of tumor cell nuclei were stained. ERBB2 staining was considered positive when limited to a membrane staining of more than 10% of tumor cells (scored as 1+, 2+ or 3+ according to intensity). Protein overexpression was considered for scores of 2+ and 3+. Epidermal growth factor receptor was scored positive if any membranous invasive carcinoma cell staining was observed. See Additional data file 1 for the mAbs used in the present study.

Expression data were analyzed by the Robust Multichip Average method in R using Bioconductor and associated packages [30]. A filtering process removed from the dataset the genes with low and poorly measured expression, retaining 18,041 probe sets. Supervised analysis compared expression profiles from the three control cell lines with those from the two experimental cell lines. In a first step, a Student's t test with false discovery rate correction retained probe sets differentially expressed between the two groups with a significance threshold of P < 0.05. In a second step, we measured for each significant probe set the fold change of mean expression levels between the control group and the experimental group. Results [GEO:GSE11951] were displayed simultaneously in a volcanoplot [31].

The study of 635 untreated primary breast tumors aggregated in two tissue microarrays revealed that 45 tumors (7%) were positive for CD146 staining in the epithelial compartment (Figure 1a,b). Most CD146-positive tumors were ductal carcinomas (78%). CD146 expression was strongly associated with high grade, with negativity for ER and PR, and with the triple-negative (ER-/PR-/ERBB2-) phenotype. Association with positivity for epithelial growth factor receptor, p53, P-cadherin and Moesin, together with negativity for GATA-3 and BCL2, indicated a pattern of basal tumors (Table 1) [33].

Analysis of our previously published gene expression data of 227 breast cancer samples profiled using oligonucleotide microarrays [34] also supported this conclusion: an expanded view of the hierarchical clustering of our tumor series showed that CD146 is included in a stromal gene cluster enriched in mesenchymal and vascular genes (see Additional data file 4), and is overexpressed in basal tumors as compared with luminal tumors (Figure 2). With the median expression level of the corresponding probe set across all tumors as the cutoff point for defining a rich or poor tumor for CD146, CD146-rich tumors were more frequently grade III, ER-negative or PR-negative, and displayed a basal phenotype in 41% of cases versus 22% for CD146-poor tumors (Table 1).

Kaplan-Meier analysis with a follow-up censored at 5 years indicated a statistically significant difference in the overall survival time between patients with positive and negative CD146 status, as assayed with immunohistochemistry on tissue microarrays (P = 0.0104, log-rank test; Figure 3a); after 5 years, survival rates no longer indicated a difference between the two subgroups. In triple-negative tumors there was a nonstatistically significant trend towards a shorter overall survival in CD146-positive tumors during the first 3 years (Figure 3b). An increased risk of death before 5 years is therefore associated with CD146 expression in the epithelial compartment of breast cancer tissues.

DNA microarray analyses of 34 mammary cell lines [34] show the strong expression of CD146 in MDA-MB-231 and Hs578T cell lines, and its low expression in MCF-7, ZR-75-30 and MDA-MB-453 cells. An expanded view of the hierarchical clustering shows that CD146 is included in a stromal/mesenchymal gene cluster, near the basal gene cluster, and is overexpressed in mesenchymal-like cell lines as compared with other cell lines (Figure 4).

We confirmed these results by flow cytometry analyses. Two subgroups of human mammary cancer cell lines were easily distinguishable on the basis of CD146 expression (Figure 5): MCF-7, ZR-75-30, BrCA-MZ-02, MDA-MB-453 and T47-D cell lines, which display epithelial characteristics, expressed CD146 at low levels (CD146-); and oppositely, MDA-MB-231, Hs578T, Sum159PT, MDA-MB-436 and BT-549 cell lines, which display mesenchymal characteristics, also expressed high levels of CD146 (CD146+). Of note, the T47D cell line was negative for CD146 protein expression while the mRNA was detected in microarray and RT-PCR analyses, thus suggesting the possibility of post-transductional regulation.

CD146 expression was downmodulated by transient transfection with siRNAs. The two most efficient siRNAs (si78 and si79) produced a significant reduction in the levels of CD146 mRNA and protein (Figure 6a,b) when compared with three control cell lines: the wild-type cell line, and two cell lines transfected with control siRNAs that respectively target green fluorescent protein or differ from si78 by four nucleotides in its sequence (si78mut).

The downregulation of CD146 expression was associated with reduced abilities to migrate in a transwell assay in response to 10% FCS when compared with wild-type cells or mock-transfected cells (Figure 6c). In addition, exposure of wild-type MDA-MB-231 cells to S-endo1 anti-CD146 mAb resulted in a decreased migration (n = 4; data not shown); in one additional experiment, the S-endo1 mAb had the same effect on the Sum159PT cell line (data not shown). Downmodulation of CD146 expression also resulted in a significant decrease of MDA-MB-231 transmigration through the established HBMEC human endothelial cell line (Figure 6d). Finally, MDA-MB-231 cells also displayed a reduced ability to heal a wound, following CD146 downmodulation (Figure 6e,f).

We generated two MDA-MB-231-derived cell lines (TI6194 and TI6196) that stably expressed 29mer shRNAs against CD146. Knockdown of CD146 was confirmed at the mRNA level using quantitative RT-PCR (see Figure S1a in Additional data file 5) and whole-genome DNA microarrays (Table 2). Phenotypic analysis of CD146 expression showed that the mean fluorescence intensity of CD146 was reduced more than 80%, the inhibition being greater in the TI6194 cell line (see Figure S1b in Additional data file 5). Empty plasmid or shRNA directed against green fluorescent protein did not affect CD146 expression. Migration in a transwell assay of TI6194 and TI6196 cells decreased accordingly (data not shown).

Wild-type, mock-transfected and TI6194 and TI6196 transfected cells were profiled using whole-genome DNA microarrays to identify genes whose expression was modified by CD146 downregulation. The results are shown in a volcano plot (see Additional data file 6). Supervised analysis using the t test revealed 363 probe sets differentially expressed (P < 0.05 with false discovery rate correction). Among these, 13 probe sets (Table 2) displayed a >/= 2-fold decrease associated with CD146 downregulation. These 13 probe sets represented seven unique genes including MCAM/CD146. With a less stringent cutoff value (>/= 1.5-fold change), 28 probe sets - representing 21 unique genes - were downregulated in the cell lines with CD146 inhibition (Table 2). Strikingly, no probe set was upregulated in these cell lines. Quantitative RT-PCR confirmed these results for 15 out of the 21 tested genes, failed for three genes, and did not identify any significant differential expression for three genes (Table 2).

To further explore mRNA expression changes related to the downmodulation in CD146, we used multiplex quantitative RT-PCR. We focused the analysis on the expression of 184 genes involved in migration, adhesion and cytoskeleton. The genes whose expression was significantly modulated in this screening belong to different protein families, including integrins (alpha2, alpha6, beta3, beta4 subunits), extracellular matrix or structural proteins, transcription factors, and molecules involved in signal transduction (Table 2). The expression of Vimentin, a mesenchymal marker (like fibronectin 1), was downregulated in the TI6194 cell line, which is the engineered MDA-MB-231 cell line with the lowest expression of CD146. Interestingly, the downregulation of CD146 expression was associated with a downregulation of the proto-oncogene VAV1, of CXCR4 (the receptor for CXCL12) and of the chemokine CCL5. Only few transcripts were upregulated: among these transcripts, DEF6, CXCL10 and BCL7A are associated with a lower tumorigenicity.

There was a good correlation between the results obtained with the two expression profiling approaches. Out of the 99 genes represented on multiplex plates and Affymetrix microarrays (among the 18,041 probe sets retained after the filtering step), 85 genes (86%) displayed concordant results according to the two approaches - whereas only 14 genes showed discordant results. This discordance may be related to the difference in sensitivity of the two techniques, as well as to different transcripts tested. The downregulation of transcripts for CXCR4, CD44, ICAM1 and integrin alpha6 was confirmed by cytometry analyses, and the upregulation of CXCL10 was confirmed using an antibody array (data not shown).

MCAM or CD146, a cell-cell or cell-matrix adhesion molecule, was first described in melanomas where a high level of CD146 expression is associated with a poor prognosis [35]. More recently, the high expression of CD146 has also been associated with metastatic progression in prostate cancer [14] and ovarian cancer [16]. A previous report supports a tumor suppressor role rather than a prometastatic role for CD146 in breast cancer pathogenesis [23].

Tissue microarray analysis indicates that only a small subset of human primary tumors expresses CD146 proteins in the epithelial compartment. CD146 expression correlates with a high tumor grade and triple-negative receptor status. A correlation was also observed with epithelial growth factor receptor, P-cadherin, p53, Moesin, Bcl2 and GATA3 expression. All of these characteristics are associated with the basal phenotype. In the present study of 635 breast tumors, CD146 expression is associated with a poor overall survival with a follow-up cutoff point at 5 years.

As revealed by DNA microarrays, CD146 belongs to a stromal/mesenchymal signature and is expressed in human mammary tumor cell lines that can be classified in the basal-B subtype [36]. Then, similarly to other tumor types, CD146 expression is associated with poor prognosis in breast cancers. A possible explanation for this association is the role of CD146 in cell motility. First, the correlation between CD146 expression and the presence of CD44+/CD24low cells in breast cancer cell lines (data not shown) is consistent with previous observations at the mRNA level in cell lines [36], and supports the hypothesis that CD146 expression may be associated with the metastatic potential of breast tumor cells [37].

Downmodulation of CD146 expression by siRNA or shRNA approaches in cell lines that spontaneously express a high level of CD146 mostly resulted in a decreased migration in three distinct assays, at least one of which involves heterotypic cell-cell interactions. These results in breast cancer are consistent with previously reported results for melanoma cells [38,39]. Although the exact function of CD146 on different cell types remains elusive, these observations - together with published results for lymphocytes [8] - reinforce the hypothesis that CD146 is an actor of cell migration. Witze and colleagues recently showed that CD146 is recruited with actin, myosin IIB and Frizzled into an intracellular structure, which accumulates at the cell periphery and is associated with membrane retraction in response to Wnt5a [39].

Changes in molecular signatures following downmodulation of CD146 expression support the contribution of indirect mechanisms in decreased migration abilities. A small subset of genes appeared to be mostly downmodulated. Some of these genes are obvious players in cell migration, including CD44 [40] and FPR1 [41]. Concomitantly with CD146 downmodulation, we observed a downmodulation of CXCR4 and CCL5. CXCR4 is known to be upregulated in breast tumors; neutralizing the interaction of CXCL12 with CXCR4 significantly reduces breast cancer cell metastases in vivo [42], as does the repression of CCL5 that has anti-migratory effects [43]. Overexpression of CCL5 in MDA-MB-231 cells enhances their metastatic potential [44].

Other modulated genes are involved in oncogenic processes: CYP1B1 is associated with adverse prognosis [45], and VAV1 is a known proto-oncogene. Among the few upregulated genes detected with quantitative RT-PCR, BCL7A has been classified as a tumor suppressor gene [46], while CXCL10 mediates a thymus-dependent antitumor response in vivo [47].

Downmodulation of CD146 induces the downmodulation of genes such as vimentin, fibronectin and thrombospondin, which are mesenchymal markers; it also induces downmodulation of LTBP1, a protein expressed in stromal cells that triggers the biological activity of tumor growth factor beta. Altogether, these observations suggest that CD146 downmodulation is associated with the reversal of several biological characteristics associated with an aggressive phenotype.

Conclusion
###end title 79
###begin p 80
We provide evidence that CD146 is involved in breast cancer cell line motility and is associated with the basal subtype of primary breast cancers. In this picture, CD146 appears as a prometastatic factor associated with poor-prognosis histoclinical features, rather than as a tumor suppressor gene. Because CD146 downmodulation is associated with the reversal of several biological characteristics leading to a less aggressive phenotype, treatments targeting CD146 could be considered in breast cancers as in other malignancies.
