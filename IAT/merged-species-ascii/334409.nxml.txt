The mouse Hox-2.5 gene containing a Drosophila Antennapedia-type homeobox sequence is expressed in a spatially and temporally restricted manner during embryogenesis. We found that the mouse embryonal carcinoma cell line P19 expresses Hox-2.5 during differentiation by the treatment with retinoic acid (RA). Expression of the Hox-2.5 gene was not detected in undifferentiated P19 cells, but detected 72 hours after treatment with RA. In order to analyze this inductive response, we first identified the Hox-2.5 transcription initiation site and a possible promoter region. Subsequently, we prepared constructs containing various Hox-2.5 DNA fragments fused to a firefly luciferase reporter gene and transfected these into undifferentiated or differentiating P19 cells. These studies have demonstrated that a region -279 to +15 with respect to the transcription initiation site has a differentiation-responsive promoter activity. Deletion analysis suggests that the sequences responsible for this induction are located in several distinct domains within the 294 bp promoter region. Two of the possible differentiation-responsive elements were identified by analysis of DNA-protein interactions, and in vivo competition assays lend support to the notion that these regions are involved in the differential expression of Hox-2.5 promoter activity.
