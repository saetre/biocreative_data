We have determined the nucleotide sequence of the crp gene of Escherichia coli K 12. From a lambda transducing phage, the crp region was subcloned into pBR322. The gene was localized on the cloned fragment by determining the length of deletions which affect its expression. Its nucleotide sequence was established by using the technique of Maxam and Gilbert. The deduced amino-acid sequence is in agreement with the previously published amino acid composition of the protein (1, 2). Analysis of the sequence confirms that the DNA binding domain is located in the C-terminal portion of the protein.
