Poly(A)-containing polyoma cytoplasmic RNA was hybridized with linear double-stranded polyoma DNA and RNA displacement loops (R-loops) were formed. The structures visualized in the electron microscope are consistent with the conclusion that there are at least three late polyoma specific RNAs and that the leader sequences at the 5' ends of these viral RNAs are not coded immediately adjacent to the bodies of the RNAs. Measurements carried out on the R-loop structures have provided the locations on the physical map of polyoma DNA, for the bodies and leaders of the RNAs and the length of the bodies, leaders and the corresponding intervening DNA sequences.
