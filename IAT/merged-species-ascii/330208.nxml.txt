The gene coding for H1 RNA, the RNA component of human RNase P, has been isolated and characterized from a human genomic DNA library. The sequence corresponding to the mature H1 RNA is almost identical to that previously identified using H1 RNA and a cDNA clone corresponding to it. The nucleotide sequence of the genomic clone contains an array of potential transcriptional control elements, some characteristic of transcription by RNA polymerase III and some characteristic of RNA polymerase II, as is also the case for U6 and certain other small stable RNAs. The transcription in vitro of the genomic clone shows that the gene is functional and is transcribed by RNA polymerase III. Southern hybridization analysis indicates that there is very likely only one copy of the gene for H1 RNA in the human genome.
