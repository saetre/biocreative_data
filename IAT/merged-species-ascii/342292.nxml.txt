The molecular cloning and nucleotide sequence analysis of adult chicken beta globin mRNA is reported. DNA sequences derived from in vitro transcrption of globin mRNA were purified and amplified as recombinant DNA using the plasmid pBR322. Sequence analysis of several clones coding for beta globin strongly suggests that transcription errors may be generated near the 5' end of transcripts in vitro by reverse transcription. The complete sequence of the longest beta globin insert containing 51 bases of the 5' untranslated region as well as the complete coding and 3' untranslated regions has been determined.
