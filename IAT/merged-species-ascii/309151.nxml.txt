The cDNA encoding adenovirus E1A enhancer-binding protein E1A-F was isolated by screening a HeLa cell lambda gt11 expression library for E1A-F site-specific DNA binding. One cDNA clone produced recombinant E1A-F protein with the same DNA binding specificity as that endogenous to HeLa cells. Sequence analysis of the cDNA showed homology with the ETS-domain, a region required for sequence-specific DNA binding and common to all ets oncogene members. Analysis of the longest cDNA revealed about a 94% identity in amino acids between human E1A-F and mouse PEA3 (polyomavirus enhancer activator 3), a recently characterized ets oncogene member. E1A-F was encoded by a 2.5kb mRNA in HeLa cells, which was found to increase during the early period of adenovirus infection. In contrast, ets-2 mRNA was significantly reduced in infected HeLa cells. The results indicate that E1A enhancer binding protein E1A-F is a member of the ets oncogene family and is probably a human homologue of mouse PEA3.
