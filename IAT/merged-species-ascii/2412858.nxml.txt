Open reading frame 58 (ORF58) of varicella-zoster virus (VZV) lies at the 3'end of the Unique long (UL) region and its functional is unknown. In order to clarify whether ORF58 is essential for the growth of VZV, we constructed a deletion mutant of ORF58 (pOka-BACDelta58) from the Oka parental genome cloned into a bacterial artificial chromosome (pOka-BAC).

The ORF58-deleted virus (rpOkaDelta58) was reconstituted from the pOka-BACDelta58 genome in MRC-5 cells, indicating that the ORF58 gene is non-essential for virus growth. Comparison of the growth rate of rpOkaDelta58 and recombinant wild-type virus by assessing plaque sizes revealed no significant differences between them both in MRC-5 cells and malignant melanoma cells.

Varicella-zoster virus (VZV) is a member of the herpesviridae family, and its primary infection causes varicella in children. VZV often persistently infects dorsal root ganglia (DRG) and is sometimes activated from a latent to lytic state, causing zoster in aged and immunosuppressed individuals [1]. The double-stranded VZV genome contains approximately 125 kbp with at least 71 open reading flames (ORFs) [2]. Although understanding VZV virulence and attenuation mechanisms requires study of the VZV-encoded genes, little has been reported on VZV genes compared with those of herpes simplex virus (HSV).

The ORF58 of VZV lies at the 3'end of the Unique long (UL) region and its function is unknown. Although ORF57, its neighboring gene, is dispensable in cell culture [3], there has been no report yet on ORF58. Therefore, to investigate the functional roles of this gene in VZV infection, we constructed an ORF58-deletion mutant of VZV, and analyzed its susceptibility in both MRC-5 cells and malignant melanoma cells.

We produced the deletion mutant of the ORF58 gene by using the BAC system [4]. The deletion mutant of the ORF58 gene (pOka-BACDelta58) was constructed by recombination in E. coli harboring pOka-BAC DNA [5] and pGETrec [6] with a fragment containing the kanamycin-resistance gene flanked by the 3'-UTR and 5'-UTR of the ORF58 gene. The pGETrec was kindly provided by Dr. Panayiotis A Ioannou. Thus, the ORF58 gene in the pOKa-BAC genome was replaced by the kanamycin-resistance gene (Fig. 1A, B, and 1C).

Construction of recombinant virus rpOkaDelta58. (A) The VZV genome consists of two unique regions (UL and US) and of inverted repeat sequences (IRL, IRS, and TRSs) flanking the US region. An enlarged section shows the analyzed portion of the genome, containing open reading frame (ORF) 56, 57, 58 and 59. ORFs are drawn as pointed rectangles. (B) A fragment consisting of the 3'UTR of ORF58, the kanamycin-resistance gene (kmr), and the 5'UTR of ORF58 was amplified by PCR and used for mutagenesis of an infectious full-length pOka genome in E. coli and named KmrDelta58. (C) The entire ORF58 gene was replaced by the kanamycin-resistance gene in E. coli. TRL, terminal repeat long; UL, unique long; IRL, internal repeat long; IRS, internal repeat short; Us, unique short; TRS, terminal repeat long.

The recombination was confirmed by Southern blotting using a fragment of the internal sequence of the ORF58 gene, the ORF62/71 gene, or the kanamycin-resistance gene as a probe (Fig. 2). As shown in Figure 2, the signal for the ORF 58 gene was detected in the pOka-BAC genome but not in the pOka-BACDelta58 genome. The signal for the ORF62/71 gene, used as a positive control, was detected in both genomes, and the signal for the kanamycin-resistance gene was detected in the pOka-BACDelta58 genome but not in the pOka-BAC genome. The recombination was also confirmed by PCR using primer pairs that annealed to the internal region of the kanamycin-resistance gene and the external region of ORF58 (data not shown). The results confirmed that the ORF58 gene was properly replaced by the kanamycin-resistant gene in the pOka genome.

We next examined whether the ORF58 gene was essential for the replication of VZV in MRC-5 cells. To reconstitute the virus from its genome, MRC-5 cells were transfected with pOka-BAC or pOka-BACDelta58 DNA (Fig. 3). At 4 days post-transfection, typical cytopathic effects (CPEs), which fluoresce under the exciting light, was observed in the MRC-5 cells transfected with the pOka-BACDelta58 DNA, as well as with the pOka-BAC DNA (Fig. 3), suggesting that the ORF58 gene is dispensable for viral replication in cell culture.

Next, to confirm that rpOkaDelta58-infected cells did not express the ORF58 gene, we performed RT-PCR using the cDNA from rpOka- and rpOkaDelta58-infected MRC-5 cells as a template. As shown in Figure 4, ORF58 cDNA was amplified from the rpOka-infected cells, but not from the pOkaDelta58-infected cells, indicating that the ORF58 gene product was not expressed in the rpOkaDelta58-infected cells. As positive controls, the ORF62/71 and GAPDH cDNAs were both amplified in both types of infected cells (Fig. 4).

Since the deletion mutant rpOkaDelta58 was able to be reconstituted, we next analyzed its ability to form plaques of rpOkaDelta58 with that of rpOka. Cell-free rpOka or rpOkaDelta58 virus was used to infect MRC-5 cells at approximately 50 PFU/well, and the resulting plaque sizes were compared (Fig. 5) at 10 days post infection (pi), after the infected cells were fixed and stained. As shown in Figure 5, no significant difference was observed between the plaque sizes resulting from infection with the two viruses (p > 0.05, Student's t-test).

In this study, the N terminus of ORF57 was deleted in the process of deleting ORF58, because the C terminus of ORF58 overlaps with the N terminus of ORF57. The ORF57 gene product has been shown to be expressed in the cytosol and to be dispensable for viral growth in cell culture [3]. Therefore, we were not concerned that any observed effects would reflect the loss of the ORF57 N-terminus.

In HSV-1 and HSV-2, UL3 is the positional homologue of ORF58. The UL3 gene product is a phosphoprotein that is localized to the cytoplasmic and nuclear portions of HSV-1-infected cells [19]. In HSV-2-infected cells, the UL3 gene product localizes to the nucleus at the early stage of infection [20]. Whether the ORF58 gene product possesses similar characteristics to UL3 remains unknown. Further study will be required to demonstrate the localization and possible role of the ORF58 gene product in VZV infection.

Construction and investigation of deletion mutants utilizing BAC system will make it easier to understand the virulence and attenuation mechanisms of VZV.

One mug of pOka-BAC or pOka-BACDelta58 genome was transfected into MRC-5 cells by electroporation using a Nucleofection unit (Amaxa biosystems). The cells were then cultured with MEM supplement with 10% FBS for 4 days. To remove BAC sequence, MRC-5 cells were first infected with a recombinant adenovirus, AxCANCre, which expresses the Cre recombinase (kindly provided by Dr. Yasushi Kawaguchi, University of Tokyo). Twenty-four hrs later, the cells were super-infected with the recombinant viruses obtained from pOka-BAC genome(rpOka-BAC) or pOka-BACDelta58 genome(rpOka-BACDelta58), and cultured until plaques without GFP appeared. The plaques without GFP were isolated using glass isolation cups and transferred onto newly prepared MRC-5 cells to obtain BAC-deleted viruses, rpOka or rpOkaDelta58. After several rounds of isolation, cell-free viruses were obtained by sonicating the rpOka or rpOkaDelta58-infected cells and stored at -80degreesC.

Genome DNA of pOka-BAC and rpOkaDelta58 were extracted from E. coli. One mug of both DNAs were digested with BamHI and loaded onto 0.5% agarose gel and electrophoresis was performed in 0.5 x TBE (44.5 mM Tris, 44.5 mM Borate, 1 mM EDTA). At 72 hour later, DNA fragments were transferred to Hybond N+ nylon membrane(GE healthcare) with 0.4 N NaOH followed by washing with 2 x SSC (300 mM NaCl, 30 mM Na3-citrate). Hybridization and detection were performed using ECL direct labeling and detection system (GE healthcare). Probes used to detect ORF58, ORF62 and kanamycin resistant gene were labeled using the system following manufacture's protocol. The primer pairs used to create probes were: ORF58, VZ58F (aggacacgatctaaagccgt) and VZ58R (tccgtaccgacggcattgct); ORF62/71, G62N4 (gatcaaagcttagcgcag) and G62R4 (cctatagcatggctccag); kanamycin-resistance gene, KMF (atgattgaacaagatggattg) and KMR (aagaaggcgatagaaggcgatg). The transferred membrane was treated with hybridization buffer for 2 hours at 42degreesC followed by hybridization with the labeled probes for 18 hours at 42degreesC following manufacture's protocol, then was washed with primary wash buffer (6 M urea, 0.4% SDS and 0.5 x SSC) for 4 times at 42degreesC followed by washing with secondary wash buffer (2 x SSC), and the signals were detected with ECL detection reagents (GE healthcare) followed by exposing to X-ray film.

VZV recombinants were assessed for the property of cell-to-cell spread by comparison of plaque sizes. Briefly, MRC-5 cells or MeWo cells were infected with approximately 50 PFU of cell-free viruses of rpOka or rpOkaDelta58, which was produced from pOka-BAC or pOka-BACDelta58 genome. The cells were cultured for 7 days at 37degreesC followed by stained with 1% crystal violet/70% ethanol. Plaque sizes were calculated with ImageJ software (NIH, USA).
