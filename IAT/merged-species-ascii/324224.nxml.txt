Of the three proteins, L5, L18 and L25, which bind to 5S RNA, the former two effect the interaction of 5S RNA with 23S RNA. We have used trypsin as a probe to investigate the roles of the proteins in this RNA-RNA assembly, with the following results: (1) In complexes with 5S RNA, the highly basic N-terminal region of L18 is accessible to trypsin. This accessibility is unaffected by L25. However, its presence is essential for stimulating L5 binding. (2) In 5S RNA-protein-23S RNA complexes proteins L5 and L18 are both strongly resistant to proteolysis. (3) No 5S RNA-23S RNA complex formation occurs in the presence of L5 and the C-terminal L18 fragment. Two possible models for the mechanism of RNA-RNA assembly are proposed.
