We have established a systematic screen for imprinted genes using a subtraction-hybridization method with day 8.5 fertilized and parthenogenetic embryos. Two novel imprinted genes, Peg1/Mest and Peg3, were identified previously by this method, along with the two known imprinted genes, Igf2 and Snrpn. Recently three additional candidate imprinted genes, Peg5-7 , were detected and Peg5 is analyzed further in this study. The cDNA sequence of Peg5 is identical to Neuronatin, a gene recently reported to be expressed mainly in the brain. Two novel spliced forms were detected with some additional sequence in the middle of the known Neuronatin sequences. All alternatively spliced forms of Peg5 were expressed only from the paternal allele, confirmed using DNA polymorphism in a subinterspecific cross. Peg5/Neuronatin maps to sub-distal Chr 2, proximal to the previously established imprinted region where imprinted genes cause abnormal shape and behavior in neonates.
