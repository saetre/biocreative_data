High malignancy and early metastasis are hallmarks of melanoma. Here, we report that the transcription factor Snail1 inhibits expression of the tumor suppressor CYLD in melanoma. As a direct consequence of CYLD repression, the protooncogene BCL-3 translocates into the nucleus and activates Cyclin D1 and N-cadherin promoters, resulting in proliferation and invasion of melanoma cells. Rescue of CYLD expression in melanoma cells reduced proliferation and invasion in vitro and tumor growth and metastasis in vivo. Analysis of a tissue microarray with primary melanomas from patients revealed an inverse correlation of Snail1 induction and loss of CYLD expression. Importantly, tumor thickness and progression-free and overall survival inversely correlated with CYLD expression. Our data suggest that Snail1-mediated suppression of CYLD plays a key role in melanoma malignancy.

Melanoma is the most aggressive form of skin cancer. Invasion of melanoma cells into the dermis and subsequent metastatic dissemination are hallmarks of melanoma progression (1). One of the earliest steps in melanoma development includes disruption of E-cadherin-mediated adhesive interactions between melanocytes and keratinocytes (2). This disruption is accompanied by increased expression of N-cadherin, which facilitates cluster formation and invasion of melanoma into the dermis (3-5).

The Snail1 transcription factors trigger epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and have been shown to be important markers for tumor progression and invasion (6-8). Although EMT was originally defined as the formation of mesenchymal cells with migratory and invasive properties from epithelia during development, there is also evidence that EMT plays a crucial role in tumor progression and metastasis (9). Snail1-induced EMT has been mainly attributed to the direct repression of E-cadherin transcription (for review see references [10, 11]). We have previously shown that Snail1 is highly up-regulated in melanoma cells (12). The signals responsible for Snail1 up-regulation in melanoma are unclear, although several mechanisms for the regulation of Snail1 expression in other cell types have been put forward. For example, in epithelial cells, Snail1 expression can be induced by TGF-beta, oncogenic Ras, or integrin-linked kinase (13-15).

CYLD was originally identified as a tumor suppressor that is mutated in familial cylindromatosis (Brooke-Spiegler syndrome), an autosomal-dominant predisposition to multiple tumors of skin appendages (16). CYLD contains a C-terminal ubiquitin C-terminal hydrolase domain, which enables it to act as a deubiquitination enzyme (17-19). CYLD was shown to remove ubiquitin chains from target proteins such as BCL-3, resulting in inhibition of nuclear translocation of BCL-3, association with NF-kappaB p50 and p52, and cell proliferation (20).

In this study, we identified a signaling pathway that promotes mitogenic and metastatic properties of melanoma by down-regulation of CYLD through the action of Snail1, whose expression is induced by BRAF-mediated activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK). Snail1-dependent inhibition of CYLD transcription results in stimulation of Cyclin D1 and N-cadherin expression in melanoma cells, leading to enhanced proliferation, migration, and invasiveness of melanoma cells in vitro, as well as tumor growth and metastasis in vivo. Importantly, in melanoma tissue, Snail1 induction correlated with the loss of CYLD expression, and both were linked to Clark level (tumor invasiveness) and tumor thickness. Increased Snail1 expression and reduced CLYD levels inversely correlated with progression-free and overall survival of patients. Together, these data suggest that Snail1-mediated suppression of CYLD plays a key role in melanoma malignancy and that CLYD represents a prognostic marker and potential therapeutic target of this highly aggressive tumor.

To get a first insight into the role of CYLD in malignant melanoma, we evaluated-CYLD expression in six different human melanoma cell lines, as well as in freshly isolated human melanoma cells. We found strong reduction of CYLD mRNA (Fig. 1 A) and protein (Fig. 1 B) levels when compared with normal human epidermal melanocytes (NHEMs). Also, in situ, primary melanomas and melanoma metastases displayed strongly down-regulated or absent CYLD mRNA (Fig. 1 C) and protein (Fig. 1 D). In contrast, melanocytes in normal epidermis displayed high CYLD expression, as confirmed by costaining for tyrosinase and CYLD and quantification of costaining (Fig. 1, E and F). Because mutations and promoter methylation of the CYLD gene could be excluded (unpublished data), we concluded that down-regulation of CYLD likely occurs at the transcriptional level.

Analysis of the CYLD promoter revealed three potential binding sites for the transcriptional repressor Snail1 (Fig. S1, available at ). We found that Snail1 messenger RNA (mRNA) was highly increased in melanoma cell lines compared with NHEM, an expression pattern that correlated inversely with CYLD (Fig. S2 A vs. Fig. 1 A). In contrast, expression of Snail2 (Snai2), a Snail1 homologue that has been shown to affect expression of several genes important for melanoma progression (21), in melanoma was similar or lower than in NHEM (Fig. S2 A).

Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays demonstrated Snail1 binding to the CYLD promoter in primary melanoma cells and the melanoma cell lines Mel Im and Mel Juso, but not in NHEM (Fig. 2 A). Furthermore, neither Snail2 nor Twist (another E-box binding factor associated with poor prognosis in melanoma [22]) bound to the CYLD promoter in ChIP assays (Fig. 2 A). Snail1 recruitment to the CYLD promoter was observed to the first E-box at position -19 to -14, which resembles the consensus Snail1 binding sequence (CAGGTG; Fig. S1), but not to E-box II (-382 to -377) or III (-429 to -424; unpublished data).

Snail1 inhibits transcriptional expression of CYLD in melanocytic cells. (A) Lysates from NHEMs, primary melanoma cells (MM1 and MM2), and melanoma cell lines (Mel Im, Mel Juso) were examined by ChIP assay using an anti-Snail1, anti-Twist, and anti-Snail2-specific antibody, respectively, as well as a PCR primer pair corresponding to the promoter of the CYLD gene. Recruitment to the CYLD promoter was only shown for Snail1. Snail1, Twist, Snail2, immunoprecipitation (IP) using specific antibodies; IgG, IP using negative control rabbit immunoglobulin; Input, 10% of the cell lysate used for the IP is shown. (B) Reporter assays revealing inducible CYLD promoter (-550 to -1 bp) activity in Mel Im cells after transient transfection with asSnail (asSnail), whereas transfection with Snail1 expression plasmid (Snail1) completely abrogated CYLD promoter activity compared with the control (pGL3). Mutation of the consensus Snail1 binding site (CYLD mut-19) led to strong promoter activity that was not affected by transfection with asSnail or Snail1. Data are given as mean +/- SEM. *, P < 0.05 compared with CYLD control. (C) Immunoblot analysis showing that CYLD protein is up-regulated in Mel Im cells after stable transfection with asSnail expression plasmids (clone 1 and clone 2; top) and after transient transduction with Snail1 siRNA nucleotides (siRNA Snail1) or scrambled siRNA control (siRNA control; bottom). Nontransduced Mel Im cells were used as control. (D) Quantitative RT-PCR analysis showing increased CYLD mRNA expression in three different melanoma cell lines (Mel Im, Mel Ei, and Mel Juso) and melanoma cells (MM1 and MM2) transiently transfected with asSnail expression plasmids compared with mock-transfected (pcDNA3) cells. Data are given as mean +/- SEM. *, P < 0.05. (E) Western blot analysis showing decreased CYLD protein expression in NHEM cells transiently transfected with Snail1 expression plasmids compared with mock-transfected (pcDNA3) or nontransfected (NHEM) cells. (F) ERK inhibition by treatment with MEK inhibitors PD98059 and UO126 significantly affects Snail1 and CYLD mRNA expression in Mel Im cells. JNK inhibition (SP600125) exhibits no effect compared with vehicle (DMSO) control. Data are given as mean +/- SEM. *, P < 0.05. ns, not significant, both compared with Control. (G) Quantitative RT-PCR revealing that inhibition of ERK by PD98059 or UO126 further induced CYLD expression in melanocytes. JNK inhibition (SP600125) exhibits no effect compared with vehicle (DMSO) control. Data are given as mean +/- SEM. *, P < 0.05. Experiments in A-G were repeated at least three times. (H) Detection of CYLD expression by Western blot analysis. Transfection of NHEMs with mutated BRAF (V600E) induced Snail1 protein expression and, consequently, CYLD protein suppression, whereas no changes were found after transfection of wild-type BRAF (wtBRAF). Experiments were repeated three times with cells from two different donors.

Reporter gene assays using the CYLD promoter (-550 to -1) revealed inducible activity in melanoma cells after transient transfection with an antisense Snail1 construct (as-Snail). Conversely, transient transfection of a Snail1 expression construct completely repressed CYLD promoter activity (Fig. 2 B). Mutation of the first E-box of the CYLD promoter at position -19 resulted in strong promoter activity in Mel Im cells, which was not affected by transient transfection with asSnail or Snail1 (Fig. 2 B). In contrast, mutations in E-box II or III of the CYLD promoter did not change the reporter activity (unpublished data).

To further assess the effect of Snail1 on CYLD expression in melanoma cells, we either stably transfected Mel Im cells with asSnail expression plasmids or depleted Snail1 with specific siRNAs, and found a strong up-regulation of CYLD protein (Fig. 2 C). Furthermore, transient expression of as-Snail expression plasmids was sufficient to induce CYLD expression in melanoma cell lines and primary human melanoma cells (Fig. 2 D and Fig. S2 B). Accordingly, transient transfection of NHEM with a Snail1 expression plasmid strongly inhibited CYLD expression (Fig. 2 E).

Snail1 transcription depends on ERK signaling in squamous cell carcinoma and epithelial cells (15, 23), and melanoma cells exhibit high ERK activity compared with NHEMs (24). Interestingly, we found that pharmacological inhibition of the ERK/mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascade induced an almost complete loss of Snail1 mRNA expression and significantly increased CYLD mRNA levels in melanoma cells (Fig. 2 F). In accordance, treatment of NHEM with ERK inhibitors to further reduce basal levels of ERK activity also increased expression of CYLD (Fig. 2 G).

As BRAF activity acts upstream of ERK, and V600E mutations of BRAF are common in melanoma development (in accordance to our finding that BRAF mutations are present in all melanoma cell lines used in this study [unpublished data]), we tested whether mutated BRAF can modulate CYLD regulation in NHEM. Transfection of NHEM with V600E BRAF resulted in up-regulation of Snail1 and down-regulation of CYLD expression levels (Fig. 2 H).

To assess the relevance of Snail1-mediated tumor progression in vivo, we used a xenograft tumor model. Mel Im asSnail clones formed significantly smaller tumors than Mel Im control cells when injected subcutaneously into nude mice. In contrast, CYLD siRNA reconstituted the diminished growth of Mel Im antisense Snail1 clones (Fig. 3 D). Histological analysis of tumors formed by Mel Im asSnail clones in nude mice revealed nodular growth (Fig. 3, E, I). In contrast, Mel Im asSnail clones transduced with siRNA against CYLD showed more diffuse infiltration of the surrounding tissue (Fig. 3, E, II).

We have shown in a previous study that BCL-3 associates with the NF-kappaB p50 or p52 subunits to enhance cell proliferation by activating the Cyclin D1 promoter in mouse keratinocytes (17). CYLD prevents nuclear accumulation of BCL-3 and hence reduces Cyclin D1 expression and proliferation of keratinocytes.

Next, we examined whether a similar mechanism operates in human melanoma cells. In contrast to NHEM, BCL-3 was primarily found in the nucleus of the melanoma cell lines (Fig. S4 A, available at ). Transduction with lentiviral vectors expressing CYLD prevented nuclear translocation of BCL-3 (Figs. S4, B and C), whereas a catalytically inactive mutant of CYLD (CYLD C/S) still binding to BCL-3 was unable to prevent nuclear translocation (Fig. S4, C and D).

To analyze whether CYLD is also regulating Cyclin D1 expression in melanoma cell lines, Mel Im and Mel Juso cells were transduced with viral vectors carrying CYLD. Clones expressing CYLD at similar levels as NHEMs were used as demonstrated by Western blot analysis (Fig. 4 A). In agreement with the mechanism in keratinocytes (17), CYLD markedly reduced expression of Cyclin D1 (Fig. 4 B), cyclin D1 promoter activity (Fig. 4 C), and BCL-3 recruitment to the cyclin D1 promoter in a complex with p50 or p52 (Fig. 4 D, left) as compared with cells transduced with viral vectors carrying a catalytically inactive mutant of CYLD (C/S-CYLD), a GFP expression cassette or noninfected cells.

Because melanoma cells with BRAF V600E mutation exhibit an increased production of the immunosuppressive IL-10 (25), and the production of IL-10 is reduced in BCL-3-null cells (26), we further analyzed BCL-3 binding to the IL-10 promoter. CYLD, but not C/S-CYLD, abrogated BCL-3 binding of IL-10 promoter, confirming the important role of CYLD in the regulation of BCL-3 (Fig. S4 E).

In addition to uncontrolled proliferation, malignant melanoma is characterized by early invasiveness and metastasis. One of the hallmarks of the increased migratory and invasive potential of malignant melanoma cells is the expression of N-cadherin (2-4). Interestingly, the N-cadherin gene contains NF-kappaB binding sites in its promoter region (27). ChIP analysis revealed DNA-bound BCL-3 in a complex with p50 or p52 in control cells, and CYLD C/S- or GFP-expressing cells, whereas CYLD-expressing cells showed no BCL-3 recruitment to the NF-kappaB binding sites of the N-cadherin promoter (Fig. 4 D, right).

In line with these findings, expression of CYLD in melanoma cells strongly reduced N-cadherin promoter activity (Fig. 4 E) and protein levels (Fig. 4 F), whereas no effects on Snail1, Snail2, Twist, or E-cadherin expression (Fig. 4 F) were found compared with GFP- or CYLD C/S-transduced controls, respectively. In agreement, down-regulation of CYLD in asSnail clones 1 and 2 resulted in up-regulation of Cyclin D1 and N-cadherin (Fig. 3 A).

Furthermore, siRNA against Snail1, which up-regulated CYLD expression (Fig. 4 H), reduced nuclear BCL-3 levels, confirming that reexpression of CYLD blocks nuclear translocation of BCL-3 in melanoma (Fig. 4 H).

To investigate the functional role of the suppressive effect of CYLD on Cyclin D1 and N-cadherin, we used the two different melanoma cell lines (Mel Im and Mel Juso) stably expressing CYLD (Fig. 4 A). CYLD expression caused diminished proliferation in Mel Im cells (Fig. 5 A) and Mel Juso cells (Fig. S5 A, available at ), as well as a decrease in colony growth in soft agar in both cell lines (Fig. 5 B and Fig. S5 B) compared with control, GFP, or CYLD C/S-infected cells.

To analyze the clinical relevance of reduced CYLD expression in melanoma, we performed immunohistochemical analysis of a tissue microarray consisting of 88 primary human melanomas (Fig. 7 E) and found a significant correlation between loss of CYLD expression and Clark level/tumor invasiveness and tumor thickness (Table I). Moreover, loss of CYLD expression inversely correlated with overall (Fig. 7 A) and progression-free survival (Fig. 7 B). In contrast, patients with primary tumors expressing CYLD developed no tractable metastasis in the time period analyzed.

Notably, and in accordance with the Snail1-CYLD connection described here, expression of Snail1 was inversely correlated to CYLD expression in primary tumors (P < 0.001; Fig. 7, E and F). In compliance, Snail1 expression also correlated with tumor thickness (Table I) and overall (Fig. 7 C) and progression-free survival (Fig. 7 D).

These clinical findings support a link between the known tumor promoter Snail1 and its transcriptional target CYLD, indicating an important role for Snail1 to suppress CYLD during progression of melanoma and for CYLD to suppress melanoma cell proliferation and invasion.

The currently available adjuvant therapies for human melanoma have only limited effects on overall survival and can have severe side effects (for review see reference [29]). This highlights the strong need for rational, mechanism-based therapies. One approach with great potential for achieving this goal is the identification and targeting of tumor-activated signaling cascades.

Our study uncovers a new key signaling pathway that is responsible for progression of malignant melanoma and is related to poor prognosis in melanoma patients. This novel molecular mechanism is based on the suppression of CYLD expression by the transcriptional regulator, Snail1, driving melanoma cells to an aggressive phenotype (depicted as a model in Fig. 8).

Model of the regulation of Snail and how Snail affects proliferation, as well as migration and invasion, via suppression of CYLD. In melanoma cells, constitutively high ERK-activity (potentially caused by B-Raf mutations) leads to high Snail1 expression, which in turn causes strong suppression of CYLD. The repression of CYLD allows nuclear translocation of Bcl-3 and recruitment to the NF-kappaB binding sites of the Cyclin D1 and N-cadherin promoter. Activation of Cyclin D1 and N-cadherin leads to an increased proliferation rate of melanoma cells and contributes to progression and metastasis of tumors.

Notably, our findings reveal a thus far unknown link between Snail1, which plays an important role in EMT and favors tumor progression (9, 11), and CYLD. CYLD was originally identified as a tumor suppressor that is mutated in familial cylindromatosis (16). In melanoma, we did not find mutations of the CYLD gene (unpublished data), but we identified direct recruitment of the transcriptional repressor Snail1 to the CYLD promoter as a molecular mechanism leading to strongly reduced or even absent CYLD expression in all melanoma tissues and cell lines tested. In accordance, melanoma cells in which Snail1 expression was abrogated showed a strong up-regulation of CYLD and reduced growth in vitro and in vivo.

Interestingly, we found that ERK activation is the major upstream signaling mechanism responsible for high constitutive Snail1 expression in malignant melanoma cells, as well as for induced Snail1 expression in normal melanocytes. In melanoma cells, the Ras-Raf-MEK-ERK (MAPK) signaling pathway is constitutively active and exerts key functions in melanoma development and progression (30). Activating mutations in BRAF or N-ras have been identified in most cutaneous melanomas (31), corresponding to our finding that BRAF mutations were present in all melanoma cell lines tested, but not in primary human melanocytes.
###end p 66
###begin p 67
In contrast to melanoma cells, melanocytes express CYLD at a high level, exhibit low ERK activity, and lack Snail1 expression. Introducing mutated BRAF into primary melanocytes resulted in increased Snail1 expression and reduced CYLD expression. Our findings indicate that after malignant transformation, constitutively high ERK activity and Snail1 expression allow melanoma cells to permanently exploit transcriptional repression of CYLD and activation of BCL-3 to acquire a more aggressive phenotype.

BRAF V600E mutation has been shown to induce NF-kappaB activity in human melanoma cell lines via regulation of beta-Trcp expression (32), and high NF-kappaB activity resulting in increased tumorigenesis has been reported in malignant melanoma (32-34). Here, we provide a new mechanism for how mutational activation of B-RAF contributes to both constitutive NF-kappaB and BCL-3 activity via repression of CYLD.

Loss of CYLD promoted BCL-3 recruitment to the Cyclin D1 promoter. This mechanism plays an important role for the growth of melanoma cells because stable expression of CYLD in melanoma cells reduced tumor growth and metastasis in vivo in a xenograft model. More importantly, we showed for the first time that BCL-3 is recruited to the N-cadherin promoter to activate transcription. Thereby, our study provides a novel paradigm of how CYLD affects N-cadherin expression, which has been shown to correlate with tumor cell motility and invasiveness in several malignancies including melanoma (2, 12, 33). Re-expression of CYLD in melanoma cells with constitutively high Snail1 levels inhibited N-cadherin expression, leading to a reduced migratory and invasive potential in vitro and less pulmonary metastasis in a murine in vivo model. Conversely, depletion of CYLD in Snail1-deficient melanoma cells resulted in highly aggressive melanoma cells with strong proliferative and invasive potential. In summary, these findings clearly demonstrate that suppression of CYLD is a central mechanism in how Snail1 facilitates both growth and metastasis in malignant melanoma. Whether this mechanism operates in other types of cancer has to be tested.

Importantly, the clinical findings further support an important role of the Snail1 CYLD pathway in tumor progression and survival in melanoma patients. Snail1 expression shows significant correlation with loss of CYLD and signs of tumor progression like tumor thickness. Even more important, both Snail1 and CYLD expression in primary tumors directly correlate with progression-free survival and overall survival of the patients.

Hence, elevated expression of Snail1 and reduced expression of CYLD in primary melanoma hint to a high metastatic potential in vivo. Although CYLD levels in primary tumor and melanoma might vary, our findings indicate the intriguing possibility that analysis of CYLD and Snail1 protein expression in the primary tumor may be used as a predictive marker for survival of melanoma patients. Such prognostic risk assessment would have major clinical implications for the appropriate selection of treatment modalities and follow up protocols, or as stratification factor for adjuvant therapy.

Finally, our data also suggest a rationale for strategies to rescue CYLD expression in malignant melanoma as therapeutic approaches for this highly aggressive tumor.

Values are presented as means +/- SEM. Statistical differences were determined using Student's t test. Contingency table analysis and two-sided Fisher's exact tests were used to study the statistical association between categorical clinicopathologic and immunohistochemical variables. Retrospective overall survival and progression-free survival curves comparing patients with and without any of the variables were calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method, with significance evaluated using log-rank statistics. For the progression-free survival analysis, patients were censored at the time of their last tumor-free clinical follow-up appointment. For the overall survival analysis, patients were censored at the time of their last clinical follow-up appointment. Median overall survival time for censored patients was 63.5 mo (range, 3-135 mo). P < 0.05 was considered significant. Statistical analyses were performed using SPSS version 10.0 (SPSS, Inc.).
