The Escherichia coli RuvC protein is an endonuclease that resolves Holliday junctions. In vitro, the protein shows efficient structure-specific binding of Holliday junctions, yet the rate of junction resolution is remarkably low. We have mapped the sites of cleavage on a synthetic junction through which a crossover can branch migrate through 26 bp and find that > or = 90% of the junctions were cleaved at one site. This observation of sequence-specific cleavage suggests that inefficient resolution may be due to DNA binding events which occur away from the cleavage site and are therefore non-productive. Holliday junction resolution by RuvC protein can be stimulated by a number of factors including: (i) the presence of Mn2+ (rather than Mg2+) as the divalent metal cofactor, (ii) alkaline pH (< or = 10), and (iii) elevated temperature. These observations may indicate that other proteins are required for efficient RuvC-mediated resolution.
