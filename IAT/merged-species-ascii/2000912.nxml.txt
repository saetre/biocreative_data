CD8alpha enhances the responses of antigen-specific CTL activated through TCR through binding MHC class I, favoring lipid raft partitioning of TCR, and inducing intracellular signaling. CD8alpha is also found on dendritic cells and rat macrophages, but whether CD8alpha enhances responses of a partner receptor, like TCR, to activate these cells is not known. TCR and FcR, use analogous or occasionally interchangeable signaling mechanisms suggesting the possibility that CD8alpha co-activates FcR responses. Interestingly, CD8alpha+ monocytes are often associated with rat models of disease involving immune-complex deposition and FcR-mediated pathology, such as arthritis, glomerulonephritis, ischaemia, and tumors. While rat macrophages have been shown to express CD8alpha evidence for CD8alpha expression by mouse or human monocytes or macrophages was incomplete.

We detected CD8alpha, but not CD8beta on human monocytes and the monocytic cell line THP-1 by flow cytometry. Reactivity of anti-CD8alpha mAb with monocytes is at least partly independent of FcR as anti-CD8alpha mAb detect CD8alpha by western blot and inhibit binding of MHC class I tetramers. CD8alpha mRNA is also found in monocytes and THP-1 suggesting CD8alpha is synthesized by monocytes and not acquired from other CD8alpha+ cell types. Interestingly, CD8alpha from monocytes and blood T cells presented distinguishable patterns by 2-D electrophoresis. Anti-CD8alpha mAb alone did not activate monocyte TNF release. In comparison, TNF release by human monocytes stimulated in a FcR-dependent manner with immune-complexes was enhanced by inclusion of anti-CD8alpha mAb in immune-complexes.

Human monocytes express CD8alpha. Co-engagement of CD8alpha and FcR enhances monocyte TNF release, suggesting FcR may be a novel partner receptor for CD8alpha on innate immune cells.

CD8alpha is a surface glycoprotein typically found on a subpopulation of CTL [1]. CD8alpha enhances responses instigated through the TCR by binding MHC class I and signaling through the src kinase lck and the adaptor protein Linker for Activation of T cells (LAT) [2]. The classical co-receptor model of CD8 suggests CD8 enhances CTL activation by binding the same MHC class I-peptide as TCR [3]. Other evidence suggests CD8 is recruited to the site of T cell activation [4,5]. and can enhance T cell responses even when it does not bind at detectable levels to the same MHC class I-peptide as TCR (e.g. CD8 enhances activation of T cells with an MHC class II specific TCR [6,7]).

CD8 on T cells co-activates responses initiated by TCR, but no such co-activating role has been described for CD8 on other CD8+ cells like dendritic cells [8], NK cells [9,10]., mast cells [11] or macrophages (Mphi) [12]. Interestingly, the Fcgamma chain, a component of several FcR [13], NK receptors [14], and ILT1 [15] can substitute for CD3zeta in TCR expression [16,17].; signaling [18] and T cell activation [19,20] Reciprocally, CD3zeta can substitute for Fcgamma in FcR signaling [21]. Fcgamma chain is an ancestral homologue of the CD3zeta chain [22]. Furthermore, CD3zeta-/-eta-/- mice use Fcgamma in TCR signaling and CD8-dependent CTL cytotoxicity [19], strongly suggesting CD8 can function with Fcgamma in the absence of CD3zeta or eta. In fact, human but not mouse mature T cells often express Syk and Fcgamma alongside ZAP-70 and CD3zeta and in at least some mature effector T cells Syk and Fcgamma replace ZAP-70 and CD3zeta in TCR signaling [23,24]

The cell types that express CD8alpha differ among mice, rats and humans. While human [9] and rat NK cells express CD8alpha, mouse NK cells do not [25]. Rat Mphi express CD8alpha [12], however, our efforts and those of others to detect CD8alpha protein on mouse monocytes and Mphi have been unsuccessful [26,27]. A portion of CD8alpha and all the CD8beta found on mouse dendritic cells is derived from T cells [28]. As transfer of transmembrane proteins between cells is frequently detected, like CD8 in the case above, it is necessary to determine the source and functionality of CD8alpha when it is detected on a new cell type or in a new species. Since this study was started, two studies identified binding of anti-CD8alpha mAb at high levels to a small percentage of human monocytes during immune responses [29,30] Unfortunately neither study queried whether lower levels of CD8alpha were constitutively found on monocytes, demonstrated the cellular origin of the CD8alpha found on monocytes, or demonstrated a function for CD8alpha on monocytes.

Performing flow cytometry on PBMC, a subpopulation of lymphocytes (FSC/SSC gated) expressed high levels of CD8alpha and CD8beta, as expected (Figure 1B, anti-CD8alpha mAb OKT8 and Figure 1C, anti-CD8beta-dependent mAb 2ST8.5H7). Six anti-CD8alpha mAb also bound monocytes at levels greater than three times the geometric mean of isotype mAb (Figure 1B, gated for analysis by expression of high levels of CD14 [31] and characteristic FSC/SSC scatter [Figure 1A]). The monocytic cell line THP-1 bound CD8alpha mAb at levels comparable to blood monocytes (data not shown). CD8beta was not detected on monocytes with mAb 2ST8.5H7 (Figure 1C) or 5F2 (not shown), suggesting they do not express CD8alphabeta (mAb 2ST8.5H7) or putative CD8betabeta dimers (mAb 5F2) [32]. Accordingly, mRNA for CD8beta was detected in total PBMC containing CD8alphabeta+ T cells, but not in highly enriched monocytes (data not shown).

CD8alpha is detected by flow cytometry on CD14hi monocytes from human peripheral blood. Anti-CD8alpha mAb bind monocytes by flow cytometry. A, Monocytes were gated by characteristic FSC/SSC scatter (left panel) and expression of high levels of CD14 (right panel) for all flow cytometry studies in this article. B, A population of lymphocytes, gated by characteristic FSC/SSC scatter, bind high levels of anti-CD8alpha. Blood monocytes gated in A, bind anti-CD8alpha mAb. Geometric means of monoclonal antibody binding are shown. Results are representative of five experiments. C, Anti-CD8beta mAb bind lymphocytes but not monocytes.

To examine whether Fc receptors contributed to binding of anti-CD8alpha mAb to monocytes we first tested the contribution of CD64, the high affinity FcR. CD64 binds immunoglobulin with 100-fold or more the affinity of other FcgammaR [33], is the only FcgammaR that binds monomeric Ig [34] and preferentially binds mouse IgG2a antibodies compared to mouse IgG1 [35]. Accordingly, as human monocytes express significant amounts of CD64 [31] mouse IgG2a has a 100-1000 fold higher affinity for binding human monocytes than mouse IgG1 [36]. Incubating monocytes with human Ig preparations [37] (not shown) or a mAb which blocks binding of Ig to CD64 (clone 10.1) [38] slightly decreased binding of IgG2a isotype control mAb (11-27% geometric mean) and did not decrease binding of anti-CD8alpha mAb (Figure 2A).

To test whether CD8alpha is detected in human monocytes by a method generally acknowledged to be independent of FcgammaR binding to IgG we performed western blot for CD8alpha. Proteins at 32 kDa, consistent with CD8alpha were detected with anti-CD8alpha mAb D9 by western blot (Figure 2B) of thymus lysate, blood lymphocytes, immature monocytes (THP-1), mature ex vivo monocytes (>99% CD14hi, CD3zeta[-ve], enrichment Figure 4A), and Mphi differentiated with GM-CSF from blood monocytes, but not in lung epithelial cells (A549, negative control). Similarly, a 32 kDa protein was found by western blot with anti-CD8alpha mAb B9.11 in PBMC and THP-1 (Figure 2B). These data suggest that anti-CD8alpha mAb binding to monocytes is due to the presence of CD8alpha protein and not non-specific binding to FcgammaR.

Human monocytes express CD8alpha mRNA. Right, purification of monocytes (>99% CD14hi after sorting) was also confirmed by attempting to detect the T and NK cell transcript, CD3zeta, in monocytes. A 293 bp fragment of CD3zeta mRNA was detected in PBMC, containing T cells, but not monocytes, the monocytic line THP-1, or lung epithelial cells (A549) after 50 cycles. B, A 379 bp CD8alpha mRNA fragment was detected by RT-PCR in THP-1, >99% CD14hi monocytes, PBMC, but not in a lung epithelial cell line, (A549) using intron-spanning primers, and 35 cycles of cDNA amplification. Detection of beta-actin mRNA confirmed RNA extraction and RT-PCR was performed successfully.

To confirm the expected localization of CD8alpha to the cell periphery on monocytes we performed two-color confocal microscopy of permeabilized PBMC (Figure 3). All anti-CD8alpha mAb detected CD8alpha at the periphery of CD14hi monocytes and some CD3hi T cells (Figure 3B-E mAb B9.11 is shown, and is representative of results obtained with LT8, OKT8, 32-M4, 51.1, and Nu-Ts/c). CD8alpha was also observed intracellularly in some monocytes with a distribution resembling CD14, suggesting that similar to NK cells [39] a small proportion of CD8alpha may be found intracellularly in monocytes, perhaps in recycling endosomes.

The monocytic cell line THP-1 must synthesize CD8alpha as no other sources of CD8alpha are available (FBS was CD8alpha negative by parallel western blot). In contrast ex vivo monocytes may acquire CD8alpha from other CD8alpha+ cells in the body. The presence of CD8alpha mRNA would suggest that monocytes can synthesize the CD8alpha protein associated with them. Due to the sensitivity of RT-PCR for mRNA from contaminating cells, we studied the cultured monocytic line THP-1 in addition to highly enriched monocytes (negative for T cell/NK cell specific CD3zeta mRNA, >99% FSC/SSC and CD14hi monocytes, Figure 4A). CD8alpha mRNA was detected in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (containing CD8alpha+ T cells [positive control]), THP-1 monocytic cell line, and highly purified blood monocytes, but not in a lung epithelial cell line (A549) as expected (Figure 4B).

Whatever the eventual cellular derivation of CD8alpha protein found on ex vivo monocytes, its ability to function (e.g. bind MHC class I) and impact monocyte responses is practically relevant. We tested whether CD8alpha on human monocytes contributes to monocyte binding to MHC class I. We expected that anti-CD8alpha mAb would not block all tetramer binding to human monocytes because members of the immunoglobulin-like-transcript (ILT/CD85) family (ILT2, 4) expressed by monocytes bind MHC class I tetramers, interact with regions on MHC class I that overlap with CD8alpha and thus compete with CD8alpha for binding of MHC class I [40].

Thymocytes from CD8beta knockout mice bind MHC class I tetramers and overexpression of CD8alpha enhances this CD8-dependent binding [41], suggesting that despite the heightened ability of CD8alphabeta (at least in an unsialylated form on thymocytes [42,43]) to bind MHC class I tetramers, CD8alphaalpha is also capable of mediating tetramer binding to T cells.

HLA-*0201 tetramers bound to nearly all CD14hi monocytes (Fig 5A). Tetramers complexed with two different peptides bound similarly to monocytes (data not shown). In agreement with others [44,45]., we found that anti-CD8alpha clone B9.11 inhibited HLA tetramer binding (Figure 5B, 11.6%). Another anti-CD8alpha clone, D9, also inhibited tetramer binding (Figure 5B, 18.6%, p < 0.05). Finally, tetramer binding was not affected by clone 32-M4 (despite its ability to bind CD8alpha on monocytes), or isotype control mAb (Figure 5B). Other studies of MHC class I tetramer binding to CD8alpha using several anti-CD8alpha mAb have also shown that tetramer binding may be unaffected, inhibited or enhanced by anti-CD8alpha mAb, depending on which anti-CD8alpha clone is used, and TCR affinity [43,46,47].

Previous publications have demonstrated notable differences in immunoprecipitated CD8alpha by 2-D electrophoresis. Some authors detected immunoprecipitated CD8alpha from thymus as restricted spots of pI ~ 6 [48]. In contrast, others detected immunoprecipitated CD8alpha from blood at numerous spots ranging from pI 6-9.5 [49], and molecular weights of 32 to 34 kDa [50]. We tested whether CD8alpha from monocytes in comparison to blood lymphocytes exhibit a distinct pattern of sialylation or other post-translational pattern detectable by 2-D electrophoresis.

A polyclonal anti-CD8alpha antibody detected discrete spots across 2-D gels from the predicted pI of unglycosylated CD8alpha (~9) to pI 6-7, at Mr from 32-34 kDa (Figure 5), as shown by others [49]. Much of the heterogeneity detected with anti-CD8alpha polyclonal antibody could be eliminated by treatment with neuraminidase, suggesting it is due to sialylation of CD8alpha (Figure 6A). Notably, monocytes had less of the sialylated 34 kDa forms of CD8alpha than T cells in samples from three individuals (Figure 6A). In contrast, anti-CD8alpha clone D9 detected a single protein spot (32 kDa, ~pI 6), in a pattern similar to that found by others [48]. To confirm that the protein recognized at 32 kDa pI 6 was CD8alpha we sequenced it by MALDI-QTOF from 2-D gels (see Additional file 1). Neuraminidase treatment diminished but did not eliminate the protein spot recognized by anti-CD8alpha clone D9 and gave rise to faint basic spots similar to those observed with polyclonal anti-CD8alpha antibody after neuraminidase treatment. D9 may preferentially recognize particular glycosylation/sialylation patterns of CD8alpha (Figure 6B,C).

In our experiments large differences in 2-D electrophoresis patterns for CD8alpha (e.g. between D9 and polyclonal anti-CD8alpha Ab) are due to the specificity of different antibodies recognizing CD8alpha, and not a result of differences in the cell type expressing CD8alpha. Nonetheless, using the same polyclonal antibody, subtle differences in CD8alpha were found between monocytes and lymphocytes by 2-D electrophoresis.

We investigated if CD8alpha on monocytes might be involved in responses to immune-complexes mediated by FcgammaR. To this end, we used a common immune-complex-FcgammaR activation system.

Treatment of monocytes with monomeric non-specific IgG2a mAb induced a slight increase in monocyte TNF production (Figure 7A,B). This is likely due to the ability of the high affinity FcgammaR, CD64, found on the majority of monocytes to bind monomeric mouse IgG2a [36]. Monomeric anti-CD8alpha mAb did not increase monocyte TNF production more than control IgG2a mAb (Figure 7A,B). When monocytes were stimulated with preformed immune-complexes (isotype mAb cross-linked with anti-mouse Ig), CD14hi monocytes produced moderate amounts of intracellular TNF (Figure 7A,B). Formation of immune-complexes with anti-CD8alpha mAb (32-M4 cross-linked with anti-mouse Ig) rather than isotype mAb, resulted in production of 2-fold more TNF by monocytes (Figure 7A,B). Immune-complexes containing anti-CD8alpha mAb D9 did not significantly increase monocyte TNF production above control immune-complexes, indicating that monocyte TNF release is not significantly stimulated by any immune-complex containing a mAb that binds to the monocyte surface. It is not surprising that only one of two anti-CD8alpha mAb enhanced FcgammaR-dependent responses, because when others have screened several anti-CD8alpha mAb in parallel for effects on CTL cytotoxicity, or CD8-MHC class I binding (see above), the effect ranged from substantial inhibition to no effect depending on the particular anti-CD8alpha mAb clone [51-53]

Blockade of FcR with excess Fc fragments nullified TNF release instigated by isotype and anti-CD8alpha immune-complexes (Figure 7), suggesting the immune-complex system used is FcgammaR-dependent, as expected. As CD8alpha enhancement of TNF production is inhibited by Fc fragments and does not occur with monomeric anti-CD8alpha mAb, the ability of anti-CD8alpha mAb to enhance responses of human monocytes appears to depend on co-engagement of FcR.

Previous to the present study no evidence existed to demonstrate that human monocytes synthesized CD8alpha. Human PBMC can appear CD14+/CD8alphahi in HIV infected individuals, but this population is due to acquisition of CD14 from monocytes, by T cells, that are mostly CD8alpha+ [54,55]. A similar effect may explain previous claims of CD8alpha on monocytes subsequent to dengue virus infection [30]. Other studies have demonstrated that macrophages and dendritic cells can acquire CD8alpha from T cells, without themselves synthesizing it [28]. Thus, the detection of CD8alpha protein on monocytes in other studies [29] does not demonstrate that CD8alpha is expressed by, or more importantly, functional on monocytes.

We provide strong evidence that human monocytes constitutively express CD8alpha at low levels. Notably, CD8alpha was observed in monocytes, and the monocytic cell line THP-1 by western blot confirming the presence of CD8alpha in these cells without possible contribution of FcgammaR. Moreover, detection of CD8alpha mRNA in THP-1, CD8alpha protein on THP-1 and 32 kDa CD8alpha in lysate of continuously cultured THP-1, demonstrates that these monocytic cells must transcribe CD8alpha mRNA and translate CD8alpha protein.

We find that monocytes have less 34 kDa sialylated forms of CD8alpha compared to T cells. The Mr difference between 32 and 34 kDa forms of CD8alpha may be due to glycosylation other than sialylation [50] (Figure 5), or palmitoylation of CD8alpha)[56] at three eligible membrane-proximal cysteines [57]. Monocytes and T cells may express different glycosylation or palmitoylation enzymes that account for predominant accumulation of 32 or 34 kDa CD8alpha. Phosphorylation of CD8alpha, or oxidation of the free cysteine in the CD8alpha Ig-domain may explain pI differences of CD8alpha remaining after neuraminidase treatment. Sialylation of CD8alpha [58], like CD8beta [42], changes during T cell development, and potentially upon T cell activation. Differential sialylation and palmitoylation of CD8 are known to modulate its ability to bind MHC class I and induce T cell activation [42,43,59] Unfortunately, we cannot relate the differences in CD8alpha we observe between monocytes and T cells to their comparative ability to bind MHC class I and co-activate signaling.

The ability of CD8 to enhance T cell responses in a TCR-dependent manner was defined over twenty years ago. Since then, CD8alpha expression by several cell types that lack the TCR such as human NK cells [9], dendritic cells [60], rat macrophages [12] and mast cells [61] has been established. Some evidence has suggested a role for CD8alpha in apoptosis and survival (e.g. [39]) however a viable model has not emerged to define when and how CD8alpha activation by its ubiquitous MHC class I ligand may be controlled on these cells that lack the TCR.

MHC class I-like protein TL, which exhibits a restricted expression pattern and a high binding affinity for mouse CD8alphaalpha, but not CD8alphabeta [62] could hypothetically control activation of CD8alphaalpha+ monocytes or dendritic cells. One model has proposed that mouse CD8alphaalpha may downregulate T cell responses and promote generation of memory T cells by binding TL [63,64] however, evidence that CD8alphaalpha has a role in generation of memory T cells is controversial [65-67]. Similarly, while one study suggests an inhibitory role of CD8alphaalpha on proliferation and cytotoxicity of T cells (but an enhancement of cytokine release) [68], several studies demonstrate the ability of CD8alphaalpha to enhance T cell cytotoxicity and other responses [69-73]. In the absence of a equivalent of TL in humans that binds CD8alphaalpha with high affinity, the applicability of this model to humans is even more problematic.

Interestingly, some evidence previous to this report suggested CD8 may be able to co-activate responses of FcgammaR. Many of the components of FcR and TCR signaling are homologous or interchangeable, such as Fcgamma and CD3zeta chain, ZAP-70 and Syk [74,75]., or LAT [76]. For instance, Fcgamma and CD3zeta are conserved ancestral duplicates [77] that can substitute for each other in activation of mast cells, gammadelta or alphabeta T cells [18,20,23] LAT binds CD8alpha, and is phosphorylated upon macrophage activation through FcgammaR [76] or upon Fcgamma-dependent activation in mast cells and platelets [78]. A more direct suggestion that CD8 can co-activate Fcgamma-chain dependent signaling through TCR was provided by the demonstration of CD8 involvement in TCR-mediated cytotoxicity in Fcgamma+, CD3zetaeta-/- CTL [19]. What is more, Fcgamma and Syk are naturally expressed by many mature and immature T cells in humans (less so in mice), and participate in TCR-signaling [23], suggesting that in vivo even on T cells CD8 may have a role in activating Fcgamma responses[24]. In sum, reasonable although little acknowledged evidence existed that CD8 participated in Fcgamma chain-linked responses in T cells. However, no evidence had shown whether CD8 could enhance Fcgamma chain responses that were not mediated through TCR thereby expanding this model to include possible functions of CD8 on monocytes, NK cells, dendritic cells, or mast cells.

We and others have previously demonstrated that CD8alpha on rat Mphi and NK cells signals through Syk and src tyrosine kinases [79], consistent with TCR and FcgammaR signaling, but in the absence of TCR [80,81] Here, we find that anti-CD8alpha mAb enhances TNF production of monocytes exposed to immune complexes in an Fc-dependent manner, mirroring the ability of CD8alpha to enhance T cell activation in a TCR-dependent manner. This evidence suggests CD8alpha enhances FcgammaR responses, through at least one of several potential mechanisms. In experiments presented here CD8alpha may promote initial contact and binding stability of anti-CD8alpha mAb containing immune-complexes with FcgammaR. In the same way, CD8alpha may promote binding of FcgammaR to MHC class I-expressing cells coated with immune-complexes in cancer, viral infection or autoimmune disease. Alternatively, or in addition, signaling through CD8alpha may enhance activation of FcgammaR signaling in our experiments. While we have not directly demonstrated that CD8alpha signaling enhances FcgammaR signaling, previous evidence supports this possibility and suggests it merits further investigation. If CD8alpha signaling can enhance FcgammaR signaling then hypothetically CD8alpha may enhance responses of other receptors that both CD3zeta and Fcgamma can function with such as NKp30, and NKp46 [14] in NK cells, and FcepsilonRI in mast cells [21].

Our evidence suggests monocyte responses instigated through immune-complexes and FcR can be amplified by co-engagement of CD8alpha. Interestingly, in rats CD8alpha+ monocytes and Mphi are found at sites of tissue damage in immune-complex mediated glomerulonephritis [82], arthritis [83], tumor [84], experimental allergic encephalomyelitis (a model of multiple sclerosis) [85], and ischaemia-reperfusion injury [86]. TNF is an important mediator in many of these diseases [87,88] As monocyte TNF production is enhanced by co-activation of CD8alpha and immune-complexes, CD8alpha on monocytes may aggravate some autoimmune and acute inflammatory conditions characterized by tissue deposition of immune-complexes.

In summary, we find that human monocytes express CD8alpha and that monocyte CD8alpha is differentiable from that on T cells by 2-D electrophoresis. We provide evidence that CD8alpha on monocytes amplifies responses initiated through FcR, suggesting for the first time a co-activator role for CD8 on cells without the TCR.

Total RNA was isolated using the Qiagen RNeasy kit. RNA was reverse-transcribed with Superscript II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) using oligo(dT) as primers. The cDNA concentration was estimated by absorbance for each sample and diluted to 100 ng/25 ul of reaction volume. The number of cycles was optimized to be in the exponential phase of the reaction by performing the reaction at different cycles. Densitometric analysis of the gels was performed to select optimal PCR cycle numbers. Thereafter, PCR was performed in 20 mul reactions with primer pairs (25 muM) below. Intron-spanning primers of the sequence 5'-TTTCGGCGAGATACGTCTAACCCTGTGC-3' and 5'-TTTAGCCTCCCCCTTTGTAAAACGGGCG-3' were used to generate a CD8alpha cDNA fragment of 379 bp [70].

PE labeled HLA-A*0201 tetramers assembled [71] with two peptides selected by the SYFPEITHI search engine, Mycobacterium tuberculosis antigen 85-B 143-152 (KLVANNTRL) and a diabetes-specific epitope of glutamic acid decarboxylase 114-123 (VMNILLQYVV) were a gift of Dr. John Elliott (University of Alberta). All washes and incubations of cells were done in ice cold PBS with 0.02% NaN3. 1 x 106 human PBMC were incubated 15 min with 1.5 mug tetramers before the addition of CD14-FITC for 15 min. Before flow cytometry analysis cells were washed three times. In some experiments cells were incubated with 40 mug/mL anti-CD8alpha mAb or isotype control for 30 min prior to addition of tetramers.

Monocytes were treated with isotype or anti-CD8alpha mAb (10 mug/mL), or immune-complexes. All mAb were negative for endotoxin using the LAL assay (Sigma-Aldrich). Immune-complexes were prepared by combining isotype mAb or anti-CD8alpha mAb (10 mug/mL) with anti-mouse Ig (20 mug/mL) for 15 min before addition to monocytes. Monocytes enriched on a Percoll gradient were incubated with immune-complexes for 5 h at 0.2 x 106 cells/well of a 96 well plate (Becton Dickinson, 35172). Anti-human TNF-PE mAb, fixation and permeabilization buffers, and monensin were from ebioscience (San Diego, CA). Intracellular TNF was detected according to supplier recommendations. Monensin (2 muM) was added 2 h after immune-complexes.

Stimulation of monocytes with immune-complexes was inhibited by pretreating monocytes with 50 mug/mL purified mouse IgG Fc fragment (Jackson Immunoresearch, West Grove, USA) to block binding of immune-complexes to FcR. In these experiments free binding sites of anti-mouse Ig antibody in immune-complexes that might otherwise bind Fc fragments on pretreated monocytes, were pre-blocked with 50 mug/mL purified Fc fragment.

Protein recognized by anti-CD8alpha mAb D9 is CD8alpha. CD8alpha was enriched from human thymus lysate by immunoaffinity chromatography with anti-CD8alpha mAb OKT8. OKT8-reactive fractions were analyzed by western blot with anti-CD8alpha mAb D9 (left), and silver stain (right) after 2-D electrophoresis. Alignment of western blot and silver stain gels allowed extraction of D9-reactive spots from silver stained gels for peptide sequencing by MALDI-QTOF (lower panel).
