We cloned a new imprinted gene by searching for parental-origin-specific CpG methylations using methylation-sensitive two-dimensional genome scanning method. This gene encodes a putative 51 kDa protein with significant similarity to U2 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein auxiliary factor small subunits, an essential mammalian splicing factor, and is located on mouse chromosome 11, of which maternal duplication/paternal deficiency results in a small body.
