Despite the growing understanding of PDGF signaling, studies of PDGF function have encountered two major obstacles: the functional redundancy of PDGFRalpha and PDGFRbeta in vitro and their distinct roles in vivo. Here we used wild-type mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEF), MEF null for either PDGFRalpha, beta, or both to dissect PDGF-PDGFR signaling pathways. These four PDGFR genetically defined cells provided us a platform to study the relative contributions of the pathways triggered by the two PDGF receptors. They were treated with PDGF-BB and analyzed for differential gene expression, in vitro proliferation and differential response to pharmacological effects. No genes were differentially expressed in the double null cells, suggesting minimal receptor-independent signaling. Protean differentiation and proliferation pathways are commonly regulated by PDGFRalpha, PDGFRbeta and PDGFRalpha/beta while each receptor is also responsible for regulating unique signaling pathways. Furthermore, some signaling is solely modulated through heterodimeric PDGFRalpha/beta.

Platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) is the principal mitogen in serum for mesenchymal cells and consists of a family of A, B, C, and D polypeptides which promote cell migration, proliferation, and survival by binding to their cognate homo- or heterodimeric tyrosine kinase receptors, PDGFRalpha and PDGFRbeta[1], [2], [3]. Enhanced signaling of PDGF has been implicated in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis, balloon injury induced restenosis, pulmonary fibrosis, angiogenesis, and tumorigenesis [4].

Tumor growth can be promoted by PDGF via autocrine stimulation of malignant cells, by overexpression or overactivation of PDGFRs, or by PDGF stimulation of angiogenesis within the tumor. Constitutive activation of PDGFRalpha or PDGFRbeta is seen in myeloid malignancies as a consequence of fusion to diverse partner genes, and activating mutations of PDGFRalpha are seen in gastrointestinal tumors (GISTs). Active PDGFRalpha was also found in non-small cell lung cancer[5]. Autocrine signaling as a consequence of PDGF overexpression has been implicated in the pathogenesis of dermatofibrosarcoma protruberans (DFSP) and overexpression of PDGFRs and/or their ligands has been described in many other solid tumors such as medulloblastomas and malignant gliomas [6], [7]. Therefore, PDGFRs have increasingly become targets for anticancer therapeutics and antirestenosis agents. Two main approaches have been taken toward the inhibition of cancer growth when PDGF-PDGFR signaling is activated: (a) direct targeting of tumor cells in which PDGF signaling is activated, and (b) indirect inhibition of tumors by targeting pericytes to block tumor angiogenesis independently of PDGF activity. A PDGFR inhibitor, imatinib mesylate (Gleevec, STI-571), has benefited patients with myeloid malignancies, GIST and DFSP [8]. PI3K-AKT-mTOR cascade is one of the most frequently deregulated pathway in cancers [9], [10], [11]. Recently we have found that the PDGF receptors are critical for the PI3K/AKT activation and negatively regulated by mTOR. This negative feedback mechanism is important in the prevention of aberrant cell proliferation/growth such as tumor formation and has significant implication in the targeted inhibition of this pathway for cancer treatment [12], [13].

Despite the growing understanding of PDGF signaling, studies of PDGF function have met two obstacles. First, PDGF stimulates a very similar set of cellular responses and signaling events in cultured cells expressing only PDGFRalpha or PDGFRbeta. Because of their functional redundancy or compensation of the receptors with respect to one another in vitro, the signaling events of PDGFRalpha or PDGFRbeta cannot be readily analyzed and differentiated. Second, in contrast to in vitro studies, PDGFRalpha and PDGFRbeta have dramatically different roles in vivo. The mechanism of PDGFR signaling during development is poorly understood because deletion of either the PDGFRalpha or PDGFRbeta leads to early embryonic lethality. While PDGFRbeta null embryos are only deficient in smooth muscle cells, particularly vascular smooth muscle cells and pericytes, a large number of different mesenchymal cells are affected in PDGFRalpha null embryos. The distinct phenotypes of mice lacking either PDGFRalpha or PDGFRbeta suggest that PDGFRs might have unique effectors and/or distinct spatial and temporal expression pattern in vivo.

In this study we employed a panel of PDGFR genetically defined cell lines as a platform that allows us to examine the relative contributions of the two receptors to PDGF signaling. We studied the gene expression profile and in vitro proliferation assays of the four different genotypes of PDGF receptors: PDGFRalpha/beta double null, PDGFRbeta null, PDGFRalpha null or WT PDGFRalpha/beta in MEF cells. These profiles were then dissected analytically using gene set oriented techniques and complementary data from protein interaction databases. The genes identified in this analysis were then investigated further via protein expression and phosphorylation status analyses. Their functional relevance was then studied.

To investigate the role of PDGFRs in cellular proliferation in response to PDGF stimulation, cells were grown in serum free Cellgro COMPLETEtrade mark medium with or without PDGF. In the absence of PDGF, the proliferation rates of all four PDGFR genetically defined cell lines were found to be similar. However, with the addition of PDGF-BB, PDGFRbeta null, PDGFRalpha null and WT cells proliferate faster than the PDGFRalpha/beta double null cells (Figure 1A). In addition, we examined the role that each of the PDGF receptors plays in promoting cell migration and invasion. PDGFRalpha, PDGFRbeta and heterodimeric PDGFRalpha/beta were demonstrated to promote cell migration and also PDGFRbeta and heterodimeric PDGFRalpha/beta to enhance cell invasion (Figure 1B).

A: PDGF-BB promotes cell proliferation through PDGFR. 1x105 cells were plated at Day 0 and then counted each day for next consecutive three days. Dot lines: cells grown in FBS-free Cellgro Complete medium. Solid lines: cells grown in FBS-free Cellgro Complete medium with PDGF-BB (50 ng/ml). B: PDGFR is required for PDGF mediated cell migration and invasion. Cell migration and invasion were measured by a 24-well chamber-based assay. 2.5x104 cells were seeded in the upper chamber in FBS free Cellgro Complete medium. The lower chamber was filled with Cellgro Complete medium with no FBS, 10% FBS or PDGF-BB (50 ng/ml). After 24 h, the cells in the lower chamber were labeled with Calcein AM and detached. The detached labeled cells were then measured for fluorescence. Upper panel: Migration assay. Lower panel: Invasion assay. C: PDGF-mediated PI3K and MAP kinase signalings are absent in PDGFRalpha and PDGFRbeta double deficient cell lines. Four cell lines were treated with PDGF-BB (50 ng/ml) for 10 min, 1 hour (h), 4 h, 8 h and 24 h. The harvested lysates were immunoblotted for PDGFRalpha, PDGFRbeta, p-ERK (Tyr 204), ERK, p-AKT (Ser473), and AKT. Data shown is one of the representative experiments.

Furthermore, PDGF-PDGFR is a known trigger of at least two pathways: the PI3K-AKT and MAPK pathways. To investigate the ability of PDGF to stimulate these pathways in our system, we treated cells with 50 ng/ml of PDGF-BB for various durations. For 10 min post treatment, ERK protein in PDGFRbeta null, PDGFRalpha null, and WT cell lines was extensively phosphorylated, compared with the no treatment by PDGF-BB (Figure 1C). The phosphorylation of AKT protein at various time points showed a similar pattern to ERK phosphorylation and decreased after 24 h. However, in the PDGFRalpha and PDGFRbeta double null cell line, neither ERK nor AKT phosphorylation was increased after the PDGF-BB stimulation.

To study the role of PDGFRs in PDGF mediated transcription, cells were treated with or without PDGF-BB for 1 h. Analysis of the microarray expression data yielded lists of transcripts that were differentially expressed (responded to PDGF-BB) with high statistical confidence in each of the four cell lines. As described in the Experimental Procedures section, the Significance Analysis of Microarrays (SAM) [14] method was used to identify differentially expressed genes with a false discovery rate <0.05. By comparing these lists, we identified genes that responded to PDGF-BB treatment uniquely in each cell line, and also genes that responded to treatment in multiple cell lines. For example, Figure 2 shows a heatmap describing the transcriptional activity of the genes that were identified in common among the PDGFRbeta null, PDGFRalpha null and WT cell lines (genes such as Txnip, Fos, Egr1, Egr2, Fra-1 (FOSL1), ATF-3, and NR4A1 were all identified as differentially expressed in this particular comparison). The complete list of genes affected by treatment in each cell line can be found in the Supplemental Material (see Table S1 Diff-Genes-PDGF-BB-Treatment.xls).

In order to identify functional similarities among the genes that were differentially expressed in one or more of the treatment conditions, we identified GO terms that were statistically overrepresented in each list of genes as described in Materials and Methods. Figure 3 shows the GO Molecular Function terms that were enriched for each cell line. Lists enumerating all of the enriched GO terms for each cell line can be found in the Supplemental Material (see Table S2 GO-Enrichment-PDGF-BB-Treatment.xls). The GO terms characterizing the WT alone (in green) cover transcriptional control and apoptotic programs. Examination of which genes are responsible for this enrichment reveals central "actors" in proliferation, differentiation and apoptosis such as: HES1, BHLHB2, JunB, FOSL1, SRF, SKIL, EGR1, NAB2, FOSB, NR4A1, CCL2 and SERPINE1. The PDGFRalpha null cell line but not the PDGFRbeta null or WT showed differential expression of GDP signaling genes (i.e. required the PDGFRbeta isoform, but may be repressed by activity of the PDGFRalpha isoform). Conversely, the differentially expressed GO sets particular to the PDGFRbeta null and WT cell lines (i.e. requiring the PDGFRalpha isoform) characterize ketosteroid metabolism (colored magenta). Red nodes represent those sets that were found to be differentially expressed in all but the double (alpha/beta) null cell lines, and include the MAP kinase pathway, prostaglandin signaling pathways and several other signaling pathways.

In addition to the differential expression analysis, we used sigPathway [15] to identify functional groups of genes (e.g., pathways) that exhibited significantly different behavior between the various conditions. As with the differential expression analysis, we first identified gene sets by comparing the treatment to the non-treatment condition for each of the cell lines. We then compared the pathways identified for each cell line to one another in order to determine which functionality could be attributed most strongly to stimulation of each combination of receptors. The double null data was not included in this analysis because our differential expression analysis indicated that there was no significant change in transcriptional activity that resulted from treatment of the double null cell line. Table 1 lists the gene sets identified as responding to treatment in the various cell lines.

Several pathways were ranked highly for all three cell lines in this analysis, indicating that these pathways were activated by all of the receptors after PDGF-BB stimulation, including cAMP/Ca signaling and G-protein coupled receptor signaling. In addition, many pathways were highly-ranked in only a strict subset of the cell lines. For example, the IL6 and NFkappaB signaling pathways were both stimulated in the WT cell line; C21-steroid hormone biosynthesis was stimulated in the PDGFRbeta null cell line; angiogenesis and epidermal growth factor receptor signaling pathway were both stimulated in the PDGFRalpha null cell line.

None of the mRNA targets probed by the microarrays exceeded our differential expression threshold in the double null cell line, indicating that transcriptional response to PDGF-BB ligand is mediated entirely through activation of one or both of the PDGF receptors. Pearson correlation coefficients were computed between the mRNA expression fold-change vectors for each cell line (Table 2). This analysis revealed that transcriptional responses to PDGF-BB in the PDGFRalpha null and PDGFRbeta null cells are more similar to the expression response of the WT cells than they are to one another, or the double null cells. The double null cell line's response to PDGF-BB was essentially uncorrelated with that of the other three cell lines.

In order to study the function of the two receptors independent of their activation state, we sought genes whose transcription levels changed between the PDGFRalpha null, PDGFRbeta null and WT samples when compared to the untreated double null samples. We then repeated this analysis using the treated samples (i.e., which genes were differentially expressed in the treated PDGFRalpha null/PDGFRbeta null/WT vs. the treated double null cells). We identified those genes whose expression changes were conserved between the untreated and PDGF-BB treated cells. We suggest that these genes are regulated by the presence or absence of a particular receptor, rather than by activation of a receptor through growth factor ligation. Please see Supplemental Material (see Table S3 PDGF-Independent-Gene-Lists.xls) for complete lists of these transcripts.

We constructed a protein-interaction network based on the annotations present in the HPRD database. We included all interactions where both proteins were the products of genes that were differentially expressed in at least one cell line. Figure 4 shows this network, with each gene labeled by color to indicate the cell lines where it was differentially expressed. Interpretation of this network must be cautious; at the very least because there is significant bias of protein-interaction databases towards those pathways that are better characterized. Nonetheless, we identified significantly enriched pathways (i.e. hypergeometric p value, corrected for multiple hypothesis testing, <0.05) among the various combinations of receptor systems. For example, A2B adenosine receptor related processes were identified among the dark blue nodes (see Table S4 GO-Enrichment-for-PPI-Figure.xls in Supplementary Materials for all pathways).

Immunoblotting was used to examine the effect of PDGF-BB treatment at the protein-level for several of the genes identified by the microarray analysis. As per mRNA expression data, Txnip (thioredoxin-interacting protein) was identified as one of the most significantly down-regulated mRNA transcripts. As shown in Figures 2 and 5, protein expression of Txnip is mainly suppressed by PDGFRalpha, since Txnip is reduced in the presence of PDGFRalpha and diminished with the activation of PDGFRalpha by PDGF stimulation. PDGFRbeta may have some effects during longer treatment. To confirm this result, we also performed Western blotting with a different ligand (PDGF-AA, 50 ng/ml) to assess the level of Txnip protein expression. The results showed that Txnip was down-regulated in the cell lines containing PDGFRalpha and heterodimeric PDGFRalpha/beta (Figure 5A). In the regular medium , Txnip was also down regulated in the PDGFRalpha (PDGFRbeta null cell line) and WT cell line (Figure 5B). PDGF is one of main growth factors in FBS and thus is sufficient to suppress Txnip in PDGFRalpha and WT cell line. Txnip gene expression was further validated by real time-PCR (Figure 5c).

Protein expression of Nurr1 (Nr4a2) and Nur77 (Nr4a1) are altered only in the PDGFR WT cell line post 10 min stimulation of PDGF-BB. This is consistent with the microarray data, where production of mRNA for Nurr1 was induced only in the WT cell line, and production of mRNA for Nur77 was induced most drastically in the WT cell line, and less so in the PDGFRbeta null and PDGFRalpha null cell lines (Figure 2). EGR1 is an early response gene and its protein expression is up-regulated in the PDGFRbeta null, PDGFRalpha null and WT cell lines, but not in the PDGFR double null cell line at 1 h treatment with PDGF-BB. This is also consistent with the microarray data. ATF-3 is up-regulated in the PDGFRbeta null, PDGFRalpha null and WT cell lines, but not in the PDGFR double null cell line, even at 24 h treatment with PDGF-BB. In the PDGFRalpha null cell line, protein levels of ATF-3 gradually increase at all time points. This is somewhat different from the PDGFRbeta null and WT cell lines where ATF-3 protein levels are increased at early time points and gradually decrease thereafter. This indicates that ATF-3 is regulated differently by PDGFRalpha, PDGFRbeta and heterodimeric PDGFRalpha/beta. These results again agree with the microarray analysis (Figure 2).

As described above, we employed the sigPathway method [15] to identify functional groups of genes that exhibited significantly different behavior between the various conditions. We used Western blotting to validate components of one of the pathways, IL6, identified as up-regulated significantly (p<0.05) in the WT cell line in response to PDGF stimulation (Figure 6 A and B). In this IL6 pathway, the genes Fos, Cebpb (NF-IL6), Jun and IL6 were significantly upregulated (p<0.05). As shown in Figure 6C, a few key component genes such as Cebpb (NF-IL6), Fos and Jun in the IL6 pathway were demonstrated as up-regulated by Western blotting. Fos and Jun were up-regulated with PDGF-BB treatment for 1 h while Cebpb (NF-IL6) was little changed. In the absence of PDGF-BB treatment, Jun expression was slightly higher in the PDGFRbeta null and WT cell lines than in the others.

STI-571 (imatinib mesylae, Gleevec, Novartis, Basel, Switzerland) inhibits phosphorylation of both PDGFRalpha and PDGFRbeta and their downstream targets ERK and AKT [16], [17]. In this study we examined the downstream effects of the drug on the PDGF-PDGFR pathway by inhibiting the different isoforms of the receptor. The dosage 5 microM of STI-571 was selected to inhibit PDGFRalpha and PDGFRbeta efficiently [18].

As in Figure 6D, p-AKT was inhibited in PDGFRbeta null, PDGFRalpha null and WT cell lines, while p-ERK was mainly inhibited in PDGFRalpha containing cells upon the STI-571 treatment. C-Fos was moderately inhibited in PDGFRbeta null and PDGFRalpha null while its expression was strongly inhibited in WT cells by the drug. ATF3 was not inhibited in PDGFRbeta null, PDGFRalpha null and WT cell lines by STI-571 alone, but was inhibited in PDGFRbeta null, PDGFRalpha null and WT cell lines by STI-571 in the presence of both PDGF-BB. Fra-1 (FOSL1) expression did not change significantly in the PDGFRbeta null, PDGFRalpha null and WT cell lines by STI-571 while its expression was increased in the PDGFRbeta null, PDGFRalpha null and WT cell lines in the presence of both PDGF-BB and STI-571. It is notable that PDGF-BB stimulation could not reverse the STI-571 inhibition effect on some genes' expression even though PDGFR-BB moderately increased the expression of C-Fos and Fra-1 as compared to STI-571 inhibition alone.

PDGFRalpha and PDGFRbeta activate many overlapping signaling pathways. All of the receptors activate the same pathways such as cAMP/Ca+ signaling and G-protein coupled receptor signaling after the PDGF-BB stimulation. However, some signaling pathways are exclusively or predominantly activated by one receptor but not the other. Here, we demonstrated that 33 gene sets were activated by PDGFRalpha only and 15 genes sets by PDGFRbeta only. 25 genes sets were specifically activated by PDGFRalpha/beta heterodimers. For example, PDGFRalpha/beta activated components of the NFkappaB and IL6 signaling pathways, PDGFRalpha activated C21-steroid hormone biosynthesis; and PDGFRbeta activated the angiogenesis and epidermal growth factor receptor signaling pathways. Previous investigations of the pathways regulated by PDGFRs were done one pathway at a time[22]; here we used a bioinformatics approach to comprehensively analyze ,multiple pathways. Nonetheless, the earlier study suggested the Ca++ fluxes pathway is regulated by both PDGFRalpha and PDGFRbeta [22] and angiogenesis is only transduced by PDGFRbeta [22], [23]. Our current study is agreement with the previous study (Table 1).

Txnip was identified here to be highly suppressed by PDGFRalpha. It is identical to VDUP1 (Vitamin D3 up-regulated protein 1) [24], [25]. Txnip/VDUP1 is a known tumor suppressor, cell cycle inhibitor and a factor contributing to P27kip1 stability [26], [27], [28], [29]. Recently, PDGF has been shown to suppress VDUP1 at the mRNA level [30]. We have confirmed that Txnip is down-regulated by PDGF at both the mRNA level and protein level. Furthermore, we identified PDGFRalpha as the suppressor of Txnip in response to PDGF signaling (Figure 2 and Figure 5).

NR4A1/Nur77 and NR4A2/Nurr1 genes are two members of nuclear hormone receptor family (including Nur77, Nurr1 and Nor-1 or NR4A1-3) [31]. It has been demonstrated that the constitutive expression of Nur77 may induce apoptosis while transient expression does not [31]. With addition of PDGF, Nurr1 and Nur77 protein levels are transiently up-regulated in 10 min, which may protect cells against apoptosis. This occurs only in the presence of PDGFRalpha with PDGF stimulation. It also has been demonstrated that Nur77 is a survival effecter protein in the context of TNF alpha mediated signaling [31]. The mechanism for Nur77 as a survival effecter protein needs to be further investigated. A very recent study showed that the third member in the nuclear hormone receptor family NR4A orphan nuclear receptor NOR1 is induced by PDGF and mediates vascular smooth muscle cell proliferation [32].This finding suggests that the nuclear hormone receptor family are therapeutic targets for some diseases in which PDGFRs are overexpressed.

These results are illustrative of the combinatorial richness of PDGF receptor/ligand-mediated signaling. Our results begin to reveal the downstream interplay of the signaling events brought about by the activation of each of the two receptors, indicating the biological effect of receptor/ligand specificity. Furthermore, in this study, we have demonstrated that transcriptional response to PDGF-BB ligand is mediated entirely through activation of one or both of its receptors and suggest that PDGF ligand, PDGF-BB in this study, does not bind any other receptors.

Similar to the stimulation of PDGF, the responsiveness of PDGF receptors to pharmacological inhibition is also complex. While STI-571 inhibits AKT activation through either PDGFRalpha or PDGFRbeta, it blocks ERK activation mainly through PDGFRalpha (Figure 6). Therefore, this PDGFR platform may help us to further understand the molecular mechanism of therapeutic inhibition on PDGF-PDGFR signaling and identify additional critical molecular targets for the intervention of cancer and other diseases.

The studies presented here are prone to many well-known limitations, such as the noisiness of expression microarrays, the frequent lack of concordance of gene and protein expression, and the post-translational signaling systems that are at most only faintly echoed in gene expression levels. We have attempted to minimize these limitations by employing rigorous statistical techniques, focusing on pathways as much as on individual genes, using protein interaction data to corroborate co-expression findings and using selected protein measurements, including previously implicated post-translational modifications.

In summary, we have taken advantage of the experimental platform presented by PDGFR double null cells, PDGFRalpha, PDGFRbeta and PDGFR WT cell lines (where dimers PDGFRalpha/alpha, PDGFRbeta/beta, PDGFRalpha/beta co-exist) and used a bioinformatics approach to dissect the gene sets/pathways that are controlled by two PDGFR isoforms with PDGF-BB ligand stimulation. Our study also provides a reproducible approach to the dissection of the contributions of a heteromeric receptor signaling system. While minimal PDGF receptor-independent signaling was found, we identified the signals commonly regulated by PDGFRalpha, PDGFRbeta and PDGFRalpha/beta, specifically triggered by each of the two PDGF receptors as well as the heterodimeric PDGFRalpha/beta.

The plasmids were transfected with Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) into the retroviral packaging cell line PT67 (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA). Filtered medium containing viruses carrying PDGFRbeta was used to infect PDGFRalpha+/+ beta-/- MEF. Infected cells were then selected with 100 microg/ml hygromycin B (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA). All cells were cultured in DMEM with or without 10% FBS in 5% CO2 at 37degreesC.

Total RNA was extracted using the RNeasy Mini kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) from cells that were treated or untreated with or without 50 ng/ml PDGF-BB for 1 h. Five microg RNA of each sample was used for double-stranded cDNA synthesis. In vitro transcription was carried out using the Enzo BioArray High Yield RNA Transcript Labeling Kit (Enzo, New York, NY). The labeled cRNA target (20 microg each) was then fragmented into 35-200 base pair fragments and hybridized to each Affymetrix GeneChip(R) Mouse Genome 430 2.0 array according to Affymetrix Eukaryotic Target Hybridization Protocol. Following a 16-h incubation the microarrays were washed and scanned using the EukGE-WS2v4 fluidics protocol.

Microarray data were normalized, background corrected and summarized using the robust multi-array average (RMA2) method [35]. We identified individual genes that exhibited statistically significant differential expression as a result of PDGF treatment in each null experiment (i.e., genes induced or repressed in the alpha-/- beta-/-, alpha+/+ beta-/-, alpha-/-beta+/+, alpha+/+ beta+/+ cells when treated with PDGF-BB) using SAM method [14]. In each comparison we selected a value for SAM's Delta parameter to specify a median false discovery rate less than 0.05, and we consider the genes reported at this threshold to be differentially expressed between the treatment and non-treatment conditions.

To identify functional groups of genes from each cell line with RNA expression profiles that were affected by PDGF-BB treatment, we used Tian et al's [15] sigPathway method Gene set annotations were assembled from Gene Ontology [36], KEGG [37], BioCarta (biocarta.com), BioCyc [38] and custom data. This method identifies significantly enriched gene sets by testing two related null hypotheses: 1) The pattern of expression for the genes in a particular gene set is the same as all the other genes, and 2) the gene set does not contain genes with expression profiles that are correlated with treatment. We picked out gene sets that were distinguished by both statistics by ranking the sets by the sum of the ranks of their two statistics. All of the gene sets presented here had a false discovery rate below 0.05 for at least one statistic.

We identified statistically over-represented Gene Ontology (GO) terms for the lists of differentially expressed genes by computing a hypergeometric p-value for each GO annotation associated with a given gene list. The resulting p-values were corrected for multiple hypothesis testing using the FRD method [39]. An FDR below 0.05 was regarded as indicating significant over-representation.

Comparison of genes lists
###end title 68
###begin p 69
Once lists of genes and pathways whose mRNA expression responded to PDGF-BB treatment were assembled by the above methods, we compared the lists to see which genes had responded to treatment uniquely in one of the nulls or wild type, or common to two or more of the null and wild type conditions.

Correlation analysis
###end title 70
###begin p 71
In order to evaluate how similar each of the four cell lines' transcriptional responses to PDGF-BB ligand stimulation were to one another, Pearson correlation coefficients were computed between all pairs of cell lines. The SAM software package for R was used to compute fold change values (PDGF-BB treated expression values vs. untreated expression values) for all genes present in the normalized microarray data, for each cell line. Thus, four vectors of fold change estimates were obtained (one for double null, one for alpha null, one beta null and one for wild type) representing each cell line's response to ligand stimulation. Pearson correlations between each pair of these vectors were computed using R.
