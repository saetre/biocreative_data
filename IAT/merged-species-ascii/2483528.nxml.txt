During migration, cells must couple direction sensing to signal transduction and actin remodeling. We previously identified GIV/Girdin as a Galphai3 binding partner. We demonstrate that in mammalian cells Galphai3 controls the functions of GIV during cell migration. We find that Galphai3 preferentially localizes to the leading edge and that cells lacking Galphai3 fail to polarize or migrate. A conformational change induced by association of GIV with Galphai3 promotes Akt-mediated phosphorylation of GIV, resulting in its redistribution to the plasma membrane. Activation of Galphai3 serves as a molecular switch that triggers dissociation of Gbetagamma and GIV from the Gi3-GIV complex, thereby promoting cell migration by enhancing Akt signaling and actin remodeling. Galphai3-GIV coupling is essential for cell migration during wound healing, macrophage chemotaxis, and tumor cell migration, indicating that the Galphai3-GIV switch serves to link direction sensing from different families of chemotactic receptors to formation of the leading edge during cell migration.

Cell migration in response to chemotactic stimuli is a key aspect of many physiological and pathological processes (Van Haastert and Devreotes, 2004). During migration, signals from the exterior are relayed to the cell interior via surface receptors to initiate events necessary for efficient directional motility. The most extensively studied chemotactic receptors in the context of cell migration are the growth factor receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) studied in fibroblasts and epithelial cells and G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) extensively studied in leukocytes and Dictyostelium discoideum (Van Haastert and Devreotes, 2004). Regardless of which receptor system is involved in sensing chemotactic stimuli, they signal via a conserved pathway that culminates in the activation and enhancement of Akt/PKB through phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) at the leading edge of migrating cells (Merlot and Firtel, 2003; Van Haastert and Devreotes, 2004). Once the Akt signal is adequately enhanced, cells "polarize" and reposition their Golgi apparatus and microtubule-organizing center (MTOC) in front of the nucleus and form the leading edge (Etienne-Manneville and Hall, 2002; Ridley et al., 2003) oriented toward the direction of the chemotactic stimulus.

GIV (Galpha-interacting vesicle-associated protein) was discovered based on its ability to bind Galphai3 (Le-Niculescu et al., 2005). Simultaneous work from other groups proposed distinct roles for GIV in endocytosis (Simpson et al., 2005) and in regulating cell migration via its interaction with Akt, actin, and PI4P (Anai et al., 2005; Enomoto et al., 2005). Of particular interest is the fact that GIV is localized at the crossroads of two major signaling pathways, as it is able to interact with alpha-subunits of G proteins (Le-Niculescu et al., 2005) and enhance PI3K-Akt activity upon RTK stimulation (Anai et al., 2005). Although RTKs and Gbetagamma-subunits are known to directly increase PI3K activity and subsequently activate Akt (Stephens et al., 1997), the role of Galpha-subunits in this process has remained unclear. We set out to define the role of Galpha-subunits and the significance of its interaction with GIV during cell migration and to understand how Galpha-subunits and GIV link cell surface receptors to downstream signaling events.

In this paper, we show that Galphai3 regulates GIV's functions during cell migration. We provide mechanistic insights into how activation of the G protein dictates the formation of the leading edge in a chemotaxing cell by coupling direction sensing through cell surface receptors to Akt enhancement and actin remodeling via GIV.

Both GIV and Galphai3 are localized on Golgi membranes and the plasma membrane (PM; Stow et al., 1991; Denker et al., 1996; Enomoto et al., 2005; Le-Niculescu et al., 2005). We reported previously that GIV is predominantly on vesicles near the Golgi during quiescence (Le-Niculescu et al., 2005), and others reported that during cell migration it accumulates at the leading edge where it interacts with Akt and participates in actin remodeling (Enomoto et al., 2005). Because key participants in cell migration (GIV, PI3K, Akt, and actin; Merlot and Firtel, 2003; Enomoto et al., 2005) are enriched at the leading edge, we asked if Galphai3 behaves similarly. We subjected confluent monolayers of HeLa cells to scratch wounding to induce unidirectional cell migration (Kupfer et al., 1982) and examined the distribution of endogenous Galphai3 by immunofluorescence (IF). In quiescent cells far from the wound, Galphai3 showed a predominant Golgi localization based on colocalization with a Golgi marker, beta1-4 galactosyltransferase (beta-GALT; Fig. 1 A, a-c), and was almost undetectable at the cell periphery marked by actin (Fig. 1 A, d-f). In contrast, migrating cells at the edge of the wound showed peripheral Galphai3-stained puncta within lamellipodial extensions. Some of these puncta colocalized with actin at the leading edge (Fig. 1 A, g-j). Thus, Galphai3 showed different distributions depending on the migratory state of the cell.

Galphai3 redistributes to the cell periphery during cell migration and is necessary for cell migration. (A) Distribution of Galphai3 in quiescent (a-f) versus migrating (g-j) HeLa cells after scratch wounding. In quiescent cells, endogenous Galphai3 colocalizes with betaGalT in the Golgi (a-c) but not actin (d-f). In migrating cells, Galphai3 is found in puncta that partially colocalize with actin at the leading edge (g-i). Arrows denote direction of migration. Boxed area in i is enlarged in j. HeLa cells were aldehyde fixed 0 (left) and 8 (right) h after scratch wounding, as shown in the diagram, and stained as indicated. Bars,10 mum. (B) Depletion of Galphai3 (g and h) or GIV (e and f), but not Galphas (c and d), impairs wound healing (compare with scrambled siRNA [scr siRNA] controls; a and b). Repletion of hGalphai3 by rat Galphai3 (i and j), but not vector alone (k and l), restores this defect. HeLa cells treated as indicated were subjected to scratch wounding and examined immediately after wounding (0 h) or 16 h later (n = 5). (C) Cell lysates from cells treated as in B were immunoblotted to assess the efficiency of siRNA depletion of Galphas (approximately90%), GIV (approximately85%), or Galphai3 (approximately95%) and the expression of rGalphai3. Several GIV bands are identified that most likely are different posttranslationally modified forms of GIV because they are specifically depleted using GIV siRNA. (D) Comparative trajectories of Galphai3-depleted cells versus those transfected with Galphai3-YFP were followed by live cell imaging for 8 h after wounding. Representative cells at the advancing edge of the wound (dashed line) were traced using a cell tracker application on videos obtained of transfected (solid squiggles) or untransfected (circles) cells through the YFP channel (b) or a simultaneously recorded DIC channel (a; Video 1, available at ). (E) Bar graphs showing the distance covered by cells in D analyzed by the cell-tracker application (top graph) and the percent of untransfected Galphai3-depleted cells versus Galphai3-depleted cells transfected with rGalphai3-YFP that displayed directional migration (bottom graph). Results are shown as mean +/- SEM (n = 3).

Because GIV is a binding partner of the alpha-subunit of Gi and Gs and is important for cell migration, we asked if Galphai3 or Galphas is necessary for cell migration. We depleted Galphai3 in HeLa cells using siRNA oligos (Fig. 1 C) and measured the rates of wound closure. Depleting Galphai3 (approximately95%) delayed wound healing (Fig. 1 B, g and h), whereas controls closed the wound as expected (Fig. 1 B, a and b). This impairment in migration was similar to that observed when GIV was depleted (approximately85%; Fig. 1 B, e and f). In contrast, depletion of Galphas (approximately90%) had no effect (Fig. 1 B, c and d). Galphai3-depleted cells regained their ability to close the wound when Galphai3 levels were replenished by expression of siRNA-resistant rat (rGalphai3wt; Fig. 1 B, i-l).

Live cell imaging revealed that most (approximately75%) of the Galphai3-depleted cells displayed random oscillatory movements around a virtually motionless nucleus (Fig. 1, D and E; and Video 1, available at ), resembling cells expressing a dominant-negative migration-defective GIV mutant (Enomoto et al., 2005). When siRNA-resistant YFP-tagged rGalphai3 (rGalphai3-YFP) was introduced into Gi3-depleted cells, approximately75% of the transfected cells migrated toward the wound (Fig. 1 E).

To study the dynamics of Galphai3 localization after wounding, we observed HeLa cells expressing rGalphai3-YFP by live cell imaging as they transitioned from quiescence to migration. Previously, we demonstrated that rGalphai3-YFP localizes largely to the Golgi and behaves similarly to endogenous Galphai3 (Weiss et al., 2001). During migration, Galphai3-YFP localized preferentially within pseudopods at the leading edge as manifest by the transient "blush" of fluorescent signal within these microdomains (Fig. 2 A and Video 2, available at ). This blush most likely reflects the transient localization of Galphai3-stained puncta (Fig. 1 A, j) that are not resolved by the optical conditions used for live cell imaging (see Materials and methods). Because Galphai3 is membrane anchored, membrane redundancy at the sites of pseudopod formation could lead to nonspecific accumulation of membrane-anchored proteins (Servant et al., 1999). However, myristoyl-palmitoyl-modified YFP (mp-YFP), which has the same modifications as Galphai3-YFP and was previously characterized as a general membrane marker (Zacharias et al., 2002), showed patchy distribution along the entire PM and other membranous compartments without any preference for the leading edge during polarized migration (Fig. 2 B and Video 3). Accumulation of Galphai3 was also observed within pseudopods at the leading edge using 1,1'-Dioctadecyl-3,3,3',3'-tetramethyllindodicarbocyanine perchlorate (DiD) as an alternative membrane marker (Fig. S1, available at ; Servant et al., 1999). We conclude that Galphai3, like its binding partner GIV, is concentrated at the leading edge of a migrating cell.

Because Galphai3-depleted cells failed to undergo directional migration, we looked for defects in centrosome reorientation at the wound edge using HeLa cells stably expressing the centrosome marker Centrin1-GFP and quantified as described previously (Fig. 3 B; Kupfer et al., 1982; Etienne-Manneville and Hall, 2001). We observed that although approximately64% of control siRNA-treated cells repositioned the centrosome in front of the nucleus looking toward the wound, only approximately34% of Galphai3-depleted cells (as was expected in the absence of polarization) achieved the same phenotype (Fig. 3 C). GIV or Galphas-depleted cells were similar to controls. When rGalphai3wt was introduced into Galphai3-depleted cells, the defect in centrosome repositioning was reversed. Using deconvolution microscopy to visualize the plane of the centrosome, we found that both endogenous Galphai3 (Fig. 3 A, a-f) and endogenous (Fig. 3 A, j-l) or overexpressed GIV (Fig. 3 A, g-i) localized at the centrosome with bona fide centrosomal proteins (pericentrin or gamma-tubulin) in HeLa and Cos7 cells. Our finding that both Galphai3 and GIV localize to the centrosome region and only Galphai3 is required for centrosomal repositioning suggests that the latter is a GIV-independent function of Galphai3.

Next, we asked whether Galphai3 regulates GIV's functions in activating Akt and remodeling actin after growth factor stimulation, an approach which mimics scratch wound-induced Akt signaling in a more synchronized fashion (Enomoto et al., 2005). When serum-starved HeLa cells were stimulated with insulin, Akt activity peaked at 5 min and was rapidly down-regulated within 15-30 min in controls (Fig. 4 A). In Galphai3-silenced cells, the peak activation was reduced by approximately60% (Fig. 4, A and B), which is similar to the effect observed after GIV depletion in HeLa (Fig. 4 B) or HepG2 cells (Anai et al., 2005). The effect was Galphai specific because Galphas depletion did not significantly affect Akt activation (Fig. 4 A) and was reversed when rGalphai3wt was restored in Galphai3 siRNA-treated cells (see Fig. 5 B). Therefore, Galphai3 links Akt activation and cell migration in a manner similar to that reported for GIV (Anai et al., 2005). To distinguish whether Galphai3 and GIV function in a common pathway or in independent parallel pathways mediating enhancement of Akt signaling, we investigated the effect of silencing both proteins. Silencing of Galphai3 or GIV alone reduced Akt activation by approximately60 and 80%, respectively (Fig. 4 B). When both were silenced (Fig. 4 B), no significant difference was observed from GIV-depleted cells, indicating that the effect on Akt was not additive. The fact that depletion of Galphai3 promoted weaker inhibition of Akt than GIV suggests that other Gi3-independent pathways might exist in which GIV is a common effector. Akt activation was also impaired when Galphai3-depleted HeLa cells were stimulated with EGF (Fig. S2, available at ), which implicates Galphai3 and GIV in a common pathway mediating Akt activation upon RTK stimulation.

Because PI3K-Akt signaling is associated with actin remodeling during cell migration, we next examined the organization of the actin cytoskeleton in the migration-deficient Galphai3-depleted cells. Phalloidin staining for F-actin (filamentous actin) revealed major differences in actin organization of Galphai3-depleted cells versus that of controls (Fig. 4 C, a and b): the Galphai3-depleted cells were virtually unable to form long stress fibers and displayed a prominent bed of cortical actin but recovered their ability to form stress fibers when transfected with rGalphai3wt-YFP (Fig. 4 C, c and d). We also investigated actin morphology in Galphai3-depleted cells treated with insulin which induces actin remodeling (Ridley et al., 1992) and found that actin remodeling and generation of stress fibers failed to occur upon insulin stimulation (Fig. S3, available at ). Similar results were obtained in GIV-depleted cells using EGF as a ligand (Enomoto et al., 2005). We conclude that Galphai3 plays a major role in the organization of the actin cytoskeleton, most likely via its interaction with GIV, an established actin binding protein.

We next investigated if silencing Galphai3 leads to changes in the distribution of GIV. In quiescent cells treated with scr siRNA, we detected GIV on vesicles in and around the Golgi and scattered throughout the cytoplasm (Fig. 4 D, a). Occasionally, GIV also colocalized with actin stress fibers (Fig. S4, available at ) as reported by Enomoto et al. (2005) in fibroblasts; however, this was an infrequent and inconsistent finding in epithelial cells. We believe that this discrepancy in staining pattern is likely caused by the fact that epithelial cells express lower levels of GIV than mesenchymal cells. Depletion of Galphai3 resulted in a more compact concentration of GIV staining in the Golgi region and reduced peripheral staining (Fig. 4 D, b). This phenotype was reversed when Galphai3-depleted cells were replenished with rGalphai3-YFP (Fig. 4 D, c-e). We conclude that Galphai3 is necessary for redistribution of GIV from the Golgi to more peripheral locations.

Because heterotrimeric G protein signaling is regulated by the activation state of the alpha-subunit, we asked whether activation of Galphai3 is required for its functions during cell migration. We transfected rGalphai3Q204L and rGalphai3G203A mutants, which behave like the GTP- and GDP-bound forms of Galphai3, respectively (Hermouet et al., 1991; Coleman et al., 1994), into Galphai3 depleted cells and assessed their ability to reverse the effects of Galphai3 depletion. Transfection of either Galphai3wt or the active rGalphai3Q204L mutant restored cell migration (Fig. 5 A), Akt activation in response to insulin (Fig. 5 B), formation of stress fibers (Fig. 5 C), and distribution of GIV (Fig. 5 D). Transfection of the inactive mutant rGalphai3G203A had no effect on these parameters (Fig. 5, A-D).

Next, we asked whether the interaction between Galphai3 and GIV is activity dependent and found that the inactive GST-Galphai3G203A mutant consistently bound approximately10-15-fold more GIV than the active Galphai3Q204L mutant in in vitro binding assays using HeLa cell lysates or TnT (in vitro-translated) GIV (Fig. 6 A). We confirmed these results by preloading GST-Galphai3 with GDP alone or in the presence of AlF4-, which mimics the active state (Coleman et al., 1994). In the presence of GDP alone, GST-Galphai3 bound approximately10-30% of the total GIV, and addition of AlF4- virtually abolished the binding (Fig. 6 B). In contrast, GST-Galphas bound approximately100-300-fold less than GST-Galphai3 (Fig. 6 C), which is consistent with our finding that Galphas-depletion had no influence on cell migration (Fig. 1 B), Akt activation (Fig. 4 A), or actin stress fiber formation (not depicted). These results demonstrate that GIV binding is specific for Galphai3 and is greatly reduced upon activation of the G protein. Because inactive GDP-bound Galphai3 interacts with both Gbetagamma and GIV, we asked whether the alpha-subunit can interact with GIV when it is assembled into an intact heterotrimer. That this is the case is suggested by the fact that the Gbeta subunit could be coimmunoprecipitated from brain lysates with GIV antibodies and that this interaction was abolished in the presence of GDP and AlF4- (Fig. 6 D).

Because the active, but not the inactive, Galphai3 mutant reversed the migration-defective phenotype of Galphai3-depleted cells, activation of the G protein seems to be the key event leading to Akt enhancement during cell migration. However, in vitro binding studies showed that GIV preferentially binds to the inactive G protein. Collectively, these observations support a working model whereby in vivo, the functional interaction between the G protein and GIV needs to be reversible as the G protein cycles between active and inactive states.

In addition to being an enhancer of Akt activity, GIV is a substrate for Akt at S1416, and this phosphorylation is critical for the function of GIV in cell migration (Enomoto et al., 2005). Interestingly, S1416 lies within the G binding domain of GIV (Le-Niculescu et al., 2005), raising the question of whether the Galphai3-GIV interaction modulates ser/thr phosphorylation of GIV. We found that in Galphai3-depleted cells GIV was poorly phosphorylated compared with controls (Fig. 7 A). Repletion of Galphai3 with rGalphai3wt restored phosphorylation of GIV to control levels (Fig. 7 A). To determine if the Galphai3-GIV interaction enhanced or interfered with Akt mediated phosphorylation of GIV on S1416, we performed in vitro phosphorylation reactions with immunopurified GIV, GST-Galphai3, and recombinant Akt. Because Akt phosphorylates immunopurified GIV at a single site, i.e., S1416 (Enomoto et al., 2005), p-ser/thr antibody was used to estimate the amount of phosphorylation that occurred. We found that preincubation of GIV with GST-Galphai3G203A, the inactive mutant that binds GIV most avidly, increased the phosphorylation of GIV approximately2.5 fold (Fig. 7 B, lane 6), whereas GST-Galphai3Q204L and GST-Galphai3wt were not significantly different (Fig. 7 B, lanes 4 and 5). We conclude that binding of Galphai3 to GIV promotes phosphorylation of GIV at S1416 by Akt. We reasoned that this is likely via a change in the conformation of GIV that might facilitate access of Akt to S1416. To investigate whether such a change in confirmation takes place, we performed limited proteolysis using increasing amounts of trypsin on immunopurified GIV (Fig. 7 C). GIV preincubated with GST, GST-Galphai3wt, or GST-Galphai3Q204L was relatively resistant to proteolysis, whereas GIV preincubated with Galphai3G203A was more susceptible to proteolysis, indicating a change in the conformation of GIV upon binding the inactive mutant.

Galphai3 is necessary for phosphorylation of GIV by Akt. (A) Phosphorylation of GIV is decreased upon depletion of Galphai3 (Galphai3 siRNA) and restored upon transfecting rGalphai3 (Galphai3 siRNA and rGalphai3). GIV was immunoprecipitated from HeLa cells treated as indicated and phosphorylation determined by immunoblotting with anti-pSer/Thr IgG. (B, top) Galphai3 binding to GIV promotes phosphorylation of GIV at S1416 by Akt. Immunoprecipitated GIV was preincubated in the presence or absence of approximately5 mug GST (lane 3), GST-Galphai3wt (lane 4), Galphai3 Q204L (lane 5), or Galphai3 G203A (lane 6) and subsequently phosphorylated in vitro with recombinant Akt1, followed by SDS-PAGE. Phosphorylation was determined by immunoblotting with anti-pSer IgG. (B, bottom) Equal loading of preimmune or anti-GIV IgG and GST proteins was confirmed by Ponceau S staining. (C) Galphai3 binding to GIV increases its susceptibility to trypsin-mediated proteolysis. Immunoprecipitated GIV was incubated in the presence or absence of GST-Galphai3 proteins as in B and digested with increasing concentrations of trypsin at 37degreesC for 8 min.

We also asked whether phosphorylation of GIV at S1416 affects its binding to Galphai3 and found that this is not the case as wild-type, phosphorylation mimic (S1416D), or nonphosphorylatable (S1416A) GIV all bound preferentially to the inactive G protein with similar strength (Fig. 7 D and Fig. S5, available at ). This indicates that the activation state of the G protein, and not phosphorylation of GIV at S1416, regulates the Galphai3-GIV interaction.

These results show that the Galphai3-GIV interaction facilitates phosphorylation of GIV by Akt. We propose that GIV bound to Galphai3 adopts a conformation that brings Akt (bound to its C terminus) closer to S1416 in the G binding domain and thus facilitates its phosphorylation (Fig. 7 E).

We also investigated the roles of Galphai3 and GIV in other biological processes that require Akt enhancement during cell migration, i.e., macrophage chemotaxis and cancer cell migration. Previous studies have established that Gi and GPCRs are important for Akt activation during chemotaxis in macrophages and neutrophils (Thelen, 2001) and that cancer cell lines, like HeLa, use RTKs for Akt activation during migration in scratch wound assays (Tetreault et al., 2008). To find out how the Galphai3-GIV regulatory complex behaves during cell migration in macrophages, we analyzed THP1 human monocytes before and after tetradecanoyl-phorbol acetate (TPA)-induced differentiation (Collins, 1987) into macrophages. GIV expression increased approximately18-fold at 48 h after TPA induction compared with undifferentiated monocytes, whereas levels of Galphai3 remained unchanged (Fig. 8 A). We then asked if depletion of GIV would impair macrophage chemotaxis induced by activation the Gi-coupled fMLP receptor (Allen et al., 1988). Macrophages were monitored in real time during the rapid phase (0-25 min) of chemotaxis toward a pipette tip continuously releasing fMLP (Fig. 8 B, top; Chen et al., 2006). We found that depletion of either Galphai3 (Fig. 8 B, a-d) or GIV (Fig. 8 B, e and f) inhibited chemotaxis and impaired Akt activation (Fig. 8 C). We conclude that Galphai3 and GIV are essential for Akt signaling during GPCR-stimulated macrophage chemotaxis.

We also investigated the expression pattern of Galphai3 and GIV in cell lines derived from colon adenocarcinoma with variable in vivo metastatic potential. GIV was expressed exclusively in cells with high metastatic potential (HCT116 and DLD1) and was virtually undetectable in those with poor metastatic potential (HT29p and Ls174T; Fig. 8 D), whereas Galphai3 and other regulatory proteins of the G protein pathway, i.e., GAIP (Fig. 8 D), showed no such correlation. As in HeLa cells and macrophages, when highly metastatic DLD1 cells were treated with Galphai3 or GIV siRNA, they demonstrated inefficient migration in scratch wounding assays (Fig. 8 E) and impaired Akt activation (Fig. 8 F) compared with scr siRNA-treated cells. Because cell motility in scratch wound assays and Akt activity are validated predictors of the metastatic potential of tumor cells (Raz, 1988; Qiao et al., 2007), DLD1 cells depleted of Galphai3 or GIV might be expected to have poor metastatic potential compared with the parent cell line. Collectively, these results suggest a broader role for the Galphai3-GIV complex in migratory processes where direction sensing through different chemotactic receptors uses this complex for Akt enhancement, actin remodeling, and cell migration.

This paper describes a novel mechanism by which Galphai3 serves as a molecular switch that dictates the formation of the leading edge during cell migration via regulation of the distribution, phosphorylation, and functions of GIV. Without Galphai3, Akt amplification downstream of both RTK and GPCR failed to occur, actin remodeling was inhibited, and cells failed to undergo polarized migration after scratch wounding. We also showed that Galphai3 localizes preferentially within pseudopods at the leading edge and that activation of Galphai3 is essential for migration. Collectively, these results support a working model (Fig. 9) of how the switch operates in few key steps: inactive Gi3 heterotrimer interacts avidly with GIV and induces a change in the conformation of GIV. Upon a chemotactic stimulus (when Akt signaling is initiated) the Galphai3-bound conformation of GIV facilitates phosphorylation of GIV at a critical Ser residue that is necessary for its functions at the leading edge. Subsequently, activation of Galphai3 triggers dissociation of the Gi3-GIV macromolecular complex releasing Gbetagamma-subunits and GIV simultaneously. Released Gbetagamma participates in localized PI3K-Akt activation (Lilly and Devreotes, 1995), and released GIV amplifies and propagates this Akt signaling (Chen et al., 2003; Postma et al., 2004). Amplification of cellular Akt activity via sequential coupling and uncoupling of Galphai3 and GIV is likely to set up a positive feedback loop that mediates phosphorylation of further GIV molecules to remodel actin and form the leading edge. In this feedback loop, G proteins are presumably directly activated by GPCRs or indirectly transactivated via RTKs.

Working model. (1) GIV preferentially and avidly binds to inactive GDP-bound Galphai3. Interaction with Galphai3 induces a change in conformation of GIV (dotted arrow). In a quiescent cell, this step is likely to occur predominantly on vesicles near the Golgi where Galphai3 and GIV were previously shown to colocalize. (2) Upon a chemotactic stimulus, Akt signaling is initiated and results in phosphorylation of GIV at S1416. This critical phosphorylation step is facilitated by the favorable conformation of GIV induced by direct interaction with Galphai3. Phosphorylation at S1416 was previously shown to be necessary for GIV's functions during cell migration (Enomoto et al., 2005). (3) Upon phosphorylation, GIV continues to preferentially and avidly bind to Galphai3; however, it selectively loses its affinity for PI4P (Enomoto et al., 2005), a phosphoinositide that is enriched in the Golgi, and redistributes from Golgi membranes to the peripheral actin bed near the PM. (4) Activation of Galphai3 occurs, likely downstream of ligand occupied receptors, and is the key event that mediates simultaneous dissociation of Gbetagamma and GIV from the Gi3-GIV complexes. (5) Released Gbetagamma activates PI3K-dependent Akt signaling (Lilly and Devreotes, 1995). (6) Released phospho-GIV enhances the initial Akt signaling (Anai et al., 2005), remodels actin, and promotes migration. (7) This second phase of Akt signal enhancement is critical for formation of the leading edge during polarized cell migration. Cyclical activation and inactivation of Galphai in vivo thus contributes to progressive Akt enhancement, which promotes further cycles of GIV phosphorylation (8 and 2), redistribution of phosphorylated GIV from Golgi to PM/actin (3), and subsequent release from the Gi3-GIV complexes upon activation of Galphai3 (4). This contributes to the previously observed accumulation of phosphorylated GIV at the leading edge (Enomoto et al., 2005) where GIV rapidly remodels actin to generate pseudopods.

Galphai3 and GIV directly interact with each other and share dual localizations on the Golgi and the PM (Enomoto et al., 2005; Le-Niculescu et al., 2005). Our results provide clues as to where in the cell this sequential Galphai3-GIV molecular coupling might occur. In quiescent cells, Galphai3 was predominantly found on the Golgi where it partially colocalizes with GIV (Fig. 1 A), and in migrating cells, Galphai3 redistributes to the cell periphery and is concentrated in pseudopods at the leading edge (Figs. 1 A and 2 A) where phosphorylated GIV accumulates during migration (Enomoto et al., 2005). Additionally, we showed that depletion of Galphai3 leads to accumulation of GIV on Golgi membranes and impairs phosphorylation of GIV at S1416. Previously, phosphorylation of GIV at S1416 by Akt has been demonstrated to specifically result in abolishing GIV's affinity toward PI4P (Enomoto et al., 2005), a lipid known to be enriched in Golgi membranes. Based on these findings, we postulate that GIV phosphorylation at S1416, which is facilitated by the Galphai3-GIV interaction, mediates the redistribution of GIV from the Golgi to the cell periphery. Mobilization of this internal pool of Galphai3-bound GIV to the cell periphery sets the stage for G protein activation and subsequent release of phosphorylated GIV.

Because the active Q204L, but not the inactive G203A, Galphai3 mutant reversed the phenotype of Galphai3-depleted cells, activation of the G protein emerges as the key event in its functioning as a molecular switch. In the absence of Galphai3 or after expression of inactive Galphai3, Akt signaling does not occur (Figs. 4 A and 5 B), indicating that the most significant and direct downstream consequence of Galphai3 activation is Akt enhancement. As a consequence of this failure to enhance Akt signaling, phosphorylation of GIV on S1416, redistribution of GIV to the cell periphery, actin remodeling, and cell migration failed to occur (Figs. 4 and 5). Because activation of Galphai3 was necessary for migration, it came as a surprise that in in vitro binding assays the inactive G protein binds GIV approximately10-15-fold more than the active mutant. Collectively, our results suggest that the weaker interaction between the active Galphai3 mutant and GIV is sufficient to facilitate targeting, phosphorylation, and the functions of GIV in vivo. Conversely, our finding that a strong interaction between the inactive G protein and GIV has an overall inhibitory effect on GIV's functions indicates that reversible coupling is essential for normal functioning of the switch. We conclude that the Galphai3-GIV association constitutes an "on" and "off" switch that is regulated by cyclical G protein activation and is essential for phosphorylation, targeting, and subsequent release of GIV during cell migration.

We show here that the Galphai3-GIV association is required for phosphorylation of GIV at S1416 by Akt. Phosphorylation of GIV at this site was previously demonstrated to play a critical role in cell migration, but the mechanism was unclear (Enomoto et al., 2005). We provide evidence that GIV undergoes a change in conformation when bound to Galphai3. It is noteworthy that the Akt binding site on GIV (extreme C terminus) is separated from S1416 (which lies within the G binding domain) by approximately300 aa (Anai et al., 2005). We speculate that a major molecular rearrangement occurs when GIV binds Galphai3 to bring Akt bound to the carboxyl terminus closer to S1416 in the G binding domain and, thus, facilitates its phosphorylation. We also show that activation of Galphai3 rather than phosphorylation of GIV is the key trigger for dissociation of GIV from the Galphai-GIV complex.

In the context of when these events take place, our results provide evidence that the cycling of G protein between active and inactive states ensures that phosphorylation of Galphai3-bound GIV precedes its subsequent release from the complex. In a highly polarized chemotaxing cell, this is likely to occur on the PM at the leading edge where there is a concentration of ligand-occupied receptors, activated Akt, and activated Galphai3 (Ridley et al., 2003; Van Haastert and Devreotes, 2004). Thus, the G protein molecular switch contributes to the spatial bias in accumulation of phosphorylated GIV that was previously demonstrated to occur selectively at the leading edge (Enomoto et al., 2005).

We found that Galphai3 through its interaction with GIV is required for Akt enhancement and actin remodeling during scratch wound-induced migration in epithelial cells and for rapid chemotaxis in macrophages. However, in D. discoideum the Galpha-subunit is dispensable and only Gbetagamma-subunits are required for PI3K-Akt activation at the leading edge during GPCR-stimulated migration (Lilly and Devreotes, 1995; Brzostowski et al., 2004). It is noteworthy that there is only one Gbetagamma subunit in D. discoideum (Lilly and Devreotes, 1995) and, to the best of our knowledge, there is no homologue of GIV. Thus, the differences between HeLa cells and D. discoideum may represent an acquired function of Galphai in mammals, as the number of G proteins and their interacting partners expanded during evolution.

We found that during cell migration, Galphai3 preferentially localizes to the leading edge where enhancement of Akt signaling occurs (Merlot and Firtel, 2003). It is well established that to form a leading edge and migrate, cells must display biphasic Akt activation in response to a chemotactic stimulus in that a brief early phase of generalized Akt activation is followed by an enhanced and prolonged phase. The second phase of enhancement creates a steep PI3K-Akt signaling gradient that is restricted to the stretch of PM destined to form the leading edge (Chen et al., 2003; Postma et al., 2004). However, the uniformity of distribution of chemotactic receptors (RTKs and GPCRs; Servant et al., 1999; Bailly et al., 2000) and shallow anterior-posterior gradient of Gbeta subunits (Jin et al., 2000) fails to account for this steep signaling gradient (Xiao et al., 1997; Janetopoulos et al., 2001; Ueda et al., 2001). Our observation of preferential accumulation of Galphai3 together with the localization of phospho-GIV at the leading edge (Enomoto et al., 2005) sets the stage for sequential signal amplification by placing the Galpha-subunit in the immediate vicinity of the ligand-occupied receptors that can activate G proteins. Activation of Galphai3 accounts for a major part of Akt signaling (approximately60% of the peak Akt activity upon insulin/EGF stimulation) via regulation of GIV, indicating that although Gbetagamma-subunits initiate Akt signaling through activation of PI3K (Lilly and Devreotes, 1995), accumulation of simultaneously released phosphorylated GIV is essential for localized enhancement of Akt at the leading edge via the PI3K-Akt pathway (Xiao et al., 1997; Anai et al., 2005; Enomoto et al., 2005). Thus, our work provides mechanistic insights into how activation of Galphai3 links direction sensing to GIV-mediated PI3K-Akt enhancement and actin remodeling at the leading edge.

We found that both Galphai3 and GIV are localized on centrosomes and are necessary for polarized migration, whereas Galphai3, but not GIV, is required for repositioning the MTOC/centrosome. In contrast, GIV is required for polarized migration but is not essential for centrosome repositioning. This is in keeping with the fact that asymmetrical extension of lamellipodia and centrosome repositioning are not necessarily coupled during polarized migration of epithelial cells (Euteneuer and Schliwa, 1992). Our results suggest a distinct hierarchy within the Galphai3-GIV regulatory complex, in which Galphai3 regulates additional steps during cell migration besides those performed by GIV. The role of centrosomal GIV could be to nucleate microtubule tracks to the leading edge because, like other members of the Hook family, GIV can bind to microtubules (Simpson et al., 2005).

GIV has been implicated in RTK-stimulated migration (Enomoto et al., 2005), and Gi is well known to be important for GPCR-stimulated chemotaxis (Thelen, 2001). Our results now demonstrate that activation of Galphai3 is required during scratch wound-induced migration where cross talk between GPCRs and RTKs are known to mediate chemotactic movements (Shan et al., 2006; Yin et al., 2007). Similarly, we have shown that upon direct stimulation with RTK ligands (insulin and EGF), activation of Galphai3 is required to elicit a full response in terms of Akt activation, suggesting that prominent transactivation of G proteins takes place. Additionally, we provide evidence supporting the necessity for GIV during GPCR-stimulated Akt signaling or chemotaxis. Although indirect stimulation of some RTKs by GPCR-G protein-dependent intermediates is well established (Luttrell et al., 1999), there is little mechanistic insight into how RTK stimulation might directly signal via G proteins to activate Akt (Waters et al., 2004; Dhanasekaran, 2006). In this paper, we show that in epithelial cells during wound healing, chemotaxing macrophages, and tumor cells, the state-dependent interaction between Galphai3 and GIV is essential, and upon depletion of either of these proteins the critical step of amplification of Akt signaling is abrogated.
###end p 60
###begin p 61
We conclude that regardless of how the chemotactic signal is propagated from the cell surface to initiate Akt signaling, the common theme is the requirement of Galphai3 activation and GIV to promote cell migration. Although we cannot rule out that different biochemical events may occur depending on whether GPCRs or RTKs are activated, it is tempting to speculate that molecular coupling between Galphai3 and GIV could serve as a novel platform for receptor cross talk and that together they could be the long-sought missing link between chemotactic receptors and signal amplification.

Plasmid DNA and siRNA transfection of HeLa, DLD1, or THP-1 (Kilpatrick et al., 2006) cells was performed using FUGENE 6 (Roche) or Oligofectamine (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturers' protocols. For Galphai3-YFP and mpYFP transfection, GeneJuice (EMD) was used. Oligos against human Galphai3 were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., and oligos against human GIV (Enomoto et al., 2005), Galphas long, and Galphas short (Zheng et al., 2004; Enomoto et al., 2005) were custom designed by Thermo Fisher Scientific. When reversal of phenotype was attempted, overexpression was performed 8-10 h after siRNA transfection, and cells were analyzed after approximately38-40 h. In those assays where siRNA was followed by plasmid overexpression, the efficiency of transfection was approximately45-55%.

Monolayer cell cultures (approximately100% confluent) were wounded with a 1-ml sterile pipette tip creating a 1-mm wound, as previously described (Enomoto et al., 2005), and monitored by phase contrast or time-lapse video microscopy over the succeeding 12-16 h. For rapid chemotaxis assays, THP1 cells were differentiated using 5 nM TPA. Upon reaching confluency, half of the plate was scraped, and cells were monitored by phase-contrast microscopy during the succeeding 25 min as they migrated toward a steady chemoattractant gradient generated by releasing 100 muM fMLP (Sigma-Aldrich) from a micropipette tip placed on the opposite side of the plate.

All the steps for IF were performed at room temperature as described previously (Zheng et al., 2004). In brief, cells were fixed with 3% PFA for 30 min, permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100 for 45 min, and incubated for 1 h with primary and secondary antibodies. Antibody dilutions were as follows: affinity purified anti-GIV, 1:10; anti-Galphai3 (EMD), 1:30; anti-V5 (Invitrogen), 1:200; anti-ManII, 1:500; anti-pericentrin, 1:1,000; anti-gamma-tubulin (Sigma-Aldrich), 1:500; anti-betaGALT, 1:20; Phalloidin-Texas Red, 1:1,000; secondary Alexa-conjugated antibodies, 1:500; and DAPI, 1:2,000 (Invitrogen). To visualize endogenous GIV or Galphai3, cells were permeabilized with 0.05% (weight/vol) saponin and 0.2 mg/ml BSA in PBS for 1 min before fixation.

For the centrosome repositioning assay, HeLa-C1 monolayers were scratch wounded, and 8-10 h after wounding the number of cells with centrosomal (GFP-centrin) and Golgi (ManII) positioning within the 120degrees sector facing the wound were counted (Fig. 2; Kupfer et al., 1982; Etienne-Manneville and Hall, 2001; Grande-Garcia et al., 2007).

For centrosomal localization studies, wide-field microscopy was performed using the 100x 1.3 N.A Neofluor oil immersion objective lenses on an inverted microscope (IX-70 DeltaVision Restoration; Olympus). The microscope was equipped with DAPI (360/40 excitation, 457/50 emission), FITC (490/20 excitation, 528/38 emission), and TRITC (555/28 excitation, 617/73 emission) band pass filter sets, a motorized stage (FCS2; Bioptechs), and a charge-coupled device camera (Photometrics CH350; Hamamatsu Photonics). Optical sections were collected at 0.2-mum intervals along the apical-basal axis. Applied Precision software (DeltaVision) was used to deconvolve z-section series of images. All individual images were processed using Image J software and assembled for presentation using Photoshop and Illustrator software (both Adobe).

Proteins samples were separated on 10% SDS-PAGE and transferred to PVDF membranes (Millipore). Membranes were blocked with PBS supplemented with 5% nonfat milk and then incubated sequentially with primary and secondary antibodies. Infrared imaging with two-color detection and quantification of Western blots was performed according to the manufacturer's protocols using an Odyssey imaging system (Li-Cor Biosciences). When anti-phosphoprotein antibodies (anti-pSer/Thr or anti-pAkt) were used, nonfat milk was replaced by BSA throughout the process. The dilution of the primary antibodies was as follows: anti-GIV serum, 1:500; anti-Galphai3, 1:200; anti-Galphas, 1:250; anti-actin, 1:2,000; anti-Akt total, 1:250; anti-pAkt, 1:250; anti-pSer, 1:250; anti-Galpha, 1:200.

Fig. S1 shows validation that Galphai3 is preferentially localized within pseudopods at the leading edge during cell migration using DiD as a PM marker. Fig. S2 shows that depletion of Galphai3 impairs EGF-stimulated Akt activation. Fig. S3 shows that insulin-stimulated actin remodeling is inhibited in Galphai3-depleted cells. Fig. S4 shows that GIV is occasionally distributed along actin stress fibers in epithelial cells. Fig. S5 shows that activation status of the G protein, and not phosphorylation of GIV at S1416, regulates the Galphai3-GIV interaction. Video 1 shows that HeLa cells expressing rGalphai3-YFP demonstrate directional migration toward the wound whereas Galphai3-depleted cells show random motility. Video 2 shows that Galphai3-YFP preferentially localizes within pseudopods at the leading edge of a migrating HeLa cell. Video 3 shows that mp-YFP is distributed along the PM during polarized cell migration, with no preference for the leading edge. Online supplemental material is available at .
