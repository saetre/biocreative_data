During the splicing process, spliceosomal snRNAs undergo numerous conformational rearrangements that appear to be catalyzed by proteins belonging to the DEAD/H-box superfamily of RNA helicases. We have cloned a new RNA helicase gene, designated DBP2 (DEAH-boxprotein), homologous to the Schizosaccaromyces pombe cdc28(+)/prp8(+) gene involved in pre-mRNA splicing and cell cycle progression. The full-length DBP2 contains 3400 nucleotides and codes for a protein of 1041 amino acids with a calculated mol. wt of 119 037 Da. Transfection experiments demonstrated that the GFP-DBP2 gene product, transiently expressed in HeLa cells, was localized in the nucleus. The DBP2 gene was mapped by FISH to the MHC region on human chromosome 6p21.3, a region where many malignant, genetic and autoimmune disease genes are linked. Because the expression of DBP2 gene in S.pombe prp8 mutant cells partially rescued the temperature-sensitive phenotype, we conclude that DBP2 is a functional human homolog of the fission yeast Cdc28/Prp8 protein.
