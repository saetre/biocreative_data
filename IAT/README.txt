PMCID <=> PMID

Takuya Matsuzaki
==================
The data is here:
/works/mlesna3a/medie-admin/data-2009/medline09n*/

You can find gene/protein recognition results in "*.gene-ne.so.gz" files, and
get PMIDs from "*.bib.so" files.

The "bib" tags appear at the beginnings of articles. So you can get the
GENA-ID --> PMID index by combining the two files.

The GENA data is here:

Han-Cheol san:

How often will the dictionary be updated?

Can you provide an example for this:
After the installation of the libraries is finished, you need to add the path to these libraries to the LD_LIBRARY_PATH  environmental variable.

How difficult would it be to integrate the installation of these three programs into on Makefile?

Can you provide an example file called "test.txt"?
E.g:
I love p53 proteins.

Can you add a parent folder "models" to all the files in model.xxx.tar and xxx.tar files, and change the suffix to .tgz, since they are actually tar-gzipped files?


SAMPO PYYSALO
=====================
Remember where the species info comes from
merged-species-ascii -> /home/zonen/smp/data/BioCreative3/IAT/merged


Okazaki-san
=========================
Remember where the gene normalisation info comes from:
GNSuite.txt -> /home/wijs/okazaki/research/bc3iat/bc3iat-20100818.txt
