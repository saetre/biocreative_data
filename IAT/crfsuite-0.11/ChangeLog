2009-03-10  Naoaki Okazaki  <okazaki at chokkan org>
	* CRFsuite 0.7
	- Updated RumAVL library to 4.0.0; this fixes a crash problem occurring in feature generation on some machine architectures.

	
2009-03-07  Naoaki Okazaki  <okazaki at chokkan org>
	* CRFsuite 0.6
	- A new training algorithm, Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD).
	- Updated the L-BFGS routine to liblbfgs 1.7.
	- Reduced memory usage in training.
	- Supported escape sequences in training/test data.
	- Restructured the source code.
	- Added a parameter to configure the number of trials for line search.

	
2008-11-19  Naoaki Okazaki  <okazaki at chokkan org>
	* CRFsuite 0.5
	- Updated the L-BFGS routine to liblbfgs 1.6.
	- New parameters lbfgs.stop, lbfgs.delta, lbfgs.linesearch were added.
	- Fixed a bug in which the frontend tools could not parse "item:value" format correctly.
	- Fixed a bug in computing the accuracy.
	- Fixed a bug when the tagger receives an item with no feature.
