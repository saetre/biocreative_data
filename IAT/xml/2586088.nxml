The principles that assure selective targeting of the DCC are unknown. According to a prevalent model, X chromosome targeting is initiated by recruitment of the DCC core components, MSL1 and MSL2, to a limited number of so-called &#x0201c;high-affinity sites&#x0201d; (HAS). Only very few such sites are known at the DNA sequence level, which has precluded the definition of DCC targeting principles. Combining RNA interference against DCC subunits, limited crosslinking, and chromatin immunoprecipitation coupled to probing high-resolution DNA microarrays, we identified a set of 131 HAS for MSL1 and MSL2 and confirmed their properties by various means. The HAS sites are distributed all over the X chromosome and are functionally important, since the extent of dosage compensation of a given gene and its proximity to a HAS are positively correlated. The sites are mainly located on non-coding parts of genes and predominantly map to regions that are devoid of nucleosomes. In contrast, the bulk of DCC binding is in coding regions and is marked by histone H3K36 methylation. Within the HAS, repetitive DNA sequences mainly based on GA and CA dinucleotides are enriched. Interestingly, DCC subcomplexes bind a small number of autosomal locations with similar features.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><p>In sexually dimorphic species, unequal distribution of sex chromosomes requires adjustment of gene expression levels between the sexes. Male flies enhance transcription from the single X chromosome to meet the levels in females (XX). The specific recognition of sex chromosomes is a crucial step in this dosage compensation process. Intuitively, one might assume that sex chromosomes harbor distinct DNA sequence motifs for recruitment of the modulating machinery; however, no clearly defined motifs capable of fulfilling this role have yet been found. One explanation for this shortcoming could be our failure to date to identify a sufficiently large set of sites that serve as specific docking stations. In the following study, we have systematically mapped the strongest recruitment sites of the <italic>Drosophila</italic> dosage compensation complex (DCC) and identified shared sequence elements. The closer a gene resides to one of these sites the more robust is regulation by the DCC, which documents the function of our inventory of high-affinity binding sites.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="14"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Genes residing on the single X chromosome in male <italic>Drosophila</italic> flies are transcribed at elevated rates to match the expression levels of the two X chromosomes in female cells. Transcriptional tuning in male cells depends on the activity of a ribonucleoprotein complex, the dosage compensation complex (DCC, also referred to as MSL &#x0005b;male-specific lethal&#x0005d; complex, reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000302-Lucchesi1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000302-Straub1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>). Formation of DCC is male-specific due to the expression of the key subunit MSL2, which in turn drives the expression of the non-coding RNA components of the DCC, the roX (RNA on the X) RNAs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000302-Meller1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000302-Rattner1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>. The complex associates almost exclusively with the X chromosome, which explains the selective activation of X chromosomal genes. This is at least in part due to the acetylation of lysine 16 of histone H4 (H4K16) by the histone acetyltransferase (HAT) MOF, an integral subunit of the DCC <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000302-Hilfiker1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>.

A key question is how the DCC is recruited specifically to the X chromosome. High-resolution mapping demonstrated that the complex targets transcriptionally active regions on the X chromosome with a preference for coding sequences <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000302-Alekseyenko1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000302-Gilfillan1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>. The DCC distribution pattern cannot be easily explained by a single targeting principle, but presumably results from the successive application of two or more distinct principles. Early genetic experiments led to a concept that assumes the existence of a relatively small number of X chromosome-specific primary recruitment or chromosomal &#x02018;entry&#x02019; sites (CES) for the DCC, from which the complex would &#x02018;spread&#x02019; to the bulk of chromosomal binding sites that differ qualitatively from the entry sites <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000302-Kelley1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000302-Oh1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>. Entry sites could, for example, be defined by a particular DNA sequence element, whereas features of active chromatin combined with proximity to entry sites would be a hallmark of secondary sites. Subsequent studies disputed whether DCC binding sites should be sorted into categories defined by different recruitment principles, or whether all targeting could be explained by a single principle (e.g. DNA sequence) that was applied to define sites of higher or lower affinity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000302-Dahlsveen1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000302-Fagegaltier1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000302-Oh2">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000302-Demakova1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>. Independent of whether primary recruitment sites differ from the bulk of DCC binding sites in quality or by a quantitative feature, they attract the DCC under stringent conditions. For example, DCC is recruited to high-affinity sites (HAS) even if they are removed from the X chromosomal context and inserted on an autosome, or at low levels of DCC (genetically achieved through expression of low amounts of MSL2) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000302-Demakova1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000302-Kelley2">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>, or if the integral DCC subunits MSL3, MLE, MOF or the roX RNAs are absent <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000302-Gu1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000302-Lyman1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000302-Meller2">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>.

Evidently, distribution of DCC to sites of supposedly lower affinity depends on MOF, MSL3, MLE and the roX RNAs.</p><p>More recently, Kuroda and colleagues obtained additional support for the concept that primary and secondary DCC binding sites are defined by different principles by showing that the binding to active chromatin in the vicinity of primary targeting sites is not X-specific <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000302-Larschan1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>. Insertion of a <italic>roX</italic> gene in an autosome leads to extended &#x02018;spreading&#x02019; of the DCC over the neighboring chromatin (both <italic>roX</italic> genes contain a HAS <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000302-Kelley1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000302-Park1">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref>). Under these circumstances, the DCC associated with transcribed sequences on autosomes like it normally does on the X chromosome. Recruitment of DCC was suggested to involve binding to methylated histone H3 at lysine 36 (H3K36me3), a modification that is placed by histone methyltransferases associated with elongating RNA polymerase II (pol II) and hence marks sites of active transcription <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000302-Larschan1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>X chromosome-specific targeting may, therefore, be encoded by primary targeting sites. So far, just a few DNA elements that robustly fulfill the criteria for a primary targeting site have been characterized at the DNA sequence level. These include sites within the roX genes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000302-Park1">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000302-Kageyama1">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref>, the Smr and Tao-1 genes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000302-Dahlsveen1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref> as well as a site that maps to cytological position 18D <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000302-Oh2">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>. Due to this limited number, a defining feature with predictive value could not be extracted, although the presence of multiple distinct DNA sequence elements has been correlated with HAS <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000302-Park1">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000302-Gilfillan2">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref>. Strikingly, low complexity sequence elements such as GA- and CA-based dinucleotide repeats as well as runs of adenines have repeatedly been noted in these analyses <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000302-Gilfillan1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000302-Dahlsveen1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000302-Gilfillan2">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref>. Dissection of HAS DNA has yielded sub-fragments that retain limited binding activity. We therefore suggested that primary targeting is based on the local clustering of distinct sequence motifs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000302-Dahlsveen1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000302-Gilfillan2">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Progress on HAS definition requires moving the analysis from the anecdotal to the systematic level. We therefore mapped all DCC binding sites with highest affinities on a chromosome-wide scale by combining chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) with probing of high-resolution DNA tiling arrays (ChIP-on-chip) under conditions where sites of higher affinity are preferentially visualized. This strategy not only allowed the generation of a sufficiently large training set for sequence analysis, but at the same time provided a means to directly compare the high affinity binding pattern with several chromatin features that have already been mapped along the <italic>Drosophila</italic> male X chromosome.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><p>We followed two complementary strategies for filtering the DCC binding sites with highest affinity from the chromosome-wide binding profile. First, we attempted to reproduce in male tissue culture cells the conditions that lead to selective visualization of HAS on polytene chromosomes in mutant larvae, where MSL1 and MSL2 interact selectively with HAS in the absence of MSL3, MLE or MOF <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000302-Dahlsveen1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000302-Gu1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000302-Lyman1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>. Towards this goal we reduced the levels of these factors in the male <italic>Drosophila</italic> cell line SL2 by RNA interference (RNAi) and monitored the residual interaction of MSL1 or MSL2 (genetic studies have established the mutual interdependence of these two subunits for their interactions with the bulk of X chromosomal sites <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000302-Lyman1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>). The second strategy followed the idea that HAS should, on average, show a higher occupancy by DCC and hence should be selectively obtained by ChIP if the extent of formaldehyde crosslinking was reduced. Lower levels of crosslinking should also reveal sites of more intimate contact of MSL proteins with DNA. Reassuringly, both strategies led to a similar alteration of the MSL binding pattern with enhanced peaks along all previously known HAS. The combined data should therefore help to define an inventory of sites with similar properties.</p><sec id="s2a"><title>Coding Sequences Have the Least Affinity for the DCC</title><p>We lowered the levels of MSL3, MLE and MOF in SL2 cells by RNAi and mapped the residual binding pattern of the DCC core components MSL1 and MSL2 by ChIP-on-chip. All knock-down experiments were controlled for non-specific effects by a parallel RNAi treatment with an irrelevant dsRNA (which corresponds to glutathione-S-transferase (GST) sequences: &#x02018;GST RNAi&#x02019;). After 7 days of treatment with double-stranded (ds) RNA we achieved approx. 90&#x00025; depletion of the target proteins as compared to the RNAi GST control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000302-g001">Figures 1A &#x00026; B</xref>). Removal of MLE also led to reduction of MSL3 levels. Furthermore, RNAi-mediated depletion of MLE, MSL3 and MOF resulted in a substantial reduction of MSL1 to as little as 20&#x00025;, indicating a global destabilization of the complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000302-g001">Figure 1C</xref>). A similar drop in protein levels was observed for MSL2 (not shown). These circumstances should further facilitate selecting binding sites of only the highest affinity.</p><fig id="pgen-1000302-g001" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pgen.1000302.g001</object-id><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>Confirmation of RNAi target depletion by western blotting.</title><p>Effect of (A) MOF RNAi on MOF and (B) MLE and MSL3 RNAi on corresponding protein levels.

We therefore first investigated the residual MSL1 profile after RNAi against MLE or MSL3 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000302.s001">Figure S1</xref>). The chromosomal interaction profile showed surprisingly mild effects: only 6 and 9&#x00025; of all significant MSL1 binding events were lost upon MSL3 or MLE depletion, respectively. On all MSL1 target probes we observed a moderate reduction of MSL1 signals (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000302.s001">Figure S1C</xref>). Conceivably, the remaining DCC subunits after incomplete knockdown may suffice to sustain MSL1 binding. However, in light of results from the analysis of mutant fly strains we consider more likely that the ChIP-on-chip methodology underestimates homogeneous inter-array differences and therefore might obscure a global reduction of MSL1 binding under knockdown conditions. This would be due to disproportional procedures such as array hybridization and scanning as well as signal normalization across arrays. Visual inspection of the binding pattern, however, allowed for the identification of loci where MSL1 association was substantially reduced (such as the small gene cluster in the right half of <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000302.s001">Figure S1A</xref>). This indicates, that MSL3 and MLE RNAi cause a local redistribution of MSL1, which should contribute to the identification of high affinity regions that are supposed to be more resistant to these perturbations. In the case of MSL3, examination of the loss of MSL1 binding within distinct functional regions revealed a significantly stronger reduction in coding sequences as compared to other binding regions (p-value&#x0003c;2.2e-16; two-sided t-test; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000302.s001">Figure S1C</xref>, right green box).</p><p>We next explored the usefulness of our second strategy and established the MSL2 binding profile at lower levels of formaldehyde crosslinking. We fixed cells with only 0.1&#x00025; instead of 1&#x00025; of formaldehyde (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref> for details). Crosslinking with low concentrations of formaldehyde, we lost about 50&#x00025; of significant MSL2 binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000302-g002">Figure 2B</xref>), which preferentially affected coding sequences (p-value&#x0003c;2.2e-16; two-sided t-test; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000302-g002">Figures 2C and D</xref>). We were encouraged by the fact that all genetically identified HAS were retained among the residual MSL2 peaks.

These are depleted of nucleosomes, in analogy to X chromosomal HAS: probes within the autosomal binding sites show significantly reduced histone H3 content (p-value&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;3.4e-14; two-sided t-test). Sequence analysis of the autosomal sites with strongest MSL1 binding revealed dinucleotide repeats (mainly GA and CA) similar to the ones that characterize the X chromosomal HAS (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000302.s006">Datasets S1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000302.s007">S2</xref>). One notable difference between MSL1 binding sites on the X and on autosomes is that whereas X chromosomal HAS usually display a rather broad MSL1 distribution, MSL1 binding at autosomal sites is spatially restricted and does not spread substantially onto the adjacent active chromatin, even at sites where all tested complex components colocalize (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000302-g007">Figure 7B</xref>). This is confirmed globally by the autocorrelation of MSL1 binding on a smoothed profile with a spacing of 500 bases, which shows that binding domains on the X are much broader than those on autosomes &#x0005b;compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000302-g007">Figures 7E and F</xref>, autocorrelation (ACF) of &#x0003e;0.5 within 10 kb (X) or of 0.5 at a maximum of 2 kb (3R)&#x0005d;, the latter most likely reflecting rather restricted or singular binding events blurred by the ChIP resolution of about 500 bases.

This set of sites contains all previously identified HAS (or chromosomal entry sites, CES) and a representative selection colocalizes with interbands on polytene chromosomes that had been described as harboring primary binding sites for the DCC in previous genetic analyses. The sites we now identified thus have similar properties to the ones identified by genetic means. Our study not only provides a much large number of such sites, but also resolves their positions and widths much more precisely than enabled by the polytene chromosome analyses. Most importantly, our study suggests that the HAS have a function in dosage compensation since we observe a positive correlation between the proximity of genes to a HAS and the extent of dosage compensation. Conversely, the further away genes reside from the nearest HAS the more they depend on the spreading factors such as MOF or MSL3 for enhancement of transcription. The 130 X-chromosomal HAS are distributed all along the chromosome with a predominant spacing between 60 and 300 kb. The realm within which loci profit from the presence of a high affinity &#x02018;DCC attraction center&#x02019; may be of the same order of magnitude. However, we generated the inventory of HAS by applying fairly stringent thresholding criteria. Less stringent selection criteria will undoubtedly reveal a large number of sites with degenerate features and lower affinities that may serve as &#x02018;relay stations&#x02019; for DCC spreading and may contribute cumulatively to concentration of the DCC on the X chromosome<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000302-Straub2">&#x0005b;27&#x0005d;</xref>.

Our observation that a transcribed region upstream of the <italic>Nej</italic> gene harbors a strong site in our set of binding sites but is not occupied in polytene chromosomes may, therefore, be due to differences in the transcription status between salivary glands and SL2 cells. Selection for sites of higher affinity leads to preferential loss of DCC from coding sequences, and under low-crosslinking conditions the majority of DCC binds at non-coding sequences in UTRs, introns, and also outside of the transcribed sequences in presumed regulatory and intergenic regions. Apparently, coding sequences have a lower affinity than non-coding sequences. At least part of the attraction of the DCC to transcribed sequences is due to the histone H3K36me3 mark, which is co-transcriptionally placed by Set2 and may provide a docking site for MSL3 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000302-Larschan1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>.

If coding regions contain sequence elements that bind DCC they may, therefore, be of lower affinity and hence be preferentially lost as the stringency of the selection increases.</p><p>Sequence analysis of the HAS did not lead to the identification of a single motif that could explain the HAS interaction pattern.

The results of the sequence analysis fluctuate considerably depending on the selected training set, the analysis parameters and algorithms used.

Even though they used <italic>Drosophila</italic> embryos and different experimental approaches (e.g. genetic knockouts instead of RNAi and Solexa sequencing in addition to tiling array analysis) the results of the two studies match surprisingly well. In fact, 90 of our 130 X-chromosomal HAS perfectly overlap with the chromosomal entry sites (CES) from the Kuroda lab (the differences in sites may well be explained by the different transcriptional status of the cells/embryos employed in the two studies). The GA-based sequence motif that we found enriched in the HAS perfectly covers the consensus MSL response element of the Kuroda lab and they also observe a comparable histone depletion among their HAS.

So far, a direct interaction of DCC subunits with specific DNA elements cannot be excluded. Further, DCC targeting may rely on interaction with an accessory protein with appropriate sequence preference, such as Pipsqueak or the GAGA factor (GAF) encoded by the <italic>Trithorax-like</italic> (<italic>Trl</italic>) gene. These two GAG-binding proteins colocalize at numerous sites on polytene chromosomes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000302-Schwendemann1">&#x0005b;30&#x0005d;</xref>.

Interestingly, we find that the HAS, independent of whether they are located in regulatory regions, introns or outside of transcribed sequences, tend to be depleted of nucleosomes. Nucleosome depletion alone is not a stringent determinant of DCC association since many sites of low nucleosome density do not contain HAS or are not bound by the complex. Conversely, not all HAS are entirely nucleosome-free. Nevertheless, an improved definition of HAS may require considering the degree of nucleosome occupancy of sites in addition to the actual sequence itself.

In the latter scenario the absence of nucleosomes would be a consequence of DCC binding rather than a requirement for interaction.

First, we observed an altered stoichiometry of MSL proteins at autosomal sites, which often appear to lack MSL2. At these sites the colocalization of MSL1, MSL2 and MOF is the exception rather than the rule, suggesting that the known interdependence of MSL1 and MSL2 for chromosome association <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000302-Lyman1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref> is not absolute, but context-dependent. Second, binding of MSL proteins to autosomal sites appears unusually confined and does not spread onto the adjacent active chromatin as is commonly observed for X-chromosomal HAS. Lack of spreading is also found in the presence of MSL2. Because the distribution of MSL proteins from initial targeting sites is strongly facilitated by transcription of roX RNA from the same chromosome <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000302-Kelley1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000302-Larschan1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000302-Park2">&#x0005b;35&#x0005d;</xref>, we speculate that autosomal sites may be bound by MSL proteins in the absence of roX RNAs.</p><p>Our data are consistent with a multi-step model of X chromosomal targeting by the DCC, which involves assembly of the complex with nascent roX RNA within the X chromosomal territory, followed by its diffusion to and concentration by the set of HAS, which we have identified in this study. Distribution to all target genes may then be brought about by large numbers of low affinity sites and the transcription-associated H3K36 methyl mark.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title><italic>Drosophila</italic> Cell Culture and RNA Interference</title><p>Cultivation of the male <italic>Drosophila</italic> cell line SL2 and RNA interference of target genes were carried out as described previously <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000302-Straub3">&#x0005b;36&#x0005d;</xref>.

Alternatively we used 0.1&#x00025; formaldehyde for 10 minutes at RT (low formaldehyde crosslinking). Fixation was quenched by addition of glycine to a final concentration of 125 mM. After washing, cells were resuspended in RIPA buffer and sonicated using a Bioruptor (Diagenode, Belgium) 8 times 30 seconds using the &#x02018;high&#x02019; setting. Fragment size of the obtained chromatin was checked to be between 300 bp and 700 bp. Chromatin was precleared using a protein A/protein G-sepharose mixture for 1 hr at 4&#x000b0;C. 200 &#x000b5;l chromatin was incubated with appropriate amounts of antibodies in a total volume of 500 &#x000b5;l RIPA buffer at 4&#x000b0;C overnight. After washing and crosslink reversal, immunprecipitated nucleic acids were purified on GFX columns (GE Healthcare). Input chromatin serving as reference sample was treated accordingly. Overall, we performed immunoprecipitations for MSL1 (4 biological replicates) and MSL2 (2 replicates) on chromatin from untreated SL2 cells. In addition, we precipitated MSL1-containg chromatin after GST, MSL3, or MLE RNAi (2 replicates each).
