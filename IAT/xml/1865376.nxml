Neural plate induction is evident as thickening of epiblasts to form neuroectoderm. However, the precise interplay between the molecular pathways responsible for nervous system induction are less apparent. Early specification of central epiblasts to a neural fate is influenced by fibroblast growth factor (FGF) production while induction of non-neural epithelium in the periphery occurs through wingless-type (Wnt) and bone morphogenic protein (BMP) expression. FGF along with molecules that emanate from the organizer (Noggin, Follistatin and Chordin) later serves to limit BMP expression to the neural/epidermal border and thus maintain neural plate boundaries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Maturation of the neural plate/neuroectoderm reenlists developmental pathways that are recycled to function as directors of proliferation, migration or establish repulsive/attractive environments within synaptogenesis. For example, after initial induction of the CNS, FGFs are subsequently re-utilized to maintain caudal progenitors by inhibiting differentiation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>], and later establish repulsive (FGF-8) versus attractive (FGF-4) environments to aid in directing cell migration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. Finally, FGFs are again used in CNS maturation by orchestrating neuronal networking through synaptogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>].</p><p>Once established, the CNS has limited regenerative capacity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Inhibitory factors associated with myelin are released after CNS damage and block axonal outgrowth. Several potent myelin-associated inhibitors of neurite outgrowth have been isolated, including Nogo-A [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. Antibody neutralization of Nogo-A allows axon growth into myelin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>] and identifies this factor as a critical endogenous inhibitor of CNS regeneration. <italic>Nogo</italic>/(<italic>RTN4</italic>) is a member of the endoplasmic reticulum-associated "reticulon" (RTN) family whose members have two hydrophobic, membrane spanning domains in the carboxyl-terminus. The <italic>Nogo </italic>gene gives rise to three main transcripts based on alternative splicing and variant promoter usage: <italic>Nogo-A</italic>, <italic>Nogo-B </italic>and <italic>Nogo-C </italic>(see figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). Between the two membrane spanning domains is a 66 amino acid extracellular loop that acts as a ligand to a specific Nogo66 receptor (NgR) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. However, only in Nogo-A, the largest transcript, has the receptor/ligand interaction been linked to neurite inhibition. Two other functional domains (an amino-terminal domain, NiR&#x00394;2, and a Nogo-A specific domain, NiG-&#x00394;20 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]) have been identified that inhibit neurite outgrowth.</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Chicken <italic>NOGO/RTN4 </italic>gene structure and transcripts</bold>.

In contrast, Nogo-A is widespread in fetal neurons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. Interestingly, the Nogo receptor (NgR) is absent in the embryonic and fetal brain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. Thus, the presence of Nogo-A during CNS development when regeneration is possible [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>] and NgR is absent, hints at an additional role for Nogo-A.</p><p>In this report we describe the induction and temporospatial expression of <italic>NOGO-A </italic>from the earliest stages of CNS development with the induction of neuroectoderm. We also describe a progressive increase in <italic>NOGO-A </italic>expression with chick brain development. We further localized and correlated this progressive increase in <italic>NOGO-A </italic>expression to specific cell types and key events of CNS development within the highly organized chick optic tectum. Collectively, our results suggest a fundamental role for Nogo-A in CNS development and maturation that is unrelated to its later role as an inhibitor of axonal regeneration.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Isolation and northern analysis of chicken NOGO-A</title><p>We isolated and cloned the chicken <italic>NOGO-A </italic>coding and 3' untranslated region.

Multiple alignment of widely different species also revealed eight conserved regions (CR1-8) within the Nogo-A specific coding sequence (Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). This conservation implies preservation of domains that are functionally significant. Previous functional domains have been identified in regions common to all Nogo isoforms [Nogo66 in the C-terminus, NiR&#x00394;2 (rat-aa 59&#x02013;172) in the shared Nogo-A/B regions], and in the Nogo-A specific region [NiG&#x00394;20 (rat-aa 544&#x02013;725)], but have been linked to inhibitory roles in neurite outgrowth and cell spreading [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>].

This differential induction indicates tissue specific and temporal-spatial regulation of <italic>NOGO-A</italic>. Interestingly, there was asymmetrical right-sided <italic>NOGO-A </italic>expression within the primitive node (Hensen's node) and scant expression in the notochord and presumptive neural groove immediately overlying the notochord.

Briefly, after blocking (3% H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2 </sub>in 10% methanol and Powerblock, BioGenex), primary antibodies were applied to the slides for 40 minutes using Vimentin (1/200, Ventana), Neurofilament M (1/3200, Chemicon), GFAP (8 mg/ml, Chemicon), and PCNA (1/200, Dako). A multi-species, biotinylated, secondary antibody (Multi-link, Biogenex) was then applied to the slides for 20 minutes. The detection signal was amplified with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated streptavidin (Superlabel, BioGenex) and then visualized using a permanent (non-aqueous) chromogen, Romulin AEC (Biocare). Positive and negative (BSA) controls were performed for each staining run (Data not shown).</p></sec><sec><title>Bead Implantation</title><p>Heparin acrylic beads (Sigma) of 80&#x02013;120 &#x003bc;m size were manually isolated using a stereomicroscope, washed multiple times in PBS, soaked in 50 &#x003bc;g/ml FGF-4 (R&#x00026;D Systems) at 4&#x000b0;C for 1&#x02013;2 hr and then washed in PBS prior to implant. HH4 chick embryos were cultured using the EC culture method [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>]. Using a 0.01 mm sharpened tungsten needle beads were pushed between endoderm and ectodermal layers of ventral side up embryos and placed in anterior, non-neural ectoderm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>]. Embryos were then harvested in MEMFA at 3, 6, or 9 hours post implant and processed for whole mount <italic>in situ</italic> hybridization as described above.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>SC carried out the <italic>in situ</italic> hybridization, northern and bead implant studies, participated in the sequence alignment and drafted the manuscript.
