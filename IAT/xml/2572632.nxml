For lung cancer, approximately 50% of patients have metastatic disease at the time of diagnosis, which contributes to a less than 15% overall survival rate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. The poor survival of lung cancer patients is in part attributed to undetectable tumor micrometastasis at the time of surgery for even relatively early-stage disease, which is responsible for later relapse with the development of nodal and/or distant metastasis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Furthermore, there is no highly effective curative therapy for advanced or hormone-refractory prostate cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. A better understanding of the molecular mechanisms associated with lung and prostate cancer progression may aid in the development of improved diagnosis, clinical management, and outcome prediction. In particular, the discovery of epigenetic biomarkers for cancer invasiveness and metastasis may help in the identification of patients at risk for more aggressive cancer disease courses. This would potentially help clinicians to devise effective intensified and/or novel therapeutic strategies to prevent or decrease the likelihood of tumor progression to invasiveness and metastasis in such high-risk patients.</p><p>Hypermethylation of CpG site clusters (CpG islands) within the promoter region of genes has been characterized as a common epigenetic alteration for the silencing or inactivation of tumor suppressor genes in human malignancies including lung and prostate cancers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. Due to their heritable nature, both genetic and epigenetic alterations pose a great risk for cancer development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. Aberrant methylation of p16INK4a, FHIT, APC, MLH1, RASSF1, CDKN2A, and DAPK has been associated with lung cancer stage, metastasis, and an increased risk of recurrence after therapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. GSTP1, encoding the &#x003c0;-class glutathione S-transferase (GST) capable of detoxifying electrophilic and oxidant carcinogens, was the first reported gene silenced by CpG island hypermethylation in prostate cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Subsequent studies have identified more than 40 genes that are targeted by DNA hypermethylation in prostate cancer cells, including RASSF1A (ras association domain family protein 1, isoform A), RAR&#x003b2;2 (retinoic acid receptor &#x003b2;2), p16INK4a, and PTEN (phosphatase and tensin homolog) tumor suppressor genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Although silencing of other tumor suppressor genes, such as RB1 (retinoblastoma-1 gene), MLH-1 (mismatch repair gene), and VHL (von Hippel-Lindau gene), through DNA hypermethylation is relatively rare in prostate cancer, it is common in other types of malignancies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>].</p><p><italic>TGFBI</italic>, also known as <italic>Betaig-h3</italic>, is a secreted protein induced by transforming growth factor-&#x003b2; (TGF-&#x003b2;) in human adenocarcinoma cells as well as in other human cell types [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>], and has been shown to possess tumor suppressor function in <italic>in vitro </italic>studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. An earlier study from our laboratory demonstrated a dense methylation pattern of the <italic>TGFBI </italic>promoter in human tumor cell lines, including both lung (H522, H810, H1417) and prostate (DU145) tumor cell lines, with a complete loss or low level of <italic>TGFBI </italic>expression in these cell lines. In contrast, only sparsely methylated or unmethylated CpG sites were identified in cell lines with a rich level of <italic>TGFBI </italic>expression, including normal, immortalized, and several tumor cell lines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. In this study, we have examined the promoter methylation of the <italic>TGFBI </italic>gene in 100 cases of lung and prostate cancers by using an optimized MSP method. Our study revealed that dense <italic>TGFBI </italic>promoter methylation is correlated with the invasiveness of prostate cancers, and with the metastatic status of lung cancers. <italic>TGFBI </italic>methylation may thus serve as a useful prognostic biomarker, and our optimized MSP method may be useful for evaluation of <italic>TGFBI </italic>promoter methylation in a wide variety of tumor samples.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Lung and Prostate Cancer Patient Samples</title><p>Genomic DNA of lung cancer samples from 50 non-small cell lung cancer patients &#x02013; consisting of 36 primary lung cancer tumor samples, 10 lymph node metastasis samples, and 4 distant metastasis samples &#x02013; were purchased from Oncomatrix (San Marcos, CA). Frozen tissue from the prostatectomy specimens of 50 prostate adenocarcinoma patients who had undergone therapeutic prostatectomy was obtained from the Columbia University Tumor Bank. Fifteen tissue sections of seven-micron thickness were procured for each patient. A phenol-chloroform procedure was used to isolate genomic DNA from cancer specimens. For the prostate portion, we obtained approval from the Columbia IRB using "exempt status" (i.e., examination of pathological specimens that contain no patient identifier information, protocol number IRB X-10005).</p><p>In our analysis, we divided the lung cancer patients into two groups based on specimen source: patients whose tumor specimen was derived from the primary lung tumor site vs. those whose tumor specimen was obtained from a metastatic site (lymph node or distant). Lung cancer specimen source type was then correlated with <italic>TGFBI </italic>methylation status. Likewise, prostate cancer patients were divided into two groups based on a specific classification system: patients who did not have pathological features of locoregional invasiveness (extracapsular extension = stage pT3a, seminal vesicle involvement = stage pT3b, margin positivity, and/or regional lymph node involvement = stage pN1) vs. those who did have one or more such features of locoregional invasiveness. We then correlated the presence vs. absence of locoregional invasiveness with <italic>TGFBI </italic>methylation status.</p><p>As a point of clarification, we included pathological prostatectomy margin positivity as a feature that would qualify a patient's disease as having locoregional invasiveness present (in addition to pT3 or pN1 disease), which is supported by previous studies that have considered margin positivity to be a well-established feature of a more aggressive prostate cancer disease course after prostatectomy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Bisulfite Treatment</title><p>Using the EZ DNA Methylation Kit&#x02122; (Zymed Research, Orange, CA) protocol, 2 &#x003bc;g of genomic DNA from each patient sample was treated with denaturation buffer, sodium bisulfite (converting unmethylated cytosine residues to uracil), and desulphonation buffer, with elution of the bisulfite-modified DNA into 10 &#x003bc;l of buffer.</p></sec><sec><title><italic>TGFBI </italic>Regulatory Region Template Enrichment</title><p>To amplify the regulatory region (promoter region and first exon) of the <italic>TGFBI </italic>gene in each patient sample, 2 &#x003bc;L of the bisulfite-modified DNA was used as a template in a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using the FailSafe&#x02122; PCR System with 2&#x000d7; PreMix J buffer (Epicentre Biotechnologies, Madison, WI). Primer set "M1/M2" was used in this PCR amplification. Primers M1 and M2 were designed to flank the <italic>TGFBI </italic>regulatory region without any potential methylation sites, thus allowing for amplification of both methylated and unmethylated DNA (i.e., primers M1 and M2 were "unbiased" vis-&#x000e0;-vis methylation status) (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). The PCR conditions were as follows: a hot start at 95&#x000b0;C for 5 minutes (to fully denature the bisulfite-modified genomic DNA), 35 amplification cycles (94&#x000b0;C for 30 seconds for denaturation, 53&#x000b0;C for 30 seconds for primer annealing, and 72&#x000b0;C for 60 seconds for extension), and a final full extension at 72&#x000b0;C for 5 minutes. A MSP method using a methylation-specific primer set was then developed and executed using the <italic>TGFBI </italic>regulatory region product from the M1/M2 PCR amplification as the template for MSP, as described in the Results section.</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Predicted CpG island and methylated CpG sites profile of the</bold><italic><bold>TGFBI </bold></italic><bold>regulatory region in human tumor cell lines</bold>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16"><bold>16</bold></xref>].

Primers M3 and M4 were designed to flank the <italic>TGFBI </italic>regulatory region, with the M3/M4 product sequence flanked by primers M1 and M2 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). Like primers M1/M2, M3/M4 were "unbiased" primers that bound to DNA lacking potential methylation sites so that both methylated and unmethylated DNA would be amplified. The PCR conditions for the M3/M4 reaction were the same as for the M1/M2 reaction except for use of 2&#x000d7; PreMix D buffer, a hot start at 94&#x000b0;C for 2 minutes, and 54&#x000b0;C as the primer annealing temperature. The intended amplification of the <italic>TGFBI </italic>regulatory region was proven by the presence of a 629-bp band using this M3/M4 primer pair. Thus, the PCR reaction using the M3/M4 primer pair served as a template control to ensure the successful and sequence-specific amplification of the <italic>TGFBI </italic>promoter, thereby mitigating the possibility of false-negative results with the MSP method. The template enrichment primer pairs were: M1:5'AGTTGGGGAGGGTGGTTAGTT3' (-548 to -529), and M2: 5'ACCCCAACTACCT AACCTTCC3' (+162 to +184), M1/M2 PCR product of 732 bp; M3: 5'TTTGTAGTGTTT TGTAGTTTTAAGATT3' (-457 to -430), and M4: 5'TAACCTTCCACAACCCCTAACCA A3' (+172 to +148), M3/M4 PCR product of 629 bp.</p></sec><sec><title>Reverse Transcription and Quantitative PCR</title><p>The expression of the <italic>TGFBI </italic>gene was analyzed by quantitative real-time reverse transcription-PCR as described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>].

Our previous work had defined the methylation status of a total of 49 CpG sites across 0.6 kb of the <italic>TGFBI </italic>promoter in human tumor cell lines, and we had demonstrated a dense methylation pattern in lung, kidney, and DU145 prostate tumor cell lines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. Based on these data, in the present study we designed three pairs of methylation-specific PCR primers ("P1-P6," Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref> and Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>). Nucleotide positions were numbered relative to the translation start site (TSS) (+1). Each primer was designed to bind to a different stretch of the <italic>TGFBI </italic>promoter with each of these distinct stretches containing 2&#x02013;3 possible methylated sites (boldface in Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>). The nucleotide C in non-CpG sites and unmethylated CpG sites would be modified to T (sense strand) or A (antisense strand) by bisulfite treatment, whereas C would remain as C in methylated CpG sites. Thus, for example, PCR amplification with primer set P1-P2 on a particular sample would yield a PCR product only if the <italic>TGFBI </italic>region in this sample was actually methylated at the two CpG sites encompassed by primer P1 and the three CpG sites encompassed by primer P2. As a control, primers U1/U2 were designed to amplify unmethylated DNA, in which case the nucleotide C in CpG sites would be modified to T or A by bisulfite treatment.</p><table-wrap position="float" id="T1"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Primer sequences and optimized annealing temperatures for each pair of primers</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><td align="left">Primers</td><td align="left">Sequence</td><td align="center">CpG sites</td><td align="center">Location</td><td align="center">Length (bp)</td><td align="center">Annealing temp.

Therefore, identification of biomarkers of invasiveness and metastasis would help to identify those patients who are more likely to have tumor dissemination, progression, or recurrence. We have shown previously that CpG islands of the <italic>TGFBI </italic>gene promoter are hypermethylated in human tumor cell lines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. However, the method used in our previous study was DNA sequencing of bisulfite-treated samples, which is labor-intensive and unsuitable for the rapid screening of methylation status of the <italic>TGFBI </italic>promoter in a large number of clinical patient samples.</p><p>Therefore, the present study was focused on optimizing and implementing a MSP method for accurate and efficient screening of <italic>TGFBI </italic>promoter methylation. For this purpose, we designed three pairs of methylation-specific primers based on the methylation profiles of the <italic>TGFBI </italic>promoter reported in human tumor cell lines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. MSP conditions were optimized and successfully used for examining the methylation status of the <italic>TGFBI </italic>promoter in 50 cases each of lung tumors and prostatectomy specimens of prostate adenocarcinoma patients. Overall, <italic>TGFBI </italic>methylation was present in 44.0% (22/50) of lung cancer specimens and 82.0% (41/50) of prostate cancer specimens. Interestingly, dense methylation (&#x02265; 16 methylated CpG sites) of the <italic>TGFBI </italic>promoter was identified in 16.0% (8/50) of lung cancer and 28.0% (14/50) of prostate cancer specimens, respectively, which in turn correlated significantly with metastatic phenotype in lung cancers and locoregional invasiveness in prostate cancers. Therefore, cancer cells with a densely methylated <italic>TGFBI </italic>promoter may be prone to invasiveness in prostate cancer and metastasis in lung cancer.</p><p>It should be noted that the exact percent tumor involvement in the slices of prostate tissue used for DNA extraction was not quantified. Thus, the percentage of tumor cells in tumor specimens or proportion of tumor cells with <italic>TGFBI </italic>promoter methylation may be very low in some tumor samples. In the present study, we used the product from the first round of PCR (M1/M2) as template to perform the second round of MSP analysis in order to increase the amplification efficiency and avoid false-negative results.</p><p>Cell-cell adhesion and cell-substrate adhesion are critical to the preservation of normal tissue architecture, and disruption of the cell adhesion system can lead to tumor infiltration and metastasis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. The TGFBI protein is composed of 683 amino acids containing four homologous internal repeat domains and has been reported to function as an extracellular matrix protein that mediates cell adhesion and migration through interactions with integrin receptors &#x003b1;3&#x003b2;1, &#x003b1;v&#x003b2;3, and &#x003b1;v&#x003b2;5 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. TGFBI protein is a component of extracellular matrix (ECM) in lung, bladder, and skin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>], and it promotes adhesion and spreading of dermal fibroblasts and corneal epithelial cells <italic>in vitro</italic>. Thus, silencing of the <italic>TGFBI </italic>promoter by hypermethylation would result in a deficiency of the gene product, which in turn may lead to the disruption of cell-ECM interaction and contribute to invasion and metastasis of cancer cells. Our previous work identified a dense <italic>TGFBI </italic>methylation pattern in lung tumor cell lines (H522, H810, and H1417) and a metastasized prostate tumor cell line (DU145) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. Our present results showed that 16.0% of lung cancer and 28.0% of prostate cancer samples had dense <italic>TGFBI </italic>promoter hypermethylation and that such dense methylation was associated with metastasis in lung cancer and invasiveness in prostate cancer, suggesting a potential prognostic value of <italic>TGFBI </italic>hypermethylation in lung and prostate cancer patients.</p><p>The TGF-&#x003b2; signaling pathway plays an important role in regulating proliferation and differentiation in normal lung and prostate epithelium [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. Previous reports have shown that both lung and prostate cancer cells become resistant to the antiproliferative effects of TGF-&#x003b2; during cancer formation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. <italic>TGFBI</italic>, as one of the downstream effectors of the TGF-&#x003b2; signaling pathway, has been shown to be expressed ubiquitously in a variety of normal human tissues but is downregulated or inactivated in many human tumor cell lines including lung and prostate tumor cell lines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. Thus, blockage or inactivation of the TGF-&#x003b2; pathway caused by loss of TGF-&#x003b2; receptors (I, II, III) and mutations of Smads (2, 3, 4) would lead to a lack of response to TGF-&#x003b2;, and subsequent downregulation of <italic>TGFBI </italic>expression. Our previous work showed that most CpG sites of the <italic>TGFBI </italic>promoter were unmethylated in normal NHBE (normal human bronchial epithelial) cells and PHEC (prostate human epithelial cells) that expressed a high level of <italic>TGFBI </italic>mRNA. In contrast, three lung tumor cell lines (H522, H810, and H1417) and one prostate tumor cell line (DU145) that expressed an undetectable or a much lower level of <italic>TGFBI </italic>mRNA showed hypermethylation in the <italic>TGFBI </italic>promoter [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. Consistent with this report, in the present study MSP-based PCR products were identified in H522, H810, H1417, and DU145 tumor cells but not in A549 and PC3 cells, suggesting that the MSP method can accurately and efficiently screen the methylation status of the <italic>TGFBI </italic>promoter. In addition, dense methylation of the <italic>TGFBI </italic>promoter is responsible for gene silencing since induction of <italic>TGFBI </italic>expression by TGF-&#x003b2;1 was totally lost in the tumor cells with <italic>TGFBI </italic>hypermethylation, whereas demethylating treatment with Aza-CdR resulted in the re-expression of <italic>TGFBI </italic>in these tumor cell lines. In summary, dense methylation of the <italic>TGFBI </italic>promoter correlates with gene silencing that in turn may promote an advanced tumorigenic phenotype, such as invasiveness in prostate cancer and metastasis in lung cancer.</p><p>There is one report in the literature showing that overexpression of <italic>TGFBI </italic>promotes metastasis of SW480 colon cancer cells by enhancing extravasation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. However, a significant downregulation of <italic>TGFBI </italic>expression has been demonstrated in HT29 colon cancer cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>] and in different types of primary human cancers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>], which is further substantiated by the present data demonstrating a correlation between promoter hypermethylation and <italic>TGFBI </italic>silencing in human lung and prostate cancer cells. It is highly possible that dysregulation of <italic>TGFBI </italic>expression is tumor cell or type-specific; moreover, <italic>TGFBI </italic>may be a double-edged sword whose loss or gain of expression may help promote tumorigenesis. Future studies will be required to clarify the functional complexity of <italic>TGFBI </italic>in human tumor progression.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>We designed methylation-specific primers and optimized MSP conditions to examine the methylation status of the <italic>TGFBI </italic>promoter in a large number of human lung and prostate cancer specimens.
