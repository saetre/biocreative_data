The fundamental importance of DNA helicases is highlighted by a variety of human genetic disorders resulting from defective helicase function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf202c1">1</xref>). Although the clinical features of these disorders differ, they all exhibit genomic instability and a predisposition to cancer. One class of DNA helicases, the RecQ family (named after its homology with the prototypical bacterial RecQ helicase), has attracted particular interest recently (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf202c2">2</xref>). Defects in three of the five known human RecQ family members manifest as Bloom&#x02019;s syndrome (<italic>BLM</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf202c3">3</xref>), Rothmund&#x02013;Thomson syndrome (<italic>RECQ4</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf202c4">4</xref>) and Werner&#x02019;s syndrome (<italic>WRN</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf202c5">5</xref>). All three disorders show genomic instability associated with a predisposition to various cancers, while Rothmund&#x02013;Thomson syndrome and Werner&#x02019;s syndrome display features of premature ageing. At the cellular level, cells from Werner&#x02019;s syndrome sufferers display genomic translocations and deletions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf202c6">6</xref>), and a decreased replicative lifespan <italic>in&#x000a0;vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf202c7">7</xref>, reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf202c8">8</xref>). Cells from Bloom&#x02019;s syndrome patients similarly exhibit chromosomal rearrangements and deletions, but are characterised by a uniquely high frequency of sister chromatid exchanges (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf202c9">9</xref>).</p><p>In order to shed light on how mutations in human RecQ helicases result in genomic instability, much recent attention has been directed at RecQ orthologues in lower organisms. The genomes of <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>, <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> and <italic>Schizosaccharomyces pombe</italic> each contain only a single predicted RecQ helicase, thus facilitating analysis of their cellular function(s). Mutations in <italic>E.coli recQ</italic>, <italic>S.cerevisiae SGS1</italic> and <italic>S.pombe rqh1</italic><italic><sup>&#x0002b;</sup></italic> all result in increased recombination (10&#x02013;15), suggesting a conserved role of RecQ helicases in regulating recombination. Interestingly, the hyper-recombination phenotype of budding yeast <italic>sgs1</italic> mutants can be complemented by the human <italic>WRN</italic> and <italic>BLM</italic> genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf202c12">12</xref>). In addition to the hyper-recombination phenotype, <italic>sgs1</italic> mutants are sensitive to a range of genotoxins and display a reduced replicative lifespan (defined as the number of buds produced by a mother cell) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf202c12">12</xref>,16&#x02013;24). The human <italic>BLM</italic> gene has been shown to complement the hydroxyurea sensitivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf202c12">12</xref>) and short lifespan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf202c22">22</xref>) of the <italic>sgs1</italic> mutant, further reinforcing the notion of a conserved function of RecQ helicases. Current thinking suggests that this function may be the prevention of inappropriate recombination at stalled replication forks arising during S phase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf202c25">25</xref>).</p><p>The <italic>S.cerevisiae SRS2</italic> gene was discovered as a suppressor of the UV sensitivity of <italic>rad6</italic> and <italic>rad18</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf202c26">26</xref>), and also independently in a genetic screen which isolated and characterised yeast hyper-recombination mutants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf202c27">27</xref>). No obvious human homologue of Srs2 has yet been found, but the sequence of the <italic>SRS2</italic> gene does show homology to the bacterial UvrD and Rep helicases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf202c28">28</xref>) and an <italic>S.pombe</italic> orthologue has been identified recently (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf202c29">29</xref>). One function of Srs2 is to channel the repair of DNA lesions into the <italic>RAD6</italic> post-replication repair pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf202c30">30</xref>). In the absence of Srs2, DNA lesions are instead channelled into the <italic>RAD52</italic> homologous recombination repair pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf202c31">31</xref>). Srs2 has also been implicated in other DNA repair processes such as non-homologous end joining (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf202c32">32</xref>) and single-strand annealing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf202c33">33</xref>).</p><p>Srs2 shares a number of interesting features with Sgs1. Both Sgs1 and Srs2 have been demonstrated to be 3&#x02032;&#x02192;5&#x02032; DNA helicases <italic>in&#x000a0;vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf202c34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf202c35">35</xref>). The <italic>SGS1</italic> and <italic>SRS2</italic> gene products are generally expressed at low abundance but are up-regulated during the S&#x000a0;phase of the cell cycle, and both have been implicated in the intra-S checkpoint response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf202c18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf202c36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf202c37">37</xref>). Furthermore, <italic>sgs1</italic> and <italic>srs2</italic> mutants have a hyper-recombination phenotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf202c13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf202c27">27</xref>). Most recently, <italic>sgs1</italic>&#x00394; and <italic>srs2</italic>&#x00394; strains have both been shown to have a shortened replicative lifespan and a greater propensity to undergo terminal cell-cycle arrest as mitotic G<sub>2</sub>&#x0002f;M intermediates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf202c38">38</xref>). Deletion of both the <italic>SGS1</italic> and <italic>SRS2</italic> genes causes a severe synthetic growth defect, with low cell viability and a high incidence of G<sub>2</sub>&#x0002f;M terminal cell-cycle arrest, which can be suppressed by deletion of genes involved in homologous recombination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf202c20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf202c38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf202c39">39</xref>). This suggests that unrestrained recombination causes the poor growth of the <italic>sgs1srs2</italic> double mutant and is consistent with the idea that Srs2, like Sgs1, may act to prevent inappropriate recombination at stalled replication forks.</p><p>It was initially proposed that the Sgs1 and Srs2 helicases perform redundant functions in DNA replication and RNA pol I transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf202c40">40</xref>). However, the DNA replication and RNA pol I defects reported are in fact likely to be secondary consequences of unrestrained recombination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf202c20">20</xref>). Nevertheless, the original suggestion of functional overlap between these two helicases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf202c40">40</xref>) remains possible. Consistent with this idea, we found the <italic>srs2</italic>&#x00394; mutant to have a similar genotoxin sensitivity profile and replicative lifespan to the <italic>sgs1</italic>&#x00394; mutant. Moreover, increased gene dosage of <italic>SGS1</italic> partially restored genotoxin resistance and increased the maximum lifespan in the <italic>srs2</italic>&#x00394; mutant. This indicates that Sgs1 can partially compensate for the loss of Srs2.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Yeast strains and plasmids</title><p>Yeast strains and plasmids used in this study are described briefly in Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="gkf202tb1">1</xref>.

Transposon-based mutagenesis was then performed on this modified plasmid using the E::Z&#x02122; In-frame linker insertion kit (Cambio, Cambridge, UK). This utilises the Tn5 <italic>in vitro</italic> transposition system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf202c41">41</xref>). Mutagenesis was performed <italic>in vitro</italic> by incubating 0.03 pmol of EZ::TN&#x0003c;<italic>Not</italic>I&#x0002f;KAN-3&#x0003e; transposon and plasmid DNA with 1 &#x000b5;l of Tn5 transposase enzyme at 37&#x000b0;C for 2 h. The reaction was then stopped and the reaction mixture transformed into XL1 Blue <italic>E.coli</italic> (Stratagene, Amsterdam, The Netherlands). All resultant Kan<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> Amp<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> colonies were pooled and grown up prior to plasmid DNA isolation. The Kan<sup>R</sup> gene was spliced out by digesting the midiprep with <italic>Not</italic>I, leaving a 57-bp sequence at the site of transposon insertion. This sequence codes for a 19-amino acid read-through insertion, which maintains the reading frame and so avoids creation of truncation mutants. The <italic>Not</italic>I-cut plasmid was gel purified, re-ligated <italic>in vitro</italic> and re-transformed into XL1 Blue <italic>E.coli</italic>. The resulting Amp<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> colonies were used to construct both the random mutational library and the methyl methanesulphonate (MMS) loss-of-function library.</p><p>For the random mutational library, 190 Amp<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> colonies were selected at random and grown up individually. Of these, PCR analysis identified 80 colonies that contained plasmids harbouring the 57-bp insertion within the <italic>SGS1</italic> gene. These colonies were individually grown up prior to isolation of their plasmid DNA. The position of transposon insertion was determined by digesting plasmid minipreps with <italic>Sal</italic>I and <italic>Not</italic>I.</p><p>For the MMS loss-of-function library, all original Amp<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> colonies harbouring transposon-mutagenised YEplac195-<italic>SGS1</italic> were pooled and grown up. Their DNA was then isolated and transformed into the <italic>sgs1</italic>&#x00394; mutant strain. Ura<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> transformants (500) were then picked and patched individually onto 10 &#x000d7; 10 grids on SD-URA plates. Each plate also contained positive (<italic>sgs1</italic>&#x00394;-YEplac195-<italic>SGS1</italic>) and negative (<italic>sgs1</italic>&#x00394;-YEplac195) controls for comparison. Plates were incubated overnight at 30&#x000b0;C, and then replica plated onto plates containing 0.023&#x00025; MMS and left for 2 days. Loss-of-function mutations (i.e. plasmids no longer able to rescue MMS sensitivity in the <italic>sgs1</italic>&#x00394; strain) were identified on replica plates, and the corresponding colonies picked from the master plate. These were grown up, pooled and their DNA recovered and transformed into XL1 Blue <italic>E.coli</italic>. Forty-two Amp<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> colonies were selected for further analysis of transposon insertion by restriction digest analysis. The remaining colonies were pooled, and their DNA isolated by midiprep.</p></sec><sec><title>Drug sensitivity plates</title><p>This was performed as described previously for <italic>sgs1</italic>&#x00394;, using identical drug concentrations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf202c23">23</xref>). For quantitation of strains grown on solid media supplemented with MMS, yeast strains were grown up in minimal media for 2&#x02013;3 days at 30&#x000b0;C, diluted and then spread on solid media plates containing increasing doses of MMS. After 3 days, the percent viability of each strain was expressed as number of colonies obtained relative to that on the control (no MMS) plate. For quantitation of MMS sensitivity of strains in liquid media, yeast strains were grown to an OD<sub>600</sub> of 0.5&#x02013;0.6 before addition of 0.01&#x02013;0.12&#x00025; MMS for 60 min. Cells were washed in 10&#x00025; sodium thiosulfate, diluted and spread onto solid media plates. After 3 days, the percent viability of each strain was expressed as number of colonies obtained relative to that obtained for the control samples.</p></sec><sec><title>Detection of Sgs1 and Srs2 by western blotting</title><p>Yeast extracts were prepared by bead-beating in 8 M-urea-containing 2D-gel extraction buffer (Bio-Rad, Hemel Hempstead, UK) and run on SDS&#x02013;polyacrylamide gels prior to transfer onto nitrocellulose. Recombinant his-tagged Sgs1(1-400) protein was purified from <italic>E.coli</italic> transformed with the pQE30-<italic>SGS1</italic>(1-400) plasmid using Ni<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>-NTA-agarose (Qiagen). The purified protein was then used for antibody production in rabbits by following a published method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf202c42">42</xref>). The resulting Sgs1p 857 antiserum was then purified using protein G&#x02013;Sepharose to yield the IgG fraction used for western blotting. The Srs2p (yA-19) and Sir2p (yN-19) goat polyclonal antibodies were obtained from Autogen Bioclear (Mile Elm, UK). All primary antibodies were routinely used at dilutions of 1:500. Immunoreactive bands were detected with peroxidase-conjugated secondary antisera and visualised using enhanced chemiluminescence.</p></sec><sec><title>Lifespan analysis</title><p>This was performed as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf202c23">23</xref>). Briefly, strains were grown at 30&#x000b0;C until they reached an OD<sub>600</sub> of 0.6&#x02013;1.0. One microlitre of culture was streaked onto plates and left at 30&#x000b0;C for 1&#x02013;2 h. After this time, cell doublets were moved to uninhabited regions of the plate. When these budded again, (newly formed) virgin yeast cells were removed by micromanipulation to a new location. All future buds produced by these daughter cells were micromanipulated away, and catalogued. The plates were incubated at 30&#x000b0;C during working hours, and moved to 4&#x000b0;C overnight. Lifespan was defined as number of daughter cells removed from the mother cell. All lifespans were observed a minimum of twice.</p></sec><sec><title>Yeast transformation and DNA extraction</title><p>This was performed as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf202c23">23</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec><title>RESULTS</title><p>Deletion of the <italic>SGS1</italic> gene in both haploid and diploid strains has been reported to result in a replicative lifespan of &#x0223c;40&#x00025; that of isogenic wild-type strains (22&#x02013;24). To determine whether deletion of <italic>SRS2</italic> has a similar effect, lifespan analysis was performed on <italic>srs2</italic>&#x00394; and BY4743 (wild-type) isogenic diploid strains transformed with the empty YCplac33 vector (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf202f1">1</xref>A). Both strains were transformed with YCplac33 to allow direct comparison with previous findings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf202c23">23</xref>). The mean lifespan of the BY4743-YCplac33 strain was 16.0 &#x000b1; 1.0 (<italic>n</italic> &#x0003d; 76), compared with 7.2 &#x000b1; 0.9 (<italic>n</italic> &#x0003d; 38) for the <italic>srs2</italic>&#x00394;-YCplac33 strain. The maximum lifespans recorded were 44 and 23, respectively. The short lifespan of the <italic>srs2</italic>&#x00394; mutant observed is comparable with that of the isogenic diploid <italic>sgs1</italic>&#x00394;-YCplac33 strain, which has a mean lifespan of 7.4 &#x000b1; 0.8 (<italic>n</italic> &#x0003d; 32) and maximum of 16 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf202c23">23</xref>). A similar magnitude of shortened replicative lifespan has recently been reported for the haploid <italic>sgs1</italic>&#x00394; and <italic>srs2</italic>&#x00394; strains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf202c38">38</xref>). Therefore, deletion of <italic>SGS1</italic> or <italic>SRS2</italic> reduces the replicative lifespan to a similar extent in both haploid and diploid backgrounds.</p><p>We have previously characterised the sensitivity of the <italic>sgs1</italic>&#x00394; mutant to MMS (DNA methylating agent), 4-NQO (causes bulky-base adducts and oxidative damage), hydroxyurea (DNA synthesis inhibitor), camptothecin (Type I topoisomerase inhibitor) and mitoxantrone (Type II topoisomerase inhibitor) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf202c23">23</xref>). To assess the sensitivity of the <italic>srs2</italic>&#x00394; mutant to these drugs, the diploid <italic>srs2</italic>&#x00394; mutant was transformed with YCplac33 (empty vector) and YCplac33-<italic>SRS2</italic> and compared with the BY4743 isogenic wild-type strain transformed with YCplac33. Various dilutions of <italic>srs2</italic>&#x00394;-YCplac33, BY4743-YCplac33 and <italic>srs2</italic>&#x00394;-YCplac33-<italic>SRS2</italic> strains were grown on plates containing the above drugs (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf202f1">1</xref>B). Similar to the <italic>sgs1</italic>&#x00394; mutant, the <italic>srs2</italic>&#x00394;-YCplac33 strain showed sensitivity to all DNA damaging agents tested. Transformed <italic>srs2</italic>&#x00394; cells containing the YCplac33-<italic>SRS2</italic> plasmid showed comparable drug sensitivity to the BY4743 wild-type strain under these conditions. The observation that plasmid-borne <italic>SRS2</italic> can restore genotoxin resistance to isogenic wild-type levels thus confirms that deletion of the <italic>SRS2</italic> gene is the sole defect in the <italic>srs2</italic>&#x00394; mutant.</p><p>To assess the specificity of the drug sensitive phenotype of the <italic>sgs1</italic>&#x00394; and <italic>srs2</italic>&#x00394; strains, the MMS sensitivity of other yeast mutants lacking DNA helicases was assessed. The <italic>pif1</italic>&#x00394;, <italic>rrm3</italic>&#x00394;, <italic>yKU70</italic>&#x00394; and <italic>yKU80</italic>&#x00394; mutants were tested. Pif1 and Rrm3 are DNA helicases involved in regulating telomeric and mitochondrial DNA (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf202c43">43</xref>), and are also involved in the replication fork progression through the rDNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf202c44">44</xref>). The <italic>y</italic><italic>KU70</italic> and <italic>y</italic><italic>KU80</italic> gene products are involved in the repair of DNA double strand breaks (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf202c45">45</xref>) and physical and genetic interactions between RecQ helicases and Ku proteins have been demonstrated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf202c46">46</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf202c47">47</xref>). It was found that the <italic>pif1</italic>&#x00394; mutant showed a slight sensitivity to MMS, as compared with the isogenic wild-type strain. The <italic>rrm3</italic>&#x00394;, <italic>yKU70</italic>&#x00394; and <italic>yKU80</italic>&#x00394; strains were not sensitive to MMS (results not shown). Therefore, MMS sensitivity appears to be a relatively specific phenotype for loss-of-function of either the Sgs1 or Srs2 helicases.</p><p>Based on the fact that either single mutant is viable, but the double mutant has a severe growth defect, it has been proposed that the Sgs1 and Srs2 helicases may be functionally redundant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf202c40">40</xref>). We therefore reasoned that overexpression of either of these DNA helicases might compensate for loss of the other. To initially confirm overexpression, Sgs1 and Srs2 levels <italic>in&#x000a0;vivo</italic> were assessed by western blotting. Protein was extracted from <italic>sgs1</italic>&#x00394;-pYES2, <italic>sgs1</italic>&#x00394;-pYES2-<italic>SGS1</italic>, <italic>srs2</italic>&#x00394;-pYES2 and <italic>srs2</italic>&#x00394;-pYES2-<italic>SRS2</italic> cultures induced with galactose. Extracted protein samples were separated by SDS&#x02013;PAGE, western blotted and probed for either Sgs1 or Srs2. An &#x0223c;160 kDa band corresponding to Sgs1 was present in the <italic>sgs1</italic>&#x00394;-pYES2-<italic>SGS1</italic>, but not <italic>sgs1</italic>&#x00394;-pYES2, protein extract (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf202f2">2</xref>A). Similarly, an &#x0223c;150 kDa band corresponding to Srs2 was present in the <italic>srs2</italic>&#x00394;-pYES2-<italic>SRS2</italic>, but not <italic>srs2</italic>&#x00394;-pYES2, protein extract (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf202f2">2</xref>A). For a control, all samples were probed for Sir2p, which was equally present in all protein extracts.</p><p>Although expression of <italic>SGS1</italic> or <italic>SRS2</italic> from the galactose-inducible pYES2 vector resulted in detectable levels of Sgs1 or Srs2 protein, it was not possible to detect Sgs1 by western blotting when <italic>SGS1</italic> was expressed under its own promoter from the YEplac195 vector. We therefore attempted to genetically verify the overexpression of Sgs1 from this plasmid. Sgs1 helicase activity has been postulated to produce a substrate that is deleterious unless resolved by Top3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf202c11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf202c48">48</xref>). Sgs1 overexpression should therefore be more harmful in <italic>top3</italic>&#x00394; mutants than in <italic>TOP3</italic> strains. To test this, <italic>top3</italic>&#x00394; mutant and isogenic wild-type control strains were transformed with both low-copy (YCplac33) and high-copy (YEplac195) <italic>SGS1</italic> plasmids (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf202f2">2</xref>B). Both strains gave viable Ura<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> transformants when transformed with the YCplac33, YCplac33-<italic>SGS1</italic>, YEplac195 and YEplac195-<italic>SGS1</italic> K<sup>706</sup>&#x02192;A plasmids. However, transformation of both strains with YEplac195-<italic>SGS1</italic> gave viable Ura<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> transformants in the wild-type strain, but very few viable colonies with the <italic>top3</italic>&#x00394; mutant. Therefore, expression of Sgs1 from the multicopy YEplac195 vector, but not the low-copy YCplac33 plasmid, was detrimental to the <italic>top3</italic>&#x00394; mutant. This indicates that increased gene dosage of Sgs1 does indeed result in increased Sgs1 protein levels. Furthermore, the deleterious effects of higher Sgs1 levels in the <italic>top3</italic>&#x00394; mutant required the helicase activity of Sgs1, consistent with the notion that the helicase activity of Sgs1 creates a substrate that Top3 resolves (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf202c11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf202c48">48</xref>).</p><p>To assess if Sgs1 and Srs2 are functionally interchangeable, the ability of high-copy plasmids carrying <italic>SGS1</italic> and <italic>SRS2</italic> to rescue MMS sensitivity in the <italic>sgs1</italic>&#x00394; and <italic>srs2</italic>&#x00394; strains was assessed (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="gkf202tb2">2</xref>). To control for non-specific effects of helicase overexpression, the high-copy pNF3000 plasmid carrying <italic>RAD3</italic> (a 5&#x02032;&#x02192;3&#x02032; DNA helicase involved in excision repair) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf202c49">49</xref>) was also compared. As a further specificity control, the effects of these plasmids on the (slight) MMS sensitivity of the <italic>pif1</italic>&#x00394; mutant were also investigated. High-copy plasmids encoding <italic>SRS2</italic> (both YEplac195-<italic>SRS2</italic> and pYES2-<italic>SRS2</italic>) were able to complement the MMS sensitivity of the <italic>srs2</italic>&#x00394; mutant, but had no obvious beneficial effects in either the <italic>sgs1</italic>&#x00394; or <italic>pif1</italic>&#x00394; mutants. Rather, Srs2 overexpression was found to have a dominant negative effect on growth of <italic>sgs1</italic>&#x00394;, <italic>pif1</italic>&#x00394; and wild-type strains. High-copy vectors expressing <italic>SGS1</italic> (YEplac195-<italic>SGS1</italic> and pYES2-<italic>SGS1</italic>) were able to complement the MMS sensitivity of both the <italic>sgs1</italic>&#x00394; and <italic>srs2</italic>&#x00394; mutant, but not the <italic>pif1</italic>&#x00394; mutant. Sgs1 helicase activity was essential for complementation as YEplac195-<italic>SGS1</italic> K<sup>706</sup>&#x02192;A (expressing a helicase-defective allele which has some complementing activity in the <italic>sgs1</italic>&#x00394; mutant) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf202c23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf202c50">50</xref>) was not able to suppress the MMS sensitivity of the <italic>sgs1</italic>&#x00394; or <italic>srs2</italic>&#x00394; mutant. The pNF3000 plasmid was unable to rescue the MMS sensitivity of all three mutants tested, although this plasmid has been demonstrated previously to complement the UV sensitivity of a <italic>rad3-1</italic> strain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf202c49">49</xref>).</p><p>The ability of <italic>SGS1</italic> to rescue the sensitivity of the <italic>srs2</italic>&#x00394; mutant to MMS and hydroxyurea is shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf202f3">3</xref>A. This demonstrates that the ability of <italic>SGS1</italic> to act as a multicopy suppressor of <italic>srs2</italic>&#x00394; is not uniquely specific for sensitivity to DNA damaging agents, but is also seen for inhibitors of DNA replication. To quantify the <italic>SGS1</italic> complementation of <italic>srs2</italic>&#x00394; MMS sensitivity, <italic>srs2</italic>&#x00394;-YEplac195-<italic>SGS1</italic>, <italic>srs2</italic>&#x00394;-YEplac195 and BY4743-YEplac195 diploid strains were grown up, diluted and then spread onto plates containing increasing doses of MMS. After 3 days, the percent viability of each strain was expressed as number of colonies obtained relative to that on the control (no MMS) plate. It can be seen that at the 0.003&#x00025; dose, where complete killing of <italic>srs2</italic>&#x00394;-YEplac195 cells occurred, the YEplac195-<italic>SGS1</italic> construct restored MMS resistance to &#x0223c;60&#x00025; of that seen in the isogenic wild-type (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf202f3">3</xref>B). A similar effect was observed when cells were exposed to MMS for 1 h before removal and inactivation of the drug (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf202f3">3</xref>C). Under these conditions, overexpression of <italic>SGS1</italic> restored viability to 30&#x02013;40&#x00025; of wild-type levels at doses where complete killing of control <italic>srs2</italic>&#x00394;-YEplac195 cells occurred.</p><p>Mutational analysis suggests that Sgs1 is a multifunctional protein, as mutant alleles of <italic>sgs1</italic> have selective complementing ability in different phenotypic assays (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf202c17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf202c21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf202c23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf202c51">51</xref>). We therefore set out to determine whether the domains of Sgs1 required for rescue of MMS sensitivity in the <italic>sgs1</italic>&#x00394; mutant differ from those required for complementation of the <italic>srs2</italic>&#x00394; mutant. In order to do this, we used <italic>in vitro</italic> transposon-scanning mutagenesis on the YEplac195-<italic>SGS1</italic> plasmid to create two distinct libraries of <italic>sgs1</italic> mutants containing in-frame 19-amino acid insertions (see Materials and Methods). The unselected mutational library was generated by individually growing up randomly chosen bacterial colonies and PCR screening for the presence of plasmids harbouring the 57-bp insertion within the <italic>SGS1</italic> gene. Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf202f4">4</xref>A shows the frequency and approximate location of in-frame transposon insertions in <italic>SGS1</italic> in this library, which comprises 75 alleles. It can be seen that there is coverage of insertion events throughout the entire <italic>SGS1</italic> gene with no obvious hotspots, suggesting that transposon insertion is basically random. To construct a library of <italic>sgs1</italic> MMS loss-of-function plasmids (i.e. plasmids no longer able to rescue MMS sensitivity in the <italic>sgs1</italic>&#x00394; strain), <italic>sgs1</italic>&#x00394; cells were transformed with the entire original pool of transposon-mutagenised YEplac195-<italic>SGS1</italic>. Of the resulting Ura<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> transformants, 500 were picked and grown up individually on 10 &#x000d7; 10 grids before replica plating onto MMS plates. One hundred colonies failed to grow on MMS plates; these were recovered from the master plate, and their pooled plasmid DNA isolated to create the MMS loss-of-function library. Restriction analysis of 42&#x000a0;alleles chosen at random from this library revealed a more restricted distribution of insertion events than in the unselected library (compare Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf202f4">4</xref>A and B). Most notably, there was a complete absence of insertions in the C-terminal 250 amino acids of Sgs1, a domain known to be dispensable for MMS resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf202c17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf202c51">51</xref>) (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf202f4">4</xref>B).</p><p>To determine whether the same functional domains of <italic>SGS1</italic> are also required for complementation of <italic>srs2</italic>&#x00394;, the <italic>srs2</italic>&#x00394; mutant was transformed with the MMS loss-of-function <italic>SGS1</italic> library (more than 500 Ura<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> transformants obtained). For a control, the <italic>srs2</italic>&#x00394; mutant was also transformed with the unselected library of 75 transposon-mutagenised <italic>SGS1</italic> plasmids characterised in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf202f4">4</xref>A (more than 200 Ura<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> transformants obtained). Colonies were resuspended, diluted and spread on control (no MMS) and 0.0035&#x00025; MMS plates (a dose at which the <italic>srs2</italic>&#x00394; mutant fails to grow). For the unselected <italic>SGS1</italic> plasmid library, 156 colonies were obtained in total, compared with 378 colonies obtained on the control (no MMS) plates. This verifies that insertion of the 57-bp linker sequence in the <italic>SGS1</italic> gene is not detrimental <italic>per se</italic>. In contrast, for the MMS loss-of-function <italic>SGS1</italic> plasmid library, none of the MMS loss-of-function plasmids (in the <italic>sgs1</italic>&#x00394; background) could rescue MMS sensitivity in the <italic>srs2</italic>&#x00394; mutant. Therefore, we conclude that the same domains of <italic>SGS1</italic> are required to restore MMS resistance to both <italic>sgs1</italic>&#x00394; and <italic>srs2</italic>&#x00394; strains, suggesting that a common molecular mechanism of action underlies complementation in both mutants.</p><p>It has been reported that sensitivity to MMS is enhanced in diploid <italic>srs2</italic>&#x00394; strains relative to haploids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf202c28">28</xref>). This ploidy-specific phenotype has been interpreted as additional lethal recombination events occurring between homologous chromosomes as well as sister chromatids. We therefore set out to determine whether the ability of <italic>SGS1</italic> to complement MMS sensitivity in the <italic>srs2</italic>&#x00394; mutant is due to suppression of recombination between homologous chromosomes. Haploid <italic>sgs1</italic>&#x00394; and <italic>srs2</italic>&#x00394; strains were used for these studies and compared with the isogenic wild-type BY4741 strain. To directly compare any ploidy-specific phenotypes, both haploid and diploid BY4741, <italic>sgs1</italic>&#x00394; and <italic>srs2</italic>&#x00394; mutant strains were grown on plates &#x000b1; MMS (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf202f5">5</xref>A). As reported previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf202c28">28</xref>), the diploid <italic>srs2</italic>&#x00394; strain was more MMS sensitive than the haploid <italic>srs2</italic>&#x00394; strain. The observed MMS sensitivity of strains (in order of most MMS sensitive) was as follows: <italic>srs2</italic>&#x00394; diploid &#x0003e; <italic>sgs1</italic>&#x00394; haploid &#x0003d; <italic>sgs1</italic>&#x00394; diploid &#x0003e; <italic>srs2</italic>&#x00394; haploid &#x0003e; BY4741 haploid &#x0003d; BY4741 diploid.</p><p>To test for any ploidy-specific effects of Sgs1 and Srs2 overexpression, haploid strains transformed with YEplac195, YEplac195-<italic>SGS1</italic>, YEplac195-<italic>SGS1</italic> K<sup>706</sup>&#x02192;A or YEplac195-<italic>SRS2</italic> were grown on plates &#x000b1; MMS. Both the haploid <italic>sgs1</italic>&#x00394;-YEplac195 and <italic>srs2</italic>&#x00394;-YEplac195 strains were sensitive to 0.01&#x00025; MMS, whereas BY4741-YEplac195 was unaffected at these doses (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf202f5">5</xref>B). The ability of YEplac195-<italic>SGS1</italic> (and not YEplac195-<italic>SGS1</italic> K<sup>706</sup>&#x02192;A) to suppress MMS sensitivity was reproducible in both the <italic>sgs1</italic>&#x00394; and <italic>srs2</italic>&#x00394; haploid strains. Similarly, YEplac195-<italic>SRS2</italic> could rescue the MMS-sensitive phenotype of the haploid <italic>srs2</italic>&#x00394; mutant, but again no beneficial effects in the <italic>sgs1</italic>&#x00394; haploid were evident. This demonstrates that the ability of <italic>SGS1</italic> to function as a multicopy suppressor of the <italic>srs2</italic>&#x00394; mutant is not a ploidy-specific effect.</p><p>In addition to the MMS-sensitive phenotype, the ability of the YEplac195-<italic>SGS1</italic> plasmid to rescue the shortened replicative lifespan of the <italic>srs2</italic>&#x00394; mutant was investigated. Lifespan analysis was performed on the <italic>srs2</italic>&#x00394;-YEplac195 and <italic>srs2</italic>&#x00394;-YEplac195-<italic>SGS1</italic> strains (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf202f6">6</xref>). Average lifespans of the strains &#x0005b;expressed as mean number of buds removed &#x000b1; standard error of the mean (SEM)&#x0005d; were 11.1 &#x000b1; 1.2 (<italic>n</italic> &#x0003d; 37) for <italic>srs2</italic>&#x00394;-YEplac195 and 13.3 &#x000b1; 1.4 (<italic>n</italic> &#x0003d; 38) for <italic>srs2</italic>&#x00394;-YEplac195-<italic>SGS1</italic>. The maximum lifespans recorded were 24 and 36, respectively. Although a Student&#x02019;s <italic>t</italic>-test revealed there to be no significant difference between the mean lifespans, a &#x003c7;<sup>2</sup> test on the 10&#x00025; longest-lived subpopulations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf202c52">52</xref>) revealed that Sgs1 overexpression caused a statistically significant increase in <italic>srs2</italic>&#x00394; lifespan (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.02).</p></sec><sec><title>DISCUSSION</title><sec><title>Phenotypic overlap between <italic>sgs1</italic>&#x00394; and <italic>srs2</italic>&#x00394; mutants</title><p>Mutant <italic>sgs1</italic> and <italic>srs2</italic> strains have been shown to exhibit hyper-recombination, defective intra-S checkpoint responses and shortened replicative lifespans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf202c13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf202c18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf202c27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf202c37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf202c38">38</xref>). The <italic>sgs1</italic>&#x00394; mutant is also known to be sensitive to a variety of genotoxic agents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf202c12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf202c16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf202c17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf202c19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf202c23">23</xref>). We report here that the <italic>srs2</italic>&#x00394; mutant is similarly sensitive to MMS, hydroxyurea, camptothecin, mitoxantrone and 4-NQO, reinforcing the phenotypic overlap with the <italic>sgs1</italic>&#x00394; mutant. In addition to its genotoxin sensitivity, the <italic>sgs1</italic>&#x00394; mutant has a shortened replicative lifespan (22&#x02013;24). We found that the <italic>srs2</italic>&#x00394; mutant has a mean replicative lifespan &#x0223c;45&#x00025; of that of the wild-type strain. This is comparable with the average lifespan recorded for the isogenic <italic>sgs1</italic>&#x00394; mutant (43&#x00025;) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf202c23">23</xref>), revealing a similar magnitude of shortened lifespan for the diploid <italic>sgs1</italic>&#x00394; and <italic>srs2</italic>&#x00394; mutants.</p><p>These findings are in agreement with a recent report documenting the phenotypes of the haploid <italic>sgs1</italic>&#x00394; and <italic>srs2</italic>&#x00394; mutants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf202c38">38</xref>). In that work, it was revealed that the previous characterisation of premature ageing in the <italic>sgs1</italic> mutant as a phenocopy of normal ageing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf202c24">24</xref>) was not entirely accurate. Instead, it was concluded that the short lifespan exhibited by both <italic>sgs1</italic>&#x00394; and <italic>srs2</italic>&#x00394; mutants was due to a combination of ageing-independent mitotic checkpoint arrest and accelerated normal ageing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf202c38">38</xref>). To determine whether the increased G<sub>2</sub>&#x0002f;M checkpoint arrest phenotype was also apparent in our diploid strains, we followed the approach of McVey <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf202c38">38</xref>) and re-analysed our lifespan data for incidence of terminally budded phenotypes. This analysis was performed blind as our lifespan studies were completed before publication of their report. The morphology of <italic>sgs1</italic>&#x00394; and <italic>srs2</italic>&#x00394; terminal phenotypes revealed a higher percentage of budded mitotic intermediates than that observed for the isogenic wild-type strain (data not shown), thus confirming the findings of McVey <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf202c38">38</xref>). As the severe phenotype of <italic>sgs1srs2</italic> double mutants can be suppressed by inactivation of Rad51, Rad52 or Rad57, it is likely that it results from unrestrained recombination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf202c38">38</xref>), in keeping with the idea that both Sgs1 and Srs2 act to prevent such events during S phase.</p></sec><sec><title>Complementation of the <italic>srs2</italic>&#x00394; mutant by <italic>SGS1</italic></title><p>It has been suggested that the Sgs1 and Srs2 helicases may be functionally redundant, based on the fact that either single mutant is viable, but the double mutant has a severe growth defect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf202c40">40</xref>). Although complete redundancy can be ruled out due to the abundance of phenotypes exhibited by each single mutant (see above), the similarities of these phenotypes are consistent with a degree of functional overlap. Our finding that <italic>SGS1</italic> can function as a multicopy suppressor of the MMS and hydroxyurea sensitivity of the <italic>srs2</italic>&#x00394; mutant provides direct support for this notion. In contrast, high-copy <italic>SRS2</italic> was unable to complement genotoxin sensitivity of the <italic>sgs1</italic>&#x00394; strain. One explanation of this finding is that Sgs1 performs some cellular function(s) that cannot be substituted by Srs2, despite the ability of Sgs1 to functionally replace Srs2. However, it is worth noting that, as reported previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf202c53">53</xref>), we found that higher levels of Srs2 caused detrimental effects in the wild-type strain.</p><p>Sgs1 is a large protein that, in addition to the RecQ helicase domain, has distinct domains required for interactions with Top2, Top3 and Rad51 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf202c11">11</xref>,54&#x02013;57). Furthermore, mutant alleles of <italic>sgs1</italic> have selective complementing ability in different phenotypic assays (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf202c17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf202c23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf202c50">50</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf202c51">51</xref>). Therefore, the domains of Sgs1 required for rescue of MMS sensitivity in the <italic>sgs1</italic>&#x00394; background could potentially differ from those required for complementation of the <italic>srs2</italic>&#x00394; mutant. To address this issue, we constructed libraries of <italic>SGS1</italic> mutant plasmids containing small in-frame insertions. Unsurprisingly, a large proportion of loss-of-function mutants for MMS resistance in the <italic>sgs1</italic>&#x00394; background contained transposon insertions in or around the helicase domain of <italic>SGS1</italic>. This is consistent with reports that the helicase activity of Sgs1 is required for dealing with MMS-induced DNA damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf202c17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf202c21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf202c23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf202c51">51</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf202c58">58</xref>). Some insertions were also found N-terminal to the helicase domain, mapping close to the interaction sites for Top2 and Top3. This supports the observation that the N-terminus of Sgs1 is essential for MMS resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf202c17">17</xref>). Interestingly, no MMS loss-of-function alleles mapped to the C-terminus of Sgs1, where the Rad51 interaction occurs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf202c57">57</xref>). Again, this is consistent with reports that much of the C-terminus of Sgs1 (the final 254 amino acids) is dispensable for MMS resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf202c17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf202c51">51</xref>). It was found that none of these <italic>SGS1</italic> loss-of-function plasmids tested could complement the <italic>srs2</italic>&#x00394; mutant. Similarly, a point mutation causing inactivation of Sgs1 helicase activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf202c50">50</xref>) was unable to restore MMS resistance to the <italic>srs2</italic>&#x00394; strain. This demonstrates that complementation of the <italic>srs2</italic>&#x00394; mutant by high-copy <italic>SGS1</italic> requires domains of Sgs1 that are directly involved in processing MMS-induced DNA lesions.</p><p>When <italic>SGS1</italic> was over expressed in the <italic>srs2</italic>&#x00394; mutant, no significant increase in the mean replicative lifespan was evident. This contrasts with the ability of <italic>SGS1</italic> overexpression to suppress MMS sensitivity of the <italic>srs2</italic>&#x00394; mutant. One possible reason for this is that other important roles of Srs2 may still be lacking and contribute to the shortened mean replicative lifespan of the <italic>srs2</italic>&#x00394; mutant. Alternatively, the beneficial effects of <italic>SGS1</italic> overexpression may be outweighed by detrimental effects associated with high levels of Sgs1. Several observations support the latter theory. First, <italic>SGS1</italic> overexpression can increase the maximum lifespan of the <italic>srs2</italic>&#x00394; mutant by 50&#x00025;. Secondly, <italic>SGS1</italic> overexpression has been reported to cause detrimental effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf202c18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf202c24">24</xref>). Thirdly, <italic>srs2</italic>&#x00394; cells over expressing <italic>SGS1</italic> actually show an increase in terminally budded morphologies as compared with control <italic>srs2</italic>&#x00394; mutants containing empty vector (data not shown). It is remarkable that high-copy <italic>SGS1</italic> can extend maximum lifespan in the face of such deleterious effects.</p></sec><sec><title>Cellular functions of Sgs1 and Srs2</title><p>Proteins involved in recombinational repair (e.g. Rad52) and post-replication repair (e.g. Rad6 and Rad18) play important roles in processing DNA lesions induced by MMS, in an analogous manner to that proposed for the processing of UV-induced lesions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf202c59">59</xref>). Srs2 is thought to channel lesions into post-replication repair pathways, whereas Sgs1 is thought to be more intimately involved in recombinational repair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf202c2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf202c57">57</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf202c60">60</xref>) (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf202f7">7</xref>). The ability of Sgs1 overexpression to process MMS-induced DNA damage in the <italic>srs2</italic>&#x00394; mutant implies that endogenous Sgs1 levels are normally limiting in the <italic>srs2</italic>&#x00394; mutant. This effect of Sgs1 overexpression may be to increase the efficiency of Sgs1&#x02019;s normal physiological function(s), thereby reducing the requirement for Srs2-dependent repair pathways. Alternatively, it may be that Sgs1 is capable of directly replacing Srs2, by processing substrates that would normally be dealt with by Srs2.</p><p>A variety of data support the notion that the <italic>sgs1</italic>&#x00394; and <italic>srs2</italic>&#x00394; phenotypes are a consequence of unrestrained recombination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf202c20">20</xref>). Consistent with this, mutations in the <italic>RAD51</italic> or <italic>RAD52</italic> genes can suppress the MMS sensitivity of the <italic>srs2</italic>&#x00394; mutant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf202c61">61</xref>), whereas overexpression of <italic>RAD51</italic> or <italic>RAD52</italic> enhances the MMS sensitivity of the <italic>srs2</italic>&#x00394; mutant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf202c62">62</xref>). Therefore, in the absence of Srs2, the Rad52-dependent recombination repair pathway is over-active (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf202c31">31</xref>), leading to aberrant processing of recombination intermediates and genomic instability (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf202f7">7</xref>). However, it is worth noting that, in addition to its well-established anti-recombinase function, Srs2 has recently been claimed to promote recombination in some circumstances (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf202c63">63</xref>). The absence of Sgs1 would also be predicted to cause aberrant processing of recombination intermediates as not only are the later steps of the homologous recombination repair pathway impaired (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf202c57">57</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf202c64">64</xref>), but also aberrant recombination intermediates cannot be &#x02018;salvaged&#x02019; by Sgs1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf202c14">14</xref>). This model is consistent with observations that the synthetic growth defect in <italic>sgs1srs2</italic> double mutants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf202c40">40</xref>) can be rescued by mutation of genes involved in homologous recombination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf202c20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf202c38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf202c39">39</xref>).</p><p>Although we favour the idea that Sgs1 overexpression rescues MMS sensitivity in the <italic>srs2</italic>&#x00394; mutant by suppressing unrestrained recombination, it remains possible that the ability of Sgs1 overexpression to compensate for lack of Srs2 is unrelated to DNA recombination. This possibility is supported by the fact that inactivation of the homologous recombination pathway does not suppress the severe synthetic growth defects observed in the <italic>S.pombe srs2</italic>&#x00394;<italic>rqh1</italic>&#x00394; double mutant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf202c29">29</xref>). Nevertheless, the fact that genetic interactions between <italic>SGS1&#x0002f;rqh1</italic><italic><sup>&#x0002b;</sup></italic> and <italic>SRS2</italic> are evident in two such evolutionarily divergent species further supports the notion of functional overlap between these DNA helicases. It will be of interest to assess if overexpression of <italic>rqh1</italic><italic><sup>&#x0002b;</sup></italic> can rescue any phenotypes of the <italic>S.pombe srs2</italic>&#x00394; mutant.</p></sec><sec><title>Wider implications of functional overlap between DNA helicases</title><p>These findings may have potentially important ramifications for studies of the human RecQ helicases. First, the physiological effects of overexpression of Sgs1 may warrant further characterisation, as higher levels of both the BLM and WRN helicases have been reported to exist in transformed cells and tumour cells, relative to those found in normal cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf202c65">65</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf202c66">66</xref>). Furthermore, the finding that RecQ helicases can show partial functional redundancy with other DNA repair pathways may be significant for the understanding of the functions of RecQ family members in maintenance of genomic stability. In addition to the functional overlap between Sgs1 and Srs2 demonstrated here, an extra copy of <italic>Ku70</italic>, a DNA repair helicase, can partially rescue the phenotypes of <italic>Drosophila</italic> lacking the RecQ helicase <italic>Dmblm</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf202c47">47</xref>). This functional overlap of DNA repair pathways implies that defects in human RecQ helicases would have more severe effects under conditions where the redundant pathways are limiting. This may be important in understanding the role of the human RecQ helicases in genomic stability, cancer and ageing.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="display-objects"><title>Figures and Tables</title><fig id="gkf202f1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p> The diploid <italic>srs2</italic>&#x00394; mutant has a shortened replicative lifespan and is sensitive to genotoxins.
