Completion of late stages of neuronal development depends on the presence of active &#x003b2; isoform (topo II&#x003b2;). The enzyme appears to aid the transcriptional induction of a limited number of genes essential for neuronal maturation. However, this selectivity and underlying molecular mechanism remains unknown. Here we show a strong correlation between the genomic location of topo II&#x003b2; action sites and the genes it regulates. These genes, termed group A1, are functionally biased towards membrane proteins with ion channel, transporter, or receptor activities. Significant proportions of them encode long transcripts and are juxtaposed to a long AT-rich intergenic region (termed LAIR). We mapped genomic sites directly targeted by topo II&#x003b2; using a functional immunoprecipitation strategy. These sites can be classified into two distinct classes with discrete local GC contents. One of the classes, termed c2, appears to involve a strand passage event between distant segments of genomic DNA. The c2 sites are concentrated both in A1 gene boundaries and the adjacent LAIR, suggesting a direct link between the action sites and the transcriptional activation. A higher-order chromatin structure associated with AT richness and gene poorness is likely to serve as a silencer of gene expression, which is abrogated by topo II&#x003b2; releasing nearby genes from repression. Positioning of these genes and their control machinery may have developed recently in vertebrate evolution to support higher functions of central nervous system.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="13"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>In the cell division cycle, gated passage for chromosomal DNA strands is an essential requirement for disentanglement of the DNA link between post-mitotic sister chromatids prior to segregation. The process is catalyzed by the &#x003b1; isoform of topo II that evolved from a single eukaryotic gene through a gene duplication event, which occurred around the time of vertebrate diversification. Topo II&#x003b1; and its counterpart &#x003b2; (topo II&#x003b2;) exhibit similar enzymatic properties on naked DNA <italic>in vitro</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004103-Drake1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>. However, as the timing and tissue specificity of expression differs substantially between these isoforms, it is a reasonable assumption that they share separate roles in cellular physiology. Two research groups, including our own, reported the evidence supporting this notion by showing that topo II&#x003b2; is required in the late stage of neural differentiation probably through transcriptional induction of neuronal genes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004103-Yang1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004103-Lyu1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>. More recently, other studies demonstrated the regulatory role of topo II&#x003b2; in the transcriptional activation of some inducible genes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004103-Ju1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004103-Perillo1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>. Use of expression arrays indicated that transcript levels of only a subset of genes are susceptible to depletion of topo II&#x003b2; in differentiating neural tissues <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004103-Tsutsui1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004103-Lyu2">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>. Why the enzyme controls only a fraction of genes remained unclear. To answer this question and to elucidate the mechanism of gene regulation by topo II&#x003b2;, we hypothesized that relative topographical relationship between topoisomerase action sites and the location of genes controlled by the enzyme should provide an important clue.</p><p>A group of topo II inhibitors such as etoposide, often called topoisomerase poisons, have been used to map the topo II action sites on DNA. The drug binds specifically to the enzyme and stabilizes the topo II-DNA covalent complex (cleavable complex) by preventing the ligation of the transiently cleaved DNA strands <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004103-Osheroff1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>. Upon addition of strong detergents, the complex is disrupted to liberate DNA fragments with denatured topo II protein covalently attached to their 5&#x02032;-termini <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004103-Liu1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>. The drug-induced cleavage sites are then mapped by measuring the distance from end-labeled restriction fragments by Southern blotting. Consensus nucleotide sequences surrounding the cleavage sites have been deduced from <italic>in vitro</italic> experiments with naked DNA and purified enzymes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004103-Sander1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004103-Burden1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>. As most topo II poisons are permeable into living cells, topo II sites <italic>in vivo</italic> was also mapped with various cell systems <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004103-Borde1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>. It was suggested that the <italic>in vivo</italic> cleavage sites are highly restricted by the local chromatin structure, being located mostly in the linker segment between phased nucleosomes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004103-Capranico1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004103-Kas1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>. In addition, topo II sites detected <italic>in vivo</italic> do not always coincide with strong naked DNA sites but often correspond to only minor <italic>in vitro</italic> sites. It is clear then that the topo II cleavage consensus <italic>in vitro</italic> is inadequate to predict its <italic>in vivo</italic> sites. It has been generally accepted that topo II cleavage sites are within an AT-rich region often in the vicinity of the matrix attachment region (MAR/SAR) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004103-Cockerill1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>. However, a large-scale or genome-wide mapping of <italic>in vivo</italic> topo II action sites has not been attempted.</p><p>The mapping technique used in the present study also utilizes etoposide to enrich the reaction intermediate, but the enzyme-DNA complex was recovered by lysing the cells in milder conditions without strong denaturants <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004103-Lee1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>. After fragmentation of chromosomal DNA, the topo II&#x003b2; -DNA covalent complex was concentrated by immunoprecipitation with specific antibody. Resulting DNA fragments were amplified by ligation-mediated PCR and hybridized to tiling arrays to determine their genomic positions. This protocol is similar to chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) except that the cross-linking is based on the formation of topo II-specific reaction intermediate. Thus, the procedure can be regarded as &#x0201c;functional ChIP&#x0201d;. The use of mild conditions for arresting the intermediate brought about two advantages. First, as topo II&#x003b2; was linked to DNA mostly through single strand breakage, the cleavage site resided within the fragment and both ends were available for ligation of amplification primers. Second, the other DNA strand, which is transferred through the cleaved strand, remains associated with the enzyme in the immunoprecipitate. This DNA fragment can be recovered in a separate fraction by a stringent washing when it is not contiguous to the cleaved strand. This topo II site mapping strategy, combined with expression array analysis of topo II&#x003b2;-regulated genes, enabled us to identify AT-rich genomic sites that appear to be essential for linking topo II&#x003b2; action to its target genes.</p><p>Because of complicated terminology used in the study, we provide an explanatory document in Supporting Information to avoid possible confusions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0004103.s001">Text S1</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><p>In the primary culture of newborn cerebellar tissue that we used in this study, only precursor granule neurons can survive after the final division <italic>in vitro</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004103-Raetzman1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>. It is a useful experimental system to study the transcriptional induction of neuronal genes during the post-mitotic differentiation that proceeds spontaneously and almost synchronously. In addition, topo II&#x003b2; is the only target of topo II-specific inhibitors since these cells do not express topo II&#x003b1; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004103-Tsutsui1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>. Expression of topo II&#x003b2; can be inhibited specifically throughout the culture period if ICRF-193, a topo II-specific inhibitor, was added daily.</p><sec id="s2a"><title>Unique identity of topo II&#x003b2;-induced genes</title><p>We first categorized the genes expressed in differentiating cerebellar neurons by analyzing the expression array data on the basis of combination of two factors: induction rate during differentiation and susceptibility to ICRF-193. The inhibitor not only inhibits the activity but also depletes the enzyme by selective degradation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004103-Isik1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>, practically knocking it down at the protein level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004103-g001">Figure 1A</xref>). The array data were plotted as a scattered graph of fold-induction versus fold-inhibition and the corresponding genes were classified into 9 groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004103-g001">Figure 1B</xref>). Groups A1, A2, B2, and unexpressed genes (group D) comprised about 90&#x00025; of analyzed genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004103-g001">Figure 1C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0004103.s007">Figure S5A</xref>). The group A1 that makes up only 2.6&#x00025; is the primary target of the present study since these genes are up-regulated depending on topo II&#x003b2;. A2 genes are also up-regulated but are not susceptible to the topo II inhibitor. B2 genes, the largest group, are expressed constitutively and independently of topo II&#x003b2;. The array results were confirmed by reverse transcription-quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) experiments for representative genes from each group (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0004103.s002">Data S1</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0004103.s003">Figure S1</xref>). Knocking down topo II&#x003b2; by RNA interference, instead of ICRF-193, was not suitable for our experimental strategy since some A1 genes got already induced before topo II&#x003b2; level was significantly reduced. However, auxiliary use of the inhibitor at the initial step of the culture demonstrated that topo II&#x003b2; siRNA is also effective to inhibit the A1 gene induction (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0004103.s004">Figure S2</xref>).</p><fig id="pone-0004103-g001" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0004103.g001</object-id><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>Topo II&#x003b2; is required for the induction of selective genes in differentiating cerebellar granule cells.</title><p>(A) The protocol outline for the analysis of gene expression in rat granule cells in culture.

GO terms related to neuronal function (channel, transporter, receptor activities) were clearly over-represented in A1 genes whereas the same terms were not enriched in A2 and were under-represented in B2 genes. Characteristic GO terms in A2 genes were extracellular matrix and anion transport (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0004103.s018">Table S5</xref>). Thus, A1 and A2 are functionally distinct gene groups although their expression levels both increase during differentiation. As expected, the GO analysis showed that B2 genes are mostly housekeeping genes. Interestingly, unexpressed genes (group D) shared considerable GO terms with A1 genes, suggesting that this gene group might behave like A1 in other neural tissues or in other developmental stages.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Genomic environment of A1 genes</title><p>We next explored how A1 genes are physically different from the other gene groups. When locating A1 genes on genome browser displays, we noticed that they frequently reside close to large gene-poor regions that are mostly AT-rich. For this type of analysis, we first constructed a rat genome compilation (exRefSeq) by combining the data from rat, mouse, and human RefSeq genes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0004103.s005">Figure S3</xref>). The rat genome was then divided into genic and intergenic regions and they were further classified into four classes each by length and GC content (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0004103.s006">Figure S4</xref>). In the present report, the word &#x0201c;genic&#x0201d; stands for transcribed regions of protein-coding genes. The intergenic region named LAIR (long AT-rich intergenic region) has a large genomic coverage (50&#x00025; of intergenic and 35&#x00025; of total genome). About 11&#x00025; of rat genes were juxtaposed to LAIR (designated LAIR proximal). GC contents of LAIR-proximal genes were clearly biased towards AT-rich side in base composition as compared with genes that are not juxtaposed to LAIR (LAIR distal) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004103-g002">Figure 2A</xref>). When compared with other classified gene groups, a higher proportion of A1 genes (24&#x00025;) were LAIR proximal with statistical significance (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0004103.s007">Figure S5B</xref>). Furthermore, the LAIR-proximal A1 gene contained a distinct population of large genes (&#x0003e;74 kb) as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004103-g002">Figure 2B</xref>. No such subpopulation was present in other gene groups as well as in LAIR-distal genes (not shown).</p><fig id="pone-0004103-g002" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0004103.g002</object-id><label>Figure 2</label><caption><title>A1 genes occupy a unique position in the genome.</title><p>(A) Genes juxtaposed to LAIR (LAIR proximal) are more AT-rich than the rest of the genes (LAIR distal).

The category of genes with all these characters will be referred to as &#x0201c;LA genes&#x0201d; hereafter. We adopt the average gene length (51 kb) and overall GC content (0.44) to define the thresholds (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0004103.s006">Figure S4</xref>). A two dimensional representation of these variables showed that about 80&#x00025; of LAIR-proximal but only 10&#x00025; of LAIR-distal A1 genes are long and AT-rich (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004103-g002">Figure 2C</xref>). The proportion of LA gene in total A1 genes was significantly higher than that of other gene groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004103-g002">Figure 2D</xref>). The strong link between A1 and LA genes was further demonstrated by the gene ontology analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004103-g002">Figure 2E</xref>). A higher proportion of A1 genes (68&#x00025;) shared statistically significant GO terms with LA gene as compared to other gene groups (see also <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0004103.s008">Figure S6</xref>).</p><p>Based on these results, it should be possible to predict LAIR-proximal A1 genes without knowing their actual response to topo II inhibitors. To test this, from the genes without any assigned array probes (group N), we selected five LA genes that are up-regulated during the cerebellar differentiation and sharing similar GO terms with A1 genes. Expression profiles analyzed by RT-qPCR showed that 4 out of 5 candidate genes indeed behave like A1 genes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0004103.s009">Figure S7</xref>), corroborating the hypothesis that topo II&#x003b2; requirement for transcriptional induction of a gene is closely related to its genomic environment.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Mapping of topo II&#x003b2; action sites</title><p>As a next step, we intended to locate direct action sites of topo II&#x003b2; on DNA, not just binding sites. This can be done by using etoposide, a topoisomerase poison, which stabilizes the reaction intermediate to cross-link the enzyme to DNA at the site of action. The enzyme-DNA complex was recovered by immunoprecipitation with specific antibody. We name this technique eTIP for etoposide-mediated topoisomerase immunoprecipitation (shown schematically in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004103-g003">Figure 3A</xref>). Treatment of the topo II-DNA complex with strong denaturants like SDS generates a double strand DNA break with denatured enzyme covalently attached to 5&#x02032;-ends. In the present study, however, we applied milder conditions with a combination of detergent (Sarkosyl) and high salt (CsCl) to preserve the topo II dimer structure attached to a segment of DNA (G-segment) through a single strand break. An important consequence here was that the other segment (T-segment) is also trapped noncovalently and released later by high-salt treatment when it is not contiguous to the cleaved strand (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004103-g003">Figure 3A, Step 5</xref>).</p><fig id="pone-0004103-g003" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0004103.g003</object-id><label>Figure 3</label><caption><title>The two segments of DNA interacting with topo II&#x003b2; in action can be separated by e-TIP.</title><p>(A) Schematic representation of the eTIP/tiling array procedure.

It should be noted that in this system G- and T-segments are contiguous in one strand and no DNA will be released in P2 fraction but complete reversion of the intermediate after immunoprecipitation step would generate closed circles in P2. The nuclear extract contains topoisomerase I activity and supercoiled substrate was completely relaxed in the absence of ATP, whereas nuclease activity in the extract was negligible (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004103-g003">Figure 3C</xref>, lane 2). When the reaction was stopped by Sarkosyl-CsCl under the conditions used for eTIP, open circular form II DNA was generated depending on etoposide (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004103-g003">Figure 3C, lane 4</xref>) and immunoprecipitated by topo II&#x003b2; antibody (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004103-g003">Figure 3D</xref>).

No form II or form Ir relaxed DNA was detected in P2 fraction indicating that the enzyme-DNA complex is not dissociated from the beads and reversal of the cleavage does not take place in the stringent washing conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004103-g003">Figure 3D</xref>). As expected, form III DNA instead of form II DNA was detected in P1 fraction when SDS was used in place of Sarkosyl-CsCl to stop the reaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004103-g003">Figure 3D</xref>).</p><p>To evaluate the specificity of eTIP, DNA yields in the eTIP fractions were compared in four conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004103-g003">Figure 3E</xref>). Cell lysates from granule cells with or without etoposide treatment were immunoprecipitated with either control mouse IgG or anti-topo II&#x003b2; monoclonal antibody. The DNA yields in both P1 and P2 fractions were dependent on etoposide treatment and antibody specificity, indicating that DNA in both fractions derived from the arrested intermediate of topo II&#x003b2;. To see whether topo II&#x003b2; is present in P2 fraction, nuclease-treated fractions were subjected to Western blotting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004103-g003">Figure 3F</xref>). Absence of topo II&#x003b2; protein in P2 fraction is consistent with the notion that substantial amount of DNA in P2 most likely originates from the T-segment trapped in the topo II&#x003b2; CC<sub>ssb</sub>, and not from salt-labile antibody-enzyme interactions.</p><p>For genome-wide mapping of topo II&#x003b2; action sites (termed toposites), the eTIP DNA fractions were prepared at the second day of granule cell differentiation. We chose this timing because mRNA expression is maximally induced by day 3 in many A1 genes (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0004103.s003">Figure S1</xref>), indicating that the involvement of topo II&#x003b2; in gene induction starts before day 3. In addition, our previous study showed that topo II&#x003b2; is required only in the early period of culture <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004103-Tsutsui1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>. DNA fragments purified from P1 and P2 fractions were hybridized to tiling arrays. In designing the array, we selected 7 genomic regions (about 79 Mb in total), each containing at least one A1 gene. A correlational analysis with statistically significant P1 signals from the array data suggested that P1 DNA is composed of two components (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004103-g004">Figure 4A</xref>). Multi-factor clustering of P1 signals against P2 signals and local GC content clearly separated the toposites into 2 classes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004103-g004">Figure 4B</xref>). The scatter graph indicates that one of the classes, labeled c1, was detected only in P1 fraction whereas c2 was present in both P1 and P2 fractions. The frequency distribution also showed that the two factors used for the clustering are well discriminated in the resulting classes: the c1 site depleted from P2 is GC-rich and the c2 site enriched in both P1 and P2 is AT-rich (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004103-g004">Figure 4C</xref>). These results were consistent with the preliminary observation obtained by shotgun cloning of eTIP DNA fractions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0004103.s010">Figure S8</xref>).</p><fig id="pone-0004103-g004" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0004103.g004</object-id><label>Figure 4</label><caption><title>Mapping of topo II&#x003b2; action sites reveals two distinctive genomic targets.</title><p>(A) Analysis of eTIP DNA fractions on tiling arrays showed a binary nature of the composition of P1 DNA as plotted against P2/input or local GC content around toposites (&#x000b1;250 bp from the probe centre).

Unique positions on the genome are labeled A or B, which can be either G-segment or T-segment (both cases are depicted). The c1 toposite shown on the left column does not generate free DNA in P2 fraction. This situation corresponds to the model experiment with plasmid DNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004103-g003">Figure 3B</xref>). If the distance between A and B are larger than &#x0223c;5 kb, these sites are likely to reside on separate fragments since the average fragment size is less than 5 kb. In this case both genomic regions (A and B) are detected in both DNA fractions (P1 and P2) and the action site is classified as c2.</p><p>Positions of c1 and c2 toposites in all the analyzed chromosomal regions are illustrated in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0004103.s011">Figure S9</xref>. As expected, the pattern of global toposite distribution appeared to reflect the local GC content. Although less frequently, toposites were detected also in unexpressed genes (group D) and in genes whose expression is independent of topo II&#x003b2;.

As a whole, less than one toposite was present in every 10 kb for both c1 and c2 sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004103-g005">Figure 5A, B</xref>). These sites, however, were concentrated or depleted in particular genomic regions depending on their regional GC contents. As defined in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0004103.s006">Figure S4</xref>, genomic regions were classified into 8 classes. c1 sites are clearly enriched in GC-rich genic regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004103-g005">Figure 5A</xref>). The c1 site enrichment in short GC-rich intergenic regions may reflect promoters within gene-dense genomic areas (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0004103.s011">Figure S9</xref>). For both genic and intergenic regions, c2 sites are largely depleted from GC-rich regions and concentrated in long AT-rich regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004103-g005">Figure 5B</xref>). The tiled region contained 318 genes, of which 140 (44&#x00025;) harbored more than one toposite per gene and 32 (10&#x00025;) were LA genes. A large proportion of LA gene (81&#x00025;) contained toposites as compared to non-LA genes (40&#x00025;). When classified toposite densities in the genic region were compared, c1 sites were significantly enriched in non-LA genes, whereas c2 sites were concentrated in LA genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004103-g005">Figure 5C</xref>).</p><fig id="pone-0004103-g005" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0004103.g005</object-id><label>Figure 5</label><caption><title>Patterns of toposite distribution corroborate the involvement of topo II&#x003b2; in the transcriptional regulation of A1 genes.</title><p>Regional frequency of toposites expressed by number of sites per 10 kb (site density).

A discrete peak of c1 site was detected around TSS in A1 and D groups, while A2 gene exhibited multiple c1 peaks around TSS and inside the gene. Distribution of c1 sites in the 3&#x02032; region of A1 and A2 genes was more irregular but appeared to be confined within the transcription unit. In contrast to c1 sites, c2 sites were basically restricted to A1 genes. When A1 genes were sorted into two groups, LAIR proximal (A1p) and LAIR distal (A1d), it is now clear that c2 sites are located exclusively around A1p genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004103-g005">Figure 5E</xref>). All the LAIR-proximal A1 genes found in the tiled region were LA genes whose promoters were present inside the adjacent LAIR (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0004103-t001">Table 1</xref>). Thus, c2 sites are likely to be essential for the regulated expression of LA genes.

The G-segment contains the transient gap generated by the enzyme for the passage of T-segment. Under the conditions used in the eTIP procedure, the enzyme-DNA intermediate is converted mainly to a form with a single-strand breakage at the site of action, suggesting that the cleavage sites on G-segments are concentrated in the P1 DNA fraction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004103-g003">Figure 3A</xref>). The DNA yield experiments demonstrate the specificity of recovered DNA fragments in terms of etoposide treatment and binding to topo II&#x003b2;. The absence of DNA in the P2 fraction without etoposide treatment is a strong evidence for the assumption that P2 DNA is directly associated with the reaction intermediate of topo II&#x003b2;, not just with the enzyme. It also indicates that little nonspecific DNA is contaminating the P2 DNA fraction, implying that the stringency of washing conditions in Step 4 is sufficient. Thus, the DNA in P2 fraction is closely involved in the topoisomerase reaction and most likely representing the T-segments that are trapped between the subunits of the enzyme through noncovalent interactions. The successful retention (Step 2) and release (Step 5) of T-segments in the eTIP procedure may be accounted for by the difference in the chaotropic potential of the cations used in these steps: Cs<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> and Na<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>, respectively.</p><p>The characteristic partitioning of DNA fragments into eTIP fractions (P1 and P2) provided an important clue to understanding the mechanism of topo II&#x003b2; action <italic>in vivo</italic>.

We suppose that 1) the enzyme can recruit any part of the genome as G- or T-segment. 2) The enzyme has little preference as to which segment should be G or T. 3) If G- and T-segments are on different DNA fragments, the eTIP procedure sorts these DNA segments into P1 and P2 fractions, respectively. When G- and T-segments are closely positioned on the genome, for instance less than 5 kb, both segments will be recovered in P1 and the site is classified as class 1 (c1). In this case, the most probable topological change caused by the reaction is the relaxation of superhelical turns that are built up locally <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004103-Salceda1">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref>. This reaction may facilitate the initiation or elongation steps of transcription. In contrast, when these DNA segments are located distantly, they are inevitably separated into P1 and P2 fractions interchangeably and the site is classified as class 2 (c2). An essential prerequisite for this type of reaction is the formation of a DNA crossing, which is preferentially recognized by topo II <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004103-Zechiedrich1">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref>. Since the crossed DNA segments can either be G- or T-segment by chance, they are fractionated into both IP fractions, P1 and P2. These crossings should occur more frequently at the base of chromatin loops that are maintained by the interaction between MAR and the nuclear matrix. This is consistent with the fact that MAR is usually found in AT-rich region like c2 toposites. The strand passage at inter-loop c2 sites causes catenation or decatenation between the loops that are equivalent to topologically independent DNA circles. These topological changes may induce the decondensation of local chromatin structure <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004103-Martins1">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref>, leading to the formation of active initiation complex for productive transcription.</p><fig id="pone-0004103-g006" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0004103.g006</object-id><label>Figure 6</label><caption><title>A model that explains the topographical relationship of <italic>in vivo</italic> toposites and target genes.</title><p>(A) Possible link between the reaction mechanism of type II DNA topoisomerases and the generation of two classes of toposites.

When the down-regulated genes in the knockout mice were compared to our results, a significant proportion of them were A1 genes or LA genes, being consistent with the idea that similar subsets of genes with similar genomic locations are controlled by topo II&#x003b2; in the late stages of neuronal development (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0004103.s012">Figure S10</xref>).

In these cases, however, the enzyme mostly targets the promoter region of non-LA genes. We further noticed a striking parallelism between our findings and the widespread monoallelic expression of human autosomal genes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004103-Gimelbrant1">&#x0005b;25&#x0005d;</xref>. Large fraction of monoallelically expressed genes encodes cell surface and membrane proteins. All the GO terms over-represented in these genes with high statistical confidence (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0004103.s016">Table S3</xref> in the report) coincided with those terms for LA gene (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0004103.s018">Table S5</xref>). Re-analysis of their data indeed showed a high incidence of LA genes in the monoallelic expression group (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0004103.s013">Figure S11</xref>). Similarly, a large proportion of autism-related genes identified in the recent report <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004103-Morrow1">&#x0005b;26&#x0005d;</xref> were LA genes (data not shown). Since LA genes contain many neuronal genes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0004103.s018">Table S5</xref>), their monoallelic expression would predict a cellular mosaicism and may explain a phenotypic polymorphism of psychotic conditions or even personality variations in normal individuals. Apparent similarity between LAIR and gene deserts <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004103-Ovcharenko1">&#x0005b;27&#x0005d;</xref> or lamina-associated domains (LADs) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004103-Guelen1">&#x0005b;28&#x0005d;</xref> is also worth noting.</p><p>The c2 toposite identified in this study is unique in that it involves two segments of DNA from distant genomic locations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004103-g006">Figure 6A</xref>). According to the model, it is possible that the TSS region of LA gene is in contact with internal sites of the adjacent LAIR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004103-g006">Figure 6B</xref>). This type of interaction may repress the transcription of LA genes by condensing the chromatin structure of promoter region. This is consistent with the fact that promoters for 9 out of 10 LAIR-proximal A1 genes in the tiled region are on the LAIR side (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0004103-t001">Table 1</xref>). The same situation is noted in the promoters of LAD-associated genes that are positioned adjacent to LADs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004103-Guelen1">&#x0005b;28&#x0005d;</xref>. A long-distance physical contact between inactive genes and the gene&#x02013;poor or inactive genomic regions has also been demonstrated for the inactive &#x003b2;-globin gene in mouse embryonic brain, but not the one actively transcribed in the liver, by a chromosome conformation capture technique (4C) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004103-Simonis1">&#x0005b;29&#x0005d;</xref>. We propose that LA genes are a distinct category of genes and topo II&#x003b2; plays a novel regulatory role by liberating them from the transcriptional repression exerted by juxtaposed LAIR. While the activation mechanism of lamina-associated genes is totally unknown, topo II&#x003b2; would be the first candidate for such factors that are actively involved in the gene activation process. In the present study we focused on c2 sites and LA genes but roles of c1 sites in the control of non-LA genes are less clear at present and should be addressed in future studies.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Animal handling</title><p>All experiments were carried out under the control of the Animal Research Control Committee in accordance with the Regulation for Animal Experiments of Okayama University Medical School.

The arrays were tiled with isothermal 50 to 75-mer oligos that were placed at 1 probe/100 bp on repeat-masked genomic sequence. Hybridization and scanning of the fluorescence intensities were performed at NimbleGen (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.nimblegen.com/">http://www.nimblegen.com/</ext-link>). Briefly, amplified DNA preparations were labeled with Cy5 (P1 and P2) or Cy3 (IP input) and were hybridized competitively to the array with Cot-1 DNA. Scanned data were processed by the supplier's standard protocol for ChIP-chip analysis to obtain the scaled log<sub>2</sub> (Cy5/Cy3 ratio).</p><p>The log<sub>2</sub> (P1/input) and log<sub>2</sub> (P2/input) values were used for the computational analysis named ACME (Algorithm for Capturing Microarray Enrichment) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004103-Scacheri1">&#x0005b;33&#x0005d;</xref> to identify genomic sites enriched for topo II&#x003b2; action sites. The window size was set to 1,000 bp and the threshold to 90&#x00025;. We calculated the probability values based on hypergeometric distribution instead of chi-square distribution, which is used in the original ACME. The array probes associated with probability values smaller than 10<sup>&#x02212;4.5</sup> were adopted as toposites. To classify the toposites, significant P1 signals were subjected to cluster analysis (Ward's method) between two factors, log<sub>2</sub> (P2/input) and local GC content around toposites. Toposites were clearly separated into two clusters of comparable size: low P2 signal-high GC content (class 1) and high P2 signal-low GC content (class 2). The tiling array data were deposited in GEO (GSE13145).</p><p>We scanned the distribution of class 1 (c1) and class 2 (c2) toposites along the genome by using a sliding-window algorithm. With respect to the probes that were recognized as a toposite by ACME, the likelihood of being toposite was split and distributed evenly to every nucleotide across the probe. Namely, the inverse of probe length in number of nucleotides was defined as a &#x0201c;positional toposite potential&#x0201d; assigned to every nucleotide position within the toposite probe. To assess the toposite density around the transcription start sites (TSS) and termination sites (TTS) of 318 transcription units located in the tiled region, toposite potentials within &#x000b1;10 kb from these sites were counted. The potential scores were then added up in every gene groups of interest that were aligned at TSS or TTS. Resulting figures were divided by the number of genes constituting the group in order to enable the comparison between different gene groups. Entire region of the 20 kb-potential map was scanned with a moving window of 1-bp step and 1,000-bp width. Sum of the potential scores within the window was plotted at the centre position as a toposite density. The highest density score would be 10 by definition. For a control, the same numbers of toposites were picked up randomly as Monte Carlo simulation of 10-times repetition and the toposite density was calculated as stated above.</p></sec><sec id="s4l"><title>Shotgun cloning and sequencing</title><p>The eTIP DNA fractions (P1 and P2) amplified by LM-PCR were blunt-ended with T4 DNA polymerase (New England Biolabs), ligated into the <italic>Eco</italic>RV site of a zero-background cloning vector pZErO-2.1 (Invitrogen) and transformed into <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> TOP10F' competent cells (Invitrogen). The transformants were screened by colony PCR using AmpliTaq Gold DNA polymerase (Applied Biosystems) with M13RV and M13(-21) vector primers. The nucleotide sequences of eTIP clones were determined by direct sequencing of the amplified fragments on the DNA sequencer 310 according to standard methods (Applied Biosystems). Genomic positions of resulting sequences were determined on the rat genome (rn3) by BLAT search performed at the UCSC genome browser website (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://genome.ucsc.edu">http://genome.ucsc.edu</ext-link>).
