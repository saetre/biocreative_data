Linkage studies have shown association of markers in the proximity of the <italic>CD154 </italic>gene. In the present work we investigated whether specific allele variants of the microsatellite in the 3' UTR of the <italic>CD154 </italic>gene might modulate the risk of RA. The study, in a case-control setting, included 189 patients and 150 healthy controls from the Canary Islands, Spain. The <italic>24CAs </italic>allele was less represented in female patients than in controls (0.444 in controls versus 0.307 in patients, <italic>P </italic>= 0.006, odds ratio (OR) 0.556, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.372 to 0.831) but not in males (0.414 versus 0.408), and only when homozygous (<italic>P </italic>= 0.012; OR 0.35, 95% CI 0.16 to 0.77). We also verified that CD154 association with RA was independent of human leukocyte antigen (HLA) phenotype. A further functional study showed that after stimulation anti-CD3, CD154 mRNA was more stable in CD4<sup>+ </sup>T lymphocytes from patients with RA bearing the <italic>24CAs </italic>allele (mRNA half-life 208 minutes) than in patients without the <italic>24CAs </italic>allele (109 minutes, <italic>P </italic>= 0.009). However, a lower percentage of CD154<sup>+</sup>CD4<sup>+ </sup>T lymphocytes was seen in freshly isolated peripheral blood mononuclear cells from patients carrying <italic>24CAs </italic>alleles (mean 4.28 versus 8.12; <italic>P </italic>= 0.033), and also in CD4<sup>+ </sup>T lymphocytes stimulated with anti-CD3 (median 29.40 versus 47.60; <italic>P </italic>= 0.025). These results were concordant with the smaller amounts of CD154 mRNA isolated from stimulated T lymphocytes with <italic>24CAs </italic>alleles. The <italic>CD154 </italic>microsatellite therefore seems to affect the expression of the gene in a complex manner that implies not only mRNA stability. These data suggest that the <italic>CD154 </italic>microsatellite contributes to the regulation of mRNA and protein expression, although further studies will be necessary to elucidate its role in disease predisposition.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Introduction</title><p>Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic relapsing inflammatory condition of unknown etiology [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. The disease is characterized by persistent inflammatory synovitis leading to joint destruction and is sometimes associated with systemic involvement [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Clinical expression of the disease ranges from a mild, non-deforming arthropathy with little long-term disability, to severe, incapacitating, deforming arthritis, which may be refractory to conventional disease-modifying agents [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Because early prescription of a disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drug may be more effective in controlling severe disease, early diagnosis and prediction of severity are important [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. The identification of markers associated with susceptibility to or severity of RA is therefore currently an important task.</p><p>Twin and family studies provide evidence to support the involvement of both genetic and environmental factors in the etiopathogenesis of RA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. Epidemiological studies show an important genetic background in RA, with the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) region showing the strongest association with disease predisposition, although the contribution of the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) genes has been estimated to be no more than 30 to 50% to the total genetic background [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. Thus, several other genes outside the MHC locus are likely to be involved, probably each contributing a small amount to the genetic predisposition to RA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. Recent findings from linkage studies have drawn attention to several regions that probably contain candidate genes, namely 1p, 5q, 8p, 12, 13, 18q, 21q and the X chromosome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>], for which association studies are needed.</p><p>It is believed that the pathology and etiology of RA involve abnormal presentation of self antigen(s) by antigen-presenting cells (APCs) and the activation of autoreactive T cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. Several costimulatory molecules are involved during interactions between APCs and T cells, namely CD40 and CD40 ligand (CD154), which are required for the amplification of the inflammatory response [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. In RA, T cells expressing CD40 ligand infiltrate the synovial fluid and interact with fibroblasts expressing CD40, which induces fibroblast proliferation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>], increased recruitment of inflammatory cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>], and the production of tumor necrosis factor-&#x003b1; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. In addition, the production of IL-12 by synovial fluid macrophages, which is required for the initiation of T helper type 1 (Th1) cell responses, is regulated by the CD40&#x02013;CD154 interaction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. Because RA is mediated by Th1 cells, CD40&#x02013;CD154 interaction may be an important pathogenic pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. Indeed, CD4<sup>+ </sup>T cells from patients with RA have an increased expression of CD154 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>] that is still observed 5 to 12 years after disease onset, indicating augmented and prolonged activation of T cells.</p><p>The <italic>CD154 </italic>gene is located on the X chromosome and belongs to the tumor necrosis factor gene family [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. It contains a dinucleotide repeat of cytosine-adenine (CA) in the 3' UTR that because of its location may have some bearing on the regulation of gene expression. Although CD154 is regulated both temporally and with respect to the cell type, the underlying mechanisms responsible for this control have not yet been completely elucidated. <italic>CD154 </italic>gene transcription is induced by TCR signaling and expression is enhanced in response to costimulatory signals. Transcriptional regulation seems to be dependent on NF-AT and NF-&#x003ba;B binding sites located in the promoter region [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. Binding sites for AP-1 and a CD28 response element have also been described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>], and a NF-&#x003ba;B binding site with enhancer activity has been found downstream of the poly(A) signal site [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. In addition to transcriptional regulation, it has been shown that post-transcriptional regulation also has a crucial role in modulating the expression of the <italic>CD154 </italic>gene. As with other cytokine genes, the 3' UTR of the <italic>CD154 </italic>mRNA contains binding sites for RNA&#x02013;protein complexes that are responsible for the lability of the mRNA. It has been found that the mRNA decay rate can be specifically modified in some situations, and the protein complexes involved in this regulation are being characterized [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. It has been proposed that a putative stability complex binds specifically to a highly pyrimidine-rich region in the 3' UTR, and this complex seems to be directly involved in regulating the variable decay rate of <italic>CD154 </italic>mRNA during T cell activation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>].</p><p>Allele distribution for the dinucleotide-repeat polymorphism located in the 3' UTR of the <italic>CD154 </italic>gene has previously been investigated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. Allele variants of this polymorphism have been found to be associated with RA in a subgroup of German patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>] and with systemic lupus erythematosus in Spaniards [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>] but not with multiple sclerosis in Nordic patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. The aim of the present work was to study whether specific allele variants of this gene might modulate the risk of RA in Spaniards from the Canary Islands. We also investigated the influence of the allele variants of <italic>CD154 </italic>on mRNA and protein expression in peripheral-blood T cells from patients with RA.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Patients and controls</title><p>The study used a case-control design to compare patients and controls. A total of 189 patients diagnosed with RA according to the American College of Rheumatology criteria were enrolled at the Rheumatology Unit at the Dr Negrin General Hospital from Gran Canaria (Canary Islands, Spain). The median age at onset of RA was 45 years (interquartile range 27 to 63 years) and the median disease duration was 13 years (interquartile range 2 to 24); 74% of the patients with RA were female, 78% were positive for rheumatoid factor, 80% had demonstrated erosions, and 31% presented extra-articular manifestations. All had received antimalarials or disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs. Control subjects (150 in all; namely 70 males and 80 females) matched by age and geography and with no history of inflammatory arthritis were recruited. All participants gave their written informed consent.</p></sec><sec><title>Samples</title><p>Peripheral blood was obtained from patients and controls, and genomic DNA was extracted by digestion with proteinase K and extraction with phenol/chloroform [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>] (Sigma-Aldrich, St Louis, MO, USA).

Allele assignment was performed by densitometry with the Quantity One<sup>&#x000ae; </sup>Software (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA, USA). The length of the amplified fragment was estimated by reference to the standards used as internal ladder, and the number of repeats was calculated from the published sequence (GenBank accession number <ext-link ext-link-type="gen" xlink:href="D31797">D31797</ext-link>).

Cells were cultured at 5 &#x000d7; 10<sup>5 </sup>cells/ml on anti-CD3 coated plates with 62.5 ng/ml anti-CD28 soluble mAb for 6, 24, 48, 72, or 92 hours, depending on the assay.</p></sec><sec><title>mRNA decay assays</title><p>Expanded T cells, once they were resting, were restimulated with anti-CD3 plus anti-CD28 for 6 or 24 hours as mentioned above. Then, 10 &#x003bc;g/ml actinomycin D (ActD; Sigma-Aldrich), a transcriptional inhibitor, was added to the culture and aliquots of cells were collected at different time points for RNA extraction. Total RNA was isolated by the guanidinium thiocyanate method by using the Trizol reagent (Gibco) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>] and transcribed to cDNA with AMV reverse transcriptase (Roche Diagnostics, Gmbh, Mannheim, Germany), in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions. <italic>CD154 </italic>mRNA was measured by using a quantitative competitive PCR kit for human CD154 (Maxim Bio, San Francisco, CA, USA), in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions. Then, 10 &#x003bc;l of each reaction was subjected to electrophoresis on 2% NuSieve 3:1 agarose gels (Cambrex Bio Science Rockland, Rockland, MA, USA), and revealed by staining with ethidium bromide (Sigma-Aldrich). PCR products were quantified by using the Quantity One Software with reference to the standard from the kit. In this technique, serial dilutions of known quantities of PCR competitor are added to PCR reactions containing a constant amount of target cDNA. The molar ratio of PCR and competitor remains constant during the reaction, so the initial amount of target cDNA molecules can be calculated from the known number of competitor molecules added to the reaction as [(moles of target CD154 RNA) &#x000d7; (6 &#x000d7; 10<sup>23 </sup>molecules per mole) &#x000d7; (dilution factor of test RNA)]/(&#x003bc;g of total RNA). The number of CD154 mRNA molecules, quantified as indicated above, was then corrected for the proportion of CD4<sup>+ </sup>cells in each sample and expressed as molecules per &#x003bc;g of total RNA in CD4<sup>+ </sup>T lymphocytes, assuming equal RNA content between T cell subtypes. For the determination of mRNA half-lives (<italic>t</italic><sub>1/2</sub>), fractions of <italic>CD154 </italic>mRNA remaining after the addition of ActD were plotted against time after ActD addition. After exponential adjustment of curves, mRNA half-lives were calculated as the time in which the fraction of mRNA remaining decreased to 50% of the initial amount.</p></sec><sec><title>CD154 surface expression</title><p>Freshly isolated PBMCs or stimulated T cell suspensions were washed and stained with anti-human CD45, CD3, CD14, CD4, CD69, CD25, and CD154 mAbs (all from BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA, USA). Labeled cells were then analyzed in a FACSort flow cytometer with the CellQuest<sup>&#x000ae; </sup>software (BD Immunocytometry Systems, San Jose, CA, USA). The percentage of CD154-positive cells was calculated by subtracting overlaid CD154 and isotype control (Ig) histograms. Mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) was quantified on a linear scale as the ratio of the geometric mean of the CD154-phycoerythrin antibodies against the irrelevant anti-mouse-IgG-phycoerythrin antibodies of total CD4<sup>+ </sup>T cells.</p></sec><sec><title>Apoptosis assays</title><p>Apoptotic cells in culture were detected by staining with fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-labeled annexin-V (Roche Diagnostics) and propidium iodide (Sigma-Aldrich).

Differences in allele/genotype frequencies between patients and healthy control subjects were tested by the &#x003c7;<sup>2 </sup>method, using the Yates or Bonferroni correction or Fisher's exact test when appropriate. The strength of association between RA and alleles of <italic>CD154</italic>, <italic>DRB1 </italic>and <italic>DQB1 </italic>was estimated by using odds ratios (ORs) and the exact limits of the 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Estimation of the statistical power for the comparison of allele frequencies was performed with the STPLAN software. The arcsin approximation of the binomial distributions of allele frequencies was used with a two-sided test and with &#x003b1; fixed at 0.05. To examine interactions between variables associated with RA we conducted a multivariate analysis with a binary logistic regression model. Surface expression levels of <italic>CD154 </italic>mRNA and CD154 protein were compared by using the non-parametric Mann&#x02013;Whitney test.

However, comparison of the frequencies of each allele between patients and controls showed differences for the <italic>24CAs </italic>allele (0.32 versus 0.44; <italic>P </italic>= 0.009; OR 0.62, 95% CI 0.44 to 0.88; power 0.70) and the <italic>26CAs </italic>allele (0.088 versus 0.030; <italic>P </italic>= 0.014; OR 2.96, 95% CI 1.27 to 6.91; power 0.80). Because <italic>CD154 </italic>is located on the X chromosome, we compared allele frequencies between patients and controls in males and females separately. We observed statistical differences in the <italic>24CAs </italic>allele frequency in females (0.44 in healthy controls versus 0.31 in patients; <italic>P </italic>= 0.006; OR 0.56, 95% CI 0.37 to 0.83; power 0.82) but not in males (0.41 versus 0.41).

These data suggested a possible disease-protective role for the <italic>24CAs </italic>variant in females.

The <italic>24CAs </italic>allele is less represented in patients than in controls, the difference being significant in women but not in men, and this gene variant protects from RA when homozygous. Different immunogenetic associations in male and female patients with RA have been described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>], although the mechanism underlying these differences is not fully understood. One possible explanation of these findings is that RA in males and females might be partly diverging disease entities, as proposed by Weyand and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>] or, alternatively, might result from the existence of differential hormonal influences. It is well known that RA is three times more frequent in women than in men, and many patients experience a clinical remission during pregnancy. However, it remains to be elucidated how hormonal differences might account for sex differences in <italic>CD154 </italic>association with disease susceptibility. In line with this, recent data have shown that CD154 expression could be modified by hormones such as estrogens [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>] and prolactin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>].</p><p>We also demonstrate that, although <italic>HLA-DR4 </italic>and <italic>HLA-DQ3 </italic>is associated with RA in the Canary Islands population, in agreement with previous studies in Spaniards [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>], <italic>CD154 </italic>association against RA is independent of HLA phenotype. These results differ from those previously obtained in Germans by Gomolka and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>], who described that the <italic>21CAs </italic>allele is a risk factor for patients with RA who are DR4<sup>-</sup>DR1<sup>-</sup>. Different allele frequencies between northern and southern Europe have been described for a variety of gene polymorphisms and probably contribute to the observed discrepancy, although there are other methodological reasons that also could explain the disparity of the results. Comparisons in the German population were not performed separately in men and women, and phenotype rather allele or genotype frequencies were used. Our data arranged in that way result in a similar overall distribution of phenotype frequencies to that reported by Gomolka and colleagues in both controls and patients with RA. Similarly, in our cohort 18% of DR4<sup>-</sup>DR1<sup>- </sup>patients with RA bear a <italic>21CAs </italic>allele, compared with only 0.5% of DR4<sup>- </sup>DR1<sup>- </sup>in controls. However, we excluded the analysis of minor alleles because the small number of individuals with those alleles did not permit reliable statistical comparisons to be made.</p><p>We wished to see whether the association that we had found between the <italic>CD154 </italic>microsatellite and predisposition to RA was sustained by the differential expression of the gene variant associated with RA. Regulation of mRNA stability is important in controlling the expression of this gene, and the microsatellite lies close to sites of binding of protein complexes that modulate mRNA stability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]; CA repeats have been shown to have a direct influence on mRNA stability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>], as well as on other events of gene expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">53</xref>]. We checked whether <italic>24CAs </italic>alleles displayed different behaviors in relation to mRNA decay rates and compared the <italic>24CAs </italic>mRNA with the other alleles. In agreement with previous studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">54</xref>], we confirmed that <italic>CD154 </italic>mRNA was more labile after 6 hours of stimulation with anti-CD3 than after 24 hours, but mRNAs with <italic>24CAs </italic>alleles had greater half-lives than the mRNAs from the other alleles after 6 and 24 hours of stimulation with anti-CD3.</p><p>Regarding protein expression, non-<italic>24CAs </italic>CD4 T cells expressed more CD154 after 48 hours of stimulation with anti-CD3/anti-CD28. Because staining for CD154 produced single-peaked histograms overlapping the negative control histograms, it is difficult to provide a precise description of CD154 distribution across CD4 T cells in terms of the percentage of positive cells and the mean MFI of the positive population. Staining of a Jurkat cell line with the same antibody resulted in two peaks, with a clear separation of CD154-positive and CD154-negative subpopulations. Dilution of the anti-CD154 antibody to mimic low CD154 expression changed the shape of the histogram to form a single peak overlaid with the control peak. In this situation, the percentages of positive cells calculated by subtracting positive and negative histograms did not reflect the true fraction of positive cells and changes according to the quantity of antibody added (data not shown). Thus, the dimly stained CD4 T cells from patients with RA in our '<italic>in vitro</italic>' assay seem to be reflecting a low density of CD154 on the surface, and the percentages of positive cells obtained probably do not reflect the true CD154-positive fraction of cells but still provide a rough measure of CD154 quantity in the CD4 T cell population.</p><p>Statistical analysis showed significant differences in the percentages of CD154<sup>+ </sup>cells but not in the MFIs. However, data on these two results look similar and both seem to provide an expression of the higher content of CD154 in non-<italic>24CAs </italic>CD4 T cells. Ultimately, what is relevant is that this differential CD154 expression may be meaningful '<italic>in vivo</italic>', affecting the response of the immune system to autoantigens, and hence the probability of developing autoimmunity. In this regard, it is interesting that a higher CD154 protein expression in people with the non-<italic>24CAs </italic>allele has been consistently found in a variety of situations with similar differences between people with <italic>24CAs </italic>and non-<italic>24CAs </italic>genotypes (median percentage of CD154<sup>+ </sup>cells, <italic>24CAs</italic>/median percentage of CD154<sup>+ </sup>cells, non-<italic>24CAs</italic>: 0.64 in freshly isolated PBMCs, 0.62 in anti-CD3/anti-CD28 stimulated PBMCs, and 0.55 in PBMCs after 1 week of expansion with PHA/anti-CD28), supporting the idea that CD154 microsatellite alleles influence the expression of this gene after TCR engagement. Nevertheless, it is important to note that this higher CD154 expression in non-<italic>24CAs </italic>refers to average values, and individual percentages and MFIs substantially overlap between <italic>24CAs </italic>and non-<italic>24CAs</italic>. We lack several replications of a single individual to estimate the variation inherent in the assay, but it is likely that a significant amount of the scattering in the data is produced by interindividual variations in several genes other than CD154 that also influence the expression of this gene after T cell activation.</p><p>Results in protein expression seem to contrast with results on mRNA stability. However, there are some concerns about the comparison of mRNA and protein results because different sources of cells were used for each experiment. Direct comparison of these results should be taken with caution, because different proportions of T cell subsets could have distinct kinetic patterns of CD154 expression. Furthermore, times of stimulation in the analysis of mRNA and protein expression match at only one time point (24 hours), so these experiments cannot be paralleled.</p><p>Taking the results together, the <italic>24CAs </italic>allele, although conferring more stability on its mRNA, finally seems to result in a lower CD154 protein expression after activation. This means that the microsatellite alleles are associated not only with mRNA half-life, which seems plausible because of its location in the 3' UTR, but with other factors that probably affect the transcription of the gene and that result in a lower percentage of T cells expressing this protein on the surface after stimulation of the TCR. Although very speculative, this could be related to the NF-&#x003ba;B enhancer located near the microsatellite, which has been shown to have a crucial effect on transcription of the gene [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. Changes in the affinity of this NF-&#x003ba;B site related to allelic variants of the microsatellite could lead to different thresholds for the activation of transcription, which in turn could lead to different percentages of cells expressing CD154 when stimulated.</p><p>These results therefore seem to agree with the known pattern of CD154 expression, because it has been shown that the greatest level of CD154 expression after T cell activation occurs at a time when the mRNA is being rapidly degraded and that expression is controlled by both transcriptional mechanisms and message stability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">54</xref>].</p><p>More studies will be necessary to confirm the association of this microsatellite marker with RA, to establish more accurately whether the association occurs through a direct effect in the expression of the <italic>CD154 </italic>gene and, if so, what are the exact mechanisms by which different alleles lead to a different expression of the gene.</p><p>The present results and our previous data showing CD154 association with systemic lupus erythematosus in Canary Islanders suggest that CD154 may commonly contribute to the pathophysiological process and common immunogenetic mechanisms underlying both autoimmune diseases, thus being in agreement with the hypothesis of the 'common genetic origin' of autoimmune diseases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B55">55</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B56">56</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>In the present study we report the association of the microsatellite in the 3' UTR of <italic>CD154 </italic>with RA in females from the Canary Islands. Differences found in mRNA decay according to <italic>CD154 </italic>genotypes suggest that this polymorphism may contribute to the regulation of mRNA expression, although further assays will be necessary to elucidate its role in disease predisposition. Additional studies from other series of patients will be required to confirm this genetic association.</p></sec><sec><title>Abbreviations</title><p>ActD = actinomycin D; APC = antigen-presenting cell; BrdU = bromodeoxyuridine; CI = confidence interval; FITC = fluorescein isothiocyanate; HLA = human leukocyte antigen; IL = interleukin; mAb = monoclonal antibody; MFI = mean fluorescence intensity; MHC = major histocompatibility complex; NF = nuclear factor; OR = odds ratio; PBMCs = peripheral blood mononuclear cells; PCR = polymerase chain reaction; PHA = phytohemagglutinin; RA = rheumatoid arthritis; SSO = sequence-specific oligonucleotides; TCR = T-cell antigen receptor; Th = T helper type; UTR = untranslated region.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>TM-D and IL-F designed the study, performed the experiments, analyzed and discussed the results and prepared the manuscript.
