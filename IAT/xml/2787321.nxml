Defects in innate immune response may contribute to the overproduction of TNF-&#x003b1; leading to systemic inflammation and diseases. Thus, the innate immune response needs to be tightly regulated by elaborate mechanisms to control its onset and termination. LPS tolerance is a state of hyporesponsiveness to subsequent LPS challenge and is achieved by monocytic cells after prolonged exposure to LPS. In this report, kinetics of endotoxin-responsive microRNAs expression analysis revealed a unique pattern of gradual increase for miR-146a starting 4 h after LPS stimulation in THP-1 cells and continued up to 35-fold over 24 h. Conversely, TNF-&#x003b1; increased up to 4 h and then decreased gradually implicating a negative correlation with miR-146a progression. The characteristic up-regulation of miR-146a toward subsequent LPS challenge in THP-1 cells was studied. Strikingly, microRNA expression analysis during the tolerized state of THP-1 cells showed only miR-146a overexpression suggesting its important role in LPS tolerance. In addition, LPS tolerance was dependent on a LPS-priming dose and associated miR-146a up-regulation. LPS-tolerized cells were observed to regain responsiveness in TNF-&#x003b1; production 22 h after LPS removal correlating with a decrease in miR-146a level. Transfection of miR-146a into THP-1 cells mimicked LPS priming, whereas transfection of miR-146a inhibitor largely abolished LPS tolerance. Thus our studies demonstrated that miR-146a is critical for the <italic>in vitro</italic> monocytic cell-based endotoxin tolerance.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group><funding-source id="CS100">National Institutes of Health</funding-source><award-id rid="CS100">AI47859</award-id><award-id rid="CS100">T32 AR007603</award-id><award-id rid="CS100">T32 DE007200</award-id><award-id rid="CS100">AI47859</award-id></award-group></funding-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Innate immunity plays an important role in providing primary defense against invading pathogenic microorganisms by identifying their conserved components known as pathogen-associated molecular patterns. During infection, pathogen-associated molecular patterns are recognized by the host through several conserved pattern recognition receptors presented on innate immune cells such as monocytes/macrophages and dendritic cells. Toll-like receptors (TLRs)<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN4"><sup>4</sup></xref> are the best characterized and evolutionary conserved pattern recognition receptors, and they play a central role in the initiation of innate immune response by binding to their respective ligands. All TLRs have conserved Toll and IL-1 receptor domain in the cytosolic region, which activates common signaling pathways, most notably through activation of NF-&#x003ba;B transcription factor.</p><p>Lipopolysaccharide (LPS or endotoxin) is the principal component of the outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria. LPS-induced TLR4 signal transduction activates NF-&#x003ba;B, leading to the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1&#x003b2; and TNF-&#x003b1; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>). Pathological dysregulation of NF-&#x003ba;B is linked to inflammatory diseases such as sepsis, autoimmune diseases, and possibly cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>). Neutrophils and monocytes from sepsis patient are refractory to subsequent LPS challenge and no longer produce these cytokines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>). This phenomenon, referred to as endotoxin tolerance, is also a mechanism to prevent overstimulation from the continuous exposure to same danger signals in the environment. Endotoxin tolerance has been established for decades <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>) and has also been extensively investigated <italic>in vitro</italic> using primary monocytes/macrophage cells and cell lines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6 B7">&#x02013;</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>). To understand the endotoxin tolerance mechanism, changes of cell surface molecules, signaling proteins, pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokines, and other mediators have been studied. Despite intense investigations for decades into the hyporesponsiveness associated with innate immune cells in response to LPS priming, there is no consensus yet on the primary mechanism responsible for its development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>).</p><p>MicroRNA (miRNA) is a new class of regulators of gene expression that acts at the post transcriptional level via an RNA interference mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>). In mammals, miRNA biogenesis involves the initial transcription by RNA polymerase II of primary miRNAs, which are sequentially cut by two RNase III enzymes, Drosha and Dicer, and create &#x0223c;23-nucleotide double-stranded RNA duplexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>). Eventually, the mature miRNA guide strand is loaded into the miRNA-induced silencing complex, where it guides the recognition and translational repression or degradation of target mRNAs. miRNAs have emerged to play important roles in many biological processes ranging from cellular development and differentiation to tumors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>). Recently, miRNAs have been shown to be involved in innate immunity. During the activation of an innate immune response, a rapid increase in the expression of selected miRNAs, namely miR-146a, miR-132, and miR-155 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>), miR-125a (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>), and miR-9 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>) have been observed in monocytic cell lines or mouse macrophages in response to LPS, but their biological activities are still obscure, and many studies are needed on their kinetics and subsequent putative role in innate immunity. Initial studies on miR-146a expression in response to microbial components and cytokines, including IL-1&#x003b2; indicate that it is involved in innate immunity against bacterial pathogens and is also implicated in inflammatory diseases. Interestingly, this response does not seem to be restricted to inflammatory cells, because miR-146a expression has been observed in lung epithelial cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>). Further analysis, to determine the biological role of miRNA-146a, reveals that its expression is NF-&#x003ba;B-dependent and regulates production of cytokines such as IL-1&#x003b2; and TNF-&#x003b1; in innate immunity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>). IL-1 receptor-associated kinase (IRAK-1) and TNF receptor-associated factor-6 (TRAF6), which are important in TLR4 and pro-inflammatory cytokine (IL-1) signaling, have been established as molecular targets for miR-146a (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>). More importantly, IRAK-1 and TRAF6 are known to be part of the common signaling pathway derived from TLR-2, -4, and -5 and the IL-1&#x003b2; receptor, leading to speculation that increased miR-146a expression might act in a negative feedback pathway. Previously, Li <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>) and Boone <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>) observed LPS tolerance in monocytes caused by impairment of IRAK-1 and TRAF6 kinase activity, respectively. Considering its ability to regulate TRAF6 and IRAK-1, we hypothesize that miR-146a to be involved in endotoxin tolerance. However, association between miR-146a overexpression and endotoxin tolerance has not been examined.</p><p>The aim of this study is to investigate the unique expression pattern of miR-146a compared with other LPS-responsive miRNAs and to observe its role in tolerance in innate immune cells to subsequent LPS exposure. Our findings suggest that miR-146a contributes to controlling TNF-&#x003b1; production and provides innate immunity to evade recurrent bacterial infection through establishing endotoxin tolerance.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES</title><sec><title/><sec><title/><sec><title>Cell Culture and LPS Stimulation</title><p>Human THP-1 cells, an undifferentiated promonocytic cell line, were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC, Manassas, VA).

Nomura <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>) described stimulation of monocytes with LPS leading to the down-regulation of TLR4-MD2 (myeloid differentiation protein-2) from the cell surface, essentially causing them to be unresponsive during a second LPS challenge. However, in a 2002 review article, Dobrovolskaia and Vogel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>) concluded that much higher doses of LPS were required for the TLR4 receptor down-regulation than for tolerance induction, and sustained overexpression of TLR4 did not prevent tolerance induction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>). In another study, LPS tolerance has been shown to be independent of LPS co-receptor CD14, because THP-1 cells showed tolerance in the presence or absence of anti-CD14 monoclonal antibody (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>).

LPS binds to the LPS-binding protein, which in turn is coupled to CD14 on the cell surface of monocytes. Subsequently, LPS-CD14 interacts with TLR4 and forms a complex with another accessory protein MD-2. The TLR4 signaling cascade is initiated after binding with adaptor protein MyD88 that acts as a bridge between TLR4 and incoming IRAK-1 adaptor kinase, which further recruits TRAF6. This chain of events triggers activation and translocation of NF-&#x003ba;B and results in the transcription of immune-responsive genes and cytokines such as TNF-&#x003b1; and mRNA regulators such as miR-146a. Consequently, low dose LPS-primed THP-1 cells produce TNF-&#x003b1; rapidly and continue to do so for 4&#x02013;6 h, and then TNF-&#x003b1; production decreases as soon as regulatory miR-146a starts to increase. Then, 18 h post-priming, a profound difference between miR-146a expression and TNF-&#x003b1; secretion is established, and because the up-regulated miR-146a acts negatively on IRAK-1 and TRAF6 mRNA the cells become tolerized (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7</xref><italic>A</italic>). Tolerized cells do not respond to high dose LPS challenge due to the high level of miR-146a unlike the untolerized control, which is responsive to LPS at this stage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7</xref><italic>B</italic>).</p><fig id="F7" position="float"><label>FIGURE 7.</label><caption><p><bold>A model of the role of miR-146a in LPS-TLR4-mediated signal transduction in tolerized (<italic>A</italic>) versus untolerized (<italic>B</italic>) cells.</bold> See text under &#x0201c;Discussion.&#x0201d; <italic>MD2</italic>, myeloid differentiation protein-2.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="zbc0021099090007"/></fig><p>Priming time is important to render monocytic cells to be tolerant.

Consistent with this time frame, even THP-1 cells stimulated with low dose LPS (10 ng/ml) showed high level of miR-146a expression. Furthermore, Jacainto <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>), and this report showed that LPS tolerance correlated with the increase in LPS-priming dose and complete tolerance (zero TNF-&#x003b1; production) was observed when 100 ng/ml or higher concentration of LPS was used; these high concentrations of LPS were linked with the high up-regulation of miR-146a confirming its substantial role in LPS tolerance.</p><p>The biological significance of other miRNAs induced by LPS such as miR-132 and miR-155 on LPS tolerance is not clear. They might have direct or indirect roles on LPS tolerance together with miR-146a. Thus, transfection studies were performed to examine the effects of overexpression of miR-146a alone on LPS tolerance. Transfection of miR-146a-mimic into THP-1 cells resulted in dramatic reduction of TNF-&#x003b1; indicating its negative regulatory effect on TNF-&#x003b1; production and subsequent LPS challenge. In the transfected cells, miR-146a level was pronounced, although TRAF6 and IRAK-1 mRNA were not completely abolished. Thus, miR-146a down-regulated IRAK-1 and TRAF6 mRNA at the post-transcriptional level completely consistent with a previous report (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>). Krutzfeldt <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>) introduced the usage of chemically modified miRNA inhibitor known as antagomirs to define the biological functions of miRNAs.

More importantly, the rapid induction of cytokines such as TNF-&#x003b1;, IL-1, and IL-6 is indispensable for mounting the innate response and subsequent robust adaptive immune response to defend against the first invading pathogens. Although cytokine production is important for the efficient control of growth and dissemination of invading pathogens, overproduction of these cytokines is harmful for the host, because it can be detrimental to the host physiological functions and may lead to multiple organ failure and death, a condition known as the septic shock syndrome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>). Thus, cells of the innate immune system must employ constantly a multilayered control mechanism to maintain innate immunity functional and inflammation in check.

In the present study, THP-1 showed a coordinated control mechanism in the early intense production of TNF-&#x003b1; at the initial stage of the LPS response, and then the level of TNF-&#x003b1; was gradually decrease; the magnitude and timing of this response is consistent with a published study on human mononuclear cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>). These new data demonstrating the role of miR-146a in controlling LPS tolerance confirm it as a key factor that keeps the innate immune system in balance toward cell survival.</p></sec><sec><title>Implication of Endotoxin Tolerance in Innate Immunity</title><p>Up-regulated miR-146a in TLR4-mediated endotoxin tolerance reported in this study is likely to affect other pattern recognition receptor activity in innate immunity. Taganov <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>) observed elevated miR-146a expression in response to TLR-2, -4, or -5 stimulation by bacterial and fungal components or following exposure to TNF-&#x003b1; or IL-1&#x003b2;. On the other hand miR-146a expression was not increased through activation of TLR-3, -7, or -9 in responses to viral or bacterial nucleic acids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>). Recently, Hou <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>) observed overexpression of miR-146a in response to vesicular stomatitis virus infection in a mouse infection model. In their study, miR-146a was shown to regulate type 1 interferon production by inhibiting RIG-I signaling molecules IRAK-1, IRAK-2, and TRAF-6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>). Interestingly, another report by Tang <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>) showed the down-regulation of miR-146a in a subset of human lupus patients with elevated expression of type 1 interferon. In any case, TNF-&#x003b1; can be produced through activation of all TLRs, except TLR3, and all these pathways involve the miR-146a target molecules TRAF6 and IRAK-1 adaptor kinases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>). Hedl <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>) showed chronic stimulation of Nod2 caused down-regulation of IRAK-1 activation and rendered intestinal macrophages tolerant to muramyl dipeptide. Muramyl dipeptide activates the NF-&#x003ba;B pathway via the same intermediates IRAK-1 and TRAF6, and thus LPS induction of miR-146a is likely to induce cross-tolerance to Nod2 pathway. Therefore, endotoxin tolerance associated with up-regulated miR-146a (NF-&#x003ba;B driven) may have a broader role involved in regulating TNF-&#x003b1;, a key player of the cytokine network, induced by a number of pattern recognition receptors indicated in innate immunity.</p><p>Innate immune response to the invading microorganism is influenced by miR-146a. In A549 epithelial cells, Perry <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>) reported the IL-1&#x003b2;-induced release of IL-8 and RANTES (regulated on activation normal T cell expressed and secreted) that were negatively regulated by the up-regulation of miR-146a. Similarly, in LPS-treated THP-1 cells, miR-146a shows unique up-regulation that has also been observed to be responsible to cause LPS tolerance to a wide range of LPS, including <italic>S. enterica</italic> in this study. Interestingly, Cavaillon <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>) found that LPS-tolerant mice were significantly resistant to <italic>S. enterica</italic> or <italic>Cryptococcus neoformans</italic> infection for &#x0003e;2 months. Thus, overexpression of miR-146a associated with endotoxin tolerance may have important consequences in host innate immunity responding to a wide range of bacterial infection. More extensive studies are needed to fully explore the complete role of this miRNA especially in terms of its half-life in LPS-tolerant mice. It is known that, in response to LPS challenge, endotoxin-tolerant monocytic cells show reduced production of IL-1&#x003b1;, IL-1&#x003b2;, and IL-6, along with TNF-&#x003b1; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>). Up-regulation of miR-146a in certain inflammatory conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis and sometimes in cancer cells has been observed, although its function under those circumstances is still unclear (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>).</p><p>In summary, multiple lines of evidence reported here provide the categorical role of miR-146a in endotoxin tolerance. This miRNA is highly up-regulated in tolerized cells and acts as a tuning mechanism to prevent an overstimulated inflammatory state. It is interesting to speculate that modulating the level of miR-146a can be used in therapeutic intervention for inflammation and protecting against sepsis.</p></sec></sec></sec></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="supported-by" id="FN1"><label>*</label><p>This work was supported in part by National Institutes of Health (NIH) Grant AI47859.
