Recent studies suggest that the latency-associated non-coding RNAs of EBV may actually induce type I (antiviral) interferon production, raising the question of how EBV counters the negative consequences this is likely to have on viral persistence. We addressed this by examining the type I interferon response in Burkitt lymphoma (BL) cell lines, the only <italic>in vitro</italic> model of the restricted program of EBV latency-gene expression in persistently infected B cells <italic>in vivo</italic>. Importantly, we observed no effect of EBV on interferon alpha-induced signaling or evidence of type I interferon production, suggesting that EBV in this latent state is silent to the cell's innate antiviral surveillance. We did uncover, however, a defect in the negative feedback control of interferon signaling in a subpopulation of BL lines as was revealed by prolonged interferon-stimulated gene transcription consistent with sustained tyrosine phosphorylation on STAT1 and STAT2. This was due to inadequate induction of expression of the ubiquitin-specific protease UBP43, which removes the ubiquitin-like ISG15 polypeptide conjugated to proteins (ISGylation) in response to type I interferons. Results here are consistent with previous findings in genetically engineered <italic>Ubp43<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> murine cells that UBP43 down-regulates interferon signaling, independent of its ISG15 isopeptidase activity, by precluding the protein kinase JAK1 from the interferon receptor. This natural deficiency in UBP43 expression may therefore provide a useful model to further probe the biological roles of UBP43 and ISGylation.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="10"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Burkitt lymphoma (BL) is a B-cell tumor that arises as a consequence of chromosomal translocations that juxtapose the c-<italic>MYC</italic> proto-oncogene to Ig-gene enhancers, resulting in constitutive over-expression of c-MYC <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006023-Boxer1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>. The endemic form of BL, furthermore, is highly associated (&#x0003e;90&#x00025;) with latent infection by Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), though the precise contribution(s) of EBV to lymphomagenesis in this context is unclear. Cell lines derived from EBV-positive BL tumors, unlike EBV-immortalized B lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs), are not dependent on EBV for continued cell growth and proliferation, and maintain a restricted program of viral latent-infection gene expression known as Latency I, in which the only known viral protein expressed is the genome-maintenance protein, EBNA-1. In addition, the EBV small non-coding RNAs EBER-1 and EBER-2 are expressed, as are a family of alternatively spliced and potentially non-coding transcripts (<italic>BARTs</italic>) that are the precursors for a subgroup of the EBV miRNAs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006023-Cai1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006023-Pfeffer1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>. By contrast, LCLs (and some BL cell lines) support expression of the full complement of EBV latency-associated genes, i.e., the Latency III or Growth program.</p><p>Whereas Latency III represents viral gene expression that ensues for a limited time following infection of na&#x000ef;ve B cells <italic>in vivo</italic>, virus-driven establishment of latent infection within memory B cells (the long-term reservoir of EBV) is believed to result in the complete cessation of EBV protein expression, i.e., the Latency program (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006023-ThorleyLawson1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>). However, upon periodic replication of latently infected memory cells (presumably to promote self renewal), reactivation of EBNA-1 expression occurs to prevent loss of the episomal EBV genome during cell division <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006023-Hochberg1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>. BL cell lines that maintain the Latency I program, therefore, offer an <italic>in vitro</italic> model of EBV latency that is representative of persistent EBV infection in its normal B cell host.</p><p>Herein, we employed this model of restricted EBV latency to address whether the virus may likely interfere with the type I interferon (IFN) response in normal B cells persistently infected with EBV. This work was initially prompted by a report that EBER expression in BL cells confers resistance to IFN-&#x003b1;-induced apoptosis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006023-Nanbo1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>, but that in our hands this was not mediated through inhibition of the dsRNA-activated protein kinase (PKR) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006023-Ruf1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>, as had been previously concluded <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006023-Nanbo1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>. More recently, work from others suggests that the EBER RNAs themselves induce the expression of type I IFNs through direct activation of RIG-I <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006023-Samanta1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>. We reasoned, therefore, that as a consequence of IFN induction by the EBERs, EBV may have evolved a mechanism to counter antiviral responses and other influences of IFN on cellular processes counterproductive to long-term EBV persistence.</p><p>During Latency III, the LMP-1 protein of EBV inhibits the activation (Tyr phosphorylation) of the JAK kinase Tyk2 during IFN-&#x003b1; signaling <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006023-Geiger1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>. We hypothesized, therefore, that a comparable inhibition of IFN-induced signaling may exist during Latency I (LMP-1 negative) to counter type I IFN production. However, contrary to our hypothesis, we report here that IFN-&#x003b1;-induced signaling, as measured by activating phosphorylation of STAT1 and STAT2 and the induction of IFN-stimulated gene (ISG) expression, is not affected by EBV in BL cells that maintain Latency I. We also did not observe evidence of IFN-&#x003b1;/&#x003b2; production by EBV-infected B cells. Instead, we uncovered an EBV-independent and previously unknown defect in the negative feedback regulation of IFN-&#x003b1; signaling. This was evidenced by sustained Tyr phosphorylation of STAT1 and STAT2 and DNA-binding by ISGF3 (the STAT1- and STAT2-containing complex responsible for induction of ISG transcription), resulting in prolonged ISG expression following IFN treatment. Further, we demonstrate that the basis for this is an inability to adequately express the ubiquitin-specific protease UBP43 (itself encoded by an ISG) that deconjugates the ISG15 protein moiety from ISGylated proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006023-Malakhov1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006023-Malakhova1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>, and which has previously been shown to inhibit type I IFN signaling by blocking STAT phosphorylation and consequently ISG induction through its direct displacement of the kinase JAK1 from the IFN-&#x003b1;/&#x003b2; receptor <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006023-Malakhova1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006023-Malakhova2">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>. Thus, our data supports UBP43 as a primary negative regulator of IFN-&#x003b1; signaling. Finally, the naturally arising dysregulation of UBP43 expression described here, which to our knowledge has not been previously observed, occurs within a subset of BL cell lines derived from independent tumors, suggesting that it is not a random or isolated defect, but presumably one that confers an advantage to some BLs.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Dysregulation of ISG Expression in BL</title><p>To investigate the potential impact of the restricted program of EBV latency-gene expression on the type I IFN response, we first examined whether EBV, and in particular the EBER RNAs, influences IFN-&#x003b1; induction of cellular gene expression.

Following addition of IFN-&#x003b1; (100 U/ml) to Akata-cell cultures, cell samples were removed at 3 to 72 h for extraction of total RNA, which was then analyzed by northern blot hybridization for the expression of <italic>ISG15</italic>, <italic>ISG56</italic> and <italic>ISG12</italic>. These ISGs were chosen based on an earlier microarray analysis that revealed constitutive (i.e., IFN-independent) expression of their mRNAs to be down-regulated in EBV-positive Akata cells relative to their EBV-negative counterparts (I.K.R. and J.T.S., unpublished observation). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006023-g001">Fig. 1A</xref> (left panel), in the EBV-negative cells, IFN-&#x003b1;-induced ISG expression was not only substantially higher, it was also sustained for an additional 24&#x02013;48 h, suggesting that EBV infection may suppress IFN-&#x003b1; signaling. To address this possibility, we repeated the analysis with the same EBV-negative cells (A.2) engineered to stably express the EBERs at physiologic levels, along with the EBV genome-maintenance protein, EBNA-1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006023-Ruf2">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>. However, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006023-g001">Fig. 1A</xref> (right panel), the presence of these EBV gene products did not affect the intensity or duration of ISG expression in an otherwise EBV-negative background, suggesting that the different responses of these BL lines to IFN-&#x003b1; are not attributable to EBV (see also below).

Although we cannot formally rule out the possibility that the observed differences in ISG induction among EBV-positive BL cells might be attributable to expression of viral genes not uniformly expressed in all EBV-positive BL cells, our finding that some EBV-negative BL cells also exhibit these differences in ISG induction supports the idea that this is indeed a virus-independent effect. This atypical response to IFN-&#x003b1; induction is associated with prolonged tyrosine phosphorylation on STAT1 and STAT2 and, consistent with the presence of these activated STAT proteins, extended DNA-binding activity of the ISGF3 complex, as well as higher and sustained expression of an ISRE-driven reporter gene. An exception to the generally sustained ISG expression in these BL cells was <italic>ISG43</italic>, which was minimally induced in all lines supporting prolonged ISG expression. This, and reports that the ubiquitin-specific protease UBP43 (alternatively USP18) encoded by <italic>ISG43</italic> can block type I IFN-induced phosphorylation of Tyr701 on STAT1 and that ISG expression is prolonged in <italic>ubp43<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> murine embryonic fibroblast cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006023-Malakhova1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>, led us to examine whether inadequate induction of UBP43 expression is the basis for our observations. Indeed, stable expression of UBP43 in our variant BL cells substantially reduced IFN-&#x003b1; activation of STAT1. Thus, we conclude that a defect in the IFN-inducible expression of UBP43 results in a significant delay of the negative feedback control of type I IFN signaling in these tumor cells, irrespective of their EBV status.</p><p>UBP43 removes the ubiquitin-like protein encoded by <italic>ISG15</italic> that is conjugated to proteins in a process known as ISGylation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006023-Malakhov1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006023-Loeb1">&#x0005b;25&#x0005d;</xref>.

The isopeptidase activity of UBP43 responsible for deconjugation of ISG15ylated proteins, however, is not required for the inhibition of STAT1 phosphorylation, which appears to be mediated instead through direct inhibition by UBP43 of the interaction of JAK1 with the type I IFN receptor <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006023-Malakhova2">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>. The defect in the UBP43-mediated negative feedback control of IFN signaling that we have uncovered is in the IFN-&#x003b1;-induced expression of UBP43, either in the transcriptional activation of the UBP43 gene by IFN-&#x003b1;, or in a co- or post-transcriptional event that results in a specific reduction in UBP43 mRNA production.

Alternatively, suboptimal expression of UBP43, and the resulting delay in the negative feedback regulation of IFN signaling, may promote a beneficial IFN-dependent function not necessarily related to the antiviral response. Of the several hundred known ISGs, clearly not all are involved in mediating resistance to infections <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006023-Der1">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref>.

Of these, only the second report is consistent with a potentially pro-oncogenic consequence of UBP43 deficiency. However, this specific example would appear to have little relevance to BL.</p><p>Our original intent for these studies was to determine whether the restricted latency program of EBV interferes with the type I IFN response, the impetus for which were findings from our group and others that the EBER RNAs of EBV inhibit IFN-&#x003b1;-induced apoptosis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006023-Nanbo1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006023-Ruf1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>, and reports from Takada and colleagues that the EBERs induce expression of IFN-&#x003b1;/&#x003b2; through direct activation of RIG-I <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006023-Samanta1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>. Specifically, the latter suggested to us that, given the potent antiviral properties of the type I IFNs, it is quite possible that EBV negatively targets the IFN-&#x003b1;-mediated signaling that would be initiated as a consequence of EBER induction of type I IFN expression. However, in contrast to the inhibition of type I IFN signaling by the LMP-1 protein of EBV during the growth or Latency III program <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006023-Geiger1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>, we found no evidence of such an effect in this cell model of restricted EBV latency. Interestingly, we also saw no indication of significant IFN-&#x003b1;/&#x003b2; production either from latently infected BL cells, or by EBV-negative BL cells that stably express the EBER RNAs (in addition to EBNA-1) at physiologic levels. Specifically, we did not detect tyrosine phosphorylation of either STAT1 or STAT2 in the absence of added IFN (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006023-g004">Figs. 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006023-g005">5</xref>), and consistent with this, little or no ISG mRNA expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006023-g001">Figs. 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006023-g002">2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006023-g006">6</xref>). Note that a low level of <italic>ISG15</italic> mRNA detected in the absence of IFN-&#x003b1; (as in KemI and SavI cells, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006023-g002">Fig. 2</xref>) is consistent with basal expression of <italic>ISG15</italic> and a subset of other ISGs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006023-Der1">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref>. Further, and consistent with the lack of detectable STAT1/2 phosphorylation in these BL cells, we have been consistently unable to directly detect IFN-&#x003b1; production (by ELISA) from our panel of BL cell lines, including EBV-negative Akata cells that stably express both EBERs (data not shown).</p><p>This apparent discrepancy with the earlier report may be due to the different experimental systems employed. Notably, the previous studies implicating EBER-induction of type I IFN production through direct activation of RIG-I relied on transfection (by electroporation) for the expression of EBERs and/or a GFP-tagged version of RIG-I (RIG-I/GFP) to show an effect <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006023-Samanta1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>. This may have resulted in a functional interaction between the otherwise nuclear EBERs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006023-Fok1">&#x0005b;38&#x0005d;</xref> and cytoplasmic RIG-I that normally would not occur during EBV latency. The activation of endogenous RIG-I (as evidenced by type I IFN expression) was not assessed in BL cells stably expressing the EBERs either naturally from the EBV genome, or by stable expression from an exogenously introduced vector in EBV-negative BL cells. Further, upon infection of EBV-negative BL cells, induction of IFN-&#x003b2; RNA expression could only be detected in cells stably overexpressing RIG-I/GFP <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006023-Samanta1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>. Thus, it would appear that induction of type I IFNs by the EBERs is not a normal function of these noncoding RNAs, at least within the context of BL cells.</p><p>In conclusion, we have uncovered a defect in the negative feedback control of type I IFN signaling by the ISG15-specific isopeptidase UBP43 within BL cells. This is unlikely to represent a common cellular adaptation to enhance an IFN-induced antiviral response to EBV or other infectious agents, as it does not occur uniformly among EBV-positive BL cell lines, and such an antiviral response would likely be inconsistent with the high incidence of EBV infection associated with endemic BL. Further, the observation that the underlying mechanism of prolonged IFN signaling is also evident in several cell lines derived from independent tumors suggests that this is not a random isolated event, but rather that dysregulation of UBP43 expression confers relatively frequently an advantage to some tumor cells, though what this advantage may be is currently unclear. However, because UBP43 is not constitutively expressed in BL cells, we presume that any such advantage may lie in the effect that IFN-induced ISG15ylation has on protein function. While earlier studies have relied on gene knock-out technology to elucidate the biochemical functions of UBP43 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006023-Malakhova2">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006023-Kim1">&#x0005b;26&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006023-Knobeloch1">&#x0005b;27&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006023-Rempel1">&#x0005b;35&#x0005d;</xref>, this is the first instance that we are aware of in which a natural deficiency in UBP43 expression was observed. BL lines that exhibit a defect in the type I IFN-induced expression of UBP43 may therefore provide a useful model to further probe the biological roles of UBP43 and ISGylation and their contributions to cell biology.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Cell Culture and Plasmids</title><p>Cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium containing 2 mM L-glutamine (Mediatech) and 10&#x00025; defined fetal bovine serum (HyClone).
