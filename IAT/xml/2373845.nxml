This may be attributable, at least partly, to the observation that severe malaria syndromes such as CM appear to be primarily mediated by host responses to infection rather than by the parasite directly.</p><p>Experimental infection of inbred and congenic mice with <italic>Plasmodium berghei</italic> ANKA (PbA) provides a well-established model to identify host genetic determinants that regulate both protective immunity and infection-associated immunopathology, including the development of CM. Similar to <italic>P. falciparum</italic> infection in humans, mice susceptible to PbA (e.g., C57BL/6 mice) develop symptoms of severe malaria and CM, including cytokine-associated encephalopathy, acidosis, coagulopathy, shock, and pulmonary edema, culminating in a fatal outcome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">5</xref>). Conversely, A/J mice, although equally susceptible to PbA infection, are more resistant to the associated CM syndrome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">7</xref>).</p><p>Excessive or dysregulated inflammatory responses to malaria, including high levels of TNF/lymphotoxin-&#x003b1; or inadequate production of regulatory (antiinflammatory) cytokines such as TGF-&#x003b2; and IL-10, are associated with the development of CM in both human infections and rodent models of disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">12</xref>). High levels of inflammatory cytokines are associated with endothelial cell activation and increased expression of adhesion molecules that contribute to the sequestration of parasitized erythrocytes and leukocytes in the cerebral vascular bed and the resultant CM syndrome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">15</xref>). Although it is well established that host response contributes to the development of CM, the underlying genetic determinants of susceptibility are poorly characterized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">10</xref>). A detailed understanding of the host genetic factors that contribute to susceptibility or resistance to CM may facilitate the identification of novel interventions to modulate host response and improve the outcome of CM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">15</xref>).</p><p>The complement system is an essential component of the innate immune response to several infectious agents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">16</xref>). The complement cascade can be activated by four different pathways, three of which converge at the level of the C3 component, leading to the cleavage of C3 and C5 to their activated forms, C3a and C5a, as well as the formation of the terminal membrane attack complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">18</xref>). A recently described pathway results in the generation of C5a in the absence of C3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">19</xref>).</p><p>A growing body of evidence has implicated excessive activation of the complement system, especially formation of the potent proinflammatory anaphylatoxin C5a in mediating deleterious host responses to bacterial infections and contributing to the development of sepsis, adverse outcomes, and death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">20</xref>). Blockade of C5a activity or C5aR with antibodies or C5aR antagonists in animal models of sepsis prevents multiorgan injury and improves survival (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">21</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">24</xref>). Generation of C5a is normally tightly regulated, and under controlled conditions, local production of C5a can enhance effector function of macrophages and neutrophils and contribute to an effective innate response to infection. However, detectable systemic C5a suggests a loss of regulation of complement activation. Elevated C5a levels are associated with several deleterious effects on host innate defense, including defective phagocyte and endothelial cell function, robust chemokine and cytokine secretion, and lymphoid apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">20</xref>).</p><p>Similar to sepsis, CM is believed to be the result, at least partly, of a dysregulated inflammatory response to infection. However, the roles of <italic>C5</italic> and C5a in the pathogenesis of CM have not been studied. We hypothesized that excessive generation of C5a in response to infection confers susceptibility to CM and investigated the role of C5a in the development of CM in vivo. Using a panel of inbred and congenic mice, we demonstrate a spectrum of differential susceptibility to CM that is associated with the presence or absence of <italic>C5</italic> and the generation of C5a, as well as the engagement of C5aR. These data provide direct evidence indicating that C5a plays a role in the pathogenesis of CM in the PbA model.</p><sec><title>RESULTS</title><sec><title>Differential susceptibility of inbred mice to PbA-induced experimental CM</title><p>Previous studies have established that inbred strains of mice such as C57BL/6 are susceptible to PbA infection and develop symptoms of experimental CM and rapidly succumb to infection. In contrast, other inbred mice, such as DBA/2 or A/J mice, are more resistant to CM and display enhanced survival during the acute phase of infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">25</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">27</xref>). To more completely define the phenotypic expression of differential susceptibility in this experimental model, we simultaneously challenged a panel of inbred mice under carefully controlled experimental conditions with a uniform inoculum of PbA and examined parasitemia, the development of experimental CM, and survival over a course of infection (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table I</xref> and <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 A</xref>). We observed differences in survival between A/J and C57BL/6 mice (A/J vs. C57BL/6: P &#x0003d; 0.002 and &#x003c7;<sup>2</sup> &#x0003d; 9.879 using a log-rank test for survival; <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 A</xref>). However, in this analysis a broader spectrum of susceptibility was observed than previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">25</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">27</xref>). This phenotypic expression ranged from highly susceptible to highly resistant to experimental CM (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table I</xref> and <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 A</xref>). Compared with CM-susceptible C57BL/6 mice, highly susceptible mice such as 129sv/J and 129P3/J mice had an earlier onset of neurological symptoms and succumbed significantly sooner to CM (as confirmed by histopathology; <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 C</xref>) during the course of infection (P &#x0003d; 0.001 and &#x003c7;<sup>2</sup> &#x0003d; 11.317 using a log-rank test). In contrast, AKR/J mice were highly resistant, with significantly improved survival compared with other strains (P &#x0003d; 0.00001 and &#x003c7;<sup>2</sup> &#x0003d; 13.568 using a log-rank test; <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 C</xref>). To examine whether parasite burden contributed to these different phenotypes, we examined the parasitemia in these inbred lines. No significant difference in parasitemia was observed between susceptible, resistant, and highly resistant mice throughout the course of infection (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 B</xref> and Fig. S1, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20072248/DC1">http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20072248/DC1</ext-link>).

C57BL/6, 129sv/J, and 129P3/J strains were shown to be susceptible to PbA-induced CM, and each of these strains is <italic>C5</italic> sufficient (wild-type sequence for <italic>C5</italic>). A/J, DBA/2J, and AKR/J mice are <italic>C5</italic> deficient (i.e., they possess a known frame-shift mutation in the <italic>C5</italic> gene and do not express functional C5) and were significantly more resistant to PbA-induced CM. A similar association of CM with <italic>C5</italic> sufficiency was established by determining the <italic>C5</italic> status of other inbred mouse strains reported in the literature as susceptible or resistant to PbA. In each case, inbred mice reported to be susceptible to CM were found to be <italic>C5</italic> sufficient. Conversely, all <italic>C5</italic>-deficient mice analyzed in this study and those reported in the literature were found to be resistant to CM. However there were two notable exceptions to this association. C3H/HeN mice are reported to be <italic>C5</italic> sufficient but resistant to CM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">28</xref>). We genotyped and phenotyped this strain together with appropriate controls and determined that it contained a wild-type sequence for <italic>C5</italic> and was sensitive to PbA-induced CM, with a survival course similar to CM-susceptible C57BL/6 mice (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table I</xref> and <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>).

Because several different lines of BALB/c mice are in current use and because C5 &#x0201c;sufficiency&#x0201d; in the literature often meant only that the <italic>C5</italic> gene did not contain the single A/J frame-shift mutation (as detected by PCR), we phenotyped the line in use in our laboratory and investigated this line for the presence of <italic>C5</italic> sufficiency by sequencing the entire <italic>C5</italic> gene to exclude any other point mutations, confirming gene transcription using RT-PCR, and by measuring C5a production over the course of PbA infection by ELISA. BALB/c mice were found to be resistant to the development of CM, with significantly higher survival than C57BL/6 mice (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 A</xref>). Sequence analysis showed that the <italic>C5</italic> gene from BALB/c mice contained no mutations in the open reading frame and therefore would have been predicted, by our hypothesis, to be susceptible to PbA-induced CM. To explain this apparent discrepancy, serum C5a levels in BALB/c and C57BL/6 mice over the course of an infection were analyzed. CM-susceptible C57BL/6 mice were shown to have significantly higher levels of C5a in the peripheral blood than BALB/c mice during infection, particularly at early time points (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 B</xref>). These observations were also supported by RT-PCR analysis demonstrating that BALB/c mice have levels of C5 that are significantly lower than susceptible C57BL/6 mice and are similar to C5-null A/J mice (BALB/c vs. C57BL/6 mean [SD] day 1 C5 mRNA copy number &#x0003d; 427.1 [471] vs. 4,132 [961], P &#x0003d; 0.002; BALB/c vs. A/J mean [SD] day 1 C5 mRNA copy number &#x0003d; 427.1 [471] vs. 691.6 [480], P &#x0003d; 0.498).

Collectively, these data provide direct evidence for a role for C5a in the development of CM in the PbA model and suggest a potential role for excessive complement activation in the pathogenesis of CM.</p><p>There are several putative mechanisms by which excessive complement activation might mediate or augment the pathophysiologic mechanisms underlying CM. During sepsis, activation of the complement system, particularly the generation of C5a, has been associated with several deleterious impacts on host defense, including defective phagocyte function and oxidative killing; potentiated macrophage chemokine and cytokine secretion in response to TLR ligands such as LPS, caspase activation, T cell apoptosis, and associated immunodeficiency; and enhanced secretion of proinflammatory mediators and tissue factor from endothelium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">21</xref>). Excessive generation of C5a during severe malaria infections may contribute to similar defects in host response. C5a has been shown to up-regulate several endothelial cell adhesion molecules relevant to parasite sequestration and malaria pathogenesis, including intercellular cellular adhesion molecule 1, vascular cellular adhesion molecule 1, and P- and E-selectins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">34</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">36</xref>). Increased expression of adhesion molecules, particularly in the cerebral microvasculature, would be expected to enhance leukocyte and parasitized erythrocyte adherence to endothelium, contributing to the release of toxic mediators, disruption of microcirculatory flow and regional metabolism, and endothelial cell activation and injury that characterize CM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">37</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">39</xref>). Similar to sepsis, dysregulated inflammatory responses to microbial products have also been implicated as key factors in the pathogenesis of human CM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">33</xref>). Parasite products such as <italic>Pf</italic>GPI have been shown to induce inflammatory mediators in a TLR2-dependant manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">31</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">33</xref>). In this study, we show that C5a enhances <italic>Pf</italic>GPI-induced inflammatory responses (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>), as it does for LPS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">40</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">42</xref>), and may contribute to the marked inflammatory response and endothelial cell activation that are central to the pathophysiology of CM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">43</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">44</xref>). In addition, C5aRs are constitutively expressed by CNS neurons, suggesting that they may be at risk in settings of CM-associated inflammation and complement activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">45</xref>).</p><p>Several studies have reported that parasite burden does not appear to play a pivotal role in the development of CM in the PbA model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">32</xref>). Consistent with these data, we observed no significant difference in parasitemia between CM-susceptible and -resistant mice, suggesting that C5/C5a does not significantly affect parasite burden (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">32</xref>). However, we observed that highly susceptible 129sv/J mice had significantly higher parasite densities than either susceptible or resistant mice (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 B</xref> and Fig. S1). The inability of this strain to control initial parasitemia may predispose 129sv/J mice to more severe disease and the rapid development of CM. As suggested by Amante et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">46</xref>), these findings indicate that parasite burden may also contribute to the pathogenesis of experimental CM. Collectively, these observations indicate that CM is a complex and polygenic process, and that in highly susceptible and highly resistant strains other genetic factors, in addition to <italic>C5</italic>, contribute to the phenotypes observed. Although the precise genetic determinants regulating the control of acute blood-stage parasite replication in <italic>P. berghei</italic> are unknown, studies have identified several loci, including <italic>Char1</italic>, <italic>Char2</italic>, <italic>Char3</italic>, and <italic>Char9</italic>, in the control of peak parasitemia in <italic>P. chabaudi</italic>&#x02013;infected mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">47</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">50</xref>); more recently, <italic>Berr1</italic>, <italic>Berr3</italic>, <italic>Berr4</italic>, and <italic>cmsc</italic> loci on chromosomes 1, 9, 4, and 17 (in the H-2 region), respectively, have been associated with the genetic control of host response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">51</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">52</xref>).</p><p>Current evidence indicates that a tightly regulated proinflammatory response is critical in the control and resolution of malaria infection, whereas excessive and sustained inflammatory responses contribute to immunopathology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">10</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">53</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">55</xref>). Similar to inflammatory responses to infection, our findings indicate that both the timing and the peak concentrations of C5a are important in determining outcome. We show that early induction of C5 activation during the course of infection contributes to potentiated inflammatory responses and predisposes mice to the development of CM (e.g., C57BL/6 mice). Conversely, BALB/c mice do not display early activation of C5 but rather a gradual activation that may facilitate the regulated responses necessary for the control of acute PbA infection while limiting host immunopathology.</p><p>High levels of circulating C5a in the susceptible mice are consistent with studies of severe malaria and experimental malaria challenge models in humans, which reported activation of the complement system by both the classical and alternative pathways during human infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">56</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">58</xref>). The observation that C5a appears very early in the course of experimental CM supports its role as a potential early mediator and also suggests that it may be a useful biomarker to predict those who will go on to develop CM. Because only a small proportion of malaria-infected individuals progress to severe disease, a predictive biomarker would be of clinical utility in identifying and more effectively allocating therapeutic resources to those at greater risk of adverse outcomes. To be valuable as a biomarker would require that C5a levels have a predictive value in patients who are at risk of CM but have not yet developed the syndrome. To define the role of C5a as a putative mediator of human CM and determine whether elevated C5a levels will be a useful biomarker will require additional study in prospective clinical trials.</p><p>Interventions that prevent CM would be of potential clinical benefit in the management of human <italic>P. falciparum</italic> infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">2</xref>). In this study, C5a&#x02013;C5aR blockade results in significant protection against CM in infected susceptible mice (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref>). Although the precise trigger of complement activation during malaria infection requires further investigation, the observations that C5a is required for the development of experimental CM and that blockade of C5a&#x02013;C5aR activity early in the course of PbA infection improves outcome identify C5a&#x02013;C5aR as a potential target for intervention in human severe malaria and CM. Additional studies are required to investigate the potential role of C5a in human infection, including CM induced by <italic>P. falciparum</italic> malaria. If C5a is subsequently shown to be an important mediator in CM in humans, then the availability of inhibitors of C5a&#x02013;C5aR, including receptor antagonists and an FDA-approved humanized monoclonal antibody against C5, might permit direct testing of the hypothesis that C5a&#x02013;C5aR blockade will improve clinical outcome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">59</xref>). In summary, these data provide direct evidence for a role for C5a in the development of CM in the PbA model, and suggest a potential role for excessive complement activation and C5a generation in particular, in the pathophysiology of human CM.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Mice, parasites, and experimental infections.</title><p>Experiments involving animals were reviewed and approved by the University of Toronto Animal Use Committee and were performed in compliance with current University of Toronto animal use guidelines.

C57BL/6 and BALB/c mice were purchased from Charles River Laboratories. 129sv/J, C3H/HeN, 129P3/J, DBA/2J, A/J, AKR/J, B10.D2/oSnJ, and B10.D2/nSnJ mice were purchased from the Jackson Laboratory.</p><p>PbA parasites were maintained by passage through naive C57BL/6 mice, as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">32</xref>). Experimental infections were initiated by i.p. injection of 5 &#x000d7; 10<sup>5</sup> PbA-parasitized erythrocytes. The course of infection was monitored twice daily for neurological symptoms including mono-, hemi-, para-, or tetraplegia, movement disorder, ataxia, hunching, convulsions, and coma, to define CM as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">26</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">46</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">60</xref>). Mice were judged to have CM if they displayed these neurological criteria within days 6&#x02013;10 after infection and either succumbed to infection or were humanely killed as per the requirements of our institutional animal use committee. Parasitemias were monitored using thin blood smears stained with modified Giemsa stain (Protocol Hema 3 stain set; Sigma-Aldrich) from 3 d after infection onwards. CM was confirmed by histological examination of cerebral pathology. Brain tissue was carefully removed, fixed in 10% neutral-buffered formalin, embedded, sectioned (5 &#x003bc;M), and stained with Giemsa or hematoxylin and eosin.</p></sec><sec><title><italic>C5</italic> deficiency and sequencing of the <italic>C5</italic> gene in BALB/c mice.</title><p>All <italic>C5</italic>-deficient mice used in this study had a bp deletion at positions 62 and 63 of the <italic>C5</italic> gene, which was fixed in several strains during their generation.

Targets were PCR amplified with Taq Platinum HiFi (Invitrogen) using 50 ng DNA per reaction in a GeneAmp PCR System 9700 (Applied Biosystems). Fragments were visualized on an agarose gel. The PCR conditions were an initial denaturation at 94&#x000b0;C for 5 min, followed by 25 cycles of denaturing at 94&#x000b0;C for 30 s, annealing at 53&#x02013;59&#x000b0;C for 30 s, and extension at 68&#x000b0;C for 60 s. 5 &#x003bc;l of PCR product was treated with the ExoSap-IT kit containing exonuclease I and shrimp alkaline phosphotase, according to the manufacturer's instructions (GE Healthcare), to remove primers and unbound nucleotides.
