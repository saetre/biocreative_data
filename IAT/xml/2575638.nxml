Although CIA shares several features with RA, there are some obvious differences between the mouse model and the human disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. One such dissimilarity is the reversed sex susceptibility. A female predominance is characteristic for RA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>], whereas the opposite situation commonly is the case in mice developing CIA. Because of the male predominance of CIA in most strains of mice, including B10.Q, most published CIA experiments have been performed on males.</p><p>We have previously performed a genetic linkage analysis on multiparous female mice from an N2 cross between NFR/N and B10.Q, with the aim of finding CIA loci that are linked to disease development in females [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. We identified one novel significant CIA-associated locus on chromosome 11, which is now denoted <italic>Cia40</italic>. No other CIA loci/genes have previously been found in this region, but the central part of chromosome 11 is known to contain a number of inflammation loci, such as <italic>Eae22</italic>, <italic>Eae6b</italic>, <italic>Eae23</italic>, and <italic>Eae7 </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. However, none of the experimental autoimmune encephalitis (EAE) loci is located close to the <italic>Cia40 </italic>linkage peak, indicating that other polymorphic genes might be of importance.</p><p>Interestingly, in an additional quantitative trait locus (QTL) analysis with females of the same cross (N2 generation of NFR/N and B10.Q), we detected a highly significant QTL close to <italic>Cia40 </italic>on chromosome 11 linked to the trait 'pregnancy frequency' [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. This locus is denoted <italic>Pregq2 </italic>and controls the frequency of successful pregnancies following successful copulation (successful coitus recorded by the detection of the 'vaginal plug'). In the initial QTL analysis, heterozygous mice carrying NFR/N genes at the <italic>Pregq2 </italic>locus suffered from an increased frequency of pregnancy failures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. We hypothesized that the <italic>Cia40/Pregq2 </italic>region of chromosome 11 may contain polymorphic genes that influence both CIA incidence and breeding success.</p><p>Although our original QTL analysis was performed on (aged) female mice with the hope of finding CIA loci with female predominance, there would still be a possibility that the <italic>Cia40 </italic>locus is of equal importance in both sexes. In the present paper, we present results indicating that <italic>Cia40 </italic>congenic females are more affected by CIA than males are. We also show that the <italic>Cia40/Pregq2 </italic>locus is linked to a disturbed reproductive behavior and reduced breeding performance in females.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Mice</title><p>Inbred NFR/N mice were originally obtained from the National Institutes of Health (Bethesda, MD, USA) and the B10.Q mice were originally from the animal colony of Professor Jan Klein (T&#x000fc;bingen University, T&#x000fc;bingen Germany). (B10.Q &#x000d7; NFR/N) &#x000d7; B10.Q N<sub>10 </sub>mice were bred in the animal house of the Department of Pathology of Lund University, Sweden. The animals were fed standard rodent chow and water in a photoperiod of light/dark 12:12. All mice used in the present study had clean health monitoring protocols according to the recommendations of the Federation of European Laboratory Animal Sciences Association. The ethical permission for reproduction and arthritis (M236-06,) was provided by the Swedish Board of Agriculture.</p></sec><sec><title>The <italic>Cia40 </italic>congenic mice and the fragment</title><p>To confirm the previously identified linkage on chromosome 11, we backcrossed the NFR/N strain to the (more) CIA-resistant strain, B10.Q. Mice heterozygous for the congenic region (a small fragment from the NFR/N strain on B10.Q background) were chosen for additional backcrossing for 10 generations (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). All of the mice were derived from the same set of parents. Subsequently, the congenic mice were intercrossed. Mice heterozygous for NFR/N markers between D11Mit70 (93.8 Mb) and D11mit214 (114.8 Mb) were intercrossed two times in order to produce the congenic line <italic>Cia40</italic>. All of the mice that were homozygote for <italic>Cia40 </italic>in the study had equal fragment size (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). However, the heterozygote animals differed slightly in fragment length among the individuals (1 to 2 Mb).</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Overview of the <italic>Cia40/Pregq2 </italic>congenic fragment</bold>.

Nine fluorescence-labeled polymorphic microsatellite markers (Interactiva, Biotechnologie GmbH, Ulm, Germany) were used to cover the heterozygous fragment derived from the NFR/N as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>] (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). The polymerase chain reaction products were analyzed on a MegaBACE&#x02122; 1000 (GE Healthcare UK Ltd, Amersham Place, Little Chalfont, Buckinghamshire HP7 9NA, UK) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Data were analyzed with Genetic Profiler 1.1. (GE Healthcare UK Ltd, Amersham Place, Little Chalfont, Buckinghamshire HP7 9NA, UK).</p></sec><sec><title>Induction and evaluation of collagen-induced arthritis</title><p>To induce CIA, 8- to 12-week-old mice were immunized subcutaneously at the base of the tail with 100 &#x003bc;g rat collagen type II (CII) emulsified in 0.1 M acetic acid in complete Freund's adjuvant (Difco Laboratories, now part of Becton Dickinson and Company, Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA). After 30 days, a booster injection containing 50 &#x003bc;g CII emulsified in 0.1 M acetum in incomplete Freund's adjuvant (Becton Dickinson and Company) was given. The clinical scoring of arthritis was commenced 25 days after the first immunization. The scoring system is based on the number of inflamed joints, ranging from 1 to 15 for each affected paw. Each affected ankle/wrist was given a score of 5, and each inflamed knuckle and toe was given 1 point. The scores of the four paws were added, yielding a maximum total score of 60 points for each mouse. The severity trait is the maximum score observed in each individual female. Mice that did not develop CIA were given a score of 0 for the traits of severity, onset, and incidence. The onset is the number of days calculated from the first immunization to the first clinical signs of arthritis excluding unaffected animals.</p></sec><sec><title>Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay</title><p>The mice were sacrificed at day 90 and sera were collected. Anti-CII antibody titers in sera were analyzed by a sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay technique [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. In short, immunosorbent plates were coated with CII (10 &#x003bc;g/mL) overnight at 4&#x000b0;C. Bovine serum albumin (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) was used for blocking, and thereafter different dilutions of control sera (purified mouse anti-collagen type II antibodies), test sera, and positive and negative controls were added. The presence of CII-specific IgG was visualized by peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG.</p></sec><sec><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Statistical comparison between the different experimental groups was performed by using the Mann-Whitney <italic>U </italic>test.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Increased incidence, onset, and severity of collagen-induced arthritis in heterozygous <italic>Cia40 </italic>congenic female mice</title><p>Heterozygous and homozygous <italic>Cia40 </italic>congenic mice and corresponding littermate controls of both sexes were immunized with rat CII and monitored three times a week for 90 days. Serum samples for anti-CII antibody analysis were collected at the end point of the experiment. Results presented in Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref> show that heterozygous <italic>Cia40 </italic>congenic mice suffer from an elevated incidence of the disease. This increase in incidence was particularly obvious and significant in the group of females (<italic>P </italic>&#x0003c; 0.05). Surprisingly, no significant differences in incidence were observed in homozygous <italic>Cia40 </italic>congenic females or males in comparison with the corresponding controls. The onset of the disease was significantly quicker in heterozygous females in comparison with wildtype B10.Q and homozygous congenic littermates. There were no significant differences in onset between the different groups of males.

Homozygous mice showed a minor increase in severity in comparison with wildtype B10.Q littermates, but this difference was not significant. The heterozygous congenic males showed a higher severity in the beginning of the disease, whereas heterozygous females showed higher severity in the latter part of the disease. The heterozygous congenic females developed a more severe arthritis than the heterozygous congenic male mice.

Interestingly, the increased incidence and severity are pronounced traits in heterozygous mice only, and the influence of the congenic fragment is particularly obvious in the heterozygous females, which actually show a much higher incidence than the males. This is striking since females of the strain B10.Q normally show a very low incidence of arthritis (around 15%). The female predominance in incidence of CIA makes polymorphic genes in the congenic fragment particularly interesting since female predominance is characteristic for RA in humans.</p><p>None of the genes close to the calculated position of the <italic>Cia40/Pregq2 </italic>locus is known to be involved in the regulation of inflammation (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>). For this reason, we believe that polymorphic or mutated regulatory genes, which in turn affect the activity of several enzymes, could be particularly interesting candidate genes. One such candidate gene is mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase, <italic>Map2k6</italic>, which has been reported to affect the function of the immune system. For instance, Ehlting and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>] recently reported that the regulation of a suppressor of cytokine signalling 3' (SOCS3) mRNA stability by tumor necrosis factor-alpha involves the activation of the MAP kinase cascade. Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T4">4</xref> shows possible gene candidates, based on single-nucleotide polymorphism data in this particular fragment on chromosome 11 in between inbreed strains of NMRI and C57BL/10 mice from the Wellcome Trust database (gscan) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>].</p><table-wrap position="float" id="T4"><label>Table 4</label><caption><p>Summary of possible candidate genes on chromosome 11 for <italic>Cia40/Pregq2</italic></p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><td align="left">Gene</td><td align="left">Position, mb</td><td align="left">Description</td><td align="left">Reproductive or inflammatory phenotypes of mutation</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left"><italic>Ngfr</italic></td><td align="left">95.430132 &#x02013; 95.449049</td><td align="left">Nerve growth factor receptor</td><td align="left">Perinatal lethality</td></tr><tr><td align="left"><italic>Phb</italic></td><td align="left">95.5528271 &#x02013; 95.542087</td><td align="left">Prohibitin</td><td align="left">Lethality before weaning</td></tr><tr><td align="left"><italic>Igf2bp1</italic></td><td align="left">95.818477 &#x02013; 95.867254</td><td align="left">Insulin-like growth factor 2</td><td align="left">Fetal growth</td></tr><tr><td align="left"><italic>Med24</italic></td><td align="left">96.565905 &#x02013; 98.590749</td><td align="left">Mediator complex subunit 24</td><td align="left">Pups die prior to birth</td></tr><tr><td align="left"><italic>Gsdm3</italic></td><td align="left">98.490658 &#x02013; 98.499540</td><td align="left">Gasdermin</td><td align="left">Abnormal loss of skin and hair</td></tr><tr><td align="left"><italic>Etv4</italic></td><td align="left">101.631061 &#x02013; 101.646685</td><td align="left">Ets variant gene 4 (E1A enhancer-binding protein, E1AF)</td><td align="left">Mammary gland abnormality, male infertility</td></tr><tr><td align="left"><italic>Cd79b</italic><sup>a</sup></td><td align="left">106.172655 &#x02013; 106.176076</td><td align="left">CD79B antigen</td><td align="left">Hematopoietic, immune</td></tr><tr><td align="left"><italic>Prkar1a</italic></td><td align="left">109.510719 &#x02013; 109.530970</td><td align="left">Protein kinase, cAMP-dependent regulatory, type I, alpha</td><td align="left">Embryonic lethality</td></tr><tr><td align="left"><italic>Abca8a</italic><sup>a</sup></td><td align="left">109.886948 &#x02013; 109.957292</td><td align="left">ATP-binding cassette, sub-family A (ABC1), member 8a</td><td align="left">Not known</td></tr><tr><td align="left"><italic>Map2k6</italic><sup>a</sup></td><td align="left">110.260436 &#x02013; 110.386836</td><td align="left">Mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase 6</td><td align="left">Abnormal immune system</td></tr><tr><td align="left"><italic>Sox9</italic></td><td align="left">112.643538 &#x02013; 112.649074</td><td align="left">SRY-box containing gene 9</td><td align="left">Perinatal lethality, cartilage formation, sex reversal</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><p><sup>a</sup>Polymorfism between inbreed strains of NMRI and C57BL/10 according to gscan, Wellcome Trust Centre for Human Genetics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Mb for the genes/markers are according to Mouse Ensemble built 36 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>].</p></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap><p>We have previously speculated that the same gene(s) might affect both arthritis incidence and pregnancy failure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. This assumption is supported by the fact that the incidence of autoimmune CIA is elevated in females but not in males and that the elevated severity is particularly obvious in females. A modified gene that increases the risk of developing autoimmune inflammation in females can also be expected to interfere negatively with pregnancy success. Some types of early pregnancy failures could actually be caused by increased autoimmune reactivity. Again, it is possible that the MAP kinase is involved in the success of implantation. This assumption is strengthened by a recent observation that the MAP kinase cascade indeed affects preimplanted embryos [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. Still, it might be more likely that different mechanisms and genes are involved in the regulation of arthritic inflammation and the regulation of pregnancy success. If true, this would make it possible to separate <italic>Cia40 </italic>gene(s) from the breeding-suppressing <italic>Pregq2 </italic>gene(s), which would be of great advantage for the future characterization of the part of the <italic>Cia40 </italic>gene(s) that influence the outcome of arthritis.</p><p>The observation that the heterozygous <italic>Cia40 </italic>congenic mice show a quicker onset, and in the case of males, also develop a more severe disease, raises questions about the molecular mechanisms controlling arthritis. A polymorphism leading to an amino acid substitution in one allele could have strong effects on the function of a di- or multimeric protein and polymorphisms in noncoding regulatory regions could result in skewed transcription and altered protein levels. The observed phenotypic effects due to heterozygous alleles might be helpful in the identification of candidate genes. The heterozygous effect has previously been reported in a study of CIA development, in which mice with heterozygous alleles in a congenic fragment on mouse chromosome 15 were much more affected by the disease than homozygous littermates were [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>].</p><p>We have found only a limited number of genes in the vicinity of the <italic>Cia40 </italic>and <italic>Pregq2 </italic>peaks, which show polymorphism between B10 and NMRI. In addition to <italic>Mapk6</italic>, we have focused some attention on the <italic>Abca8a </italic>gene and <italic>CD79b </italic>gene. The role of the <italic>Abca8a </italic>gene in the context of reproduction and immunity is largely unknown, whereas the <italic>CD79b </italic>gene is of importance primarily in the context of B-cell development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. At present, it is not possible to speculate about the possible influence of these two genes for the phenotypes observed, but the function of these genes does not make them our main candidate genes.</p><p>The interesting reversal of sex susceptibility to arthritis and the observations that congenic males show impaired development of genital organs and that females are more aggressive and less caring mothers have made us pay attention to the <italic>Sox9 </italic>gene. The <italic>Sox9 </italic>gene has been reported to cause sex reversal [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>], which is a highly relevant phenotype in the context of the <italic>Cia40/Pregq2 </italic>congenic mice. The possible presence of a <italic>Sox9 </italic>polymorphism/mutation on chromosome 11 in our congenic mice is under investigation.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>The present results show that the <italic>Cia40 </italic>locus on chromosome 11 contains one or more polymorphic genes that particularly influence incidence and severity of CIA in female mice. These effects are significant in congenic B10.Q female mice carrying heterozygous <italic>Cia40 </italic>fragments of NFR/N origin. Congenic mice carrying heterozygous fragments also show quicker onset of the disease. The major polymorphic candidate genes in the congenic fragment are <italic>Cd79b</italic>, <italic>Abca8a</italic>, and <italic>Map2k6</italic>. The NFR/N fragment present in the congenic mice also contains a locus denoted <italic>Pregq2</italic>, which causes a change in reproductive behavior and reduces pregnancy success. This effect is significant in congenic B10.Q females carrying a homozygous NFR/N fragment. The <italic>Sox9 </italic>gene, known to influence sex reversal, is a candidate gene for the reproductive phenotype.</p></sec><sec><title>Abbreviations</title><p>CIA = collagen-induced arthritis; CII = collagen type II; EAE = experimental autoimmune encephalitis; MAP = mitogen-activated protein; QTL = quantitative trait locus; RA = rheumatoid arthritis.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>ML was responsible for genotyping, phenotyping, and analysis and helped to interpret the data and write the manuscript.
