Currently, LAP is presumed to function only as a sequestering agent for active TGF-&#x003b2;1. Previous work shows that LAP can induce epithelial cell migration, but effects on leukocytes have not been reported. Because of the multiplicity of immunologic processes in which TGF-&#x003b2;1 plays a role, we hypothesized that LAP could function independently to modulate immune responses. In separate experiments we found that LAP promoted chemotaxis of human monocytes and blocked inflammation <italic>in vivo</italic> in a murine model of the delayed-type hypersensitivity response (DTHR). These effects did not involve TGF-&#x003b2;1 activity. Further studies revealed that disruption of specific LAP-thrombospondin-1 (TSP-1) interactions prevented LAP-induced responses. The effect of LAP on DTH inhibition depended on IL-10. These data support a novel role for LAP in regulating monocyte trafficking and immune modulation.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="9"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Transforming Growth Factor-Beta 1 (TGF-&#x003b2;1, NM_011577) has diverse effects in multiple cell types.

LAP promoted the chemotaxis of human monocytes through a TSP-1 and CD36-mediated pathway; whereas, LAP suppression of DTH was more dependent on TSP-1 and IL-10. These observations recapitulate some of the biological properties ascribed to the TGF-&#x003b2;1 molecule itself suggesting a potentially novel role for LAP in regulating cellular inflammation. In fact, as suggested by our chemotaxis data, TGF-&#x003b2;1 inhibited monocyte chemotaxis induced by LAP, suggesting a potential role for TGF-&#x003b2;1 in suppressing LAP-mediated cellular activation.</p><p><italic>In vitro,</italic> LAP required TSP-1 and CD36 to recruit monocytes, while other ligands that interact with TSP-1, like RGD peptides and CD47, did not appear to mediate these responses. <italic>In vivo</italic> LAP utilized an IL-10-dependent pathway to mediate suppression of the cellular immune response.

We are focusing on defining the cell of origin and the mechanism by which LAP involves IL-10 in this <italic>in vivo</italic> model. It is possible these effects could be mediated through local dendritic cells, as dendritic cell exposure to LAP has been shown to influence T-cell production of IL-10.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001914-Gandhi1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref></p><p>The concept of an independent role for LAP in immune homeostasis has precedent. Investigators have proposed that the large latent complex of TGF-&#x003b2;1 (TGF-&#x003b2;1&#x0002b;LAP&#x0002b;LTBP1) is not just a passive sink for active TGF&#x003b2;1, but rather an active sensor of the matricellular environment.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001914-Annes1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref> While cellular recruitment regulated by LAP may not be a direct part of this regulatory paradigm, our data supports this view. In fact, the early and late effects of TGF-&#x003b2;1 in some model systems could be interpreted as the sum of the actions of TGF-&#x003b2;1 <italic>plus</italic> the independent effects of LAP.</p><p>Several studies indicate that LAP may also be important in pathophysiologic processes. Experiments in a murine model of human scleroderma and GVHD indirectly support LAP as an independent regulator of immune cell function. In these studies, bone-marrow transplantation was performed in mice to induce TGF-&#x003b2;1-mediated skin fibrosis and inflammation.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001914-Zhang1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref> The investigators asked if systemic therapy with recombinant LAP abrogated the development of skin fibrosis in this animal model. While the data showed an expected reduction in TGF-&#x003b2;1 signaling and fibrosis, there was persistent monocytic inflammation in the skin. Since monocyte recruitment can be a function of TGF-&#x003b2;1 or LAP, these data suggest that LAP could have had independent biological activity in this model. Other organ effects were not reported in these studies. The authors concluded that LAP inhibits the portion of known TGF-&#x003b2;1 signals that result in fibrosis, but that TGF-&#x003b2;1 likely signaled through other pathways to mediate inflammation. However, independent effects of LAP were not considered.</p><p>Recently, a genetic abnormality affecting the function of LAP was described as the underlying cause of a naturally occurring human disease called Camurati-Engelmann's disease (CED). CED is a disorder associated with abnormal bone growth and multiple other systemic abnormalities.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001914-Janssens1">&#x0005b;30&#x0005d;</xref> Two groups recently reported that this disorder was associated with several missense mutations in the LAP region of the TGF-&#x003b2;1 gene that affects its ability to bind to TGF-&#x003b2;1 and confer latency.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001914-Janssens2">&#x0005b;31&#x0005d;</xref> It is possible that some of the phenotypic abnormalities in CED patients may be related to changes in LAP and resultant downstream signaling events.</p><p>Our data indicate that the type I repeat region (TSR) of TSP-1 is important to the biological effects of LAP.

This is not surprising as TSP-1, TGF-&#x003b2;1 and CD36 are intimately connected physiologically.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001914-Lawler1">&#x0005b;32&#x0005d;</xref> Finding that peptides against the type I repeat region of TSP-1 inhibited LAP-induced cellular activation confirmed that TSP-1 is critical to the biological functions of LAP. Blocking CD36, a known receptor for TSP-1, limited the LAP-mediated effects in a chemotaxis model of monocyte recruitment. However, blocking CD36 did not appear as integral to LAP's ability to block allogeneic DTHR as there appeared to only be a trend toward modest attenuation in this system. Our data suggest that the signaling induced by LAP is more complex than a simple interaction between LAP and CD36 mediated by the type I repeat region of TSP-1. This is based on the fact that the anti-TSP-1 antibody used to inhibit LAP function in these studies was the clone A6.1, which targets the C-terminal collagen type V binding region of TSP-1. Although the exact binding region of TSP-1 that is targeted by clone A6.1 is not known, because of the close proximity of the type I repeat region to the C-terminal domain of TSP-1 and the size of the antibody it is plausible to think the antibody's presence may interfere with type I repeat function. Since RGD peptides or anti-CD47 IgG did not modify the biological activity of LAP, we presume that the inhibition of LAP function by clone A6.1 was not due to blocking CD47 or RGD peptide binding regions. Regardless, it is likely that more than the type I repeat region of TSP-1 is necessary for LAP to induce target cell activation. TSP-1 may anchor several proteins together to facilitate signaling as has been shown in other experimental systems.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001914-Khalil1">&#x0005b;35&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001914-Yehualaeshet1">&#x0005b;36&#x0005d;</xref></p><p>In summary, this report demonstrates that LAP has biological activity independent of its parent molecule, TGF-&#x003b2;1, that requires TSP-1 and to a lesser extent CD36 in human monocytes. These data provide important support for a critical re-evaluation of the relationship of LAP to active TGF-&#x003b2;1and its role in biologic systems. This hypothesis emphasizes the need to understand the &#x0201c;fate&#x0201d; of the LAP after pathophysiologic activation of TGF-&#x003b2;1 and may support investigating it as a novel biological target for fibrotic and inflammatory human disease.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>We would like to thank the Core Facilities of the Dorothy Davis Heart and Lung Research Institute at The Ohio State University for facilitating the experiments involved in this research and Pravin Kaumaya, PhD for kindly preparing some of the peptides (LSKL and SLLK) used for these studies.
