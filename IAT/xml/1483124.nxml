Loss of Wee1 in many systems, including yeast and drosophila, leads to premature mitotic entry. However, the developmental role of Wee1 in mammals remains unclear. In this study, we established Wee1 knockout mice by gene targeting. We found that <italic>Wee<sup>-/-</sup></italic> embryos were defective in the G2/M cell cycle checkpoint induced by &#x003b3;-irradiation and died of apoptosis before embryonic (E) day 3.5. To study the function of Wee1 further, we have developed MEF cells in which Wee1 is disrupted by a tamoxifen inducible Cre-LoxP approach. We found that acute deletion of Wee1 resulted in profound growth defects and cell death. Wee1 deficient cells displayed chromosome aneuploidy and DNA damage as revealed by &#x003b3;-H2AX foci formation and Chk2 activation. Further studies revealed a conserved mechanism of Wee1 in regulating mitotic entry and the G2/M checkpoint compared with other lower organisms. These data provide in vivo evidence that mammalian Wee1 plays a critical role in maintaining genome integrity and is essential for embryonic survival at the pre-implantation stage of mouse development.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Cdk1</kwd><kwd>Chk2</kwd><kwd>G2/M</kwd><kwd>apoptosis</kwd><kwd>genetic instability</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="results"><title>1. Results and Discussion</title><p>Cells treated with DNA damaging agents, such as &#x003b3;-radiation, coordinately arrest their cell cycle progression at varying phases to allow time for repairing the DNA damage. This is achieved by the activation of cell cycle checkpoints, which monitor DNA status and ensure the completion of the previous phase in the cell cycle before advancing to the next phase <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>. It was shown that Wee1 and Cdc25 cooperatively regulate G2/M boundary by inhibiting Cdk1 activity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>. Wee1 and Cdk1 also regulate each other and play a critical role in controlling the transition into mitosis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>. However, the function of Wee1 in mammalian development is unknown. To investigate this, we have established a Wee1-deficient mouse strain by gene targeting and studied its role in early mouse embryos and cultured mouse embryonic fibroblast (MEF) cells.</p><p><italic>Wee1</italic> was mutated by a replacement type gene-targeting vector, <italic>ploxPneo-Wee1,</italic> which introduced a <italic>ploxPneo </italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref> into intron 10 and the third loxP into intron 8 of the <italic>Wee1 </italic>locus, respectively (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>A). The correct targeting of the vector followed by Cre-loxP mediated recombination would delete exons 9 and 10, which encode the kinase domain of Wee1. Three out of 114 G418<sup>r</sup>/FIAU<sup>r</sup> ES clones had both the <italic>ploxPneo</italic> and the loxP introduced into the <italic>Wee1</italic> locus based on Southern blot analysis (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>C). After germline transmission, we crossed heterozygous mutant (<italic>Wee1<sup>+/neo</sup></italic>) mice with <italic>EIIa-Cre</italic> transgenic mice to delete exons 9 and 10 from mouse germline (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>B). Our PCR analysis on genomic DNA extracted from mice with various genotypes confirmed the predicted targeting and deletion in the <italic>Wee1</italic> locus (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>D).</p><p>Adult <italic>Wee1<sup>+/-</sup></italic> mice showed no obvious abnormality and were fertile. After interbreeding the <italic>Wee1<sup>+/-</sup></italic> mice, we failed to obtain <italic>Wee1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice from 94 mice genotyped at weaning while the wild type and <italic>Wee1<sup>+/-</sup></italic> mice were presented at a ratio of 1:2.3 (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>). As no dead <italic>Wee1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice were found after birth, we suspected that <italic>Wee1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice died at embryonic development stages. Our analysis of embryos at embryonic (E) 13.5 to E7.5 also did not detect any homozygotes and abnormal deciduas (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>), suggesting that the <italic>Wee1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> embryos died at stages prior to implantation. To verify this, we isolated E3.5 embryos derived from <italic>Wee1<sup>+/-</sup></italic> interbreeding. We found 4 <italic>Wee1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> embryos out of 27 embryos analyzed although genotypes of 6 embryos could not be reliably determined due to a technical difficulty in manipulating small embryos. The majority of the <italic>Wee1<sup>+/+</sup></italic> and <italic>Wee1<sup>+/-</sup></italic> embryos were at the blastocyst stage, and possessed a distinct inner cell mass (ICM) and an outer layer of trophectoderm cells. The <italic>Wee1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> embryos were comprised of fewer cells than their <italic>Wee1<sup>+/+</sup></italic> and <italic>Wee1<sup>+/-</sup></italic> littermates and remained at the morulae stage (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>A-C). The mutant cells were disorganized without an obvious compaction. Those observations suggest that the development of <italic>Wee1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> embryos was interrupted before reaching the blastocyst stage.</p><p>Because <italic>Wee1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> embryos were retarded with abnormal morphology at the blastocyst stage, we investigated whether these embryos would grow if extra time was given. To monitor this process, we inoculated blastocytsts isolated from <italic>Wee1<sup>+/-</sup></italic> female mice, which were mated with <italic>Wee1<sup>+/-</sup></italic> males, into 24-well culture dishes. Our analysis of 23 blastocysts indicated that all embryos showing obvious cell proliferation were either <italic>Wee1<sup>+/+</sup></italic> or <italic>Wee1<sup>+/-</sup></italic> (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>D,E). The remaining 7 embryos, which were abnormal initially, did not show any signs of growth and all cells degraded during culture (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>E). Genotype of these embryos could not be determined as we failed to extract DNA from them. We suspected that most of these embryos would be homozygous for <italic>Wee1</italic> mutation based on our earlier observations that <italic>Wee1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> embryos were presented at E3.5 with abnormal morphology (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>B,C). Thus, <italic>Wee1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> embryos failed to grow even when more time is given.</p><p>Next, we determined potential causes for the death of <italic>Wee1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> embryos by TUNEL assay. Our analysis revealed that about 50% of cells in <italic>Wee1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> embryos underwent apoptosis while about 5-10% cells in wild type and <italic>Wee1<sup>+/-</sup></italic> embryos were TUNEL positive (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>A). There was no statistic difference between wild type and <italic>Wee1<sup>+/-</sup></italic> embryos, however the differences between wild type and <italic>Wee1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> embryos (p&#x0003c;0.001), and between <italic>Wee1<sup>+/-</sup></italic> and <italic>Wee1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> embryos (p&#x0003c;0.001) were significant (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>B). This observation suggests that <italic>Wee1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> embryos die at 16-32 cell stages due to apoptosis.</p><p>Next, we studied possible causes for the increased apoptosis observed in <italic>Wee1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> embryos. In vitro studies revealed that Wee1 plays an essential role in the G2/M cell cycle checkpoint <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>. Therefore, we investigated whether Wee1 had a similar role in vivo. We isolated embryos at E2.5 and E3.5 from <italic>Wee1<sup>+/-</sup></italic> females after they were mated with <italic>Wee1<sup>+/-</sup></italic> male mice. The mitotic index was determined in these embryos prior to, and after they were irradiated with &#x003b3;-radiation (10 Gy) using an antibody against phosphorylated histone H3. A significant decrease in the number of mitotic cells was observed in both E2.5 <italic>Wee1<sup>+/+ </sup></italic>and <italic>Wee1<sup>+/-</sup></italic> embryos after irradiation while no obvious change was seen in <italic>Wee1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> embryos (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>C-E). This observation suggests that <italic>Wee1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> embryos were defective in activating the G2/M cell cycle checkpoint induced by DNA damage. The mitotic index of E3.5 embryos declined from 20% to 4% (p=0.048), from 27% to 13% (p=0.056) in <italic>Wee1<sup>+/-</sup></italic> embryos, and from 65% to 60% (p=0.594) in <italic>Wee1<sup>-/- </sup></italic>embryos (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>C). Thus, compared with <italic>Wee1<sup>+/+ </sup></italic>embryos, absence of one wild type copy of <italic>Wee1 </italic>in E3.5 embryos might result in a partial loss of the G2/M checkpoint induced by &#x003b3;-irradiation. Of note, <italic>Wee1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> embryos had much more mitotic cells than <italic>Wee1<sup>+/+</sup></italic> and <italic>Wee1<sup>+/-</sup></italic> embryos at both time points prior to irradiation. Thus, although the <italic>Wee1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> embryos appeared morphologically normal at E2.5, some fundamental alterations at cellular level had already started, which might account for the developmental abnormality shown in the blastocyst stage.</p><p>To study cellular defects associated with Wee1 deficiency, we established MEF cells allowing for the acute mutation of <italic>Wee1 </italic>using a 4-hydroxytamaxifen (4-HT) inducible Cre-LoxP system. These cells (<italic>Wee1<sup>Co/-</sup>;Tm-Cre</italic>) carried a conditional <italic>Wee1</italic> allele with its exons 9 and 10 flanked by loxP sites (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>A), a mutant allele missing exons 9 and 10, and a tamoxifen inducible <italic>Cre</italic> gene (<italic>Tm-Cre</italic>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>. Treatment with 4-HT in these cells causes nuclear translocalization of Cre, leading to the deletion of the conditional allele (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>B). Our MTT assay revealed significantly reduced cell quantity after the <italic>Wee1<sup>Co/-</sup>;Tm-Cre</italic> cells were exposed to 4-HT compared with untreated or vehicle (ethanol) treated cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>A). In contrast, only slight reduction in cell quantity was observed in control cells (<italic>Wee1<sup>+/Co</sup>;Tm-Cre</italic>, <italic>Wee1<sup>+/+</sup>;Tm-Cre</italic>, and <italic>Wee1<sup>+/-</sup>;Tm-Cre</italic>) after they were treated with 4-HT compared to untreated or vehicle treated cells (data not shown). Microscopic analysis revealed that many of the 4-HT treated <italic>Wee1<sup>Co/-</sup>;Tm-Cre</italic> cells showed nuclear fragmentation and membrane blebbing, and were rounded up detaching from the culture plate (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>A). These abnormalities were not seen in untreated cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>B). Staining with annexin-V, we detected increased apoptotic cells 24 hours upon the addition of 4-HT (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>B), while the fraction of BrdU positive cells maintained unaltered (not shown).</p><p>Because our analysis of E2.5-3.5 embryos indicated that the absence of Wee1 impaired the G2/M cell cycle checkpoint, we next studied this cell cycle checkpoint in the cultured MEF cells. Our analysis revealed a sharp reduction of the mitotic index in the ethanol treated <italic>Wee1<sup>Co/-</sup>;Tm-Cre</italic> cells one hour after &#x003b3;-irradiation, while only a slight reduction of mitotic fraction was observed in the in 4-HT treated cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>C), suggesting a defective G2/M checkpoint in these cells. Based on this observation, we conclude that Wee1 plays a critical role in G2/M cell cycle checkpoint in mouse cells both in vitro and in vivo.</p><p>Of note, the growth defects observed in Wee1 deficient cells are much more severe than those observed in many other mutant cells that are defective in the G2/M cell cycle checkpoint, such as BRCA1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref> or ATM mutant <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref> cells, suggesting the phenotypes associated with Wee1 deficiency could also be contributed to other defects in addition to the defective G2/M cell cycle checkpoint. It was shown previously in budding yeast and Drosophila that the absence of Wee1 results in premature entry of mitosis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>. To investigate whether Wee1 deficiency impairs this function in the mouse, we analyzed the <italic>Wee1<sup>Co/-</sup>;Tm-Cre</italic> cells for a possible defect in this checkpoint in the absence or presence of 4-HT. Using double immunofluorescent staining with antibodies against BrdU and phosphorylated histone H3, we found about 40% of histone H3 positive <italic>Wee1<sup>Co/-</sup>;Tm-Cre</italic> cells were also positive for BrdU when analyzed 24 hours after 4-HT exposure, while only less than 5% of ethanol treated cells were double positive (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>D-F). To provide independent confirmation, we had also stained <italic>Wee1<sup>Co/-</sup>;Tm-Cre</italic> cells with PI and an antibody against phosphorylated histone H3 followed by flow cytometry analysis. We found that about 50% of phosphorylated H3 positive cells had a DNA content less than 4n while this was not found in the untreated population (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>G). Thus, like the yeast and Drosophila, the absence of Weel triggered premature entry into mitosis.</p><p>Because Wee1 is a negative regulator of Cdk1, the absence of Wee1 is predicted to increase Ckd1 activity. To investigate if the premature mitotic entry observed in the Wee1 mutant cells is indeed associated with the increased Cdk1 activity, we first examined the level of Cdk1-Tyr15, which is specifically phosphorylated by Wee1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>. Our data revealed a significant reduction of Cdk1 phosphorylation at Tyr15 24 hours after 4-HT treatment (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>H), indicating that Cdk1 is activated in the absence of Wee1. To test whether the activation of Cdk1 is responsible for premature mitotic entry, we treated <italic>Wee1<sup>Co/-</sup>;Tm-Cre</italic> cells with 4-ht in the presence or absence of purralanol A that specifically inhibits Cdk1 activity. Our data indicated that while purralanol A reduced slightly the percentage of BrdU positive cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>I), it decreased significantly the fraction of mitotic cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>J), leading to the blocking of premature mitotic entry of 4-HT treated <italic>Wee1<sup>Co/-</sup>;Tm-Cre</italic> cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>K)</p><p>Western blot analysis also revealed increased phosphorylation of Chk2 upon acute deletion of Wee1 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>H). Because Chk2 is phosphorylated by ATM upon DNA damage <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>, we checked DNA damage in the 4-HT treated <italic>Wee1<sup>Co/-</sup>;Tm-Cre</italic> cells using an antibody against phosphorylated form of H2AX (&#x003b3;-H2AX), which relocates to double strand breaks (DSBs) upon DNA damage <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>. This analysis detected a robust increase of &#x003b3;-H2AX nuclear foci in the <italic>Wee1<sup>Co/-</sup>;Tm-Cre</italic> cells 24 hours after 4-HT treatment but not in the ethanol treated cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>A,B). Correlating with DNA damage, the 4-HT treated <italic>Wee1<sup>Co/-</sup>;Tm-Cre</italic> cells 24 hours exhibited increased chromosome aneuploidy compared with ethanol treated cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>C-E). Because Wee1 does not play a direct role in DNA damage repair, we believe that the premature mitotic entry due to Wee1 deficiency could be a cause for DSBs when mutant cells try to initiate mitosis prior to the completion of semi-conservative DNA replication. The DSBs and genetic instability in Wee1 deficient cells, in turn, trigger the DNA damage response, leading to the increased cell death.</p><p>In conclusion, our analysis on Wee1-null embryos and Weel-conditional mutant MEFs indicates that Wee1 plays an essential role in maintaining genetic stability and embryonic survival at the pre-implantation stage of mouse development. Our data revealed that similar to lower organisms <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>, murine Wee1 controls mitotic entry and the G2/M cell cycle checkpoint through the regulation of Cdk1 activity. Recent studies reveal that Wee1 serves as a downstream mediator of the breast cancer associated gene 1 (BRCA1) in activating the G2/M cell cycle checkpoint upon DNA damage <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>. Future studies should be directed to the relationship between BRCA1 and Wee1 in breast cancer formation and genomic integrity. In addition, phenotypes associated with Wee1-deficiency, in terms of embryonic lethality, premature mitotic entry and defective G2/M cell cycle checkpoint, are similar to those caused by Chk1-null mutation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>. Because activity of Chk1 is also found to be regulated by BRCA1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>, the genetic interplay between Chk1 and Wee1 should also be addressed in future studies. A recent investigation indicates that cell division in many mammalian tissues may be associated with specific times of day and that regulation of Wee1 expression by the molecular components of the circadian clockwork may play a key role in this process <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>. Conditional mutations of Wee1 using a Cre-loxP approach <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref> to overcome early embryonic lethality would facilitate functional study of Wee1 in all phases of murine development.</p></sec><sec><title>2.

A 5.4 kb fragment, which is 5' to the exon 11 starting from a XhoI site in intron 10 of <italic>Wee1</italic> gene, was inserted into the <italic>pLoxPneo</italic> plasmid <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref> that was digested with NotI and XhoI.

A loxP sequence <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref> was inserted into a BbeI site in 5' arm (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>A).

The cells were stained with antibodies to BrdU (Becton-Dickinson) phosphorylated histone H3 (Upstate biotechnology) followed by secondary antibody.</p></sec><sec><title>Immunoblot Analysis</title><p>Western blot analysis was accomplished according to standard procedures using ECL detection (Amersham). The following primary antibodies were used: Chk2 (Transduction Laboratories), Wee1 (H-3 Santa Cruz), Cdk1, (SC-54 Santa Cruz), and Phospho-Cdk1 (Tyr-15) (#9111, Cell Signaling), and &#x003b2;-actin (Sigma). Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit, sheep, and anti-mouse antibodies (Amersham) were used as secondary antibodies.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank members of Deng lab for critical discussion and reading of the manuscript.
