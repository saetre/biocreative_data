This essential protein has previously been implicated in processes as diverse as ribosome biogenesis, translational fidelity and mRNA stability. Here, the inability to maintain the yeast Killer virus was used as a proxy for large subunit defects to identify a series of L10 mutants. These mapped to roughly four discrete regions of the protein. A detailed analysis of mutants located in the N-terminal &#x02018;hook&#x02019; of L10, which inserts into the bulge of 25S rRNA helix 89, revealed strong effects on rRNA structure corresponding to the entire path taken by the tRNA 3&#x02032; end as it moves through the large subunit during the elongation cycle. The mutant-induced structural changes are wide-ranging, affecting ribosome biogenesis, elongation factor binding, drug resistance/hypersensitivity, translational fidelity and virus maintenance. The importance of L10 as a potential transducer of information through the ribosome, and of a possible role of its N-terminal domain in switching between the pre- and post-translocational states are discussed.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>The ribosome is a complex macromolecular machine that orchestrates multiple reactions in a highly coordinated manner. Although atomic level ribosome structures reveal the topologies of the functional centers, how these exchange information and coordinate their activities remains an active field of inquiry. For example, during the translation elongation cycle the ribosome must sequentially bind EF-Tu&#x02022;aa-tRNA&#x02022;GTP (ternary complex or TC; in eukaryotes the elongation factor is called &#x02018;eEF1A&#x02019;), stimulate GTP hydrolysis by EF-Tu, accommodate aa-tRNA into the large subunit, effect peptidyltransfer, bind EF-G (eEF2 in eukaryotes), again stimulate GTP hydrolysis by EF-G and translocate along the mRNA by one codon. The TC and EF-G are structurally similar (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>), and there is a large degree of overlap between their ribosome binding sites. In yeast, for example, eEF2 contacts the &#x003b1;-sarcin-ricin loop (SRL, H95 of 25S rRNA), the GTPase-associated center (GAC composed of ribosomal protein L12, H43, H44), Helices 33, 34, 69 and 89, ribosomal proteins L9, L12 and the P proteins (P0, P1&#x003b1;, P1&#x003b2;, P2&#x003b1;, P2&#x003b2;) on the large ribosomal subunit, while it also interacts with many elements of the small subunit including h5, h15, h33, h34, h44 in the head and body domains, and with ribosomal protein S23 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>). The interactions between these factors and the ribosome were initially characterized using chemical footprinting methods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>). A cryo-electron microscopy study of the TC stalled on an <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> 70S ribosome with kirromycin revealed a similarly complex set of interactions that included the SRL and the GAC on the large subunit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>).</p><p>We have been using a yeast-based system to dissect how the ribosome coordinates TC binding, aa-tRNA accommodation, peptidyltransfer and eEF2 binding. Molecular genetics and biochemical studies using mutant rRNAs and ribosomal proteins are identifying important elements and allosteric rearrangements involved in these processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5 B6 B7 B8 B9 B10 B11">5&#x02013;11</xref>). These studies have led us to focus on structural elements in the vicinity of the &#x02018;accommodation corridor&#x02019;, a passageway located along the interface between H89 and the H90&#x02013;H92 structure of the large subunit rRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>). Previously, we demonstrated the involvement of a central extension of ribosomal protein L3 in coordinating TC, eEF2 binding and peptidyltransfer by helping to open and close this structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>).</p><p>Ribosomal protein L3 is located on the H90&#x02013;H92 side of the accommodation corridor. Examination of this region reveals that another ribosomal protein, L10 (L16 in <italic>E. coli</italic> and L10e in <italic>Haloarcula marismortui</italic>) is located on the H89 side of the corridor. L10 extends from the solvent accessible side near the factor-binding site down toward the peptidyltransferase center (PTC) in the core of the large subunit. The N-terminal three-quarters of yeast L10 is sandwiched between helices 89 and 38, and appears to be largely structurally conserved with its bacterial and archael homologs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13 B14 B15 B16">13&#x02013;16</xref>). Inspection of these structures reveals that these proteins represent an extension of H39 of the large subunit rRNA. In cryo-EM reconstitutions, the eukaryote specific C-terminal region of L10 appears to form a large unresolved mass adjacent to the L7/L12 stalk in association with Helix 38 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>). In <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>, L10 is encoded by the essential single copy <italic>RPL10</italic> gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>). L10 plays a critical role in 60S subunit biogenesis: incorporation of L10 into the large subunit constitutes the last step of 60S subunit biogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>). Specifically, immature large subunits lacking L10 are exported from the nucleus to the cytoplasm via the Crm1p pathway in complex with the export adapter protein Nmd3p, after which L10 is brought to the ribosome in the complex with Sqt1p, promoting release of Nmd3p followed by incorporation of L10. Depletion studies demonstrate that large subunits lacking L10 are unable to form 80S ribosomes and are translationally inactive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>). Thus, L10 is the key component required for the final activation step of ribosomes in the cytoplasm. In addition, at least one <italic>rpl10</italic> allele has been shown to inhibit degradation of nonsense-containing mRNAs, suggesting that L10 may play a role in translational fidelity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>). Thus, L10 is important both for ribosome assembly and post-transcriptional regulatory processes.</p><p>Toward the goal of furthering our understanding of L10, a primary library of randomly mutagenized <italic>rpl10</italic> alleles was screened for the inability to maintain the yeast &#x02018;Killer&#x02019; phenotype, which is caused by an endogenous dsRNA virus that is highly sensitive to a broad array of changes in the translational apparatus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>). This forward genetic screen identified 56 new <italic>rpl10</italic> alleles. The mutants generally clustered into four regions of the L10 structure: (i) in a &#x02018;hook&#x02019; of L10 that inserts into the bulge at the base Helix 89; (ii) in a cluster that appears to form a bridge between Helices 38 and 39; (iii) a series of amino acids that appear to form a plane along the face of L10 that interacts with the distal regions of Helices 89 and 38; and (iv) amino acids present in the unresolved region of the protein that may directly interact with the GTPase-associated center. The current study focuses on the N-terminal &#x02018;hook&#x02019; region of L10. A series of genetic and biochemical studies led to a detailed analysis of the effects of two mutants in this region on 25S rRNA structure. These were found to promote structural changes that map along the path taken by tRNAs through the elongation cycle. When considered along with the physical location of L10 within the large subunit and its role in ribosome biogenesis, the finding presented here are used to build a model for how L10 plays an important role for coordinating tRNA passage through the ribosome.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Strains, media and genetic methods</title><p><italic>Escherichia coli</italic> strain DH5&#x003b1; was used to amplify plasmids, and <italic>E. coli</italic> transformations were performed using the high-efficiency transformation method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>).

Oligonucleotide primers were purchased from IDT (Coralville, IA). Dual luciferase assays to quantitatively monitor translational recoding in yeast were performed as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>). The latter involved use of a 0-frame control reporter in combination with &#x02212;1 ribosomal frameshift, or nonsense suppression test reporter constructs. Recoding efficiencies and statistical analyses were performed as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>). Ten-fold dilution spot assays to monitor sensitivity to anisomycin (20 &#x003bc;g/ml) or paromomycin (3 mg/ml) were performed as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Generation of <italic>rpl10</italic> alleles</title><p>A library of plasmid-borne <italic>rpl10</italic> mutants was constructed using the error-prone PCR and gap repair method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>) based on pJD589.

Silent mutations were added into codons 4, 5, 220 and 221 of the <italic>RPL10</italic> ORF to create two StuI restriction sites. Mutagenesis primers (70 nt) for PCR were designed to be complementary to the 5&#x02032; and 3&#x02032; UTRs of <italic>RPL10</italic> and include the <italic>RPL10</italic> translational start and stop codons: (forward 5&#x02032;TTCCGCAAGTGC TTTTGGAGTGGGACTTTCAAACTTTAAAGTACA GTATATCAAATAACTAATTCAAGATGGCTAGAA GG3&#x02032;, reverse 5&#x02032;AATTACTGTTTAATAAACTAGAAT TTAAATCAAAAAAATTTCTCTTTTAAGTTAGTTC AAATGTTTGAAAAGAACTTAGG3&#x02032;). Random mutagenesis was performed with the GeneMorph II PCR random mutagenesis kit with template concentrations optimized to generate between one and four mutations per <italic>RPL10</italic> coding sequence. pJD589 was digested with StuI, and the linearized plasmid lacking the <italic>RPL10</italic> coding sequence was purified by Tris&#x02013;acetate&#x02013;EDTA&#x02013;agarose gel electrophoresis.

Note that recombination between the PCR product and linearized vector was designed so that the silent mutations would revert to wild-type sequence in the recombinant clones.</p></sec><sec><title>Identification of <italic>rpl10</italic> alleles unable to support the yeast killer virus</title><p>Approximately 3000 His<sup>+</sup> colonies were arrayed onto -his plates, replica plated onto 4.7 MB plates seeded with 5 &#x000d7; 47 killer indicator cells, and incubated at 20&#x000b0;C to identify Killer<sup>&#x02212;</sup> (K<sup>&#x02212;</sup>) colonies as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>).

These facts, in combination with the centralized location of L10 within the 3-D structure of the large subunit, provided us with the motive to pursue an in-depth molecular genetic and biochemical analysis of L10 function. Toward to this end, a library of randomly mutagenized <italic>rpl10</italic> alleles was screened for the inability to maintain the yeast killer phenotype. The killer system of yeast is composed of L-A helper, and M<sub>1</sub> satellite dsRNA viruses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>). The genome of the L-A virus encodes two open reading frames where the first encodes the <italic>Gag</italic> (capsid) protein, and the second encodes a viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RDRP), the production of which is dependent on a programmed &#x02013;1 ribosomal frameshift (&#x02013;1 PRF) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>). The single open reading frame of the M<sub>1</sub> satellite virus encodes a protein toxin that is exported into the surrounding media and kills uninfected cells, thus producing the easily detectable Killer<sup>+</sup> (K<sup>+</sup>) phenotype, and its maintenance requires L-A to supply capsid proteins and RDRP. M<sub>1</sub> is highly sensitive to small perturbations in the translational apparatus, including changes in &#x02013;1 PRF efficiency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>), ribosome biogenesis defects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>) and decreased overall protein synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>). Thus, the killer assay provides a simple and rapid method to screen for translational defects.</p><p>The coding region of <italic>RPL10</italic> was subjected to random PCR mutagenesis and screened for loss of the killer phenotype as described in the Materials and methods section. Mutant <italic>rpl10</italic>-<italic>HIS3</italic> plasmids were rescued from Killer minus (K<sup>&#x02212;</sup>) strains, passaged through <italic>E. coli</italic>, reintroduced into <italic>rpl10&#x00394;</italic> cells and rescored for their abilities to promote M<sub>1</sub> virus loss. Due to a significantly high intrinsic rate of killer loss in the JD1293 strain background (&#x0223c;10%), the plasmid rescue and reintroduction procedure was repeated three times to eliminate false-positive results. The <italic>rpl10</italic> mutations responsible for conferring the K<sup>&#x02212;</sup> phenotype were identified by DNA sequence analysis. From &#x0003e;3000 colonies tested, a total of 56 unique mutants were identified. In addition, &#x0223c;15% of the mutants were lethal as determined by their inability to grow as the sole allele of <italic>rpl10</italic> (data not shown). The collection of K<sup>&#x02013;</sup> mutants contained alleles harboring 35 single mutations, 20 double mutations and one triple mutant. These are summarized in <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkn643/DC1">Supplementary Table</ext-link> 1. A very large amount of overlap was observed between the single and double mutants. The high degree of overlap between the single and double mutants led us to conclude that the mutagenesis was performed to near saturation, and the large number of alleles with single amino acid substitutions allowed exclusion of alleles with multiple mutations from subsequent analysis. Among the single mutants, multiple substitutions were found at amino acid residues 7, 9, 40, 93, 94 and 145. Areas of L10 with high frequencies of mutations were clustered in three regions of the protein. These regions spanned amino acids 7&#x02013;17, 59&#x02013;94 and 144&#x02013;152. Consistent with findings from the Johnson lab, no viable mutants mapping to the unstructured central loop (amino acids 102&#x02013;112) were identified in the current study, consistent with the suggestion that his loop may play a critical function in peptidyltransfer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>). As diagramed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>, the mutants appear to cluster into four distinct groups, specifically: (i) in a hook-like structure located at the N-terminal region of L10 that inserts into the major groove of helix 89; (ii) in a space that appears to link helices 38 and 39; (iii) along a plane of the protein lying &#x02018;atop&#x02019; of helix 89; and (iv) in the unresolved C-terminal domain of L10 that appears to extend outward toward the GTPase-associated center. Given this apparent structural complexity of L10, we chose to focus on characterizing the N-terminal &#x02018;hook domain&#x02019; mutants for this study. <fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p>Localization of the L10 mutations identified in this study.

As a semi-quantitative monitor of this, 10-fold dilution spot assays were performed on rich medium at 30&#x000b0;C, revealing allele-specific growth defects by the R7Q and Y11C mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>A). Note that the large colonies in the Y11C sample appear to be escape mutants. Changes in ribosome structure and function also alter the growth characteristics of cells at decreased and/or elevated temperatures. Thus, these mutants were assayed with regard to their resistance or sensitivity to low (15&#x000b0;C) and high (37&#x000b0;C) temperatures. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>B, mutations of the tyrosines in the N-terminal region of the protein bridging helices 89 and 39, i.e. Y9H, Y9N and Y11C promoted enhanced growth at low temperature. In contrast, none of these mutants affected growth at 37&#x000b0;C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>C). Ten-fold serial dilution assays were also used to probe the effects of small molecule protein synthesis inhibitors on the translational apparatus. Anisomycin is a competitive inhibitor of A-site binding and sterically hinders positioning of the acceptor end of the A-site tRNA in the PTC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>). All of the other mutants were either hypersensitive as determined by reduced growth at 15 &#x003bc;g/ml anisomycin (R7Q, Y9H, Y9N and Y11C), or resistant as evidenced by the ability to grow on medium containing 20 &#x003bc;g/ml anisomycin (R7L, R7P and Y9C) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>D and E, and summarized in <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>). These data indicate a high degree of allele-specificity with regard to this drug. Another small molecule drug, paromomycin, binds at the decoding center on the small subunit and promotes conformational changes associated with formation of the codon&#x02013;anticodon helix between mRNA and incoming A-site tRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>). Thus, paromomycin was used as a probe for defects associated with interactions between the small and large subunits. None of the mutants promoted paromomycin-specific changes in growth (data not shown), thus indicating that the observed effects on cell growth were conferred by changes in the large subunit. <fig id="F2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><p>Genetic phenotypes of the L10 N-terminal hook mutants.

This analysis revealed strong allele-specific effects (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>A, gray bars). While nonsense suppression was 0.27% &#x000b1; 0.01% in wild-type cells, it was stimulated by &#x0223c;1.5-fold by the R7L mutant but not by the other two mutants as this position. In contrast all of the Y9 mutants appeared to promote hyperaccurate termination codon recognition, decreasing rates of nonsense-suppression by 1.8-fold (Y9C) and 2.5-fold (Y9N).

During translation initiation, the 43S complex recruits the mRNA to form the 48S complex, after which the 60S subunit is recruited. Insufficient levels of 60S subunits, or 60S subunits deficient in their ability to form 80S ribosomes, tend to promote accumulation of 48S&#x02013;mRNA complexes, and this additional mass results in intermediate sedimentation coefficients as monitored by the appearance of &#x02018;halfmers shoulders&#x02019; on the denser sides of polysome tracings. L10 mutants affecting inclusion of the protein into large subunits have been shown to promote the appearance of these halfmer shoulders in polysome profiles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>), and 60S ribosomal subunit biogenesis defects have been linked with defects in killer virus maintenance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>). Sucrose gradient analyses revealed that all but the Y9H and Y11C mutants promoted formation of halfmers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>C), many with greater amplitude than previously observed in the temperature sensitive mutants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>). Additionally, observation of decreased amplitude of the 60S relative to 40S peaks, of 80S relative to 40S and 60S peaks, or an increase in the amount of material near the top of the gradient are also associated with 60S subunit biogenesis defects. These effects were observed in the R7L, R7Q, Y9C, Y9H, Y9N and Y11C mutants (summarized in <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>).

The primers used were designed to probe functional regions of domain V (including the A-site and P-site loops, the PTC, and the helices adjacent to these structures, i.e. Helices 73, 74, 88&#x02013;93), Helices 94&#x02013;96 and Helix 38 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>).</p><p>Autoradiograms generated from these experiments are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>A. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>B and C show 2-dimensional maps of the relevant regions of yeast 25S rRNA onto which nucleotides having altered chemical protection patterns in the Y11C and Y9C mutants have been mapped.

The chemical protection patterns are also mapped onto five additional high-resolution ribosome structures (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkn643/DC1">Supplementary Figure</ext-link> 2). Although no significant differences were observed in the locations of bases with chemical modification changes, as discussed below, this analysis did reveal differences in the locations of the N-terminal hook domain. Examination of the data reveals that both of the mutants confer significant changes in 25S rRNA structure. The Y11C mutant is marked by significant changes radiating outward and parallel to L10 from the site of the mutation along Helices 89 and 38 (and expansion segment 12, which is not present in the atomic resolution structure) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>A, B and D). The affected bases in these structures are mostly deprotected, suggesting that the Y11C mutant destabilizes interactions between L10 and these rRNA helical structures. Interestingly, the changes in H38 and H89 are similar to those promoted by rRNA mutants located in Helix 38 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>). An additional series of long-distance changes are observed extending along a line from the base of the peptidyltransferase center (G2813&#x02013;G2815) along Helix 74 and out to Helix 88: as discussed below, this follows the path taken by the 3&#x02032; end of the deacylated tRNA as it moves from the P-site to the E-site and exits the ribosome. The affected bases in this cluster tend to be hyperprotected as compared to wild-type ribosomes, suggesting that the Y11C promoted disruption of the local interactions between L10 and Helices 38 and 89 has caused them to collapse into more distantly located structures. This pattern is also similar to one observed by another rRNA mutant, &#x003a8;2922C, located at the base of Helix 92 in the A-loop (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>). Additionally, one base at the tip of Helix 91 (A2901, <italic>E. coli</italic> U2583), which abuts the SRL, became hyperprotected by this mutant. Attention is directed to four specific bases. First, U2860 (<italic>E. coli</italic> U2483) helps to form one side of the first &#x02018;gate&#x02019; through which aa-tRNA passes during the process of accommodation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>). Second, A2818 (<italic>E. coli</italic> A2450) is located in the core of the peptidyltransferase center. Third, G2815 (<italic>E. coli</italic> G2447) was hyperprotected by this mutant and is discussed in the context of anisomycin hypersensitivity. Fourth, G2777 (<italic>E. coli</italic> A2406) which is normally base-paired with C311 (<italic>E. coli</italic> U416) in helix 22 became deprotected, and C2775 (<italic>E. coli</italic> U2404) displayed an enhanced in-line cleavage pattern, suggesting an opening of a proposed E-site gate responsible for movement of tRNA from the P-site to the E-site and release of deacylated tRNA from the ribosome. <fig id="F5" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><p>Structure probing of wild-type and mutant ribosomes.

Proximal to the mutant amino acid, U2828 (<italic>E. coli</italic> U2460) was hyperprotected, suggesting that an interaction between it and L10 were significantly altered. Deprotection of bases in Helix 38 (A1947, A1048) and Helix 89 (A2844, A2850) that appear to interact with other parts of L10 suggests that the local change may have radiated outward from the mutated residue disrupting the interaction of L10 with these helices. Hyperprotection of bases along the aa-tRNA accommodation corridor, in particular U2861 (<italic>E. coli</italic> U2492) and U2923 (<italic>E. coli</italic> U2555), and extending outward to regions of Helix 95, suggests collapse of this structure into the corridor.

In particular, K15 and Y17 link Helices 38 and 39, each appearing to make contact with both structures. The fourth group is located in the C-terminal region of L10, the structure of which is currently unresolved. Together with tip of the H38, this region of the protein forms an extension that approaches the L7/L12 stalk. We attribute K40 and G81positions to this group because they topologically represent the base of this extension. Consistent with a previous report (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>), no mutations were found in the unstructured loop of L10 that is thought to most closely approach the PTC, thus indirectly suggesting that this loop is either not important for ribosome biogenesis, peptidyltransfer and/or translational fidelity (unlikely), or that it is so important that mutants in this region are inviable (more likely). A full analysis of all of the mutants identified in the current study is beyond the scope of a single manuscript. Thus, we chose to focus more deeply on those located in the N-terminal &#x02018;hook&#x02019; region of L10 in the current study in order to establish a connection with ribosomal protein L3 (see accompanying manuscript by Meskauskas,A. and Dinman,J.D.) with an emphasis on how ribosome structure informs function.</p><sec><title>Ribosome structure and elongation factor interactions: an allosteric model</title><p>The TC and eEF2 are structural mimics of one another and bind to essentially the same site of the ribosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>). How then does the ribosome coordinate its interactions with these two ligands at the correct phases of the elongation cycle? The Dontsova group used mutants of Helix 42 in <italic>E. coli</italic> to demonstrate that activation of EF-G may involve allosteric signaling from the peptidyltransferase center to the GAC, and that the difference between the EF-G and TC-binding sites may be due to differences in the positioning of the GAC relative to the SRL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">53</xref>). We subsequently proposed a complementary model suggesting that ribosomal protein L3 functions as the &#x02018;gatekeeper to the A-site&#x02019; within this scheme (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>). This model has been expanded and refined in the accompanying manuscript. These studies propose that L3 plays a role in coordinating the orderly binding of the elongation factors and peptidyltransferase activity by participating in a series of local allosteric changes in rRNA structure. Specifically we proposed that the &#x02018;open&#x02019; aa-tRNA accommodation corridor conformation defines the TC-binding site, while the &#x02018;closed&#x02019; conformation favors eEF2 binding. Examination of the atomic scale ribosome structures reveals that L10 lies on the opposite side of the accommodation corridor and PTC from L3 (e.g. see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>D), and data in the accompanying manuscript indicate that bases in H89 that interact with the N-terminal hook of L10 are involved in this process. The data from the current study closely complement those from our studies of L3, in particular with regard to coordination of elongation factor interactions. Specifically, in the Y9C mutant, hyperprotection of the Gate 1 bases (U2860 and U2923, <italic>E. coli</italic> U2492 and U2555), accompanied by increased affinity for eEF2 and decreased affinity for aa-tRNA is consistent with a &#x02018;closed&#x02019; accommodation corridor/eEF2-binding site. Conversely in the Y11C mutant, deprotection of U2861 (<italic>E. coli</italic> U2493) coupled with increased affinity for aa-tRNA and decreased affinity for eEF2 is consistent with the &#x02018;open&#x02019; corridor/TC-binding conformation. In addition, deprotection of G2777 (<italic>E. coli</italic> A2406) and enhanced in-line cleavage of C2775 (<italic>E. coli</italic> U2404) suggests that the &#x02018;E-site gate&#x02019;, through which deacylated tRNA passes on its way from the P-site to the E-site and out of the ribosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54 B55 B56 B57">54&#x02013;57</xref>), is also open in this mutant. The effects of these mutants on ribosome structure along the entire path traversed by tRNAs during the elongation cycle leads us to propose that L10 plays an important role in coordinating tRNA movement through the large subunit.</p></sec><sec><title>Anisomycin resistance/hypersensitivity and ribosome structure</title><p>The L10 mutants examined in the current study displayed a range of phenotypes related to anisomycin, ranging from strong drug resistance (R7L, R7P and Y9C) to hypersensitive (Y9H, Y9N and Y11C). Anisomycin resistance by ribosomal protein L3 mutants was previously proposed to be due to opening of the accommodation corridor, increasing diffusion rates of the relatively large aa-tRNA into the PTC relative to the much smaller drug (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>). This model cannot explain the observations made with the L10 mutants in the current study, where Y9C (corridor closed) is drug resistant while Y11C (corridor open) is hypersensitive. Two more-recent studies point to changes in the drug-binding site being responsible for anisomycin resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B58">58</xref>). Mutation of <italic>E. coli</italic> C2452 to U (yeast C2820U, <italic>H. marismortui</italic> 2487U) confers very strong anisomycin resistance. Chemical protection studies in the yeast mutant showed that anisomycin was unable to protect this base from chemical attack, suggesting that anisomycin cannot interact with a U at this position. The X-ray crystal structure of the analogous <italic>H. marismortui</italic> mutant confirmed this model. In the current study, we did not detect any changes in the sensitivity of this base to chemical modifying agents. However the increased sensitivity of the two 5&#x02032; adjacent bases (A2818 and A2819, <italic>E. coli</italic> A2450 and A2451) could account for the resistance of the Y9C mutant to this drug. This does not address the question of how Y11C, in which A2818 (<italic>E. coli</italic> A2450) is also deprotected, could be anisomycin hypersensitive. A potential answer might be gleaned from the anisomycin-resistant G2447C and G2447U <italic>H. marismortui</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B58">58</xref>). This base contacts anisomycin through a K<sup>+</sup>, and the two mutants cause drug resistance by altering the position of this ion. In yeast, the corresponding base is G2815; this base and its two 5&#x02032; neighbors are deprotected in the Y11C mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>). We suggest that this mutant may result in a change in this region of the anisomycin-binding pocket that confers increased affinity for anisomycin, resulting in drug hypersensitivity. This idea is supported by the increased affinity of Y11C for aa-tRNA, the 3&#x02032;end of which partially overlaps with the anisomycin-binding pocket.</p></sec><sec><title>Ribosome structure, translational fidelity and virus maintenance</title><p>Some of the L10 &#x02018;hook&#x02019; mutants had strong effects on termination codon recognition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>A). We speculate that this may be explained by open/closed nature of accommodation corridor. The closed conformation, e.g. Y9C, could decrease aa-tRNA accommodation rates, providing more time for ribosomes to reject suppressor tRNAs during the proofreading phase of translation elongation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B59">59</xref>). Conversely, the &#x02018;open&#x02019; mutants (Y11C, and perhaps R7L) may inhibit proofreading by allowing faster accommodation of incorrect tRNAs. Since &#x02013;1 PRF was at best only marginally affected by the mutants examined in the study, it is more likely that the killer virus maintenance defects of the L10 N-terminal &#x02018;hook&#x02019; mutants were due to their strong effects on 60S biogenesis as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>L10 and information flow through the ribosome</title><p>Inspection of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>D shows that L10 lies along a plane formed by Helix 38, Helix 39/L10, Helix 89, Helix 91 and Helix 95. This can be compared to five fingers, with L10 as a proteinaceous prosthesis of Helix 39. In addition, L10 interacts with the D-loop of 5S rRNA (data not shown). Why would nature select for a removable protein to occupy this space rather than simply extending Helix 39? Examination of its placement reveals that L10 is at the center of a topological nexus that interacts with: 5S rRNA, thus connecting it to the B1b and B1c intersubunit bridges at the crown of the large subunit; the GTPase-associated center, connecting it to elongation factor activation; the A-site finger (Helix 38), connecting it with the decoding center through the B1a bridge; and the peptidyltransferase center. We suggest that the information flow through this region of the large subunit is too complex to be monitored by a simple rRNA helix, thus necessitating the evolution of an informationally more complex molecule such as a protein to occupy this site. Thus, we suggest that L10 functions to collect, distribute and coordinate information throughout the large subunit.</p><p>The observed effects of the L10 mutants on ribosome structure and function could be explained consequent to 60S mis-assembly defects. This notion is supported by studies of the prokaryotic ortholog L16 showing that it is only important for late assembly steps but that it is not involved in other ribosomal functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B60">60</xref>). However, in support of our model, we note that if mis-assembly were the major issue, then the Y9C and Y11 C mutants would have displayed similar changes in chemical protection patterns. This was not the case. Instead, the chemical protection patterns observed with the Y9C mutants more closely resembled those observed for various mutants of ribosomal protein L3 [(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>) and accompanying manuscript], while those for the Y11C mutants more closely resembled those observed for mutants of Helix 38 and of the A-loop (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>), suggesting that the Y9C and Y11C mutants independently impact on two discrete physical pathways for information flow through the ribosome.</p><p>Lastly, is L10 involved in the process of ribosome ratcheting between the pre- and post-translocational states (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B61">61</xref>)? Comparison of the L10 (bacterial L16, archae L10e) N-terminal regions between seven different high-resolution ribosome structures suggest that it can assume two different conformations: interacting with Helix 89 or with Helix 38 (see <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkn643/DC1">Supplementary Figure</ext-link> 2). One possible interpretation of these comparisons is that the hook interacts with Helix 89 when the A-site is unoccupied (the post-translocation state), while it interacts with Helix 38 when the A-site is occupied (pre-translocation state). It is possible that the N-terminal &#x02018;hook&#x02019; of L10 may participate in this process through its interactions with the PTC proximal loop of Helix 89 (post-state) and Helix 38 (pre-state). By this model, interaction of the L10 hook with bases in the PTC-proximal bulge in Helix 89 may help to open the aa-tRNA accommodation corridor. Upon A-site tRNA occupancy, the L10 hook could flip up to interact with H38, releasing the H89 gate base to interact with its partner at the base of Helix 92, which is controlled through the L3 &#x02018;rocker switch&#x02019; (see accompanying manuscript by Meskauskas,A. and Dinman,J.D.). By this model then, the Y9C mutant would thermodynamically favor the closed conformation while Y11C would drive it toward the open state. Alternatively, it is possible that no such switch exists, and that the differences in the atomic resolution structures could be due to phylogenetic differences (eukaryotes and archae versus bacteria), or due to different crystallization conditions. The answers to these questions await the availability of high-resolution structures of eukaryotic ribosomes and of bacterial ribosomes complexed with EF-G.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>SUPPLEMENTARY DATA</title><p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkn643/DC1">Supplementary Data</ext-link> are available at NAR Online.</p></sec><sec><title>FUNDING</title><p><grant-sponsor>The National Institutes of Health</grant-sponsor> (<grant-num>GM058859</grant-num> to J.D.D.); the American Heart Association (AHA 0630163N to A.M.); and the Howard Hughes Medical Institute Undergraduate Science Education Program (to S.C.R. through the University of Maryland).
