This brings the total of contiguous sequence from the E. coli genome project to 500 kb (81.5 to 92.8 minutes). This segment contains 134 putative coding genes (ORFs) of which 66 genes were previously identified. Eight new genes--acs, pepE, and nrfB-G--were identified as well as the previously mapped gldA and alr genes. Still, 58 ORFs remain unidentified despite literature and similarity searches. The arrangement of proposed genes relative to possible promoters and terminators suggests 55 potential transcription units. Other features include 13 REP elements, one IRU (ERIC) repeat, 59 computer-predicted bends, 42 Chi sites and one new grey hole. Sixteen signal peptides were found, including those of lamB, btuB, and malE. Two ribosomal RNA loci, rrnB and rrnE, are located in this segment, so we have now sequenced four of the seven E. coli rRNA loci. Comparison of the rRNA loci reveals some differences in the ribosomal structural RNAs which are generally compatible with the proposed secondary structures.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><supplementary-material content-type="scanned-pages"><graphic xlink:href="nar00072-0129.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="5408"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00072-0130.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="5409"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00072-0131.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="5410"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00072-0132.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="5411"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00072-0133.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="5412"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00072-0134.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="5413"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00072-0135.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="5414"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00072-0136.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="5415"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00072-0137.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="5416"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00072-0138.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="5417"/></supplementary-material></body></article>
