This system is mainly associated to the translocation of large proteins such as adhesins to the outer membrane of several pathogens. <italic>Xanthomonas axonopodis</italic> pv. <italic>citri</italic> possess a filamentous hemagglutinin-like protein in close vicinity to its putative transporter protein, XacFhaB and XacFhaC, respectively. Expression analysis indicated that <italic>XacFhaB</italic> was induced <italic>in planta</italic> during plant-pathogen interaction. By mutation analysis of <italic>XacFhaB</italic> and <italic>XacFhaC</italic> genes we determined that <italic>XacFhaB</italic> is involved in virulence both in epiphytic and wound inoculations, displaying more dispersed and fewer canker lesions. Unexpectedly, the <italic>XacFhaC</italic> mutant in the transporter protein produced an intermediate virulence phenotype resembling wild type infection, suggesting that XacFhaB could be secreted by another partner different from XacFhaC. Moreover, <italic>XacFhaB</italic> mutants showed a general lack of adhesion and were affected in leaf surface attachment and biofilm formation. In agreement with the <italic>in planta</italic> phenotype, adhesin lacking cells moved faster in swarming plates. Since no hyperflagellation phenotype was observed in this bacteria, the faster movement may be attributed to the lack of cell-to-cell aggregation. Moreover, <italic>XacFhaB</italic> mutants secreted more exopolysaccharide that in turn may facilitate its motility. Our results suggest that this hemagglutinin-like protein is required for tissue colonization being mainly involved in surface attachment and biofilm formation, and that plant tissue attachment and cell-to-cell aggregation are dependent on the coordinated action of adhesin molecules and exopolysaccharides.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="13"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Protein secretion in gram-negative bacteria is accomplished by different pathways that are highly conserved in bacterial species. Among them, the type V secretion system stands out by its apparent simplicity and comprises two distinct pathways, the autotransporter and the two-partner secretion (TPS) pathways <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004358-Henderson1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>. Both, the autotransporter and TPS systems translocate large proteins or protein domains, mostly adhesins and hemolysins, and have been identified in many bacterial genera, including human, animal and plant pathogens. TPS systems are composed of two proteins, the transported protein named TpsA and the specific transporter TpsB that localizes in the outer membrane <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004358-JacobDubuisson1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>. TpsA proteins share a highly conserved N-proximal region of approximately 250 residues essential for secretion called the &#x02018;TPS domain&#x02019; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004358-JacobDubuisson2">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004358-Clantin1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref> that directs the secretion of the entire protein through the channel-forming outer membrane porin-like protein TpsB <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004358-JacobDubuisson1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>The well studied filamentous hemagglutinin (FHA) protein of the whooping cough agent <italic>Bordetella pertussis</italic> is a 230-kDa adhesin, named FhaB, is secreted by the other TPS partner FhaC, standing for TpsA and TpsB, respectively <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004358-JacobDubuisson3">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>. FhaB, as well as the other proteins secreted by the TPS pathway, contains the characteristic TPS domain in its N-proximal region whose structure has been determined. The domain core is folded into a right-handed parallel &#x003b2;-helix of nine coils that comprises three helical &#x003b2;&#x02013;sheets <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004358-Clantin1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>. Sequence comparison of this domain from different animal and plant pathogens revealed two conserved regions (C) and two less conserved regions (LC) in an alternating organization LC1&#x02013;C1&#x02013;LC2&#x02013;C2 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004358-Clantin1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>. Since crystallographic analysis of the complete mature protein has not been possible due to the large size of FhaB, a truncated variant has been studied by electron microscopy. The results suggested that the most likely model for the mature protein would be that of an elongated &#x003b2;-helix in which the &#x003b2;-helical fold continues beyond the TPS domain <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004358-Kajava1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Bacterial attachment is a crucial early step in pathogenesis. Specialized surface exposed proteins called adhesins mediate bacterial adhesion to accomplish this critical step. Numerous studies on adhesins from animal bacterial pathogens have indicated that they are required for optimal virulence. In plant pathogens the role of these proteins in virulence is less clear since it has been not analyzed in detail. A mutant in a gene codifying for the 3,850-aa protein homolog to FhaB from <italic>B. pertussis</italic> in <italic>Erwinia chrysanthemi</italic>, a pathogen that causes soft-rot on a wide variety of plants reduces its ability to attach to and form aggregates on <italic>Nicotiana clevelandii</italic> leaves thus reducing virulence <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004358-Rojas1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>. In another study the role of hemagglutinin genes from <italic>Xylella fastidiosa</italic>, the causal agent of several diseases in e.g. citrus, grape and peach was investigated. Random mutations of <italic>X. fastidiosa</italic> that produce hypervirulent strains with more severe symptoms and earlier grapevine death show an insertion in a hemagglutinin codifying gene. These results suggest that hemagglutinins mediate contact between bacterial cells impairing <italic>X. fastidiosa</italic> movement in the plant xylem and thus reducing virulence <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004358-Guilhabert1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p><italic>Xanthomonas axonopodis</italic> pv. <italic>citri</italic> is the phytopathogen that causes citrus canker. The disease appears as raised necrotic corky lesions in leaves, stems and fruits reducing fruit quality and quantity. The pathogen enters host plant tissues through stomata and wounds and infection is visualized as circular spots on the abaxial surface of leaves. Subsequently the bacteria colonize the apoplast causing the leaf epidermis to break due to cell hyperplasia <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004358-Brunings1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004358-Graham1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>. The complete bacterial genome has been sequenced <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004358-daSilva1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref> and reveals a number of genes most likely involved in virulence. Among them, we have previously characterized the role of the type III secretion system <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004358-Dunger1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>, the exopolysaccharide xanthan <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004358-Dunger2">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>, and a plant natriuretic peptide-like molecule <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004358-Gottig1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref> in pathogenicity. <italic>X. axonopodis</italic> pv. <italic>citri</italic> has several types of protein secretion systems and besides a type I, two type II, one type III and one type IV secretion systems <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004358-Moreira1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004358-VanSluys1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>, the phytopathogen bears at least one homolog to a TPS type V secretion system that may be involved in a FhaB-like hemagglutinin secretion.

GenBank comparisons of XacFhaB revealed amino acid homology with putative adhesins of the hemagglutinin type represented by the FhaB from <italic>B. pertussis</italic> present in different plant and animal pathogens. Based on predicted amino acid homology and secondary structure, the gene found upstream of <italic>XacFhaB</italic> termed <italic>XacFhaC</italic> (XAC1814) encodes a putative TpsB secretion partner of XacFhaB protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004358-g001">Figure 1A</xref>).

An alignment of these proteins and XacFhaB revealed that they encode disrupted proteins with an identity of 83&#x00025; and 89&#x00025; to the C-terminal end of XacFhaB. The absence of the N-terminal ends that include the TPS domain in Xac1816 and Xac1818 suggest that they are non-functional copies of the XacFhaB protein. Like other hemagglutinin proteins, XacFhaB has a signal peptide (predicted by SignalP: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/SignalP/">www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/SignalP/</ext-link>) that is followed by a conserved TPS domain.

The genomic arrangement of <italic>XacFhaB</italic> and <italic>XacFhaC</italic> points to a situation where downstream genes of <italic>XacFhaB</italic> have disrupted sequences probably preventing the making of functional proteins. Besides, upstream genes of <italic>XacFhaC</italic> are in opposite transcription orientation. As the mutants were generated by double recombination and each possesses a putative promoter sequence, it is unlikely that the phenotypes associated with the mutation of these genes are due to a polar effect. Accordingly, &#x00394;<italic>XacFhaC</italic> has a different infection phenotype compared to &#x00394;<italic>XacFhaB</italic> (see below). The virulence of these mutants was examined on the host plant <italic>C. sinensis</italic> using different inoculation methods. Upon pressure infiltration at a concentration &#x02265;10<sup>7</sup> cfu/ml, &#x00394;<italic>XacFhaB</italic>, &#x00394;<italic>XacFhaC</italic> and wild type bacteria induced similar disease symptoms and no differences were observed in the time of onset of lesion formation or lesion size (data not shown). However, when these bacteria were infiltrated at lower concentrations (10<sup>5</sup> and 10<sup>6</sup> cfu/ml) despite the fact that the infiltrated areas were similar, canker lesions (brown spots in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004358-g002">Figure 2B</xref>) produced by &#x00394;<italic>XacFhaB</italic> appeared in a more expanded manner than typical lesions observed with &#x00394;<italic>XacFhaC</italic> or wild type bacteria (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004358-g002">Figure 2B, left leaf</xref>). At lower bacterial concentration, 10<sup>4</sup> cfu/ml, the virulence of &#x00394;<italic>XacFhaB</italic> strain was strongly affected and produced a lesser number of canker lesions than the other strains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004358-g002">Figure 2B, right leaf</xref>).</p><p>To evaluate the role of XacFhaB in bacterial growth in the host, populations of <italic>XacFhaB</italic> and <italic>XacFhaC</italic> mutants and the wild type bacteria were quantified in orange leaves (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004358-g002">Figure 2C</xref>). The results showed that at all times tested bacterial number of &#x00394;<italic>XacFhaB</italic> recovered from the infected leaves was significantly lower than those of the wild type while no significant differences between the growth of the &#x00394;<italic>XacFhaC</italic> and the wild type bacteria were observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004358-g002">Figure 2C</xref>). The reduced bacterial number recovered from &#x00394;<italic>XacFhaB</italic> infections was particularly larger after 3 days post-inoculation and may be explained by the fact that bacterial growth <italic>in planta</italic> requires <italic>FhaB</italic> expression and its absence may delay host colonization. Consistent with this, <italic>XacFhaB</italic> expression in wild type bacteria recovered from infected leaves was induced after this time and hardly detected before (see above).</p><p>The virulence of these strains was also determined after spraying them on leaves surfaces, a method that resembles the natural infection. After one month post inoculation the number of cankers on leaves infected with wild type bacteria was 3.2 and 1.7 times larger than that inoculated with &#x00394;<italic>XacFhaB</italic> and &#x00394;<italic>XacFhaC</italic> strains respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004358-g002">Figure 2D</xref>).</p><p>We also analyzed the epiphytic fitness of <italic>XacFhaB</italic> and <italic>XacFhaC</italic> deletion mutants compared to wild type bacteria and observed significant differences.

Collectively these findings suggest that XacFhaB has an important role in <italic>X. axonopodis</italic> pv. <italic>citri</italic> virulence and that this protein might be transported by XacFhaC, because of the intermediate infection phenotypes observed in &#x00394;<italic>XacFhaC</italic> infiltrations we could speculate that another partner different from XacFhaC is involved in XacFhaB secretion.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Influence of XacFhaB on cell attachment to different surfaces</title><p>Having established that XacFhaB is necessary for <italic>X. axonopodis</italic> pv. <italic>citri</italic> virulence in citrus leaves, we next analyzed at which of the different stages of the pathogenic process XacFhaB might be involved.

Solubilization of the CV stain by addition of ethanol provides an indirect, quantitative measurement of the adherent cell mass in a given well <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004358-Herzberg1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>. The data obtained showed that the wild type strain adheres proficiently in XVM2 medium but not in SB medium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004358-g003">Figure 3A, left side</xref>). In SB medium the CV quantifications were similar to the negative buffer control (data not shown). In XVM2 medium &#x00394;<italic>XacFhaC</italic> adhered slightly less well than the wild type, with a 1.5 fold lower levels of CV stain retained (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004358-g003">Figure 3A, right side</xref>). In contrast, the &#x00394;<italic>XacFhaB</italic> strain retained only basal levels of CV, similar to the negative buffer control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004358-g003">Figure 3A</xref>). A similar assay was performed on the abaxial surface of orange leaves (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004358-g003">Figure 3B</xref>), and similar to what occurred on PVC surface, wild type and &#x00394;<italic>XacFhaC</italic> strains attached to the leaves only if they were cultured in XVM2 medium, but &#x00394;<italic>XacFhaC</italic> showed 1.5 fold lower CV retention. Furthermore, &#x00394;<italic>XacFhaB</italic> again showed absence of adherence, indicating a general lack of adhesion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004358-g003">Figure 3B</xref>). As a consequence of the large size of <italic>XacFhaB</italic> gene we could not complement &#x00394;<italic>XacFhaB</italic> deletion mutant, although we could partially revert the lack of adherence of this mutant in co-incubations with filtrated supernatants of wild type bacteria grown in XVM2 or with suspensions of the latter cultured in XVM2. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004358-g003">Figure 3C</xref> shows that the adherence of &#x00394;<italic>XacFhaB</italic> mutant to orange leaves co-incubated with the wild type bacterial supernatant reversed the lack of attachment of mutant cells (C1 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004358-g003">Figure 3C</xref>), suggesting that the XacFhaB protein secreted by the wild type strain contributed to the attachment of the mutant cells to orange leaves. Moreover, in the co-incubation of mutant and wild type bacteria previously washed to remove the respective culture medium (1&#x02236;1, being the total number of cells the same as in the XacWT) almost the same level of CV staining as with the wild type was observed, suggesting that mutant attachment to leaves was produced due to the presence of XacFhaB in wild type cells (C2 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004358-g003">Figure 3C</xref>). As a demonstration that this reversion was a result of the presence of an extracellular protein, the co-incubations C1 and C2 were treated with proteinase K (PK) before the inoculation of leaf surfaces. Under this regime PK prevented the attachment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004358-g003">Figure 3C</xref>). In all cases, analysis of the number of attached cells to leaf surfaces showed similar results to the CV stain (data not shown).

Moreover, the number of bacterial cells recovered from the leaf apoplast was less than in the wild type infection and epiphytic survival was also impaired in the &#x00394;<italic>XacFhaB</italic> strain.

These differences may be attributed to the fact that XacFhaB could be secreted by another partner different from XacFhaC. In human and animal pathogens TpsB transporters appear to be specific for their respective TpsA partners and the encoding genes localized adjacent to each other <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004358-JacobDubuisson4">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref>.

Since the absence of XacFhaB and higher EPS levels may favour bacterial motility we suggest that <italic>XacFhaB</italic> mutant may not need to be hyperflagellated. Studies in <italic>Salmonella typhimurium</italic> on swarm agar plates show a down-regulation of flagellar genes activated by a feedback mechanism in which the flagellar filament itself is a sensor for unfavorable external conditions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004358-Wang1">&#x0005b;31&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Several of the studies performed in this work, in particular biofilm formation, swarming motility, flagella and EPS production, and <italic>gumD</italic> expression were analyzed in bacteria grown in rich medium. In the case of biofilm formation we observed the same lack of aggregation for &#x00394;<italic>XacFhaB</italic> cells in experiments performed in SB or XVM2. In swarming motility assays, differences among strains were observed in rich medium while in minimal medium only &#x00394;<italic>XacFhaB</italic> advanced slightly. Examination of flagella was performed on cells obtained from SB plates in which the motility could be quantified. By contrast neither EPS production nor <italic>gumD</italic> expression could be observed in bacteria grown in XVM2. The absence of <italic>gumD</italic> expression in XVM2 could account for the less structured biofilm and for the lack of movement observed for the wild type bacteria in this medium. How could these results be obtained in rich medium in which FhaB has an active role if <italic>FhaB</italic> expression can not be detected in bacteria grown in it? We propose that the lack of <italic>FhaB</italic> expression in liquid SB cultures at exponential phase may not be representative for all growth condition in this medium and in the case of biofilm formation we suggest that after 2 weeks of growth at static incubation, bacteria reach a population density that may trigger the expression of the gene. Similarly, in the semi-solid agar plates, adhesin expression in wild type cells could be taking place as bacteria have to remain attached to each other in this type of growth.</p><p>Bacterial cell-to-cell aggregation may be critical for the interaction with the plant. In this particular plant-pathogen interaction in which the bacteria causes a local disease, <italic>X. axonopodis</italic> pv. <italic>citri FhaB</italic> mutant showed more expanded lesions suggesting that XacFhaB is required to confine the bacteria within a small radius near the initial site of infection. The lack of adhesion between cells was also observed in <italic>X. fastidiosa</italic> mutants in hemagglutinin genes, but in this latter case the phytopathogen showed increased virulence. This may be attributed to the fact that <italic>X. fastidiosa</italic> colonizes grape xylem vessel resulting in a systemic disease, and thus the lack of hemagglutinin proteins may well favor bacterial movement and colonization of vascular tissue <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004358-Guilhabert1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>. A more recent report suggests that movement and multiplication of <italic>X. fastidiosa</italic> in plants are linked, perhaps because cell wall degradation products are the major source of nutrients and cell-to-cell interaction which restricts movement and colonization of <italic>X. fastidiosa</italic> may be an adaptation to endophytic growth of the pathogen that prevents the excessive growth of cells in vessels <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004358-Chatterjee1">&#x0005b;32&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Biofilms are matrix-enclosed bacterial populations that adhere to each other, surfaces or interfaces. A key aspect of biofilm formation is the production of the extracellular matrix. In bacteria like Pseudomonas, this matrix is thought to be comprised of EPS, DNA, and proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004358-Klausen1">&#x0005b;33&#x0005d;</xref>. The main proteins identified in this matrix were alpha-hemolysin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004358-Caiazza1">&#x0005b;34&#x0005d;</xref> and adhesin proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004358-Hinsa1">&#x0005b;35&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004358-Hinsa2">&#x0005b;36&#x0005d;</xref>. Accordingly, in a microarray analysis of genes being expressed in <italic>X. fastidiosa</italic> cells growing in a biofilm compared to planktonic cells, de Souza et al. identified genes that encode hemagglutinin-like secreted proteins, supporting the idea that proteins involved in adhesion to surfaces are implicated in biofilm formation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004358-deSouza1">&#x0005b;37&#x0005d;</xref>. We observed that <italic>X. axonopodis</italic> pv. <italic>citri</italic> mutant in hemagglutinin-like protein, that overproduces xanthan, hindered biofilm formation suggesting that EPS can not be the only one responsible for biofilm formation and that XacFhaB adhesin is also essential for this process. The higher amount of xanthan produced by this mutant may be explained by a mechanism of compensation for the lack of adherence, though it is not enough by itself to promote the formation of the biofilm, suggesting that the xanthan required for biofilm formation may be maintained in the extracellular matrix in an adhesin-dependent manner. Biofilm formation and swarming motility are both surface-associated types of behavior and bacteria must be capable of alternating from one behavior to the other. &#x000d3;Toole and collaborators have established the mechanisms that co-regulate and inversely control swarming and biofilm formation in <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004358-Caiazza2">&#x0005b;38&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004358-Merritt1">&#x0005b;40&#x0005d;</xref>. These authors proposed that the proteins involved in such regulation are SadC and BifA, a diguanylate cyclase and cyclic-di-GMP phosphodiesterase, respectively and that they function together to modulate the levels of c-di-GMP in the cell. The resulting levels of this molecule impact on both EPS production and flagellar function and thus biofilm formation and swarming motility. Increased levels of c-di-GMP are usually correlated with increased exopolysaccharide production and increased biofilm formation, whereas lower levels of c-di-GMP are seen to increase motility. The same group also demonstrated that c-di-GMP levels that are lowered in a phosphate limiting environment, regulate secretion of the adhesin LapA required for biofilm formation by <italic>Pseudomonas fluorescens</italic> and further extended the biological roles of c-di-GMP beyond regulation of exopolysaccharide production and motility <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004358-Monds1">&#x0005b;41&#x0005d;</xref>. Our results suggest that in <italic>X. axonopodis</italic> pv. <italic>citri</italic> the action of XacFhaB adhesin is causing reduced bacterial migration favouring biofilm formation, and since several proteins involved in regulating c-di-GMP levels are codified in the citrus pathogen genome we may speculate that they could also coordinate adhesin and EPS mediated attachment, modulating <italic>X. axonopodis</italic> pv. <italic>citri</italic> biofilm formation and swarming motility and thus its lifestyle. Another regulatory mechanism proposed by Lindow and collaborators implies that adhesin proteins expression could be regulated by the two-component signaling system Rpf that also coordinates the expression of virulence genes such as the ones involved in EPS production <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004358-Chatterjee1">&#x0005b;32&#x0005d;</xref>. The higher amount of EPS observed in <italic>XacFhaB</italic> mutants may be attributed to the adaptation of this regulatory pathway.

For the swimming assays, bacterial cultures grown overnight in SB at 28&#x000b0;C were centrifuged and resuspended in PBS at the same OD<sub>600</sub>, 200 &#x000b5;l of each suspension were centrifuged and the pellets resuspended in protein sample buffer. This was done in order to obtain the same amount of protein in all the samples analyzed. For the swarming analysis, cells were sampled from the center or from the border of the colony of swarming plates (SB-0.7&#x00025; agar) and bacteria were recovered with PBS and standardized as described above for liquid culture bacteria. Equal volumes (20 &#x000b5;l) of these whole-cell extracts were loaded onto 12&#x00025; SDS-PAGE gels and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. Flagella were stained according to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004358-Kodaka1">&#x0005b;49&#x0005d;</xref>. Stain was prepared by mixing 10 parts mordant (2 g tannic acid, 10 ml 5&#x00025; phenol, 10 ml saturated aqueous AlKO<sub>8</sub>S<sub>2</sub>.12 H<sub>2</sub>O) with 1 part stain (12&#x00025; crystal violet in ethanol). Bacteria were recovered from the center or the border of swarm plates with PBS and 20 &#x000b5;l of the suspensions were applied to a microscope slide and covered with a coverslip. The slide was propped vertically and 50 &#x000b5;l of dye was applied to the top edge of the coverslip to stain the sample by capillary action. Samples were observed with phase contrast using a Nikon Eclipse E800 microscope.</p></sec><sec id="s4k"><title>Quantification of xanthan production</title><p>The quantification of xanthan production was done as described previously <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004358-Becker1">&#x0005b;50&#x0005d;</xref>.
