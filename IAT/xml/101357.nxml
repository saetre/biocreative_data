Two isoforms of 5&#x003b1;-R have been identified. While these isoforms catalyze the same reaction, they possess different biochemical and pharmacological properties, and display distinct expression patterns in tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf228c4">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf228c7">7</xref>). Type I (5&#x003b1;-R1) is widely distributed throughout the body, and is most abundant in the liver where it catabolizes steroids. Type II (5&#x003b1;-R2) is primarily expressed in target tissues for androgens, such as the prostate and seminal vesicles, and is responsible for converting testosterone into dihydrotestosterone (DHT), a potent natural androgen. Impaired 5&#x003b1;-R2 activity caused by mutations in the human 5&#x003b1;-R2 gene results in insufficient DHT production, leading to male pseudohermaphroditism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf228c5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf228c8">8</xref>). Recently, it was found that 5&#x003b1;-R2 was expressed in male rat brains at detectable levels after testosterone was given. This raised the possibility that the testosterone-induced up-regulation of 5&#x003b1;-R2 gene expression and resultant enhanced production of DHT was important for mediating the male sexual behavior and aggression that occurred during a very critical period (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf228c9">9</xref>). In contrast, the physiological role of 5&#x003b1;-R2 in the female brain remains largely unknown.</p><p>5&#x003b1;-R2 is also known to metabolize progesterone into dihydroprogesterone (DHP), and DHP is further converted into allopregnanolene (AP) by 3&#x003b1;-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (3&#x003b1;-HSD) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf228c10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf228c11">11</xref>). AP is thought to exert anti-convulsant and anxiolytic-like actions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf228c12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf228c13">13</xref>) by binding to allosteric sites on neurotransmitter-gated ion channels, such as the &#x003b3;-amino butyric acid type A (GABA<sub>A</sub>) receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf228c14">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf228c16">16</xref>). When brain progesterone and AP levels are increased during pregnancy or transient stress, expression of genes for GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor inhibitory subunits &#x003b1;4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf228c17">17</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf228c20">20</xref>) were shown to be down-regulated, possibly resulting in the potentiation of AP action through enhanced GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor function. Nonetheless, there is little information concerning the effects of progesterone on 5&#x003b1;-R2 gene expression in the female brain.</p><p>Androgens and progesterone are believed to mediate their effects through the transcriptional control of specific sets of target genes via nuclear receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf228c21">21</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf228c23">23</xref>). Androgen receptor (AR) and progesterone receptor (PR) are members of the nuclear receptor superfamily, and act as hormone-inducible transcription factors that bind specific DNA elements as homodimers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf228c24">24</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf228c28">28</xref>). The DNA elements that bind AR and PR share the common sequence 5&#x02032;-AGAACANNNTGTTCT-3&#x02032;, known as the consensus progesterone&#x0002f;androgen response element (PRE&#x0002f;ARE) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf228c29">29</xref>). As both hormone receptors recognize the same sequence, it is likely that the same genes are regulated when either AR or PR are present in a given tissue or cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf228c30">30</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf228c33">33</xref>). Therefore, the fact that the transcriptional control of 5&#x003b1;-R2 is regulated by the DHT&#x02013;AR system in the male brain raises the possibility that progesterone may act as a positive regulator for 5&#x003b1;-R2 gene expression in the female brain.</p><p>To test this hypothesis, the present study was undertaken to examine 5&#x003b1;-R2 gene expression in female mice. First, the cDNA of mouse 5&#x003b1;-R2 (m5&#x003b1;-R2) was amplified by degenerate PCR and cloned. The 5&#x003b1;-R2 gene expression was induced by the treatment of either progesterone or androgen in female mouse brains. <italic>In situ</italic> analyses of female brains detected the 5&#x003b1;-R2 transcript in the hippocampus of the mice treated with progesterone. Furthermore, the putative PRE&#x0002f;ARE was identified in the m5&#x003b1;-R2 gene promoter. Thus, our results suggested that the progesterone-induced expression of 5&#x003b1;-R2 promoted AP production in the female brain.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>RNA isolation and molecular cloning of 5&#x003b1;-R2 cDNA in the mouse kidney</title><p>Total RNA was isolated from kidneys of 10-week-old female mice (ICR CD1; Charles River Laboratories, Inc.) using isogen solution (Nippongene) and reverse transcribed using an oligo(dT)<sub>18</sub> primer and SuperScript II reverse transcriptase (Life Technologies, Inc.).

In the present study, the ability of m5&#x003b1;-R2 to metabolize androgen and progesterone was assessed with respect to the ligand-induced transactivation functions of AR and PR. While AR transactivation function was clearly induced by DHT, only a slight induction by testosterone was seen (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf228f2">2</xref>A). The expression of m5&#x003b1;-R2 led to a 2-fold increase in testosterone-induced AR transactivation function (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf228f2">2</xref>A, compare lanes 4 and 10). However, a putative inactivation mutant of m5&#x003b1;-R2 (G34R) failed to potentiate testosterone-induced AR transactivation function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf228c34">34</xref>). Thus, our results suggested that the enzymatic conversion of testosterone into DHT was mediated by m5&#x003b1;-R2.

RT&#x02013;PCR (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf228f3">3</xref>B) and northern blotting analyses confirmed the induction of the m5&#x003b1;-R2 gene in female brains by progesterone, while androgen induced the m5&#x003b1;-R2 gene in the male brain (data not shown) as expected from previous reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf228c9">9</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Isolation of the 5&#x02032;-flanking region of the m5&#x003b1;-R2 gene and identification of the transcription initiation site</title><p>To address whether m5&#x003b1;-R2 gene induction in female brains by progesterone involved transcriptional or post-transcriptional mechanisms, we directly assessed the promoter function of the m5&#x003b1;-R2 gene. We first isolated the 5&#x02032;-flanking region of the 5&#x003b1;-R2 by inverse-PCR using primers that corresponded to the exon 1 sequence, and a genomic fragment 780 bp upstream of the putative translation start site (ATG codon) was cloned (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf228f4">4</xref>A) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf228c41">41</xref>). Using this cloned genomic fragment, the transcription start site was determined by the primer extension method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf228c38">38</xref>). Results indicated that the start site was located 89 bp upstream of the ORF, with a TATA box 30 bp upstream (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf228f4">4</xref>A and B). A sequence closely related to the consensus PRE&#x0002f;ARE sequence (designated as m5&#x003b1;-R2 PRE&#x0002f;ARE hereafter) was present 657 bp upstream of the transcription start site, indicating possible regulation by progesterone and androgen via this element.</p></sec><sec><title>Identification of a progesterone&#x0002f;audrogen response element (PRE&#x0002f;ARE) in the m5&#x003b1;-R2 gene promoter</title><p>We then tested the function of the PRE&#x0002f;ARE-like sequence of m5&#x003b1;-R2 using a transient expression assay with expression vectors for PR and AR in COS-1 cells, and luciferase reporter plasmids bearing a series of the deletion mutants of the m5&#x003b1;-R2 gene promoter (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf228f4">4</xref>A). Promoters with the intact m5&#x003b1;-R2 PRE&#x0002f;ARE conferred both androgen- and progesterone-specific responses in the presence of cognate receptor. However, deletion of m5&#x003b1;-R2 PRE&#x0002f;ARE caused complete loss of responsiveness to progesterone and androgen without reduction of basal m5&#x003b1;-R2 gene promoter activity (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf228f5">5</xref>A). Like consensus PRE&#x0002f;ARE, m5&#x003b1;-R2 PRE&#x0002f;ARE conferred responsiveness to both hormones even when driven by the basal thymidine kinase (tk) promoter (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf228f5">5</xref>B).</p><p>We then examined whether AR or PR homodimers directly bound to the identified m5&#x003b1;-R2 PRE&#x0002f;ARE. An EMSA was performed using the consensus PRE&#x0002f;ARE prepared for the transient expression assay (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf228f5">5</xref>B) as a positive control. As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf228f6">6</xref>, both AR and PR effectively bound both consensus and m5&#x003b1;-R2 PRE&#x0002f;ARE sequences (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf228f6">6</xref>, lanes 2 and 5; 9 and 12). Moreover, in the presence of excess cold consensus PRE&#x0002f;ARE DNA, AR and PR binding was abolished (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf228f6">6</xref>, lanes 3 and 6; 10 and 13). Thus, taken together, our results suggested that both hormone-bound steroid receptors controlled m5&#x003b1;-R2 gene transcription through m5&#x003b1;-R2 PRE&#x0002f;ARE.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>To clarify the physiological roles of 5&#x003b1;-R2 in the activity of hormonal and neuroactive steroids in the brain, we studied the possible regulation of m5&#x003b1;-R2 gene expression by one of its enzymatic substrates, progesterone. We first cloned the m5&#x003b1;-R2 cDNA by degenerate PCR, and found that recombinant m5&#x003b1;-R2 protein expressed in cultured cells metabolized progesterone and androgen as shown using a nuclear receptor-mediated assay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf228c35">35</xref>). Using the cDNA clone as an <italic>in situ</italic> hybridization probe, we found that m5&#x003b1;-R2 gene expression was undetectable in the female brain, but was induced up to detectable levels in the hippocampus of female mice by progesterone. A progesterone regulatory element was identified as a highly related sequence to the consensus PRE&#x0002f;ARE sequence in the m5&#x003b1;-R2 promoter, and this element, m5&#x003b1;-R2 PRE&#x0002f;ARE, was found to confer responsiveness to both progesterone and androgen, similar to consensus PRE&#x0002f;ARE. Thus, transcriptional control of m5&#x003b1;-R2 gene expression by progesterone and androgen appeared to be mediated through m5&#x003b1;-R2 PRE&#x0002f;ARE.</p><p>Neuroactive steroids, like AP, are thought to exert behavioral effects such as convulsant and anxiolytic-like actions through the modulation of neurotransmitter-gated iron channel functions through direct binding of their allosteric sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf228c43">43</xref>). The effects of neuroactive steroids, especially progesterone derivatives, appear to be more prominent in females with premenstrual syndrome (PMS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf228c18">18</xref>) or under transient stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf228c44">44</xref>). Lowered serum progesterone levels may lead to PMS due to insufficient production of neuroactive steroids in the female brain. In contrast, enhanced production of progesterone during pregnancy is thought to promote the production of neuroactive steroids. As 5&#x003b1;-R2 converts progesterone into DHP, the precursor of AP, 5&#x003b1;-R2 enzymatic activity in the female brain is likely to be physiologically important for the action of neuroactive steroids. The significant induction of m5&#x003b1;-R2 by progesterone in female brains was detected only in the hippocampus. Therefore, the physiological role of 5&#x003b1;-R2 in the hippocampus needs to be verified by specific disruption of the 5&#x003b1;-R2 gene in the hippocampus in further animal experiments.</p><p>The promoter of the m5&#x003b1;-R2 gene harbored several potential binding sites for distinct classes of transcription regulatory factors in addition to PR&#x0002f;AR. Among these, the presence of two SRY binding sites raises the possibility that m5&#x003b1;-R2 gene expression is induced to convert testosterone into the more active form DHT during embryogenesis to develop male reproductive organs, when SRY plays a critical role in sex determination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf228c45">45</xref>). Moreover, due to the identification of a PRE&#x0002f;ARE in the m5&#x003b1;-R2 gene promoter presented in this study, it is possible that positive feedback regulation of m5&#x003b1;-R2 gene expression by androgen occurs during male reproductive organ development and may occur in adult males to maintain reproductive organ function. Indeed, genetic mutations in 5&#x003b1;-R2 that impair its enzymatic activity are known to cause the hereditary disease male pseudohermaphroditism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf228c5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf228c8">8</xref>), clearly indicating the indispensability of this enzyme in males. However, the physiological role of 5&#x003b1;-R2 in females remains to be examined in more detail during embryogenesis and in adulthood.</p></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="display-objects"><title>Figures and Tables</title><fig id="gkf228f1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p> Molecular cloning of m5&#x003b1;-R2 cDNA.
