Recent analysis of lamprey and dogshark median fins suggests the co-option of some molecular mechanisms between paired and median in Chondrichthyes. However, the extent to which the molecular mechanisms patterning paired and median fins are shared remains unknown.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Here we provide molecular description of the initial ontogeny of the median fins in zebrafish and present several independent lines of evidence that Sonic hedgehog signaling emanating from the embryonic midline is essential for establishment and outgrowth of the caudal fin primordium.

The median fins evolved before paired fins in early craniates, thus the patterning of the median fins may be an ancestral mechanism that controls the outgrowth of skeletogenic appendages in vertebrates.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>Living primitive chordates like <italic>Branchiostoma </italic>and the agnathan hagfishes have a very simple, non-differentiated caudal fin fringe, whereas lampreys are characterized by separate and differentiated caudal and dorsal median fins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Recent analyses concur that the fossil jawless vertebrates ("ostracoderms"), which have differentiated median fins and either no or one pair (pectoral) fins, form the stem group of the Gnathostomata. This phylogenetic pattern implies that median fins appeared before paired fins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. The mechanisms patterning median fins may be ancestral to those used by the paired fins and limbs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Gnathostomes primitively have paired pectoral and pelvic fins, as well as unpaired caudal, anal and at least one dorsal fin, which together is the ancestral morphology well matched by zebrafish [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>].</p><p>The development of paired appendages such as wings, fins and limbs has been intensively studied and many details about the underlying molecular mechanisms are known (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]). For instance, the signaling molecule Sonic hedgehog (Shh) is a morphogen [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>] that emanates from the zone of polarizing activity (ZPA), a domain of cells positioned at the base of the outgrowing paired fin and limb buds [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. Shh expressing cells can mimic the activity of the ZPA and can lead to mirror image duplications of appendages. Thus, Shh is the factor responsible for the patterning activity of the ZPA (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]). Recently, it has been established that the main function of Shh in the ZPA is to counteract the repressing activity of Gli3 thus demonstrating an antagonistic hierarchy in establishing antero-posterior patterning of limbs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>].</p><p>In contrast to the mechanisms underlying the development of paired appendages, very little is known about the formation of median fins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. In teleosts, the median fins develop from the embryonic fin folds [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>] by expansion of the mesenchyme underlying the ectodermal layer of the embryonic fin fold [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. It has been suggested that the processes of embryonic fin fold and adult median fin formation involve independent genetic mechanisms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. The fin fold mesenchyme is the source of both the endoskeletal and exoskeletal structures of the adult caudal fin and has been suggested to receive contribution from trunk neural crest [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. Recently, the origin of median fin primordial cells was investigated in dogshark and lampreys and the authors concluded that median fin cells are primarily of somitic origin with some contribution from neural crest [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. Furthermore, regionalization of <italic>Hox </italic>and <italic>Tbx18 </italic>gene expression in median fin buds was demonstrated in the same study and thus indicated that common molecular mechanisms are utilized by median and paired fins. For example, <italic>hoxb8a </italic>was implicated as an important factor in the outgrowth of the caudal fin of medaka (Oryzias latipes) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>].</p><p>The lack of appropriate marker genes to follow the initial development and patterning of median fin primordium together with the late, post-embryonic ontogeny of median fins in Osteichthyes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>] prevents genetic analysis in mutants affecting paired fin development in zebrafish because they are mostly embryonic lethal [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>] and die before tail fin morphology can be studied. In particular, a problem which has not yet been possible to address due to the early lethal nature of Hh pathway mutants in zebrafish is whether Hh signaling would have a role in patterning the median fin primordium.</p><p>In this report we describe a molecular marker for the earliest phase of adult caudal fin primordium development in zebrafish, which facilitates the detection of median fin precursor cells as early as 1.5 days post fertilization. We provide several lines of evidence, which indicate a crucial role for Hh signaling in the patterning of the caudal fin endoskeletal primordium without detecting a sonic hedgehog secreting zone of polarizing activity.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>To address the role of key signaling mechanisms in median fin patterning appropriate marker genes are required for labeling the median fin primordia. In the lack of marker genes for the earliest events in median fin formation we have exploited a GFP transgenic zebrafish line. As part of a study of floor plate and notochord-specific regulatory elements of <italic>shh </italic>we have generated one stable transgenic zebrafish line that expresses <italic>green fluorescent protein (gfp) </italic>ectopically in the primordia of the median fins from a very early stage of development (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>) as a result of a position of integration effect (see Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A&#x02013;D</xref>). The expression of this transgene reporter marks a small group of cells in the embryonic fin fold mesenchyme ventral to the caudal end of the notochord as early as 36 hours post fertilization (hpf) (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B, H</xref>). The GFP activity gradually expands in a radial manner, generating an expression domain, which strikingly overlaps with the gap in the melanophore streak appearing in the fin fold mesenchyme at 72 hpf (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C, I, J</xref>). By 7 days post fertilization (dpf), the GFP domain develops into a fan-shape and a new symmetry plane emerges, which splits it into two distinct anterior and posterior regions (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1E</xref>, also see time lapse animation in Additional file Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">S1</xref>). These expression domains correspond to the future dorsal and ventral lobes of the caudal fin after the subsequent bending of the body axis dorsally (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1F, G</xref> and see time lapse movie in Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">S1</xref>) and thus represent a molecular correlate of one of the key morphological specializations of the teleosts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. The GFP expression further subdivides at around 9 dpf resulting in a stronger proximal and a late developing weaker distal activity (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1F, G</xref> arrows and arrowheads, respectively). The transgene expression in the proximal domain of the median fin primordia is the consequence of an aberrant activation due to a position effect at the integration site and not due to <italic>shh </italic>regulatory elements present in the transgene construct (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A&#x02013;D</xref>). The proximal transgene expression domain remains active throughout the subsequent ontogeny of the caudal fin and marks the perichondrium (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2H&#x02013;J</xref>, Suppl. Fig. S1). These results indicate that the proximal GFP expression domain marks the cells of the adult caudal fin primordium (ACFP) from a very early stage when no obvious cellular features of the ACFP can yet be distinguished and provides a lineage tracer for the formation of endoskeletal structures of the caudal fin.</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>The ontogeny of the caudal and pectoral fins is marked by continuous GFP expression in the transgenic zebrafish line <italic>2.2shh:gfp:ABC#15</italic></bold>.

Fig S1). Importantly, the distal domain of GFP is not due to the position effect, but an inherent property of the transgene construct (Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A&#x02013;D</xref>). This GFP domain is physically separated from the proximal domain marking the ACFP during the process of ossification of the fin rays (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2E&#x02013;G</xref>) and is consistent with the activation of <italic>shh </italic>expression in the growing tip of fin rays first detected at late larval stages with a suggested function in caudal fin regeneration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. Similarly, all other median fins, such as the dorsal and anal fin primordia are marked by both GFP domains during development (see Additional file Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S2">S2</xref>). The expression of GFP is also present in the paired pectoral fins from 36 hpf in the fin bud mesenchyme disc at 5 dpf and throughout subsequent pectoral fin development (see Additional file Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S3">S3</xref>). Together, these results indicate that the proximal GFP expression in this transgenic fish is the earliest expressed molecular marker in median fin primordia and a general marker for endoskeletal structures of skeletal appendages in zebrafish. Therefore, the fortuitous expression of GFP in the ACFP in this transgenic line can be exploited to address questions about the patterning of median fin primordia in a similar fashion to the application of enhancer trap and position effect lines marking specific tissues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. Moreover, the GFP marker in the embryonic fin fold thus facilitates the genetic analysis of ACFP patterning and development in embryonic lethal mutants before these mutants die.</p><fig position="float" id="F2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p><bold>The proximal GFP domain in the ACFP is independent of the fin rays and marks endoskeletal structures</bold>.

To exclude the possibility that the lack of detection of expression of <italic>shh </italic>and other <italic>hedgehogs </italic>in the ACFP is due to low levels below the sensitivity threshold of the whole mount in situ hybridization technique, we have addressed this question by a real time RT PCR approach on microsurgically prepared ACFP and control fin fold samples.

As control, similar sized dorsal fin fold tissue which also includes <italic>shh </italic>expressing cells such as the floor plate and the notochord (DFF) were excised (see Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3H, I</xref>).

Taken together, none of the known <italic>hedgehog </italic>genes in zebrafish show detectable activity in the ACFP by two independent detection techniques. Importantly, the lack of <italic>shh </italic>or <italic>shhb </italic>expression in the ACFP suggests that the caudal fin primordium does not contain an Hh-expressing domain equivalent to the ZPA of paired appendages. In addition, the GFP transgene is present in the pectoral fin but it is not active in the domain of expression of endogenous <italic>shh </italic>in the ZPA (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3F, G</xref>). These result together with the observation that <italic>shh </italic>is not expressed in the ACFP further support our conclusion that the GFP activity in the ACFP results from a transgenic position effect and does not reflect the tissue specificity of the regulatory elements of the transgene promoter. However, the activity of downstream Hedgehog pathway components suggests a long distance Hedgehog signaling function in the ACFP.</p><p>Since Hedgehog pathway components were found to be active in the ACFP we asked whether Hh signaling is required for the formation of the ACFP. To this end, we utilized the GFP transgene expression as marker for the ACFP in <italic>sonic you </italic>(<italic>syu</italic><sup>-/-</sup>) and <italic>slow muscle omitted </italic>mutants (<italic>smu</italic><sup>-/-</sup>) that are defective in the function of Shh and the Hh co-receptor Smoothened, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. GFP expression was strongly reduced or completely lost in the region of the ACFP of the two mutants, indicating that Shh signaling is required for normal patterning of the ACFP (compare Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A</xref> to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B, C</xref>). Similarly, <italic>bmp4 </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>] a marker of median fin bud in dogfish [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>] and the Shh target gene <italic>patched </italic>(<italic>ptc</italic>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>] are expressed in the wild type ACFP but are vastly impaired in Hh pathway mutants at 72 hpf (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4D, E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4F, G</xref> respectively). Expression of the mesenchyme marker <italic>msx-C </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>] however, was unaffected (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4H, I</xref>) indicating that the ACFP phenotype in <italic>smu</italic><sup>-/- </sup>is not due to general loss of fin fold mesenchyme. A further aspect of both <italic>smu</italic><sup>-/- </sup>and <italic>syu</italic><sup>-/- </sup>mutant phenotypes is the mismigration of melanophores resulting in the loss of the melanophore gap that marks the position of the ACFP in wild type embryos (compare Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref> to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B, C</xref>). The mutant data together with the expression of Shh pathway components clearly indicates that GFP expression in the ACFP requires <italic>sonic hedgehog </italic>function and the activity of the canonical Hh signaling pathway.</p><p>Next, we addressed the question when Hh signaling is required for development of the ACFP. Hh signaling was blocked in a temporally controlled manner by administering the alkaloid drug cyclopamine, a specific inhibitor of Smoothened protein function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>], at different developmental stages. Cyclopamine treatment at 24 hpf to 48 hpf results in loss of transgene expression in the ACFP phenocopying the effects seen in <italic>syu</italic><sup>-/- </sup>and <italic>smu</italic><sup>-/- </sup>mutants (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5A</xref> to Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B, C</xref> and see Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S5">S5</xref>). Thus, cyclopamine treatment appears as efficient as blocking the Hh pathway genetically and resulted in eventual lethality of the larvae. When administered at 48, 72 or 96 hpf for 24 hours each time, cyclopamine treatment still resulted in a reduction of the GFP expression domain while controls were unaffected (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5B&#x02013;D</xref> and see Additional file Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S5">S5</xref>). The effect of cyclopamine treatment showed a decreasing trend as development progressed (compare treatment at 48 h to 96 h). Taken together, these results demonstrate a continuing requirement for Hh signaling in the growing caudal fin primordium during larval stages.</p><fig position="float" id="F5"><label>Figure 5</label><caption><p><bold>Continual and direct requirement for Hedgehog signaling in caudal fin development</bold>.

We used the <italic>gfp </italic>transgene expression as a marker to assess the ability of transplanted cells to contribute to the ACFP. We carried out cell transplantations from wild type (wt) and <italic>smu</italic><sup>-/- </sup>donor embryos (harboring the <italic>gfp </italic>transgene in 75% of the cases, see Materials and Methods) to wt and <italic>smu</italic><sup>-/- </sup>non-transgenic recipient embryos. All wt transgenic cells in the fin fold mesenchyme of wt recipients (200 embryos with rhodamine-dextran labeled cells in the fin fold mesenchyme) show the expected GFP signal in the proximal part of the caudal fin mesenchyme (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5E&#x02013;G</xref>). In contrast, transgenic <italic>smu</italic><sup>-/- </sup>cells did not express GFP in a wt environment indicating a cell-autonomous requirement for <italic>smu </italic>(45 embryos with rhodamine-positive cells in the fin fold mesenchyme, Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5H&#x02013;J</xref>). As expected, transplantations of <italic>smu</italic><sup>-/- </sup>cells to <italic>smu</italic><sup>-/- </sup>recipient embryos (n = 23 embryos) did not result in rhodamine-labeled cells in the fin fold mesenchyme. However, <italic>smu</italic><sup>-/- </sup>cells can activate the transgene in the floor plate mimicking <italic>shh </italic>expression in <italic>smu</italic><sup>-/- </sup>embryos [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>] (n = 13, Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5K</xref>), and excluding the possibility that <italic>smu</italic><sup>-/- </sup>cells have a general defect that prevents expression of the transgene. Wt to <italic>smu</italic><sup>-/- </sup>transplants (n = 174 embryos) failed in all cases to contribute to the caudal fin fold mesenchyme and to express the transgene in this location. Instead, donor cells were present in the ectoderm or in the hemangiogenic mesenchyme of the tail only (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5L, M</xref>) indicating that a wild type environment with functional Smoothened is required for the correct cell fate decisions of precursor cells.</p><p>An important question is the source of the Hedgehog signals in ACFP patterning. The fin fold mesenchyme has been found to be devoid of <italic>hh </italic>expression, however, the near-by notochord and floor plate, the closest tissues that express <italic>shh </italic>are good candidates for providing such signals (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A#150;G</xref>). To address the requirement for a functional midline in ACFP patterning, <italic>floating head </italic>(<italic>flh</italic>) mutants were utilized, which lack notochord and all or most of the posterior floor plate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>] and as a result, show no expression of <italic>shh </italic>in the trunk and tail [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]. At 3 dpf lack of midline <italic>shh </italic>activity is demonstrated in <italic>flh</italic><sup>-/- </sup>mutant embryos by the <italic>shh </italic>promoter driven GFP (arrowheads in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6A, B</xref>). The lack of functional midline was coupled with the lack or substantially reduced GFP activity in the ACFP of the fin fold mesenchyme (in 96.2% of embryos, n = 62, arrows in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6A, B</xref>) while the fin fold mesenchyme remained unaffected as indicated by <italic>msx-C </italic>(Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6C, D</xref>). This result indicates that a functional midline is required for the patterning of the ACFP. If midline plays a role in ACFP patterning by providing Shh, it is expected that in <italic>flh</italic><sup>-/- </sup>mutants in which a small number of Shh expressing residual floor plate cells occasionally appear, the ACFP phenotype may be rescued. To address this possibility we have exploited the residual floor plate cells in <italic>flh</italic><sup>-/- </sup>mutants and compared the ACFP regions of <italic>flh</italic><sup>-/- </sup>embryos with or without floor plate cells (arrowheads in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6B, E</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6F</xref>). Most of the embryos with floor plate cells (70.9%, n = 85) showed distinguishable recovery of the ACFP (arrow in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6E, F</xref>). In contrast, <italic>flh</italic><sup>-/- </sup>embryos without floor plate cells showed ACFP GFP recovery only in 26.9% (n = 52) of the embryos analyzed. This result indicates that functional midline cells are associated with the ACFP and <italic>shh </italic>expressing cells of the midline likely contribute to the rescue of the ACFP patterning. The fact, that <italic>syu</italic><sup>-/- </sup>mutants have both floor plate and notochord, but lack functional Shh, together with the above results in <italic>flh</italic><sup>-/- </sup>mutants is consistent with the suggested role of the midline in ACFP patterning to provide Shh signals.</p><fig position="float" id="F6"><label>Figure 6</label><caption><p><bold>A functional midline with expression of <italic>shh </italic>is required for the ACFP</bold>.

In contrast to the ZPA of wings, paired fins and limbs of Osteichthyes, <italic>shh </italic>is not expressed within the ACFP. However, several lines of evidence suggests that the ACFP is an early target of Hedgehog signals and that Shh originates from the notochord and floor plate indicating a long distance delivery mechanism functioning in the caudal fin primordium. This finding provides the earliest acting molecular mechanism uncovered that function in the caudal fin primordium of Osteichthyes and brings into focus the question of the evolutionary origin and mechanism of Hh signaling in vertebrate appendage specification.</p><p>The local expression of several Hedgehog signaling pathway components and the lack of <italic>hedgehog </italic>gene expression in the ACFP is consistent with a long distance Hedgehog signaling mechanism while it does not exclude the possibility that Hh signaling also acts on premigratory or migrating precursor cells. The <italic>you </italic>(Scube2) gene was identified as a component of the Shh pathway component acting at long distance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>] which is active in Shh receiving cells and shows high expression levels away from the source of Shh in the neural tube. Interestingly, the <italic>you </italic>gene is already expressed in the embryonic fin fold in the caudal region at 1 dpf [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>] and is specifically expressed in the ACFP (this study). However, the <italic>you </italic>gene is redundant in the patterning of the ACFP probably due to the existence of several complementing <italic>you </italic>paralog (our unpublished data). Similarly to the <italic>you </italic>gene, <italic>smu </italic>is expressed at high levels away from the source of Shh in the dorsal brain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>] and dorsal neural tube as well as in the ACFP. These expression activities together with the lack of detectable <italic>hedgehog </italic>gene expression provide support to the notion of a Hedgehog signaling mechanism acting at a distance in the ACFP.</p><p>The data presented in this study does not explain the exact mechanism of the Hh signaling, however several studies provide parallels from other tissues of the vertebrate embryo that may be analogous to the mechanisms present in the caudal fin primordium. A long distance Hedgehog signaling mechanism could act through migrating cells that contribute to the caudal fin primordium. For example, Hh signaling acts in the migrating murine cranial neural crest cells in mouse and fish [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>] and a potentially similar mechanism may act in the ACFP. Recent work in lamprey and dogshark suggests that the median fins are mainly of sclerotomal origin, albeit some contribution from the neural crest has also been demonstrated in these basal vertebrates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. Further reports suggest that trunk neural crest contributes to the caudal fin and other median fins also in Osteichthyes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>]. Trunk neural crest cells migrate from a dorsal aspect of the trunk ventrally alongside the midline, which is a known source of Hedgehogs, which may take effect on these migrating cells. Alternatively, somitic mesoderm (sclerotome) cells migrating ventrally may also contribute to the caudal fin primordium similarly to that observed in the embryonic fin fold of axolotl [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>]. Hedgehog signaling could also act on somitic cells similarly to the way Shh expressed in the midline functions in patterning the muscle pioneer cells that migrate laterally to form the slow muscle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>]. It is interesting to note, that in our cell transplantation experiments when wild type cells were transplanted into <italic>smu</italic><sup>-/- </sup>mutants, these wt cells failed to migrate to where the ACFP would normally form. This result suggests that hedgehog signaling is also required for the correct migration of cells into the ACFP and this likely represent an additional non-cell autonomous function for Hedgehog signaling, prerequisite to the formation of the caudal fin primordium. The cells of the ACFP mesenchyme, however, are unlikely to be solely originating from cell migration, and local cell proliferation within the territory, where we have identified the ACFP has also been reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>]. The process of cell migration and local cell proliferation in the ACFP is likely regulated by non-canonical Wnt signaling, as suggested by the analysis of Wnt5a function in <italic>hoxb8a </italic>mutant medaka fish (Oryzias latipes) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. It will be interesting to address the possible regulatory relationship between Hh and Wnt signaling in the caudal fin priordium.</p><p>Whether Hedgehog signaling acts on mesodermal or neural crest derived cells in the zebrafish caudal fin is yet to be determined as the origin of the ACFP cells is yet unknown and requires cell fate mapping in developing caudal fins. Due to the late developing nature of the tail primordium novel fate mapping technologies will have to be adapted to zebrafish such as the tissue specific and conditional activation of marker genes in somitic and neural crest cells of the developing tail [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>].</p><p>It cannot be excluded at this point that other <italic>hedgehog </italic>genes such as <italic>shhb </italic>and <italic>ihhb </italic>expressed in the midline during the formation of the ACFP may also contribute to its development. The data presented here with the <italic>syu </italic>mutant and the fact that <italic>shh </italic>is the only <italic>hh </italic>gene continually expressed in the midline during the time of the formation for the ACFP strongly suggests that Shh is the key protein functioning in early ACFP patterning. While direct comparisons between the paired limbs and the caudal fin can not be made due to the fundamental morphological differences between these appendages, it is interesting to note that several regulators of limb buds are active in and required for ACFP development.</p><p>It is not possible to address what adult morphology is specifically affected by the loss of Shh signaling as the Shh pathway mutants as well as cyclopamine treated embryos die before markers of adult caudal fin appear and can be analyzed. In this respect it is interesting to note that Shh was previously implicated in promoting chondrogenesis in mesenchyme cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>]. Nevertheless, several aspects of ACFP patterning are affected besides the aberrant GFP expression in Hh pathway mutants, including the aberrant expression of <italic>bmp4 </italic>and mis-migration of melanophores that form the gap which marks the antero-posterior position of the ACFP in wild type embryos.</p><p>Antero-posterior (A-P) asymmetry of differentiated endoskeletal morphology is a fundamental feature of gnathostome paired and unpaired fins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. Due to the lack of markers for the antero-posterior domains of the ACFP our experiments on Shh signaling components, could not reveal an obvious role for these molecules in the A-P patterning of the caudal fin primordium. The expression of GFP and the additional genes studied in the ACFP all express in a similar antero-posterior extent. As it is demonstrated by the time lapse analysis of the GFP expression, these marker genes do not represent obvious antero-posterior restricted expression at least at the time of the initial formation of the ACFP domain. However, our results suggest significant modifications of the functions of common molecular components in the caudal fin in comparison to paired fins/limb buds. The expression of Shh in the ZPA has previously been suggested to contribute to the morphological changes resulting in separation of the fin from the body wall in Osteichthyes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>] and has been proposed to be co-opted after the Osteichthyes/Chondrichthyes split [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. Recently, contrasting data have been published [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>] demonstrating that skate (<italic>Raja erinacea</italic>) and a shark species (<italic>Chiloscyllum punctatum</italic>) possesses posterior <italic>shh </italic>expression in pectoral and dorsal fins, suggesting, that the <italic>shh </italic>expression domain in appendages is an ancient property, which may have remained undetected in dogfish [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>] possibly due to the secondary loss of this expression domain in dogfish. <italic>Shh </italic>expression, however, was also found in the dorsal fin of skate and shark. This observation raises the question, whether polarized expression of <italic>shh </italic>would also be an ancient character in all median fins including the caudal fin. If this was the case, the lack of detectable <italic>shh </italic>expression in the zebrafish caudal fin primordium would suggest secondarily loss of <italic>shh </italic>expression. Unfortunately, neither of the above cited publications has addressed the expression of <italic>shh </italic>in the caudal fin buds of chondricthyans specifically and thus this question remains to be answered.</p><p>Alternatively, the uncovered Hh signaling function of the caudal fin primordium in the zebrafish without local <italic>shh </italic>source may represent ancient but fundamentally different way of fin patterning mechanism from that of paired and dorsal median fins. Although the cyprinid caudal fin, like those of other teleosts, is derived in being abbreviated and having a lepidotrichial field with a symmetry plane, the fundamental architecture of the zebrafish caudal fin is ancient. Notably, the endoskeleton of the zebrafish caudal fin contains modified forms of ancestral fin radials that during early development relate spatially to the notochord in the same manner as in the earliest gnathostomes. The molecular correlates of caudal fin formation described here are concerning the primordium of endoskeletal components of the caudal fin, as marked by the proximal GFP label of the ACFP. Thus, the patterning of the ACFP may represent the primitive gnathostome condition. In this respect, it will be particularly interesting to ask whether Hh signaling pathway components including <italic>shh </italic>are also expressed in the caudal fin buds of basal gnathostome and jawless vertebrates. Since median fins are evolutionarily more ancient structures than paired fins with the caudal fin being the oldest skeletal appendage of chordates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>], we speculate that the patterning of early median fin primordia by Shh signaling may be an ancient mechanism that reflects the primitive state of skeletal appendage specification in vertebrates.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>In this study we have provided an ontogenic description of the primordium of a teleost caudal fin, which is an important morphological specialisation of fishes and as a median fin, is considered as one of the evolutionary oldest vertebrate skeletogenic appendages. Secondly, we have gathered evidence by four independent approaches: mutant data, inhibitor drug treatment, gene expression analysis and cell autonomy analysis to demonstrate that Hedgehog signaling is a regulator of caudal fin development. Thirdly, we uncovered an intriguing difference between Hh signal delivery in paired fins that contain a Shh expressing region referred to as the zone of polarizing activity (ZPA) and the caudal fin primordium of zebrafish that we show does not express Shh. This finding provides ammunition to the debate about when and where Hedgehog signaling was first utilised in appendage development during vertebrate evolution.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p>The <italic>2.2shh:gfp:ABC#15 </italic>transgenic line was produced as described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>].

Instead of biotin, 1 pl 1% fixable tetramethyl-rhodamine-dextrane 3000 MW (Molecular Probes, D-3308) was injected into 1&#x02013;4 cell wt containing the <italic>gfp </italic>transgene and <italic>smo</italic><sup>-/- </sup>embryos containing the <italic>gfp </italic>transgene which were left to develop till 30% epiboly. (Only embryos labeled uniformly at this stage were used for the transplants.) Embryos were then transferred into a dish where they were held in pairs during and after the transplants. The transplants were carried out between shield and 60% epiboly stage. Embryos that showed labeling on the ventral side of the median finfold were sorted at 1 dpf (wt to wt, wt to <italic>smu</italic><sup>-/-</sup>, <italic>smu</italic><sup>-/- </sup>to wt, <italic>smu</italic><sup>-/- </sup>to <italic>smu</italic><sup>-/-</sup>) and were left to grow till 3 dpf. Embryos were then anaesthetized and mounted in low melting point agarose and a Leica TCSNT confocal microscope was used to obtain the images of rhodamine labeling and GFP expression.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>YH carried out the molecular genetic studies and participated in the transgenic analyses.
