The probes were designed on the basis of the known amino acid sequence of the tridecapeptide alpha-pheromone. The nucleotide sequence revealed that the two genes, though similar in their overall structure, differ from each other in several striking ways. MF alpha 1 gene contains 4 copies of the coding sequence for the alpha-factor, which are separated by 24 nucleotides encoding the octapeptide Lys-Arg-Glu-Ala-Glu(or Asp)-Ala-Glu-Ala. The first alpha-factor coding block is preceded by a sequence for the hexapeptide Lys-Arg-Glu-Ala and 83 additional amino acids. MF alpha 2 gene contains coding sequences for two copies of the alpha-factor that differ from each other and from alpha-factor encoded by MF alpha 1 gene by a Gln leads to Asn and a Lys leads to Arg substitution. The first copy of the alpha-factor is preceded by a sequence coding for 87 amino acids which ends with Lys-Arg-Glu-Ala-Val-Ala-Asp-Ala. The coding blocks of the two copies of the pheromone are separated by the sequence for Lys-Arg-Glu-Ala-Asn-Ala-Asp-Ala. Thus, the alpha-factor can be derived from 2 different precursor proteins of 165 and 120 amino acids containing, respectively, 4 and 2 copies of the pheromone.</p><sec><title>Images</title><fig id="F1"><graphic xlink:href="nar00357-0206-a" xlink:role="4053"/></fig><fig id="F2"><graphic xlink:href="nar00357-0213-a" xlink:role="4060"/></fig></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><supplementary-material content-type="scanned-pages"><graphic xlink:href="nar00357-0202.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="4049"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00357-0203.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="4050"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00357-0204.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="4051"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00357-0205.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="4052"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00357-0206.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="4053"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00357-0207.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="4054"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00357-0208.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="4055"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00357-0209.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="4056"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00357-0210.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="4057"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00357-0211.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="4058"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00357-0212.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="4059"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00357-0213.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="4060"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00357-0214.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="4061"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00357-0215.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="4062"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00357-0216.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="4063"/></supplementary-material></body></article>
