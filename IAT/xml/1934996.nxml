We investigated how the slow and discontinuous DNA methylation could be mechanistically linked with fast and processive DNA replication. Using photobleaching and quantitative live cell imaging we show that Dnmt1 binding to PCNA is highly dynamic. Activity measurements of a PCNA-binding-deficient mutant with an enzyme-trapping assay in living cells showed that this interaction accounts for a 2-fold increase in methylation efficiency. Expression of this mutant in mouse <italic>dnmt1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> embryonic stem (ES) cells restored CpG island methylation. Thus association of Dnmt1 with the replication machinery enhances methylation efficiency, but is not strictly required for maintaining global methylation. The transient nature of this interaction accommodates the different kinetics of DNA replication and methylation while contributing to faithful propagation of epigenetic information.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Genomic DNA in mammalian cells is commonly methylated at position 5 of cytosine residues in CpG sequences. This epigenetic modification plays an important role in the regulation of gene expression and chromatin structure and is essential for normal development, cell differentiation, X chromosome inactivation and genomic imprinting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>). Cell-type-specific methylation patterns are established <italic>de novo</italic> in early developmental stages by the action of Dnmt3a and 3b and are then maintained through subsequent cell generations primarily by the action of Dnmt1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>). In somatic cells, Dnmt1 is the predominant DNA methyltransferase in terms of abundance, contribution to global methyltransferase activity and to genomic methylation levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>). Reduction of Dnmt1 levels leads to hypomethylation, genomic instability and cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>). Aberrant genomic methylation is often associated with human disease and tumorigenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>).</p><p>Due to its strong preference for hemimethylated substrate DNA <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8 B9 B10">8&#x02013;10</xref>) and its accumulation at replication sites during S-phase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>) Dnmt1 is thought to act on hemimethylated CpG sites generated during DNA replication. The association of Dnmt1 with replication factories was proposed as an efficient mechanism for coupling maintenance of genomic methylation patterns to DNA replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>). Later, direct interaction with the replication processivity factor PCNA was shown and a small PCNA-binding domain (PBD) was mapped to the N-terminal region of Dnmt1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>). This domain was also shown to be necessary for recruitment of Dnmt1 to DNA damage sites, suggesting that it is responsible for coupling DNA repair and restoration of methylation patterns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>). Thus, direct interaction with PCNA would ensure that methylation patterns are faithfully preserved in different situations involving DNA synthesis. However, DNA replication is highly processive taking about 0.035&#x02009;s per nucleotide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>), while <italic>in vitro</italic> steady-state kinetic analysis of purified recombinant Dnmt1 revealed rather low turn-over rates of about 70&#x02013;450&#x02009;s per methyl group transfer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>). Although DNA methylation by Dnmt1 may be faster <italic>in vivo</italic>, it is not likely to come close to the 3&#x02013;4 orders of magnitude faster DNA replication. In fact, cytosine methylation is a highly complex reaction involving recognition of hemimethylated CpG sites, binding of S-adenosylmethionine, flipping of the cytidine base out of the double helix, formation of a covalent bond between the enzyme and the cytidine, transfer of the methyl group and release of the covalent bond by &#x003b2;-elimination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17 B18 B19">17&#x02013;19</xref>). These considerations leave open the question of how DNA replication and methylation are kinetically and mechanistically coordinated.</p><p>In addition to Dnmt1 several other factors directly and indirectly involved in DNA replication, such as DNA Ligase I, Fen1, CAF-1 and Cyclin A have been shown to redistribute to replication foci during S-phase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20 B21 B22 B23 B24">20&#x02013;24</xref>). Many of these factors have been found to interact directly with PCNA, which forms a homotrimeric ring around the DNA helix and serves as a platform for tethering them to the replication machinery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>). Even taking into account the trivalent nature of the PCNA ring, the sheer number of its potential binding partners during replication makes it clear that they cannot all possibly bind at the same time in a constitutive manner.</p><p>The functional relevance of the interaction between Dnmt1 and PCNA and its contribution to the maintenance of epigenetic information after DNA replication, however, remains unclear. We have addressed this question by comparing the kinetics and activity of GFP-tagged wild-type Dnmt1 and PCNA-binding-deficient mutants in live cell assays and Dnmt1 deficient embryonic stem (ES) cells. Our data show that the interaction of Dnmt1 with PCNA is highly transient, increases the efficiency of postreplicative methylation by 2-fold, but is not required for restoring CpG methylation in Dnmt1 deficient ES cells.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Expression constructs</title><p>The expression constructs RFP-PCNA, GFP-Ligase, GFP-Dnmt1<sup>wt</sup>, GFP-Dnmt1<sup>&#x00394;1-171</sup>, GFP-Dnmt1<sup>C1229W</sup> as well as the PBD-GFP construct were described earlier (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>).

Cells were then incubated overnight before performing live cell analysis. Nuclear localization of GFP-Dnmt1<sup>wt</sup> was identical to endogenous Dnmt1 as determined by immunostaining with an affinity purified polyclonal antiserum against the N-terminal domain of mouse Dnmt1. GFP-Dnmt1 localization was not affected by additional co-expression of RFP-PCNA (controls not shown). Dnmt1 immunostaining showed that typical expression levels of transfected GFP-Dnmt1 constructs in cells selected for live cell imaging were comparable to those of endogenous Dnmt1 protein (Supplementary Figure 1).

The microscope was equipped with a heated environmental chamber set to 37&#x000b0;C. Fluorophores were excited with the 488&#x02009;nm line of an argon laser and a 561&#x02009;nm solid state diode laser. Confocal image series were typically recorded with a frame size of 256 &#x000d7; 256 pixels, a pixel size of 100&#x02009;nm, and with 150&#x02009;ms time intervals. The laser power was typically set to 2&#x02013;4% transmission with the pinhole opened to 3 Airy units. For FRAP analysis, half of the nucleus was photobleached for 300&#x02009;ms with all laser lines of the argon laser set to maximum power at 100% transmission. Typically 20 prebleach and 400 postbleach frames were recorded for each series. Quantitative evaluation was performed using ImageJ. The mean fluorescence intensities of the bleached and unbleached region for each time point were background subtracted and normalized to the mean of the last 10 prebleach values (single normalized). These values were divided by the respective total nuclear fluorescence in order to correct for total loss of nuclear fluorescence as well as for the gain of nuclear fluorescence due to import from the cytoplasm over the time course (double normalized). Since the fluorescence in the bleached region differed from cell to cell and typically did not reach background level the values were also normalized to zero. Here, only the distal two-thirds of the unbleached part in the first postbleach frame were considered as reference to take into account fast diffusing molecules invading into the bleached half (triple normalized).

To address the function of the PBD in early and mid S-phase more specifically and to exclude potential misfolding of the protein due to the large deletion we have generated GFP-Dnmt1 constructs bearing single point mutations of highly conserved residues within the PIP (PCNA-interacting peptide)-Box (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>) of the PBD (GFP-Dnmt1<sup>Q162E</sup> and GFP-Dnmt1<sup>F169S</sup>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>). Either of these mutant constructs were expressed in C2C12 mouse myoblasts together with RFP-PCNA, which served as S-phase marker (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>).

Earlier work has demonstrated that the maintenance methyltransferase Dnmt1 binds to the replication processivity factor PCNA and is thus recruited to replication sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>). The interaction between Dnmt1 and the replication machinery was proposed as a mechanism for coupling maintenance of genomic methylation to DNA replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>). By traveling along with the replication machinery Dnmt1 would be able to restore symmetrical methylation as soon as hemimethylated CpG sites are generated. The estimated kinetics of DNA replication <italic>in vivo</italic> and DNA methylation by Dnmt1 <italic>in vitro</italic>, however, differ by 3&#x02013;4 orders of magnitude arguing against a stable coupling. Although DNA methylation may be faster <italic>in vivo</italic> it is not likely to come much closer to the DNA replication rate. In other words, it is reasonable to assume that methylating a cytosine takes far longer than to incorporate it. Also, DNA replication is essentially a continuous process, while methylated CpG sites are encountered discontinuously in vertebrate genomes. Stable binding of Dnmt1 to the replication machinery would stall replication at each hemimethylated CpG site. Here we show that the interaction of Dnmt1 with the replication machinery <italic>in vivo</italic> is highly dynamic and that immobilization of Dnmt1 at postreplicative hemimethylated sites does not prevent the progression of DNA replication. The transient nature of the interaction between Dnmt1 and the replication machinery allows rapid release and transfer of Dnmt1 to hemimethylated substrate sites, reconciling the paradox of the relative rates of DNA replication and methylation. According to basic principles of enzyme kinetics the local enrichment of Dnmt1 at replication foci would increase the postreplicative methylation rate. At the same time, transient binding of Dnmt1 enables also other replication factors to interact with PCNA. Similar binding dynamics have been shown for the interaction of PCNA with DNA Ligase I and Fen1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>) and may thus represent a common feature of PBD-containing factors.</p><p>Interestingly, the interaction between Dnmt1 and PCNA is believed to be a major mechanism for the methylation maintenance activity of Dnmt1, but its functional relevance had never been tested experimentally. Here we show two lines of evidence that this interaction is not crucial for the maintenance of methylation patterns in mammalian cells. First, postreplicative methylation rate of wild-type Dnmt1 measured <italic>in vivo</italic> is only 2-fold faster than that of a PCNA-binding-deficient mutant. Second, methylation of both single copy and repetitive sequences in Dnmt1 deficient ES cells was restored by this PCNA-binding-deficient Dnmt1 mutant with efficiency comparable to wild-type Dnmt1. The maintenance of DNA methylation without direct coupling to the replication machinery could in part be explained by the preference of Dnmt1 for hemimethylated sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8 B9 B10">8&#x02013;10</xref>). Also, genetic manipulation in the mouse indicate that Dnmt1 is at least 5-fold more abundant than necessary for maintaining normal methylation levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>). Thus, the combined effect of the affinity for hemimethylated sites, relative abundance and simple diffusion could explain the relatively fast immobilization of PCNA-binding-deficient mutants in the presence of 5-aza-dC. In addition, the ability of Dnmt1 to methylate nucleosomal DNA <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51 B52 B53">51&#x02013;53</xref>), suggests that maintenance of DNA methylation is not necessarily restricted to the short time window before nucleosome assembly.</p><p>Recent structural data on Ligase I:PCNA and FEN-1:PCNA complexes indicate that for these enzymes PCNA does not simply serves as a loading platform for the replication machinery, but also causes allosteric activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B56">56</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B57">57</xref>). The data presented here cannot rule out a similar mechanism for Dnmt1, but clearly show that interaction with PCNA is not a prerequisite for enzyme activity <italic>in vivo</italic>. The transient nature of this interaction also argues against PCNA as a classic processivity factor for postreplicative DNA methylation. The major role of the PCNA interaction most likely is to increase the local Dnmt1 concentration and thereby enhance methylation efficiency at replication sites.</p><p>Notably, it is still unclear whether the role and regulation of Dnmt1 is similar in different cell types and species. While Dnmt1 is clearly essential for maintenance of DNA methylation in mouse cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">54</xref>), it seemed dispensable in human tumor HCT116 cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>). However, two reports recently showed that DNMT1 is essential for maintenance of DNA methylation also in these human tumor cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B55">55</xref>). It turned out that genomic methylation was maintained by a residual, truncated DNMT1 form lacking the PBD, arguing that PCNA binding is not strictly required in these cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>).</p><p>Also, the requirement of Dnmt1 for cell viability remains unsettled. In mouse fibroblasts inactivation of the <italic>dnmt1</italic> gene caused a continuous loss of genomic methylation leading to apoptotic cell death after several cell division cycles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">54</xref>). Similar results were obtained after depletion of DNMT1 activity by RNA interference in human cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>). Surprisingly, conditional deletion of the <italic>DNMT1</italic> locus in the same cells caused immediate apoptotic cell death long before substantial passive loss of genomic methylation could occur (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B58">58</xref>) arguing for additional roles of DNMT1. In this regard, the association of Dnmt1 with heterochromatin in G2 phase and occasionally in mitosis in mouse cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>) would fit well with the mitotic catastrophe observed upon deletion of the <italic>DNMT1</italic> gene in HCT116 cells. In addition, the PBD-mediated association of Dnmt1 with repair sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>) may indicate a direct role in the maintenance of genome integrity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B59">59</xref>). Clearly, more experiments are required to resolve the species and cell-type-specific role and regulation of Dnmt1.</p><p>In summary, we demonstrate that the association of Dnmt1 with the replication machinery is not strictly required for maintaining global methylation but still enhances <italic>in vivo</italic> methylation efficiency by 2-fold. Whereas the benefit of Dnmt1 to be directly recruited to replication foci seems subtle in short-term cell culture experiments, it may be more relevant in long-lived organisms and in situations where the nuclear concentration of Dnmt1 is limiting. Indeed, Dnmt1 levels vary considerably in different tissues and developmental stages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B60">60</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B61">61</xref>). Based on sequence features of the <italic>dnmt1</italic> gene a modular structure was proposed to originate from an ancestral DNA methyltransferase that evolved by stepwise acquisition of new domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>). Thus, the improved efficiency of postreplicative methylation achieved by the PBD-mediated transient binding to PCNA likely represents an additional safety mechanism, which was acquired in the course of evolution and contributes to the faithful maintenance of epigenetic information over the entire lifespan of complex organisms.</p></sec><sec><title>SUPPLEMENTARY DATA</title><p>Supplementary Data are available at NAR Online.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material id="PMC_1" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>[Supplementary Material]</title></caption><media mimetype="text" mime-subtype="html" xlink:href="nar_gkm432_index.html"/><media xlink:role="associated-file" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="nar_gkm432_1.pdf"/><media xlink:role="associated-file" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="nar_gkm432_2.pdf"/><media xlink:role="associated-file" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="nar_gkm432_3.pdf"/><media xlink:role="associated-file" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="nar_gkm432_4.pdf"/><media xlink:role="associated-file" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="nar_gkm432_5.pdf"/><media xlink:role="associated-file" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="nar_gkm432_6.pdf"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS</title><p>We are grateful to Markus Moser and Reinhard F&#x000e4;ssler (MPI for Biochemistry, Martinsried) for introducing us to ES cell culture, Hans-Peter Rahn (MDC, Berlin) and Michaela Feuring-Buske (LMU, Munich) for assistance with FACS-sorting, Gernot L&#x000e4;ngst (University of Regensburg) for help with the methyltransferase activity assay and En Li (Novartis Institutes for Biomedical Research) for providing the pCAG-IRESblast vector.
