Liver vasculogenesis in vertebrates occurs through the interaction of endoderm-derived liver epithelium and mesoderm-derived endothelial cells (ECs). In zebrafish, although it has been found that ECs are not required for liver budding, how and when the spatio-temporal pattern of liver growth is coordinated with ECs remains to be elucidated.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>To study the process of liver development and vasculogenesis <italic>in vivo</italic>, a two-color transgenic zebrafish line <italic>Tg(lfabf:dsRed; elaA:EGFP) </italic>was generated and named LiPan for liver-specific expression of DsRed RFP and exocrine pancreas-specific expression of GFP. Using the LiPan line, we first followed the dynamic development of liver from live embryos to adult and showed the formation of three distinct yet connected liver lobes during development. The LiPan line was then crossed with <italic>Tg(fli1:EGFP)</italic><sup>y1 </sup>and vascular development in the liver was traced <italic>in vivo</italic>. Liver vasculogenesis started at 55&#x02013;58 hpf when ECs first surrounded hepatocytes from the liver bud surface and then invaded the liver to form sinusoids and later the vascular network. Using a novel non-invasive and label-free fluorescence correction spectroscopy, we detected blood circulation in the liver starting at ~72 hpf. To analyze the roles of ECs and blood circulation in liver development, both <italic>cloche </italic>mutants (lacking ECs) and Tnnt2 morphants (no blood circulation) were employed. We found that until 70 hpf liver growth and morphogenesis depended on ECs and nascent sinusoids. After 72 hpf, a functional sinusoidal network was essential for continued liver growth. An absence of blood circulation in Tnnt2 morphants caused defects in liver vasculature and small liver.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>There are two phases of liver development in zebrafish, budding and growth. In the growth phase, there are three distinct stages: avascular growth between 50&#x02013;55 hpf, where ECs are not required; endothelium-dependent growth, where ECs or sinusoids are required for liver growth between 55&#x02013;72 hpf before blood circulation in liver sinusoids; and circulation-dependent growth, where the circulation is essential to maintain vascular network and to support continued liver growth after 72 hpf.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>Hepatogenesis in zebrafish has been intensively studied in recent years and these studies indicate that the early stages are rather similar in mice and zebrafish [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. As detected by expression of <italic>ceruloplasmin </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>] and GFP expression in the gut-GFP transgenic line [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>], the liver anlagen initially appears as a small compact protrusion of the intestinal rod at ~30 hpf (hours postfertilization) on the left side of the embryo. By 2 dpf (days postfertilization), the liver bud starts to enlarge and forms the hepatic duct connecting the intestinal bulb primordium to the liver, which marks the end of the budding phase and the beginning of the growth phase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Despite these progresses, the late events of hepatogenesis and the underlying developmental mechanisms are not fully understood. A further analysis of liver development during the growth period will complement existing studies and will be highly desirable as during this period the liver develops its vasculature and becomes functional.</p><p>Liver organogenesis in vertebrates coincides with the appearance of ECs adjacent to the endoderm. In mice, before the formation of functional blood vessels, ECs provide a very early morphogenetic signal to the liver bud. It has been shown that in <italic>Vegfr2/Flk-1</italic><sup>-/- </sup>mouse embryos that lack ECs, the liver undergoes the initial step of hepatic specification and forms a multi-layered epithelium anlage, but further liver morphogenesis fails prior to mesenchyme invasion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. In zebrafish <italic>cloche </italic>mutant embryos in which EC differentiation is disrupted at the stage prior to <italic>Vegfr2/Flk-1 </italic>expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>], liver budding and differentiation have been found to proceed normally [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. However, the interaction between vasculature and liver, as well as the role of ECs and growing vessels in late hepatogenesis in zebrafish, remain largely unclear.</p><p>To investigate the late events of liver development and the roles of vasculogenesis and blood flow, in the present study, a two-color transgenic line <italic>Tg(lfabf:ds-Red; elaA:EGFP) </italic>named LiPan for Liver- and Pancreas-specific transgene expression, was generated and it displayed strong expression of Ds-Red RFP (red fluorescent protein) in the liver and GFP in the exocrine pancreas. To visualize liver vasculogenesis, the LiPan line was crossed with <italic>Tg(fli1:EGFP)</italic><sup>y1</sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. Liver vasculogenesis and growth was traced in embryos of compound transgenics on wild type and mutant backgrounds using single- and multi-photon laser scanning microscopy. By taking the advantage of recently developed non-invasive method of fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>], the initiation of blood flow in liver vessels in live zebrafish embryos was determined. Finally, by analyses of the EC-less <italic>cloche </italic>mutant and blood flow defective Tnnt2 morphants, we demonstrated the interaction of ECs with hepatocytes and blood flow act in sequence to sustain the continued growth of liver in late development.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Liver morphogenesis in two-color LiPan transgenic line</title><p>The two-color LiPan transgenic line was generated by co-injection of the dsRed RFP reporter gene under a liver-specific <italic>lfabp </italic>promoter [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>] and the GFP reporter gene under an exocrine pancreas-specific <italic>elaA </italic>promoter [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. The LiPan transgenic line allowed simultaneous monitoring of the temporal and spatial development of two major digestive organs in live embryos/fish, the RFP-expressing liver and GFP-expressing exocrine pancreas. Generally, the red fluorescence appeared in the position of the liver bud from the left side at 48&#x02013;53 hpf (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>) and the green fluorescence appeared in position of the exocrine pancreas at the right side of the dorso-anterior intestine of the embryos at 67&#x02013;72 hpf with its anterior part (head pancreas) at the level of the 3<sup>rd </sup>somite and its posterior part (tail pancreas) at the level of the 6<sup>th </sup>somite. At 72 hpf, the liver actively grew and further expanded laterally and antero-ventrally beyond the 1<sup>st </sup>somite (the first or left lobe, Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>), it remained its initial shape and was restricted to the left side of the body. At 80&#x02013;84 hpf, the liver rapidly expanded in several directions: anteriorly towards the ear vesicle and ventrally across the midline to the right side of the body (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C</xref>), where it formed the second lobe (the right or gall-bladder lobe, Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1D</xref>). Soon after, hepatocytes of the right lobe established tight contact with the gall bladder (80&#x02013;96 hpf), and a yellow-greenish substance, probably bile, appeared in the intestinal bulb (not shown), suggesting that at least some hepatocytes were sufficiently mature to function in food digestion.</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Liver development in LiPan transgenic zebrafish</bold>.

While anteriorly both lobes were almost at the same A-P level and in contact with the pericardial cavity, posteriorly the right lobe was much shorter due to the presence of the gall bladder and pancreas immediately posterior to it (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1F</xref>). The size of both liver and exocrine pancreas varied slightly, but at this A-P level the liver and pancreas were invariably projected onto opposite sides of the body as compact and separated organs (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1D, F, G</xref>).</p><p>Between 5&#x02013;10 dpf, the liver continued to grow in size. Around 15 dpf, the ventral most portion of the liver began expanding posteriorly (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1H, I</xref>), leading to the formation of the third flat ventral lobe caudally to the first two lobes. The timing of development of the third lobe varied between 15&#x02013;20 dpf. After 15 dpf, the exocrine pancreas was enlarged mostly posteriorly following the looped intestine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. We observed the exocrine pancreas in the adult zebrafish to be a less compact structure compared to that in the larvae. GFP-expressing exocrine tissue was consistently observed only on one side of the intestinal mesentery along all three intestinal loops and it never surrounded the intestine (21 male and female LiPan zebrafish, Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A, B</xref>), [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. While the liver in general occupied the anterior region of the body cavity, exocrine pancreas occupied the posterior part of the body cavity (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>). In addition, liver-expressed RFP and exocrine pancreas-expressed GFP could be observed in live adult LiPan zebrafish under a fluorescent microscope (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2C, D</xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="F2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p><bold>Liver and pancreas in adult LiPan fish</bold>.

In LiPan/<italic>Tg(fli1:EGFP)</italic><sup>y1 </sup>embryos, we directly observed events of liver vasculogenesis from the late liver budding stage and during the liver growth phase. After the liver budding stage was complete at 50 hpf, distinct GFP-expressing ECs bordered the liver. These ECs probably represented components of nascent branches from the subintestinal vessels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. At this stage, hepatocytes on the surface and inside the liver bud remained tightly interconnected and showed no obvious morphological organization as observed by confocal microscopy (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A&#x02013;F</xref>) and histological staining (not shown). During the growth phase at 55&#x02013;58 hpf, GFP-expressing ECs edged the liver completely and sprouts of ECs contacted seemingly less associated superficial hepatocytes and penetrated between them (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3G, H</xref>), whereas inner hepatocytes remained tightly connected (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3H, I</xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="F3"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p><bold>Liver vasculogenesis</bold>.

At 58 hpf, RFP negative areas in the innermost liver layers (arrowhead) and a daisy pattern of hepatocytes are formed around this areas (J). At 70 hpf, the daisy pattern of hepatocytes around RFP negative areas extended to the superficial layers and ECs surround the daisy clusters of hepatocytes from outside (K). In some cases, ECs are inside of daisy clusters of hepatocytes (M). By 120 hpf, the size of sinusoids significantly increases (N).

Subsequently, ECs penetrate deeper and appeared between internal layers of hepatocytes and RFP-negative areas were extended to near the liver surface layers (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3K</xref>). Thus, the timing of ECs and hepatocyte interaction seems correlated with the daisy organization of hepatocytes around the RFP-negative areas. The RFP-negative areas might represent ductal cells previously identified in zebrafish liver at around 60 hpf [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. While the liver extended laterally and anteriorly, the daisy pattern of hepatocytes was evident in nearly all liver layers and ECs appeared around the daisy patterned hepatocytes (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3K</xref>). However, in some cases, we also observed ECs inside the daisy structure of hepatocytes as well (not shown at this time point but see Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3M</xref>) and it seemed that ECs and hepatocytes moved towards each other. Between 68&#x02013;72 hpf, ECs formed the structure of the first sinusoids. The sinusoids were 5&#x02013;8 &#x003bc;m in diameter and contributed to the substantial increase of the liver in size. Up to this stage, ECs were arranged into non-functional vessels as no erythrocytes were detected within the liver (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3I, L</xref>).</p><p>After initiation of vasculogenesis, the liver grew rapidly and by 80&#x02013;84 hpf it extended across the midline to the right side. Sinusoids were enlarged to 8&#x02013;10 &#x003bc;m in diameter (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3M</xref>). At 96 hpf, the liver was extended further. At 120&#x02013;130 hpf, the diameter of sinusoids was around 12&#x02013;16 &#x003bc;m, while hepatocytes of liver parenchyma were around 10&#x02013;14 &#x003bc;m in diameter. Sequential endothelium-epithelium interaction during liver vasculogenesis significantly altered the structure of liver parenchyma. In both left and right liver lobes hepatocytes were surrounded by endothelia and almost every hepatocyte was associated with a sinusoid (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3N</xref>, also see Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4F</xref>). Histological analysis confirmed the presence of blood cells in sinusoids at this stage (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3O</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Detection of blood flow in the embryonic liver</title><p>Although we observed an increase of sinusoids in size from the very beginning of their formation up to 120 hpf, it remained unknown when they became functional in liver. Therefore, we used a recently described non-invasive and label-free approach of fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS) to determine the timing of blood flow initiation in vessels of zebrafish embryonic liver [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. Using the LiPan/<italic>Tg(fli1:EGFP)</italic><sup>y1 </sup>embryos, the FCS method allowed measurement of blood flow in sinusoids of zebrafish liver <italic>in vivo </italic>during development. While first sinusoids were already formed in liver at around 68&#x02013;70 hpf, no blood flow was detected in liver sinusoids within a depth of 70 &#x003bc;m from the liver surface in all analyzed larvae (n = 7, Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A</xref>), but in each of them blood flow was detected in trunk vessels by FCS at this developmental stage. Soon after, at 72&#x02013;75 hpf, we detected initiation of blood flow in external sinusoids of dorso-lateral part of liver parenchyma in three out of seven analyzed points (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B</xref>). It is likely that these sinusoids were already connected to the supraintestinal artery (SIA) and subintestinal veins. It seemed that the time course of initiation of blood flow in liver sinusoids correlated well with the development of intestinal vessels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. After initiation of the circulation, the mesh of sinusoids in the liver developed extremely fast and the liver increased significantly in size between 84&#x02013;120 hpf. By 120 hpf, blood flow was detected in 8 out of 10 points located at different confocal planes as deep as 70 &#x003bc;m in both left and right liver lobes (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4C</xref>). Due to a limit of light penetration, the detection of blood flow was restricted to 70&#x02013;80 &#x003bc;m in depth from the liver surface. At around 120 hpf, liver vasculogenesis was almost complete and circulation was present in almost the entire liver when measured in left and right liver lobes.</p><fig position="float" id="F4"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><p><bold>Assessment of blood circulation in the developing liver of zebrafish</bold>.

To fill this gap, we re-evaluated liver morphogenesis in the zebrafish by focusing mainly on late events. We generated a two-color transgenic zebrafish line, LiPan, that expresses dsRed RFP specifically in the liver and GFP specifically in the exocrine pancreas to observe how liver growth is coordinated with that of pancreas during development in live embryos/larvae and adult zebrafish. The expression patterns of the two reporter genes are essentially identical to a combination of expression patterns in the two previously reported transgenic lines, <italic>Tg(lfabp:egfp) </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>] and <italic>Tg(elaA:egfp) </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>], both of which express only GFP in the liver and exocrine pancreas respectively. The LiPan zebrafish expresses two distinct fluorescent proteins markers with high intensity, rendering it an excellent experimental tool for detailed analysis of liver and pancreas organogenesis.</p><p>While morphological investigation of visceral organs in larvae and adult fish is often difficult due to similar colors of most of internal organs, the LiPan larvae and adults offer a convenient way to discern not only the liver and pancreas but also other internal organs due to the exclusion of the two fluorescent organs. Liver occupies the cranial region of the body cavity and the exocrine pancreas by and large occupies the posterior region of this cavity. It is clear that zebrafish, unlike some other fish, have separated and distinct liver and pancreas organs and do not form hepatopancreas (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. We consistently observed the formation of three distinct liver lobes: the first, left lobe forms at ~80 hpf; the second, right lobe at ~96 hpf, and the third, ventral lobe at 15&#x02013;20 dpf during liver growth phase (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>).

These transgenic lines in combination with <italic>cloche </italic>mutant and Tnnt2 morphants, allowed us to investigate developmental mechanisms involved in liver vasculogenesis. Strong RFP expression in hepatocytes and GFP expression in ECs allowed the observation of the dynamic process of vasculogenesis in the liver from discrete ECs around the liver bud to the formation of functional sinusoids. Our study showed the dynamic formation of sinusoidal network in zebrafish liver and revealed some similarities and differences in liver vasculogenesis between zebrafish and other vertebrates.</p><p>Based upon morphological characteristics, liver development in zebrafish has been separated into two phases, budding (24&#x02013;50 hpf) and growth (after 50 hpf). Hepatocytes differentiation takes place at the end of liver budding phase and before growth phase and <italic>lfabp </italic>is the molecular marker specific to fully differentiated hepatocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. It has been previously shown that ECs are adjacent to, but not encasing, the liver bud at 48 hpf [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. In our current <italic>in vivo </italic>analyses, we found that during avascular growth stage, discrete ECs rim the liver bud completely and then physically interact with hepatocytes prior to blood vessels formation similar to that in mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. In mouse <italic>Vegfr2/Flk-1</italic><sup>-/- </sup>embryos that lack mature ECs, the multi-layered liver epithelia forms but later fail to grow [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. In zebrafish <italic>cloche </italic>mutant embryos, which lack ECs, the size of liver was found to be comparable to that of wild type siblings during avascular growth stage up to 55 hpf and the growth of liver was arrested during vascular stage (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7B, C</xref>). It appears that the role of ECs during liver morphogenesis is conserved among vertebrates since ECs in both zebrafish and mice provide a crucial growth stimulus to the hepatic tissue before formation and function of local vessels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. Previous observation of liver development in the <italic>cloche </italic>mutant was limited to 48 hpf due to an increased severity of the cardiac edema [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. Using live LiPan/<italic>cloche </italic>mutant we were able to analyze liver development at later time points. This study showed that during endothelium-dependent growth stage, the size of liver in <italic>cloche </italic>mutants was significantly reduced compared to that in controls and supported the previous hypothesis that the liver of <italic>cloche </italic>mutant may be affected during growth phase if the endothelium is important for liver development in zebrafish [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. Furthermore, we also showed that at the cellular level, liver morphogenesis in <italic>cloche </italic>mutant was also affected and a prominent daisy pattern of hepatocytes was absent.</p><p>To eliminate the possibility that the arrest of liver growth in <italic>cloche </italic>mutants was due to the lack of blood circulation that may transport certain factors required for liver growth, we analyzed Tnnt2 morphants that lack blood circulation. In contrast to the reduced and unorganized liver in <italic>cloche </italic>mutants, the size of liver and the pattern of ECs and hepatocytes interaction in Tnnt2 morphants embryos were similar to that of wild type siblings during both avascular and endothelium-dependent.growth stages. Thus, ECs in zebrafish may provide some morphogenic signals important not only for liver growth but also for structural organization of hepatocytes.</p><p>Despite similarities there are some differences in liver development between zebrafish and mice. In mice, where the liver is an early hematopoietic organ, endothelial-endoderm interaction is initiated during the early phase of liver budding, whereas in zebrafish this interaction starts much later and during the growth phase. Moreover, mouse homozygous mutant <italic>Flk-1</italic><sup>-/- </sup>allele causes embryonic lethality by E10.5 (1 day after initiation of hepatocytes migration into the surrounding septum transversum mesenchyma) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>], but homozygous <italic>cloche </italic>mutants lacking ECs survive 6 days (almost 4 days after initiation of liver vasculogenesis). This time of development (5&#x02013;6 dpf) corresponds with the appearance of the adult form of the heart and the transition from diffusive to convective oxygen supply.</p><p>In mice and human, ECs provide stimuli for hepatocytes to outgrow towards septum transversum mesenchyme [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. Previously it has been proposed that vasculogenesis in zebrafish is achieved by endothelial invasion of liver [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. In contrast, our data suggested that both ECs and liver grow towards each other. As ECs rim the liver completely and contact seemingly less associated surface layers of hepatocytes, the liver extends simultaneously, effectively moving hepatocytes towards endothelia. In mice, after growing into the septum transversum mesenchyme, hepatocytes organize around already formed sinusoids. In zebrafish, discrete ECs contact liver and then form nascent sinusoids. Formation of the daisy pattern of hepatocytes and nascent sinusoids proceeds at the same time. This interaction significantly changes the liver morphology, but molecular mechanisms underlying this developmental process remain to be elucidated.</p></sec><sec><title>Role of functional sinusoidal network for liver growth</title><p>After the initiation of blood flow in the first liver vessels, circulation became essential for further liver growth. From 72 to 120 hpf, the liver enlarges 8&#x02013;10 times in size. The developing sinusoidal network directly contributes to the increased liver volume. Before the initiation of blood circulation in the liver, the size of sinusoids is 5&#x02013;8 &#x003bc;m in diameter, while with the blood flow in the liver, sinusoids progressively increased in size up to 12&#x02013;16 &#x003bc;m. Before the initiation of circulation, liver size and its early structural organization depend on the presence of ECs. However, after its initiation, circulation becomes an essential factor for subsequent liver development and growth, as evident by comparative analyses of LiPan/<italic>Tg (fli1:EGFP)</italic><sup><italic>y</italic>1</sup>/Tnnt2 morphant and <italic>LiPan</italic>/<italic>Tg(fli1:EGFP)</italic><sup>y1</sup>/<italic>cloche </italic>mutant (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5J&#x02013;L</xref>). Therefore, the blood circulation stimulates development of the vascular network and this network remarkably enlarges liver size because of its own volume as well as delivery of nutrients to support liver growth by cell proliferation. Further analysis of mutants with defects of vascular patterning and vessels maintenance could uncover additional critical factors involved in liver vasculogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>].</p><p>The development of the hepatic vascular architecture is a multistep process through the interaction of the two tissues, hepatocytes of endodermal origin and endothelia of mesoderm origin. Further to the model on early liver development proposed by Field et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>], we, based on new observation of developmental events during the liver growth phase, proposed to divide the liver growth phase into three distinct stages: avascular growth as a transition to the growth phase, where ECs are not required and liver extended by proliferation of hepatocytes; endothelium-dependent growth, when liver grew due to proliferation of hepatocytes and ECs, and circulation-dependent growth stage, when the blood circulation stimulates development of the vascular network which increases liver size because of its own volume and releases nutrients to support cell growth and proliferation (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>). This model could be useful as a roadmap to design further experiments addressing the role of the key factors required for liver vasculature development, the functions of signaling pathways and interactions between them during intriguing events of liver vasculogenesis.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>In the present study, a two-color transgenic zebrafish line (LiPan) with RFP expression in the liver and GFP expression in the exocrine pancreas was generated and the LiPan line allowed us to analyze detailed liver development in live embryos and larvae. By crossing the LiPan line with <italic>Tg(fli1:EGFP)</italic><sup>y1</sup>, we found that liver vasculogenesis started at 55&#x02013;58 hpf when ECs first surrounded the hepatocytes from the liver bud surface and then invaded the liver to form sinusoids and later the vascular network. Fluorescence correction spectroscopy detected blood circulation in the liver first at ~72 hpf. Analysis of <italic>cloche </italic>mutants and Tnnt2 morphants led us to conclude that both ECs and blood circulation are required for continued liver growth and morphogenesis. Collectively, we propose to divide the growth phase of liver development in zebrafish into three distinct stages: avascular growth between 50&#x02013;55 hpf, where ECs are not required; endothelium-dependent growth, where ECs or sinusoids are required for liver growth from 55 hpf to 72 hpf before blood circulation in the liver sinusoids; circulation-dependent growth where the circulation is essential to maintain vascular network and to support the continued liver growth and morphogenesis after 72 hpf.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Zebrafish maintenance</title><p>Zebrafish were maintained in the fish facilities at the Department of Biological Sciences, National University of Singapore (NUS) and the Institute of Molecular and Cell Biology (IMCB) of Singapore according to established protocols [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>] and in compliance with Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) guidelines.

Autocorrelation functions are derived for different cases such as 3D diffusion and microfluidic flow, and the models can be used to fit the experimental data. The two-flow model to extract the diastolic and systolic blood flow velocity at the same blood vessel in zebrafish larva was developed and the detailed setup was described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. The blood flow velocity in the liver sinusoids of zebrafish larvae was obtained by FCS measurement at the points of interest after the confocal image acquisition which helps to locate the position of sinusoids in the liver. In this work, each larva was anesthetized with freshly prepared 0.05&#x02013;0.1 mg/ml Tricaine (ethyl m-aminoboenzoate, Sigma, Singapore) dissolved in egg water [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>], immobilized in 1.5% low-melting-temperature agarose (Invitrogen, Singapore) (agarose was dissolved in 0.05 mg/ml of Tricaine in egg water), in WillCo-dish<sup>&#x000ae; </sup>glass bottom dish (GW-3512, WillCo-Wells, The Netherlands), placed in a temperature-controlled environment and immediately proceed for measurements. For each larva, blood flow was measured in a trunk vessel as a control and then in the vessels of liver parenchyma at 7&#x02013;10 randomly selected points at different depths of liver tissue up to 80 &#x003bc;m. For each stage 3&#x02013;5 larvae were measured. With this technique, we were able to measure blood flow inside the liver parenchyma as deep as 70 &#x003bc;m from the liver surface.</p></sec><sec><title>Generation of double (LiPan) and triple [Tg(lfabf:ds-Red; elaA:EGFP; fli1: EGFP)] transgenic cloche mutants</title><p>To visualize vascular development in the liver in live embryos, LiPan homozygotes were mated with <italic>Tg(fli1:EGFP)</italic><sup>y1 </sup>homozygotes and triple transgenic embryos were generated.

The embedded embryos were oriented and sectioned with a cryostat microtome (10 &#x003bc;m thickness). For paraffin sections, the embryos and larvae were fixed with either 4% PFA in PBS or Bouin's fixative, followed by paraffin embedding and sectioning (4 &#x003bc;m).
