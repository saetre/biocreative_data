Overexpression of the mutant dynamin (dyn I K44A) resulted in increased shedding of the APP ectodomain (sAPP&#x003b1;), accumulation of the C-terminal &#x003b1;-secretase product C83, and a reduction in the release of A&#x003b2;. Levels of mature APP on the cell surface were increased in cells expressing dyn I K44A, and internalization of surface-immunolabeled APP, assessed by fluorescence microscopy, was inhibited. Dynamin is a substrate for protein kinase C (PKC), and it was hypothesized that activators of PKC, which are known to stimulate &#x003b1;-secretase-mediated cleavage of APP, might exert their effects by inhibiting dynamin-dependent endocytosis. However, the internalization of surface-biotinylated APP was unaffected by treatment of cells with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate in the presence of the &#x003b1;-secretase inhibitor TAPI-1.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>The results indicate that APP is internalized by a dynamin-dependent process, and suggest that alterations in the activity of proteins that mediate endocytosis might lead to significant changes in A&#x003b2; production.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>The amyloid precursor protein (APP) is a single-pass transmembrane protein that gives rise to the small peptides (known as A&#x003b2;) that form amyloid deposits in the brains of patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. A&#x003b2; peptides are generated by the successive cleavage of APP by proteases known respectively as &#x003b2;- and &#x003b3;-secretases. Alternatively, APP may be cleaved within the A&#x003b2; domain by &#x003b1;-secretases, now believed to be members of the disintegrin and metalloprotease (ADAM) family [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. This latter process precludes the formation of A&#x003b2;, and results in the shedding of a large soluble N-terminal fragment of APP (sAPP&#x003b1;) into the extracellular or intra-luminal space. Cleavage of APP by &#x003b1;-secretases may occur in a late compartment of the secretory pathway, or at the cell surface [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>].</p><p>APP ectodomain shedding occurs in both a constitutive and a regulated fashion. A key mediator of regulated shedding is protein kinase C (PKC), whether it is stimulated directly by phorbol esters, or as a consequence of the activation of receptors coupled to phosphoinositide turnover. Although the stimulation of APP shedding by PKC activators has been extensively documented [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>], the mechanism is still unclear. Direct phosphorylation of the APP intracellular domain is not required, since phorbol esters are still able to increase shedding of a C-terminally truncated form of APP, or of APP constructs in which serine or threonine residues in the cytoplasmic domain have been replaced with alanine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Likewise, C-terminal truncation of the putative &#x003b1;-secretase ADAM17/TACE (tumor necrosis factor-&#x003b1; converting enzyme) did not prevent up-regulation of its activity toward its substrate tumor necrosis factor-&#x003b1; (TNF&#x003b1;) by phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. On the other hand, phorbol ester-regulated cleavage of TrkA by TACE was found to be dependent, in part, on phosphorylation of threonine 735 within the TACE cytoplasmic domain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. Thus, phosphorylation of ADAM proteases may modulate their activity, at least toward certain substrates.</p><p>PKC-mediated effects on vesicular trafficking might also affect APP processing. A study showing that PKC activation increases the formation of APP-containing secretory vesicles from the trans-Golgi network [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>], suggested that accelerated trafficking of APP to the cell surface might underlie the increase in sAPP&#x003b1; release induced by PKC. Alternatively, inhibition of endocytosis could increase sAPP&#x003b1; release by prolonging the interaction of APP with secretases on the cell surface. APP is found within clathrin-coated vesicles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>], which mediate the internalization of many cell surface proteins. Clathrin-dependent endocytosis is regulated by the high-molecular weight GTPase dynamin, which forms oligomeric rings around the neck of the forming vesicle, and severs it from the plasma membrane [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. Dynamin activity, in turn, is reportedly governed by PKC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>], raising the possibility that PKC might modulate internalization, and therefore secretory cleavage, of APP, via an effect on endocytosis.</p><p>The aims of the present study were two-fold: to examine the effects of an inhibitor of dynamin function on APP processing, and to determine if PKC activation stimulates APP shedding via inhibition of endocytosis. Overexpression of a dominant negative dynamin mutant in HEK cells co-transfected with APP<sub>695 </sub>increased surface expression of APP and release of sAPP&#x003b1;, while inhibiting the internalization of full-length APP. The dynamin mutant also increased formation of C83, the C-terminal stub generated by &#x003b1;-secretase-mediated cleavage of APP, and reduced the release of A&#x003b2; peptides. These results contrast with a recent study, in which induction of dominant negative dynamin (dyn I K44A) increased both sAPP&#x003b1; release and A&#x003b2; formation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. Although activation of PKC by treatment with the phorbol ester PMA stimulates shedding of the APP ectodomain, PMA had no effect on the internalization of surface-biotinylated APP. Our observations provide direct evidence that APP internalization is a dynamin-dependent process. Moreover, the results indicate that activators of PKC do not promote sAPP&#x003b1; release via inhibition of endocytosis.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Ectodomain shedding of APP is increased in cells transfected with dyn I K44A</title><p>The GTPase dynamin is an important mediator of clathrin-dependent endocytosis and synaptic vesicle recycling, and is required for the internalization of many cell surface proteins, including growth factor and G-protein coupled receptors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. To determine if dynamin regulates the internalization of APP, HEK-M3 cells were transiently transfected with APP<sub>695 </sub>and either an empty vector or a plasmid encoding the dominant-negative dynamin mutant dyn I K44A, which is deficient in GTP binding and GTPase activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. The APP<sub>695 </sub>isoform was used for these transfection studies, since it is not expressed by HEK cells; and can be distinguished on western blots from the longer endogenous APP isoforms. Cells transfected with empty vectors alone were used as additional controls. Levels of sAPP&#x003b1; in the medium, and cellular full-length APP, were detected by western blotting using 6E10 antibodies, and antibodies to the APP C-terminus (APP-CT), respectively. The expression of endogenous dynamin, assessed using an antibody that recognizes both dynamin I and dynamin II isoforms, was low in cells transfected with APP<sub>695 </sub>or empty vector, and robust overexpression of the mutant protein was observed in cells transfected with the plasmid encoding dyn I K44A (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>, lower panel). Dynamin I is neuron-specific, whereas dynamin II is widely expressed. The immunoreactive band present in cells that were not transfected with the dynamin plasmid presumably represents dynamin II, since no signal was detectable when lysates from these cells were immunoblotted with antibodies specific for dynamin I (not shown). An increase of approximately five-fold in the release of endogenous and transfected sAPP&#x003b1; from cells transfected with dyn I K44A was observed (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>, upper panel, and Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>). Levels of cellular full-length APP were also increased in cells expressing the dynamin mutant (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>, middle panel). Quantitation of the band comprising mature cellular APP<sub>695 </sub>and immature endogenous APP (APP<sub>endo</sub>) showed that levels in the presence of the mutant dynamin increased to 2.86 &#x000b1; 0.97-fold control levels (mean &#x000b1; SEM, n = 3). Overnight treatment of APP<sub>695 </sub>transfectants with the lysosomal protease inhibitor chloroquine (50 &#x003bc;M) increased levels of this band to a similar extent (to 2.30 &#x000b1; 0.02-fold control, mean &#x000b1; SEM from 3 experiments).</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Release of sAPP&#x003b1; is increased by dyn I K44A overexpression. </bold>HEK-M3 cells were transiently transfected with APP<sub>695 </sub>and dyn I K44A or empty vector.

The corresponding &#x003b2;-secretase product C99 was not detectable under these conditions. Levels of C83 were significantly increased in cells transfected with dyn I K44A, relative to levels in cells transfected with empty vector alone (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2C</xref>), consistent with the increase in ectodomain shedding observed in cells expressing the dynamin mutant.</p></sec><sec><title>Internalization of APP is inhibited in cells transfected with dyn I K44A</title><p>Our results can be interpreted to suggest that overexpression of dyn I K44A inhibits endocytosis of APP. The increase in cellular levels of APP observed in cells expressing the mutant dynamin, accordingly, could be the result of decreased internalization and degradation of full-length APP (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>), and indeed, the lysosomal protease inhibitor chloroquine exerted a similar effect. However, it could also be argued that the increases in APP surface expression and shedding caused by the dynamin mutant were secondary to elevations in APP expression. Therefore, in order to directly examine the effect of dynamin on APP endocytosis, APP internalization in living cells was assessed using an immuno-labeling assay. Live HEK cells stably overexpressing APP<sub>695 </sub>were incubated at 4&#x000b0;C with 6E10 antibodies, in order to label cell surface APP. The cells were washed and warmed to 37&#x000b0;C for various intervals, and then fixed, permeabilized, and stained with Alexa 488-conjugated secondary antibodies. In cells that were labeled on ice and then fixed and stained prior to warming, APP was largely confined to the plasma membrane (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>, 0 min). After 10 minutes at 37&#x000b0;C, most of the immunofluorescence was contained within intracellular punctuate structures distributed throughout the cytoplasm, indicating that surface APP had moved into an endosomal compartment. By 60 minutes, the immunofluorescent signal representing internalized APP had for the most part coalesced at a perinuclear site (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>). Only background fluorescence was observed in cells that were incubated with antibodies to paxillin, an intracellular protein (not shown). APP internalization was next determined in these cells 48 hours after the cultures were transiently transfected with dyn I K44A. The cells were surface-labeled with 6E10 antibodies, and incubated at 37&#x000b0;C for 10 minutes. They were then fixed, permeabilized, and stained with Alexa 488-conjugated anti-mouse IgG to detect APP. Dynamin I expression was assessed by co-staining cells with goat anti-dynamin I antibodies followed by Alexa 594-conjugated anti-goat IgG. Immunoblot analysis of cell lysates confirmed that this antibody, which is specific for dynamin I, does not detect endogenous dynamin in non-transfected cells (not shown). In cells expressing the mutant dynamin I (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref>, right panel), APP immunoreactivity was restricted to the cell surface (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref>, left panel), whereas untransfected cells within the same culture exhibited a punctate pattern of APP immunofluorescence indicative of internalization (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref>, arrows). These results provide direct evidence that dyn I K44A inhibits endocytosis of APP.</p><fig position="float" id="F3"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p><bold>APP internalization is inhibited in cells transfected with dyn I K44A. </bold>A.

To address this question, the effect of the PKC activator PMA on APP internalization in HEK cells stably overexpressing APP<sub>695 </sub>was determined using reversible surface biotinylation. Shedding was inhibited by incubating cells with the &#x003b1;-secretase inhibitor TAPI-1 for 1 hour prior to biotinylation. Cells were surface-biotinylated while on ice, then incubated at 37&#x000b0;C in DMEM containing TAPI-1 and either PMA (1 &#x003bc;M) or the vehicle dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) for varying periods of time. Media and cell lysates were collected and processed as described (see "Methods"). As a control for stripping efficiency, some cultures were biotinylated and stripped while remaining on ice (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5A</xref>). Despite the presence of TAPI-1, there was a slight, but detectable, time-dependent increase of biotinylated sAPP&#x003b1;<sub>695 </sub>in the medium. This was not affected by PMA, indicating that TAPI-1 effectively blocked the signal-dependent release of APP (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5B</xref>, upper panel). Levels of internalized biotinylated APP declined over the 60 minute incubation period, consistent with the degradation of internalized APP, or the removal of the biotin label in an endocytic compartment. APP internalization was not significantly altered by the presence of PMA (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5B</xref>, middle panel, and 5C).

Moreover, shedding of the ectodomain is a prerequisite for cleavage of the intracellular domain by &#x003b3;-secretases; a process that liberates a C-terminal fragment with transcriptional activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. Although the up-regulation of APP shedding by activation of PKC-dependent signaling pathways has been well-documented [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>], the mechanism mediating this response is still obscure.</p><p>The present study was undertaken to determine if inhibitors of dynamin function would affect ectodomain shedding of APP. We first showed that APP internalization is dependent on the activity of dynamin, a large molecular weight GTPase that mediates both clathrin-dependent endocytosis, and internalization of caveolae, by promoting the separation of endocytic vesicles from the plasma membrane [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. In confirmation of a recent study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>], we found that overexpression of a dominant negative dynamin mutant protein in HEK cells increased surface expression of full-length APP, and release of sAPP&#x003b1;. Thus, although cleavage of APP by &#x003b1;-secretases occurs largely in an intracellular compartment in many cell types (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]), our results suggest that inhibition of dynamin function, by preventing internalization of APP, increases its dwell-time on the cell surface, and prolongs its interaction with &#x003b1;-secretases at the plasma membrane. Similar elevations in APP secretion are induced by mutations of the APP cytoplasmic domain that inhibit internalization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. Consistent with the observed increase in &#x003b1;-secretase mediated cleavage, expression of the dynamin mutant increased cellular levels of C83, the C-terminal stub remaining after &#x003b1;-secretase-mediated cleavage of APP (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2C</xref>).</p><p>The increase in sAPP&#x003b1; release in HEK cells overexpressing dyn I K44A was associated with a reduction in the release of A&#x003b2;<sub>1&#x02013;40</sub>, (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>), a result in keeping with reports that A&#x003b2; is generated in an endocytic compartment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. Our results are also in agreement with a study by Ehehalt et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>] who found that overexpression of a dyn K44A mutant protein reduced formation of the A&#x003b2; peptide in mouse neuroblastoma N2a cells. In contrast, Chyung and Selkoe reported that A&#x003b2; generation was increased in HeLa cells following induction of dyn K44A expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. The increased A&#x003b2; formation observed in the latter study occurred in the absence of any alteration in the synthesis or maturation of APP, and suggested that, in HeLa cells, processing of APP by &#x003b2;- and &#x003b3;-secretases occurs at the plasma membrane [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. Indeed, an active &#x003b3;-secretase complex was subsequently isolated from the plasma membrane of HeLa cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. As a possible explanation for the reduction in A&#x003b2; observed by Ehehalt et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>] in cells overexpressing dyn K44A, Chyung and Selkoe pointed out that those workers measured formation of radiolabeled A&#x003b2; in cells labeled for 1 hour with [<sup>35</sup>S]methionine, and surmised that the mutant dynamin reduced generation of labeled A&#x003b2; by increasing the amount of unlabeled APP at the cell surface, and diluting the concentration of labeled precursor available for cleavage by &#x003b2;- and &#x003b3;-secretases. In support of the notion that A&#x003b2; can be generated at the cell surface, Ehehalt et al [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>] showed that when endocytosis was blocked by transfection with dyn K44A, the reduction in A&#x003b2; could be partially rescued by antibody cross-linking of APP and the &#x003b2;-secretase, &#x003b2;-site APP-cleaving enzyme (BACE). The decrease in total A&#x003b2;<sub>1&#x02013;40 </sub>generation in HEK cells overexpressing dyn I K44A described in the present report might simply reflect reductions in the precursor pool due to increased cleavage of APP by &#x003b1;-secretase. This result is consistent with earlier studies showing that upregulation of &#x003b1;-secretase cleavage by PKC activation in HEK cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>], or via mutations of the APP cytoplasmic domain in stably transfected HEK or Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>], is associated with decreased A&#x003b2; formation. The discrepancies among these studies might be due at least in part to cell-specific differences in the compartments where APP comes into contact with &#x003b1;- and &#x003b2;/&#x003b3;-secretases, or in the relative capacities of the different secretases to cleave APP within a specific compartment.</p><p>Modulation of endocytosis might represent a mechanism for physiological regulation of APP processing by PKC-dependent signaling pathways. PKC phosphorylates dynamin, thereby activating its GTPase activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>], and inhibiting its association with phospholipids in vitro [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. In nerve terminals, dynamin must be dephosphorylated in order to promote retrieval of synaptic vesicles following exocytosis, and re-phosphorylation is required for the next round of endocytosis that follows a second stimulus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. Persistent phosphorylation of dynamin might therefore be predicted to interfere with endocytosis. Contrary to expectation, the PKC activator PMA did not affect the rate of APP internalization, as determined by reversible biotinylation in the presence of the &#x003b1;-secretase inhibitor TAPI-1 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>). Thus, although PKC activation can modulate endocytosis of a variety of transmembrane proteins, either positively, in the case of &#x003b2;1 integrin, GABA receptors, and the dopamine transporter [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>], or negatively, as is the case with &#x003bc;-opioid receptors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>], we could not find evidence for a modulatory effect of phorbol esters on APP internalization. Others have shown that PKC activation increases APP ectodomain shedding in PC12 cells by stimulating trafficking of APP through the secretory pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. In contrast, surface expression of APP was reduced in CHO cells that were surface biotinylated following treatment with PMA and TAPI, suggesting that in these cells, PMA did not increase trafficking of APP to the plasma membrane, but possibly stimulated &#x003b1;-secretase-mediated cleavage within an intracellular compartment that was partially resistant to TAPI [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>]. Interestingly, the motor neuron-derived trophic factor neuregulin-1, a ligand for the tyrosine kinase receptors ErbB3 and ErbB4, was found to increase the rate of internalization and degradation of APP in cultured myotubes, while decreasing release of the ectodomain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>]. This report lends credence to the hypothesis that modulation of APP internalization may represent a physiological mechanism for regulation of sAPP&#x003b1; release.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Our results show that experimental manipulations that interfere with the function of the endocytic machinery can inhibit APP internalization, and shift APP proteolysis to a non-amyloidogenic pathway, in HEK cells. In HeLa cells, in contrast, an interfering dynamin mutant increased both &#x003b1;-secretase cleavage of APP and A&#x003b2; formation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>], suggesting that cell-specific differences in APP metabolism may influence the consequences of altered endocytosis. The levels of a number of proteins important for clathrin-mediated recycling of synaptic vesicles, including dynamin, and the clathrin assembly-mediating adapter proteins AP2 and AP180, are reduced in the brains of AD patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>]. Moreover, exposure of neurons to A&#x003b2; in vitro was recently reported to reduce dynamin levels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>]. It is therefore possible that alterations in clathrin-mediated endocytosis play a role in the abnormal metabolism of APP that is characteristic of AD. Finally, given the putative role of APP as a cell surface signaling molecule in the brain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>], it is important to consider the possibility that alterations in APP endocytosis may contribute to the pathologic process by disrupting the normal signaling function of APP.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec sec-type="materials"><title>Materials</title><p>Antibodies and other reagents were obtained from the following sources: 6E10 antibodies to sAPP&#x003b1; from Signet Laboratories (Dedham, MA), antibodies to the C-terminus of APP (APP-CT) from Zymed Labs (San Francisco, CA), anti-dynamin monoclonal antibodies from BD Biosciences (San Diego, CA), goat polyclonal antibodies specific for dynamin I from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA), and goat anti-mouse IgG and goat anti-rabbit IgG peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies from BioRad (Hercules CA).
