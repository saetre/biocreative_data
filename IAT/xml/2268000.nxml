In response to growth factors and cAMP, ER&#x003b1; primarily activates and represses genes, respectively. The combined treatments with the anti-estrogen tamoxifen and cAMP or growth factors regulate yet other sets of genes. In many cases, tamoxifen is perverted to an agonist, potentially mimicking what is happening in certain tamoxifen-resistant breast tumors and emphasizing the importance of the cellular signaling environment. Using a computational analysis, we predicted that a Hox protein might be involved in mediating such combinatorial effects, and then confirmed it experimentally. Although both tamoxifen and cAMP block the proliferation of MCF7 cells, their combined application stimulates it, and this can be blocked with a dominant-negative Hox mutant.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions/Significance</title><p>The activating signal dictates both target gene selection and regulation by ER&#x003b1;, and this has consequences on global gene expression patterns that may be relevant to understanding the progression of ER&#x003b1;-dependent carcinomas.</p></sec></abstract><counts><page-count count="11"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>In reproductive tissues, estrogens and peptide growth factors (GFs) are mitogenic and play important roles in the normal and aberrant development.

Overexpression or activation of the EGF receptor ErbB2 (also known as HER2 and Neu) or activation of MEKK1 has been shown to lead to resistance to the anti-estrogen tamoxifen in cell culture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001859-Benz1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001859-Shou1">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref>, see also ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001859-Lavinsky1">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref>).

Indeed, higher levels of cAMP-binding proteins were isolated from breast tumor samples that were resistant to endocrine therapy, compared with those that were not, suggesting the presence of a very active cAMP/PKA pathway <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001859-Miller1">&#x0005b;31&#x0005d;</xref>.

ER&#x003b1;-signaling can be blocked with the pure anti-estrogen ICI 182,780 (ICI), and therefore combining it with cAMP or EGF/IGF-I should specifically affect ER&#x003b1;-dependent genes, including those regulated by cAMP or GFs.

The genes appear to organize into 8 unique clusters, labelled I&#x02013;VIII. Cluster I represents genes that are independently induced by E2 and GFs and repressed by ICI alone. Repression by the sole treatment with ICI suggests that these are genes with a strong ER&#x003b1; basal activity. Cluster II differs from I by the fact there is no difference in the ICI-only sample and hence no basal ER&#x003b1; activity. The behavior of the genes in cluster III is similar to those of cluster I, differing only in the absolute expression values. Cluster IV represents genes that, by and large, are not significantly induced by E2 (if at all), unaffected in the ICI-only sample but induced by GFs in an ER&#x003b1;-dependent fashion. Cluster V corresponds to GF-induced genes most heavily affected by ICI treatment, i.e. the genes with the strongest dependence on ER&#x003b1; for induction. In contrast to clusters I&#x02013;V, clusters VI&#x02013;VIII collectively correspond to genes that are repressed by GF treatment and derepressed by ICI. Cluster VI includes genes with a significant difference in the ICI-only sample, whereas cluster VII does not. However, both VI and VII contain genes that are repressed by E2. Cluster VIII resembles IV in that neither E2 nor ICI-alone affects expression. Clusters IV and VIII are examples of genes that are regulated by ER&#x003b1; exclusively upon activation by GFs and not by E2.</p><fig id="pone-0001859-g003" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0001859.g003</object-id><label>Figure 3</label><caption><title>Ligand-independent ER&#x003b1;-mediated gene expression profiles.</title><p>(A) Log expression ratios of the ICI-affected GF-regulated (65 genes) and cAMP regulated (28 genes) gene sets at the top and bottom, respectively.

Cluster I is the largest of the classes, accounting for half of the genes in this set, and representing genes that are repressed by cAMP in an ER&#x003b1;-dependent way but not affected by E2. Much like for clusters IV and VIII from the GF gene set, ER&#x003b1; appears to be required but not sufficient to regulate these genes, at least in the presence of E2. Cluster II represents genes that are repressed by both E2 and cAMP. In contrast, cluster III corresponds to genes that are induced by both E2 and cAMP. The gene <italic>RAFTLIN</italic> (double asterisk) is the only example of a gene for which E2 had no effect and yet cAMP induced it in a partially ER&#x003b1;-dependent fashion.

Thus, in addition to studying the genomic effects of ligand-independent activation of ER&#x003b1;, we wished to understand how signaling crosstalk can influence the intrinsic agonistic or antagonistic activities of OHT at the genomic level. We defined an OHT-coregulated gene (as opposed to a gene that is affected by OHT alone) as one where OHT-cotreatment resulted in an expression difference of at least 1.3-fold compared to cAMP/GFs alone. However, if a gene exhibited the same behavior in the OHT-alone sample as in the cotreatment sample, then it was filtered out and not further considered in the analysis. In addition, in order not to confuse, for instance, inverse agonism with antagonism, the cotreatment sample genes were filtered out if they behaved in the opposite fashion in the presence of E2. This was the case, for example, for genes that are repressed by E2 but induced by the addition of both OHT and cAMP or GF. Although we cannot formally exclude the possibility that some OHT (or E2) signaling effects in MCF7 cells were mediated by ER&#x003b1;-independent pathways such as those regulated by GPR30, the focus on genes differentially affected by the combined treatments of OHT with cAMP or GFs (based on the &#x0201c;filtering&#x0201d; mentioned above) would tend to exclude a major contribution of those. Moreover, preliminary results from profiling GPR30-mediated gene expression changes in response to OHT indicate an entirely different set of target genes than the ones studied here (Deo Prakash Pandey, Marcello Maggiolini, and DP, unpublished results).</p><p>OHT was found to coregulate 80 genes in concert with cAMP compared to only 28 genes with GFs (Supporting Information <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0001859.s007">Table S4</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001859-g004">Figure 4B</xref>). This was an unexpected finding considering the proportion of genes that cAMP and GFs regulate when applied separately, and might suggest that cAMP is significantly more effective than GFs at modulating OHT activity. A cluster analysis of these genes is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001859-g004">Figure 4A</xref>. To highlight the importance of filtering out those genes that display the same behavior with OHT alone, this analysis, as an exception, still includes them. There is remarkably little overlap between the responses to these different treatments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001859-g004">Figure 4B</xref>), illustrating a crosstalk-specific agonistic activity for OHT that differs substantially from its intrinsic agonistic activity. It should be noted that the term agonist is used here to denote a ligand, OHT, that turns on ER&#x003b1; activity above its basal activity, irrespective of whether it then acts as a repressor or an activator of transcription. Genes where OHT showed the strongest agonistic activity are illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001859-g004">Figure 4C</xref>, and are shown separately for both crosstalk signals. Interestingly, there was a small group of genes in the original set of 108 OHT-coregulated genes (80 coregulated with cAMP plus 28 coregulated with GFs) that exhibited the intriguing behavior of opposing responses when comparing the two crosstalk signals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001859-g004">Figure 4C</xref>). Whereas OHT induces the expression of <italic>HSPB8</italic>, <italic>GREB1</italic> and <italic>CXCL12</italic> in the cAMP-treated sample, it represses it in the GF-treated sample.

We hypothesized that the regulation of the ER&#x003b1;-dependent/cAMP-regulated genes might be explained by a simple combinatorial code of transcription factor co-recruitment that could be detected by analyzing the promoter/enhancer regions of these genes.

Of the 28 unique transcripts that were cAMP-regulated and affected by ICI treatment (ER&#x003b1;-dependent) in our microarray data set, 21 were identifiable genes whose promoter sequences could be downloaded and analyzed. These sequences were scanned with ModelInspector for matches to a predefined library of functional promoter modules. A &#x0201c;module&#x0201d; is defined by a combination of two to three specific transcription factor binding sites, their order, strand orientation and distance range. The best scoring 2-element and 3-element transcription factor binding sites (modules) are illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001859-g005">Figure 5</xref>. Most importantly, no single 2-element or 3-element module was found to occur in all promoters from either the upregulated or repressed group of genes.

Only the <italic>MITF</italic> promoter contained all three modules. In the cAMP-repressed group, fewer common 3-element modules were uncovered than in the cAMP-induced group (3 versus 8), despite there being significantly more promoters to scan; this may reflect a more robust functional conservation of the respective promoters.

Neither overexpression of dnPax5 nor dnCREB blocked cAMP/OHT-induced proliferation. dnCREB even slightly promoted proliferation, possibly because CREB is the target and mediator of the anti-proliferative cAMP pathway. In contrast, overexpression of dnHox significantly inhibited cAMP/OHT-induced proliferation whereas it had no effect on E2-induced proliferation. dnHox was derived from HoxD13, but since it essentially only contains the homeodomain, we expect it to function as a dominant-negative mutant for many homeodomain-containing transcription factors. Thus, these results suggest that an as yet unidentified homeodomain-containing transcription factor is a mediator of the cAMP/OHT-induced proliferation of MCF7 cells.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Discussion</title><p>The key finding of our comparative microarray analysis is that cAMP, growth factors and estrogen elicit vastly different transcriptional responses, both at the level of the whole genome and, perhaps more remarkably, of ER&#x003b1;-dependent genes. Thus, depending on how ER&#x003b1; is activated, it regulates largely different sets of genes. Another unexpected finding is that ER&#x003b1; primarily represses genes in response to cAMP despite the fact that this particular response was originally characterized with a reporter gene that monitors activation. Although a large number of microarray studies that focused on ER&#x003b1; and/or breast cancer cells had been reported (for example, refs. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001859-Cunliffe1">&#x0005b;33&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001859-Hewitt1">&#x0005b;39&#x0005d;</xref>), these aspects had been missed. Our analysis uniquely concentrated on signaling crosstalk with ER&#x003b1;, notably its ligand-independent activation, and on the agonistic effects of OHT in the presence of additional extracellular signals, which at least in part are also mediated by ER&#x003b1;.</p><sec id="s3a"><title>ER&#x003b1;-dependent gene expression and signaling crosstalk</title><p>Among the ER&#x003b1;-dependent groups of genes with varied behavior, clusters IV and VIII from the GF sample and cluster I from the cAMP sample are extremely interesting. They represent genes whose regulation by GFs or cAMP requires ER&#x003b1;, but for which the cognate ligand E2 has no effect. This is strong evidence that cAMP and GFs are activating ER&#x003b1; in a ligand-independent manner. Moreover, it argues that ligand-independent activation can lead to a specific gene expression response, which differs markedly from the hormone-dependent response. The ligand-independent response also varies depending on the source of the signal, since there is virtually no overlap between the ER&#x003b1;-dependent genes regulated by cAMP and those regulated by GFs. Indeed, to our surprise, among the 96 unique transcripts that were ER&#x003b1;-dependent in the crosstalk samples, only one gene, <italic>TFF1(pS2)</italic>, appeared in both the cAMP and GF group (see also top panel in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001859-g005">Figure 5</xref>). This supports the idea that cAMP and GF-signaling lead to different ER&#x003b1;-dependent outcomes, and suggests that two distinct ligand-independent mechanisms of activation are at play.</p><p>Moreover, there are interesting differences between the two signaling crosstalk responses. For instance, there is not a single example of an ICI-affected gene that is repressed by E2 and induced by GFs (or vice versa). When E2/GF-regulation requires ER&#x003b1;, it appears to be always unidirectional. This does not seem to be the case with E2/cAMP regulation. <italic>LMCD1</italic>, for instance, is weakly induced with E2 alone, but repressed by cAMP, and yet, both responses require ER&#x003b1;. Another difference between the two ligand-independent responses is the relative distribution of induction and repression of gene expression. Whereas GFs activate ER&#x003b1; primarily to induce gene expression, it appears that cAMP activates ER&#x003b1; to repress the expression of genes. Unfortunately, still relatively little is known about how E2-liganded ER&#x003b1; represses genes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001859-Chadwick1">&#x0005b;47&#x0005d;</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001859-Nettles1">&#x0005b;49&#x0005d;</xref>. Hence, it is difficult to begin to speculate about the molecular mechanisms.</p><p>A first indication about the underlying molecular mechanisms that direct signal-specific responses comes from a recent study by Surmacz and colleagues <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001859-Cascio1">&#x0005b;50&#x0005d;</xref>. Using chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments, they found that different coactivator complexes are assembled on two selected ER&#x003b1; target genes in response to E2 or IGF-I. The nature of these complexes was both signal-dependent and influenced by whether ER&#x003b1; was recruited to the target gene directly through an estrogen response element or indirectly through another transcription factor (AP1). Taken together with our own genomic analysis, this argues that different signals activate ER&#x003b1; to do different things, either on different genes or even on the same gene. At the molecular level, this means that ER&#x003b1; assembles different coactivator (or corepressor) complexes as a function of target gene and activating signal. It is also conceivable that different signals already direct ER&#x003b1; to different target genes. Future experiments will address these mechanistic aspects as well as the physiological consequences of these signal-specific responses.</p><p>Our findings seem to contradict those found by the only other microarray study that specifically looked at ER&#x003b1;/GF signaling crosstalk, and which concluded that the GF response is not altered by the deletion of the ER&#x003b1; gene in the mouse <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001859-Hewitt1">&#x0005b;39&#x0005d;</xref>.

Nevertheless, our analysis further illustrates that studying the effects of OHT on gene transcription in isolation may not yield an accurate picture of its biological activity <italic>in vivo</italic> and highlights the importance of considering the cellular signaling environment as a whole when interpreting such results.</p><p>The computational analysis of signal-specific ER&#x003b1; target gene sets did not reveal a single common transcription factor framework that could reliably explain or predict the observed genetic behavior. This may indicate a multi-layered complexity that would require further experimentation to separate. Despite this, several highly specific promoter modules containing three transcription factor binding sites separated by a specific distance with a specific strand orientation were found in ER&#x003b1; target genes differentially regulated by cAMP. Three modules were revealed that contain highly conserved Hox, Pax5 and CREB transcription factor binding sites. We addressed the physiological significance of this <italic>in silico</italic> association with a MCF7 proliferation assay. It was known that elevation of cAMP suppresses E2-dependent proliferation of MCF7 cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001859-Vintermyr1">&#x0005b;44&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001859-AlDhaheri1">&#x0005b;46&#x0005d;</xref>, but not of tamoxifen-resistant MCF7-LCC2 cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001859-AlDhaheri1">&#x0005b;46&#x0005d;</xref>. We observed that cAMP in combination with OHT promotes the proliferation of MCF7 cells, albeit at less than 50&#x00025; the effectiveness of estrogen. This is the first time that the potentially adverse consequences of cAMP signaling crosstalk for endocrine therapy are recapitulated by augmenting cAMP levels in tissue culture, and not just for the activation of one or two ER&#x003b1; target genes. It confirms a previous report that showed a similar growth stimulation by knocking down expression of a regulatory subunit of PKA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001859-Michalides1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>. Furthermore, overexpression of a dominant-negative Hox protein, harboring only the homeodomain, was sufficient to block this cAMP/OHT-induced proliferation. This result implicates a homedomain-containing transcription factor as a transcriptional facilitator of OHT-agonism. By &#x0201c;facilitator&#x0201d; we mean that the Hox protein(s) could be required to allow the regulation of genes required for proliferation by ER&#x003b1; in the presence of cAMP and OHT. This does not need to involve any kind of direct interaction between a Hox protein and ER&#x003b1;, but instead the Hox protein might merely prepare a promoter or enhancer for regulation by ER&#x003b1;. Although the computational analysis strongly suggests some kind of functional interaction, it is formally conceivable that a Hox protein acts through an unrelated (ER&#x003b1;-independent) gene in the presence of cAMP to synergize with OHT. Such mechanistic questions will be addressed most efficiently once the Hox protein(s) will have been identified. It will also be interesting to evaluate whether a direct phosphorylation of this Hox protein(s) by PKA, as is known for the paradigmatic PKA-regulated transcription factor CREB <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001859-Siu1">&#x0005b;53&#x0005d;</xref>, contributes an additional layer of regulatory complexity.</p><p>Hox proteins are a large family of transcription factors.
