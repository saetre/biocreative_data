Epstein&#x02013;Barr virus (EBV) encodes 23 miRNAs of unknown function. Here we show that the EBV-encoded miRNA miR-BART2 down-regulates the viral DNA polymerase BALF5. MiR-BART2 guides cleavage within the 3&#x02032;-untranslated region (3&#x02032;UTR) of BALF5 by virtue of its complete complementarity to its target. Induction of the lytic viral replication cycle results in a reduction of the level of miR-BART2 with a strong concomitant decrease of cleavage of the BALF5 3&#x02032;UTR. Expression of miR-BART2 down-regulates the activity of a luciferase reporter gene containing the BALF5 3&#x02032;UTR. Forced expression of miR-BART2 during lytic replication resulted in a 40&#x02013;50% reduction of the level of BALF5 protein and a 20% reduction of the amount of virus released from EBV-infected cells. Our results are compatible with the notion that EBV-miR-BART2 inhibits transition from latent to lytic viral replication.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are non-coding RNAs of about 19&#x02013;24 nt that usually bind to partially complementary sites in the 3&#x02032;-untranslated region (3&#x02032;UTR) of mRNA targets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>) and either repress translation, induce degradation or deadenylation of their targets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>). MiRNA-encoding genes are transcribed by RNA polymerases II and III and are processed by the RNase III Drosha to precursors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4 B5 B6">4&#x02013;6</xref>) which are converted to mature miRNAs in the cytoplasm by the RNase III Dicer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>). Some but not all miRNAs with complete complementarity to their mRNAs employ the RNase Ago2 to direct the cleavage of their targets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>). Presumably, miRNAs regulate multiple targets and have been implicated in a variety of cellular processes as well as diseases including cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11 B12 B13">11&#x02013;13</xref>).</p><p>Herpes viruses such as EBV or KSHV also encode miRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>). EBV encodes at least 23 miRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15 B16 B17">15&#x02013;17</xref>) within three clusters as depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>A. The B95.8-strain of EBV which has a deletion of 12 kb but is fully transformation competent encodes only eight miRNA genes [miR-BHRF1-1-, -2, -3, miR-BART-1, -2, -3, -4 and the partially deleted miR-BART5 (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>A)]. A computational search for potential viral targets predicted the DNA polymerase BALF5 as a target for miR-BART2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>) which is encoded antisense to the 3&#x02032;UTR of the BALF5 DNA polymerase and therefore has perfect complementarity to the BALF5 mRNA (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>B). Indeed, in addition to a presumably full-length 5.0-kb mRNA, an &#x02018;aberrant&#x02019; BALF5-mRNA of 3.7 kb with the 3&#x02032;-end exactly matching the predicted BART2-cleavage site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>) was described in an earlier publication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>). These authors suggested that a viral factor induced the 3.7-kb transcript and we hypothesized that miR-BART2 might represent that factor. Therefore, we experimentally addressed miR-BART2-guided cleavage of the BALF5 mRNA as well as the biological consequence of such a cleavage on BALF5 protein expression and virus production. <fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Genomic localization of the EBV miRNAs.

Consequently, we investigated whether cleavage of BALF5 occurs both in BL41-B95.8 and uninfected BL41 cells after lytic induction by the phorbol ester TPA (12-<italic>O</italic>-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate). To carry out these experiments, an Ago2-specific rat monoclonal antibody designated 3C7 (IgG2a) was generated as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>); as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>A, the antibody clearly precipitated transiently expressed Ago2 protein while the control antibody yielded no signal. Cytoplasmic extracts were subjected to immunoprecipitation using 3C7 and incubated with an <italic>in vitro</italic> transcribed, <sup>32</sup>P-end-labelled RNA containing the cognate miR-BART2-binding site. Uninfected parental BL41 cells were used as a control. As can be seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>B, the non-replicative BL41-B95.8 extracts (&#x02018;&#x02212;TPA&#x02019;) showed cleavage activity that was strongly reduced upon TPA-induced lytic replication (&#x02018;+TPA&#x02019;). The non-infected BL41 control showed no cleavage activity. These observations were extended to extracts from EBV-positive B95.8 (type 1 EBV), Jijoye cells (type 2 EBV) and EBV-negative BJAB cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>C, left panel). No specific cleavage signal was observed for the EBV-negative BJAB extract. Again, the precipitates from EBV-positive cells cleaved the RNA substrate at the characteristic nucleotide indicating that miR-BART2 indeed functionally associates with endogenous Ago2 (lanes 2 and 4; the cleavage product is indicated by an arrow) and had only a marginal cleavage activity after lytic induction (lanes 3 and 5). We reproducibly observed a higher cleavage activity in Jijoye cells as compared to B95.8. This might be due to the fact that generally, a higher proportion of the cells infected with the B95.8 strain spontaneously enter the lytic cycle than cells infected by other EBV strains, like Jijoye. As a control, all extracts showed cleavage of a substrate for the miR-19b miRNA regardless of the presence or absence of EBV or treatment with TPA (right panel of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>C; the cleavage product is indicated by an arrow). The digest of the substrate using RNase T1 confirmed that the cleavage took place exactly at the predicted sites within the substrates and also matched the aforementioned 3&#x02032;-end in the &#x02018;aberrant&#x02019; BALF5-mRNA of 3.7 kb (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>). The additional bands observed are typically present in these cleavage assays (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>). Our data demonstrate that miR-BART2-guided cleavage is strongly reduced after induction of the lytic cycle. <fig id="F3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><p>miR-BART2-directed cleavage of BALF5 mRNA is reduced during lytic replication.

The loading control (tRNA) is shown below each blot.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="gkm1080f3"/></fig></p><p>The reduction in cleavage activity could either be due to inhibition of binding to Ago2 or a reduction in miR-BART2 levels. To test for the latter we analysed miRNA expression by northern blotting. The blot obtained using a <sup>32</sup>P-labelled probe for miR-BART2 is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>D, left panel, and was quantified using a PhosphoImager. The amount of the miR-BART2 in Jijoye and B95.8 cells was reduced upon TPA treatment by 33% and 36%, respectively and no miR-BART2 signal was seen in EBV-negative BL41 cells; the induction of the lytic replication was verified by the up-regulation of the BZLF1 protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>A). We also observed a reduction for the viral miR-BART1 (27% in Jijoye and 27% in B95.8 cells, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>D, right panel) but an increase for the cellular miR-155 by 75%, in Jijoye, 96%, in B95.8 and 360% in BL41 cells after treatment with TPA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>D, middle panel). The amount of cellular miR-19b after TPA treatment was separately determined for induced and untreated B95.8 cells and we observed a slight decrease after TPA administration (data not shown). Such a TPA-induced decrease for miR-19b and an increase for miR-155 was described for the EBV-negative myeloid HL60 cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>). In summary, miR-BART2 associates with Ago2 and guides the sequence-specific cleavage of the BALF5 mRNA. Upon induction of the lytic cycle, miR-BART2 expression is down-regulated resulting in reduced cleavage of BALF5 mRNA.</p><p>Because we saw a decrease of miR-BART2 during lytic replication, the activity of the pGL3-BALF5-3&#x02032;UTR reporter and the reporter featuring the deletion of the miRNA-binding site was compared in 293 cells harbouring the B95.8 strain of EBV (2089) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>) with or without BZLF1-mediated virus production. The induction of the lytic cycle should lead to a reduced repression (&#x02018;de-repression&#x02019;) of the BALF5 3&#x02032;UTR due to the reduced amount of miR-BART2. We observed that the empty luciferase vector alone was stimulated by the BZLF1 expression using the expression vector p509 about 2.4-fold (<italic>P</italic> = 0.006) (data not shown), which is probably due to the presence of a BZLF1-responsive AP-1 site present in the SV40 promoter driving the expression of the luciferase in the pGL3-promoter vector we used. However as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>A, the Luc BALF5-3&#x02032;UTR construct exhibited an about 7.7-fold stimulation (<italic>P</italic> = 0.003) upon lytic cycle induction, leading to a calculated induction of 3.2-fold. In contrast, the mutated BALF5-3&#x02032;UTR luciferase vector was stimulated by the BZFL1 expression about only about 1.6-fold. This induction, however, was statistically not significant (<italic>P</italic> = 0.07; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>B). We attribute the &#x02018;de-repression&#x02019; to the reduced amount of miR-BART2 upon lytic cycle induction. <fig id="F4" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><p>Reduced repression (&#x02018;De-repression&#x02019;) of the BALF5-3&#x02032;UTR during lytic cycle replication.

After TPA-induction of B95.8 cells, we detected the band of the BALF5 protein with the correct size of &#x0223c;110 kDa by western blotting and immunoprecipitation using novel BALF5-specific monoclonal antibodies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>A and B, respectively) in induced but not in uninduced cells; we also observed a band of the same mobility in various EBV-infected B-cell lines like Raji, BL41-B95.8 or M-ABA (data not shown). The effect of miR-BART2 on BALF5 levels was assayed in 293-EBV cells. Lytic cycle was induced by expression of the viral trans-activator BZLF1 using the plasmid p509. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>A, right panel, BZLF1 induced BALF5 in 293-EBV cells. The co-expression of BZLF1 and the miRNA BART2 resulted in a 30&#x02013;40% reduction of BALF5 at the protein level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>C, left panel), which was comparable to the reduction observed in the luciferase reporter assays. In contrast, the control miR-155 had no effect (data not shown). The statistical analysis of the reduction of BALF5 levels by miR-BART2 by western blot of three independent assays is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>C, right panel (<italic>P</italic> = 0.0037). As the BALF5 DNA polymerase is essential for efficient viral replication, the reduction of BALF5 protein levels by miR-BART2 should result in a diminished virus production. We quantified by real-time PCR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>) the amount of virus released by the 293-EBV cell line in the absence or presence of ectopically expressed miR-BART2. In five separate experiments, we found that co-expression of miR-BART2 and BZLF1 resulted in a statistically significant reduction (<italic>P</italic> = 0.0039) of viral load by about 20% as compared to the control. The expression of miR-155 induced a slight, but insignificant reduction of virus released (<italic>P</italic> = 0.155) with or without induction of viral replication by BZLF1 using plasmid p509. This is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>D. We take this data as supportive evidence that the miR-BART2 reduces BALF5 protein levels but point out that this does not reflect the physiological situation were the miR-BART2 levels decrease during lytic cycle induction. Finally, we unsuccessfully tried to induce lytic replication by inhibition of the B95.8-specific miRNAs using 2&#x02032;-<italic>O</italic>-methyl-antisense oligonucleotides. It is thus unclear whether the miRNAs serve to actively inhibit lytic replication or whether they are present to inhibit aberrantly expressed messages such as the BALF5 mRNAs. <fig id="F5" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><p>miR-BART2 down-regulates BALF5 polymerase.

The HSV-1 miRNA designated miR-LAT is found in latently infected cells and represses the TGF-&#x003b2;-mediated apoptosis after infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>). In the case of MHV-68, a deletion at the 5&#x02032;-end of the viral genome including the miRNA genes resulted in a reduced capacity for persistent infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>). However, as the deletion(s) also included protein-encoding genes, it is unclear whether this effect is due to the loss of the miRNA. Marek's disease virus, an oncogenic Herpes virus infecting chicken, encodes eight miRNAs expressed in latently infected, transformed cells. Three of these miRNAs are antisense to the immediate early gene ICP4 and probably down-modulate this gene product to inhibit entry into the lytic cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>).</p><p>The data presented in this report indicate that at least one of the EBV-encoded miRNAs might have a function in the viral life cycle. Our results are compatible with the notion that the miR-BART2 serves as an inhibitor of viral DNA replication through degradation of the mRNA for the viral DNA polymerase BALF5. MiR-BART2 is only expressed at very low levels during latent infection and we therefore assume that this particular miRNA serves to inhibit aberrantly transcribed BALF5 mRNA to ensure that the viral replication is not inadvertently induced. Accordingly, we only observed a modest reduction of virus production upon forced expression of miR-BART2. We also noticed that the reduction of cleavage activity after TPA-induction was much stronger than the reduction in miR-BART2 levels; it might be possible that the virus employs additional factors that interfere with Ago-2-mediated cleavage. In addition to miR-BART2, we found that both the precursor and the mature miR-BART1 were also down-regulated upon lytic cycle induction. In conjunction with a previous report (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>), which shows that the mature EBV-encoded miR-BHRF1-1 and -2 are down-regulated upon TPA induction of the two EBV-infected BL cell lines Daudi and Mutu I, we speculate that additional virus-encoded miRNAs may play a role in repression of the lytic replication cycle. We are presently analysing the possibility that the other EBV&#x02013;miRNAs target distinct viral or cellular genes involved in regulation of viral replication.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS</title><p>We thank Ruth Nord for expert technical assistance.
