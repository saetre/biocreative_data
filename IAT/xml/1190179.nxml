This capability, called electromotility, is believed to enable the sensitivity and frequency selectivity of the mammalian cochlea. Prestin is a transmembrane protein required for electromotility. Homozygous prestin knockout mice are profoundly hearing impaired. In humans, a single nucleotide change in <italic>SLC26A5</italic>, encoding prestin, has been reported in association with hearing loss.

These cells are cylindrical in shape, with stereocilia projecting from their apical surfaces and neuronal synapses associated with their basal surfaces. Mechanical deflection of OHC stereocilia, in response to sound pressure waves, results in variations in the OHC membrane potential that trigger somatic cell length changes in synchrony with the sound wave. Hyperpolarizing potentials elongate the cell and depolarizing potentials shorten the cell. Known as electromotility, this capability is believed to amplify cochlear vibrations and enable the acute hearing sensitivity and frequency selectivity of the mammalian cochlea [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>].</p><p>Prestin is a multipass transmembrane protein of the OHC required for electromotility [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Developmental expression of prestin coincides with the appearance of electromotility [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. When prestin is expressed in non-auditory mammalian cells <italic>in vitro</italic>, a non-linear, voltage-dependent membrane capacitance, a commonly used marker of electromotility, results [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. Targeted deletion of prestin in mice eliminates OHC electromotility and results in a significant (40-60dB) loss of cochlear sensitivity and an increased high frequency hearing threshold [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. The human gene <italic>SLC26A5</italic>, encoding prestin, contains 21 exons that are alternately spliced to create four isoforms of prestin with variable lengths of the C-terminus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. The expression profile of the four isoforms in OHCs and their significance with respect to electromotility are not known [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>].</p><p>In humans, a single nucleotide change in the second intron of <italic>SLC26A5 </italic>has been reported in association with hearing loss [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. The DNA sequence variation, IVS2-2A&#x0003e;G, is an A to G transition in the splice acceptor site for exon 3. The A nucleotide at position IVS2-2 of <italic>SLC26A5 </italic>was found to be conserved in human, mouse, and rat orthologs and mutation of this nucleotide is predicted to cause skipping of exon 3 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>].

Skipping of exon 3 during RNA processing would be expected to result in a messenger RNA incapable of prestin protein production and cochlear hearing loss due to absence of OHC electromotility [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>].</p><p>To further explore the relationship between the <italic>SLC26A5 </italic>IVS2-2A&#x0003e;G nucleotide substitution and hearing loss, and assess allele frequency, genomic DNA from hearing impaired and control subjects was genotyped at the <italic>SLC26A5 </italic>IVS2-2 position. In addition, <italic>SLC26A5 </italic>orthologs from various eukaryotic species were evaluated for conservation of the A nucleotide at position IVS2-2.

Four hearing impaired cases were found to be heterozygous for the IVS2-2A&#x0003e;G nucleotide substitution: one Hispanic, two Caucasian, and one of uncertain ethnicity, possibly Caucasian or mixed Caucasian. Four controls were also found to be heterozygous for the IVS2-2A&#x0003e;G nucleotide substitution: one Hispanic and three Caucasian (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>). Four of the eight carriers were male: three cases and one control. Four of the eight carriers were female: three controls and one case. The IVS2-2A&#x0003e;G nucleotide substitution was not found in 106 subjects of Asian or African American descent nor was it found in a homozygous state in any of 330 total subjects (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>).</p><p>Data from the control population suggests an allele frequency for the IVS2-2A&#x0003e;G nucleotide substitution of approximately 0.007 in Hispanics (carrier frequency 1.3%) and 0.02 in European American Caucasians (carrier frequency 4%). The difference in allele frequency of the IVS2-2A&#x0003e;G nucleotide substitution between cases and controls was evaluated by derivation of two-tailed p values using Fisher's exact test of 2 &#x000d7; 2 contingency tables. The difference in allele frequency of the IVS2-2A&#x0003e;G variant between cases and controls among Hispanics and Caucasians in this population was not statistically significant (p = 0.45). If Asian and African American cases and controls are included in the Fisher's exact test analysis, the allele frequency distribution still does not reach statistical significance (p = 0.12, Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>).</p><p>The phenotype and audiometric profile of each of the four hearing impaired subjects who were carriers of the <italic>SLC26A5 </italic>IVS2-2A&#x0003e;G nucleotide substitution was unique (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref>).

Five alternative splice acceptor sites demonstrating a confidence score greater than 0.99 out of a maximum of 1.00 were identified within intron 2 of <italic>SLC26A5 </italic>(Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>These data suggest that heterozygosity for the <italic>SLC26A5 </italic>IVS2-2A&#x0003e;G DNA sequence variation may not be, by itself, sufficient to cause hearing loss. Only one of the four hearing impaired carriers of the <italic>SLC26A5 </italic>IVS2-2A&#x0003e;G DNA sequence variation identified in this study reported a history of hearing loss in a parent. Further, various additional clinical findings in each of the hearing impaired carriers of the <italic>SLC26A5 </italic>IVS2-2A&#x0003e;G variant argue against <italic>SLC26A5 </italic>being the cause of hearing loss in each of these cases (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref>).</p><p>The carrier frequency for the <italic>SLC26A5 </italic>IVS2-2A&#x0003e;G DNA sequence variation in the control populations used in this study was observed to be 1.3% in Hispanics and 4% in Caucasians. These data suggest that the <italic>SLC26A5 </italic>IVS2-2A&#x0003e;G DNA sequence variation may not be uncommon and that it occurs in multiple ethnic groups, in contrast to previous studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. The <italic>SLC26A5 </italic>IVS2-2A&#x0003e;G DNA sequence variation was not found in Asians or African Americans. This observation may reflect absence of the variant in these ethnic groups or may be due to the small size of the study population.</p><p>Although nothing is known about the hearing status of the control group, the allele frequency of the <italic>SLC26A5 </italic>IVS2-2A&#x0003e;G variant was not significantly different between cases and controls. In addition, the <italic>SLC26A5 </italic>IVS2-2A&#x0003e;G variant was not found in homozygosity in any hearing impaired case. Given the high allele frequency of the IVS2-2A&#x0003e;G variant in the Caucasian and Hispanic control populations, if this variant were associated with hearing loss, it is reasonable to expect that homozygous hearing impaired cases would have been observed in the study group. This expectation is based on the following observations. First, congenital genetic hearing loss affects, conservatively, approximately 1 in 2,000 live births in the United States [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. A carrier rate in Caucasians of 4% for the <italic>SLC26A5 </italic>IVS2-2A&#x0003e;G nucleotide substitution suggests that approximately 1 in 2,500 Caucasians should be homozygous for this mutation. If this DNA sequence variation were related to hearing loss, it should account for a large percentage of cases of early onset genetic hearing loss in Caucasians. Curiously, <italic>SLC26A5 </italic>has not been mapped by traditional linkage analysis in any of the families with hereditary hearing loss that have so far been studied worldwide (Van Camp G, Smith RJH. Hereditary Hearing Loss Homepage. <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://webhost.ua.ac.be/hhh"/>. Further, the carrier rate among Caucasians for mutations in <italic>GJB2</italic>, encoding Connexin 26, widely believed to be the most common cause of early onset genetic hearing loss in the United States, is estimated to be approximately 3% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. This is 1% less than the carrier frequency of the <italic>SLC26A5 </italic>IVS2-2A&#x0003e;G DNA sequence variation observed among Caucasians in this study. The common 35delG mutation in <italic>GJB2 </italic>is, by itself, estimated to have a carrier rate in US Caucasians of approximately 2.5% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. In a group of 94 hearing impaired cases that includes the 84 subjects tested in this study for <italic>SLC26A5 </italic>IVS2-2A&#x0003e;G, five subjects homozygous for the 35delG mutation were found (unpublished observation). In contrast, no subjects homozygous for the IVS2-2A&#x0003e;G DNA sequence variation were observed. These observations challenge whether the <italic>SLC26A5 </italic>IVS2-2A&#x0003e;G DNA sequence variation is associated with hearing loss.</p><p>As shown in Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">3</xref>, the AG dinucleotide at the splice acceptor site of exon 3 of <italic>SLC26A5 </italic>is invariant and evolutionarily conserved amongst prestin orthologs. Analysis of gene structure in multiple species including vertebrates, invertebrates, plants and viruses suggested that the AG dinucleotide of 3' splice acceptor sites cannot tolerate mutation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. Thus, the IVS2-2A&#x0003e;G substitution creates a sequence variation in <italic>SLC26A5 </italic>that is expected to cause skipping of exon 3 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. However, since a number of potential alternative splice acceptor sites exist within intron 2 of human <italic>SLC26A5 </italic>(Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>), and the translation start codon for prestin is found within exon 3 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>], alternate splicing of exon 3 within intron 2 might be compatible with production of a correctly translated prestin protein. Alternatively, utilization of one or more alternate splice sites in a way that minimizes the number of transcripts missing exon 3 during functional maturation of the cochlea might minimally impact the level of prestin in mature OHCs. This hypothesis requires <italic>in vivo </italic>evaluation of splicing and steady state protein levels in cells carrying <italic>SLC26A5 </italic>genes with the IVS2-2A&#x0003e;G substitution, and in particular during functional maturation of the cochlea.</p><p>Further studies are needed to clarify and refine the IVS2-2A/G allele frequencies in various ethnic groups and examine the role of the IVS2-2A&#x0003e;G nucleotide substitution in hearing loss. These studies should include screening of additional case and control populations for the <italic>SLC26A5 </italic>IVS2-2A&#x0003e;G DNA sequence variation, and identification and audiometric testing of carriers and homozygous individuals.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>The exon 3 splice acceptor sequence of <italic>SLC26A5 </italic>is evolutionarily conserved. Disruption of the canonical AG dinucleotide at this splice acceptor site by the IVS2-2A&#x0003e;G transition is expected to abolish splice site recognition and result in skipping of exon 3. The IVS2-2A&#x0003e;G transition is found in individuals of Hispanic and European American (Caucasian) ancestry, suggesting this DNA sequence variation is not limited to a single ethnic group. Among Hispanics and Caucasians, there is no statistically significant difference in allele frequency of the IVS2-2A&#x0003e;G nucleotide substitution between hearing impaired cases and controls, challenging whether this DNA sequence variation is associated with hearing loss. The detection of alternative splice acceptor sites within intron 2 suggests a potential mechanism by which expression of prestin might be maintained in cells carrying the <italic>SLC26A5 </italic>IVS2-2A&#x0003e;G DNA sequence variation. Further studies of the <italic>SLC26A5 </italic>IVS2-2A&#x0003e;G DNA sequence variation are needed.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The author(s) declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>HYT participated in the design of this study, carried out the laboratory analyses, contributed to the analysis and interpretation of the data, and helped draft the manuscript.
