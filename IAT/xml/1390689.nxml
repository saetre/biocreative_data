Here, we identified a human helicase, hPif1 that inhibits telomerase activity. The primary sequence and biochemical analysis suggest that hPif1 is a potential homologue of <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> RecD, an ATP-dependent 5&#x02032; to 3&#x02032; DNA helicase. Ectopic expression of wild-type, but not the ATPase/helicase-deficient hPif1, causes telomere shortening in HT1080 cells. hPif1 reduces telomerase processivity and unwinds DNA/RNA duplex <italic>in vitro</italic>. hPif1 preferentially binds telomeric DNA <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>. We propose that the mechanism of hPif1's inhibition on telomerase involves unwinding of the DNA/RNA duplex formed by telomerase RNA and telomeric DNA, and RecD homologues in eukaryotes may have evolved gaining additional functions.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Telomeres are the nucleoprotein structures that are positioned at eukaryotic chromosomal ends. The primary role of telomeres is to insulate the chromosomal ends from both fusion with other ends and from nucleolytic digestion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>). The telomeric DNA, which typically consists of tandem repeats of guanine-rich sequences, is essential for telomere function. In humans, each chromosome end bears 5&#x02013;15 kb of TTAGGG/CCCTAA repeated DNA, which is maintained by telomerase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>) and/or alternative lengthening of telomere (ALT) pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>).</p><p>Telomerase, as found in most organisms, is a specialized reverse transcriptase that uses a small segment of an integral RNA subunit as template to extend the 3&#x02032; end of the G-rich strand of telomeres (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>). In humans, telomerase activity attributed to hTERT (the catalytic protein subunit) and hTR (the RNA subunit) is readily detected in germline cells, high-proliferative cells and many types of cancer cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>). However, telomerase activity is minimal in most somatic cell lineages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>). Consistent with this, telomeres in most types of human somatic cells shorten with increasing age or with repeated passaging in culture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>). The introduction of hTERT into some normal primary human cells has been shown to halt telomere shortening and prevent the cells from entering into senescence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>). Although telomerase activation does not induce transformation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>), immortalization of primary human cells and the extensive proliferation of most adult human cancer cells require telomerase activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>). Inhibition of telomerase activity in tumor cells caused telomere shortening and resulted in cell crisis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>). For these reasons, repression of telomerase activity might act as an adjuvant therapy for the treatment of human cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>).</p><p>In most human tumor cells, telomere length is stably maintained by balancing the result of telomere attrition and telomere elongation by telomerase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>). The telomere elongation activity of telomerase is determined by both the level of telomerase expression and the accessibility of telomerase to telomere ends (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>). Telomere binding protein complex is a major player in the latter factor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>). It has been suggested that the human duplex telomeric DNA-binding protein TRF1 and TRF2 recruit TIN2 and hRAP1 to telomeres and nucleate the formation of a specialized chromatin structure to prevent the access of telomerase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>). In addition, long telomeres in human cells can form a T-loop structure where the 3&#x02032; single-stranded telomere overhang is inserted into the double-stranded telomere region. This renders DNA terminus inaccessible to telomerase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>). The formation of T-loop structure appears to be facilitated by TRF1 and TRF2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>). Furthermore, telomeric single-stranded DNA-binding protein hPot1 may also act as a repressor of telomerase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>) since the 3&#x02032; end cannot simultaneously binds the hPot1 protein and the telomerase RNA component.</p><p>Recently, we determined that the <italic>Saccharomyces</italic> Pif1 helicase and its paralogue Rrm3 helicase are involved in telomere DNA replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref>). Rrm3p appears to promote the progression of the replication fork through telomeres (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref>). Pif1p, unlike Rrm3p, inhibits telomere lengthening through the telomerase pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref>). A proposed mechanism for yeast Pif1p's inhibition of telomerase activity is to release Est2p/Tlc1 complex from telomeric DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref>). <italic>PIF1</italic>-like genes are found in diverse organisms, for example in <italic>Schizosaccharomyces pombe, Candida maltosa, Caenorhabditis elegans, Drosophila melanogaster</italic> and <italic>Homo sapiens</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref>). The Pif1p homologue in <italic>S.pombe</italic>, called Pfh1p (Pif1 homologue 1), is essential for cell viability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref>). Because the fundamental mechanism of telomere replication is highly conserved from yeast to mammals, the elucidation of the function of telomerase and its regulators in yeast has provided insights that are relevant to the function of their homologues in humans. The yeast Pif1p is the prototype of this helicase subfamily, and the potential human homologue was referred as hPif1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref>). Although the partial sequence comparison of the yeast Pif1p, Rrm3p, Pfh1p and its potential human homologue (hPif1) indicate &#x0223c;32, 32 and 36% primary sequence identity over 438, 395 and 377 amino acid residues, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref>), the existence of human Pif1 helicase was unresolved. To address these issues, we have cloned the cDNA encoding human Pif1, overexpressed and purified the recombinant protein, and characterized its enzymatic activity <italic>in vitro</italic>. Our <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic> data suggested that hPif1 regulates telomere elongation by decreasing telomerase processivity, possibly via a mechanism that involves the unwinding of hTR from telomeric DNA by hPif1.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Oligonucleotides for assays</title><p>Oligonucleotides were synthesized and purified by Takara.

The deduced amino acid sequences indicated that the hPIF1 is a 641 amino acid protein with a predicted molecular weight of &#x0223c;71 kDa, and contains seven conserved motifs characteristic of DNA helicases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref> and Supplementary Figure 1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>hPif1 is a potential homologue of <italic>E.coli</italic> RecD</title><p>Helicases utilize the energy of NTP hydrolysis to catalyze the unwinding of double-stranded nucleic acids, and play important roles in many cellular processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref>). Most helicases from various organisms have been classified into superfamily I and II (SFI and SFII), and contain seven conserved helicase motifs (I, Ia, II, III, IV, V and VI) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">36</xref>). These motifs are usually found clustered in a relatively short region over 300&#x02013;500 amino acids long. The conserved helicase motifs of I to VI in SFI share little similarity with the corresponding motifs of that in SFII. The high degree of conservation of Pif1 subfamily helicases in <italic>S.cerevisiae, S.pombe, C.maltosa, C.elegans, D.melanogaster</italic>, <italic>Mus musculus and H.sapiens</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref>) suggests that they might have evolved from a common ancestor which plays fundamental and conserved roles in nucleic acid metabolism.</p><p>To seek cousins of Pif1, we searched multiple gene and protein databases. Because the conserved helicase motifs are short and degenerate, it is difficult to identify homologues even in the same superfamily when the full-length sequences of helicase are analyzed with traditional BLAST or FASTA computer programs. Instead, we searched the Cluster of Orthologous Groups of proteins (COG) database, and discovered that hPif1, as well as other members of Pif1 subfamily, clustered with RecD of <italic>E.coli</italic>. As a result of the large phylogenetic distance, the sequence identity between them was low (&#x0003c;20%). However, as the COG database does not apply any constraint of an arbitrarily-chosen statistical cut-off, but rather uses the best-hit rule, which accommodates both slow- and fast-evolving proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">37</xref>). Therefore, we could readily search for putative ancestral proteins of most eukaryotic helicases, and classify the members of superfamilies into different COGs (Supplementary Table 1). Because hPif1 identified RecD in our COG search, we then compared the protein sequences of hPif1 and RecD. The helicase motifs of hPif1 have high sequence identity with the consensus helicase motifs in RecD proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> and Supplementary Figure 1). In contrast to other members of SFI, Pif1 subfamily and prokaryotic RecD subfamily do share some other conserved motifs, designated as motifs A, B, C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> and Supplementary Figure 1), whose functions are unknown, in addition to the helicase motifs. All these data imply that eukaryotic Pif1 subfamily belongs to RecD subfamily.</p></sec><sec><title>hPif1 is an ATPase and a 5&#x02032; to 3&#x02032;DNA helicase</title><p>In general, homologues share similar biochemical properties.

To characterize hPif1 activity <italic>in vitro</italic>, we tried to overexpress and purify full-length recombinant hPif1 protein. However, the full-length hPif1 was difficult to overexpress and/or purify even when expressed in heterologous expression systems, including those utilizing bacteria, yeast and insect cells. According to the full-length sequence alignment of Pif1 subfamily and RecD (data not shown), the N-terminals of these proteins are not conserved, suggesting that they may not be essential for the conserved enzymatic activity. Thus, we overexpressed the recombinant N-terminal deleted hPif1 that contains the seven conserved helicase motifs with an N-terminal GST fusion (<sup>GST</sup>hPif1&#x00394;N) in <italic>S.cerevisiae</italic> and purified it to near homogeneity. A mutant <sup>GST</sup>hPif1<sup>K234A</sup>&#x00394;N, in which the conserved Lysine in the ATP binding domain (helicase motif I in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>) was changed to an Alanine, was overexpressed and purified in parallel (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>).</p><p>Subsequently, we measured ATPase activity of the recombinant proteins, and found out that the recombinant <sup>GST</sup>hPif1&#x00394;N could efficiently hydrolyze ATP in the presence of both Mg<sup>2+</sup> and single-stranded DNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, lanes 3&#x02013;5). Little ATPase activity of <sup>GST</sup>hPif1&#x00394;N was detected in the presence of RNA or double-stranded DNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, lanes 5&#x02013;7), indicating that hPif1 has a preference for single-stranded DNA. No ATPase activity was detected with the <sup>GST</sup>hPif1<sup>K234A</sup>&#x00394;N (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, lane 8).

DNA helicases will move along the single-stranded DNA and displace at least one of the oligonucleotides. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>, recombinant <sup>GST</sup>hPif1&#x00394;N, as well as yPif1p, displaced the 35mer oligonucleotide, while the ATPase-deficient <sup>GST</sup>hPif1<sup>K234A</sup>&#x00394;N did not. We conclude that the hPif1 is an ATP-dependent 5&#x02032; to 3&#x02032;DNA helicase. Collectively, these data indicate that recombinant hPif1 has enzymatic properties <italic>in vitro</italic> that resemble those of both yPif1p and RecD protein.</p></sec><sec><title>Overexpression of ATPase/helicase-functional hPIF1 results in telomere shortening</title><p>The messenger RNA of hPif1 has been reported to be present in some human tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">41</xref>), however, these reported clones matched only with either N or C terminus sequence of our clone. To analyze the expression of hPif1 mRNA and protein, we examined 12 transformed cell lines derived from different human tissues. The hPif1 transcripts were detected in most of tested cell lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>); however, the protein was undetectable when the total cell lysates were subjected to Western blotting (data not shown). We then enriched the hPif1 by immunoprecipitation, following Western blotting and finally detected a faint band only in the extract of Wrl68 hepatocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>), which corresponded to the size of hPif1 detected in transiently transfected HT1080 cells. This result suggests that the expression of hPif1 protein in tested cells is very limited. To examine whether hPif1 could be ectopically overexpressed in human cell lines, we transfected hPif1 construct into HT1080 fibrosarcoma cells, in which endogenous expression of hPif1 protein was minimum, to establish stable cell lines. The ectopic expression of hPif1 or hPif1<sup>myc</sup> was detected as a single band in the extract of the stable cell lines by Western blotting after immunoprecipitation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>), suggesting that hPif1 has only one form, unlike yPif1 which exists as both nuclear and mitochondrial forms with different molecular sizes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">42</xref>). Overexpressed GFP-fused hPif1 was observed in nucleus (data not shown), suggesting that no mitochondrial form of hPif1 exists.</p><p>To investigate the role of hPIF1 in telomere DNA replication, we took advantage of Tet-Off HT1080 cell line (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>), a telomerase-positive human fibrosarcoma-cell line with a stable telomere length, for inducible expression of full-length hPif1 containing a C-terminal Myc epitope (hPIF1<sup>myc</sup>) or its ATPase-deficient mutant hPIF1<sup>myc</sup>(K234A) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). Western analysis with anti-hPif1 antibodies showed that doxycycline controlled the expression of wide-type or mutant hPif1 proteins in clonal Tet-Off HT1080 cell lines transfected with the constructs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A and B</xref>). At PD one after removal of doxycycline, the expression of hPif1 was induced and remained relatively stable thereafter. The expression of hPif1 was repressed with the re-introduction of doxycycline back into the culture medium. Expression of wild-type or mutant hPIF1 proteins did not affect the overall growth rate of the cells for at least 150 PDs (data not shown).</p><p>We then studied the effects of long-term overexpression of hPIF1<sup>myc</sup> or hPIF1<sup>myc</sup> (K234A) on telomere length in these transfected cells. Cells overexpressing hPif1 showed gradual telomeric shortening after induction. The change of telomere length was not discernible at one PD when the expression of hPif1 was already fully induced, but a shortening of terminal restriction fragments was obvious between 15 and 35 PDs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C and E</xref>). The loss of telomeric sequences was also evident from a reduction in the TTAGGG hybridization signal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C and E</xref>). Telomere shortening was detected in all five tested cell lines that overexpressed hPIF1<sup>myc</sup> (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>). In these cells (T2, T9, T10, T12 and T15), the decline of telomere length was dependent on the absence of doxycycline. After extensive passaging the cell lines (55 PDs), the telomeres shortened by 0.5&#x02013;1.5 kb, and the rate of telomere shortening varied in the different cell lines from 10 to 27 bp per PD (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>). A control Tet-Off HT1080 cell line transfected with mutated hPIF1 had stable telomeres over 130 PDs and there was no effect on telomere length after inducing hPIF1<sup>myc</sup> (K234A) overexpression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D and F</xref>). These results indicate that hPIF1 negatively regulates telomere length and that such inhibition requires the ATPase/helicase activity of hPif1.</p></sec><sec><title>Repression of hPif1 overexpression recovers telomere length</title><p>It has been suggested that the establishment of stable telomere length could be determined by dynamic factors such as telomerase activity, the rate of telomere shortening and the levels of other factors that control telomere length (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>). The overexpression of hPif1 for more than 35 PDs seemed to promote a new equilibrium in telomere length (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C and E</xref>). At this stage, telomere length became stable and no further changes were observed when the culture was grown for an additional 50 PDs (data not shown). If the changes in telomere length were caused by hPif1 overexpression, suppression of hPif1 would release the inhibition. Therefore, doxycycline was added in the culture medium to repress the expression of hPif1, and the telomeres in the HT1080 Tet-Off cells were analyzed. In the T15 clone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C and E</xref>), shortened telomeres showed gradual elongation over 40 PDs at a rate of 38 bp per PD. The short telomeres in other clones (T2, T9, T10 and T12) also showed similar increase in length, and were eventually stabilized (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>), indicating that silencing of ectopic expressed hPif1 resets telomere length to the level of the starting population. These data argue that down-regulation of hPif1 expression promotes telomere elongation, and the telomere shortening caused by up-regulation of hPif1 expression is likely a direct effect.</p></sec><sec><title>hPif1 inhibits telomerase activity <italic>in vitro</italic></title><p>Since overexpression of hPif1 causes telomere shortening, it is possible that the hPif1 inhibits telomerase activity. Therefore, we analyzed the effect of hPif1 on telomerase activity <italic>in vitro</italic> by using a PCR-based telomeric repeat amplification protocol (TRAP) assay. Telomerase-containing extracts were prepared from HT1080 cell lysate. In the first step of the reaction, telomerase adds a number of telomeric repeats (GGTTAG) on to the 3&#x02032; end of a substrate oligonucleotide. In the second step, the extended products are amplified by PCR, generating a ladder of products with six base increments on a native gel. With the increase of recombinant <sup>GST</sup>hPif1&#x00394;N, telomerase ladders were decreased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>, lanes 4&#x02013;9).

Processivity is defined as the ability of telomerase to undergo multiple reaction cycles without being released from telomeric DNA. To determine whether hPif1 affects primer binding or processivity of human telomerase, we performed direct telomerase activity assay, which allows us to assess telomerase processivity, i.e. the actual number of telomeric repeats added to the primer (telomerase ladder). When the recombinant <sup>GST</sup>hPif1&#x00394;N was added into the telomerase reaction, the total DNA synthesis of telomerase was reduced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B and C</xref>), arguing that hPif1 inhibits telomerase activity, which is consistent to the TRAP assay result. Strikingly, the presence of recombinant <sup>GST</sup>hPif1&#x00394;N resulted in a significant decrease of the repeated ladders formed by multiple telomeric repeats addition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>, lanes 1, 2 and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>), indicating that hPif1 dramatically reduces the processivity of human telomerase.

Our initial suspicion was that hPif1 could dissociate telomerase RNA from its telomeric DNA.

Therefore, we tested the activity of hPif1 using radiolabeled 25mer and 35mer RNA oligonucleotides annealed with M13mp7 single-stranded DNA. In the presence of either yPif1 or <sup>GST</sup>hPif1&#x00394;N, the 35mer RNA oligonucleotide was released from the M13mp7 DNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>, lanes 2 and 4) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref>), while helicase-deficient hPif1 or yPif1 did not show the unwinding activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>, lanes 3 and 5).

Random single-stranded DNA was added as molecular competitor. The recombinant <sup>GST</sup>hPif1&#x00394;N could bind single-stranded DNA with either random or human telomeric sequence, but exhibited higher affinity for telomeric DNA because 100-fold more random DNA appeared not to be able to compete with telomeric DNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>, lanes 2 and 3). In addition, ATP enhanced, while ADP reduced the binding of hPif1 to telomeric DNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>, lanes 6 and 7). Interestingly, ATPase-deficient mutant hPif1 also bound to single-stranded DNA, although with a slightly lower affinity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>, lane 8), implying that ATP acted as a positive modulator rather than being an absolute requirement for the binding process.

Like the yeast Pif1, hPif1 is able to unwind DNA/DNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>) and DNA/RNA duplex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>), and is a putative homologue of <italic>E.coli</italic> RecD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> and Supplementary Figure 1). Ectopic expression of wild-type, but not ATPase/helicase-deficient hPif1 causes telomere shortening in telomerase-positive cells, and repression of ectopically expressed hPif1 restored the equilibrium of telomere length (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). The hPif1 protein preferentially binds telomeric TTAGGG repeats (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>), and decreases telomerase processivity <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B&#x02013;D</xref>). The inhibitory effect of hPif1 on telomere elongation is likely to be direct because hPif1 associates with telomeric DNA <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). We propose that hPif1's ability to unwind the DNA/RNA duplex formed by telomerase RNA and telomeric DNA defines the mechanism whereby hPif1 inhibits telomerase activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>).</p><p>Helicases are the motor proteins that utilize the energy of NTP hydrolysis to transiently catalyze the unwinding of duplex nucleic acids, and are found to be essential in many cellular processes involving DNA and RNA. Pif1 helicase subfamily belongs to the helicase superfamily I (SFI). However, when the members of Pif1 helicase subfamily were analyzed using the COG database, they were grouped in RecD COG, while WRN and BLM helicases fell into RecQ COG (Supplementary Table 1). We propose that hPif1and the other members of Pif1 subfamily are RecD-like helicases. The sequence alignment of conserved helicase motifs supports this hypothesis. In addition to the helicase motifs, Pif1 subfamily and prokaryotic RecD subfamily share some conserved motifs, named A, B and C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> and Supplementary Figure 1), which are not found in other members of SFI. Besides the sequence similarity, functional studies also strengthened this idea. RecD helicase in <italic>E.coli</italic> has been reported to form a complex with RecBC to repair DNA breaks by homologous recombination via a concerted action of helicase and nuclease activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">39</xref>). The yeast Pif1p has previously been shown to participate in mitochondrial DNA recombination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">42</xref>). The <italic>Saccharomyces</italic> Rrm3p, which is a paralogue of Pif1p, is required to reduce the converged forks during rDNA replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref>). Thus, like RecD, the yPif1p and Rrm3p are involved in DNA recombination, and it remains a possibility that hPif1 also takes part in other cellular processes. Also of note, hPif1 does not appear to be the only RecD-like helicase in humans. The mammalian DNA helicase B, which is required for the onset of chromosomal DNA replication, shares homology with RecD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b43">43</xref>) (Supplementary Table 1). Thus, it will be interesting to further study the functions of RecD-like helicase in mammals.</p><p>The members of Pif1 helicase subfamily studied so far all appear to contribute to telomere maintenance. In <italic>S.pombe</italic>, mutation of the Pfh1p results in modest telomere shortening (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b44">44</xref>). In <italic>S.cerevisiae</italic>, the Rrm3 helicase promotes the passage of the replication fork through telomere and sub-telomere regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref>). Pif1p inhibits telomere elongation by reducing the processivity of the telomerase and by removing the telomerase from telomere ends (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref>), In humans, overexpression of hPif1 causes telomere shortening (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>), and this negative regulation is most likely achieved through the inhibition of telomerase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A&#x02013;D</xref>). Repression of overexpressed hPif1 resulted in telomere elongation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). Therefore, the general inhibitory functions of hPif1 and yPif1p in telomeres are similar (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref>). However, the precise mechanisms of telomerase inhibition by hPif1 and yPif1p may not be identical: hPif1 appears to reduce the telomeric repeat addition processivity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B&#x02013;E</xref>), while yPif1p releases telomerase from telomeric DNA in an active form after completion of one round of DNA synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref>). In all cases, the effects of these proteins on telomeres require ATPase/helicase activity. These observations from studies <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> lead us to propose a model depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>. hPif1 binds a single-stranded G-rich region that is proximal to the double-stranded region of the telomere, while telomerase binds the region distal to single-stranded region and the telomerase RNA pairs with the tip of 3&#x02032; overhang (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). In this model, Pif1 would slide along the DNA in a 5&#x02032; to 3&#x02032;direction to access and disentangle the telomerase RNA-telomeric DNA hybrid, thereby inhibiting telomere elongation. ATP and ADP might act as regulators of the process. When hPif1 binds ATP, it may undergo a conformational change that facilitates it's binding to ssDNA and provide the energy to move along the telomeric DNA. With the binding of ADP by hPif1, access to ssDNA may be restricted, or alternatively, it may be released from the telomeric DNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). However, the question of whether hPif1 is capable of directly removing hTERT from telomeric DNA <italic>in vivo</italic> needs further investigation.</p><p>The inhibition of telomere elongation as a result of DNA/RNA unwinding orchestrated by hPif1 represents a different regulatory mechanism for human telomerase from those previously proposed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b44">44</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b46">46</xref>). The notion has emerged that helicases are required for telomere replication. Recent studies indicate that the <italic>Saccharomyces</italic> Sgs1 helicase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b47">47</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b49">49</xref>) and human WRN helicase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b50">50</xref>), two members of RecQ subfamily, are involved in telomere maintenance. However, unlike Pif1 helicase, which seems to fall in RecD subfamily and regulates telomere length through inhibition of telomerase, the Sgs1 helicase participates in a telomerase-independent pathway for telomere lengthening (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b48">48</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b49">49</xref>). The WRN helicase, in which a mutation causes the Werner syndrome, is required for dissociating alternate or secondary structures at telomere, to allow for replication, repair and telomerase activity at the telomere end (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b50">50</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b51">51</xref>). However, whether loss of function of hPif1 would correlate with any of human disease needs further investigation.</p></sec><sec><title>SUPPLEMENTARY DATA</title><p>Supplementary Data are available at NAR Online.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material id="PMC_1" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>[Supplementary Data]</title></caption><media mimetype="text" mime-subtype="html" xlink:href="nar_34_5_1393__index.html"/><media xlink:role="associated-file" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="nar_34_5_1393__1.pdf"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors are grateful to Dr Chantal Autexier for providing the phTERT and phTR+1 plasmid, Drs Mujun Zhao, Zhengjun Chen, Naihe Jing for providing reagents, and Dr Bibo Li for the protocols of telomere Southern blot and data quantification.
