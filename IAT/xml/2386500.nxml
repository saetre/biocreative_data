One common approach for dissecting the genetics of growth is the mapping of quantitative trait loci (QTL). In the last decade numerous human and mouse growth QTL have been identified [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]; however, while this progress is important, few if any of the loci have been unequivocally resolved to the effects of a single quantitative trait gene (QTG).</p><p>Several studies involving many different mouse inbred strains have demonstrated an enrichment of growth and obesity QTL on chromosome 2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. In our laboratory, we have developed a number of genomic resources with the goal of discerning the molecular basis of chromosome 2 QTL segregating between the C57BL/6J (B6), C57BL/6J-<italic>hg/hg </italic>(HG) and CAST/EiJ (CAST) strains [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. These include two congenic strains, B6.CAST-(<italic>D2Mit329-D2Mit457</italic>)N(6) (B62D) and HG.CAST-(<italic>D2Mit329-D2Mit457</italic>)N(6) (HG2D), constructed by introgressing an identical congenic donor region, extending from approximately 75 to 180 Mbp, from the CAST strain onto both B6 and HG backgrounds [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. HG mice exhibit extreme body weights without becoming obese due to the <italic>high growth </italic>(<italic>hg</italic>) deletion located on chromosome 10, which eliminates the expression of the suppressor of cytokine signaling 2 (<italic>Socs2</italic>) gene, a negative regulator of growth hormone signaling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. The purpose of generating the HG2D and B62D strains was to capture the weight gain 2 (<italic>Wg2</italic>) QTL [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>] and evaluate hypothesized interactions between <italic>Wg2 </italic>and <italic>hg</italic>. After construction, HG2D mice were not characterized due to reproductive problems, however, B62D mice displayed significant decreases in growth and obesity traits [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>].</p><p>In two follow-up studies it was determined that <italic>Wg2 </italic>was actually the result of multiple genes. In the first study, an F2 cross derived from the HG2D congenic and HG progenitor strain (referred to as the HG2DF2 cross) was used to identify a strong QTL located at 112 Mbp that decreased body weight at 6 and 9 weeks of age, but did not affect fat mass. This QTL partially explained the effects of <italic>Wg2 </italic>and was referred to as weight gain QTL 5 (<italic>Wg5</italic>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. In the second study, subcongenic mice derived from the B62D congenic (referred to as B62D-3), with a CAST donor region from 102&#x02013;115 Mbp, were lighter and leaner due to the effects of a locus we named <italic>Wg2b </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. Based on their coincident genomic location, <italic>Wg5 </italic>and <italic>Wg2b </italic>are likely the same QTL, however, their differing effects on adiposity suggest that an interaction with <italic>hg </italic>may eliminate or decrease the fat reducing effects of <italic>Wg5</italic>.</p><p>In the current study we have used DNA microarrays and public genomic databases to investigate the genetics of expression for genes located within the two congenic models, HG2D and B62D, to identify candidates for the <italic>Wg5 </italic>and <italic>Wg2b </italic>QTL. Based on its genomic location, differential expression and biological function, the most promising candidate is secretogranin V (<italic>Scg5</italic>; also referred to as <italic>Sgne1</italic>). The protein product of <italic>Scg5</italic>, 7B2, is a molecular chaperone for prohormone convertase 2 (PCSK2). PCSK2 is a member of the subtilisin-like proprotein convertase family and many PCSK2-generated peptides are either directly involved in glucose homeostasis (glucagon) or indirectly contribute to body weight regulation (&#x003b1;-MSH, CART, and nesfatin-1, to name a few examples). Knockout of peptide biosynthetic enzymes often result in mice with body weight phenotypes, most notably the <italic>fat/fat </italic>mouse with its inactivating mutation in <italic>carboxypeptidase E </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. While the PCSK2 knockout mouse is slightly runted but otherwise of normal weight [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>], an obese PCSK1 mutant mouse has recently been described which has lowered levels of the PCSK2 product &#x003b1;-MSH [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>], indicating possible interplay/feedback between the peptide synthesizing enzymes (also suggested by [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]). <italic>Scg5 </italic>has also been implicated in body weight homeostasis. <italic>Scg5 </italic>knockout mice (on a 129/SvEv background) exhibit a postnatal lethal phenotype in which all mice die by 5 weeks of age (due to intermediate lobe ACTH hypersecretion and rampant corticosteronemia); however, adrenalectomy rescues these animals and reveals a late-onset obesity phenotype [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Collectively, these results point to potential roles for peptide biosynthetic enzymes, and specifically for <italic>Scg5</italic>, in body weight regulation.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Identification of differentially expressed genes in HG2DF2 mice</title><p>To identify differentially expressed genes within the HG2D congenic donor region that potentially underlie body weight and obesity QTL, we hybridized whole brain RNA from non-recombinant HG2DF2 mice (mice inheriting intact <italic>cast </italic>or <italic>b6 </italic>congenic haplotypes) from each of the three F2 genotypes (<italic>b6/b6</italic>, <italic>b6</italic>/<italic>cast </italic>and <italic>cast/cast</italic>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>] to Agilent whole genome mouse microarrays.

The sequence included all introns and exons and 10 kbp of 5' and 3' genomic sequence. In total six consensus sites were identified (Additional File <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S2">2</xref>). Interestingly, two tandem sites in the <italic>Scg5 </italic>promoter were located between -56 and -39 (relative to the transcription start site; Additional File <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S2">2</xref>).

With this in mind, we analyzed the genomic sequence of <italic>Scg5 </italic>to identify putative polymorphisms that may be responsible for the strong local eQTL. This is important since it could lead to the discovery of novel modes of <italic>Scg5 </italic>transcriptional regulation. Based on the eQTL results from multiple crosses, we hypothesized that two haplotypes should exist in the genomic region containing the eQTL, one unique to B6 (low expressers) the other shared between CAST, BALB, DBA and C3H (high expressers). To identify potential regions, haplotype blocks were identified by downloading all SNPs within <italic>Scg5 </italic>from the Mouse Phenome Database [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. A total of 191 SNPs were identified between 113.571079 and 113.633403 Mbp on chromosome 2 (Additional File <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S3">3</xref>). This 62.324 Kbp region encompassed the entire <italic>Scg5 </italic>coding sequence, promoter, over 5 Kbp downstream and the 3' end of <italic>Arhgap11a</italic>, which is located 2.4 kbp upstream of the first <italic>Scg5 </italic>exon. As predicted, two haplotype blocks were identified using the Haploview software package [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. Block 1 extended from the beginning of the queried region at 113.571079 Mbp to 113.581978 Mbp (10.899 Kbp) and block 2 spanned from 113.582743 Mbp to the end of the interval at 113.633403 Mbp (50.660 Kbp) (Additional File <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S3">3</xref>). Block 1 did not fit the necessary criteria of being unique to B6 (B6 and CAST were very similar across this block), however, block 2 consisted of three predominant haplotypes, one unique to B6, one unique to CAST and the other was highly similar among C3H, DBA and BALB. Although CAST differed from all other strains across the whole block, it was much more similar to C3H, DBA and BALB in the region corresponding to exon 2 and the first two introns. The haplotype similarities and differences across both blocks are shown in cladograms in Additional File <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S4">4</xref>. Therefore, since the region of haplotype block 2 contains a haplotype unique to B6 and similar among the other strains it is likely the genetic variant underlying the eQTL is located in this region.</p><p>None of the SNPs included in the above analysis were located within the proximal promoter. To comprehensively screen this region, we sequenced 2500 bps upstream of the transcription start site (as defined by RefSeq NM_009162) in B6, HG, CAST, BALB, DBA and C3H mice. Ten SNPs were identified across all six strains (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">3</xref>). In addition, an 11 bp deletion between -432 and -422 (del-432) was identified in DBA, C3H and BALB. This deletion was previously identified in C3H mice by Schmidt <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. Consistent with the above haplotype analysis, BALB, DBA and C3H shared an identical haplotype across the region. CAST was polymorphic at all 10 of the SNPs (but not del-432) relative to B6 and the other strains were polymorphic at SNPs -1373, -794 and -659. Interestingly, CAST mice did not possess del-432, however, position -432 was polymorphic between B6 and CAST mice. Therefore, since these four SNPs are unique to B6, the low <italic>Scg5 </italic>expressing strain, it is probable that one (or more) may give rise to the <italic>Scg5 </italic>eQTL</p><table-wrap position="float" id="T3"><label>Table 3</label><caption><p><italic>Scg5 </italic>promoter polymorphisms in C57BL/6J, C57BL/6J-<italic>hg/hg</italic>, BALB/cByJ, C3H/HeJ, DBA/2J and CAST/EiJ strains</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><td align="left">Strain</td><td align="center"><italic>Scg5 </italic>exp.</td><td align="center">-2475 (A/G)</td><td align="center">-2445 (A/C)</td><td align="center">-1540 (A/G)</td><td align="center">-1373 (A/G)</td><td align="center">-1095 (G/C)</td><td align="center">-904 (G/T)</td><td align="center">-794 (G/A)</td><td align="center">-659 (A/G)</td><td align="center">-432 (C/T)</td><td align="center">del-432</td><td align="center">-306 (A/C)</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left">C57BL/6J</td><td align="center">LOW</td><td align="center">AA</td><td align="center">AA</td><td align="center">AA</td><td align="center">GG</td><td align="center">GG</td><td align="center">GG</td><td align="center">GG</td><td align="center">AA</td><td align="center">CC</td><td align="center">+</td><td align="center">AA</td></tr><tr><td align="left">C57BL/6J-<italic>hg/hg</italic></td><td align="center">LOW</td><td align="center">AA</td><td align="center">AA</td><td align="center">AA</td><td align="center">GG</td><td align="center">GG</td><td align="center">GG</td><td align="center">GG</td><td align="center">AA</td><td align="center">CC</td><td align="center">+</td><td align="center">AA</td></tr><tr><td align="left">BALB/cByJ</td><td align="center">HIGH</td><td align="center">AA</td><td align="center">AA</td><td align="center">AA</td><td align="center"><bold><italic>AA</italic></bold></td><td align="center">GG</td><td align="center">GG</td><td align="center"><bold><italic>AA</italic></bold></td><td align="center"><bold><italic>GG</italic></bold></td><td align="center"><bold><italic>del</italic></bold></td><td align="center">del</td><td align="center">N/A</td></tr><tr><td align="left">C3H/HeJ</td><td align="center">HIGH</td><td align="center">AA</td><td align="center">AA</td><td align="center">AA</td><td align="center"><bold><italic>AA</italic></bold></td><td align="center">GG</td><td align="center">GG</td><td align="center"><bold><italic>AA</italic></bold></td><td align="center"><bold><italic>GG</italic></bold></td><td align="center"><bold><italic>del</italic></bold></td><td align="center">del</td><td align="center">N/A</td></tr><tr><td align="left">DBA/2J</td><td align="center">HIGH</td><td align="center">AA</td><td align="center">AA</td><td align="center">AA</td><td align="center"><bold><italic>AA</italic></bold></td><td align="center">GG</td><td align="center">GG</td><td align="center"><bold><italic>AA</italic></bold></td><td align="center"><bold><italic>GG</italic></bold></td><td align="center"><bold><italic>del</italic></bold></td><td align="center">del</td><td align="center">N/A</td></tr><tr><td align="left">CAST/EiJ</td><td align="center">HIGH</td><td align="center">GG</td><td align="center">CC</td><td align="center">GG</td><td align="center"><bold><italic>AA</italic></bold></td><td align="center">CC</td><td align="center">TT</td><td align="center"><bold><italic>AA</italic></bold></td><td align="center"><bold><italic>GG</italic></bold></td><td align="center"><bold><italic>TT</italic></bold></td><td align="center">+</td><td align="center">CC</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><p>SNPs are numbered based on position upstream from transcription start site as defined by RefSeq NM_009162,.

More importantly, we have demonstrated that an increase in <italic>Scg5 </italic>expression is correlated with decreases in body weight and obesity in two congenic mouse models and overexpression results in an <italic>in vivo </italic>increase in 7B2 protein levels and PCSK2 enzymatic activity.</p><p>By analyzing the expression of <italic>Scg5 </italic>in multiple segregating populations we have conclusively shown that nearly all of the variation in <italic>Scg5 </italic>expression is due to a strong local-acting variant. In all four crosses surveyed, the eQTL accounted for over 75% of the variation in <italic>Scg5 </italic>expression. Haplotype analysis using a recently generated high-density SNP collection indicated that the most probable location for the <italic>Scg5 </italic>local eQTL quantitative trait nucleotide was the promoter through the first four exons/introns. In the <italic>Scg5 </italic>promoter, four polymorphisms unique to the high-expressing strains were discovered. Of particular interest is del-432, an 11-bp deletion present in all strains except B6 and CAST. Although the deletion is absent in CAST, these mice are polymorphic at position -432 (possessing a T allele instead of the C allele in B6). It is tempting to speculate that this region is important for binding of a transcriptional repressor and that -432 is a key nucleotide.</p><p>The action of <italic>Scg5 </italic>overexpression on body weight may represent either a direct effect of 7B2 or an indirect effect mediated by PCSK2-generated peptides. In this regard, it should be pointed out that it is not yet clear that 7B2 is always regulatory for PCSK2-mediated peptide production. A recent paper showing that the varying 7B2 levels synthesized by two different mouse strains are associated with differential production of glucagon [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>] supports the notion that 7B2 levels do modulate <italic>in vivo </italic>peptide production, possibly by regulation of PCSK2 activity. However, our present results do not support an obligatory association of increased peptide production by increased PCSK2 activity, since we observed no changes in pituitary &#x003b1;-MSH, a PCSK2 product, even though tissue PCSK2 activity increased. While two studies have shown that introduction of 7B2 into cells which lacks all 7B2 production facilitates the generation of PCSK2-mediated peptides [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>], when cells already express some <italic>Scg5</italic>, additional 7B2 introduction does not always increase peptide production. An example is the transfection of <italic>Scg5 </italic>into AtT-20-PC2 cells, a neuroendocrine cell line which endogenously produces 7B2. The additional increase of 7B2 neither increases &#x003b1;-MSH production nor facilitates any other PCSK2-mediated peptide cleavage examined to date [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>] and SNL and IL, unpublished results). Presumably other factors, possibly cell- or tissue-specific, can override any effects of additional <italic>Scg5 </italic>expression to limit the total amount of peptide made. In this regard it is important to note that we measured PCSK2-mediated peptide production only in pituitary; PCSK2/7B2 effects may also occur in other tissues more intimately involved in energy homeostasis, such as the hypothalamus.</p><p>If the action of 7B2 on body weight homeostasis is not mediated via generation of PCSK2-mediated peptides, then it may result from a direct effect of 7B2 itself. It is currently impossible to speculate on the mechanism for this effect; however, this interesting pan-neuronal protein may have many unexplored roles. A recent paper describes the association of human neuroblastomas with the epigenetic down-regulation of 7B2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. In this study, loss of 7B2 expression was associated with increased tumor formation, suggesting that 7B2 expression may contribute to the maintenance of neuronal differentiation.</p><p>Although we have provided several lines of evidence supporting the role of <italic>Scg5 </italic>in body weight regulation, that is in agreement with a prior knockout study demonstrating an increase in body weight in the absence of <italic>Scg5 </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>], we have not demonstrated a direct causal link between <italic>Scg5 </italic>overexpression and reductions in body weight. It is possible that the local eQTL, regulating <italic>Scg5 </italic>expression, is in tight linkage with the actual causal variant(s) responsible for <italic>Wg5</italic>. It will take additional studies, such as generating a <italic>Scg5 </italic>transgenic mouse to confirm its involvement in body weight regulation.</p><p>In the current study we have shown that in addition to the effects of the strong eQTL, <italic>Scg5 </italic>is up-regulated in HG mice, suggesting that this gene is responsive to growth hormone signaling.

These values were analyzed with SAS using a linear model that included the fixed effects of genotype [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>7B2 Radioimmunoassays</title><p>Pituitaries were homogenized by sonication in 250 &#x003bc;l of ice-cold 0.1 N HCl. The samples were stored frozen, thawed, and centrifuged for 15 min at 13,000 rpm (17,383 &#x000d7; <italic>g</italic>) at 4&#x000b0;C. The supernatant was lyophilized and resuspended in 0.5 ml of radioimmunoassay (RIA) buffer (100 mM sodium phosphate, pH 7.4, containing 0.1% heat-treated BSA, 50 mM NaCl, and 0.1% sodium azide). All samples were stored frozen at -70&#x000b0;C until use. For 7B2 assays, 50 &#x003bc;l of pituitary samples were subjected to assay in duplicate. The polyclonal antiserum against 7B2 (LSU13BF), directed against residues 23&#x02013;39 of 7B2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>], was used to detect 7B2. <sup>125</sup>I-labeled 7B2 was prepared by the chloramine-T method originally described by Hunter and Greenwood [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>] RIAs were carried out according to protocols described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>]. Samples were incubated with 10,000 cpm of iodinated peptide and the appropriate dilution of rabbit antiserum in a final volume of 300 &#x003bc;l at 4&#x000b0;C overnight. To separate the antibody-bound labeled peptide from the unbound labeled peptide, 1 ml of 25% polyethylene glycol and 100 &#x003bc;l of 7.5% carrier bovine &#x003b3;-globulin (in PBS) were added. The samples were vortexed, kept on ice for 30 min, and then centrifuged for 20 min at 3,000 &#x000d7; g at 4&#x000b0;C using a Sorvall RT6000B refrigerated centrifuge. The supernatant was aspirated, and the radioactivity in the pellets was determined. These values were analyzed with SAS using a linear model that included the fixed effects of genotype [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>&#x003b1;-MSH and ACTH assays</title><p>10 &#x003bc;l of a 1/200 dilution pituitary sample in RIA buffer were subjected to assay in duplicate. The polyclonal anti-&#x003b1;-MSH antiserum was commercially purchased from Chemicon (Temecula, CA). &#x003b1;-MSH assays were performed as described above. ACTH assays were carried out using the two-site Nichols human ACTH<sub>1&#x02013;39 </sub>assay kit (Nichols Institute, San Juan Capistrano, CA). The <sup>125</sup>I-ACTH antibody used in this kit is directed towards both N-terminal and C-terminal regions of intact ACTH molecule and does not recognize ACTH cleavage products. These values were analyzed with SAS using a linear model that included the fixed effects of genotype [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>].</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>CRF, IL and JFM conceived the study.
