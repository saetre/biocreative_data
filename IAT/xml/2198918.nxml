We demonstrated that <italic>rbp4 </italic>expression was negatively regulated by Nodal and Hedgehog (Hh) signalling and positively controlled by retinoic acid (RA). Knockdown of Rbp4 in the YSL resulted in shortened yolk extension as well as the formation of two liver buds, which could be due to impaired migration of liver progenitor cells. <italic>rbp4 </italic>appears also to regulate the extracellular matrix protein Fibronectin1 (Fn1) specifically in the ventro-lateral yolk, indicating a role of Fn1 in liver progenitor migration. Since exocrine pancreas, endocrine pancreas, intestine and heart developed normally in Rbp4 morphants, we suggest that <italic>rbp4 </italic>expression in the YSL is required only for liver development.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>The characteristic expression pattern of <italic>rbp4 </italic>suggests that the YSL is patterned despite its syncytial nature.

The YSL performs several early developmental functions such as yolk metabolism, nutrient transport [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>], utilization of maternally stored morphogenetic substances including retinoids [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>], and epiboly movement [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. It also plays a morphogenetic role during gastrulation in induction and patterning of mesoderm, endoderm and dorsal structures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. However, there is little information on the function of the YSL after epiboly is completed. Recently it has been reported that the YSL-specific factor Mtx1 plays a role in migration of myocardial precursor cells and knockdown of Mtx1 in the YSL resulted in <italic>cardia bifida </italic>and duplication of liver and pancreatic buds. Based on these results it has been proposed that the YSL regulates migration of endodermal cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>].</p><p>Rbp4 is produced in the adult liver and functions as a specific transporter of retinol in vertebrate plasma. Expression of <italic>rbp4 </italic>has been studied in several model animals. During embryonic development of rodents it is expressed only in the visceral extra-embryonic endoderm of the yolk sac, suggesting that Rbp4 may play roles in mediating retinol transfer from maternal blood to the developing fetus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. Similar expression has also been reported in chick [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. In zebrafish, <italic>rbp4 </italic>has been reported to be expressed in the YSL, hypochord and skin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. It is of interest to analyse the role of <italic>rbp4 </italic>in zebrafish development.</p><p>The liver is an important endodermal organ, which exerts both endocrine and exocrine functions. Many studies have revealed that the molecular mechanisms of liver development are conserved in vertebrates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. Furthermore, cell fate mapping experiments in zebrafish, frog and mouse have also indicated that the liver arises, at least in part, from different groups of endodermal cells found initially in bilateral regions on both sides of the midline [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. Despite this progress the mechanism of liver bud formation in zebrafish is not fully understood. According to one hypothesis based to a large extent on observations of gutGFP transgenic zebrafish, the early endoderm forms as an endodermal rod, which starts to bud and gives rise to several primordia including the liver primordium which grows mainly due to cell proliferation within the primordium [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. A conflicting view based on analysis of different molecular markers implies that whereas the digestive anlagen of amniotes arise from a primitive gut tube, the zebrafish digestive system is assembled from individual organ anlage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. In addition, based on analysis of the expression pattern of <italic>ceruloplasmin </italic>in wild type and mutant zebrafish, migration of progenitor cells from posterior to anterior and towards the midline has been proposed to take place during formation of the liver [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. Recently, this hypothesis has been supported by discovery of the posterior-to-anterior migration of cells between the enveloping layer (EVL) and YSL, which is linked to the formation of the yolk cell extension (YCE; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]).</p><p>In this study, we demonstrated that early expression of <italic>rbp4 </italic>in the YSL is restricted only to the ventro-lateral YSL. <italic>rbp4 </italic>expression is negatively controlled by Nodal and Hh signalling pathways and positively regulated by RA. The YSL-specific knockdown of Rbp4 caused inhibition of the YCE formation and formation of two liver buds. Thus, Rbp4 probably plays a role in morphogenesis of the yolk cell and formation of the liver bud.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Expression of <italic>rbp4 </italic>mRNAs</title><p>The EST clone coding for Rbp4 (A 10) from our collection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>] was selected and sequenced completely.

To investigate the temporal expression pattern of <italic>rbp4 </italic>in early development, <italic>rbp4 </italic>transcripts were analyzed by RT-PCR from fertilized eggs to 14 hpf.

Transcripts of <italic>rbp4 </italic>were detected from 12 hpf on the yolk surface anterior to the head. This expression domain was confined to the ventro-lateral yolk cell (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B, C</xref>). At 16 hpf, <italic>rbp4 </italic>expression increased and expanded posteriorly but remained confined to the ventro-lateral yolk cell (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1D</xref>). To define this expression domain in detail, two-colour WISH using <italic>ctsL </italic>(<italic>cathepsinL</italic>, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]) and <italic>rbp4 </italic>probes was performed at 16 hpf. <italic>ctsL </italic>was expressed in the hatching gland mesoderm around the head as expected, while the anterior end of the <italic>rbp4 </italic>expression domain was found to spread under the head (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1D</xref>). A cross section indicated that <italic>ctsL </italic>and <italic>rbp4 </italic>were expressed in different layers of tissue (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1E, G</xref>). DAPI staining clearly revealed that the enlarged nuclei, characteristic of the YSL, were surrounded by <italic>rbp4 </italic>transcripts (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1F, F'</xref>), while the superficial cellular layer or the enveloping layer was free of <italic>rbp4 </italic>transcripts. Thus, the expression of <italic>rbp</italic>4 on the surface of the yolk cell was probably confined to the YSL. To the best of our knowledge this is the first molecular marker of the ventro-lateral YSL.</p><p>At 24 hpf, <italic>rbp4 </italic>expression in the YSL is restricted to its posterior part including that in the YCE (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>). This expression pattern remained unchanged at least until 48 hpf (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>).

In mutants affecting Nodal signalling (<italic>cyc </italic>and <italic>oep</italic>) (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2E, F</xref>), <italic>rbp4 </italic>expression expanded anteriorly and covered the whole yolk. Similar changes of expression pattern were also observed in mutants that affected components of the Hh signalling pathway, <italic>smu </italic>(Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2G</xref>), <italic>syu </italic>(Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2H</xref>) and <italic>yot </italic>(not shown). As the restricted expression pattern of <italic>rbp4 </italic>was lost at 48 hpf in these mutants, it is likely that the early expression pattern of <italic>rbp4 </italic>in the YSL is under negative regulation of the Nodal and Hedgehog signaling pathways, which prevent the <italic>rbp4 </italic>expression in the anterior and dorsal YSL.</p><p>In the <italic>mib</italic><sup><italic>tfi91 </italic></sup>mutant which has a nonsense mutation in the gene encoding E3 ubiquitin ligase involved in ubiqutination of Delta, a ligand of Notch signaling, Delta is up-regulated causing premature differentiation of neural progenitor cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. The restricted <italic>rbp4 </italic>expression pattern in the YSL was maintained, but the expression in the liver appeared much earlier than that in control embryos (48 hpf vs. 96 hpf). In addition, the <italic>rbp4 </italic>expression in the liver of <italic>mib</italic><sup><italic>tfi91</italic>-/+ </sup>heterozygotes also appeared prematurely but the expression domain was smaller than that in <italic>mib</italic><sup><italic>tfi91</italic>-/- </sup>homozygotes (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2I</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2J</xref>). Further analysis of another allele of <italic>mib </italic>mutant, <italic>mib</italic><sup><italic>ta52b</italic></sup>, demonstrated that the expression domain of <italic>rbp4 </italic>in the liver is larger in the <italic>mib</italic><sup><italic>ta52b </italic></sup>allele (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2K</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2L</xref>) than that in the <italic>mib</italic><sup><italic>tfi91 </italic></sup>allele. This is in accordance with the fact that <italic>mib</italic><sup><italic>ta52b</italic>-/- </sup>allele is a stronger dominant negative mutation, while the <italic>mib</italic><sup><italic>tfi91</italic>-/- </sup>allele is a weaker null allele [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>].</p><p>Analyses of embryos of two mutant lines with defects in formation of axial mesoderm, <italic>spt </italic>and <italic>ntl</italic>, did not show obvious changes in expression pattern of <italic>rbp4 </italic>from 16 hpf to 24 hpf, suggesting that the formation of axial mesoderm probably does not influence events involving <italic>rbp4 </italic>in the YSL (not shown).</p></sec><sec><title>RA positively regulates rbp4 expression in the YSL</title><p>Retinol is the precursor of RA, which plays important roles in many aspects of development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. In order to examine whether RA could regulate <italic>rbp4 </italic>expression, different doses of RA and DEAB (4-diethylaminobenzaldehyde), an inhibitor of RA synthesis acting through inhibition of retinaldehyde dehydrogenase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>], were applied to wild type embryos starting from 12 hpf, 16 hpf and 18 hpf, respectively. Control embryos were soaked in 0.1% DMSO/egg water. WISH on 48 hpf embryos with the <italic>rbp4 </italic>probe showed that in all cases RA treatment caused expansion of <italic>rbp4 </italic>expression (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2M</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2N</xref>). In contrast, DEAB treatment caused reduction of <italic>rbp4 </italic>expression (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2O</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2P</xref>). Thus, RA positively regulates <italic>rbp4 </italic>expression in the YSL. It is interesting to note that the phenotypes were more severe when the treatment was initiated early. In the RA treatment group, <italic>rbp4 </italic>expression was generally stronger in embryos treated from 12 hpf (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2M</xref>) than that from 18 hpf (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2N</xref>). In the DEAB treatment group, the yolk extension was affected more severely when the treatment was started from 12 hpf than from 18 hpf. The embryos treated from 12 hpf showed no yolk extension (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2O</xref>) or a very short one, whereas the embryos treated from 18 hpf showed only mild shortening of the yolk extension (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2P</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Functional analysis of <italic>Rbp4 </italic>in zebrafish by morpholino knockdown</title><p>To study the role of <italic>rbp4 </italic>during early development, the morpholino knockdown technique was employed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]. Since the initial expression of <italic>rbp4 </italic>occurs in the YSL, we first focused on a role of this gene in this structure. For this purpose we used the YSL-targeted injection of anti-Rbp4 morpholino (MO) (see Methods for details). Two anti-Rbp4 MOs were designed, one for translation blocking by targeting the 5'-ATG area (ATG-MO) and the other to block splicing by targeting the junction of the 2<sup>nd </sup>exon and 2<sup>nd </sup>intron (Spl-MO). After injection of the ATG-MO, the morphants developed relatively normally at least until 16 hpf, but approximately 20% of injected embryos developed a shorter YCE and much larger yolk cell (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>). Furthermore, the whole yolk cell of morphants became abnormally dark at 4&#x02013;5 dpf and they died soon after. Injection of Spl-MO generated morphants with this phenotype more efficiently and in a dose-dependant manner (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>). At a low dose (0.4 pmol), the YCE in 58.3% of morphants was shorter than that in controls. At a medium dose (0.8 pmol), 87.3% of morphants displayed abnormal YCE: 77.1% featured short YCE and 10.2% lacked it completely (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B, C, E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3F</xref>). At a high dose (1.3 pmol), 93.5% of morphants were affected and the fraction lacking YCE increased to 27.3%. To verify the specificity of Spl-MO, a 5 nucleotide mismatched morpholino (Mis-MO) was also synthesized and tested, and there was no noticeable change in the YCE (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>).</p><table-wrap position="float" id="T1"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Morphological phenotype of <italic>rbp4 </italic>morphants</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><td align="center">Phenotype\MO</td><td align="center">Total</td><td align="center">Type I (no YCE)</td><td align="center">Type II (short YCE)</td><td align="center">Normal</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="center">ATG MO (0.8 pm)</td><td align="center">125</td><td align="center">0.0%</td><td align="center">20.0%</td><td align="center">80.0%</td></tr><tr><td align="center">Spl MO (0.4 pm)</td><td align="center">48</td><td align="center">0.0%</td><td align="center">58.3%</td><td align="center">41.7%</td></tr><tr><td align="center">Spl MO (0.8 pm)</td><td align="center">166</td><td align="center">10.2%</td><td align="center">77.1%</td><td align="center">12.7%</td></tr><tr><td align="center">Spl MO (1.3 pm)</td><td align="center">77</td><td align="center">27.3%</td><td align="center">66.2%</td><td align="center">6.5%</td></tr><tr><td align="center">Mis-MO(0.8 pm)</td><td align="center">65</td><td align="center">0.0%</td><td align="center">0.0%</td><td align="center">100.0%</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><fig position="float" id="F3"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p><bold>Effects of Rbp4 splicing MO on morphology of embryos</bold>.

When PCR extension time was set at 0.5 minute, F2 +R1 would only amplify the unspliced transcripts and no genomic DNA would be amplified due to presence of the large 4<sup>th </sup>intron (3 kb). Similarly, primers F1+R1 would amplify only the correctly spliced <italic>rbp4 </italic>transcripts but not genomic DNA or unspliced rbp4 template. As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3H</xref>, correctly spliced <italic>rbp4 </italic>transcripts were reduced and the unspliced transcripts were present in 24 hpf morphants (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3H</xref>). Sequence analysis also confirmed that the PCR fragment contained the unspliced intron (not shown). Protein sequence prediction from the unspliced transcript showed a premature stop codon after 10 amino acid residues. As a result, the unspliced transcript encoded only the signal peptide. Furthermore, RT-PCR was performed on 24 hpf uninjected control and Mis-MO injected embryos using the same pairs of primers as for the Spl-MO. As shown in Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3H</xref>, the level of correctly spliced <italic>rbp4 </italic>transcripts in the Mis-MO injected embryos was similar to that of control while unspliced transcripts were not detectable in the Mis-MO injected embryos. Thus, these experimental data demonstrated that the anti-Rbp4 Spl-MO efficiently blocked the processing of <italic>rbp4 </italic>mRNA.</p></sec><sec><title>Liver development in Rbp4 morphants</title><p>To study the developmental changes in the morphants, several markers expressed in the YSL and endodermal organs were employed. The liver marker <italic>transferrin </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>] indicated two liver buds on both sides of the body axis in embryos injected with either ATG-MO or Spl-MO injection, but not in Mis-MO injected embryos (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref>). Compared with 27.6% of ATG-MO morphants with two liver buds, a much higher percentage (72.1%) of Spl-MO morphants showed this phenotype (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref>). The two liver buds were either connected with each other or separated (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A&#x02013;D</xref>). This phenotype also appeared in a dose-dependant manner; the high dose of Spl-MO caused an increase in a number of morphants with separated liver buds (data not shown). Duplication of liver or other unpaired visceral organs such as pancreas, heart and interrenal gland have been previously observed in mutants with defective midline formation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>]. In order to examine whether the phenomenon of duplicated liver in Rbp4 morphants was also due to midline defects, several midline markers were evaluated in the morphants at 18 and 24 hpf. <italic>shh </italic>(Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4G, H</xref>),<italic>no tail </italic>and <italic>twhh </italic>were expressed normally suggesting that formation of the notochord and floor plate was not affected. Therefore the duplication of the liver bud in Rbp4 morphants is not related to defects in midline formation. To further analyze liver morphology, cross-section of 48 hpf morphants was performed. From anterior to posterior, the two liver buds contain several layers of cells similar to that in control (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4E, F</xref>). Thus it seems that the two liver buds undergo at least initial stages of hepatogenesis. At the same time, these sections also showed that the gut was normal. In contrast to the YSL-injection, injection of morpholino at 1-cell stage resulted in a lower percentage of the duplicated liver phenotype (5.8%, n = 52). In addition, defects in the brain and tail were observed (data not shown), indicating Rbp4 may have other functions during development. While this study focused on a role of Rbp4 during liver development, other functions of Rbp4 will be analyzed in future.</p><table-wrap position="float" id="T2"><label>Table 2</label><caption><p>Evaluation of <italic>rbp4 </italic>morphants by <italic>transferrin </italic>expression</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><td align="center">Phenotype\MO</td><td align="center">Total</td><td align="center">Two-sided</td><td align="center">No-expression</td><td align="center">Left-sided</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="center">ATGMO (0.8 pm)</td><td align="center">58</td><td align="center">27.6%</td><td align="center">0.0%</td><td align="center">72.4%</td></tr><tr><td align="center">Spl MO (0.8 pm)</td><td align="center">122</td><td align="center">72.1%</td><td align="center">7.4%</td><td align="center">20.5%</td></tr><tr><td align="center">Mis-MO (0.8 pm)</td><td align="center">16</td><td align="center">0.0%</td><td align="center">0.0%</td><td align="center">100.0%</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><fig position="float" id="F4"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><p><bold>Analyses of liver and pancreas development in Rbp4 morphants</bold>.

Thus, Rbp4 knockdown causes duplication of the liver but not the pancreas. This suggests that Rbp4 probably plays a role only in early liver development. In addition, we never noticed heart duplication in Rbp4 morphants; this observation was further supported by the fact that the expression of <italic>gata6</italic>, an early endoderm and heart marker [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>], was not affected at 28 hpf (data not shown).</p><p>Migration of endodermal cells towards the midline has been implicated in formation of several visceral organs, including the liver, pancreas, interrenal gland and heart [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>].

However, at 16 hpf when there was a major increase of <italic>rbp4 </italic>mRNA in the YSL, in addition to its normal expression in the hatching gland and tail bud [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>], <italic>foxa3 </italic>expression in the morphant was observed on the ventro-lateral yolk surface in the morphant (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5E</xref>) but not in the control embryos (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5B</xref>).

The homeobox gene <italic>prox1 </italic>is an early marker for the developing liver and pancreas of several vertebrates, including zebrafish, and plays a role in migration of hepatocytes during early liver development of mammals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>]. At 28 hpf, a small dot of <italic>prox1 </italic>expression on the left side of the control embryo defined the liver bud, however, in morphants of the same stage, in addition to the <italic>prox1 </italic>expression in the liver bud on the left side, a line-shaped <italic>prox1 </italic>expression domain was found on the right side and it appeared to cross the midline to the left side (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5G, H</xref>). Such morphological changes in appearance of endodermal cells have been interpreted as evidence of delayed migration of these cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. In control embryos, the liver bud is located at the A-P level of somites 1&#x02013;2. The line-shaped <italic>prox1 </italic>staining in morphants was found at the same A-P level. Cross-sections of morphants showed that the <italic>prox1</italic>-positive cells are indeed in the position of the liver bud just above the yolk, but the morphant liver bud is flatter (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5I, J</xref>). Based on our current observations, it is likely that early hepatocyte precursor cells migrate into the liver bud and these cells are likely of endodermal origin as they expressed <italic>foxa3 </italic>and <italic>prox1 </italic>endoderm markers. The YSL expression of <italic>rbp4 </italic>appears to be necessary for the migration, which likely occurred from 16 hpf when <italic>rbp4 </italic>expression was largely increased (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1D</xref>) until 25&#x02013;28 hpf when liver bud formation is completed (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5G</xref>).</p><p>Previously it has been reported that the YSL-specific transcription factor Mtx1 regulates myocardial cell migration through downregulation of the extracellular matrix protein Fibronectin1 (Fn1) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>].

During early development <italic>rbp4 </italic>is expressed in the YSL of zebrafish [[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>], this study]. Because of peculiarities of embryonic development in fish and mammals, direct comparison of the YSL to the extraembryonic structures in mammals is difficult, but comparison of expression of developmental genes may help to solve this puzzle. <italic>Rbp4 </italic>is expressed in the extra-embryonic endoderm of the yolk sac during embryonic development of the rat, mouse and chick [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. Interestingly, zebrafish <italic>rbp4 </italic>is expressed in the YSL on the surface of the yolk cell [[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>], this study], which, like the yolk sac in mammals, acts as a depot of maternal retinoids in zebrafish [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. These observations suggest functional similarity of these extraembryonic structures in mammals and fish. Further, as suggested by Thomas et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>], the YSL plays an important role in early embryonic patterning similar to that of the anterior visceral endoderm (AVE) in mouse embryos [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>]. Consistent with this, some murine genes homologous to Xenopus genes important in the organizer (e.g. <italic>hex</italic>, <italic>hesx1, lim1, otx2, cer-1</italic>, etc) are also expressed in the AVE [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">53</xref>]; interestingly, the zebrafish <italic>hhex </italic>is also expressed in the dorsal YSL in zebrafish during gastrula stage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">54</xref>].</p><p>Several early developmental genes, including <italic>sqt</italic>, <italic>cas </italic>and <italic>gata5</italic>, are expressed both in the YSL and adjacent vegetal blastomeres [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B55">55</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B58">58</xref>], but the specific roles of these genes in the YSL remain unknown since it is difficult to uncouple these functions from those in the marginal blastoderm. Now it is possible to target the YSL by injecting materials into the YSL only. It has been demonstrated that injections of RNAse into the YSL effectively eliminates YSL transcripts without affecting ubiquitously expressed genes in the blastoderm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. By this approach, important information about early function of YSL in the formation of ventro-lateral mesoderm and induction of Nodal-related genes in the ventro-lateral marginal blastomeres has been obtained [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>].</p><p>However, the specific function of genes expressed in the late YSL remains largely unknown. While a number of genes are expressed in the YSL ubiquitously (e.g. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B59">59</xref>]), <italic>zangptl2 </italic>is probably the only one with restricted posterior expression pattern in the YSL [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B60">60</xref>]. Our current work on zebrafish <italic>rbp4 </italic>expression in the YSL provides another example illustrating patterning of the YSL. This non-uniform expression pattern suggests that at this stage the YSL could be patterned along the A-P and D-V axes. Consistent with this idea, the distinct morphogenetic domains in the YSL have been reported previously based on migration of its nuclei, though the underlying molecular mechanism remains unknown [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B61">61</xref>]. The restricted expression of <italic>rbp4 </italic>in the YSL opens a question about mechanisms of such restriction, which we answered to some extent by demonstrating that the Nodal and Hh signalling pathways [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B62">62</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B63">63</xref>] negatively control expression of <italic>rbp4 </italic>similar to that of <italic>ceruloplasmin </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. At the same time, RA seems to positively regulate expression of <italic>rbp4 </italic>in the YSL.</p><p>The effects of these signalling pathways on liver development require further experimental efforts. In our preliminary experiments, we noticed that both RA and DEAB led to no liver when the treatment was performed before but not after 16 hpf (data not shown). Although RA signalling could regulate <italic>rbp4 </italic>expression, it is difficult to conclude the involvement of Rbp4 in the RA signalling in regulation of liver development because of the pleitropic effect of RA. Nodal and Hh signalling pathways have been reported to play important roles in zebrafish endoderm development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B64">64</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B71">71</xref>]. In our preliminary analyses using the Nodal and Hh mutants, most of them (<italic>cyc</italic><sup>-/-</sup><italic>, smu</italic><sup>-/-</sup><italic>, syu</italic><sup>-/-</sup><italic>, oep</italic><sup>-/- </sup>and <italic>cas</italic><sup>-/-</sup>) showed either smaller or no liver (data not shown). Only <italic>sqt</italic><sup>-/- </sup>showed duplicated liver formation, which is probably due to its midline defect [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B72">72</xref>] as reported for another midline defect mutant <italic>flh</italic><sup>-/- </sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>]. However, liver bud duplication in Rbp4 morphant is unlikely due to the midline defect because the midline structure was remained normal in the Rbp4 morphant (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4G, H</xref>).</p><p>While it is widely accepted that the YSL plays a leading role during epiboly [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B73">73</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B74">74</xref>], little information is available about the function of YSL after epiboly. It is not known whether the YSL at this stage influences the overlying cells just like that during early gastrulation or, alternatively, the embryo proper influences the patterning of the extraembryonic structures including the YSL. We discovered at least two different functions of Rbp4 within the YSL. First, Rbp4 deficiency results in abnormality of the YCE. Interestingly, <italic>rbp4 </italic>starts to be expressed in the YSL a few hours before the formation of YCE. While the exact molecular mechanism behind the YCE formation is not known, it has been suggested that the YCE formation is influenced by the posterior to anterior migration of cells between the yolk and EVL. These cells accumulate at the level of YCE and could be responsible for YCE formation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>].</p><p>Second, Rbp4 is involved in the formation of the liver bud. As Rbp4 is not expressed in the endoderm during this process, its contribution is probably indirect through its role in the YSL. During organogenesis different cell lineages migrate to establish anlage of various organs and differentiate thereafter. Recently it has been reported that the YSL-specific factor Mtx1 plays a role in migration of myocardial precursor cells and posterior endoderm, as knockdown of Mtx1 in the YSL results in <italic>cardia bifida </italic>due to a failure of myocardial cells to migrate to the midline. In parallel, 30% of Mtx1 morphants developed duplicated hepatic and pancreatic buds [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. Moreover, duplication of liver bud has been also observed in other studies. Ober et al [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B75">75</xref>] have reported that Vegfc is required for coalescence of anterior endoderm to the midline and knockdown of Vegfc results in formation of a forked gut tube and duplicated buds of liver and pancreas. Similarly, Matsui et al [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B76">76</xref>] have also reported a new role of non-canonical Wnt signalling during migration of precursor cells toward the midline. The down-regulation of Wnt/Dvl/RhoA signalling leads to the failure of fusion of the anterior gut tube and formation of duplicated livers and pancreas; in addition, migration of myocardial precursors toward the midline is also affected. In contrast to these observations, knockdown of Rbp4 has no effects on migration of heart precursors and the formation of the gut and pancreatic bud. Instead, the deficiency of Rbp4 causes a more limited effect resulting in formation of duplicated liver buds only. Consistent with this, we observed in the Rbp4 morphants that the cell migration molecule Fn1 is specifically reduced in the ventro-lateral region of the yolk, where the <italic>rbp4 </italic>is normally expressed, but not in the myocardia progenitors; Meanwhile, the ectopic expression of <italic>foxa3 </italic>appears specifically in the ventro-lateral region of the yolk. The ventro-lateral increase of <italic>foxa3 </italic>and decrease of <italic>fn1 </italic>suggested that the cells above the <italic>rbp4</italic>-expressing YSL are probable hepatocyte progenitors which will migrate from the ventro-lateral yolk toward the midline depending on a Rbp4-Fn1 signalling pathway. Thus, the effect of Rbp4 is limited probably only to hepatocyte progenitors.</p><p>Recently, two conflicting hypotheses of organogenesis of zebrafish visceral organs have been proposed. One emphasizes the formation of the endodermal rod by migration of endodermal cells towards the midline and budding of all major endodermal organs from the rod ([<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>], reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]) while the other puts more weight on the establishment of independent primordia of these organs and their later assembly [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. Based on the data available, we suggest a unified theory of formation of endodermal organs; i.e. following the formation of the endodermal rod through convergence of the endodermal cells at the midline and the budding of organ primordia, there is continued cell migration from posterior to anterior and from lateral to medial, adding more cells to the buds of organs. Previously, based on analysis of expression pattern of <italic>ceruloplasmin </italic>in the wild type and mutant zebrafish, migration of liver progenitors from both sides of the yolk cell to the midline has been postulated during formation of the liver bud and a role of midline signaling in this process has been illustrated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. Migration of liver progenitors is probably a part of a more general process of migration of endodermal cells that contributes also to organogenesis of the pancreas, interrenal gland and heart [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>]. Thus cell migration during the late phase of formation of visceral organs seems to be rather common in zebrafish. Similarly, it has been shown in mice by cell fate mapping that there are different groups of liver precursor cells which migrate to form the liver bud [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. Our analysis of Rbp4 morphants demonstrated that on the surface of the yolk there are two spatially separated populations of liver precursor cells found on both sides of the midline as proposed earlier [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. It seems that these cells require an input from the YSL for proper migration. In the present study, we demonstrated that the YSL-expressed Rbp4 is necessary for migration of liver progenitors towards the midline and formation of a single liver bud.</p><p>Rbp4 is the extracellular transporter of retinol, a precursor of RA that has been implicated in regulation of cell migration as a stimulator and as an inhibitor of this process depending on the cellular context [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B77">77</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B79">79</xref>]. It stimulates neuronal migration in the zebrafish hindbrain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B80">80</xref>]. In view of these earlier observations, our current data suggest that retinoids could play a role in regulating migration of early hepatic cells during the process of liver formation. Given the fact that during the course of our analysis we only evaluated molecular markers and morphology of the heart, pancreas and liver, retinoids could be involved in regulation of cell migration during formation of some other visceral organs that were not analysed here. The developmental roles of Rbp4 in zebrafish revealed in this study should also be considered within a much more general context of metabolism of retinoids in extraembryonic structures that seems to be evolutionarily conserved in all vertebrates studied so far([<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>], reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B81">81</xref>]).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Rbp4 is traditionally considered to function as a retinol binding protein of the serum. Here we showed that during embryogenesis <italic>rbp4 </italic>mRNA was expressed only in the ventro-lateral YSL and later this expression expanded to cover the posterior YSL in early zebrafish embryos. <italic>rbp4 </italic>expression was negatively regulated by Nodal and Hh signalling and positively controlled by RA. This restricted expression pattern suggested that despite being a syncytium the YSL is patterned. Later <italic>rbp4 </italic>was expressed in the liver. Knockdown of Rbp4 in the YSL resulted in shortened yolk extension as well as the formation of two liver buds, which could be due to impaired migration of liver precursor cells. In contrast, exocrine and endocrine pancreas, intestine and heart developed normally in Rbp4 morphants. Thus we suggest that <italic>rbp4 </italic>expression in the YSL is required only for liver development.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Fish maintenance</title><p>Zebrafish were maintained in the fish facilities at the Department of Biological Sciences, National University of Singapore and the Institute of Molecular and Cell Biology in Singapore according to established protocols [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B82">82</xref>] and in compliance with Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) guidelines.

Embryos were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA), hybridized with the Dig-labeled RNA probe in hybridization buffer (50% formamide, 5XSSC, 50 &#x003bc;g/ml tRNA and 0.1% Tween 20) at 68&#x000b0;C, followed by incubation with anti-Dig antibody conjugated with alkaline phosphatase (AP) and staining with the substrates, NBT (nitro blue tetrazolium) and BCIP (5-bromo, 4-chloro, 3-indolil phosphate).</p><p>Two-colour WISH was performed using a combination of the Dig- and fluorescein-labelled probes. For hybridization, two probes were added to the same tube and the embryos were incubated at 68&#x000b0;C overnight. After the first staining with AP-conjugated anti-Fluorescein antibody using Fast Red as substrate to obtain red staining, the embryos were incubated with 0.1 M glycine (pH 2.2) at room temperature for 30 minutes to remove the phosphatase activity. Then the embryos were washed four times (10 minutes each) with PBST (phosphate-buffered saline with 0.1% Tween 20) and incubated in blocking buffer (5% Blocking reagent in malic acid buffer; Roche, Germany) at room temperature for 1 hour. The second staining was performed using AP-conjugated anti-DIG antibody and the substrates, NBT and BCIP, to produce purple precipitates.</p><p>For sectioning, the stained embryos were embedded in 1.5% Bactoagar- 5% sucrose and the block containing the embryo was trimmed in desired orientation. The block was then cryoprotected in 30% sucrose at 4&#x000b0;C overnight, mounted into the cryo-mounting media, frozen in liquid nitrogen vapour and sectioned in the cryostat (Microm, Germany). 10&#x02013;15 &#x003bc;m sections were fixed with 4% PFA in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) for 10 min, washed with PBS and mounted in 1:1 PBS:glycerol for observation.</p></sec><sec><title>Nuclear Staining</title><p>For nuclear staining 10&#x02013;15 &#x003bc;m sections were equilibrated briefly with phosphate buffered saline (PBS). Approximately 300 &#x003bc;L of 300 nM DAPI (4'6-diamidino-2-phenylindole-dihydrochloride) in PBS was applied to the section and incubated for 5 minutes. The sections were then rinsed several times in PBS and mounted in glycerol/PBS (1:1), followed by observations under a fluorescence microscope (excitation 358 nm, emission 461 nm).</p></sec><sec><title>Morpholino microinjection into YSL</title><p>Three Rpb4 antisense norpholino oligonucletides were designed and used in the present study: ATG-MO, 5' GAGCCTTAACATACTGCCTCTGTGC 3'; Sp1-MO, 5' GTTGACTTACCCTCGTTCTGTTAAA 3' and Mis-MO,</p><p>5' GTTcACTTAgCgTCcTTCTcTTAAA 3' (the mismatch nucleic acids are in lower case) Microinjection of MO into YSL was performed at 4 hpf stage. The embryos were mounted at proper orientation into pre-made 3% agar wells with egg water (0.3% sea salt, Red Sea brand). The tip of a microinjection pipette was positioned at the blastoderm margin area close to the junction of blastomeres and the yolk. 0.5&#x02013;1.0 nl of solution containing a defined dose of morpholino and fluorescent marker (Fluorescein or Texas Red labelled 70 kDa dextran) was injected into wild type (AB strain) or <italic>Tg(ins:gfp) </italic>embryos. Usually over 90% of injected embryos showed evenly distributed fluorescent dye in the YSL and these embryos were used for further analyses.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>ZL performed all experiments, developed working hypotheses and wrote the manuscript.
