We therefore sought to compare the two forms of apoA-I using liver-directed somatic gene transfer in hypercholesterinemic mice &#x02013; a model which is most adequately mimicking the clinical setting.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods and results</title><p>Vectors based on AAV serotype 8 (AAV2.8) encoding wtApoA-I, ApoA-I<sub>M </sub>or green fluorescent protein (GFP) as control were constructed.

Transgenic overexpression of wtApoA-I in liver substantially reduces progression of atherosclerosis in mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>] and rabbits [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. Furthermore, somatic gene transfer of wtApoA-I to liver using adenoviral vectors reduces progression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>] and induces regression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>] of atherosclerosis.</p><p>ApoA-I Milano (ApoA-I<sub>M</sub>) is a rare, naturally-occurring Arg173Cys point mutation in ApoA-I. Heterozygosity for ApoA-I<sub>M </sub>is associated with very low levels of HDL-C but no apparent increased risk of CHD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. ApoA-I<sub>M </sub>has been studied extensively with regard to effects on atherosclerosis, including infusion and genetic expression in animals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>] and even in a clinical trial of repeated intravenous infusion of an a ApoA-I<sub>M </sub>/phospholipid complexes in patients with CHD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. It has been suggested that ApoA-I<sub>M </sub>may be a gain-of-function mutation. Indeed, a recent study perfomed by Shan did show a superior atheroprotective effect of ApoA-I<sub>M </sub>compared to wtApoA-I transduced macrophages after bone marrow transplantation into ApoAI/ApoE double knock-out mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. In contrast to that, female ApoA-I<sub>M </sub>knock-in animals are characterized by higher serum cholesterol levels and the development of larger atherosclerotic lesions compared to ApoA-I knock-in mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. Due to the major differences in outcome of these studies and the lack of resemblance to the clinical setting in which patients with normal ApoA-I levels are treated with a systemically delivered ApoA-I or ApoA-I<sub>M </sub>mimetic compound, we wanted to elucidate the effects of wtApoA-I or ApoA-I<sub>M </sub>overexpression in a mouse model susceptible for atherosclerosis.</p><p>Adeno-associated viral (AAV) vectors have been shown to be capable of stable gene transfer and hepatic expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. First-generation AAV vectors have been used to express wtApoA-I in mouse liver [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>] and ApoA-I<sub>M </sub>in mouse muscle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>], but in both cases the levels of expression and plasma concentrations were extremely low compared with normal ApoA-I levels in mice and humans. Much greater expression can be obtained using vectors based on AAV serotype 8 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. A comparative study of AAV serotypes delivered intraportally showed that AAV8-based vectors achieved the highest levels of hepatic transgene expression and ranged from 16 to 110 times greater than that of AAV2; gene transfer from AAV2/7 was intermediate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>].</p><p>Therefore, in the current study we used AAV8-based vectors to express wtApoA-I and ApoA-I<sub>M </sub>in LDLreceptor deficient mice to test whether AAV-based overexpression of ApoA-I would reduce progression of atherosclerosis in this model and whether wtApoA-I and ApoA-I<sub>M </sub>differed in their effects on atherosclerosis.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Vectors</title><p>Transgenes were human wtApoA-I and human apoA-I-Milano for the treatment groups and green fluorescent protein (eGFP) for the control group. The human ApoA-I-Milano gene was cloned via site directed mutagenesis of the wtApoA-I plasmid by PCR. Correct cloning was confirmed by sequencing and restriction digests. To produce AAV vectors encapsidated in an AAV8 capsid (AAV2.8), a pseudotyping strategy was performed as reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. Vectors were purified using a standard cesium sedimentation method and titers were determined via TaqMan analysis using probes and primers targeting the BGH poly(A+) region of the vectors.</p></sec><sec><title>Animal studies</title><p>LDL receptor deficient mice on C57BL/6 background (LDLR-/- mice) were purchased from the Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME, USA) and maintained as a breeding colony. Mice were given unrestricted access to water. Male mice were put on western diet (0.15% cholesterol, 21% butterfat, DYETS, PA) for 8 weeks. After this time period, one group of animals was killed to determine the amount of atherosclerosis development at baseline. The remaining animals were randomly divided into 3 groups and injected intraportally with AAV2.8-TBG-wtApoA-I, AAV2.8-TBG-ApoA-I<sub>M</sub>, or AAV2.8-TBG-GFP at a dose 1 &#x000d7; 10e12 genome copies/mouse, tail vein injection. Animals remained on a western diet for 6 weeks thereafter and were then sacrificed. From all animals blood was obtained at least two times before and at designated time-points after gene transfer.

First, we demonstrate using an AAV8-based vector to express wild-type human ApoA-I in the livers of atherosclerosis-prone mice that expression of ApoA-I is of sufficient extent and duration to significantly slow the progression of atherosclerosis. Second, in a direct comparison, we demonstrate that while expression of ApoA-I<sub>M </sub>also significantly slowed progression of atherosclerosis compared with controls, it did not differ significantly from wtApoA-I with regard to effects on atherosclerosis.</p><p>While somatic gene transfer of wtApoA-I to liver using adenoviral vectors has been shown to reduce progression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>] and even induce regression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>] of atherosclerosis in mice, expression is transient and associated with substantial inflammation. In contrast, expression of wtApoA-I using these AAV8-based vectors was stable for 6 weeks and was associated with no increases in liver transaminases (data not shown). Importantly, expression and plasma levels of wtApoA-I were substantially higher than were seen using first generation AAV vectors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. This allowed us to reliably compare two different forms of ApoA-I, wild-type and Milano, with regard to their effects on atherosclerosis.</p><p>Previous studies have already evaluated the effects of bone marrow transplantations with retrovirally ApoA-I or ApoA-I<sub>M </sub>transduced macrophages into hyperlipidemic ApoA-I/ApoE double knock out mice. In this experimental setting selective overexpression of wtApoA-I or ApoA-I<sub>M </sub>in macrophages significantly decreased aortic atherosclerosis as well as atherosclerotic plaque macrophage immunoreactivity, effects which were more pronounced with ApoA-I<sub>M </sub>compared to wtApoA-I [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. In a second study the phenotype of ApoA-I or ApoA-I<sub>M </sub>knock-in mice on an atherosclerosis prone ApoB/ApoAII background was analyzed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>] with the finding of a less favorable lipid profile and a more pronounced atherosclerosis development in female ApoA-I<sub>M </sub>knock-in mice. These results provided by Shah and Rubin's groups provide cardinal differences in the comparison of wtApoA-I or ApoA-I<sub>M</sub>, which might be due to the selection of animal models.</p><p>Nevertheless, both studies lack resemblance to the clinical setting in which patients with normal ApoA-I levels are treated with a systemically delivered ApoA-I or ApoA-I<sub>M </sub>mimetic compound. In our current report, we demonstrate that AAV8-mediated gene transfer with hepatic expression of wtApoA-I or ApoA-I<sub>M </sub>results in plasma levels of ApoA-I that are sufficient to significantly slow the development of atherosclerosis in mice. Interestingly we find that both forms, wtApoA-I and ApoA-I<sub>M</sub>, to be similar effective in their ability to retard atherosclerosis development in LDLr knockout mice.</p><p>Atheroprotection did occur despite a reduction in serum HDL levels in both treatment groups. This mimics the human situation, in which ApoA-I Milano carriers have reduced levels of HDL cholesterol, which paradoxically is associated with atheroprotection.</p><p>The exact mechanism for the ApoA-I Milano induced decrease in HDL levels is not completely elucidated yet and the fact, that so far only heterozygotes for the mutation have been identified, who are producing wild-type and mutated ApoA-I, is making the answer more difficult. One of the hypotheses is that HDL-bound ApoA-I Milano leads to a faster catabolism of the HDL particles. This increase in cholesterol efflux from HDL-ApoA-I Milano particles was proven in ApoA-I Milano transgenic mice, which also display a decrease in HDL levels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>].</p><p>The lipid data obtained in our animal model are therefore highly consistent with the human phenotype and the results from the transgenic animals. In our model HDL levels did also slightly decrease in those animals treated with wtApoA-I, even though to a lesser extent than in those treated with ApoA-I Milano. Hepatic mRNA levels of murine ApoA-I did not differ between control and wtApoA-I or ApoA-I Milano treated animals in our study, therefore a down-regulation of the endogenous gene due to the AAV gene transfer is unlikely.</p><p>It is clear that the plasma HDL concentration itself is neither a surrogate for its functionality nor the kinetics of reverse cholesterol transport [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. Since the main determinant of HDL levels is its clearance and the metabolism of the mature HDL particle is highly dependent on its composition, it is imaginable that also the wtApoA-I gene transfer did led to the production of HDL particles with a more favorable metabolism.</p><p>Another assumption is, that essentially replacing murine apoA-I with human apoA-I in these studies resulted in a more functional HDL that inhibited atherosclerosis, and that wild-type and Milano did not differ in this effect. Indeed, there is substantial interest in the structural differences between human and murine apoA-I and it is plausible that they would differ in their anti-atherogenic effects. Further experiments have to be performed to further elucidate this phenomenon.</p><p>In conclusion, these results support the concept of using second generation AAV8-based vectors to achieve hepatic gene transfer and expression of transgenes that encode abundant plasma proteins (such as ApoA-I) for studies in animals. They also suggest that systemic wtApoA-I overexpression is as effective as ApoA-I<sub>M </sub>overexpression in reducing atherosclerosis progression in susceptible mice. Finally, they suggest that AAV8-mediated gene transfer of either wtApoA-I or ApoA-I<sub>M </sub>could be considered as an experimental clinical approach for the treatment of atherosclerosis.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>This study was supported by P01 HL59407 and P01 HL22633 from the National Heart Lung and Blood Institute.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>JS analyzed the tissues via RealTime PCR for gene expression, JMW and DJR participated in the study design and coordination and helped to critically review and draft the manuscript.
