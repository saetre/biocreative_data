Members of this family regulate a broad range of physiological processes, including organogenesis, proliferation, differentiation, adhesion, motility and apoptosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Mutations in downstream components of the TGF-&#x003b2; signaling pathways have been implicated in several human diseases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>].</p><p>TGF-&#x003b2; superfamily members signal through a receptor complex formed by the association of two transmembrane proteins designated I and II, each possessing serine/threonine kinase activity (for reviews see [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]). TGF-&#x003b2; binding induces the assembly of the type I and type II receptors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>], thereby enabling the type II receptor to phosphorylate and activate the type I receptor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. Activated type I receptors then phosphorylate Smad2 and Smad3 receptor-regulated Smad proteins (R-Smads) at the carboxy terminal motif SSxS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. Phosphorylated R-Smads interact with Smad 4, the unique Co-Smad [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. This complex accumulates in the nucleus where it regulates transcriptional activity of several genes in association with transcriptional activators and corepressors (for reviews see [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]).</p><p>The specific transcriptional outcome in response to TGF-&#x003b2; is achieved by the interplay of intracellular regulators at different levels. Within the Smad family of proteins, Smad6 and 7 (I-Smads) negatively regulate TGF-&#x003b2; signaling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. Smad6 also inhibits BMP signaling, while activin signaling is negatively regulated by Smad7 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. In addition to the Smad proteins, other regulatory molecules work as adapter and/or scaffolding proteins, such as SARA, that mediates the access of Smads to activated receptors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. Finally, the specific outcome of TGF-&#x003b2; signaling is modulated by several other signaling pathways (for review see [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]).</p><p>The human unidentified gene-encoded large proteins database (HUGE) contains long cDNAs and is a valuable tool to discover new proteins, and to predict structural features with a possible functional relevance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. Through the analysis of the cDNA clones contained in this database, we have identified a novel protein that is highly similar to AMSH (<underline>a</underline>ssociated <underline>m</underline>olecule with the <underline>SH</underline>3 domain of STAM) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>].

We have used the HUGE database as a primary public resource as it contains mostly uncharacterized full-length cDNAs. By analyzing the domain composition of the predicted proteins, we identified a cDNA [Genbank <ext-link ext-link-type="gen" xlink:href="AB037794">AB037794</ext-link>] with an open reading frame of 461 amino acids (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>). The domain composition of the predicted protein was obtained by searching the SMART database [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>] and revealed a coiled-coil domain spanning amino acids 149 to 176 in the N-terminus of the molecule and a JAB domain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>] (amino acids 268 to 394) located in the carboxy terminal region of the molecule (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>). A search of GenBank database revealed a similar molecule, AMSH, which had been identified on the basis of its ability to interact with STAM and showed a similar domain composition. Alignment of the novel protein against human AMSH revealed a 75% identity within the JAB domain, with an overall identity of 56% between the two molecules (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>). We have designated this novel protein AMSH-2 after its paralog AMSH. Upon searching the human genomic database, we found that AMSH-2 gene was located on 10q23.33. A detailed analysis of the genomic structure of the gene encoding for AMSH-2 revealed that the coding region spans 10 exons (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C</xref>). All the intron-exon boundaries followed the GT/AG rule for splice junctions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>].</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Sequence, domain architecture and genomic structure analysis of a novel protein AMSH-2. </bold>A) Alignment of AMSH family of proteins.

We found a single band of approximately 2.3 kb which was detected in almost all the tissues examined (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>, left panel). Probing a cancer cell line northern blot revealed a band of similar size in most of the cell lines, including HL60, Hela S3, Molt-4, Raji, SW480 and A549 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>, right panel).</p><fig position="float" id="F2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p>A) Northern blot analysis of AMSH-2 in different human tissues and cell lines.

The lower panels show &#x003b2;-actin reprobing of the membranes. The sizes of the transcripts are indicated in kb on the left. B) Expression of AMSH-2 protein. Cell lysates from metabolically labeled 293T and HepG2 cells were immunoprecipitated with preimmune (PI) and AMSH-2 antiserum (I). A specific band for AMSH-2 can be observed in the lanes immunoprecipitated with AMSH-2 antiserum (indicated by an arrow). C) Expression of AMSH-2 Myc construct. 293T cells were transfected with the indicated constructs and metabolically labeled with S<sup>35</sup>. Cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with 9E10 monoclonal antibody and after SDS-polyacrylamide gel separation and blotting, the membrane was exposed.

We found ESTs corresponding to AMSH-2 mRNA in brain, testes, bone, pancreas, fetal liver, kidney, colon, stomach, bone marrow, placenta, breast, pectoral muscle, hypothalamus, ovary as well as in a number of cell lines of different origins, including T cell leukemia, NT2 neuronal and B-cell CLL [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. These data indicate that, like AMSH [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>], AMSH-2 mRNA is widely expressed.</p><p>We raised an antibody against the carboxy terminus of AMSH-2 and measured the expression of AMSH-2 protein in different cell lines. For this purpose, HepG2 and 293T cells lines were metabolically labeled with <sup>35</sup>S and cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with preimmune or anti-AMSH-2 antiserum. We observed a band with a molecular weight of approximately 56 kDa, which is in agreement with the predicted molecular weight of AMSH-2. This band was specific for AMSH-2 as it was absent in the samples immunoprecipitated with pre-immune serum (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>AMSH-2 enhances gene expression of TGF-&#x003b2;-dependent promoters</title><p>In order to study the functional role of AMSH-2, we constructed several epitope-tagged versions of AMSH-2. The entire open reading frame of AMSH-2 was subcloned by PCR into pEF mammalian expression vectors that provide a Myc or V5 epitopes at the C-terminus. Ectopic expression of AMSH-2/Myc was undertaken and confirmed by metabolic labeling of 293T cells, followed by immunoprecipitation with anti-Myc antibodies (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2C</xref>).</p><p>We next examined the effect of overexpression of AMSH-2 on a number of signaling pathways. Since AMSH-2 is expressed in HepG2 and 293T cells, we chose these cell lines for our assays. Given the similarity between AMSH-2 and AMSH, and the ability to AMSH to regulate BMP signaling, we hypothesized that AMSH-2 may affect signaling by TGF-&#x003b2;. We first tested the effect of AMSH-2 overexpression on TGF-&#x003b2; signaling pathway using p3TP-lux reporter plasmid which is a standard reporter to evaluate TGF-&#x003b2; signaling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. This reporter construct contains the luciferase gene under the control three consecutive TPA response elements and a 96 bp fragment of the PAI-1 promoter that is regulated by TGF-&#x003b2; and is also highly inducible in response to TGF-&#x003b2;. Overexpression of AMSH-2 in HepG2 cells increased the level of luciferase activity driven by the 3TP promoter upon TGF-&#x003b2; stimulation as compared to cells transfected with vector alone (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>). As this promoter is derived from the Plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) promoter, we also tested the effect on PAI-1 luciferase activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. When we cotransfected AMSH-2 into HepG2 cells together with this reporter, a similar increase in the luciferase levels was observed indicating that AMSH-2 is likely a positive regulator of TGF-&#x003b2; signaling (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="F3"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p>A) Effect of AMSH-2 on TGF-&#x003b2; induced transcriptional activity of 3TP driven luciferase. HepG2 cells were cotransfected with 3TP-lux reporter together with the empty vector or increasing amounts of AMSH-2 Myc construct. Twenty-four hours posttransfection, cells were serum-starved and left untreated (white bars) or stimulated (black bars) with 5 ng/ml TGF-&#x003b2;1 for 16&#x02013;20 h before the luciferase and &#x003b2;-galactosidase activities were measured. B) Effect of AMSH-2 on TGF-&#x003b2; induced transcriptional activity of PAI-1 luciferase. HepG2 cells were cotransfected with PAI-1 reporter together with the empty vector or 0.9 &#x003bc;g/ml of AMSH-2 Myc construct. A similar procedure as described in A was followed. C) AMSH-2 does not stimulate NF-kB signaling pathway. 293 cells were cotransfected with ELAM luciferase reporter construct together with an empty vector, 0.9 &#x003bc;g/ml of AMSH-2 Myc construct or 0.9 &#x003bc;g/ml of TRAF-2, used as a positive control. Forty-eight hours posttransfection, luciferase and &#x003b2;-galactosidase activities were measured.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1471-2121-5-2-3"/></fig><p>To account for possible non-specific effects, we tested the effect of AMSH-2 overexpression on the TNF signaling pathway. We used an ELAM-luciferase reporter construct as a reporter for activation of this pathway. This reporter contains the ELAM-1 promoter (-730 to +52) and is well known to be induced by TNF stimulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]. We therefore cotransfected 293 cells with ELAM-luciferase and either AMSH-2, empty vector or TRAF2, a prototypical member of the TRAF family of adapter proteins known to potentiate TNF signaling pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>]. We did not observe any increase in the luciferase levels in AMSH-2 transfected cells as compared with the empty vector, although overexpression of TRAF2 led to a significant upregulation of the promoter (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3C</xref>). Taken together, these results imply that the AMSH-2 regulates TGF-&#x003b2; signaling pathway.</p></sec><sec><title>AMSH-2 negates the inhibitory effect of Smad7 on TGF-&#x003b2; signaling</title><p>The ability of AMSH-2 to regulate TGF-&#x003b2; signaling could be explained by several mechanisms, including interaction with Smad2, Smad3, Smad4, or Smad7 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>]. To determine whether AMSH-2 interacts with these Smads, we coexpressed AMSH-2 with epitope tagged Smad constructs in 293T cells. As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A</xref>, we observed an association between AMSH-2 and Smad7 but not with Smads 3 or 4 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A</xref>). We also observed association between Smad2 and AMSH-2. These findings are similar to that observed for AMSH, since this molecule interacts strongly with Smad6 and 7; but differ in that AMSH does not with any R-Smads [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>].</p><fig position="float" id="F4"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><p>A) AMSH-2 interacts with Smad2 and Smad7, but not with Smad3 or Smad4. Vector or AMSH-2 V5 construct were coexpressed in 293T cells together with the Smad proteins as indicated on the top of the figure. Lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-V5 antibody and western blotted with anti-Flag or anti-HA antibodies. To control for Smad and AMSH-2 protein expression part of the lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-Flag, anti-HA or anti-V5 antibodies and western blotted with the same antibodies. B) Smad7 inhibitory effect on TGF-&#x003b2; signaling pathway is rescued by AMSH-2. HepG2 cells were cotransfected with 3TP-lux reporter together with the empty vector or 10 ng/ml of Smad7 with or without 0.3 &#x003bc;g/ml of AMSH-2 Myc construct. Twenty-four hours posttransfection, cells were serum-starved and left untreated (white bars) or stimulated (black bars) with 5 ng/ml TGF-&#x003b2;1 for 16&#x02013;20 h before luciferase and &#x003b2;-galactosidase activities were measured.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1471-2121-5-2-4"/></fig><p>Because AMSH-2 interacts with Smad7, we also analyzed the effect of AMSH-2 on the ability of Smad7 to inhibit TGF-&#x003b2; signaling in HepG2 cells. As expected, overexpression of Smad7 attenuated the induction of p3TP-luciferase activity by TGF-&#x003b2; (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B</xref>). Interestingly, overexpression of AMSH-2 negated the inhibitory effect of Smad7 on p3TP expression stimulated by TGF-&#x003b2; (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B</xref>). Therefore AMSH-2 can rescue the inhibitory effects of Smad7 on TGF-&#x003b2; signaling pathway. Given the sequence similarity between AMSH and AMSH-2, it is indeed possible that AMSH-2 also interacts with Smad6. Smad6 has been shown to inhibit the TGF-&#x003b2; pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>] and AMSH is able to rescue the inhibitory effect of Smad6 on BMP signaling pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>]. If AMSH-2 is able to interact with Smad6, the effect of AMSH-2 on TGF-&#x003b2; signaling pathway could be explained by its interaction with both Smad7 and Smad6.</p></sec><sec><title>AMSH-2 is a positive regulator of TGF-&#x003b2;-dependent transcriptional activation</title><p>The use of small interfering RNAs (siRNA) has been proven a powerful tool to suppress the expression of specific proteins in mammalian cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>]. We have shown that overexpression of AMSH-2 positively regulates TGF-&#x003b2;-dependent transcriptional activation of 3TP-lux reporter. To assess the effect of depletion of endogenous AMSH-2, we designed a specific siRNA to silence AMSH-2. This siRNA was cotransfected in HepG2 cells and the effect on the transcriptional activity of the 3TP driven luciferase reporter was analyzed. As a positive control we used an siRNA targeted against Smad7. Cotransfection of siRNA specific for AMSH-2 cause a decrease in the luciferase activity upon stimulation with TGF-&#x003b2; when compared with cells cotransfected with a commercially available randomly ordered RNA scrambled RNA. As expected, we observed an increase in luciferase activity in the cells transfected with a siRNA specific for Smad7 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>).

This effect might be mediated through the interaction with the inhibitory Smad7 as AMSH-2 is capable of negating the inhibitory effects of Smad7 in TGF-&#x003b2; signaling pathway. Further, use of siRNA to knock down the expression of AMSH-2 reduces signaling by TGF-&#x003b2;. Similar to our studies, it has been suggested that AMSH might be involved in TGF-&#x003b2; signaling. AMSH can interact with both I-Smads (<italic>i. e</italic>. Smads 6 and 7) and is a positive regulator of BMP signaling pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>]. The high degree of homology between these paralogs suggests that AMSH-2 might also interact with Smad6, and therefore might regulate BMP signaling. Although further research needs to be conducted to elucidate the exact mechanism of action of AMSH-2, it is clear that AMSH and AMSH-2 belong to a new family of molecules that positively regulate TGF-&#x003b2; signaling pathway.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>cDNAs and constructs</title><p>A human cDNA clone [Genbank <ext-link ext-link-type="gen" xlink:href="AB037794">AB037794</ext-link>] was used as described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. To generate wild type AMSH-2 expression vector with a carboxy-terminal Myc epitope, we subcloned AMSH-2 open reading frame into the Nco I and Xho I sites of pEF/myc/cyto (Invitrogen, Carsbad, CA) by standard PCR procedures using the primers: AAAACCATGGATCAGCCTTTTACTGTGAATTC (5' primer) and AAACTCGAGCTGTTCAGATGGTGATGATGAC (3' primer). To generate AMSH-2 V5 carboxy-terminal-tagged expression vector, the open reading frame of AMSH-2 was subcloned into Nco I and Xho I sites of pEntr4 (Invitrogen) using the same 5' primer as described above and AAACTCGAGAGCTGTTCAGATGGTGATGATGACCTAG (3' primer), and transferred to pEF1/V5-HisB (Invitrogen), which has been previously made gateway compatible by inserting a cassette in the EcoRV site.</p><p>3TP-lux, PAI-1-luc, pELAMP-luc+, TRAF2, Flag-tagged Smad7, Smad3, have been previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>] while Flag-tagged Smad2 and HA-tagged Smad4 were generously provided by Joan Massague.</p></sec><sec><title>Northern blot analysis</title><p>Human tissue northern blot II and cancer cell line blot were obtained from CLONTECH (Palo Alto, CA). We isolated and radiolabeled an AMSH-2 cDNA (nucleotides 1088&#x02013;2010) produced by digestion of AMSH-2 cDNA clone with HindIII and SphI. Hybridization signals were detected on a BAS-2000 bioimaging analyzer (Fuji film, Tokyo, Japan). After exposure, the blots were stripped and reprobed with beta-actin to control for equal amounts of PolyA+ RNA loading.</p></sec><sec><title>Cell culture and antibodies</title><p>293 and 293T cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mM L-glutamine and penicillin/streptomycin. HepG2 cells were grown in MEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, non essential amino-acids, sodium pyruvate and penicillin/streptomycin.</p><p>The peptide corresponding to the C-terminus of human AMSH-2 was synthesized by Boston Biomolecules, Inc (Woburn, MA). The specific AMSH-2 rabbit polyclonal antibody (anti-AMSH-2) was raised at Covance Research Products Inc. (Denver, PA). The following antibodies were obtained: (i) c-Myc mAb 9E10 (Covance Research Products Inc);(ii) anti-V5 and anti-V5 HRP antibodies (Invitrogen); (iii) anti-Flag HRP (UPSTATE, Lake Placid, NY);and (v) anti-HA 12CA5, anti-HA HRP (Roche Diagnostics Corp, Indianapolis, IN).</p></sec><sec><title>Metabolic labeling and immunoprecipitation</title><p>To test endogenous expression of AMSH-2, 293T and HepG2 cells were metabolically labeled with <sup>35</sup>S methionine and <sup>35</sup>S cysteine and lysed in modified RIPA buffer (150 mM NaCl, 50 mM Tris, pH 7.5, 1 mM EDTA, 1% NP-40, 0.25% sodium deoxycholate) with 1 mM sodium orthovanadate and protease inhibitors. Samples were incubated either with pre-immune serum or AMSH-2 antiserum. Immunoprecipitated proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE. To test expression of the Myc-tagged AMSH-2 construct, cells were transfected with 15 &#x003bc;g of DNA using the standard calcium phosphate method. Twenty-four h postransfection, the cells were metabolically labeled for 16 h. and subsequently lysed and immunoprecipitated with anti-Myc antibody as above.</p></sec><sec><title>Luciferase assays</title><p>HepG2 cells were transfected with 0.5 &#x003bc;g of the corresponding luciferase reporter, 50 ng of &#x003b2;-galactosidase reporter and 4.5 &#x003bc;g of DNA. Twenty-four h postransfection, the cells were depleted from serum and stimulated for 16&#x02013;20 h with 5 ng/ml of purified recombinant human TGF-&#x003b2;1 (R&#x00026;Dsystems. Inc. Minneapolis, MN). Luciferase and &#x003b2;-galatosidase activities were measured according to manufacturer's instructions (Tropix, Bedford, MA). Measurements were corrected by &#x003b2;-galactosidase activity. The experiments were repeated at least three times.</p></sec><sec><title>Coimmunoprecipitation experiments</title><p>293T cells were cotransfected with 13 &#x003bc;g of AMSH-2 V5 construct and 2 &#x003bc;g of the corresponding Smad constructs. After 48 h, the cells were lysed in lysis buffer (150 mM NaCl, 50 mM Tris, pH 7.5, 1 mM EDTA, 1% NP-40) with 1 mM sodium orthovanadate and protease inhibitors. Lysates were incubated with anti-V5 antibody, and the resulting immunocomplexes were separated in SDS-PAGE. Blots were probed with the indicated HRP conjugated antibody.</p></sec><sec><title>siRNA experiments</title><p>To target AMSH-2 and Smad 7, we designed 21 nt siRNA duplexes: AACAATTCCTTGCTGAATGTA and AACCGCAGCAGTTACCCCATC, according to [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>]. All siRNA duplexes including lamin A/C siRNA duplexes and scrambled siRNA were obtained from Dharmacon Research. Inc. (Lafayette, Colorado).</p><p>HepG2 cells grown in 6 well plates were transfected with 250 ng of 3TP-lux reporter, 50 ng of &#x003b2;-galactosidase reporter and 0.12 nmol of the corresponding siRNA duplex. After 48 h of transfection cells were depleted from serum and treated with 5 ng/ml TGF-&#x003b2;1. Luciferase and &#x003b2;-galactosidase activities were measured after 17 h stimulation.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><sec><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>We thank Harvey Lodish for support and encouragement.
