We present a novel, rapid, and inexpensive method for obtaining high-resolution virtual histology for phenotypic assessment of mouse embryos. Using osmium tetroxide to differentially stain tissues followed by volumetric X-ray computed tomography to image whole embryos, isometric resolutions of 27 &#x003bc;m or 8 &#x003bc;m were achieved with scan times of 2 h or 12 h, respectively, using mid-gestation E9.5&#x02013;E12.5 embryos. The datasets generated by this method are immediately amenable to state-of-the-art computational methods of organ patterning analysis. This technique to assess embryo anatomy represents a significant improvement in resolution, time, and expense for the quantitative, three-dimensional analysis of developmental patterning defects attributed to genetically engineered mutations and chemically induced embryotoxicity.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="synopsis"><title>Synopsis</title><p>Developmental biology is entering the digital age, thanks to advancements in imaging technologies, instrumentation, and software. These advancements are converging with discoveries in developmental biology to deliver unprecedented insight into how human development is impacted by the products we use, the environment we live in, and our genetic composition. Industrial societies are becoming increasingly concerned with the exposure of women and their unborn fetuses to pharmaceuticals and commonplace household chemicals. In addition, understanding genetic causes of birth defects is now possible through the isolation of specific genes, which can be efficiently disrupted in embryos, and subsequently observed for birth defects. Such studies of embryotoxicity typically involve the use of mouse embryos. However, evaluation of mouse embryos in the past has involved expensive and cumbersome external inspection and thin sectioning for view under the microscope. As such, developmental biologists have eagerly anticipated the advent of tools that would allow them to routinely assess the complex and dynamic organization of embryos using techniques that are fast and inexpensive. In this article, the authors introduce a rapid, high-quality, and inexpensive technique for the three-dimensional visualization of mouse embryos using X-ray computed tomography that is ideally suited for researchers in pharmaceutical, industrial, and academic laboratories.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="7"/></counts><custom-meta-wrap><custom-meta><meta-name>Citation:</meta-name><meta-value>Johnson JT, Hansen MS, Wu I, Healy LJ, Johnson CR, et al.

A full understanding of mammalian development by this means, using the gene-targeting approach for every one of the approximately 25,000 or more mouse genes, may seem like a daunting task. Nevertheless, more than 10&#x00025; of known mouse genes have already been disrupted by gene targeting.

The challenge laid before developmental biologists will be to systemically analyze morphological phenotypes and, where possible, determine the quantitative contribution of each gene towards patterning of the embryo. Tools for this type of &#x0201c;phenomic&#x0201d; analysis must include rapid, inexpensive, and accessible high-throughput methods of high-resolution anatomical imaging (addressed here) as well as stage-specific, statistically-averaged wild-type morphological atlases that can be used to discern normal variation from mutant phenotype &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020061-b003">3</xref>&#x0005d;.</p><p>The introduction of magnetic resonance microscopy (MRM) represented an important time savings over classical histology in the screening of E6.5&#x02013;E19 mouse embryos for mutant morphological phenotypes &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020061-b004">4</xref>&#x0005d; (reviewed by Schneider and Bhattacharya &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020061-b005">5</xref>&#x0005d; and Tyszka et al. &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020061-b006">6</xref>&#x0005d;).

This new method, which employs osmium tetroxide to differentially stain tissues, will facilitate the quantitative, three-dimensional analysis of mouse developmental defects for researchers at a broad range of institutions at relatively little expense&#x02014;and at resolutions and throughput comparable to or exceeding magnetic resonance methods.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Virtual Histology by Computed Tomography Is a Powerful Method for Imaging Embryo Anatomy</title><p>Formalin-fixed wild-type E11.5 embryos whose cell membranes were stained in a 1&#x00025; solution of osmium tetroxide were imaged by volumetric computed tomography (CT) at 8-&#x003bc;m isometric resolution.

In preliminary experiments on a newly available commercially scanner, we have achieved isometric spatial resolutions as high as 6 &#x003bc;m in pilot studies. Our other preliminary experiments suggest that a combination of osmium and cis-platinum (or ethidium bromide) may allow for differential staining of cell membranes and nuclei, respectively, so that the staining characteristics of organs and tissues can be further differentiated (unpublished data). Furthermore, our preliminary experience and studies by Bentley (see &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020061-b015">15</xref>&#x0005d;) demonstrate that osmium-stained tissue, with or without counterstains, can be later sectioned for true histological staining.

Magnetic resonance imaging of postnatal mouse brains (as well as human brains) has led to significant advances in semi- or fully automated deformable shape mapping whereby specimens of different sizes can be compared for the eventual detection of statistically different features of morphology &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020061-b017">17</xref>&#x0005d;.

The 600 MB three-dimensional dataset and the raw data for the scan were transferred to a single DVD (approximate total, 4.5 GB). Preliminary visualizations (unpublished data) and virtual histology sections were generated in real time with the freely-available MicroView program (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://microview.sf.net">http://microview.sf.net</ext-link>).</p></sec><sec id="s4c"><title>Isosurface generation.</title><p>Isosurfaces renderings of the CT datasets were generated using a combination of the open-source Teem utilities &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020061-b020">20</xref>&#x0005d; and the open-source, platform-independent BioImage &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020061-b021">21</xref>&#x0005d; rendering program.

The final sub-sampled volumes were 255 &#x000d7; 255 &#x000d7; 255 mm and equally spaced using a nearest neighbor approach. Pre-computing of the gradient and Hessian data was also performed using the Teem libraries. The combined process of sub-sampling and generation of gradient and Hessian data produced two data volumes, which were stored together with the original CT values in a &#x0201c;VGH&#x0201d; (value, gradient, Hessian) volume. The VGH volumes were subsequently used to create isosurfaces in real time with the BioImage software package.</p></sec><sec id="s4d"><title>Segmentation.</title><p>Image volume segmentations were done using a Watershed algorithm &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020061-b022">22</xref>&#x0005d; provided in the National Library of Medicine Insight Segmentation and Registration Toolkit (ITK; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.itk.org">http://www.itk.org</ext-link>). Watershed segmentation is a region-growing algorithm in which user-defined seed points are positioned in areas of interest, and a statistical analysis is made of the gradient magnitude in the local neighborhood to find the standard deviation. The structure is then found as the perimeters of the seed points extend through the continuous surrounding area, without crossing points where the gradient magnitude is beyond one standard deviation of the mean. The resulting structures are saved to disk as separate volumes. Segmentations were done on a computer equipped with 2.5 GHz Intel Pentium III processor and 2 GB of RAM. The resulting volumes were then combined into one volume by marking each segmentation as a unique value, and then merging it into the original again, such that the original value of existing segmentation is overwriten with the new marked value.</p></sec><sec id="s4e"><title>Volume renderings.</title><p>The volume renderings of wild-type and <italic>Pax3:Fkhr</italic> mutant embryo datasets were created using direct volume rendering techniques using the in-house software package, Nenners &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020061-b023">23</xref>&#x0005d;. Nenners reads a volume and casts <italic>n</italic><sup>2</sup> geometric rays through the volume per pixel.

Color and opacity were defined at each sample point using a two-dimensional transfer function, with gradient magnitude and X-ray density defining the domain &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020061-b026">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020061-b027">27</xref>&#x0005d;. This was done in a front-to-back fashion, such that when the opacity of a ray becomes equal to or greater than 1, the ray is terminated early and the next ray is computed. Bounding volumes were also used to speed this process such that rays that have not yet or will not hit the volume were not sampled. The gradient was also used to approximate the Phong shading models used &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020061-b028">28</xref>&#x0005d;. For <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020061-g003">Figure 3</xref>, a curvature-based transfer function &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020061-b028">28</xref>&#x0005d; and depth queuing was also applied to the volume renderings. The transfer function is based on the dot product of the angle of an incident ray with the surface normal. If the dot product was less than some constant k, 0 &#x0003c; k &#x0003c; 1, then the surface was marked black to emphasis surfaces perpendicular to the viewing direction. Furthermore, a depth queue to shade interpolated samples was used to give a greater feeling of depth and to seperate foreground from background. Parameters of camera position, viewing direction, and lighting relative to the specimen were also passed to define the view of the rendering. The software was run on an SGI Onyx 3800 (Silicon Graphics, Mountain View, California, United States) at 80 s per rendering.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pgen-0020061-sv001"><label>Video S1</label><caption><title>Sagittal Sections of a Wild-Type E12.5 Embryo at 8-&#x003bc;m Resolution</title><p>(1.2 MB WMV)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pgen.0020061.sv001.wmv" mimetype="video" mime-subtype="x-ms-wmv"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pgen-0020061-sv002"><label>Video S2</label><caption><title>Coronal Sections of a Wild-Type E12.5 Embryo at 8-&#x003bc;m Resolution</title><p>(1.3 MB WMV)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pgen.0020061.sv002.wmv" mimetype="video" mime-subtype="x-ms-wmv"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pgen-0020061-sv003"><label>Video S3</label><caption><title>Axial Sections of a Wild-Type E12.5 Embryo at 8-&#x003bc;m Resolution</title><p>(1.7 MB WMV)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pgen.0020061.sv003.wmv" mimetype="video" mime-subtype="x-ms-wmv"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pgen-0020061-sv004"><label>Video S4</label><caption><title>Rendering of a Segmented <italic>Pax3:Fkhr</italic> Mutant E11.5 Embryo</title><p>This embryo corresponds to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020061-g004">Figure 4</xref>F&#x02013;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020061-g004">4</xref>J.</p><p>(3.6 MB MOV)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pgen.0020061.sv004.mov" mimetype="video" mime-subtype="quicktime"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pgen-0020061-sv005"><label>Video S5</label><caption><title>Rendering of a Segmented Wild-Type E11.5 Embryo</title><p>This embryo corresponds to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020061-g004">Figure 4</xref>A&#x02013;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020061-g004">4</xref>E.</p><p>(3.6 MB MOV)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pgen.0020061.sv005.mov" mimetype="video" mime-subtype="quicktime"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><sec id="s5a"><title>Accession Numbers</title><p>The National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov</ext-link>) accession number for the <italic>Pax3:Fkhr</italic> fusion oncogene is AY743239, and for <italic>Pax7</italic> is NM&#x0005f;011039.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><p>The Pax7 antibody developed by Atsushi Kawakami was obtained from Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank (University of Iowa).
