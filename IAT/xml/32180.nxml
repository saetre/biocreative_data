Colorectal cancer is sometimes inherited in familial syndromes like Familial Adenomatous Polyposis (FAP) or Hereditary Nonpolyposis Colorectal Cancer (HNPCC) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. The identification of the predisposing genes in inherited tumors have meant great contribution to our understanding of colorectal carcinogenesis in these families but also of carcinogenesis in general [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. The majority of colorectal tumors, however, are sporadic, and studies in sporadic tumors have revealed other genes of importance in colorectal tumor development, e.g. K-Ras [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>], TGF&#x003b2; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>], E-cadherin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>], SRC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>] and the PPAR&#x003b3; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Genes may be altered in tumors compared to normal tissue without necessarily being causative. Tumor cells often de-differentiate or have their origin in immature cell types and loose expression of proteins associated with highly differentiated cells, and could in stead gain expression of embryonic proteins. These alterations can potentially be used as clinical markers to define a particular disease entity, useful for diagnosis, staging, population screening or even to detect the presence of occult metastatic disease, recurrent disease and response to treatment. The perhaps most known embryonic protein used as a tumor marker in malignancy is the CEA in colorectal cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. In an attempt to identify additional genes altered during the development of colorectal cancer, we compared the gene expression pattern between normal colon epithelium samples and colorectal tumors using the mRNA differential display PCR (mRNA DD-PCR) method. In this paper we report that the water channel protein <italic>AQP8</italic> is expressed in the normal columnar epithelial cells of the colonic mucosa facing lumen and that adenomas and colorectal cancer do not seem to express this protein.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>One gene fragment of approximately 80 bp was expressed in the 4 normal tissue samples but not, or to a much lesser degree, in 24 colorectal tumors in the mRNA DD-PCR experiment. The band was cut and reamplified using the same primers, and cloned. Clones were then selected by size, and by using inverse northern hybridization it was found that all clones represented the same DNA sequence. Sequencing and subsequent search in the genome database showed that this differentially expressed gene fragment corresponded to the sequence of aquaporin 8 (AQP8).</p><p>The result was confirmed with RT-PCR on newly synthesized cDNA and northern blot hybridization (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>) on the original samples from the mRNA DD-PCR experiment. The number of samples used for northern blot was small depending on limited amounts of RNA from the samples. We extended the experiment and included besides the 28 samples used in the mRNA DD-PCR, another 7 sporadic colorectal cancers, 3 samples from normal colonic mucosa, 5 sporadic colonic adenomas and 3 HNPCC tumors from patients with known germline mutations in hMLH1. Using a semiquantitative RT-PCR it was found that samples from adenomas, rectal cancers, and colonic cancers, including those from HNPCC patients, expressed the <italic>AQP8</italic> to various degrees, but generally to a much lesser extent than normal colonic tissue (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). The expression of <italic>AQP8</italic> in some tumors could be explained by a normal cell contamination in those samples.</p><p>To study what cells expressed the <italic>AQP8</italic> mRNA, in situ hybridization was used. In samples from 2 normal colonic mucosa there was a staining of mRNA <italic>AQP8</italic> expression in the columnar surface epithelium only (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3a</xref>). No expression of <italic>AQP8</italic> was detected in any of one sporadic rectal carcinoma, one sporadic colon carcinoma or one HNPCC carcinoma tested (the HNPCC carcinoma is shown)(Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3c</xref>). The RNA in situ experiment suggested that only normal mucosa expressed AQP8.</p><p>In total 15 colon cancer cell lines, six microsatellite unstable (SW48, LOVO, HT116, RKO, LS174T, DDL1) and 9 microsatellite stable (SW480, SW620, HT29, CACO2, Crl7184, Crl7456, Crl2405, 238CCL, 233CCL), were tested for expression of <italic>AQP8</italic> using RT-PCR. None of them demonstrated expression of the <italic>AQP8</italic> transcript, supporting the hypothesis that tumor cells do not express <italic>AQP8</italic> (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>This study was designed to detect additional genes altered during colorectal carcinogenesis. One of the genes found, <italic>AQP8</italic>, was expressed in all normal colon samples but not, or to a less extent, in the colorectal tumors. The expression of <italic>AQP8</italic> in tumor samples in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref> can be explained in two ways. It is possible that adenomas and cancer cells do not express <italic>AQP8</italic> in these samples and that the PCR products results from normal cell contamination. Alternatively it is possible that adenomas can develop in a cell already differentiated to express <italic>AQP8</italic>. The known function of this gene and the in situ hybridization result from this study suggest this protein to be a marker of fully differentiated epithelial cells. In the maturation process of cells from the colonic crypt, the stem cells differentiate to become either goblet cell in the crypt or surface epithelial cell [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. This experiment suggests that the expression of <italic>AQP8</italic> is limited to the differentiated mature columnar epithelial cells. None of the cell types in the crypt, including the stem cells seemed to express <italic>AQP8</italic> in our in situ experiment. Tumors did not express <italic>AQP8</italic>. The reason for this can be that this gene has been downregulated in tumorigenes. Another, perhaps more likely, explanation could be that tumors arise in immature cells. There are other proteins whose expression is of late appearance in the life cycle of a colonic crypt cell, like the epthelial Na+ conductance channel ENaC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>] and maxi K+ channels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>], which could have been picked up by this experiment similar to <italic>AQP8</italic>. The reason why they were not picked could be related to the fact that using a limited number of primers not all differentially expressed genes will show up. Furthermore, since these genes are mostly expressed in distal colon cells, and not in proximal colon cells they would not have been identified by us as differentially expressed between normal and tumor tissue and therefore not selected for further studies.</p><p>Aquaporins (AQP) are members of the major intrinsic super family of integral membrane proteins, which act as specialized channels to facilitate the passage of water through the cell membrane in animals, plants, and bacteria. So far 10 AQP homologues named from 0 to 9 have been cloned in mammals. They are widely distributed and more than one AQP could be present in the same cell [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. Several human <italic>AQP</italic> genes have been cloned and an increasing number of disturbances have been found associated to the abnormal function of these proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. The human <italic>AQP8</italic> gene was cloned in 1998 and was shown to be important for cell fluid transport [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. Expression of the gene was demonstrated by northern blot in human pancreatic and colonic tissue [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>].</p><p>It is generally accepted that water transport in the gastro intestinal tract is secondary to osmotic driving forces created by active salt transport to hydrostatic pressure differences and absorption takes place despite high effective osmolarity of the faeces. Several studies have suggested the colonic crypts to be the major sites of both fluid absorption and agonist-stimulated fluid secretion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Recently <italic>AQP8</italic> was demonstrated to be expressed in the absorptive columnar cells of the jejunum and colon in rat by in situ hybridization and it was suggested that AQP8 had a role in water intake and/or outlet in the gastrointestinal tract [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. In mice the <italic>AQP3, AQP4</italic> and <italic>AQP8</italic> are expressed in the colon surface epithelium, suggesting a combined role of these aquaporins in fluid transport [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Our finding of <italic>AQP8</italic> expression in human columnar surface epithelial cells, suggests these cells to be involved in water resorption in human colon. Since mRNA-in situ hybridization showed a positive signal for mRNA expression of <italic>AQP8</italic> in the normal columnar surface epithelial cells and no signal from the cells in the crypt (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>), this indicates that the expression of <italic>AQP8</italic> is a marker only of fully differentiated surface colonic epithelial cells.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec><title>Tumors and cell lines</title><p>mRNA differential display RT-PCR (mRNA DD-PCR) was run on a panel of 24 fresh frozen colorectal tumors and 4 normal colon mucosa tissue (collected at the Ume&#x000e5; hospital 1987-1991).
