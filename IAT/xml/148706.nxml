These results suggest that both C and f(5)C as the wobble bases at the anticodon first position (position 34) can recognize A at the codon third position (position 3) in the fruit fly mt translation system. tRNA(Ser)GCU corresponding to AGU, AGC and AGA serine codons was found to contain unmodified G at the anticodon wobble position, suggesting the utilization of an unconventional G34-A3 base pair during translation. When these tRNA anticodon sequences are compared with those of other animal counterparts, it is concluded that either unmodified C or G at the wobble position can recognize A at the codon third position and that modification from A to t(6)A at position 37, 3'-adjacent to the anticodon, seems to be important for tRNA possessing C34 to recognize A3 in the mRNA in the fruit fly mt translation system.</p></abstract></article-meta></front></article>
