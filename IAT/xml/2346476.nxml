Type 1 protein phosphatase (PP1) is one of the major serine/threonine phosphatase classes found in all eukaryotic cells. Cloning of the catalytic subunits of PP1 (PP1c) revealed that there are distinct enzyme forms which had not been distinguished biochemically. Phylogenetic analysis has revealed that there is an evolutionarily conserved distinction between animal PP1&#x003b1; (human PP1&#x003b1; and &#x003b3;; <italic>Drosophila PP1&#x003b1;87B</italic>, <italic>PP1&#x003b1;13C </italic>and <italic>PP1&#x003b1;96A</italic>) and PP1&#x003b2; (human PP1&#x003b2; or PP1&#x003b4;; <italic>Drosophila PP1&#x003b2;9C</italic>) implying that the gene products have distinct biological functions despite their identical biochemical properties <italic>in vitro </italic>and &#x0003e;85% sequence identity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. In <italic>Drosophila </italic>larvae, PP1&#x003b1;87B provides 80% of the total PP1 catalytic activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>], with 10% each being attributed to PP1&#x003b1;96A and PP1&#x003b2;9C [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. PP1&#x003b1;87B and PP1&#x003b2;9C are both essential for viability, however PP1&#x003b1;96A and PP1&#x003b1;13C are dispensable [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>].</p><p>PP1 has numerous diverse functions within the cell including regulation of cell cycle, cytoskeleton, transcription and synaptic plasticity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. While, <italic>in vitro</italic>, the catalytic subunit (PP1c) dephosphorylates a wide variety of substrates, the enzyme <italic>in vivo </italic>is found in a variety of complexes with different protein partners [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. These PP1 interacting proteins target PP1c to specific subcellular locations, and modulate its activity towards different substrates. When complexed to a regulatory subunit, PP1c becomes much less promiscuous in its activity, so genuine PP1 interacting proteins tend to inhibit PP1c activity in standard <italic>in vitro </italic>assays (against phosphorylase <italic>a </italic>or myelin basic protein), even though their <italic>in vivo </italic>role is to promote PP1c's activity towards a specific substrate. At least 50 PP1c targeting subunits have now been described, including the G-subunit, that targets PP1c to glycogen particles, the M-subunit that targets PP1c to myosin, and Sara that targets PP1c to the TGF&#x003b2; receptor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>].</p><p>The three human PP1c isozymes localise to different subcellular regions in both mitotically active cells and in terminally differentiated cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. This suggests that there are targeting subunits that differentiate between the PP1c proteins. So far, mammalian neurabin I and neurabin II/Spinophilin, have been shown to selectively co-precipitate with mammalian PP1&#x003b3; and PP1&#x003b1; in preference to PP1&#x003b2; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. Repo-man has a modest (3-fold) preference for PP1&#x003b3; over PP1&#x003b1;, however the ability of Repo-man to distinguish between PP1&#x003b3; and PP1&#x003b2; has not been reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. Recent co-immunoprecipitation assays have identified a few more mammalian isozyme specific PP1-interacting proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. In <italic>Drosophila</italic>, one PP1&#x003b2;-specific binding protein has been described, MYPT-75D; this probably is important for mediating the single essential function of PP1&#x003b2; in flies, which is regulation of non-muscle myosin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. No <italic>Drosophila </italic>proteins with a preference for binding PP1&#x003b1; rather than PP1&#x003b2; have been described.</p><p>URI (unconventional prefoldin RPB5 interactor) has been implicated in modulation of the transcriptional response to nutritional cues in humans and <italic>S. cerevisiae </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. URI mutant <italic>S. cerevisiae </italic>are viable, but constitutively over-express genes important for amino acid metabolism. <italic>C. elegans uri-1 </italic>mutant animals are also viable, but have defects in germ cell proliferation and DNA stability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. Human RMP (RPB5-mediating protein) is identical to URI, except that the clone described lacks the N-terminal 25aa. RMP was identified through its ability to bind the RPB5 subunit of RNA polymerase, and was demonstrated to have weak transcriptional co-repressor activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. URI (lacking the first 75aa) has also been named NNX3 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. Here we present a functional analysis of the <italic>Drosophila uri </italic>gene.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Uri is a PP1&#x003b1; specific binding protein</title><p>To identify potential regulatory subunits of the major protein phosphatase catalytic subunit of <italic>Drosophila </italic>we screened a yeast two-hybrid library using <italic>Drosophila </italic>PP1&#x003b1;87B as a bait and isolated 25 cDNAs representing 16 different genes. One of these genes (<italic>CG11416</italic>, <italic>uri</italic>) was represented by 2 independent clones. <italic>CG11416 </italic>has been described as the <italic>Drosophila </italic>homologue of URI since the N-terminal region (aa 30&#x02013;124, wavy box in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>) contains a Prefoldin domain, most similar to that of human URI (RMP, NNX3), and the C-terminus contains a short region of homology termed the URI-Box (aa 720&#x02013;729, grey box in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>) (Full alignment shown in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>], supplementary material). The <italic>uri </italic>predicted transcript encodes a protein of 731 amino acids with a calculated molecular weight of 84 kDa, although the protein runs at 110 kDa in SDS PAGE, and an isoelectric point (pI) of 4.66. Two coiled coil domains outside the prefoldin domain are predicted (striped boxes in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>). Human URI does not contain additional coiled-coil regions, but <italic>C. elegans uri-1 </italic>does. The overall acidity of the protein is partly explained by a very acidic region at aa 170&#x02013;185. Human URI also has an acidic domain, as does worm <italic>uri-1</italic>. <italic>Drosophila </italic>Uri has three putative PP1c binding motifs ([KR]X{0,1} [VI]X [FW]) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>] at amino acids 337 (KVNF), 403 (RISF) and 469 (RNIEF), (asterisks in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>), while human URI and worm <italic>uri-1 </italic>each contain one PP1c binding motif (RVEF in human; KIKF in worm) at the end of the prefoldin domain. <italic>Drosophila </italic>Uri contains four predicted nuclear localisation signals (NLS) (inverted triangles in figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>); both human URI and worm <italic>uri-1 </italic>have two NLSs. The C-terminal region of <italic>Drosophila </italic>Uri contains a repeat sequence (from aa 504&#x02013;568 and aa 587&#x02013;651, stippled in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>) that shows no homology to the URI proteins from other species, or to any other protein sequence in the database (NCBI Blast).</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>uri genomic region, mutant alleles and protein domain architecture</bold>.

Nevertheless, PP1&#x003b2;9C is structurally distinct from the PP1&#x003b1; isozymes and is encoded by an essential gene [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>], suggesting some binding partners can distinguish between PP1c isozymes. Although <italic>uri </italic>was isolated in our small scale PP1&#x003b1;87B yeast two-hybrid screen, no <italic>uri </italic>clones were isolated in a 10-fold larger scale screen from the same library using PP1&#x003b2;9C as a bait [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>], suggesting that Uri may be a PP1&#x003b1;-specific binding protein. We directly tested this in yeast two-hybrid, and found that Uri was able to bind all three PP1&#x003b1; forms, but was unable to interact with PP1&#x003b2;9C (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="F2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p><bold>Uri is a PP1&#x003b1; specific binding protein</bold>.

Addition of a PP1 targeting subunit will typically alter substrate specificity in the <italic>in vitro </italic>reaction, and therefore inhibit the ability of PP1c to dephosphorylate a wide variety of phosphosubstrates. We tested the ability of Uri to inhibit the myelin basic protein (MBP) phosphatase activities of recombinant PP1&#x003b1;87B and PP1&#x003b2;9C. Bacterially expressed Uri inhibited the PP1&#x003b1;87B MBP phosphatase activity with higher affinity than the PP1&#x003b2;9C MBP phosphatase activity. The Uri IC<sub>50 </sub>against PP1&#x003b1;87B was about 25-fold lower than that of Uri against PP1&#x003b2;9C (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>). No antibodies have been produced that can distinguish between the <italic>Drosophila </italic>PP1 proteins, so, to test the interaction between Uri and PP1&#x003b1; and PP1&#x003b2; <italic>in vivo</italic>, we ectopically expressed HA-tagged PP1&#x003b1;87B and PP1&#x003b2;9C proteins in flies, and tested their ability to co-immunoprecipitate with endogenous Uri. arm-GAL4 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>] flies have low-level ubiquitous expression of the yeast transcription factor Gal4p, which activates expression of transgenes under the control of the Gal4p target site, UAS. Immunoprecipitation of cell lysates of arm-GAL4; UAS-HA-PP1&#x003b1;87B and arm-GAL4; UAS-HA-PP1&#x003b2;9C flies with anti-Uri antibodies, followed by immunoblotting with anti-HA antibodies, showed that HA-PP1&#x003b1;87B co-precipitated more efficiently with Uri than did HA-PP1&#x003b2;9C (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2C</xref>), consistent with PP1c activity assay data. The reciprocal experiment, immuno-precipitation with anti-HA antibodies and immunoblotting with anti-Uri antibodies confirmed this difference in the strength of the interactions (data not shown). Therefore Uri is the first <italic>Drosophila </italic>PP1c interacting protein to be shown to interact with PP1&#x003b1; with significantly higher affinity than with PP1&#x003b2;.</p><p>Since human URI also contains a predicted PP1c binding motif we investigated its ability bind different human PP1c isozymes. FLAG-tagged URI/RMP was transiently expressed in COS 7 tissue culture cells along with V5-tagged human PP1&#x003b1; or PP1&#x003b2;; PP1&#x003b1; was expressed more strongly in these experiments than PP1&#x003b2;. Immunoprecipitation of cell lysates with anti-FLAG antibodies followed by immunoblotting with anti-V5 antibodies showed that human PP1&#x003b1; co-precipitated efficiently with the human URI. Co-immunoprecipitation of PP1&#x003b2; and FLAG-tagged URI/RMP was not detected (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2C</xref>). A deletion construct of human URI/RMP (RMP-D2) has been reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>], the region of URI/RMP included in this construct is indicated by the bracket below the human protein in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>. The putative PP1 binding sites in URI/RMP are missing in this deletion derivative. We found no co-immunoprecipitation between either of the PP1 isozymes and URI/RMP-D2. This consistent with the notion that the RVEF putative PP1 binding site on URI is important for the URI-PP1c association, although other sites missing in the truncated protein could also be implicated in the interaction. <italic>Drosophila </italic>Uri could also bind mammalian PP1&#x003b1; with higher affinity then PP1&#x003b2; when they were co-expressed in mammalian tissue culture (data not shown). Therefore, despite low overall sequence homology, the ability of Uri to discriminate between different PP1c isozymes is evolutionarily conserved.</p></sec><sec><title>Uri protein is predominantly cytoplasmic</title><p>Human URI is an RPB5 binding protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. This interaction, along with the predicted nuclear localisation sequence and the known role for human URI in transcriptional regulation, would predict that at least some URI protein should be nuclear and chromatin associated. To test this, we transiently expressed FLAG-tagged <italic>Drosophila </italic>Uri, human URI/RMP and URI/RMP-D2 and visualised their localisation by immunofluorescence. URI/RMP-D2 lacks the prefoldin domain but retains the ability to bind RPB5 in COS7 mammalian tissue culture cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. We found that Uri (<italic>Drosophila</italic>) and URI/RMP (human) proteins were predominantly cytoplasmic with perinuclear localisation (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A, B</xref>). This is consistent with the cytoplasmic localisation for the N-terminally deleted NNX3 clone of URI/RMP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. When URI/RMP-D2 was expressed, strong nuclear localisation of the protein was observed (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3C</xref>), indicating that the regions deleted from this construct are important for regulation of the nuclear localisation of URI protein. Human URI/RMP has been shown to bind DMAP1, a DNA methyltransferase-1 associated protein implicated in gene silencing, and this interaction promotes the nuclear re-localisation of URI/RMP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. To test whether the interaction between Uri and PP1 similarly altered the subcellular localisation of either protein, we co-expressed <italic>Drosophila </italic>Uri with PP1&#x003b1;87B in COS7 cells. PP1&#x003b1;87B, when expressed alone, can be detected in the cytoplasm, but is primarily nuclear (single transfected cell indicated by an arrow in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3E</xref>). When PP1&#x003b1;87B was co-expressed with Uri, both proteins were more abundant in the cytoplasm; both the nuclear accumulation of PP1&#x003b1;87B and the perinuclear accumulation of Uri was lost (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3D&#x02013;F</xref>, arrowhead indicates nucleus of a co-transfected cell).</p><fig position="float" id="F3"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p><bold>Uri is cytoplasmic when expressed in COS7 cells, and can cause re-localisation of PP1&#x003b1;</bold>. FLAG-tagged Uri (A), URI/RMP (B) or URI/RMP-D2 (C) were expressed in COS7 cells and visualised by immunofluorescence. Uri and URI/RMP were predominantly cytoplasmic, with a perinuclear concentration and weak nuclear staining.

In wild type primary spermatocytes (all stages), and maturing spermatids (not shown) Uri was found throughout the cytoplasm, with a distinctive concentration in small speckles (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5A&#x02013;C</xref>). No specific localisation to the nucleus was apparent. Persistence of Uri into post-meiotic stages indicates that it has a long half life, as no transcript was detected at this stage. To test whether the localisation in testis is simply an oddity of this tissue we examined Uri localisation in salivary glands and embryos. In salivary gland Uri was predominantly cytoplasmic, with a mild perinuclear accumulation (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5D&#x02013;F</xref>). In embryos we also found that Uri protein in interphase cells is primarily cytoplasmic, and some protein was in speckles in both the nucleus and the cytoplasm.

Only chromatin associated proteins are preserved for staining in these spread preparations, explaining the discrepancy between the chromatin localisation seen in spreads and the cytoplasmic localisation seen in whole mount.

These apparently unconnected phenotypes suggest that <italic>uri </italic>is involved in multiple processes, making a strong case for its further characterisation.</p><p>Numerous lines of evidence implicate <italic>uri </italic>in transcriptional regulation. Both human and yeast URI proteins function as weak transcriptional repressors; <italic>scUri </italic>is also a context dependent activator [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. Yeast URI (Bud27p) also binds to Gis1p's jmjC (histone demethylase) domain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. Human RMP (URI) was identified as a binding partner of RBP5, an RNA polymerase subunit. Consistent with this, we found that a fraction of endogenous Uri protein is associated with sites of active transcription on salivary polytene chromosomes and this association was maintained as the transcriptional profile changed in response to heat shock. This is consistent with a role for Uri in general transcriptional activation rather than repression.</p><p>Given the chromatin functions of Uri-containing complexes it is surprising that endogenous Uri is predominantly cytoplasmic. The URI/RMP prefoldin domain C-terminal half, with a predicted coiled-coil structure, acts as a cytoplasmic anchor in human cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. This region interacts with DNA methyltransferase 1-associating protein, and this interaction promotes nuclear re-localisation. The putative PP1c interacting motif of the human protein also resides at the prefoldin domain C-terminus. Over-expression of <italic>Drosophila </italic>Uri prevented nuclear accumulation of co-expressed PP1&#x003b1;, indicating that PP1 does not promote Uri nuclear localisation (Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>). When ectopically expressed in human tissue culture cells, <italic>Drosophila </italic>Uri and human URI showed a perinuclear accumulation, this was also seen in salivary glands <italic>in vivo</italic>. In other cells, most obviously spermatocytes, Uri localised to cytoplasmic speckles. We are unsure what organelle or subcellular structures are associated with Uri speckles, although the speckles do not co-localise with the Golgi apparatus, or with P-bodies, which have similar speckled cytoplasmic localisation patterns in spermatocytes (data not shown).</p><p>Since both <italic>ScUri </italic>and human URI have been implicated in TOR signalling we examined expression in <italic>uri </italic>null embryos of <italic>Drosophila </italic>homologues of genes downstream of <italic>scUri</italic>. Two of the genes tested, <italic>CG1315 </italic>and <italic>ebony </italic>were reproducibly expressed at lower levels in mutant embryos. Thus, in contrast to the yeast situation, <italic>uri </italic>is required for full expression of these genes. TOR signalling in <italic>Drosophila </italic>is important for larval growth; mutant larvae grow slowly, but live for up to 30 days [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. <italic>uri</italic><sup>110<italic>b </italic></sup>larvae die soon after hatching and are not developmentally delayed, indicating that, although <italic>uri </italic>may be implicated in regulation of TOR target genes, it probably has a wider range of target genes and/or other cellular functions. Further examination of the transcript profiles in mutant animals, for example by microarray analysis, would reveal the full extent of the transcriptional defect in <italic>uri </italic>mutant larvae. Human URI was isolated in a complex that also contained TIP48, TIP49, RBP5 and several small prefoldin domain proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. Like <italic>uri</italic>, <italic>Drosophila </italic>TIP48 (reptin) and TIP49 (pontin) mutant die as first instar larvae with no obvious defects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>], so <italic>uri </italic>lethality could potentially be attributable to defects in a complex containing these ATPases.</p><p>Uri protein is most abundant in embryos, pupae and in adult gonads; where expression is higher in germline than soma. This germline enrichment of fly Uri correlated well with the sterility phenotype in worms, and led us to investigate <italic>uri</italic>'s role in gonads in more detail. Partial somatic rescue of <italic>uri </italic>mutant flies enabled us to analyse the cell autonomous germline role, and revealed strong effects in both males and females. In both sexes the major defect was reduced cell viability. Spermatogenesis in flies is maintained by a population of stem cells, which give rise to spermatogonia. Defects in stem cell self renewal or survival eventually lead to empty (or nearly empty) testes, as stem cells are not maintained. Similarly, defects in spermatogonial survival lead to extremely small testes, as only stem cells remain. The somatically rescued <italic>uri </italic>male phenotype is consistent with loss of stem or early spermatogonial cells. The testes were mostly filled with dead or dying cells, indicating that <italic>uri </italic>is required for cell viability. Very few late spermatids were found, although we could occasionally see motile sperm. These would have initiated spermatogenesis in early larvae, and may have been saved by perdurance of maternally provided Uri protein. Provision of Uri to the germline using Bam-Gal4-VP16, which expresses in late spermatogonia and early spermatocytes, partially rescued the testis phenotype. Many more later stages of spermatogenesis were seen, indicating that <italic>uri </italic>is required for the viability of late spermatogonia and spermatocytes. Testes rescued by expression of <italic>uri </italic>with Bam-Gal4-VP16 had fewer early spermatogonia than wild type testes. The inefficient rescue of these cells show that <italic>uri </italic>is required in all spermatogonia, and possibly also in germline stem cells, to maintain cell viability. The RNA <italic>in situ </italic>confirms that <italic>uri </italic>is most highly expressed in spermatogonia and early spermatocytes. Somatically rescued <italic>uri </italic>females had thinner germaria than wild type, and mostly lacked later oogenesis stages.</p><p><italic>C. elegans uri-1 </italic>is important to maintain DNA stability in the worm germline. By analogy with worms, the cell death could be due to accumulation of DNA damage; it could also be due to transcriptional defects, as <italic>uri </italic>is required for transcription. We established that <italic>uri </italic>mutants have defects in maintenance of DNA integrity, as shown by TUNEL staining. This is in complete agreement with the <italic>C. elegans </italic>findings. However, we cannot rule out the possibility that primary defects in transcriptional regulation lead to the DNA damage phenotype as a secondary effect.</p><p>Most PP1c interacting proteins do not discriminate between PP1&#x003b1; and PP1&#x003b2; isozymes. MYPT-75D was the first <italic>Drosophila </italic>protein to show differential binding, having higher affinity to PP1&#x003b2; than PP1&#x003b1;.

Uri is the first <italic>Drosophila </italic>protein to be demonstrated to have a strong preference for PP1&#x003b1; over PP1&#x003b2;. An essential, non-redundant function for PP1&#x003b1; is suggested by inability of PP1&#x003b2; to rescue PP1&#x003b1; mutants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. Lethality of <italic>uri </italic>mutants supports the notion that PP1&#x003b1; has a role that cannot be supplied by PP1&#x003b2;. Uri can bind all the <italic>Drosophila </italic>PP1&#x003b1; isozymes, and indeed was identified as a PP1&#x003b1;96A putative interacting protein in a large scale yeast two-hybrid screen [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]. Canonical PP1c binding sites in human and worm URI suggested that binding to PP1 was probably conserved for this protein. We confirmed the human URI-PP1c interaction directly, adding URI to the ever-growing list of PP1c binding proteins. More excitingly, we show that interaction with PP1&#x003b1; in preference to PP1&#x003b2; is conserved between fly and mammalian URI.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Here we have shown that <italic>Drosophila uri</italic>, is an essential PP1&#x003b1;-specific binding protein.
