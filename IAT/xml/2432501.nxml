Here, using electrophoretic mobility shifting assay (EMSA) in the presence of DNA with different chain-lengths, we observed that tau protein favored binding to a 13 bp or a longer polynucleotide. The results from atomic force microscopy also showed that tau protein preferred a 13 bp polynucleotide to a 12 bp or shorter polynucleotide. In a competitive assay, a minor groove binder distamycin A was able to replace the bound tau from the DNA double helix, indicating that tau protein binds to the minor groove. Tau protein was able to protect the double-strand from digestion in the presence of DNase I that was bound to the minor groove. On the other hand, a major groove binder methyl green as a negative competitor exhibited little effect on the retardation of tau-DNA complex in EMSA. This further indicates the DNA minor groove as the binding site for tau protein. EMSA with truncated tau proteins showed that both the proline-rich domain (PRD) and the microtubule-binding domain (MTBD) contributed to the interaction with DNA; that is to say, both PRD and MTBD bound to the minor groove of DNA and bent the double-strand, as observed by electron microscopy. To investigate whether tau protein is able to prevent DNA from the impairment by hydroxyl free radical, the chemiluminescence emitted by the phen-Cu/H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>/ascorbate was measured. The emission intensity of the luminescence was markedly decreased when tau protein was present, suggesting a significant protection of DNA from the damage in the presence of hydroxyl free radical.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="10"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Tau is a major microtubule-binding protein that is important for the assembly and stabilization of microtubules <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002600-Drechsel1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>.

To investigate the minimum polynucleotide that is bound to tau protein, we synthesized a series of polynucleotides (11&#x02013;26 bp) and incubated them with tau protein for EMSA (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0002600-t001">Table 1</xref>). The mobility of DNA bands was reduced in the presence of tau protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002600-g001">Figure 1A</xref>). This effect was particularly marked for polynucleotides of 13 bp or greater in length. Under these experimental conditions, no reduction in mobility of the polynucleotides was observed in the absence of tau (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002600-g001">Figure 1B</xref>). To investigate further whether the protein discriminated between 13 bp and other lengths of polynucleotides, 12 bp and 13 bp polynucleotides were incubated with tau and subjected to EMSA. A band shift for the 13 bp DNA incubated with tau was observed, but not for 12 bp DNA under the same conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002600-g002">Figure 2A</xref>). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002600-g002">Figure 2B</xref>, the incubation of 14 bp DNA with tau protein at different concentrations showed that the degree of retardation depended upon the quantitative ratio between the protein and DNA (the ratio is defined in <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>). This suggests that tau protein prefers binding to a 13 bp or a longer polynucleotide.</p><table-wrap id="pone-0002600-t001" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0002600.t001</object-id><label>Table 1</label><caption><title>Double stranded polynucleotides synthesized.</title></caption><graphic id="pone-0002600-t001-1" xlink:href="pone.0002600.t001"/><table frame="hsides" rules="groups" alternate-form-of="pone-0002600-t001-1"><colgroup span="1"><col align="left" span="1"/><col align="center" span="1"/></colgroup><thead><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Number of base pairs</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Nucleotide sequence</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">26 bp</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><named-content content-type="gene">5&#x02032;actccgtgcataaataataggcactcg3&#x02032;</named-content></td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><named-content content-type="gene">3&#x02032;gaggcacgtatttattatccgtgagcc5&#x02032;</named-content></td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">21 bp</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><named-content content-type="gene">5&#x02032;gctccgtgcataaataataggc3&#x02032;</named-content></td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><named-content content-type="gene">3&#x02032;gaggcacgtatttattatccgagc5&#x02032;</named-content></td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">16 bp</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><named-content content-type="gene">5&#x02032;actccgtgcataaataa3&#x02032;</named-content></td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><named-content content-type="gene">3&#x02032;gaggcacgtatttatt5&#x02032;</named-content></td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">15 bp</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><named-content content-type="gene">5&#x02032;atccgtgcataaataa3&#x02032;</named-content></td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><named-content content-type="gene">3&#x02032;aggcacgtatttattc5&#x02032;</named-content></td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">14 bp</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><named-content content-type="gene">5&#x02032;accgtgcataaataa3&#x02032;</named-content></td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><named-content content-type="gene">3&#x02032;ggcacgtatttattc5&#x02032;</named-content></td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">13 bp</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><named-content content-type="gene">5&#x02032;acgtgcataaataa3&#x02032;</named-content></td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><named-content content-type="gene">3&#x02032;gcacgtatttattc5&#x02032;</named-content></td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">12 bp</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><named-content content-type="gene">5&#x02032;agtgcataaataa3&#x02032;</named-content></td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><named-content content-type="gene">3&#x02032;cacgtatttattc5&#x02032;</named-content></td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">11 bp</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><named-content content-type="gene">5&#x02032;actccgtgcata3&#x02032;</named-content></td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><named-content content-type="gene">3&#x02032;gaggcacgtatc5&#x02032;</named-content></td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><fig id="pone-0002600-g001" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0002600.g001</object-id><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>Electrophoretic mobility shift assay of double-stranded polynucleotides with different chain lengths in the presence of tau protein.</title><p>Double-stranded polynucleotides (100 ng) with different chain lengths (as indicated in each lane and <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0002600-t001">Table 1</xref>) were incubated with tau23 at a ratio &#x0005b;protein&#x0005d;/&#x0005b;DNA&#x0005d; of 1/10 in the buffer of 20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.2), containing 50 mM NaCl, 0.5 mM DTT, 1 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub> and 0.5 mM EDTA at room temperature for 30 min, and then aliquots were taken for electrophoresis on a nondenaturing 20&#x00025; polyacrylamide gel (A).

That is to say, tau protein stabilizes DNA double strands. In this work, as mentioned above, we have found that tau protein is a DNA minor groove binder that protects DNA under the attack of hydroxyl free radical.</p><p>First, to investigate the manner of tau binding to DNA, we should determine what the basic chain-length of a DNA can be associated with tau protein. Thus, we synthesized DNA in different chain lengths from 9 to 26 base pairs. We have observed that tau protein is bound to a 13 bp polynucleotide, whereas shows no or at least much weaker potential to associate with a 12 bp or shorter dsDNA. Using EMSA, a band shift for 13 bp polynucleotide was markedly observed, but not for 12 bp DNA. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002600-g002">Figure 2B</xref>, the association of 14 bp DNA with tau protein also causes retardation of the DNA band mobility in the gel. Furthermore, as observed by AFM, the size of the complex of 13 bp DNA-tau is clearly larger than that of the mixture containing 12 bp DNA and tau, indicating 12 bp DNA and tau are separately on the mica surface. This indicates that tau and 13 bp DNA are associated to form complexes. The results from EMSA also show a marked retardation of 13 bp DNA band in the presence of tau on the gel, but not 12 bp DNA; that is, a 13 bp DNA is a basic motif for tau protein to bind.</p><p>Second, tau protein is demonstrated binding to the minor groove of dsDNA without nucleotide sequence specificity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002600-g004">Figures 4</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002600-g005"/><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002600-g006">6</xref>). This view is supported by the following observations: (1) Displacement by distamycin A and competition with DNase I indicate that the minor groove of the DNA double helix is the binding site for tau protein. (2) As mentioned above, the major groove binder methyl green does not markedly compete with tau protein in the association with DNA. (3) Some important nucleic associated proteins, such as histone H2b and H3 recognize the minor groove binding to DNA without sequence specificity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002600-Adams1">&#x0005b;36&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002600-Rogers1">&#x0005b;37&#x0005d;</xref>.

(5) According to a recent study, if a protein binds to the major groove, it should associate with DNA in a sequence specific manner <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002600-Roy1">&#x0005b;38&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002600-Bruce1">&#x0005b;40&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>For B-type DNA, 10 base pairs make an entire DNA double helix. Tau protein, however, preferably bound to a 13 bp or longer polynucleotides, suggesting a special mode of binding between tau and DNA. As mentioned above, the affinity of the mutant &#x003c4;Pro or &#x003c4;MTBD was much lower than the intact tau protein. It appears that tau could be bound to a 12 bp or shorter DNA unless the protein concentration is high enough. This implies a simultaneous association of both PRD and MTBD with the dsDNA. If the two domains bound to the minor groove in different orientations, as found for a POU box protein whose homeodomain and POU-specific domain bind to a DNA octamer <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002600-Klemm1">&#x0005b;41&#x0005d;</xref>, tau protein should strongly associate with a shorter length of dsDNA (&#x0003c;10 bp). As illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002600-g011">Figure 11A</xref>, we hypothesize here that both PRD and MTBD may associate simultaneously with the minor groove of dsDNA within the same plane. The data which support this proposed model are as the following: (1) Tau protein binds to a 13 bp or longer DNA. In the case of a 10 bp polynucleotide, its minor groove may not be long enough for PRD and MTBD to bind at the same time in the same orientation plane. That is to say, when the proline-rich domain occupies the minor groove, there is not sufficient minor groove within a 10 bp polynucleotide to accommodate the microtubule-binding domain in the same orientation and vice versa. Nonetheless, a 13 bp (or a longer) polynucleotide is long enough to provide binding sites for the two domains. (2) The association of tau bends DNA double-strand as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002600-g011">Figure 11B</xref>. If the two domains bound to DNA in different orientations, the DNA strands would not be bent.</p><fig id="pone-0002600-g011" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0002600.g011</object-id><label>Figure 11</label><caption><title>A hypothetic model of the tau-DNA interaction.</title><p>The proline-rich domain and the microtubule-binding domain may bind to the DNA minor groove in the same orientation plane (A).

In the presence of formaldehyde, however, the association of tau protein with DNA is suppressed.

That is to say, Lys is the essential residue for tau to interact with DNA. Furthermore, we have constructed the mutants &#x003c4;N and &#x003c4;C and suspended them with DNA. We could not observe the association of the two mutants with DNA measured on EMSA. This suggests that the Lys residues out of the PRD and MTBD are not related to the DNA binding. The Lys residues of PRD and MTBD are essential to interact with the minor groove of DNA. Although the PRD (7 Lys) and MTBD (12 Lys) contain 19 Lys residues, some of them are supposed to be involved in the interaction between tau and DNA. This viewpoint is based on the following points: (1) the pK of the &#x003b5;-amino group of Lys is 10.8 interacting with DNA bases in electrostatics; (2) the interaction between tau and DNA is markedly suppressed at the pH higher than 12, showing dependent upon the electrostatics measured by EMSA; and (3) modification with formaldehyde interferes with the association of tau with DNA.</p><p>DNA damage is an extremely important event during cell dysfunction or apoptosis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002600-Wiseman1">&#x0005b;29&#x0005d;</xref>. Hydroxyl free radical attacks and impairs DNA, lipid, and protein. We have employed 1,10-phenanthroline and copper in the presence of ascorbate to investigate the DNA damage and the protect ability of tau. The reaction of 1,10-phenanthroline with hydrogen peroxide in the presence of copper results in chemiluminescence. The &#x022c5;OH radical produced from the reaction impairs and breaks DNA, leading to an increase of the chemiluminescence. As mentioned above, prevention of DNA from the impairment by &#x022c5;OH depends on tau concentration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002600-g010">Figure 10B</xref>).
