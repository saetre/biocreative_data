GxcDD is a 180-kDa multidomain protein containing a type 3 CH domain, two IQ motifs, three PH domains, a RhoGEF domain and an ArfGAP domain. Inactivation of the gene results in defective streaming during development under different conditions and a delay in developmental timing. The characterization of single domains revealed that the CH domain of GxcDD functions as a membrane association domain, the RhoGEF domain can physically interact with a subset of Rac GTPases, and the ArfGAP-PH tandem accumulates in cortical regions of the cell and on phagosomes.

GxcDD can bind to several Rac GTPases, but its function as a nucleotide exchange factor needs to be studied further.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>Rho GTPases are small monomeric GTPases of the Ras superfamily. Like any other GTPase Rho GTPases act as binary molecular switches cycling between a GTP-bound active and a GDP-bound inactive form. Guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) catalyze the activation reaction, and GTPase activating proteins (GAPs) convert the active to an inactive form. Further regulators, guanine nucleotide dissociation inhibitors (GDIs), block spontaneous activation and regulate cycling between membrane and cytosol. When activated, Rho GTPases undergo a conformational change enabling them to interact with their effector molecules and transduce signals for downstream events. Rho GTPases have been implicated in a large number of actin-related processes like motility, adhesion, morphogenesis, membrane trafficking and cytokinesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>].</p><p>The human genome codes for 21 Rho GTPases and functions of most of them are only poorly understood. Of these, three, namely RhoA, Rac1 and Cdc42 are more extensively studied. RhoA generates myosin-based contractility and formation of adhesion complexes; Rac1 and Cdc42 are primarily involved in formation of protrusive structures, Rac1 regulates formation of lamellipodia and Cdc42 regulates filopodia formation and establishment of cell polarity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>].</p><p>Sequencing of the genome of the social amoeba <italic>Dictyostelium discoideum </italic>revealed the presence of 18 Rac related GTPases, whereas a typical Rho or Cdc42 were absent [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. Only a few of the Rac related GTPases have been characterized in detail. Rac1A, 1B and 1C [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>] and Rac E are required for cytokinesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>], Rac1A was also shown to be involved in a formin-dependent pathway for filopodia formation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>], RacB is required for chemotaxis and morphogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>] and RacC has been implicated in phagocytosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>] and plays an important role in PI 3-kinase activation and WASP activation for the dynamic regulation of F-actin assembly during chemotaxis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. RacG is required for cell shape, motility, and phagocytosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>] and RacH has been implicated in vesicular trafficking [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>].</p><p>Compared to our understanding of the downstream effects of Rac GTPases less is known about the mechanisms that activate Rac GTPases controlled by GEFs, GAPs or GDIs. In <italic>Dictyostelium </italic>at least 45 proteins contain a RhoGEF-PH module and most of them have a unique domain composition. The RhoGEF-PH (or diffuse B-cell lymphoma homology DH/pleckstrin homology PH) module is the structural feature that mediates the nucleotide exchange activity on Rho GTPases. Five of these RacGEFs have been studied in some detail. DdRacGap1 (DRG) containing both RhoGEF and Rho-GAP domains acts as a GEF for Rac1 and simultaneously acts as a GAP for RacE and Rab GTPases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. RacGEF1 has a specificity for RacB in regulating chemoattractant stimulation, F-actin polymerization, and chemotaxis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. The tail domain of MyoM, an unconventional myosin has been shown to catalyse nucleotide exchange on Rac1 GTPases and can induce actin-driven surface protrusions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. More recently Trix, a three CH domain containing RacGEF, has been suggested to regulate the endocytic pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. Finally, Darlin, an armadillo repeat protein homologous to the mammalian GEF smgGDS (small G-protein dissociation stimulator, a guanine nucleotide exchange factor for numerous Ras and Rho family GTPases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]), has been shown to physically interact with RacE and RacC and may modulate chemotactic responses during early development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. Nucleotide exchange activity on Rho GTPases are also displayed by CZH (CDM-zizimin homology) domain proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. Presently only a few members of the family have been studied in other organisms like the mammalian Dock180 and CED-5 in <italic>C. elegans</italic>. <italic>Dictyostelium </italic>has 8 members of this family, but the functions of them remain to be elucidated.</p><p>In this study we focus on GxcDD, a novel multidomain RacGEF that contains a calponin homology (CH) domain, two IQ motifs, a DH domain, three PH domains and an ArfGAP domain. We show that, though dispensable for growth and development, GxcDD is required for proper streaming early in <italic>Dictyostelium </italic>development. The RacGEF domain of GxcDD can physically interact with several Rac GTPases. Characterization of the individual domains revealed that the CH domain can act as a membrane anchor and the ArfGAP-PH tandem accumulates at cortical regions and on phagosomes. Our data also suggest that a conformational change is possibly required to activate GxcDD.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Expression pattern and domain characterization of GxcDD</title><p>The gene coding for the RacGEF GxcDD (<bold>G</bold>uanine e<bold>X</bold>change factor for ra<bold>C</bold>) is located on chromosome 3. GxcDD is 1619 residues long with a calculated molecular mass of 179.652. It is a multidomain protein containing a CH domain, two IQ motifs, three PH domains, a RhoGEF domain and an ArfGAP domain (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>). The calponin homology (CH) domain is located at the N terminus and resides between residues 18&#x02013;122, the two IQ motifs between residues 390&#x02013;417 and 432&#x02013;461. The DH domain of RhoGEFs is the region required for mediating guanine nucleotide exchange on the Rho family GTPases. In general, a pleckstrin homology (PH) domain follows the DH (<italic>d</italic>iffuse B-cell lymphoma <italic>h</italic>omology) domain and this tandem DH-PH module is the signature motif of the Dbl family of guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs). Similarly, in GxcDD, a DH domain responsible for the catalytic RacGEF activity resides between residues 464&#x02013;637. There are three PH domains in GxcDD, a comparatively large and less defined PH domain between residues 664&#x02013;910 and two more between residues 941&#x02013;1038 and 1520&#x02013;1618. An ArfGAP domain, which shows highest homology to centaurin-&#x003b1; is placed between residues 1258&#x02013;1376. Centaurins are ArfGAPs with functions in intracellular trafficking and contain a PH domain. Centaurins act downstream of PI 3 kinases and are targets for PtdIns(3,4,5)P<sub>3 </sub>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>].</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Architecture, expression profile and subcellular localization of GxcDD.

As the polyclonal antibodies that had been raised against the ArfGAP-PH domain of GxcDD, were unsuitable for immunofluorescence, we addressed the subcellular localization of the protein by means of subcellular fractionation and Triton X-100 treatment of the cells. We found GxcDD to be equally present in the cytosolic and membranous fractions. It also associated with the Triton X-100 insoluble cytoskeletal fraction (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1D</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>The CH domain of GxcDD functions as a membrane association domain</title><p>To study the function of the CH domain in GxcDD we expressed it as a fusion with GFP in <italic>D. discoideum</italic>. Live cell imaging of GFP-CH showed that it almost completely localized to the cortical regions of the cell, suggesting it may either be associated with the cortical actin cytoskeleton or the plasma membrane. When GFP-CH expressing cells were stained for actin, we observed only a partial overlap at certain places, which might be due to the close proximity of cortical actin and the plasma membrane (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>). Furthermore, subcellular fractionation revealed that GFP-CH was completely recovered in the membrane fraction (Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>, lanes 1 and 2). When Triton-insoluble cytoskeletons were prepared we found GFP-CH exclusively in the supernatant fraction indicating that it does not associate with actin (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>, lanes 3 and 4). For control we used comitin, a membrane and actin cytoskeleton associated protein, and &#x003b1;-actinin, an F-actin crosslinking protein. Comitin is present in the membrane fraction and also in the cytoskeletal fraction, whereas &#x003b1;-actinin does not associate with the Triton-insoluble cytoskeleton due to its low affinity for F-actin. These findings demonstrate that the CH domain of GxcDD does not interact with actin but, surprisingly, associates with membranes. The CH domain of GxcDD thus can act as a membrane anchor for GxcDD.</p><fig position="float" id="F2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p>The CH domain of GxcDD acts as a membrane anchor.

Rac GTPases interacting with GST-DH were identified by immunoblotting with GFP monoclonal antibodies (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>).

We found that Rac1a, A, C, E, H and I bound to the DH domain of GxcDD, whereas RacB and RacD, that were expressed in very high amounts, did not bind to the DH domain, indicating specificity in the pulldown assay. The data indicate that GxcDD can activate more than one Rac. It is however also likely that it is not the only exchange factor for these interacting proteins.</p><fig position="float" id="F3"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p>Association of GxcDD with <italic>Dictyostelium </italic>Rac GTPases.

Arfs are small GTPases known to be required for vesicular trafficking. An ArfGAP domain would be required to inactivate the activated form of Arf [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. Similar to the association of PH domains with DH domains, the ArfGAP domain in GxcDD is associated with a PH domain. To examine the functions of these domains we expressed the C-terminal part containing the ArfGAP-PH tandem as a GFP fusion protein in AX2 cells. GFP-ArfGAP-PH was targeted to the cell cortex where it co-localized with actin (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A</xref>). Live-cell imaging experiments where GFP-ArfGAP-PH expressing cells were incubated with TRITC labelled yeast particles showed a strong enrichment of the fusion protein on phagosomes and at the leading edges of the cell (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B</xref>). Cell fractionation using Triton X-100 indicated a distribution of GFP-ArfGAP-PH in both the Triton-insoluble cytoskeleton fraction and in the supernatant (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4C</xref>). These results suggest that unlike the N-terminal CH domain, which is totally membrane bound, the C-terminal part can also associate with the actin cytoskeleton.</p><fig position="float" id="F4"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><p>Cortical localization of the C-terminus of GxcDD containing the ArfGAP-PH tandem and enrichment on phagosomes.

The precipitated proteins were resolved on SDS polyacrylamide gels and one of the unique bands analysed by MALDI-TOF mass spectroscopy identified GxcDD as an interacting protein. Co-precipitation of GxcDD was also confirmed by western blot analysis (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5A</xref>). To test whether the ArfGAP-PH domain interacts with itself and forms higher oligomers, we purified the ArfGAP-PH domain by thrombin cleavage from the GST fusion protein and treated it with increasing amounts of glutaraldehyde to promote crosslinking of associated proteins. The proteins were resolved on SDS polyacrylamide gels, blotted and probed with the GxcDD specific polyclonal antibodies. We did not observe formation of higher oligomers (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5B</xref>), indicating that the association of ArfGAP-PH with the full length GxcDD is through an interaction with other domains in the protein. We then checked if the N-terminal CH domain could interact with either the RacGEF domain or the ArfGAP-PH tandem in a GST-pulldown experiment using cells expressing the GFP-CH domain. We found that beads coated with ArfGAP-PH tandem could pulldown significant amounts of GFP-CH domain, as compared to beads coated with the RacGEF domain. Thus the CH domain at the N terminus can be an interacting domain for the ArfGAP-PH tandem and this interaction may regulate either the activity or localization of the protein.</p><fig position="float" id="F5"><label>Figure 5</label><caption><p>Interaction of ArfGAP-PH with full length GxcDD and phosphoinositides.

The developmental programme is completed upon reaching culmination and formation of the fruiting body.

However the developmental programme is delayed, and fruiting bodies are formed only after 28 hrs (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7A</xref>). A closer analysis showed that the early developmental stages took place timely until cells had formed aggregates, however from t12 onward development was delayed by more than 4 hours.

Seven other <italic>Dictyostelium </italic>RacGEFs contain a CH domain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. The Calponin homology (CH) domain is a protein module of about 100 amino acids present in the actin-binding protein calponin that controls smooth muscle contraction and cytoskeletal organization in non-muscle cells. The CH domain of calponin is however not responsible for its interaction with actin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. In contrast, the actin-binding domain (ABD) of several proteins is comprised of two CH domains in a tandem arrangement. CH domains are classified into at least five classes based on the degree of sequence similarity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. CH1 in association with CH2 can interact with actin. Isolated CH2 and CH3 domains do not interact with actin at all [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. CH4 and CH5 are found in the actopaxin/parvin family of actin-binding proteins implicated in linking integrins with intracellular pathways that regulate the actin cytoskeleton [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. Most RhoGEFs from <italic>Dictyostelium </italic>and other species like mammalian Vav and &#x003b1;-PIX contain one type 3 CH domain and have been implicated in signal transduction. The CH domain of GxcDD is also a type 3 CH domain and our studies indicate that this domain is targeted to membranes exclusively and does not interact with actin. The membrane targeting of the CH domain may regulate the association of GxcDD with membranous fractions. CH3 domain containing proteins are the group of CH domain containing proteins that have the most diverse functions among the CH domains. Our findings are consistent with the hypothesis that although the five CH domains are homologous and have structural similarity, they may have evolved to perform different functions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>].</p><p>The DH domain of RhoGEFs regulates the nucleotide exchange activity. The associated PH domain is required for its full catalytic activity and for phosphoinositide binding and localization of the protein. Recent studies in yeast have shown that only a small fraction of PH domains are capable of independent membrane targeting of a protein and those that do often require phosphoinositides and non-phosphoinositide determinants like Arf GTPases in some cases for subcellular localization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. GxcDD possesses a DH domain which is followed by two PH domains, the first being comparatively large and poorly conserved. We found that the DH domain can bind to a set of Rac GTPases (Rac1a, RacA, RacC, RacE, RacH and RacI) with sufficient affinity. However, our data need to be handled with caution, as mere physical interaction does not imply that all the above-mentioned Racs would be substrates for GxcDD <italic>in vivo</italic>. Further characterization of the interaction by enzymatic exchange assays needs to be performed for deeper understanding of its GEF activity. It is also possible that some of the interacting Racs and GxcDD might never see each other <italic>in vivo </italic>because of their subcellular localization e.g., RacH is mostly located at endosomes and not at the plasma membrane [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>].</p><p>A conformational change or binding of bioactive lipids to proteins are mechanisms known to activate a signal transducing protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. Our observation of the ArfGAP-PH tandem binding to GxcDD but not being able to form higher oligomers indicates that the ArfGAP-PH may interact with some other part of the protein and exist as an inactive form. A conformational change would then be required to convert it to its active form. A possible activator could be PtdIns(3,4,5)P which binds to the ArfGAP-PH tandem with significant affinity. In an ArfGAP, ASAP1, a member of the centaurin family, which has an ArfGAP-PH tandem like GxcDD, the PH domain is known to function as an autoinhibitory domain and upon activation by PtdIns the ArfGAP domain is activated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. A similar activation mechanism may also exist for GxcDD. The recruitment of the ArfGAP-PH tandem to the cortical regions of the cell and the phagocytic cup indicates a possible role in endocytic processes.</p><p>To understand the physiological role of GxcDD, we generated <italic>gxcDD</italic><sup>- </sup>cells. Our observations indicate that although cells lacking GxcDD grow normally under laboratory conditions, undergo development and complete it with the formation of fruiting bodies, streaming behavior during chemotaxis is altered and development delayed. <italic>Dictyostelium </italic>cells can form streams during the aggregation process, which is the result of a cAMP relay mechanism. In this process certain cells, the pacemaker cells, have the ability to produce cAMP. The secreted cAMP can bind to cARs (cAMP receptors, which are G-protein coupled receptors), which induce a multitude of signaling events. Activation of cARs leads to dissociation of the heterotrimeric G-proteins and membrane localization of CRAC (<italic>c</italic>ytosolic <italic>r</italic>egulator of <italic>a</italic>denylyl <italic>c</italic>yclase), a PH domain containing protein, followed by activation of adenylyl cyclase (ACA), cAMP production and secretion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. Activation of ACA is also regulated by another cytosolic regulator, Pianissimo [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. The neighboring cell then senses cAMP and streams of cells moving towards the aggregation centre are generated. A concerted action of 3-phosphoinositide metabolizing enzymes PI3K and PTEN are involved in tightly regulating the translocation of CRAC, Akt/PKB, PhdA (PH domain containg proteins) to the leading edge. Ras GTPases can activate PI3K. Ras C and its activator aimless RasGEF show decreased ACA activation. Cells lacking proteins that regulate ACA activity show defects in streaming or total loss and inability to aggregate or progress through development. It has been found that ACA localized to the rear of a migrating cell is required for formation of streams [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. ACA is possibly localized to the rear by a vesicular system that would require Arf function and GxcDD might be a part in its regulation. As GcxDD contains several functional and regulatory domains, it is likely to regulate signal transduction downstream of cAMP receptors (cARs). Binding of cAMP to the surface ligand activates PI3K whose products may use GxcDD as adaptor protein to bring about downstream signalling. GxcDD at the membrane may have either a function in conjunction with GTPases with its GEF and GAP domain or may act along with another combination of functional domains. Interference with such a complex network of intricate signalling is a possible mechanism for the delay in developmental timing in <italic>gxcDD</italic><sup>- </sup>cells.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>GxcDD is an unusual RacGEF containing CH domain, two IQ motifs, a RacGEF-PH tandem and an ArfGAP-PH tandem. It is present in cytosolic as well as membranous fractions. The CH domain of GxcDD localizes to the plasma membrane and may recruit GxcDD to the membrane and possibly regulate function and localization of the protein by binding to the ArfGAP-PH tandem. This is to the best of our knowledge the first evidence of membrane targeting of a CH, which would reveal an additional function for this functionally diverse domain. Our studies show that the RacGEF domain has the ability to physically interact with several Rac GTPases. To get a better insight to GxcDD function we need to perform nucleotide exchange assays to find the actual substrates for GxcDD. The ArfGAP-PH domain is associated with the leading edge of the cell and is able to associate with phosphatidyl inositides. It is also present in phagosomes and in Triton X-100 insoluble fractions. Deletion of the gene did not result in major phenotypic changes associated with growth, endocytic processes, actin organization, cytokinesis and cell motility, but shows subtle defects in formation of streams during aggregation and a delay in development.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Strain growth and development</title><p><italic>D. discoideum </italic>cells of strain AX2 were grown either with <italic>Klebsiella aerogenes </italic>on SM agar plates or axenically in liquid nutrient medium [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>] in shaking suspension at 160 rpm at 21&#x000b0;C. <italic>gxcDD</italic><sup>- </sup>cells were cultivated in axenic medium containing 3.5 &#x003bc;g/ml blasticidin (ICN Biochemicals, OH).
