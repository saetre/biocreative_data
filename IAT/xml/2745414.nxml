LPS consists of three major components: lipid A, core polysaccharides and O-linked polysaccharides. Lipid A, with its fatty acid anchors [lauric, myristic and sometimes palmitic acid], is an endotoxin primarily responsible for TNF&#x003b1;-mediated septic shock. The addition of myristic acid to the lipid A precursor is catalyzed by the enzyme MsbB [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>].</p><p>It has been shown that <italic>msbB Salmonella </italic>serovar Typhimurium exhibits severe growth defects in LB and sensitivity to bile salts (MacConkey) and EGTA-containing media. However, compensatory suppressor mutants can be isolated that grow under these conditions. One of these suppressor phenotypes results from a mutation in <italic>somA</italic>, a gene of unknown function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. <italic>msbB Salmonella </italic>Typhimurium strains have recently been developed as potential anti-cancer agents that possess impressive anti-tumor activity in mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. In a phase I clinical study <italic>msbB Salmonella </italic>were shown to be safe in humans when administered <italic>i.v</italic>. However, bacteria were rapidly cleared from the peripheral blood of humans and targeting to human tumors was only observed in few patients at the highest dose levels of 3 &#x000d7; 10<sup>8 </sup>CFU/m<sup>2 </sup>and 1 &#x000d7; 10<sup>9</sup>/m<sup>2 </sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Toso et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>] noted that YS1646 (suppressed <italic>msbB </italic>strain, see below) grew best in air without added CO<sub>2</sub>.</p><p>The potential to grow in acidic and CO<sub>2</sub>-rich environments is a hallmark of pathogenic bacteria, enhancing persistence within phagocytes and survival inside the host. Sensitivity to CO<sub>2 </sub>and low pH of <italic>msbB Salmonella </italic>strains might explain poor colonization of tumors, which often contain high levels of CO<sub>2 </sub>and lactic acid [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>] due to the Warburg effect, also known as aerobic glycolysis, whereby glucose uptake is elevated while oxidative phosphorylation is reduced, even in the presence of oxygen. Our previous work on suppressors of <italic>msbB Salmonella </italic>raised the possibility that secondary mutations could suppress sensitivity to 5% CO<sub>2 </sub>and acidic conditions.</p><p>Here we report that the growth of <italic>msbB Salmonella </italic>is highly inhibited (greater than 3-log reduction in plating efficiency) in a 5% CO<sub>2 </sub>atmosphere in LB media as well as under low pH conditions when compared to wild-type <italic>Salmonella</italic>. Furthermore, several CO<sub>2 </sub>resistant clones were selected from an <italic>msbB Salmonella </italic>transposon library (Tn<italic>5</italic>).

Suwwan deletion strains lack ~100 genes in the 17.7 to 19.9 Cs region of the chromosome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. In our studies, plating identical amounts (e.g., 100 &#x003bc;l of a 10<sup>-5 </sup>dilution of a culture grown under non-selective conditions) to duplicate plates incubated at 37&#x000b0;C in either air or 5% CO<sub>2</sub>, few or no colonies of YS1646 were observed after 16 hours of incubation at 37&#x000b0;C in 5% CO<sub>2 </sub>(Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). However, by plating more cells, the presence of a few resistant colonies could be detected, as we obtained 3.3 &#x000d7; 10<sup>8 </sup>CFU/ml on plates incubated in air and 1.7 &#x000d7; 10<sup>5 </sup>CFU/ml on plates incubated in the presence of 5% CO<sub>2</sub>, a greater than 3 log reduction. This CO<sub>2 </sub>sensitivity, first observed in YS1646, is also observed in a simple <italic>msbB </italic>mutant (see below).

In this pathway, Zwf converts glucose-6-phosphate, from glycolysis, to 6-phosphogluconate, generating NADPH + H. The subsequent reaction, catalyzed by Gnd, converts 6-phosphogluconate to ribulose-5-phosphate, generating NADPH + H and CO<sub>2 </sub>(Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>).

As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>, Zwf catalyzes the conversion of glucose-6-phosphate to 6-phosphogluconate. 6-phosphogluconate can also be formed from gluconate by gluconate kinase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>], which bypasses the PPP's requirement for Zwf (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). The addition of gluconate to media thereby allows for the production of 6-phosphogluconate in the absence of Zwf. The enzyme gluconate-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (Gnd) then decarboxylates 6-phosphogluconate, converting it from a 6-carbon to a 5-carbon (ribulose-5-phosphate) sugar and releasing CO<sub>2 </sub>gas.

Based upon this study and earlier studies on the sensitivity of <italic>zwf </italic>mutant to superoxides, <italic>zwf </italic>may both reduce virulence on one hand, yet potentiate growth under CO<sub>2 </sub>conditions on the other, further complicating virulence analyses.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Here, we report new growth defects in <italic>msbB Salmonella</italic>: sensitivity to gluconate and growth in hypertonic, acidic or 5% CO<sub>2 </sub>conditions. These characteristics are in addition to the previously reported growth defects in the presence of salt, EGTA, polymyxin, or MacConkey media. Previous studies showing that MsbB is a virulence factor require further evaluation of the role that CO<sub>2 </sub>sensitivity plays. The potential for cryptic, spontaneous mutations remains a possibility that should be addressed by re-transduction under non-selective conditions followed by plating independently under CO<sub>2 </sub>and ambient air. We have created an <italic>msbB somA zwf Salmonella </italic>strain that is resistant to growth under acidic or 5% CO<sub>2 </sub>conditions. This strain contains a loss-of-function mutation in <italic>zwf</italic>, an enzyme in the pentose phosphate pathway that produces CO<sub>2 </sub>as it converts a 6 carbon sugar to a 5 carbon sugar. The study of the virulence of <italic>msbB zwf Salmonella </italic>will allow the determination of what types of virulence are attributable to cells having an MsbB lipid A independent of sensitivity to 5% CO<sub>2</sub>, which is required for <italic>in vitro </italic>and <italic>in vivo </italic>virulence assays.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Bacterial strains, plasmids, phage and media</title><p>The bacterial strains and plasmids used in this study are listed in Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>. The <italic>Salmonella msbB </italic>insertion/deletion for tetracycline resistance was described by Low et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. P22 mutant HT105/1<italic>int201 </italic>(obtained from the <italic>Salmonella </italic>Genetic Stock Center, Calgary, Canada) was used for <italic>Salmonella </italic>transductions. <italic>Salmonella enterica </italic>serovar Typhimurium strains were grown on LB-0 or MSB agar or in LB, LB-0, buffered LB or MSB broth. MSB media consists of LB (Luria-Bertani media, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]) with no NaCl and supplemented with 2 mM MgSO4 and 2 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>. LB-0 is LB media with no NaCl. Buffered LB pH 7.5 and pH 6.5 consisted of LB-0 with 100 mM NaPO<sub>4 </sub>adjusted to 455 mOsmol by adding NaCl. MSB broth and agar were used for the growth of strains under non-selective conditions. LB-0 agar was used when using selective antibiotics in transductions and transformations. Plates were solidified with 1.5% agar. LB-0 agar or MSB broth were supplemented as needed with ampicillin (100 &#x003bc;g/ml) or kanamycin (20 &#x003bc;g/ml). Antibiotics were added to LB-0 agar after cooling to 45 degrees Celsius.</p></sec><sec><title>Restoring <italic>msbB</italic><sup>+ </sup>genotype</title><p>In order to confirm that the observed CO<sub>2 </sub>sensitivity results simply from knocking out MsbB function, wild type <italic>msbB </italic>was expressed from the <italic>msbB </italic>promoter using plasmid pSM21 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>].

Master plates were made on either MSB or LB-0 agar. Replica plating was performed using a double velvet technique [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. Replica plates were incubated for 16 hours at 37&#x000b0;C. To generate growth curves, 3 ml broth tubes were inoculated with single colonies and grown on a shaker overnight at 37&#x000b0;C in air. Cells were diluted 1:1000 or 1:500 (&#x003b2;-gal strains) in LB broth. Cells were held on ice until all inoculations were completed. Triplicate cultures were then placed in a 37&#x000b0;C shaker with 250 rpm in air or 5% CO<sub>2</sub>. O.D.<sub>600</sub> was measured every 60 minutes and dilutions of bacteria were plated onto MSB or LB agar plates to calculate the number of colony forming units (CFU) per ml.</p></sec><sec><title>Microscopic Observation</title><p>Strains 14028, 14028 <italic>zwf</italic>, YS873 and YS873 <italic>zwf </italic>were grown for 6 hours, as described above for growth curves, at 200 RPM.

Cell morphology was observed with a Zeiss Axiovision microscope using differential interference contrast settings and DNA was detected via DAPI fluorescence. Fixed cells were incubated with 2 &#x003bc;g/ml DAPI for 10 minutes in the dark and aliquoted onto a 1% agarose pad.</p></sec><sec><title>Mutation Frequency Determination</title><p>A frozen stock of YS873 was streaked on MSB media and incubated overnight at 37&#x000b0;C to isolate individual clones.

A BioRad Gene Pulser was used for electroporation with the following settings: 2.5 kV, 1000 ohms and 25 &#x003bc;FD for transformation of YS1 and 1.7 kV, 186 ohms and 25 &#x003bc;FD were used for YS873, YS1646, and ATCC 14028 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Tn5 mutagenesis and mapping</title><p>A library of transposons in YS1646 was made using the EZ::TN &#x0003c;Kan-2&#x0003e; insertion kit from Epicentre (Madison, WI). Over 56,000 kanamycin resistant (KanR) clones of YS1646 were pooled. The pool was screened for mutation rate and auxotrophy for different biosynthetic pathways by replica plating onto minimal media and media containing various pools of amino acids and bases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. Following selection for CO<sub>2 </sub>resistance by plating dilutions to LB-Kan and incubating in 5% CO<sub>2</sub>, the colonies were again pooled and a P22 lysate was generated and transduced to a non-suppressed strain and purified for kanamycin resistance under non-CO<sub>2 </sub>conditions in order to separate spontaneous mutants from Tn<italic>5</italic>-based suppressors. Transposon-associated Tn<italic>5 </italic>insertions were identified by replica plating in air and CO<sub>2</sub>.

Primers for PCR were designed that would generate one product immediately upstream of the 5' ATG start codon and a separate product immediately downstream of the 3' stop codon of the <italic>zwf </italic>coding region. The two separate products could then be ligated sequentially into the pCVD442 vector. The primers were: <italic>zwf-</italic>5'-reverse: 5'-GTGTGAGCTCGTGGCTTCGCGCGCCAGCGG CGTTCCAGC-3' (with added <italic>Sac</italic>I), <italic>zwf</italic>-5'-forward: 5'-GTGTGCATGCGGGGGG CCATATAGGCCGGGGATTTAAATGTCATTCTCCTTAGTTAATCTCCTGG-3' (with added <italic>Sph</italic>I), <italic>zwf</italic>-3' reverse: 5'-GTGTGCATGCGGGGTTAATTAA GGGGGCGGCCGCATTTGCCACTCACTCTTAGGTGG-3', and <italic>zwf</italic>-3'-forward: 5'-GTGTGTCGACCCTCGCGCAGCGGCGCATCCGGATGC-3'). The primers also generate internal <italic>Not</italic>I, <italic>Pac</italic>I, <italic>Sph</italic>I, <italic>Sfi</italic>I, and <italic>Swa</italic>I in order to facilitate cloning of DNA fragments into the &#x00394;<italic>zwf </italic>for stable chromosomal integration without antibiotic resistance. This vector is referred to as pCVD442-&#x00394;<italic>zwf</italic>. The presence of the deletion, in Amp<sup>S </sup>Suc<sup>R </sup>colonies, was detected by PCR using the following primers:<italic>zwf</italic>-FL-forward: 5'-ATATTACTCCTGGCGACTGC-3' and <italic>zwf</italic>-FL-reverse: 5'-CGACAATACGCTGTGTTACG-3'. Wild type produces a 2,026 base pair product whereas the mutant produces a 608 base pair (bp) product, a difference of 1418 bp, which corresponds to the size of the <italic>zwf </italic>gene (1475 bp minus a 57 bp multiple cloning site that replaces the open reading frame).</p></sec><sec><title>&#x003b2;-galactosidase Assay</title><p>For &#x003b2;-galactosidase expression, <italic>lacZ </italic>was cloned into the high copy vector pSP72 (Promega) in <italic>E. coli</italic>, transformed into <italic>Salmonella </italic>strains (via restriction defective <italic>Salmonella </italic>strain YS501 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>], and screened for bright blue colonies on LB agar containing 40 &#x003bc;g/ml X-gal. <italic>lacZ </italic>was cloned from <italic>E. coli </italic>K-12 MG1655 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>] obtained from the Yale <italic>E. coli </italic>Genetic Stock Center (New Haven, CT) by PCR using the primers BGF1 5'-GATCGGATCCATGACCATGATTACGGATTCACTGGC-3' and BGR1 5'-GATCAAGCTTTTATTTTTGACACCAGACCAACTGG-3'. The PCR product was cut with <italic>Bam</italic>HI and <italic>Hind</italic>III and cloned into the plasmid pSP72 (Promega, Madison, WI) which had been cut with the same enzymes, transformed into DH5&#x003b1;, and selected for bright blue colonies on LB-amp plates containing 40 &#x003bc;g/ml X-gal. The plasmid was subsequently transformed to the restriction minus methylation plus strain YS501 before transforming other <italic>Salmonella </italic>strains. &#x003b2;-gal assays were performed according to the instructions for the Galacto-<italic>Star</italic>&#x02122; chemiluminescent reporter gene assay system (Applied Biosystems, Bedford, Massachusetts). Briefly, 1 ml of bacterial culture expressing &#x003b2;-gal from pSP72<italic>lacZ </italic>was pelleted at 13,000 &#x000d7; g for 5 min. Supernatants were filtered through a 0.2 &#x003bc;m syringe filter and then assayed immediately or frozen at -80&#x000b0;C until assayed with no further processing. Cell pellets were quickly freeze-thawed and suspended in 50 &#x003bc;l or 200 &#x003bc;l B-PER&#x02122; bacterial cell lysis reagent (Pierce Chemical) containing 10 mg/ml lysozyme (Sigma). Bacteria were allowed to lyse for 10&#x02013;20 min. at room temperature and were then placed on ice. All reagents and samples were allowed to adjust to room temperature before use. Filtered supernatants and bacterial lysates were diluted as needed in Galacto-<italic>Star</italic>&#x02122; Lysis Solution or assayed directly. &#x003b2;-gal standard curves were made by preparing recombinant &#x003b2;-gal (Sigma, 600 units/mg) to 4.3 mg/ml stock concentration in 1&#x000d7; PBS. The stock was diluted in Lysis Solution to prepare a standard curve of 100 ng/ml- 0.05 ng/ml in doubling dilutions. 20 &#x003bc;l of standard or sample was added to each well of a 96-well tissue culture plate. 100 &#x003bc;l of Galacto-<italic>Star</italic>&#x02122; Subtrate, diluted 1:50 in Reaction Buffer Diluent, was added to each well and the plate rotated gently to mix. The plate was incubated for 90 minutes at 25&#x000b0;C in the dark and then read for 1 second/well in an L-max&#x02122; plate luminometer (Molecular Devices). Sample light units/ml were compared to the standard curve and values converted to units &#x003b2;-gal/ml. Percent release of &#x003b2;-gal was determined by dividing units/ml supernatant by total units/ml (units/ml supernatant + units/ml pellet). All samples were assayed in triplicate.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>DB was responsible for the overall project concept and design.
