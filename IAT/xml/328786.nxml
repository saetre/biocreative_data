It has 2275 nucleotides distributed in 5 exons and 4 introns. The sequence of amino acids encoded in the exons corresponds exactly to that derived before from a cDNA. Only this one P2 gene in a family of approximately 9 members has introns and is expressed. There are two transcriptional start sites (adjacent cytidine residues) located in a tract of 10 pyrimidines flanked by GC-rich regions. The P2 gene, like other mammalian ribosomal protein genes, lacks a TATA box; however, it has at positions -30 to -27 the sequence TTTA which may be a degenerate TATA box and may serve the same function. The architecture of the P2 gene, and especially the structure of the promoter region, resembles that of other mammalian ribosomal protein genes. This suggests that the common features contribute to the coordinate regulation of their transcription and that the stoichiometry of P2 (it is present in 2 copies in the ribosome) is achieved by regulation of the translation of its mRNA.</p><sec><title>Images</title><fig id="F1"><graphic xlink:href="nar00098-0089-a" xlink:role="4898"/></fig><fig id="F2"><graphic xlink:href="nar00098-0089-b" xlink:role="4898"/></fig></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><supplementary-material content-type="scanned-pages"><graphic xlink:href="nar00098-0086.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="4895"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00098-0087.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="4896"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00098-0088.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="4897"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00098-0089.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="4898"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00098-0090.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="4899"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00098-0091.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="4900"/></supplementary-material></body></article>
