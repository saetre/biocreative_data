These proteins have been found to form two distinct complexes <italic>in vivo</italic>, Rad51B&#x02013;Rad51C&#x02013;Rad51D&#x02013;Xrcc2 (BCDX2) and Rad51C&#x02013;Xrcc3 (CX3). Based on the recent <italic>Pyrococcus furiosus</italic> Rad51 structure, we have used homology modeling to design deletion mutants of the Rad51 paralogs. The models of the human Rad51B, Rad51C, Xrcc3 and murine Rad51D (mRad51D) proteins reveal distinct N-terminal and C-terminal domains connected by a linker region. Using yeast two-hybrid and co-immunoprecipitation techniques, we have demonstrated that a fragment of Rad51B containing amino acid residues 1&#x02013;75 interacts with the C-terminus and linker of Rad51C, residues 79&#x02013;376, and this region of Rad51C also interacts with mRad51D and Xrcc3. We have also determined that the N-terminal domain of mRad51D, residues 4&#x02013;77, binds to Xrcc2 while the C-terminal domain of mRad51D, residues 77&#x02013;328, binds Rad51C. By this, we have identified the binding domains of the BCDX2 and CX3 complexes to further characterize the interaction of these proteins and propose a scheme for the three-dimensional architecture of the BCDX2 and CX3 paralog complexes.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Human Rad51, like its bacterial homolog, RecA, catalyzes the repair of DNA double-strand breaks through the process of homologous recombination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg925c1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg925c4">4</xref>). In higher eukaryotes, five proteins that share &#x0223c;25&#x00025; amino acid sequence identity with Rad51 have been identified. These Rad51 paralogs, Rad51B (Rad51L1), Rad51C (Rad51L2), Rad51D (Rad51L3), Xrcc2 and Xrcc3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg925c5">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg925c13">13</xref>), have presumably arisen through gene duplication and may have acquired new cellular functions distinct from Rad51. Embryonic lethality of knockout mice for Rad51B, Rad51D and Xrcc2 demonstrates that these proteins play an essential function in development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg925c14">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg925c16">16</xref>). It has also been demonstrated that these proteins are critical for genome stability as evidenced by the sensitivity of individual DT40 chicken B-cell knockout mutants and CHO mutants cell lines to ionizing radiation and DNA-damaging agents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg925c7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg925c10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg925c17">17</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg925c19">19</xref>).</p><p>Yeast two-hybrid experiments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg925c20">20</xref>) and co-immunoprecipitation have revealed heterologous interactions between the paralogs, and the following pair-wise complexes have been observed: Rad51B&#x02013;Rad51C (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg925c21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg925c22">22</xref>), Rad51C&#x02013;Rad51D (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg925c20">20</xref>), Rad51D&#x02013;Xrcc2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg925c23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg925c24">24</xref>), Rad51C&#x02013;Xrcc3 (CX3) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg925c25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg925c26">26</xref>). A larger quaternary complex, Rad51B&#x02013;Rad51C&#x02013;Rad51D&#x02013;XRCC2 (BCDX2), has also been identified <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg925c22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg925c25">25</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg925c27">27</xref>). In addition, these paralog complexes bind DNA and demonstrate weak ATPase activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg925c21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg925c24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg925c25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg925c28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg925c29">29</xref>). Evidence suggests that these paralog complexes may mediate the strand exchange activity of Rad51 during the process of homologous recombination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg925c21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg925c28">28</xref>). Furthermore, Rad51B has been shown to bind to Holliday junctions as well as to interact with histones <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg925c30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg925c31">31</xref>). Identification of the protein&#x02013;protein interactions underlying heterologous complex formation will further elucidate the biological function of the paralog proteins.</p><p>In order to determine the interacting regions between each paralog in the BCDX2 and CX3 complexes, deletion mutations can be designed based on knowledge of the monomeric structure of each paralog. As no three-dimensional structure has been solved for any individual paralog protein or complex, crystal structures of related proteins can be used as structural templates to build three-dimensional models of these proteins. An X-ray crystal structure of RecA from <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg925c32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg925c33">33</xref>), an NMR structure of the N-terminus of human Rad51(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg925c34">34</xref>), and an X-ray crystal structure of a C-terminal fragment of human Rad51 bound to a fragment of BRCA2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg925c35">35</xref>) are available in the Protein Data Bank (PDB) for use as structural templates. Previously, the RecA structure alone was used to create homology models of <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> Rad51 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg925c36">36</xref>) and human Xrcc3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg925c37">37</xref>), but these models are limited by low sequence identity of &#x0223c;15&#x00025; between RecA and Rad51 as well as a much shorter N-terminus in RecA as compared with Rad51 and some of its paralogs. Since the experimental structures described above are incomplete relative to the paralogs, the recent determination of the full-length <italic>Pyrococcus furiosus</italic> Rad51 (<italic>Pf</italic>Rad51) provides a more accurate structure for modeling the Rad51 paralogs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg925c38">38</xref>). The <italic>Pf</italic>Rad51 protein contains &#x0223c;45&#x00025; sequence identity with human Rad51 and between 18 and 28&#x00025; sequence identity with the paralogs. The <italic>Pf</italic>Rad51 crystal structure reveals a clear N-terminal domain separated by a &#x02018;linker&#x02019; region of approximately 17 residues from a large C-terminal domain.</p><p>We have used an advanced sequence analysis procedure, PSI-BLAST-ISS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg925c39">39</xref>), and comparative modeling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg925c40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg925c41">41</xref>) to generate three-dimensional structures of the Rad51 paralogs based on the <italic>Pf</italic>Rad51 crystal structure. We have used these structures to delineate the N-terminal, C-terminal and linker domains of the Rad51 paralogs for the generation of deletion mutants to use for domain mapping and analysis of complex binding.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Plasmid construction</title><p>Yeast two-hybrid plasmid constructs for full-length human Rad51B, Rad51C and Xrcc3 were the kind gift of Dr David Schild (Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory; Berkeley, CA). The full-length murine Rad51D cDNA construct was the kind gift of Dr Doug Pittman (Medical College of Ohio, Toledo, OH). The murine Rad51D sequence was used in these studies as it had optimal activity with Rad51C and Xrcc2 by yeast two-hybrid analysis. The mRad51D construct contains an N-terminal hemaglutinin tag and was cloned into the pGADT7 yeast two-hybrid vector using restriction sites EcoRI and BamHI. I.M.A.G.E. clone 5801996 containing the full-length cDNA for Xrcc2 was obtained from the I.M.A.G.E cDNA collection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg925c42">42</xref>), amplified by PCR with primers containing EcoRI and BamHI sequences, and subsequently cloned into the pGADT7 and pGBKT7 yeast two-hybrid vectors. Deletion constructs were made using the QuikChange mutagenesis kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) and verified by sequencing (Biotech Core, Mountain View, CA).</p></sec><sec><title>Yeast two-hybrid analysis</title><p>The Matchmaker yeast two-hybrid kit was used as per the manufacturer&#x02019;s instructions (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA). Briefly, the yeast strain AH109 was co-transformed with various combinations of the paralog proteins cloned into the DNA binding domain and activating domain vectors and plated on minimal media lacking leucine and tryptophan but containing 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl &#x003b1;-<sc>d</sc>-galactopyranoside (X-&#x003b1;-Gal; Sigma-Aldrich, St Louis, MO) which allowed for detection of protein&#x02013;protein interactions directly on the plate. In addition, transformed yeast were also plated on minimal media lacking leucine, tryptophan and histidine to select for positive protein&#x02013;protein interactions. To quantitate the interactions between any two protein combinations, liquid &#x003b2;-galactosidase assays were performed on co-transformed yeast colonies using <italic>O</italic>-nitrophenol-&#x003b2;-<sc>d</sc>-galactopyranoside (ONPG; Sigma-Aldrich) as a substrate as outlined in the yeast protocols handbook (Clontech). Briefly, 5 ml of yeast were grown overnight in minimal medium lacking leucine and tryptophan. Then, 2 ml of yeast were transferred to 50 ml conical tubes containing 8 ml of yeast extract, peptone and dextrose, supplemented with adenine (YPDA) medium and grown with shaking for 3 h. The optical density (OD) at 600 nm was determined for each sample. Three aliquots of 1.5 ml of each sample were dispensed into microcentrifuge tubes, i.e. the triplicates for each experiment. Cells were centrifuged for 2 min at 10 000 <italic>g</italic> and washed with 1 ml of Z buffer (16.1 g/l NaHPO<sub>4</sub>&#x000b7;7H<sub>2</sub>O, 5.5 g/l NaHPO<sub>4</sub>&#x000b7;H<sub>2</sub>O, 0.75 g/l KCl, 0.246 g/l MgSO<sub>4</sub>&#x000b7;7H<sub>2</sub>O). Cells were then resuspended in 100 &#x000b5;l of Z buffer and were subjected to three cycles of freeze&#x02013;thaw. To each tube, 700 &#x000b5;l of Z buffer plus Tris&#x0005b;2-carboxyethyl&#x0005d; phosphine, used as a reducing agent, and 160 &#x000b5;l of 4 mg/ml ONPG was added and the tubes were incubated at 30&#x000b0;C until a yellow color developed. The reaction was stopped by adding 400 &#x000b5;l of 1 M NaCO<sub>3</sub> and the samples were centrifuged at 14 000 <italic>g</italic> for 10 min. The OD of the samples was obtained at 420 nm and &#x003b2;-galactosidase units were calculated. All yeast two-hybrid assays were performed with constructs in both the GAL4 DNA binding and transcription activating domains to reduce the possibility of spurious data.</p></sec><sec><title>Baculovirus generation and infection</title><p>Baculovirus transfer vectors containing full-length and deletion constructs of Rad51B and Rad51C were created by PCR from the yeast two-hybrid vectors with primers to create AscI and FseI restriction enzyme sites on the inserts. Inserts were cloned into a modified pBacPAK9 vector (Clontech) containing an N-terminal His tag. Vectors were co-transfected with linearized baculoviral DNA (Baculogold; Pharmingen, San Diego, CA) into <italic>Sf</italic>21 cells and recombinant virus was generated, amplified three times, and tested for recombinant protein expression by SDS&#x02013;PAGE and western blot analysis. The cDNA containing Xrcc3 (a kind gift from Larry Thompson, LLNL) was amplified by PCR and cloned into the pFastBacHT vector (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) using BamHI and HindIII restriction enzyme sites. Baculovirus for His-tagged Xrcc3 was generated using the Bac-to-Bac&#x02122; system as per the manufacturer&#x02019;s instructions (Invitrogen).</p><p><italic>Sf</italic>21 cells were maintained in SFMII media (Invitrogen) at 28&#x000b0;C. To produce recombinant protein, 1.25 &#x000d7; 10<sup>6</sup> cells/ml were seeded into 96 deep-well plates at a total volume of 1.5 ml and aerated with magnetic balls using a Carousel Magnetic Levitation stirrer (V&#x00026;P Scientific, San Diego, CA). Cells were co-infected with virus encoding the His-tagged full-length protein or fragments of Rad51B or Rad51C along with the corresponding Glu-tagged partner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg925c22">22</xref>). The His-tagged Xrcc3 virus was also co-infected with a His-tagged Rad51C virus. Cells were harvested after 36&#x02013;44 h by centrifugation at 1000 <italic>g</italic> for 5 min. After centrifugation, the supernatant was removed, the cells were resuspended in hypotonic lysis buffer (20 mM Tris pH 7.5, 1 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 0.5&#x00025; NP-40 and protease inhibitors), incubated on ice for 10 min, vortexed for 30 s, and the extract was clarified by centrifugation at 14 000 <italic>g</italic> for 3 min. Extracts were then brought to 0.1 M NaCl prior to immunoprecipitation.</p></sec><sec><title>Immunoprecipitation and western blot analysis</title><p>Approximately 400 &#x000b5;g of His-tagged Rad51B or Rad51C protein was immunoprecipitated by incubation with anti-His antibody covalently linked to agarose beads (Sigma-Aldrich) for 1 h with rocking at 4&#x000b0;C. In the Rad51C&#x02013;Xrcc3 experiments, both proteins were His tagged and therefore immunoprecipitation was performed using an Xrcc3-specific antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA). Antibody-linked agarose beads and lysates were gently centrifuged at 1000 <italic>g</italic> for 2 min. Supernatant was removed and the beads were washed three times with 500 &#x000b5;l of cold lysis buffer. Immunoprecipitations performed with anti-His antibody-linked agarose beads were first eluted in 0.1 M imidazole. Samples were then resuspended in SDS&#x02013;PAGE loading dye, boiled for 5 min, centrifuged and the supernatant electrophoresed by SDS&#x02013;PAGE using precast 4&#x02013;20&#x00025; gels (Gradipore Inc., Hawthorne, NY). Gels were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF; Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA) and blotted in 5&#x00025; PBS milk with the appropriate antibody for 1 h. Anti-His monoclonal antibody (Sigma-Aldrich) was diluted 1:3000, while anti-His goat polyclonal antibody (Novus Biologicals, Littleton, CO) was used at 1:1000 dilution. Rad51B rabbit polyclonal antibody and Rad51C monoclonal antibody were used at 1:1000 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg925c22">22</xref>). Blots were then washed three times in 0.1&#x00025; TBS-Tween for 10 min. Secondary antibody bovine anti-goat, goat anti-mouse and goat anti-rabbit HRP were all diluted 1:3000 in PBS milk and then blots were washed three times in 0.1&#x00025; TBS-Tween and detected by enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Biosciences, Piscataway, NJ).</p></sec><sec><title>Computational modeling of the Rad51 paralogs</title><p>For homology modeling, sequence alignments were obtained using the PSI-BLAST-ISS procedure developed by C. Venclovas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg925c39">39</xref>). Briefly, two iterations of PSI-BLAST were performed using the non-redundant database (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg925c43">43</xref>) on each Rad51 paralog: human Rad51B, Rad51C, Xrcc2, Xrcc3 and mRad51D. Sequences that appeared with an expectation value less than 10<sup>&#x02013;40</sup> were selected and then further limited to sequences that had &#x0003c;60&#x00025; sequence identity to each other. The resulting list of sequences was then used to generate subsequent PSI-BLAST searches, each consisting of five rounds. The fifth round of PSI-BLAST was used to extract the resulting alignment of the target (Rad51 paralogs) and template (<italic>Pf</italic>Rad51) sequence using the SEALS package (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg925c44">44</xref>) combined with in-house Perl scripts (C. Venclovas). The variability in the alignment between the target and template was analyzed and the dominant alignment variant was used to generate three-dimensional models using Modeler 6.1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg925c45">45</xref>). In regions, however, where the alignment was ambiguous (no variation was dominant), secondary structure prediction using PSI-PRED was used to choose an alignment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg925c46">46</xref>). Secondary structure was also used to shift the alignment in places where the PSI-BLAST alignment would otherwise have produced a break in a predicted &#x003b1;-helix or &#x003b2;-strand. The crystal structure of the archaeal Rad51 protein from <italic>P.furiosus</italic> was used as the main template for model building, PDB accession code 1pzn (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg925c47">47</xref>). An insertion in Rad51C relative to <italic>Pf</italic>Rad51, residues 164&#x02013;212 &#x0005b;indicated by the lower red arrow in the Rad51C model shown in Fig. S1 (available as Supplementary Material at NAR Online)&#x0005d;, was modeled using the helicase domain of the gene 4 protein of bacteriophage T7, PDB accession code 1cr0 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg925c48">48</xref>), residues 76&#x02013;124. An insertion in Rad51B, residues 253&#x02013;311 (indicated by the green arrow in the Rad51B model shown in Fig. S1), was modeled based on PDB entry 1db3, residues 125&#x02013;181. This PDB structure was chosen from a list of proteins structurally related to RecA which had a similar length insertion as compared with human Rad51, identified through the Fold Classification based on Structure-Structure alignment of Proteins (FSSP) server (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg925c49">49</xref>). Other insertion regions were generated automatically by the Modeler program (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg925c45">45</xref>). The Sidechain Replacement with a Rotamer Library (SCWRL) program was used to build side chains in each model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg925c50">50</xref>). To assess the quality of the final models, ProsaII <italic>Z</italic>-scores (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg925c43">43</xref>) were calculated (see Results).</p></sec></sec><sec><title>RESULTS</title><p>In order to design deletion mutants for domain mapping of the BCDX2 and CX3 protein complexes, we derived homology models for the Rad51 paralogs from our sequence alignments and the <italic>P.furiosus</italic> Rad51 crystal structure. The <italic>Pf</italic>Rad51 protein contains &#x0223c;45&#x00025; sequence identity to human Rad51 and between 18 and 28&#x00025; sequence identity to the Rad51 paralogs; thus, a closer sequence identity is found between the paralogs and <italic>Pf</italic>Rad51 as compared with RecA, which has been previously used in modeling <italic>Sc</italic>Rad51 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg925c36">36</xref>) and Xrcc3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg925c37">37</xref>), making <italic>Pf</italic>Rad51 the most accurate structure that can thus far be used to model the Rad51 paralogs. The <italic>Pf</italic>Rad51 crystal structure reveals distinct N-terminal and C-terminal domains, separated by a &#x02018;linker&#x02019; region. Secondary structure prediction, sequence alignment and model building suggest that four of the paralogs, with the exception of Xrcc2, possess an N-terminal domain of some 60&#x02013;80 residues, similar to <italic>Pf</italic>Rad51. By way of contrast, RecA contains a single &#x003b1;-helix (approximately 20 residues) at its N-terminus compared with the four-helix bundle at the N-terminus of <italic>Pf</italic>Rad51. Thus, the <italic>Pf</italic>Rad51 structure provides a more complete template on which to model the Rad51 paralogs.</p><p>The sequence alignments of all the paralogs relative to <italic>Pf</italic>Rad51 and human Rad51 are given in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg925f1">1</xref>. These alignments were used to create models of the paralogs, all of which are shown in Figure S1 (available as Supplementary Material at NAR Online). Representative of all the models, the model for Rad51B is shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg925f2">2</xref>, and reveals the N- and C-terminal domains separated by a linker region, which ends just past residue 75 in Rad51B (circled in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg925f2">2</xref>). The models for the other paralogs are similar with subtle differences due to the insertion regions that are unique to a particular paralog and in Figure S1 are color coded by certainty of the alignment, red representing no variation in the alignment, green representing some variation, and blue representing an insertion region relative to the <italic>Pf</italic>Rad51 template (Fig. S1). ProsaII <italic>Z</italic>-scores for each model have been compared with the template <italic>Pf</italic>Rad51 structure in order to assess the overall quality of the models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg925c51">51</xref>). A ProsaII <italic>Z</italic>-score of a model that is within two to three units of its corresponding template&#x02019;s <italic>Z</italic>-score indicates a sound sequence alignment. The ProsaII score for the full-length <italic>Pf</italic>Rad51 crystal structure is &#x02013;10.5. The ProsaII scores for each model are as follows: Rad51B, &#x02013;9.6; Rad51C, &#x02013;8.2; mRad51D, &#x02013;8.4; and Xrcc3, &#x02013;8.2. Since Xrcc2 lacks an N-terminal &#x003b1;-helical bundle, its ProsaII score, &#x02013;6.6, is compared with that of <italic>Pf</italic>Rad51<sub>90&#x02013;349</sub>, which is &#x02013;9.2. Secondary structure assignment by the DSSP method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg925c52">52</xref>) for <italic>Pf</italic>Rad51 is shown above the sequence alignment in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg925f1">1</xref> and features four &#x003b1;-helices in the N-terminus and eight &#x003b1;-helices and 11 &#x003b2;-strands in the C-terminal region. The N-terminal region of human Rad51 has been shown to bind DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg925c34">34</xref>), whereas the C-terminal region contains the canonical Walker A and B boxes for hydrolysis of ATP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg925c53">53</xref>).</p><p>In order to identify which region of the Rad51B protein interacts with Rad51C, several deletion mutants of Rad51B were tested for binding against the full-length Rad51C protein by yeast two-hybrid analysis. As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg925f3">3</xref>A, the N-terminal fragments Rad51B<sub>1&#x02013;75</sub> and Rad51B<sub>1&#x02013;115</sub> bind to Rad51C while the complementary fragments Rad51B<sub>76&#x02013;350</sub> and Rad51B<sub>116&#x02013;350</sub> did not bind to Rad51C, nor did Rad51B<sub>1&#x02013;243</sub> and Rad51B<sub>243&#x02013;350</sub>. From the homology modeling, it seems likely that the larger N-terminal fragment Rad51B<sub>1&#x02013;243</sub> cannot produce a properly folded protein, invalidating the binding assay. The sequence alignment shows that Rad51B<sub>1&#x02013;243</sub> is truncated within the helix preceding strand 5, while Rad51B<sub>243&#x02013;350</sub> includes the eight residues preceding strand 5 to the end of the protein. A structure-based analysis using the model of Rad51B suggests that these fragments may result in misfolded proteins since a portion of the internal &#x003b2;-sheet is missing in both fragments. Inspection of the Rad51B model (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg925f2">2</xref>) clearly shows that the &#x003b2;-strands do not fold in a sequential numerical order 1&#x02013;2&#x02013;3&#x02013;4&#x02013;5&#x02013;6&#x02013;7&#x02013;8; instead the order is 8&#x02013;7&#x02013;6&#x02013;1&#x02013;5&#x02013;4&#x02013;2&#x02013;3 as in <italic>Pf</italic>Rad51. Therefore, if fragments Rad51B<sub>1&#x02013;243</sub> missing strands 5&#x02013;8 and Rad51B<sub>243&#x02013;350</sub> missing strands 1&#x02013;4 cannot produce a properly folded protein, then the yeast two-hybrid assay will not yield positive results. Furthermore, the smaller fragment Rad51B<sub>1&#x02013;60</sub> also did not bind to Rad51C, suggesting that residues 60&#x02013;75, the putative Rad51B linker region, are critical for the interaction of Rad51B with Rad51C. Surprisingly, even though the linker is present in Rad51B<sub>57&#x02013;350</sub>, this fragment did not bind to Rad51C, suggesting that residues 60&#x02013;75 may be functional only when attached to the N-terminal domain rather than the C-terminal domain of Rad51B.</p><p>Similarly, several deletion mutants of Rad51C were tested against the full-length Rad51B protein (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg925f3">3</xref>B). Of these, only the Rad51C<sub>79&#x02013;376</sub> was found to bind the full-length Rad51B protein and the reciprocal fragment Rad51C<sub>1&#x02013;79</sub> did not bind. Again, we hypothesize that removal of an internal &#x003b2;-strand of the Rad51C protein prevents the core &#x003b2;-sheet of the protein from properly folding, resulting in an apparent lack of binding activity. Indeed, fragments that do not contain a complete &#x003b2;-sheet Rad51C<sub>1&#x02013;246</sub>, Rad51C<sub>1&#x02013;145</sub>, Rad51C<sub>145&#x02013;376</sub> and Rad51C<sub>264&#x02013;376</sub> showed no binding activity (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg925f3">3</xref>B). In addition, fragments Rad51C<sub>1&#x02013;96</sub>, Rad51C<sub>96&#x02013;376</sub>, Rad51C<sub>1&#x02013;285</sub> and Rad51C<sub>285&#x02013;376</sub> did not show activity against Rad51B by the yeast two-hybrid assay (data not shown). The deletion mutants Rad51C<sub>1&#x02013;285</sub> and Rad51C<sub>285&#x02013;376</sub> were designed to dissect the &#x003b2;-sheet within the C-terminus of Rad51C to examine how much of this &#x003b2;-sheet must remain intact for the binding of Rad51C to Rad51B. Rad51C<sub>1&#x02013;285</sub> includes strands 1&#x02013;5, while Rad51C<sub>285&#x02013;376</sub> includes strands 6&#x02013;9 of Rad51C. Such a dissection would disrupt the hydrogen bonding between only one pair of &#x003b2;-strands. In contrast, the non-binding deletions at amino acid residues 145 and 246 of Rad51C would break the hydrogen bonds between two pairs of &#x003b2;-strands, potentially resulting in even greater instability within the protein core. Moreover, since no binding was observed for either Rad51C<sub>1&#x02013;285</sub> or Rad51C<sub>285&#x02013;376</sub> in the yeast two-hybrid assay, we infer that a complete &#x003b2;-sheet is important in maintaining the overall fold of the protein.</p><p>Additional deletion mutants Rad51C<sub>1&#x02013;96</sub> and Rad51C<sub>96&#x02013;376</sub> were designed to determine whether the linker region was essential for binding to Rad51B and so these fragments separate the putative linker from the C-terminal domain. Although neither the Rad51C<sub>1&#x02013;96</sub> nor the Rad51C<sub>96&#x02013;376</sub> fragment bound full-length Rad51B, we infer from the Rad51C<sub>79&#x02013;376</sub> fragment that binds Rad51B, that the linker region of Rad51C, residues 79&#x02013;96, must be present on the C-terminus of Rad51C for proper interaction with the Rad51B protein. Henceforth, use of the phrase &#x02018;C-terminal domain&#x02019; with respect to Rad51C will include this linker region (i.e. residues 79&#x02013;376).</p><p>The N- and C-terminal domain fragments of the Rad51B and Rad51C proteins that tested positive for binding to their respective full-length protein partner were tested for binding to one another in the yeast two-hybrid assay (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg925f3">3</xref>C). Only the N-terminal fragment Rad51B<sub>1&#x02013;75</sub> bound to the C-terminal fragment Rad51C<sub>79&#x02013;376</sub> with similar strength as compared with the binding of the Rad51B<sub>1&#x02013;75</sub> to the full-length Rad51C protein. Similarly, the Rad51C<sub>79&#x02013;376</sub> fragment bound to the Rad51B<sub>1&#x02013;75</sub> fragment with the same strength as with full-length Rad51B (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg925f3">3</xref>C). This result provides a clear demonstration of the N-terminal domain of Rad51B binding to the C-terminal domain of Rad51C.</p><p>To confirm these findings, the N- and C-terminal fragments of Rad51B and Rad51C were cloned into baculoviral constructs, expressed in insect cells, and tested for protein&#x02013;protein interactions by co-immunoprecipitation. A Glu-tagged Rad51C construct was co-infected with either full-length Rad51B or the Rad51B fragments, each of which contained an N-terminal His tag. Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg925f4">4</xref>A(I) shows that all of the Rad51B fragments were expressed in the co-infections. Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg925f4">4</xref>A(II) shows equal Rad51C expression in each co-infection with the Rad51B fragments. Immunoprecipitation using an anti-His antibody showed that only the full-length Rad51B or Rad51B<sub>1&#x02013;75</sub> (and not Rad51B<sub>76&#x02013;350</sub>) binds to Rad51C (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg925f4">4</xref>A, III). Insect cells infected with Rad51C alone did not immunoprecipitate the Glu-tagged Rad51C with the anti-His antibody which demonstrates the specificity of the anti-His antibody only for His-tagged proteins. In the reverse experiment, full-length, His-tagged Rad51C or His-tagged Rad51C N- and C-terminal fragments were co-expressed with Glu-tagged full-length Rad51B (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg925f4">4</xref>B, I and II). Using an anti-His antibody for immunoprecipitation of the Rad51C proteins, Rad51B co-precipitated only with full-length Rad51C or Rad51C<sub>79&#x02013;376</sub> (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg925f4">4</xref>B, III). The Glu&#x02013;Rad51B expressed alone was not immunoprecipitated with the anti-His antibody. Thus, the co-immunoprecipitation experiments confirmed the yeast two-hybrid results.</p><p>In order to map the interactions of the other paralog proteins known to bind to Rad51C, yeast two-hybrid analysis was again employed. The full-length Xrcc3 was tested against the N- and C-terminal fragments of the Rad51C protein. Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg925f5">5</xref>A demonstrates that Xrcc3 binds the C-terminal Rad51C<sub>79&#x02013;376</sub>, as does Rad51B, and Xrcc3 does not bind to the N-terminal fragment Rad51C<sub>1&#x02013;79</sub>. To confirm this interaction, baculovirus containing full-length Rad51C or Rad51C<sub>79&#x02013;376</sub> was co-infected with Xrcc3 recombinant baculovirus into <italic>Sf</italic>21 insect cells. For these experiments, all proteins incorporate an N-terminal His tag and all recombinant proteins were expressed (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg925f5">5</xref>B). Immunoprecipitation using an anti-Xrcc3 antibody showed that Xrcc3 binds to both the full-length Rad51C and Rad51C<sub>79&#x02013;376</sub> proteins (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg925f5">5</xref>C, lanes 1 and 2). As both the Xrcc3 and Rad51C proteins were His tagged, they were both visualized on the blot (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg925f5">5</xref>C, lanes 1 and 2). In addition, there was a small amount of Rad51C cross-reactivity with the Xrcc3 antibody in the immunoprecipitation (lane 3 in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg925f5">5</xref>C), but the interaction between Rad51C<sub>79&#x02013;376</sub> and Xrcc3 was clearly demonstrated as the specificity of the Rad51C fragment for Xrcc3 is shown in lane 2 and there is no cross-reactivity of this fragment with the Xrcc3 antibody (see lane 4).</p><p>Analysis of another Rad51C binding partner, Rad51D, yielded results similar to those with Rad51B and Xrcc3. The full-length mRad51D was tested against full-length Rad51C and the N- and C-terminal fragments of Rad51C by yeast two-hybrid analysis (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg925f6">6</xref>A). The murine Rad51D sequence was used in these studies as it had optimal activity with Rad51C and Xrcc2 as compared with human Rad51D. Like Rad51B and Xrcc3, mRad51D bound to the C-terminal fragment of Rad51C<sub>79&#x02013;376</sub> as well as full-length Rad51C while the N-terminal fragment Rad51C<sub>1&#x02013;79</sub> did not bind to mRad51D. In addition, when the N- and C-terminal fragments of mRad51D were designed based on our homology model for Rad51D and tested for binding to full-length Rad51C. The large C-terminal fragment mRad51D<sub>77&#x02013;328</sub> bound to Rad51C, and the N-terminal fragment mRad51D<sub>4&#x02013;77</sub> did not bind to Rad51C (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg925f6">6</xref>B). Finally, when the mRad51D fragments were tested against Xrcc2, the N-terminal fragment mRad51D<sub>4&#x02013;77</sub> bound Xrcc2 while the C-terminal fragment mRad51D<sub>77&#x02013;328</sub> did not bind to XRCC2 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg925f6">6</xref>C).</p></sec><sec><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>This study details the domain mapping of the BCDX2 and CX3 paralog protein complexes. Based on sequence homology to the <italic>P.furiosus</italic> Rad51 crystal structure, we have generated three-dimensional homology models for human Rad51B, Rad51C, Xrcc2, Xrcc3, and murine Rad51D. Based on these models, deletion mutants have been created to analyze the formation of the two major paralog protein complexes, BCDX2 and CX3.</p><p>Our models indicate the presence of an internal &#x003b2;-sheet within the C-terminus of the Rad51 paralog proteins, and the experiments here are consistent with the integrity of this sheet being critical to maintain that native protein fold. Since the order of the &#x003b2;-strands in space is not the same as their order in sequence, it is likely that fragments lacking any &#x003b2;-strand would fail to form the &#x003b2;-sheet resulting in a collapse of the protein core and misfolding of the protein. Consistently, Wong <italic>et al</italic>. found only a single fragment, out of five fragments tested, of the core domain of Rad51, i.e. Rad51<sub>98&#x02013;339</sub>, could bind to fragments of BRCA2 by yeast two-hybrid analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg925c54">54</xref>); and, as it happens, this Rad51<sub>98&#x02013;339</sub> fragment contains the entire internal &#x003b2;-sheet (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg925c54">54</xref>). There is additional evidence that the Rad51 paralogs (including Rad51) are particularly sensitive to deletions. A recent study of the binding of CX3 showed that only the first six amino acids could be removed from the N-terminus of Rad51C for detectable binding of RAD51C to Xrcc3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg925c37">37</xref>). A study by Dosanjh <italic>et al</italic>. also showed a truncated Rad51C protein containing amino acids 1&#x02013;135 was also unable to bind Xrcc3 or Rad51B by yeast two-hybrid analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg925c6">6</xref>).</p><p>Rad51C is central to both complexes and our results show that only the region of Rad51C containing residues 79&#x02013;376 can bind to its protein partners, Rad51B, mRad51D and Xrcc3, through its C-terminal domain and linker region. Both the RecA filament (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg925c33">33</xref>) and the <italic>Pf</italic>Rad51 homo-heptamer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg925c38">38</xref>) utilize a linker region for molecular interactions. Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg925f7">7</xref> illustrates a possible scheme for the binding of the paralog protein complexes, consistent with the experimental data presented here. In Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg925f7">7</xref>, Xrcc2 is depicted as having no N-terminal domain, consistent with our sequence alignment (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg925f1">1</xref>). We have shown that Rad51B<sub>1&#x02013;75</sub> and not Rad51B<sub>1&#x02013;60</sub> binds to Rad51C. These data suggest that this putative linker region connecting the N- and C-termini of Rad51B, residues 60&#x02013;75, may be critical for the interaction of the Rad51B and Rad51C proteins. Our results also demonstrate that the murine Rad51D<sub>4&#x02013;77</sub> fragment that also includes this linker region binds to full-length Xrcc2. A bold interpretation of our data would suggest that the BCDX2 complex is binding in the manner of the <italic>Pf</italic>Rad51 homo-heptamer or RecA filament where each paralog has developed a unique N-terminal linker that binds the C-terminal of its protein partner.</p><p>In the active deletion mutants of Rad51B and mRad51D, the linker region must be included with the N-terminus of both proteins. In the two binary complexes Rad51B&#x02013;Rad51C and mRad51D&#x02013;Xrcc2, only the N-termini and linker regions of Rad51B and mRad51D are required to bind to Rad51C and Xrcc2, respectively, as shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg925f7">7</xref>A. On the other hand, the fragment of Rad51C that binds to mRad51D contains the linker and C-terminal region suggesting the following two possibilities for the Rad51C&#x02013;mRad51D complex in our model: either Rad51C uses its linker region to bind to mRad51D (as shown in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg925f7">7</xref>A) in much the same way as the Rad51B&#x02013;Rad51C and mRad51D&#x02013;Xrcc2 complexes or the C-terminus of Rad51C binds to the C-terminus of mRad51D in a different manner from the <italic>Pf</italic>Rad51 homo-heptameric structure. The former hypothesis is supported by preliminary evidence that a point mutation (A87F, Miller,K.A. and Albala,J.S., unpublished results) in Rad51C abolishes binding of Rad51C to mRad51D but only partly disrupts the Rad51B&#x02013;Rad51C complex. Kurumizaka <italic>et al</italic>. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg925c37">37</xref>) showed that Xrcc3<sub>63&#x02013;346</sub> and not Xrcc3<sub>85&#x02013;346</sub> can bind to Rad51C. From these data, we infer that residues 63&#x02013;85 of Xrcc3, like residues 60&#x02013;75 of Rad51B, may be vital to the interaction with Rad51C. According to our model, residues 63&#x02013;85 of Xrcc3 constitute the linker region, but it is likely that the linker region of Xrcc3 is not sufficient for binding to Rad51C, as it was demonstrated that Phe249 (which is in the C-terminal region of Xrcc3) is a critical amino acid for CX3 binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg925c37">37</xref>). It remains to be determined which linker region of Rad51C or Xrcc3, or both, is involved in CX3 complex formation (see Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg925f7">7</xref>B and C).</p><p>Our results suggest that the linker regions in the Rad51 paralog proteins may be critical for protein&#x02013;protein interactions, and future characterization of these regions may help determine the exact points of contact between the proteins. Furthermore, <italic>in vivo</italic> examination of point mutations that alter complex formation will be useful in determining the importance of paralog complex formation in mediating Rad51 activity in DNA double-strand break repair.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>SUPPLEMENTARY MATERIAL</title><p>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg925f1">1</xref> is also available as a regular text file called Supplementary Material Figure S2 at NAR Online.</p><supplementary-material id="PMC_1" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>[Supplementary Material]</title></caption><media mimetype="text" mime-subtype="html" xlink:href="nar_32_1_169__index.html"/><media xlink:role="associated-file" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="nar_32_1_169__1.pdf"/><media xlink:role="associated-file" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="nar_32_1_169__2.pdf"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="display-objects"><title>Figures and Tables</title><fig id="gkg925f1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p> Sequence alignment of <italic>P.furiosus</italic> (Pf) and human (Hs) Rad51, Rad51B, Rad51C, <italic>murine</italic> (Mm) Rad51D, and human Xrcc2 and Xrcc3.
