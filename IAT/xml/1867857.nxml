Recently, nicotine administration has been shown to be a powerful inhibitor of a variety of innate immune responses, including LPS-induced toxaemia. This cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathway acts via the &#x003b1;7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (&#x003b1;7nAChR). Herein, we tested the potential protective effect of nicotine administration in a mouse model of renal I/R injury induced by bilateral clamping of kidney arteries. Renal function, tubular damages and inflammatory response were compared between control animals and mice receiving nicotine at the time of ischemia. Nicotine pretreatment protected mice from renal dysfunction in a dose-dependent manner and through the &#x003b1;7nAChR, as attested by the absence of protection in &#x003b1;7nAChR-deficient mice. Additionally, nicotine significantly reduced tubular damages, prevented neutrophil infiltration and decreased productions of the CXC-chemokine KC, TNF-&#x003b1; and the proinflammatory high-mobility group box 1 protein. Reduced tubular damage in nicotine pre-treated mice was associated with a decrease in tubular cell apoptosis and proliferative response as attested by the reduction of caspase-3 and Ki67 positive cells, respectively. All together, these data highlight that nicotine exerts a protective anti-inflammatory effect during kidney I/R through the cholinergic &#x003b1;7nAChR pathway. In addition, this could provide an opportunity to overcome the effect of surgical cholinergic denervation during kidney transplantation.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="8"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury is a major cause of acute renal failure occurring after hemorrhagic shock or major cardiovascular surgery <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000469-Gill1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>. Despite renal replacement therapies, I/R injury remains associated with a high morbidity and a mortality rate estimated between 40&#x02013;80&#x00025; for intensive care patients. In the context of renal transplantation, enhanced I/R injury is responsible for delayed graft function affecting the long-term transplant outcome <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000469-Joosten1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>. I/R is associated with a large number of pathophysiological alterations resulting eventually in the destruction of the renal tissue. I/R injury is considered as an inflammatory process originally triggered by tissue oxygen starvation, mitochondrial dysfunction and ATP depletion <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000469-Bonventre1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000469-Lieberthal1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>. Upon hypoxic injury, tubular epithelial cells (TECs) acquire a pro-inflammatory phenotype and start to release cytokines and chemokines. Early after reperfusion, a massive influx of neutrophils is observed in the damaged areas. These neutrophils exert a crucial role in the pathophysiology of I/R injury by the release of proteases and oxygen-derived radicals, amplifying renal injury <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000469-Leemans1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000469-Tracey1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>. In these conditions, TECs undergo necrosis and apoptosis. In turn, necrotic products activate innate immunity through Toll-like receptors (TLR) signalling pathways leading to an amplification of the inflammatory response.</p><p>Recently, a body of evidence demonstrated that innate immune responses can be efficiently regulated by vagus nerve, a concept referred as the cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathway <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000469-Metz1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000469-Tracey2">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>. This regulatory pathway acts in an &#x003b1;7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (&#x003b1;7nAChR)-dependent manner <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000469-Wang1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>. Acetylcholine, which is released by stimulated vagus nerve and nicotine, an &#x003b1;7nAChR agonist, suppress TNF-&#x003b1; production by LPS-stimulated macrophages. The anti-inflammatory properties of the cholinergic pathway have been also described in different in vivo models such as LPS-induced toxaemia, Schwartzman reaction, pancreatitis and peritonitis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000469-vanWesterloo1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000469-Wang2">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>. On the opposite, vagotomy or &#x003b1;7nAChR deficiency dramatically enhances the sensitivity to endotoxin. One mechanism by which the cholinergic pathway mediates its anti-inflammatory effects is by controlling the release of high-mobility group box 1 protein (HMGB1) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000469-Wang2">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>. A role for HMGB1 has been recently described in the context of liver I/R <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000469-Tsung1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000469-Izuishi1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>. Known as a late mediator of endotoxic shock, HMGB1 acts simultaneously as a chemoattractant and activator of immature dendritic cells through TLR-2, TLR-4 and the receptor of advanced glycation end products (RAGE) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000469-Yang1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000469-Yu1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>.

As expected, saline-treated animals rapidly worsened renal function after I/R, as attested by increased serum levels of creatinine.

Moreover, nicotine decreases CD44 expression on endothelial cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000469-Serobyan1">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref>, a molecule which is also involved in neutrophil recruitment as shown by mouse renal I/R experiments in which anti-CD44 treatment prevents neutrophil infiltration and I/R injury <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000469-Rouschop1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>. In contrast, we observed that nicotine does not interfere with renal macrophage infiltration (data not shown). It has been shown that nicotine-treated macrophages lose the ability to release proinflammatory cytokines, yet keep their capacity to produce IL-10 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000469-Ulloa1">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref>, therefore nicotine-treated residual macrophages could play a role in the post-reperfusion healing process. This hypothetical point remains to be investigated. In a comparable way to what was described for nicotine in the LPS-induced toxaemia, we also observed a down- regulation of renal levels of TNF-&#x003b1; after I/R. In parallel, HMGB1, another powerful proinflammatory factor, is up-regulated after renal I/R and down regulated by nicotine pretreatment as described in other experimental models <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000469-Ulloa1">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000469-Lotze1">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref>. HMGB-1 has been recently identified as a potent pro-inflammatory mediator in sepsis and hepatic I/R injury <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000469-Wang2">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000469-Tsung1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000469-Qin1">&#x0005b;25&#x0005d;</xref>. During severe inflammation, HMGB-1 is translocated from the nucleus into the cytoplasm and released actively by macrophages or passively by necrotic cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000469-Ulloa1">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000469-Lotze1">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref>. In a mouse model of sepsis, Tracey et al. showed that nicotine improves survival through the decrease of HMGB-1 released by activated macrophages still in an &#x003b1;7nAChR-dependent manner <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000469-Wang2">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>. During hepatic I/R, a high HMGB-1 level promotes hepatic injury by NF-&#x003ba;B activation through TLR-4 binding. It has been suggested that HMGB-1 acts as an &#x02018;alarmin&#x02019; and amplifies inflammatory response by binding TLR-4, TLR-2 and RAGE receptors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000469-Yang1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>. This leads to the maturation of dendritic cells which might be deleterious in transplantation because of the sensitization of transplant recipient T cells. Consistent with these observations, Leemans et al. observed that TLR-2 expressed on TECs is critically involved in renal I/R injury by promoting cytokine release, neutrophil infiltration and apoptosis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000469-Leemans1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>. The role played by TLR4 in this setting is still unknown.</p><p>TEC apoptosis is recurrent in renal I/R injury, and is considered as a proinflammatory event per se <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000469-Daemen1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>. In our study, TEC apoptosis was clearly diminished by nicotine pretreatment as well as the subsequent TEC proliferation. There are at least two reasons for this observation. First, this might result from a lesser inflammatory environment by nicotine-mediated suppression of both TNF-&#x003b1; and neutrophil infiltration. Second, nicotine has been described to have anti-apoptotic properties <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000469-Mai1">&#x0005b;26&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000469-Dasgupta1">&#x0005b;28&#x0005d;</xref>. In turn, a reduced number of apoptotic TECs could jam the inflammatory cascade. Indeed, apoptotic cells have been shown to enable HMGB-1 release by activated macrophages in a sepsis model <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000469-Qin1">&#x0005b;25&#x0005d;</xref>. Therefore, the HMGB-1 down regulation we observed in nicotine-treated animals could also be explained by a reduction of TEC apoptosis.</p><p>Chronic administration of nicotine has been described to be nephrotoxic in the rat <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000469-Sener1">&#x0005b;29&#x0005d;</xref>. Indeed, nicotine accumulates preferentially in the kidney, where it creates an imbalance between the release of lipid peroxidation products and the endogenous anti-oxidant activity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000469-Sener1">&#x0005b;29&#x0005d;</xref>. We also observed that oral administration of nicotine, started 4 days before the induction of renal ischemia up to the sacrifice, following the protocol of van Westerloo <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000469-vanWesterloo2">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref> increased renal dysfunction in our I/R model (data not shown). In contrast, administration of 0.5 mg/kg in one-shot, 30 minutes before renal ischemia, a dose similar to that used by others in sepsis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000469-Wang2">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>, was protective. Of note, the dose of 1 mg/kg in one-shot did not afford protection 3 days after I/R, suggesting a late toxic effect after reperfusion. Despite a narrow range between therapeutic and toxic doses, the clinical use of nicotine is considered as relatively safe <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000469-Thomas1">&#x0005b;30&#x0005d;</xref>. In this context, we also tested another nAChoR agonist, the 1,1-dimethyl-4-phenyl-L-pioperazinium-iodide (DMPP). In a liver I/R model, DMPP has been shown to significantly decrease plasma-ALT and cytokines 3 hours after reperfusion I/R but was ineffective 24 h of reperfusion <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000469-Crockett1">&#x0005b;31&#x0005d;</xref>. In our model, DMPP also protected from renal I/R injury but virtually no advantage was observed compared with nicotine (data not shown).</p><p>The absence of &#x003b1;7nAChoR abolished the protective effect of nicotine pretreatment. This observation is in line with others showing that the integrity of the cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathway requires the &#x003b1;7nAChoR expression. Whether nicotine-mediated protection results from a direct interaction with tubular epithelial cells or from an indirect effect on innate immune response or both, remains to be determined. This suggests that &#x003b1;7nAChoR-specific agonists could be useful for preventing acute renal failure in several clinical settings.</p><p>In summary, our data demonstrate that nicotine administration protects renal function and limits tubular damage after I/R through an &#x003b1;7nAChR-dependent regulation of innate immune response. This suggests that nicotinic agonists should be considered for the prevention of acute renal failure occurring in major cardiovascular surgery and renal transplantation.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank Laurent Depret, Kathy Maroye, Nathalie Mention, Christophe Notte and Philippe Horlait for the animal care, Fr&#x000e9;d&#x000e9;ric Paulart for technical assistance and G&#x000e9;raldine Faucheux for administrative work.</p></ack><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="pone.0000469-Gill1"><label>1</label><citation citation-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Gill</surname><given-names>N</given-names></name><name><surname>Nally</surname><given-names>JV</given-names><suffix>Jr</suffix></name><name><surname>Fatica</surname><given-names>RA</given-names></name></person-group><year>2005</year><article-title>Renal failure secondary to acute tubular necrosis: epidemiology, diagnosis, and management.</article-title><source>Chest</source><volume>128</volume><fpage>2847</fpage><lpage>2863</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">16236963</pub-id></citation></ref><ref id="pone.0000469-Joosten1"><label>2</label><citation citation-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Joosten</surname><given-names>SA</given-names></name><name><surname>Sijpkens</surname><given-names>YW</given-names></name><name><surname>van Kooten</surname><given-names>C</given-names></name><name><surname>Paul</surname><given-names>LC</given-names></name></person-group><year>2005</year><article-title>Chronic renal allograft rejection: pathophysiologic considerations.</article-title><source>Kidney Int</source><volume>68</volume><fpage>1</fpage><lpage>13</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">15954891</pub-id></citation></ref><ref id="pone.0000469-Bonventre1"><label>3</label><citation citation-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Bonventre</surname><given-names>JV</given-names></name><name><surname>Zuk</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name></person-group><year>2004</year><article-title>Ischemic acute renal failure: an inflammatory disease?</article-title><source>Kidney Int</source><volume>66</volume><fpage>480</fpage><lpage>485</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">15253693</pub-id></citation></ref><ref id="pone.0000469-Boros1"><label>4</label><citation citation-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Boros</surname><given-names>P</given-names></name><name><surname>Bromberg</surname><given-names>JS</given-names></name></person-group><year>2006</year><article-title>New cellular and molecular immune pathways in ischemia/reperfusion injury.</article-title><source>Am J Transplant</source><volume>6</volume><fpage>652</fpage><lpage>658</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">16539620</pub-id></citation></ref><ref id="pone.0000469-Lien1"><label>5</label><citation citation-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Lien</surname><given-names>YH</given-names></name><name><surname>Lai</surname><given-names>LW</given-names></name><name><surname>Silva</surname><given-names>AL</given-names></name></person-group><year>2003</year><article-title>Pathogenesis of renal ischemia/reperfusion injury: lessons from knockout mice.</article-title><source>Life Sci</source><volume>74</volume><fpage>543</fpage><lpage>552</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">14623025</pub-id></citation></ref><ref id="pone.0000469-Lieberthal1"><label>6</label><citation citation-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Lieberthal</surname><given-names>W</given-names></name><name><surname>Nigam</surname><given-names>SK</given-names></name></person-group><year>2000</year><article-title>Acute renal failure.
