Subsequently, inhibitory signals are engaged for turning off activating signals. We identified that regulator of calcineurin (Rcan) 1 serves as a negative regulator for turning off Fc&#x003b5;RI-mediated mast cell activation. Fc&#x003b5;RI-induced Rcan1 expression was identified by suppression subtractive hybridization and verified by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction and Western blotting. Deficiency of <italic>Rcan1</italic> led to increased calcineurin activity, increased nuclear factor of activated T cells and nuclear factor &#x003ba;B activation, increased cytokine production, and enhanced immunoglobulin E&#x02013;mediated late-phase cutaneous reactions. Forced expression of Rcan1 in wild-type or <italic>Rcan1</italic>-deficient mast cells reduced Fc&#x003b5;RI-mediated cytokine production. <italic>Rcan1</italic> deficiency also led to increased Fc&#x003b5;RI-mediated mast cell degranulation and enhanced passive cutaneous anaphylaxis. Analysis of the <italic>Rcan1</italic> promoter identified a functional Egr1 binding site. Biochemical and genetic evidence suggested that Egr1 controls Rcan1 expression. Our results identified Rcan1 as a novel inhibitory signal in Fc&#x003b5;RI-induced mast cell activation and established a new link of Egr1 and Rcan1 in Fc&#x003b5;RI signaling.</p></abstract></article-meta><notes><fn-group><fn><p>Abbreviations used: BMMC, bone marrow&#x02013;derived mast cell; ChIP, chromatin immunoprecipitation; DNFB, dinitrofluorobenzene; JNK, c-Jun N-terminal kinase; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; PI3K, phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase; Rcan, regulator of calcineurin; SSH, suppression subtractive hybridization.</p></fn></fn-group></notes></front><body><p>Mast cells play a central role in IgE-dependent allergic diseases. Recently, mast cells have also been recognized as prominent immune effector cells. Mast cells constitutively express the high affinity IgE receptor (Fc&#x003b5;RI) on their surface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">1</xref>). Aggregation of Fc&#x003b5;RI initiates a cascade of activating signaling events leading to the production of mast cell mediators. Activation signals are needed for the production and secretion of proinflammatory mediators. Activation signals are subsequently inhibited by negative signals that are required for mast cells to return to their basal resting condition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">2</xref>). Thus, Fc&#x003b5;RI-mediated activation and subsequent inhibition are highly ordered, sequential molecular events. The nature of this negative signaling event after Fc&#x003b5;RI-mediated mast cell activation is the subject of this study.</p><p>Fc&#x003b5;RI consists of an IgE-binding &#x003b1; subunit, a signal-amplifying &#x003b2; subunit, and two signal-initiating &#x003b3; subunits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">3</xref>). Fc&#x003b5;RI-mediated activation events have been extensively studied. The widely accepted model is as follows: upon cross-linking of the Fc&#x003b5;RI, the Src family protein tyrosine kinases Lyn and Fyn are activated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">5</xref>). Lyn phosphorylates tyrosine residues of the immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif in the &#x003b2; and &#x003b3; subunits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">4</xref>). Syk is then recruited to the &#x003b3; subunit and activates a multitude of protein kinases. Fyn functions to phosphorylate Gab2, which is involved in Fc&#x003b5;RI-induced activation of phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase (PI3K) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">5</xref>). Concerted actions of Lyn and Fyn activate several signaling pathways, including I&#x003ba;B&#x02013;NF-&#x003ba;B, NFAT, mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs), and PI3K&#x02013;Akt, leading to mast cell degranulation and production of inflammatory cytokines and lipid mediators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">3</xref>). Most of these signal events are enzymatic reactions and occur within seconds to minutes.</p><p>In addition to the immediate enzymatic activation of protein kinases, we recently demonstrated that <italic>Egr1</italic>-deficient mast cells showed impaired Fc&#x003b5;RI-induced TNF and IL-13 production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">6</xref>). The de novo synthesis of the transcription factor Egr1 is required for the full responsiveness of mast cells in the production of cytokines in response to IgE stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">6</xref>). The promoter region of inflammatory cytokines such as TNF contains multiple transcription factor binding sites, including those for NF-&#x003ba;B, NFAT, and Egr1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">8</xref>). Accordingly, the coordinated action of immediate enzymatic activation together with newly synthesized transcription factor Egr1 contributes to the magnitude of mast cell activation. As Fc&#x003b5;RI aggregation&#x02013;induced Egr1 expression occurs from 15 min to 1 h after antigen stimulation, it appears that Egr1 contributes to the later phase of Fc&#x003b5;RI-mediated signals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">6</xref>). Intriguingly, an opposing biological effect of Egr1, both the stimulatory and inhibitory effects on gene expression, has been reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">11</xref>). Such dual effects suggest that Egr1 may initiate both activation and inhibition signals.</p><p>Transcription factors NFAT and NF-&#x003ba;B regulate the transcription of multiple cytokines in mast cells. These transcription factors are sequestered in the cytoplasm under resting conditions and translocate to the nucleus upon Fc&#x003b5;RI activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">13</xref>). Calcineurin is capable of regulating NFAT and NF-&#x003ba;B nuclear translocation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">15</xref>). Blocking the calcineurin&#x02013;NFAT pathway by using pharmaceutical molecules has been shown to be an effective means for treating allergic inflammation, highlighting the importance of this pathway in allergy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">16</xref>).</p><p>A new family of regulators of calcineurin (Rcans), including Rcan1, Rcan2, and Rcan3, has been shown to modulate calcineurin activity under physiological and pathological conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">17</xref>). In this study, we identified Rcan1 as an endogenous negative regulator in Fc&#x003b5;RI-mediated signaling. <italic>Rcan1</italic> deficiency had few effects on the early phase (5&#x02013;20 min) of Fc&#x003b5;RI-induced NFAT and I&#x003ba;B activation but strongly enhanced the late-phase Fc&#x003b5;RI-mediated NFAT activation (3&#x02013;6 h) and I&#x003ba;B phosphorylation (1 h), leading to increased cytokine production in vitro and enhanced late-phase cutaneous allergic reaction in vivo. <italic>Rcan1</italic> deficiency also showed increased Fc&#x003b5;RI-mediated mast cell degranulation in vitro and increased passive cutaneous anaphylaxis in vivo. Accordingly, Rcan1 is a novel negative regulator in Fc&#x003b5;RI-induced mast cell activation. In addition, biochemical and genetic analyses revealed a new link between Egr1 and Rcan1 in Fc&#x003b5;RI-mediated signaling.</p><sec><title>RESULTS</title><sec><title>Fc&#x003b5;RI aggregation induces Rcan1 expression</title><p>Suppression subtractive hybridization (SSH) allows us to identify target genes even without a prerequisite knowledge of these genes. SSH was used to identify genes that are differentially expressed in Fc&#x003b5;RI-activated mast cells. Total RNA from TNP-BSA&#x02013;treated or untreated mouse bone marrow&#x02013;derived mast cells (BMMCs) were used to generate double-stranded cDNAs. A subtracted cDNA library was constructed to enrich the transcripts that were differentially expressed by mast cells after TNP-BSA stimulation. The subtraction efficiency was evaluated by comparing GAPDH cDNA levels by PCR in serial dilutions of subtracted and nonsubtracted control cDNA (Fig. S1, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20081140/DC1">http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20081140/DC1</ext-link>). The PCR products of the subtraction were cloned and sequenced after a differential hybridization procedure to exclude false positives. Surprisingly, among 33 positive clones sequenced, 8 clones matched the <italic>Rcan1</italic> gene (exons 4, 5, 6, and 7), suggesting the abundance of this gene product in Fc&#x003b5;RI-activated mast cells (Table S1 and Fig. S2). One clone matched the <italic>Egr1</italic> gene (Table S1). Reverse Northern blot analysis using one of the identified Rcan1 clones (2C3) as a probe confirmed the increased expression of Rcan1 in the TNP-BSA&#x02013;stimulated sample (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 A</xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="fig1"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p><bold>IgE-dependent Rcan1 expression by mast cells.</bold> (A) RNAs from TNP-BSA&#x02013;treated (TNP) and untreated (NT) mouse BMMCs were reversed transcribed into cDNA and blotted with a GAPGH probe or a Rcan1 probe obtained from clone 2C3 in the SSH assay. A representative Northern blot from two independent experiments is shown. (B and C) BMMCs were sensitized with anti-TNP IgE and stimulated with 10 ng/ml TNP-BSA for 15, 30, 60, or 180 min. RNA isolated from these cells was reverse transcribed to cDNA and subjected to real-time quantitative PCR. Rcan1 expression was normalized to endogenous control GAPDH. The data are expressed as relative mRNA levels compared with the mean expression level in BMMCs treated with TNP-BSA for 60 min (&#x0003d;1), because at this time point Rcan1 showed the highest expression level. The PCR products were also separated by agarose gel and stained with ethidium bromide. Untreated BMMCs (NT) showed no Rcan1 expression, whereas TNP induced a strong Rcan1 expression. Error bars represent SEs from three independent experiments. (D) IgE-sensitized BMMCs were treated with TNP-BSA for 2, 4, or 6 h. Cell lysates were analyzed by Western blotting for Rcan1. TNP-induced Rcan1 expression was observed in wild-type BMMCs (Rcan1<sup>&#x0002b;/&#x0002b;</sup>). Lysate from Rcan1-deficient BMMCs (Rcan1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup>) after TNP treatment (2 h) was used as a control. Membrane was stripped and probed for actin as a loading control.

Given that the expression of any <italic>Rcan</italic> family members by mast cells has not been reported previously, we also examined Rcan2 and Rcan3. Two Rcan1 isoforms have been reported, the isoform Rcan1-4 encoded by exons 4, 5, 6, and 7, and the isoform Rcan1-1 encoded by exons 1, 5, 6, and 7 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">17</xref>). Total RNA was isolated from TNP-BSA&#x02013;treated mouse BMMCs and analyzed by real-time quantitative PCR for two Rcan1 isoforms, as well as for Rcan2 and Rcan3. Levels of Rcan mRNA expression were normalized to GAPDH in each sample. Rcan1-1 and Rcan3 showed low levels of expression under resting conditions, whereas Rcan2 was undetectable in both resting and activated cells (unpublished data). Among these Rcan family members tested, Rcan1-4 was the only member found to be up-regulated by TNP-BSA stimulation. The Rcan1-4 level in the unstimulated mast cells was undetectable. Rcan1-4 expression peaked at 60 min after TNP-BSA stimulation (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 B</xref>). PCR-amplified <italic>Rcan1</italic> products (Rcan1-4) were also separated in agarose gels and visualized by ethidium bromide staining. A representative gel is presented in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 C</xref>. Strong Rcan1-4 expression can be seen at 60 min after TNP-BSA stimulation.</p><p>To determine Rcan1 expression at the protein level, IgE-sensitized mast cells were treated with TNP-BSA for various times and subjected to Western blot analysis.

Bone marrow cells from <italic>Rcan1</italic>-deficient and wild-type mice were cultured in conditioned medium and were analyzed by flow cytometry for c-kit and IgE receptor expression. No difference of the c-kit and IgE receptor expression after 5 wk of culture was observed between wild-type and <italic>Rcan1</italic>-deficient cells (Fig. S3 A, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20081140/DC1">http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20081140/DC1</ext-link>). BMMCs were also used for Toluidine blue staining. Morphologically, no difference was observed between <italic>Rcan1</italic>-deficient and wild-type mast cells (Fig. S3 B). This result suggests that mast cells mature normally in the absence of Rcan1.</p></sec><sec><title>Increased activation of NFAT and NF-&#x003ba;B pathways but not MAPKs in <italic>Rcan1</italic>-deficient BMMCs</title><p>To determine the specific signaling pathways regulated by Rcan1 in Fc&#x003b5;RI-mediated mast cell activation, we examined activation of NFAT, NF-&#x003ba;B, and MAPK pathways in <italic>Rcan1</italic>-deficient BMMCs. For the study of NFAT pathway activation, an NFAT luciferase assay, EMSA, and an immunofluorescence assay were used. <italic>Rcan1</italic>-deficient and wild-type BMMCs were transfected with NFAT luciferase plasmid. Cells were then sensitized with anti-TNP IgE and activated with TNP-BSA for 18 h. A significant increase in NFAT luciferase activity was seen in <italic>Rcan1</italic>-deficient BMMCs after TNP-BSA stimulation compared with that in wild-type BMMCs (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 A</xref>).

Interestingly, the early events of I&#x003ba;B phosphorylation and degradation at 5 and 20 min were not affected by <italic>Rcan1</italic> deficiency. In contrast, phosphorylation at the later time point (60 min) was significantly enhanced in <italic>Rcan1</italic>-deficient BMMCs (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 B</xref>).

Accordingly, we tested whether Rcan1 affects Fc&#x003b5;RI-mediated JNK and p38 signaling. Cell lysates from TNP-stimulated BMMCs were subjected to Western blotting for phospho-JNK, phospho-p38, and their total proteins. As shown in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 C</xref>, TNP stimulation induced an increase of p38 phosphorylation (5 min) and JNK phosphorylation (20 min). Subsequently, levels of p38 and JNK phosphorylation returned to basal conditions (180&#x02013;360 min). Similar patterns of TNP-induced phosphorylation (the increase in the early phase and decrease in the late phase) of p38 and JNK were observed for <italic>Rcan1</italic>-deficient and wild-type mast cells. These data suggest that Rcan1 is not required for Fc&#x003b5;RI-mediated MAPK activation and inactivation processes.

Similarly, no difference in the Akt phosphorylation pattern was observed between <italic>Rcan1</italic>-deficient and wild-type BMMCs (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 C</xref>).

IL-6, IL-13, and TNF production in cell-free supernatants was determined by ELISA.

Notably, we found that an Fc&#x003b5;RI aggregation&#x02013;induced activation signal initiates de novo synthesis of Rcan1. Rcan1 was identified as a negative regulator, required for turning off Fc&#x003b5;RI-activated signals. Fc&#x003b5;RI-mediated Rcan1 inhibits calcineurin activity, which leads to down-regulation of NFAT and NF-&#x003ba;B activation, and subsequent cytokine production and inhibition of late-phase allergic reactions. Moreover, Rcan1 is also required for the negative regulation of mast cell degranulation and acute passive cutaneous anaphylaxis. Thus, both the preformed mediator release and the production of newly synthesized cytokines are negatively regulated by Rcan1.</p><p>It is noteworthy that Rcan1 selectively regulated Fc&#x003b5;RI-mediated NFAT and NF-&#x003ba;B pathway but not MAPK and Akt activation. The activity of NFAT is regulated by its phosphorylation state, which is controlled by the opposing action of the serine/threonine phosphatase, calcineurin, and the serine/threonine kinase, glycogen synthase kinase 3 &#x003b2;. Under resting conditions, NFAT is phosphorylated and localized in the cytoplasm. Upon stimulation, it is dephosphorylated by calcineurin and translocates to the nucleus. Studies have indicated that Rcan1 can bind to and inhibit calcineurin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">24</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">26</xref>). Thus, it is possible that Fc&#x003b5;RI-induced Rcan1 blocks NFAT activation through inhibition of calcineurin. Consistent with this model, we found that calcineurin activity was increased in <italic>Rcan1</italic>-deficient mast cells. Various pharmaceutical molecules targeting the calcineurin&#x02013;NFAT pathway have successfully been used for the treatment of allergic inflammation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">16</xref>). This highlights the importance of the NFAT pathway in allergic diseases.</p><p>In addition to NFAT activation, we also found that Fc&#x003b5;RI-induced I&#x003ba;B phosphorylation and NF-&#x003ba;B activity were enhanced in <italic>Rcan1</italic>-deficient mast cells. Rcan1 is able to regulate the NF-&#x003ba;B pathway through direct interaction with NF-&#x003ba;B&#x02013;inducing kinase or I&#x003ba;B (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">28</xref>). In addition, calcineurin can dephosphorylate I&#x003ba;B, leading to the subsequent nuclear translocation of NF-&#x003ba;B (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">15</xref>). Thus, Rcan1 could also indirectly regulate the NF-&#x003ba;B pathway through calcineurin. Enhanced Fc&#x003b5;RI-induced I&#x003ba;B&#x02013;NF-&#x003ba;B pathway activation in <italic>Rcan1</italic>-deficient mast cells likely contributes to the increased cytokine production and enhanced late-phase cutaneous allergic reactions.</p><p>Fc&#x003b5;RI-mediated mast cell production of cytokines such as IL-6, IL-13, and TNF may be beneficial or harmful in the setting of innate or allergic responses. Efficient production of mast cell mediators would be beneficial for the effective development of host defenses, whereas overproduction of mast cell mediators could be harmful. Accordingly, a temporal regulatory mechanism is necessary that allows the initial Fc&#x003b5;RI-mediated signaling to proceed in the early phase and permits the termination of the activated signal subsequently in a timely manner. We found that the new synthesis of Rcan1 was dependent on Egr1, which is synthesized de novo after Fc&#x003b5;RI stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">6</xref>). These data suggest that activation signals, including Egr1, proceed to initiate inflammatory cytokine expression, but subsequently Rcan1 is induced, which serves as a negative regulator to inhibit Fc&#x003b5;RI-mediated signals by inhibiting calcineurin activity. The new link of Egr1 and Rcan1 may represent a transition from activation to inhibition in Fc&#x003b5;RI signaling.</p><p><italic>Rcan1</italic> deficiency not only up-regulates cytokine production, it also enhances IgE-dependent mast cell degranulation in vitro and passive cutaneous anaphylaxis in vivo. Calcineurin activity has been associated with mast cell exocytosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">29</xref>). Thus, it is possible that Rcan1 modulates IgE-dependent mast cell degranulation and passive cutaneous anaphylaxis through inhibiting calcineurin activity. However, a recent paper demonstrated that Rcan1 regulates vesicle exocytosis and fusion pore kinetics through novel unknown mechanisms other than calcineurin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">30</xref>). Indeed, Rcan1 also directly interacts with several additional targets other than calcineurin. These include Raf-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">31</xref>), 14-3-3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">32</xref>), and NF-&#x003ba;B&#x02013;inducing kinase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">28</xref>). All of these molecules have been directly or indirectly associated with exocytosis.</p><p><italic>RCAN1</italic> was first identified as an expressed sequence on a yeast artificial chromosome clone from human chromosome 21 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">33</xref>). The <italic>Rcan1</italic> gene consists of seven exons, of which exons 1&#x02013;4 can be alternatively transcribed to produce different mRNA isoforms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">17</xref>). Members of this new Rcan family also include Rcan2 and Rcan3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">17</xref>). The functional distinctions among these family members are unclear. It is interesting to note that the isoform of Rcan1-4, which is encoded by exons 4, 5, 6, and 7, was the only member to be up-regulated by Fc&#x003b5;RI aggregation. This result suggests that this isoform may be functionally distinct from the other family members.</p><p>Egr1 can be induced by a variety of stimuli such as sepsis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">34</xref>) and tissue injuries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">35</xref>). Rcan1 has also been associated with several diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">36</xref>). The link between Egr1 and Rcan1 identified in this study will offer unforeseen potential for the regulation of signaling in a wide range of Egr1- and Rcan1-associated physiological processes and human diseases.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec disp-level="3"><title>Animals.</title><p><italic>Rcan1</italic>-deficient mice were generated as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">18</xref>). <italic>Egr1</italic>-deficient mice and control C57BL/6NTac mice were purchased from Taconic.
