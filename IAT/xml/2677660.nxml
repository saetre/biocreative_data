Being part of the stress response, early increases of NE in sepsis sustain adverse systemic inflammatory responses. The intestine is an important source of NE release in the early stage of cecal ligation and puncture (CLP)-induced sepsis in rats, which then stimulates TNF-&#x003b1; production in Kupffer cells (KCs) through the activation of the &#x003b1;<sub>2</sub>-AR. It is important to know which of the three &#x003b1;<sub>2</sub>-AR subtypes (i.e., &#x003b1;<sub>2A</sub>, &#x003b1;<sub>2B</sub> or &#x003b1;<sub>2C</sub>) is responsible for the upregulation of TNF-&#x003b1; production. The aim of this study was to determine the contribution of &#x003b1;<sub>2A</sub>-AR in this process.</p></sec><sec><title>Methodology/Principal Findings</title><p>Adult male rats underwent CLP and KCs were isolated 2 h later. Gene expression of &#x003b1;<sub>2A</sub>-AR was determined. In additional experiments, cultured KCs were incubated with NE with or without BRL-44408 maleate, a specific &#x003b1;<sub>2A</sub>-AR antagonist, and intraportal infusion of NE for 2 h with or without BRL-44408 maleate was carried out in normal animals. Finally, the impact of &#x003b1;<sub>2A</sub>-AR activation by NE was investigated under inflammatory conditions (i.e., endotoxemia and CLP). Gene expression of the &#x003b1;<sub>2A</sub>-AR subtype was significantly upregulated after CLP. NE increased the release of TNF-&#x003b1; in cultured KCs, which was specifically inhibited by the &#x003b1;<sub>2A</sub>-AR antagonist BRL-44408. Equally, intraportal NE infusion increased TNF-&#x003b1; gene expression in KCs and plasma TNF-&#x003b1; which was also abrogated by co-administration of BRL-44408. NE also potentiated LPS-induced TNF-&#x003b1; release via the &#x003b1;<sub>2A</sub>-AR in vitro and in vivo. This potentiation of TNF-&#x003b1; release by NE was mediated through the &#x003b1;<sub>2A</sub>-AR coupled G&#x003b1;i protein and the activation of the p38 MAP kinase. Treatment of septic animals with BRL-44408 suppressed TNF-&#x003b1;, prevented multiple organ injury and significantly improved survival from 45&#x00025; to 75&#x00025;.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions/Significance</title><p>Our novel finding is that hyperresponsiveness to &#x003b1;<sub>2</sub>-AR stimulation observed in sepsis is primarily due to an increase in &#x003b1;<sub>2A</sub>-AR expression in KCs. This appears to be in part responsible for the increased proinflammatory response and ensuing organ injury in sepsis. These findings provide important feasibility information for further developing the &#x003b1;<sub>2A</sub>-AR antagonist as a new therapy for sepsis.</p></sec></abstract><counts><page-count count="9"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Sepsis and septic shock are complications and considered to be major causes of morbidity and mortality in patients with severe trauma, burns, or blood loss <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005504-Angus1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>.

The presence of &#x003b1;<sub>2</sub>-ARs on macrophages has been previously confirmed by receptor binding assays and <italic>in situ</italic> hybridization <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005504-Spengler1">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005504-Handy1">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref>. Studies by other groups have shown that TNF-&#x003b1; upregulation can be mediated by the stimulation of &#x003b1;<sub>2</sub>-ARs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005504-Bylund1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005504-Hasko1">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref>. Here we show that it is the &#x003b1;<sub>2A</sub>-AR that is upregulated in KCs leading to enhanced receptor binding and proinflammatory cytokine release in sepsis.</p><p>We have previously shown that TNF-&#x003b1; is significantly increased by incubation with NE (20 nM) for 4 h <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005504-Zhou1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>. Since KCs are a major source of proinflammatory cytokines <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005504-Koo1">&#x0005b;25&#x0005d;</xref>, intraportal infusion of NE appears to have a direct measurable effect on TNF-&#x003b1; release <italic>in vivo</italic>. Infusion of NE through the femoral vein may reduce active NE levels reaching the liver compared to direct intraportal injection. Hence, one may expect a diminished proinflammatory response of NE after systemic administration. We have shown however, that even after peripheral intravenous administration of NE, the LPS-induced TNF-&#x003b1; increase becomes dramatically potentiated through an &#x003b1;<sub>2A</sub>-AR-dependent pathway, possibly through the involvement of other tissue macrophages.</p><p>Adrenergic receptors are subdivided in to three major subtypes &#x003b1;<sub>1</sub>, &#x003b1;<sub>2</sub>, and &#x003b2;, which are then subdivided into &#x003b1;<sub>1A</sub>, &#x003b1;<sub>1B</sub>, and &#x003b1;<sub>1C</sub>, &#x003b1;<sub>2A</sub>, &#x003b1;<sub>2B</sub>, and &#x003b1;<sub>2C</sub> and &#x003b2;<sub>1</sub>, &#x003b2;<sub>2</sub>, and &#x003b2;<sub>3</sub>. Upon binding of &#x003b2;<sub>2</sub>-ARs for example, epinephrine and high doses of NE through increasing intracellular cAMP levels <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005504-Bergmann1">&#x0005b;26&#x0005d;</xref>. &#x003b1;<sub>2</sub>-adrenoceptors are G<sub>i</sub>- and G<sub>0</sub>-protein coupled receptors that decrease intracellular cAMP, open K<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> channels, and inhibit voltage gated Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> channels, all of which lead to hyperpolarization of neurons and activation of immune cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005504-Bergmann1">&#x0005b;26&#x0005d;</xref>. In the CNS, &#x003b1;<sub>2</sub>-adrenoceptors are predominantly presynaptic. They regulate the release of neurotransmitters through a negative feedback. Functional studies of the genetic receptor subtypes have linked the &#x003b1;<sub>2B</sub>-adrenoceptor to peripheral vasoconstriction and analgesic effects of N<sub>2</sub>O (nitrous oxide) and other anesthetic agents. The &#x003b1;<sub>2A</sub>-AR, either alone or with &#x003b1;<sub>2C</sub>-AR co-activation, is involved in the central inhibition of sympathetic activities, modulation of neurotransmitter release, sedation, and anti-epileptic effects. As we have shown here, the pro-inflammatory action of NE, mediated by the &#x003b1;<sub>2A</sub>-receptor subtype expressed on hepatic macrophages (i.e., KCs) can now be added to this list.</p><p>So far, however, we could find only one report regarding the &#x003b1;<sub>2</sub>-AR subtypes responsible for TNF-&#x003b1; upregulation in pulmonary inflammation and none in sepsis itself. In their work by Flierl <italic>et al.</italic>, the authors focused on the phagocyte-derived cathecholamines that boost inflammatory responses via the &#x003b1;<sub>2</sub>-AR <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005504-Flierl1">&#x0005b;27&#x0005d;</xref>. Although this report indicated similar increases in the &#x003b1;<sub>2A</sub>-AR subtype in alveolar macrophages and neutrophils after LPS-stimulation, the role of individual subtypes in the proinflammatory response was not addressed <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005504-Flierl1">&#x0005b;27&#x0005d;</xref>. In our study we have assessed the influence of these subtypes in hepatic macrophages, i.e., KCs. We have shown that the gene expression of &#x003b1;<sub>2A</sub>-AR has significantly increased 2 h after CLP, while no significant changes in &#x003b1;<sub>2B</sub> and &#x003b1;<sub>2C</sub>-AR could be observed. Kupffer cells stimulated with NE in combination with the &#x003b1;<sub>2A</sub>-AR inhibitor BRL-44408 maleate reduced TNF-&#x003b1; release, while the &#x003b1;<sub>2B</sub>-AR inhibitor imiloxan hydrochloride increased TNF-&#x003b1; levels (data not shown). The difference between those two receptor subtypes may lie in the intracellular signaling pathways. While all &#x003b1;<sub>2</sub>-ARs suppress intracellular cAMP levels through its G<sub>&#x003b1;i</sub> coupled protein, they also change intracellular calcium and potassium levels to a different degree, which may influence intricate signaling pathways and eventually cellular response. As opposed to <italic>in vivo</italic> findings that showed no differences, our <italic>in vitro</italic> results show that &#x003b1;<sub>2B</sub>-AR inhibition is able to inhibit TNF-&#x003b1; release from cultured KCs, which is further complicating the role of &#x003b1;<sub>2B</sub>-ARs in the inflammatory response. <italic>In vivo</italic>, intraportal administration of NE significantly increased serum and Kupffer cell levels of TNF-&#x003b1;, and only the &#x003b1;<sub>2A</sub>-AR specific antagonist, BRL-44408 could significantly reduce TNF-&#x003b1; plasma levels and Kupffer cell TNF-&#x003b1; release. Recent reports show that not only sympathetic mediators, but also the cholinergic pathways modulate the systemic inflammatory response. Thus TNF-&#x003b1; release can be reduced by increasing efferent vagus nerve activity and acetylcholine release <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005504-Borovikova1">&#x0005b;28&#x0005d;</xref>. In this regard, the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor &#x003b1;<sub>7</sub> subunit appears to be responsible for the inhibition of macrophage TNF-&#x003b1; release by acetylcholine <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005504-Wang6">&#x0005b;29&#x0005d;</xref>. The role of the &#x003b1;<sub>2A</sub>-AR in the regulation of vagus nerve activity is a possibility <italic>in vivo</italic>, but our <italic>in vitro</italic> results indicate that the TNF-&#x003b1; suppressive effect of BRL-44408 is independent of a parasympathetic influence. Our present work and others' studies also show that this tremendous activation of the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous system during sepsis is not only a result of these devastating conditions but also influences of inflammatory responses itself by regulating proinflammatory cytokines via adrenergic and cholinergic receptors.</p><p>&#x003b1;<sub>2A</sub>-ARs also have effects on the cardiovascular and nervous systems <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005504-Flugge1">&#x0005b;30&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005504-Willems1">&#x0005b;32&#x0005d;</xref>. Since changes in MAP and heart rates reflect the activity of both the cardiovascular and nervous systems, we monitored MAP and heart rates during BRL-44408 administration in normal rats. Our results indicate that intravenously infusion of BRL-44408 at the dose of 2.5 mg/kg BW had no measurable effects on the MAP and heart rate. In this regard, the beneficial effect of &#x003b1;<sub>2A</sub>-AR blockade in sepsis is unlikely due to its direct effects on the cardiovascular and nervous systems.</p><p>In summary, our results suggest that hyperresponsiveness to &#x003b1;<sub>2</sub>-AR stimulation observed in sepsis is primarily due to an increase in &#x003b1;<sub>2A</sub>-AR expression in KCs. This appears to be in-part responsible for the increased proinflammatory response and ensuing organ injury in sepsis. These findings provide important feasibility information for further developing the &#x003b1;<sub>2A</sub>-AR antagonist as a new therapy for sepsis.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="pone.0005504-Angus1"><label>1</label><citation citation-type="journal"><person-group
