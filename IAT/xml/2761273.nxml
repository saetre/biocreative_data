Whereas the antioxidative defense in the different subcellular compartments is known, the information on DNA repair in plant organelles is still scarce. Focusing on the occurrence of uracil in the DNA, the present work demonstrates that plant mitochondria possess a base excision repair (BER) pathway. <italic>In vitro</italic> and <italic>in organello</italic> incision assays of double-stranded oligodeoxyribonucleotides showed that mitochondria isolated from plant cells contain DNA glycosylase activity specific for uracil cleavage. A major proportion of the uracil&#x02013;DNA glycosylase (UDG) was associated with the membranes, in agreement with the current hypothesis that the DNA is replicated, proofread and repaired in inner membrane-bound nucleoids. Full repair, from uracil excision to thymidine insertion and religation, was obtained <italic>in organello</italic> following import of a uracil-containing DNA fragment into isolated plant mitochondria. Repair occurred through single nucleotide insertion, which points to short-patch BER. <italic>In vivo</italic> targeting and <italic>in vitro</italic> import of GFP fusions showed that the putative UDG encoded by the At3g18 630 locus might be the first enzyme of this mitochondrial pathway in <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic>.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Electrons escaping from the respiration and photosynthesis transport chains in mitochondria and chloroplasts, as well as exogenous sources like UV irradiation or environmental stresses, give rise to reactive oxygen species (ROS). These can damage the biomolecules in the cell, and especially the DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>). The mitochondrial and the chloroplast genomes are particularly threatened in this respect because they lie in close proximity to the ROS-generating electron transport chains. Cells have developed several lines of defense to counteract the deleterious effects of DNA oxidation. The first defense is to scavenge the ROS through enzymic pathways (e.g. peroxidases) or nonenzymic antioxidant compounds (e.g. ascorbate) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>). The second defense line is to fix the oxidative damage through one of the DNA repair pathways (e.g. base excision repair or BER, nucleotide excision repair or NER) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>). Genomic and functional investigations have characterized DNA repair in the plant nuclear compartment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>) but these pathways remain to be investigated in plant mitochondria and in chloroplasts.</p><p>Insufficient protection and/or absence of repair would be expected to lead to rapid sequence drift in plant mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) and chloroplast DNA (cpDNA), especially following accumulation of oxidative damage. Although there are occasional exceptions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>), genomic data show that on the contrary plant mtDNA and cpDNA coding sequences evolve very slowly, a striking difference versus animal or yeast mtDNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>). Thus, the data suggest that plant organelles possess very efficient antioxidant defenses and/or a strong ability to repair DNA lesions. Both plant mitochondria and chloroplasts have been shown to possess a number of enzymes involved in ROS scavenging, as well as nonenzymic antioxidant molecules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>). In contrast, there is very limited evidence documenting DNA repair pathways in plant organelles. Analysis of replication efficiencies in unirradiated and UV-irradiated <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> leaves suggested the existence of organelle DNA photorepair in plants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>). On the other hand, investigating nuclear control of mtDNA rearrangements in <italic>A. thaliana</italic> highlighted the <italic>Msh1</italic> gene encoding a homolog of the <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> mismatch repair and DNA recombination component MutS fused with a homing endonuclease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>). The Msh1 protein was shown to target to both mitochondria and chloroplasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>). Homologs of bacterial <italic>RecA</italic> also exist in plant organelles and appeared to be involved in mtDNA repair in the moss <italic>Physcomitrella patens</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>) or in surveillance of mitochondrial genome stability in <italic>A. thaliana</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>).</p><p>A major consequence of oxidative damage is the occurrence of uracil in the DNA, which can be due to two different processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>). The first one is the misincorporation of dUTP during DNA replication, despite the presence of dUTPase activities which hydrolyze dUTP in the dNTP pool (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>). The second possibility is the oxidative (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>) or enzymatic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>) deamination of cytosine <italic>in situ</italic>, leading to a C : G to T : A transversion during replication. Uracil&#x02013;DNA glycosylases (UDGs) are the initial enzymes in BER pathways repairing uracil in the DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>). Genomic analyses, combined with predictions of subcellular localization, identified a cluster of nuclear genes encoding putative mitochondrial DNA metabolizing enzymes in <italic>A. thaliana</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>). These included the At3g18630 locus (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.arabidopsis.org/">http://www.arabidopsis.org/</ext-link>) encoding a potential homolog of the human cytosolic and mitochondrial UDG provided by the <italic>UNG</italic> gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>). Starting from this indication, and in the absence of further data, we have investigated the potential of plant mitochondria to repair uracil in the DNA and thereby to prevent its often mutagenic consequences. Developing a combination of <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in organello</italic> approaches, we show that plant mitochondria eliminate uracil in the mtDNA through a short-patch BER mechanism. Organelle targeting analyses suggest that the UDG candidate encoded by the At3g18630 locus mediates the first step of this process.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Cell cultures</title><p><italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> cell suspensions, ecotype Columbia, line T87-C33 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>), were cultivated at 25&#x000b0;C in Gamborg B5 medium (Duchefa, Haarlem, The Netherlands) supplemented with 20 g/l sucrose and 1 mg/l 2,4 D, final pH 5.7.

In the BER mechanism, the abnormal base is cleaved off by a glycosylase and only the remaining abasic nucleotide (AP site for apurinic and apyrimidinic site) is eliminated by lyase and/or AP endonuclease activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>). During a NER process, a bulge forms at the level of the lesion in the DNA and a fragment carrying the damaged base is cut out by structure-specific endonucleases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>). We used double-stranded DNA oligonucleotides carrying a single uracil on one strand to characterize specific recognition and cleavage activities in plant mitochondrial enzymatic fractions. As mentioned above, uracil can form in the DNA upon oxidative deamination of cytosine or derive from misincorporation of dUTP during replication. We thus prepared two uracil-containing double-stranded DNA oligonucleotides. In the first one called Oug (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>), uracil was paired with guanine, i.e. the situation which occurs upon cytosine deamination in the DNA. In the second substrate called Oua (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>), uracil was paired with adenine, which was representative of dUTP incorporation into the DNA. These substrates were primarily aimed at characterizing putative mitochondrial UDG activity. However, UDGs are generally monofunctional enzymes that lack &#x003b2;-lyase activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>). They can remove the base but not cleave the phosphodiester chain. The resulting AP site must thus be further processed by an AP endonuclease.</p><p>To have the possibility to characterize independently the AP endonuclease activity, we also used a distinct AP site-containing oligonucleotide called Oap (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>). Another reason to test such a substrate was that AP sites should not be considered only as repair intermediates, as they can also form spontaneously or result directly from oxidation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>). Finally, an unmodified oligonucleotide called Onm was tested as a negative control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>). All oligonucleotides were double-stranded and 25-nt long. The strand carrying the modification was labeled at the 5&#x02032;-end with T4 polynucleotide kinase. Uracil was standing at position 13 in Oug and Oua, whereas the AP site was at position 12 in Oap. Specific cleavage at the level of the modified nucleotide was thus expected to yield labeled single-stranded oligonucleotides of 12 and 11 nucleotides, respectively, upon denaturing of the samples.</p><p>The four DNA substrates were used for single strand incision assays in the presence of enriched <italic>A. thaliana</italic> mitochondrial enzymatic extracts deprived of endogenous nucleic acids and small size compounds (see &#x02018;Materials and Methods&#x02019; section). Prior to extraction, mitochondria were protease-treated to eliminate contaminations from other subcellular compartments. The absence of significant cross-contaminations was assessed by western blot analyses (see &#x02018;Materials and Methods&#x02019; section and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkp606/DC1">Supplementary Figure 1</ext-link>). <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> mitochondrial enzymatic extracts efficiently promoted single-strand cleavage of Oug at the position of the uracil, as the corresponding shorter fragment appeared very rapidly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>A). The cut/uncut ratio increased with time to reach a plateau at about 50% after 1 h. Full cleavage was not obtained for these assays, which meant that either the UDG activity or the AP endonuclease activity was limiting. To distinguish between the two possibilities, the AP site-containing oligonucleotide Oap was tested in the same conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>B). As for Oug, the expected cleavage product appeared within minutes but in this case nearly full cleavage was reached after 2 h, implying that AP endonuclease activity was not limiting in our enriched enzymatic extracts.</p><p>To check the influence of the sequence context, we tested uracil removal from the DNA in the context of an U : A base pair, using the Oua substrate. The results were similar to those for Oug (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>, lane 2). To ensure that all observed cuts were enzyme-related, Oug, Oap and Oua were incubated in the same conditions in the absence of protein extract. Cleavage was never detected in such control assays (e.g. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>, lane 1). Conversely, the unmodified DNA substrate Onm was not cleaved by mitochondrial enzymatic extracts, confirming in turn that the observed cuts were specific for the modifications (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>, lane 4). Similar observations were made with Onm, Oug, Oua, Oap and enriched mitochondrial enzymatic extracts from potato (<italic>S. tuberosum</italic>) tubers (see <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkp606/DC1">Supplementary Figure 3</ext-link>).</p><p>In further assays, <italic>A. thaliana</italic> and <italic>S. tuberosum</italic> mitochondria were submitted to hypotonic swelling, so as to break the outer membrane. The resulting mitoplasts were separated from the outer membrane fraction on sucrose gradients, protease-treated and in turn used to prepare enriched enzymatic extracts. The absence of significant membrane contamination in these extracts was checked by western blot analyses (see &#x02018;Materials and Methods&#x02019; and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkp606/DC1">Supplementary Figure 2</ext-link>). Incision assays with the Oug and Oua DNA substrates showed that, although the efficiency was somehow lower with Oua, UDG activity in enriched mitoplast enzymatic extracts was comparable to that in extracts from intact mitochondria (see <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkp606/DC1">Supplementary Figure 4</ext-link>), confirming the presence of the activity inside the organelles.</p><p>In all cases, the cleaved 5&#x02032; fragment was that expected from removal of the single modified nucleotide. This suggested that the observed activities were part of a BER pathway, as a NER mechanism would have led to the excision of a small fragment and thus to the deletion of further nucleotides upstream of the damaged position.</p></sec><sec><title>The UDG and AP endonuclease activities are distributed between soluble and membrane fractions in plant mitochondria</title><p>To characterize the submitochondrial distribution, we analyzed the uracil-cleaving activity associated with the mitochondrial membrane fraction recovered after lysis and high speed centrifugation of protease-treated, isolated <italic>A. thaliana</italic> and <italic>S. tuberosum</italic> mitochondria. The soluble fraction from the same samples was tested in identical conditions in the presence of the Oug and Oua DNA substrates. Cleavage of the AP site-containing substrate Oap was also analyzed. The absence of significant cross-contamination between membrane and soluble fractions was checked by western blot analyses (see &#x02018;Materials and Methods&#x02019; section and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkp606/DC1">Supplementary Figure 2</ext-link>).</p><p>Incision assays with Oug and Oua established that the mitochondrial uracil cleavage activity was in part membrane-associated. Reaction kinetics spanning up to 4 h were run with the membrane and soluble fractions isolated from <italic>A. thaliana</italic> mitochondria and the results were quantified. The initial incision rate of Oug in the presence of the membrane fraction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>A) was actually about twice that measured with the soluble fraction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>B), although the reactions reached a similar final plateau between 80% and 90%. The incision kinetics of Oua obtained with the membrane and soluble fractions were very similar all along, ending with the same plateau at only about 45%. Strikingly, the initial incision rate of Oug was six times higher than that of Oua in the presence of the membrane fraction, whereas the ratio was about three with the soluble fraction. The results of these assays altogether imply that a uracil paired with a guanine, i.e. the product of DNA oxidation, is better cleaved by the putative mitochondrial UDG than a uracil paired with an adenine, which is normaly the consequence of uridine incorporation during DNA synthesis. It also seems that the membrane context further boosts the initial phase of the reaction. Similar conclusions could be drawn from parallel time course studies with submitochondrial fractions from <italic>S. tuberosum</italic>, although as a whole the activities detected were lower in that case. Previous studies identified a weak preference of the mammalian UDG encoded by the <italic>UNG</italic> gene for U : G mismatches over U : A base pairs, but the preference was sequence-dependent and not absolute (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>). <fig id="F3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><p>Plant mitochondrial UDG and AP endonuclease activities are partially membrane-bound. Double-stranded oligodeoxyribonucleotides Oug (triangles), Oua (squares) and Oap (lozenges), [<sup>32</sup>P]-labeled at the 5&#x02032;-end of the strand carrying the lesion, were incubated for increasing times in the presence of a membrane fraction (<bold>A</bold>) or a soluble fraction (<bold>B</bold>) from <italic>A. thaliana</italic> whole mitochondria. The samples were subsequently denatured and fractionated by electrophoresis on polyacrylamide gels in the presence of 7 M urea.

Bars indicate standard deviation.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="gkp606f3"/></fig></p><p>Time course analyses of Oap cleavage in the presence of the submitochondrial fractions showed that AP endonuclease activity was also associated with the mitochondrial membranes but detected a somehow unexpected discrepancy. The initial incision rate of Oap was up to ten times lower than that of Oug in the presence of the <italic>A. thaliana</italic> membrane fraction. The reaction then proceeded efficiently, reaching over 90% cleavage after 4 h, but the rate remained lower than that of Oug cleavage all along the kinetics (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>A). Moreover, incision of Oap with the soluble fraction started with a lag phase and remained low, ending at only about 15% after 4 h, i.e. way below the plateau levels of both Oug and Oua cleavage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>B). It thus appeared that the AP endonuclease activity did not match the UDG activity, although, as mentioned previously, UDGs usually lack a lyase activity and need the help of an AP endonuclease for phosphodiester chain incision. The Oap-cleaving activity was better balanced between the membrane fraction and the soluble fraction from <italic>S. tuberosum</italic> mitochondria, but again it did not match the UDG activity. This discrepancy was not detected in the above assays run with enriched enzymatic extracts because AP endonuclease was in large excess in such extracts, whereas UDG appeared to be limiting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>). Two hypotheses can be considered to account for these results. One can wonder whether the incision of Oug and Oua is more efficient because the UDG recruits the AP endonuclease, whereas the recognition of the naked AP site in Oap would be more difficult. On the other hand, it cannot be excluded that plant mitochondrial UDG uses an original cleaving mechanism, i.e. it possesses a lyase activity.</p></sec><sec><title>Plant mitochondria can carry out complete lesion repair in large uracil-containing DNA</title><p>The above experiments demonstrated that plant mitochondria possess enzymes able to excise uracil from the DNA and incise the phosphodiester chain.

A 920 bp uracil-containing DNA fragment (see &#x02018;Materials and Methods&#x02019; section for details) was prepared by PCR in the presence of different concentrations of dUTP, as it is known that Taq polymerase can insert an U in front of an A in the DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>). Prior to import assays, the presence of uracil in the amplified fragments was checked with a commercial uracil excision mix containing bacterial UDG and endonuclease IV (see &#x02018;Materials and Methods&#x02019; section). Samples were denatured before analysis on agarose gels. No significant cleavage was observed with PCR products U1 and U2 amplified with no dUTP in the reaction medium or in the presence of only 1 &#x000b5;M dUTP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>A). Incorporation of uracil became detectable with DNA U3 amplified in the presence of 10 &#x000b5;M dUTP. Further increasing the dUTP concentration in the PCR reaction to 0.1 and 1 mM led to DNAs U4 and U5, respectively, which upon treatment with the uracil excision mix showed full cleavage and a decreasing size distribution of the cleavage products (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>A). These patterns implied that in U4 and U5 all DNA molecules carried uracil, with a higher frequency in U5.

No incorporation of radioactivity was detected in U1, U2 and U3 which contained no uracil or only low uracil levels, but labeled U4 and U5 were indeed generated.

Label incorporation was always higher for U5 than for U4. These results perfectly matched the uracil content in the imported probes, as revealed earlier with the uracil excision mix (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>A).

Despite that, it has long been considered that organelles in general are unable to repair their DNA, based on the original discovery that mammalian mitochondria do not eliminate pyrimidine dimers generated by UV irradiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>). The alternative idea was that, due to their high polyploidy (some human oocytes can contain as much as 100 000 copies of the mtDNA), organelles would degrade and replace damaged molecules rather than repairing them. That mammalian and yeast mitochondria actually possess mechanisms to repair mtDNA damages other than pyrimidine dimers was mostly demonstrated from the late 1990s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>). Plant mitochondrial genetic systems present some fundamental differences to their animal counterparts. First, the pressure may seem less stringent on the very low-gene density of the 220&#x02013;740 kb plant mitochondrial genomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>) than on the compact and fully coding mammalian mtDNA of 16.5 kb (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>). Second, homologous recombination seems to be a rare event in mammalian mitochondria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>), whereas it shapes the plant mtDNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>). It was thus possible to speculate that dilution of the mutations in the vast non coding regions, recombination-based exchange between the multiple DNA copies and degradation of definitely damaged molecules would be sufficient to account for the integrity of the plant mitochondrial genome. The present work establishes that this is not the case. Our biochemical and functional approaches demonstrated the presence of a complete short-patch BER pathway in plant mitochondria for uracil repair. The observations we made can clearly not be explained by side effects of the organelle RNA editing mechanisms, as these involve no relevant activities. RNA editing in mitochondria of flowering plants is restricted to C to U changes likely to occur through deamination or transamination of the cytosine moiety. There is no removal of the base, no cleavage of the sugar-phosphate backbone, no nucleotide insertion [(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>) and references therein].</p><p>Our study also brings the first hints on the genetic basis of uracil repair in plant mitochondria. The human <italic>UNG</italic> gene encodes both a mitochondrial form (UNG1) and a nuclear form (UNG2) of UDG. These have a common catalytic domain, but different N-terminal sequences generated by alternative splicing, which provides UNG1 with a mitochondrial targeting sequence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>). The results of the targeting experiments that we present here suggest that, as proposed earlier on the basis of sequence comparisons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>), the At3g18630 gene provides the mitochondrial UDG in <italic>A. thaliana</italic>. Further transcript pattern characterization and protein targeting experiments will determine whether this gene accounts for both the nuclear and the mitochondrial UDG, for instance through a mechanism similar to that described for the human <italic>UNG</italic>.</p><p>Oligonucleotide duplexes previously enabled to characterize complete BER reactions supported by protein extracts from mammalian mitochondria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>). In our <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in organello</italic> studies, such substrates turned out to be too short to allow sequential recruitment of all the successive partners involved in the plant mitochondrial BER mechanisms. It seems likely in particular that they were unable to recruit the DNA polymerase. This may indicate significant differences between animal and plant mitochondrial BER proteins, especially in their interactions with each other and with the DNA substrate. Further fundamental differences seem to exist between the mammalian and plant mitochondrial mechanisms for uracil repair in the DNA. Whereas all our observations point to single nucleotide excision and reinsertion, i.e. short-patch BER, for the exchange of uridine for thymidine in plant mitochondria, repair of uracil can occur through both short- and long-patch BER in human mitochondria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>).</p><p>The mtDNA in yeast, mammalian or plant organelles is organized in discrete, membrane-associated protein&#x02013;DNA complexes called nucleoids [(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>) and references therein]. The data altogether suggest that mitochondrial nucleoids in eukaryotic cells are not only mtDNA compaction and segregation entities but also centers of mtDNA maintenance and expression. Stuart <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>) found that in mammalian mitochondria, the entire BER pathway, with the exception of AP endonuclease, is localized primarily in the membrane fraction. However, although they colocalize in the mitochondrial membrane, the different BER components do not seem to stably interact with each other and to build complete repair complexes in mitochondria, at least for the uracil repair pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>). Close colocalization would nevertheless enable efficient substrate handing over, avoiding exposure or release of sensitive and reactive repair intermediates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44 B45 B46">44&#x02013;46</xref>). In agreement with these data, the submitochondrial localization studies that we present show that also in plant mitochondria the major part of the UDG activity is associated with the membranes. On the other hand, further differences appear between the mammalian and plant mitochondrial BER systems. Whereas AP endonuclease is soluble in mammalian organelles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>), the AP site-incising activity is essentially membrane-bound in plant mitochondria.</p><p>The <italic>in organello</italic> import-repair assays presented here confirm that DNA taken up by plant mitochondria can engage into complex genetic processes in the organelles. This opens the possibility to investigate complete repair of DNA modifications other than uracil or of mismatches. Furthermore, it was previously established that DNA incorporated into mitochondria can undergo transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>). It will be interesting to import a damaged DNA fragment carrying a sequence which can be transcribed in the organelles and to evaluate its repair efficiency [for instance with quantitative PCR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>)] versus that of an equivalent fragment which cannot be transcribed. Transcription-coupled repair (TCR) occurs in the nuclear compartment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>). Such analyses will give some hints as to whether DNA repair can be coupled to transcription in plant mitochondria, thus integrating DNA and RNA metabolisms.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>SUPPLEMENTARY DATA</title><p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkp606/DC1">Supplementary Data</ext-link> are available at NAR Online.</p><supplementary-material id="PMC_1" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>[Supplementary Data]</title></caption><media mimetype="text" mime-subtype="html" xlink:href="gkp606_index.html"/><media xlink:role="associated-file" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="gkp606_1.pdf"/></supplementary-material></sec><sec><title>FUNDING</title><p>French Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS, UPR2357); Universit&#x000e9; Louis Pasteur (ULP), now part of the Universit&#x000e9; de Strasbourg.
