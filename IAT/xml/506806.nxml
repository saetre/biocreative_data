The gene mutated in WS encodes a nuclear protein (WRN) which possesses 3&#x02032;&#x02013;5&#x02032; exonuclease and ATPase-dependent 3&#x02032;&#x02013;5&#x02032; helicase activities. The genomic instability associated with WS cells and the biochemical characteristics of WRN suggest that WRN plays a role in DNA metabolic pathways such as transcription, replication, recombination and repair. Recently we have identified poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase-1 (PARP-1) as a new WRN interacting protein. In this paper, we further mapped the interacting domains. We found that PARP-1 bound to the N-terminus of WRN and to the C-terminus containing the RecQ-conserved (RQC) domain. WRN bound to the N-terminus of PARP-1 containing DNA binding and BRCA1 C-terminal (BRCT) domains. We show that unmodified PARP-1 inhibited both WRN exonuclease and helicase activities, and to our knowledge is the only known WRN protein partner that inactivates both of the WRN's catalytic activities suggesting a biologically significant regulation. Moreover, this dual inhibition seems to be specific for PARP-1, as PARP-2 did not affect WRN helicase activity and only slightly inhibited WRN exonuclease activity. The differential effect of PARP-1 and PARP-2 on WRN catalytic activity was not due to differences in affinity for WRN or the DNA substrate. Finally, we demonstrate that the inhibition of WRN by PARP-1 was influenced by the poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation state of PARP-1. The biological relevance of the specific modulation of WRN catalytic activities by PARP-1 are discussed in the context of pathways in which these proteins may function together, namely in the repair of DNA strand breaks.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Werner syndrome (WS) is a premature aging disease caused by mutations in the Werner gene (<italic>WRN</italic>). WRN belongs to the human RecQ family of DNA helicases, which also includes RecQ1, Bloom (BLM), Rothmund&#x02013;Thompson (RTS) and RecQ5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh721c1">1</xref>). Mutations in BLM and RTS are also associated with heritable human diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh721c2">2</xref>). Cells from WS patients display defects in replication, altered telomere dynamics and genome instability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh721c3">3</xref>), suggesting an important role for WRN in DNA metabolic pathways. In addition, many WRN-interacting proteins participate in transcription, recombination, replication, repair and&#x0002f;or telomere maintenance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh721c3">3</xref>).</p><p>WRN possesses ATPase-dependent helicase activity and is the only member of the human RecQ family to possess exonuclease activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh721c4">4</xref>). WRN's catalytic activities are structure specific and are active on DNA substrates resembling replication forks (long forked substrates), recombination intermediates (Holliday junctions), DNA repair intermediates (recessed and nicked substrates) and telomere structures (D-loops) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh721c3">3</xref>), further supporting a role for WRN in these processes. Interestingly, both the exonuclease and the helicase activities of WRN are modulated by several interacting proteins and post-translational modifications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh721c3">3</xref>).</p><p>The RecQ-conserved (RQC) domain of WRN plays a central role in WRN's functions. It contains a nucleolar targeting sequence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh721c5">5</xref>), possesses DNA binding properties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh721c6">6</xref>), stimulates flap endonuclease-1 (FEN-1) cleavage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh721c7">7</xref>) and mediates binding to many of WRN's protein partners (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh721c7">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh721c11">11</xref>). Recently we have identified poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase-1 (PARP-1) as the most prominent WRN RQC binding protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh721c11">11</xref>).</p><p>Following DNA damage, PARP-1 catalyzes the sequential transfer of ADP-ribose monomers onto protein acceptors, including itself, using NAD<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> as a substrate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh721c12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh721c13">13</xref>). The poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation state of PARP-1 differentially affects its binding to other proteins, such as X-ray repair cross-complementing 1 (XRCC1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh721c14">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh721c16">16</xref>), DNA ligase III (lig III) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh721c17">17</xref>), and WRN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh721c11">11</xref>). This poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation reaction is one of the earliest responses to DNA damage in the cell, and is mainly catalyzed by PARP-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh721c12">12</xref>). We have recently observed that the WRN&#x0002f;PARP-1 interaction is important for the poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation pathway following oxidative stress-induced DNA damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh721c11">11</xref>).</p><p>Mice deficient in PARP-1 displayed a residual poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation activity following DNA damage, and this observation led to the discovery of PARP-2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh721c18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh721c19">19</xref>). PARP-1 and PARP-2 are involved in different aspects of genomic stability, such as modulation of chromatin structure, replication, transcription and single-strand break&#x0002f;base excision repair (SSBR&#x0002f;BER) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh721c14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh721c20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh721c21">21</xref>). Thus far, and supporting a role in DNA metabolic pathways, PARP-1 and PARP-2 are the sole PARP family members whose catalytic activities are stimulated <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> by DNA strand breaks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh721c19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh721c22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh721c23">23</xref>). Interestingly, the effect on DNA strand break repair is as dramatic in the absence of PARP-2 as it is in the absence of PARP-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh721c23">23</xref>). This was surprising due to the fact that the absence of PARP-2 had only a small effect on the total cellular PARP activity stimulated by DNA breaks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh721c23">23</xref>), and may be explained by the fact that PARP-1 and PARP-2 form both homo- and heterodimers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh721c23">23</xref>). If PARP-1 and PARP-2 act as a heterodimer in SSBR&#x0002f;BER, then the absence of either would have similar consequences on repair efficiency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh721c23">23</xref>).</p><p>Based on our findings that WRN interacts with PARP-1 and that the WRN&#x0002f;PARP-1 interaction is important for the poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation pathway following oxidative DNA damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh721c11">11</xref>), we examined the effects of PARP-1 on WRN catalytic activities. We demonstrate here that unmodified PARP-1 inhibits both WRN exonuclease and helicase activities. This inhibition was specific for PARP-1, because PARP-2 did not affect WRN helicase activity and only slightly inhibited WRN exonuclease activity. However, the inhibition of WRN catalytic activities was relieved in the presence of auto-poly(ADP-ribosyl)ated PARP-1. We discuss the importance of these results in the context of DNA metabolic pathways in which these proteins participate.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Recombinant proteins</title><p>His-tagged WRN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh721c24">24</xref>), his-tagged N-WRN (amino acids 1&#x02013;368) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh721c25">25</xref>), human PARP-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh721c26">26</xref>) and mouse PARP-2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh721c19">19</xref>) were purified as described previously.

Thus far, most of the WRN-interacting proteins bind to more than one WRN region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh721c8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh721c9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh721c27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh721c28">28</xref>). To more precisely map the PARP-1 binding domain(s) of WRN, we used various GST&#x02013;WRN fragments and recombinant PARP-1 for <italic>in vitro</italic> pull-down assays. As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh721f1">1</xref>A, recombinant PARP-1 bound to three WRN regions: the N-terminus (amino acids 1&#x02013;120), the helicase domain (amino acids 500&#x02013;946) and the C-terminus (amino acids 949&#x02013;1432). Neither GST alone nor the WRN acidic region (amino acids 239&#x02013;499) demonstrated any significant binding activity (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh721f1">1</xref>A). As we have shown previously that GST&#x02013;WRN<sub>949&#x02013;1092</sub> also pulls down PARP-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh721c11">11</xref>), PARP-1 binding to the C-terminal domain of WRN is likely mediated through the RQC domain.</p></sec><sec><title>Identification of PARP-1 and PARP-2 domains involved in the interaction with WRN</title><p>PARP-1 and PARP-2 share many of the same protein partners (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh721c23">23</xref>). To address whether PARP-2 also interacts with WRN, we performed <italic>in vivo</italic> pull-down experiments. As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh721f1">1</xref>B, PARP-2 co-precipitated endogenous WRN (lane 4). To map interacting regions, GST-fusion proteins were generated, expressing truncated versions of PARP-2 and PARP-1 and over-expressed in HeLa cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh721f1">1</xref>B). Only domain E (amino acids 63&#x02013;202) of PARP-2 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh721f1">1</xref>B, lane 6) was able to pull down WRN as efficiently as the full-length protein. Co-precipitation of endogenous WRN was efficient with PARP-1 constructs containing either the DNA binding domain (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh721f1">1</xref>B, lane 8) or the BRCT domain (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh721f1">1</xref>B, lane 10). The DNA binding and BRCT domains of PARP-1 are involved in the homodimerization of the protein as well as in the binding to several partners (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh721c23">23</xref>). Domain E of PARP-2 is involved in homodimerization and in heterodimerization with PARP-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh721c23">23</xref>). Thus, WRN binds important structural regions of PARP-1 and PARP-2, which act as interfaces for protein&#x02013;protein interactions. These results also demonstrate that PARP-2 is a new WRN interacting protein.</p></sec><sec><title>PARP-1 and PARP-2 bind WRN with similar affinities</title><p>To determine direct protein&#x02013;protein interactions between PARP-2 and WRN, we performed ELISA with purified recombinant proteins (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh721f1">1</xref>C, right panel). <italic>In vitro</italic> binding reactions contained the same molar concentration of purified recombinant PARP and increasing concentrations of WRN. To rule out that interactions were DNA-mediated, binding reactions were performed in the presence of ethidium bromide. PARP-2 bound WRN in a concentration-dependent manner (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh721f1">1</xref>C, left panel). Furthermore, the binding affinities between WRN and PARP-2 (<italic>K</italic><sub>d</sub> &#x0003d; 1.5 nM) were almost identical to that of WRN and PARP-1 (<italic>K</italic><sub>d</sub> &#x0003d; 1.3 nM).</p></sec><sec><title>PARP-1 inhibits WRN helicase activity</title><p>Based on the physical protein interactions demonstrated above, we next investigated the influence of PARP-1 and PARP-2 on WRN catalytic activities. Using a 22 bp forked duplex oligonucleotide (22Fork3&#x0002f;22Fork4), the WRN helicase displaced the labeled strand in a concentration-dependent manner (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh721f2">2</xref>A, lanes 3 and 8). The presence of increasing concentrations of PARP-1 resulted in a concentration-dependent decrease in the amount of product unwound by WRN (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh721f2">2</xref>A, lanes 4 to 7 and 9 to 12). At the highest concentration of PARP-1 examined (an 8-fold molar excess), WRN helicase activity was inhibited 2.4- to 3.3-fold. As PARP-1 is an abundant nuclear protein, the molar ratios of WRN:PARP-1 employed in this study are likely biologically relevant. In contrast to the findings with PARP-1, increasing concentrations of PARP-2 did not affect WRN helicase activity on a short-forked duplex (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh721f2">2</xref>B, lanes 4 to 7 and 9 to 12). Thus, PARP-1 inhibited the helicase activity of WRN, whereas PARP-2 did not.</p></sec><sec><title>Effects of PARP-1 and PARP-2 on WRN exonuclease activity</title><p>We next examined the effect of PARP-1 and PARP-2 on WRN exonuclease activity.

Increasing concentrations of PARP-1 inhibited WRN exonuclease activity (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh721f3">3</xref>A, lanes 11 to 14 and Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="gkh721tb2">2</xref>). Heat denaturation of PARP-1 before the reaction relieved the inhibition of WRN exonuclease activity (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh721f3">3</xref>A, lane 15). In addition to forked duplex substrates, PARP-1 strongly inhibited WRN exonuclease activity on recessed, nicked and gapped substrates (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="gkh721tb2">2</xref>). Quantitation of undigested versus digested products revealed a marked decrease in the amount of substrate digested by WRN in the presence of increasing concentrations of PARP-1 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh721f3">3</xref>B, right panel). At the highest concentration of PARP-1 employed (1:8 molar ratio of WRN:PARP-1), PARP-1 inhibited WRN exonuclease activity approximately 8-fold. Increasing concentrations of PARP-2 also inhibited the progression of the WRN exonuclease (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh721f3">3</xref>A, lanes 4 to 7). However, although progression of the WRN exonuclease was inhibited by PARP-2 (1:4 and 1:8 molar ratios), the amount of total digested products was similar (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh721f3">3</xref>B, left panel).</p><p>As the exonuclease domain of WRN resides in the N-terminus of the protein (amino acids 1&#x02013;368, N-WRN), we next examined the influence of PARP-1 and PARP-2 on N-WRN exonuclease activity. N-WRN has been shown to possess exonuclease activity similar to that of the full-length protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh721c29">29</xref>). Analogous to what we observed for full-length WRN, increasing concentrations of PARP-1 inhibited the exonuclease activity of N-WRN (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh721f3">3</xref>C, right panel). Interestingly, PARP-1 inhibited the exonuclease activity of N-WRN at lower molar ratios compared to full-length WRN (compare Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh721f3">3</xref>C, right panel to Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh721f3">3</xref>B, right panel). Increasing concentrations of PARP-2 did not affect the percentage of substrate digested by N-WRN (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh721f3">3</xref>C, left panel).</p><p>Our results demonstrate that PARP-2 had only a modest inhibitory effect on WRN exonuclease activity while PARP-1 strongly inhibited both full-length and N-WRN exonuclease activity on a variety of substrates. As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh721f1">1</xref>A, PARP-1 binds both the N- and C-terminal regions of WRN, suggesting that protein&#x02013;protein interactions may be responsible for the inhibition. However, since both PARP-1 and PARP-2 are DNA binding proteins, we cannot rule out the possibility that the inhibition of WRN catalytic activity is due to PARP-1 or PARP-2 binding the DNA and preventing WRN access to the DNA substrate.</p></sec><sec><title>PARP-1 and PARP-2 bind a long-forked duplex DNA substrate</title><p>The forked duplex substrates used for the helicase and exonuclease assays contain both regions of single-strand (ss) and double-strand (ds) DNA. In addition, the blunt end mimics a dsDNA break. One possible mechanism for PARP-1 inhibition of WRN helicase and exonuclease activities may be that PARP-1 binds to the DNA substrate and prevents WRN catalytic activities. To test for PARP-1 binding to the forked duplex substrate, we performed gel-shift assays (EMSA). Proteins known to bind dsDNA breaks (Ku 70&#x0002f;80) and ssDNA (RPA) effectively bound (shifted) the long-forked duplex substrate (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh721f4">4</xref>, lanes 2 to 4 and 5 to 7, respectively). In addition, PARP-1 bound the long-forked duplex (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh721f4">4</xref>, lanes 8 to 10) with a similar affinity as RPA. To determine whether the differential effects observed by PARP-1 and PARP-2 were due to differences in DNA binding, we also tested whether PARP-2 could bind the long forked duplex. We found that PARP-2 formed a stable complex with DNA at similar concentrations as PARP-1 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh721f4">4</xref>, lanes 11-13). Thus, the differential influences of PARP-1 and PARP-2 on WRN catalytic functions do not appear to be due to differences in the affinity for the DNA substrate. However, it may be possible that PARP-1 and PARP-2 bind to different regions of the DNA substrate, as PARP-1 and PARP-2 contain distinct DNA binding domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh721c19">19</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Auto-poly(ADP-ribosyl)ated PARP-1 does not inhibit WRN catalytic activities</title><p>Binding of PARP-1 to DNA strand breaks results in activation and auto-poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation, which involves the addition of ADP-ribose chains using NAD<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> as a substrate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh721c13">13</xref>). As the above experiments were performed in the absence of NAD<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>, we were interested in the effects of activated and auto-poly(ADP-ribosyl)ated PARP-1 on WRN catalytic activities. PARP-1 was activated in the presence of unlabeled forked duplex oligonucleotide and NAD<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh721f5">5</xref>A, lanes 2 and 5), but not in the absence of NAD<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh721f5">5</xref>A, lanes 1 and 4). As seen previously, unmodified PARP-1 inhibited WRN exonuclease activity (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh721f5">5</xref>B, lane 2). ADP-ribosylation of PARP-1 restored WRN exonuclease activity (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh721f5">5</xref>B, lane 3). Similarly, unmodified PARP-1 inhibited WRN helicase activity (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh721f5">5</xref>C, lane 6), whereas modified PARP-1 did not (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh721f5">5</xref>C, lane 7). These results demonstrate that the poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation status of PARP-1 regulates WRN catalytic activities.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>We and others have recently identified a physical interaction between WRN and PARP-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh721c11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh721c30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh721c31">31</xref>), and we have shown that the WRN&#x0002f;PARP-1 interaction is important for the poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation of nuclear proteins after DNA damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh721c11">11</xref>). In this paper, we further mapped the interacting domains between WRN and PARP-1 and identified PARP-2 as a new WRN interacting protein. We also demonstrated that unmodified PARP-1 inhibited both the exonuclease and helicase activities of WRN. With an estimated PARP-1 concentration of 2 &#x000d7; 10<sup>5</sup> to 5 &#x000d7; 10<sup>5</sup> molecules per cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh721c32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh721c33">33</xref>) and a WRN concentration of 3.4 &#x000d7; 10<sup>4</sup> to 8.4 &#x000d7; 10<sup>4</sup> molecules per cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh721c34">34</xref>), the strong inhibition of WRN catalytic activities with an 8-fold molar excess of PARP-1 may likely be observed <italic>in vivo</italic>. This inhibition of WRN by unmodified PARP-1 appears to be specific, as PARP-2 failed to inhibit WRN helicase activity and only modestly inhibited WRN exonuclease activity, despite showing binding affinities to WRN and the DNA substrate similar to that of PARP-1. Activation and auto-poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation of PARP-1 in the presence of DNA strand breaks relieved the inhibition of WRN catalytic activities. Consistent with our results, Li <italic>et al</italic>. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh721c31">31</xref>) found that poly(ADP-ribosyl)ated PARP-1 did not inhibit WRN helicase or exonuclease activities. In contrast, they did not observe inhibition of WRN catalytic activities by unmodified PARP-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh721c31">31</xref>).</p><p>Other WRN protein partners including p53 and BLM have been shown to inhibit WRN exonuclease activity. p53 strongly inhibits full-length WRN but not N-WRN exonuclease activity and does not influence WRN helicase activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh721c35">35</xref>). BLM inhibits both full-length and N-WRN exonuclease activity and does not effect WRN helicase activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh721c8">8</xref>). To our knowledge, PARP-1 is the only known WRN protein partner that strongly inhibits both WRN exonuclease and helicase activites. As PARP-1 binds to both WRN and DNA, it is not clear which is responsible for the inhibitory effect. However, Ku is also an abundant nuclear protein with a high affinity for DNA ends and which binds WRN. As Ku strongly stimulates WRN exonuclease activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh721c36">36</xref>), the inhibition of WRN catalytic activities by other proteins cannot simply be due to their binding to DNA and blocking WRN access, and suggests that the mechanism of PARP-1 inhibition also involves protein&#x02013;protein interactions.</p><p>The <italic>in vivo</italic> regulation of WRN catalytic activities is likely mediated by protein&#x02013;protein interactions and&#x0002f;or post-translational modifications. The regulation of WRN exonuclease activity by DNA-PK (Ku 70&#x0002f;80 and DNA-PKcs) suggests a direct role for WRN in non-homologous end joining. Interestingly, the two components of DNA-PK differentially affect the exonuclease activity. Ku 70&#x0002f;80 strongly stimulates WRN exonuclease activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh721c36">36</xref>). This stimulation is due to the direct binding of the Ku 70 subunit to the N-terminal region of WRN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh721c27">27</xref>). In contrast, DNA-PKcs inhibits both the exonuclease and helicase activities of WRN either by Ser&#x0002f;Thr phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh721c28">28</xref>) or by physical association (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh721c37">37</xref>). Interestingly, the <italic>in vitro</italic> inhibition by DNA-PKcs is dominant over the Ku 70&#x0002f;80 stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh721c28">28</xref>). Although the precise role of these functional interactions has still not been elucidated, it is possible that release of one of WRN's modulators from the DNA end would allow another to regulate WRN helicase and&#x0002f;or exonuclease activities.</p><p>PARP-1 has also been shown to interact with Ku 70&#x0002f;80 and DNA-PKcs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh721c38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh721c39">39</xref>). DNA-PK phosphorylates PARP-1 and PARP-1 poly(ADP-ribosyl)ates each of the three subunits of DNA-PK (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh721c38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh721c39">39</xref>). Poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation of Ku 70&#x0002f;80 by PARP-1 results in decreased DNA binding of Ku 70&#x0002f;80 and a decreased ability of Ku 70&#x0002f;80 to stimulate WRN exonuclease activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh721c31">31</xref>). As PARP-1 is believed to be the first protein that binds a DNA break to protect the ends from nuclease degradation and aberrant DNA exchanges (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh721c40">40</xref>), regulation and coordination between PARP-1, DNA-PK, and WRN are likely important to ensure correct processing of the DNA double-strand break.</p><p>PARP-1 and PARP-2 also play important roles in SSBR&#x0002f;BER. Mouse embryonic fibroblasts lacking either PARP-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh721c12">12</xref>) or PARP-2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh721c23">23</xref>) display defects in alkylation-induced DNA strand break repair. In addition, <italic>parp-1<sup>&#x02212;&#x0002f;&#x02212;</sup></italic> and <italic>parp-2<sup>&#x02212;&#x0002f;&#x02212;</sup></italic> mice are sensitive to ionizing radiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh721c12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh721c21">21</xref>). PARP-1 interacts with many proteins involved in SSBR&#x0002f;BER including XRCCI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh721c15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh721c41">41</xref>), lig III (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh721c17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh721c23">23</xref>), and pol &#x003b2; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh721c14">14</xref>). PARP-1 recruits XRCCI to the damage site and is required for the formation of XRCCI foci following oxidative DNA damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh721c42">42</xref>). Interestingly, XRCCI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh721c15">15</xref>) and lig III (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh721c17">17</xref>) preferentially interact with poly(ADP-ribosyl)ated PARP-1.</p><p>WRN also interacts physically and functionally with many BER components, including pol &#x003b2; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh721c10">10</xref>), pol &#x003b4; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh721c43">43</xref>), and FEN-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh721c7">7</xref>). WRN helicase activity stimulates strand displacement DNA synthesis of pol &#x003b2; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh721c10">10</xref>) and nucleotide incorporation by pol &#x003b4; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh721c44">44</xref>). In addition, WRN stimulates FEN-1 flap cleavage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh721c7">7</xref>). A WRN&#x0002f;PARP-1 complex may act in DNA damage recognition and in recruitment of DNA repair proteins to the damage site. Binding of PARP-1 to DNA breaks results in PARP-1 activation and the poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation of nuclear proteins, a process involved in the opening of chromatin around the damage site as well as in the recruitment of DNA repair proteins (i.e. XRCC1) mediated through binding to poly(ADP-ribose) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh721c45">45</xref>) (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh721f6">6</xref>). Poly(ADP-ribosyl)ated PARP-1 binds not only less efficiently to DNA, but also to WRN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh721c11">11</xref>), leaving the damaged site and relieving the inhibition of WRN catalytic activities (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh721f6">6</xref>). WRN may then act by recruiting other DNA repair proteins, as we have previously seen that cells lacking WRN are deficient in the poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation of other proteins following oxidative stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh721c11">11</xref>). Furthermore, WRN could play an active role in the repair process, possibly allowing for subsequent stimulation of pol &#x003b2; strand displacement and&#x0002f;or FEN-1 flap cleavage by WRN during long-patch BER (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh721f6">6</xref>).</p><p>PARP-2 also interacts with XRCCI, lig III and pol &#x003b2; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh721c23">23</xref>). It has been proposed that PARP-2 may not be involved in the DNA strand break recognition and signaling steps of SSBR&#x0002f;BER like PARP-1, but rather in a subsequent step of the repair process, which when absent, leads to a repair defect observed in PARP-2<sup>&#x02212;&#x0002f;&#x02212;</sup> cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh721c23">23</xref>). The apparently distinct roles of PARP-1 and PARP-2 in SSBR&#x0002f;BER may explain their differential effect on WRN catalytic activities.</p><p>Neither PARP-1 nor WRN are essential components of the basic process of DNA strand break repair (either DSBR or SSBR&#x0002f;BER).

Poly(ADP-ribosyl)ated PARP-1 binds less efficiently to WRN and subsequently relieves the inhibition of WRN catalytic activities.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="gkh721f6"/></fig><table-wrap id="gkh721tb1"><label>Table 1.</label><caption><title>Oligonucleotides used in this study</title></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups" border="1" width="85%"><colgroup><col/><col/></colgroup><thead valign="bottom"><tr valign="top"><th valign="top">Oligonucleotide</th><th valign="top">Sequence (5&#x02032;&#x02013;3&#x02032;)</th></tr></thead><tbody valign="top"><tr valign="top"><td valign="top">22Fork3</td><td valign="top">TTTTTTTTTTTTTTTGAGTGTGGTGTACATGCACTAC</td></tr><tr valign="top"><td valign="top">22Fork4</td><td valign="top">GTAGTGCATGTACACCACACTCTTTTTTTTTTTTTTT</td></tr><tr valign="top"><td valign="top">34ForkA</td><td valign="top">TTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTAGGGTTAGGGTTAGGGTTAGGGCATGCACTAC</td></tr><tr valign="top"><td valign="top">34ForkB</td><td valign="top">GTAGTGCATGCCCTAACCCTAACCCTAACCCTAATTTTTTTTTTTTTTT</td></tr><tr valign="top"><td valign="top">15P</td><td valign="top">CTGCAGCTGATGCGC</td></tr><tr valign="top"><td valign="top">34G</td><td valign="top">GTACCCGGGGATCCGTACGGCGCATCAGCTGCAG</td></tr><tr valign="top"><td valign="top">19D</td><td valign="top">CGTACGGATCCCCGGGTAC</td></tr><tr valign="top"><td valign="top">17D</td><td valign="top">TACGGATCCCCGGGTAC</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><table-wrap id="gkh721tb2"><label>Table 2.</label><caption><title>Inhibition of WRN exonuclease by PARP-1</title></caption><graphic xlink:href="gkh721t2"/><table-wrap-foot><fn><p>The numbers above PARP-1 refer to the molar ratio of WRN:PARP-1.
