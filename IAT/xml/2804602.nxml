Once CENP-E expression was interrupted, the chromosomes can not separate procedurally, and may result in aneuploidy which is a hallmark of most solid cancers, such as hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).

A significantly-increased proportion of aneuploid in these down-knocked LO2 cells compared with those treated with control shRNA vector.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>Together with other results, these results reveal that CENP-E expression was reduced in human HCC tissue, and low CENP-E expression result in aneuploidy in LO2 cells.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>Chromosomal or genetic instability (CIN) leading to an aberrant chromosome number (aneuploidy) is a hallmark of cancers[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. A growing body of evidence suggests that defects in the spindle checkpoint, a surveillance mechanism crucial for the proper segregation of chromosomes during every cell division, might promote aneuploidy and tumorigenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. The spindle checkpoint machinery consists of several proteins that are well-conserved in various species. These checkpoint proteins are recruited and activated at the kinetochores of unattached and/or unaligned chromosomes, and subsequently inhibit the anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C) and prevent the ubiquitination of substrates whose destruction is required for advance to anaphase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. To date, two checkpoint proteins are known for directly mediating the activation or/and inactivation of spindle checkpoint, i.e., CENP-E and BubR1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>].</p><p>CENP-E is a kinesin-like motor protein localized on the kinetochore. It has an apparent molecular mass of 312 kDa, with an ATP-dependent motor domain located at the N-terminus. CENP-E is required for efficient capture and attachment of spindle microtubules by kinetochores, a necessary step in chromosome alignment during prometaphase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Disrupting the function of CENP-E by various methods consistently results in the appearance of some unaligned chromosomes at metaphase. Previous studies using either microinjection or the antisense approach showed that cells with CENP-E defects had prolonged mitotic arrest, and even initiated apoptosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>].</p><p>Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most common carcinoma causing death world widely. However, genetic events in hepatic carcinogenesis are poorly understood. It has been reported that CIN can be observed in hepatoma carcinoma cell, resulting from defects of spindle checkpoint genes. Sze KM et al have shown that all 6 hepatoma cell lines with defective mitotic checkpoint showed significant reduced expression of mitotic arrest deficient 2 (<italic>Mad</italic>2)[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. <italic>Mad</italic>1beta, a novel splicing variant of mitotic arrest deficient 1 (<italic>Mad</italic>1), was expressed at both mRNA and protein levels in the nine hepatoma cell lines tested and was over-expressed in 12 of 50 (24%) human HCC tissues[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. Jeong SJ et al have shown that transcriptional dysfunction of <italic>hsMad</italic>2 is frequently observed in hepatocellular carcinoma cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. Marchio et al used Comparative Genomic Hybridization (CGH) to evaluate and map genomic aberrations in 50 hepatocellular carcinomas from patients chronically infected with hepatitis B virus (HBV), and found nonrandom genomic imbalances and spindle checkpoint genes alterations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. Thus, the present study is designed to investigate the alteration of CENP-E gene expression in human hepatocarcinoma tissues, and study the fate of LO2 cells (normal liver cell line) treated with CENP-E shRNA vectors, with a intend to explore the role of CENP-E in human hepatocarcinogenesis.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Samples</title><p>Twenty-one HCC tissue samples and eighteen para-cancerous tissue samples were obtained from the Department of Surgery of the Liver &#x00026; Biliary, the first and second affiliated hospitals of Chongqing Medical University, all of which were confirmed by pathobiology.

By BLAST analysis, these sequences have no homology with other coding sequences in human. Scrambled sequence used as negative control: 5'-CGAGTAAGACCATTCA GGTC-3'. The 5'end of this sequence corresponds to the cut-off point for <italic>BamH</italic>I enzyme (GATCC), while the 3'end, containing the T6 sequence, corresponds to the cutting site for <italic>Hind </italic>III enzyme (AGCTT).

In this study we found that the mRNA and protein expression levels of CENP-E were reduced both in HCC tissues and in human hepatocellular carcinoma-derived cell lines (HepG2), and that the LO<sub>2 </sub>cells transfected with shRNA vector had a decreased proliferation rate and an increased proportion of aneuploid and apoptosis cells.</p></sec><sec><title>Reduced expression of CENP-E may be involved in human hepatocarcinogenesis</title><p>Our evidence presents that the level of CENP-E protein was reduced in the HCC tissues, which implicates that CENP-E may be involved in human hepatocarcinogenesis. We draw this conclusion from two aspects as follows:</p><p>(1) Aneuploidy is related with tumorigenesis. A majority of human cancer cells are aneuploid due to an underlying chromosomal instability phenotype [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. Theodor Boveri proposed an aneuploid hypothesis, in which, aneuploid was presumed as a direct cause of cancerous transformation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. With the discovery of oncogenes and tumour suppressors in the late 1970s and 1980s, some researchers suggested that heterozygosity loss might result in the phenotypic expression of mutated tumour suppressor genes in the aneuploid cell, and aneuploid cells may show chromosome polysomy that harbours oncogenes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. Aneuploid is still an important cause of tumorigenesis, and oncogenes hypothesis also supports this point, although there is no direct evidence to confirm that aneuploidy is a primary contributor to tumorigenesis up to now.</p><p>(2) Cancer is associated with weakened spindle checkpoint. A growing body of evidence suggests that defects in the spindle checkpoint might promote aneuploidy and tumorigenesis. Mouse with reduced expression of spindle checkpoint proteins survived but developed aneuploidy at an elevated rate, and in some, but not all cases, these animals are more susceptible to spontaneous tumours [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>] Cells over-expressing Mad2 developed a large number of chromosome breaks, fragments, and fusions in addition to whole chromosomal aneuploidy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. Mutation of mitotic checkpoint genes such as BubR1, Mad2, has been found in colon cancer lines, and breast cancer, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. Mosaic variegated aneuploidy (MVA), which is characterized by an increase in aneuploidy (&#x0003e;25% of cells exhibit near-diploid aneuploidy) and childhood cancers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. Five of eight MVA patients were found to have mutations in both alleles of BubR1 gene. Aneuploidy occurred in the pGenesil-CENPE shRNA-treated LO<sub>2 </sub>cells in this study, for which one potential explain is that the level of CENP-E may affect spindle checkpoint. Once the level of CENP-E protein was decreased, the onset of unaligned chromosomes and aneuploidy was induced in the anaphase. Completely inactivating the checkpoint would result in cell autonomous lethality because of large loss or gain of chromosome; however, cells with a weakened checkpoint could survive but exhibit chromosomal instability. In our study, the level of CENP-E protein was down-regulated dramatically, thus the spindle checkpoint of LO<sub>2 </sub>cells treated with shRNA vector might be subjected to a large degree of damage, some of which even suffer apoptosis or death. These points are also proved by our MTT result and are consistent with those of Marcel Tanudji [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>The controversy about the role of reduced CENP-E in hepatocarcinogenesis</title><p>Beth A.A. Weaver has demonstrated that aneuploidy resulted from CENP-E<sub>+/-</sub>, which acts as an oncogene as well as a tumour suppressor. Widespread aneuploidy was accompanied by a 50% decrease of spontaneous liver tumours in aged CENP-E<sub>+/- </sub>mice compare with CENP-E<sub>+/+ </sub>mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. In the present study, we found that CENP-E decreased by about 50% in HCC tissue as compared with that in para-cancerous tissue. Possible explanations for these contradictions may be:</p><p>(1) Firstly, We tentatively put forward that the threshold level of CENP-E protein for promoting tumorigenesis might be in the range of 20-50% of the normal. The rate of apoptosis or death increased obviously in LO<sub>2 </sub>cells, when CENP-E was down-regulated to 15-20% in this study. However, aneuploidy due to reduced CENP-E (about 50% of the normal level) in CENP-E+/- mouse could act as a tumour suppressor. CENP-E in HCC tissue may be lower than the threshold value and higher than 15-20% of the normal level, and then may be promoting hepatocarcinogenesis.</p><p>(2) Secondly, the control samples used in our study may affect our final results. Because the expression level of CENP-E protein in para-cancerous may be lower than that of the normal liver tissue which was unavailable in the present study, the level of CENP-E in HCC tissue may be no higher than 50% of the normal.</p><p>(3) Finally, our results supported the following hypothesis, as proposed previously by Salmon's and Yen's laboratories [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. A certain level of the waiting-anaphase signal may be required for cells to induce mitotic arrest. When CENP-E is reduced lightly in cells, the accumulation of the signals generated at each kinetochore is still sufficient to reach the threshold required for mitotic arrest, and anaphase onset accompanied unaligned chromosomes promoting aneuploidy. When CENP-E is reduced to a larger extent, the accumulation of the signals may not be sufficient to arrest mitosis, and cells possessing mitosis with large loss or gain of chromosome may suffer apoptosis or death.</p><p>Despite the fact that reduced expression of CENP-E protein was found in HCC tissues and could induced apoptosis and aneuploidy in LO2 cells, our results do not provide direct evidence that reduced expression of CENP-E can initiate hepatocarcinogenesis. However, this problem might be solved if we down-regulate the level of CENP-E to various degrees by constructing interfere vector or finding microRNA to target CENP-E, and investigate the relationship between the reduced CENP-E expression and hepatocarcinogenesis.</p><p>In a word, we found that CENP-E expression was reduced in HCC tissue, and reduced CENP-E expression could interfere with the separation of chromosome in LO2 cells.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>Together with other results, these results reveal that CENP-E expression was reduced in human HCC tissue, and low CENP-E expression result in aneuploidy in LO2 cells.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>ZL participated in study design, carried out most of the experiments, and drafted the manuscript.
