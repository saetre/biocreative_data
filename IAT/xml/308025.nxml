We have isolated a gene, RFC2, that appears to be a component of the yeast RF-C. The RFC2 gene is located on chromosome X of S. cerevisiae and is essential for cell growth. Disruption of the RFC2 gene led to a dumbbell-shaped terminal morphology, common to mutants having a defect in chromosomal DNA replication. The steady-state levels of RFC2 mRNA fluctuated less during the cell cycle than other genes involved in DNA replication. Nucleotide sequence of the gene revealed an open reading frame corresponding to a polypeptide with a calculated Mr of 39,716 and a high degree of amino acid sequence homology to the 37-kDa subunit of human RF-C. Polyclonal antibodies against bacterially expressed Rfc2 protein specifically reduced RF-C activity in the RF-C-dependent reaction catalyzed by yeast DNA polymerase III. Furthermore, the Rfc2 protein was copurified with RF-C activity throughout RF-C purification. These results strongly suggest that the RFC2 gene product is a component of yeast RF-C. The bacterially expressed Rfc2 protein preferentially bound to primed single-strand DNA and weakly to ATP.</p><sec><title>Images</title><fig id="F1"><graphic xlink:href="nar00033-0029-a" xlink:role="1531"/></fig><fig id="F2"><graphic xlink:href="nar00033-0029-b" xlink:role="1531"/></fig><fig id="F3"><graphic xlink:href="nar00033-0031-a" xlink:role="1533"/></fig><fig id="F4"><graphic xlink:href="nar00033-0032-a" xlink:role="1534"/></fig></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><supplementary-material content-type="scanned-pages"><graphic xlink:href="nar00033-0025.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1527"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00033-0026.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1528"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00033-0027.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1529"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00033-0028.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1530"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00033-0029.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1531"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00033-0030.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1532"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00033-0031.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1533"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00033-0032.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1534"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00033-0033.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1535"/></supplementary-material></body></article>
