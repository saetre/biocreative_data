The identification of several genes that underlie familial forms of primary parkinsonism has allowed for the molecular dissection of mechanisms of dopamine neuron (DN) survival.

These data suggest a causal role for DJ-1 in the cellular oxidative stress response.</p><p>ThiJ domain proteins are highly conserved and have been associated with several functions including protease and chaperone activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020362-Halio1">Halio et al. 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020362-Du1">Du et al. 2000</xref>). The crystal structure of DJ-1 demonstrates the presence of a highly conserved nucleophile elbow-like domain at cysteine 106, but the relative position of this residue differs from that of a structurally related ThiJ protease, PH1704, and does not appear to be permissible for proton transfer and protease catalysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020362-Wilson1">Wilson et al. 2003</xref>). Furthermore, DJ-1 forms an asymmetric homodimer with a prominent carboxy-terminal helical region present at the dimerization interface, which appears to limit access to the nucleophile elbow-like domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020362-Huai1">Huai et al. 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020362-Lee3">Lee et al. 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020362-Wilson1">Wilson et al. 2003</xref>).</p><p>DJ-1 displays significant homology to the carboxy-terminal domain of the <named-content content-type="genus-species">Escherichia coli</named-content> HPII catalase, as both proteins are divergent members of the type I glutamine amidotransferase family. Interestingly, the carboxy-terminal DJ-1 homology domain of HPII catalase lacks catalase activity, but rather appears to function as a chaperone in the correct folding of the catalytic core of the protein, and in thermal enzyme stability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020362-Chelikani1">Chelikani et al. 2003</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020362-Taira1">Taira et al.

In contrast, analysis of DJ-1-deficient cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020362-Martinat1">Martinat et al. 2004</xref>) revealed that such cells display an apparently normal initial accumulation of ROS, indicating that DJ-1 likely functions in a protective role downstream of ROS insult. Consistent with this, DJ-1-deficient cells are predisposed to apoptotic death in the context of oxidative stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020362-Martinat1">Martinat et al. 2004</xref>).</p><p>Here we demonstrate that DJ-1 functions as a redox-regulated molecular chaperone that is activated in an oxidizing environment.

Consistent with this, purified DJ-1 preparations failed to display in vitro protease activity toward a variety of synthetic or natural substrates, and, similarly, DJ-1 lacked antioxidant (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="st001">Table S1</xref>) or catalase activities (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sg001">Figure S1</xref>) in vitro. Furthermore, cells deficient in DJ-1 appear unaltered in the initial accumulation of ROS in the context of acute oxidative stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020362-Martinat1">Martinat et al. 2004</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>DJ-1 Is a Redox-Dependent Molecular Chaperone</title><p>Every organism responds to ROS and other toxic environmental stresses by overexpressing a highly conserved set of heat shock proteins (Hsps), many of which function as molecular chaperones to assist other proteins in folding. Hsp31, an <named-content content-type="genus-species">E. coli</named-content> ThiJ domain protein<italic>,</italic> has been shown to function as a molecular chaperone in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020362-Sastry1">Sastry et al. 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020362-Malki1">Malki et al. 2003</xref>). We hypothesized that DJ-1 may similarly function as a protein chaperone to protect cells from ROS. DJ-1 chaperone activity was quantified in the suppression of heat-induced aggregation of citrate synthase (CS) and glutathione S-transferase (GST), two well-characterized protein chaperone assays. These proteins lose their native conformation and undergo aggregation during incubation at 43 &#x000b0;C and 60 &#x000b0;C, respectively. Addition of 0.5&#x02013;4.0 &#x003bc;M polyhistidine (His)-tagged DJ-1 was found to effectively suppress the heat-induced aggregation of 0.8 &#x003bc;M CS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020362-g001">Figure 1</xref>A). The chaperone activity was independent of the His tag used for purification, as cleavage and removal of the His tag did not alter DJ-1 chaperone function (unpublished data). DJ-1 chaperone activity is comparable to that of a well-described small cytoplasmic chaperone, human Hsp27. In contrast, RNase A failed to demonstrate chaperone activity and served as a negative control. Interestingly, the Parkinsonism-associated L166P DJ-1 mutation abrogated chaperone activity relative to the wild-type (WT) protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020362-g001">Figure 1</xref>B).</p><p>DJ-1 similarly functioned as a molecular chaperone in the context of the heat-induced aggregation of GST (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sg001">Figure S1</xref>). In contrast, DJ-1 failed to display activity in a third chaperone assay, aggregation suppression of reduced insulin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020362-g001">Figure 1</xref>C). Reduction of the disulfide bonds between the A and B chains of insulin with dithiothreitol (DTT) leads to aggregation of the B chains. Hsp27 effectively inhibited the aggregation of insulin in the presence of 20 mM DTT, whereas neither DJ-1 nor the negative control protein RNase A displayed chaperone activity in this assay. As the insulin aggregation assay is performed in a reduced environment, we hypothesized that DJ-1 chaperone activity may be redox regulated. Interestingly, such a redox switch in a molecular chaperone has been described in Hsp33 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020362-Jakob1">Jakob et al. 1999</xref>), a dimeric bacterial Hsp unrelated to DJ-1.</p><p>To test the redox regulation of DJ-1, we assayed chaperone activity in the CS aggregation assay in the presence or absence of the reducing agent DTT. DJ-1 chaperone activity in the CS aggregation assay was completely abrogated by preincubation of DJ-1 with 0.5 mM DTT in aggregation buffer for 10 min at 4 &#x000b0;C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020362-g001">Figure 1</xref>D). DTT did not significantly alter CS aggregation in the absence of DJ-1 and did not modify suppression of CS aggregation by Hsp27 (unpublished data). To further test whether redox regulation might govern DJ-1 chaperone activity, reactivation studies using reduced DJ-1 were performed. DTT-reduced DJ-1 was incubated with H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> (10 mM in aggregation buffer for 10 min at 4 &#x000b0;C followed by dialysis against aggregation buffer for 2 h), and subsequently chaperone activity was measured in the CS thermal aggregation assay. H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> effectively reactivated the chaperone activity of DTT-treated DJ-1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020362-g001">Figure 1</xref>D). This was not an indirect effect of residual H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> on CS aggregation, as H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> treatment of CS increased aggregation (unpublished data). These results suggest that redox regulation of DJ-1 is reversible and is regulated by the redox environment.</p><p>Molecular chaperones typically display marked stability to thermal stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020362-Sastry1">Sastry et al. 2002</xref>). Consistent with this, the ultraviolet-circular dichroism (CD) spectrum of WT DJ-1 is consistent with a well-folded protein, and thermal denaturation of WT DJ-1 revealed a cooperative thermal unfolding transition at approximately 75 &#x000b0;C (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sg001">Figure S1</xref>). In contrast, the CD spectrum of the DJ-1 L166P mutant protein is typical of a partially unfolded polypeptide, suggesting that the L166P mutation causes a significant loss of helical structure. The mutant protein does not exhibit a thermal unfolding transition in the range studied (0&#x02013;90 &#x000b0;C).</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>DJ-1 Inhibits the Generation of &#x003b1;Syn Aggregates</title><p>We extended the analysis of DJ-1 chaperone function to a candidate DJ-1 substrate, &#x003b1;Syn (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020362-g002">Figure 2</xref>). The aggregation of &#x003b1;Syn has been implicated in familial and sporadic forms of PD, as mutations associated with autosomal dominant familial primary Parkinsonism alter the propensity of &#x003b1;Syn to aggregate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020362-Conway1">Conway et al. 2000a</xref>), and as &#x003b1;Syn fibrils are a major constituent of the Lewy body intracytoplasmic inclusions that typify PD pathology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020362-Spillantini1">Spillantini et al. 1997</xref>).

Incubation of purified WT human &#x003b1;Syn for 2 h at 55 &#x000b0;C results in the generation of high molecular weight multimers that likely represent protofibrils (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020362-g002">Figure 2</xref>A and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020362-g002">2</xref>B) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020362-Volles1">Volles et al. 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020362-Gosavi1">Gosavi et al. 2002</xref>). This treatment does not result in formation of mature amyloid fibrils, as determined by Congo red staining (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sg001">Figure S1</xref>).

Because DJ-1 chaperone activity is effective at inhibiting the accumulation of &#x003b1;Syn protofibrils, we sought to investigate the role of this activity in the generation of Congo red&#x02013;positive mature fibrils. Congruently, WT DJ-1 inhibited formation of Congo red-positive &#x003b1;Syn fibrils, while L166P DJ-1 and GST did not (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020362-g002">Figure 2</xref>C). Thus, DJ-1 seems to inhibit formation of &#x003b1;Syn fibrils by preventing formation of &#x003b1;Syn high molecular weight oligomers, or protofibrils. Interestingly, PD-associated clinical mutations in &#x003b1;Syn appear to accelerate oligomerization and protofibril formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020362-Volles1">Volles et al. 2001</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>DJ-1 Chaperone Activity In Vivo</title><p>We sought to investigate the chaperone activity of DJ-1 toward &#x003b1;Syn in vivo. &#x003b1;Syn has been shown to form aggregates that consist of both protofibrils and mature amyloid fibrils in the context of oxidative stress (such as FeCl<sub>2</sub> treatment &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020362-Lee1">Lee and Lee 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020362-Lee2">Lee et al. 2002</xref>&#x0005d;) in neuroblastoma cells.

To test whether reactive cysteines play a critical role in the function or regulation of DJ-1 activity, we mutagenized each cysteine in DJ-1 to alanine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020362-g006">Figure 6</xref>). Surprisingly, mutation of cysteine 106, at the predicted nucleophile elbow of DJ-1, does not alter the basal activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020362-g006">Figure 6</xref>A) or the DTT sensitivity (See <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sg001">Figure S1</xref>) of DJ-1 chaperone function. In contrast, mutation of cysteine 53, which is present at the dimeric interface of DJ-1, completely abrogates chaperone activity. Similarly, mutation of all three cysteines in DJ-1 (cysteine 106, cysteine 53, and cysteine 47) leads to the loss of chaperone function. The cysteine mutations do not alter DJ-1 dimerization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020362-g006">Figure 6</xref>D) or the apparent stability of DJ-1 in vivo (unpublished data), unlike the L166P Parkinsonism-associated mutation.</p><p>DJ-1-deficient ES cells display increased sensitivity to oxidative stress, and this phenotype can be &#x0201c;rescued&#x0201d; by overexpression of WT DJ-1 but not PD-associated L166P mutant DJ-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020362-Martinat1">Martinat et al. 2004</xref>). We further investigated the activity of the cysteine-mutant forms of human DJ-1 in vivo in the complementation of DJ-1-deficient ES cells. Cysteine 106&#x02013;mutant DJ-1 robustly rescued DJ-1 knockout cells from H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> toxicity, consistent with the in vitro chaperone activity assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020362-g006">Figure 6</xref>C). In contrast, cysteine 53 and the triple-cysteine mutant forms of DJ-1 failed to protect from H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> toxicity. These data support a role for cysteine 53&#x02013;dependent chaperone activity in DJ-1-mediated ROS protection, and demonstrate a direct correlation between DJ-1 in vitro chaperone activity and cellular protection from oxidative stress. Our data are consistent with the prior observation that mutation of cysteine 53 to alanine abrogates the low&#x02013;isoelectric point variant that is induced by oxidative stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020362-Honbou1">Honbou et al. 2003a</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Discussion</title><p>We provide evidence that DJ-1 functions as a cytoplasmic redox-sensitive molecular chaperone in vitro and in vivo. This activity extends to &#x003b1;Syn and the neurofilament subunit NFL, proteins implicated in PD pathology. In a companion article (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020362-Martinat1">Martinat et al. 2004</xref>), we show that DJ-1 deficiency sensitizes cells to oxidative stress, leading to increased apoptosis in the context of an ROS burst. Taken together, our data strongly support the notion that DJ-1 functions as a redox-dependent protein chaperone to mitigate molecular insults downstream of an ROS burst. Oxidation-modified proteins have been shown to accumulate in the context of normal aging and PD, and may participate in the generation of protein aggregates in neurodegenerative disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020362-Jenner1">Jenner 2003</xref>).</p><p>It is of interest to identify relevant in vivo substrates for DJ-1 activity in the context of DNs in PD. Our data suggest that DJ-1 activity extends to multiple targets, reminiscent of other small protein chaperones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020362-Gusev1">Gusev et al. 2002</xref>), and consistent with this, DJ-1 activity is not ATP-dependent (unpublished data). Candidate substrates for DJ-1 chaperone activity in the context of PD include &#x003b1;Syn and neurofilament proteins, based on their presence in PD protein inclusions. Our data suggest that DJ-1 functions to suppress protein aggregates in the cytoplasm. It is possible that DJ-1 plays additional roles in the mitochondria or nucleus, as has been suggested (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020362-Bonifati1">Bonifati 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020362-CanetAviles1">Canet-Aviles 2004</xref>), although DJ-1 appears to remain localized diffusely in the cytoplasm with or without toxin treatment in our studies (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sg002">Figure S2</xref>).</p><p>Our data indicate that DJ-1 can suppress an early step in the formation of &#x003b1;Syn aggregates, the generation of high molecular weight oligomers (protofibrils). Interestingly, it has been suggested that such protofibrils, rather than the large fibrillar aggregates, may underlie &#x003b1;Syn toxicity in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020362-Volles1">Volles et al. 2001</xref>). DJ-1 inhibits the aggregation of &#x003b1;Syn in differentiated cells in vivo, and loss of DJ-1 leads to increased accumulation of insoluble &#x003b1;Syn. DJ-1 appears to associate with &#x003b1;Syn in the Triton X-100-soluble fraction of FeCl<sub>2</sub>-treated lysates, and DJ-1 colocalizes with &#x003b1;Syn in the Triton X-100-insoluble fraction in the context of FeCl<sub>2</sub> treatment. However, DJ-1 does not colocalize with the punctate protein aggregates visible by immunostaining in the case of either &#x003b1;Syn or NFL. This supports the notion that DJ-1 functions at an early step in the aggregation process, when the substrate protein may be misfolded, but has not yet formed a mature aggregate. We hypothesize that DJ-1 may promote the degradation of such misfolded proteins, either through the proteasome or through other cellular pathways such as chaperone-mediated autophagy.</p><p>A recent study investigated the chaperone activity of WT DJ-1 in vitro toward CS and concluded that redox regulation was not a significant factor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020362-Lee3">Lee et al. 2003</xref>). This is most likely a consequence of the use of only oxidizing conditions (0.5 mM H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) but not reducing conditions in the described chaperone assays (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020362-Lee3">Lee et al. 2003</xref>). A second report failed to detect DJ-1 chaperone activity in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020362-Olzmann1">Olzmann et al. 2003</xref>), but importantly, this study employed only reducing conditions in which DJ-1 chaperone activity is abrogated. In the present study we demonstrate that DJ-1 chaperone activity is inhibited by reducing conditions, and can be stimulated by oxidation. Thus, in the normal reducing environment of the cell, DJ-1 may be inactive. Production of ROS and alteration of the redox state of the cytoplasm may activate DJ-1 chaperone activity as a mechanism of coping with protein aggregation and misfolding.</p><p>We find that that the PD-associated L166P mutant DJ-1 fails to function as a molecular chaperone in vivo or in vitro. Consistent with this, in a companion article (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020362-Martinat1">Martinat et al. 2004</xref>), we show that this mutant fails to complement <italic>DJ-1</italic> knockout cells in vivo, even when overexpressed at artificially high levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020362-Martinat1">Martinat et al. 2004</xref>). Furthermore, the L166P mutant form fails to dimerize even when expressed at WT levels. Thus, although prior studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020362-Miller1">Miller et al. 2003</xref>) and our analyses (unpublished data) have found that the L166P PD-associated DJ-1 mutation leads to decreased protein stability, it is apparent that even overexpression of the L166P mutant protein does not restore function. The L166P clinical phenotype is not due simply to reduced levels of DJ-1 protein, and, furthermore, we do not observe evidence of altered subcellular localization of the L166P mutant protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020362-g004">Figure 4</xref>M-<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020362-g004">4</xref>R).
