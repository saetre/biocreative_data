The small guanosine triphosphatase (GTPase) Rap1 is an important regulator of cell&#x02013;cell and cell&#x02013;matrix adhesions. We show here that induced expression of activated Abl tyrosine kinase reduces Rap1-GTP levels through phosphorylation of Tyr221 of CrkII, which disrupts interaction of CrkII with C3G, a guanine nucleotide exchange factor for Rap1. Abl-dependent down-regulation of Rap1-GTP causes cell rounding and detachment only when the Rho&#x02013;ROCK1 pathway is also activated, for example, by lysophosphatidic acid (LPA). During ephrin-A1&#x02013;induced retraction of PC3 prostate cancer cells, we show that endogenous Abl is activated and disrupts the CrkII&#x02013;C3G complex to reduce Rap1-GTP. Interestingly, ephrin-A1&#x02013;induced PC3 cell retraction also requires LPA, which stimulates Rho to a much higher level than that is activated by ephrin-A1. Our results establish Rap1 as another downstream target of the Abl&#x02013;CrkII signaling module and show that Abl&#x02013;CrkII collaborates with Rho&#x02013;ROCK1 to stimulate cell retraction.</p></abstract></article-meta><notes><fn-group><fn><p>Abbreviations used in this paper: Doxy, doxycycline; GEF, guanine nucleotide exchange factor; LPA, lysophosphatidic acid; shRNA, small hairpin RNA.</p></fn></fn-group></notes></front><body><sec><title>Introduction</title><p>The nonreceptor tyrosine kinase Abl is ubiquitously expressed and is found in both the nucleus and the cytoplasm of mammalian cells. The nuclear Abl kinase is activated upon DNA damage to stimulate apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gong et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Wang, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Preyer et al., 2007</xref>), whereas the cytoplasmic Abl is activated by growth factors, cell adhesion, and bacterial pathogens to regulate F-actin dynamics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Woodring et al., 2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hernandez et al., 2004</xref>). Activation of cytoplasmic Abl kinase by platelet-derived growth factor or EGF enhances the activation of the small GTPase Rac and the formation of membrane ruffles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Plattner et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Sini et al., 2004</xref>). Abl-dependent activation of Rac is also observed upon infection of mouse embryonic fibroblasts with <italic>Shigella flexneri</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Burton et al., 2003</xref>). Activated Rac-GTP stimulates actin polymerization through the WASP and WAVE complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Eden et al., 2002</xref>). Previous studies have shown that Abl also stimulates F-actin microspikes and filopodia through a Rac-independent mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Woodring et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Radha et al., 2007</xref>), which may involve the direct phosphorylation of the WAVE protein by Abl, leading to the stimulation of actin polymerization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Leng et al., 2005</xref>).</p><p>Although Abl kinase stimulates actin polymerization, it inhibits cell spreading and cell migration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Frasca et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kain and Klemke, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Jin and Wang, 2007</xref>). It has been suggested that Abl kinase inhibits cell migration through tyrosine phosphorylation of CrkII (also known as Crk) to down-regulate Rac-GTP levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kain and Klemke, 2001</xref>). One of the guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) for Rac is DOCK180 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Kiyokawa et al., 1998a</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">b</xref>), which is recruited to the plasma membrane through an interaction between CrkII and p130Cas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Kiyokawa et al., 1998a</xref>). Phosphorylation of CrkII at tyrosine-221 by Abl (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Feller et al., 1994</xref>) disrupts the p130Cas&#x02013;CrkII complex, and may thus account for Abl-dependent down-regulation of Rac-GTP and the inhibition of cell migration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kain and Klemke, 2001</xref>). In breast cancer cells, EphB4 activation by ephrin-B2 causes Abl-dependent CrkII phosphorylation, which is correlated with an inhibition of cell migration and invasion in vitro and tumor growth in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Noren et al., 2006</xref>). Recently, tyrosine phosphorylation of CrkII by Abl has also been linked to the dorsal sequestration of Rac-GTP during cell spreading on fibronectin. As a result, Abl promotes dorsal ruffling at the expense of lamellipodia extension to restrain cell spreading (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Jin and Wang, 2007</xref>). Collectively, the current results suggest that the Abl&#x02013;CrkII signaling module can target different downstream effectors to exert a negative effect on cell spreading and cell migration.</p><p>The affinity and avidity of integrin receptors are regulated by a variety of factors in the process known as inside-out signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hynes, 1987</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Ginsberg et al., 2005</xref>). The small GTPase Rap1 is an important transducer of inside-out signals to activate integrins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bos et al., 1997</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">2001</xref>). One of the GEFs for Rap1 is C3G, which contains several proline-rich sequences that associate with the N-terminal SH3 domain of CrkII (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gotoh et al., 1995</xref>). Similar to DOCK180, C3G can be recruited to the plasma membrane through CrkII and p130Cas to stimulate Rap1-GTP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Ichiba et al., 1999</xref>). We show here that Abl-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation of CrkII causes the down-regulation of Rap1-GTP and a decrease in the affinity of &#x003b2;1 integrin. Interestingly, the Abl-mediated reduction in Rap1-GTP and integrin affinity is not sufficient to cause cell detachment. We have found that the Rho&#x02013;ROCK1 pathway, activated by serum factors such as lysophosphatidic acid (LPA), is also required for cells to detach from the supporting matrix. Furthermore, we show that ephrin-A1&#x02013;induced retraction of prostate cancer PC3 cells is dependent on the Abl&#x02013;CrkII and Rho&#x02013;ROCK pathways.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Activated Abl kinase induces cell detachment</title><p>We adopted the T-Rex system to express the activated AblPP protein under the control of a Tet-on promoter in HEK293 cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hillen et al., 1983</xref>). The AblPP protein contains two substitutions mutations, P242E and P249E (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Barila and Superti-Furga, 1998</xref>), which disrupt the interaction between the Abl SH3 domain and its SH2 kinase linker (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Nagar et al., 2003</xref>) and thus lead to the constitutive activation of the Abl kinase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hantschel and Superti-Furga, 2004</xref>). We also expressed a kinase-defective Abl (K290H; AblKD) from the Tet-on promoter (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 A</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Welch and Wang, 1995</xref>). The expression of AblPP or AblKD was induced with doxycycline (Doxy; <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1, B and E</xref>). As expected, the induced expression of AblPP led to an increase in the tyrosine phosphorylation of cellular proteins (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 B</xref>). Within 2 h of AblPP induction, the majority of cells (&#x0223c;80%) adopted a rounded morphology and detached from the dish (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1, C and D</xref>). The cell detachment response to Doxy was blocked by imatinib, a small molecule inhibitor of the Abl kinase (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1, C and D</xref>). Furthermore, Doxy did not induce the detachment of HEK293-AblKD cells (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1, E and F</xref>), nor did it induce the detachment of cells expressing exogenous Abl, which is autoinhibited (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Nagar et al., 2003</xref>) and unable to increase protein tyrosine phosphorylation in HEK293 cells (not depicted). These results suggest that the induced expression of an activated Abl kinase acutely interferes with cell adhesion.</p><fig position="float" id="fig1"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p><bold>Induced expression of activated Abl caused kinase-dependent cell detachment.</bold> (A) Diagram of AblPP (murine type IV) and AblKD proteins.

The host HEK293-AblPP cells were treated with 2 &#x003bc;g/ml Doxy for different lengths of time.

The expression of AblKD did not affect cell adhesion to fibronectin (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 A</xref>). In contrast, the expression of AblPP shifted the fibronectin dose&#x02013;response curve to the right, indicating reduced adhesion in cells expressing an activated Abl kinase (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 B</xref>). The HEK293 cells express &#x003b2;1 integrin, which is a receptor for fibronectin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Hynes, 2002</xref>). Consistent with reduced adhesion to fibronectin, we found that induction of AblPP caused a reduction in the affinity of &#x003b2;1 integrin (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2, C, D, and F</xref>), measured by reactivity to a monoclonal antibody B44, which detects an epitope, named ligand-induced binding site, present on active &#x003b2;1 integrin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Wilkins et al., 1996</xref>). This reduction in &#x003b2;1 integrin affinity was blocked by treatment of Doxy-induced HEK293-AblPP cells with imatinib (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 D</xref>). Under the same condition, Doxy treatment did not affect the overall levels of &#x003b2;1 integrin on the cell surface or in whole cell lysates; in addition, Doxy treatment did not affect the number of &#x003b2;1 integrins that could be artificially activated by Mn<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2, C, E, and F</xref>). Furthermore, Doxy induction of AblKD expression did not influence the reactivity of &#x003b2;1 integrin with B44 antibody (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 D</xref>). Collectively, these results show that the AblPP-induced cell detachment is associated with a decrease in the affinity of &#x003b2;1 integrin.</p><fig position="float" id="fig2"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><p><bold>Abl kinase&#x02013;dependent reduction of &#x003b2;1 integrin affinity for fibronectin.</bold> (A and B) The active Abl kinase caused a decrease in cell adhesion. Cells were treated with Doxy for 2 h. Cell adhesion was measured as described in Materials and methods. The data were from three technical repeats. The mean cell adhesion activity under 2.5 &#x003bc;g/ml fibronectin was set as 100. (C) Induction of AblPP suppresses integrin activation. HEK293-AblPP cells were stained with monoclonal antibody B44, a reporter of &#x003b2;1 integrin activation (gray histogram), after treatment with (right) or without (left) Doxy to induce AblPP expression. Negative controls were stained with secondary antibody alone (neg, black outline histogram). To ensure that integrins were not generally deficient in their capacity to activate, 200 &#x003bc;M Mn<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> was added to externally activate cell surface integrins; these positive controls were also stained with B44 antibody (gray outlined histogram). (D) The mean level of &#x003b2;1 integrin activation is lower after AblPP induction in HEK293-AblPP cells, but not after AblKD induction in HEK293-AblKD cells.

The integrin affinity measurement was performed as described in Materials and methods. (E) Induction of AblPP protein did not change the expression level of &#x003b2;1 integrins. HEK293-AblPP cells were treated with Doxy for 2 h, in the absence or presence of 5 &#x003bc;g/ml imatinib. &#x003b2;1 integrin levels were measured with anti&#x02013;&#x003b2;1 integrin antibody P4C10 by using a nonreducing gel; anti-tubulin blot was used as loading control. (F) Induction of AblPP did not change total levels of &#x003b2;1 integrins.

Because AblPP expression led to a reduction in the affinity of &#x003b2;1 integrin, we examined whether AblPP affected the levels of Rap1-GTP. We observed a consistent threefold reduction in the levels of Rap1-GTP within 2 h after treatment of HEK293-AblPP cells with Doxy (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3, A and B</xref>). Imatinib treatment abrogated the reduction in Rap1-GTP levels induced by Doxy in AblPP-expressing cells (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 C</xref>). Furthermore, the reduction in Rap1-GTP levels did not occur upon Doxy induction of AblKD expression (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 C</xref>). Ectopic expression of the constitutively active Rap1V12 largely blocked cell detachment caused by AblPP, whereas the dominant-negative Rap1N17 did not cause cell detachment without AblPP (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 D</xref>).

Because CrkII is a substrate of the Abl kinase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Feller, 2001</xref>), we tested whether AblPP could disrupt the CrkII&#x02013;C3G complex. Upon induction of AblPP, phosphorylation of the endogenous CrkII protein at tyrosine-221 was significantly increased, and treatment with imatinib abrogated this enhanced CrkII phosphorylation (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 E</xref>). As expected, C3G coimmunoprecipitated with CrkII in HEK293-AblPP cells before Doxy treatment (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 F</xref>). After Doxy induction, C3G was no longer detected in the anti-CrkII immune complex (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 F</xref>). The dissociation of C3G from CrkII was blocked by imatinib, showing the requirement of Abl kinase activity for the inhibition of C3G&#x02013;CrkII interaction (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 F</xref>). To further demonstrate that tyrosine phosphorylation of CrkII was responsible for AblPP-induced down-regulation of Rap1-GTP, we expressed the CrkII-221F mutant in HEK293-AblPP cells. We found that the expression of CrkII-221F abolished AblPP-induced cell detachment (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 G</xref>) and that CrkII-221F expression prevented the loss of Rap1-GTP after AblPP induction (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 H</xref>). The coexpression with Rap1N17 abrogated the effect of CrkII-221F and restored AblPP-induced cell detachment (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 G</xref>). Thus, AblPP-dependent phosphorylation of CrkII on Y221 causes the disruption of the CrkII&#x02013;C3G complex, the reduction in the levels of Rap1-GTP, and cell detachment.</p></sec><sec><title>Requirement of Rho and ROCK1 in cell detachment</title><p>During the course of these studies, we noticed that Doxy treatment did not cause cell detachment in serum-free media (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4, A and B</xref>), despite similar levels of induction of the AblPP protein (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 A</xref>).

It is well established that actin-myosin&#x02013;based cellular contractility is stimulated by the Rho-GTP&#x02013;activated protein kinase ROCK1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kimura et al., 1996</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">1998</xref>) and that the Rho&#x02013;ROCK1 pathway is activated by mitogenic factors such as LPA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Moolenaar, 1995</xref>). LPA binds a G protein&#x02013;coupled receptor to activate heterotrimeric G proteins (G<sub>&#x003b1;12/13</sub>), leading to the activation of the Rho&#x02013;ROCK1 pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hart et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Kozasa et al., 1998</xref>). Consistent with our hypothesis, we found that neither LPA nor Doxy alone induced rounding and detachment of the HEK293-AblPP cells, but the combined treatment (LPA plus Doxy) caused cell rounding and detachment in serum-free media (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4, C and D</xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="fig4"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><p><bold>Requirement for the Rho&#x02013;ROCK1 pathway in cell detachment.</bold> (A, left) Expression of AblPP induced the HEK293-AblPP cells to detach from supporting matrix in complete media but not in serum-free media.

Cells expressing RhoV14 underwent detachment after AblPP induction in the absence of LPA or serum (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 E</xref>), showing that constitutively active Rho could supplant the LPA or serum requirement. Furthermore, the dominant-negative RhoN19 largely, if not completely, abrogated cell detachment even when AblPP was induced in the presence of LPA or serum (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 E</xref>). An important downstream effector of Rho in contractility is the ROCK1 kinase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kimura et al., 1996</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">1998</xref>), which can be inhibited by the compound Y27362 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Fujisawa et al., 1996</xref>).

We also knocked down ROCK1 in HEK293-AblPP cells with siRNA and found that the reduction in ROCK1 significantly lowered the percentage of detached cells after AblPP induction (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4, G and H</xref>). These data provide further evidence that the Rho&#x02013;ROCK1 pathway is required for AblPP-induced cell detachment.</p></sec><sec><title>Inhibition of Rap1 and activation of Rho are independent pathways in cell detachment</title><p>Results shown in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figs. 3</xref> and <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref> suggest down-regulation of Rap1-GTP and up-regulation of Rho-GTP are both required for cell detachment after the induced expression of AblPP. We therefore tested whether AblPP could directly affect the activity of Rho and whether LPA could directly affect the activity of Rap1. As shown in <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5 A</xref>, Doxy induction of AblPP caused similar reductions in the Rap1-GTP levels in the absence or presence of serum or LPA. In contrast, LPA did not affect the levels of Rap1-GTP when AblPP was not induced. These results show that serum factors are dispensable for the inhibition of Rap1 by AblPP. In contrast, induced expression of AblPP did not increase the levels of Rho-GTP, either in the presence or the absence of serum. The activation of Rho-GTP by LPA was similarly unaffected by Doxy induction of AblPP (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5 B</xref>). These results show that AblPP does not influence Rho-GTP levels. Given the previous findings that CrkII phosphorylation is associated with the down-regulation of Rac-GTP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kain and Klemke, 2001</xref>), we also measured the levels of Rac-GTP and found that neither AblPP induction nor LPA reduced the levels of Rac-GTP in this experimental system (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5 C</xref>). Collectively, these data show that down-regulation of Rap1-GTP by activated Abl kinase and up-regulation of Rho-GTP by LPA are independent pathways, and both are required to cause cell detachment.</p><fig position="float" id="fig5"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><p><bold>Down-regulation of Rap1-GTP by activated Abl kinase is independent of Rho-GTP up-regulation by LPA.</bold> (A and B) HEK293-AblPP cells were cultured overnight and were kept in complete media (&#x0002b; serum) or changed to fresh DME (&#x02212; serum) for 2 h.

A previous paper has shown that stimulation of PC3 prostate cancer cells with ephrin-A1 reduces their adhesion to fibronectin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Miao et al., 2000</xref>). Ephrin-A1 is shown to activate the EphA2 receptor tyrosine kinase in PC3 cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Miao et al., 2000</xref>). Previous studies have also shown that Abl is a downstream effector of activated Eph family of tyrosine kinase receptors and that stimulation of EphB4 receptor in breast cancer cells leads to Abl-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation of CrkII at Y221 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Harbott and Nobes, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Pasquale, 2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Noren et al., 2006</xref>). We therefore tested if Abl kinase plays a role in ephrin-A1&#x02013;induced detachment of PC3 cells.</p><p>Stimulation of PC3 cells with Fc-conjugated ephrin-A1 induced a rapid and transient tyrosine phosphorylation of the endogenous Abl protein, peaking at 10 min and decaying by 30 min (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6, A and B</xref>). Imatinib reduced the tyrosine phosphorylation of the Abl protein, indicating autophosphorylation (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6 A</xref>). The addition of Fc-ephrin-A1 also induced a rapid and transient retraction of PC3 cells, in keeping with previous results (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Miao et al., 2000</xref>; <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6, C and D</xref>). Interestingly, imatinib reduced this retraction response by about threefold (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6, C and D</xref>), suggesting a role for Abl kinase in Fc-ephrin-A1&#x02013;induced cell rounding and detachment. Similar to the effect of AblPP in HEK293 cells, activation of the endogenous Abl kinase by Fc-ephrin-A1 caused a reduction in the levels of Rap1-GTP, and this effect was blocked by imatinib (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6 E</xref>). To further demonstrate the requirement of Abl, we stably expressed a lentiviral Abl small hairpin RNA (shRNA) or control shRNA in PC3 cells (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6 F</xref>). Treatment with Fc-ephrin-A1 reduced the B44 reactivity of &#x003b2;1 integrin in PC3 cells, and this reduction was abolished in Abl knocked down PC3 cells (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6 G</xref>). In PC3 cells, stimulation with Fc-ephrin-A1 disrupted the C3G coimmunoprecipitation with CrkII (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6 H</xref>, left panels).

Consistently, we found that the ROCK1 kinase inhibitor (Y27632) completely blocked the rounding response to Fc-ephrin-A1 in PC3 cells (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7, A and B</xref>). However, we also found that Fc-ephrin-A1&#x02013;induced cell rounding was significantly reduced in serum-free media and it could be restored by the addition of LPA (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7, C and D</xref>). We compared the effects of Fc-ephrin-A1 and LPA on the levels of Rho-GTP in serum-starved PC3 cells and found that Fc-ephrin-A1 caused a transient activation of Rho-GTP at a level that was much lower than that stimulated by LPA (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7 E</xref>). Collectively, results in <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7 (A&#x02013;E)</xref> suggest that Eph-dependent activation of Rho is not sufficient and that the additional simulation of the Rho&#x02013;ROCK1 pathway by LPA is also necessary to induce cell retraction. To rule out the possibility that high concentrations of Fc-ephrin-A1 might have caused receptor down-regulation and thus limited the levels of Rho-GTP, we tested lower concentrations and observed a similar requirement for LPA in cell detachment irrespective of Fc-ephrin-A1 concentrations (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7 F</xref>). Thus, in PC3 cells, Fc-ephrin-A1 alone was sufficient to activate Abl kinase and to reduce Rap1-GTP but not sufficient to activate the Rho&#x02013;ROCK1 pathway to a level that can induce cell rounding. To further demonstrate the separation of the Abl&#x02013;Rap1 and the Rho&#x02013;ROCK1 pathways, we show that the ROCK1 inhibitor does not block Fc-ephrin-A1&#x02013;induced disruption of the CrkII&#x02013;C3G complex (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7 G</xref>).

The mechanism of Rap1-GTP down-regulation in colon cancer cells was not determined (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Riedl et al., 2005</xref>). In breast cancer cells, it has been shown that ephrin-B2 activates Abl to phosphorylate CrkII at tyrosine-221 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Noren et al., 2006</xref>). Our results show that CrkII tyrosine phosphorylation contributes to the reduction of Rap1-GTP, via the dissociation of C3G from pY221&#x02013;CrkII. Collectively, these results support the conclusion that reduction of Rap1-GTP is an important downstream effect of Eph family receptor activation and that this reduction can be achieved through the Abl&#x02013;CrkII pathway described here as well as the direct recruitment of a Rap1-GAP to the activated receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Richter et al., 2007</xref>).</p><p>The adaptor protein CrkII forms a complex with C3G (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Tanaka et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Feller, 2001</xref>), which is a GEF for Rap1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Reedquist et al., 2000</xref>). The SH2 domain of CrkII binds to tyrosine-phosphorylated p130Cas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kain et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Holcomb et al., 2006</xref>), allowing for the recruitment of CrkII&#x02013;C3G to the plasma membrane and the activation of membrane-bound Rap1. Thus, tyrosine phosphorylation of p130Cas can lead to the activation of Rap1-GTP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gotoh et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Sakakibara et al., 2002</xref>). Previous studies have demonstrated that Y221 phosphorylation of CrkII induces an intramolecular interaction between pY221 and the SH2 domain of CrkII (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Rosen et al., 1995</xref>), thus causing the dissociation of CrkII from pTyr-p130Cas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kain and Klemke, 2001</xref>). However, this mechanism cannot explain the dissociation of C3G, which binds the CrkII SH3 domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Knudsen et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Wu et al., 1995</xref>).

It thus appears that Y221 phosphorylation not only blocks the CrkII SH2 domain but also affects the ability of CrkII SH3 domain to bind proteins such as C3G (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Feller, 2001</xref>). The mechanism underlying phosphorylation-mediated disruption of the CrkII&#x02013;C3G complex is presently unclear. A possible clue to how pY221 may disrupt the CrkII&#x02013;C3G complex is provided by previous findings that the pY221-SH2 intramolecular interaction can activate a latent SH3-binding site in the CrkII SH2 domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Anafi et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Donaldson et al., 2002</xref>). Perhaps this pY221-induced latent binding site may recruit another protein to cause the dissociation of C3G. With the overproduced AblPP protein, we have observed a kinase-dependent formation of the AblPP&#x02013;CrkII complex upon Doxy induction of HEK293-AblPP cells (Fig. S1 A, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200801192/DC1">http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200801192/DC1</ext-link>), correlating with the dissociation of C3G (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 F</xref>). Because the latent SH3-binding site in the CrkII SH2 domain can bind to the Abl SH3 domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Anafi et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Donaldson et al., 2002</xref>), the overproduced AblPP protein itself appeared to bind to pY221&#x02013;Crk and may thus contributing to the dissociation of C3G. However, we did not detect a stable CrkII&#x02013;Abl complex in PC3 cells after Fc-ephrin-A1&#x02013;induced activation of the endogenous Abl kinase (unpublished data). Therefore, we cannot attribute the dissociation of C3G from CrkII in PC3 cells to a direct competition by Abl, despite the fact that the dissociation of C3G is dependent on Abl in PC3 cells. It is conceivable that the pY221&#x02013;CrkII protein, with the exposure of the latent SH3-binding site, may participate in an alternative protein&#x02013;protein interaction to displace C3G and thus contribute to the reduction of Rap1-GTP.</p></sec><sec><title>Cell detachment as a result of Abl activation requires Rho activity</title><p>Although Abl kinase reduces the affinity of &#x003b2;1 integrin, it is not sufficient to cause cells to detach from the supporting matrix (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>). We show that the activities of the small GTPase Rho and its downstream effector ROCK1 kinase are also required for cells to round up and detach (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>). Induced expression of AblPP does not activate the Rho&#x02013;ROCK1 pathway in the absence of serum factors (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>), nor does it affect myosin light chain phosphorylation (not depicted). Instead, activation of Rho by serum factors such as LPA is required to collaborate with Abl kinase to cause cell detachment (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>). Because serum or LPA is not required for AblPP to reduce Rap1-GTP (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>), our results suggest that cell detachment occurs under conditions of Rap1-GTP down-regulation in combination with high levels of Rho-GTP (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8</xref>).</p><p>Interestingly, we show that serum or LPA also promotes Fc-ephrin-A1&#x02013;induced rounding of PC3 prostate cancer cells (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref>). Activation of the Eph family of receptors has been linked to the stimulation of Rho through several pathways in neurons and cancer cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Wahl et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Shamah et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Lawrenson et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Sahin et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Parri et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Fang et al., 2008</xref>). Those results are consistent with our finding that Fc-ephrin-A1 stimulation of PC3 cells caused a transient increase in Rho-GTP levels. However, we also show that the increase in Rho-GTP induced by Fc-ephrin-A1 in serum-free media is not sufficient to cause cell retraction. Instead, the additional and stronger activation of Rho-GTP by serum factors such as LPA is required for PC3 cells to retract. Collectively, the current literature and the results described here suggest that the limited stimulation of Rho-GTP by an activated Eph receptor may be sufficient to cause localized retraction of axons during neuronal path finding, but not enough to induce the detachment of cancer cells. Our results also call for a reexamination of previous studies on the effects of Eph receptors, because the presence or absence of serum may have contributed to the varying biological effects that have been attributed to Eph receptor activation in cell culture&#x02013;based experiments.</p></sec><sec><title>Implications on the role of Abl kinase in cell migration and tumor metastasis</title><p>The Abl protein contains an F-actin binding domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">McWhirter and Wang, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hantschel et al., 2005</xref>), and the activated Abl kinase can stimulate actin polymerization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Woodring et al., 2003</xref>). Activation of Abl upon cell adhesion to fibronectin stimulates the formation of F-actin microspikes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Woodring et al., 2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">2003</xref>) and the dorsal sequestration of Rac-GTP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Jin and Wang, 2007</xref>). Activation of Abl by growth factors stimulates the formation of membrane ruffles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Plattner et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Sini et al., 2004</xref>), and activation of Abl by bacterial pathogens promotes their uptake, a process that requires the host cellular F-actin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Burton et al., 2003</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Swimm et al., 2004</xref>). Although actin polymerization drives the forward movement of a migrating cell through lamellipodia extension at the front end, the existing data do not support a role for Abl in the stimulation of cell migration. On the contrary, Abl kinase inhibits cell migration stimulated by growth factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Frasca et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kain and Klemke, 2001</xref>); it also inhibits cell spreading stimulated by fibronectin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Jin and Wang, 2007</xref>). In our previous study on the role of Abl during cell spreading, we found that the Abl kinase activity does not affect cell adhesion to fibronectin in fibroblasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Jin and Wang, 2007</xref>). Consistent with those results, we found that the cellular Rap1-GTP levels were not affected during fibroblast spreading on fibronectin, either in the absence or the presence of Abl (Fig. S1 B). Instead, we have previously shown that Abl-dependent CrkII phosphorylation is involved in the dorsal sequestration of Rac-GTP during fibroblast spreading on fibronectin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Jin and Wang, 2007</xref>). Furthermore, although <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kain and Klemke (2001)</xref> have shown Abl-dependent CrkII phosphorylation reduces the levels of Rac-GTP in transient transfection experiments, we did not observe any reduction in Rac-GTP levels after the induced expression of AblPP in HEK293 cells (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5 C</xref>). Together, results from this and previous studies suggest that the Abl&#x02013;CrkII signaling module can exert different downstream effects on Rac-GTP or Rap1-GTP. The biological output from Abl&#x02013;CrkII appears to be modulated by the upstream signals, i.e., growth factors versus ephrins versus fibronectin, as well as by the type of cells in which the Abl&#x02013;CrkII module is activated.</p><p>Previous research has shown that the Abl&#x02013;CrkII pathway is activated by Eph family of receptor tyrosine kinases, which regulate axon guidance, angiogenesis, and tissue patterning during embryonic development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Kullander and Klein, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Pasquale, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Pasquale, 2008</xref>). Recently, Eph receptors are also shown to be involved in tumor development, with either positive or negative effects on the tumor metastatic potential (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Kinch et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Miyazaki et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Brantley-Sieders et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Saito et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Noren et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Pasquale, 2008</xref>). The negative effect of EphB4 on breast cancer cell migration and invasion has been linked to the activation of Abl and the phosphorylation of CrkII (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Noren et al., 2006</xref>). This conclusion is consistent with the inhibitory role of Abl in cell migration. However, other studies have found a positive correlation between the Abl kinase activity and the metastatic potential of breast cancer cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Srinivasan and Plattner, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Srinivasan et al., 2007</xref>). Metastasis is a complex process that requires tumor cells to escape from the tissue of origin, travel through the circulations, and colonize remote tissue sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chambers et al., 2000</xref>). Because activated Abl kinase inhibits cell migration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Woodring et al., 2003</xref>), it can interfere with tumor cell migration to distant sites; at the same time down-regulation of Rap1-GTP by activated Abl kinase may promote dissociation of tumor cells from the parent tissue. As a result, pharmacological inhibitors of the Abl kinase may block tumor cell escape from the tissue of origin but run the risk of promoting tumor migration to distant sites.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Generation of inducible cell lines</title><p>HEK293-AblPP, HEK293-Abl, and HEK293-AblKD cell lines were generated by using the T-Rex system (Invitrogen).
