RecQ proteins use the energy of ATP hydrolysis to drive DNA unwinding; however, the mechanisms by which RecQ links ATPase activity to DNA-binding/unwinding are unknown. In many Superfamily-1 (SF-1) DNA helicases, helicase sequence motif III links these activities by binding both single-stranded (ss) DNA and ATP. However, the ssDNA-binding aromatic-rich element in motif III present in these enzymes is missing from SF-2 helicases, raising the question of how these enzymes link ATP hydrolysis to DNA-binding/unwinding. We show that <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> RecQ contains a conserved aromatic-rich loop in its helicase domain between motifs II and III. Although placement of the RecQ aromatic-rich loop is topologically distinct relative to the SF-1 enzymes, both loops map to similar tertiary structural positions. We examined the functions of the <italic>E.coli</italic> RecQ aromatic-rich loop using RecQ variants with single amino acid substitutions within the segment. Our results indicate that the aromatic-rich loop in RecQ is critical for coupling ATPase and DNA-binding/unwinding activities. Our studies also suggest that RecQ's aromatic-rich loop might couple ATP hydrolysis to DNA-binding in a mechanistically distinct manner from SF-1 helicases.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>DNA helicases play central roles in essentially every pathway of DNA metabolism. These ubiquitous molecular motors couple nucleoside 5&#x02032; triphosphate (NTP) binding and hydrolysis to double stranded (ds) nucleic acid unwinding, which produces single-stranded (ss) DNA required for processes such as replication, recombination and repair. Helicases have been grouped into superfamilies based primarily upon conservation of helicase sequence motifs I, Ia, II, III, IV, V and VI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Helicase Superfamilies 1 and 2 (SF-1 and SF-2) possess all seven of these characteristic motifs; in crystal structures of SF-1 and -2 helicases these motifs line the walls of a cleft formed by the intersection of two RecA-like domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>). Motifs I and II share significant conservation between SF-1 and SF-2 helicases, whereas the remaining motifs are less highly conserved and demarcate the SF-1 and SF-2 helicases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>). Together, the helicase motifs mediate DNA-binding, NTP-binding and hydrolysis, and DNA unwinding, although for most helicases the exact manner in which the helicase motifs function in these processes are poorly understood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>).</p><p>Coordination of DNA-binding and ATP hydrolysis is a feature that appears to be uniformly conserved among DNA helicases. As a result of extensive structural and biochemical analyses, DNA-binding and ATP hydrolysis &#x02018;coupling&#x02019; roles for a number of the conserved helicase motifs have been inferred (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>). In particular, studies of the highly-homologous PcrA-related SF-1 helicases (PcrA, Rep and UvrD) have demonstrated a clear importance for motif III in linking DNA-binding to ATP hydrolysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>). In crystal structures of PcrA and Rep helicases bound to DNA, the C-terminal half of motif III forms an aromatic-rich loop that directly binds single-stranded (ss) DNA via stacking of aromatic residues with bases of the ssDNA and through electrostatic contacts between an arginine residue and the ssDNA phosphodiester backbone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B&#x02013;D</xref>). In substrate- and product-bound crystal forms of PcrA, the aromatic-rich loop is directly C-terminal to a motif III glutamine residue that contacts the ATP &#x003b3;-phosphate and a sulfate ion (thought to mimic an inorganic phosphate), respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>). These observations have led to a model in which the glutamine in motif III acts as a sensor of ATP versus ADP-binding, thereby altering DNA-binding affinity through subtle conformational changes within the aromatic-rich loop (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>). Consistent with this model, mutations made within PcrA's aromatic-rich loop lead to impairment of ATP hydrolysis, DNA-binding, duplex DNA unwinding or a combination of these deficiencies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>). Thus, it has been suggested that the PcrA aromatic-rich loop serves to couple the energy released by ATP hydrolysis to DNA unwinding through direct contacts with both the DNA substrate and ATP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>). Similarly, mutagenesis of UvrD motif III residues located upstream of its aromatic-rich loop further indicate a role for motif III in coupling ATPase function and DNA-binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>). In these studies, two residues in motif III [the equivalent phosphate-binding glutamine to that in PcrA and a nearby aspartate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>)] were individually mutated and found to decouple ATP- and DNA-binding. Similar aromatic-rich loops are found in other SF-1 helicases [e.g. RecB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>), <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>], although exceptions lacking this element also exist [e.g. RecD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>)]. Thus, substantial evidence indicates that motif III in PcrA-related enzymes (and most likely in many other SF-1 helicases) serves as a coupling element, linking DNA-binding and ATPase activities.</p><p>SF-1 helicases serve as valuable models for understanding the mechanisms of both SF-1 and SF-2 helicases. Comparison of the crystal structure of the catalytic core domain of <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> RecQ, a SF-2 helicase, to available crystal structures of PcrA and Rep has revealed many parallels among the helicases despite their membership in different superfamilies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>). However, one striking difference between RecQ and the PcrA-related structures is that motif III of RecQ does not contain an aromatic-rich loop (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). Instead, RecQ presents a surface exposed aromatic-rich loop between motifs II and III (Trp154-Arg159). While the function of this aromatic-rich loop in RecQ is not clear, its high degree of conservation among RecQ family members suggests that it plays an important role in RecQ function.</p><p>In this report, we test the hypothesis that the aromatic-rich loop in <italic>E.coli</italic> RecQ fills a similar role to that played by the analogous loop in PcrA-related helicases. Residues Trp154, Phe158 and Arg159 from the RecQ aromatic-rich loop were mutated and the variant proteins were tested for their abilities to hydrolyze ATP and bind and unwind duplex DNA. Our results indicate that the aromatic-rich loop in <italic>E.coli</italic> RecQ is important for coupling the enzyme's ATPase and DNA-binding/unwinding functions. Moreover, Trp154, Phe158 and Arg159 are all shown to contribute to RecQ's ability to translate the energy released by ATP hydrolysis into productive DNA unwinding. These data support a model in which the RecQ aromatic-rich loop couples ATP hydrolysis to DNA-binding/unwinding, akin to the aromatic-rich loops of the PcrA-related enzymes.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Subcloning, over-expression and purification of <italic>E.coli</italic> RecQ Proteins</title><p>A T7-over-expression plasmid encoding the <italic>E.coli</italic> RecQ sequence preceded by a His<sub>6</sub> affinity-purification element was described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>).

The major difference was the presence of an aromatic-rich polypeptide loop encoded between motifs II and III in RecQ that is absent from other helicase structures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). This loop is positioned at the interface between the two lobes of the enzyme's helicase domain and is highly conserved among bacterial and eukaryotic RecQ family members (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>). Interestingly, this loop is not present in other SF-2 helicases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). These features led us to postulate that the loop could be an important contributor to RecQ helicase mechanisms.</p><p>Additional searches for aromatic-rich loop segments encoded by different regions in non-RecQ helicase domains identified a loop conserved in several SF-1 helicases (PcrA, Rep, UvrD and RecB) that forms the C-terminal portion of helicase motif III (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). This loop is absent from motif III of SF-2 helicases and is not found in the structures of all SF-1 enzymes (e.g. RecD, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Motif III sequences of several other SF-1 enzymes (including <italic>E.coli</italic> TraI and <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> Dna2 and Pif1) lack an apparent aromatic-rich loop as well (data not shown). However, as with the RecQ loop, the SF-1 aromatic-rich loop is well conserved within given helicase subfamilies and maps to the cleft of the helicase domain. Furthermore, in spite of the fact that RecQ and the PcrA-related and RecB enzymes encode aromatic-rich loops in different parts of their respective primary structures, these loops map to very similar tertiary structural positions. Motif III residues found both within and outside of the aromatic-rich loop of PcrA-related enzymes have been shown to be important for coordinated ATP hydrolysis and DNA-binding/unwinding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>).

Three aromatic residues, Trp154, Phe158 and Tyr162, and one basic residue, Arg159, were converted to leucines due to predicted structural contributions of the C<sub>&#x003b1;</sub>-proximal portions of each side chain to the hydrophobic core of the protein. Arg159 was included in this panel of mutants because of a similarly placed Arg in the PcrA aromatic-rich loop (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>).</p><p>To examine whether the RecQ variants were properly folded, limited proteolysis experiments were performed on each of the purified proteins. Because the point mutations were within the catalytic core domain, it was predicted that any destabilizing effects of the mutations would lead to changes in the variant's proteolysis pattern relative to the pattern described for WT RecQ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>). In all cases but one, the proteolysis patterns were indistinguishable from that of WT RecQ (data not shown). However, the Y162L RecQ variant was rapidly proteolyzed and did not form the proteolytically resistant catalytic core domain characteristic of properly folded <italic>E.coli</italic> RecQ protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>). Thus, three of the variants appeared to be properly folded whereas the fourth, Y162L, is likely to have been improperly folded and was omitted from further biochemical analysis.</p></sec><sec><title>DNA-dependent ATPase activities of WT and variant RecQ proteins</title><p>To test the hypothesis that residues in the RecQ aromatic-rich loop are involved in ATP hydrolysis and DNA-binding, we measured the DNA-dependent ATP hydrolysis activity of the aromatic-rich loop mutants using a spectrophotometric ATPase assay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>) and compared them to WT RecQ. WT RecQ has a weak ATPase activity that is greatly stimulated by DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>). The ability of RecQ to unwind dsDNA precludes the use of dsDNA as a cofactor in this assay since ssDNA and dsDNA differ in their ability to stimulate ATP hydrolysis by RecQ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>). To circumvent this limitation, a ssDNA homopolymer cofactor (dT<sub>28</sub>) was titrated into the reactions to allow measurement of ATP hydrolysis on a homogeneous DNA structure. Consistent with previous results (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>), WT RecQ has limited ATPase activity in the absence of DNA but can be stimulated over 200-fold upon addition of DNA, reaching a rate of 1340 &#x000b1; 120 min<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A and B</xref>).</p><p>If residues within the RecQ aromatic-rich loop are involved in coupling ATP hydrolysis to DNA-binding/unwinding, we predict that mutation of these residues would lead to deficiencies in ATPase and DNA-binding/unwinding activities. Consistent with this prediction, mutation of either residue R159 or W154 produced RecQ variants that require significantly higher concentrations of dT<sub>28</sub> to stimulate their ATPase activities (<italic>K</italic><sub>DNA</sub>) relative to WT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>). Both the R159L and W154L variants also displayed reduced maximal ATPase rates at nearly saturating dT<sub>28</sub> concentrations relative to WT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>).</p><p>The F158L variant ATPase activity was radically altered relative to WT RecQ and the other variants tested. Surprisingly, the F158L variant displayed robust ATPase activity in the absence of a DNA cofactor, with a rate of 90 min<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A and B</xref>). To our knowledge this is the first observation of significant DNA-independent ATPase activity by a RecQ helicase. Addition of dT<sub>28</sub> only mildly stimulated F158L ATPase activity over its DNA-independent levels (&#x0223c;7-fold stimulation), which allowed this variant to reach a maximal rate approximately one-half that of WT. Interestingly, although the stimulatory effect of ssDNA on F158L ATPase activity was modest in comparison to that of WT, both required the same dT<sub>28</sub> concentrations for half-maximal stimulation (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>). In contrast, the R159L and W154L variants required &#x0223c;3- to 4-fold higher ssDNA concentrations for half-maximal stimulation (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>). Thus, two effects on ATPase activity were observed for the RecQ variants: (i) decreased ATPase activity with higher ssDNA concentration requirements and (ii) a gain of function in the F158L variant that led to DNA-independent ATP hydrolysis.</p></sec><sec><title>ATPase kinetics of WT and variant <italic>E.coli</italic> RecQ proteins</title><p>We next examined the variants' steady-state ATP hydrolysis kinetics to further test the role of each residue in RecQ's mechanism of ATP hydrolysis. ATP was titrated into reactions containing 100 nM dT<sub>28</sub> and 50 nM RecQ variant protein. The resulting ATPase rates were fit to the Michaelis&#x02013;Menten equation as described in Materials and Methods. The <italic>k</italic><sub>cat</sub> and <italic>K</italic><sub>m</sub> values derived for WT RecQ ATPase kinetics were 1600 &#x000b1; 200 min<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> and 120 &#x000b1; 20 &#x000b5;M, respectively (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>). All three of the RecQ variants tested displayed modestly reduced <italic>K</italic><sub>m</sub> and <italic>k</italic><sub>cat</sub> kinetic parameters relative to WT protein (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Equilibrium DNA-binding of WT and variant RecQ proteins</title><p>Each of the variant RecQ proteins tested proved to be defective in ssDNA-dependent ATP hydrolysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>), which could have resulted from an impairment of ssDNA-binding. To test this possibility, equilibrium DNA-binding studies were used to measure binding of WT and variant proteins to fluorescently labeled ssDNA substrates. Interestingly, mutation of Trp154, Phe158 or Arg159 had no measurable effect on the apparent ssDNA-binding affinity of the RecQ variants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). A partial-duplex DNA with a 3&#x02032; ssDNA tail (3&#x02032;OH) substrate was substituted for ssDNA in a similar experiment because this is the preferred substrate for WT RecQ unwinding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>). Again, the variants' abilities to bind the 3&#x02032;OH substrate were not significantly altered (data not shown). Thus, mutations in RecQ's aromatic-rich loop do not appear to significantly perturb its equilibrium DNA-binding properties.</p></sec><sec><title>Helicase activities of WT and variant RecQ</title><p>Helicase activities among the RecQ variants were compared by assessing unwinding of a radiolabeled 3&#x02032;OH substrate in the presence of 1 mM ATP/MgCl<sub>2</sub>. Because helicase activity requires proper coupling of ATP hydrolysis with DNA strand separation, unwinding assays provide a useful test of the variants' abilities to integrate these processes. Consistent with previous results (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>), WT RecQ was able to unwind a 3&#x02032;OH substrate in a concentration-dependent manner and displayed half-maximal unwinding at &#x0223c;0.01 nM enzyme (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). However, individual mutation of residues Trp154, Phe158 and Arg159 resulted in dramatically reduced unwinding activities. Of these three mutants, only the F158L variant was competent to unwind 3&#x02032;OH DNA, although it required &#x0223c;1 nM enzyme to unwind 50% of the substrate, &#x0223c;100-fold more than WT RecQ. Despite its ability to hydrolyze ATP in the absence of DNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>), the F158L variant was not able to unwind a 3&#x02032;OH substrate in the absence of ATP/Mg<sup>2+</sup> (data not shown). Neither the W154L nor the R159L variant was able to unwind the 3&#x02032;OH substrate at even the highest enzyme concentration tested (100 nM) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Limited proteolysis of WT and variant RecQ proteins with cofactors</title><p>Limited proteolysis experiments with PcrA-related helicases have shown that ssDNA and nucleotide binding protect their aromatic-rich loops from cleavage by chymotrypsin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>). Moreover, a single-site mutation in motif III in UvrD (N-terminal of the aromatic-rich loop portion of the motif) minimizes protection by nucleotide or ssDNA alone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>), indicating that ssDNA and nucleotide binding cause structural rearrangements that change the accessibility of protease-sensitive sites on the surface of these proteins. Therefore, proteases can be valuable tools for analyzing structural differences caused by mutations in helicase domains.</p><p>We used limited proteolysis to test for structural alterations induced by binding of RecQ to nucleotide or DNA cofactors. WT or variant RecQ proteins were incubated with ADP, AMPPNP (an ATP analog), a 30 nt ssDNA oligo, or a 3&#x02032;OH substrate, then subjected to proteolysis by subtilisin, trypsin or chymotrypsin. Proteolysis of free <italic>E.coli</italic> RecQ results primarily in two successive cleavage events: WT RecQ (&#x0223c;69 kDa) is first degraded to a &#x0223c;60 kDa catalytic core fragment by removal of the HRDC domain, with further proteolysis resulting in removal of &#x0223c;3 kDa from the N-terminus of the catalytic core domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>). The pattern of degradation of the free RecQ variants was identical to that of WT, although digestion of the W154L and R159L variant proteins was moderately slowed relative to the F158L variant or WT proteins (Supplementary Figure 1 and data not shown).</p><p>Previously, ADP or AMPPNP added to WT RecQ limited proteolysis reactions indicated that nucleotide addition caused an alteration in RecQ proteolysis by slowing the second proteolytic cleavage of the catalytic core (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>). To test whether residues within the RecQ aromatic-rich loop altered these proteolytic patterns, ADP or AMPPNP was added to W154L, F158L or R159L variant protein before proteolytic digestion. Each variant displayed slower digestion in the presence of nucleotide cofactor than in its absence and the resulting proteolytic patterns were indistinguishable from those observed for WT RecQ (Supplementary Figure 1 and data not shown).</p><p>We further tested whether the addition or ssDNA or 3&#x02032;OH DNA might alter WT or variant RecQ proteolysis patterns (Supplementary Figure 1 and data not shown). Again, digestion of WT and each variant protein from full-length protein to the catalytic core fragment was somewhat slowed in the presence of each DNA cofactor, but no change in the overall proteolytic pattern was observed. Therefore, the addition of nucleotide cofactors or DNA did not appear to alter the gross structure of <italic>E.coli</italic> RecQ or of the aromatic-rich loop variants.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>In this report, we tested the hypothesis that an aromatic-rich loop found in the <italic>E.coli</italic> RecQ DNA helicase couples ATP hydrolysis to DNA-binding and unwinding. This aromatic-rich loop is similar to that of well-characterized loops in several SF-1 helicases in terms of its sequence composition and relative tertiary structural position (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). A major difference between the aromatic-rich loops in the two helicase families is that the sequences are found in different positions in the enzymes' primary structures. In RecQ, the aromatic-rich loop is encoded between helicase motifs II and III, whereas the aromatic-rich loop in SF-1 helicases forms the C-terminal end of motif III. Structural and biochemical studies of PcrA and Rep show that this aromatic-rich loop is an important ssDNA-binding element and forms a critical physical linkage that couples DNA-binding and unwinding to ATP hydrolysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>). We reasoned that if the aromatic-rich loop in <italic>E.coli</italic> RecQ is functionally similar to that of PcrA, it would similarly link the enzyme's ATPase activity and its DNA-binding and unwinding functions. In support of this hypothesis, our data show that individual mutation of three different residues within this aromatic-rich loop lead to profound catalytic deficiencies, producing variants with uncoupled ATP hydrolysis and DNA unwinding activities.</p><p>Our results are consistent with a model in which the aromatic-rich loop in RecQ plays a similar role to the aromatic-rich loop in PcrA-related helicases. First, each of the mutated RecQ proteins has defects in DNA-dependent ATP hydrolysis and either requires higher concentrations of ssDNA to stimulate activity (W154L and R159L) or displays a greatly reduced need for DNA as a cofactor in ATPase activity (F158L) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). Since each RecQ variant binds ssDNA with apparent WT affinity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>) and binds and hydrolyzes ATP with similar maximal efficiencies to that of WT RecQ (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>), the effect of the mutations appears to be a coupling deficiency in which DNA-binding inefficiently triggers ATP hydrolysis. Second, each of the three mutations produces a RecQ variant with greatly reduced DNA helicase activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>), despite the fact that these proteins are competent to bind the partial-duplex substrate with WT affinity and can hydrolyze ATP. Thus, mutations in RecQ's aromatic-rich loop greatly impair the enzyme's ability to productively use the energy of ATP hydrolysis for DNA unwinding. With some exceptions described below, these effects are similar to those seen in aromatic-rich loop mutations within PcrA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>).</p><p>In spite of the structural similarities between the aromatic-rich loops of RecQ and PcrA-related enzymes and the functional similarities described in this report, there are some clear differences between the two loops that imply they have overlapping but non-identical functions. First, mutations of the aromatic-rich loop in RecQ do not affect binding affinity for ssDNA or 3&#x02032;OH, whereas similar mutations in PcrA lead to DNA-binding defects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>). This difference implies that the aromatic-rich loop does not constitute the major DNA-binding determinant in RecQ, but instead other elements of the structure, such as the RecQ-Ct and HRDC domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>), could form the major contact surfaces. Though it is possible that combinations of the single-site mutations could lead to a measurable difference in DNA-binding affinity, it appears that a simple DNA-binding defect cannot account for the differences in DNA-dependent ATPase and helicase activities of the variants. Second, the F158L variant has a significant DNA-independent ATPase activity, in stark contrast to the strong DNA dependence of WT RecQ ATPase activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A and B</xref>). To our knowledge, similar mutants have not been observed in PcrA-related or other SF-1 helicases. Interestingly, both the W154L and R159L mutations also appear to mildly stimulate DNA-independent ATPase activity over WT RecQ, although to a much lesser degree than that displayed by the F158L variant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). These results suggest that a DNA cofactor acts with RecQ to facilitate ATP hydrolysis, perhaps through a DNA-dependent conformational change in the protein that is mediated by the aromatic-rich loop. This structural alteration must be subtle, since we did not detect large-scale conformational changes induced by mutation or DNA-binding (Supplementary Figure 1 and data not shown). The ability of the F158L variant to hydrolyze ATP independently of a DNA cofactor could indicate that this variant mimics a DNA-bound state of RecQ. Together, these data imply that the RecQ aromatic-rich loop suppresses the enzyme's intrinsic ATPase activity, and that DNA-binding or mutation of the aromatic-rich loop releases this suppression. A third difference is that, unlike the aromatic-rich loop in PcrA, the aromatic-rich loop in RecQ does not directly contact nucleotide in the structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>). This implies that the functions of the aromatic-rich loop in RecQ are likely to be indirect, and that subtle conformational changes within the aromatic-rich loop could allosterically activate the ATP hydrolysis active site. Alternatively, DNA-binding-induced conformational changes in the aromatic-rich loop could alter its position relative to ATP, allowing elements of the loop to directly participate in the ATP binding or hydrolysis, or could alter the position of motif II (adjacent to the aromatic-rich loop) to enhance its role in RecQ ATPase function. In addition, since the active oligomeric state of RecQ proteins remains unclear (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>), it is also possible that the aromatic-rich loop acts <italic>in trans</italic> to activate ATP hydrolysis across a homotypic interface.</p><p>Based on the results presented here, we propose a model for the role of the aromatic-rich loop in RecQ's mechanism of DNA unwinding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). Comparison of the crystal structures of apo- and ATP&#x003b3;S-bound RecQ shows only minor conformational differences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>), indicating that, before DNA contact, RecQ is competent to bind ATP. Hydrolysis of ATP in this state is very weak (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). When RecQ binds a partial-duplex substrate such as 3&#x02032;OH DNA, the duplex portion of the DNA is thought to bind to the RecQ-Ct domain of the protein with the 3&#x02032; ssDNA tail binding across the face of the helicase domain as has been observed in other helicase structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>). A model depicting this putative association is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>. Our proposed mechanism predicts that ssDNA-binding to the RecQ helicase domain involves interaction between the DNA and the aromatic-rich loop and that, upon binding DNA, the loop conformation is subtly altered. As the conformation of the aromatic-rich loop is altered, the relative orientations of the two helicase lobes could also be altered, causing the enzyme to assume a conformation that is competent to hydrolyze the bound ATP. The specifics of this reorientation are unclear and could depend upon interactions between the aromatic-rich loop and the second major helicase domain (&#x02018;Lobe 2&#x02019; in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). Consistent with this hypothesis, a hydrogen bond contact between a residue in the aromatic-rich loop and helicase motif VI of the second helicase domain is observed in the ATP&#x003b3;S-bound but not the apo-RecQ crystal structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>), indicating that the aromatic-rich loop can conditionally link the two domains. Upon ATP hydrolysis and/or ADP release, the two helicase domain lobes could reorient and, in the process, translocate the enzyme along the ssDNA tail, unwinding the duplex DNA at a site distal to the aromatic-rich loop. DNA can interact once more with the aromatic-rich loop, thereby resetting the translocation cycle. This model is largely based on the inchworm model proposed for PcrA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>) in which residues from the aromatic-rich loop slide along the unwound ssDNA between each unwinding step and interact with the DNA during translocation.</p><p>In this report, we have presented evidence that <italic>E.coli</italic> RecQ uses an aromatic-rich loop within its helicase domain to couple ATP hydrolysis to DNA-binding/unwinding and have proposed a model wherein aromatic residues in the RecQ aromatic-rich loop stack with nucleotide bases of ssDNA. This idea is in contrast to other proposed SF-2 helicase mechanisms that rely primarily on protein interactions with the nucleic acid backbone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref>) and instead resembles the proposed mechanisms of SF-1 helicases. Consistent with our model, two human RecQ proteins have also been recently proposed to act via SF-1-like mechanisms based on inhibition of their unwinding activities on DNA substrates with reduced backbone flexibility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref>). RecQ proteins may therefore act in a manner that is distinct from other SF-2 helicases. Further studies examining the structural basis of RecQ DNA-binding and unwinding will be necessary to better define its precise mechanism of action.</p></sec><sec><title>SUPPLEMENTARY DATA</title><p>Supplementary Data are available at NAR Online.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material id="PMC_1" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>[Supplementary Material]</title></caption><media mimetype="text" mime-subtype="html" xlink:href="nar_33_22_6982__index.html"/><media xlink:role="associated-file" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="nar_33_22_6982__1.pdf"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank C.E.
