Here we show that activation of <italic>INO1</italic> occurs at the nuclear membrane and requires the integral membrane protein Scs2. Scs2 antagonizes the action of the transcriptional repressor Opi1 under conditions that induce the unfolded protein response (UPR) and, in turn, activate <italic>INO1</italic>. Whereas repressed <italic>INO1</italic> localizes throughout the nucleoplasm, the gene is recruited to the nuclear periphery upon transcriptional activation. Recruitment requires the transcriptional activator Hac1, which is produced upon induction of the UPR, and is constitutive in a strain lacking Opi1. Artificial recruitment of <italic>INO1</italic> to the nuclear membrane permits activation in the absence of Scs2, indicating that the intranuclear localization of a gene can profoundly influence its mechanism of activation.

More recently, three-dimensional fluorescence microscopy studies have established that chromosomes are organized into distinct, evolutionarily conserved subnuclear territories (reviewed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020342-Cockell1">Cockell and Gasser &#x0005b;1999&#x0005d;</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020342-Isogai1">Isogai and Tjian &#x0005b;2003&#x0005d;</xref>).

Recent studies suggest that the subnuclear localization of genes can have dramatic effects on their chromatin state, rate of recombination, and transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020342-Cockell1">Cockell and Gasser 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020342-Isogai1">Isogai and Tjian 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020342-Bressan1">Bressan et al. 2004</xref>). Heterochromatin, for example, is generally found concentrated in close proximity to the nuclear envelope. Several genes conditionally colocalize with heterochromatin under conditions in which they are repressed. The transcriptional regulator Ikaros, for example, interacts both with regulatory sequences upstream of target genes and with repeats enriched at centromeric heterochromatin. When repressed, these genes become colocalized with heterochromatin, suggesting that Ikaros promotes repression by directly recruiting target genes into close proximity with heterochromatin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020342-Brown2">Brown et al. 1997</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020342-Brown1">1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020342-Cobb1">Cobb et al. 2000</xref>). Consistent with this view, euchromatic sequences that become colocalized with heterochromatin are transcriptionally silenced (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020342-Csink1">Csink and Henikoff 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020342-Dernburg1">Dernburg et al. 1996</xref>).</p><p>In <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae,</italic> genes localized in proximity to telomeres are similarly transcriptionally silenced (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020342-Gottschling1">Gottschling et al. 1990</xref>). Silencing is due to Rap1-dependent recruitment of Sir proteins to telomeres (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020342-Gotta1">Gotta et al. 1996</xref>), which promotes local histone deacetylation and changes in chromatin structure (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020342-Rusche1">Rusche et al. &#x0005b;2003&#x0005d;</xref>). Physical tethering of telomeres at the nuclear periphery through interactions with the nuclear pore is required for silencing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020342-Gotta1">Gotta et al. 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020342-Laroche1">Laroche et al. 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020342-Galy1">Galy et al. 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020342-Feuerbach1">Feuerbach et al. 2002</xref>). When a reporter gene flanked by silencer motifs was relocated more than 200 kb away from a telomere, silencing was lost (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020342-Maillet1">Maillet et al. 1996</xref>). Silencing was restored to this gene by overexpression of <italic>SIR</italic> genes. Therefore it is thought that tethering serves to promote efficient recruitment of Sir proteins, which are enriched at the nuclear periphery and limiting elsewhere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020342-Maillet1">Maillet et al. 1996</xref>). Another example of gene silencing at the nuclear periphery comes from experiments in which defects in the silencer of the <italic>HMR</italic> locus could be suppressed by artificially tethering this locus to the nuclear membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020342-Andrulis1">Andrulis et al. 1998</xref>). Thus, localization of chromatin to the nuclear periphery has been proposed to play a major role in transcriptional repression.</p><p>By contrast, we report here that dynamic recruitment of genes to the nuclear membrane can have profound effects on their activation. The gene under study here is <italic>INO1,</italic> a target gene of the unfolded protein response (UPR), which encodes inositol 1-phosphate synthase. The UPR is an intracellular signaling pathway that is activated by the accumulation of unfolded proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), which can be stimulated by treatment with drugs that block protein folding or modification or, in yeast, by starvation for inositol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020342-Cox3">Cox et al. 1997</xref>). These conditions activate Ire1, a transmembrane ER kinase/endoribonuclease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020342-Cox2">Cox et al. 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020342-Mori1">Mori et al. 1993</xref>), which, through its endonuclease activity, initiates nonconventional splicing of the mRNA encoding the transcription activator Hac1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020342-Cox1">Cox and Walter 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020342-Shamu1">Shamu and Walter 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020342-Kawahara1">Kawahara et al. 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020342-Sidrauski1">Sidrauski and Walter 1997</xref>). Only spliced <italic>HAC1</italic> mRNA is translated to produce the transcription factor; the Ire1-mediated splicing reaction, therefore, constitutes the key switch step in the UPR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020342-Sidrauski2">Sidrauski et al. 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020342-Ruegsegger1">Ruegsegger et al. 2001</xref>).</p><p>Hac1 is a basic-leucine zipper transcription factor that binds directly to unfolded protein response elements (UPREs) in the promoters of most target genes to promote transcriptional activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020342-Cox1">Cox and Walter 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020342-Travers1">Travers et al. 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020342-Patil1">Patil et al. 2004</xref>). However, a subset of UPR target genes uses a different mode of activation. Transcriptional activation of these genes, including <italic>INO1,</italic> depends on Hac1 and Ire1. These target genes contain an upstream activating sequence that is regulated by the availability of inositol, the UAS<sc>INO</sc> element, in their promoters that is repressed by Opi1 under non-UPR conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020342-Greenberg1">Greenberg et al. 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020342-Cox3">Cox et al. 1997</xref>). Opi1 repression is relieved in a Hac1-dependent manner upon induction of the UPR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020342-Cox3">Cox et al. 1997</xref>). Positively acting transcription factors Ino2 and Ino4 then promote transcription from UAS<sc>INO</sc>-containing promoters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020342-Loewy1">Loewy and Henry 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020342-Ambroziak1">Ambroziak and Henry 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020342-Schwank2">Schwank et al. 1995</xref>). Our previous work established that the production of Hac1 by UPR induction functions upstream of Opi1, suggesting that the role of the UPR is to counteract Opi1-mediated repression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020342-Cox3">Cox et al. 1997</xref>).</p><p>To understand the regulation of UAS<sc>INO</sc>-controlled genes by the UPR, we have examined the molecular events leading to the activation of <italic>INO1</italic>. We find that Scs2, an integral protein of the nuclear and ER membrane that was recently shown to play a role in telomeric silencing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020342-Craven1">Craven and Petes 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020342-Cuperus1">Cuperus and Shore 2002</xref>), is required to activate <italic>INO1</italic>. We observe dynamic <italic>INO1</italic> recruitment to the nuclear membrane under activating conditions. Importantly, we find that recruitment requires Hac1 and is opposed by Opi1. Furthermore, we show that artificial recruitment of <italic>INO1</italic> to the nuclear membrane can bypass the requirement for Scs2. Gene recruitment to the nuclear membrane therefore plays an instrumental role in <italic>INO1</italic> activation.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Abundance and Localization of the Transcriptional Regulators Ino2, Ino4, and Opi1 Are Unaffected by UPR Induction</title><p>To characterize the molecular basis of transcriptional activation of <italic>INO1,</italic> we first asked whether the steady-state levels of the known transcriptional regulators&#x02014;the activators Ino2 and Ino4 and the repressor Opi1&#x02014;were affected by induction of the UPR. To this end, we monitored the levels of <italic>myc</italic>-tagged proteins by Western blotting after UPR induction by inositol starvation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020342-g001">Figure 1</xref>A). Induction of the UPR did not result in a significant change of the abundance of any of the proteins. Thus, in contrast to what has been suggested in previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020342-Ashburner1">Ashburner and Lopes 1995a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020342-Ashburner2">1995b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020342-Cox3">Cox et al. 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020342-Schwank1">Schwank et al. 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020342-Wagner1">Wagner et al. 1999</xref>), <italic>INO1</italic> transcription is not regulated through adjustment of the abundance of these regulators.</p><p>Next, we tested whether the subcellular localization of these regulators is modulated. We examined the localization of <italic>myc</italic>-tagged Opi1, Ino2, and Ino4 by indirect immunofluorescence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020342-g001">Figure 1</xref>A). Again, we observed no significant change upon UPR induction: Ino2 and Ino4 localized to the nucleus under both repressing and activating conditions. Localization of Opi1 also showed no change. Like Ino2 and Ino4, Opi1 localized to the nucleus under both conditions. However, in agreement with recent data by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020342-Loewen1">Loewen et al. (2003)</xref>, we found that Opi1 was concentrated at the nuclear membrane and diffusely distributed throughout the nucleoplasm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020342-g001">Figure 1</xref>A). Furthermore, coimmunoprecipitation experiments showed that Ino2 and Ino4 heterodimerize under both conditions, suggesting that this interaction is not regulated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020342-g001">Figure 1</xref>B). Taken together, these observations therefore pose an interesting puzzle: How is regulation achieved when the localization and abundance of all three regulators is unchanged between activating and repressing conditions?</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Opi1 Is Regulated by an Integral ER/Nuclear Membrane Protein</title><p>To begin to explore a possible functional significance of Opi1's unusual localization pattern at the nuclear membrane, we sought to identify binding partners that might tether Opi1 to the membrane.

To confirm that Scs2 and Opi1 interact, we performed coimmunoprecipitation analysis from extracts of strains expressing <italic>myc</italic>-tagged Opi1 and hemagglutinin (HA)-tagged Scs2. We observed specific recovery of Scs2-HA in Opi1-<italic>myc</italic> immunoprecipitates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020342-g001">Figure 1</xref>D).

Therefore, either Scs2 is the downstream target of Opi1-mediated repression, or Scs2 functions upstream to relieve Opi1-mediated repression. To distinguish between these possibilities, we analyzed the growth of the double mutant in the absence of inositol. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020342-g001">Figure 1</xref>E, <italic>opi1</italic>&#x00394; cells grew in absence of inositol because <italic>INO1</italic> is constitutively expressed.

To monitor the interaction of Ino2 and Ino4 with the <italic>INO1</italic> promoter in vivo, we used chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020342-Solomon1">Solomon et al. 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020342-Dedon1">Dedon et al. 1991</xref>).

Real-time quantitative PCR analysis of immunoprecipitated DNA confirmed that both Ino2 and Ino4 associated with the <italic>INO1</italic> promoter constitutively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020342-g002">Figure 2</xref>B). Although we observed an increase in the association of Ino2 with the <italic>INO1</italic> promoter under inducing conditions compared with repressing conditions, these results argue that occupancy of the promoter by Ino2/Ino4 is not sufficient for activation but that it must be a subsequent step in the activation process that is regulated by the UPR.</p><p>The molecular mechanism by which Opi1 represses transcription is not understood. In particular, it is not clear whether Opi1 binds to the <italic>INO1</italic> promoter directly. Early gel-shift experiments using yeast lysates suggested that Opi1 might interact with DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020342-Lopes1">Lopes and Henry 1991</xref>). However, this association has not been confirmed, and its significance is unknown. We used ChIP analysis and real-time quantitative PCR to assess the interaction of Opi1 with the <italic>INO1</italic> promoter in vivo. We observed specific enrichment of the <italic>INO1</italic> promoter by immunoprecipitation of Opi1 from cells grown in the presence of inositol (repressing condition) but no significant enrichment of the <italic>INO1</italic> promoter by immunoprecipitation of Opi1 from cells starved for inositol (activating condition; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020342-g003">Figure 3</xref>). By contrast, when we performed the immunoprecipitations from either <italic>hac1</italic>&#x00394; or <italic>scs2</italic>&#x00394; strains, we observed greater enrichment of the <italic>INO1</italic> promoter sequences from cells grown under both activating and repressing conditions. These results are consistent with the notion that Opi1 binds to chromatin at the <italic>INO1</italic> promoter and that the function of Hac1 and Scs2 is to promote Opi1 dissociation.</p><p>In contrast to immunoprecipitation of Ino2 and Ino4, which specifically recovered the <italic>INO1</italic> promoter and not the control <italic>URA3</italic> sequences (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020342-g002">Figure 2</xref>), immunoprecipitates of Opi1 recovered significant amounts of <italic>URA3</italic> sequences as well (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020342-g003">Figure 3</xref>A, upper bands). It is clear from the quantitative PCR analysis that Opi1 binding to the <italic>INO1</italic> promoter is specific (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020342-g003">Figure 3</xref>B). The different conditions used in the qualitative gel analysis (measuring PCR products after many cycles) and the quantitative PCR (measuring PCR products in the linear range of amplification) are likely to account for this difference.</p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>The <italic>INO1</italic> Gene Relocalizes within the Nucleus upon UPR Activation</title><p>Since Opi1 dissociation from the <italic>INO1</italic> promoter correlates with activation and requires Hac1 and Scs2, an integral nuclear membrane protein, we wondered whether activation might occur at the nuclear periphery and thus might be dependent on the subnuclear positioning of the gene. Consistent with this hypothesis, we found that a form of Scs2 (Scs2&#x00394;TMD) lacking the transmembrane domain, which was localized throughout the cell and was not excluded from the nucleus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020342-g004">Figure 4</xref>A, compare cytosolic protein Rps2 to Scs2&#x00394;TMD for colocalization with 4&#x02032;,6&#x02032;-diamidino-2-phenylindole), and was nonfunctional, rendering cells inositol auxotrophs, despite being expressed at levels comparable to full length Scs2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020342-g004">Figure 4</xref>B and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020342-g004">4</xref>C).</p><p>If <italic>INO1</italic> were regulated at the nuclear periphery, then the <italic>INO1</italic> locus should colocalize with the nuclear membrane under activating conditions. To test this idea, we constructed a strain in which an array of Lac operator (Lac O in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020342-g005">Figure 5</xref>) binding sites was integrated adjacent to the <italic>INO1</italic> locus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020342-Robinett1">Robinett et al. 1996</xref>).

In a control strain, we integrated the same Lac operator array adjacent to the <italic>URA3</italic> locus. Cells were fixed and GFP was visualized by indirect immunofluorescence. Most cells showed a single intranuclear spot localizing the tagged gene; the remaining cells showed two spots due to their post-replication state in the cell cycle.

Using confocal microscopy, we collected a single z slice through each cell that captured the brightest, most focused point of the GFP-visualized Lac operator array. Images in which this slice traversed the nucleus (i.e., cells that showed a clear nuclear membrane ring staining with a "hole" of nucleoplasm), were binned into two groups: Cells in which the peak of the spot corresponding to the tagged gene coincided with nuclear membrane staining were scored as membrane-associated, and cells in which the peak of the spot corresponding to the tagged gene was offset from nuclear membrane staining were scored as nucleoplasmic. This procedure allowed us to determine the fraction of cells in a given population in which the tagged gene colocalized with the membrane, thus providing a quantitative measure for membrane association. Five examples of each group, with fluorescence intensity plotted along a line bisecting the nucleus and the spot, are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020342-g005">Figure 5</xref>A.</p><p>To confirm that our scoring criterion would identify nuclear membrane association in a meaningful way, we applied it to two controls. As a control for membrane association, we localized <italic>INO1</italic> in a strain expressing GFP-Lac repressor fused to a peptide motif from Opi1 containing two phenylalanines in an acidic tract (FFAT motif), which serves as a nuclear membrane&#x02013;targeting signal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020342-Loewen1">Loewen et al. 2003</xref>). This motif was shown to bind to Scs2 and to be required for Opi1 targeting to the nuclear envelope (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020342-Loewen1">Loewen et al. 2003</xref>). Importantly, targeting of Opi1 to the nuclear membrane still occurred in the absence of Scs2 in an FFAT-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020342-Loewen1">Loewen et al. 2003</xref>), indicating that, in addition to Scs2, there must exist another, yet-unidentified receptor for FFAT in the nuclear membrane. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020342-g005">Figure 5</xref>B, the localization of <italic>INO1</italic> scored as 85&#x00025; membrane-associated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020342-g005">Figure 5</xref>B, bar 1), confirming both our scoring criteria and the previous result that FFAT indeed promotes nuclear membrane targeting.</p><p>As a control for random distribution, we localized <italic>URA3</italic> in a strain expressing GFP-Lac repressor without the FFAT targeting signal. <italic>URA3</italic> scored as 23&#x00025; membrane-associated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020342-g005">Figure 5</xref>B, bar 3).

Given that 25&#x00025; of the volume of the nucleus is contained in the outer shell represented by only 10&#x00025; of the radius, this level of background is consistent with a random distribution of the <italic>URA3</italic> gene throughout the nuclear volume. Based on the spatial resolution of our data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020342-g005">Figure 5</xref>A), a spot only 10&#x00025; of the radius distant from the membrane signal would have been scored as membrane-associated. We therefore defined the mean frequency of membrane-association of the <italic>URA3</italic> control between these two conditions (25&#x00025; &#x000b1; 3&#x00025;) as the baseline for subsequent comparisons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020342-g005">Figure 5</xref>B, dashed line).</p><p>We next compared the membrane association of <italic>INO1</italic> under repressing and activating conditions.

In striking contrast, when <italic>INO1</italic> was activated, the frequency of membrane association of <italic>INO1</italic> increased significantly over baseline (52&#x00025; &#x000b1; 3&#x00025;; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020342-g005">Figure 5</xref>B, bar 6). Thus, we conclude that, in a significant portion of cells, the <italic>INO1</italic> gene became associated with the nuclear membrane under UPR-inducing conditions.</p><p>To confirm that the observed recruitment was indeed due to UPR induction, we compared the membrane association of <italic>INO1</italic> under repressing or activating conditions in the <italic>hac1</italic>&#x00394; mutant. Because Hac1 is required for activation of <italic>INO1,</italic> we predicted that membrane association would be prevented in this mutant. Indeed, <italic>INO1</italic> failed to become membrane associated in <italic>hac1</italic>&#x00394; mutants starved for inositol (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020342-g005">Figure 5</xref>B, bars 7 and 8). Our earlier experiments suggested that Hac1 functions to promote dissociation of Opi1 from the <italic>INO1</italic> promoter. We therefore tested next whether the presence of Opi1 prevents membrane association. To this end, we determined <italic>INO1</italic> localization in the <italic>opi1</italic>&#x00394; strain, in which <italic>INO1</italic> is constitutively transcribed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020342-Cox3">Cox et al. 1997</xref>).

To establish causality, we examined the effect of artificially targeting <italic>INO1</italic> to the nuclear membrane. In an otherwise wild-type background, artificial targeting of <italic>INO1</italic> to the nuclear membrane via FFAT-Lac repressor binding (same strain as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020342-g005">Figure 5</xref>B, bars 1 and 2) had no effect on <italic>INO1</italic> expression as assessed by Northern blot analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020342-g006">Figure 6</xref>A) or on the growth of the wild-type strain in the absence of inositol (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020342-g006">Figure 6</xref>B; compare top two panels). This result suggests that membrane targeting per se is not sufficient to cause activation. In contrast, in the <italic>scs2</italic>&#x00394; mutant we observed that the inositol-requiring growth phenotype of the strain was suppressed by expression of the membrane-targeted FFAT-Lac repressor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020342-g006">Figure 6</xref>B; compare bottom two panels). This effect was strictly dependent on having the Lac operator array integrated at the <italic>INO1</italic> locus; expressing GFP-FFAT-Lac repressor in the absence of the array (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020342-g006">Figure 6</xref>C)&#x02014;or if the array was integrated at the <italic>URA3</italic> locus (unpublished data)&#x02014;did not improve the growth of the <italic>scs2</italic>&#x00394; mutant in the absence of inositol. Consistent with the previous report that FFAT does not require Scs2 to promote nuclear membrane targeting, we observed approximately 50&#x00025; membrane association of <italic>INO1</italic> in the strain expressing the FFAT-Lac repressor (78 cells counted, unpublished data). Thus, the defect in transcription of <italic>INO1</italic> in the <italic>scs2</italic>&#x00394; mutant could be rescued, at least partially, through artificial targeting of <italic>INO1</italic> to the nuclear membrane. This result demonstrates that nuclear membrane association is functionally important for achieving <italic>INO1</italic> transcriptional activation.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Discussion</title><p>It is becoming increasingly clear that the spatial arrangement of chromosomes within the nucleus is important for controlling the reactions that occur on DNA and might be regulated (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020342-Cockell1">Cockell and Gasser &#x0005b;1999&#x0005d;</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020342-Isogai1">Isogai and Tjian &#x0005b;2003&#x0005d;</xref>).

It is clear from numerous microscopic and biochemical studies that chromatin interacts with nuclear membrane proteins, associated proteins such as filamentous lamins, and nuclear pore complexes (DuPraw, 1965; Murray and Davies, 1979; Paddy, 1990; Worman et al., 1990; Belmont et al., 1993; Glass et al., 1993; Foisner and Gerace, 1993; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020342-Sukegawa1">Sukegawa and Blobel, 1993</xref>; Luderus et al., 1994; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020342-Dernburg1">Marshall et al., 1996</xref>). Indeed, several transcriptionally regulated genes have been shown to colocalize with heterochromatin at the nuclear periphery when repressed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020342-Csink1">Csink and Henikoff 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020342-Dernburg1">Dernburg et al. 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020342-Brown2">Brown et al. 1997</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020342-Brown1">1999</xref>). Likewise, silencing of genes near telomeres requires physical tethering of telomeres to nuclear pore complexes at the nuclear periphery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020342-Gotta1">Gotta et al. 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020342-Maillet1">Maillet et al. 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020342-Andrulis1">Andrulis et al. 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020342-Laroche1">Laroche et al. 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020342-Galy1">Galy et al. 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020342-Andrulis2">Andrulis et al. 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020342-Feuerbach1">Feuerbach et al. 2002</xref>).</p><p>Thus, the nuclear periphery has been generally regarded as a transcriptionally repressive environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020342-Gotta1">Gotta et al. 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020342-Maillet1">Maillet et al. 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020342-Andrulis1">Andrulis et al. 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020342-Laroche1">Laroche et al. 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020342-Galy1">Galy et al. 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020342-Andrulis2">Andrulis et al. 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020342-Feuerbach1">Feuerbach et al. 2002</xref>). In contrast, the work presented here shows that gene recruitment to the nuclear periphery can be important for transcriptional activation. This conclusion is supported by a recent study published while this manuscript was in preparation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020342-Casolari1">Casolari et al. 2004</xref>). These authors found that a subset of actively transcribed genes associates with components of nuclear pore complexes and that activation of <italic>GAL</italic> genes correlates with their recruitment from the nucleoplasm to the nuclear periphery and pore-complex protein association (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020342-Casolari1">Casolari et al. 2004</xref>). The results presented here argue that recruitment of genes to the nuclear periphery is controlled by transcriptional regulators and is important for achieving transcriptional activation. Thus, together, the work by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020342-Casolari1">Casolari et al. (2004)</xref> and the work presented here demonstrate that gene recruitment to the nuclear periphery can have a general role in activating transcription.</p><p>This notion is consistent with the &#x0201c;gene gating hypothesis&#x0201d; put forward by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020342-Blobel1">Blobel (1985)</xref>. As proposed in this hypothesis, transcription of certain genes may be obligatorily coupled to mRNA export through a particular nuclear pore complex. It remains to be shown for <italic>INO1,</italic> however, whether gene recruitment to the nuclear periphery involves interaction with nuclear pore complex components. Several other scenarios could explain why <italic>INO1</italic> activation might require gene recruitment to the nuclear periphery. First, <italic>INO1</italic> transcriptional activation requires the SAGA histone acetylase, and both the SWI/SNF and INO80 chromatin remodeling complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020342-Kodaki1">Kodaki et al. 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020342-Pollard1">Pollard and Peterson 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020342-Ebbert1">Ebbert et al. 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020342-Shen1">Shen et al. 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020342-Dietz1">Dietz et al. 2003</xref>). Conversely, repression requires the Sin3/Rpd3 histone deacetylase and the ISW chromatin remodeling complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020342-Hudak1">Hudak et al. 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020342-Sugiyama1">Sugiyama and Nikawa 2001</xref>). Thus, if these factors have distinct subnuclear distributions, then the localization of genes regulated by them might influence their transcriptional state. Consistent with this notion, the SAGA complex interacts with nuclear pore complexes, and therefore might be concentrated at the nuclear periphery, where <italic>INO1</italic> activation occurs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020342-Rodriguez-Navarro1">Rodriguez-Navarro et al. 2004</xref>). Second, because <italic>INO1</italic> and many other UAS<sc>INO</sc>-regulated genes are involved in the biosynthesis of phospholipids, it is possible that the state of the membrane itself plays a role, perhaps sensed by Scs2, in activating transcription. It has been shown that defects in phospholipids biosynthesis can disrupt regulation of <italic>INO1,</italic> although the mechanism of this regulation remains unknown (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020342-Greenberg1">Greenberg et al. 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020342-McGraw1">McGraw and Henry 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020342-Griac2">Griac et al. 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020342-Griac1">Griac 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020342-Shirra1">Shirra et al. 2001</xref>). Third, inositol polyphosphates have been shown to regulate SWI/SNF-catalyzed chromatin remodeling, and it is possible that their production is spatially restricted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020342-Shen2">Shen et al. 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020342-Steger1">Steger et al. 2003</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3b"><title>Role of Factors Regulating <italic>INO1</italic> Activation</title><p>Our current understanding of <italic>INO1</italic> activation is summarized in a model in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020342-g007">Figure 7</xref>. The positive transcription activators Ino2 and Ino4 constitutively associate with the <italic>INO1</italic> promoter, which is kept transcriptionally repressed by Opi1. We do not currently understand the mechanism by which Opi1 prevents activation. Activation of the UPR leads to the production of Hac1, which, by an unknown mechanism, promotes Opi1 dissociation from chromatin. We propose that Scs2 at the nuclear membrane binds to Opi1 released from the DNA and thus keeps Opi1 sequestered and prevented from rebinding. Indeed, overproduction of Scs2 bypasses the requirement for Hac1 in activation of <italic>INO1</italic> transcription and allows <italic>hac1</italic>&#x00394; cells to grow in the absence of inositol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020342-Nikawa1">Nikawa et al. 1995</xref>), supporting the role of Scs2 as a sink for Opi1 and suggesting that Opi1 may cycle between chromatin-bound and free states.</p><p>Both Hac1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020342-Cox3">Cox et al. 1997</xref>) and Scs2 (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020342-g001">Figure 1</xref>) are dispensable for <italic>INO1</italic> activation in the absence of Opi1, suggesting that their role is to relieve Opi1 repression. However, our data suggest that Hac1 and Scs2 have distinct functions: While the absence of either protein prevents the dissociation of Opi1 from chromatin and the activation of <italic>INO1,</italic> we propose that the role of Hac1 is to promote dissociation and that of Scs2 is to prevent reassociation. This model explains why artificially tethering <italic>INO1</italic> to the nuclear membrane suppresses the absence of Scs2 but not the absence of Hac1 (unpublished data): We propose that the environment of membrane-tethered <italic>INO1</italic> promotes late steps in the transcription activation&#x02014;such as chromatin remodeling, discussed above&#x02014;permitting <italic>INO1</italic> to be expressed upon transient Hac1-induced Opi1 dissociation. Therefore, we envision that dissociation of Opi1 from the <italic>INO1</italic> promoter is coupled to the delivery of the gene to an environment near the nuclear membrane that is permissive for its activation.</p><p>The mechanistic role of Scs2 is currently not known. Its recently discovered function in promoting telomeric silencing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020342-Craven1">Craven and Petes 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020342-Cuperus1">Cuperus and Shore 2002</xref>) suggests that Scs2 may play a more global role in the regulation of transcription at the nuclear membrane. Scs2 contains a major sperm protein domain, named after a homologous protein in <named-content content-type="genus-species">Ascaris suum</named-content> sperm that forms a cytoskeletal structure and confers motility to sperm cells. It is thus tempting to speculate that Scs2 might similarly self-associate in the plane of the nuclear membrane, perhaps providing a two-dimensional matrix on which membrane-associated reactions could be organized. One suggestion from our data is that Scs2 may function as a local sink for Opi1. But it is also clear that other nuclear membrane components are likely to participate in the reaction. Opi1, for example, still localizes to nuclear membranes even in <italic>scs2</italic>&#x00394; cells, indicating that another, yet-unidentified Opi1 binding partner must exist (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020342-Loewen1">Loewen et al. 2003</xref>; unpublished data). Similarly, artificial <italic>INO1</italic> recruitment to the membrane via the FFAT motif suppresses the <italic>scs2</italic>&#x00394; phenotype (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020342-g006">Figure 6</xref>)&#x02014;i.e., it is sufficient to position <italic>INO1</italic> in an environment permissive for its induction&#x02014;yet the FFAT binding protein and the molecular nature of the permissive environment remain unknown.</p><p>Upon inducing the UPR, only 52&#x00025; of the cells scored <italic>INO1</italic> as membrane-associated (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020342-g005">Figure 5</xref>). Thus, under activating conditions, two types of cells are present in the population at any one time: those in which the <italic>INO1</italic> gene is recruited to the membrane, and those in which the <italic>INO1</italic> gene is dispersed throughout the nucleoplasm. This score correlated with the level of <italic>INO1</italic> transcription; <italic>INO1</italic> was membrane-associated in 68&#x00025; of the cells in the <italic>opi1</italic> mutant, which exhibits a correspondingly higher degree of activation than that observed in the wild-type strain. A quantitatively similar nuclear peripheral-nucleoplasmic distribution was observed upon activation of <italic>GAL</italic> genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020342-Casolari1">Casolari et al. 2004</xref>), suggesting that it may be a general feature of gene recruitment. There are at least two possible interpretations for the observed bimodal distributions. First, the distribution profiles might represent heterogeneity in the activation of <italic>INO1</italic> among cells. In this case, activation of <italic>INO1</italic> would be variable in individual cells exposed to identical conditions. Gene recruitment thus would stably trap <italic>INO1</italic> in a permissive environment for activation, and the localization of <italic>INO1</italic> would strictly correlate with its activation state. Alternatively, gene recruitment might alter the balance between two rapidly exchanging states; that is, stable membrane recruitment would not be required for activation. In this case, the observed distributions would represent snapshots of transient colocalization of <italic>INO1</italic> with the nuclear membrane within a population of cells that are uniformly activating transcription. Dynamic measurements of gene recruitment and single cell activity assays will need to be developed to distinguish between these possibilities. But no matter which of these possibilities proves to be correct, gene recruitment emerges as a new mechanism regulating eukaryotic gene expression and may be crucial to the regulation of many genes.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title/><sec id="s4a1"><title>Antibodies and reagents</title><p>Monoclonal anti- HA antibody HA11 was obtained from Babco (Berkeley, California, United States).

The <italic>OPI1-myc</italic> locus was then cloned into pRS315 as a HindIII-NotI fragment. Plasmid pASF144 expressing <italic>GFP-lacI</italic> has been described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020342-Straight1">Straight et al. 1996</xref>). Plasmid pGFP-FFAT-LacI was constructed by digesting pASF144 with EcoRI and ligating the fragment to the following hybridized oligonucleotides, encoding the FFAT motif from <italic>OPI1:</italic> LacI&#x0005f;FFAT1 (5&#x02032;-AATTGGACGATGAGGAGTTTTTTGATGCCTCAGAGG-3&#x02032;) and LacI&#x0005f;FFAT2 (5&#x02032;-AATTCCTCTGAGGCATCAAAAAACTCCTCATCGTCC-3&#x02032;). The orientation of the insert was confirmed by DNA sequencing. Both pAFS144 and pGFP-FFAT-LacI were digested with NheI, which cuts within the <italic>HIS3</italic> gene, and transformed into yeast.</p><p>Plasmid p6INO1LacO128 was constructed as follows. The <italic>INO1</italic> coding sequence, with 437 bp upstream and 758 bp downstream, was amplified from yeast genomic DNA using the following primers: INO1&#x0005f;promoter&#x0005f;Up (5&#x02032;-GATGAGGCCGGTGCC-3&#x02032;) and INO1&#x0005f;3&#x02032;down (5&#x02032;-AAGATTTCCTTCTTGGGCGC-3&#x02032;), and cloned into pCR2.1 using the Invitrogen TOPO TA cloning kit, to produce pCR2.1-INO1. <italic>INO1</italic> was moved from pCR2.1 into pRS306 as a KpnI fragment, to produce pRS306-INO1. The Lac operator array was then cloned from pAFS52 into pRS306-INO1 as a HindIII-XhoI fragment, to produce plasmid 10.2. Because the Lac operator fragment was smaller than had been reported (2.5 kb instead of 10 kb), presumably reflecting loss of Lac operator repeats by recombination, the Lac operator array was duplicated by digesting plasmid 10.2 with HindIII and SalI and introducing a second copy of the 2.5-kb HindIII-XhoI fragment, as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020342-Robinett1">Robinett et al. 1996</xref>). The resulting plasmid, p6INO1LacO128, has a 5-kb Lac operator array, corresponding to approximately 128 repeats of the <italic>lac</italic> operator. To integrate this plasmid at <italic>INO1,</italic> p6INO1LacO128 was digested with BglII, which cuts within the <italic>INO1</italic> gene, and transformed into yeast.</p><p>The <italic>INO1</italic> gene was removed from this plasmid to generate p6LacO128. This plasmid was used to integrate the Lac operator array at <italic>URA3</italic> by digestion with StuI and transformation into yeast.</p></sec><sec id="s4a3"><title>Immunoprecipitations</title><p>Cells were lysed using glass beads in IP buffer (50 mM Hepes-KOH pH 6.8, 150 mM potassium acetate, 2 mM magnesium acetate, and Complete Protease Inhibitors &#x0005b;Roche, Indianapolis, Indiana, United States&#x0005d;). The whole cell extract was used for coimmunoprecipitation of Ino2-<italic>myc</italic> and Ino4-HA. For immunoprecipitation of Opi1-<italic>myc</italic>, microsomes were pelleted by centrifugation for 10 min at 21,000 &#x000d7; <italic>g</italic> and resuspended in IP buffer. Triton X-100 was then added to either whole cell extract (Ino2-<italic>myc</italic>; final concentration of 1&#x00025;) or the microsomal fraction (Opi1-<italic>myc</italic>; final concentration of 3&#x00025;) and incubated for 30 min at 4 &#x000b0;C; detergent-insoluble material was then removed by centrifugation at 21,000 &#x000d7; <italic>g</italic>, 10 min.

Secondary antibodies were diluted 1:200. Vectashield mounting medium (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, California, United States) was applied to cells before sealing slides and visualizing using a Leica TCS NT confocal microscope (Leica, Wetzlar, Germany). For experiments localizing the GFP-Lac repressor, we first collected a single z slice through each cell that captured the brightest, most focused point of the GFP-visualized Lac operator array. This z slice was picked blind with respect to the nuclear membrane staining. Images in which this slice showed a clear nuclear membrane ring staining with a "hole" of nucleoplasm were then scored as follows: Cells in which the peak of the GFP-Lac repressor spot coincided with Sec63-<italic>myc</italic> nuclear membrane staining were scored as membrane-associated, and cells in which the peak of this spot was offset from nuclear membrane staining were scored as nucleoplasmic.</p></sec><sec id="s4a6"><title>Chromatin immunoprecipitation</title><p>Chromatin immunoprecipitation was carried out on strains expressing endogenous levels of tagged Ino2, Ino4, and Opi1 as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020342-Strahl-Bolsinger1">Strahl-Bolsinger et al. 1997</xref>), with the following modifications. The time of formaldehyde fixation was specific for each tagged protein. Strains expressing Ino2-HA were fixed for 15 min, strains expressing Ino4-HA were fixed for 60 min, and strains expressing Opi1-<italic>myc</italic> were fixed for 30 min. After lysis, cells were sonicated 15 times for 10 s at 30&#x00025; power using a microtip on a Vibracell VCX 600 Watt sonicator (Sonics and Materials, Newtown, Connecticut, United States). After sonication, lysates were centrifuged 10 min at 21,000 &#x000d7; <italic>g</italic> to remove insoluble material and incubated for 4 h with anti-HA agarose or anti-<italic>myc</italic> agarose.

Primers used were: INO1up3 5&#x02032;-ATTGCCTTTTTCTTCGTTCC-3&#x02032;), INO1down2 (5&#x02032;-CATTCAACACTTTCGATTCC-3&#x02032;), URAup2 (5&#x02032;-AGACGCATTGGGTCAAC-3&#x02032;), and URAdown2 (5&#x02032;-CTTCCCTTTGCAAATAGTCC-3&#x02032;). Dilution of the input fraction from 1:25 to 1:12,800 in fourfold steps demonstrated that reactions were within the linear range of template. This dilution series was used as a standard curve of C(T) values versus relative template concentration for both primer sets. The concentration of the <italic>INO1</italic> promoter and the <italic>URA3</italic> gene were calculated using this standard curve.

The site of integration of the Lac operator (Lac O), the version of the GFP-Lac repressor (GFP-Lac I; either wild-type or having the FFAT membrane-targeting signal) expressed, and the relevant genotype of each strain is indicated. The dashed line represents the mean membrane association of the <italic>URA3</italic> gene. The vertical arrow indicates the frequency of membrane association in the wild-type strain under activating conditions. Error bars represent the SEM between separate experiments. Each experiment scored at least 30 cells. The total number of cells (and experiments) scored for each column were: bar 1, 70 (2); bar 2, 66 (2); bar 3, 39 (1); bar 4, 71 (2); bar 5, 140 (4); bar 6, 88 (2); bar 7, 88 (2); bar 8, 92 (3); bar 9, 74 (2); and bar 10, 38 (1).</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="pbio.0020342.g005"/></fig><fig id="pbio-0020342-g006" position="float"><label>Figure 6</label><caption><title>Artificial Relocalization of <italic>INO1</italic> Bypasses the Requirement for Scs2</title><p>(A) Northern blot analysis of membrane-targeted <italic>INO1</italic>.
