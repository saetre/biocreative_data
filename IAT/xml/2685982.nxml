Its location in trypanosomes has been controversial. Here, using confocal microscopy and surface labelling techniques, we show that the GPI-PLC is located exclusively in a linear array on the outside of the flagellar membrane, close to the flagellar attachment zone, but does not co-localize with the flagellar attachment zone protein, FAZ1. Consequently, the GPI-PLC and the VSG occupy the same plasma membrane leaflet, which resolves the topological problem associated with the cleavage reaction if the VSG and the GPI-PLC were on opposite sides of the membrane. The exterior location requires the enzyme to be tightly regulated to prevent VSG release under basal conditions. During stimulated VSG release in intact cells, the GPI-PLC did not change location, suggesting that the release mechanism involves lateral diffusion of the VSG in the plane of the membrane to the fixed position of the GPI-PLC.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><p>African trypanosomes cause sleeping sickness, for which current therapy is inadequate. The parasite protects its surface from the host immune system by regularly switching its surface coat. The glycosylphosphatidylinositol-PLC only occurs in the bloodstream form, where it removes the surface coat after it enters the tsetse fly vector. Activation of the enzyme in the bloodstream would be fatal for the parasite and it is, therefore, a potential drug target. However, therapeutic strategies have been hampered by confusion over the location of the GPI-PLC despite great effort by many labs. We have used a wide variety of techniques, including one completely novel method, that exploits the dependence of detection for partially buried surface proteins on the temperature of fixation, to identify the location of the GPI-PLC in relation to other markers unequivocally. All approaches consistently show that the GPI-PLC is located exclusively in the outer leaflet of the plasma membrane covering the flagellum, where it is confined to a narrow linear array adjacent to the flagellar attachment zone. Our data have resolved the question of how enzyme and substrate meet and also suggest that chemotherapeutic agents would be able to target the GPI-PLC in its exterior location.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="16"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>The GPI-PLC is present in bloodstream forms of <italic>T. brucei</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000468-Bulow1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000468-Hereld1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000468-Fox1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref> and in many other eukaryotic cells.

This study does support the plasma membrane location reported originally by Turner <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000468-Turner2">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>. However, our evidence also demonstrates that the GPI-PLC is mainly restricted to a small sub-domain of the plasma membrane covering the flagellum in both long-slender and short stumpy forms. A small part of the GPI-PLC in some long slender forms but not in short stumpy forms, is also found in an endo-membrane-bound space within the cell body, anterior to the flagellar pocket and both adjacent and connected to the flagellar attachment zone. It is not present in the plasma membrane of either the flagellar pocket or the cell body. Instead, it is disposed in a patchy, linear array along the flagellar membrane adjacent to or within the flagellar attachment zone, depending upon how this zone is defined. Furthermore, both the dependence of the detection of the GPI-PLC on the temperature of fixation and its independence of the presence of detergent as well as the results from non-penetrating surface labeling demonstrate that the enzyme is located in the outer leaflet of the plasma membrane, consistent with the report by Gruszynski et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000468-Gruszynski1">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref>. Importantly, the GPI-PLC remains in the same location, both before and after activation.</p><p>We have estimated the minimum amount of GPI-PLC that could be detected if present elsewhere in the cell. Clearly, detection depends upon the amount of material present and the surface area over which it is distributed. The relevant area is the projected area of the 3-dimensional site being considered, which is less than its true area because in the projected image, the top surface area is superimposed upon the lower surface area and the surface area of the sides are stacked edge-on. Consequently, the projected surface area is likely to be close to a quarter of the true surface area. However, the integrated pixel densities in the sum of a series of confocal slices are also coincident in the projected image. Therefore, the ratio of integrated pixel density to projected area is the relevant parameter for confocal microscopy. The area of the projected image of the GPI-PLC has been found to be 9.84&#x000b1;1.54 &#x000b5;m<sup>2</sup> (n&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;100) in re-assembled confocal images, while the area of the projected image of the plasma membrane has been found to be 37.2&#x000b1;4.7 &#x000b5;m<sup>2</sup> (n&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;100). The integrated pixel intensity of the GPI-PLC in the projected image under ideal conditions was 7,226,942.&#x000b1;189. This value dropped to 427,312.&#x000b1;22. in the image that was just visible when the gain was reduced from 640 v to 580 v in the final stage of the amplifier circuit. Consequently, if the GPI-PLC were spread over the entire plasma membrane, the minimum level of detection would be 22.4&#x00025; of the amount of GPI-PLC actually detected. In contrast to this calculation, if the GPI-PLC were spread over the projected area of a different site, then the minimum level of detection would be a smaller &#x00025; of that actually observed by a factor of<disp-formula><graphic xlink:href="ppat.1000468.e001"/></disp-formula>where <italic>A<sub>po</sub></italic> is the projected area of the site containing the GPI-PLC and <italic>A<sub>pla</sub></italic> is the projected area of the GPI-PLC itself. Therefore, if the GPI-PLC were truly in the glycosomes or in the flagellar pocket, our minimum level of detection would be 2.4&#x00025; and 3.2&#x00025; respectively of the GPI-PLC actually detected, where the projected area of all glycosomes in the cell was calculated to be 15.8 &#x000b5;m<sup>2</sup> from the total glycosome area per unit cell volume <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000468-Opperdoes1">&#x0005b;38&#x0005d;</xref> and the volume of a cell determined experimentally from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000468-Jackson3">&#x0005b;39&#x0005d;</xref>, converted to projected total glycosome area by dividing by 4, which arises from the ratio of the area of a circle (&#x003c0;r<sup>2</sup>) divided by the area of a sphere (4&#x003c0;r<sup>2</sup>) when both have the same radius. The projected area of the flagellar pocket was calculated to be 1.67&#x000b1;0.508 &#x000b5;m<sup>2</sup> (n&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;100) from our own unpublished data. The way in which all of the preceeding calculations were performed is documented in the supplementary material (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1000468.s003">Text S1</xref>).</p><p>We have discovered that the temperature of fixation affects the detection of external, partially buried proteins. This observation has been used as a novel method to identify such proteins. Analysis of these temperature and detergent effects provided important evidence for the location of the GPI-PLC. For example, tubulin is located exclusively behind the permeability barrier of the plasma membrane, while the VSG is located on the exterior surface of the cell and the ISG-70 is located on the exterior surface but shielded by the VSG. Consequently, tubulin could be detected by immunofluoresence only when triton was present, while the VSG and ISG-70 were equally well detected in both the presence and absence of triton. The GPI-PLC was also detected equally well in both the presence and absence of triton, strongly suggesting that it, like the VSG and ISG-70, was located outside the cell.</p><p>In contrast to the differential effects of detergent, both tubulin and the VSG could be seen equally well when fixed at either 0&#x000b0;C or 37&#x000b0;C. However, detection of both ISG-70 and the GPI-PLC was strongly affected by the temperature during fixation. Both proteins were only detected well when cells were fixed at 0&#x000b0;C. Our interpretation of this finding depended upon the fact that the VSG partially masks access to underlying proteins on the cell exterior, which is a major function of the VSG. We reasoned that the VSG only blocked access of antibodies if it projected beyond underlying proteins and both diffused rapidly in the plane of the membrane and bent across shielded proteins at rates similar to those predicted for inter-bond flexing within proteins, which occur on an infra-red scale.</p><p>Composite results taken from structural studies of both the large N-terminal folding domain of MITat 1.2 VSG by x-ray crystallography <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000468-Freymann1">&#x0005b;40&#x0005d;</xref> and its small C-terminal folding domain by NMR <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000468-Chattopadhyay1">&#x0005b;41&#x0005d;</xref> have identified two unstructured, flexible regions within the peptide chain of the VSG, which may allow bending of the VSG on the cell surface. These regions comprise the hinge region (dodecapeptide: QKHKPAESQQQA) between the N- and C-terminal folding domains and the region at the extreme C-terminus of the small folding domain (hepadecapeptide: ETAKDGKTGNTNTTGSS) that links the VSG to its GPI-anchor. The peptide backbone of these flexible regions are shown as single lines within the space-filling cartoon of the VSG in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000468-g001">Figure 1</xref> - Scheme 1 panel A, illustrating the orientations that the VSG folding domains may adopt at 37&#x000b0;C, relative to each other and to the plane of the membrane, to block access of anti-GPI-PLC antibodies to the GPI-PLC.</p><p>Lowering the temperature from 37&#x000b0;C to 0&#x000b0;C slows the rates of both bond flexing and VSG diffusion. Consequently, the VSG spends short periods as partially coalesced aggregates within the plane of the membrane and access channels between the VSG condensates are transiently opened. Covalent fixation of cells at this lower temperature maintains the VSG in the partially aggregated condition and the channels of access permanently open, even if the temperature is subsequently raised, which allows the anti-GPI-PLC antibodies to reach their target (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000468-g008">Figure 8</xref> - Scheme 1 panel A). On the other hand, fixation of cells at 37&#x000b0;C allows adjacent molecules of VSG to be covalently linked across the upper surface of underlying proteins, creating an external lattice of cross-linked VSG dimers that serves as a permanent barrier against antibody access to underlying proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000468-g008">Figure 8</xref> - Scheme 1 panel A). In some early experiments we explored the effect of other, intermediate temperatures of fixation between 0&#x000b0;C and 37&#x000b0;C on the ability to detect the GPI-PLC and found that it was a graded effect. Intermediate fixation temperatures gave image intensities that were detectable but less than that observed when fixed at 0&#x000b0;C, which would be expected for an effect that depended on VSG mobility. Further support for the idea that the temperature dependence of detection of the GPI-PLC is antibody access dependent comes from the observation that detection of the innate fluorescence of YFP-tagged GPI-PLC is not temperature dependent in this manner (data not shown).</p><fig id="ppat-1000468-g008" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.ppat.1000468.g008</object-id><label>Figure 8</label><caption><title>Scheme 1.

In the absence of fixative, the VSG on the surface of the cell, even at 0&#x000b0;C, is still in relatively rapid flux between the partially aggregated state and the dispersed state and can still bend across proteins underlying the VSG, preventing antibody binding.</p><p>The prediction from immunofluorescence observations that the GPI-PLC is exposed at the outer surface of the cell was confirmed by non-penetrating surface labeling with <sup>125</sup>I, using the glucose oxidase/lactoperoxidase method.

Consequently, the mechanism preventing anti-GPI-PLC, glucose oxidase and lactoperoxidase from accessing the GPI-PLC, cannot prevent access of either the iodide anion and H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> or the iodine free radical, which reacts with tyrosines at the GPI-PLC surface <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000468-Phillips1">&#x0005b;42&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000468-Hubbard1">&#x0005b;43&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>In cells where the flagellum has detached from the cell body, the GPI-PLC remains entirely with the flagellum. When this observation is combined with the information from co-localization and surface-labelling experiments, it can be safely concluded that the GPI-PLC is located in the outer leaflet of the flagellar plasma membrane, disposed in a patchy, linear array along the length of the flagellar attachment zone and extending into the free flagellum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000468-g008">Figure 8</xref> - Scheme 1, panel B).</p><p>The present study resolves the topological issue that arose when the enzyme and its substrate were thought to be in separate compartments. Furthermore, placing the GPI-PLC on the outer leaflet of the plasma membrane makes the study of the regulation of the enzyme <italic>in situ</italic> of current interest. Consequently, the problem is not, &#x0201c;How does the GPI-PLC gain access to the VSG?&#x0201d; Rather, the question is, &#x0201c;What prevents the GPI-PLC from continuously releasing the VSG under basal conditions?&#x0201d; Clearly, the GPI-PLC must be tightly regulated and its restricted position suggests one possible mechanism. The GPI-PLC may have its active VSG binding site occluded by a partner protein under basal conditions but not under activated conditions. Certainly, the GPI-PLC must have at least one partner protein linked to the cytoskeleton, in order for it to be so strictly localized. Furthermore, activation of VSG release <italic>via</italic> the GPI-PLC in intact cells requires the presence of Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000468-Bowles1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000468-Voorheis1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>, while the catalytic activity of the isolated enzyme itself is independent of Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000468-Fox1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref> and does not possess a recognized Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>-binding motif. Consequently, either the partner protein or a separate regulatory protein may be a Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>-binding protein.</p><p>It is unlikely that the GPI-PLC is restricted in position and regulated by a caging mechanism without binding to a partner protein. Such a mechanism would require sufficient uncaging during activation of VSG release for the VSG to diffuse into the position of the GPI-PLC. Since the GPI-PLC is only 1/3 the size of a VSG dimer, activation of VSG release by uncaging would also allow diffusion of the GPI-PLC out of its restricted locale, which has not been observed. Consequently, it is difficult to reconcile the restricted location of the GPI-PLC without a direct attachment to some protein partner that interacts with the cytoskeleton.</p><p>The physiological role of the GPI-PLC in all cells is unclear.

However, there was a clear infection phenotype that was reversible by returning the gene. Recently this observation was extended by observing that the double knock-out of the genes encoding the GPI-PLC and a Zn<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>-metalloprotease prevented differentiation from bloodstream forms into procyclic forms and also prevented cell proliferation, while deletion of either one of these two genes singly was without such an effect <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000468-Grandgenett1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>.
