The N-terminal 651&#x02013;amino acid domain of phyB (N651), which binds an open tetrapyrrole chromophore, acts to perceive and transduce regulatory light signals in the cell nucleus. The N651 domain comprises several subdomains: the N-terminal extension, the Per/Arnt/Sim (PAS)-like subdomain (PLD), the cGMP phosphodiesterase/adenyl cyclase/FhlA (GAF) subdomain, and the phytochrome (PHY) subdomain. To define functional roles for these subdomains, we mutagenized an <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> line expressing N651 fused in tandem to green fluorescent protein, &#x003b2;-glucuronidase, and a nuclear localization signal. A large-scale screen for long hypocotyl mutants identified 14 novel intragenic missense mutations in the N651 moiety. These new mutations, along with eight previously identified mutations, were distributed throughout N651, indicating that each subdomain has an important function. <italic>In vitro</italic> analysis of the spectral properties of these mutants enabled them to be classified into two principal classes: light-signal perception mutants (those with defective spectral activity), and signaling mutants (those normal in light perception but defective in intracellular signal transfer). Most spectral mutants were found in the GAF and PHY subdomains. On the other hand, the signaling mutants tend to be located in the N-terminal extension and PLD. These observations indicate that the N-terminal extension and PLD are mainly involved in signal transfer, but that the C-terminal GAF and PHY subdomains are responsible for light perception. Among the signaling mutants, R110Q, G111D, G112D, and R325K were particularly interesting. Alignment with the recently described three-dimensional structure of the PAS-GAF domain of a bacterial phytochrome suggests that these four mutations reside in the vicinity of the phytochrome light-sensing knot.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><p>Adapting to the light environment, plants have evolved several photoreceptors, of which the phytochromes are specialized in perceiving the red and far-red light region of the spectrum. Although phytochrome was first discovered in plants, the phytochrome species are present in several organisms, including bacteria. The mechanisms by which phytochromes transduce light signals to downstream components are most well studied in plants. Upon light activation, phytochromes translocate from the cytoplasm into nucleus and regulate the gene expression network through interaction with nuclear transcription factors. The phytochrome molecule can be divided into two major domains: the N-terminal moiety, which is responsible for the light perception, and the C-terminal moiety. Although the C-terminal moiety was though to be involved in signal transduction, it has recently been shown that the N-terminal moiety has a role not only in the light perception, but also in light signal transfer to the downstream network. However, no signaling motifs have been found in the N-terminal moiety. In this study, we analyzed intragenic mutations derived from a genetic screen and found a cluster of residues necessary for signal transduction in a small region neighboring the light-sensing chromophore moiety on the three-dimensional structure. This is an important step towards understanding how a major plant photoreceptor, phytochrome, intramolecularly processes the light signal to trigger diverse physiological responses.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="13"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>To adapt to fluctuating environmental conditions, plants obtain and interpret information from light.

Phytochromes are unique pigments whose function is mediated through photoreversible conformational changes between two spectrally distinct forms: an inactive red-light (R)-absorbing form (Pr) and an active far-red-light (FR)-absorbing form (Pfr). R converts Pr to Pfr, and FR converts Pfr back to Pr. In addition, Pfr is gradually converted back to Pr in darkness by a thermally driven process called &#x0201c;dark reversion&#x0201d;. In <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> the phytochrome family consists of five members <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000158-Mathews1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>. Two members of the family, phytochrome A (phyA) and B (phyB) are the most important in seedling development. PhyA and phyB have different photosensory specificities.

Each phytochrome monomer consists of a chromophore-bearing N-terminal moiety of about 70 kD and a C-terminal moiety of about 55 kD. The N-terminal moiety is highly conserved among members of the phytochrome family. The N-terminal moiety alone can bind the chromophore and show photoreversible conformational changes. On the other hand, the C-terminal moiety is required for dimerization <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000158-Quail2">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref> and nuclear localization <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000158-Sakamoto1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>. Although the C-terminal moiety had long been presumed to transduce the signal to downstream components, we have shown that the N-terminal moiety of phyB alone can transduce the signal in the nucleus in response to light stimuli <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000158-Matsushita1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>. The data indicate therefore, that the N-terminal moiety has not only a light perception function but also a signal transferring function.</p><p>Although phytochromes were originally discovered in plants, recent analyses have demonstrated that phytochrome-related molecules are found in various bacteria <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000158-Montgomery1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>. Based on sequence analysis, four domains are recognized in the N-terminal moiety of phytochromes: the N-terminal extension, the N-terminal Per/Arnt/Sim (PAS)-like domain (PLD), the cGMP phosphodiesterase/adenyl cyclase/FhlA domain (GAF), and the phytochrome domain (PHY) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000158-Montgomery1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>. The N-terminal extension is found in higher plant phytochromes but not in bacteriophytochromes. GAF has bilin lyase activity and covalently binds the chromophore <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000158-Wu1">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref>. PHY stabilizes Pfr <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000158-Oka1">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref>. Although the crystal structure of plant phytochromes has not been determined yet, that of the PAS-GAF domain of <italic>Deinococcus radiodurans</italic> bacteriophytochome (<italic>Dr</italic>CBD) has been determined <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000158-Wagner1">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref>. Interestingly, an unusual three dimensional structure, designated the light sensing knot <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000158-Wagner1">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref>, is found between the PAS and GAF domains in <italic>Dr</italic>CBD.</p><p>To identify regions of the protein important for signal transduction by phytochromes, several deletion derivatives have been examined for their biological activities <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000158-Oka1">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000158-Boylan1">&#x0005b;25&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000158-Wagner2">&#x0005b;29&#x0005d;</xref>. According to those studies, a phyB derivative that lacks the N-terminal 103 amino acid extension exhibits reduced but significant biological activity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000158-Wagner2">&#x0005b;29&#x0005d;</xref>. Similarly, the PHY subdomain is dispensable for the signaling activity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000158-Oka1">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref>. Hence, the core region of phyB responsible for signal transduction activity can be narrowed down to the region composed of PLD and GAF. However, critical amino acid residues necessary for signaling have not been identified.</p><p>Mutational analyses have been adopted for the study of the phytochrome signal transduction mechanism. Several amino acid substitutions within phytochrome molecules have been identified that reduce the biological activity of the molecule without affecting either the amount of protein accumulation or the photochemical properties of the protein. Although this kind of mutational analysis led to identification of the Quail-box, which resides in the C-terminal moiety <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000158-Wagner3">&#x0005b;30&#x0005d;</xref>, it has been later shown that some of the mutations in this region impair the subcellular dynamics of phytochromes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000158-Kircher2">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000158-Matsushita1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>. On the other hand, as the N-terminal moiety retains dual functions (a light perception and a signal transferring function) the amino acid substitutions, which reduce the biological activity, within the N-terminal moiety may be expected to fall into two classes: (1) one consisting of those that are defective in photoperception and/or the maintenance of the active Pfr form, and (2) the other containing those that are normal in photoperception and the maintenance of active Pfr form, but defective in regulatory activity.</p><p>Of the above two classes, the latter class of mutations is thought to directly disrupt the signal transfer to components downstream of phyB. Although altogether 8 mutations have been reported within the N-terminal moiety of phyB <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000158-Oka1">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000158-Chen1">&#x0005b;31&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000158-Reed1">&#x0005b;34&#x0005d;</xref>, none have been fully investigated. This may be because the signal transferring function of N-terminal moiety had not been established until the recent evidence that our engineered N-terminal moiety of phyB can complement the <italic>phyB</italic> mutation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000158-Matsushita1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>. In addition, the number of mutations reported within the N-terminal moiety is too few and the distribution throughout the N-terminal moiety is too disperse to indicate regions important for signal transduction of phyB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000158-g001">Figure 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen-1000158-t001">Table 1</xref>).</p><fig id="pgen-1000158-g001" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pgen.1000158.g001</object-id><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>Hypocotyl Phenotypes of N651-GUS-NLS Mutants Carrying Missense Mutations.</title><p>(A) Locations of missense mutations found in the present (plain) and previous (italic) studies.

Each of the mutant lines, on the other hand, exhibited a long hypocotyl phenotype, to varying degrees compared to the N651G-GUS-NLS lines, with some displaying cR-intensity responsiveness, and others not. The hypocotyls of D64N, R110Q, G111D, P309L, and S370F lines were almost as long as those of the <italic>phyB</italic> mutant under both intensities, indicating severe or complete loss of phyB activity.

Of these, six (G248E, P304L, R313K, R322Q, V401L and S584F) showed a greater or lesser degree of reduced responsiveness to the lower compared to the higher cR intensity, whereas the remaining three (G112D, P149L and R352K) did not show such a difference in hypocotyl responsiveness to the cR intensity.

Those results prompted us to elucidate the structural basis of this observation. Hence, we screened for long hypocotyl mutants to identify missense mutations that reduced the biological activity of phyB within the N-terminal domain of phyB.

In the present study we identified 14 additional missense mutations and examined them in detail for functional relevance.</p><p>To identify as many novel mutations as possible, we modified the screening procedure, compared to previous studies. First, to focus on the N-terminal moiety of phyB, we used the N651G-GUS-NLS line as a parental line for mutagenesis. Second, the seedlings were grown under dim cR, which allowed us to detect smaller reductions in activity. Combined with a large scale screening of at least 1,000,000 M2 seedlings derived from 200,000 M1 plants, we successfully identified 14 novel missense mutations within the N-terminal moiety of phyB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000158-g001">Figure 1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen-1000158-t001">Table 1</xref>). It remains unclear why the present set of mutants did not overlap with the known ones. This might be because the N651G-GUS-NLS line rather than the full-length phyB line was used in the present study.</p><p>The 14 mutations found in the present study, together with the 8 previously described mutations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000158-Oka1">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000158-Chen1">&#x0005b;31&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000158-Reed1">&#x0005b;34&#x0005d;</xref> were characterized with respect to their spectral properties <italic>in vitro</italic>, resulting in the identification of two principal classes of defects. One consists of the spectral mutants, which are defective in chromophore incorporation, photoconversion and/or stability of Pfr. The other comprises signaling mutants, which are normal in spectral properties but defective in biological activity. 14 mutations out of the total of 22 were classified as spectral mutants and the remaining 8 as signaling mutants.</p><p>As the loss of spectral integrity directly affects the amount or overall structure of the active Pfr form of the photoreceptor, the reduced biological activity of the spectral mutants is simply explained by the low amount of or aberrant Pfr form. These mutants are, therefore, defective in normal light signal perception. It is well established that mutation at the chromophore attachment site (C357S of phyB), preventing chromophore ligation, shows loss of biological activity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000158-Wagner2">&#x0005b;29&#x0005d;</xref>, and the N-terminal 450 amino acid-fragment of phyB which exhibits an aberrant Pfr form and fast dark reversion has reduced biological activity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000158-Oka1">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref>. Of the fourteen mutants newly studied here, seven (G284E, P309L, R313K, R322Q, S370F, V401L and S584F) are photoperception mutants. Of these, two (P309L and S370F) display essentially complete loss of photosensory activity in vivo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000158-g001">Figure 1B</xref>), consistent with the absence or severe loss of chromophore ligation capacity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000158-g002">Figure 2</xref>), whereas the remainder display reduced photosensory activity, consistent with varying degrees of spectral aberration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000158-g003">Figures 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000158-g004">4</xref>).</p><p>By contrast, the remaining seven of the fourteen mutants studied here (D64N, R110Q, G111D, G112D, P149L, P304L and R352K) retain spectral integrity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000158-g002">Figures 2</xref>,<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000158-g003">3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000158-g004">4</xref>), indicating that they are normal in light signal perception, but defective in signal transfer to downstream components of the phyB transduction chain. The retention of normal spectral properties by these mutant molecules is a strong indication that they retain the broad structural integrity of the N-terminal moiety, because of the well-established evidence that deletion of any of the major subdomains causes aberrant spectral properties and altered biological activity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000158-Rockwell1">&#x0005b;44&#x0005d;</xref>. In addition, of the four signaling mutants examined here in the context of the full-length phyB protein, all showed nuclear localization and normal intranuclear dynamics upon light activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000158-g007">Figure 7</xref>). This result strongly indicates that these mutations specifically disturb the signal transferring function without reducing other functions of phyB.</p><p>It is notable that of the nine phyB-variant lines showing an intermediate phenotype (intermediate hypocotyl length between the <italic>phyB</italic> and the N651G-GUS-NLS transgenic rescue lines), six (G248E, P304L, R313K, R322Q, V401L and S584F) show some degree of reduced responsiveness to the lower compared to the higher intensity. With the exception of P304L, these are all photoperception mutants, compromised in their spectral activity, consistent with the prediction that they will have reduced photosensory sensitivity. The remaining three (G112D, P149L and R352K) do not show such a difference in hypocotyl responsiveness to the cR intensity. This is also not unexpected, because these are signal-transfer mutants. These exhibit normal photoperception, but reduced regulatory activity in inhibiting hypocotyl elongation. This behavior is consistent with the prediction that these mutants will retain the same equal sensitivity as the parent N651G-GUS-NLS molecule to the two cR intensities, but have reduced capacity to transduce the perceived light signal (this second step being independent of the intensity of the signal at saturation).</p></sec><sec id="s3b"><title>Overall Distribution Pattern of the Mutations in the N-terminal Moiety</title><p>All 22 mutations were mapped within the phyB amino acid sequence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000158-g001">Figure 1A</xref>). These mutations were more or less evenly distributed throughout the N651 moiety, suggesting that all subdomains are important for the normal function of N651. However, the different types of mutations distributed differently. The spectral mutations are distributed mainly in the GAF and PHY subdomains (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen-1000158-t001">Table 1</xref>). By contrast, the signaling mutations tend to cluster in both the N-terminal extension and PLD. This observation thus defines the roles of the subdomains in the N-terminal moiety: GAF and PHY are apparently responsible for light-signal input (photoperception and/or maintenance of the Pfr form), whereas the N-terminal extension and PLD are mainly involved in signal transduction by phyB. This conclusion is consistent with the fact that GAF forms the chromophore pocket <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000158-Wagner1">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref> and PHY stabilizes phyB in the Pfr form <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000158-Oka1">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref>.

Interestingly, R110(I31), G111(P32) and G112(G33) partly overlap with the &#x003b2;1&#x02032; strand which, together with the &#x003b2;2&#x02032; and &#x003b2;3&#x02032; strands in <italic>Dr</italic>CBD, participates in the formation of the light sensing knot <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000158-Wagner1">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000158-g005">Figure 5</xref>). Hence, the present data are consistent with the idea that the light sensing knot plays a critical role in phytochrome signal transduction. Two additional mutants, P149L and I208T, were found in PLD. The I208(V118) residue is at the end of the &#x003b2;4 strands and faces the knot in the <italic>Dr</italic>CBD structure <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000158-Wagner1">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref>. The P149(R70) reside is in the loop connecting the &#x003b1;1 and &#x003b1;2 helices and faces the knot as well.</p><p>The R352(R254) residue forms salt bridges through its two amines with the carbonyl oxygen of the ring B propionate of the chromophore in <italic>Dr</italic>CBD <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000158-Wagner1">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref>. Since one of these amines is missing in the R352K mutant, the mutation would be expected to weaken the interaction between ring B and the polypeptide moiety. Because of the tight connection with the chromophore, the R352K mutant might be expected to have negatively affected photochemical properties. Indeed, the substitution to E of R318 in pea phyA, and that to K of R254 in cph1, which correspond to R352 of <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> phyB, altered their photochemical property <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000158-Deforce2">&#x0005b;49&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000158-Hahn1">&#x0005b;50&#x0005d;</xref>. Nevertheless, abnormal spectral properties of R352K were less clear in the N-terminal moiety of phyB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000158-g002">Figures 2</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000158-g003"/><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000158-g004">4</xref>). This may be because of the different phytochrome species involved. Furthermore, PBG(R352K) accumulated in the nucleus and formed speckles in a light-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000158-g007">Figure 7</xref>), which strongly indicates that PBG(R352K) was spectrally active <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p><p>One surprising feature of R352(R254) is its proximity to the light sensing knot. In the <italic>D</italic>rCBD structure, R352(R254) is on the &#x003b2;3&#x02032; strand, which is a component of the knot (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000158-g005">Figure 5</xref>). The three successive R110(I31), G111(P32) and G112(G33) residues are partly included in &#x003b2;1&#x02032;, which is one of the partners for &#x003b2;3&#x02032; in formation of the knot <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000158-Wagner1">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref>. Considering the possible tight connection of R352(R254) with the chromophore, these four amino acid residues may constitute a route to relay the conformational changes in the chromophore to the surface of the molecule. It should be noted here that the model presented here is based on the <italic>D</italic>rCBD structure. Unfortunately, the homology is not particularly high between higher plant phyB and <italic>Dr</italic>CBD within PLD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000158-g005">Figure 5</xref>). Consequently, the three dimensional structure of phyB may be different from that of <italic>Dr</italic>CBD. To answer the question definitively, the three dimensional structure of phyB needs to be determined.</p><p>It is notable, that the disruption of the signal transfer capacity of the phyB molecule by mutations in the light-sensing knot region have parallel deleterious effects on both early and late phases of seedling deetiolation regulated by phyB. This suggests that these amino acids have a central role in the primary signaling function of the photoreceptor molecule.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Plant Materials, Growth Conditions for Seedlings, and Growth Measurements</title><p>The <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> mutant, <italic>phyB-5</italic>, is a null allele on the Landsberg <italic>erecta</italic> background <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000158-Reed1">&#x0005b;34&#x0005d;</xref>.
