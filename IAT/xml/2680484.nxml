In <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> studies, we have shown that p43 increases mitochondrial transcription and mitochondrial biogenesis.

We report that p43 overexpression initially increased mitochondrial mass. However, after the early rise in mitochondrial DNA occurring at 2 months of age in transgenic mice, we observed a progressive decrease of mitochondrial DNA content which became 2-fold lower at 23 months of age relatively to control animals. Moreover, p43 overexpression induced an oxidative stress characterized by a strong increase of lipid peroxidation and protein oxidation in quadriceps muscle, although antioxidant enzyme activities (catalase and superoxide dismutase) were stimulated. In addition, muscle atrophy became detectable at 6 months of age, probably through a stimulation of the ubiquitin proteasome pathway via two muscle-specific ubiquitin ligases E3, Atrogin-1/MAFbx and MuRF1.</p><p>Taken together, these results demonstrate that a prolonged stimulation of mitochondrial activity induces muscle atrophy. In addition, these data underline the importance of a tight control of p43 expression and suggest that a deregulation of the direct T3 mitochondrial pathway could be one of the parameters involved in the occurrence of sarcopenia.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="14"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Triiodothyronine (T3) exerts a pleiotropic influence on development and homeostasis of the adult.

To study the influence of this overexpression during aging, we have analyzed changes in mitochondrial activity and biogenesis in skeletal muscle at different ages: 2, 6, 11 and 23 months. We recorded a biphasic response of mitochondrial activity to p43 overexpression. First, mitochondrial biogenesis seems to be initially stimulated, as demonstrated by a rise in mitochondrial mass clearly apparent in histological studies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005631-g002">Fig. 2</xref>), in association with a transient increase in mtDNA levels. The initial increase in COX and CS activities clearly argues also in favour of a general stimulation of mitochondrial activity, also in agreement with the rise in mitochondrial respiration observed in the presence of succinate and rotenone. However, this transient stimulation is followed by an actual impairment of the organelle activity reflected by a decline in COX and CS activities, associated to a decrease in mitochondrial respiration under succinate rotenone and in mtDNA content observed from 2 or 6 months after birth.</p><p>Several other interesting features also appears in this study. Among them, we have shown <italic>in vivo</italic> that the maximal activity of complex II is poorly affected by p43 overexpression. In addition, we report here a selective increase in mitochondrial respiration measured in the presence of complex II substrates, occurring only in 2 months old transgenic mice. As Complex II maximal activity was not affected in these animals, such a result suggests that p43 improves the efficiency of this complex, considered as the second entry of the respiratory chain. One possible explanation could be that, despite the general increase in mitochondrial activity occurring in these younger animals, complex I activity remains unchanged, thus favouring the second entry of the respiratory chain. This possibility also well agrees with the observation that the rise in complex II-dependent respiration disappears in 6 months old animals, when maximal complex I activity is stimulated. In this hypothesis, this could reflect an adaptative change in response to the stimulation of the organelle activity. Other adaptative changes are also apparent with the observation that maximal activity of complex I displays opposite age-related changes to that recorded for COX or CS maximal activity.</p></sec><sec id="s3b"><title>Influence of p43 overexpression on muscle oxidative stress</title><p>In order to understand the age-related decrease in mt-DNA content and several parameters of mitochondrial activity recorded in transgenic mice, we tested the possibility that this event could result from the occurrence of an oxidative stress, for the following reasons: i) mitochondria are the major intracellular source of Reactive oxygen species (ROS) production ; ii) <italic>in vitr</italic>o, p43 overexpression stimulates mitochondrial ROS production <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005631-Grandemange1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>; iii) mtDNA is a major target of ROS <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005631-Fleming1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>. We found a significant rise in TBARS levels reflecting a higher rate of lipid peroxidation in 2 to 11 month old transgenic mice compared to wild types. In addition, we also observed a delayed decrease in protein thiols (SH groups) levels when compared to that recorded in control animals detected in 6 months old and older mice. This observation clearly reflected a stronger protein oxidation rate in muscle of p43 overexpressing mice. Interestingly, this oxidative stress takes place in spite of the induction of antioxidant defense systems. Antioxidant enzyme activity such as catalase and superoxide dismutase (SOD) which are up regulated against free radical damage, were transiently (SOD in 2 month old animals) or permanently (catalase) increased in quadriceps muscle. These results agree well with the study of UCP expression. One of the main adaptations of mitochondria to oxidative stress is a mild uncoupling of oxidative phosphorylation that reduces ROS mitochondrial production by lowering mitochondrial membrane potential <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005631-Papa1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005631-Halliwell1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>.

Here we found that UCP2 and UCP3 mRNAs and proteins were strongly increased in quadriceps muscle of 2-month old transgenic mice relatively to control ones. These results were in line with a previous study showing that overexpression of p43 in human dermal fibroblasts stimulates ROS production and induced a strong decrease of mitochondrial membrane potential <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005631-Grandemange1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>. An activation of UCP2 and UCP3 gene expression associated with an increase of catalase activity has previously been reported in atrophied gastrocnemius muscles of tumour-bearing rats <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005631-Sanchis1">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005631-Busquets1">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref>. However, this upregulation of UCPs expression was only recorded in 2 month old animals, suggesting that this protective mechanism is not permanently triggered during a long-term oxidative stress, a phenomenon partly explaining the progressive decline in mtDNA content occurring during aging of p43 overexpressing mice, despite the permanent upregulation of catalase activity.</p></sec><sec id="s3c"><title>Influence of p43 overexpression on muscle development</title><p>As previously shown <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005631-Casas2">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>, p43 overexpression increased the expression of MyHC-IIa and MyHC-IIx in two different oxido-glycolytic muscles in younger mice, but decreased MyHC-IIb expression, thus inducing a shift toward the acquisition of a slow-twitch muscle phenotype. Interestingly, alterations of mitochondrial activity occurring during aging were associated with an important reduction in MyHC-I, IIx and IIb expression. Although remaining higher than in control animals, MyHC-IIa expression was significantly lower in 6 month old compared to 2 month old trangenic mice. These results suggest that p43-induced mitochondrial alterations led to a general reduction in MyHC expression, particularly MyHC-IIx. As myosins have to be considered as quantitatively major proteins in skeletal muscle, they also suggest that protein synthesis is altered in p43 overexpressing mice.</p><p>In agreement with the fact that oxidative stress is known to induce muscle atrophy, p43 overexpression induces a skeletal muscle loss detected since 6 months of age. After the initial shift in contractile phenotype observed in younger animals, as previously discussed, p43 overexpression clearly decreased all MyHC expression, particularly MyHC-IIx. In addition, as type IIX and IIB are the predominant fibers in quadriceps muscles, our data suggest that the reduced muscle weight in transgenic mice during aging results for its most part from the selective atrophy of fast-glycolytic fibers.</p><p>Muscle proteolysis is known to be mediated by the ubiquitin proteasome pathway via two muscle-specific ubiquitin ligases E3: Atrogin-1/MAFbx and MuRF1. In particular, MuRF1 overexpression results in a disruption of contractile proteins by interacting with titin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005631-McElhinny1">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref>. Interestingly, the expression of these two critical regulators of muscle proteolysis was increased in quadriceps muscle of 2-months old transgenic mice compared to controls, at a time when muscle atrophy was not detected. However, muscles of 2 month old transgenic mice are richer in oxidative fibers known to be more resistant to atrophy <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005631-Sandri1">&#x0005b;25&#x0005d;</xref>. At 6 months of age, when muscle atrophy became evident, only MAFbx expression was increased in p43 overexpressing mice. Interestingly, age-related changes in MAFbx and MuRF1 expression in transgenic mice displayed important differences, with predominant MAFbx overexpression in 6 month old animals, and a specific upregulation of MuRF1 expression in older animals. These results suggest that MAFbx and MuRF1 mRNA expression under atrophic conditions are induced via distinct signalling pathways. Over all, this set of data indicates that p43 overexpression induces skeletal muscle atrophy probably by stimulating the ubiquitin proteasome pathway via two muscle-specific ubiquitin ligases E3: MAFbx and MuRF1. However, the observation that the more important muscle loss occurs in 23 months old transgenic animals, at a time where expression levels of these ubiquitin ligases are restored also suggest that muscle proteosynthesis is severely impaired.</p><p>Experiments concerning muscle functionality have provided surprising data. Miura and co-workers have previously shown that 2-months old mice overexpressing PGC-1&#x003b1; ran less than wild-type mice because these transgenic mice presented a mitochondrial uncoupling and a marked decrease in the ATP muscle content <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005631-Miura1">&#x0005b;26&#x0005d;</xref>. Interestingly, in the treadmill test, the running time and distance performed by the 2-month old p43 overexpressing mice were decreased compared to wild-type. In addition, we observed a mitochondrial uncoupling attested by the strong increase of UCP2 and UCP3 expression at 2 month of age. These data suggest that p43 overexpression in young animals by increasing uncoupled oxidative phosphorylation caused ATP deprivation, resulting in a reduction of exercise perfomance as described in PGC-1&#x003b1; transgenic mice at the same age <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005631-Miura1">&#x0005b;26&#x0005d;</xref>. More surprising is the observation that despite the fact that muscle growth is reduced in 6 months old transgenic animals relatively to that recorded in control mice, p43 overexpression seems to improve muscle fatigability and endurance at this stage. This point is currently under investigation in order to study the metabolic influence of p43 overexpression, as changes in fuel metabolism could greatly influence animal endurance.</p><p>In conclusion, we demonstrated that p43 overexpression transiently stimulated mitochondrial biogenesis and activity. In turn, this influence leads to the occurrence of an oxidative stress probably at the origin of muscle sarcopenia.
