In addition, we have determined the nucleotide sequences of the 5' flanking nuclease hypersensitive sites that we have previously shown are induced during the estrogen mediated activation of the VTG II gene in liver (1). One of these sites is found to be nearly identical to the enhancer core sequence of SV40. A computer assisted analysis of the DNA sequences upstream from the VTG II gene has revealed four short (7 to 9 base pair) sequence elements that are present in similar positions flanking the other major estrogen inducible gene for liver, very low density apolipoprotein II (apoVLDL II). For VTG II, these sequences are located between two of the induced nuclease hypersensitive sites that are liver specific. Sequences homologous to one element, located approximately 100 base pairs upstream from the mRNA cap sites of the VTG II and apoVLDL II genes, are also observed for three estrogen inducible genes that are expressed in the oviduct, although for each of these genes the sequence falls further upstream, between -220 and -200. We suggest that these conserved sequences may be important in mediating the tissue specific responses of these genes to estrogen.</p><sec><title>Images</title><fig id="F1"><graphic xlink:href="nar00320-0275-a" xlink:role="1123"/></fig><fig id="F2"><graphic xlink:href="nar00320-0280-a" xlink:role="1128"/></fig></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><supplementary-material content-type="scanned-pages"><graphic xlink:href="nar00320-0269.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1117"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00320-0270.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1118"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00320-0271.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1119"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00320-0272.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1120"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00320-0273.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1121"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00320-0274.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1122"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00320-0275.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1123"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00320-0276.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1124"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00320-0277.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1125"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00320-0278.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1126"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00320-0279.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1127"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00320-0280.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1128"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00320-0281.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1129"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00320-0282.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1130"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00320-0283.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1131"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00320-0284.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1132"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00320-0285.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1133"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00320-0286.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1134"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00320-0287.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1135"/></supplementary-material></body></article>
