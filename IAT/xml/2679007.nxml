Therefore locally produced cytokines or other molecules released by virally-infected airway epithelial cells are likely responsible for recruiting and activating neutrophils. Heat shock proteins (HSPs) are generally regarded as intracellular proteins acting as molecular chaperones; however, HSP72 can also be released from cells, and the implications of this release are not fully understood.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p>Human bronchial epithelial cells (16HBE14o-) were infected with RSV and Hsp72 levels were measured by Western blot and ELISA. Tracheal aspirates were obtained from critically ill children infected with RSV and analyzed for Hsp72 levels by ELISA. Primary human neutrophils and differentiated HL-60 cells were cultured with Hsp72 and supernatants analyzed for cytokine production. In some cases, cells were pretreated with polymyxin B prior to treatment with Hsp72. I&#x003ba;B&#x003b1; was assessed by Western blot and EMSA's were performed to determine NF-&#x003ba;B activation. HL-60 cells were pretreated with neutralizing antibody against TLR4 prior to Hsp72 treatment. Neutrophils were harvested from the bone marrow of wild type or TLR4-deficient mice prior to treatment with Hsp72.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Infection of 16HBE14o- with RSV showed an induction of intracellular Hsp72 levels as well as extracellular release of Hsp72. Primary human neutrophils from normal donors and differentiated HL-60 cells treated with increasing concentrations of Hsp72 resulted in increased cytokine (IL-8 and TNF&#x003b1;) production. This effect was independent of the low levels of endotoxin in the Hsp72 preparation. Hsp72 mediated cytokine production via activation of NF-&#x003ba;B translocation and DNA binding. Using bone marrow-derived neutrophils from wild type and TLR4-mutant mice, we showed that Hsp72 directly activates neutrophil-derived cytokine production via the activation of TLR4.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Collectively these data suggest that extracellular Hsp72 is released from virally infected airway epithelial cells resulting in the recruitment and activation of neutrophils.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Introduction</title><p>The heat shock response is an ancient, highly conserved, endogenous cellular defense mechanism characterized by the rapid upregulation of a specific group of proteins called heat shock proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. While the heat shock response was first described nearly 50 years ago, it has only been relatively recently that these proteins have been linked closely with the host innate immune response [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. For example, increased expression of the 72 kDa heat shock protein (Hsp72) appears to abrogate proinflammatory gene expression through inhibition of the transcription factor, NF-&#x003ba;B [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Heat shock proteins, such as Hsp72 and Hsp90 appear to be intimately involved in the recognition of so-called pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs), such as lipopolysaccharide (LPS). In this regard, Hsp72 and Hsp90 associate with Toll-like receptor (TLR)-4, CD14, and MD-2 within the lipid raft and appear to be crucial in the regulation of the assembly and subsequent function of the TLR-4 receptor complex [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. Finally, the release of Hsp72 into the extracellular environment may serve to signal an impending danger signal to neighboring cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. In this context, Hsp72 is now included in a growing list of so-called alarmins, a group of endogenous proteins that are released by necrotic cells or secreted via non-classical pathways in order to convey a danger signal to surrounding cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. Endogenous alarmins, such as Hsp72, and exogenous PAMPs, such as LPS, both convey a similar message of danger that results in a patterned response. Together, alarmins and PAMPs comprise the so-called danger-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>].</p><p>Collectively heat shock proteins are the most abundant intracellular proteins, representing up to 10% of the total protein content in the cell [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. Hsp72 in particular is markedly induced in response to a diverse range of cellular insults [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>], including increased temperature, oxidative stress, glucose deprivation, chemical exposure, ischemia-reperfusion injury, ultraviolet radiation, and infectious agents such as LPS. Therefore, Hsp72 or additional inducible stress proteins, by virtue of their relative abundance during times of stress are reliable markers of cell stress and plausible candidates for endogenous DAMPs.</p><p>We have recently shown that extracellular Hsp72 induces interleukin (IL)-8 expression in cultured human bronchial epithelial cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. IL-8 is the principal neutrophil chemotactic cytokine ("chemokine") in humans and plays an important role in the pathophysiology of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) lower respiratory tract infections (LRTI) in young children [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. RSV is the leading cause of LRTI in children less than 1 year of age. More than 20% of all children will have RSV-associated wheezing during their first year of life, and 2&#x02013;3% of these children will be hospitalized [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. Approximately 120,000 children, most of whom are younger than 6 months of age, are hospitalized with RSV LRTI in the U.S. each year &#x02013; close to 200 of these infants will die as a result of complications attributed to RSV [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. Neutrophils are the predominant airway leukocytes found in children with RSV LRTI, though it appears that RSV does not directly activate neutrophils. Rather, proinflammatory cytokines and other molecules, possibly danger signals such as Hsp72, released by RSV-infected airway epithelial cells recruit and activate neutrophils in the lower airways [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. Accordingly, we hypothesized that (i) RSV infection results in the release of extracellular Hsp72 from the airway epithelium and (ii) extracellular Hsp72 acts as a danger signal or alarmin, resulting in the subsequent recruitment and activation of neutrophils in the lung.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Cell culture</title><p>SV40-transformed human bronchial epithelial cells (16HBE14o-) were grown as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. HL-60 promyelocytic leukemia cells (ATCC, Manassas, VA) were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 50 mg/ml streptomycin, 2 U/mL penicillin, and 2 mM L-glutamine. For differentiation, HL-60 cells (1 &#x000d7; 10<sup>6</sup>/mL) were incubated in the presence of 1% DMSO for 3 days. 6 h prior to experimentation, cells were deprived of serum. In some cases, HL-60 cells were pretreated with polymyxin B (50 &#x003bc;g/ml for 1 h; Sigma, St. Louis, MO) or a TLR4 antibody (10 &#x003bc;g/ml for 1 h; eBiosciences, San Diego, CA) prior to treatment. Culture media from HL-60 cells treated with Hsp72 were analyzed for cytotoxicity using the Lactate Dehydrogenase (LDH) cytotoxicity BioAssay (US Biological) according to manufacturers' specifications.</p></sec><sec><title>Generation of low endotoxin, human recombinant Hsp72</title><p>Recombinant Hsp72 was generated in our laboratory as recently described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. The Hsp72 preparation was purified using an endotoxin binding column (Pierce, Rockford, IL). Endotoxin levels (110 EU/mg Hsp72 protein or 11 ng/mg Hsp72 protein) were independently measured at Charles River Laboratories (Wilmington, MA).</p></sec><sec><title>Preparation of RSV</title><p>HEp-2 cells were maintained in Eagle's minimal essential media (EMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mM L-glutamine, and 100 U/ml penicillin/streptomycin (10% EMEM). The A2 strain of RSV was plaque-purified three times under agarose. The third plaque was inoculated into a subconfluent HEp-2 cell monolayer. After adsorption for 1 h at room temperature, 10% EMEM was added and the infection was allowed to proceed for 3 d at 37&#x000b0;C until the entire monolayer showed cytopathic effects. The contents of the flask were resuspended and distributed in 1 ml aliquots, quick-frozen with alcohol/dry ice, and stored at -80&#x000b0;. Virus was derived from this master stock by infecting subconfluent HEp-2 monolayers at multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.1, and harvesting the monolayer when it appeared to be completely infected. The cells and media were sonicated (Ultrasonic homogenizer; Cole-Parmer Instrument Co., Chicago, IL) on ice with eight 1 s bursts using output of 50 and then the suspension was clarified by centrifugation at 1000 &#x000d7; <italic>g </italic>for 10 min. The supernatant was frozen and stored at -80&#x000b0;C and thawed rapidly at 37&#x000b0;C for use.

Tracheal aspirates were obtained as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. Briefly, tracheal aspirates were collected with routine suctioning by instilling a total of 3 mL of sterile 0.9% saline in 1 mL aliquots into the endotracheal tube. After installation, patients were hand-ventilated in order to disperse the saline, and the trachea was suctioned via a catheter placed slightly beyond the tip of the endotracheal tube. Multiple suction specimens were collected and pooled together and immediately refrigerated at 4&#x000b0;C. Samples were then centrifuged at 2000 rpm at 4&#x000b0;C for 5 minutes. The supernatant was collected and stored at -70&#x000b0;C until further analysis. Specimens were stored in aliquots in order to minimize the number of freeze-thaw cycles.</p></sec><sec><title>Isolation of primary human neutrophil isolation</title><p>Following approval by the IRB and with informed consent, blood was collected using sterile technique from healthy volunteers for isolation of polymorphonuclear (PMN) leukocytes.

In order to confirm these results in our model, we infected 16HBE14o- cells with RSV at an MOI of 1 to 10 for 6 h and measured intracellular expression via Western immunoblot. RSV infection resulted in a dose-dependent increase in intracellular Hsp72 expression (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>). These results confirm that RSV infection activates the stress response <italic>in vitro</italic>. Next, we measured extracellular Hsp72 levels following RSV infection (MOI of 1 &#x02013; 10). Again, RSV infection resulted in a dose-dependent release of extracellular Hsp72 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>). We found that the preparation of RSV does in fact contain a negligible amount of Hsp72 (0.32 ng/&#x003bc;l). To confirm that RSV was indeed regulating intracellular Hsp72 synthesis, we performed quantitative real time PCR on 16HBE14o- cells infected with RSV at an MOI of 5 and 10. As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C</xref>, infection with RSV increased mRNA levels for Hsp72, confirming that RSV infection is regulating endogenous Hsp72 production in human bronchial epithelial cells. Consistent with our previous data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>], neither monensin nor brefeldin A, both inhibitors of classic protein secretory pathways, had any appreciable inhibitory effect on extracellular Hsp72 release (<italic>data not shown</italic>). Together these data show that RSV infection increases both intracellular levels of Hsp72 and extracellular release of Hsp72. Furthermore, release of Hsp72 does not appear to be dependent on the classic protein secretory pathway in this model.</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>RSV infection activates the stress response in human bronchial epithelial cells</bold>. <bold>A</bold>. 16HBE14o- cells were infected with RSV at 1 &#x02013; 10 MOI and intracellular proteins were harvested for Western immunoblot at 6 h.

Neutrophils play an important role in the pathophysiology of RSV LRTI, though RSV does not appear to directly activate neutrophils in the lower airways [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. Locally produced cytokines or other molecules released by virally infected airway epithelial cells are likely responsible for recruiting and activating neutrophils. We therefore treated primary human neutrophils from normal donors with increasing concentrations of recombinant Hsp72. Treatment with Hsp72 increased TNF&#x003b1; and IL-8 protein levels in a dose-dependent manner (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref>). Real time PCR confirmed that Hsp72-induced significantly increased TNF&#x003b1; and IL-8 mRNA levels (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3D</xref>). We also tested the effects of Hsp72 on DMSO-differentiated HL-60 cells and found a similar level of IL-8 activation. Hsp72 treatment did not alter HL-60 cell cytotoxicity as determined by lactose dehydrogenase (LDH) release into the culture media (10.4 &#x000b1; 1.2% cytotoxicity in the control compared to 11.2 &#x000b1; 0.8% cytotoxicity in the Hsp72-treated HL-60 cells; n = 4, p = 0.63). As an important control to rule out confounding effects from any potential endotoxin contamination, we pretreated cells with polymyxin B to bind endotoxin prior to Hsp72 and LPS treatment, and we boiled Hsp72 and LPS prior to addition to cells. Polymyxin B treatment did not alter IL-8 expression in Hsp72 treated cells but significantly decreased LPS-induced IL-8 expression (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>), suggesting that extracellular Hsp72 itself, and not endotoxin contamination of the recombinant protein, induces IL-8 gene expression in human neutrophils. In addition, boiled Hsp72 was unable to activate IL-8 production, while boiled LPS still induced IL-8 cytokine expression, further showing that Hsp72 and not contaminating endotoxin was responsible for the effect on cytokine production. Since we were obtaining similar cytokine regulation using HL-60 cells compared to primary human neutrophils, we performed the remaining mechanistic studies using HL-60 cells.</p><fig position="float" id="F3"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p><bold>Exogenous Hsp72 increased cytokine production in primary human neutrophils</bold>.

Pretreatment of HL-60 cells with the NF-&#x003ba;B inhibitor isohelenin completely abolished Hsp-72-induced IL-8 expression (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5A</xref>). Next, we asked whether Hsp72 regulated I&#x003ba;B&#x003b1; degradation. Treatment of HL-60 cells with Hsp72 lead to rapid degradation of I&#x003ba;B&#x003b1; followed by resynthesis of I&#x003ba;B&#x003b1; by 4 hours (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5C</xref>). The kinetics of I&#x003ba;B&#x003b1; are consistent with the fact that I&#x003ba;B&#x003b1; is rapidly degraded to allow for NF-&#x003ba;B translocation to the nucleus, and then rapidly resynthesized to terminate the NF-&#x003ba;B signal. Next, we treated cells with Hsp72 for 1 hr and nuclear extracts were harvested for EMSA. Hsp72 increased the binding of nuclear proteins to an oligonucleotide encoding the consensus sequence NF-&#x003ba;B binding site.

RSV infection further results in the release of extracellular Hsp72, an important endogenous danger signal or alarmin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. These <italic>in vitro </italic>data are further corroborated by the clinical data, in which we demonstrate increased extracellular Hsp72 levels in the pulmonary edema fluid of critically ill children with acute respiratory failure secondary to RSV bronchiolitis. The tracheal aspirates in the healthy controls were obtained from children who were electively tracheally intubated and mechanically ventilated following airway reconstruction therapy, so these children were older than and not as sick as the critically ill children with acute respiratory failure secondary to bacterial pneumonia or RSV LRTI. While children appear to have a more robust increase in Hsp72 expression compared to adults [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>], the differential Hsp72 expression in neonates versus young infants is not currently known. In separate experiments, we further show that extracellular Hsp72 increases IL-8 gene expression in neutrophils. Similar to what we have previously shown in human airway epithelial cells and mouse tracheal epithelial cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>], Hsp72-induced IL-8 gene expression in neutrophils is dependent upon activation of both TLR-4 and NF-&#x003ba;B. Collectively, these results suggest that the release of Hsp72 by virally infected cells may serve as an important endogenous danger signal to activate the host innate immune response.</p><p>The innate immune response evolved to recognize pathogen associated molecular patterns (PAMP) which are common to many classes of pathogens. PAMPs are recognized by pathogen-recognition receptors, which include the toll like receptors (TLR). TLRs recognize specific components conserved among microorganisms. For example, peptidoglycan and lipotechoic acid from Gram positive bacteria signal through TLR2 while Gram negative bacterial lipopolysaccharide signals through TLR4. Moreover, TLR4 appears to be crucial to the initiation of the innate immune response to RSV infection. For example, TLR4-deficient mice are highly susceptible to RSV infection <italic>in vivo </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. Consistent with these data, TLR4 gene polymorphisms have been associated with an increased risk of severe RSV LRTI in young infants and children [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]. Finally, RSV infection upregulates TLR4 expression in the airway epithelium <italic>in vitro </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>] and <italic>in vivo </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>]. Collectively, these data suggest that TLR4 plays an integral role in the pathobiology of RSV LRTI.</p><p>According to the danger model proposed by Matzinger [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>], PAMPs such as LPS initiate the host immune response only if there is evidence of cellular injury, as indicated by the presence of so-called danger signals or alarmins. Several potential endogenous danger signals have been described, including uric acid [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>], HMGB-1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>], ATP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>], and heat shock proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>]. Heat shock proteins, such as Hsp72 would appear to be particularly well suited to act as endogenous danger signals or alarmins. Heat shock proteins are ancient, highly conserved molecules that have been identified in virtually every cell type and every organism, both prokaryotic and eukaryotic, that have been examined to date. In comparison, the exogenous danger signal, LPS appeared relatively late on the evolutionary time-scale and is much less ubiquitous, being unique only to gram-negative bacteria. Given the stark similarities between extracellular Hsp72-mediated and LPS-mediated signal transduction pathways, it is tempting to speculate that the programmed response to the exogenous danger signal, LPS, is modeled on the more primitive programmed response to the exogenous danger signal, extracellular Hsp72 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. Hsp72 is highly stress inducible and appears to be released from stressed or damaged cells, either through an as yet undefined secretory mechanism, non-specific release during cell necrosis, or a combination of both [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. Once in the extracellular milieu, Hsp72 can act in either an autocrine or paracrine manner to increase pro-inflammatory gene expression via TLR4 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>].</p><p>The danger model is particularly relevant to the pathobiology of RSV LRTI. Neutrophils play an important role in RSV-mediated inflammation and injury [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>]. For example, neutrophils comprise over 90% of inflammatory cells recovered from the upper airways and over 75% of inflammatory cells recovered from the lower airways in children with RSV LRTI [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>]. RSV infection of the respiratory epithelium increases neutrophil adhesion and activation, which in turn further augments damage and detachment of the respiratory epithelial cells infected with the virus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>]. However, RSV does not appear to directly activate neutrophils in the lower airways [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. Rather, locally produced cytokines or other molecules &#x02013; perhaps endogenous danger signals, such as Hsp72 &#x02013; released by virally infected airway epithelial cells are likely responsible for recruiting and activating neutrophils.</p><p>Based on these data, we propose that RSV infection increases activation of stress response pathways in the airway epithelium, resulting in the increased production and subsequent release of Hsp72. Extracellular Hsp72, in turn, increases IL-8 gene expression in surrounding airway epithelial cells in a TLR4- and NF-&#x003ba;B-dependent manner [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. We cannot rule out the involvement of TLR2 in this process. We have preliminary data suggesting that cytokine expression and neutrophilia in the airways of mice following inhalation of Hsp72 were partially reduced in TLR2 knockout mice and that blocking TLR2 with an antibody prior to treatment with Hsp72 resulted in attenuated cytokine production from HL-60 cells (K. Page, unpublished observation). We are currently investigating the interactions of Hsp72 and TLRs, and we anticipate that Hsp72 will also activate TLR2. We have no evidence of Hsp72 activating any other TLR. We have previously shown that inhaled Hsp72 induced significant neutrophilia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>], however in this study we did not investigate whether the IL-8 or the Hsp72 released from airway epithelium was responsible for the recruitment of neutrophils into the airways. We did show in this study, however, that Hsp72 can directly affect neutrophil-derived cytokine production in a TLR4- and NF-&#x003ba;B-dependent manner. To our knowledge, the direct effects of extracellular Hsp72 on neutrophil chemotaxis and activation have not been previously studied [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>], though <italic>in vitro </italic>studies have suggested a potential chemotactic role for membrane-bound Hsp72 for NK cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>]. It is therefore plausible that extracellular Hsp72 derived from virally-infected epithelial cells could play an important role in both neutrophil recruitment and activation. Future studies will be necessary to further address these questions and further define the role of extracellular Hsp72 in the pathobiology of RSV LRTI.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Collectively, the results of the current study suggest that extracellular Hsp72 is released from virally infected airway epithelial cells resulting in the recruitment and activation of neutrophils. These data provide additional support for our hypothesis that extracellular Hsp72 serves as an important endogenous danger signal. Further studies on the role of extracellular Hsp72 in the pathobiology of RSV LRTI are warranted.</p></sec><sec><title>List of Abbreviations</title><p>DAMP: danger-associated molecular pattern; Hsp: heat shock protein; IL: interleukin; LPS: lipopolysaccharide; LTRI: lower respiratory tract infection; PAMP: pathogen-associated molecular pattern; RSV: respiratory syncytial virus; TLR: toll like receptor; TNF: tumor necrosis factor.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>DSW helped conceive the study and drafted the manuscript.
