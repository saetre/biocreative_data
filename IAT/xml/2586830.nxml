The capability of processing information from diverse internal and external cues is crucial to the fitness and survival of cells. As for numerous different signaling pathways, it is a common theme that certain domains with similar core structures and conserved functions, such as phosphorylation, methylation and protein recognition, have been repeatedly exploited as the building blocks for signaling proteins. The modular design of these signaling protein families allows the coupling of arrays of different input and output domains with the central conserved core function to form distinct and versatile pathways responding to a wide variety of signals. Conversely, as the sequence and structural similarity of the conserved core domains may be advantageous for interactions and communications between different signaling pathways, it also creates significant challenges to maintain the signaling specificity and fidelity among large numbers of similar signaling proteins within the same family. Thus, it becomes increasingly important to understand the interactions and specificity within a single family, which could lead to insights regarding the evolution of structure-function relationships of these signaling proteins as well as the discovery of novel cross-regulation between different pathways.</p><p id="P4">Two-component signal transduction is one of the most prevalent signaling schemes in bacteria, participating in various cell regulatory tasks such as chemotaxis, nutrition utilization, virulence, quorum sensing and cell cycle regulation. Typical two-component systems consist of two major families of signaling proteins, sensor histidine protein kinases (HKs) and response regulators (RRs) (see reviews (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">Gao <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">Stock <italic>et al.</italic>, 2000</xref>)). HKs share a kinase domain that catalyzes autophosphorylation at a conserved histidine residue, while the conserved receiver domain of RRs catalyzes transfer of a phosphoryl group from the phosphoHis of the HK to one of its own aspartate residues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1A</xref>). Signal perception by the sensing domain of the HK regulates the kinase activity and, in some bifuncitional HKs, the phosphatase activity as well, to mediate the phosphorylation level of its cognate RR. The phosphorylated RR functions as the ultimate control element that modulates the activity of its effector domain and elicits the particular response. The sensing domain of HKs and the effector domain of RRs show great diversity, which allows the utilization of the same His-Asp phosphotransfer scheme in distinct HK-RR pairs to couple diverse input stimuli, such as nutrients, redox state, osmolarity and antibiotics, to an equally diverse range of output responses, most frequently through transcriptional regulation, but also by mediation of protein-protein interactions and enzyme activities.</p><p id="P5">Most sequenced bacterial genomes encode multiple two-component proteins, with the number positively correlated with the genome size (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">Galperin, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">Ulrich and Zhulin, 2007</xref>). There are 30 HKs and 32 RRs in <italic>E. coli</italic>, and the total number of two-component proteins exceeds 200 in <italic>Myxococcus xanthus</italic> and some cyanobacteria species. Both lineage-specific expansion and horizontal gene transfer are thought to contribute to the evolution of diverse two-component pathways that allow bacteria to adapt to complex environments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">Alm <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>). The presence of many paralogous HK/RR proteins in the same cell requires individual pathways to be insulated from one another to ensure signal transmission fidelity and avoid detrimental cross-talk despite their highly similar sequences and structures. This is especially demanding for the OmpR/PhoB subfamily of RRs, they share not only similar structures for individual domains but also a common active dimer state that is believed to be conserved within the subfamily (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">Bachhawat <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">Toro-Roman <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">Toro-Roman <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005b</xref>).</p><p id="P6">RRs are classified into different subfamilies according to their effector domains. The OmpR/PhoB subfamily of RRs is the largest subfamily, characterized by a winged helix-turn-helix effector domain for DNA binding. They account for &#x0223c;30% of all RRs and half of the RRs possessing a DNA-binding domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">Galperin, 2006</xref>). Fourteen out of 32 RRs in <italic>E. coli</italic> belong to this subfamily. OmpR and PhoB, the eponymous members of this subfamily, are well-studied RRs responsible for osmoregulation and phosphate assimilation in <italic>E. coli</italic>, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">Pratt and Silhavy, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R59">Wanner, 1996</xref>). The RR receiver domain is an &#x003b1;/&#x003b2; domain with a conserved activation mechanism in which phosphorylation of the aspartate residue allosterically affects a distant surface, primarily the &#x003b1;4-&#x003b2;5-&#x003b1;5 face, to mediate inter- or intra-protein interactions. The sequence of the &#x003b1;4-&#x003b2;5-&#x003b1;5 region is highly conserved within the OmpR/PhoB subfamily with a &#x0223c;60% sequence identity compared to the 20-30% identity typically observed over the entire length of RRs. This represents a significant difference that distinguishes the OmpR/PhoB subfamily from other subfamilies, such as the NtrC/DctD and the NarL/FixJ subfamilies. Structural characterization of a few RRs from the OmpR/PhoB subfamily reveals that the &#x003b1;4-&#x003b2;5-&#x003b1;5 face is the dimerization interface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1B</xref>) with a common set of hydrophobic and charged residues involved in van der Waals contact and salt bridges (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1C</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">Toro-Roman <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005a</xref>).</p><p id="P7">The sequence conservation of the contacting residues suggests a similar dimerization interface for most OmpR/PhoB subfamily members. Given the prevalence of this subfamily in bacteria, it is important to question the specificity of the dimerizing interactions among subfamily members and whether RR heterodimers can form. While unproductive RR heterodimers could be problematic for the fidelity of signal transmission, particular heterodimer pairs might be valuable to the integration of different pathways via transcription of a distinct set of heterodimer-regulated genes for a coordinated response to complex environmental conditions.</p><p id="P8">In contrast to eukaryotic signaling pathways in which the regulatory roles of both homodimers and heterodimers are well documented, e.g. the receptor tyrosine kinase family and the nuclear hormone receptor superfamily (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">Aranda and Pascual, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">de Lera <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">Schlessinger, 2000</xref>), RR heterodimers are rarely reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">Knutsen <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>) and the dimerization specificity of RRs is uncharacterized. Here we report development of a strategy to investigate RR dimerization via measuring the f&#x000f6;rster resonance energy transfer (FRET) between CFP- and YFP-fused RRs <italic>in vitro</italic>. The FRET method allowed us to systematically analyze all possible protein-protein interactions among 14 OmpR/PhoB subfamily members from <italic>E. coli</italic>. We demonstrate that these RRs show significant dimerization specificity in spite of the conserved residues at the dimerization interface. Further, interactions between several different RRs do occur, suggesting potential cross-regulation between some two-component pathways.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="S2"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>Functional Characterization of Fluorescent Protein (FP) Fused PhoB</title><p id="P9">PhoB, a representative member of the OmpR/PhoB subfamily, is one of the most extensively studied RRs in <italic>E. coli</italic> and was chosen to establish the FRET method for RR interactions. Paired with the HK PhoR, PhoB responds to phosphate (Pi)-limiting conditions and regulates a large set of genes involved in Pi uptake and utilization of alternative phosphorus sources, including <italic>phoA</italic>, which encodes an alkaline phosphatase (AP) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">Lamarche <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R58">Wanner, 1993</xref>). As previously demonstrated, assays of alkaline phosphatase activity showed minimal expression of <italic>phoA</italic> under high phosphate conditions, while low phosphate in the media activated PhoB to promote <italic>phoA</italic> expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref>). Cyan fluorescent protein (CFP) and yellow fluorescent protein (YFP) were fused at the N terminus of PhoB with flexible linkers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2A</xref>). When expressed at similar levels as wild-type PhoB in an <italic>E. coli phoB</italic> deletion strain, both FP-fused PhoB proteins activated <italic>phoA</italic> expression, although the levels of AP activity were lower compared to the corresponding level in the wild-type strain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2B</xref>). The lower <italic>phoA</italic> expression might result from less efficient phosphorylation by the kinase, weaker DNA binding or non-optimal interaction with RNA polymerase compared to wild-type PhoB. Nevertheless, both FP-PhoB proteins regulate <italic>phoA</italic> expression in response to phosphate-limitation, functionally complementing the <italic>phoB</italic> deletion.</p><p id="P10">It has been shown that phosphorylation of PhoB decreases its intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence and the kinetics of fluorescence quenching reflects the phosphorylation kinetics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">McCleary, 1996</xref>). Both CFP-PhoB and YFP-PhoB showed the characteristic tryptophan fluorescence quenching upon addition of the small molecule phosphodonor phosphoramidate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2C</xref>). The difference in the percentage of fluorescence change is likely due to the different number of tryptophan residues in PhoB (3) and FP-PhoB proteins (5). Moreover, the fluorescence quenching kinetics can be fitted to a pseudo first order rate equation with the apparent rate constant of 0.0066 s<sup>-1</sup> for CFP-PhoB and 0.0035 s<sup>-1</sup> for YFP-PhoB, close to that of PhoB alone (0.0056 s<sup>-1</sup>), showing that both FP-PhoB proteins can be phosphorylated by phosphoramidate <italic>in vitro</italic> similarly as PhoB.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Analysis of Phosphorylation-dependent PhoB Dimerization by FRET</title><p id="P11">The interaction between CFP- and YFP-fused PhoB proteins is measured by the distance-dependent energy transfer from the excited donor CFP to the acceptor YFP. A higher ratio of yellow (527 nm) to cyan emission (475 nm) indicates more interacting CFP/YFP pairs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3A</xref>). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3B</xref>, the FRET ratio (emission ratio 527 nm:475 nm) remained steady before addition of the phosphodonor phosphoramidate and phosphorylation promoted FRET between CFP-/YFP-fused PhoB with the FRET ratio reaching a maximum in 10 minutes. Cleaving the trypsin-susceptible linker between YFP and PhoB separated YFP from interacting PhoB proteins, and quickly returned the FRET ratio to the pre-phosphorylation level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3B</xref> and S1). The similar FRET ratio for unphosphorylated and cleaved pairs suggests that there is little PhoB dimerization in the absence of phosphorylation at the experimental concentration (2.7 &#x003bc;M), which is significantly below the reported dissociation constant (K<sub>D</sub>: 378 &#x003bc;M) for unphosphorylated PhoB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">Mack, 2008</xref>). Furthermore, the FRET ratio increased at a parallel rate as the quenching of tryptophan fluorescence with comparable apparent rate constants, 0.0039 s<sup>-1</sup> for the FRET ratio change and 0.0041 s<sup>-1</sup> for phosphorylation-induced tryptophan fluorescence quenching (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3C</xref>). This reveals phosphorylation as the rate-limiting step and indicates that the rate of FRET ratio change can be used to follow phosphorylation kinetics.</p><p id="P12">Phosphorylated free PhoB proteins successfully competed for interaction with FP-PhoB fusions and reduced the number of CFP/YFP pairs, as illustrated by the decreased FRET ratio when PhoB was added (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3D</xref>). Hence the FP-PhoB interaction reported by FRET appears reversible and specific to PhoB. To examine the oligomer species formed by FP-PhoB proteins, sedimentation velocity (SV) analyses were performed using an analytical ultracentrifuge. Continuous sedimentation distribution (<italic>c</italic>(<italic>s</italic>)) of the unphosphorylated FP-PhoB mixture featured a major peak at a sedimentation coefficient of 3.7 S, corresponding to a molecular weight (M.W.) of &#x0223c;54 kDa that is close to the M.W. for a FP-PhoB monomer (55 kDa). The phosphorylated mixture exhibited a peak at a larger sedimentation coefficient of 5.4 S with a corresponding M.W. of &#x0223c;100 kDa. The observation of a single peak with a M.W. slightly smaller than the 110 kDa M.W. for a FP-PhoB dimer is consistent with a fast monomer-dimer equilibrium for phosphorylated FP-PhoB proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3E</xref> and S2). The absence of any significant peak at a higher sedimentation coefficient again proves that no higher-order irreversible aggregates formed after phosphorylation.</p><p id="P13">Given a monomer-dimer equilibrium for FP-PhoB, the concentration of the FRET-capable CFP/YFP-PhoB dimers can be expressed as a function of the dimerization K<sub>D</sub> and the concentrations of CFP-PhoB and YFP-PhoB (see Materials and Methods). Because the decrease of cyan fluorescence (475 nm) upon phosphorylation is directly proportional to the concentration of the FRET-capable dimers, the cyan fluorescence under different initial FP-PhoB concentrations was measured to determine the dissociation constant K<sub>D</sub> of FP-PhoB interaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4</xref>). The K<sub>D</sub> was estimated to be 4.4 &#x003bc;M for FP-PhoB, similar as the K<sub>D</sub> of 5.1 &#x003bc;M for PhoB determined by analytical ultracentrifugation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">Mack, 2008</xref>). Therefore, FP-PhoB proteins display a similar dimerization affinity as PhoB and the FRET method is validated for investigation of RR dimerization.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>OmpR Dimerization</title><p id="P14">OmpR, another representative of the OmpR/PhoB subfamily, reciprocally regulates two porin genes, <italic>ompC</italic> and <italic>ompF</italic>, in response to environmental osmolarity sensed by the cognate HK EnvZ. The dimerization of FP-OmpR was analyzed in detail by the FRET method. When FP-OmpR mixtures were phosphorylated by phosphoramidate, the FRET ratio increased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5A</xref>), but with slower phosphorylation kinetics than FP-PhoB. Addition of a C1 DNA oligonucleotide duplex containing two OmpR-binding half-sites from the <italic>ompC</italic> promoter greatly increased the FRET ratio even in the absence of phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5B</xref>), consistent with earlier reports that DNA binding stimulates OmpR dimerization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">Harlocker <italic>et al.</italic>, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">Maris <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>). This dimerization could result from simultaneous binding of two OmpR molecules to the same DNA fragment. Interestingly, the FRET ratio did not decrease after further addition of C1 DNA over the stoichiometric amount, suggesting that the binding of OmpR to C1 DNA is highly cooperative, which agrees with the observation that OmpR binds DNA as dimers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">Harlocker <italic>et al.</italic>, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R63">Yoshida <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>FRET between FP-RR Pairs from the <italic>E. coli</italic> OmpR/PhoB Subfamily</title><p id="P15">FRET between FP-fused PhoB and OmpR clearly reported phosphorylation-induced RR dimerization. Therefore we sought to characterize the interaction specificity by examining FRET between all pairs of <italic>E. coli</italic> OmpR/PhoB RR subfamily members. CFP and YFP were fused to all 14 subfamily members and FRET between purified proteins was analyzed using a fluorescence plate reader. All but one homo-pair (CFP-BasR/YFP-BasR) from the OmpR/PhoB RR subfamily showed increases of FRET ratio upon phosphorylation, while NarL and the receiver domain of NtrC (NtrCn), two RRs from other families, did not have any significant FRET (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6A</xref> and S3). The extent of FRET varied greatly from protein to protein, which may result from differences in interaction affinities, oligomeric states of phosphorylated RRs, levels of RR phosphorylation or positioning of FPs relative to RRs. The rate of FRET increase also varied, with the ratio reaching a maximum in less than 500 s for CusR and still increasing after &#x0223c;3000 s for QseB and YedW, reflecting different kinetics of RR phosphorylation.</p><p id="P16">The changes in FRET ratio after &#x0223c;55 minutes of phosphorylation were used to compare the strength of interaction between homo- and hetero-pairs of RRs. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6B</xref>, for CFP-ArcA, the highest FRET occurred when mixed with YFP-ArcA while a modest but significant FRET ratio increase was evident for YFP-CpxR. The other hetero-pairs with CFP-ArcA showed minimal changes in FRET ratio that were not greatly different from those of unphosphorylated pairs, indicating a highly specific ArcA interaction with little cross-talk to other RRs. Notably, YFP-ArcA exhibits no significant FRET in most hetero-pairs but an intermediate FRET signal with CFP-CpxR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6C</xref>), which mirrors the pattern of interactions between CFP-ArcA and other YFP-RRs. Moreover, titration of free ArcA protein into the CFP-ArcA/YFP-CpxR mix reduced the FRET ratio significantly, demonstrating the reversibility and specificity of ArcA/CpxR interaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6D</xref>).</p><p id="P17">The trend of homodimerization specificity holds for all members of the <italic>E. coli</italic> OmpR/PhoB subfamily; FRET was strongest for homo-pairs and there was little interaction between most hetero-pairs of RRs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6C</xref> and S3). In a given hetero-pair, the formation of the CFP-RR homodimer or the YFP-RR homodimer is favored over the formation of the CFP-RR/YFP-RR heterodimer due to the preference for an RR to interact with itself. Nevertheless, intermediate changes of the FRET ratio were still observed for a limited number of hetero-RR pairs, including reciprocal pairs such as ArcA/CpxR, PhoB/CpxR, CusR/CpxR, KdpE/RstA and YedW/CusR, as well as lone pairs such as CFP-CpxR/YFP-OmpR, CFP-CpxR/YFP-BaeR, CFP-CpxR/YFP-CreB, CFP-CpxR/YFP-BasR, CFP-BaeR/YFP-PhoB, CFP-KdpE/YFP-PhoB and CFP-YedW/YFP-KdpE. FRET signals in these hetero-pairs were generally much weaker than their respective homo-pairs and unequal concentrations of CFP-RR and YFP-RR may result in the observation of small FRET signals in only one pair and not in the reciprocal one.</p><p id="P18">CFP-CpxR is distinguished from other FP-RR hybrids as fusion of CpxR alters the emission spectrum of CFP. However the alteration was not observed for YFP-CpxR or the mixture of free CpxR and CFP. Further, phosphorylation shifts the emission peak of CFP-CpxR and results in a decreased ratio of 527 nm/475 nm upon phosphorylation. (Fig. S4). Therefore, the decreased FRET ratio of the CFP-CpxR/YFP pair was used to correct for the FRET ratio changes of all other pairs. Interestingly, weak FRET was suggested between CFP-CpxR and multiple RRs, such as YFP-ArcA, YFP-PhoB and YFP-CusR, which correlates with the FRET for those reciprocal pairs, CFP-ArcA/YFP-CpxR, CFP-PhoB/YFP-CpxR and CFP-CusR/YFP-CpxR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6C</xref> and S4). The C-terminal DNA-binding domain does not appear to be essential for CpxR to interact with ArcA, OmpR, PhoB, CusR and itself, because the CFP-fused N-terminal receiver domain of CpxR displayed equal or even stronger FRET with these RRs than the full-length CpxR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6E</xref>). Meanwhile, deletion of the DNA-binding domain completely abolished the FRET in some other pairs, such as CpxR/BaeR, suggesting that the DNA-binding domain can also play a role in interaction of some hetero-pairs.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="S7"><title>Discussion</title><sec id="S8"><title>FRET Analysis of RR Dimerization</title><p id="P19">Protein-protein interaction is crucial for the connectivity of signaling pathways within a regulatory network. A relatively small number of protein folds and families are repeatedly used in various signaling tasks, demanding specific interactions among many structurally and functionally similar proteins. One such example in prokaryotic signaling is the prevalent OmpR/PhoB subfamily of response regulators. They are believed to share a conserved dimerization interface, which is challenging for interaction specificity and also offers opportunity for beneficial connections to integrate signaling pathways. In this study we developed a FRET-based strategy to characterize the interactions at a system level within the OmpR/PhoB subfamily of RRs.</p><p id="P20">Phosphorylation-dependent FRET has been successfully observed between CFP- and YFP-fused RR pairs. Binding to the target DNA sequence also promoted the interaction of FP-OmpR pairs. Previously, the dimerization of OmpR in the absence of DNA was reported only in crosslinking studies and was not seen in other methods such as gel-filtration and light scattering (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">Harlocker <italic>et al.</italic>, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">Maris <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>), implying the transient nature of OmpR interaction. The FRET method is apparently effective in capturing this weak OmpR interaction. Moreover, the rate of FRET change has been shown to reflect phosphorylation kinetics, which might be useful in future investigations of time-dependent signaling and RR phosphorylation <italic>in vivo</italic> by fluorescence imaging of bacterial cells.</p><p id="P21">About 60% of RRs have a C-terminal DNA-binding domain and phosphorylation-mediated dimerization or oligomerization is generally considered important for transcription regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">Galperin, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">Stock <italic>et al.</italic>, 2000</xref>). Yet not all FP-RR pairs showed significant FRET upon phosphorylation. It has been demonstrated that phosphorylation of the nitrogen regulator NtrC, a member of the NtrC/DctD RR subfamily, causes the receiver domain from one subunit to interact with the ATPase domain of a second subunit for oligomerization and the isolated receiver domain of NtrC remains monomeric after phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">De Carlo <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">Kern <italic>et al.</italic>, 1999</xref>). Thus it is not surprising that no FRET occurred between FP-fused receiver domains of NtrC since the interaction partner ATPase domain is absent.

Accordingly, our FRET analyses revealed no interaction for NarL but significant FRET for FixJ. Therefore, although RR multimerization is usually deemed necessary for transcription regulation, the actual interaction mechanism differs and some RR proteins do not have a strong interaction in the absence of DNA.</p><p id="P22">In contrast, phosphorylation increased FRET for almost all <italic>E. coli</italic> OmpR/PhoB subfamily RRs except BasR. The absence of any FRET for FP-BasR could result from low affinity of dimerization or insufficient phosphorylation. Sedimentation velocity analysis of YFP-BasR at a higher concentration (6.9 &#x003bc;M) demonstrated a species with the M.W. of a dimer in addition to the monomer species (Fig. S2). The presence of two peaks instead of a single peak suggested a slow rate of exchange between two species, which is compatible with either a slow monomer-dimer equilibrium or the existence of both phosphorylated and unphosphorylated BasR species due to substoichiometric phosphorylation. Nevertheless, FP-BasR could dimerize upon phosphorylation despite the absence of observable FRET. Taken together, phosphorylation-promoted multimerization appears to be a common feature for all <italic>E. coli</italic> OmpR/PhoB subfamily RRs. Such interactions do not require the binding of the RR to DNA, although DNA binding might be expected to enhance the interaction</p></sec><sec id="S9"><title>Limitations of <italic>in vitro</italic> Analysis</title><p id="P23">As suggested in FP-BasR interactions, FRET intensities can be restricted by levels of RR phosphorylation <italic>in vitro</italic>. Some full-length RRs have been shown to be substoichiometrically phosphorylated by phosphoramidate <italic>in vitro</italic>, attributable in at least one case to decreased phosphotransfer rates resulting from inhibitory interactions of the N-terminal receiver domain and the C-terminal DNA-binding domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">Friedland <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>). Slightly different FRET profiles were observed for full-length CpxR and the N-terminal receiver domain of CpxR, potentially resulting from either different phosphorylation levels and/or direct interactions of the DNA-binding domains. Future investigation of FRET profiles of all the N-terminal domains of <italic>E. coli</italic> OmpR/PhoB subfamily RRs will be valuable to address the contributions of the C-terminal output domain. An additional consideration is that RR phosphorylation by small molecule phosphodonors is generally less efficient than phosphorylation by the cognate HK (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">Da Re <italic>et al.</italic>, 1999b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">Mayover <italic>et al.</italic>, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">Silversmith <italic>et al.</italic>, 1997</xref>). For some RRs in our experiments with phosphoramidate as phosphodonor, phosphorylation did not reach a steady state even after 55 minutes. A faster rate of phosphotransfer from the cognate HK with a comparable rate of RR dephosphorylation, would achieve both more rapid kinetics and a greater steady state stoichiometry of phosphorylation. Thus the phosphorylation-induced interaction observed in our FRET studies might be expected to underrepresent interactions that might be promoted by a higher level of RR phosphorylation catalyzed by an activated HK <italic>in vivo</italic>. Understanding the regulatory roles of homodimers and heterodimers will require the characterization of both RR interaction and phosphorylation <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p><p id="P24">Our systematic FRET measurements do not provide details of the interaction for all RRs, for instance, the oligomeric states or the exact K<sub>D</sub> values as it is not practical to determine the concentration-dependent FRET for all possible RR pairs. FRET between FP-fused RRs could result from RR dimerization as well as interactions of RR dimers or formation of higher-order oligomers. Extensive analyses of FP-PhoB do suggest dimer formation and give a K<sub>D</sub> value comparable to that determined by other methods. Moreover, the distance-dependent FRET parameters can also be deduced from the in-depth FRET measurement of FP-PhoB. Assuming the same positioning of fluorescent proteins for all RR pairs, the FRET ratio changes can potentially be used to estimate the K<sub>D</sub> based on the FRET parameters determined from the FP-PhoB dimerization model. However, many homo-pairs, such as TorR, CusR and ArcA, showed an exceptionally large increase of the FRET ratio, giving unrealistic K<sub>D</sub> values (data not shown). Hence the original assumption of identical positioning of FP fluorophores seems to be incorrect or these RRs can form higher order oligomers leaving the dimerization model unsuitable for calculations. Indeed ArcA has been shown to form oligomers in solution and TorR oligomerization has been suggested to play a role in gene regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">Jeon <italic>et al.</italic>, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">Simon <italic>et al.</italic>, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">Toro-Roman <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005a</xref>). The exact structural details of oligomerization are not known, but since the structures of the receiver domains of TorR and ArcA show an &#x003b1;4-&#x003b2;5-&#x003b1;5 dimerization interface similar to that of other OmpR/PhoB subfamily RRs (KdpE, PhoB and PhoP) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">Bachhawat <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">Bachhawat and Stock, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">Toro-Roman <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">Toro-Roman <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005b</xref>), higher order oligomers are assumed to involve associations of this dimeric unit.

All these features of sequences, structures and protein-protein interactions are consistent with a model of phosphorylation promoting the formation of a common active dimer state within the OmpR/PhoB subfamily. Even though a conserved dimer structure is suggested for subfamily members, their interactions still remain specific. Homo-pairs of FP-RRs gave the strongest FRET while meaningful FRET signals between hetero-pairs were restricted to a small number of RRs. It seems that RRs prefer to interact with themselves and the interactions of hetero-pairs are weak compared to homo-pairs.</p><p id="P26">The specificity likely arises from interacting sidechains in the &#x003b1;4-&#x003b2;5-&#x003b1;5 interface because the backbones of &#x003b1;4-&#x003b2;5-&#x003b1;5 regions are well aligned in five available active dimer structures (ArcA, KdpE, PhoB, PhoP and TorR) and are thus not expected to contribute significantly to the interaction specificity. A distinctive feature for the &#x003b1;4-&#x003b2;5-&#x003b1;5 dimerization interface is the formation of an extensive network of salt bridges by a conserved set of charged residues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">Toro-Roman <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005a</xref>). Two charged sidechains (<italic>d</italic> positions in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1C</xref>) are absolutely conserved at the center of the dimerization interface and have been proved crucial for the dimerization of PhoB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">Mack, 2008</xref>). Other salt-bridge-forming residues are usually conserved but not present in all the OmpR/PhoB subfamily members of <italic>E. coli</italic>, such as the residues corresponding to E94 and R115 in ArcA (<italic>b</italic> positions in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1C</xref>). These two positions are occupied by a reverse pair of charged residues in QseB and two polar residues in PhoP. Interestingly, both QseB and PhoP did not show any intermediate level of FRET with other RRs thus the unique residues at these two positions may play a role in their interaction specificity. A few other positions display similar patterns of variance with only one or two RRs deviating from the consensus and there is one peripheral contacting pair with slightly higher variations. Cumulatively, the combination of these subtle changes at different positions, as well as potential conformational perturbations of the conserved interface residues from distant parts of the structure, may contribute to the interaction specificity within the OmpR/PhoB subfamily.</p><p id="P27">A proper and accurate response to stimuli relies heavily on the specificity of signaling components to keep the signaling pathways insulated from one another. The mechanisms for signaling specificity have attracted great interest in many different systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">Laub and Goulian, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">Pawson and Nash, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">Ubersax and Ferrell Jr, 2007</xref>). One of the central issues for the specificity involves correct molecular recognition along the pathway. The two-component system usually features a series of recognition events, including the dimerization of HKs for autophosphorylation, the HK-RR interaction for phosphotransfer and, for most RRs, the dimerization of RRs and DNA recognition for transcriptional control. It has been shown that HKs exhibit a global kinetic preference for phosphotransfer to their cognate RRs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">Skerker <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>), which is likely mediated by the specific interaction between a HK and its cognate RR. Here we demonstrate that RR dimerization is also specific with little cross-talk between highly similar proteins. All these precise recognition events ensure that one stimulus does not mistakenly activate another pathway, thus avoiding the commitment of resources to futile activities.</p></sec><sec id="S11"><title>Heterodimerization of OmpR/PhoB RRs</title><p id="P28">On the other hand, the homodimerization specificity does not completely exclude the possibility for heterodimer formation. FRET signals between hetero-pairs were observed for a small number of RRs. Some of these interactions are between RR pairs with highly similar sequences, e.g. YedW and CusR. CusR belongs to the copper-responsive CusS/CusR two-component system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">Munson <italic>et al.</italic>, 2000</xref>) and shares &#x0223c;50% sequence identity with YedW. YedV, the cognate HK of YedW, has been shown to transphosphorylate CusR <italic>in vitro</italic> although it is not clear whether such cross-talk would occur <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R60">Yamamoto <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>). Nevertheless these two systems are closely related as copper can also activate the transcription of <italic>yedVW</italic> in a CusR-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R62">Yamamoto and Ishihama, 2006</xref>). The interaction between CusR and YedW might result from the sequence similarity and provide potential regulatory roles. Similar examples are the interactions between YFP-PhoB and CFP-BaeR or CFP-KdpE. A few non-cognate HKs, including CreC, KdpD, BaeS and more, have been found to activate PhoB in the absence of the cognate HK PhoR and cross-regulation has been implied among the PhoBR, CreBC and BaeRS systems, although cross-regulation is likely at the transcription level instead of the level of transphosphorylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">Amemura <italic>et al.</italic>, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">Laub and Goulian, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">Nishino <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57">Wanner, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R65">Zhou <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>). It is possible that these interactions between RR hetero-pairs might be involved in cross-regulation.</p><p id="P29">Hetero-pair interactions are not restricted to RR pairs with close sequence similarity but also include more distant pairs, such as KdpE/RstA and CusR/CpxR. It is especially interesting that CpxR is able to interact with multiple RRs, such as ArcA, PhoB, OmpR, BaeR, CusR and more. The CpxAR two-component system is a global regulatory system that responds to cell envelope stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">De Wulf <italic>et al.</italic>, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">Dorel <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">Ruiz and Silhavy, 2005</xref>). Cell envelope integrity and cell surface properties are obviously closely monitored by bacterial cells and can influence a wide variety of regulatory pathways. For instance, the copper stress response and oxygen limitation response are tightly correlated with the CpxR-mediated envelop stress response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">Partridge <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R62">Yamamoto and Ishihama, 2006</xref>). It has been shown that CpxR also regulates genes that are controlled by other response regulators, such as the redox regulator ArcA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">Partridge <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>), the osmoregulator OmpR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">Batchelor <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">Jubelin <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>) and another envelope stress regulator BaeR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">Hirakawa <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">Raffa and Raivio, 2002</xref>), with some even having overlapping DNA-binding sites. The interactions between these hetero-pairs could certainly play a role in cross-regulation of CpxR with these different RRs.</p><p id="P30">Traditionally, transcription co-regulation by different RRs is presumed to occur through simultaneous binding of different RR homodimers to the same promoter for concerted regulation. The formation of RR heterodimers gives rise to a distinct co-regulation mechanism in which heterodimers can influence or compete with the formation of homodimers. However, the hetero-pair interactions are generally weaker than the interaction of homo-pairs as indicated by the FRET signal intensity. Thus, there might not be a significant amount of heterodimers available when the level of phosphorylated RR is low. A few RRs, like PhoB, CusR and CpxR, can activate their own expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">Guan <italic>et al.</italic>, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">Hoffer <italic>et al.</italic>, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">Raivio <italic>et al.</italic>, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R61">Yamamoto and Ishihama, 2005</xref>), giving higher concentration of phosphorylated RR when the system is fully activated, which could potentially allow heterodimer formation even with a low affinity. Moreover, heterodimers can align two different DNA binding domains, providing the potential for recognition of a unique set of hybrid sites with each of the two half-sites corresponding to the recognition elements of different RRs. Since DNA binding to tandem sites has been shown to enhance RR homodimerization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">Maris <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>), binding to such heterodimer-specific DNA sites might also increase the heterodimerization affinity to allow sufficient heterodimers to form. The potential regulatory roles of heterodimers can be either negative or positive as nonfunctional heterodimers can serve as dead-end complexes to compete with homodimers, while functional heterodimers can recognize novel sites to regulate transcription of a completely different set of genes than those regulated by either parent homodimer. Such regulations has not yet been reported in OmpR/PhoB subfamily RRs, but precedent exists in heterodimers of the LytR subfamily RRs, ComE and BlpR, that have been suggested to recognize a hybrid DNA motif for convergent gene regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">Knutsen <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>).</p><p id="P31">In summary, our FRET analyses provide a systematic view of RR interactions in two-component signal transduction pathways of <italic>E. coli</italic> and demonstrate the interaction specificity within the largest RR subfamily, the OmpR/PhoB subfamily. It is not clear whether such specificity is evolutionarily optimized within individual organisms and whether cross-reactions could occur more readily between paralogous proteins from different species as shown in interactions of Src homology 3 (SH3) domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R64">Zarrinpar <italic>et al.</italic>, 2003</xref>). Specific RR interactions, together with phospho-transfer specificity, ensure signal transmission fidelity for individual HK-RR pathways despite the highly conserved core structures and functions shared by a large number of different two-component proteins in a cell. However, the specificity between signaling pathways does not mean the isolation of individual pathways. Instead, cells coordinate responses to a complex environment through a network of interacting pathways. It is well known that the connections and communications of signaling proteins greatly contribute to the complexity of eukaryotic signaling networks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">Bhattacharyya <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>). Recently it has begun to emerge that two-component signal transduction is not merely comprised of linear pathways but that cross-regulation does occur at multiple levels (see reviews (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">Bijlsma and Groisman, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">Laub and Goulian, 2007</xref>)). One of the common mechanisms of signal integration is through converging distinct pathways to the transcription regulation of overlapping groups of genes. Our discovery of interactions between RR hetero-pairs raises the possibility of an additional mechanism that could facilitate cross-regulation. These interactions may play a significant role in integrating and coordinating responses to a wide variety of environmental stimuli.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="S12"><title>Experimental procedures</title><sec id="S13"><title>Strains and plasmids</title><p id="P32">The strains and plasmids used in this study are listed in Table S1.

The FRET ratio before phosphorylation was subtracted to calculate the change of FRET ratio. For the PhoB competition experiment, after the FRET ratio reached a plateau for the phosphorylated CFP-PhoB/YFP-PhoB mixture, 20 &#x003bc;l PhoB (68 &#x003bc;M) was titrated into 1 ml mixture. Additions were spaced by 10-min intervals to allow phosphorylation of newly added PhoB and the tryptophan fluorescence quenching also indicated that the phosphorylation reached a steady state before the next addition. Similar protocols were followed for the titration of ArcA into the CFP-ArcA/YFP-CpxR mixture. To examine the effect of DNA binding on FP-OmpR interaction, two complementary oligonucleotides were heated to 85&#x000b0;C and slowly cooled to room temperature to generate the DNA duplex corresponding to the C1 DNA binding site from the <italic>ompC</italic> promoter (5&#x02032;-TCCCTTGCATTTACATTTTGAAACATCTATAGCGAT-3&#x02032;). 5 &#x003bc;l of C1 DNA (77 &#x003bc;M) was repeatedly titrated into 2 ml of the FP-OmpR mix and the fluorescence was measured.</p><p id="P38">To determine the dissociation constant (K<sub>D</sub>) of FP-PhoB, CFP fluorescence at 475 nm was measured for CFP-/YFP-PhoB mixtures at different concentrations. YFP-PhoB (30 &#x003bc;M) and indicated concentrations of CFP-PhoB were mixed and phosphorylated prior to the titration of 20 &#x003bc;l of the mixture into 1 ml of phosphorylated CFP-PhoB at the same indicated concentrations. Experiments were done at three different initial CFP-PhoB concentrations and the fluorescence values were recorded. The decreases of CFP fluorescence were plotted against the concentration of YFP-PhoB and simultaneous fitting of all three curves was performed using OriginPro8 (OriginLab).</p></sec><sec id="S18"><title>Systematic analyses of FRET between FP-RR pairs</title><p id="P39">FRET between all the FP-RR pairs were determined with a Varioskan fluorescence plate reader (Thermo Electron Corporation). Fluorescence was measured at 475 nm and 527 nm with excitation at 430 nm at 30&#x000b0;C. CFP-RR and YFP-RR were diluted into the reaction buffer and the total volume was 140 &#x003bc;l. Phosphorylation was initiated by addition of 40 &#x003bc;l of phosphoramidate and MgSO<sub>4</sub>. The final concentrations were 0.6 &#x003bc;M CFP-RR, 2.5 &#x003bc;M YFP-RR, 20 mM phosphoramidate and 5 mM MgSO<sub>4</sub>. Fluorescence was followed immediately after the addition and every 450 s thereafter until 3150 s. FRET ratio changes were calculated as described earlier.</p></sec><sec id="S19"><title>Equilibrium calculations</title><p id="P40">There are four potential equilibria coexisting for a given hetero-pair:<disp-formula id="FD1"><label>(1)</label><mml:math display="block" id="M1" overflow="scroll"><mml:mrow><mml:mn>2</mml:mn><mml:mi>C</mml:mi><mml:mo>&#x02194;</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi>C</mml:mi><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:msub><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:mn>2</mml:mn><mml:mi>Y</mml:mi><mml:mo>&#x02194;</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi>Y</mml:mi><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:msub><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:mi>C</mml:mi><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:mi>Y</mml:mi><mml:mo>&#x02194;</mml:mo><mml:mi>C</mml:mi><mml:mi>Y</mml:mi><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:mi>C</mml:mi><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:mi>Y</mml:mi><mml:mo>&#x02194;</mml:mo><mml:mi>Y</mml:mi><mml:mi>C</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:math></disp-formula>because the <italic>CY</italic> and <italic>YC</italic> heterodimers may have different dissociation constants due to the asymmetric tandem arrangement of their DNA-binding domains.

Schematic outline of a typical two-component system. The pathway features transfer of a phosphoryl group (red) between the conserved histidine kinase and receiver domains (HisK and REC, grey). Sensing of input stimuli by the HK modulates the kinase or phosphatase activity and regulates the phosphorylation level of the RR. The phosphorylated RR elicits the output response through the effector domain.</p><p>B. Dimer structure of the PhoB receiver domain (PDB ID: 1ZES). The receiver domain has a conserved (&#x003b2;&#x003b1;)<sub>5</sub> fold (teal blue) and the OmpR/PhoB RR subfamily appears to share a conserved dimeric structure once phosphorylated. The non-covalent phosphoryl analog berryllofluoride (BeF<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>) coordinates to the conserved aspartate residue (red), allosterically perturbing the &#x003b1;4-&#x003b2;5-&#x003b1;5 surface (green) and promoting dimerization.</p><p>C. Sequence alignment of the &#x003b1;4-&#x003b2;5-&#x003b1;5 region of <italic>E. coli</italic> RRs. Full-length RR sequences are aligned by ClustalX (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">Thompson <italic>et al.</italic>, 1997</xref>) and only the &#x003b1;4-&#x003b2;5-&#x003b1;5 region is shown. Sequence numbering is for ArcA. RRs include all <italic>E. coli</italic> OmpR/PhoB subfamily members and some representatives from other subfamilies. Among the highly conserved residues within the OmpR/PhoB subfamily are the highlighted residues that are involved in intermolecular interactions: hydrophobic contacts (blue); charged residues for salt bridge formation (orange). The pairing of charged residues is labeled by four pairs of letters <italic>a</italic>, <italic>b</italic>, <italic>c</italic> and <italic>d</italic>. A red highlight represents a pair of residues that are not conserved but could still complement each other with reversed charges. All these highlighted residues are not well conserved in RRs from other families.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="nihms-65545-f0001"/></fig><fig id="F2" position="float"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><p>Alkaline phosphatase assays and <italic>in vitro</italic> phosphorylation of FP-PhoB hybrids.</p><p>A.

A <italic>phoB</italic> deletion strain carrying either pRG20 (CFP-PhoB) or pRG94 (YFP-PhoB) and the wild-type strain BW25113 were assayed for alkaline phosphatase activity under low phosphate (white) and high phosphate (grey) conditions. FP-PhoB hybrids were induced by IPTG to an expression level of protein comparable to that of wild-type PhoB. The data are from three replicates. Protein expression levels were confirmed to be comparable by western blot analyses (data not shown).</p><p>C. Tryptophan fluorescence quenching upon phosphorylation. Tryptophan fluorescence of individual PhoB proteins (2 &#x003bc;M) was monitored at the emission wavelength of 345 nm with the excitation at 295 nm. Proteins include CFP-PhoB (open triangle), YFP-PhoB (open circle) and PhoB (solid squares). These proteins were mixed with 20 mM phosphoramidate in the reaction buffer and the phosphorylation was initiated by addition of MgSO<sub>4</sub> to a final concentration of 5 mM.

Competition of ArcA with the interaction between CFP-ArcA and YFP-CpxR. ArcA protein was titrated into the sample containing phosphorylated CFP-ArcA (0.6 &#x003bc;M) and YFP-CpxR (2.5 &#x003bc;M) followed by the measurement of fluorescence with a fluorometer.
