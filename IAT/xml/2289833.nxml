For improving local control via radiotherapy, it is important to use additional antitumor agents.

Radiation therapy can be used to treat all stages of cervical cancer. Many cervical cancers are very radiosensitive, and radiotherapy gives good results; however, residual disease causes clinical relapse. Thus, for improving the local control of cervical cancer, the combination of radiation with additional anti-tumor agents is warranted. Against this background, concurrent chemoradiation with a cisplatin-based regimen has recently been used to treat advanced cervical cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. However, the treatment causes strong side effects such as digestive symptoms (vomiting and diarrhea) and bone marrow suppression. Thus, drugs with fewer side effects and a superior effect in combination are desired.</p><p>Aminopeptidase N (APN)/CD13 is a zinc-binding type 2 transmembrane ectopeptidase of 150 kDa that forms a noncovalently bound homodimer on the cellular membrane. Although APN/CD13 was first described as a marker for hematopoietic cells of myeloid origin, expression has been reported on non-hematopoietic cells and tissues, such as fibroblasts, brain cells, and epithelial cells of the liver, kidney, and intestine. High expression levels of APN/CD13 have been detected in various solid tumors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. The expression level of APN/CD13 was found to correlate with increased malignant behavior in prostate, colon, and non-small cell lung cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. Ubenimex, a CD13/aminopeptidase N (APN) inhibitor, has been shown to be cytotoxic to tumor cell lines <italic>in vitro</italic>, and it dose-dependently inhibits the growth of lung cancer and leukemic cell lines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. However, the detailed antitumor mechanism of Ubenimex remains unclear.</p><p>In the current study, to improve the therapeutic efficacy of radiotherapy for cervical cancer, we investigated the potential of Ubenimex to act as a radiosensitizer. Initially, <italic>in vitro </italic>studies showed that Ubenimex potentiated radiation-induced cell killing in a clonogenic assay. This increased cell killing was correlated with the up-regulation of caspase-3 and PARP cleavage, suggesting the activation of apoptotic signaling pathways.<italic>In vivo</italic>, the combination of Ubenimex with cervical cancer irradiation led to an enhancement of tumor growth inhibition and increased cancer tissue apoptosis. Our study demonstrated the potential for the use of Ubenimex to improve the effectiveness of clinical strategies in cervical cancer radiotherapy.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Cell culture</title><p>The human uterine cervical cancer cell line (HeLa) was used.

After incubating 4 &#x000d7; 10<sup>5 </sup>cells in a 60 &#x000d7; 15 mm culture dish for 24 h at 37&#x000b0;C, each dish was irradiated with doses of 16 Gy. Twelve hours following, aspirating off the medium and washing with PBS, 1 mM alanine-p-nitroanilido (Peptide Institute, Inc.) was added to each dish as a substrate. Each dish was then incubated at 37&#x000b0;C for 60 min. The supernatant was subsequently collected, and 200 &#x003bc;l of the solution was added to 96-well microtiter plates. APN/CD13 enzyme activity was measured by a microplate reader (Tecan; &#x003bb;<sub>exc </sub>of 405 nm and &#x003bb;<sub>em </sub>495 nm) (Labsystems, Multiskan Bichromatic, Helsinki, Finland).</p></sec><sec><title>Clonogenic survival</title><p>For colony formation assays, cells (from 100 to 1 &#x000d7; 10<sup>5 </sup>cells) in a 60 &#x000d7; 15 mm culture dish were seeded in triplicate according to treatment conditions and cell lines. After allowing cells to attach to the dishes, a single dose of radiation and/or Ubenimex was given. Cells were always pretreated with Ubenimex for 24 h before radiation when the two treatments were combined. Cells were cultured for up to 14 days.

The combined antitumor activity of radiation and Ubenimex was tested both <italic>in vitro </italic>and <italic>in vivo</italic>. In our animal model, treatment with Ubenimex alone did not influence tumor growth in nude mice inoculated s.c. with HeLa cells. However, combined treatment with Ubenimex and radiation resulted in a significantly higher response rate compared with radiation alone. These results are consistent with <italic>in vitro </italic>data shown in Figs. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>. In this study, the combined treatment was markedly effective in vivo, but not in vitro. This is presumably because we used relatively large numbers of cells in in-vitro assays. In addition, our apoptosis assay results include those of assays for late apoptosis and necrosis, and so further studies using low-dose radiation are needed. The mechanism by which APN/CD13 activity functions in the regulation of radiosensitivity remains to be clarified. APN/CD13 has been suggested to be involved in the degradation of neuropeptides, cytokines, and immunomodulatory peptides, as well as angiotensins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. Thus, it is possible that APN/CD13 activity may contribute to radioresistance through proteolytically modifying peptides involved in anti-apoptotic signaling. Ubenimex inhibits APN/CD13, aminopeptidase B, and leucine aminopeptidase of mammalian cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. An antigrowth or antimigratory effect is frequently observed in studies using Ubenimex or anticatalytic antibodies for APN/CD13 in several malignancies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. Our results show that Ubenimex acted as a radiosensitizer to enhance radiation-induced apoptosis in cervical cancer cells. This finding suggests that the concomitant use of Ubenimex during radiotherapy could be a potential therapeutic approach to improve the efficacy of radiotherapy for uterine cervical cancer.</p><p>The mechanism involved in the combined treatment of Ubenimex and radiation remains unknown; the two agents achieve cytotoxicity through different means. Previous studies have shown that Ubenimex directly induces the apoptosis of human leukemia and non-small-lung cancer cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. Furthermore, previous studies have shown that Ubenimex enhances apoptosis or increases sensitivity to antineoplastic agents [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. Consistent with these findings, the present data suggested that Ubenimex enhanced the radiosensitivity of cervical cancer. In this study, we speculated that Ubenimex would induce apoptosis by inhibiting the radiation-induced activity of APN/CD13. However, no significant apoptosis induction was observed after the expression of APN/CD13 was knocked out by siRNA (data not shown). One of possible explanation for this observation is that Ubenimex may inhibit other aminopeptidase activities, and thereby influence the cell cycle or apoptotic signals, since it is not completely specific for APN/CD13. Santos et al. demonstrated that APN/CD13 was directly involved in signal transduction pathways, including the phosphorylation of mitogen-activated protein kinases, such as ERK1/2, JNK, and p38, in monocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. Although the detailed mechanisms are still under investigation, APN/CD13 may be involved in signaling cascades regulating cell survival, protection from apoptosis, and radiosensitivity via aminopeptidase-dependent and independent mechanisms.</p><p>This study may be controversial in that 50 times the clinical dose of Ubenimex was administered. Ubenimex is an immunomodulator with few side effects, but may cause mild nausea, vomiting, and liver dysfunction. In addition, further studies are needed to investigate the methods of Ubenimex administration. In conclusion, the data obtained here suggested that APN/CD13 activity was induced with radiation, and the inhibition of APN/CD13 may lead to the restoration of radiosensitivity in cervical cancer cells. Although there are always limitations when one attempts to extrapolate from mice to humans, our study suggests that combination with ubenimex may provide additional benefits regarding the radiosensitivity of cervical cancer.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>This work demonstrated that inhibition of APN/CD13 activity may represent a new approach for improving the therapeutic efficacy of radiotherapy for uterine cervical cancer.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The author(s) declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>HT participated in study design, performed cell culture, enzyme activity assay, colony formation assays, and flow cytometry analysis.
