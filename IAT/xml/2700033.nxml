Here we addressed the pathophysiological effect that one MCR, MCR type 3 (MC3R), might have on vascular inflammation. After occlusion (35 min) and reopening of the superior mesenteric artery, MC3R-null mice displayed a higher degree of plasma extravasation (45 min postreperfusion) and cell adhesion and emigration (90 min postreperfusion). These cellular alterations were complemented by higher expression of mesenteric tissue CCL2 and CXCL1 (mRNA and protein) and myeloperoxydase, as compared with wild-type animals. MC1R and MC3R mRNA and protein were both expressed in the inflamed mesenteric tissue; however, no changes in vascular responses were observed in a mouse colony bearing an inactive MC1R. Pharmacological treatment of animals with a selective MC3R agonist (&#x0005b;<sc>d</sc>-Trp<sup>8</sup>&#x0005d;-&#x003b3;-melanocyte-stimulating hormone; 10 &#x003bc;g i.v.) produced marked attenuation of cell adhesion, emigration, and chemokine generation; such effects were absent in MC3R-null mice. These new data reveal the existence of a tonic inhibitory signal provided by MC3R in the mesenteric microcirculation of the mouse, acting to down-regulate cell trafficking and local mediator generation.&#x02014;Leoni, G., Patel, H.

It is therefore imperative that this response occurs promptly; it is equally very important that the trafficking of white blood cells out of the blood circulation is tightly regulated in both a spatial and temporal manner. The latter aspect is becoming an accepted view in the scientific community in parallel to the appreciation that several endogenous mediators could become operative in the microcirculation to produce an inhibitory effect on the process of leukocyte trafficking <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">(2)</xref>.</p><p>Classes of proinflammatory mediators and chemoattractants act in concert with endogenous inhibitory mediators to assure the strict time dependence of the inflammatory reaction. Whereas the first group comprises the widely known cytokine interleukin (IL) -1, IL-8, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF) -&#x003b1; (to quote just a few) and adhesion molecules as well as proteolytic enzymes, the effectors of the latter group of mediators have been discovered in more recent years <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">(3</xref><xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">, 4)</xref>. The portfolio of endogenous inhibitors of inflammation, which often possess proresolving properties, include short-lived lipids such as lipoxins, resolvins, and cyclopentanone prostaglandins; purine bases such as adenosine and peptides; and proteins, such as IL-10, galectin-1, and annexin-1 <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">(5</xref><xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7)</xref>.</p><p>It is likely that activation of the pathways centered on these counter-regulatory circuits is more swift and crucial in the context of an ischemia and reperfusion (I/R) injury, often referred to as &#x0201c;inflammation from within&#x0201d; <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">(8)</xref>. Indeed, effectors of the endogenous anti-inflammatory arm are particularly active in controlling cell trafficking and the ensuing tissue damage when tested in experimental models of I/R: for instance, administration to mice of annexin-1 and its peptides abrogates cell adhesion in the mesenteric microcirculation after I/R, whereas their inhibition would reach the 40&#x02013;50% value when tested against classical inflammatory stimuli such as the Toll-like receptor-2 (TLR2) agonist zymosan <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">(9</xref><xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">, 10)</xref>.</p><p>ACTH and &#x003b1;-melanocyte-stimulating hormone (MSH) belong to the group of endogenous mediators of anti-inflammation, with several studies reporting, on the one hand, their expression in the context of tissue injury and inflammation and, on the other hand, their ability in suppressing cardinal signs of the inflammatory response of the host.

Activation of each of the five cloned melanocortin receptors will lead to cellular accumulation of cyclic-adenosime monophosphate <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">(19)</xref>; by activating protein kinase A and possibly also in an independent fashion, downstream events activated by melanocortin peptides through their receptors involve inhibition of NF-kB activation <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">(23</xref><xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">, 24)</xref>, leading to an inhibition of cytokine synthesis and release and delayed up-regulation of heme oxygenase-1 <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">(25)</xref> and IL-10 <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">(26)</xref>. More recent studies <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">(27)</xref>, using unbiased screening, have revealed profiles of gene expression on application of tissue-protective and anti-inflammatory melanocortin peptides. In all cases, these experimental pharmacological investigations have not addressed the specific functions that each receptor might play in a given model of pathophysiology.</p><p>In the present study, we focused our attention on the impact that the endogenous circuit centered on either MC1R or MC3R might have in the context of vascular inflammation associated with I/R.

Mesenteric ischemia was induced with a microaneurysm clip (Harvard Apparatus, Kent, UK), clamping the superior mesenteric artery for 35 min.

Sham-operated tissue gene levels of either chemokine remained similar between WT and sham MC3R-null mice; in contrast, I/R injured tissue from MC3R-null mice had an &#x0223c;19- and 16-fold increase in KC and MCP-1 gene expression, respectively, over WT I/R tissues (data not shown; <italic>n</italic>&#x0003d;6; <italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.05).</p></sec><sec><title>Systemic responses in WT and MC3-null mice: soluble mediators</title><p>A selection of analyses was conducted in the plasma of these mice.

The absence of this receptor is associated with an exacerbated inflammatory reaction of the microvasculature, characterized by distinct and selected increments in the extent of leukocyte adhesion emigration and local generation of proinflammatory mediators. Treatment of WT mice with a selected agonist to MC3R produced remarkable inhibitory effects on intravascular cellular reactivity and markers of inflammation. Collectively, these data highlight the pathophysiological role of an endogenous inhibitory circuit centered on this specific receptor during vascular inflammation.</p><p>In the past two decades, a large number of studies <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">(11</xref><xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">, 12</xref><xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">, 15</xref><xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">, 27</xref><xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">, 37</xref><xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref><xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39)</xref> have reported the efficacy of melanocortin peptides (the natural agonists ACTH or &#x003b1;-MSH, or their synthetic derivatives) in several models of acute and chronic inflammation, spanning from tissues and organs as diverse as the liver, kidney, lung, and joint. However, this wealth of data begs two major questions, by and large still unanswered: <italic>1)</italic> what is the main receptor target responsible for these protective effects and <italic>2)</italic> what is the pathophysiological rather pharmacological effect of these peptides in experimental and possibly also human inflammation.</p><p>The first question has been partly addressed by us and others, such that of the five receptors cloned so far for melanocortin peptides <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">(19)</xref>, two subtypes, MC1R and MC3R, seem to play a central role in transducing the pharmacological properties of these agents. The model that emerged from our own work indicates the existence of MC3R in the tissue resident macrophage; its activation by exogenously administered agonists would down-regulate macrophage activation, such as to obtain, on the one hand, inhibition of the production of proinflammatory mediators and, on the other hand, induction of proresolving and tissue protective proteins <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">(16</xref><xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">, 25</xref><xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">, 26)</xref>. Other studies have highlighted a role for MC1R, specifically in the skin compartment, whereas again activation of this receptor would lead to inhibition of cytokine and chemokine processing, thereby producing a net inhibitory effect on the induction of the inflammatory reaction <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">(37</xref><xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">, 40)</xref>. It was important that we could detect mRNA for both receptors in the mesenteric tissue, even in the absence of injury.</p><p>With respect to pathophysiological relevance of these receptors and the circuits that ligand-receptor pairs might produce, a great help to elucidate functions derives from the use of mice nullified for specific receptor subtypes. A natural MC1R mutant (the recessive yellow e/e mouse; ref. <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>) was described a few years ago, but, so far, it has been scarcely investigated in the context of inflammation. Using these mice, we were able to demonstrate a redundant role for MC1R in the context of peritoneal inflammation elicited by urate crystals <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">(41)</xref>. More recent studies <xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">(42)</xref> performed with a chronic model of inflammation (7-day colitis) demonstrated a proinflammatory phenotype in the recessive yellow e/e mouse, indicating that at least in these experimental conditions activation of MC1R would elicit anti-inflammatory signals with a major outcome on the inflammatory phenotypes of the mouse.</p><p>MC3R-null mice were generated quite a few years ago <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">(28)</xref> and so far have been predominantly studied in the context of energy metabolism, whereby subtle differences in adipocyte functions have been reported <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">(28)</xref>. Using this colony, we have been able to validate the central role that MC3R possesses in bringing about the anti-inflammatory actions of melanocortin peptides in crystal-induced inflammation <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">(32)</xref>. Here we used this mouse colony to investigate potential changes in the vascular inflammatory response activated by an I/R protocol. This protocol was chosen because it was previously validated and found to be sensitive to the action of other endogenous effectors of endogenous anti-inflammation, such as annexin-1 and lipoxin A<sub>4</sub><xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">(30)</xref>.</p><p>Gene deficiency in MC3R produced remarkable augmentation of the cellular responses in the mesenteric microcirculation after I/R; this was particularly consistent at the 90 min time point as shown here and as evident at other time points as well (we have tested up to 4 h postreperfusion; unpublished results). Therefore, activation of MC3R is essential to exert a tonic inhibitory action during the inflammatory response that occurs in this experimental model. Such an inflammatory profile is more likely to be consequent to augmented local inflammatory signals and processes, as we could not detect increases in markers of white blood cell activation. Indeed, whereas no changes of CD11b and CD62L expression could be measured in circulating PMN, a lower degree of expression was measured in circulating F4/80<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> cells selectively after I/R. Therefore, such a reduction would not underlie the observed higher extent of cell adhesion and emigration (with no modification of cell rolling) detected in mesenteric postcapillary venules.</p><p>However, what would be the source of MC3R agonists? Both ACTH and &#x003b1;-MSH could reach the inflamed mesentery as part of the plasma protein externalization response that is observed in this model; as expected, this response was optimal at earlier time points compared with the cellular response (45 min <italic>vs.</italic> &#x02265;60 min). However, we cannot exclude the local generation of melanocortin peptides by mast cells <xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">(43)</xref>, macrophages <xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">(44)</xref>, or other tissue-dwelling cells. This hypothesis would require new experiments that would form the basis of future studies; in any case, the expression of both MC3R and MC1R mRNA (although at a low level, as positivity by quantitative PCR was not confirmed by the less sensitive RT-PCR method) in the mesentery favors the possible existence of local counter-regulatory circuits that could be rapidly activated after an I/R event. This time-dependent activation hypothesis is plausible, since migrated neutrophils and mononuclear cells seemed positive for both MC1R and MC3R, instead of stromal and other cells resident in the mesenteric microvascular bed.</p><p>These data obtained with markers of inflammation deserve full analysis. Within this scenario of induction and maintenance of the vascular inflammatory response after I/R, pluri-potent cytokines seem to sustain the systemic (and possibly second-organ injury) response, whereas chemokines might regulate white blood cell trafficking and activation in the affected tissue. Such a dichotomy of properties may justify the partially surprising effects we have observed, although we cannot exclude that kinetic assessment over time might have yielded different results. What is more relevant for the present study, though, is that gene deficiency in MC3R did not affect the systemic response to any large extent, the only exception possibly being the generation of nitrate/nitrite. In contrast, potent regulation of mesenteric MCP-1 (CCL2) and KC (CXCL1) levels by the MC3R pathway was observed, with augmented protein and mRNA expression. Such results are in line with the pharmacological properties of melanocortin receptor agonists that inhibit generation of cytokines and chemokines in inflamed tissues or from activated cells, including KC from macrophages <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">(21</xref><xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">, 22</xref><xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">, 39</xref><xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">, 45)</xref>. In our experimental conditions, we could not detected mesenteric expression of IL-1&#x003b2;, TNF, or IL-6.</p><p>The novel findings that we report are in apparent contrast to a recent study that reported a reduced inflammatory reaction in MC3R-null mice <xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">(46)</xref>. The transgenic mouse colony used <xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">(47)</xref> is different from the one we used here; in any case, we do not have a clear explanation for this discrepancy; the large majority of publications in the field indicate, in a clear manner, the inhibitory role that melanocortin peptides and their receptors play in inflammation <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">(15)</xref>; it is possible that the high-fat diet might have somehow subverted the pathophysiological properties of this receptor.</p><p>It is worth noting that the application of our experimental protocols to recessive yellow e/e mice did not produce cellular responses different from those observed in WT animals; on the same vein, no differences in local and systemic mediator generation were observed between the animals bearing an inactive MC1R mutant and WT mice. Such a lack of involvement is striking when compared with the major alterations observed and quantified in the microcirculation of MC3R-null mice.</p><p>There were also indications that the microvasculature of MC3R animals might be more prone to reactivity even when very mild stimuli are applied, such as observed in sham animals, although it rarely reached statistical significance. Such a mild hyper-reactivity was unlikely due to inherent alterations in white blood cell phenotype, as we did not detect different basal expression of PMN or monocyte markers in WT and MC3R-null circulating cells. The fact that higher markers and readouts of inflammation were often detected in sham-operated MC3R-null mice was also a constant feature of the present study. Together with more pronounced differences seen after I/R and discussed above, we wish to propose that MC3R is pivotal to an inhibitory circuit that possesses physiological as well as pathological inhibitory roles within the mesenteric microcirculation.</p><p>In the final part of the study, we determined the potentially inhibitory actions of a selective MC3R agonist (&#x0005b;<sc>d</sc>-Trp<sup>8</sup>&#x0005d;-&#x003b3;-MSH; ref. <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>). We <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">(32)</xref> recently reported that this compound produces anti-inflammatory activities in models of peritonitis as well joint inflammation, and these actions are due to MC3R activation, since absent in mice nullified for this receptor. In addition, and in line with its receptor binding profile <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">(31)</xref>, &#x0005b;<sc>d</sc>-Trp<sup>8</sup>&#x0005d;-&#x003b3;-MSH fully retained its pharmacological properties in the animals bearing the MC1R mutant <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">(33)</xref>. Here we have assessed the role of this compound on leukocyte interaction with inflamed postcapillary venules. Treatment of mice with &#x0005b;<sc>d</sc>-Trp<sup>8</sup>&#x0005d;-&#x003b3;-MSH produced remarkable inhibition, between 50&#x02013;70% of both cell adhesion and cell emigration, whereas it did not affect the responses observed in MC3R-null mice. In line with the data produced by comparing inflammatory responses in MC3R-null <italic>vs.</italic> WT mice, administration of the MC3R selective agonist to the latter mouse strain did inhibit also chemokine generation in the mesenteric tissue. This effect complements the reported inhibition on KC and IL-1&#x003b2; released into the supernatant of cultured mouse peritoneal macrophages or detected in inflammatory exudates <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">(32)</xref>. Together with the studies <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">(11</xref><xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">, 12</xref><xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">, 38</xref><xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">, 45)</xref> by other groups where the protective actions of cellular melanocortins on I/R injury of the heart, kidneys, and other organs have been observed, our new data indicate that &#x0005b;<sc>d</sc>-Trp<sup>8</sup>&#x0005d;-&#x003b3;-MSH or other selective MC3R agonists would be suitable for development as novel therapeutics to control I/R pathological conditions.</p><p>In summary, we have taken advantage of a mouse colony nullified for MC3R to reveal novel and crucial properties for this receptor in controlling the vascular reactivity of the mesenteric microcirculation, observing tonic inhibitory properties on the white blood cell trafficking process as well local generation of inflammatory mediators. The pathophysiological relevance that we reveal here for MC3R might bear therapeutic implications, since a selective agonist at this receptor produced remarkable inhibitory effects in WT mice subjected to the I/R reperfusion procedure. In fact, irrespective of whether MC1R or MC3R is the major receptor target responsible for bringing about the anti-inflammatory properties of melanocortin peptides (it is plausible that tissue and/or species specificity might exist), it is clear that studying the biology of melanocortin peptides and their receptor might help in the design and development of new anti-inflammatory therapeutics.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>This study was funded by the British Heart Foundation (studentship FS/05/078/19406).
