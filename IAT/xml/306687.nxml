Pulsed field gel electrophoresis of DNA from irradiated cells indicates that the rad32 mutant, in comparison to wild type cells, has decreased ability to repair DNA double strand breaks. The mutant also undergoes decreased meiotic recombination and displays reduced stability of minichromosomes. The rad32 gene has been cloned by complementation of the UV sensitive phenotype. The gene, which is not essential for cell viability and is expressed at a moderate level in mitotically dividing cells, has significant homology to the meiotic recombination gene MRE11 of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Epistasis analysis indicates that rad32 functions in a pathway which includes the rhp51 gene (the S.pombe homologue to S.cerevisiae RAD51) and that cells deleted for the rad32 gene in conjunction with either the rad3 deletion (a G2 checkpoint mutation) or the rad2 deletion (a chromosome stability and potential nucleotide excision repair mutation) are not viable.</p><sec><title>Images</title><fig id="F1"><graphic xlink:href="nar00003-0086-a" xlink:role="386"/></fig><fig id="F2"><graphic xlink:href="nar00003-0087-a" xlink:role="387"/></fig></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><supplementary-material content-type="scanned-pages"><graphic xlink:href="nar00003-0083.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="383"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00003-0084.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="384"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00003-0085.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="385"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00003-0086.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="386"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00003-0087.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="387"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00003-0088.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="388"/></supplementary-material></body></article>
