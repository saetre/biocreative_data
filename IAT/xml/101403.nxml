The proposed functions of this family are to eliminate potentially toxic nucleotide metabolites from the cell and to regulate the concentrations of nucleotide cofactors and signalling molecules for optimal cell growth and survival.</p><p>The number of genes encoding Nudix hydrolases varies widely, from zero in <italic>Mycoplasma genitalium</italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>] to 22 in <italic>Deinococcus radiodurans</italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. This variation presumably reflects the growth or environmental adaptability, stress tolerance and metabolic capacity of the different organisms. The Nudix hydrolases thus offer an ideal system with which to study the evolution of a largely inessential protein family and its contribution to the individual biology of an organism. Understanding such variation requires a combination of detailed biochemical, genetic and cellular studies to reveal the individual functions of family members within the set in any given system. In the case of multicellular eukaryotes, the nematode <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> offers a genetically amenable model system with which to carry out such studies. There are 11 members of the Nudix hydrolase family in <italic>C. elegans</italic>. So far only two of these have been characterized &#x02013; a diadenosine tetraphosphate pyrophosphohydrolase (the orthologue of human NUDT2) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>] and an NADH diphosphatase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. Sequence comparisons would predict the existence of an ADP-sugar diphosphatase (NUDT5 orthologue) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>], an ADP-ribose diphosphatase (NUDT9 orthologue) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>], a diphosphoinositol polyphosphate pyrophosphohydrolase (NUDT3/4 orthologue) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>], two probable coenzyme A diphosphatases, one of which is highly similar to the mouse Nudt7 CoA diphosphatase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>], and 4 proteins of unknown function, including one with a strong similarity to the <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> PSU1/DCP2 protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>] and another similar to the developmentally-regulated mouse RP2 protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>].</p><p>Recent characterization of the <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> NADH and CoA diphosphatases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>] and the mouse Nudt7 CoA diphosphatase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>] has revealed that they are located in peroxisomes. The function of these peroxisomal enzymes may be to regulate the concentration of these essential nucleotide cofactors for peroxisomal metabolism or, by analogy with the <italic>E. coli</italic> MutT 8-oxo-dGTPase, to eliminate toxic modified cofactor metabolites from the highly oxidizing peroxisomal environment. In order to investigate these possibilities in the <italic>C. elegans</italic> model system, we have cloned and characterised the putative <italic>C. elegans</italic> Y87G2A.14 CoA diphosphatase and shown that it displays the expected enzymatic activities and that it appears to be targetted to peroxisomes by a C-terminal PTS1 targeting signal.</p></sec><sec><title>Results and discussion</title><sec><title>Cloning, expression and purification of Y87G2A.14</title><p>The <italic>C. elegans</italic> Y87G2A.14 gene encodes a 234 amino acid protein with an expected molecular weight of 26,601 Da.

The PCR fragment was inserted into the pET-32b(+) expression vector and the nucleotide sequence of the insert was determined to be exactly the same as that submitted to GenBank under accession no.

The recombinant plasmid pETY87G2A.14 was then used to transform <italic>E. coli</italic> BL21 (DE3) cells to generate a His-tagged thioredoxin fusion protein with an expected molecular mass of 43,731 Da. When the Trx-Y87G2A.14 fusion protein was expressed at 37&#x000b0;C, it was confined to inclusion bodies, so the induction temperature was decreased to 25&#x000b0;C to enhance protein solubility. As the expression level was low at this temperature, the induction time was increased to 8 h. These conditions markedly increased the solubility of Trx-Y87G2A.14 which was then purified from the soluble fraction (Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>, lane 2) to apparent homogeneity on NiCAM&#x02122;-HC resin (Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>, lane 3). To determine the molecular weight of the Y87G2A.14 protein itself, the Trx-Y87G2A.14 fusion was cleaved with thrombin, which generated Y87G2A.14 with an apparent molecular weight of 27 kDa (expected molecular weight, 29,807 Da) and thioredoxin (15 kDa, Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>, lane 4).</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Purification and cleavage of Trx-Y87G2A.14 fusion protein.</bold> Samples were analysed by SDS-PAGE (15% polyacrylamide) and stained with Coomassie Brilliant blue R 250.

HPLC analysis of CoA hydrolysis by Trx-Y87G2A.14 showed that the enzyme was a CoA diphosphatase, cleaving the diphosphate linkage in CoA to yield adenosine 3',5'-bisphosphate (3',5'-ADP) and 4'-phosphopantetheine (Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="F2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p><bold>Identification of reaction products of CoA hydrolysis.</bold> Reaction mixtures containing 0.5 mM CoA were incubated at 37&#x000b0;C for 20 min with or without 0.1 &#x003bc;g Trx-Y87G2A.14 fusion protein and the products separated by HPLC as described in Materials and methods.

This conforms to the pattern typical of PTS1 peroxisomal targeting signals found in many peroxisomal matrix proteins, suggesting that Y87G2A.14 may be targeted to these organelles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. However, possession of a potential PTS1 sequence is not always sufficient on its own to result in peroxisomal targeting and other elements of the protein sequence may also be involved. Since targeting of animal peroxisomal proteins expressed in yeast has often been observed, yeast cells were transformed with expression plasmids encoding C-terminal or N-terminal fusions of Y87G2A.14 to yeast-enhanced green fluorescent protein (yEGFP) in order to determine the subcellular location of Y87G2A.14. The cells were then examined by confocal microscopy. Cells transformed with pY87G2A.14-yEGFP, in which the C-terminus of Y87G2A.14 is fused to the N-terminus of yEGFP, showed a diffuse, cytoplasmic fluorescence with no clear subcellular localization (Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4a</xref>). In contrast, cells transformed with pyEGFP-Y87G2A.14, in which the C-terminal tripeptide SKI is free to act as a targeting signal showed the clear punctate fluorescence that is indicative of yeast peroxisomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>] (Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4b</xref>). The identity of SKI as the targeting signal was confirmed by transformation of cells with pyEGFP-Y87G2A.14&#x00394; SKI, in which the C-terminal tripeptide was deleted during construction. This again showed a diffuse, cytoplasmic, fluorescence (Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4c</xref>). Together, these results strongly suggest that Y87G2A.14 is targeted to peroxisomes by its C-terminal tripeptide, SKI.</p><fig position="float" id="F4"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><p><bold>Subcellular localization of Y87G2A.14 by fluorescence confocal microscopy.</bold> yEGFP fluorescence of yeast cells transformed with (a) pY87G2A.14-yEGFP; (b) pyEGFP-Y87G2A.14 and (c) pyEGF-Y87G2A.14&#x00394;SKI</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1471-2091-3-5-4"/></fig></sec></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>On the basis of its sequence, the <italic>C. elegans</italic> Y87G2A.14 gene product was predicted to be a peroxisomal coenzyme A diphosphatase. In addition to the Nudix motif, Y87G2A.14 possesses the PROSITE UPF0035 motif (Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>), which we have previously suggested confers a specificity for coenzyme A and its derivatives [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>], and a C-terminal tripeptide, SKI, that conforms to the pattern typical of PTS1 peroxisomal targeting signals. The experiments described here confirm these predictions. Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref> shows a multiple sequence alignment of the motif-containing region of Y87G2A.14 with related sequences from other organisms. Those marked with a tick have been experimentally shown to be coenzyme A diphosphatases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. In most cases, higher organisms possess two related sequences, e.g. mouse Nudt7 and Nudt8, one of which encodes a peroxisomal enzyme (e.g. Nudt7). However, <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> has only one sequence containing the UPF0035 motif while <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> has three, and the second of the two <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> sequences, RH61317, is currently only represented in GenBank by a single expressed sequence tag, so its status is still questionable. For the peroxisomal enzymes, either a putative C-terminal PTS1 or an N-terminal PTS2 targeting signal is present. Interestingly, in each case, the putative PTS2 signal is contained within or near a predicted mitochondrial targeting or chloroplast transit peptide sequence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>], suggesting a possible dual location for these proteins. Such a possibility has not yet been experimentally observed; however, mutation of a glutamate five residues to the C-terminal side of the PTS2 of rat peroxisomal 3-ketoacyl-CoA thiolase to a neutral or basic amino acid has been shown to result in partial mitochondrial targeting, suggesting that the negative charge on glutamate may normally block translocation to the mitochondria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. Whether or not a system exists <italic>in vivo</italic> to regulate dual targeting is clearly a topic requiring further investigation. The non-peroxisomal sequences provide no clear indication of possible subcellular location, hence they are likely to be cytoplasmic. Given the existence of mitochondrial, peroxisomal and cytoplasmic pools of CoA and CoA esters [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>], it would not be surprising to find CoA diphosphatase activity in all these locations. However, the precise substrate specificities of the "cytoplasmic" activities remain to be determined.</p><fig position="float" id="F5"><label>Figure 5</label><caption><p><bold>Partial sequence alignment of Y87G2A.14 and related sequences.</bold> The partial sequence of Y87G2A.14 containing the UPF0035 and Nudix motifs (arrowed) was aligned using the Clustal W program with related sequences from other organisms retrieved from a BLAST search.

This would indicate that, within the limitations of RNAi, the CoA diphosphatase activity of Y87G2A.14 is not essential. However, now that the biochemical properties of this protein have been established, a more detailed and targeted biochemical analysis can be undertaken that should reveal its cellular function and benefit to the organism.</p><p>Nudix hydrolases are believed to regulate the concentrations of nucleotides for optimal cell performance and also to eliminate potentially toxic nucleotide metabolites from the cell. With regard to regulation, CoA diphosphatase activity is associated with the 400 kDa CoA synthesizing protein complex from <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>, in which it forms part of an alternative pathway for CoA biosynthesis that differs from the principal route of 3'-dephospho-CoA and CoA synthesis by this complex [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. This CoA/4'-phosphopantetheine cycle involves hydrolysis of CoA to 3',5'-ADP and 4'-phosphopantetheine, which then reacts with ATP to give 3'-dephospho-CoA then CoA. Whether such a pathway operates in peroxisomes and whether the <italic>C. elegans</italic> Y87G2A.14 protein is involved remain to be established. With regard to the elimination of toxic nucleotide metabolites, the 13-fold higher <italic>k</italic><sub>cat</sub> / <italic>K</italic><sub>m</sub> ratio for oxidized CoA (CoASSCoA) compared to CoA for the <italic>S. cerevisiae PCD1</italic> CoA diphosphatase previously suggested to us that this enzyme might preferentially remove non-functional and potentially toxic oxidized CoA and CoA esters from within the oxidizing environment of the peroxisomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. However, neither the mouse Nudt7 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>] nor the <italic>C. elegans</italic> Y87G2A.14 proteins show this preference. Nevertheless, the potential production of adenine ring-oxidized derivatives of CoA by reactive oxygen species generated in the peroxisomes analogous to the 2-oxo-dATP and 8-oxo-dATP substrates of the mammalian MTH1 Nudix hydrolase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>] suggests that such species could be more relevant substrates for peroxisomal CoA diphosphatases <italic>in vivo</italic>.

A single colony was picked from an LB agar plate containing 50 &#x003bc;g/ml ampicillin and inoculated into 10 ml LB medium containing 50 &#x003bc;g/ml ampicillin and incubated at 37&#x000b0;C. When the cells reached an A<sub>600</sub> of 0.5, they were transferred to 1 litre of fresh LB medium containing 50 &#x003bc;g/ml ampicillin and grown to an A<sub>600</sub> of 0.3 at 37&#x000b0;C, then transferred to an incubator at 25&#x000b0;C. Isopropyl-1-thio-&#x003b2;-D-galactopyranoside (IPTG) was added to 1 mM at an A<sub>600</sub> of 0.8, and the cells induced for 8 h. The induced cells (4 g) were harvested, washed and resuspended in 20 ml breakage buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 50 mM NaCl, 1 mM DTT). The cell suspension was sonicated and the cell lysate was then cleared by centrifugation at 10,000 &#x000d7; <italic>g</italic> at 4&#x000b0;C for 15 min. The supernatant was applied to a 15 &#x000d7; 50 mm column of NiCAM&#x02122;-HC resin (Sigma) equilibrated with 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.5 M NaCl, 1 mM 2-mercaptoethanol at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. After eluting the unbound proteins, a linear gradient of 0&#x02013;40 mM histidine in the same equilibration buffer was applied at flow rate of 1 ml/min and 1 ml fractions collected and analysed by SDS-PAGE. Those containing pure Trx-Y87G2A.14 fusion protein were collected, dialysed overnight at 4&#x000b0;C against 1 litre of 20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 50 mM NaCl, ImM DTT and then concentrated by ultraflltration (Amicon) and stored at -20&#x000b0;C in 50% glycerol.</p></sec><sec><title>Enzyme assays</title><p>Potential substrates were screened by measuring the Pi released after nucleotide hydrolysis in presence of inorganic pyrophosphatase or alkaline phosphatase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>].
