Aim: to determine if factors mediating proposed mechanisms for severe bronchiolitis differ with severity of disease.</p></sec><sec><title>Methodology/Principle Findings</title><p>197 infants admitted to hospital with hRSV bronchiolitis were recruited and grouped according to no oxygen requirement (n&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;27), oxygen dependence (n&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;114) or mechanical ventilation (n&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;56). We collected clinical data, nasopharyngeal aspirate (NPA) and if ventilated bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL). Interferon-gamma (IFN-&#x003b3;), substance P (SP), interleukin 9 (IL-9), urea and hRSV load, were measured in cell free supernatant from NPA and BAL. Multivariate analysis compared independent effects of clinical, virological and immunological variables upon disease severity. IFN-&#x003b3; and SP concentrations were lower in NPA from infants who required oxygen or mechanical ventilation. Viral load and IL-9 concentrations were high but did not vary with severity of disease. Independent predictors of severe disease (in diminishing size of effect) were low weight on admission, low gestation at birth, low NPA IFN-&#x003b3; and NPA SP. Nasal airway sampling appears to be a useful surrogate for distal airway sampling since concentrations of IFN-&#x003b3;, SP, IL-9 and viral load in NPA correlate with the same in BAL.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>Our data support two proposed mechanisms for severe hRSV disease; reduced local IFN-&#x003b3; response and SP mediated inflammation. We found large amounts of hRSV and IL-9 in airways secretions from the upper and lower respiratory tract but could not associate these with disease severity.</p></sec></abstract><counts><page-count count="8"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Human respiratory syncytial virus (hRSV) infection is ubiquitous in infancy and it is the single most important cause of severe lower respiratory tract infection in young children throughout the world.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001038-Excler1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref> Severe disease (bronchiolitis or bronchiolitis pneumonia) results in the hospital admission of approximately 2.5&#x00025; of all infants in industrialised countries making this virus the most common cause for admission in the first year of life.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001038-Leader1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref> In developing countries the morbidity and mortality associated with hRSV infection is far greater.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001038-Wright1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref> Approximately 50&#x00025; of infants admitted to hospital with bronchiolitis suffer from recurrent wheeze in later childhood.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001038-Stein1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001038-Bont1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref> It is unknown whether the mechanism(s) associating severe bronchiolitis with recurrent wheeze are a consequence of hRSV infection or due to an inherent susceptibilities to both conditions.</p><p>The histopathology of severe bronchiolitis is small airway obstruction due to viral-cytopathic epithelial disruption and destruction, parenchymal inflammatory-cell infiltration, luminal neutrophil migration and increased mucous production.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001038-McNamara1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001038-Johnson1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref> Mechanisms recently proposed to explain severe bronchiolitis include reduced antiviral immunity (reduced IFN-&#x003b3; production), increased viral replication, excessive &#x0201c;neurogenic inflammation&#x0201d; and elevated IL-9-induced secretion of mucous.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001038-King1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001038-DeVincenzo1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref> These mechanisms are based upon experimental studies in animals and observational studies in well defined but relatively small groups of human infants.</p><p>In this large pragmatic clinical observational study, each mechanism in this pathogenic pathway was tested by measuring representative factors (IFN-&#x003b3;, viral load, Substance P and IL-9) in the respiratory secretions collected from infants admitted to hospital.</p><p>Our hypothesis is &#x0201c;where variation in a pathogenic mechanism is associated with severe disease, representative factors (cytokines and viral load) will vary with disease severity&#x0201d;.</p><p>We studied the interactions and independent effects of these factors upon disease severity by univariate and multivariate analysis in previously well infants.
