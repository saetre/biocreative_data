This last event, invasion, is now also thought to underlie recurrent UTI. Although members of the highly-expressed &#x0201c;uroplakin&#x0201d; proteins serve as bladder receptors for UPEC binding, it was unclear how UPEC binding to uroplakin receptors caused signals within bladder cells that mediate rapid cell death and bacterial invasion. Here, we show that another uroplakin, uroplakin III, which is associated with the receptor transduces signals within the cell in response to UPEC binding. UPEC causes elevated calcium within bladder cells, and this elevation requires phosphorylation of uroplakin III by a specific kinase. Blocking these events blocks both bladder cell death and bacterial invasion of bladder cells by UPEC. Thus, uroplakin III is the mediator of key events in UTI pathogenesis.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="17"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are the second most common infectious disease in humans, following respiratory tract infections.

These results indicate that PDO7i cells express all four major uroplakin subunits in complexes that are fully capable of interacting with FimH to mediate binding and potential downstream signaling events. The co-localization of FimCH to UPIIIa on the PDO7i cell surface suggests that FimH binding to the uroplakin receptor complex, which contains UPIIIa, could potentially lead to signaling events mediated by the UPIIIa cytoplasmic domain.</p><fig id="ppat-1000415-g001" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.ppat.1000415.g001</object-id><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>Localization of surface-expressed uroplakins on PD07i cells.</title><p>(A) 0.1 ug of bovine (lane 1, 3, 5, 7) and human (lane 2, 4, 6, 8) AUM proteins were resolved on 17&#x00025; SDS-PAGE and transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane, and detected with monospecific rabbit antisera against Ia (lane 1, 2), Ib (lane 3, 4), II (lane 5, 6), and IIIa (lane 7, 8).

In the event of a successful innate response, the urothelial cell undergoes apoptosis and is eliminated in the urine. We postulate that initiation of apoptosis may require a threshold of UPIIIa signaling that varies from cell-to-cell depending on levels of UPIIIa expression or expression of other cellular factors.
