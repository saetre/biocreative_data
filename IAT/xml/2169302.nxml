Although all structural DNA methyltransferase motifs are present in Dnmt2, these enzymes show a strong tRNA methyltransferase activity. In line with an enzymatic activity towards substrates other than DNA, Dnmt2 has been described to localize to the cytoplasm. Using molecular and biochemical approaches we show here that Dnmt2 is both a cytoplasmic and a nuclear protein. Sub-cellular fractionation shows that a significant amount of Dnmt2 is bound to the nuclear matrix. Sub-cellular localization analysis reveals that Dnmt2 proteins are enriched in actively dividing cells. Dnmt2 localization is highly dynamic during the cell cycle. Using live imaging we observed that Dnmt2-EGFP enters prophase nuclei and shows a spindle-like localization pattern during mitotic divisions. Additional experiments suggest that this localization is microtubule dependent and that Dnmt2 can access DNA during mitotic cell divisions. Our results represent the first comprehensive characterization of Dnmt2 proteins on the cellular level and have important implications for our understanding of the molecular activities of Dnmt2.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="10"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>The methylation of cytosine residues plays an important role in the regulation of nucleic acids.

For example, human and mouse Dnmt2 have been shown to be expressed at relatively high levels in the heart, lung, kidney and testis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001414-Yoder1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001414-Okano1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>. In addition, Dnmt2 expression has been shown to be elevated during early developmental stages in <italic>Drosophila</italic> and in zebrafish <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001414-Kunert1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001414-Hung1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001414-Lyko1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>, which suggested a developmental role of the protein. In agreement with this notion, Dnmt2 mutant zebrafish showed defective liver, brain and retina development <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001414-Rai1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>. Understanding the significance of this phenotype, will require further investigation, because Dnmt2 mutant mice, flies and plants (<italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic>) have been described to be viable and fertile <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001414-Goll1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>. The limited understanding of the cellular characteristics of Dnmt2 has so far precluded a detailed analysis of Dnmt2 mutant organisms.</p><p>Because of their annotation as DNA methyltransferases, Dnmt2 enzymes have been expected to be nuclear proteins. However, ectopically expressed human Dnmt2 has been shown to localize in the cytoplasm of transiently transfected cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001414-Goll1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>, which is in contrast to the nuclear localization of established DNA methyltransferases <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001414-Bachman1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>, and has been interpreted to be in agreement with the tRNA methyltransferase activity of the protein <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001414-Goll1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>. However, this observation cannot provide an explanation for the observed DNA methyltransferase activity of Dnmt2. In addition, a Dnmt2 homologue in Dictyostelium has been shown to reside in the nucleus <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001414-Kuhlmann1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref> and a Dnmt2 homologue in <italic>Entamoeba</italic> has been associated with the nuclear matrix <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001414-Banerjee1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>. These observations are difficult to reconcile with the conclusion that Dnmt2 is exclusively cytoplasmic <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001414-Goll1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Because the identification of sub-cellular compartments associated with individual proteins is important for understanding their molecular activities, a systematic analysis of the sub-cellular localization of Dnmt2 should provide valuable information to define the function of these enzymes. In order to characterize Dnmt2 in <italic>Drosophila</italic> in more detail we created specific antibodies to biochemically trace Dnmt2 as well as fusion proteins to EGFP and GAL4:VP16, that allowed us to study the sub-cellular dynamics and localization of Dnmt2. We show that Dnmt2 is also a nuclear protein, which is part of the insoluble nuclear matrix. Dnmt2-EGFP could be predominantly visualized in endo-replicating and dividing nuclei. These findings show that the sub-cellular distribution of Dnmt2 is fundamentally different from that of other DNA or tRNA methyltransferases and provide experimental support for the notion that Dnmt2 enzymes have multiple molecular activities.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Expression of Dnmt2 during Drosophila development</title><p>As an initial step towards the characterization of Dnmt2, we affinity purified antibodies against a peptide epitope encompassing amino acids 78&#x02013;93 of the annotated protein (Mt2-PA, Genebank accession no. AAF53163) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001414-g001">Fig. 1A</xref>). These antibodies recognize Dnmt2 as a 40 kDa protein on Western blots and can efficiently immunoprecipitate Dnmt2 from protein extracts, as confirmed by mass-spectrometry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001414-g001">Fig. 1B</xref> and data not shown). The 40 kDa polypeptide was not recognized in protein extracts from a homozygous Dnmt2 mutant strain <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001414-Goll1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>. The introduction of a genomic Dnmt2 transgene (pGeno-Dnmt2) into the Dnmt2 mutant background via P-element mediated germ line transformation led to the re-expression of the 40 kDa polypeptide (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001414-g001">Fig. 1C</xref>). The available experimental data indicates that Dnmt2 can methylate both DNA and tRNA. This suggests that the protein should be detectable not only in the cytoplasm but also in nuclei. We therefore biochemically fractionated 0&#x02013;6 hours old wildtype embryos to obtain cytoplasmic and nuclear protein extracts and found that the majority of Dnmt2 protein is cytoplasmic. However, purified nuclei contained a significant amount of Dnmt2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001414-g001">Fig. 1D</xref>). Furthermore, testing protein extracts of wildtype animals of various developmental stages we observed that Dnmt2 is expressed throughout development and in adults.

Our affinity purified antibodies against Dnmt2 were not suitable for indirect immunofluoresence experiments, which was most likely due to epitope masking (data not shown). We therefore created several independent transgenic fly lines harbouring a Dnmt2-EGFP fusion gene in the genomic sequence context of the Dnmt2 locus (pGeno-Dnmt2-EGFP). Since Dnmt2 mutant animals are viable and fertile and do not display obvious phenotypes we could not positively test whether the genomic Dnmt2-EGFP contstruct is functional. On the other hand, co-immunoprecipitation experiments using both endogenous Dnmt2 as well as Dnmt2-EGFP constructs revealed that Dnmt2-EGFP is contained in similar protein complexes, suggesting that part of the functionality of Dnmt2 is retained in the fusion protein (unpublished observations). In order to test whether these constructs express tagged Dnmt2 similarly to endogenous Dnmt2 we performed Western blot analysis of protein extracts from various developmental stages and adult tissues using antibodies against Dnmt2.

As a first step, we tested whether Dnmt2 co-fractionates with nucleoli. After disruption of purified nuclei and density fractionation through sucrose cushions we separated nucleoli from the rest of the nuclear structures. Tracing nucleolar material using an antibody against fibrillarin we found that Dnmt2 was not enriched in nucleoli (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001414-g003">Fig. 3B</xref>). Using micrococcal nuclease (MNase) digestion of purified nuclei to release histone-associated chromatin, we observed that nuclear Dnmt2 is not solubilized, suggesting that Dnmt2 is not chromatin-bound. While canonical histones such as histone H3 were released from MNase and EDTA treated nuclei, Dnmt2 remained in the nuclear remnants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001414-g003">Fig. 3C</xref>). To determine whether the nuclear Dnmt2 fraction is associated with the nuclear matrix we salt extracted purified nuclei. For controls we used antibodies against the insulator protein CP-190, which is peripherally associated with the nuclear matrix, as well as antibodies against Lamin C that is an integral part of the nuclear matrix. These experiments showed that most of the nuclear Dnmt2 protein remains insoluble after extraction. In order to analyze nuclear Dnmt2, salt-extracted nuclei had to be treated with 7 M urea to solubilize the protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001414-g003">Fig. 3D</xref>).

During meta- and anaphase Dnmt2-EGFP formed spindle-like structures and re-localized to midbody structures during karyokinesis. During the following S-phase Dnmt2-EGFP was diffusely distributed throughout the syncitial cytoplasm until the start of the next mitotic phase.

We co-stained embryos for Dnmt2-EGFP and tubulin and found that the signals overlap only partially (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001414-g005">Fig. 5B</xref>-left panel). In order to test whether Dnmt2-EGFP localization depends on the presence of intact MTs we treated embryos with colcemide to destabilize MTs. We found that the spindle-like Dnmt2-EGFP localization in mitotic nuclei was lost (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001414-g005">Fig. 5B</xref>-middle panel). Stabilization of MTs using taxol caused a more diffuse localization of Dnmt2-EGFP around mitotic chromosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001414-g005">Fig. 5B</xref>-right panel) but did not trigger the re-localization of Dnmt2-EGFP to ectopic microtubule-rich regions, indicating an indirect interaction between Dnmt2-EGFP and MTs. We concluded that the syncitial pool of Dnmt2-EGFP is dynamically changing from a uniformly cytoplasmic localization during S-phase to a microtubule-dependent spindle-like distribution during pro- and metaphase of mitosis.</p><p>The dynamic localization of Dnmt2 to mitotic chromosomes raised the possibility that Dnmt2 could transiently access DNA during this particular phase of the cell cycle. In order to test whether Dnmt2 is interacting with DNA we used a chimeric transcription factor GAL4:VP16 (GV) fused to Dnmt2. The GAL4-VP16 protein contains the DNA-binding domain of the yeast transcription factor GAL4 linked to the transcriptional activating domain of the viral VP16 protein <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001414-Sadowski1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>. This reporter system has been used previously to characterize the nuclear access of the Notch intracellular domain <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001414-Struhl1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref> and was therefore be adapted to trace the nuclear access of GV-Dnmt2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001414-g006">Fig. 6A, B</xref>). Because overexpression of GAL4-VP16 alone is cytotoxic to cells (G. Struhl, personal communication) we also established a control construct where the GAL4-VP16 domain was embedded in a split Dnmt2 protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001414-g006">Fig. 6B</xref>). The resulting GV-Dnmt2 proteins were ubiquitously expressed in animals also carrying a UAS-EGFP transgene. Expression of GV-Dnmt2 from the polyubiquitin promotor in embryos showed ubiquitously high levels of UAS-EGFP (data not shown). We therefore focused our analysis on larval imaginal disc tissues that develop more slowly and contain cycling and differentiating cells. In the larval brain we observed transactivation of the EGFP reporter in many cells interspersed by cells not displaying EGFP signal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001414-g006">Fig. 6C</xref>). This pattern was reminiscent of the expression pattern of Dnmt2-EGFP expressed from the genomic construct (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001414-g004">Fig. 4D,E</xref>) suggesting that cycling neuroblasts allow access of the transactivator fusion protein to DNA. In order to directly examine the possibility that mitotic cells allow access of Dnmt2 to DNA we analyzed third instar larval eye discs. These tissues undergo a well-characterized differentiation process after a mitotic wave of cell divisions (morphogenetic furrow). Even though both Dnmt2 fusion proteins were expressed ubiquitously across the eye discs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001414-g006">Fig. 6D,E</xref>-GAL4 panel), we observed that GAL4-VP16 access to DNA occured only with the GV-Dnmt2 construct, as evidenced by a strong EGFP expression in the differentiating photoreceptor cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001414-g006">Fig. 6D</xref>). The control construct showed only weak and patchy activation of the UAS-EGFP reporter behind the morphogenetic furrow reflecting the stochastic background access of GAL4-VP16 to DNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001414-g006">Fig. 6E</xref>).

Their ability to methylate both DNA and RNA distinguishes Dnmt2 enzymes from other cytosine-5 methyltransferases, and might provide a mechanistic link between RNA and DNA modifications. Proteins belonging to the Dnmt family of enzymes have traditionally been viewed to reside in the nucleus. Interestingly, cytoplasmic localization of Dnmt1 has also been described <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001414-Inano1">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref>, but the functional significance of this observation is not understood. While DNA is concentrated in nuclei, RNA molecules are abundant both in nuclear and cytoplasmic compartments. Therefore, a cytosine-5 methyltransferase with activity towards both DNA and RNA substrates could function in any compartment containing nucleic acids and the specificity to the respective substrate could be determined by binding partners. Consistent with this notion, our results show that the localization of <italic>Drosophila</italic> Dnmt2 is both cytoplasmic and nuclear and therefore more complex than previously anticipated <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001414-Goll1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>In contrast to previous work, which used either unpurified antibodies against Dnmt2 peptides <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001414-Kunert1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref> or antibodies cross-reacting with the catalytic motifs of mammalian Dnmt1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001414-Hung1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>, we have used purified antibodies against a Dnmt2-specific peptide to unambiguously identify Dnmt2 as a 40 kDa cytoplasmic and nuclear protein. Both cellular compartments contain Dnmt2 throughout development. At the tissue level, Dnmt2 is ubiquitously expressed but is enriched in muscle and gut of the developing embryo, in the cytoplasm of developing ovarian cysts as well as in proliferating cells in testes. A tissue-specific expression pattern has also been observed for zebrafish Dnmt2 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001414-Rai1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>.

The reasons for this discrepancy are presently unknown.</p><p>It has been shown that epitope-tagged human DNMT2 localizes to the cytoplasm of transiently transfected NIH3T3 cells and this observation has been interpreted to reflect a general cytoplasmic localization of Dnmt2 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001414-Goll1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>. However, a nuclear or chromatin localization of Dnmt2-like proteins has been reported in Dictyostelium <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001414-Kuhlmann1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref> and in <italic>Entamoeba</italic>. In the latter organism, Dnmt2 has been biochemically associated with the nuclear matrix <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001414-Banerjee1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>. These results suggested that Dnmt2 proteins could interact directly with DNA. Of note, Dnmt2 contains no nuclear localization signal but a predicted nuclear export signal (aa 281-293). This suggests that other pathways are mediating Dnmt2 localization to nuclei and that nuclear occupancy might be time controlled. In agreement with this notion we found that Dnmt2 is re-localizing to nuclear structures during specific stages of the cell cycle.</p><p>Our sub-cellular fractionation experiments showed that a significant amount of nuclear Dnmt2 was insoluble after micrococcal nuclease digest, DNAse treatment and salt extraction. This suggested that nuclear Dnmt2 is tightly bound to structures such as the nuclear matrix.

Similar to Dnmt2, these proteins form an intranuclear spindle-shaped structure during prophase that precedes the assembly of the spindle. Skeletor/Chromator and microtubules display a similar distribution throughout mitosis, but by telophase, Skeletor/Chromator re-associate with chromatin while Dnmt2-EGFP localizes to microtubule structures such as the midbody.

Ammonium sulphate was added to 0.25 M and, after 5 minutes at 4&#x000b0;C, samples were centrifuged. The pellet was further extracted with 2 M NaCl in CSK buffer for 5 minutes at 4&#x000b0;C. The remaining pellet was solubilized in urea extraction buffer (see above) and was considered the nuclear matrix-containing fraction.</p></sec><sec id="s4g"><title>Live imaging analysis</title><p>Staged collections were de-chorionated, thoroughly washed, aligned on a cover slip and overlaid with voltalef 10 S oil.
