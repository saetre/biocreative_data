The RNA includes three open reading frames flanked by 5' and 3' noncoding regions of 509 and 480 nucleotides. The open reading frames specify coat protein, a 29.6K product homologous to the 29.1K product of TRV(TCM) RNA2 and a 23K product not homologous to any previously described protein. The homology demonstrated between the coat proteins of PRV, TRV and PEBV indicates a common evolutionary origin for these proteins. Upstream of each ORF are located sequences homologous to those with which subgenomic RNAs of other tobraviruses start. Subgenomic RNAs for the expression of the three ORFs may start at these points. On all five tobraviral RNA2 molecules sequenced to date, these sequences were found upstream of the coat protein ORF in association with a strongly-conserved potential secondary structural element. Similar potential structures were identified upstream of other tobraviral ORFs. These structures may contribute to the activity of the tobraviral subgenomic promoter.</p><sec><title>Images</title><fig id="F1"><graphic xlink:href="nar00199-0193-a" xlink:role="4509"/></fig></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><supplementary-material content-type="scanned-pages"><graphic xlink:href="nar00199-0191.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="4507"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00199-0192.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="4508"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00199-0193.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="4509"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00199-0194.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="4510"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00199-0195.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="4511"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00199-0196.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="4512"/></supplementary-material></body></article>
