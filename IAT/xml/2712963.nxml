Using biochemistry and fluorescence resonance energy transfer&#x02013;based approaches, we now show that a family of related proteins, PTRF/Cavin-1, serum deprivation response (SDR)/Cavin-2, SDR-related gene product that binds to C kinase (SRBC)/Cavin-3, and muscle-restricted coiled-coil protein (MURC)/Cavin-4, forms a multiprotein complex that associates with caveolae. This complex can constitutively assemble in the cytosol and associate with caveolin at plasma membrane caveolae. Cavin-1, but not other cavins, can induce caveola formation in a heterologous system and is required for the recruitment of the cavin complex to caveolae. The tissue-restricted expression of cavins suggests that caveolae may perform tissue-specific functions regulated by the composition of the cavin complex. Cavin-4 is expressed predominantly in muscle, and its distribution is perturbed in human muscle disease associated with Caveolin-3 dysfunction, identifying Cavin-4 as a novel muscle disease candidate caveolar protein.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p>Caveolae are a characteristic feature of most mammalian cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Parton and Simons, 2007</xref>). The major membrane protein components of caveolae, caveolins, are integral membrane proteins that bind cholesterol and form high molecular weight oligomers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Monier et al., 1996</xref>). Caveolin-1 (Cav1), the major nonmuscle isoform of the caveolin family, is essential for caveola formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Fra et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Drab et al., 2001</xref>). Loss of Cav1 in mice and human patients causes severe lipid dysregulation, including perturbation of lipid storage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Razani et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Fernandez et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Le Lay et al., 2006</xref>), disruption of lipolysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cohen et al., 2004</xref>), insulin resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Capozza et al., 2005</xref>), and a severe lipodystrophy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Garg and Agarwal, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kim et al., 2008</xref>). Caveolae have also been implicated in the regulation of cell proliferation, mechanosensation, and endocytosis of specific cargoes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Tagawa et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Yao et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cheng et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Parton and Simons, 2007</xref>). Caveolins have also been strongly linked to disease states including breast and prostate cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lee et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Tahir et al., 2008</xref>) and, in the case of the muscle-specific Caveolin-3 (Cav3), muscle diseases known as caveolinopathies (for a review see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Woodman et al., 2004</xref>).</p><p>Until recently, studies of caveolae have invariably focused on caveolins in the absence of information on other bona fide caveolar machinery proteins. However, although caveolins are essential for biogenesis of caveolae, recent studies have highlighted additional levels of regulation of caveola formation and potentially function. These studies have shown a role for accessory proteins, such as polymerase I and transcript release factor (PTRF)/Cavin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hill et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Liu and Pilch, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Liu et al., 2008</xref>), and kinases, including ARAF1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Pelkmans and Zerial, 2005</xref>), which regulate caveola formation. This has started to change the perception of caveolae as a stable domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Pelkmans et al., 2004</xref>).</p><p>PTRF/Cavin was originally described as a protein able to dissociate transcription complexes in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Mason et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Jansa et al., 1998</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">2001</xref>) and was more recently shown to localize to caveolae (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Vinten et al., 2001</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Voldstedlund et al., 2001</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">2003</xref>). PTRF/Cavin is enriched in caveolar fractions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aboulaich et al., 2004</xref>), and monoclonal antibodies to PTRF/Cavin specifically labeled morphological caveolae in adipocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Vinten et al., 2001</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">2005</xref>). PTRF/Cavin was subsequently shown to be essential for caveola formation in mammalian cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hill et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Liu and Pilch, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Liu et al., 2008</xref>), zebrafish (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hill et al., 2008</xref>), and mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Liu et al., 2008</xref>). PTRF/Cavin shares sequence homology with a family of proteins classified as PTRF/SDR homology proteins in Swissprot (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.expasy.org">http://www.expasy.org</ext-link>). These include serum deprivation response (SDR) gene product (also called SDPR; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gustincich and Schneider, 1993</xref>) and SDR-related gene product that binds to C kinase (SRBC; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Izumi et al., 1997</xref>). As well as showing significant sequence homology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Xu et al., 2001</xref>), all three proteins have been suggested to bind to phosphatidylserine (PS; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Burgener et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Izumi et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gustincich et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hill et al., 2008</xref>). In addition, several studies have linked SDR and SRBC to protein kinase C (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Izumi et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Mineo et al., 1998</xref>) and to caveolae, including a proteomic study of adipocyte caveolin-enriched fractions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aboulaich et al., 2004</xref>), recruitment of SDR to detergent-resistant floating fractions by Cav1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hill et al., 2008</xref>), and immunolocalization of SDR to caveolae (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Mineo et al., 1998</xref>). By analogy to PTRF/Cavin, these studies raise the possibility that these related proteins regulate some aspect of caveolar function.</p><p>We have now extensively characterized the members of the mammalian PTRF/SDR family of proteins, termed Cavins. Using several complementary approaches, we show that these proteins are coexpressed and coassociate in mammalian cells to form an oligomeric assembly that we term the Cavin complex. This complex is present in the cytosol, but in cells expressing caveolins, the cavin complex is associated with caveolae. Functional studies in a heterologous cell system show an essential role for PTRF/Cavin-1 but not the other identified family members in caveola formation and recruitment of the cavin complex to the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hill et al., 2008</xref>; this study). The tissue-specific expression of cavins suggests that each member regulates tissue-specific caveolae functions. We also report that a fourth member of the family, previously proposed to be a purely cytosolic protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Ogata et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Tagawa et al., 2008</xref>), is a muscle-specific component of the cavin complex associated with the sarcolemmal caveolae of muscle cells. Moreover, we demonstrate that this protein, muscle-restricted coiled-coil protein (MURC)/Cavin-4, is a new candidate protein for caveolin-associated muscle disease.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec><title>Identification of PTRF/Cavin-related proteins; MURC/Cavin-4 is a muscle-enriched PTRF family member</title><p>Through sequence homology searches, we identified a putative PTRF/SDR family member, which we term Cavin-4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 a</xref>).

As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 (b and c)</xref>, the mouse Cavin-4 sequence encodes a protein of 362 amino acids, which shares structural PEST (proline, glutamic acid, serine, and threonine-rich) domains with other cavins. Interestingly, all the family members are predicted to have regions of intrinsic disorder, which are coincident with the predicted PEST domains (disorder predictions made at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://bioinf.cs.ucl.ac.uk/disopred/index.html">http://bioinf.cs.ucl.ac.uk/disopred/index.html</ext-link>). In addition to the PEST domains, PTRF/Cavin-1, SDR/Cavin-2, and SRBC/Cavin-3 are also predicted to have leucine-rich regions (putative leucine zipper), and Cavin-1 contains polybasic regions (possible nuclear localization signals).</p><p>Orthologues of Cavin-4 were identified in mammals, fish, and frogs but not <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic>. Murine Cavin-4 shows 29% homology and 49% similarity to Cavin-1, 24% homology and 42% similarity to Cavin-2, and 20% homology and 39% similarity to Cavin-3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 e</xref>). Evolutionary analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 d</xref>) demonstrated distinct clades for the family members. The sequence homology between all the family members is higher in the N-terminal region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 c</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gustincich et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Xu et al., 2001</xref>), and based on this, we propose that this family of proteins shares two homology regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1c</xref>) with 61&#x02013;77% sequence similarity in region I and 78&#x02013;87% in region II among the cavin family members.</p><p>The tissue distribution of Cavin-1 closely parallels that of Cav1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hill et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Liu et al., 2008</xref>). To examine the tissue distribution of the other family members, we performed immunoblotting using affinity-purified rabbit antibodies to each cavin. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 a</xref>, the tissue distribution of Cavin-2 and -3 also correlates with Cav1 expression. For Cavin-4, in agreement with other data (Cancer Genome Anatomy Project virtual northern expression pattern for cluster UniGene accession no. <ext-link ext-link-type="gen" xlink:href="Hs.99004">Hs.99004</ext-link>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Tagawa et al., 2008</xref>), we detected a high expression level in skeletal and cardiac muscles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 a</xref>). We also examined the expression of Cavin-2 to -4 in tissues from <italic>cavin-1</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Liu et al., 2008</xref>). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 a</xref>, the genetic loss of Cavin-1 results in a marked loss of Cav1-3 proteins in all tissues (80&#x02013;90%; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Liu et al., 2008</xref>). The levels of Cavin-2 and -3 proteins were also reduced in the tissues where Cavin-1 and other cavins are coexpressed, although this loss was not to the same extent as the reduction in caveolins. Cavin-3 and Cavin-4 proteins were generally the least affected by the absence of Cavin-1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 a</xref>), and Cavin-3 is expressed in liver and brain where the other caveolae proteins are expressed at very low levels. Interestingly, Cavin-4 expression levels in cardiac and skeletal muscle were not affected by the absence of Cavin-1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 a</xref>). Cavin-3, which is most highly expressed in cardiac muscle, was also not affected by the loss of Cavin-1 in this tissue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 a</xref>). Strengthening the link to caveolae, levels of Cavin-2 and -3 were also decreased in tissues from mice lacking Cav1, whereas Cavin-4 levels were decreased in cardiac muscle but not in skeletal muscle (unpublished data), where the isoform Cav3 is predominant over Cav1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Way and Parton, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Parton et al., 1997</xref>). Collectively, the results in Cavin-1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> and Cav1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> tissues suggest that these proteins are to some extent coregulated at the level of protein expression/stability.

Interestingly, in contrast to results from Cavin-1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> tissues, our knockdown experiments in 3T3-L1 adipocytes showed that the loss of Cavin-1 caused a marked reduction in Cavin-3 protein. In contrast, knockdown of Cavin-2 in adipocytes resulted in a more modest reduction of Cavin-1 with relatively little effect on Cavin-3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 b</xref>). We have not yet been able to achieve a significant knockdown of Cavin-3 in adipocytes, and at a 40&#x02013;50% short hairpin RNA (shRNA)&#x02013;mediated reduction in this protein, there is no apparent effect on the other caveolae proteins (unpublished data).</p></sec><sec><title>The cavin family proteins localize to caveolae and are dependent on Cav1 for membrane association</title><p>SDR/Cavin-2 and SRBC/Cavin-3 have been suggested to associate with caveolae (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Mineo et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Izumi et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gustincich et al., 1999</xref>). In addition, MURC/Cavin-4 has been proposed to interact with Cavin-2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Ogata et al., 2008</xref>). In view of the sequence homology between the family members and the aforementioned findings, we postulated that all four family members associate with caveolae. Consistent with this hypothesis, all four cavins showed colocalization with Cav1 at the cell surface when expressed in BHK cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 a</xref>). As observed previously with PTRF/Cavin-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hill et al., 2008</xref>), Cavin-2, -3, and -4 did not associate with caveolin in the Golgi, which may indicate that these proteins recognize the plasma membrane environment generated by caveolin. Although plasma membrane Cav1 is organized in higher order oligomers, Golgi Cav1 is predominantly monomeric (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Pol et al., 2005</xref>). Differences in oligomerization state may alter the lipid environment, leading to differential cavin recruitment. We next tested whether caveolin is necessary for recruitment of cavins to the plasma membrane using wild-type (WT) and Cav1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> immortalized mouse embryonic fibroblasts (iMEFs). All four cavins showed plasma membrane association and colocalized with Cav1 in WT iMEFs, but in Cav1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> iMEFs, the cavin proteins accumulated in the cytosol (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 b</xref>).</p><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><p><bold>Cavins colocalize with caveolin and are dependent on caveolin for surface localization.</bold> (a) BHK cells transfected with GFP-tagged Cavin-1, -2, -3, or -4 (green) were PFA fixed and immunolabeled for endogenous Cav1 (red).

Glut4 appears on day 4, which serves as a control for the differentiation process and acquisition of insulin-sensitive glucose transport (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Birnbaum, 1989</xref>). Therefore, the adipocyte differentiation model is not only useful for its classical role in determining the ontogeny of adipocyte-specific processes, but it also allows us to determine a possible assembly hierarchy for the proteins associated with and involved in caveola biogenesis.

Western blotting showed that all four members were expressed as full-length fusion proteins with no significant degradation (Fig. S1 b).

In isolated muscle fibers, high resolution light microscopic analysis of Cavin-4 showed highly organized radial arrays of Cavin-4 labeling over the sarcolemma of the muscle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig. 7 c</xref>), which partially colocalized with Cav3 (not depicted). We next examined the distribution of Cavin-4 at the ultrastructural level in C2C12 myotubes and in skeletal muscle by immuno-EM on frozen sections. Specific labeling was observed in pits and vesicular profiles close to the plasma membrane of the C2C12 myotubes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig. 7, d&#x02013;f</xref>) and skeletal muscle (not depicted) consistent with the association of Cavin-4 with caveolae.

The cavin complex can be present in the cytosol, but it is recruited by caveolin to generate caveolae. PTRF/Cavin-1 is a crucial component for recruitment of this complex to caveolae, establishing a hierarchy of interactions required for caveola formation. Indeed, in cultured adipocytes, PTRF/Cavin-1 and Cav1 show identical temporal expression followed by that of SDR/Cavin-2, suggesting that the latter is recruited to caveolae after their formation at the cell surface. In addition, we have characterized a new member of the family, MURC/Cavin-4, and demonstrated both the caveolar localization of this protein and its redistribution in caveolin-associated muscle disease. The role of PTRF/Cavin-1 in caveola stability and/or formation and the density of the cavin proteins on the cytoplasmic face of caveolae, as shown by immuno-EM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig. 7</xref>), raises the possibility that the cavin complex acts as a coatlike structural component of caveolae.</p><p>This study has shown that cavins are dependent on caveolins for membrane association. Cavin family members show tissue-specific expression, pointing to regulation of the cavin complex at a transcriptional level, which in turn regulates caveola function. Strengthening the association and cofunction of the cavin proteins, we show that SDR/Cavin-2 and SRBC/Cavin-3 proteins are down-regulated in <italic>cavin-1</italic> knockout mice and cell lines. Furthermore, in view of the differences in the expression of these proteins in different tissues, it is likely that the members of this family have functions outside the caveolar structure. Although cavins are dependent on caveolins for membrane association, we were able to detect similar levels of interaction between PTRF/Cavin-1 and the other cavin family members in the WT and Cav1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> fibroblasts by FLIM/FRET, suggesting that the complex formation is not dependent on caveolins. By PTRF/Cavin-1 coimmunoprecipitation, we showed that the complex contained all the four cavin proteins in the cytosol with the additional binding of caveolin in the membrane fraction. This suggests a model in which cavin proteins constitutively associate in the cytosol and are recruited to membrane caveolae. Lipid binding is also likely to play a significant role in cavin association with caveolae through multiple PS-binding components with possible parallels to lipid (PIP2, in the AP2 complex) binding of adaptor complex components. The interaction of AP2 components with these lipids is of low affinity, but this weak binding is enhanced by other interactions including oligomerization to generate a complex with multiple lipid-interacting sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Carlton and Cullen, 2005</xref>) as well as interactions with cargo proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Honing et al., 2005</xref>). These mutually stabilizing interactions cause the AP2 complex to act as a coincidence detector, relying on the multiple interactions to generate a high avidity interaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Carlton and Cullen, 2005</xref>). In concordance with this hypothesis, MURC/Cavin-4 is also able to interact with PS in vitro (unpublished data) as previously shown for PTRF/Cavin-1, SDR/Cavin-2, and SRBC/Cavin-3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Burgener et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Izumi et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gustincich et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hill et al., 2008</xref>). Interestingly, caveolin peptides have been suggested to generate domains enriched in PS in a liposome-based system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Wanaski et al., 2003</xref>), a process that could further enhance the avidity of the cavin interaction with caveolin-rich domains. This model of coincidence detection also offers a mechanism to rapidly disassemble the caveolin&#x02013;cavin complex upon modulation of one of the components, as suggested for phosphoinositide-based membrane complex formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Carlton and Cullen, 2005</xref>). The association with surface caveolae is disrupted by cholesterol depletion, which perturbs caveolar structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hill et al., 2008</xref>). Collectively with the results of this study, these results suggest that the cavin complex can act to sense changes in caveolar structure or composition. The release of the cavin complex on caveolar disruption could then provide a signaling mechanism from the cell surface to intracellular compartments, a fascinating possibility in view of the strengthening links between caveolae and mechanosensation as well as potential nuclear functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Ogata et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Tagawa et al., 2008</xref>).</p><p>All four cavin proteins can be detected in skeletal muscle preparations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 a</xref>), but SRBC/Cavin-3 and MURC/Cavin-4 are highly expressed, suggesting a particularly important role in this tissue. MURC/Cavin-4 is evolutionarily conserved, and high throughput analysis of expression of proteins in the developing zebrafish embryo also suggests that a putative zebrafish orthologue is expressed predominantly in skeletal muscle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Thisse and Thisse, 2004</xref>). Recent studies provided the first insights into the function of MURC/Cavin-4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Ogata et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Tagawa et al., 2008</xref>). MURC/Cavin-4 was shown to activate the extracellular signal-regulated kinase pathway, influencing skeletal muscle differentiation, and to activate RhoA and regulate the Rho&#x02013;ROCK pathway, modulating cardiac function. Overexpression of MURC/Cavin-4 in skeletal muscle and cardiac muscle promoted myogenesis and caused cardiac dysfunction and conduction disturbance, respectively. Consistent with this study, MURC/Cavin-4 was shown to interact with SDR/Cavin-2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Ogata et al., 2008</xref>). MURC/Cavin-4 was suggested to be a purely cytosolic protein in muscle, but our results, using multiple independent techniques, including immunogold EM of the endogenous protein, show the caveolar localization of the protein. MURC/Cavin-4 is enriched in cardiac and skeletal muscle but is clearly present at low levels in other cell types, such as embryonic fibroblasts, as shown in this study. We have also shown that MURC/Cavin-4 is a new candidate protein for caveolin-related muscle disease. Muscle from a patient with mosaic expression of Cav3 shows a striking loss of sarcolemmal MURC/Cavin-4 in the Cav3-negative fibers. As a possible sensor of caveolar form, study of the cavin complex in muscle diseases of unknown etiology may provide insights into caveolinopathies where mutations in Cav3 are not the primary defect. In addition, these experiments raise the possibility, which is being tested at present, that mutations in MURC/Cavin-4 directly cause muscle disease.</p><p>The identification of a possible caveola coat complex, as shown in this study, will provide new insights into the generation and function of this newly discovered molecular assembly. Whether the cavin complex shows any similarity in basic design principles and in the mechanisms of assembly and disassembly to other well-characterized coat complexes is now amenable to analysis.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Antibodies and reagents</title><p>Monoclonal antibodies recognizing Cavin-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Vinten et al., 2001</xref>), Cav1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Souto et al., 2003</xref>), and Glut4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">James et al., 1988</xref>) have been previously described.
