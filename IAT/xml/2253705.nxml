Whether parkin exists as a monomer or as part of a stable protein complex <italic>in vivo</italic> is uncertain. Here we demonstrate that endogenous parkin occurs in a stable, non-covalent, &#x0223c;110-kDa complex in native extracts from mouse brain, heart and skeletal muscle, while monomeric parkin is undetectable. Partial denaturation experiments indicate that this complex is at least a tetramer. Reported parkin-binding partners do not show detectable association with the parkin complex on native gels. Upon overexpression in COS1, SH-SY5Y or CHO cells, parkin accumulates predominantly as a monomer, suggesting that the interactors required for complex formation are available in limiting amounts in these cells. Importantly, PD-linked <italic>parkin</italic> mutations significantly impair parkin complex formation. These data demonstrate that parkin oligomerizes into a stable, non-covalent, heteromeric complex <italic>in vivo</italic>, and suggest that parkin may have as yet unidentified stable binding partners.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>binding partners</kwd><kwd>blue native gel electrophoresis</kwd><kwd>mouse</kwd><kwd>mutations</kwd><kwd>Parkinson's disease</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Introduction</title><p><italic>Parkin</italic> mutations are among the most common causes of familial Parkinson's disease (PD), accounting for approximately 50% of early onset autosomal recessive cases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">Kitada <italic>et al.</italic>, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">L&#x000fc;cking <italic>et al.</italic>, 2000</xref>). Parkin is a cytosolic, 52-kDa E3 ubiquitin ligase responsible for targeting specific substrates for proteasomal degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">Imai <italic>et al.</italic>, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">Shimura <italic>et al.</italic>, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">Zhang <italic>et al.</italic>, 2000</xref>). A variety of PD-linked <italic>parkin</italic> mutations have been shown to induce a loss of parkin function through direct catalytic impairment or by decreasing parkin solubility or stability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">Henn <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">Sriram <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>). Thus, pathogenic <italic>parkin</italic> mutations could cause neurodegeneration through a toxic accumulation of one or more parkin substrates. However, other PD-linked <italic>parkin</italic> mutations have no discernible impact on the intrinsic ubiquitin ligase activity, solubility or other biochemical properties of parkin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">Hampe <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>), and the pathogenic mechanism of these mutations remains unknown.</p><p>A large number of putative parkin substrates have been reported, including cell division control-related protein 1 (CDCrel-1; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">Zhang <italic>et al.</italic>, 2000</xref>), synphilin-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">Chung <italic>et al.</italic>, 2001</xref>), parkin-associated endothelin receptor-like receptor (Pael-R; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">Imai <italic>et al.</italic>, 2001</xref>), O-glycosylated &#x003b1;-synuclein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">Shimura <italic>et al.</italic>, 2001</xref>), &#x003b1;/&#x003b2;-tubulin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">Ren <italic>et al.</italic>, 2003</xref>), cyclin E (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">Staropoli <italic>et al.</italic>, 2003</xref>), the p38 subunit of the aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">Corti <italic>et al.</italic>, 2003</xref>), the nuclear membrane-associated protein Ras-related nuclear small G-protein-binding protein 2 (RanBP2; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">Um <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>) and ataxin-2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">Huynh <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>). Importantly, parkin may also ubiquitinate substrates in proteasome-independent pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">Lim <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>), as recently shown for epidermal-growth-factor receptor pathway substrate clone (Eps15; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">Fallon <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>), tumour necrosis factor receptor-associated factor 2 (TRAF2) and I&#x003ba;B kinase &#x003b3; (IKK&#x003b3;; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">Henn <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>).</p><p>In addition to binding transiently to substrates, parkin may also interact more stably with non-substrate-binding partners. For example, binding of parkin to C-terminus of heat shock protein 70 (Hsp70)-interacting protein (CHIP) has been reported to enhance the ubiquitin ligase activity of parkin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">Imai <italic>et al.</italic>, 2002</xref>). Conversely, parkin activity is inhibited by interaction with bcl-2-associated athanogene 5 (BAG5; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">Kalia <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>) or with the chaperones Hsp70 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">Imai <italic>et al.</italic>, 2002</xref>) or 14-3-3&#x003b7; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">Sato <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>). According to a different study parkin functions in a multiprotein ubiquitin ligase complex including the F-box protein hSel-10 and cullin-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">Staropoli <italic>et al.</italic>, 2003</xref>). In this complex hSel-10, rather than parkin itself, would be responsible for substrate recognition. Association with calcium/calmodulin-dependent serine protein kinase (CASK) may localize parkin to the synapse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">Fallon <italic>et al.</italic>, 2002</xref>), while interaction with &#x003b1;/&#x003b2; tubulin may anchor parkin to microtubules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">Yang <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>). Parkin may associate with the E2 enzyme ubiquitin-conjugating human enzyme 7 (UbcH7; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">Imai <italic>et al.</italic>, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">Shimura <italic>et al.</italic>, 2001</xref>), or may be attached to the proteasome through interactions with the proteasomal subunits regulatory particle non-ATPase 10 (Rpn10; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">Sakata <italic>et al.</italic>, 2003</xref>) or XAPC7 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">Dachsel <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>). Finally, parkin has also been reported to interact with DJ-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">Baulac <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>) and leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">Smith <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>), two other proteins linked to familial PD.</p><p>Many of the reported parkin interactions were identified through <italic>in vitro</italic> assays, such as yeast-two-hybrid studies, and the <italic>in vivo</italic> significance of these interactions is uncertain.

After incubation for 30 min the samples were centrifuged at 20 000 <bold><italic>g</italic></bold> for 5 min. To test whether parkin was fully extracted in 1% Triton X-100, the pellets remaining after the final 20 000 <bold><italic>g</italic></bold> spin were solubilized in 1.5% sodium dodecyl sulphate (SDS) at 100 &#x000b0;C for 10 min.

We transfected 80 ng of cDNA per cm<sup>2</sup> of COS1, CHO or HEK-293 cell culture, unless otherwise indicated. SH-SY5Y cells were transiently transfected with the Nucleofector system (Amaxa) using the T16 program according to the instructions of the manufacturer. Human wild-type parkin cDNA was kindly provided by Dr K. Winklhofer (Max-Planck-Institute for Biochemistry, Martinsried, Germany; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">Winklhofer <italic>et al.</italic>, 2003</xref>). In experiments comparing wild-type and pathogenic parkin variants, COS1 cells were transfected with cDNAs encoding HA-tagged versions of wild-type, A82E, K161N, K211N, R256C and R275W parkin. The cDNAs for these HA-tagged parkin versions were constructed as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">Hampe <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>). Under the transfection conditions used in this study, phase-contrast microscopy immediately before cell harvest revealed no observable toxicity of COS1 cells expressing wild-type or PD-linked parkin versions (not shown). This was confirmed by SDS&#x02013;PAGE and Western blot experiments showing similar &#x003b2;-tubulin levels in COS1 cells transfected with the different parkin variants (not shown), thus assuring similar amounts of cellular input material. Two days after COS1, CHO and HEK-293 cell transfection, and 24 h after SH-SY5Y cell transfection, the medium was aspirated and the cells were washed in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). The cells were removed from the plate with a cell scraper, resuspended in 1% Triton X-100/20 m<sc>m</sc> Tris, and solubilized for 30 min at 4 &#x000b0;C. Insoluble material was removed by centrifugation at 20 000 <bold><italic>g</italic></bold> for 5 min.

Glycerol gradient centrifugation and BN-PAGE was performed in the same way as for the brain extracts. In each of the glycerol gradient and BN-PAGE experiments comparing parkin complex formation between wild-type and pathogenic variants, we also compared the soluble levels of wild-type and mutant parkin versions by parallel SDS&#x02013;PAGE of 15 &#x000b5;g of the Triton-soluble protein extracts.

The PRK109 antibody also showed some minor, non-specific immunoreactivity at higher molecular weights (indicated by the asterisk) in S5 from both wild-type and parkin knockout. (C) The graph shows how BN gels were calibrated based on the relative mobilities of native protein size markers to determine the molecular weight (MW) of the parkin complex. Markers, denoted by black circles, were thyroglobulin (669 kDa), ferritin (440 kDa), catalase (232 kDa), lactate dehydrogenase (140 kDa) and bovine serum albumin (67 kDa). The dotted line indicates the estimated MW of the parkin complex. (D) In the left and middle panels, heating brain fraction S5 at 100 &#x000b0;C in 1.5% sodium dodecyl sulphate (SDS) for 10 min immediately prior to BN-PAGE disrupted the &#x0223c;110-kDa parkin complex and led to the appearance of monomeric parkin (indicated by the arrow). In the rightmost panel, approximately 50 ng of purified recombinant parkin was analysed by BN-PAGE and Western blot with PRK109 without heat treatment or addition of SDS, revealing a band (indicated by the arrow) with apparent molecular weight (&#x0223c;50 kDa) consistent with that of monomeric parkin.

There was also some minor immunoreactivity at higher molecular weights (asterisk in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02">Fig. 2B</xref>), but this was also found in the parkin knockout and thus probably resulted from non-specific binding.

However, the reported parkin-interacting proteins BAG5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">Kalia <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>), CHIP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">Imai <italic>et al.</italic>, 2002</xref>), 14-3-3&#x003b7; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">Sato <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>), hSel-10 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">Staropoli <italic>et al.</italic>, 2003</xref>) and Hsp70 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">Imai <italic>et al.</italic>, 2002</xref>) migrated in characteristic, reproducible band patterns that clearly differed from that of parkin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig05">Fig. 5</xref>). By contrast, immunoreactivity for &#x003b1;-tubulin and &#x003b2;-tubulin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">Yang <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>), two proteins with monomeric molecular masses of &#x0223c;50 kDa, partially overlapped with the 110-kDa parkin band (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig06">Fig. 6A</xref>). One possible interpretation was that the parkin band represented a stable complex of parkin with monomeric tubulin. Alternatively, the overlap of immunoreactivity could simply be due to the close proximity of the molecular weight of the &#x003b1;/&#x003b2;-tubulin heterodimer to that of the parkin complex. To discriminate between these two possibilities, we performed antibody supershift experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig06">Fig. 6B</xref>). If parkin and tubulin coexist in a stable complex, incubation of extracts with anti-tubulin antibody before BN-PAGE should change the migration of parkin due to antibody binding to parkin&#x02013;tubulin complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">Yang <italic>et al.</italic>, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">Vandenberghe <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005a</xref>). However, this was not the case, arguing against the existence of a stable parkin&#x02013;tubulin complex in these extracts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig06">Fig. 6B</xref>). This conclusion was further supported by the similar migration pattern of tubulin from wild-type and parkin-null brain extracts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig06">Fig. 6C</xref>).

However, this was highly unlikely for four reasons. First, the apparent molecular mass (&#x0223c;50 kDa) of purified recombinant parkin on native gels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02">Fig. 2D</xref>) already suggested that parkin does not easily form homodimers. Second, parkin overexpression experiments in cell lines argued against a homodimeric composition of the parkin complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig07">Fig. 7</xref>). Endogenous parkin was not detectable with our BN-PAGE assay in untransfected COS1, SH-SY5Y, CHO or HEK-293 cells (data not shown). However, when we transfected parkin in COS1, SH-SY5Y or CHO cells, the protein accumulated predominantly as a monomer, with only minor formation of the &#x0223c;110-kDa complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig07">Fig. 7A&#x02013;C</xref>). This strongly suggested that the &#x0223c;110-kDa complex was not a parkin dimer, but rather contained components that were present in limiting amounts in transfected COS1, SH-SY5Y and CHO cells. Interestingly, the abundance of the &#x0223c;110-kDa complex (relative to that of the parkin monomer) was dramatically higher in transfected HEK-293 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig07">Fig. 7D</xref>) than in COS1, SH-SY5Y or CHO cells, suggesting that HEK-293 cells expressed higher endogenous levels of the binding partners required for complex formation.</p><fig id="fig07" position="float"><label>F<sc>ig</sc>. 7</label><caption><p>Overexpressed parkin accumulates predominantly as a monomer in several cell lines.

Upon overexpression parkin migrated as a monomer (indicated by the arrow on the left of the first panel). After more prolonged film exposure, a small amount of the &#x0223c;110-kDa complex was detected, as illustrated by comparison with the endogenous parkin band (indicated by the arrowhead) from brain (Br.).

With higher total parkin expression levels, there was relatively little change in the amount of complex, but there was a clear increase in the amount of monomer. Thus, formation of the &#x0223c;110-kDa complex again appeared to be limited by the endogenous levels of the required parkin-binding partners.</p><p>Finally, partial denaturation experiments did not support a (homo)dimeric structure of the parkin complex.

The most parsimonious explanation for this observation would be that the &#x0223c;60-kDa band represented a complex of parkin with a protein other than parkin itself, the &#x0223c;80-kDa band reflected the association of a third component and the &#x0223c;110-kDa band arose from the addition of yet another subunit. According to this simple model, the &#x0223c;110-kDa complex would be a tetramer. Alternatively, it was also possible that, for example, the &#x0223c;60-kDa band represented a complex of parkin with more than one other protein, in which case the &#x0223c;110-kDa complex would contain more than four components. Hence, the findings suggested that the &#x0223c;110-kDa complex was at least a tetramer.

However, a subset of PD-linked <italic>parkin</italic> mutations (including the A82E, K161N, K211N and R256C missense mutations) have little impact on parkin solubility, stability or interaction with known binding partners or on its intrinsic catalytic activity in a cell-free system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">Hampe <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>). The pathogenic mechanism of these mutations thus remains elusive. We therefore explored whether the A82E, K161N, K211N and R256C mutations disrupted the &#x0223c;110-kDa complex. We transfected wild-type, A82E, K161N, K211N and R256C parkin cDNA into COS1 cells to determine the relative amounts of parkin complex and monomer. Importantly, Triton-soluble parkin levels were similar for the wild-type, A82E, K161N, K211N and R256C variants, as shown by parallel control experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig09">Fig. 9C and D</xref>), thus precluding confounding effects of parkin expression levels on the observed complex/monomer ratios. Interestingly, each of the four mutations significantly impaired formation of the &#x0223c;110-kDa parkin complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig09">Fig. 9A and B</xref>). Quantitatively, the A82E, K161N, K211N and R256C mutations caused a &#x0223c;40%, &#x0223c;60%, &#x0223c;50% and &#x0223c;30% reduction, respectively, of the amount of parkin complex relative to total parkin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig09">Fig. 9B</xref>). Given the similar soluble parkin expression levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig09">Fig. 9C and D</xref>), the differences in parkin complex/monomer ratio between wild-type and mutant proteins indicated a reduced intrinsic ability of the mutants to form the &#x0223c;110-kDa complex.

Our study has led to two important conclusions. First, parkin exists in mouse brain and muscle as part of a stable, non-covalent, heteromeric complex with a molecular mass of &#x0223c;110 kDa. Surprisingly, monomeric parkin is not detectable <italic>in vivo</italic>. Second, PD-linked parkin mutations significantly compromise formation of this complex.</p><p>Recent work has shown that the solubility of parkin decreases in ageing human brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">Pawlyk <italic>et al.</italic>, 2003</xref>) and that oxidative stress can induce parkin aggregation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">Winklhofer <italic>et al.</italic>, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">LaVoie <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">Wang <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>). However, the &#x0223c;110-kDa parkin complex detected in this study is clearly not an aggregate, for three reasons. First, a parkin aggregate would be expected to be poorly soluble and to be extractable only in harsher detergents, whereas the &#x0223c;110-kDa parkin complex is highly soluble and easily extracted from mouse brain even in the absence of detergents. Second, aggregated parkin would be expected to appear on the gel as a ladder or smear of high-molecular-weight species rather than as a discrete band of &#x0223c;110 kDa. Third, conditions of transient overexpression generally increase the tendency of proteins to aggregate due to molecular crowding. However, upon overexpression in COS1, SH-SY5Y or CHO cells parkin accumulated in monomeric form with only limited formation of the &#x0223c;110-kDa parkin complex. This led to the conclusion that the &#x0223c;110-kDa complex was not an aggregate, but rather a complex of parkin with other proteins that were available in limiting amounts in the transfected cells.</p><p>In the present study previously reported parkin-interacting proteins did not show detectable association with the parkin complex after glycerol velocity gradient centrifugation and BN-PAGE. However, this assay is primarily designed to demonstrate interactions between stoichiometric components of stable protein complexes. The assay is less appropriate for detection of transient interactions (e.g. enzyme&#x02013;substrate interactions) or of stable interactions that involve only a small percentage of the parkin molecules. Also, some parkin interactions may be weak and may therefore be disrupted during the prolonged centrifugation and electrophoresis procedures. Therefore, the lack of observable co-migration of the parkin complex and known parkin-binding proteins does not argue against the authenticity of the previously reported parkin interactions, and the present study by no means implies that parkin does not bind to its published partners. Nevertheless, our findings raise the tantalizing possibility that some of the most stable binding partners of parkin still remain to be identified.</p><p>It is tempting to speculate that the as yet unidentified constituents of the &#x0223c;110-kDa complex may be required for optimal parkin function. For example, the other subunits could control parkin stability, subcellular localization, substrate specificity or ubiquitin ligase activity (including the preference of parkin for mono- vs polyubiquitination). If so, genes encoding the other components of the complex would be attractive candidates for inherited forms of parkinsonism and other neurodegenerative syndromes. Intriguingly, we observed that the PD-linked parkin mutants A82E, K161N, K211N and R256C have a significantly reduced ability to form the &#x0223c;110-kDa complex. If complex formation is indeed necessary for proper functioning of parkin in cells, the observed reduced capacity for complex formation will explain the hitherto poorly understood pathogenic nature of these mutations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">Hampe <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>). Also, this would resolve the paradox that the K161N and R256C mutants have less ubiquitination activity than wild-type when expressed in cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">Chung <italic>et al.</italic>, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">Sriram <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>), while possessing normal intrinsic ubiquitination activity in a cell-free system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">Hampe <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>).</p><p>Interestingly, the absence of detectable monomeric parkin in brain and muscle suggests that endogenous expression levels of parkin are limiting for formation of this complex <italic>in vivo</italic>. This would make this complex exquisitely vulnerable to even slight reductions in the availability of soluble parkin that may result from parkin mutations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">Winklhofer <italic>et al.</italic>, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">Henn <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">Sriram <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">Hampe <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>), as illustrated by our experiments with the R275W mutant. Cellular stress conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">Winklhofer <italic>et al.</italic>, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">LaVoie <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">Wang <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>) and normal ageing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">Pawlyk <italic>et al.</italic>, 2003</xref>) are also known to impair parkin solubility and would therefore also be predicted to reduce the level of the parkin complex.</p><p>Further biochemical purification of the native parkin complex will be required to elucidate the identity of its components and to determine how they control parkin function. An analogy can be made with the identification of the subunits of the Alzheimer's disease-linked presenilin complex. One of the first indications that the presenilins functioned as part of a stable, oligomeric protein complex was that glycerol velocity gradient centrifugation suggested a much higher native molecular weight for the presenilins than expected based on their amino acid sequence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">Capell <italic>et al.</italic>, 1998</xref>). It has taken several years and a variety of experimental approaches from multiple laboratories to identify nicastrin, anterior pharynx defective-1 (Aph-1) and presenilin enhancer-2 (Pen-2) as the additional constituents of the functional &#x003b3;-secretase complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">De Strooper, 2003</xref>).</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>We are grateful to Dr V.
