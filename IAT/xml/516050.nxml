There exists two types of tRNase Z: one is a short form (tRNase ZS) that consists of 300&#x02013;400 amino acids, and the other is a long form (tRNase ZL) that contains 800&#x02013;900 amino acids. Here we investigated whether the short and long forms have different preferences for various RNA substrates. We examined three recombinant tRNase ZSs from human, <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> and <italic>Thermotoga maritima</italic>, two recombinant tRNase ZLs from human and <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>, one tRNase ZL from pig liver, and the N- and C-terminal half regions of human tRNase ZL for cleavage of human micro-pre-tRNA<sup>Arg</sup> and the RNase 65 activity. All tRNase ZLs cleaved the micro-pre-tRNA and showed the RNase 65 activity, while all tRNase ZSs and both half regions of human tRNase ZL failed to do so with the exception of the C-terminal half, which barely cleaved the micro-pre-tRNA. We also show that only the long forms of tRNase Z can specifically cleave a target RNA under the direction of a new type of small guide RNA, hook RNA. These results indicate that indeed tRNase ZL and tRNase ZS have different substrate specificities and that the differences are attributed to the N-terminal half-domain of tRNase ZL. Furthermore, the optimal concentrations of NaCl, MgCl<sub>2</sub> and MnCl<sub>2</sub> differed between tRNase ZSs and tRNase ZLs, and the <italic>K</italic><sub>m</sub> values implied that tRNase ZLs interact with pre-tRNA substrates more strongly than tRNase ZSs.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>The genome of almost every organism contains the <italic>ELAC1</italic> and&#x0002f;or <italic>ELAC2</italic> genes, the products of which have been shown to be transfer RNA (tRNA) 3&#x02032; processing endoribonucleases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh774c1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh774c6">6</xref>). Although these enzymes have been called 3&#x02032; tRNase or RNase Z, we renamed them tRNase Z (EC 3.1.26.11) to avoid confusion. tRNase Z is an enzyme responsible for the removal of a 3&#x02032; trailer from pre-tRNA which is transcribed as a larger form. <italic>In vitro</italic> tRNA 3&#x02032; processing experiments showed that in most cases the enzymes cleave pre-tRNAs immediately downstream of a discriminator nucleotide, onto which the CCA residues are added to produce mature tRNA <italic>in vivo</italic>, while in some cases additional cleavages occur 1 nt upstream, or 1 or 2 nt downstream (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh774c2">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh774c4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh774c6">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh774c13">13</xref>). We have recently demonstrated that, exceptionally, the tRNase Z from <italic>Thermotoga maritima</italic> cleaves pre-tRNAs containing the <sup>74</sup>CCA<sup>76</sup> sequence precisely after the A<sup>76</sup> residue to create the mature CCA 3&#x02032; termini of tRNA molecules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh774c5">5</xref>).</p><p>The <italic>ELAC1</italic> genes encode short forms of tRNase Z (tRNase ZS) that consist of 300&#x02013;400 amino acids, while the <italic>ELAC2</italic> genes produce long forms of tRNase Z (tRNase ZL) that contain 800&#x02013;900 amino acids (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh774f1">1</xref>). The multiple protein alignment of tRNase Z orthologs has revealed that the C-terminal half region of tRNase ZL has high similarity to the whole region of tRNase ZS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh774c1">1</xref>). These regions contain a well-conserved histidine motif (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh774c1">1</xref>), which has shown to be essential for the tRNase Z activity in the <italic>T.maritima</italic> enzyme (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh774c5">5</xref>).</p><p>Bacteria and archaea genomes contain a gene for the short form of tRNase Z only, while eukaryote genomes encode either only the long form or both the short and long forms (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh774f1">1</xref>). The genomes of <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>, <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> and <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> encode only tRNase ZL. On the other hand, the genomes of human and <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> contain both tRNase ZS and tRNase ZL genes. This raises an interesting question about whether the short and long forms of tRNase Z play differential roles in the cells. It is possible that one is for nuclear tRNA processing, and that the other for the mitochondrial one. Alternatively, one of these enzymes might have an additional role for some RNA metabolism. The fact that tRNase ZL is &#x0223c;2-fold larger than tRNase ZS, and has the extra N-terminal region that is dispensable for the RNA cleaving catalytic reaction, implies that it is the long form that might have the additional role.</p><p>The long form of tRNase Z has the following interesting properties. RNAi knockdown experiments against the <italic>C.elegans</italic> tRNase ZL gene have shown that tRNase ZL plays a role in germline proliferation and that the down-regulation of the tRNase ZL gene results in sterility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh774c14">14</xref>). On the other hand, over-expression of human tRNase ZL in HeLa cells causes a delay in G2-M progression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh774c15">15</xref>). In addition, the human enzyme has been shown to interact physically with the &#x003b3;-tubulin complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh774c15">15</xref>).</p><p>The human tRNase ZL gene has been first identified as a candidate prostate cancer susceptibility gene by positional cloning and mutation screening (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh774c1">1</xref>). Two mutations in the human tRNase ZL gene, an insertion&#x0002f;frameshift (1641 ins G) and a missense change (Arg781His), segregate with prostate cancer in two pedigrees (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh774c1">1</xref>). The frameshift mutation results in premature termination after the miscoding of 67 residues. In addition, two common missense changes, Ser217Leu and Ala541Thr, seem to be associated with the occurrence of prostate cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh774c1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh774c16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh774c17">17</xref>).</p><p>Mammalian tRNase ZL can function as a four-base-recognizing RNA cutter (RNase 65) through a relatively stable complex between the enzyme and a 3&#x02032;-truncated tRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh774c18">18</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh774c20">20</xref>). Although little is known about the physiological role and substrate of RNase 65, it has been demonstrated that the 3&#x02032;-truncated tRNA directs substrate specificity via four base pairings. In addition, the RNase 65 activity has led us to develop a technique to cleave any RNA specifically at any site by mammalian tRNase ZL under the direction of small guide RNA (sgRNA) <italic>in vivo</italic> as well as <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh774c21">21</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh774c24">24</xref>).</p><p>To elucidate possible differential roles and functions between tRNase ZL and tRNase ZS, we started by investigating whether the long and short forms have different preferences for RNA substrates. Here we demonstrate that indeed they have different substrate specificities and that the differences are attributed to the N-terminal half of tRNase ZL. Furthermore, we show that the optimal concentrations of NaCl, MgCl<sub>2</sub> and MnCl<sub>2</sub> for the <italic>in vitro</italic> pre-tRNA processing differ between tRNase ZSs and tRNase ZLs.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Preparation of various tRNase Z proteins</title><p>Pig tRNase ZL was intensively fractionated from liver through several column chromatography procedures and further purified by glycerol gradient ultracentrifugation as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh774c25">25</xref>).</p><p>The recombinant human tRNase ZL and tRNase ZS, and the N-terminal (residues 1&#x02013;480) and C-terminal (residues 482&#x02013;826) half-domains of human tRNase ZL were over-expressed from the pTYB11 expression plasmids (New England BioLabs) in <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> and purified with chitin beads as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh774c3">3</xref>).

The <italic>K</italic><sub>m</sub> values for cleavage of R-6TUUU by human and yeast tRNase ZL were 0.39 and 0.74 &#x003bc;M, respectively, which were much lower than those by human (1.28 &#x003bc;M) and <italic>T.maritima</italic> (2.40 &#x003bc;M) tRNase ZSs (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="gkh774tb2">2</xref>). The <italic>K</italic><sub>m</sub> value (2.40 &#x003bc;M) for cleavage of R-6TUUU by the <italic>T.maritima</italic> enzyme was &#x0223c;1.5-fold higher than that (1.58 &#x003bc;M) for pre-tRNA<sup>Arg</sup>(CCA) cleavage (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="gkh774tb2">2</xref>). Because <italic>T.maritima</italic> tRNase ZS appears to have a CCA binding domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh774c5">5</xref>), the higher value for the R-6TUUU cleavage could be due to the lack of the <sup>74</sup>CCA<sup>76</sup> sequence in the substrate.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>DISCUSSION</title><sec><title>A functional role of the N-terminal half of tRNase ZL</title><p>We found out that the optimal concentrations of NaCl, MgCl<sub>2</sub> and MnCl<sub>2</sub> for the <italic>in vitro</italic> pre-tRNA processing differ between tRNase ZSs and tRNase ZLs (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh774f3">3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh774f4">4</xref>). With respect to the major structural difference between tRNase ZL and tRNase ZS, tRNase ZL has the extra N-terminal domain composed of &#x0223c;500 amino acids, which contains the pseudo-histidine motif (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh774c1">1</xref>) and has a similarity in some degree to the C-terminal domain and tRNase ZS (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh774f1">1</xref>). The present observation that only the long forms of tRNase Z can cleave the RNA complexes (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh774f6">6</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh774f7">7</xref>) implies that the N-terminal half has an additional important role in enzyme&#x02013;substrate interactions.</p><p>All of the tRNase ZSs did not cleave the micro-pre-tRNA at all, and the C-terminal domain of human tRNase ZL cleaved it inefficiently as compared with the full-length human tRNase ZL (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh774f5">5</xref>). This would be probably because the substrate&#x02013;enzyme interaction is weakened due to the lack of the D-stem&#x02013;loop and the anticodon&#x02013;stem&#x02013;loop in the substrate. The N-terminal half of tRNase ZL would be involved in the interaction with the substrate at least through the T-stem&#x02013;loop and the acceptor stem, and would strengthen this interaction. This would allow tRNase ZL to recognize and to cleave the micro-pre-tRNA easily.</p><p>This idea is supported by previous (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh774c26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh774c27">27</xref>) and present kinetic experiments. The <italic>K</italic><sub>m</sub> values for cleavages of full-length pre-tRNAs<sup>Arg</sup> by pig tRNase ZL were quantitated to be &#x0223c;0.6 &#x003bc;M regardless of the presence of a 5&#x02032; leader, and the <italic>K</italic><sub>m</sub> values for cleavage of the full-length pre-tRNA<sup>Arg</sup> R-6TUUU by human and yeast tRNase ZLs were 0.39 and 0.74 &#x003bc;M (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="gkh774tb2">2</xref>). On the other hand, the <italic>K</italic><sub>m</sub> values for cleavages of full-length pre-tRNAs<sup>Arg</sup> by human and <italic>T.maritima</italic> tRNase ZSs were 1.3&#x02013;2.4 &#x003bc;M (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="gkh774tb2">2</xref>). About 3-fold lower <italic>K</italic><sub>m</sub> values for tRNase ZL indicate that its N-terminal half is indeed important for stronger recognition of the substrates. The <italic>K</italic><sub>m</sub> value for cleavage of the micro-pre-tRNA<sup>Arg</sup> R-ATM5 by pig tRNase ZL was 0.57 &#x003bc;M, which was the same as the <italic>K</italic><sub>m</sub> value for cleavage of the full-length pre-tRNAs<sup>Arg</sup> R-UUU (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="gkh774tb2">2</xref>). This is consistent with the observation that pig tRNase ZL has a strong activity against the micro-pre-tRNA<sup>Arg</sup> (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="gkh774tb1">1</xref>).</p><p>In the above context, we would also be able to explain why the RNase 65 activity was observed only with respect to tRNase ZL (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh774f6">6</xref>B). The discontinuous acceptor stem in the complex between the target RNA and the 3&#x02032;-truncated tRNA, and the 5&#x02032; extra nucleotides in the target before the 4 nt recognition sequence (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh774f6">6</xref>A) would disturb the enzyme&#x02013;substrate interaction. These anomalies would make it difficult for the tRNase ZS to recognize the RNA complex even though the complex has the D-stem&#x02013;loop and the anticodon&#x02013;stem&#x02013;loop. In contrast, tRNase ZL can recognize the substrate probably with the help of the N-terminal half-domain.</p><p>This interpretation would also hold for the interaction of tRNase Z with the complex between the target RNA and the hook RNA. This complex has an additional anomaly in that it does not contain the D-stem&#x02013;loop and the anticodon&#x02013;stem&#x02013;loop (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh774f7">7</xref>A). tRNase ZS would have more difficulty in substrate recognition, while, thanks to the N-terminal half, tRNase ZL would be able to endure even such a difficulty.</p><p>The N-terminal half-domain, when added to the reactions, did not cause stronger interactions of human or <italic>T.maritima</italic> tRNase ZS or the C-terminal half with the micro-pre-tRNA or the RNA complexes, while <italic>E.coli</italic> tRNase ZS became very weakly active against the micro-pre-tRNA in the presence of the N-terminal half. These observations suggest that the covalent connection between the N- and C-terminal half-domains is important but not necessarily prerequisite for the functional role of the N-terminal half.</p><p>The Walker A motif (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh774c28">28</xref>) found in the N-terminal domain of human tRNase ZL (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh774f1">1</xref>A) might be involved in this N-terminal function possibly through binding to the 5&#x02032; nucleotide triphosphate of pre-tRNA. The much lower activities of yeast tRNase ZL against the micro-pre-tRNA and the RNA complexes (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="gkh774tb1">1</xref>) may be due to the lack of this motif in the yeast enzyme. Consistently, the <italic>K</italic><sub>m</sub> value for the R-6TUUU cleavage by yeast tRNase ZL is &#x0223c;1.9- and &#x0223c;1.3-fold higher than those by the human and pig enzymes, respectively (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="gkh774tb2">2</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Other roles of tRNase ZL than the tRNA 3&#x02032; processing</title><p>RNAi knockdown of the tRNase ZL gene in <italic>C.elegans</italic> causes slow growth and sterility, which results from a drastic reduction in germline proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh774c14">14</xref>). The nematode tRNase ZL is also needed for the germline over-proliferation phenotypes observed in three different alleles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh774c14">14</xref>). In addition, a reduction of tRNase ZL suppresses the multivulva phenotype resulting from two different activating mutations in <italic>ras</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh774c14">14</xref>). These phenomena would be simply explained through the role of tRNase ZL in the tRNA 3&#x02032; processing. Because a large number of tRNA molecules are required for early embryogenesis, if a sufficient amount of tRNase ZL that is essential for tRNA biosynthesis is not generated in the germline cells, their proliferations would be severely injured. Indeed, an enormous number of tRNase ZL molecules exist in each <italic>Xenopus laevis</italic> oocyte (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh774c7">7</xref>). This number has been estimated to be &#x0223c;5 &#x000d7; 10<sup>11</sup> molecules, which is comparable to &#x0223c;5 &#x000d7; 10<sup>12</sup> for the number of tRNA molecules.</p><p>It has been shown that in HeLa cells, tRNase ZL physically interacts with the &#x003b3;-tubulin complex, suggesting that tRNase ZL might play a role in mitosis as a modulator of centrosome assembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh774c15">15</xref>). Consistently, cells over-expressing tRNase ZL undergo a delay in cell cycle progression during the G<sub>2</sub> phase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh774c15">15</xref>). In contrast to the <italic>C.elegans</italic> case, the pre-tRNA cleaving activity of tRNase ZL would not be directly related to this phenomenon. Nothing is known about how tRNase ZL interacts with the &#x003b3;-tubulin complex and how this enzyme is involved in mitosis. <italic>In vitro</italic> binding assays for the interactions between &#x003b3;-tubulin and various recombinant tRNase ZL fragments would elucidate whether the modulator function is attributed to the N-terminal half region, which is not essential for the enzymatic activity.</p><p>We have demonstrated that tRNase ZL shows the RNase 65 activity <italic>in vitro</italic> in the presence of 3&#x02032;-truncated tRNAs, and that these RNAs exist ubiquitously in mammalian cell extracts so far tested (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh774c18">18</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh774c20">20</xref>). This suggests that tRNase ZL works as 4 nt RNA cutters in other cellular RNA metabolisms. The fact that tRNase ZL can also act as a different type of 4 nt RNA cutter <italic>in vitro</italic> under the direction of hook RNA implies that this cutter could work in the cells if there exists hook RNA. Recently, a huge number of miRNAs that are believed to work as translational regulators have been discovered (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh774c29">29</xref>). The length of miRNAs is &#x0223c;21&#x02013;23 nt, which is similar to the length of hook RNA, suggesting that some of the miRNAs could work as hook RNAs that direct cellular RNA cleavage by endogenous tRNase ZL. Other unidentified small RNAs might also work as sgRNAs in the cells.</p></sec><sec><title>tRNase ZL together with sgRNA can be used as a useful molecular biology tool</title><p>We have shown that mammalian tRNase ZL can cleave any RNA at any desired site <italic>in vitro</italic> under the direction of sgRNA, which includes 5&#x02032; half tRNA and heptamer RNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh774c21">21</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh774c24">24</xref>). We have also examined the efficacy of this specific RNA targeting method in the living cells by introducing sgRNAs either as their expression plasmids or as 2&#x02032;-<italic>O</italic>-methyl RNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh774c24">24</xref>). The expressions of the exogenous reporter genes for <italic>E.coli</italic> chloramphenicol acetyltransferase and firefly luciferase were down-regulated by appropriately designed sgRNAs in human and dog culture cells, and the down-regulation continued for at least 48 h. A 2&#x02032;-<italic>O</italic>-methyl heptamer for targeting the endogenous Bcl-2 mRNA has been also shown to work in Sarcoma 180 cells.</p><p>Although these results have indicated that indeed appropriate sgRNAs can repress the targeted gene expressions, no direct evidence exists, yet, demonstrating that the down-regulation is due to specific mRNA cleavage by endogenous tRNase ZL and not due to simple antisense effects or other different mechanisms. We would be able to examine directly whether the <italic>in vivo</italic> down-regulation is really due to tRNase ZL cleavage by knocking-down either tRNase ZL or tRNase ZS gene expression by RNAi. From the present results which show that tRNase ZL and not tRNase ZS can cleave RNA complexes, we can predict that only when the tRNase ZL gene expression is repressed is the down-regulation by sgRNAs abolished.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="display-objects"><title>Figures and Tables</title><fig id="gkh774f1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p> Structures of tRNase ZS and tRNase ZL.
