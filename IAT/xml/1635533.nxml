They investigated this transcriptional response in the context of two conserved pathways involved in pathogen defense: the PMK-1 p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (p38 MAPK) pathway and the DAF-2&#x02013;DAF-16 insulin-signaling pathway. Specifically, the authors found that the p38 MAPK pathway plays a critical role in the infection-induced expression of secreted immune response genes. These genes include C-type lectins, lysozymes, and antimicrobial peptides that fight off infection in many species. In contrast, they found that the DAF-16 pathway is not required for immune response gene expression and may regulate immunity as part of a general stress response that functions in parallel to p38 MAPK. In addition, the authors observed that p38 MAPK contributes to the enhanced longevity of <italic>daf-2</italic> mutants, implicating p38 MAPK signaling in the regulation of longevity, possibly through its role in immunity.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="15"/></counts><custom-meta-wrap><custom-meta><meta-name>citation</meta-name><meta-value>Troemel ER, Chu SW, Reinke V, Lee SS, Ausubel FM, et al.

A forward genetic screen for immunocompromised mutants demonstrated a requirement for a conserved p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway in <named-content content-type="genus-species">C. elegans</named-content> immunity &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020183-b005">5</xref>&#x0005d;. This screen yielded mutants defective in NSY-1, a MAPK kinase kinase (MAPKKK) and in SEK-1, a MAPK kinase (MAPKK). These proteins signal via the PMK-1 p38 MAPK, as <italic>pmk-1</italic> mutants are also sensitive to pathogen killing, and the PMK-1 protein lacks activating phosphorylation in <italic>nsy-1</italic> and <italic>sek-1</italic> mutants. In mice, genetic analysis has recently demonstrated a similar role for ASK1, the mammalian NSY-1 homolog, in immunity &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020183-b006">6</xref>&#x0005d;. ASK1 is required to activate p38 MAPK and downstream immune effectors in response to a bacterial PAMP, lipopolysaccharide. Thus, the NSY-1/SEK-1/PMK-1 cassette is an evolutionarily conserved module used in defense against pathogenic attack. However, the downstream effectors of <named-content content-type="genus-species">C. elegans</named-content> p38 MAPK signaling that promote pathogen resistance have not been identified.</p><p>In addition to the p38 MAPK pathway, another conserved pathway has been shown to regulate <named-content content-type="genus-species">C. elegans</named-content> innate immunity. The DAF-2 insulin/insulin-like growth factor receptor is a tyrosine kinase that was originally identified for its role in regulating entry into an alternative larval stage called dauer, and has subsequently been shown to have dramatic effects on lifespan and stress resistance &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020183-b007">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020183-b009">9</xref>&#x0005d;.

This resistance requires DAF-16, since the double-mutant <italic>daf-2;daf-16</italic> is not resistant to killing. Extensive microarray analysis has identified candidate downstream effectors of DAF-16 &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020183-b013">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020183-b014">14</xref>&#x0005d;, including the lysozyme <italic>lys-7,</italic> which is a presumptive antimicrobial gene. <italic>lys-7</italic> had previously been identified in an analysis of the inducible defense response in <named-content content-type="genus-species">C. elegans</named-content> &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020183-b015">15</xref>&#x0005d;.

Nothing is known about the interrelationship between the DAF-16 pathway and the PMK-1 p38 MAPK pathway that ultimately results in an immune response.</p><p> In addition to the lysozymes described above, a limited number of other candidate <named-content content-type="genus-species">C. elegans</named-content> immune effectors have been identified. Seven <named-content content-type="genus-species">S. marcescens</named-content>&#x02013;induced genes were identified using filter microarray analysis of a subset of the genome; three of these genes had homology to C-type lectins, which have recently been shown to have antibacterial activity and are induced by bacterial exposure in mice &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020183-b016">16</xref>&#x0005d;, and one gene had a CUB-like domain (formerly known as DUF141&#x02014;domain of unknown function 141). A separate analysis of genes induced by the pathogenic fungus <named-content content-type="genus-species">Drechmeria coniospora</named-content> using filter microarrays identified several neuropeptide-like genes, including one with demonstrated antifungal activity &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020183-b017">17</xref>&#x0005d;. Several other <named-content content-type="genus-species">C. elegans</named-content> genes have been proposed to function in pathogen defense based on their homology with known antimicrobials, such as <named-content content-type="genus-species">Ascaris suum</named-content> antibacterial factor &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020183-b018">18</xref>&#x0005d; and amoebapore-like enzymes &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020183-b019">19</xref>&#x0005d;, including one with antibacterial activity that is upregulated by DAF-16. Programmed cell death in the germline has been shown to be induced by <named-content content-type="genus-species">Salmonella enterica</named-content> infection in a PMK-1&#x02013;dependent manner, but the significance of this for immunity effector mechanisms is not clear &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020183-b020">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020183-b021">21</xref>&#x0005d;.

A full-genome analysis of the response to the pathogen <named-content content-type="genus-species">Microbacterium nematophilum</named-content> revealed a set of induced genes, including C-type lectins, lysozymes, and CUB-like genes &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020183-b022">22</xref>&#x0005d;.

However, an analysis of the transcriptional response to <named-content content-type="genus-species">P. aeruginosa</named-content> has not been described, and little is known about which pathways mediate the transcriptional response to pathogen attack.</p><p>The DAF-2&#x02013;DAF-16 pathway has a role in both immunity and longevity. Functional analysis of presumptive antibacterial genes upregulated by DAF-16 indicated that some of these genes contribute to the increased lifespan of <italic>daf-2</italic> mutants &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020183-b013">13</xref>&#x0005d;.

Although these results suggest an important role for the innate immune response in regulating longevity, the role of immunity in determining lifespan is just beginning to be explored.</p><p>Here we describe genetic, genomic, and functional analyses of the PMK-1 and DAF-2&#x02013;DAF-16 pathways. We integrate these results with a full-genome analysis of the response to pathogen infection to define how these pathways act in concert to regulate immunity and longevity. Our studies indicate that loss-of-function mutants in the PMK-1 pathway suppress the enhanced pathogen resistance to <named-content content-type="genus-species">P. aeruginosa</named-content> of <italic>daf-2</italic> mutants, suggesting that <italic>pmk-1</italic> is either downstream or in parallel to <italic>daf-2.</italic> Full-genome expression analysis suggests that the PMK-1 pathway acts in parallel to DAF-16, the key transcription factor downstream of DAF-2. PMK-1 controls expression of a suite of genes encoding secreted products that may act as antimicrobial genes and/or in cell&#x02013;cell communication to promote immunity. We identified many of these same genes in a full-genome analysis of the <named-content content-type="genus-species">C. elegans</named-content> transcriptional response to <italic>P. aeruginosa.</italic> Using quantitative reverse transcription PCR (qRT-PCR) we found that PMK-1 mediates both basal and inducible expression of many infection response genes, while DAF-16 does not. In addition, we found that an apparent third immune pathway activated by <named-content content-type="genus-species">P. aeruginosa</named-content> infection functions independently of PMK-1 and DAF-16. Finally, consistent with immunity being an important determinant of longevity, we show that PMK-1 contributes to increased lifespan in <italic>daf-2</italic>, which identifies the PMK-1 p38 MAPK cassette as a regulator of lifespan.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>The PMK-1 p38 MAPK Cassette Is Required for the Enhanced Resistance to Pathogens of <italic>daf-2</italic> Mutants</title><p>To examine the interaction between the PMK-1 p38 MAPK pathway and the DAF-2&#x02013;DAF-16 insulin-signaling pathway, we constructed double mutants and analyzed their resistance to the pathogenic <named-content content-type="genus-species">P. aeruginosa</named-content> strain, PA14.

How does the PMK-1 pathway interact with the DAF-2&#x02013;DAF-16 pathway? One possibility is that PMK-1 acts upstream of DAF-16, and regulates its transcriptional activity. Since <italic>pmk-1</italic> mutants are immunodeficient, while <italic>daf-16</italic> mutants are not, PMK-1 cannot rely solely on DAF-16, but DAF-16 might comprise one pathway downstream of PMK-1. If DAF-16 were one of the transcription factors that acts downstream of PMK-1, then one would expect to see similar genes regulated by PMK-1 and DAF-16. To address this possibility, we performed transcriptional profiling of PMK-1 to identify its downstream effectors and compare these with effectors downstream of DAF-16. In order to identify genes regulated by PMK-1, we used full-genome <named-content content-type="genus-species">C. elegans</named-content> oligonucleotide microarrays (GeneChips) from Affymetrix to compare <italic>daf-2(e1368)</italic> and <italic>daf-2(e1368);pmk-1(km25)</italic> animals feeding on <named-content content-type="genus-species">E. coli</named-content> OP50 harvested at the late larval/young adult stage.

The two most highly represented classes of PMK-1&#x02013;upregulated genes were genes with a CUB-like domain and genes with homology to ShK toxins. There was a preponderance of secreted genes among PMK-1&#x02013;regulated genes; based on Wormbase annotation, 31 of the top 36 genes upregulated by PMK-1 correspond to genes whose protein products are predicted to be secreted (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen-0020183-t001">Table 1</xref>).

However, we found significant overlap between PMK-1&#x02013;upregulated genes and DAF-16&#x02013;downregulated genes (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref> for calculation of overlap expected by chance). Thirteen of the PMK-1&#x02013;upregulated genes were considered to be downregulated by DAF-16 in Murphy et al. microarrays, whereas only one gene would be expected by chance. Similarly, 28 PMK-1&#x02013;upregulated genes were also considered to be downregulated by DAF-16 in McElwee et al. microarrays, whereas only about four genes would be expected by chance.</p><p>In order to confirm this comparative analysis that was based on microarray experiments done in different labs and with different microarray platforms, we also generated our own microarray data using Affymetrix GeneChips.

Again, we found very little overlap between PMK-1&#x02013;upregulated genes and DAF-16&#x02013;upregulated genes. Only five genes were upregulated by both PMK-1 and DAF-16 (84 genes upregulated by DAF-16), and these genes did not have large fold changes in either comparison. However, we found significant overlap between genes predicted to be downregulated by DAF-16 and upregulated by PMK-1, including CUB-like genes. Fourteen genes were found to be both upregulated by PMK-1 and downregulated by DAF-16, and these genes had large fold changes (only two genes would be expected by chance).</p><p>As an independent confirmation of our microarray experiments, we performed qRT-PCR expression analysis of 13 genes identified as being upregulated by PMK-1 in microarray experiments.

This expression analysis confirms our microarray results and indicates that DAF-16 and PMK-1 upregulate mutually exclusive sets of genes to promote immunity. We also confirmed that these 13 genes were induced by PMK-1 in a wild-type background (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen-0020183-sg001">Figure S1</xref>). Therefore, many of the genes identified by microarrays as upregulated by PMK-1 in a <italic>daf-2</italic> background are also likely to be upregulated in a wild-type background. Because PMK-1&#x02013;upregulated genes in general were not more highly expressed in <italic>daf-2</italic> mutants compared to wild-type (data not shown), we support a model where PMK-1 acts in parallel to both DAF-2 and DAF-16, its downstream transcription factor.</p><p>As a further examination of whether PMK-1 and DAF-16 might upregulate genes in common, we performed qRT-PCR on genes upregulated by DAF-16, as identified in our microarrays, to determine whether PMK-1 might also upregulate them.

The relative contributions of PMK-1 and DAF-16 to immunity are illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020183-g006">Figure 6</xref>.</p><p>The observation that DAF-16 and PMK-1 act in parallel is somewhat surprising, as DAF-16 and PMK-1 superficially appear to act in similar ways.

However, there are important differences between the functions of these genes. PMK-1 is critical for immunity in both a <italic>daf-2</italic> and a wild-type background. In contrast, while DAF-16 is critical for the enhanced immunity of <italic>daf-2</italic> mutants, it is not required for immunity in a wild-type background. Under well-fed conditions on <named-content content-type="genus-species">E. coli</named-content> in a wild-type background, DAF-16 is mostly inactive in the cytoplasm, due to repression from DAF-2 &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020183-b031">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020183-b032">32</xref>&#x0005d;.

We have shown that PMK-1 functions in a specific immune response pathway, while DAF-2&#x02013;DAF-16 appears to play a more general, nonspecific role.

If the CUB-like genes function to promote immunity, then DAF-16 would act to dampen this immune response.

Enrichment for mRNA was carried out using oligo-dT beads (Ambion, http://www.ambion.com), and at least 10 &#x003bc;g of polyA RNA was isolated. Worm propagation, harvesting, and RNA isolation was carried out independently for each of the three microarray experiments.</p></sec><sec id="s4h"><title>Microarray analysis for <italic>sek-1</italic> studies (cDNA microarrays).</title><p>Fluorescence-labeled cDNA probes for DNA microarray hybridization were prepared from 5 &#x003bc;g of mRNA as described &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020183-b052">52</xref>&#x0005d;. <italic>glp-4</italic> cDNA was labeled with Cy5 and compared to <italic>glp-4;sek-1</italic> cDNA labeled with Cy3. <named-content content-type="genus-species">C. elegans</named-content> whole-genome microarrays were used for hybridization as described &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020183-b053">53</xref>&#x0005d;.

Therefore, the expected overlap by chance would be about 1 gene &#x0005b;(0.0043 &#x000d7; 231 genes) &#x0003d; 1.032 genes&#x0005d;.</p></sec><sec id="s4j"><title>Quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) analysis.</title><p>Animals were treated as described for samples used in microarray analysis.

PMK-1 controls basal levels of pathogen response genes on <named-content content-type="genus-species">E. coli</named-content> and also mediates induction of these genes upon infection. In contrast, DAF-16 controls a separate group of immune genes and does not mediate the infection response, but does turn down expression of some pathogen-induced genes. Certain pathogen response genes are induced independently of PMK-1 or DAF-16, indicating the existence of a third pathway. PMK-1 is required for the enhanced pathogen resistance of <italic>daf-2</italic> mutants because it is the predominant pathway contributing to immunity.
