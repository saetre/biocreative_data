The electron transport chain (ETC), embedded within the inner membrane of the mitochondria, is the major producer of reactive oxygen species (ROS), which are presumed to be the primary agent for cell damage and premature apoptosis, affecting aging and longevity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005836-Boveris1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005836-Wallace1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>. The primary intermediate responsible for producing the ROS superoxide is ubisemiquinone, the coenzyme Q (CoQ) radical produced in complexes I, II and III of the ETC <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005836-Turrens1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>. Reducing the production of ubisemiquinone in the ETC has been shown to reduce free radical levels and prolong life span in animals <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005836-Aguilaniu2">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005836-Liu1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>The mechanism by which ROS affect aging and longevity has recently come under scrutiny (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005836-Allen1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005836-Cutler1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>). For years the paradigm of aging (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005836-Barja1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005836-Coskun1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>) has predicted that over time ROS leakage leads to accumulation of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) mutations and oxidative damage to the cell. Over the lifespan of an individual, the damage may then lead to premature cell death, followed by organ and tissue failure, which are characteristics of aging and associated degenerative disorders. The paradigm concludes that to avoid cumulative damage over time and increase longevity, antioxidants must be taken to combat oxidative stress on cell components.</p><p>Recent studies indicate that these basic assumptions should be revisited. It has been shown that free radical leakage fluctuates according to the signals that ROS themselves produce <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005836-Allen1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005836-Lane1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>. Further, antioxidants have been shown not to prolong lifespan (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005836-Cutler1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005836-Barja1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>). Together, the ROS fluctuations and the lack of an antioxidant effect on longevity indicate that the role of free radicals in aging and longevity is more complex than previously thought.</p><p>A theory of aging that accounts for a signaling role for endogenous free radicals in maintaining the metabolic status of the cell has been proposed <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005836-Allen1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>, balancing their role in cellular damage. The underlying principles of this theory of aging include: 1) ROS leakage produces mtDNA mutations; 2) ROS produced by ailing mitochondria also signals cellular apoptosis activities; 3) when a threshold of both ailing mitochondria and ROS signals is reached, the cell prematurely commits to apoptosis followed by organ and tissue failure.</p><p>Studies have shown that when a given mutation is found in different species it has varying effects based on the comparative rate of ROS leakage in the species <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005836-Wright1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>. The threshold of ROS signal needed for the cell to commit apoptosis depends on the rate at which ROS are produced from the mitochondria. Intuition might suggest that the threshold of ROS signal needed for the cell to commit to apoptosis is static. However, it appears to be dependent upon the rate of ROS production from the mitochondria, exhibiting a tight correlation between mutations and a ROS-signal apoptotic threshold <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005836-Trifunovic1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Whether the role of free radicals in aging and longevity involves the toxicity of ROS over time or the important signaling role of ROS in programmed cell death, it is important that studies of longevity turn attention toward mechanisms by which ROS is produced in the respiratory chain of the mitochondria, and how leakage affects the cell and might be reduced.</p><p>In this regard, it is also essential to come to an understanding of these mechanisms in the context of caloric intake, since electron input to the ETC may alter ROS production <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005836-Wallace1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>. It has been proposed that as mitochondria function in decreased phosphorylating modes, the ETC remains in a more reduced state (maximally occupied with electrons) for longer time periods, increasing the production of ubisemiquinone and ROS, thereby decreasing longevity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005836-Wallace1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005836-Aguilaniu2">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005836-Korshunov1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>. The major contributor toward a more reduced state is excessive calorie consumption (increased electron input), but other factors can exacerbate the problem as well. For example, the ETC may remain more reduced because of inhibition or dysfunction of ATP production via oxidative phosphorylation, blocking the electron flow of the respiratory chain. Reduced ADP, caused by a lack of physical exercise (during which ADP is not present because ATP is not being used), may also inhibit the turning over of electrons and keep the ETC more reduced. As the electron flow is inhibited, not only do more reactive electrons accumulate, but oxygen levels increase as well. This may increase the probability that backed up electrons and oxygen will react and produce free radicals.</p><p>The electron transport chain is composed of protein complexes whose individual protein subunits are encoded in either nuclear or mitochondrial DNA. Nonsynonymous single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in any of the genes encoding ETC subunits could alter the quality of electron flow or affect CoQ binding sites, and subsequently affect ROS production, aging and longevity.</p><p>Mitochondria have maintained a core set of genes that encode essential proteins in the ETC. Nonsynonymous mutations in these genes have the potential to affect the ETC, ROS production and longevity in a way that is dependent upon calorie restriction and/or calorie over-consumption. Throughout the last 150 years there have been dramatic extremes in per capita caloric intake. For example, during the Great Depression (1920&#x02013;1940) many individuals throughout North America were under extremely restricted caloric intake. In more recent decades there has been an increase in caloric intake toward the other extreme, particularly in North America. If there is a relationship between the redox state of the ETC, longevity, mtDNA mutations and extremes of caloric intake, it could be demonstrated by an analysis of historical longevity within mtDNA haplogroups during extended and continental periods of calorie reduction and over-consumption.</p><p>The human population is subdivided into mitochondrial haplogroups. Haplogroups are distinguished by a unique set of mitochondrial SNPs, the nonsynonymous of which are of interest in relationship to their potential effect on the mitochondrial respiratory chain and longevity. Many studies have demonstrated the association of certain mtDNA haplogroups with increased longevity (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005836-DeBenedictis1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005836-Dato1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>). We chose to focus on haplogroup H, which is one of the more recent haplogroups, but also now the most prevalent European mtDNA haplogroup, and compare historical longevity in closely related haplogroup U individuals under extremes of caloric intake.</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005836-g001">Figure 1</xref> shows the haplogroup relationship with regard to mtDNA mutations between H and U.

This is accomplished by identifying individuals with haplotype H and U from two genetic genealogy databases and collecting longevity information about their maternally related ancestors from the pedigrees in those databases. In addition, many of the ancestors were then found in a family history database, and longevity information was gathered about their extended maternal relatives who share their maternally inherited haplogroups H and U. The longevity data for haplogroups H and U were compared in cohorts of 20 year increments, with 1920&#x02013;40 longevity representing historical calorie restriction, and 1960&#x02013;80 and 1980-present representing caloric over-consumption.</p><p>Next, we examined the biochemical shift that the polymorphism cytbI7T produces in cytb, protein complex III, and the ETC overall. We then estimate selective pressure on amino acid properties throughout mammalian evolution, particularly at site 7 in cytb, to gain a historical evolutionarily context of this region and a better perspective on how this recent human polymorphism may change the mitochondrial system. Finally, we correlate these data and present a mechanism by which cytbI7T may affect ETC efficiency and ROS production by complex III, and consequently longevity in haplogroup H during a restricted dietary environment compared to an environment of excessive caloric intake.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Haplotype and Longevity Data Collection</title><p>The haplotypes and life spans of individuals who lived between 1870 and the present were collected from Family Tree DNA (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.familytreeDNA.com">http://www.familytreeDNA.com</ext-link>) and the Sorenson Molecular Genealogy Foundation (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.smgf.org">http://www.smgf.org</ext-link>).

Finally, the individuals were included only if they died at or after the age of 60.

This adaptation is expressed in terms of amino acid property changes. TreeSAAP measures the physicochemical magnitude of amino acid substitutions and indicates which amino acid properties have likely been affected by natural selection during the evolutionary process.</p><p>As the first step, we modified the use of TreeSAAP, allowing the program to analyze the physiochemical changes produced by a single amino acid substitution <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005836-Ebbert1">&#x0005b;25&#x0005d;</xref>. TreeSAAP was thus used to detect the radical physicochemical shifts that are produced by a mutation substituting a threonine for an isoleucine at site 7 in cytb of mitochondrial complex III. TreeSAAP was implemented by grouping changes into one of eight magnitude categories, 1 being the most conservative and 8 being the most radical. In this study we chose to focus on amino acid property changes of category 6, 7, and 8 because they unambiguously indicate a significant change in the protein <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005836-McClellan2">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>In the second step, the entire protein-coding portion of the mitochondrial genome (13 complete coding sequences) was collected for 107 mammalian species, including sequences from all major mammalian lineages, from GenBank (Supplementary <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0005836.s002">Table S1</xref>). These sequences were aligned and used for phylogenetic analysis (Supplementary <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0005836.s001">Figure S1</xref>).

Specifically, the property changes that TreeSAAP detected in step 1 of the analysis were correlated with the same properties TreeSAAP detected to be under natural selection throughout mammalian evolution. The overall purpose of this second step is to establish context for properly interpreting the results of step one. By estimating the naturally occurring pattern of adaptation, the effects of SNPs may be compared to the location and effects of extant genetic variation and historical adaptations within the broader taxonomic group. When a SNP fails to share characteristics with the historical adaptations of the group, that SNP is more likely have a detrimental effect. Conversely, if a SNP has much in common with the adaptations of the group, that SNP may have a similar adaptive effect <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005836-Chamala1">&#x0005b;26&#x0005d;</xref>.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Results</title><sec id="s3a"><title>Difference in Longevity between H and U</title><p>The mean age at death was calculated for each time period cohort of individuals.

In general, the amino acid property &#x0201c;Surrounding Hydrophobicity&#x0201d; refers to the tendency for the region around the amino acid site in question to interact with water. In the case of cytbI7T, there is a radical decrease of magnitude 8 in this property, indicating that the region surrounding site 7 becomes less hydrophobic and more hydrophilic by introducing a threonine instead of an isoleucine. This biochemical shift is likely the result of the hydroxyl group on the R-group of threonine that may easily interact with water molecules. Isoleucine is hydrophobic and thus lacks this ability. Hydrophobicity is similar to the property &#x0201c;Hydropathy&#x0201d;, which also decreases due to the polymorphism I7T.</p><p>&#x0201c;Equilibrium Constant&#x0201d; deals with the ability of any ionizable functional group of the residue to dissociate and make an ion <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005836-Gromiha1">&#x0005b;27&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005836-Gromiha2">&#x0005b;29&#x0005d;</xref>. TreeSAAP indicates that cytbI7T increases this property by a moderately radical (magnitude 6) change. An increased equilibrium constant for the ionization of COOH would indicate a more product-driven reaction. This would, as in the other properties, make the region more water-soluble and hydrophilic. As will be noted, this may be of greatest importance regarding reduced ROS production and increased longevity during calorie restriction.</p><p>The other four properties relate to the level of compactness in the region. The amino acid properties &#x0201c;Average Number of Surrounding Residues&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;Buriedness&#x0201d; measure how compact and buried the amino acid site is. TreeSAAP indicated that cytbI7T decreases both of these properties with a magnitude 6 change. With a decrease in these properties, we can imagine a region around site 7 that is more open and free to interact (as opposed to compact).</p><p>This conclusion is further supported by the decrease in the amino acid property &#x0201c;Long-range non-bonded energy&#x0201d; resulting from cytbI7T. This property describes the interactions between molecules that are not directly in contact with one another (such as Van der Waals interactions), affecting the stability of molecules involved. It has been shown that the structures in globular proteins are influenced not only by local, bonding interactions, but also by long-range interactions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005836-Gromiha2">&#x0005b;29&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005836-Gromiha3">&#x0005b;30&#x0005d;</xref>. TreeSAAP indicated a radical decrease in this property of magnitude 6. A decrease in &#x0201c;Long-range non-bonded energy&#x0201d; indicates a decrease in stability in this residue and surrounding residues, further suggesting that the region around site 7 is more open, less globular, and less compact due to this polymorphism.</p><p>The solvent accessible surface of a protein is the region where solvent and solutes interact with the protein <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005836-Novotny1">&#x0005b;31&#x0005d;</xref>.

Site 7 in cytb, where the polymorphism that distinguishes haplogroup H occurs, are marked in each graph. There are no peaks in any of these graphs at site 7, though there have been naturally occurring radical changes in these properties elsewhere along the sequence. This indicates that the 7 properties affected by cytbI7T have been highly conserved and stable at this site throughout the evolution of these 107 mammalian species.</p><p>TreeSAAP results suggest that the region around site 7 likely was not a site of adaptation in hydrophilicity and compactness throughout mammalian evolution. This result, however, does not preclude positive selection at this site in the human lineage. Threonine was either fixed or maintained at cytb site 7 until a T7I mutation occurred that led to an isoleucine polymorphism in primates. Subsequent primates, including most human mitochondrial haplogroups, still exhibit isoleucine at site 7. Relatively recently, the human substitution cytbI7T occurred, forming haplogroup H. Radical physicochemical shifts in haplogroup H restore the historical pre-primate character state, suggesting that cytbI7T may have a positive effect. Given its location within protein complex III and the radical nature of the physicochemical effect, we are led to conclude that cytbI7T was likely advantageous relative to the precise efficiency of complex III and the respiratory chain that is linked to increased longevity during calorie restriction.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4"><title>Discussion</title><p>The I7T polymorphism analyzed in this study is located in the cytb protein subunit.

The cytbI7T polymorphism (yellow) resides in the center of this water channel.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="pone.0005836.g007"/></fig><p>The cytbI7T polymorphism lies at the heart of this water channel and likely has an impact on the ability of water to replenish the Q<sub>i</sub> site because threonine may bind a water molecule with its hydroxyl group, whereas isoleucine lacks this ability. TreeSAAP indicates that the cytbI7T mutation radically changes seven amino acid properties that have to do with either increasing the hydrophilicity or reducing the compactness in the area. Increasing hydrophilicity and making the area more open and less globular in the cytb N-terminal region, water will likely be more attracted to the shuttle area and reach the Q<sub>i</sub> binding site more easily. This would increase the efficiency of the binding site and the Q-cycle overall, thereby decreasing the time that ubisemiquinone exists at the Q<sub>o</sub> site, on average decreasing ROS production. To corroborate this idea, TreeSAAP showed that these seven amino acid properties have been highly stable and conserved throughout mammalian evolution in the region surrounding the cytb N-terminal region prior to the T7I SNP in the basal primate branch. With the reintroduction of cytbI7T that created the mitochondrial haplogroup H branch of humans, which is most prevalent in European populations, these properties are radically altered and the immediate impact presents itself as an increase in the potential efficiency of the Q-cycle and the ETC overall, resulting in increased longevity.</p><p>The cytbI7T polymorphism may be viewed in the context of caloric intake in order to better understand how a more efficient ETC could affect longevity in haplogroup H individuals. Caloric intake is essentially the ultimate input to the ETC, and the cytbI7T polymorphism may react differently with different levels of input. Haplogroup H individuals have significantly increased longevity during caloric restriction, but are not significantly different from haplogroup U individuals during other time periods, even during recent years of caloric over-consumption. The increased ETC efficiency of the haplogroup H individuals, which cytbI7T seems to be responsible for, is most advantageous during caloric restriction.</p><p>This could be for a variety of reasons. ROS leakage from the mitochondrial ETC is responsible for signaling apoptosis to the cell when the cell meets a certain threshold. An increase in Q-cycle and ETC efficiency, particularly under caloric restriction (sparse electron input), likely lowers the ROS leakage from the mitochondria and prevent more cells in certain tissues from undergoing apoptosis, thus increasing longevity in haplogroup H individuals. As we see no difference in longevity among haplotype H and U individuals during caloric over-consumption, this increased efficiency may not be of any advantage during these time periods because other factors may override the advantage. For example, a potential factor could be that of excessive electron input to the ETC as a result of hyper-calorie intake. Having a highly reduced ETC due to excessive electrons in the system may drastically increase the rate of ROS production, thus swamping the benefit haplogroup H individuals receive from cytbI7T. On the other hand, we suggest that during caloric restriction the benefit from cytbI7T plays a critical role on the precise efficiency of the ETC and increases longevity in haplogroup H as a result.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0005836.s001"><label>Figure S1</label><caption><p>The phylogenetic tree of the 107 mammalian mitochondrial genome sequences (protein-coding portions) used as input for TreeSAAP.</p><p>(4.45 MB EPS)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0005836.s001.eps" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="postscript"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0005836.s002"><label>Table S1</label><caption><p>The GenBank accession numbers for the 107 mammalian cytb sequences used in this study.</p><p>(0.03 MB XLS)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0005836.s002.xls" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="vnd.ms-excel"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="pone.0005836-Pearl1"><label>1</label><citation citation-type="book"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Pearl</surname><given-names>R</given-names></name></person-group><year>1928</year><source>The rate of living</source><publisher-loc>New York</publisher-loc><publisher-name>A.
