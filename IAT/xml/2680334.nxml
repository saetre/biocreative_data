Mammalian Polo-like kinase 1, Plk1, may function as a critical link because it is required for chromosome segregation and establishment of the cleavage plane following anaphase onset. A central spindle&#x02013;localized pool of the RhoGEF Ect2 promotes activation of the small GTPase RhoA, which drives contractile ring assembly at the equatorial cortex. Here, we have investigated how Plk1 promotes the central spindle recruitment of Ect2. Plk1 phosphorylates the noncatalytic N terminus of the RhoGAP HsCyk-4 at the central spindle, creating a phospho-epitope recognized by the BRCA1 C-terminal (BRCT) repeats of Ect2. Failure to phosphorylate HsCyk-4 blocks Ect2 recruitment to the central spindle and the subsequent induction of furrowing. Microtubules, as well as the microtubule-associated protein (MAP) Prc1, facilitate Plk1 phosphorylation of HsCyk-4. Characterization of a phosphomimetic version of HsCyk-4 indicates that Plk1 promotes Ect2 recruitment through multiple targets. Collectively, our data reveal that formation of the HsCyk-4-Ect2 complex is subject to multiple layers of regulation to ensure that RhoA activation occurs between the segregated sister chromatids during anaphase.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><p>The plane of cell division in animal cells is determined by the position of the mitotic spindle during early anaphase, but the molecular signaling that leads to proper formation of the division plane is not fully understood. The actin- and myosin-rich contractile ring, which physically divides a cell in two, localizes to the presumptive division plane through the local activation of a molecular switch protein, RhoA. RhoA is activated by Ect2, which binds to the protein complex centralspindlin found on microtubules in the vicinity of the division plane (the midzone microtubules). One critical component of centralspindlin is Cyk-4, a putative negative regulator of RhoA. Here, we have analyzed the mechanisms that are responsible for targeting the RhoA activator Ect2 to the midzone microtubules. We show that Polo-like kinase 1 (Plk1), in part through the microtubule-associated protein Prc1, phosphorylates Cyk-4. Ect2 binds to phosphorylated Cyk-4 and is then able to activate RhoA and induce proper formation of the contractile ring. Our study therefore has elucidated important details of the signaling cascade in animal cells that ensures proper division-plane formation.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="15"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Cell division requires crosstalk between various cell cycle regulatory proteins and the actomyosin and microtubule cytoskeletons. The small GTPase RhoA lies at the interface between these cytoskeletal systems, and its activation at the equatorial cortex following chromosome segregation is a critical step in the specification of the division plane <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000110-Piekny1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>. RhoA activation leads to a dramatic reorganization of the actomyosin cytoskeleton underneath the plasma membrane to form a contractile network necessary for cell cleavage. The spatial regulation of RhoA activation is largely dictated by the microtubule cytoskeleton, through the combined action of microtubule asters and a set of interpolar microtubule bundles termed the central spindle <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000110-DAvino1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>. The central spindle forms between the divided sister chromatids and acts as a signaling hub, integrating positional and temporal cues to facilitate activation of RhoA at the equatorial cortex <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000110-Glotzer1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>The centralspindlin complex, a heterotetramer consisting of the kinesin-like protein Mklp1 (UniProt Q02241) and the RhoGAP HsCyk-4/MgcRacGAP (hereafter referred to as HsCyk-4 &#x0005b;UniProt Q9H0H5&#x0005d;), is required for assembly of the central spindle <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000110-Mishima1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000110-PavicicKaltenbrunner1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>.

Hence, formation of the Ect2&#x02013;HsCyk-4 complex represents a critical step in cleavage plane specification, linking positional information from microtubules with cortical actomyosin contractility through RhoA activation.

Here, we have examined the mechanism by which Plk1 stimulates association between Ect2 and HsCyk-4 during anaphase to trigger the onset of cytokinesis.

We therefore used this assay to ask if Plk1 activity is required for this association. First, HsCyk-4 association with Ect2-BRCT was analyzed in lysates from HeLa cells synchronously released from a metaphase block. Although only weak association was detected in metaphase, HsCyk-4, as well as its binding partner, Mklp1, were precipitated in abundance when the vast majority of control cells were in anaphase or telophase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000110-g001">Figure 1B</xref>). In contrast, BI-2536 potently inhibited the ability of recombinant Ect2-BRCT to precipitate either HsCyk-4 or Mklp1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000110-g001">Figure 1B</xref>), suggesting that Plk1 regulates complex formation via HsCyk-4. To confirm this result, nocodazole-arrested cells were forced to exit mitosis through application of the Cdk inhibitor purvalanol A.

Cdk1 inhibition led to a dramatic increase in the amount of HsCyk-4 precipitated by Ect2-BRCT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000110-g001">Figure 1C</xref>).

Mutation of any of these four residues alone was insufficient to prevent Plk1-stimulated binding (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000110.s001">Figure S1B</xref>). Therefore, these residues were mutated, in combination, to nonphosphorylatable Ala residues and assayed for Plk1-stimulated association with Ect2. In vitro phosphorylation of HsCyk-4-4A (amino acids 111&#x02013;188) by Plk1 was dramatically reduced, to below 5&#x00025; of the wild-type fragment (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000110.s002">Figure S2B</xref>). Importantly, mutation of these four residues effectively disrupted the Plk1-mediated stimulation of HsCyk-4&#x02013;Ect2-BRCT complex formation (14.9&#x00025;&#x000b1;8.3&#x00025; of wild-type association) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000110-g002">Figure 2E</xref>). Conversely, mutation of these four serine residues to Asp (HsCyk-4-4D) to mimic the phosphorylated state generated a form of HsCyk-4 capable of associating with Ect2-BRCT even in the absence of Plk1 phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000110-g002">Figure 2E</xref>). Whereas Plk1 phosphorylation of HsCyk-4-wt stimulated association with Ect2-BRCT 20.2&#x000b1;2.8-fold, HsCyk-4-4A and HsCyk-4-4D produced fold increases of only 3.1&#x000b1;0.9 and 1.7&#x000b1;0.5, respectively, suggesting that the identified residues account for the vast majority of Plk1-mediated stimulation. Yeast two hybrid analysis confirmed that HsCyk-4-4D possessed an increased affinity for Ect2-BRCT (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000110.s003">Figure S3</xref>). We conclude that Plk1 phosphorylates multiple serine residues in the N terminus of HsCyk-4 in vitro, thereby stimulating its association with Ect2.</p><p>To confirm that Plk1 phosphorylates these sites in vivo as well as to determine their spatial and temporal regulation, we obtained phosphospecific antibodies directed at Ser170 in HsCyk-4. Phospho-Ser170 antibodies specifically stained the central spindle of control, but not HsCyk-4&#x02013;depleted, anaphase cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000110-g002">Figure 2F</xref>).

In bulk populations, a wild-type copy of HsCyk-4&#x02013;EGFP was able to largely rescue the cytokinesis failure of endogenous HsCyk-4 depletion (20.7&#x00025;&#x000b1;1.1&#x00025; versus 66.7&#x00025;&#x000b1;1.5&#x00025; cytokinesis failure), whereas expression of EGFP alone failed to rescue (65.2&#x00025;&#x000b1;0.2&#x00025; cytokinesis failure) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000110-g003">Figure 3B</xref>). The Plk1 phospho-site mutants differed markedly in their abilities to restore efficient cytokinesis: HsCyk-4-4A&#x02013;EGFP failed to rescue (59.4&#x00025;&#x000b1;3.2&#x00025; cytokinesis failure), whereas HsCyk-4-4D&#x02013;EGFP rescued to a similar extent as wild type (16.7&#x00025;&#x000b1;0.7&#x00025; cytokinesis failure) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000110-g003">Figure 3B</xref>). In individual live cells depleted for endogenous HsCyk-4, expression of EGFP alone or HsCyk-4-4A&#x02013;EGFP failed to restore cleavage furrow formation in 67&#x00025; (<italic>n</italic>&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;9) and 47&#x00025; (<italic>n</italic>&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;32) of cells, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000110-g003">Figure 3C and 3D</xref>).

We conclude that phospho-site mutants of HsCyk-4 that fail to associate with Ect2 in vitro block cleavage furrow formation in vivo.</p><p>To more fully characterize the cytokinetic defect caused by the nonphosphorylatable allele of HsCyk-4, we examined the localization of critical cytokinetic regulators during anaphase in individual fixed cells. As was the case with all single-cell experiments, only cells expressing the transgenes at comparable levels were scored for phenotypic analysis (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000110.s006">Figure S6B and S6D</xref>). First, we examined Ect2 localization in cells expressing HsCyk-4&#x02013;EGFP derivatives. Although Ect2 was recruited to the central spindle by HsCyk-4-wt&#x02013;EGFP and HsCyk-4-4D&#x02013;EGFP during anaphase (97.8&#x00025; and 95.4&#x00025;, respectively, see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000110.s006">Figure S6A</xref> for method of assessing localization), a positive Ect2 central spindle signal was not detected in nearly 90&#x00025; (<italic>n</italic>&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;96) of anaphase cells expressing HsCyk-4-4A&#x02013;EGFP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000110-g004">Figures 4A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000110.s006">S6A, and S6B</xref>). Similarly, while recombinant Ect2-BRCT precipitated HsCyk-4-wt&#x02013;EGFP and HsCyk-4-4D&#x02013;EGFP from purvalanol A&#x02013;treated cells, Ect2-BRCT failed to precipitate either EGFP alone or detectable amounts of HsCyk-4-4A&#x02013;EGFP when stably expressed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000110-g004">Figure 4B</xref>). To exclude the possibility that the reduced level of HsCyk-4-4A&#x02013;EGFP expression precluded our ability to detect its association with Ect2-BRCT, we transiently transfected HsCyk-4&#x02013;EGFP derivatives to approximately equal levels and confirmed the absence of detectable association of HsCyk-4-4A&#x02013;EGFP with recombinant Ect2-BRCT in purvalanol A-treated cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000110.s005">Figure S5B</xref>). Consistent with its central role in cleavage furrow formation, RhoA localization to the equatorial cortex was perturbed in cells stably expressing HsCyk-4-4A&#x02013;EGFP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000110-g004">Figure 4C</xref>). To quantitatively examine a requirement for Plk1 phosphorylation of HsCyk-4 in RhoA activation, we examined the localization of Anillin, a factor that requires active RhoA signaling for its localization to the equatorial cortex <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000110-Zhao1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000110-Piekny2">&#x0005b;28&#x0005d;</xref>.

We conclude that Plk1 phosphorylation of the N terminus of HsCyk-4 is necessary to mediate association with Ect2 and promote RhoA activation in vivo. The phenotype associated with HsCyk-4-4A&#x02013;EGFP expression is highly reminiscent of Plk1 inhibition <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000110-Burkard1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000110-Santamaria1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>, suggesting that, with respect to cleavage furrow formation, HsCyk-4 is a relevant target of Plk1's kinase activity.</p><p>If the primary function of Plk1 in generating the HsCyk-4-Ect2 complex is to phosphorylate HsCyk-4, then HsCyk-4-4D&#x02013;EGFP should be able to associate with Ect2 in the absence of Plk1 kinase activity. To test this possibility, wild type and HsCyk-4-4D&#x02013;EGFP stable cells were induced to exit mitosis with addition of purvalanol A in the presence and absence of BI-2536. HsCyk-4-4D&#x02013;EGFP retained the ability to be precipitated by Ect2-BRCT despite the presence of BI-2536, whereas the association of wild-type HsCyk-4&#x02013;EGFP with Ect2&#x02013;BRCT was sensitive to the inhibitor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000110-g005">Figure 5A</xref>). Surprisingly, although HsCyk-4-4D&#x02013;EGFP coprecipitated with Ect2-BRCT in the presence of BI-2536, endogenous Ect2 was not recruited to the central spindle during anaphase of BI-2536 treated HsCyk-4-4D&#x02013;EGFP cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000110-g005">Figure 5B</xref>, upper images). As a likely consequence, HsCyk-4-4D&#x02013;EGFP expression did not prevent BI-2536-induced cytokinesis failure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000110-g005">Figure 5B</xref>, lower images). These data suggest that Plk1 likely phosphorylates multiple targets essential for cytokinesis, and that the regulated association between HsCyk-4 and Ect2 at the central spindle requires other Plk1-dependent steps in addition to HsCyk-4 phosphorylation. Because Plk1 is known to phosphorylate the C terminus of Ect2 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000110-Niiya1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>, we asked whether the Ect2-BRCT fragment could localize independently of Plk1 activity in HsCyk-4-4D&#x02013;EGFP cells. Whereas less than 2&#x00025; of cells expressing Myc-tagged Ect2-BRCT localized the truncated protein to the central spindle in BI-2536-treated HsCyk-4-wt&#x02013;EGFP expressing cells, those expressing HsCyk-4-4D&#x02013;EGFP retained Ect2-BRCT localization in 16.2&#x00025;&#x000b1;7.1&#x00025; of BI-2536 treated anaphase cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000110-g005">Figure 5C</xref>). We conclude that while Plk1 phosphorylation of the N terminus of HsCyk-4 is necessary and to a certain extent sufficient to mediate association with Ect2-BRCT, other Plk1-dependent events, occurring at least partially through the C terminus of Ect2, are necessary for its recruitment to the central spindle.</p><fig id="pbio-1000110-g005" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pbio.1000110.g005</object-id><label>Figure 5</label><caption><title>Plk1 utilizes multiple mechanisms to promote Ect2 central spindle localization.</title><p>(A) The indicated stable cell lines transfected with siRNA to deplete endogenous HsCyk-4 were synchronized with nocodazole, at which point 22.5 &#x000b5;M purvalanol A was added to the cells in the presence or absence of 100 nM BI-2536.

Despite the disruption in Plk1&#x02013;Prc1 association, Plk1 central spindle localization was only moderately attenuated (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000110.s008">Figure S8A</xref>), and phosphorylated HsCyk-4 on Ser170 persisted at the central spindle (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000110.s008">Figure S8C</xref>). Although this reduced level of Plk1 at the central spindle could suffice for HsCyk-4 phosphorylation, these data suggest that Plk1 need not associate directly with Prc1 in order to phosphorylate HsCyk-4.</p><p>Alternatively, as Prc1, Plk1, and centralspindlin all concentrate on a microtubule-based scaffold, Prc1-mediated bundling of microtubules may facilitate phosphorylation of HsCyk-4 by Plk1. To test this possibility, we asked whether microtubule disruption would influence the ability of Ect2-BRCT to precipitate endogenous HsCyk-4. Low-dose nocodazole treatment (0.04 &#x000b5;g/ml), which only weakly disrupted the microtubule cytoskeleton and retained HsCyk-4 microtubule association, permitted robust precipitation of HsCyk-4 by Ect2-BRCT upon purvalanol A addition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000110-g006">Figure 6D</xref>). However, 5 &#x000b5;g/ml nocodazole caused full microtubule destabilization, delocalized HsCyk-4, and rendered HsCyk-4 association with Ect2-BRCT undetectable (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000110-g006">Figure 6D</xref>), underscoring the importance of a microtubule platform for this association.</p><p>Although these data implicate both Prc1 and a microtubule scaffold as critical regulators of RhoA activation by modulating Plk1 phosphorylation of HsCyk-4, cells depleted for Prc1 can form ingressing cleavage furrows <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000110-Kurasawa1">&#x0005b;30&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000110-Mollinari1">&#x0005b;32&#x0005d;</xref> and those depleted of microtubules retain contractility <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000110-Canman1">&#x0005b;33&#x0005d;</xref>, indicating that Prc1 and microtubules are not strictly essential for RhoA activation upon mitotic exit.

Indeed, in this context, Prc1 depletion severely compromised RhoA-induced contractility (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000110-g007">Figure 7A</xref>). We conclude that Prc1 facilitates Plk1 phosphorylation of HsCyk-4 to allow recruitment of Ect2 to the central spindle where it can stimulate the local activation of RhoA. These data suggest that other mechanisms can compensate for the absence of Prc1 during bipolar cytokinesis.</p><fig id="pbio-1000110-g007" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pbio.1000110.g007</object-id><label>Figure 7</label><caption><title>Ectopic cleavage furrowing during forced mitotic exit requires Prc1.</title><p>(A) HeLa cells were either mock transfected (control) or transfected with siRNA to deplete the indicated protein and synchronized in prometaphase with nocodazole.

At the central spindle, microtubules are bundled through the combined efforts of the centralspindlin complex and the MAP Prc1. Factor X, which could be Prc1, Mklp2, centralspindlin, or an unknown factor, recruits Plk1 to the central spindle through association with its PBD, freeing the kinase domain to phosphorylate substrates at the central spindle (e.g., HsCyk-4, Ect2). Plk1 phosphorylation of HsCyk-4 is not sufficient for Ect2 recruitment to the central spindle, but requires other Plk1-dependent processes, at least one of which may be the relief of Ect2 autoinhibition.

The Plk1-mediated recruitment of the RhoGEF Ect2 to the central spindle by the RhoGAP HsCyk-4 component of centralspindlin appears to be a critical step in the generation of a localized band of cortical RhoA to a region just overlying the central spindle <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000110-Burkard1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000110-Santamaria1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>. Here, we provide a molecular mechanism whereby the HsCyk-4-Ect2 complex is formed at the central spindle following anaphase onset. By combining a reconstituted system with cell-based analyses, we have demonstrated that Plk1 promotes the phosphorylation of the N terminus of HsCyk-4, thus generating a phospho-epitope recognized by the BRCT domains of Ect2. BRCT binding may relieve Ect2 autoinhibition and facilitate activation of its intrinsic exchange activity toward RhoA. Indeed, stimulation of the HsCyk-4-Ect2 complex formation by Plk1 phosphorylation is critical for RhoA cortical localization and cleavage furrow formation. Our data also demonstrate that the role of Plk1 in stimulating HsCyk-4&#x02013;Ect2 association is not limited to phosphorylation of HsCyk-4, but rather may also involve relief of Ect2 autoinhibition. Furthermore, we have identified the microtubule-associated protein (MAP) Prc1 and microtubules as critical factors facilitating Plk1 phosphorylation of HsCyk-4. Collectively, our work has elucidated a molecular basis for Plk1-regulated cleavage furrow formation and has provided further evidence that central spindle microtubules act as a crucial signaling center for cytokinesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000110-g007">Figure 7B</xref>).</p><p>In order to stimulate association with the BRCT domains of Ect2, Plk1 targets multiple serine residues within the N terminus of HsCyk-4. While BRCT&#x02013;phosphopeptide interactions have only been modeled with a single phosphorylated residue <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000110-Glover1">&#x0005b;36&#x0005d;</xref>, it is possible that the tandem BRCT domains of Ect2 contact multiple phosphorylated residues. However, because mutation of the equivalent residues in Ect2 that coordinate the phosphate in MDC1 and BRCA1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000110-Lee1">&#x0005b;25&#x0005d;</xref> abrogates binding to HsCyk-4, we do not favor this possibility. Alternatively, phosphorylation of multiple residues within HsCyk-4 may lead to a conformational change that favors recognition of one particular phosphoserine by the BRCT domains of Ect2. Consistent with this, mutation of Ser157 alone within HsCyk-4 abolished association with Ect2-BRCT in mitotic lysates (unpublished data). Still, as mutation of any one of the serine residues was insufficient to prevent Plk1 stimulation of the HsCyk-4-Ect2 association in vitro, these data are not in complete accordance with one another. Instead, the most plausible explanation of these results is that each of the four phosphoserine residues within the cluster contributes to the overall binding affinity, perhaps by facilitating rebinding upon dissociation.</p><p>We have shown that the BRCT repeats of Ect2 can bind a phosphomimetic allele of HsCyk-4 (4D) from Plk1-inhibited mitotic lysates, suggesting a rather simple pathway for regulation of HsCyk-4 by Plk1. However, despite premature Ect2 association with HsCyk-4-4D in early mitotic cells (unpublished data), RhoA-induced cortical contractility was not observed. These data suggest that further steps are necessary to form a complex competent for triggering contractile events. One such step may be the removal of inhibitory Cdk1-cyclin B phosphorylations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000110-Yuce1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000110-Zhao1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>. Additionally, Plk1 phosphorylation of HsCyk-4 is necessary, but not sufficient, for Ect2 central spindle recruitment. As appreciable central spindle localization of isolated BRCT domains can occur in Plk1-inhibited cells expressing phosphomimetic HsCyk-4, Plk1 may also function to relieve Ect2 autoinhibition <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000110-Niiya1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>. However, the recruitment of this N-terminal fragment of Ect2 is far more efficient in the presence than in the absence of Plk1 activity, suggesting the involvement of additional Plk1 substrates and additional modes of regulation.

One important caveat is that these mutations did not completely abrogate Plk1 recruitment to the central spindle. This diminished Plk1 localization may arise through an alternative pathway, perhaps through association with Mklp1, Mklp2, or HsCyk-4 itself (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000110-g007">Figure 7B</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000110-Lowery2">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000110-Neef2">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000110-Liu1">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref>. These modes of Plk1 recruitment may provide a sufficient amount of localized kinase activity to generate a biologically relevant pool of phosphorylated HsCyk-4.

In contrast, our biochemical analyses using prometaphase cells forced out of mitosis indicate that Prc1 is critical for generating significant amounts of phosphorylated HsCyk-4.

Additionally, while Prc1 depletion does not block furrowing in bipolar cells, it does greatly attenuate ectopic cleavage furrowing induced by purvalanol A treatment of prometaphase cells. A similar scenario occurs in cells depleted for Mklp1.
