At present, pancreatic cancer is the fourth leading cause of cancer-related deaths in the U.S. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Despite great efforts on clinical and molecular pancreatic cancer research, the prognosis remains poor with an overall 5-year-survival of less than 5% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Complete surgical resection still represents the only potentially curative treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. By the time of diagnosis, however, only few patients are candidates for surgery.</p><p>The capability to modulate or even suppress antitumor immune responses is a characteristic feature enabling malignant tumors to evade immune surveillance and subsequent destruction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Costimulatory signaling plays a key role in the initiation and termination of immune responses by regulation of T cell priming, growth, maturation, and tolerance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. One of the best characterized costimulatory pathways includes B7-1/B7-2:CD28 signaling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. Engagement of B7-1 on antigen-presenting cells with CD28 on T cells enhances T cell proliferation and IL-2 production. In the absence of this simultaneous costimulatory signal, ligation of the T cell receptor by an antigenic peptide results in T cell dysfunction, intolerance or anergy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. Beside positive costimulatory signals that augment and sustain T cell response, costimulatory pathways also deliver inhibitory signals which downregulate T cell response. Binding of CTLA-4 to B7-1 and/or B7-2 has been shown to inhibit IL-2 synthesis and progression through the cell cycle leading to the termination of T cell response [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>].</p><p>Within the past decade, new costimulatory ligands and receptors have been identified including B7-H1 (programmed death-1 ligand-1), B7-DC (programmed death-1 ligand-2), PD-1 (programmed death-1), B7-H3, and B7-H4 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. In contrast to the well-defined roles of B7-1 and B7-2 as essential costimulators involved in T cell activation, the function of B7-H1, B7-DC, B7-H3, and B7-H4 is less clear. Recently, B7 homologues have been implicated as potential regulators of antitumor immunity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. Numerous human cancers have been reported to aberrantly express B7-H1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. Aberrant B7-H1 expression by tumor cells has been associated with adverse pathologic features and poor outcome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. We and others have previously shown that pancreatic cancer patients with cancer-cell associated B7-H1 expression had a significantly poorer prognosis than patients with B7-H1 negative tumors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Thus, aberrant expression of B7-H1 has been postulated as a potential mechanism by which malignant tumors may evade the host immune response. A possible explanation for the tumor-associated immune suppression is that aberrant expression of B7-H1 might downregulate tumor-specific T cell response by inducing T cell anergy or apoptosis.</p><p>In contrast to the negative prognostic value of aberrant B7-H1 expression by tumor cells, the role of B7-H3 in human cancers is controversial. B7-H3 is a B7 homologue that shares approximately 25% sequence homology with B7-H1. In contrast to B7-H3 mRNA, which is broadly expressed in lymphoid and non-lymphoid organs, B7-H3 protein expression seems to be limited. Functionally, B7-H3 is thought to serve as an accessory costimulatory regulator of T cell responses following initial T cell priming. However, its exact physiologic role is still unclear, because both stimulatory and inhibitory properties have been described. Initially, it has been reported that human B7-H3 costimulates proliferation of both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, enhances the induction of cytotoxic T cells, and selectively stimulates IFN-&#x003b3; production in the presence of T cell receptor signaling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. In mice, however, B7-H3 inhibits proliferation of both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells and IFN-&#x003b3; production [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. In accordance to its inconsistent immunologic function, the role of B7-H3 in cancer remains far from clear. For example, transfection of B7-H3 into P815 tumor cells led to the regression of tumors and amplification of a tumor-specific CD8+ cytotoxic lymphocyte response in syngeneic mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. In another experimental study, adenoviral B7-H3 treatment resulted in a reduction of tumor size and a significant reduction of secondary metastases in an orthotopic murine colon cancer model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. In a model of EL-4 lymphoma, injection of a B7-H3 expression plasmid into the tumor resulted in complete regression of 50% of tumors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. The response depended upon CD8+ T cells and NK cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. In contrast to these tumor-protective effects of B7-H3, tumor B7-H3 expression in human non-small-cell lung cancer inversely correlated with the number of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes and significantly correlated with lymph node metastases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. In prostate cancer, two studies analyzing B7-H3 expression in a considerable number of patients revealed that almost all examined tumors expressed B7-H3 protein. Both studies showed a significant correlation between high B7-H3 expression by tumor cells and disease spread and poor outcome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>].</p><p>Here, we show for the first time that B7-H3 is abundantly expressed in pancreatic cancer and that B7-H3 expression by pancreatic cancer cells correlates with increased patient survival as well as with the number of tumor-infiltrating CD8+ T cells.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Patients</title><p>All tissue specimens analyzed in this study were obtained according to institutional review board-approved procedures for consent. Human pancreatic cancer tissue samples were obtained from 96 patients (39 female and 57 male patients with a median age of 63 years; age range, 38-83 years), who underwent resection for pancreatic cancer at the University Hospital of Heidelberg (Heidelberg, Germany) between 2001 and 2006. Two patients presented with stage IB, 11 patients presented with stage IIA disease, 70 patients presented with stage IIB disease, two patients presented with stage III disease, and 11 patients presented with stage IV disease according to the UICC classification (6th edition, 2002). The median follow-up was 23 months, with a range from 2 to 44 months. Normal human pancreatic tissue samples were obtained through an organ donor program from 10 previously healthy individuals (four female, six male; median age of 43 years, with a range of 17-62 years) when there was no suitable recipient.</p></sec><sec><title>Tissue Sampling</title><p>Immediately after surgical removal, tissue samples were either snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen (for RNA and protein extraction) or fixed in 10% buffered formalin solution and embedded in paraffin for histological analysis.

Real-time PCR was performed with the LightCyclerFastStart DNA SYBR Green kit as described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. B7-H3, CD4, CD8, and IFN-&#x003b3; primers were obtained from Search-LC (Heidelberg, Germany). The number of specific transcripts was normalized to the average expression of two housekeeping genes (cyclophillin B and hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>].

Antigen retrieval was achieved by microwave pre-treatment in citrate buffer. Paraffin-embedded pancreatic tissue sections (3-&#x003bc;m thick) were deparaffinized with xylene and rehydrated through graded alcohol into distilled water. After washing in Tris-buffered saline, endogenous peroxidase activity was quenched by incubating the slides in 3% hydrogen peroxide in methanol. To block unspecific activity of secondary antibodies, slides were treated with TBS/3%BSA. After overnight incubation at 4&#x000b0;C with the primary antibody, slides were washed with Tris-buffered saline and 0.05% Tween 20, treated with anti-mouse (DAKO) horseradish peroxidase-labeled secondary antibody for 1 hour, developed using Dako Envision System (DAKO), and counterstained with Mayer's hematoxylin. To ensure antibody specificity, negative control slides were incubated with normal mouse IgG. Immunohistochemistry results were evaluated by scanning each slide under low power magnification (&#x000d7;10) to identify regions containing positive immunoreactivity. Immunostaining was further evaluated at high power magnification (&#x000d7;200).

To confirm the qRT-PCR data and to assess the location of B7-H3 protein, we performed immunostainings of 68 pancreatic cancer tissue samples. In pancreatic cancer tissues, abundant positive B7-H3 immunoreactivity could be detected in pancreatic cancer cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>), pancreatic islet cells, tumor-infiltrating immune cells, and sporadical weak immunoreactivity in tumor-surrounding tubular complexes and endothelial cells.

Despite the infiltration of large numbers of immune cells into pancreatic cancer, the immune system fails to prevent disease development and progression. Recently, dysregulation of immune responses by aberrant expression of negative costimulatory molecules by tumor cells has been suggested to play a potential role in the evasion of tumors from the immune system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. For example, tumor B7-H1 expression has been shown to significantly correlate with negative outcome in several human malignancies, including pancreatic cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. B7-H3 is another member of the B7 family of costimulatory molecules which serves as an accessory costimulatory regulator of T cell responses following initial T cell priming. The exact physiological function of B7-H3 and especially its role in the development and progression of human cancers are still elusive.</p><p>In this study, we demonstrated that the cultured pancreatic cancer cell lines Panc-1, MiaPaCa-2, and SU86.86 constitutively express B7-H3. Moreover, we demonstrated that B7-H3 gene expression is upregulated in pancreatic cancer tissues in comparison to normal pancreatic tissues. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed B7-H3 protein expression by pancreatic cancer cells. Tumor cell-associated B7-H3 expression significantly correlated with better postoperative survival. Moreover, we showed that B7-H3 gene expression in pancreatic cancer tissues significantly correlated with the levels of CD4 and CD8. Further immunohistochemical analyses on the distribution of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells revealed the infiltration of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells into areas of B7-H3 positive pancreatic cancer cells. More importantly, the number of tumor-infiltrating CD8+ T cells significantly correlated with the levels of B7-H3 on pancreatic cancer cells. Therefore, one could speculate that tumor-associated B7-H3 expression might act as a positive regulator of antitumor response in pancreatic cancer. B7-H3 might trigger the infiltration of CD8+ T cells into cancerous tissues and might also enhance tumor immunogenicity by stimulation of tumor-infiltrating CD8+ T cells. These findings are in accordance with previous reports on the function of B7-H3. Chapoval and colleagues reported that human B7-H3 costimulates proliferation of CD8+ T cells, enhances the induction of cytotoxic T cells, and selectively stimulates IFN-&#x003b3; production by T cells in the presence of T cell receptor signaling in vitro [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. Further data in support of a positive costimulatory role of B7-H3 in the regulation of immune response come from an experimental study showing that acute and chronic cardiac allograft rejection can be reduced in B7-H3 knock-out mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. Recently, B7-H3 has also been implicated as a potential stimulator of antitumor immunity. In vivo, transfection of B7-H3 into P815 mouse tumors led to tumor regression and amplification of tumor-specific CD8+ CTL response in syngeneic mice suggesting enhancement of tumor immunogenicity by preferential stimulation of CD8+ T cell responses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. Further evidence in favor of a possible tumor-protective effect of B7-H3 expression in cancers comes from a clinical study investigating the expression of B7-H3 in human gastric carcinoma. The majority of tumors showed B7-H3 expression in tumor cells. Moreover, the presence of B7-H3 positive tumor cells was associated with improved patient survival [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. Although these results clearly implicate a tumor-protective effect of B7-H3, the exact physiologic/pathologic role of B7-H3 remains ambiguous, because B7-H3 has also been shown to inhibit CD4+ and CD8+ T cell proliferation and IFN-&#x003b3; production mediated by anti-CD3 in mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. Recently, single or duplicate constructs of the immunoglobulin-V-like and immunoglobulin-C-like domains of B7-H3 have been shown to downregulate both T cell proliferation and cytokine production in response to CD3/CD28-mediated costimulatory activation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. Further evidence that B7-H3 may serve as an inhibitor of antitumor immunity includes several clinical studies. In prostate cancer, Zang et al. evaluated the expression of B7-H3 in over eight hundred prostate cancer patients and reported that 93% of the examined tumors displayed aberrant B7-H3 expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. High tumor B7-H3 expression was associated with disease progression and spread as well as with poor patient survival [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. Accordingly, tumor cell and tumor vasculature B7-H3 expression significantly correlated with an increased risk of death from clear cell renal cell carcinoma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. In these studies, however, the functional aspect of B7-H3 expression was not tested in detail. For example, correlation of B7-H3 expression by cancer cells with tumor-infiltrating immune cells was either not tested or not significant. The reason for the contrasting effects of B7-H3 in cancer might also be related to varying counter-receptors involved in different tumor entities. So far, one receptor of B7-H3 has been identified [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. Hashiguchi and co-workers have recently reported that murine B7-H3 specifically binds to triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells (TREM)-like transcript 2 (TLT-2, TREML2), which is expressed on both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. Moreover, the authors demonstrated that stimulation with B7-H3 transfectants preferentially upregulated the proliferation and IFN-&#x003b3; production of CD8<sup>+ </sup>T cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. In humans, however, a receptor for B7-H3 has not been identified yet.</p><p>Another possible mechanism involved in antitumor immunity includes the induction of tumor-suppressive cytokines. Here, we found that B7-H3 was significantly associated with IFN-&#x003b3; levels. IFN-&#x003b3; is an important pro-inflammatory Th1 cytokine and has been implicated as a mediator of an extrinsic tumor-suppressor mechanism in immunocompetent hosts. IFN-&#x003b3; is usually produced by activated cytotoxic T lymphocytes, macrophages, and natural killer (NK) cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. In mice, treatment with neutralizing monoclonal antibodies to IFN-&#x003b3; resulted in a faster growth of immunogenic sarcomas that were transplanted into mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. Furthermore, endogenously produced IFN-&#x003b3; has been shown to be protective against transplanted, chemically induced, and spontaneous tumors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. Therefore, B7-H3 might act as an immunostimulatory agent through the induction of IFN-&#x003b3;.</p><p>Mechanisms regulating B7-H3 expression are still unclear. The local cytokine milieu in the tumor microenvironment represents a potential regulator of B7-H3. Indeed, IFN-&#x003b3; has previously been shown to enhance surface expression of B7-H3 on bone marrow derived dendritic cells and on monocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. Therefore, we investigated the potential effects of the Th1 cytokine IFN-&#x003b3; and Th2 cytokine IL-4 on the expression of B7-H3 on cultured pancreatic cancer cells. We found that both IFN-&#x003b3; and IL-4 treatment resulted in a marked increase of B7-H3 on SU86.86 but not on Panc-1 pancreatic cancer cells. Furthermore, we found that B7-H3 positively correlated with IFN-&#x003b3; levels in vivo. Taken together, these findings suggest a potential involvement of IFN-&#x003b3; (and IL-4) in the regulation of B7-H3 expression in pancreatic cancer.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>We demonstrated for the first time that B7-H3 is abundantly expressed in pancreatic cancer and that tumor cell-associated B7-H3 expression significantly correlates with prolonged postoperative survival. Moreover, we showed that B7-H3 expression significantly correlated with the number of tumor-infiltrating CD8+ T cells. Although further functional studies will certainly be required to better understand the exact role of B7-H3 in pancreatic cancer, our data suggest that B7-H3 might be involved in the induction of a specific antitumor immune response and that treatment with B7-H3 (e.g. by gene transfer) might represent a promising approach to improve the outcome of pancreatic cancer patients.</p></sec><sec><title>Abbreviations</title><p>CTLA-4: Cytotoxic T lymphocyte-associated antigen-4; IFN-&#x003b3;: Interferon-gamma; IL-2: Interleukin-2; IL-4: Interleukin-4; qRT-PCR: Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>ML and DMH conceived and designed the study, analyzed the data and drafted the manuscript.
