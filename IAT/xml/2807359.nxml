We investigated the effect of increased adiposity on ZAG expression in adipose tissue and the liver and on plasma levels in obese (<italic>ob/ob</italic>) mice compared with lean siblings. The study also examined the effect of the pro-inflammatory cytokine tumour necrosis factor-&#x003b1; (TNF&#x003b1;) on ZAG expression in adipocytes. <italic>Zag</italic> mRNA levels were significantly reduced in subcutaneous (fourfold) and epididymal (eightfold) fat of <italic>ob/ob</italic> mice. Consistently, ZAG protein content was decreased in both fat depots of <italic>ob/ob</italic> mice. In the liver of obese animals, steatosis was accompanied by the fall of both <italic>Zag</italic> mRNA (twofold) and ZAG protein content (2&#x000b7;5-fold). Plasma ZAG levels were also decreased in obese mice. In addition, <italic>Zag</italic> mRNA was reduced in epididymal (fivefold) and retroperitoneal (fivefold) adipose tissue of obese (<italic>fa/fa</italic>) Zucker rats. In contrast to <italic>Zag</italic> expression, <italic>Tnf&#x003b1;</italic> mRNA levels were elevated in adipose tissue (twofold) and the liver (2&#x000b7;5-fold) of <italic>ob/ob</italic> mice. Treatment with TNF&#x003b1; reduced <italic>Zag</italic> gene expression in differentiated adipocytes, and this inhibition was chronic, occurring at 24 and 48&#x0200a;h following TNF&#x003b1; treatment. It is concluded that ZAG synthesis in adipose tissue and the liver is downregulated, as are its circulating levels, in <italic>ob/ob</italic> mice. The reduced ZAG production may advance the susceptibility to lipid accumulation in these tissues in obesity, and this could be at least in part attributable to the inhibitory effect of TNF&#x003b1;.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group><funding-source id="CS1">Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council</funding-source><award-id rid="CS1">BBE015379</award-id></award-group><award-group><funding-source id="CS2">Medical Research Council</funding-source><award-id rid="CS2">87972</award-id></award-group></funding-group></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Introduction</title><p>Obesity is now a major health problem as it predisposes to insulin resistance, type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular malfunction. Although the pathogenesis of obesity and its associated co-morbidities are multifactorial, growing evidence suggests that altered production of adipose-derived protein factors (adipokines), such as leptin, tumour necrosis factor-&#x003b1; (TNF&#x003b1;), adiponectin and chemerin, plays an important role. Zinc-&#x003b1;2-glycoprotein (ZAG, also called AZGP1) is a secreted, soluble protein that has been found in plasma and other body fluids in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Burgi &#x00026; Schmid 1961</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Tada <italic>et al</italic>. 1991</xref>). Crystal structure analysis has demonstrated that ZAG belongs to the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Sanchez <italic>et al</italic>. 1999</xref>). Unlike other MHC molecules, ZAG is not membrane bound, and its functions seem to differ from that of MHC class I molecules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Sanchez <italic>et al</italic>. 1999</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">McDermott <italic>et al</italic>. 2006</xref>). Although the biological roles of ZAG have not been fully characterised, the protein has been shown to be identical to a lipid-mobilising factor (LMF), purified from the urine of patients with cancer cachexia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Todorov <italic>et al</italic>. 1998</xref>). Treatment with purified ZAG causes a selective reduction in body fat in both obese (<italic>ob/ob</italic>) and normal mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Hirai <italic>et al</italic>. 1998</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bing <italic>et al</italic>. 2002</xref>). <italic>In vitro</italic>, ZAG stimulates lipolysis in isolated murine and human adipocytes, and this appears to be attributable to its signalling through &#x003b2;3-adrenoceptors in rodents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Hirai <italic>et al</italic>. 1998</xref>). Further, there is evidence that ZAG directly promotes lipid utilisation, possibly by the upregulation of mitochondrial uncoupling proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bing <italic>et al</italic>. 2002</xref>).</p><p>ZAG has been identified in various organs, including the liver, breast, lung and prostate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Tada <italic>et al</italic>. 1991</xref>). Recent work from our group has shown that ZAG is also expressed in mouse, rat and human adipose tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bing <italic>et al</italic>. 2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Tzanavari <italic>et al</italic>. 2007</xref>). Importantly, ZAG is secreted abundantly from mature adipocytes as a major adipokine which may have an autocrine/paracrine role in adipose tissue function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Bao <italic>et al</italic>. 2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Mracek <italic>et al</italic>. 2009</xref>). ZAG expression in adipose tissue appears to be inversely linked to body fat mass. ZAG mRNA and protein content in adipose tissue are markedly increased in mice with cancer cachexia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bing <italic>et al</italic>. 2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">2006</xref>). In contrast, ZAG protein expression is reduced in white fat of neonatal rats at weaning when there is a rise in fat mass (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Tzanavari <italic>et al</italic>. 2007</xref>). Furthermore, <italic>ZAG</italic> mRNA levels have been reported to be decreased in subcutaneous fat of obese women (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Dahlman <italic>et al</italic>. 2005</xref>) and men (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Marrades <italic>et al</italic>. 2008</xref>). Very recently, work from our group and by others has shown that <italic>ZAG</italic> mRNA is negatively correlated with body mass index and body fat mass in human subjects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Gong <italic>et al</italic>. 2009</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Mracek <italic>et al</italic>. 2009</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Selva <italic>et al</italic>. 2009</xref>). In addition to adipose tissue, the liver is also a major site of ZAG synthesis in rodents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Ueyama <italic>et al</italic>. 1994</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bing <italic>et al</italic>. 2004</xref>). However, the regulation of ZAG expression in adipose tissue and the liver and of the circulating levels in obesity remains to be established.</p><p>The aim of this study was to examine the effect of increased adiposity on <italic>ZAG</italic> gene and protein expression in adipose tissue and liver of obese (<italic>ob/ob</italic>) mice in comparison with their lean siblings (<italic>ob/</italic><italic>+</italic>). Plasma ZAG protein levels were also determined in these mice. Finally, the study explored the effect of the pro-inflammatory cytokine TNF&#x003b1; on ZAG expression in adipocytes.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec><title>Animals</title><p>Nine-week-old male C57BL/6 obese (<italic>ob/ob</italic>; B6.V-Lep<sup>ob</sup>/OlaHsd) and appropriate lean control (B6.V-Lep<sup>ob</sup>/+Lep<sup>+</sup>OlaHsd) mice from Harlan (Bicester, UK) were housed at an ambient temperature of 22&#x000b1;1&#x0200a;&#x000b0;C under a 12&#x0200a;h light:12&#x0200a;h darkness cycle (lights on at 0700&#x0200a;h) and were fed <italic>ad libitum</italic> (CRM Diet, Labsure, Poole, UK).

We found that <italic>Zag</italic> mRNA levels are markedly reduced in subcutaneous and epididymal adipose tissue of <italic>ob/ob</italic> mice. In contrast, mRNA levels of the mutated leptin are significantly higher in the two depots of <italic>ob/ob</italic> mice as reported previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Frederich <italic>et al</italic>. 1995</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Trayhurn <italic>et al</italic>. 1995</xref>), reflecting the greater tissue mass and perhaps a compensatory response to the mutation. Consistent with the gene expression data, we further demonstrated that ZAG protein expression is decreased in epididymal and subcutaneous fat of <italic>ob/ob</italic> mice. In agreement with our findings, a recent study has shown that <italic>Zag</italic> gene expression was also reduced in epididymal adipose tissue of obese mice fed with a high-fat diet (HFD; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Gong <italic>et al</italic>. 2009</xref>). Furthermore, in the present study, we demonstrate that in addition to mouse models of obesity, <italic>Zag</italic> mRNA levels in epididymal and retroperitoneal fat are significantly decreased in obese (<italic>fa/fa</italic>) Zucker rats. Collectively, these observations suggest a possible link between increased adiposity and the downregulation of <italic>Zag</italic> expression in adipose tissue.</p><p>Obesity is associated with alterations in basal lipolysis, impaired antilipolytic action of insulin and reduced lipoprotein lipase activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Hauner <italic>et al</italic>. 2001</xref>). Furthermore, the substantial decrease in the expression and function of &#x003b2;1- and &#x003b2;3-adrenoreceptors in adipose tissue in <italic>ob/ob</italic> mice has been suggested to be a reason for the impaired lipid mobilisation in response to &#x003b2;-adrenergic agonists (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Robidoux <italic>et al</italic>. 2004</xref>). The repression of ZAG synthesis in obese animals might be related to its function in modulating lipid metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bing &#x00026; Trayhurn 2008</xref>). It has been shown that ZAG treatment selectively reduces body fat in obese and normal mice <italic>in vivo</italic> and stimulates lipolysis <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Hirai <italic>et al</italic>. 1998</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bing <italic>et al</italic>. 2002</xref>). It was proposed that ZAG may act as an alternative &#x003b2;-adrenergic agonist by signalling through &#x003b2;3-adrenoceptors in rodents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Hirai <italic>et al</italic>. 1998</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Russell <italic>et al</italic>. 2004</xref>). The role of ZAG in lipid mobilisation has been supported by a recent study of ZAG-knockout mice which were susceptible to weight gain on a HFD, and this probably results from a decrease in adipocyte lipolysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Rolli <italic>et al</italic>. 2007</xref>). In addition, mRNA levels of hormone-sensitive lipase were elevated in adipose tissue from ZAG-overexpressing transgenic mice which exhibit decreased body weight and epididymal fat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Gong <italic>et al</italic>. 2009</xref>). Therefore, reduced ZAG synthesis in adipose tissue of <italic>ob/ob</italic> mice observed in the present study may contribute to an impairment of lipid mobilisation.</p><p>Another interesting finding of this study is the demonstration of a decrease in <italic>Zag</italic> expression, both mRNA and protein, in the fatty liver of <italic>ob/ob</italic> mice. Liver is another major site for ZAG synthesis in rodents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Ueyama <italic>et al</italic>. 1994</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bing <italic>et al</italic>. 2004</xref>). It is of interest that <italic>Zag</italic> mRNA levels have been reported to be increased in the liver of mice with cancer cachexia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bing <italic>et al</italic>. 2004</xref>), a condition associated with significantly decreased adiposity. Liver steatosis in <italic>ob/ob</italic> mice, as shown in the present study and previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Shimomura <italic>et al</italic>. 1999</xref>), has been suggested to be the consequence of impaired lipid mobilisation and enhanced lipogenesis. Given the role of ZAG as an LMF, the fall of ZAG synthesis in the liver of obese mice may contribute to the hepatic accumulation of triglycerides. In addition to alterations in lipid metabolism, there are significant disturbances in liver glucose metabolism in <italic>ob/ob</italic> animals. A previous study has shown that hyperglycaemia in <italic>ob/ob</italic> mice is characterised by decreased phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase mRNA and increased <italic>Gapdh</italic> mRNA levels in the liver (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Ferber <italic>et al</italic>. 1994</xref>). We show here an enhanced expression of GAPDH protein in the liver of <italic>ob/ob</italic> mice, which further supports a dysregulation of hepatic glucose metabolism in obesity.</p><p>In the present study, plasma ZAG protein content was decreased in obese <italic>ob/ob</italic> mice, and a similar decline was observed in HFD-fed obese mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Gong <italic>et al</italic>. 2009</xref>). Concomitantly, recent studies in humans have reported reductions in serum ZAG levels in obese patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Gong <italic>et al</italic>. 2009</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Selva <italic>et al</italic>. 2009</xref>). However, a study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Stejskal <italic>et al</italic>. (2007)</xref> has found no differences in serum ZAG concentrations between obese patients with the metabolic syndrome and otherwise healthy controls. These results suggest that adipose tissue- and liver-derived ZAG may be important locally through its autocrine/paracrine actions. The production of ZAG in other tissues would influence its circulating levels, and also the clearance of ZAG in the circulation might be altered in obesity.</p><p>Although ZAG expression has been shown to be inversely related to adiposity, its regulation in obesity remains to be established. Obesity, characterised by a state of chronic low-grade inflammation, is associated with upregulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Yudkin <italic>et al</italic>. 1999</xref>). TNF&#x003b1; has been indicated as a key player in the inflammatory processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hotamisligil <italic>et al</italic>. 1993</xref>), and it alters the production of adipokines, such as inhibiting adiponectin whilst stimulating the synthesis of pro-inflammatory adipokines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Degawa-Yamauchi <italic>et al</italic>. 2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Wang &#x00026; Trayhurn 2006</xref>). In the present study, we demonstrate that contrary to <italic>Zag</italic> expression, <italic>Tnf&#x003b1;</italic> mRNA levels are increased in both adipose tissue and liver in <italic>ob/ob</italic> mice. The rise in <italic>Tnf&#x003b1;</italic> with decreased <italic>Zag</italic> expression may imply a role for TNF&#x003b1; in the lowered ZAG production in obesity. This notion is supported by the <italic>in vitro</italic> study that shows an inhibitory effect of TNF&#x003b1; on <italic>Zag</italic> gene expression in differentiated adipocytes, which is consistent with our previous observation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Bao <italic>et al</italic>. 2005</xref>). Therefore, TNF&#x003b1; could be a negative regulator of ZAG synthesis in adipose tissue. To further characterise the nature of the inhibitory effect of TNF&#x003b1; on <italic>Zag</italic> expression, we assessed the changes over a time course. Our results reveal a chronic effect of TNF&#x003b1; on ZAG in adipocytes as the apparent reduction of <italic>Zag</italic> mRNA occurs at 24 and 48&#x0200a;h following TNF&#x003b1; treatment. Taken together, these results suggest that repression of ZAG expression in adipose tissue and possibly in the liver of obese mice might be the consequence of increased TNF&#x003b1; in the obese state.</p><p>In conclusion, the present study shows that <italic>Zag</italic> mRNA and its protein expression in adipose tissue is downregulated in <italic>ob/ob</italic> mice. It also demonstrates that in the fatty liver of obese mice, both <italic>Zag</italic> mRNA levels and protein content are reduced. Furthermore, circulating ZAG levels are decreased in obese mice. In contrast, <italic>Tnf&#x003b1;</italic> mRNA levels are elevated in adipose tissue and liver of <italic>ob/ob</italic> mice. Treatment of TNF&#x003b1; <italic>in vitro</italic> represses ZAG expression in differentiated adipocytes. It is suggested that reduced ZAG production may advance the susceptibility to lipid accumulation in adipose tissue and liver in obesity, and this could be at least in part attributable to the inhibitory effect of TNF&#x003b1;.</p></sec><sec><title>Declaration of interest</title><p>The authors declare that there are no conflicts of interest that would prejudice the impartiality of the research reported here.</p></sec><sec><title>Funding</title><p>PT is a member of COST BM0602.
