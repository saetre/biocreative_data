To identify factors acting downstream of mmBCFAs for their function in growth regulation, we conducted a genetic screen for suppressors of the L1 arrest that occurs in animals depleted of the 17-carbon mmBCFA C17ISO. Three of the suppressor mutations defined an unexpected player, the P-type ATPase TAT-2, which belongs to the flippase family of proteins that are implicated in mediating phospholipid bilayer asymmetry. We provide evidence that TAT-2, but not other TAT genes, has a specific role in antagonizing the regulatory activity of mmBCFAs in intestinal cells. Interestingly, we found that mutations in <italic>tat-2</italic> also suppress the lethality caused by inhibition of the first step in sphingolipid biosynthesis. We further showed that the fatty acid side-chains of glycosylceramides contain 20&#x00025;&#x02013;30&#x00025; mmBCFAs and that this fraction is greatly diminished in the absence of mmBCFA biosynthesis. These results suggest a model in which a C17ISO-containing sphingolipid may mediate the regulatory functions of mmBCFAs and is negatively regulated by TAT-2 in intestinal cells. This work indicates a novel connection between a P-type ATPase and the critical regulatory function of a specific fatty acid.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><p>Fatty acids serve diverse functions in organisms, including roles at the cell membrane to coordinate cell signaling processes. Monomethyl branched-chain fatty acids (mmBCFAs) are a special type of fatty acid that is commonly present in animals. Because mmBCFAs are a small component of the total fatty acid pool, their functions have not been a major research focus and are largely unclear. We tackled the problem using the nematode <italic>C. elegans</italic>. Our laboratory previously found that without mmBCFAs, worms cannot develop normally and die. To understand how these obscure fatty acids perform such important roles, we searched for other factors involved in the process by conducting a mutagenesis screen to uncover mutant worms that can recover the ability to grow without the presence of mmBCFAs. We found several such mutations in a single gene that codes for a protein called TAT-2. TAT-2 is one of several poorly understood P-type ATPases that likely help maintain the proper lipid structure in cell membranes. Our work indicates that TAT-2 antagonizes the growth regulatory function of mmBCFAs in intestinal cells. Studies on how mmBCFAs and this protein functionally interact explore a novel, interesting, and important problem that is only beginning to be understood.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="12"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Lipids play many critical roles in cellular function ranging from providing structural support within cell membranes to mediating signaling events. The importance of the particular fatty acid constituents of complex lipids is only beginning to be understood. While extensive analyses have been conducted to elucidate the specific roles of straight-chain saturated and unsaturated fatty acids, there is little known about the roles of monomethyl branched-chain fatty acids (mmBCFAs) in animals. We have previously identified an essential role for mmBCFAs in regulating post-embryonic development in the model organism <italic>C. elegans</italic>, where the deletion of <italic>elo-5</italic>, a gene encoding a very long chain fatty acid (VLCFA) elongase, causes larval arrest and death. When the fatty acid composition of worms lacking functional ELO-5 was compared to that of wild-type worms, two detectable mmBCFAs (C15ISO and C17ISO) were missing. In addition, when the ELO-5 deficient strain was supplemented with exogenous C15ISO and C17ISO, the nematodes recovered from larval arrest and were able to proliferate similar to wild-type worms <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000589-Kniazeva1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>. The L1 arrest that occurs in the absence of C17ISO is strikingly similar to the L1 diapause that occurs in the absence of food <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000589-Kniazeva2">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>. In both cases, the worms arrest at an early L1 stage, just after hatching and prior to the first M cell division, and the arrest is reversible upon restoration of the depleted component. The DAF-2/DAF-16 insulin-signaling pathway has been shown to be involved in the starvation-induced arrest <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000589-Baugh1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>. Further characterization revealed that C17ISO may play a critical role in activating post-embryonic development in <italic>C. elegans</italic> through a novel pathway that is independent of the DAF-2/DAF-16 food-sensing pathway <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000589-Kniazeva2">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>. CKI-1 is a cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor that has been shown to be required for exit from the cell cycle and is likely a critical downstream target of DAF-16 with its expression level normally decreasing during L1 development <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000589-Baugh1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000589-Hong1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>.

Consistent with the critical regulatory role played by mmBCFAs in worms, we have found that mmBCFA homeostasis is maintained through a feedback regulatory mechanism involving SBP-1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000589-Kniazeva1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000589-Kniazeva2">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>.

Alterations in cell surface properties due to the loss of membrane asymmetry are associated with various normal and pathological outcomes including apoptosis and platelet activation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000589-Fadok1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000589-Bevers1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>. However, with the exception of phosphatidylserine externalization during apoptosis, the precise mechanisms by which the asymmetric distribution of lipids across cellular membranes regulates membrane and lipid functions are not well understood. A subfamily of P-type ATPases, called aminophospholipid translocases or flippases, are proteins that are thought to contribute to this asymmetry in an ATP-dependent manner <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000589-Auland1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000589-Tang1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>. The postulated function of flippases is to aid in the inward movement of phosphatidylserine (PS) and phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) from the extracellular or lumenal leaflet to the cytosolic leaflet of cellular membranes. To date, there have been very limited functional studies on this family of proteins in animals. In yeast, an aminophospholipid translocase, <italic>DRS2</italic>, has been shown to mediate the flipping of a fluorescent analog of PS in isolated late Golgi membranes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000589-Natarajan1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>. <italic>DRS2</italic> mutants have been shown to have defects in protein trafficking at the <italic>trans</italic> Golgi network <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000589-Chen1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000589-Hua1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>, suggesting that membrane asymmetry may be important for intracellular transport events. In humans, mutations in <italic>FIC1</italic>, a putative aminophospholipid translocase, have been found in familial hereditary cholestasis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000589-Bull1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>. However, the mechanism by which this mutation contributes to the pathology has yet to be elucidated. The <italic>C. elegans</italic> genome contains six predicted aminophospholipid translocases known as <italic>tat-1</italic> through <italic>tat-6</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000589-Halleck1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000589-Zullig1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>.

However, the cellular and physiological functions of TAT proteins largely remain to be explored in animal cells.</p><p>Sphingolipids are structurally diverse lipids that can have equally diverse functions. In addition to altering membrane content, sphingolipid metabolites have also been implicated in intracellular and extracellular signaling (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000589-Zheng1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>). The rate-limiting step in sphingolipid biosynthesis is the condensation of serine with fatty acid-CoA to generate 3-ketosphinganine, a precursor to the sphingoid base. This step is catalyzed by serine palmitoyltransferase (SPT) and as the name implies, the fatty acyl-CoA substrate is generally palmitoyl-CoA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000589-Merrill1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000589-Hanada1">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref>.

We were able to conclude that these three mutations are likely loss of function mutations in the <italic>tat-2</italic> gene and that loss of <italic>tat-2</italic> gene function is responsible for the suppressor phenotype based on results from the following three sets of experiments. Firstly, we determined that <italic>tat-2</italic> RNAi phenocopies the mutations. When <italic>tat-2(RNAi)</italic>, but no mmBCFA supplementation, was applied, <italic>elo-5(gk208)</italic> deletion mutants grew to healthy adults in the first generation and produced progeny that were able to develop into egg-laying adults, with the next generation arresting in early larval stages (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen-1000589-t001">Table 1</xref>).

Due to the difficulty of analyzing every type of sphingolipid in <italic>C. elegans</italic> in various mutant backgrounds, we chose to isolate glycosphingolipids in synchronized populations of mutant versus wild-type worms and separate them using thin layer chromatography (TLC) in the manner described in Griffitts et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000589-Griffitts1">&#x0005b;34&#x0005d;</xref>.

The results are displayed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000589-g004">Figure 4</xref>. Analysis of wild-type control worms indicated that C15ISO and C17ISO represent &#x0223c;20&#x02013;30&#x00025; of the fatty acid chain composition in the glycosphingolipids obtained in this assay.

In this report, we identified a novel physiological role for a P-type ATPase in a specific lipid-mediated developmental function. In our previous studies, we showed that depletion of long monomethyl branched-chain fatty acids by mutating the <italic>elo-5</italic> gene causes <italic>C. elegans</italic> to robustly arrest their post-embryonic growth. We show here that loss-of-function mutations in the putative aminophospholipid translocase TAT-2 are able to overcome this arrest, indicating a link between TAT-2 function at cell membranes and C17ISO-mediated growth regulation. A straightforward interpretation of the genetic data is that TAT-2 antagonizes C17ISO function in promoting post-embryonic growth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000589-g005">Figure 5</xref>). Given what is known about this family of P-type ATPases, we speculate that TAT-2 may regulate the function of a lipid of more complex structure that mediates the C17ISO functions. TAT-2 could function to direct the localization of this lipid through its potential lipid translocase activity or through its potential role in secretory and/or endocytic trafficking.</p><fig id="pgen-1000589-g005" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pgen.1000589.g005</object-id><label>Figure 5</label><caption><title>Proposed functional relationship between C17ISO and TAT-2 in promoting post-embryonic growth and development.</title><p>C17ISO is required for post-embryonic growth and development.

We have found that <italic>tat-2</italic> mutations also partially suppress the developmental defects caused by RNAi of a subunit of the serine-palmitoyl transferase complex that is required for sphingolipid biosynthesis. We further determined that ceramide-based glycosphingolipids contain a significant proportion of C15ISO and C17ISO in their fatty acid side chains and that these are depleted in an <italic>elo-5(lf)</italic> background. Although it is currently corollary evidence, these results strongly implicate a functional linkage between mmBCFAs and sphingolipids.</p><p>In a recent report, mutations in <italic>tat-2</italic>, <italic>tat-3</italic> and <italic>tat-4</italic> genes were shown to enhance the sensitivity of <italic>C. elgans</italic> to cholesterol deficiency, implicating the roles of these P-type ATPases in cholesterol metabolism <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000589-Lyssenko1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>. These roles appear to be distinct from the <italic>tat-2</italic> function in C17ISO-mediated growth regulation for two reasons. First, regarding the effects on the animal growth, the enhancement of the defects caused by cholesterol deficiency is the opposite to the rescue of the defects caused by C17ISO depletion or by disrupting sphingolipid biosynthesis. Second, the <italic>tat-2</italic> mutant effect on C17ISO function is highly specific to this particular P-type ATPase; none of the other <italic>tat</italic> genes has any observable effects (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen-1000589-t003">Table 3</xref>).</p><p>Disruption of mmBCFA biosynthesis causes multiple developmental defects that include, but are not limited to L1 growth arrest <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000589-Kniazeva1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>. There is a clear functional difference between the shorter mmBCFA C13ISO and the long chain mmBCFA C17ISO <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000589-Kniazeva2">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>. Low levels of exogenous C13ISO (1 mM) can overcome almost all developmental defects caused by depleting endogenous mmBCFAs in <italic>elo-5</italic> mutants except the L1 growth arrest that can be overcome by feeding a low level of dietary C17ISO or a high level of C13ISO (10 mM). Our data in this study indicate that <italic>tat-2</italic> mutations can suppress the L1 arrest phenotype but not bypass the requirement of mmBCFA for some other developmental functions. In our typical L1 arrest assay, the <italic>elo-5(lf)</italic> mutants were grown on plates supplemented with a low level of C13ISO. These results indicate that C17ISO, not C13ISO, plays the major role in mediating development past the first larval stage in normal worms, and that C13ISO, at a very high concentration, can function as C17ISO for the growth regulatory function. The latter raises the possibility that the <italic>tat-2</italic> mutations may suppress the growth arrest by dramatically changing the dynamics or efficiency of C13ISO. For example, <italic>tat-2</italic> mutant worms may be able to absorb a higher level of exogenously provided mmBCFAs, leading to a higher internal C13ISO concentration. Alternatively, in the absence of TAT-2, the subcellular distribution of C13ISO may be altered through a novel mechanism in such a way that allows the molecule to function as effectively as C17ISO.</p><p>Several lines of evidence argue that the above scenarios are unlikely. First, under conditions without any mmBCFA supplement, <italic>elo-5(-);tat-2(-)</italic> mutants can typically bypass the L1 arrest and grow another generation before the animals arrest at various larval stages due to other developmental defects (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen-1000589-t001">Table 1</xref>). In addition, when <italic>elo-5(RNAi)</italic> is applied to wild-type worms, L1 arrest is observed for the F1 animals. However, when <italic>elo-5(RNAi)</italic> is applied to <italic>tat-2(-)</italic> mutants without any mmBCFA supplementation, the animals can actually propagate multiple generations without developmental arrest (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen-1000589-t001">Table 1</xref>). These results suggest that the <italic>tat-2</italic> mutations are able to overcome the L1 arrest from depleting C17ISO without the presence of C13ISO. Second, we found that internal C13ISO levels were not significantly different between <italic>tat-2</italic> and wild-type worms, arguing against the possibility that a <italic>tat-2</italic> mutation enhances the absorption of C13ISO into animal cells. Third, the C15ISO and C17ISO levels are similar in the <italic>elo-5;tat-2</italic> double mutants when compared to the <italic>elo-5</italic> single mutant, inconsistent with the idea that a <italic>tat-2</italic> mutation can increase the stability of mmBCFAs. Finally, if the C17ISO function in post-embryonic growth is mediated by a glycosphingolipid as we proposed above, the fact that <italic>tat-2</italic> mutations can also suppress the defects in <italic>sptl-1(RNAi)</italic> worms does not appear to be consistent with the effect of the <italic>tat-2</italic> mutations altering the subcellular distribution and effectiveness of C13ISO.</p></sec><sec id="s3b"><title>mmBCFA and TAT-2 function in the intestine to regulate post-embryonic growth</title><p>Our previous work indicated that the mmBCFA C17ISO can move from the intestinal cells of adult worms into their eggs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000589-Kniazeva2">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>. Therefore, mmBCFA produced in a given tissue can potentially move to other tissues, making it difficult to determine in which tissue the mmBCFA is promoting post-embryonic growth. In this study, by expressing the TAT-2 protein behind tissue-specific promoters, we were able to show that expression of TAT-2 in intestinal cells is sufficient and likely necessary for TAT-2 to execute its role in mmBCFA-mediated regulatory function (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen-1000589-t002">Table 2</xref>). The latter statement is supported by the data that the expression of TAT-2 in three other tissues, including the major hypodermal tissue, could not rescue the mutant phenotype. Consistent with this, the mmBCFA biosynthesis enzymes ELO-5, ELO-6 and ACS-1 are all expressed at high levels in intestinal cells. These results suggest that the post-embryonic growth regulatory function of mmBCFAs and TAT-2 primarily occurs in intestinal cells, where exogenic mmBCFAs would have been first absorbed during feeding. However, because depleting C17ISO causes arrest of all post-embryonic tissues including muscle cells and hypodermal cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000589-Kniazeva2">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>, a growth inhibitory signal such as an increase in <italic>cki-1</italic> expression that may be triggered by C17ISO deficiency may be able to spread from intestinal cells to neighboring cells. The nature of this high-order lipid molecule and how this molecule executes this signaling process are currently not known. Additional genetic screening and biochemical analyses are being carried out to search for the answers.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>General <italic>C. elegans</italic> maintenance and strains</title><p>All strains were maintained at 20 &#x000b0;C on OP50 bacteria on nematode growth media (NGM) according to standard protocol <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000589-Brenner1">&#x0005b;35&#x0005d;</xref> unless RNAi treatment was performed.

Glycosphingolipids were resolved with an orcinol/sulfuric acid stain, followed by heating for 120 &#x000b0;C for 10 minutes. As mentioned in the results, a neutral glycosphingolipid standard was used for comparison. After cooling, the brownish-red bands corresponding to glycolipids were scraped from the plate and the bands from the seven lanes were pooled to obtain adequate material for fatty acid extraction and GC analysis.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pgen.1000589.s001"><label>Figure S1</label><caption><p>TAT-2 is primarily expressed in the intestine, spermatheca and excretory cell (A, D, G, J,) DIC images, (B, E, H, K) fluorescence images and (C, F, I, L) merged images of various staged animals expressing the tat-2 Prom::GFP transgene.
