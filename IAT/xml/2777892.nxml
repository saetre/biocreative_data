Although AML cells are characterized by accelerated proliferation and differentiation arrest, MDS cells hyperproliferate when immature but fail to differentiate later and die instead. In agreement with its roles in AML and in immature MDS cells, <italic>EVI1</italic> was found to stimulate cell proliferation and inhibit differentiation in several experimental systems. In contrast, the variant protein MDS1/EVI1 caused the opposite effect in some of these assays. In the present study, we expressed <italic>EVI1</italic> and <italic>MDS1/EVI1</italic> in a tetracycline-regulable manner in the human myeloid cell line U937. Induction of either of these proteins caused cells to accumulate in the G<sub>0</sub>/G<sub>1</sub>-phase of the cell cycle and moderately increased the rate of spontaneous apoptosis. However, when <italic>EVI1-</italic> or <italic>MDS1/EVI1</italic>-expressing cells were induced to differentiate, they massively succumbed to apoptosis, as reflected by the accumulation of phosphatidylserine in the outer leaflet of the plasma membrane and increased rates of DNA fragmentation. In summary, these data show that inducible expression of <italic>EVI1</italic> in U937 cells causes phenotypes that may be relevant for its role in MDS and provides a basis for further investigation of its contribution to this fatal disease.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>ecotropic viral integration site 1</kwd><kwd>apoptosis</kwd><kwd>cell proliferation</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Introduction</title><p>MDS are a group of clonal malignant hematopoietic diseases with an annual incidence of two to 12 per 100,000 and an almost invariably fatal outcome &#x0005b;<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>&#x0005d;.

As reported previously &#x0005b;<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>&#x0005d;, the percentage of cells in S-phase was also somewhat reduced upon removal of tetracycline from U937T cells <xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">(Fig. 3, A and B)</xref>, but this nonspecific effect was significantly milder than the specific effect observed as a result of the induction of <italic>EVI1</italic> or <italic>MDS1/EVI1</italic>.</p><p>To determine whether expression of <italic>EVI1</italic> or <italic>MDS1/EVI1</italic> caused cells to undergo apoptosis, U937T_EVI1-HA, U937T_MDS1/EVI1-HA, and U937T cells were maintained in the presence or absence of tetracycline for 5 days, stained with FITC-conjugated Annexin V and 7-AAD, and analyzed by flow cytometry. Tetracycline removal was found to cause a small but significant proportion of U937T_EVI1-HA cells to undergo apoptosis.

On Days 4 and 6, cellular differentiation was monitored by flow cytometric analysis for the monocyte/macrophage-specific cell-surface marker CD11b. As expected, TPA caused a time-dependent increase in the percentage of CD11b-positive cells in all three investigated cell types (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig"><bold>Fig. 5</bold></xref>). Similarly, removal of tetracycline led to enhanced CD11b expression in U937T_EVI1-HA, U937T_MDS1/EVI1-HA, and U937T cells <xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">(Fig. 5)</xref>. This effect was strongest in U937T_EVI1-HA cells and least pronounced in U937T cells. In the latter cell line, it also declined over time <xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">(Fig. 5)</xref>, probably as a result of overgrowth of differentiated cells by cycling cells. Addition of TPA after tetracycline withdrawal caused an only moderately stronger effect on cell-surface CD11b levels than either treatment alone <xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">(Fig. 5)</xref>. However, a markedly increased rate of cell death was noted in U937T_EVI1-HA and U937T_MDS1/EVI1-HA cells under these conditions. To investigate this phenomenon further, aliquots of the cultures used for CD11b staining were labeled with Annexin V-FITC and 7-AAD and subjected to flow cytometry. Removal of tetracycline led to a moderate increase in apoptosis in U937T_EVI1-HA and U937T_MDS1/EVI1-HA cells but not parental U937T cells on Day 6 of the experiment <xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">(Fig. 5)</xref>. Addition of TPA to tetracycline-containing cultures caused the death of a small proportion of cells of all three types. Notably, a marked and synergistic increase in the numbers of dying and dead cells was observed when U937T_EVI1-HA and U937T_MDS1/EVI1-HA cells were exposed to TPA after transfer to tetracycline-free media <xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">(Fig. 5)</xref>. This effect was absent in parental U937T cells <xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">(Fig. 5)</xref>, demonstrating that it was a specific consequence of the expression of <italic>EVI1</italic> or <italic>MDS1/EVI1</italic>.</p><p>To corroborate these results, U937T_EVI1-HA, U937T_MDS1/EVI1-HA, and U937T cells were cultured as described above and subjected to TUNEL assays on Day 5 of the experiment. Again, a limited proportion of U937T_EVI1-HA cells underwent programmed death upon exposure to TPA or removal of tetracycline, and the combination of these treatments caused a more-than-additive proportion of cells to die (<xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig"><bold>Fig. 6, A</bold> and <bold>B</bold></xref>). Similar effects were seen in U937T_MDS1/EVI1-HA cells but not in parental U937T cells <xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">(Fig. 6, A and B)</xref>. In summary, these data show that the expression of <italic>EVI1</italic> or <italic>MDS1/EVI1</italic> causes massive apoptosis in cells exposed to a differentiation stimulus.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>Overexpression of the <italic>EVI1</italic> gene is presumed to contribute to the pathogenesis of AML and MDS &#x0005b;<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>&#x0005d;.

Of these phenotypes, <italic>EVI1</italic>-mediated augmentation of proliferation and survival is not only likely to be relevant for the role of <italic>EVI1</italic> in AML but may also contribute to the bone marrow hypercellularity observed frequently in MDS. However, more mature MDS cells are impaired in their ability to grow and survive. Indeed, <italic>EVI1</italic> also evoked phenotypes that may be related to this aspect of the disease. Thus, ectopic expression of <italic>Evi1</italic> caused an MDS-like disease in a mouse bone marrow transduction/transplantation system &#x0005b;<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>&#x0005d;. Compared with controls, bone marrow cells from diseased mice yielded reduced numbers of colonies in soft agar containing differentiation-promoting cytokines &#x0005b;<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>&#x0005d;, most likely reflecting impaired growth and/or enhanced rates of cell death. In ovarian epithelial cells, only short-term expression of <italic>EVI1</italic> increased proliferation, whereas long-term expression strongly reduced growth and/or survival &#x0005b;<xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>&#x0005d;. <italic>EVI1</italic> overexpression also delayed proliferation of human myeloid UT-7/GM cells and of erythroid cells from various sources &#x0005b;<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>, <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>, <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>&#x0005d;. Furthermore, when <italic>Evi1</italic>-transduced murine 32Dcl3 or 32DEpo cells were induced to differentiate, they lost their viability in a manner not characterized further &#x0005b;<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>, <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>&#x0005d;, possibly reflecting the phenotype of differentiation failure. In the present investigation, it was found that inducible expression of <italic>EVI1</italic> in the human myeloid cell line U937T caused cells to cease proliferation, accumulate in the G<sub>0</sub>/G<sub>1</sub>-phase of the cell cycle, increase cell-surface CD11b expression, undergo a mild degree of spontaneous apoptosis, and massively succumb to programmed cell death when induced to differentiate.</p><p>Notably, tetracycline withdrawal caused a shift from the S- to the G<sub>0</sub>/G<sub>1</sub>-phase of the cell cycle, not only in U937T_EVI1-HA cells but, as reported previously &#x0005b;<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>&#x0005d;, in parental U937T cells as well. However, the alterations in cell-cycle distribution were significantly more pronounced in U937T_EVI1-HA cells than in the parental line. Therefore, they appear to constitute a genuine and specific consequence of <italic>EVI1</italic> expression. Similarly, removal of tetracycline led to increased cell-surface CD11b expression in U937T_EVI1-HA and in U937T cells. Again, this effect has been reported previously for U937T cells &#x0005b;<xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>&#x0005d; but was less pronounced than in U937T_EVI1-HA cells in our experiments. Although we cannot rule out the possibility of differentiation being induced as a specific consequence of <italic>EVI1</italic> expression in U937T cells, we believe it is more likely a secondary effect of cell-cycle arrest. This assumption is supported by the following observations: First, the extent of the G<sub>0</sub>/G<sub>1</sub> arrest correlated with that of CD11b induction in the cell lines used in this study. Second, a large proportion of U937T cells remained in a cycling state and outgrew the CD11b-positive cells over time, whereas in the U937T_EVI1-HA clones, of which virtually all cells arrested in G<sub>0</sub>/G<sub>1</sub>, cell-surface CD11b expression increased with time. Third, it has been shown previously that cell-cycle arrest caused by experimental expression of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors p21 and p27 or by glutamine depletion was sufficient to induce differentiation of U937 cells &#x0005b;<xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>, <xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>&#x0005d;, suggesting that cell-cycle arrest per se is sufficient to promote differentiation in this cell line.</p><p>The most striking phenotype observed after induction of <italic>EVI1</italic>, namely, the occurrence of massive apoptosis after exposure to a differentiation signal, was entirely absent in parental cells, showing that it was a genuine and specific effect of <italic>EVI1</italic>. Interestingly, TPA caused a higher rate of cell death in U937T_EVI1-HA than in U937T cells even in the presence of tetracycline. This may be a result of basal <italic>EVI1</italic> expression in U937T_EVI1-HA cells in the presence of the antibiotic <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">(Fig. 1A)</xref> and suggests that the ability of <italic>EVI1</italic> to cause apoptosis in cells exposed to differentiation signals is dose-dependent. For the following reasons, we believe it unlikely that the massive apoptosis observed in <italic>EVI1</italic>-expressing, TPA-treated cells was merely a consequence of excessive differentiation signals: i) the rate of apoptosis in <italic>EVI1</italic>-expressing, TPA-treated cells greatly exceeded that observed under any other conditions, including some that led to comparable degrees of CD11b positivity, and ii) the combined effects of <italic>EVI1</italic> induction and TPA treatment on CD11b expression were only moderately greater than their individual effects, but their combined effects on apoptosis were synergistic. Therefore, our results suggest that expression of <italic>EVI1</italic> in U937 cells causes differentiation failure, which is a key feature of MDS.</p><p>Our data appear to contradict those of Kurokawa et al. &#x0005b;<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>&#x0005d;, who reported that constitutive <italic>EVI1</italic> overexpression inhibited TNF-&#x003b1;-induced apoptosis in U937 cells. A possible explanation for this discrepancy is that constitutive expression of <italic>EVI1</italic> may select for transfectants with genetic or epigenetic alterations that cooperate with <italic>EVI1</italic> to promote cellular growth and survival. Alternatively, U937 cells maintained in different laboratories, or U937 and U937T cells, may exhibit certain genetic and/or gene-expression differences a priori. For example, our batch of U937 cells transcribed <italic>HOXA9</italic>, a gene highly expressed in, and important for the function of, hematopoietic stem cells &#x0005b;<xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>&#x0005d;, while U937T cells, for unknown reasons, did not (T. A. Konrad, unpublished results).</p><p>A further, unexpected finding was that <italic>EVI1</italic> and <italic>MDS1/EVI1</italic> evoked qualitatively identical and quantitatively similar cellular phenotypes in our experimental system. Like a number of other related protein pairs, EVI1 and MDS1/EVI1 differ from each other by the absence or presence of an N-terminal PR domain, respectively. In many such protein pairs, the variant lacking the PR domain has oncogenic and the PR-containing variant tumor suppressive properties &#x0005b;<xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>&#x0005d;. Likewise, <italic>Evi1</italic> and <italic>Mds1/Evi1</italic> exhibited opposing biological activities in some previous experiments &#x0005b;<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>&#x0005d;. However, in other assay systems, <italic>Evi1</italic> elicited specific effects, whereas <italic>Mds1/Evi1</italic> was inactive &#x0005b;<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref><xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>&#x0005d;, and in yet others, the expression of the two protein variants had the same biological consequences &#x0005b;<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>, <xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>, <xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>&#x0005d;. Thus, it appears that <italic>EVI1</italic> and <italic>MDS1/EVI1</italic> may act in a similar, different, or opposite manner depending on the biological effect and the experimental system investigated. Notably, however, two recent studies reported that overexpression of <italic>EVI1</italic> and <italic>MDS1/EVI1</italic> had contrary effects on prognosis in ovarian cancer &#x0005b;<xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>&#x0005d; and in AML &#x0005b;<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>&#x0005d;. Comparable data for MDS are not available at the present time. Although our results show that both <italic>EVI1</italic> and <italic>MDS1/EVI1</italic> bring about phenotypes that may be relevant for peripheral blood cytopenia in MDS, their effects on immature MDS cells and/or the prognostic significance of their overexpression in MDS may differ.</p><p>In summary, our study confirms and extends previous results, demonstrating that the effects of <italic>EVI1</italic> on the proliferation, differentiation, and death of hematopoietic cells strongly depend on cell lineage and the stage of maturation. Such seemingly contradictory phenotypes have also been observed after experimental expression of an activated <italic>N-RAS</italic> gene &#x0005b;<xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref><xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref><xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref><xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref><xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>&#x0005d; and probably reflect the multifaceted roles of these genes in the complex pathologies of MDS and AML. In the present study, we established a cell-culture model that recapitulates cellular phenotypes which may be relevant to the pathology of MDS in response to the inducible expression of <italic>EVI1</italic>. Based on our own data and those of others, we propose the following working model for the role of <italic>EVI1</italic> in normal and malignant hematopoiesis: In the former context, <italic>EVI1</italic> promotes the proliferation of immature cells and is down-regulated during differentiation &#x0005b;<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref><xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref><xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>&#x0005d;. In MDS, pathologically activated <italic>EVI1</italic> expression augments proliferation and/or survival of immature malignant cells, but the inability to down-regulate this gene properly causes differentiation failure and consequent peripheral pancytopenia. In AML, additional genetic and/or epigenetic alterations keep cells in a state sufficiently immature to benefit from the growth-promoting properties of <italic>EVI1</italic>, and/or they overcome the failure of more mature, <italic>EVI1</italic>-expressing cells to differentiate.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>This work was supported by grants P17896-B14, P19795-B12, and P20920-B12 (all to R.

On Day 5, DNA breaks were labeled using terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase and FITC-labeled dUTP and quantified by flow cytometry. Similar results were obtained with E10 and M2 cells. (B) Quantitative evaluation of TUNEL experiments. The percentage of TUNEL-positive (dead) cells is indicated for each culture condition. E, M, U: data obtained with U937T_EVI1-HA (<italic>n</italic>&#x0003d;3), U937T_MDS1/EVI1-HA (<italic>n</italic>&#x0003d;4), and U937T cells (<italic>n</italic>&#x0003d;3), respectively. Data have been derived from several independent experiments. Values for U937T_EVI1-HA clones E10 and E14 were pooled, as were values for U937T_MDS1/EVI1-HA clones M2 and M27. Open bars, Cells maintained in the presence of tetracycline and the absence of TPA; hatched bars, cells maintained in the presence of tetracycline and TPA; shaded bars, cells maintained in the absence of tetracycline and TPA; solid bars, cells maintained in the absence of tetracycline and the presence of TPA. Asterisks above bars indicate the level of significance as compared with U937T cells under the same conditions. &#x0002a;, <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05; &#x0002a;&#x0002a;, <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.01; &#x0002a;&#x0002a;&#x0002a;, <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="zgb9990949550006"/></fig></floats-wrap></article>
