Mutations in the tentacles of L4 and L22 confer macrolide resistance in a variety of pathogenic and non-pathogenic bacteria. In <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>, a Lys-to-Glu mutation in L4 and a three-amino-acid deletion in the L22 had been reported. To learn more about the roles of the tentacles in ribosome assembly and function, we isolated additional erythromycin-resistant <italic>E. coli</italic> mutants. Eight new mutations mapped in L4, all within the tentacle. Two new mutations were identified in L22; one mapped outside the tentacle. Insertion mutations were found in both genes. All of the mutants grew slower than the parent, and they all showed reduced <italic>in vivo</italic> rates of peptide-chain elongation and increased levels of precursor 23S rRNA. Large insertions in L4 and L22 resulted in very slow growth and accumulation of abnormal ribosomal subunits. Our results highlight the important role of L4 and L22 in ribosome function and assembly, and indicate that a variety of changes in these proteins can mediate macrolide resistance.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Introduction</title><p>Many antibiotics, including members of the macrolide family, target the bacterial ribosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">Poehlsgaard and Douthwaite, 2005</xref>). Macrolide antibiotics bind to the bacterial large ribosomal subunit near the peptidyltransferase centre (PTC) at the beginning of the peptide exit tunnel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">Schlunzen <italic>et al</italic>., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">Hansen <italic>et al</italic>., 2002a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">Tu <italic>et al</italic>., 2005</xref>). Binding is thought to prevent progression of the growing peptide chain through the exit tunnel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b45">Weisblum, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">Hansen <italic>et al</italic>., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">Tenson <italic>et al</italic>., 2003</xref>), leading to dissociation of the peptidyl tRNA from the ribosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">Menninger and Otto, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">Lovmar <italic>et al</italic>., 2004</xref>). Macrolide-resistant strains can arise via a number of different mechanisms, including methylation of A2058 in 23S rRNA by erm methyltransferases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b45">Weisblum, 1995</xref>); mutation of 23S rRNA residues A2058, A2059 or A2062 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b44">Vester and Douthwaite, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">Franceschi <italic>et al</italic>., 2004</xref>); and specialized efflux pumps (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">Poole, 2007</xref>).</p><p>Mutations in ribosomal proteins L4 and L22 can also cause macrolide resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b46">Wittmann <italic>et al</italic>., 1973</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">Pardo and Rosset, 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">Chittum and Champney, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">Franceschi <italic>et al</italic>., 2004</xref>). Like many other ribosomal proteins, L4 and L22 have globular domains on the surface of the ribosome and long tentacles that extend into the core of the ribosome. The tips of these extended loops form part of the lining of the exit tunnel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">Ban <italic>et al</italic>., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">Nissen <italic>et al</italic>., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">Schuwirth <italic>et al</italic>., 2005</xref>), which is otherwise almost entirely lined by RNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">Ban <italic>et al</italic>., 2000</xref>). In bacterial species other than <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>, a variety of macrolide-resistant mutations in L4 and L22 have been identified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">Franceschi <italic>et al</italic>., 2004</xref>), most of which map to the tentacles of L4 and L22. In <italic>E. coli</italic> only two erythromycin-resistant (ery-R) mutants have been characterized: strain N281 contains a deletion removing Met&#x02013;Lys&#x02013;Arg corresponding to codons 82&#x02013;84 of L22, and strain N282 contains a change from lysine to glutamine at codon 63 of L4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">Apirion, 1967</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b46">Wittmann <italic>et al</italic>., 1973</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">Chittum and Champney, 1994</xref>).</p><p>Ribosomes from <italic>E. coli</italic> strain N282, containing the L4 mutation, bind erythromycin poorly, while ribosomes from N281, containing the mutant L22 protein, can still bind the antibiotic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">Chittum and Champney, 1994</xref>). Furthermore, 50S subunit assembly is inhibited in the L22 mutant at high erythromycin concentrations, but assembly is unaffected in the L4 mutant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">Chittum and Champney, 1995</xref>). The L4 mutant appears to reduce peptidyltransferase activity and increase levels of frameshifting, missense decoding, and readthrough of stop codons; peptidyltransferase activity and decoding are unaffected in the L22 mutant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b46">Wittmann <italic>et al</italic>., 1973</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">O'Connor <italic>et al</italic>., 2004</xref>). Based on erythromycin binding and cryo-EM data of the two known <italic>E. coli</italic> mutants, it was proposed that the L4 mutation narrows the peptide exit tunnel so that erythromycin cannot enter to bind, while the L22 mutation widens the tunnel so that erythromycin binds but the nascent polypeptide is able to pass by (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">Gabashvili <italic>et al</italic>., 2001</xref>).</p><p>Given the variety of L4- and L22-mediated ery-R mutations observed in other species of bacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">Franceschi <italic>et al</italic>., 2004</xref>), we reasoned that it should be possible to isolate additional mutations in the <italic>E. coli</italic> protein genes. If so, then such mutants could be used to further characterize the role of L4 and L22 (particularly, their tentacles) in ribosome assembly and function, as well as the mechanism(s) of macrolide resistance. Starting with <italic>E. coli</italic> strain AB301 (the parent of the two canonical ery-R mutant strains), we selected colonies that could grow on erythromycin. As predicted, we isolated novel mutations in these genes, including five missense and three insertion mutations in the L4 gene and two insertion mutations in the L22 gene. All but one mutation, a 6 bp insertion in L22, mapped within the tentacles of L4 and L22.</p><p>We have analysed the new <italic>E. coli</italic> L4 and L22 mutants, and observed effects on growth rate, peptide elongation rate and 23S rRNA processing. Some of the mutants also accumulated intermediate 45S particles. Our results not only provide insights into the mechanism of erythromycin resistance, but also highlight the important role of L4 and L22 in ribosome function and assembly.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Identification of novel mutations in L4 and L22 genes</title><p>We selected spontaneous ery-R mutants from <italic>E. coli</italic> strain AB301 by spreading cells from overnight cultures on plates containing erythromycin at 150 or 200 &#x003bc;g ml<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>. About half of the colonies (33 out of 63) had a mutation in either L4 or L22. Because only two of the mutations were isolated more than once (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>, column 1), we have almost certainly not saturated the two genes for erythromycin-resistance mutations.</p><table-wrap id="tbl1" position="float"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Properties of AB301 and ery-R derivatives.</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><th rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><th align="left" colspan="2" rowspan="1">Doubling time (min)<xref ref-type="table-fn" rid="tf1-2">b</xref></th><th rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><th rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><th rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><th rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><th align="left" colspan="2" rowspan="1">45S particles?<xref ref-type="table-fn" rid="tf1-5">g</xref></th><th rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><th align="left" colspan="2" rowspan="1">Normalized <sup>14</sup>C-Ery = bound<xref ref-type="table-fn" rid="tf1-7">i</xref></th></tr><tr><th rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><th rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><th align="center" colspan="2" rowspan="1"><hr/></th><th rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><th rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><th rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><th rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><th align="center" colspan="2" rowspan="1"><hr/></th><th rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><th align="center" colspan="2" rowspan="1"><hr/></th></tr><tr><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Strain</th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"># of isolates<xref ref-type="table-fn" rid="tf1-1">a</xref></th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02212;Ery</th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">+Ery</th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Max. ery resist.

In the absence of erythromycin, the doubling time of the parent was approximately 30 min. All of the mutant strains grew more slowly, with doubling times up to four times the wild-type doubling time. Except for L22-105/2, the insertion mutant strains were especially slow. Addition of erythromycin further slowed the growth of all of the L4 missense mutant strains, as well as two of the L4 insertion mutants (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>, column 2, and Fig. S1). The L22 insertion mutants and L4-72/6 grew about as well when erythromycin was included in the media.

However, as expected from the liquid growth analysis, most of the mutants grew more slowly at even the lowest tested concentration of the antibiotic (100 &#x003bc;g ml<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>). We also tested the mutants for cross-resistance to other macrolide antibiotics, including spiramycin, tylosin and troleandomycin. Not surprisingly, all of the mutant strains showed increased resistance to these other macrolides (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>, columns 4 and 5, and data not shown).</p></sec><sec><title>Reversion of L4 and L22 large insertion mutants grown in the absence of erythromycin</title><p>We observed that the insertion mutants (except for L22-105/2) grew much better after they had been grown overnight in antibiotic-free liquid media. Furthermore, when we streaked these mutant strains on LB and LB + erythromycin plates, we observed heterogeneous colony sizes on antibiotic-free plates (Fig. S2). To learn the cause of the faster-growing cells, we amplified and then sequenced the L4 and L22 genes from large and small colonies from each mutant. We found that the large colonies had reverted to the wild-type L4 and L22 sequences and regained sensitivity to erythromycin, while small colonies had retained the original insertions and erythromycin resistance. Thus, it appears that the large insertions were frequently removed from the L4 or L22 by a secondary mutation event that restored the wild-type sequence and growth rate.</p></sec><sec><title>Rate of translation elongation in L4 and L22 mutant strains</title><p>The reduced growth rates of the mutants suggest that ribosome function and/or assembly might be affected by mutations in L4 and L22.

The parent strain had an induction lag of about 130 s (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>, column 6, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02">Fig. 2</xref>), corresponding to an elongation rate of 7.9 amino acids per second.

Thus, the ery-R strains exhibited a decreased rate of chain elongation that roughly correlated with the growth defect. However, the difference is not sufficient to account for the substantially decreased growth rates of some of the mutants. For example, the L4 and L22 large insertion mutant strains have growth rates up to three times as long as that of wild type, but a &#x003b2;-galactosidase synthesis time that was less than twice that of the wild-type strain. It is important to note that this assay reflects the fastest rate of peptide elongation in the cell. If a heterogeneous population of ribosomes were present, the measured rate of elongation would reflect only the rate of the &#x02018;fastest&#x02019; ribosomes, which might in principle be in the minority.</p><fig id="fig02" position="float"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><p>&#x003b2;-Galactosidase induction lag times.

The non-reverting L4-G66C strain and the stable L22-105/2 insertion mutant were grown in LB without erythromycin. The reverting strains were grown using an &#x02018;erythromycin chase&#x02019; protocol (see <italic>Experimental procedures</italic>) consisting of initial growth in the presence of erythromycin and removal of the antibiotic, followed by growth without erythromycin for 2&#x02013;4 doublings.

Precursor 23S (pre-23S) rRNA generated by RNase III cleavage of the primary transcript is 7 nucleotides longer at the 5&#x02032; end than mature 23S RNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">King <italic>et al</italic>., 1984</xref>). We used primer extension analysis to determine the relative amounts of mature and pre-23S in wild-type and mutant strains. Total RNA extracted from cultures growing in mid-log phase was used as template, and an oligonucleotide complementary to the region &#x0223c;75 nucleotides from the 5&#x02032; end of 23S RNA was used as primer. Two bands were detected in all the strains, corresponding in size to mature and pre-23S RNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig04">Fig. 4A</xref>). The fraction of pre-23S in the wild-type strain was 0.03. All of the mutant strains showed increased levels of the precursor form of 23S. The missense and short insertion mutant strains showed two- to almost fivefold increases, while the large insertion mutants showed a more dramatic increase, ranging from five- to sevenfold (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig04">Fig. 4A</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>, column 8). These results indicate that all of the L4 and L22 mutations correlate with a slower rate of rRNA processing.</p><p>The L22-99/15 mutant showed the highest level of pre-23S rRNA (22%), so we analysed it in more detail. To determine which ribosomal particles contain pre-23S, we extracted RNA from the fractions of the high-salt and low-Mg gradient of L22-99/15 ribosomes prepared from cells grown in the absence of erythromycin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig03">Fig. 3</xref>, bottom right) and performed primer extension. We expected to find the pre-rRNA in the 45S particles, but found instead that the RNA colocalized with the 30S region of the gradient (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig04">Fig. 4B</xref>). These results reveal yet another class of precursor 50S particles, sedimenting with the 30S subunits.</p><p>We were concerned that the 23S processing defects were a result of, not a contributor to, the reduced growth rates in the mutant strains. To test the cause&#x02013;effect relationship between growth rate and rRNA processing, we analysed the accumulation of pre-23S rRNA in wild-type cells grown in the presence of fusidic acid. This antibiotic interacts with the EF-G:ribosome complex to prevent release of EF-G&#x02013;GDP, thereby inhibiting protein synthesis. At intermediate levels, the antibiotic decreases the rate of peptide-chain elongation, resulting in slower growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">Bennett and Maal&#x000f8;e, 1974</xref>). Unlike erythromycin, fusidic acid does not bind to the ribosome, and therefore, it should have no direct effect on ribosome biogenesis. Fusidic acid at 50 &#x003bc;g ml<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> changed the doubling time of AB301 from 28 to about 50 min, while at 100 &#x003bc;g ml<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>, the doubling time was further reduced to 70 min. For comparison, we also tested the effect of erythromycin, known to interfere with ribosome biogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">Champney, 2006</xref>). An erythromycin concentration of 50 &#x003bc;g ml<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> resulted in a doubling time of about 95 min. We then extracted total RNA from these cultures as well as the untreated cells, and analysed the 23S content by primer extension as explained above. We detected no significant effect on processing of 23S rRNA in the fusidic acid-treated cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig04">Fig. 4C</xref>). Therefore, we conclude that the accumulation of pre-23S rRNA in the ery-R mutant strains is not caused by the reduced growth rate, but is a direct result of the mutations' effect on ribosome assembly. Interestingly, erythromycin increased the pre-23S content about fivefold (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig04">Fig. 4C</xref>), indicating that the antibiotic's effect on ribosome assembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">Champney, 2006</xref>) includes an inhibition of 23S rRNA processing. A similar effect of erythromycin on processing of 23S rRNA has been seen by S. Champney (pers. comm.).</p></sec><sec><title>Incorporation of mutant L4 proteins into ribosomes</title><p>To confirm that the mutant L4 proteins from the ery-R mutant strains are incorporated into ribosomes, the presence of L4 was analysed by Western analysis of crude ribosomal pellets. We found that L4 was associated with crude ribosomes prepared from all of the mutant strains grown in the presence or in the absence of erythromycin (Fig. S3). In other studies, we have observed that certain mutant L4 proteins (not Ery-R mutations) are present in crude ribosomes but removed during a high-salt wash (our unpublished experiments). We reasoned that, among the L4 mutants, the insertions were most likely to result in an unstable association with 50S particles. Therefore, crude ribosomes from the L4 insertion mutant strains were salt-washed using 1 M NH<sub>4</sub>Cl buffer and analysed by Western analysis. We observed that salt-washing did not affect the association of the mutant proteins with the ribosome (data not shown).</p><p>We were not able to analyse the L22 mutant strains because we do not have an antibody that specifically recognizes this protein.</p></sec><sec><title>Erythromycin binding to mutant ribosomes</title><p>Erythromycin binds to the 50S subunit in a 1:1 stoichiometry in wild-type cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">Pestka, 1974</xref>). It has been shown previously that ery-R ribosomes with a three-amino-acid deletion in L22 (&#x00394;MKR, strain N281) bind erythromycin with high affinity, while ery-R ribosomes with a Lys-to-Glu change at codon 63 in L4 (K63E, strain N282) show a much reduced affinity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b46">Wittmann <italic>et al</italic>., 1973</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">Chittum and Champney, 1994</xref>). To learn more about the structures of the mutant ribosomes, we measured their ability to bind <sup>14</sup>C-labelled erythromycin using a nitrocellulose filter binding assay. As expected, the canonical L4-K63E ribosomes (strain N282) bound erythromycin very poorly (5% of parent AB301). Ribosomes from most of the other L4 mutants also showed little or no binding (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>, column 9). One surprising result was the almost normal binding of erythromycin to ribosomes from the G66S missense mutant (56%) (&#x02018;-Ery&#x02019; in <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>, column 9).</p><p>Among the L22 mutants, ribosomes from the canonical &#x00394;MKR mutant (strain N281) bound erythromycin nearly as well as AB301 (74% of wild type). Ribosomes from the L22-105/2 insertion mutant also bound erythromycin well (68%). However ribosomes from the L22-99/15 insertion mutant showed reduced binding (14% of wild type) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>, column 9). Together, these binding studies indicate that not all L4 mutants fail to bind erythromycin, and not all L22 mutants bind the antibiotic well (see also Fig. S4).</p><p>Interestingly, ribosomes which showed significant binding to erythromycin (L4-G66S, L22-&#x00394;MKR, and L22-105/2 and the wild-type parent AB301) also showed reduced binding when the ribosomes were prepared from cells grown in the presence of the antibiotic (&#x02018;+Ery&#x02019; in <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>, column 9; see also Fig. S4). This reduction might result from an alteration in the structure of ribosomes assembled in the presence of erythromycin that occludes or distorts the antibiotic's target. Alternatively, unlabelled erythromycin bound to ribosomes during cell growth might remain bound to the ribosomes even through a high-salt centrifugation.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>We have identified new mutations in ribosomal proteins L4 and L22 that confer erythromycin resistance in <italic>E. coli</italic>. All mutations are located in the extended loop of L4 or L22, except for a short insertion mutation in the globular domain of L22. Mutations in r-protein L4 were especially easy to isolate; for example, a variety of amino acid substitutions near the tip of the tentacle confer erythromycin resistance. On the other hand, the variety of L22 mutations was much more limited, and included only two insertions. Although we have clearly not saturated the L4 and L22 genes for ery-R mutations, these results are consistent with our studies of ery-R mutants in the bacterium <italic>Deinococcus radiodurans</italic>: in this organism we were also able to isolate many more L4 mutants, including many missense mutations, than L22 mutants, which involved a deletion or an insertion (J. Zengel and L. Lindahl, manuscript in preparation). A variety of L4 and L22 tentacle mutations have also been identified in clinically relevant species of bacteria, including <italic>Haemophilus influenzae</italic>, <italic>Streptococcus pyogenes</italic> and <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">Franceschi <italic>et al</italic>., 2004</xref>). Many of these mutations, particularly for L22, also involve insertions and deletions.</p><p>We observed that the large insertion mutations in L4 and L22 tended to revert to wild-type in the absence of antibiotic. This phenomenon represents an interesting paradigm for antibiotic resistance, in which cells acquire mutations that help them survive in antibiotic medium but then avoid the high fitness cost of maintaining resistance mutations (evident from slower growth rates) by excising the insertion in an antibiotic-free environment. All insertions consist of direct repeats of the DNA sequence, which are removed precisely, presumably by recombination or &#x02018;slippage&#x02019; during DNA replication or repair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">Farabaugh <italic>et al</italic>., 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">Albertini <italic>et al</italic>., 1982</xref>). On the other hand, no obvious repeats flank the insertion sites, so it is more difficult to speculate about the mechanism(s) creating the insertions. However, large insertion mutants could also be isolated in a <italic>recA</italic> mutant strain (our unpublished results), suggesting that the insertions are formed by &#x02018;slippage&#x02019; during DNA replication or repair rather than by homologous recombination. Reversion is not observed in minimal media (our unpublished results), so slow-growth conditions might inhibit this process, possibly because of the lower number of genomes per cell at slow growth.</p><p>The large insertion mutant strains showed accumulation of 45S particles and of pre-23S rRNA containing a seven-nucleotide extension at the 5&#x02032; end. However, in mutant L22-99/15, most of this pre-23S rRNA was found in particles sedimenting at approximately 30S. Thus, it appears that the large insertions affect at least two steps of ribosome maturation. The failure to process pre-23S rRNA normally may be the result of the mutated proteins failing to shape an rRNA conformation that favours removal of the 5&#x02032; extension. We do not know whether the &#x02018;30S&#x02019; and 45S particles represent assembly intermediates or, instead, &#x02018;dead-end products&#x02019; that contain improperly folded rRNA and/or that lack certain ribosomal proteins whose incorporation is stimulated by L4 or L22 in the normal ribosomal assembly pathway(s). Precursor &#x02018;30S&#x02019; and 45S ribosomal particles have been reported previously in wild-type cells by pulse-labelling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">Britten <italic>et al</italic>., 1962</xref>) and in various mutants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">Guthrie <italic>et al</italic>., 1969</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">Tai <italic>et al</italic>., 1969</xref>); &#x02018;30S&#x02019; particles have also been observed in wild-type cells grown in sublethal concentrations of erythromycin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b43">Usary and Champney, 2001</xref>). More recent experiments have shown that similar particles accumulate in <italic>dnaK</italic> mutant cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">El Hage and Alix, 2004</xref>); those particles could be chased into mature 50S (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">El Hage and Alix, 2004</xref>), suggesting that at least some of the various types of particles accumulating in mutant strains are genuine precursors. On the other hand, in both the L22-99/15 mutant and the <italic>dnaK</italic> mutant, the bulk of the pre-23S rRNA is found in the 30S region of sucrose gradients, while in exponentially growing wild-type <italic>E. coli</italic>, most of pre-23S rRNA is contained in 45&#x02013;50S particles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">Lindahl, 1975</xref>). Perhaps there are multiple pathways for ribosome assembly and maturation. Another possibility is that the kinetics of certain events, such as the conversion of pre-23S rRNA to mature 23S rRNA, are not strictly linked to steps in the construction of ribosomal particles.</p><p>In addition to the effect on rRNA processing and ribosome assembly, the ribosome translation rate is also reduced in the ery-R mutants. This observation suggests that changes in the tunnel resulting from mutations in L4 or L22 can be transmitted to the PTC region to affect the rate of peptide elongation. Our assay, measuring the time after induction at which &#x003b2;-galactosidase activity increases, can only reveal the elongation rate exhibited by the fastest ribosomes in the cell. If an L4 or L22 mutation results in a heterogeneous population of ribosomes, a fraction of the ribosomes might translate more slowly than the rate determined.</p><p>Our erythromycin binding assays indicate that one of the L4 mutants (L4-66S) exhibits strong erythromycin binding (56% of the parent), while one of the L22 mutants (L22-99/15) does not (14% of the parent). Therefore, the model of a narrower tunnel in L4 mutants and a widened tunnel in L22 mutants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">Gabashvili <italic>et al</italic>., 2001</xref>) is not supported by our data, at least not as a general model. If the tunnel width is indeed affected by the L4 and L22 proteins, the relationship is complex. A serine at position 66 of L4 behaves differently from aspartic acid, cysteine or arginine at the same position. Given that these substitutions are in a glycine, a flexible amino acid close to the turn in the L4 tentacle, these mutations could have differential effects on L4 structure. On the other hand, all substitutions in position 66 result in similar levels of erythromycin resistance, suggesting that drug resistance can have several different molecular explanations.</p><p>Comparison of the sucrose gradients for L4-G66C and L22-99/15 cells grown with and without erythromycin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig03">Fig. 3</xref>) indicates a significant effect of erythromycin on ribosomal assembly. This is unexpected, because ribosomes from these mutants have a poor affinity for the antibiotic. Perhaps the erythromycin binding site is accessible during ribosome assembly, but after assembly is completed, these mutations cause the site to be occluded so that binding is not detected in the <italic>in vitro</italic> assays. Alternatively, as suggested by Champney and coworkers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">Champney and Burdine, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b43">Usary and Champney, 2001</xref>), the binding site for erythromycin during assembly may be different from the site in mature ribosomes. If this is the case, then our results suggest that the former site is less affected by mutations in L4 and L22. In any case, there is no evidence that erythromycin interacts directly with either protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">Schlunzen <italic>et al</italic>., 2001</xref>), so all of the mutations presumably have an indirect effect.</p><p>The positions of the insertions into the L4 and L22 tentacles are as much as 40&#x02013;70 &#x000c5; from both the erythromycin binding site and the PTC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig05">Fig. 5</xref>). A secondary cascade of modulations in the ribosome structure must therefore cause their effect on peptide growth rate and antibiotic binding. Direct evidence for structural modulations has been observed by cryo-electron microscopy of ribosomes from the original L4-K63E and L22-&#x00394;MKR mutants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">Gabashvili <italic>et al</italic>., 2001</xref>), as well as during stalling of the SecM peptide in wild-type cells in the ribosome exit tunnel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">Mitra <italic>et al</italic>., 2006</xref>). Chemical probing experiments by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">Gregory and Dahlberg (1999)</xref> also identified perturbations in the rRNA structures in L4-K63E and L22-&#x00394;MKR ribosomes. Therefore, it is not surprising that similar effects might emanate from our new mutations in L4 and L22, particularly in the case of the largest insertions. For example, L22 is a small, 110-amino-acid protein, so a 45 bp insertion mutation signifies a significant increase in its size. The variations in the ribosome properties observed in our mutants suggest that these cascades of structural modifications can play out in different ways. Chemical probing or other structure analysis will be required to determine how this extra bulk in the L22 and L4 proteins affects the rRNA structure.</p><fig id="fig05" position="float"><label>Fig. 5</label><caption><p>Model of the L4 and L22 tentacles and key nucleotides in the PTC and PTC-proximal region of the tunnel.
