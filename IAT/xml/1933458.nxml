However, the mechanistic basis for centromere maintenance is unknown. We investigated biochemical properties of CenH3 nucleosomes from <named-content content-type="genus-species">Drosophila melanogaster</named-content> cells. Cross-linking of CenH3 nucleosomes identifies heterotypic tetramers containing one copy of CenH3, H2A, H2B, and H4 each. Interphase CenH3 particles display a stable association of approximately 120 DNA base pairs. Purified centromeric nucleosomal arrays have typical &#x0201c;beads-on-a-string&#x0201d; appearance by electron microscopy but appear to resist condensation under physiological conditions. Atomic force microscopy reveals that native CenH3-containing nucleosomes are only half as high as canonical octameric nucleosomes are, confirming that the tetrameric structure detected by cross-linking comprises the entire interphase nucleosome particle. This demonstration of stable half-nucleosomes in vivo provides a possible basis for the instability of centromeric nucleosomes that are deposited in euchromatic regions, which might help maintain centromere identity.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><sec id="st1"><title/><p>The octameric structure of eukaryotic nucleosomes is universally accepted as the basic unit of chromatin. This is certainly the case for the vast bulk of nucleosomes; however, there have been no reports of the in vivo structure of nucleosomes associated with centromeres. Though centromeres make up only a minute fraction of the genomic landscape, their role in segregating chromosomes during mitosis is essential for maintaining genomic integrity. We report the characterization of centromeric chromatin from <italic>Drosophila</italic> cells, using detailed biochemical, electron microscopic, and atomic force microscopic analyses. Surprisingly, we found that, in striking contrast to bulk chromatin, centromeric nucleosomes are stable heterotypic tetramers in vivo, with one copy of CenH3 (the centromere-specific H3 variant), H2A, H2B, and H4 each, wrapping one full turn of DNA at interphase (the cell growth phase of the cell cycle). This results in nucleosome particles that are only half as high as bulk nucleosomes. These unexpected findings can help account for the dynamic behavior of CenH3-containing nucleosomes, whereby they are deposited promiscuously but are turned over in noncentromeric regions. Our demonstration of the existence of stable half-nucleosomes at centromeres suggests a novel mechanism for maintaining centromere identity.</p></sec></abstract><abstract abstract-type="toc"><p>The centromeric nucleosomes of <italic>Drosophila</italic> are histone tetramers rather than the canonical octomer of the rest of chromatin.

It is unlikely that the 68-kDa band is a homotypic tetramer (CenH3<sub>2</sub>:H4<sub>2</sub>), because the presence of two CenH3s in a homotypic tetramer should yield an approximately 80-kDa, rather than a 68-kDa, product. However, anomalous migration of histone complexes might cause the homotypic form to migrate faster relative to nonhistone protein standards. In either case, the enrichment of a tetramer species as the limit cross-linked product, in contrast to the canonical octameric species in the corresponding bulk chromatin, indicates that the CenH3 nucleosome is highly altered in vivo.</p><p>To exclude the possibility that chromatin extraction or dilution impairs the detection of a canonical CenH3 cross-linking ladder, we also surveyed CenH3 contacts directly within nuclei. The concentration of chromatin is &#x0003e;10-fold higher in situ than in extracts (such as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050218-g002">Figure 2</xref>A and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050218-g002">2</xref>B), therefore chromatin nonhistone protein interactions and internucleosomal interactions are likely to be enriched in situ relative to interactions in extracts. Nuclei were soaked in buffer supplemented with DMS, and cross-linking was allowed to proceed for 1 and 3 h and samples processed as before. Probing with antibody to H3 in bulk chromatin in situ under these conditions detected several non-nucleosomal cross-linked interactions (unpublished data), making assessment of canonical nucleosomal species difficult. Nevertheless, probing in situ cross-linked samples with antibody to CenH3 still yielded only two cross-linked species at 42 kDa and 68 kDa, (assigned &#x0201c;2&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;4&#x0201d;). Within 3 h, as in chromatin extracts, the 68-kDa species was vastly enriched (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050218-g002">Figure 2</xref>C, lanes 2&#x02013;5), suggesting it is the primary stable nucleosomal product in vivo.</p><p>We also performed the same experiment in cells arrested with nocodazole to enrich for highly compacted chromosomes in mitotic cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050218-g002">Figure 2</xref>D). Under these conditions, in addition to the dominant 68-kDa species, we also observed enrichment of a higher&#x02013;molecular weight species (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050218-g002">Figure 2</xref>D, lanes 3 and 4) at approximately 140 kDa. This species is consistent with an octameric product or might reflect a kinetochore protein-associated CenH3 complex. These data suggest that CenH3 cross-linking kinetics in chromatin extracts and in situ are similar, yielding predominantly a CenH3 tetrameric nucleosomal species but no canonical octameric species at interphase.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Reconstituted CenH3:H4:H2A:H2B Particles Display Multiple Histone Contacts In Vitro</title><p>One possible explanation for the apparent absence of higher cross-linked CenH3 species is the relative inability of DMS to cross-link CenH3 homotypic tetramers or octameric species (<italic>Drosophila</italic> CenH3 has three cross-linkable lysines within the core, compared with five lysines within the H3 core). Another possibility is that the antibody fails to recognize its epitope because of epitope masking.

CenH3 nucleosomes display a noncanonical organization enriched in tetramers consisting of CenH3, H4, H2A, and H2B, which wrap no more than 120 bp of DNA. Importantly, AFM measurements of native CenH3 nucleosomes indicate that they are half the height of canonical nucleosomes, providing direct evidence for a tetrameric structure.</p><p>The tetrameric structure of interphase CenH3 nucleosomes is in sharp contrast to canonical nucleosomes, which are octameric, with no compelling evidence that they ever form stable heterotypic tetramers in vivo &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050218-b031">31</xref>&#x0005d;. A problem with envisioning the existence of &#x0201c;half-nucleosomes&#x0201d; has been that this requires splitting octamers into halves, e.g.,, after replication to propagate epigenetic memory &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050218-b036">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050218-b037">37</xref>&#x0005d;. However, no processes are known that can separate the H3-H3 four-helix bundle interface to make half nucleosomes in vivo. In contrast to the replication-coupled assembly of bulk histones, CenH3 nucleosome assembly appears to occur predominantly at the G2/M phase of the cell cycle. CenH3-H4 dimers are assembled in chromatin by a single chaperone protein &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050218-b017">17</xref>&#x0005d;, whereas bulk chromatin is assembled by CAF-1 complexes, which evidently deposit two H3-H4 dimers in rapid succession to form a full nucleosome while tethered to proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) processivity factors at the replication fork &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050218-b038">38</xref>&#x0005d;. Presumably, an untethered chaperone would deposit only single CenH3-H4 dimers. Therefore, we favor the possibility that CenH3 nucleosomes are formed by the deposition of a single CenH3-H4 dimer and a single H2A-H2B dimer, rather than being the product of splitting of pre-existing nucleosomes.</p><p>It is possible that the interphase CenH3 tetramer is also the form that organizes a kinetochore at mitosis. Alternatively, CenH3 tetramers might form higher-order complexes with other kinetochore proteins, or coalesce into octamers&#x02014;either possibility is consistent with our detection of an approximately 140-kDa cross-linked complex in mitotic cells. The assembly of CenH3 octameric nucleosomes in vitro &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050218-b016">16</xref>&#x0005d; and the conservation of residues that would form a CenH3 4-helix bundle &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050218-b002">2</xref>&#x0005d; are consistent with condensation of tetramer pairs to form octamers for mitotic function. But in either case, our inability to detect a higher-order form in unsynchronized cells would require explanation. It is possible that only a small percentage of tetramers coalesce into higher-order structures at mitosis. The number of CenH3 nucleosomes required for kinetochore function might be very few: a single <named-content content-type="genus-species">Saccharomyces cerevisiae</named-content> Cse4-containing nucleosome is evidently sufficient to attach a single microtubule &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050218-b001">1</xref>&#x0005d;. About 25 microtubules attach to typical mammalian kinetochores &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050218-b039">39</xref>&#x0005d;, and in <italic>Drosophila</italic> S2 cells, only about 11 microtubules are used to pull each chromosome to a pole &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050218-b040">40</xref>&#x0005d;. Accordingly, the several thousands of CenH3 nucleosomes that we estimate to be present in a <italic>Drosophila</italic> kinetochore would be 2 to 3 orders of magnitude in excess of the number needed for it to attach to spindle microtubules at mitosis. Therefore, our inability to detect octamers in unsynchronized cells might simply reflect their low abundance relative to tetramers.</p><p>In addition to CenH3 that deposits at centromeres, several lines of evidence suggest that CenH3 can also be deposited on chromosome arms. During the pachytene stage of male meiosis in <named-content content-type="genus-species">Arabidopsis thaliana</named-content>, low levels of CenH3 are detected on chromosome arms &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050218-b041">41</xref>&#x0005d;. In other cases, overexpressed CenH3 is deposited during interphase but is evicted before mitosis. CenH3s are assembled into nucleosomes by chaperones that are not specific for centromeres &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050218-b017">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050218-b042">42</xref>&#x0005d;, and mislocalized CenH3s are removed by proteolytic degradation &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050218-b006">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050218-b007">7</xref>&#x0005d;. In <italic>Drosophila,</italic> CenH3 deposits promiscuously throughout chromosomes during G2, but then is progressively lost from chromosome arms while being retained at centromeric regions &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050218-b006">6</xref>&#x0005d;.

The tetrameric structure of interphase CenH3 nucleosomes should be energetically favorable for eviction relative to octamers. Eviction of canonical histones occurs at high levels throughout chromosome arms during interphase &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050218-b043">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050218-b044">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050218-b045">45</xref>&#x0005d;, and this process should evict tetrameric nucleosomes even more efficiently. Histone turnover is undetectable at pericentric heterochromatin &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050218-b045">45</xref>&#x0005d;, and this might allow for CenH3 accumulation.

By this scenario, the presumptive higher-order form that we detect in cells arrested with nocodazole might be CenH3 that remains at kinetochores after eviction of CenH3 tetramers from chromosome arms.</p><p>We speculate that the quiescence of heterochromatin is an adaptation to prevent the eviction of CenH3 tetramers at the functional centromere. It has long been an enigma as to why centromeres are embedded in heterochromatin, even though they lack heterochromatic features themselves &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050218-b047">47</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050218-b049">49</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050218-b050">50</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050218-b051">51</xref>&#x0005d;.
