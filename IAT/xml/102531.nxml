Although severely repressed in most normal tissues, L1H is still functional, with evidence for both germline and somatic&#x02014;essentially in tumors&#x02014;transpositions. Yet, no transcription factor that could regulate their transcription and be responsible for their transposition has hitherto been described. Here we show that factors belonging to the family of the testis-determining factor gene SRY (the SOX family) can modulate L1H promoter activity over a 10-fold range in a transient transfection assay using a luciferase reporter gene. These effects depend on two functional SRY binding sites which can be identified within the L1H promoter via mobility shift assays. Induction of endogenous L1Hs upon ectopic expression of the SOX11 transcription factor is further demonstrated, thus strengthening the physiological relevance of these new&#x02014;and highly dispersed&#x02014;target sites for the otherwise unclassical transcription factors of the SRY family.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>LINEs are highly reiterated transposable elements (100 000 copies in the human genome), responsible for several genetic diseases through insertional mutagenesis (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd159c1">1</xref>). Their transposition requires synthesis of a full-length genomic RNA (gRNA) followed by its reverse transcription and integration by LINE-encoded proteins. Human LINE-1 (L1H) transcription is driven by an internal promoter located within the first 670 bp of the element (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd159c2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd159c3">3</xref>). It is severely repressed in most somatic, differentiated cells, but induction can be observed in embryonal carcinoma cells and testicular germline tumors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd159c4">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd159c6">6</xref>). DNA methylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd159c7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd159c8">8</xref>) and RNA polymerase III (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd159c9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd159c10">10</xref>) have been tentatively identified as playing a role in L1H promoter activity, but no transcription factor that could regulate transcription of endogenous L1Hs has been described. We show here that the L1H promoter contains two functional binding sites for transcription factors of the SRY family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd159c11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd159c12">12</xref>), namely the SOX factors (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd159c13">13</xref>). SRY, the prototype of the SOX family members, is involved in sex determination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd159c11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd159c12">12</xref>). It is expressed in the urogenital ridge of the embryo and, in the adult, in the testis, hypothalamus and midbrain (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd159c13">13</xref>). Although less extensively studied, other SOX factors also appear to be expressed according to restricted and specific patterns, mainly during development and, in some cases, in the adult (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd159c13">13</xref>). SOX factors all share a conserved domain of about 80 amino acids, the High Mobility Group (HMG) box (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd159c14">14</xref>)&#x02014;also found in the HMG1 and HMG2 proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd159c15">15</xref>). This HMG box is involved in DNA binding and a consensus sequence for SOX binding sites has been derived as A&#x0002f;TA&#x0002f;TCAAA&#x0002f;T (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd159c16">16</xref> and references therein). The two binding sites that we presently identify in the L1H promoter are functional sites, which are required for some of the SOX members to transactivate a luciferase reporter gene driven by the L1H promoter. Ectopic overexpression of one member of the SRY family, SOX11, is further shown to result in a 10-fold transactivation of the endogenous L1Hs in human cells.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Cell culture and transfection</title><p>RD and 293 cells (from the European Collection of Cell Cultures) and NTera2&#x0002f;D1 (from the ATCC) were grown in DMEM&#x02014;in MEM for 293 cells&#x02014;supplemented with 4.5 g&#x0002f;l glucose, 10&#x00025; fetal calf serum and antibiotics, at 37&#x000b0;C in 6&#x00025; CO<sub>2</sub>.

Electrophoretic mobility shift experiments (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd159f1">1</xref>B) confirmed that these A and B sites can specifically interact with the DNA binding domain of SRY&#x02014;the prototype of the SOX family members (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd159c11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd159c12">12</xref>). Indeed, cytoplasmic extracts from <italic>E.coli</italic> cells expressing the SRY HMG box domain (hSRYbox88) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd159c19">19</xref>), but not cytoplasmic extracts from control cells, alter the mobility of DNA probes encompassing the A or B sites. Moreover, mutations introduced into the A (A<sup>m</sup>) or B (B<sup>m</sup>) sites abolished the observed SRY-dependent mobility shift (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd159f1">1</xref>B).</p><p>These observations led us to examine whether L1H promoter-driven transcription is modulated by SOX factors. A luciferase reporter gene (L1<italic>luc</italic>) was therefore constructed by inserting the first 906 nt of L1H &#x0005b;corresponding to the promoter-containing 5&#x02032; UTR of the L1.2A clone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd159c2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd159c17">17</xref>), Fig.&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd159f1">1</xref>A&#x0005d; into a commercially available luciferase vector (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd159f2">2</xref>A and Materials and Methods). The effects of various SOX proteins on L1H promoter activity was then analysed by transient co-transfection of cultured cells with the L1<italic>luc</italic> reporter together with different SOX expression vectors and a &#x003b2;-galactosidase expressing gene (pCMV&#x003b2;, see legend to Fig.&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd159f2">2</xref>) to normalise for transfection efficiency. Cells from the human RD cell line&#x02014;derived from a human embryo rhabdomyosarcoma&#x02014;were used as recipients because they display a very low basal level of endogenous L1H gRNA (T.Tch&#x000e9;nio, unpublished). As illustrated in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd159f2">2</xref>B, the SOX11 factor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd159c20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd159c21">21</xref>) transactivates the L1<italic>luc</italic> reporter gene up to a maximum of 9-fold (at 200 ng DNA), followed by a small decrease at higher DNA concentrations. The SOX3 factor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd159c22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd159c23">23</xref>) also transactivates L1<italic>luc</italic>, but only to a limited extent. Conversely, the human SRY factor reduces L1<italic>luc</italic> expression by ~2-fold, under conditions where no effect of SRY on a control luciferase reporter gene driven by the minimal SV40 promoter (pGL3promoter vector; Promega) was observed (data not shown). This antagonistic effect of SRY on L1H promoter is also manifested by the observed reduction of the SOX11-mediated L1<italic>luc</italic> transactivation in the presence of SRY, not observed with SOX3 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd159f2">2</xref>C). These results are in agreement with the absence of an activation domain in the human SRY factor, and with the reported inhibitory effects of SRY on a recombinant thymidine kinase promoter flanked by SRY binding sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd159c24">24</xref>). Finally, to demonstrate the role of the A and B sites in the SOX-mediated regulation of L1H promoter activity, the A<sup>m</sup> and&#x0002f;or B<sup>m</sup> mutations (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd159f1">1</xref>A) were introduced into the L1<italic>luc</italic> vector. The data in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd159f2">2</xref>D show that both sites are required for full transactivation by the SOX11 protein and that mutation of both sites completely abolishes the SOX11 stimulatory effect.</p><p>To analyse whether ectopic expression of SOX proteins can modulate the level of endogenous L1H gRNA, a transient transfection assay was performed, using the easily transfectable human kidney-derived 293 cells. Endogenous L1H RNAs were then analysed by northern blot, upon hybridisation with an antisense L1H single-stranded DNA probe (Materials and Methods). NTera2&#x0002f;D1 embryonal carcinoma cells&#x02014;one of the only few human cell lines in which high level expression of a discrete 6 kb L1H gRNA can be detected by northern blot analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd159c6">6</xref>)&#x02014;as well as murine NIH 3T3 cells (devoid of L1H genetic elements) were used as controls (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd159f3">3</xref>A). Although endogenous L1H transcripts are not highly expressed in the 293 cell line, transient transfection of the cells with the CMV-<italic>SOX11</italic>, but not the CMV-<italic>SRY</italic>, vector resulted in an increase in the accumulation level of the 6 kb L1H-hybridising transcript (2&#x02013;3-fold, Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd159f3">3</xref>A and data not shown). To further confirm these results, stably transfected SOX-expressing cells were established. A vector expressing SOX11 under the control of the SV40 early promoter (pJ3&#x003a9;<italic>SOX11</italic> vector) was introduced by transfection into RD cells together with a vector for the selectable neomycin gene. G418-resistant clones were then isolated, and those expressing stably integrated SOX11 vectors (about one-third of the transfected clones) were characterised by Southern and northern blot analyses (data not shown). As illustrated for independent clones by the northern blot shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd159f3">3</xref>B, L1H gRNAs&#x02014;as detected using the antisense L1H probe&#x02014;were induced in the SOX11 expressing cells, ~10-fold as compared to control transfected cells. A heterogenous population of L1H-hybridising transcripts of larger size, most probably originating from inefficient transcription termination of endogenous L1Hs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd159c25">25</xref>), was also induced upon SOX11 expression, resulting in the observed smear of high molecular weight RNAs. No antisense transcripts were detected in these clones using, under identical experimental conditions, a sense L1H single-stranded DNA probe (data not shown), thus indicating that the transcripts observed above do originate from L1Hs.</p></sec><sec><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>The present results therefore show that the human L1H promoter not only contains SRY binding sites, <italic>sensu stricto</italic>, but that these sites are indeed &#x02018;functional&#x02019;, being responsible for the efficient transactivation of the L1H promoter by a SOX family member. Although one would expect the rather degenerate consensus SOX binding sequence (i.e. A&#x0002f;TA&#x0002f;TCAAA&#x0002f;T) to be frequently encountered, and despite the limited sequence specificity for SOX binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd159c26">26</xref>), functional SOX sites have been identified in only a limited number of genes (including the M&#x000fc;llerian Inhibiting Substance, the FGF4, the collagen II and the TCR&#x003b1; genes; reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd159c13">13</xref>). It has been suggested that the much more stringent conditions required for a SOX &#x02018;effect&#x02019; versus &#x02018;binding&#x02019; is due in part to a recognition sequence that extends beyond the consensus sequence and&#x0002f;or the ability of SOX to make protein&#x02013;protein contacts with other DNA binding proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd159c13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd159c16">16</xref>). In fact, it has been proposed that the mode of action of the SRY factor and related proteins is to organise the local chromatin structure&#x02014;in part <italic>via</italic> their ability to bend DNA in a sequence-dependent manner&#x02014;and assemble other DNA-bound factors into biologically active, sterically defined multiprotein complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd159c27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd159c28">28</xref>). In the case of L1H, no conspicuous binding site for other known transcription factors has yet been identified in the promoter sequence, except those previously characterised for the YY1 protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd159c29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd159c30">30</xref>). Being ubiquitously expressed, it is very unlikely that YY1 accounts for the restricted pattern of L1H expression as observed <italic>in vivo</italic>, but it remains plausible that it cooperates with SOX factors to assemble the transcription machinery at the L1H promoter, all the more as YY1 is itself an &#x02018;architectural&#x02019; factor which can promote DNA binding to the nuclear matrix (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd159c31">31</xref>). Whatever the underlying mechanisms for the SOX-mediated transactivation, a noteworthy consequence of the present investigation is that the high copy number of full-length L1H transposable elements results <italic>de facto</italic> in the dispersion of thousands of functional SOX binding sites in the genome. Targeting of SOX factors to these sites may therefore result not only in the activation of the LINE elements themselves, but also in that of nearby genes, possibly via SOX-mediated &#x02018;architectural&#x02019; effects. This would constitute an unexpected and important additional consequence of transposon mobility on genome structure and gene regulation. Finally, an important issue will be to determine whether SOX factors, such as SOX11, are expressed <italic>in vivo</italic> in the human germ cell lineage, that could activate L1H elements. In fact, several SOX family members are likely to be expressed in these cells, as suggested by the demonstrated expression of various SOX factors in germline-derived tumours (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd159c32">32</xref> and references therein). Such germline-expressed SOX factors would be serious candidates as essential determinants of L1H activity <italic>in vivo</italic> under both normal and pathological conditions.</p></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="display-objects"><title>Figures and Tables</title><fig id="gkd159f1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p> SRY binding sites in the L1H promoter.

(<bold>B</bold>) Effects of varying amounts of transfected SOX expression vectors on L1<italic>luc</italic> reporter gene activity. About 10<sup>6</sup> human RD cells were cotransfected with 20 ng of luciferase reporter gene, the indicated amount of CMV-<italic>SOX</italic> expression vector, 200 ng of pCMV&#x003b2; plasmid, complemented to a total of 1 &#x000b5;g of DNA with CMV-none. Luciferase activity was normalised to &#x003b2;-galactosidase activity measured in the same cell extracts. L1H promoter activity is expressed relative to that measured upon transfection with CMV-none set as 1 &#x0005b;and similarly for L1<italic>luc</italic> in (C) and (D)&#x0005d;. Luciferase activity for a control <italic>luc</italic> vector lacking the L1H promoter was &#x0003c;3&#x00025; that of L1<italic>luc</italic>. Standard deviations are indicated by errors bars. (<bold>C</bold>) Interactions between SOX proteins. RD cells were cotransfected with L1<italic>luc</italic> as in (B) with 800 ng of control plasmid (CMV-none) or with 200 ng CMV-<italic>SOX11</italic> plus 600 ng of one of the three following plasmids: CMV-none, CMV-<italic>SOX3</italic> or CMV-<italic>SRY</italic>; n indicates the number of independent experiments, and errors bars are standard deviations. (<bold>D</bold>) Effect of mutations within the A and B sites on SOX11-mediated L1H promoter activation. RD cells were cotransfected as in (B) with the L1<italic>luc</italic> reporter gene or one of its mutated A<sup>m</sup> and&#x0002f;or B<sup>m</sup> derivative, and 800 ng of either CMV-none or CMV-<italic>SOX11</italic>. pGL3 is a luciferase reporter gene under the control of the minimal SV40 promoter (Promega); n indicates the number of independent experiments, and errors bars are standard deviations.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="gkd15902"/></fig><fig id="gkd159f3"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p> Sox11-mediated transactivation of endogenous L1Hs. (<bold>A</bold>) Northern blot analysis of transiently transfected 293 cells. RNA (15 &#x000b5;g per lane) extracted from cells transiently transfected with either pCMV&#x003b2; (C), CMV-<italic>SRY</italic> (SRY) or CMV-<italic>SOX11</italic> (SOX) were electrophoresed together with NTera2&#x0002f;D1 (N) and NIH 3T3 (T) RNA samples, and hybridised with an antisense (nucleotide 906 to 1) L1H single-stranded DNA probe. Arrows indicate the position of L1H gRNA. The numbers indicate the relative level of L1H gRNA as normalised to the amount of 3-glyceraldehyde phosphate deshydrogenase transcripts. Exposure time was 3 days. In this experiment, the percentage of transfected cells was close to 20&#x00025; as deduced from the percentage of &#x003b2;-galactosidase-positive cells in the transfection with pCMV&#x003b2;.
