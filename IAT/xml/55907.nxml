Although the protein components of the U2 snRNP have been identified, their individual contributions to function are poorly defined. <italic>In vitro</italic> studies with the <italic>Drosophila</italic> and human proteins suggest that two of the U2 snRNP-specific proteins, U2A&#x02032; and U2B&#x02033;, function exclusively as a dimer. In <italic>Drosophila</italic> the presence of the U2B&#x02033; counterpart, Sans-Fille (SNF), in the U2 snRNP is dispensable for viability, suggesting that SNF is not necessary for U2 snRNP function <italic>in vivo</italic>.

Moreover, although we demonstrate that several domains in the SNF protein are important for the interaction with the <italic>Drosophila</italic> U2A&#x02032; protein, including a redundant domain at the normally dispensable C-terminus, we find that U2A&#x02032; does not require heterodimer formation for either its vital function or U2 snRNP assembly. Thus together these data demonstrate that in <italic>Drosophila</italic> U2A&#x02032; has an essential function that&#x000a0;is unrelated to its role as the partner protein of SNF&#x0002f;U2B&#x02033;.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>RNA splicing is carried out by the spliceosome, a large catalytic RNA&#x02013;protein machine that consists of smaller complexes called &#x02018;small nuclear ribonucleoprotein particles&#x02019; (U1, U2, U4&#x0002f;U6 and U5 snRNPs) and many non-snRNP proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke507c1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke507c2">2</xref>). The spliceosome, which assembles <italic>de novo</italic> on each intron, both selects the intron&#x0002f;exon boundaries and catalyzes the splicing reaction. Identification of the intron&#x0002f;exon boundaries takes place during the earliest steps in spliceosome assembly, which include recruitment of the U1 and U2 snRNPs to the pre-mRNA. Each snRNP is made up of a unique snRNA backbone and a group of proteins, some of which are unique to each snRNP. Although the identities of many of the snRNP proteins are known, their individual contributions to spliceosome function remain poorly defined.</p><p> The recent completion of the <italic>Drosophila</italic> genome sequence has revealed a remarkable conservation between the <italic>Drosophila</italic> and human versions of the known snRNP proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke507c3">3</xref>). One notable exception is that a single <italic>Drosophila</italic> protein, encoded by the <italic>sans-fille</italic> (<italic>snf</italic>) gene, is the counterpart of both the U1 snRNP protein U1A and the U2 snRNP protein U2B&#x02033; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke507c4">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke507c7">7</xref>). Vertebrate U1A and U2B&#x02033; proteins have been the focus of many studies because they are nearly identical in sequence yet have different RNA-binding activities: U1A binds to stem&#x02013;loop II of U1 snRNA, while U2B&#x02033;, when bound to its partner protein U2A&#x02032;, binds to stem&#x02013;loop IV of U2 snRNA (see for example <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke507c8">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke507c18">18</xref>). The <italic>Drosophila</italic> Sans-Fille (SNF) protein behaves like U1A and binds U1, but not U2 snRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke507c4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke507c5">5</xref>). Unlike the human U1A protein, however, and like the U2B&#x02033; protein, SNF can be induced to bind U2 snRNA by the addition of either fly extract or the human U2A&#x02032; protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke507c5">5</xref>). Thus it is likely that a protein homologous to U2A&#x02032; is necessary for the U2-specific RNA-binding activity of SNF. In previous studies, we showed that <italic>snf</italic> is essential for viability; a deletion of the entire open reading frame results in an embryonic lethal phenotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke507c6">6</xref>). However, a number of mutations are viable, one of which, <italic>snf</italic><sup>5MER</sup>, is particularly noteworthy because it encodes a protein that is not stably associated with U2 snRNPs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke507c7">7</xref>). The fact that animals carrying this mutation are viable suggests that SNF is not critical for U2 snRNP function. Although these studies suggest that the SNF&#x0002f;U2A&#x02032; heterodimer will also play a non-essential role in splicing, it is not known whether the two <italic>Drosophila</italic> proteins are dependent on each other for snRNP incorporation and&#x0002f;or function <italic>in vivo</italic>. With the identification of a single U2A&#x02032;-like protein in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> genome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke507c3">3</xref>), we can now investigate the relationship between these two proteins <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p><p> Here we report that the <italic>Drosophila</italic> U2A&#x02032; protein physically interacts with SNF <italic>in vivo</italic> and, like its human counterpart, is U2 snRNP specific. Surprisingly, we demonstrate that loss of function causes lethality. Thus our studies suggest that, contrary to the situation with SNF, the presence of U2A&#x02032; within the U2 snRNP is essential. Moreover, we find that although SNF and U2A&#x02032; do form heterodimers, U2A&#x02032; does not require heterodimer formation for either its vital function or U2&#x000a0;snRNP assembly. Together, these unexpected results demonstrate that in <italic>Drosophila</italic> U2A&#x02032; has at least one function in the cell that is unrelated to its role as the partner protein of SNF.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>U2A&#x02032; cloning</title><p>cDNAs corresponding to the <italic>Drosophila</italic> U2A&#x02032; protein were identified by TBLASTN searches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke507c19">19</xref>) of the Berkeley <italic>Drosophila</italic> Genome EST database using the human U2A&#x02032; sequence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke507c20">20</xref>).

This 265 amino acid protein has a structure that is nearly identical to the human protein, with sequence similarity extending over the entire length of the protein (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke507f1">1</xref>A and B). U2A&#x02032; is composed primarily of six leucine-rich repeat motifs (LRRs); these motifs are most often found in tandem arrays and are believed to mediate protein&#x02013;protein interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke507c26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke507c27">27</xref>). In addition to the LRR repeating units, U2A&#x02032; contains flanking N- and C-terminal non-LRR domains. While the overall conservation between the human and fly proteins is striking, it is interesting to note that the non-LRR C-terminal domain is the least conserved domain and it is the only portion of the human protein identified as dispensable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke507c28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke507c29">29</xref>). Based on this extensive sequence similarity and the functional data, presented below, we have named this <italic>Drosophila</italic> gene <italic>U2A</italic>. To avoid confusion with the human protein, we shall refer to the <italic>Drosophila</italic> protein as dU2A&#x02032;.</p><p> As a first step in establishing that we have identified the functional counterpart of the human U2A&#x02032; protein, we raised antisera against the full-length protein (see Materials and Methods) and used this reagent to verify that dU2A&#x02032; is a snRNP protein (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke507f1">1</xref>C). As in previous studies, U1 and U2 snRNAs were co-immunoprecipitated from whole cell extracts with antibodies directed against the SNF protein, demonstrating that SNF is incorporated into both U1 and U2 snRNPs. In contrast, the dU2A&#x02032;-specific antibody precipitates U2 snRNA without precipitating significant amounts of U1 snRNA. Thus, we conclude that dU2A&#x02032; is a U2 snRNP-specific protein.</p></sec><sec><title>dU2A&#x02032; is essential for viability</title><p>To gain insight into the function of the dU2A&#x02032; protein, we sought to identify <italic>U2A</italic> mutations. <italic>U2A</italic> was first mapped to the 43E region of the second chromosome and then to a smaller region, which includes several essential genes previously described by Heitzler <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke507c22">22</xref>). The embryonic lethality of one of these mutations, <italic>l(2)43Ee</italic><italic><sup>1</sup></italic>, was rescued by a 4 kb genomic transgene that contains only the <italic>U2A</italic> transcription unit, demonstrating that dU2A&#x02032; is encoded by the <italic>l(2)43Ee</italic> gene.</p><p> Sequencing of the <italic>U2A</italic> gene from the <italic>l(2)43Ee</italic><italic><sup>1</sup></italic> mutant chromosome revealed a single nucleotide substitution that results in conversion of Y29 to a stop codon within LRR 1 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke507f1">1</xref>A and B), indicating that <italic>l(2)43Ee</italic><italic><sup>1</sup></italic> is a complete loss-of-function mutation. Homozygous mutant animals complete embryogenesis but do not hatch (data not shown). Interestingly, a significant amount of maternally provided protein remains in homozygous mutant embryos as they are dying (data not shown), suggesting that by the end of embryogenesis the maternal stores of dU2A&#x02032; protein are no longer sufficient to support development. Similar late embryonic lethal phenotypes are caused by the loss of other splicing factors, including the orthlog of another U2 snRNP-specific protein, SF3a<sup>60</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke507c30">30</xref>). Nevertheless, the finding that <italic>U2A</italic> mutations are lethal was unexpected because we previously showed that SNF, the presumed binding partner of dU2A&#x02032;, is not essential for U2 snRNP function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke507c7">7</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Several domains in SNF are important for the interaction with dU2A&#x02032;</title><p>Although the human U2A&#x02032; protein associates with SNF <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke507c5">5</xref>), our finding that the<italic>U2A</italic><italic><sup>1</sup></italic> mutation is lethal raised questions about the biological relevance of this interaction. To ascertain whether the dU2A&#x02032; protein associates with SNF <italic>in vivo</italic>, we tested for protein&#x02013;protein interactions in <italic>Drosophila</italic> whole cell extracts and found that SNF and dU2A&#x02032; were co-immunoprecipitated by antibodies to either dU2A&#x02032; (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke507f2">2</xref>) or SNF (data not shown). Hence, SNF and dU2A&#x02032;, like their yeast and human counterparts, heterodimerize <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p><p> SNF, like its human counterparts, contains two RRM domains (for RNA recognition motif) separated by a short linker region. As illustrated in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke507f2">2</xref>, the sequence of the N-terminal RRM (amino acids 1&#x02013;84) and the C-terminal RRM (amino acids 143&#x02013;216) share significant similarity with both human proteins. Studies with the human proteins have shown that the N-terminal RRM of U2B&#x02033; is sufficient for heterodimer formation <italic>in vitro</italic> and have identified two critical U2B&#x02033;-specific amino acids within this region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke507c9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke507c10">10</xref>). In agreement with the mutagenesis data, information from the crystal structure of the U2B&#x02033;&#x02013;U2A&#x02032;&#x02013;RNA ternary complex indicates that this motif contacts U2A&#x02032; directly. Interestingly, SNF has only one (E21) of these two critical amino acids; the other is identical to U1A (K25) (see Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke507f2">2</xref>A and B). In previous studies we tested the importance of this mixed motif by converting it to a U1A-like sequence with an E21D mutation and testing its function <italic>in vivo</italic>. Analysis of the SNF<sup>E21D</sup> protein revealed that it retained its ability to be incorporated into both snRNPs, raising the question of whether the putative U2A&#x02032;-binding site is necessary in <italic>Drosophila</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke507c7">7</xref>). Here, we extend these studies by directly asking whether the E21D mutation interferes with heterodimer formation. As illustrated in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke507f2">2</xref>C, dU2A&#x02032; and SNF<sup>E21D</sup> could be co-immunoprecipitated from fly extracts in which the sole source of SNF protein is the mutant <italic>snf</italic><italic><sup>E21D</sup></italic> transgene. Thus, the mixed motif in the U2A&#x02032;-binding region is not essential for either heterodimer formation or U2 snRNP incorporation.</p><p> To better define the domain(s) of SNF responsible for the interaction with dU2A&#x02032;, we used the yeast two-hybrid system (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke507f3">3</xref>). Although both the full-length SNF<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> and SNF<sup>E21D</sup> constructs interacted with dU2A&#x02032; in yeast, we observed a decrease in reporter gene activity with the SNF<sup>E21D</sup> construct relative to the wild-type construct. Thus, in the context of the full-length protein, the mixed motif in the U2A&#x02032;-binding region influences but is not essential for heterodimer formation.</p><p> These studies, however, do not necessarily indicate a difference between the human and <italic>Drosophila</italic> proteins because the studies which identified E21 as a key residue for U2A&#x02032; binding were carried out using a truncated form of U2B&#x02033; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke507c9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke507c10">10</xref>). To explore the possibility that E21 is only essential for heterodimer formation in the absence of the C-terminal end of the protein, we designed both a &#x02018;wild-type&#x02019; and a mutant version of a similarly truncated protein, called SNF<sup>&#x00394;</sup><sup>Kpn</sup>, and tested their ability to interact with dU2A&#x02032; in yeast (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke507f3">3</xref>). Whereas the SNF<sup>&#x00394;</sup><sup>Kpn</sup> construct activated the reporter constructs, an E21D mutation in this deletion construct abolished the interaction with dU2A&#x02032;. Thus, we conclude that the mixed motif in the U2A&#x02032;-binding region is only essential for heterodimer formation in the absence of the otherwise dispensable C-terminal end of the protein. Moreover, we find that the C-terminal RRM of SNF by itself mediates an interaction with dU2A&#x02032; in yeast (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke507f3">3</xref>). Together these studies demonstrate that SNF has two redundant dU2A&#x02032; interaction domains: the previously identified motif in the N-terminal RRM and a second, previously unidentified, domain in the C-terminal RRM of the protein.</p><p> During the course of these studies, we also examined whether dU2A&#x02032; could associate with the SNF<sup>5MER</sup> mutant protein, which we know from earlier studies is not stably associated with U2 snRNPs <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke507c7">7</xref>). <italic>snf</italic><italic><sup>5MER</sup></italic> has a five amino acid change in the RNA binding specificity domain of SNF that changes it from a U2B&#x02033;-like to a U1A-like sequence (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke507f2">2</xref>A and B). <italic>In vivo</italic> the <italic>snf</italic><italic><sup>5MER</sup></italic> mutation converts SNF from a bifunctional protein to a U1 snRNP-specific protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke507c7">7</xref>). Surprisingly, in co-immunoprecipitation experiments from <italic>Drosophila</italic> extracts in which the sole source of SNF protein is the <italic>snf</italic><italic><sup>5MER</sup></italic> mutant transgene we failed to detect an interaction between SNF<sup>5MER</sup> and dU2A&#x02032; (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke507f2">2</xref>). Furthermore, no interaction between SNF<sup>5MER</sup> and dU2A&#x02032; was detectable in yeast (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke507f3">3</xref>). Together, these studies demonstrate that the U2B&#x02033;-like sequence within the &#x02018;RNA binding specificity domain&#x02019; is critical for the interaction with dU2A&#x02032;. Based on information from the crystal structure of the U2B&#x02033;&#x02013;U2A&#x02032;&#x02013;snRNA ternary complex, the region of the protein mutated in <italic>snf</italic><italic><sup>5MER</sup></italic> contacts the RNA without contacting the U2A&#x02032; protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke507c18">18</xref>). Thus, it is likely that the <italic>snf</italic><italic><sup>5MER</sup></italic> mutation interferes with dU2A&#x02032; binding indirectly.</p></sec><sec><title><italic>snf</italic> mutations that do not associate with dU2A&#x02032; are viable</title><p>We have previously shown that animals carrying the <italic>snf</italic><italic><sup>5MER</sup></italic> mutation are viable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke507c7">7</xref>). Because the <italic>snf</italic><italic><sup>5MER</sup></italic> mutation interferes with heterodimer formation, we conclude that SNF&#x0002f;dU2A&#x02032; heterodimer formation is not essential for viability.</p><p> Based on the results of the yeast two-hybrid experiments, the <italic>snf</italic><italic><sup>E21D</sup></italic><sup>&#x0002b;</sup><sup>&#x00394;</sup><italic><sup>KPN</sup></italic> complex mutation also eliminates heterodimer formation and therefore it is likely that animals carrying this mutation will also be viable. Using a <italic>snf</italic> minigene construct previously shown to replicate the high level expression of the endogenous locus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke507c7">7</xref>), we generated transgenic animals bearing <italic>snf</italic><italic><sup>E21D</sup></italic><sup>&#x0002b;</sup><sup>&#x00394;</sup><italic><sup>KPN</sup></italic>. Control <italic>snf</italic><sup>&#x00394;</sup><italic><sup>KPN</sup></italic> transgenic animals were also generated. Each line was then assayed for function by determining their ability to complement the lethal <italic>snf</italic> null allele <italic>snf</italic><italic><sup>J210</sup></italic>. In these assays, a single copy of the <italic>snf</italic><italic><sup>E21D</sup></italic><sup>&#x0002b;</sup><sup>&#x00394;</sup><italic><sup>KPN</sup></italic> mutant transgene (or the control <italic>snf</italic><sup>&#x00394;</sup><italic><sup>KPN</sup></italic> transgene) provided sufficient activity to complement the lethal phenotype of <italic>snf</italic><italic><sup>J210</sup></italic> (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="gke507tb1">1</xref>). Because the SNF-specific antibody recognizes only the C-terminal RRM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke507c6">6</xref>), we were not able to confirm whether this mutant protein no longer interacts with dU2A&#x02032; <italic>in vivo</italic> or whether it is included in U2 snRNPs. However, the fact that a single copy of this mutant transgene fully rescues the <italic>snf</italic><italic><sup>J210</sup></italic> lethal phenotype indicates that elimination of both dU2A&#x02032; binding sites does not interfere with survival of the organism.</p><p> Based on these studies, we conclude that dU2A&#x02032;&#x0002f;SNF heterodimer formation is not essential for viability in <italic>Drosophila</italic>. The viable phenotype of these heterodimer-deficient animals therefore demonstrates that dU2A&#x02032; can accomplish its vital function without SNF.</p></sec><sec><title>Assembly of dU2A&#x02032; into U2 snRNPs is independent of SNF</title><p>Our finding that dU2A&#x02032; has an essential function that is independent of SNF led us to investigate whether incorporation of dU2A&#x02032; into the U2 snRNP is dependent on SNF. We therefore tested whether U2A&#x02032; could associate with U2&#x000a0;snRNAs in extracts made from animals homozygous for a number of different <italic>snf</italic> mutations, including <italic>snf</italic><italic><sup>E21D</sup></italic><sup>&#x0002b;</sup><sup>&#x00394;</sup><italic><sup>KPN</sup></italic> and <italic>snf</italic><italic><sup>5MER</sup></italic> (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke507f4">4</xref>). Remarkably, dU2A&#x02032; and U2 snRNA can be co-immunoprecipitated from mutant fly extracts in which the sole source of SNF protein was provided by the <italic>snf</italic><italic><sup>E21D</sup></italic><sup>&#x0002b;</sup><sup>&#x00394;</sup><italic><sup>KPN</sup></italic> mutant transgene. Similarly, we find that dU2A&#x02032; associates with U2&#x000a0;snRNAs in <italic>snf</italic><italic><sup>5MER</sup></italic> mutant extracts. Together, these studies establish that dU2A&#x02032; incorporation into U2 snRNP does not depend on SNF&#x0002f;dU2A&#x02032; heterodimer formation. Furthermore, as an association between the mutant SNF<sup>5MER</sup> protein and U2&#x000a0;snRNAs is not detectable under similar immunoprecipitation conditions, we conclude that dU2A&#x02032; can incorporate into U2 snRNPs in the absence of SNF.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>Our <italic>in vivo</italic> analysis of the <italic>Drosophila</italic> U2A&#x02032; homolog (dU2A&#x02032;) challenges the prevailing view that U2A&#x02032; is simply a cofactor of SNF&#x0002f;U2B&#x02033;. Although SNF, like its human U2B&#x02033; counterpart, requires a U2A&#x02032;-like protein to bind U2 snRNA <italic>in vitro</italic>, we find that <italic>in vivo</italic>, dU2A&#x02032; can assemble into U2 snRNP through a SNF-independent mechanism. How does dU2A&#x02032; assemble into U2 snRNP in the absence of SNF? dU2A&#x02032; is almost entirely composed of protein-interaction motifs and has no recognizable RNA-binding motifs. Nevertheless, <italic>in vitro</italic> studies with human U2A&#x02032; protein have shown that U2A&#x02032; is capable of binding stem&#x02013;loop IV of U2 snRNA as an isolated protein, albeit weakly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke507c28">28</xref>). Consistant with this possibility, the crystal structure of the U2B&#x02033;&#x02013;U2A&#x02032;&#x02013;RNA ternary complex shows that the U2A&#x02032; protein makes direct contact with U2&#x000a0;snRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke507c18">18</xref>). Thus it is possible that U2A&#x02032; can bind U2 snRNA on its own and this activity is sufficient for snRNP assembly <italic>in&#x000a0;vivo</italic>. However, studies with <italic>Xenopus</italic> oocytes have shown that stem&#x02013;loop IV of U2 snRNA is itself dispensable for splicing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke507c8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke507c31">31</xref>). If, as our studies suggest, U2A&#x02032; is essential for splicing, then RNA binding to stem&#x02013;loop IV is unlikely to be the only means by which this protein can assemble into U2&#x000a0;snRNPs. Further studies identifying the binding partners of the <italic>Drosophila</italic> U2A&#x02032; protein will provide insight into how dU2A&#x02032; is assembled into the appropriate snRNP.</p><p> Although dispensable for targeting dU2A&#x02032; to the appropriate snRNP, the ability of SNF and dU2A&#x02032; to form a heterodimer has been conserved in evolution. Given that several domains in the SNF protein are important for heterodimer formation, it is tempting to speculate that targeting SNF to U2 snRNP requires an interaction with dU2A&#x02032;. Unfortunately, we have been unable to generate the tools necessary to test this idea directly, thus the biological role of heterodimer formation remains unknown.</p><p> The structure&#x02013;function studies presented here have identified several motifs in SNF that are important for heterodimer formation, including a redundant domain in the normally dispensable C-terminal RRM. Importantly, our studies have shown that the C-terminal RRM can compensate for mutations in the N-terminal RRM dU2A&#x02032;-binding motif previously identified by structure&#x02013;function studies on the human proteins. The conclusion that the C-terminal RRM of SNF provides functions that are redundant to those provided by the N-terminal RRM was also reached by our earlier <italic>in vivo</italic> structure&#x02013;function studies of SNF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke507c7">7</xref>). In these studies, an N-terminal RRM mutant protein predicted to eliminate RNA binding still assembles into both snRNPs and is capable of rescuing the <italic>snf</italic> lethal phenotype only if the normally dispensable C-terminal RRM is present. Does the C-terminal RRM provide functions that are redundant to the N-terminal RRM in other eukaryotic species? This function is clearly absent in <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>, as the U2B&#x02033; ortholog has no C-terminal RRM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke507c5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke507c32">32</xref>). Although the human U2B&#x02033; protein does have a C-terminal RRM, its function has not been investigated. In fact, because the N-terminal RRM is both necessary and sufficient for both its RNA-binding activity and its ability to interact with U2A&#x02032;, analysis of the human protein has focused almost entirely on the function of the N-terminal RRM as an isolated protein fragment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke507c8">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke507c18">18</xref>). Whether the fact that the C-terminal RRM is 85&#x00025; identical between the human and the fly proteins translates into conservation of function therefore remains to be determined.</p><p> A second striking feature of the studies presented here is our finding that dU2A&#x02032; is essential for viability. This result, coupled with the observation that heterodimer formation is not essential for viability in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, demonstrates that dU2A&#x02032; can accomplish its vital function without SNF. Is this SNF-independent function required for splicing? Evidence that U2A&#x02032; plays a key role in U2 snRNP function comes from studies of the <italic>S.cerevisiae</italic> U2A&#x02032; homolog, LEA1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke507c32">32</xref>). In these studies, a requirement for LEA1 in U2 snRNP function was suggested by the observation that in extracts made from strains lacking LEA1 spliceosome formation was blocked prior to addition of U2 snRNP. Interestingly, and in contrast to the situation in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, the assembly of LEA1 into U2 snRNP is dependent on the presence of the U2B&#x02033; counterpart, YIB9. This observation, coupled with the fact that dU2A&#x02032; is more similar to its mammalian counterpart than to LEA1, suggests that the function of the <italic>Drosophila</italic> protein may not precisely parallel that of the yeast protein. It will be interesting to determine if the SNF-independent function of dU2A&#x02032; we have described here is conserved in metazoans or whether the <italic>Drosophila</italic> protein is unique in having acquired an independent function.</p></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="display-objects"><title>Figures and Tables</title><fig id="gke507f1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p> The <italic>Drosophila</italic> U2A&#x02032; ortholog is U2 snRNP specific.
