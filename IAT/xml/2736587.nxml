PTEN negatively regulates the signaling pathways initiated by protein kinase B (Akt) thereby regulating signals for growth, proliferation and cell survival. <italic>Pten</italic> deletion in the mouse brain has revealed its role in controlling cell size and number. In this study, we used Cre-<italic>loxP</italic> technology to specifically inactivate <italic>Pten</italic> in dopamine (DA) neurons (<italic>Pten</italic> KO mice). The resulting mutant mice showed neuronal hypertrophy, and an increased number of dopaminergic neurons and fibers in the ventral mesencephalon. Interestingly, quantitative microdialysis studies in <italic>Pten</italic> KO mice revealed no alterations in basal DA extracellular levels or evoked DA release in the dorsal striatum, despite a significant increase in total DA tissue levels. Striatal dopamine receptor D1 (DRD1) and prodynorphin (PDyn) mRNA levels were significantly elevated in KO animals, suggesting an enhancement in neuronal activity associated with the striatonigral projection pathway, while dopamine receptor D2 (DRD2) and preproenkephalin (PPE) mRNA levels remained unchanged. In addition, PTEN inactivation protected DA neurons and significantly enhanced DA-dependent behavioral functions in KO mice after a progressive 6OHDA lesion. These results provide further evidence about the role of PTEN in the brain and suggest that manipulation of the PTEN/Akt signaling pathway during development may alter the basal state of dopaminergic neurotransmission and could provide a therapeutic strategy for the treatment of Parkinson's disease, and other neurodegenerative disorders.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="13"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p><italic>Pten</italic> (for &#x02018;phosphatase and tensin homologue deleted on chromosome ten&#x02019;) is a tumor suppressor gene mutated in many human cancers, including glioblastomas, a highly malignant glial tumor in the CNS <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007027-Ali1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>.

Upon activation, Akt phosphorylates a diverse spectrum of substrates known to regulate cellular functions related to cell cycle progression, cell growth and proliferation, cell death/survival and cell differentiation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007027-Vivanco1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>PTEN is widely distributed in the brain and is preferentially expressed in neurons, where it localizes to both the nucleus and cytoplasm <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007027-Lachyankar1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007027-Chang1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>. The role of PTEN in the brain has been largely focused on the pathogenesis of glioblastoma; however, progress has recently been made in understanding the broader role of PTEN in neural circuits. A number of <italic>in vitro</italic> studies indicates a role for PTEN signaling in neuronal size, dendritic and axonal branching and neuronal polarization <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007027-vanDiepen1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007027-Yoshimura1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>. To analyze the role of PTEN <italic>in vivo</italic> and in specific neuronal populations mutant mice have been generated to induce the loss of the phosphatase in a tissue-specific manner by using the <italic>Cre-LoxP</italic> technology. Conditional loss of <italic>Pten</italic> in the brain can have differing consequences depending on the cell type or state of differentiation. For example, the use of a Nestin promoter to induce <italic>Pten</italic> deletion in neural stem cells and glial progenitors resulted in neonatal death, as mice showed enlarged and histoarchitecturally abnormal brains <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007027-Groszer1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>. <italic>Pten</italic> deletion in discrete mature neuronal populations in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus resulted in macrocephaly due to neuronal hypertrophy. In addition abnormalities in axonal growth and synapse number resulted in abnormal social behavior and inappropriate responses to sensory stimuli <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007027-Kwon1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Recent studies have emphasized the association of PTEN with different parameters of the dopaminergic system in the ventral midbrain. For example, the continuous activation of the downstream PTEN pathway, Akt, in mesostriatal adult dopamine neurons by unilateral adenoviral injections in the substantia nigra compacta confers almost complete protection against apoptotic cell death in a dopamine toxin specific model <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007027-Ries1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>. In addition, a recent study has shown Akt signaling in the mesolimbic dopamine system may also regulate functions intrinsic to dopamine neurons, such as cellular and behavioral responses to stressful stimuli <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007027-Krishnan1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>. Besides the inhibitory control on the activation of the Akt pathway, PTEN interacts with molecular substrates directly involved in neurotransmission such as glutamate and serotonin receptors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007027-Krishnan1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007027-Lesche1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>. Normally the activity of mesolimbic dopamine cells is under the tonic inhibitory control of the phosphorylated serotonin receptor 2c (5-HT2c). PTEN deletion in DA cells favors the phospholylated state of the 5-HT2c receptor, inhibits dopaminergic transmission and abolishes the rewarding effects of nicotine and tetrahydrocannabinol <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007027-Krishnan1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>. These studies suggest PTEN function in dopamine neurons is not limited to the classical deregulation of the Akt pathway, and PTEN may also have an effect on distinct functions related to dopamine-mediated cognition. To further examine the correlation between PTEN and the dopaminergic system, we developed a mouse transgenic model to inactivate PTEN signaling specifically in DA neurons. We now report that PTEN ablation during development results in profound morphological, molecular and neurochemical changes in DA neuron maturation that translate into permanent adaptations of the dopaminergic system, including significant changes in postsynaptic brain areas. Additionally, and in agreement with previous studies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007027-Ries1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>, we show that PTEN deletion in dopamine cells provides significant protection against neurotoxic insults. Such adaptations will be documented in detail in this report. Future studies will be aimed at correlating the molecular adaptations mediated by PTEN deletion with behavioral aspects of dopamine neurotransmission.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Mice</title><p><italic>Pten<sup>loxP</sup></italic> mice were obtained from Jackson laboratories <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007027-Lesche1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>.

DAT is a molecular substrate specific to dopamine neurons and is highly expressed in dopamine neurons of the ventral midbrain, while lesser expression levels are present in the olfactory bulb and hypothalamic areas. To minimize interference with DAT function by preservation of both DAT alleles, Cre recombinase expression was driven from the 3&#x02032;-untranslated region (3&#x02032;UTR) of the endogenous DAT gene by means of an internal ribosomal entry sequence (IRES).

Genomic DNAs were prepared from the olfactory bulb, motor cortex, striatum and SN/VTA. For ventral midbrain dissections, coronal cuts were made at the anterior and posterior boundaries of the mammillary nucleus. Dissection of the ventral midbrain region containing the SN/VTA was facilitated by removing the mammillary nucleus on the ventral surface and overlying cortex on the dorsal surface. A block containing the SN/VTA was then dissected.

The mouse was gently restrained and the probe was slowly inserted into the guide cannula. The dialysis system consisted of FEP tubing (CMA microdialysis) that connected the probe to a 1 ml gastight syringe (Hamilton Co., Reno, NV) mounted on a microdialysis pump (CMA/102) through a quartz-lined, low-resistance swivel (375/D/22QM, Instech, Plymouth Meeting, PA). After probe insertion, the mouse was placed in the dialysis chamber with food and water freely available, and the probe perfused overnight with aCSF at a flow rate of 0.3 &#x000b5;l/min.

Each DA concentration was perfused for 30 min, and then <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0007027.e001.jpg" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula> samples were collected. Following completion of the no net flux experiments, normal aCSF was again perfused through the probe for 30 min, allowing for a period of equilibration.

While the most described function of PTEN is mediated by the inhibition of cell-survival promoting PI3K/Akt- dependent signals, recent studies have shown PTEN regulates diverse functions in DA neurons, and its relationship to Parkinson&#x02019;s disease and drug addiction has been highlighted. In this study, we have further characterized PTEN function specific to postmitotic mouse mesencephalic DA neurons. We generated a knockin mouse expressing Cre recombinase under the transcriptional control of the endogenous DAT promoter, to mediate restricted DNA recombination events <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007027-Bckman1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>. <italic>Pten</italic> was selectively deleted in DA neurons in parallel to activation of the dopamine transporter at embryonic day 15. In addition, to allow bicistronic mRNA expression encoding for both DAT and Cre, we targeted the 3&#x02032; untranslated region (3&#x02032;UTR) of the DAT gene where the Cre gene is preceded by an internal ribosomal entry site (IRES). <italic>Pten</italic> KO mice showed an enlarged ventral mesencephalon, neuronal hypertophy and increased numbers of DA neurons. Despite the robust trophic effects accompanied by a significant increase in overall striatal DA tissue content, extracellular DA levels in the striatum remained unchanged between control and <italic>Pten</italic> KO mice, and potassium evoked DA release was not elevated in <italic>Pten</italic> KO animals. However, DRD1 and PDyn mRNA levels were significantly elevated in striatonigral projecting neurons. PTEN inactivation protected DA neurons during exposure to a neurotoxin. This initial study of PTEN deregulation selective to DA neurons is aimed at describing the state of dopaminergic transmission and molecular adaptations of the mesostriatal and mesolimbic dopaminergic systems. The effects of PTEN deletion in DA neurons, as well as postsynaptic regions will be discussed in detail below.</p><sec id="s4a"><title>Disruption of PTEN activity in DA neurons during postmitotic developmental growth</title><p>Cell death by apoptosis is a normal developmental event occurring in most neuronal populations, and it is a determinant of the eventual size of a neuronal population. Developmental cell death is often regulated by the trophic synaptic support that neurons receive from their postsynaptic targets <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007027-JacksonLewis1">&#x0005b;31&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007027-Barde1">&#x0005b;32&#x0005d;</xref>, as well as from afferent projections <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007027-Linden1">&#x0005b;33&#x0005d;</xref>. Pruning of DA neurons in the mouse ventral midbrain is essentially a postnatal event with the number of apoptotic neurons culminating within the first days of life <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007027-JacksonLewis1">&#x0005b;31&#x0005d;</xref>. A second peak of apoptotic death among dopaminergic neurons occurs at postnatal day 14, a developmental period corresponding to competition for synapse formation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007027-Hattori1">&#x0005b;34&#x0005d;</xref>. In addition, and consistent with the model of target-derived support, excitotoxic striatal lesions during development result in a reduced number of nigro-striatal DA neurons. This decrease occurred in spite of the axon-sparing nature of the lesion <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007027-Burke2">&#x0005b;35&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007027-Lundberg1">&#x0005b;36&#x0005d;</xref>. Thus, several lines of evidence suggest trophic factors, synaptic interactions and apoptotic events may play a key role in shaping the anatomy of the ventral mesencephalon.</p><p>In this study, we have shown <italic>Pten</italic> deletion in differentiated DA neurons causes a significant increase in the number and size of surviving neurons in both the mesolimbic and nigrostriatal projecting pathways. A known function of PTEN is antagonizing cell survival signals mediated by Akt-dependent pathways. Akt, or protein kinase B, exerts its role in promoting cell survival and growth by targeting anti-apoptotic downstream signals <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007027-Endersby1">&#x0005b;37&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007027-Li2">&#x0005b;38&#x0005d;</xref>. Because at the time of <italic>Pten</italic> deletion DA neurons have already completed mitosis and phenotypic determination, it is unlikely the reported increase in DA neurons is due to an increase in newly formed neurons. It is thus likely PTEN ablation preserves DA neurons that normally would undergo apoptosis due to the lack of target support, by repressing the initiation of apoptotic pathways.</p></sec><sec id="s4b"><title>While <italic>Pten</italic> deletion does not alter DA release, it induces permanent changes in striatal postsynaptic markers</title><p>Ablation of PTEN in DA neurons did not only cause robust anatomical changes in the ventral mesencephalon, but also affected functional connections between DA neurons and target areas. Interestingly, PTEN ablation did not generate changes in TH optical density in the striatum or nucleus accumbens, suggesting an equal distribution of dopaminergic terminals between <italic>Pten</italic> KO and control animals. <italic>In vivo</italic> microdialysis studies showed no differences in basal extracellular DA levels or in the dynamics of neurotransmitter clearance in the dorsal striatum. In addition potassium evoked depolarizations did not show an increase in DA release in <italic>Pten</italic> KO animals when compared to controls.</p><p>While no changes in DA release or uptake could be detected by microdialysis, KO animals showed a significant increase in total DA tissue content in dorsal striatum, an effect accompanied by a significant increase in striatal prodynorphin and DRD1 mRNA expression levels. As previous studies have shown enhancement of DA neurotransmission often results in elevated dynorphin and DRD1 mRNA levels in direct striatal projecting neurons, the unbalance between the direct and indirect striatal projection pathways observed in <italic>Pten</italic> KO animals could be explained by subtle but long-term changes in DA dynamics. In addition, we cannot rule out the possibility that the molecular changes specifically observed in dynorphin positive medium spiny neurons may be due to the direct synaptic interaction with DA neurons in the ventral mesencephalon. Medium spiny neurons may depend on trophic support and the availability of synaptic connections with their target, the SN, to define their molecular profile or even to survive during development. As <italic>Pten</italic> deletion creates a very robust change in substantia nigra, it is possible that the nigra may be in a better position to support afferent populations, such as the medium spiny neurons. Increased BDNF mRNA levels in the ventral mesencephalon in <italic>Pten</italic> KO animals, suggests that striatal afferents may have increased availability to trophic support in KO animals.</p><p>As locomotor activity and exposure to a novel environment are closely associated with mesocortical and mesolimbic activity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007027-Swerdlow1">&#x0005b;39&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007027-ONeill1">&#x0005b;40&#x0005d;</xref>, we compared the locomotor responses of control and <italic>Pten</italic> KO animals when exposed to a novel environment. Interestingly, and despite higher DA contents in the striatum, <italic>Pten</italic> KO animals did not behave differently than controls when exposed to a novel environment. Increased DRD1 and dynorphin levels in medium spiny neurons may enhance the inhibition of DA neurons in the SNc, thereby normalizing overall DA release in the striatum.</p></sec><sec id="s4c"><title>Suppressing PTEN expression protects DA neurons against exposure to a neurotoxin</title><p>The relationship between PTEN and Parkinson&#x02019;s disease has been emphasized in several studies often in reference to mitochondrial function. PTEN downregulation in cultured hippocampal neurons inhibits the release of cytochrome c during toxic insults <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007027-Zhu1">&#x0005b;41&#x0005d;</xref>.

In addition, as an upstream modulator of Akt, the phosphatase PTEN has been shown to play a role in the regulation of survival signaling during neuronal injury. A previous study overexpressed a constitutively active form of the oncoprotein Akt/PKB in neurons of the ventral midbrain of adult mice using adeno-associated virus transduction <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007027-Ries1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>. The authors reported a significant increase in cell size and number of TH positive profiles in the SNc on the injected side.

There was also near complete protection of DA neuron cell bodies after intrastriatal 6OHDA lesion <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007027-Ries1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>. Our study provides further evidence that ablating PTEN activity leads to decreased dopaminergic neuronal death after a neurotoxic lesion. In agreement with the above mention study, we showed that <italic>Pten</italic> deletion specific to DA neurons confers significant protection against 6OHDA mediated toxicity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007027-He1">&#x0005b;43&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007027-Marti1">&#x0005b;44&#x0005d;</xref>. PTEN less DA neurons displayed a significant increase in survival rate as compared to control DA neurons. In addition, striatal TH density levels were significantly elevated in <italic>Pten</italic> KO animals as compared to controls. This data correlates with behavioral parameters, as methamphetamine induced rotations were significantly decreased in KO animals, suggesting increased maintenance of DA release in the lesioned striatum.</p><p>The demonstration that PTEN/Akt mRNA expression is modulated in response to different apoptotic inducers <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007027-Chang1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref> strongly suggests the association of this pathway with neuronal survival and death. However, in recent years investigations have shown cellular functions attributed to PTEN in various neuronal circuits go beyond interactions with the Akt pathway, and have strengthened the current view of this molecule as a potential therapeutic target. For example, it has been recently shown that PTEN can physically interact with serotonin receptors in dopamine neurons to modulate transmission <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007027-Ning1">&#x0005b;45&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007027-Ji1">&#x0005b;46&#x0005d;</xref>. Such interactions were able to affect the response of DA neurons to drugs of abuse, and therefore manipulation of the PTEN pathway could potentially affect the manner in which humans respond to reward and motivation. In addition, PTEN activity has been related to mitochondrial function in different neuronal systems, suggesting PTEN deregulation may provide a dual neuroprotective function in dopamine cells by the activation of survival pathways and maintenance of mitochondrial function. This molecule may thus have activity not only on cell death/survival, but also on other brain activities. Further studies defining the function of PTEN in dopamine cells may provide the molecular basis for the development of novel therapeutic strategies to treat CNS diseases.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors thank Dr. Barry J.
