Suboptimal codon content limits expression of viral, experimental or therapeutic heterologous proteins due to limiting cognate tRNAs. Codon content is therefore often adjusted to match codon bias of the host organism. Codon content also varies between genes within individual mammalian species. However, little attention has been paid to the consequences of codon content upon translation of host proteins.</p></sec><sec><title>Methodology/Principal Findings</title><p>In comparing the splicing repressor activities of transfected human PTB and its two tissue-restricted paralogs&#x02013;nPTB and ROD1&#x02013;we found that the three proteins were expressed at widely varying levels. nPTB was expressed at 1&#x02013;3&#x00025; the level of PTB despite similar levels of mRNA expression and 74&#x00025; amino acid identity. The low nPTB expression was due to the high proportion of codons with A or U at the third codon position, which are suboptimal in human mRNAs. Optimization of the nPTB codon content, akin to the &#x0201c;humanization&#x0201d; of foreign ORFs, allowed efficient translation in vivo and in vitro to levels comparable with PTB. We were then able to demonstrate that all three proteins act as splicing repressors.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions/Significance</title><p>Our results provide a striking illustration of the importance of mRNA codon content in determining levels of protein expression, even within cells of the natural host species.</p></sec></abstract><counts><page-count count="11"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>With 20 amino acids and a termination signal being encoded by 64 different triplet codons, the genetic code contains redundancy. Most amino acids are encoded by sets of two or four codons, which differ in the third, or wobble, position of the codon. Use of synonymous codons is, however, non-random and in most species there are clear preferences for particular synonymous codons, corresponding to the pools of available cognate tRNAs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001801-Duret1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>. Consequently heterologous expression of proteins is sometimes prevented because the open reading frame (ORF) has a codon content that diverges too much from the codon preference of the host cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001801-Bonekamp1">&#x0005b;for example 2&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001801-Hamdan1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001801-Slimko1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>. The rare AGG and AGA Arg codons in <italic>E. coli</italic> are well known to be problematic for expression of foreign proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001801-Bonekamp1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>. Another well known example is the Green Fluorescent Protein from the jellyfish, <italic>Aequorea Victoria</italic>, which had to be &#x0201c;humanized&#x0201d; for mammalian expression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001801-Zolotukhin1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>. Although individual species show clear codon preferences, it has been recognized for more than 20 years that individual mammalian genes can have codon contents that diverge substantially from the average <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001801-Aota1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>. The principle source of variation is the G&#x0002b;C <italic>vs</italic>. A&#x0002b;T content of codon third positions, which is in turn dictated by large scale genomic organization into G&#x0002b;C rich and light isochores <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001801-Bernardi1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001801-Bernardi2">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>. The average GC content of human third codon positions is 59&#x00025;, but some human genes are enriched in codons ending in A or T, suggesting that they might face similar barriers to expression as ectopically expressed proteins from an organism with a distinct codon preference. We have encountered this phenomenon while investigating the activities of human Polypyrimidine Tract Binding protein (PTB, also known as PTBp1 and hnRNP-I) and its tissue restricted paralogs, nPTB and ROD1.</p><p>PTB is a repressive splicing regulator <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001801-Spellman1">&#x0005b;reviewed in 14&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001801-Wagner1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>, consisting of four RNA Recognition Motif (RRM) domains, each of which can bind RNA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001801-Oberstrass1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>. The optimal RNA binding sites for PTB consist of motifs such as UCUU or CUCUCU in a pyrimidine rich context <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001801-Perez1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>. Such sequences are often associated with alternatively spliced exons, where they act as splicing silencers (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001801-Perez1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001801-Gooding1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>). PTB exists as two major isoforms referred to as PTB1 and 4 resulting from alternative splicing of exon 9, which leads to the insertion of an additional 26 amino acids between RRM domains 2 and 3 in PTB4. PTB is expressed in various cell types, but exons that are repressed by PTB need to be spliced under some circumstances. There are various ways in which PTB-mediated repression may be modulated, including the action of antagonistic splicing activators <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001801-Zhang1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001801-Charlet1">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref>, and substitution of PTB by one of its tissue-restricted paralogs. In addition to the PTB1 and 4 spliced isoforms all mammals possess at least two PTB paralogs that share 70&#x02013;80&#x00025; amino acid sequence identify with PTB and a conserved overall domain arrangement, but which are expressed in a restricted number of cell types. Neuronal PTB (nPTB , also known as PTBp2 and brPTB) is expressed at highest levels in neurons, where PTB levels are concomitantly decreased. This switch in PTB paralogs is responsible for switching a subset of neuronal specific alternative splicing events <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001801-Boutz1">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001801-Makeyev1">&#x0005b;25&#x0005d;</xref>. ROD1 is expressed primarily in hematopoietic cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001801-Yamamoto1">&#x0005b;26&#x0005d;</xref>, but as yet there are no reports of its activity as a splicing regulator. A third paralog, smPTB, has splicing repressor activity but is present only in rodents <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001801-Gooding2">&#x0005b;27&#x0005d;</xref>. We have previously found that the PTB1 and PTB4 alternatively spliced isoforms have differential activities upon at least one alternative splicing event <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001801-Robinson1">&#x0005b;28&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001801-Wollerton1">&#x0005b;29&#x0005d;</xref>. We wished to extend this comparison in experiments involving transient transfection of cultured cell lines with expression constructs for the tissue-restricted human paralogs nPTB and ROD1, as well as the PTB1 and PTB4 spliced isoforms.</p><p>To our initial surprise, despite using expression constructs that provided a common promoter, 5&#x02032; UTR, N-terminal epitope tag and 3&#x02032; UTR, and that differed only by the open reading frame (ORF), the levels of expression of nPTB and ROD1 in a range of cell lines were only 1&#x02013;3&#x00025; those of PTB. We found that expression of nPTB and ROD1 was limited by their extremely suboptimal codon content, which was characterized by an enrichment of codons ending in A or U. By effectively &#x0201c;humanizing&#x0201d; the nPTB ORF we were able to obtain expression levels similar to PTB, and were then able to demonstrate that nPTB and ROD1 have splicing repressor activity similar to PTB. Our data highlights the fact that, in addition to its familiar effects upon heterologous expression of foreign proteins, mRNA codon content can have a substantial impact upon protein expression in an intra-species context.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>DNA Constructs</title><p>Human PTB1, PTB4, nPTB and ROD1 ORF sequences were used for all constructs.

Levels of nPTB RNA were comparable to those of PTB1 in L cells and reduced to &#x0223c;40&#x00025; in HeLa cells and to 20&#x00025; in 293 cells. The relatively modest differences in RNA levels cannot explain the much larger differences in PTB, ROD1 and nPTB protein expression. Indeed, it is likely that the reduced RNA levels may be a downstream consequence of translational stalling (see below). The large variation in protein expression is especially surprising, considering that the amino acid sequences of the four proteins are &#x0003e;74&#x00025; identical.</p></sec><sec id="s3b"><title>Suboptimal codon contents limit nPTB and ROD1 expression</title><p>The expression constructs were identical with the single exception of the ORFs of the proteins being expressed. We analyzed the sequences of the PTB, nPTB and ROD1 ORFs seeking clues to the observed differential expression. PTB expression is negatively autoregulated at the level of splicing <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001801-Wollerton2">&#x0005b;38&#x0005d;</xref>. We, therefore, initially searched for sequence motifs corresponding to optimal binding sites for PTB, with the rationale that negative feedback loops operating at the translational level might prevent overexpression of nPTB and ROD1. However, we found no differences in the occurrence of PTB binding sites, or of motifs associated with RNA or protein stability. The one striking difference between nPTB and ROD1 compared to PTB lay in the G&#x0002b;C versus A&#x0002b;T composition of their ORFs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001801-g002">Figure 2</xref>). Both nPTB and ROD1 have a lower G&#x0002b;C composition (41.2 and 43.9&#x00025; respectively) than PTB (60.5&#x00025;). Moreover, analysis by codon position revealed that this variation in G&#x0002b;C richness was entirely confined to the third codon position (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001801-g002">Figure 2B</xref>; PTB 86&#x00025;, ROD1, 35&#x00025;, nPTB 32&#x00025;), whereas the first and second codon positions had nearly identical nucleotide composition (not shown). This confinement of the variation to the third codon position is consistent with the high degree of amino acid sequence identity between the three proteins. Consequently, nPTB and ROD1 have a very distinctive codon composition, with a high frequency of codons ending in A or T, while PTB has a much higher proportion of codons ending in G or C. Strikingly, codon bias in the human genome shows an overall preference for G or C in the third codon position (&#x0223c;59&#x00025;) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001801-Lander1">&#x0005b;33&#x0005d;</xref>. These observations suggested that the differential expression of PTB, ROD1 and nPTB in transfected cells might be due to the enrichment in ROD1 and nPTB of suboptimal codons ending in A and T, which might limit the efficiency with which they are translated.</p><fig id="pone-0001801-g002" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0001801.g002</object-id><label>Figure 2</label><caption><title>Nucleotide content of human PTB and paralog open reading frames and third codon positions.</title><p>Histograms show the frequency (&#x00025;) of the four bases in PTB1, nPTB, ROD1 and the codon-optimized nPTB&#x0002a; for (A) the complete ORFs, and (B) the third codon position.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="pone.0001801.g002"/></fig><p>As an initial test of this hypothesis we analysed a 1-hour time-course of <italic>in vitro</italic> translation of PTB1, PTB4, nPTB and ROD1 mRNA in rabbit reticulocyte lysate in the presence or absence of supplementary tRNAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001801-g003">Fig. 3A,B</xref>).

ROD1 and nPTB showed a much higher level of induction of translation upon tRNA supplementation than PTB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001801-g003">Fig. 3B</xref>) consistent with the hypothesis that their translation is otherwise limited by the availability of cognate tRNAs. Over most of the time-points the levels of induction of nPTB and ROD1 were similar, although at the 20 minute time-point, nPTB translation was activated to a higher degree than ROD1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001801-g003">Fig 3B</xref>). As a further test of this hypothesis, we analysed <italic>in vitro</italic> translation in the presence or absence of supplementary tRNA at a fixed time-point (1 hour) with increasing quantities of mRNAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001801-g004">Fig 4A</xref>). Translational yield was expected initially to increase with mRNA concentration. However, at higher mRNA concentrations some tRNAs might become limiting, leading to a decreased yield of full-length protein in the non-tRNA-supplemented samples. We would also expect to observe the accompanying appearance of truncated protein products associated with ribosomal stalling at codons for which the cognate tRNA is unavailable. Consistent with these predictions, in the absence of tRNA supplementation both nPTB and ROD1 showed a biphasic response to mRNA concentration. An initial increase in yield of full-length product was followed by a decrease, with a concomitant appearance of a number of truncated products (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001801-g004">Fig 4A</xref> lanes 16&#x02013;20, 26&#x02013;30, truncated products indicated by white arrowheads adjacent to lanes 20 and 30). A possible alternative explanation for the appearance of truncated nPTB products is endonuclease cleavage of the nPTB mRNA. However, degradation would be expected to affect a progressively smaller fraction of total mRNA with increasing mRNA concentration. In contrast to nPTB and ROD1, PTB1 translation increased with mRNA concentration and no decrease in yield of full-length product was observed. This is consistent with a higher abundance of the tRNAs required for translation of PTB1. Notably, upon tRNA supplementation, translation of nPTB and ROD1 no longer showed a biphasic response to mRNA titration (lanes 11&#x02013;15, 21&#x02013;25).</p><fig id="pone-0001801-g003" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0001801.g003</object-id><label>Figure 3</label><caption><title>Translation <italic>in vitro</italic> of PTB and paralogs.</title><p>A) Translation was carried out in rabbit reticulocyte lysate pre-treated with micrococcal nuclease <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001801-Jackson1">&#x0005b;37&#x0005d;</xref> in the presence or absence of additional calf liver tRNA (60 &#x000b5;g ml<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>) over a time-course of 12, 20, 30, 45 and 60 min, and with 10 &#x000b5;g ml<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> of mRNA.

Translation for 30 or 60 minutes in the absence of tRNA supplementation showed the expected accumulation of truncated nPTB products (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001801-g004">Fig 4B</xref>, lanes 1,2). Addition of edeine at 30 min had no effect upon the profile of products at 60 min (lane 3). However, addition of both tRNA and edeine at 30 min led to dramatically increased production of full length nPTB at 60 min (lanes 4 and 5, duplicate samples). Thus, the truncated products formed under conditions of limiting tRNA (lanes 2,3) can be chased into full length products by the addition of tRNA (lanes 4,5). This is consistent with ribosomal stalling at codons for which the cognate tRNA is particularly scarce. This experiment demonstrates that there is no significant &#x0201c;drop-off&#x0201d; of stalled ribosomes. It also rules out the possibility that the truncated proteins are produced from nPTB mRNAs that have been preferentially targeted by endonucleolytic ribonucleases.</p></sec><sec id="s3c"><title>&#x0201c;Humanizing&#x0201d; a human ORF</title><p>The preceding experiments suggested that lack of expression of human nPTB and ROD1 in transiently transfected human cell lines was related to their suboptimal codon content and the attendant scarcity of required tRNAs.

The high level of protein expression from the nPTB&#x0002a; ORF most likely arises from its improved human codon usage profile. An alternative possibility is that the large number of base changes introduced in the construction of nPTB&#x0002a; might have altered secondary structures in the mRNA. However, the vast majority of changes were U to C or A to G, which would be expected to increase the overall stability of secondary structure. Indeed the maximum stabilities of structures predicted by Mfold were &#x02212;359.7 kcal mol<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> for nPTB, but &#x02212;426.4 kcal mol<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> for nPTB&#x0002a;.

However, the standard commercially available <italic>in vitro</italic> translation system includes excess tRNAs which can disguise the effects of codon composition upon translation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001801-g003">Fig 3</xref>). While many of the cases reported in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001801-Kudla1">&#x0005b;41&#x0005d;</xref> show large changes in mRNA levels in response to GC content, our observations and others <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001801-Zhou1">&#x0005b;44&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001801-Zhao1">&#x0005b;45&#x0005d;</xref> argue that in some cases large translational effects are dominant over relatively minor RNA level effects.</p><p>On the basis of established molecular principles our observations are not in themselves surprising, but the magnitude of the effect is remarkable. They suggest that codon content should be an important practical consideration when problems are encountered with protein expression in cell culture, even when the protein and the cells are con-specific. Re-building the ORF, as we have done for nPTB, is a serious undertaking, but it can facilitate lines of investigation that would otherwise have been precluded.</p><p>The most plausible explanation for the effect of codon composition upon protein levels is scarcity of the required cognate tRNAs. Various examples of eukaryotic cells with skewed tRNA populations matching the amino acid composition of proteins that are expressed at particularly high levels have been reported <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001801-Hatfield1">&#x0005b;46&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001801-Candelas1">&#x0005b;49&#x0005d;</xref>. Therefore, the converse situation is feasible&#x02014;that cognate tRNA availability might limit expression of an ORF that is enriched in usually rare codons. It is not readily apparent whether there is a specific subset of rare codons that are responsible for the poor translation of nPTB. The <italic>in vitro</italic> translation experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001801-g004">Fig 4</xref>) showed evidence for translational stalling at up to 14 specific positions. The sizes of these truncated products showed no obvious correlation with clusters of a particular type of rare codon, and it seems likely that codons with U in the wobble positions and those with A were both contributing to the inefficient expression, even if not to the same extent. Systematic identification of problematic codons would probably best be approached by inserting tandem arrays of particular codons into a specific location within an otherwise &#x0201c;normal&#x0201d; human ORF, rather than starting with nPTB in which so many codons appear to be suboptimal.</p><p>We overcame the translational impediments of the native human nPTB ORF by <italic>de novo</italic> oligonucleotide based construction of an entire synonymous nPTB&#x0002a; ORF. In order to maximize the chances of success, we did not try to identify particular problem codons, but adjusted the entire ORF so that it was closer in composition to the human average. Of the 211 silent mutations 47&#x00025; were U to C, 22&#x00025; A to G, 17&#x00025; A to C and 13&#x00025; U to G. Thus, 60&#x00025; of the mutations removed U from the wobble position and the remainder removed an A. For every synonymous NNA/G codon pair, nPTB shows a higher proportion of codons ending in A compared to both PTB and the human average. The highest enrichment of NNA over NNG codons in nPTB compared with the human average, is in the codons for Leu CTA/G (4.1 fold), Arg CGA/G (2.8 fold), Val GTA/G (2.3 fold) and Gln CAA/G (1.9 fold). For the decoding of NNG/A codons, a tRNA with C in the wobble positions reads only NNG, whereas a tRNA with a modified U in this position decodes NNA and may also be capable of reading NNG, depending upon the exact modification. Thus, there could well be a higher concentration of tRNAs cognate for NNG than for NNA, and this concentration difference could be the complete explanation of the beneficial effect of the A to G mutations. By contrast, all tRNAs cognate for NNC can also read NNU <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001801-Lander1">&#x0005b;33&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001801-Guthrie1">&#x0005b;50&#x0005d;</xref>, irrespective of whether the tRNA wobble base is G or I. Therefore, any improvement in translation resulting from the 47&#x00025; U to C mutations cannot be due to differential tRNA concentrations, but must be due to a greater efficacy of the tRNA in reading NNC as opposed to NNU. In fact, it as been shown that bacterial aminoacyl-tRNAs with G at the first antcodon position bind more rapidly to ribosomes programmed with codons ending in C than in U <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001801-Thomas1">&#x0005b;51&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001801-Curran1">&#x0005b;52&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Our experiments were based upon overexpression by transient transfection, and <italic>in vitro</italic> translation. The extent to which codon bias influences gene expression <italic>in vivo</italic> remains an open question. One possibility is that codon content presents a uniform restriction to nPTB expression across various cell types. Alternatively, cell-type specific variations in tRNA availability might lead to differential translatability, possibly in neurons. The possibility that variations in codon usage might be associated with expression in different human tissues has been suggested <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001801-Plotkin1">&#x0005b;53&#x0005d;</xref>. Indeed, papillomavirus L1 protein is translated in differentiated but not undifferentiated keratinocytes despite similar levels of mRNA, and this has been suggested to be explained by differential tRNA populations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001801-Zhao1">&#x0005b;45&#x0005d;</xref>. However, only 2.3&#x00025; of synonymous codon variability can be accounted for by tissue-specific expression; the major influence upon codon variability is genome isochore structure <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001801-Duret1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001801-Semon1">&#x0005b;54&#x0005d;</xref>. Introns within the nPTB and ROD1 genes have a much higher A&#x0002b;T content than PTB introns, consistent with the location of these genes in G&#x0002b;C light isochores. Indeed, this genomic arrangement is conserved in the murine nPTB and ROD1 orthologs, which show very similar suboptimal codon compositions. The unusual codon content that is imposed upon nPTB by its location in a low G&#x0002b;C isochore could act as a uniform constraint upon translation in various cell types. An alternative, tantalizing, possibility is that cell-specific tRNA populations may modulate the translatability of nPTB. Investigating whether cell-type specific pools of tRNA modulate nPTB translation would first require the identification of cell line(s) that show an altered hierarchy expression from transfected PTB, nPTB and ROD1 constructs. However, all cell lines that we tested showed the same hierarchy of expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001801-g001">Fig 1</xref>). It is possible that this line of investigation could be pursued in a suitable transfectable neuronal cell line, which might show enhanced nPTB translation. In the absence of transfection of constructs that differ only in the PTB/nPTB ORFs it would be difficult to disentangle nPTB regulation by tRNA availability from the numerous other levels at which its expression is regulated (see below).</p><p>Having engineered the nPTB&#x0002a; ORF, we were able to demonstrate by cotransfection that nPTB has similar repressor activity as PTB upon <italic>FAS</italic> exon 6. <italic>In vitro</italic> assays with an &#x003b1;-tropomyosin pre-mRNA substrate have also indicated that nPTB has repressor activity similar to PTB <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001801-Wollerton1">&#x0005b;29&#x0005d;</xref>. In addition, the nPTB&#x0002a; construct has subsequently been used to complement the effects of PTB and nPTB knockdown upon model actinin and PTB exon 11 reporter constructs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001801-Spellman2">&#x0005b;55&#x0005d;</xref>. Therefore despite the fact that nPTB is less repressive than PTB upon the <italic>SRC</italic> N1 exon <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001801-Markovtsov1">&#x0005b;56&#x0005d;</xref>, for other splicing events it has repressor activity similar to PTB. This is consistent with recent findings that replacement of PTB by nPTB in neurons has differential effects on large numbers of neuronally regulated exons <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001801-Boutz1">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001801-Makeyev1">&#x0005b;25&#x0005d;</xref>. While the role of nPTB in the regulation of neuronal alternative splicing has been investigated, to our knowledge this is the first demonstration that ROD1 also acts as a splicing repressor. The codon composition of ROD1 mRNA is slightly less extreme than that of nPTB, and ROD1 expression was more variable between experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001801-g001">Figs 1</xref>,<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001801-g006">6</xref>). While nPTB expression was uniformly low in all experiments, in some cases we obtained high expression levels of ROD1 and we were able to test its splicing regulatory activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001801-g006">Fig 6</xref>). We therefore did not construct a codon-optimized ROD1 vector. However, alternative splicing is a major contributor to generating protein isoform diversity in the immune system <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001801-Lynch1">&#x0005b;57&#x0005d;</xref>, and ROD1 may contribute to this process, perhaps having variable activity upon a subset of hematopoietic alternative splicing events. A reliable codon-optimized ROD1 construct might prove useful in the future investigation of its functions.</p><p>Expression of nPTB protein is controlled at a number of post-transcriptional levels. Even though it is transcribed in cells other than neurons, a PTB-induced exon skipping event leads to Nonsense Mediated Decay of the bulk of nPTB mRNA in non-neuronal cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001801-Boutz1">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001801-Makeyev1">&#x0005b;25&#x0005d;</xref>. In addition, it is subject to miRNA mediated translational repression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001801-Boutz2">&#x0005b;58&#x0005d;</xref>. Both these mechanisms restrict nPTB protein to a narrower range of cell types than nPTB mRNA. Translational control by codon bias, as described here, adds a further layer to this complex arrangement of post-transcriptional control.</p><p>As a final comment, it is perhaps worth noting that our references to the &#x0201c;suboptimal&#x0201d; codon content of nPTB mRNA are very much from the perspective of the experimental investigator trying to overexpress a protein. While unusual, the codon composition of both nPTB and ROD1 may, in fact, be optimized for appropriate regulated protein expression.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>We are indebted to Tuija P&#x000f6;yry for performing the tRNA chase experiments and for help and advice with the <italic>in vitro</italic> translation experiments.
