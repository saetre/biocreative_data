LTP at synapses in the hippocampus is the predominant model for learning and memory formation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. <italic>In vivo </italic>studies using rats have shown that LTP can also be induced in pain pathways at synapses between primary afferent C-fibers and dorsal horn (DH) neurons of the spinal cord (SC) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. This LTP is thought to be associated with sensitization of the DH neurons and contributes to hyperalgesia caused by inflammation, trauma or neuropathy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. While gene targeted mutant mice have been used to advantage in biomedical studies for decades, an in vivo model for LTP in the DH of this species has not been established. The development of such a new model would be very valuable for studying sensitization of the DH neurons and their synaptic plasticity and behavioral hyperalgesia. We characterize here the LTP of synapses between primary afferent C-fibers and superficial DH neurons in intact, anesthetized mice <italic>in viv</italic>o.</p><p>LTP can be induced and/or expressed by presynaptic [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>] and postsynaptic [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>] mechanisms. Although LTP has been studied extensively in various synapses, mechanisms of LTP ay synapses between the C-fibers and the DH neurons are still poorly understood. Recent studies have provided evidence for a postsynaptic, NMDA mediated, Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent form of LTP induction in lamina I neurons of rat SC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. The Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent pathways include protein kinase C (PKC), calcium-calmodulin-activated protein kinase II (CaMKII), protein kinase A (PKA), nitric oxide synthase (NOS) and members of the mitogen-activated protein-kinase family (MAPK), including the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. We here provide our <italic>in vivo </italic>evidence in mice that high frequency stimulation (HFS) at C-fiber intensity of sciatic nerve afferents produces LTP associated with phosphorylation of CaMKII (p-CaMKII), ERK (p-ERK) and CREB (p-CREB), and increased expression of c-Fos in the SC.</p><p>We have recently reported that ephrinB-EphB receptor signaling, which is important in synaptic plasticity in the nervous system and regulates the glutamatergic synapses and their plasticity by interaction with NMDA receptors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>], contributes to LTP in intact, anesthetized rats <italic>in viv</italic>o [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. Because of the lack of reagents and antibodies that selectively activate and/or block specific members of the EphB receptor subclasses, the identity of the EphB receptor that may be involved in LTP has not been identified. Here, using this new <italic>in vivo </italic>model of LTP in mice, we analyzed animals that were homozygous mutant for the EphB1 receptor (<italic>EphB1</italic><sup>-/-</sup>) and provide evidence that this receptor is essential to development of LTP. Our analysis further suggests the EphB1 receptor mediates LTP by modulating the previously characterized Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent pathways.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Properties of C-fibers-evoked field potentials in the mouse DH in vivo</title><p>The C-fibers-evoked field potentials characterized by prominent negative components are a reflection of the extracellularly-recorded excitation of DH neurons by stimulated the primary C-fiber afferents. Changes in the field potential indicate alterations in the synaptic activity of the DH neurons. After supramaximal electrical stimulation (0.5&#x02013;1.0 mA, 0.5 ms) of the sciatic nerve, the field potential was recorded in the mouse DH (100&#x02013;500 &#x003bc;m from the surface of SC). The field potential displayed a negative peak at relatively long latency (mean &#x000b1; SE, 71.1 &#x000b1; 2.9 ms, ranged 60&#x02013;95 ms, corresponding to conduction velocities 0.52 &#x000b1; 0.01 m/s; the distance from the stimulation site at the sciatic nerve to the recording site 3.6 &#x000b1; 0.1 cm, n = 15), and a high threshold during nerve stimulation (&#x02265; 0.2 mA, 0.5 ms). The field potential could be recorded at depth of 100&#x02013;500 &#x003bc;m but the maximal potentials were at approximately 200&#x02013;300 &#x003bc;m (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A, B</xref>). Stimulation of the sciatic nerve at strength of 0.5&#x02013;1.0 mA (0.5 ms) activated approximately all the C-fibers and the maximum field potential was recorded (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C, D</xref>). All of the field potentials were recorded at 1-min intervals and 5 recordings were averaged and presented as 1 datum point (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B, D</xref>).

Stable responses for 30 min served as controls. A conditioning HFS was then delivered to the sciatic nerve followed by single test pulses with stimulation parameters identical to controls. The high-intensity HFS induced LTP of the field potential in 8 of 9 mice tested, while failed to induce LTP in one of the mice. Significant enhancement of amplitudes of the field potentials (range: 150&#x02013;330% of baseline) lasted until the end of the recording periods (3 h in 6 mice and 8 h in 2 mice). Mean amplitudes and time course of the LTP in these experiments are illustrated in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>. These properties of the LTP in the mouse DH are similar to those recorded in the DH of rats [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>].

Such field potentials observed in the mouse DH is similar to that recorded in the rat [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>] and in agreement with the conclusion by Schouenborg [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>] that the late field potentials are generated primarily by synapses between C-afferent fibers and second-order neurons. The high-frequency, high-intensity tetanic stimulation to the ipsilateral sciatic nerve can induce a stable, long-lasting potentiation of the field potential in the mouse superficial DH, the LTP. The LTP can be suppressed by pre-treatment of MK-801, indicating that this LTP is an NMDA receptor-dependent synaptic potentiation. In addition, Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent pathways such as CaMKII and ERK are activated and phosphorylation of the transcription factor CREB is potentiated by HFS in the mouse SC. Therefore, the LTP we have recorded in the mouse DH <italic>in vivo </italic>has properties that are similar to LTP in the rat DH [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. A recent study has demonstrated that the primary afferent C-fibers induce LTP of C-fiber-evoked excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs) in projection neurons, but not in unidentified neurons in laminae I of SC slice of young rats [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>], supporting the hypothesis that the potentiation of synapses between afferent C-fibers and projection neurons in the DH contributes to LTP.</p><p>LTP of synapses between primary afferent C-fibers and DH neurons has important functional roles in pain pathways [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Modulation of synaptic strength is a powerful mechanism to control signal flow through selected pathways. A typical consequence of LTP at excitatory synapses would be an increase in action potential firing of the same and perhaps also of downstream neurons in response to a given stimulus. The signal transduction pathways involved in LTP, including PKC, CaMKII, PKA, PLC, IP<sub>3 </sub>receptors, NOS and ERK [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>] are also required for full expression of hyperalgesia in animal models of inflammatory and neuropathic pain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. In addition, high-frequency stimulation of the sciatic nerve fibers which induces LTP at synapses of C-fibers in the SC has behavioral consequences in rats and causes thermal hyperalgesia at the ipsilateral hind paw for approximately one week [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Thus, LTP at C-fiber synapses has a direct impact on nociceptive behavior.</p><p>Genetically modified mice, but not rats, have been widely used in investigations in many areas including pain for decades. This study provides an <italic>in vivo </italic>mouse model of LTP that should be very valuable for genetic approaches to the study of synaptic plasticity of the DH neurons.</p></sec><sec><title>Potential mechanisms of the LTP</title><p>Although mechanisms of LTP at C-fibers synapses remain unclear, there is evidence for a postsynaptic, Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent form of LTP induction in lamina I neurons of the SC. Induction of LTP requires co-activation of neurokinin 1 (NK1) and neurokinin 2 (NK2) receptors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>], opening of T-type voltage-gated calcium channels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>], and activation of group I metabotropic glutamate receptors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. Activation of NK1 receptor by substance P (SP) may directly enhance single NMDA channel opening [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>] and NMDA receptor mediated currents in lamina I neurons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. All of these may lead to substantial rise in postsynaptic [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub>, which is essential for LTP induction. In addition, Ca<sup>2+ </sup>influx through Ca<sup>2+</sup>-permeable a-amino-3-ydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA) receptors may also be required for LTP induction in pain pathways [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]. Signal transduction of LTP involves Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent pathways including PKC, CaMKII, PKA, NOS and members of MAPK including ERK [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. The potential mechanisms of LTP at synapses between C-fibers and SC projection neurons were recently reviewed by Sandk&#x000fc;hler [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. According to this model, LTP can be prevented if release of glutamate and/or SP is inhibited, or if opening of voltage sensitive and Ca<sup>2+ </sup>permeable ion channels is blocked. LTP deficits or de-potentiation could result from de-phosphorylation of synaptic proteins, changes in receptor trafficking or degradation of synaptic proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Studies have shown that in the rat DH this synaptic plasticity is sensitive to inhibitors of iNOS, glial cell metabolism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>], group I mGluR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>], glial glutamate transporters [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>] and protein synthesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>].</p><p>This study presents the first description of the time course of HFS-induced phosphorylation of CaMKII, ERK and CREB and altered expression of c-Fos in the SC of mice and rats. Note that the transient, peak phosphorylation of both CaMKII and ERK occured within 5&#x02013;10 min of HFS, while phosphorylation of CREB reached its peak approximately 2&#x02013;3 h after HFS. Increased expression of c-Fos was first increased at 2 h and reached peak at 3 h after HFS. Our results also showed obvious differences in the HFS-induced c-Fos expression in mice and rats, 1) the peak expression of c-Fos in the mouse DH was detected at 3 h, whereas it was markedly increased in the DH of rats at 2 h [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>]; and 2) the Fos-immunoreactive neurons were seen distributed across all of the mouse DH, while it distributed mainly in the superficial layers of rats DH [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>] (and the present analysis, data not shown).</p></sec><sec><title>EphB1 receptor, a mechanism underlying LTP</title><p>The Eph receptors, constituting the largest group of RTKs in mammals, with 13 members divided into an A subclass (EphA1&#x02013;EphA8) and a B subclass (EphB1&#x02013;EphB4, EphB6) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>], have been indicated to play important roles in synaptic plasticity in the nervous system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>]. We have recently found evidence that the EphB receptors play an important role in development of LTP in the DH of rats [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. Using our new <italic>in vivo </italic>mouse model of LTP described here and taking advantage of EphB1 receptor protein-null mice, this study demonstrates that the EphB1 receptor is essential to the development of LTP. Targeted mutation of the EphB1 gene successfully prevented development of LTP and suppressed the associated activation (phosphorylation) of CaMKII, ERK, and CREB as well as increased c-Fos expression.</p><p>The ephrinB-EphB interaction is well known to mediate bidirectional signals that propagate into EphB-expressing cells (forward signaling) and ephrinB-expression cells (reverse signaling). Both forward signaling and reverse signaling can play important roles in synaptic plasticity, acting either pre- or postsynaptically. Recent studies have proposed mechanisms for potential interactions between ephrinB-EphB receptors and AMPA, NMDA and mGlu receptors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>]. EphB receptors interact with numerous PSD-95, Discs-large Zoe-1 (PDZ) domain that can regulate the membrane trafficking of AMPA receptor subunits, such as PSD-95 itself, the glutamate receptor-interacting protein (GRIP) and protein interacting with C kinase-1 (PICK-1). Furthermore, phosphorylation of synaptojanin by EphB2 receptors modulates clathrin-mediated endocytosis of the GluR1 subunit of AMPA receptors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>]. Interaction between EphB receptors and GRIP or PICK-1 may instead affect membrane trafficking of the GluR2 subunit of AMPA receptors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>]. Both ephrins and EphB receptors have been found to be co-localized with NMDA receptors post-synaptically and to positively modulate NMDA receptors through a physical interaction between the N-terminal domains, or through the intervention of signaling molecules such as Src or other intracellular proteins. The activation of ephrinBs amplifies group-1 mGlu receptor signaling through mechanisms that involve NMDA receptors and/or PDZ/regulator of G-protein signaling (RGS) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>]. The interaction with ionotropic or metabotropic glutamate receptors provides a substrate for the emerging role of ephrins and Eph receptors in the regulation of activity-dependent forms of synaptic plasticity.</p><p>It has been reported that a selective impairment of long-lasting LTP induced by beta-burst stimulation of Schaffer collaterals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>] and both early and late phases of LTP induced by HFS were attenuated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>] in EphB2 receptor protein-null mice. Our results here show that targeted mutation of EphB1 receptor can prevent development of LTP and the associated phosphorylation of CaMKII and ERK and CREB and expression of c-Fos in the mouse SC. We hypothesize that this mechanism of ephrinB-EphB receptor signaling, particularly the EphB1 receptor, may apply to LTP at synapses between the primary afferent C-fibers and DH neurons of mice and rats. In addition, taken together with the present and our earlier findings that nerve injury fails to produce neuropathic thermal hyperalgesia in <italic>EphB1</italic><sup>-/- </sup>mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>], we have growing evidence supporting the hypothesis that the LTP in the DH may contribute to hyperalgesia.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>The present study describes an <italic>in vivo </italic>mouse model of LTP at synapses between primary afferent C-fibers and superficial DH neurons that is useful for probing pain mechanisms, including the DH neuron excitability and their synaptic plasticity and hyperalgesia in genetically altered mice.

All surgeries and the <italic>in vivo </italic>electrophysiological recordings were performed under anesthesia. The trachea was cannulated to allow mechanical ventilation with room temperature air, if necessary. Colorectal temperature was monitored and kept at ~37&#x02013;38&#x000b0;C via a feedback-controlled heating pad under the ventral surface of the abdomen. In each experiment phosphate-buffered saline was injected (i.p., 2 ml prior to surgery and 1 ml every 2 h) to provide fluid and maintain electrolyte balance. A laminectomy was performed to expose the lumbar enlargement of the SC at L<sub>5</sub>-L<sub>6 </sub>for electrophysiological recording and the left sciatic nerve was prepared for stimulation. The mouse was stabilized on the stereotaxic frame, the exposed cord was covered with warm agar (2% in saline) and the sciatic nerve covered with paraffin oil. After the agar hardened, a small hole was made above the recording site for application of drug or vehicle.</p><p>Field potentials evoked by peripheral stimulation of C fibers were recorded at a depth of 100&#x02013;500 &#x003bc;m (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>) and 150&#x02013;300 &#x003bc;m (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C and D</xref> and all of the other recordings) from dorsal surface of the SC with glass capillary microelectrodes (DC resistances 3&#x02013;5 M&#x003a9; filled with 2 M NaCl), which were driven by an electronically controlled microstepping motor (MHW-3, Narishinge, Japan). The depth of the electrode within the DH was judged by the microdrive readings. In order to locate the recording site, some electrodes were filled with fast blue and the dye was ejected at the end of experiments.
