In the central nervous system (CNS), TIMP-1 is strongly upregulated in reactive astrocytes and cortical neurons following excitotoxic/inflammatory stimuli, but no information exists on its effects on growth and morphology of cortical neurons.</p></sec><sec><title>Principal Findings</title><p>We found that 24 h incubation with recombinant TIMP-1 induced a 35&#x00025; reduction in neurite length and significantly increased growth cones size and the number of F-actin rich microprocesses. TIMP-1 mediated reduction in neurite length affected both dendrites and axons after 48 h treatment. The effects on neurite length and morphology were not elicited by a mutated form of TIMP-1 inactive against MMP-1, -2 and -3, and still inhibitory for MMP-9, but were mimicked by a broad spectrum MMP inhibitor. MMP-9 was poorly expressed in developing cortical neurons, unlike MMP-2 which was present in growth cones and whose selective inhibition caused neurite length reductions similar to those induced by TIMP-1. Moreover, TIMP-1 mediated changes in cytoskeleton reorganisation were not accompanied by modifications in the expression levels of actin, &#x003b2;III-tubulin, or microtubule assembly regulatory protein MAP2c. Transfection-mediated overexpression of TIMP-1 dramatically reduced neuritic arbour extension in the absence of detectable levels of released extracellular TIMP-1.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>Altogether, TIMP-1 emerges as a modulator of neuronal outgrowth and morphology in a paracrine and autrocrine manner through the inhibition, at least in part, of MMP-2 and not MMP-9.

In support of this idea, we have recently demonstrated that, unlike wild type (WT) mice, TIMP-1 deficient mice do not exhibit MMP-2 and MMP-9 upregulation after excitotoxic seizures, and this correlates with the absence of mossy fibre sprouting in the hippocampus of mutant mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008289-Jourquin1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>.

A way of addressing this question is to investigate the impact of physiopathological concentrations of TIMP-1 in neuronal morphology. We have combined a systematic morphometric analysis of cultured cortical neurons with the use of pseudophosphinic synthetic MMP inhibitors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008289-Jourquin1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008289-Cursio1">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref>, mouse recombinant full length TIMP-1, and recombinant WT and mutated inactive forms of the TIMP-1 N-terminal domain <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008289-Meng1">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref> previously used to demonstrate the determinant role of the N-terminal domain in the inhibition of apoptosis in non neural cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008289-Murphy1">&#x0005b;25&#x0005d;</xref>. Overall, TIMP-1 emerges as a modulator of neuronal outgrowth and morphology through paracrine and autrocrine actions and involves, at least in part the inhibition of MMP-2 but not MMP-9.

The relative frequency of neurites of a given length was classified by intervals of 10 &#x000b5;m. The number of growth cones per &#x003b2;III-tubulin positive cell, their shape, area and perimeter were analysed after fluorescence labelling with Texas Red-X phalloidin. To test whether the shape of growth cones was related to their dynamics, the index of circularity or &#x0201c;f circle&#x0201d; (4 pi x area/perimeter crofton2) was calculated. This parameter describes the degree to which a shape differs from a circle and it varies from 0 to 1 (a perfect circle &#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;1). We analysed around 900 neurons per experiment.</p></sec><sec id="s2g"><title>Gel Zymography</title><p>Gel zymography was performed as previously described <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008289-Rivera2">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>.

While TIMP-1, MMP-2, MT1-MMP and GAPDH PCR products were already detected at 30 cycles, the MMP-9 PCR product was barely detected even after 35 PCR cycles in cortical neurons cultured <italic>in vitro</italic> for 24 h. At 39 cycles the MMP-9 PCR products was clearly visible, but additional non specific products of weak intensity appeared as well (not shown). The efficiency of the selected PCR primers for MMP-9 was established by amplification of the appropriate PCR product in N2a neuroblastoma cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0008289-g001">Fig. 1A</xref>) and astrocytes (not shown). We thus conclude that in cortical neurons cultured for 24 h MMP-9 mRNA is expressed at significantly lower levels than the mRNAs encoding the other proteins of interest in this study. Although TIMP-1 mRNA was detected using RT-PCR approaches (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0008289-g001">Fig. 1A</xref>), the protein was undetectable by western blot in the supernatants of our cultures 24 h after seeding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0008289-g001">Fig. 1B</xref>) and immunolabelling was just slightly above background levels in a few neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0008289-g001">Fig. 1C</xref>).

Astrocytes also displayed intense immunolabelling for TIMP-1 (not shown).

Gelatinases MMP-2 and MMP-9 are potential targets for TIMP-1. The MMP-2 mRNA was clearly more abundant than MMP-9 mRNA and this ratio was preserved at the protein level. Indeed, MMP-2 gelatinolytic activity (&#x0223c;70 kDa) was consistently displayed in the supernatant, cytosolic and membrane fractions of cultured neurons. MMP-9 gelatinolytic activity (&#x0223c;100 kDa) was relatively faint in the supernatant and occasionally detected in the cytosol.

The paracrine actions of TIMP-1 appear to be mediated by its N-terminal domain which carries the inhibitory activity on MMPs, most likely on MMP-2. This proteinase, constitutively expressed by cortical neurons, is present in the cell soma, the neurites and the central domain of growth cones. Its inhibition by a selective MMP-2 inhibitor causes neurite length reductions comparable with those induced by TIMP-1, the latter equally affecting both dendrites and axons. The autocrine action of overexpressed TIMP-1/GFP causes an even more important reduction in neurite length and branching. Altogether, TIMP-1 emerges as a factor that modulates the size and number of actin rich structures (growth cones and microprocesses) and neurite outgrowth by inducing a reorganisation of the actin and tubulin cytoskeleton. Our findings may be of functional relevance mainly in post-lesion pre-scarring zones of the CNS where TIMP-1 is released at high levels by reactive astrocytes and by hyperactive neurons.</p><sec id="s4a"><title>TIMP-1 Affects the Morphology of Neurites, Growth Cones and F-Actin Rich Microprocesses</title><p>High expression of TIMP-1 in reactive astrocytes compared with much lower neuronal levels has been documented by different groups including ours <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008289-Rivera1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>. In the present study only 3&#x00025; of cells were identified as astrocytes by GFAP labelling, suggesting a minor contribution of these glial cells to TIMP-1 and MMP content. Although RT-PCR revealed the presence of TIMP-1 mRNA in cortical neurons, the protein was undetectable by western blot, in clear contrast with easily detected TIMP-1 (0.3&#x02013;3 nM) in the supernatant of quiescent and LPS-stimulated astrocytes found in the present study (not shown) or in the cerebrospinal fluid of patients with neurodegenerative disorders <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008289-Lorenzl1">&#x0005b;31&#x0005d;</xref>. The pathological concentrations of TIMP-1 in body fluids are within the range of those used in the present study that induced changes in the growth and morphology of neurons. The reduction of neurite length was concomitant with the increase in the number of small &#x003b2;III-positive neurites (under 10 &#x000b5;m) and actin rich protrusions. These are highly dynamic structures that expand and retract constantly and it is possible that TIMP-1 stabilises them through an increase in their adhesion to extracellular substrates. An alternative, but non exclusive hypothesis is that TIMP-1 could act as a repellent cue for growth cones, subsequently leading to the emergence of lateral protrusions. Similar effects have been previously reported for repellent cues that inhibit growth cone motility of retinal ganglion cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008289-Davenport1">&#x0005b;36&#x0005d;</xref>, suggesting that secondary neurites emerging from the protrusions might compensate the sensory deficit of the leading growth cone. Although an increase in the size of growth cones is most commonly associated with expanding neurites, the 2-fold increase of the growth cone size observed upon TIMP-1 application is on the contrary concomitant with the reduction of neurite outgrowth. No clear explanation exists for such phenomenon, but it has been suggested that changes in microtubule dynamics may slow down neuritic outgrowth and facilitate the accumulation of material within the growth cone <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008289-Owen1">&#x0005b;37&#x0005d;</xref>. The question remains open as to whether TIMP-1 induces a transient collapse of growth cones in a way reminiscent of classical collapsing-like factors (ie, ephrin, semaphorins, etc). Investigating the kinetics of TIMP-1 action should provide further insight into the activation of signalling pathways preceding significant morphological changes. In this context, failure to detect changes in cofilin phosphorylation at 24 h after seeding does not preclude that such changes may actually occur at earlier time points.</p></sec><sec id="s4b"><title>TIMP-1 Induced Changes in Neuronal Morphology Are Mediated by Its N-Terminal Domain</title><p>The finding that RXPO3R, a specific inhibitor of MMPs, essentially mimicked the effects of TIMP-1 provides indirect evidence that TIMP-1 targeting of MMPs is a causal event.

Therefore, it is reasonable to conclude that the inhibitory effects of TIMP-1 on neurite outgrowth are not mediated by the inhibition of MMP-9. Instead, several lines of evidence point to MMP-2 as the most plausible target of TIMP-1 in cortical neurons. Indeed, unlike MMP-9, MMP-2 was constitutively expressed and particularly concentrated in the central domain of the growth cone, known to be enriched in microtubules <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008289-GordonWeeks1">&#x0005b;40&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008289-Bouquet1">&#x0005b;41&#x0005d;</xref>. The exclusion of MMP-2 from areas rich in F-actin (ie, filopodia) suggests a possible functional connection of MMP-2 with the microtubular system, known to act as the principal structural component of neurite extension and retraction. In support of this hypothesis, we have recently shown that in neuronal cells, MMP-2-containing vesicles are transported along microtubules, in close interaction with the kinesin molecular motors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008289-Sbai2">&#x0005b;30&#x0005d;</xref>. The possibility that the effects of TIMP-1 result from the inhibition of MMP-2 finds further support in the observation that a synthetic selective MMP-2 inhibitor also reduces neurite length. Our findings, whether referred to the 24 or 48 h time-point reinforce recent data suggesting the involvement of MMP-2 in dendrite outgrowth of cortical neurons <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008289-Gonthier2">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>.

In this context, we cannot exclude that the effects of mrTIMP-1 on axons, observed at 48 h, involve the inhibition of MMP-3.</p><p>The absence of MMP-2 from growth cone areas enriched in F-actin (ie, peripheral domain of the growth cone) is in line with the failure of selective MMP-2i to affect the size of growth cones or the number of actin rich microfilaments. These data suggest that TIMP-1 effects on actin rich structures involve the inhibition of another MMP likely to be inhibited by the broad spectrum MMP inhibitor RXPO3, which did increase the surface of growth cones.

These exacerbated effects may result from higher local concentrations of TIMP-1/GFP in and around the transfected neurons that inhibit MMP-2 more efficiently, but may also reflect the effects of the interactions of TIMP-1/GFP with other intracellular and pericellular targets that would be less available for the exogenously applied mrTIMP-1.

Although the present study is focused on the effects of TIMP-1 on cultured primary neurons, our data may provide with clues to understand the functional consequences of TIMP-1 production in post-lesion or inflammatory pre-scarring zones of the CNS, but also to investigate the implication of TIMP-1 in learning processes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008289-Jourquin1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008289-Chaillan1">&#x0005b;47&#x0005d;</xref> and LTP <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008289-Okulski1">&#x0005b;48&#x0005d;</xref> on the basis of its ability to shape neuronal and synaptic morphology. These challenging questions will deserve further attention in the future to ascertain the role of TIMP-1, and more generally of the MMP/TIMP system, in the CNS at the crossroads of physiology and pathology.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0008289.s001"><label>Figure S1</label><caption><p>Inhibitory effect of mrTIMP on hrMMP-2 proteolytic activity.
