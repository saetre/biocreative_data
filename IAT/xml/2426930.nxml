Glutaredoxin 1 (Grx1), a cytosolic thiol disulfide oxido-reductase, reduces glutathionylated proteins to protein thiols and helps maintain redox status of proteins during oxidative stress. Grx1 downregulation aggravates mitochondrial dysfunction in animal models of neurodegenerative diseases, such as Parkinson's and motor neuron disease. We examined the mechanism underlying the regulation of mitochondrial function by Grx1. Downregulation of Grx1 by shRNA results in loss of mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP), which is prevented by the thiol antioxidant, &#x003b1;-lipoic acid, or by cyclosporine A, an inhibitor of mitochondrial permeability transition. The thiol groups of voltage dependent anion channel (VDAC), an outer membrane protein in mitochondria but not adenosine nucleotide translocase (ANT), an inner membrane protein, are oxidized when Grx1 is downregulated. We then examined the effect of &#x003b2;-N-oxalyl amino-L-alanine (L-BOAA), an excitatory amino acid implicated in neurolathyrism (a type of motor neuron disease), that causes mitochondrial dysfunction. Exposure of cells to L-BOAA resulted in loss of MMP, which was prevented by overexpression of Grx1. Grx1 expression is regulated by estrogen in the CNS and treatment of SH-SY5Y cells with estrogen upregulated Grx1 and protected from L-BOAA mediated MMP loss. Our studies demonstrate that Grx1, a cytosolic oxido-reductase, helps maintain mitochondrial integrity and prevents MMP loss caused by oxidative insult. Further, downregulation of Grx1 leads to mitochondrial dysfunction through oxidative modification of the outer membrane protein, VDAC, providing support for the critical role of Grx1 in maintenance of MMP.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="16"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Mitochondria play a pivotal role in cell function both in terms of being the power centers of the cell as well as mediators of cell death through apoptosis.

Further, we have also exposed cells to the excitatory amino acid L-BOAA and studied the interplay between Grx1 and mitochondrial membrane potential. We have earlier observed that constitutive expression of Grx1 is significantly higher in female brain regions as compared to the male brain.

Under normal conditions TMRM sequesters in the polarized mitochondria and shows punctate staining. As the mitochondrial membrane potential is lost, it diffuses out into the cytoplasm and subsequently moves out of the plasma membrane. To quantify the MMP, the fluorescence intensity was measured in several regions of interest (ROI) representing TMRM stained mitochondria in live cells. Under identical dye loading protocol the TMRM fluorescence in cells transfected with shRNA to Grx1 was significantly lower as compared to those transfected with empty vector and did not decrease further with time suggesting that the loss of MMP has already occurred (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002459-g003">Fig. 3B,E</xref>). To confirm that the decrease in TMRM fluorescence is indeed due to loss of MMP, the protonophore carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenyl hydrazone (CCCP) was added to depolarize the mitochondrial membrane. CCCP induced an abrupt decrease in TMRM fluorescence reflecting the loss of MMP.

Grx1 is an oxido-reductase and is involved in maintaining the redox status of several redox sensitive proteins. We therefore hypothesized that Grx1 may participate in a crosstalk across the mitochondrial membrane through the modification of mitochondrial membrane proteins. VDAC and ANT are components of mPTP that are present in the outer and inner mitochondrial membranes, respectively.

Protein thiols can also be directly oxidized by ROS to thiyl radicals or in a sequential manner to sulfenic, sulfinic and sulfonic acid (eqn. 3). Sulfenic acids can react with GSH to form PrSSG thus preventing their irreversible oxidation to sulfonic acids (eqn. 4). PrSSG may be further modified to generate intramolecular and intermolecular protein mixed disulfides (PrSSPr; eqn. 5). PrSSGs are reduced back to protein thiols very effectively by Grx1 (in the cytosol) and Grx2 (in the mitochondria) utilizing GSH and reducing equivalents of NADPH (eqn. 6). The GSSG generated by this reaction is reduced back to GSH by glutathione reductase using reducing equivalents from NADPH (eqn. 7). Downregulation of Grx1 would therefore potentially lead to increased levels of protein glutathione mixed disulfides as also mixed disulfides of proteins (PrSSPr).

Interestingly there was an increase in the amount of reduced ANT measured both as the derivatized and the reduced protein. This could be due to the fact that ANT is unaffected by downregulation of Grx1 or the mitochondrial glutaredoxin Grx2, efficiently reduces oxidized ANT.

The knockdown of Grx1 should potentially downregulate the expression of Grx1 both in the cytosol and the intermembrane space of the mitochondria, although it is presumable that the turnover rate of Grx1 could be different in the cytosol and the intermembrane space of the mitochondria and therefore knockdown of Grx1 may not be similar in the two subcellular compartments.
