We report here the cloning of the 5' flanking region of the rat TIMP-1 gene and identification of an IL-6/oncostatin M (OSM) response element at -64 to -36 which functions in hepatic cells. Within this element we have identified two functional binding sites for transcription factors AP-1 (activatory protein-1) and STAT (signal transducer and activator of transcription). IL-6/OSM stimulation induces binding of a protein, identified as STAT3, to the IL-6/OSM response element, while binding of the AP-1 protein was constitutive. Binding sites for both AP-1 and STAT3 are necessary for full responsiveness of the TIMP-1 promoter to IL-6/OSM, as shown by deletion and mutation analysis. Furthermore, the entire IL-6/OSM response element conferred responsiveness onto a heterologous promoter, whereas this has not been observed when AP-1 and STAT elements were separately tested.</p><sec><title>Images</title><fig id="F1"><graphic xlink:href="nar00024-0117-a" xlink:role="5043"/></fig><fig id="F2"><graphic xlink:href="nar00024-0119-a" xlink:role="5045"/></fig><fig id="F3"><graphic xlink:href="nar00024-0119-b" xlink:role="5045"/></fig><fig id="F4"><graphic xlink:href="nar00024-0120-a" xlink:role="5046"/></fig></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><supplementary-material content-type="scanned-pages"><graphic xlink:href="nar00024-0115.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="5041"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00024-0116.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="5042"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00024-0117.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="5043"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00024-0118.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="5044"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00024-0119.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="5045"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00024-0120.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="5046"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00024-0121.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="5047"/></supplementary-material></body></article>
