By biochemical fractionation we provide evidence that xCIRP2 is associated with ribosomes, suggesting that it participates in translational regulation in oocytes. Microinjection of labeled mRNA into oocytes followed by UV cross-linking of the oocyte lysate led to identification of two major RNA-binding activities. Immunoprecipitation of the RNA-binding proteins demonstrated that one is xCIRP2 and that the other contains FRGY2. FRGY2, which is one of the principal constituents of mRNA storage particles involved in translational masking of maternal mRNA, has an RNA-binding domain conserved to those of bacterial cold shock proteins. Possible implications of the highly abundant expression in oocytes of cold shock RNA-binding proteins of both eukaryotic and prokaryotic types are discussed.</p></abstract></article-meta><notes id="N0x985f9b0.0x94d7a68" notes-type="data_link"><p>DDBJ&#x0002f;EMBL&#x0002f;GenBank accession no.

Many eukaryotic mRNA-binding proteins function in pre-mRNA processing, mRNA export, mRNA localization, translation and mRNA turnover (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd656c1">1</xref>). Some classes of RNA-binding proteins also have structural roles in packaging mRNA. In the nucleus, pre-mRNAs (also called hnRNAs) are complexed with more than 20 species of abundant hnRNP proteins to form hnRNPs (heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein particles) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd656c2">2</xref>). Some of these hnRNP proteins remain associated with mRNA until nuclear mRNPs (messenger ribonucleoprotein particles) reach the nuclear pore, or even after they are exported to the cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd656c3">3</xref>). One example is hnRNP A1 protein, which was originally identified as one of the core proteins of hnRNP and later, along with its homologs, shown to be involved in splicing, to shuttle between the nucleus and cytoplasm and to remain bound to polysomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd656c2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd656c4">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd656c7">7</xref>). Upon mRNA export, cytoplasmic mRNP is formed by dissociation of at least some of the hnRNP proteins and association of mRNP proteins. Y-box proteins are the cytoplasmic mRNP constituents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd656c8">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd656c10">10</xref>). In <italic>Xenopus laevis</italic> oocytes, two Y-box proteins, FRGY2 and its homolog mRNP3 protein, are the major RNA-binding components of the storage mRNPs that store or mask maternal mRNAs in translationally silent states until those mRNAs are recruited to ribosomes for protein synthesis during early development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd656c11">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd656c14">14</xref>).</p><p>Many RNA-binding proteins share several structural features in common (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd656c15">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd656c17">17</xref>). One of the most commonly found and best studied is the RNA recognition motif (RRM). The RRM contains two highly conserved short segments (RNP-1 and RNP-2) within which the conserved aromatic amino acids directly interact with RNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd656c17">17</xref>). Some RNA-binding proteins contain as many as four RRMs which confer the ability to interact with RNA in a sequence-specific or sequence-independent fashion. RRMs are often flanked by other structural features representative of RNA-binding proteins, such as glycine-rich regions or hnRNP K-homology domains that are also involved in interactions with RNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd656c16">16</xref>).</p><p>Mouse CIRP has been identified by cDNA cloning of a RRM-containing RNA-binding protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd656c18">18</xref>). CIRP consists of a single RRM and a flanking glycine-rich region containing Arg-Gly-Gly (RGG) repeats. Based on its similarity to plant glycine-rich proteins, which are overexpressed during cold shock, the expression of CIRP was examined for its potential increase during cold shock. The levels of CIRP mRNA and protein in cultured mouse cells increase upon a temperature downshift from 37 to 32&#x000b0;C (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd656c18">18</xref>). Mouse CIRP is highly expressed in testis within the scrotum, which is maintained at temperatures lower than other parts of the body cavity, while its expression is repressed by exposing the testis to heat stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd656c19">19</xref>). Furthermore, it is thought that CIRP is responsible for a prolonged G<sub>1</sub> phase that has been observed in cells exposed to cold shock, although the mechanisms by which CIRP regulates cell growth are poorly understood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd656c18">18</xref>). Homologs of mouse CIRP have been reported in human, rat, Mexican axolotl and <italic>Xenopus</italic> cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd656c20">20</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd656c23">23</xref>). The <italic>Xenopus</italic> CIRP homolog was found by identifying genes expressed at a particular stage of pronephros formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd656c23">23</xref>).</p><p>In this study we report identification of a novel <italic>Xenopus</italic> homolog of CIRP. This protein, hereafter referred to as xCIRP2, is highly expressed in oocytes, being predominantly localized in oocyte cytoplasm. xCIRP2 binds to mRNA <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic>. Results from density gradient centrifugation show a possible association of xCIRP2 with ribosomes. We propose that xCIRP2 is involved in translational regulation in oocytes through the modulation of ribosomal function.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Oligo(dT)&#x02013;cellulose chromatography</title><p><italic>Xenopus laevis</italic> frogs were maintained at 20&#x000b0;C.

Amino acid sequences of the three resultant peptides (K1&#x02013;K3) that were microsequenced showed significant homology with the previously reported RNA-binding protein, CIRP (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd656f2">2</xref>).</p><p>Using information from the peptide sequences we cloned a 1.3 kb cDNA from a <italic>Xenopus</italic> oocyte cDNA library. The cDNA contains an open reading frame (ORF) encoding a protein of 166 amino acid residues (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd656f2">2</xref>). All three peptides were present in the deduced amino acid sequence, thus supporting the identity of p20 and the protein encoded by the cloned cDNA. Since Uochi <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd656c23">23</xref>) previously reported cDNA cloning of a <italic>Xenopus</italic> CIRP homolog, XCIRP, we designated the cloned 20 kDa protein xCIRP2. Alignment of xCIRP2 with other CIRPs revealed 92&#x00025; identity with XCIRP and 82&#x02013;83&#x00025; identity with mammalian CIRPs (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd656f2">2</xref>). xCIRP2 consists of an RRM containing highly conserved RNP-1 and RNP-2 sequences and a C-terminal glycine-rich region with four RGG repeats.</p><p>Until now the occurrence of CIRP protein in oocytes has not been reported in mammals or amphibians. When peptides derived from gel-isolated p20 were fractionated and microsequenced, a small peak of a peptide K2&#x02032; (YGRISEVV) was detected next to the peak of peptide K2 (data not shown). The K2&#x02032; sequence matched completely that of the deduced XCIRP amino acid sequence (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd656f2">2</xref>). Since the abundance of K2&#x02032; was &#x0003c;10&#x00025; that of K2, xCIRP2 protein likely comprises the majority of the CIRP expressed in <italic>Xenopus</italic> oocytes, with a much smaller amount of co-expressed XCIRP.</p></sec><sec><title>Expression of xCIRP2 in the oocytes</title><p>Next we wished to examine the expression of xCIRP2 in <italic>Xenopus</italic> by preparing two kinds of polyclonal antibodies against xCIRP2. Firstly, recombinant xCIRP2 protein with a 6&#x000d7; histidine tag was expressed in <italic>E.coli</italic>, purified utilizing metal affinity resins (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd656f3">3</xref>A, lane 1) and then injected into a rabbit to raise antibodies against full-length xCIRP2. Secondly, a synthetic peptide corresponding to the C-terminal region of xCIRP2, which differs from that of XCIRP but is conserved in mammalian CIRP (see C1 in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd656f2">2</xref>), was used to immunize another rabbit. Both rabbit antisera successfully recognized xCIRP2 as a single band in the oocyte lysate by immunoblotting analysis (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd656f3">3</xref>A, lanes 2 and 3). The antibody against the C-terminal peptide also recognized an 18 kDa protein in HeLa cell lysates whose expression was induced by a downshift in culture temperature from 37 to 33&#x000b0;C, suggesting that it is human CIRP (data not shown).</p><p>With these antibodies we examined xCIRP2 expression in <italic>Xenopus</italic> tissues and its accumulation during oogenesis. An adult frog was killed at 20&#x000b0;C and various tissues were isolated. Immunoblotting showed that among the tissues examined xCIRP2 was most abundant in testis, ovary, brain and liver and was faintly detected in kidney and heart (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd656f3">3</xref>B). xCIRP2 mRNA was detected by northern blotting using the xCIRP2 coding region as a probe. Two mRNAs (2.8 and 1.4 kb) were detected in the tissues tested, the longer being less represented in the ovary. Since the amount of xCIRP2 mRNA was much less variable among tissues relative to that of xCIRP2 protein, our results suggest that xCIRP2 protein levels are post-transcriptionally regulated. Further support for this notion comes from the results of oocyte analyses (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd656f3">3</xref>C). <italic>Xenopus</italic> oocytes in the mother&#x02019;s ovary can be divided into six stages by their size and appearance. xCIRP2 protein apparently accumulated as oocytes grew, while xCIRP2 mRNA levels remained constant. We usually prepare the oocytes from a mother frog anesthetized in ice-water and maintain them at 18&#x000b0;C. No change was observed in xCIRP2 expression in oocytes prepared from frogs anesthetized by ether at 20&#x000b0;C nor from those maintained at lower temperatures (data not shown).</p><p>We next determined the localization of the xCIRP2 protein by fractionating an oocyte into cytoplasmic and nuclear fractions (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd656f3">3</xref>D). xCIRP2 as well as FRGY2 were predominantly found in the cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd656c14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd656c28">28</xref>). The possibility of nuclear leakage was excluded by testing the nuclear localization of TAF-I, which is involved in chromatin remodeling (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd656f3">3</xref>D; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd656c25">25</xref>). However, the nuclear fraction did contain small amounts of xCIRP2 and FRGY2. Their significance is currently unknown (see Discussion).</p></sec><sec><title>Major RNA-binding activities in oocyte cytoplasm</title><p>Microinjection of labeled RNA into oocytes followed by UV cross-linking allows detection of RNA-binding proteins <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd656c28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd656c31">31</xref>). Previous experiments have demonstrated that when <italic>Xenopus</italic> histone H1 mRNA is injected, an RNA-binding activity that corresponds to a 60 kDa protein(s) is detected, which was proved by immunoprecipitation to contain FRGY2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd656c28">28</xref>). We repeated similar experiments, focusing on proteins of low molecular weight (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd656f4">4</xref>). To this end, <sup>32</sup>P-labeled histone H1 mRNA was injected into oocyte cytoplasm. The oocytes were then incubated for 1 h, lysed, irradiated with UV light and digested with RNase. Separation of the resultant products by SDS&#x02013;PAGE revealed two prominent RNA-binding activities corresponding to 60&#x02013;65 and 22&#x02013;25 kDa proteins (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd656f4">4</xref>A, lane&#x000a0;2, and data not shown). The RNA-binding activity associated with the high molecular weight band was immunoprecipitated with anti-FRGY2 antibodies (lane 4). The 60&#x02013;65 kDa RNA-binding activity might also involve other proteins such as mRNP3, which has high homology and similar mobility to FRGY2 in SDS&#x02013;polyacrylamide gels, and p54 RNA helicase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd656c12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd656c14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd656c33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd656c35">35</xref>). Note that protein bands detected by this method appear larger than the actual size of the RNA-binding proteins due to residual RNA molecules that remain cross-linked to proteins even after RNase treatment. We next set out to test whether the 22&#x02013;25 kDa RNA-binding activity contained xCIRP2, based on the fact that both are localized in the cytoplasm and have similar molecular weights. By immunoprecipitation of the UV cross-linked samples with anti-xCIRP2 antibodies we found that this is indeed the case (lane 3). Furthermore, UV cross-linking of lysates from oocytes microinjected with CAT mRNA yielded similar results, although in these experiments RNA-binding activities corresponding to 90 and 40 kDa were more apparent than those with H1 mRNA (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd656f4">4</xref>B).</p><p>By injecting labeled mRNA into the oocytes we found that both FRGY2 and xCIRP2 are major RNA-binding proteins. These experiments, however, do not show whether both proteins bind to the same RNA molecule. To examine this, we performed a gel retardation assay with recombinant proteins, whereby complexes formed by incubating labeled histone H1 mRNA with xCIRP2 or FRGY2 protein were separated by native gel electrophoresis (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd656f5">5</xref>). The xCIRP2&#x02013;RNA complexes migrated less far in the presence of higher amounts of xCIRP2, thus demonstrating the stable RNA-binding activity of xCIRP2 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd656f5">5</xref>A, lanes 1&#x02013;4). When a constant small amount of FRGY2 was included in reactions containing different amounts of xCIRP2 the mobility of the xCIRP2&#x02013;RNA complexes further decreased (compare lanes 2 and 6 or 3 and 7, respectively). These findings suggest that FRGY2 and xCIRP2 are capable of binding to the same RNA molecule. This finding was supported by data from experiments with anti-xCIRP2 antibodies whereby their addition to the RNA-binding reactions resulted in a specific supershift of complexes containing xCIRP2 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd656f5">5</xref>B, lane 6). Interestingly, FRGY2&#x02013;RNA complexes formed in reactions including large amounts of FRGY2 were not affected by the addition of xCIRP2 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd656f5">5</xref>A, lanes 9&#x02013;11) except when more than a 10 molar excess of xCIRP2 over FRGY2 was added (lane 12). The fact that no supershift was observed when anti-xCIRP2 antibodies were added to reactions containing xCIRP2 and FRGY2 in equimolar ratios (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd656f5">5</xref>B, lane 8) indicates that xCIRP2 fails to bind to stable FRGY2&#x02013;RNA complexes.</p></sec><sec><title>Biochemical fractionation of the oocytes</title><p>The data presented thus far establish that xCIRP2 and FRGY2 constitute two major RNA-binding proteins in the oocyte cytoplasm. We next wished to determine whether xCIRP2 is associated with large particles in the oocyte cytoplasm. Accordingly, oocytes were subjected to subcellular fractionation by ultracentrifugation at 100 000 <italic>g</italic> (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd656f6">6</xref>). When oocytes were homogenized in a buffer containing 100 mM NaCl, xCIRP2 was predominantly found in the pellet (P100) fraction. Most ribosomes also fractionated in P100 under these conditions. By increasing the salt concentration in the oocyte homogenization buffer to 500 mM, xCIRP2 was separated from the sediment fraction in the supernatant (S100) fraction. To elucidate features of the particles with which xCIRP2 is associated, oocyte homogenate prepared in 100 mM NaCl buffer was treated with RNase A and then ultracentrifuged. Following this treatment, rRNA, and presumably mRNA, was digested, thus likely freeing xCIRP2 to fractionate in S100. Taken together, these experiments demonstrate an RNA-dependent association of xCIRP2 with heavily-sedimenting particles in oocytes.</p><p>To further characterize the xCIRP2 subcellular localization in oocytes, we conducted density gradient centrifugation. When oocyte lysate was loaded on a sucrose gradient and centrifuged xCIRP2 fractionated exclusively to the top of the gradient (data not shown). This was unexpected, given that it had fractionated in P100 as described above. We reasoned that xCIRP2 association with heavy particles is unstable under our conditions for sucrose gradients. Similarly, Visa <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd656c7">7</xref>) found that hrp36 protein, the <italic>Chironomus tentans</italic> homolog of hnRNPA1 with two RRMs and a C-terminal glycine-rich region, fractionate to the top of the sucrose gradient. They used UV cross-linked cell lysate to observe polysomal association of the protein. We then fixed the oocyte lysate by irradiation with UV light prior to fractionation in the sucrose gradient (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd656f7">7</xref>A). A small portion of xCIRP2 protein co-fractionated with ribosomes, while a large amount remained at the top of the gradient. The data suggest that at least some of the xCIRP2 protein is associated with ribosomes or particles of similar size in the oocytes. Consistent with previous studies, FRGY2 was distributed to both the mRNP and ribosomal fractions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd656c33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd656c36">36</xref>).</p><p>In our final experiments oocyte lysate was fractionated through Nicodenz gradients which are used to separate RNA-containing particles by their densities (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd656f7">7</xref>B; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd656c33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd656c34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd656c37">37</xref>). When the UV cross-linked oocyte lysate was used, xCIRP2 was detected mostly as proteins free of RNA with only small amounts in the fractions co-sedimenting with ribosomes, which is consistent with results from the sucrose gradient. We next fixed the lysate with 4&#x00025; formaldehyde. Using this fixative xCIRP2 protein co-sedimented with ribosomes in the Nicodenz gradient, while FRGY2 was most abundant in the mRNP fractions. As a control, <italic>Xenopus</italic> TAF-I&#x003b2; remained in the fractions free of RNA after formaldehyde fixation, suggesting that the co-sedimentation of xCIRP2 with ribosomes is specific. Based on these results we concluded that in oocytes xCIRP2 is associated with ribosomes, but that most of the xCIRP2 is released prior to, or through, centrifugation in gradients with no or with inefficient fixation, such as irradiation with UV light.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>In this paper we have identified xCIRP2 as one of the major RNA-binding proteins in <italic>Xenopus</italic> oocyte cytoplasm. Data from immunoblotting experiments with recombinant protein show that &#x0003e;80 ng of xCIRP2 protein apparently accumulates in a stage VI oocyte (data not shown). FRGY2 protein is present at up to 5&#x00025; of the total protein content in a previtellogenic oocyte and its amount remains constant during oogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd656c33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd656c38">38</xref>). These establish that both RNA-binding proteins are abundant in full-grown <italic>Xenopus</italic> oocytes.</p><p>By cellular fractionation we have shown that xCIRP2 is predominantly localized in the oocyte cytoplasm. We confirmed this result by overexpressing tagged xCIRP2 in oocytes (data not shown). In contrast, mammalian CIRP is localized in the nuclei of cultured cells, which was demonstrated by immunocytochemical analysis of cold-induced CIRP and by overexpression of CIRP fused to green fluorescent protein (GFP) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd656c18">18</xref>). There are several possible explanations for this discrepancy. Firstly, it is possible that CIRP localization is dependent on cell type; CIRP might be nuclear in somatic cells while being cytoplasmic in female germ cells. Consistent with this hypothesis, it has been reported that in mouse testis CIRP localizes in the cytoplasm of spermatocytes but in the nuclei of round spermatids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd656c19">19</xref>). Alternatively, mammalian CIRP may possess a nuclear localization signal that is missing in xCIRP2 despite their very high homology. It is important to note, however, that this alternative model does not require that xCIRP2 has a cytoplasmic localization or nuclear export&#x0002f;exclusion signals, since the nucleo-cytoplasmic ratio of <italic>Xenopus</italic> oocytes is &#x0223c;1:25 and since in our fractionation we detected residual amounts of xCIRP2 and FRGY2 in the nuclear fraction (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd656f3">3</xref>D). Lastly, the difference in localization between mammalian and <italic>Xenopus</italic> CIRP could be attributed to the detection methods employed, i.e. manual isolation of the oocyte nuclei and microscopic analysis of fluorescent signals. Although other explanations cannot be excluded, we recently observed a nuclear localization of GFP&#x02013;xCIRP2 overexpressed in HeLa cells (unpublished observation), thus supporting the idea that CIRP localization is cell type-dependent.</p><p>By fractionation through density gradients we found an association of xCIRP2 with ribosomes. The fact that only a small part of xCIRP2 co-sedimented with ribosomes in the UV cross-linked lysates raises the possibility that this association takes place during or after preparing the oocyte lysate. However, other data suggest that this possibility is unlikely. First, xCIRP2 was predominantly found in the ribosome-containing P100 fraction when oocyte lysate was fractionated into S100 and P100 fractions. As this method is widely used as an initial step in biochemical fractionation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd656c32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd656c39">39</xref>), the conditions are unlikely to skew the native state. Second, it has been reported that <italic>C.tentans</italic> hrp36 protein, which shares several structural features with CIRP, behaves similarly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd656c7">7</xref>). Furthermore, additional evidence for ribosome association with hrp36 has been provided by immunoelectron microscopy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd656c7">7</xref>). Finally, following fixation with 4&#x00025; formaldehyde almost all the xCIRP2 co-sedimented with ribosomes in a Nicodenz gradient. Therefore, it is most probable that xCIRP2 is indeed associated with ribosomes in oocytes.</p><p>We found that injection of histone H1 or CAT mRNA into oocyte cytoplasm led to identification of at least two major RNA-binding proteins. Of note, the injected histone H1 and CAT mRNAs are actively translated in oocytes, in contrast to endogenous histone H1 mRNA, which is translationally silenced (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd656c28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd656c29">29</xref>). It is thus plausible that the RNA-binding proteins detected in our UV cross-linking experiments are bound to translationally engaged mRNAs. This is consistent with the finding that FRGY2 is associated not only with stored mRNPs but also with ribosome-bound mRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd656c33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd656c36">36</xref>). Rabbit p50, which is the major core protein of mRNPs in somatic cells and structurally homologous to FRGY2, can also be found in free mRNPs as well as ribosome-bound mRNPs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd656c40">40</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd656c42">42</xref>). The molar ratio p50:mRNA is lower in ribosome-bound mRNPs than in free mRNPs. Our gel retardation assay revealed that xCIRP2 is able to bind simultaneously to the same mRNA molecule as FRGY2 unless FRGY2 has formed a stable complex with the mRNA. From these results it seems reasonable to propose that xCIRP2 is associated with or a component of ribosome-bound mRNPs.</p><p>Generally, cellular responses to a downshift of environmental temperature are not well understood, although expression of mammalian CIRP is induced by exposing cells to lower temperatures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd656c18">18</xref>). However, studies with bacterial cells have established an intriguing relationship between the protein synthesis machinery and the cold shock response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd656c43">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd656c44">44</xref>). Upon a downshift of temperature transient inhibition of overall translation followed by a lag of cell growth results. Polysomes transiently decrease as 70S monosomes and ribosomal subunits accumulate in the cell. During the lag in growth, synthesis of a number of cold shock proteins is induced (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd656c44">44</xref>). Some of the cold shock proteins are translation initiation factors or ribosome-associated proteins, which are required for efficient ribosome function for growth resumption after a cell has become adapted to low temperature. In <italic>E.coli</italic> the major cold shock protein is CspA, which functions as an RNA chaperone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd656c45">45</xref>). Interestingly, inhibitors of protein synthesis, such as chloramphenicol, induce synthesis of CspA concomitant with a decrease in the number of polysomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd656c46">46</xref>). Thus, it has been proposed that ribosomes are the physiological sensor for the cold shock response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd656c43">43</xref>). In this study we show that xCIRP2 and FRGY2 are major RNA-binding proteins in <italic>Xenopus</italic> oocytes. FRGY2 consists of a cold shock domain, which is a sequence-specific RNA-binding domain showing 43&#x00025; identity with <italic>E.coli</italic> CspA, and a C-terminal tail domain involved in translational repression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd656c8">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd656c10">10</xref>). Therefore, xCIRP2, being homologous to a mammalian cold shock RNA-binding protein, might regulate translational efficiency of specific mRNAs by association with ribosomes in <italic>Xenopus</italic> oocytes, in which translational activity is thought to be kept relatively low by the abundant general translational repressive protein FRGY2. Mammalian CIRP is required for cold-induced growth suppression of cultured cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd656c18">18</xref>). Therefore, the results described in this paper, together with data describing the behavior of bacterial cold shock proteins, raise the possibility that CIRP affects cell growth by modulating ribosome function in eukaryotic cells.</p><p>During the preparation of this manuscript, Saito <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd656c47">47</xref>) reported the expression of XCIRP mRNA in an adult frog. They found that the expression of XCIRP in the brain is increased by cold treatment, but that no significant change occurs in the liver. In contrast, we observed no increase in xCIRP2 expression by cold treatment in oocytes (data not shown). Although a possible association of xCIRP2 with ribosomes in oocytes is demonstrated in this paper, cellular functions of xCIRP2 and other CIRPs remain elusive. It is possible that CIRP has distinct functions in the nucleus as well as the cytoplasm of different cell types. It is worth testing whether xCIRP2 binds to (pre-)mRNA in the nucleus and is exported to the cytoplasm associated with mRNA which is then recruited to the ribosomes. Our preliminary experiments to neutralize functions of endogenous xCIRP2 in the oocytes by injecting antibodies were not successful, probably due to the abundance of xCIRP2 protein. By fractionation in a sucrose gradient xCIRP2 was found to be associated with monosomes rather than polysomes. We therefore cannot rule out the possibility that xCIRP2 associates with ribosomes independent of mRNA. The finding that the RGG domain of nucleolin associates with ribosomal proteins argues for this possibility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd656c48">48</xref>). If this were the case, CIRP may modulate ribosome functions by direct association in oocytes. Experiments such as identification of specific RNA sequence preferences of xCIRP2 will better clarify its biological significance.</p></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="display-objects"><title>Figures and Tables</title><fig id="gkd656f1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p> Oligo(dT)&#x02013;cellulose chromatography. <italic>Xenopus</italic> oocyte lysate was incubated with oligo(dT)&#x02013;cellulose.
