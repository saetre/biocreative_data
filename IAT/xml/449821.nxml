While a major step forward in understanding the molecular mechanism(s) surrounding Hairy-mediated repression was made with the identification of Groucho, <italic>Drosophila</italic> C-terminal binding protein (dCtBP), and <italic>Drosophila</italic> silent information regulator 2 (dSir2) as Hairy transcriptional cofactors, the identity of Hairy target genes and the rules governing cofactor recruitment are relatively unknown. We have used the chromatin profiling method DamID to perform a global and systematic search for direct transcriptional targets for <italic>Drosophila</italic> Hairy and the genomic recruitment sites for three of its cofactors: Groucho, dCtBP, and dSir2. Each of the proteins was tethered to <named-content content-type="genus-species">Escherichia coli</named-content> DNA adenine methyltransferase, permitting methylation proximal to in vivo binding sites in both <italic>Drosophila</italic> Kc cells and early embryos. This approach identified 40 novel genomic targets for Hairy in Kc cells, as well as 155 loci recruiting Groucho, 107 loci recruiting dSir2, and wide genomic binding of dCtBP to 496 loci. We also adapted DamID profiling such that we could use tightly gated collections of embryos (2&#x02013;6 h) and found 20 Hairy targets related to early embryogenesis. As expected of direct targets, all of the putative Hairy target genes tested show Hairy-dependent expression and have conserved consensus C-box&#x02013;containing sequences that are directly bound by Hairy in vitro. The distribution of Hairy targets in both the Kc cell and embryo DamID experiments corresponds to Hairy binding sites in vivo on polytene chromosomes. Similarly, the distributions of loci recruiting each of Hairy's cofactors are detected as cofactor binding sites in vivo on polytene chromosomes. We have identified 59 putative transcriptional targets of Hairy. In addition to finding putative targets for Hairy in segmentation, we find groups of targets suggesting roles for Hairy in cell cycle, cell growth, and morphogenesis, processes that must be coordinately regulated with pattern formation. Examining the recruitment of Hairy's three characterized cofactors to their putative target genes revealed that cofactor recruitment is context-dependent. While Groucho is frequently considered to be the primary Hairy cofactor, we find here that it is associated with only a minority of Hairy targets. The majority of Hairy targets are associated with the presence of a combination of dCtBP and dSir2. Thus, the DamID chromatin profiling technique provides a systematic means of identifying transcriptional target genes and of obtaining a global view of cofactor recruitment requirements during development.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="toc"><p>A new chromatin profiling technique identifies targets of the transcription factor Hairy -- as well as targets of three co- repressors -- which implicate Hairy in several developmental processes</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Transcriptional repression is an important feature of developmental processes, where it is necessary for establishing intricate patterns of gene expression (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020178-Herschbach1">Herschbach and Johnson 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020178-Gray1">Gray and Levine 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020178-Hanna-Rose1">Hanna-Rose and Hansen 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020178-Courey1">Courey and Jia 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020178-Gaston1">Gaston and Jayaraman 2003</xref>). <italic>Drosophila</italic> embryogenesis is marked by the subdivision of the embryo into progressively more precise spatial domains, achieved through the coordinated functions of both transcriptional activators and repressors (maternal&#x02192;gap&#x02192;pair-rule&#x02192;segment polarity; for review, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020178-Lawrence1">Lawrence 1992</xref>).

These proteins function throughout development as dedicated transcriptional repressors of genes necessary for cell fate decisions in processes including segmentation, myogenesis, somitogenesis, sex determination, vasculogenesis, mesoderm formation, and neurogenesis (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020178-Fisher1">Fisher and Caudy 1998a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020178-Davis1">Davis and Turner 2001</xref>). Misregulation of HES family members has been linked to developmental defects and oncogenesis. In <italic>Drosophila,</italic> the HES family consists of Hairy and twelve other structurally related proteins, including Deadpan and seven members of the Enhancer of split complex . All members of this repressor family possess a highly conserved bHLH domain, required for DNA binding and protein dimerization; an adjacent Orange domain, which confers specificity among family members; and a C-terminal tetrapeptide motif, WRPW, which has been shown to be necessary and sufficient for the recruitment of the corepressor Groucho.</p><p>HES proteins have been shown to bind preferentially to Class C sites (CACNNG; C-box) as homodimers in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020178-Sasai1">Sasai et al. 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020178-Tietze1">Tietze et al. 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020178-Oellers1">Oellers et al. 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020178-Ohsako1">Ohsako et al. 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020178-Van1">Van Doren et al. 1994</xref>).

Despite the importance of Hairy and other HES family proteins in many developmental regulatory processes, little is known about the number and kinds of target genes they regulate. Understanding the spectrum of direct targets will be essential to addressing mechanistic questions such as how or when different cofactors are recruited.

For just over half of these putative Hairy targets, some genetic, molecular, or functional information exists, allowing us to divide them roughly into three functional categories: those affecting morphogenesis (e.g., <italic>egghead &#x0005b;egh&#x0005d;, kayak, pointed, mae</italic>), those affecting cell cycle or cell growth (e.g., <italic>string (stg), ImpL2, Idgf2</italic>), and those with unknown/unlinked functions. Unfortunately, the two previously identified Hairy targets, <italic>ftz</italic> and <italic>ac,</italic> are not present in the DGC Release 1 cDNA set used to generate our microarray chips.</p><p>DamID was recently used to identify targets for the <italic>Drosophila</italic> Myc/Max/Mad-Mnt network of bHLH leucine zipper proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020178-Orian1">Orian et al. 2003</xref>), which shares many structural and functional similarities with the HES network of bHLH proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020178-Gallant1">Gallant et al. 1996</xref>). Using the same <italic>Drosophila</italic> cDNA microarray chips, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020178-Orian1">Orian et al.

Their study is consistent with a global role for Myc family proteins in modulating chromatin responsiveness of targets, and identified most of the transcriptional targets that had been found previously utilizing other approaches. As our current knowledge of direct Hairy transcriptional targets for comparison is minimal, we applied a higher stringency than <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020178-Orian1">Orian et al.

Even when the less stringent statistics were applied to the datasets, we did not see additional overlap (data not shown). Thus, sequence-specific DNA binding factors are exhibiting binding specificity in the DamID assay, and the 40 statistically significant putative direct Hairy transcriptional targets we identified are what might be expected for a nonglobally acting sequence-specific DNA binding developmental repressor.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Identification of Direct Hairy Transcriptional Targets in Early Embryos Using DamID</title><p>Since Hairy is part of the segmentation gene transcriptional regulatory cascade, we expected to find segmentation-related transcription factors as downstream targets of Hairy. The putative Hairy targets we identified in Kc cells do not fulfill this expectation, but rather suggest roles for Hairy in cell cycle, cell growth, and morphogenesis; these putative targets are likely targets for Hairy during its other developmental roles. This could be because of cellular context (i.e., Kc cells are thought to be embryonic neuronal stem cell in origin and may reflect Hairy's later role in neurogenesis rather than segmentation), or because only half of the <italic>Drosophila</italic> cDNAs are present on the chip (and the ones responding to Hairy during segmentation are not in this subset), or because the mechanism by which Hairy acts during segmentation is different than expected.

However, we have been unable to uncover any common features of regulation, perhaps because of the relatively small sample size of Hairy targets for these types of approaches (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>; data not shown).</p></sec><sec id="s2f"><title>Hairy Binds to Specific Sites on Polytene Chromosomes</title><p>To confirm the genomic loci associated with Hairy in vivo, we examined binding of endogenous Hairy to third instar larval salivary gland polytene chromosomes using antibodies to Hairy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020178-g005">Figure 5</xref>). We identified approximately 120 strongly staining sites for Hairy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020178-g005">Figure 5</xref>).

There are 39 out of 40 Kc cell and 20 out of 20 embryo targets that map cytologically to regions that correspond to Hairy binding sites (e.g., <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020178-g006">Figure 6</xref>A&#x02013;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020178-g006">6</xref>F).

One of the major questions in the field concerns how and when particular cofactors are recruited. It has been technically challenging to address this question with current methods such as ChIP assays, since cofactor association may be transient, unstable, or far removed from the DNA binding protein. Utilizing expression-based microarray analysis is also not easy, because of the difficulty in sorting direct from indirect interactions with such widely recruited cofactors. To circumvent these technical issues and as a first step towards understanding the rules governing Hairy cofactor recruitment, we used the DamID approach to determine if the three known Hairy cofactors, Groucho, dCtBP, and dSir2, are recruited to all or a subset of Hairy targets. We generated Dam fusions to Groucho and dCtBP (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>). The Dam&#x02013;dSir2 fusion construct was described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020178-van3">van Steensel et al. 2001</xref>). While none of these cofactors binds DNA on its own, they are recruited to the DNA through their interaction with sequence-specific DNA binding proteins such as Hairy. Using the same procedure and statistical analyses used for the identification of Hairy targets in Kc cells (see Material and Methods; Datasets <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sd001">S1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sd004">S4&#x02013;S6</xref>), we identified 155 loci that recruit Groucho, 496 loci that recruit dCtBP, and 107 loci that recruit dSir2 in Kc cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020178-g007">Figure 7</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sd007">Datasets S7&#x02013;S9</xref>). Comparison for overlap between these cofactor datasets and that of Hairy from Kc cells showed that, surprisingly, only one of the putative Hairy targets we identified overlaps with Groucho recruitment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020178-g007">Figure 7</xref>A and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020178-g007">7</xref>D).

At present, we cannot rule out the possibility that a protein unrelated to Hairy is recruiting these cofactors to a given putative Hairy target. Interestingly, dCtBP and dSir2 appear to colocalize at loci outside the subset of putative Hairy targets (90&#x00025; of dSir2 targets overlap with those of dCtBP; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020178-g007">Figure 7</xref>D).</p></sec><sec id="s2h"><title>Hairy Target Gene Expression Depends on Hairy Cofactor Regulation In Vivo</title><p>If particular Hairy targets require specific cofactors to be appropriately regulated, we would expect their expression to be altered (deregulated) in a cofactor mutant background.

We chose to examine the expression of two <italic>hairy</italic> targets that are expressed relatively early in the embryo since these cofactors are used in a number of developmental systems and exhibit severe morphological phenotypes when their activity is removed maternally (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020178-Phippen1">Phippen et al. 2000</xref>).

For example, while Groucho and dCtBP are distributed along all the chromosomes, dSir2 shows region- and chromosome-specific binding (e.g., there are more dSir2 sites on Chromosome 2R than on Chromosome 3L). To confirm loci associated with recruitment of the different cofactors in vivo, we examined the localization of endogenous Groucho, dCtBP, and dSir2 on wild-type third instar larval salivary gland polytene chromosomes using antibodies to Groucho, dCtBP, and dSir2, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020178-g009">Figure 9</xref>B&#x02013;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020178-g009">9</xref>D). Consistent with the relative numbers of targets identified for each of the cofactors by the DamID approach, we find many more sites for dCtBP than either Groucho or dSir2. Also consistent with our DamID findings, Groucho overlaps with Hairy at only a small number of the Hairy binding sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020178-g009">Figure 9</xref>E), whereas dCtBP overlaps with the majority of Hairy binding sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020178-g009">Figure 9</xref>F). Differences in distribution for the cofactors observed by DamID are reflected on the polytene staining patterns. For example, our DamID data suggest that the distal portion of Chromosome 2L has more sites for dCtBP than the proximal half of the chromosome. This observation is reflected in dCtBP recruitment on the polytene chromosomes as well (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020178-g009">Figure 9</xref>F). Likewise, as predicted from the DamID data, dSir2 staining on the polytene chromosomes exhibits region-specific association in which some chromosomes and chromosomal regions exhibit a high degree of staining, while other whole chromosomes exhibit very little staining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020178-g009">Figure 9</xref>D and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020178-g009">9</xref>G&#x02013;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020178-g009">9</xref>I; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020178-Rosenberg1">Rosenberg and Parkhurst 2002</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Discussion</title><p>We have known for almost two decades that Hairy plays a pivotal role in the segmentation hierarchy, as well as other developmental processes, but the details of Hairy action have not been easy to tease apart. An important step in understanding the molecular mechanisms surrounding Hairy-mediated repression was made with the identification of Groucho as a Hairy binding protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020178-Paroush1">Paroush et al. 1994</xref>). One of the key remaining questions regarding the mechanism(s) of repression employed by Hairy concerns the identities of its direct transcriptional targets. We have employed a novel chromatin profiling approach, DamID, to effectively identify a total of 59 potentially direct Hairy targets from 2&#x02013;6-h embryos and Kc cells. As expected of direct targets, these genes show Hairy-dependent expression, are detected as Hairy binding sites in vivo on polytene chromosomes, and have consensus C-box-containing sequences that are directly bound by Hairy in vitro. While the DamID approach had previously been used only in Kc cells, we found that this technique is also powerful when utilizing transgenic embryos that carry fusions of the protein of interest to the Dam methylase. As target genes are likely context dependent, the use of embryos makes it possible to choose the precise time or place of development to be examined, as well as allowing the analysis to take place in an organismal context.</p><p>The 59 putative Hairy targets we identified in the embryo and Kc cell DamID experiments correspond to bands of Hairy immunostaining on polytene chromosomes, suggesting that the polytene chromosome staining faithfully represents Hairy binding. Polytene chromosomes are functionally similar in transcriptional activity and display factor/cofactor binding properties similar to chromatin of diploid interphase cells, despite their DNA endoreplication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020178-Hill2">Hill et al. 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020178-Andrew1">Andrew and Scott 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020178-Hill1">Hill and Mott 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020178-Pile1">Pile and Wassarman 2000</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020178-Pile2">2002</xref>). Since the microarray chips we used contain roughly half of <italic>Drosophila</italic> cDNAs, we estimate the actual number of Hairy targets to be approximately twice that number (i.e., 118 targets). This predicted number of Hairy targets is close to the approximately 120 strongly staining sites we observe on polytene chromosomes. Of the 59 putative Hairy targets we identified in both the Kc cell and embryo DamID experiments, 58 correspond to bands of Hairy staining on the polytene chromosomes, suggesting that polytene chromosome staining is representing Hairy binding sites without regard to tissue specificity. It is not yet clear what is limiting Hairy accessibility in different tissues or why Hairy's access does not appear to be limited in salivary glands. It may be that polytene chromosome organization necessitates a looser chromatin structure or that the large number of factors that seem to be endogenously expressed in salivary glands affects accessibility. Ultimately, additional confirmation of the DamID and polytene staining correspondence will require microarray tiling chips containing overlapping genomic DNA fragments; however, such genomic DNA tiling chips are currently unavailable.</p><p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020178-van2">Van Steensel and Henikoff (2000)</xref> showed that DNA methylation by tethered Dam spreads up to a few kilobases from the point where it is brought to the DNA.

Indeed, as Hairy has been described as a long-range repressor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020178-Barolo1">Barolo and Levine 1997</xref>), it is likely to bind at a distance from the transcription start site.

Pair-rule genes have been split into two groups: primary pair-rule genes mediate the transition from nonperiodic to reiterated patterns via positional cues received directly from the gap genes, whereas secondary pair-rule genes take their patterning cues from the primary pair-rule genes and in turn regulate the segment polarity and homeotic gene expression. The transcriptional regulator <italic>prd</italic> was originally categorized as a secondary pair-rule gene since its expression is affected by mutations in all other known pair-rule genes. However, <italic>prd</italic> stripes were subsequently shown to require gap gene products for their establishment, and the <italic>prd</italic> locus has the modular promoter structure associated with primary pair-rule genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020178-Baumgartner1">Baumgartner and Noll 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020178-Gutjahr1">Gutjahr et al. 1993</xref>). Thus, <italic>prd</italic> has properties of both primary and secondary pair-rule genes and is a good candidate to directly mediate Hairy's effects on segmentation. We found that Hairy can specifically bind to C-box sequences in the <italic>prd</italic> promoter and interacts genetically with <italic>prd</italic>. Further experiments will be required to determine if Paired in turn binds to the <italic>ftz</italic> promoter, such that the order of regulation would be Hairy &#x0003e; <italic>prd</italic> &#x0003e; <italic>ftz</italic>.</p><p>In addition to identifying potential targets for Hairy in segmentation, we identified targets that implicate Hairy in other processes including cell cycle, cell growth, and morphogenesis.

Consistent with a role for Hairy in growth signaling, mammalian HES family proteins have been linked to insulin signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020178-Yamada1">Yamada et al. 2003</xref>).</p><p>Since cells that are dividing or proliferating cannot simultaneously undergo the cell shape changes and cell migrations required for morphogenetic movements, Hairy may be required to transiently pause the cell cycle in a spatially and temporally defined manner, thereby allowing the cell fate decisions regulated by the transcription cascade to be completed. As Hairy is itself spatially and temporally expressed, Hairy must be only one of several genes necessary to orchestrate these processes. While much progress has been made in understanding the regulatory networks governing pattern formation, cell proliferation, and morphogenesis, and while it is clear that they must be integrated, the details surrounding their coordination have not yet been elucidated. Thus, the putative Hairy targets we identified are consistent with known processes involving Hairy and suggest that in addition to regulating pattern formation, Hairy plays a role in transiently repressing other events, perhaps in order to coordinate cell cycle events with the segmentation cascade. Further experiments will be needed to determine how these different roles for Hairy fit together.</p></sec><sec id="s3b"><title>Cofactor Recruitment</title><p>Corepressor recruitment is an important aspect of transcriptional repression (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020178-Mannervik3">Mannervik et al. 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020178-Bone1">Bone and Roth 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020178-Mannervik1">Mannervik 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020178-Urnov1">Urnov et al. 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020178-Jepsen1">Jepsen and Rosenfeld 2002</xref>). While the sequence-specific DNA-bound repressors contribute to target specificity, the corepressors are thought to help distinguish among particular repression mechanisms to be used via alteration of their recruitment or function. For example, the <italic>Drosophila</italic> developmental factors Dorsal and T-cell factor (TCF) have been shown to function as either positive or negative regulators of transcription depending on promoter context and cofactor recruitment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020178-Dubnicoff1">Dubnicoff et al. 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020178-Cavallo1">Cavallo et al. 1998</xref>). As each of Hairy's cofactors appears to act differently with Hairy, thereby conferring different developmental consequences, we used the DamID approach, along with polytene chromosome staining, to get our first look at the patterns of Hairy's cofactor recruitment.</p><p>The numbers of loci that recruit Groucho, dCtBP, and dSir2 cofactors are consistent with the breadth of interaction they have been shown to exhibit. We identified by DamID profiling 155 loci that recruit Groucho and, as expected, found roughly twice as many sites on polytene chromosomes. Groucho was one of the first corepressors identified and shown to affect a variety of different developmental processes, suggesting that it is a widely used corepressor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020178-Parkhurst1">Parkhurst 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020178-Chen1">Chen and Courey 2000</xref>). In addition to its interaction with Hairy, Groucho was subsequently shown to mediate repression through several other classes of DNA-binding transcriptional regulators including Engrailed, Dorsal, T-cell factor, and Runt (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020178-Aronson1">Aronson et al. 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020178-Dubnicoff1">Dubnicoff et al. 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020178-Jimenez1">Jim&#x000e9;nez et al. 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020178-Cavallo1">Cavallo et al. 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020178-Roose1">Roose et al. 1998</xref>).</p><p>Although Groucho was the first Hairy cofactor identified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020178-Paroush1">Paroush et al. 1994</xref>) and its interaction site is often described as Hairy's &#x0201c;major&#x0201d; repression motif (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020178-Mannervik1">Mannervik 2001</xref>), we find that it is associated with only a minority of Hairy targets in Kc cells. Groucho's dominance as a cofactor during segmentation may reflect a preference for Groucho in the reporter assays used previously to assess corepressor activity, or it may be more heavily recruited to Hairy's targets during segmentation. In the future it will be interesting to determine the loci that recruit Groucho in early embryos and, as Groucho binds a number of other repressors, which, if any, of these factors recruits Groucho as its major cofactor.</p><p>CtBP was identified more recently, first on the basis of its binding to the C-terminal region of E1A, and in <italic>Drosophila</italic> by its association with the developmental repressors Hairy and Knirps (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020178-Turner1">Turner and Crossley 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020178-Chinnadurai1">Chinnadurai 2002a</xref>). CtBP is an integral component in a variety of multiprotein transcriptional complexes. It has been shown to function as a context-dependent cofactor, having both positive and negative effects on transcriptional repression depending upon the repressor to which it is recruited. More than 40 different repressors have been shown to recruit CtBP. Consistent with this wide recruitment of CtBP, we identified 496 loci that recruit dCtBP by DamID profiling and roughly twice that many sites on polytene chromosomes. A recently reported global protein&#x02013;protein interaction study showed that the binding partners for Groucho and dCtBP are largely nonoverlapping (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020178-Giot1">Giot et al. 2003</xref>). This, along with the near exclusivity of Groucho and dCtBP binding as assayed by DamID and polytene chromosome staining, makes it unlikely that both cofactors work together as a general rule and strengthens the possibility that the binding of each of these factors assembles different protein complexes that are, for the most part, mutually exclusive.</p><p>dSir2 was only very recently identified as a corepressor for Hairy and other HES family members (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020178-Rosenberg1">Rosenberg and Parkhurst 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020178-Takata1">Takata and Ishikawa 2003</xref>). We identified 107 loci that recruit dSir2 by DamID profiling and roughly twice that many sites on polytene chromosomes. Surprisingly, the distribution of loci recruiting dSir2 identified by DamID profiling, as well as dSir2&#x02032;s staining on polytene chromosomes, shows regional binding specificity (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020178-g009">Figure 9</xref>D and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020178-g009">9</xref>G). This binding specificity may be a reflection of the different nuclear compartments that these regions of the chromosomes find themselves in (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020178-Francastel1">Francastel et al. 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020178-Leitch1">Leitch 2000</xref>). Sir2 has been described mostly as a protein involved in heterochromatic silencing rather than in euchromatic repression. The number of dSir2 euchromatic sites we observe is similar to that of Groucho, suggesting that euchromatic repressors (in addition to HES family members) are likely to recruit Sir2. Consistent with this, a recent report has described a role for mammalian Sir2 in repressing the muscle cell differentiation program (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020178-Fulco1">Fulco et al. 2003</xref>). The region-specific binding of dSir2 might reflect a difference in the types of factors it can associate with, or the association of dSir2 with particular chromosomal regions or nuclear domains (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020178-Spellman1">Spellman and Rubin 2002</xref>).</p><p>Interestingly, dCtBP and dSir2 recruitment are largely overlapping, and this association continues outside of those loci where Hairy binds: 90&#x00025; of dSir2-recruiting loci also recruit dCtBP. dCtBP and dSir2 are unique among transcriptional coregulators in that they both encode NAD<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>-dependent enzymatic activities. As NAD and NADH levels within the cell exist in closely regulated equilibrium (for review see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020178-Dang1">Dang et al. 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020178-Ziegler1">Ziegler 2000</xref>), it is possible that dCtBP and dSir2 function as NAD/NADH redox sensors (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020178-Denu1">Denu 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020178-Fjeld1">Fjeld et al. 2003</xref>). In this way, the cell could use coenzyme metabolites to coordinate the transcriptional activity of differentiation-specific genes with the cellular redox state.</p><p>The success of the combination of DamID profiling and polytene chromosome staining results provides a global systematic way in which to address a number of mechanistic questions concerning the rules governing cofactor recruitment. For example, it will be possible to address whether target gene location or promoter structure determines the accessibility of cofactors to specifically bound repressors or whether, conversely, the association of repressors with cofactors influences target gene choice by altering DNA binding specificity. We now have a number of direct Hairy targets and in vivo assay systems to use in future experiments addressing questions surrounding Hairy's biological functions and the precise molecular mechanisms it employs to carry out its functions.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title/><sec id="s4a1"><title>DamID.</title><p>To generate Dam&#x02013;Hairy or Dam&#x02013;dCtBP, a full-length <italic>hairy</italic> or <italic>dCtBP</italic> cDNA fragment was generated by standard PCR using primers containing a BglII 5&#x02032; site and a XbaI 3&#x02032; site, cut with BglII and XbaI, and subcloned into the BglII and XbaI sites of pNMycDam plasmid, as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020178-van2">van Steensel and Henikoff 2000</xref>).

The Dam&#x02013;Hairy fusion protein is functional because presence of the UAS&#x02013;Dam&#x02013;Hairy transgene, but not the UAS&#x02013;Dam transgene, partially rescues the segmentation phenotype of <italic>hairy</italic> mutant embryos when induced with an actin&#x02013;Gal4 driver (rescue is similar to UAS&#x02013;Hairy; data not shown).

In particular, <italic>Drosophila</italic> promoter sequences were captured using Apollo Genome Sequence and Annotation Tool (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020178-Lewis1">Lewis et al. 2002</xref>). Match v1.0-public (BIOBASE Biological Databases, Wolfenb&#x000fc;ttel, Germany) was used to search promoter sequences for known transcription factor binding sites using a library of mononucleotide-weighted matrices from TRANSFAC v6.0.

Sequences were interrogated using only high-quality <italic>Drosophila</italic> transcription factor binding sites found in TRANSFAC v6.0, and the software parameters were adjusted to minimize the sum of false positives and false negatives. The number of Hairy binding sites found in target gene promoters was tallied (excluding &#x0201c;hits&#x0201d; to AT-rich regions &#x0005b;assigned to CF2-II, BRC-Z1, and BRC-Z4&#x0005d; that were ubiquitous in both the target and nontarget sequence under analysis). Using the Hairy site closest to transcription start site, the composition of transcription factor binding sites adjacent to (within 500 bp of) the Hairy site was assessed. This was also performed for non-Hairy targets selected because they contained one or more core C-box sequences. Matrices were compared that matched percentages of known Hairy targets (<italic>egh2, egh3, prd1, ac1, and stg1</italic>) to C-box&#x02013;containing nontargets.</p></sec><sec id="s4a6"><title>Chromosomes.</title><p>Wild-type or pstg &#x003b2;E4.9 third instar larval salivary gland polytene chromosomes were prepared and stained for endogenous proteins essentially as described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020178-Andrew1">Andrew and Scott (1994)</xref>.
