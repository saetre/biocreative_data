In tumours, the extracellular matrix (ECM) composition differs from normal tissue and allows novel interactions to influence tumour cell function. The ECM protein tenascin-C (TNC) is frequently up-regulated in breast cancer and we have previously identified two novel isoforms &#x02013; one containing exon 16 (TNC-16) and one containing exons 14 plus 16 (TNC-14/16).</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p>The present study has analysed the functional significance of this altered TNC isoform profile in breast cancer. TNC-16 and TNC-14/16 splice variants were generated using PCR-ligation and over-expressed in breast cancer cells (MCF-7, T47D, MDA-MD-231, MDA-MB-468, GI101) and human fibroblasts. The effects of these variants on tumour cell invasion and proliferation were measured and compared with the effects of the large (TNC-L) and fully spliced small (TNC-S) isoforms.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>TNC-16 and TNC-14/16 significantly enhanced tumour cell proliferation (<italic>P </italic>&#x0003c; 0.05) and invasion, both directly (<italic>P </italic>&#x0003c; 0.01) and as a response to transfected fibroblast expression (<italic>P </italic>&#x0003c; 0.05) with this effect being dependent on tumour cell interaction with TNC, because TNC-blocking antibodies abrogated these responses. An analysis of 19 matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and tissue inhibitor of matrix metalloproteinases 1 to 4 (TIMP 1 to 4) revealed that TNC up-regulated expression of MMP-13 and TIMP-3 two to four fold relative to vector, and invasion was reduced in the presence of MMP inhibitor GM6001. However, this effect was not isoform-specific but was elicited equally by all TNC isoforms.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>These results demonstrate a dual requirement for TNC and MMP in enhancing breast cancer cell invasion, and identify a significant role for the tumour-associated TNC-16 and TNC-14/16 in promoting tumour invasion, although these isoform-specific effects appear to be mediated through MMP-independent mechanisms.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Introduction</title><p>Cellular interactions with the extracellular matrix (ECM) are critical in the modulation of cell growth, migration, invasion and tissue-specific gene expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. The ECM around tumours differs markedly from that in normal tissues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>] and therefore is likely to deliver different signals to tumour cells, which will impact on their behaviour. One of the most consistent changes in the ECM of many solid tumours is up-regulation of the matrix glycoprotein, tenascin-C (TNC) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. TNC is a complex multifunctional protein, which has been shown to promote cell migration, inhibit focal contact formation, promote angiogenesis and, in some systems, act as a cell survival factor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. Each TNC subunit consists of an N-terminal tenascin assembly region, 14.5 epidermal growth factor-like (EGF) repeat domains, a variable number of fibronectin type III-like repeats (FN III) and a C-terminal fibrinogen-like domain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>] (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). Multiple isoforms of TNC can be generated through alternative splicing of nine FN III repeats between conserved repeats 5 and 6 (exons 9 and 17) at the pre-mRNA level and these may have differing effects. For example, in the developing mouse central nervous system, up to 27 distinct splice variants have been identified and are expressed in a strict temporal-spatial manner supporting a role for these variants in specific neurone-glia interactions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. A number of studies have shown that specific functions are mediated by distinct domains of TNC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>] and there is growing evidence to indicate that the biological function of TNC is dependent on the splicing pattern [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. This raises the possibility that tumour-associated stroma can generate novel interactions with tumour cells through the expression of different TNC splice variants. In keeping with this, changes in the pattern of TNC isoform expression have been described in a number of malignancies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>], the nature of which appears to be tumour-type specific.</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Schematic diagram of tenascin-C.

Up-regulation of these isoforms has also been reported in ovarian carcinoma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]; however, their effect on tumour cell behaviour has not been established.</p><p>A further consistent change in the tumour stromal environment is up-regulation of proteolytic enzymes, particularly members of the matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) family.

Regulation of MMP expression and activity is complex, and may be mediated through naturally occurring tissue inhibitors of MMP (TIMP) or by direct regulation of gene expression. Several studies have indicated a role for TNC in regulating MMP gene expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>].</p><p>The aim of this study was to investigate directly the effects of tumour-associated TNC-16 and TNC-14/16 isoforms on breast cancer cell behaviour and to determine whether these isoforms modulate tumour cell behaviour through regulation of MMP.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Cell lines and primary cells</title><p>Breast cancer cell lines (MCF-7, T47D, MDA MB 231, ZR-75-1, MDA MB 468, GI101, MDA MB 436, HS578T, SkMel 28) and the human fetal foreskin fibroblast cell line hfff2 were obtained from ATCC (American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, VA, USA).

We previously have shown that, in addition to a quantitative change in TNC in breast cancer, there is a consistent change in the pattern of TNC isoform expression, with induction of two additional isoforms &#x02013; TNC-16 and TNC-14/16 &#x02013; rarely detected in normal resting breast [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. In this study analysis of a series of breast cancer cell lines demonstrated expression of TNC-16 and/or TNC-14/16 in all oestrogen receptor (ER) negative lines characterised by more aggressive behaviour [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>], but not in the ER-positive cell lines. We demonstrated that each of these TNC isoforms increased breast cancer cell invasion significantly and also enhanced tumour cell proliferation. The largest, unspliced isoform TNC-L has been associated with a motile phenotype most frequently [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>] and, in keeping with this, was found to promote invasion in this study. However, the effect was significantly less than obtained with expression of the tumour-associated TNC-14/16 isoforms and, in all but GI101 cells, also with TNC-16. The fully spliced, adult-type TNC-S had no effect on tumour cell invasion or proliferation, consistent with its role as a component of normal basement membrane in many tissues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>].</p><p>Inclusion of domains within the alternatively spliced FN III region may alter the biological function of TNC through a number of mechanisms. Some of the domains introduce new adhesion motifs, for example, domain D (exon 14) contains a binding site for &#x003b1;7&#x003b2;1 integrin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>], domains B and D interact with the cell adhesion molecule F3/contactin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>], while the A1-4/BD region binds to the cell surface receptor annexin II [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>]. Domains A3 and D also contain sites susceptible to proteolytic cleavage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>] leading to generation of TNC fragments that have been implicated in tumour progression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>]. Finally, the alternatively spliced FN III region can also modify the interaction of TNC with other ECM proteins, specifically fibronectin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>]. Thus, the precise structure of the TNC molecule determines the final biological effect.</p><p>The mechanism by which TNC-16 and TNC-14/16 promote breast cancer cell invasion and proliferation is unclear, although it does appear to require direct interaction between the tumour cell and the protein, because the pro-invasive effect was blocked by TNC antibody. Furthermore, the effect of stromal-derived isoforms appear to be mediated through a direct effect on the tumour cell rather than modification of fibroblast function because the promotion of invasion by TNC-transfected fibroblast CM was completely abrogated by anti-TNC antibodies, suggesting that in transwell assays the soluble TNC within the CM is acting as a chemoattractant mediating in the effect on invasion. These data imply a novel adhesive interaction between TNC-16, TNC-14/16 and the breast cancer cells, although the nature of this currently is unclear. It is unlikely that this interaction replicates the described interaction between domain D (exon 14) and &#x003b1;7&#x003b2;1 on neurites [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>], because these breast cancer cells do not express &#x003b1;7 integrin (unpublished data). It is interesting that TNC-L, which contains both exons 14 and 16, does not promote invasion to the same extent as the smaller isoforms. This is reminiscent of the interplay between domains identified in fibronectin. The central Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD)-containing 120FN fragment of fibronectin induces MMP expression in rabbit synovial fibroblasts, but regions outside this domain inhibit this induction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>]. Thus it is plausible that additional domains in the TNC-L protein counteract the invasion-promoting effect of exons 14 and 16. Further work using peptide fragments to investigate the interactions between different domains of TNC would help dissect these functions.</p><p>The actions of MMPs have been implicated in many aspects of cancer progression including invasion, as a result of proteolytic cleavage of MMPs and cell adhesion molecules [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>], and may influence tumour growth via release of matrix-bound growth factors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>]. The importance of MMP activity in the systems used in this study is demonstrated by the significant reduction of tumour cell invasion by a broad-spectrum MMP inhibitor. This led us to investigate whether TNC-16 and TNC-14/16 isoforms up-regulate MMP expression or activity. A relationship between TNC and MMP expression has been implied in a number of studies, generally as a result of correlation of expression levels or co-localisation in tissue studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>]. There also is emerging evidence that TNC can modulate MMP levels directly. Tremble and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>] showed that TNC could increase MMP-1, 3 and 9 expression in rabbit synovial fibroblasts, but only in collaboration with fibronectin and not if added as a soluble protein. Kalembeyi and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>] demonstrated up-regulation of MMP-9 expression in mouse mammary carcinoma cells in response to exogenous TNC, while a recent study reported that the invasion-promoting effect of TNC on glioma cells is mediated through up-regulation of MMP-12 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>].</p><p>In this study, an extensive analysis of MMP and TIMP expression revealed that TNC up-regulates MMP-13 and TIMP-3, but that this is not specific to TNC-16 or TNC-14/16 isoforms, with TNC-S, which does not generate enhanced tumour invasion over control levels, also elevating expression levels to a similar extent. Both MMP-13 and TIMP-3 have been implicated in breast cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>]. Thus their induction by TNC may be of relevance <italic>in vivo</italic>, although in the systems used in this study, they do not appear to be specifically mediating the tumour-promoter effect of TNC-16 and TNC-14/16. Furthermore, no change in MMP activity, as revealed by zymographic analysis, was seen in relation to different TNC isoforms. Thus, although MMP activity is clearly required for invasion, these results suggest that TNC-16 and TNC-14/16 mediate their action through MMP-independent mechanisms. TNC has been shown to up-regulate MMP in previous studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]; however, this difference may be due to a number of reasons: species- and cell-type differences; the collaborating effect of other MMPs; a three-dimensional environment compared with the monolayer system used in this study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]; and, of key importance, the nature of the TNC protein being investigated.</p><p>The precise nature of the TNC protein employed in previous studies is unclear. However, if obtained commercially, as it appears to be in at least one of the studies, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>] it is likely to represent a mixture of isoforms predominantly of the largest splice variants and these could have quite distinct functions from the isoforms used in the present study. Although we did not demonstrate any interaction between TNC-S and TNC-16 or TNC-14/16 in co-transfection experiments, we did not investigate the additional influence of TNC-L as this was less frequently detected in the breast carcinoma tissues we analysed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>].</p><p>It is possible, and quite likely, that different TNC isoforms exert their biological effects through different mechanisms. Thus while it appears that many TNC species can influence MMP expression, it is possible that TNC-16 and TNC-14/16 mediate their effects on invasion and proliferation by signalling through tumour cell adhesion receptors rather than through MMP up-regulation. It is clear, however, that in the system described in this study MMPs are a key requirement for tumour invasion. The interplay of different factors in mediating a process as complex as invasion is not surprising, and the inter-dependence of multiple factors in this process has previously been reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>This study demonstrates a dual requirement for TNC and MMP activity in breast cancer cell invasion and it confirms that the tumour-associated TNC-16 and TNC-14/16 isoforms significantly enhance this invasive process, even above the TNC-L isoform traditionally associate with cell migration. The almost universal and high level of expression of these isoforms in breast carcinomas coupled with their largely tumour-restricted distribution make them a plausible therapeutic target, a strategy that already is being employed for tumour-restricted TNC isoforms in other systems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Abbreviations</title><p>BSA: bovine serum albumin; CM: conditioning medium; ECM: extracellular matrix; EGF: epidermal growth factor; ELISA: enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay; ER: oestrogen receptor; DMEM: Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; FBS: fetal bovine serum; FN III: fibronectin type III-like repeats; HPRT1: hypoxanthine phosphoribosyltransferase 1; MII: mean invasion index; MMP: matrix metalloproteinase; PCR: polymerase chain reaction; RT-PCR: reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction; TIMP: tissue inhibitor of matrix metalloproteinases; TNC: tenascin C; TNC-16: tenascin C with only exon 16 of variable region; TNC 14/16: tenascin C with only exons 14 and 16 of variable region; TNC-L: tenascin C largest splice variant; TNC-S: tenascin C smallest splice variant.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>JHP and JS created the TNC isoform expression vectors.
