The activity of P-TEFb is regulated, in part, by reversible association with one of two HEXIMs and the 7SK snRNP. A recent proteomics survey revealed that P-TEFb and the HEXIMs are tightly connected to two previously-uncharacterized proteins, the methyphosphate capping enzyme, MEPCE, and a La-related protein, LARP7. Glycerol gradient sedimentation analysis of lysates from cells treated with P-TEFb inhibitors, suggested that the 7SK snRNP reorganized such that LARP7 and 7SK remained associated after P-TEFb and HEXIM1 were released. Immunodepletion of LARP7 also depleted most of the 7SK regardless of the presence of P-TEFb, HEXIM or hnRNP A1 in the complex. Small interfering RNA knockdown of LARP7 in human cells decreased the steady-state level of 7SK, led to an initial increase in free P-TEFb and increased Tat transactivation of the HIV-1 LTR. Knockdown of LARP7 or 7SK ultimately caused a decrease in total P-TEFb protein levels. Our studies have identified LARP7 as a 7SK-binding protein and suggest that free P-TEFb levels are determined by a balance between release from the large form and reduction of total P-TEFb.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>The human positive transcription elongation factor b (P-TEFb), which is composed of Cdk9 and cyclin T1 or cyclin T2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1 B2 B3">1&#x02013;3</xref>), stimulates the elongation phase of transcription by reversing the effects of negative elongation factors [for recent reviews see (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>)]. P-TEFb plays an important role in the transcription of cellular genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>), and is also a key factor for the expression of the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) genome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7 B8 B9">7&#x02013;9</xref>). Previous studies have shown that a complex containing the 7SK small nuclear RNA (snRNA), a 332-nucleotide transcript synthesized by RNAPIII (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>), and the RNA binding proteins HEXIM1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>) or HEXIM2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>) can interact with P-TEFb and inhibit its kinase activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>). Signal transduction pathways have been implicated in the general release of P-TEFb from the large form during cardiac hypertrophy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>) and upon treatment of cells with the differentiation agent, HMBA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>). Also, transfection of cells with the HIV transactivator, Tat, leads to release of P-TEFb from the large form and the formation of a Tat&#x02022;P&#x02013;TEFb complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>). Recent results from several labs indicate that P-TEFb may play a critical role during development. Poised polymerases have been found on most human genes in embryonic stem cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>) and on most developmental control genes in Drosophila (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>).</p><p>Recently, soluble human protein complexes containing components of the transcription and RNA processing machineries were analyzed using protein affinity purification coupled to mass spectrometry. Thirty-two tagged polypeptides yielded a network of 805 high-confidence interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>). This study revealed that besides its positive (Brd4) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>) and negative (HEXIMs and 7SK snRNA) regulators, P-TEFb is tightly connected to many other proteins, including the previously uncharacterized protein BCDIN3 [Bicoid-interacting 3, homolog (Drosophila)]. BCDIN3 is a conserved methyltransferase that has the ability to add a methyl group on the &#x003b3;-phosphate of 7SK and because of this was renamed the methyl phosphate capping enzyme, MEPCE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>). The addition of this unusual mono-methyl cap structure to RNAPIII-synthesized snRNAs, such as 7SK, was previously shown to occur post-transcriptionally and to be important for protecting the RNA from exonucleolytic degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>). Indeed, it has been shown that the cap structure enhances the stability of U6 and 7SK snRNAs and that uncapped U6 snRNA is rapidly degraded (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>). In support for a role of capping by MEPCE on 7SK stability, silencing of MEPCE was shown to decrease the steady-state level of cellular 7SK <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>). Here we follow-up on another previously uncharacterized protein, LARP7, which was discovered to be connected with P-TEFb and HEXIM proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>).</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Affinity purification of a human LARP7-containing complex</title><p>The cDNA encoding human LARP7 (Invitrogen; accession number BC066945) was cloned into the mammalian expression vector pMZI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>) carrying a tandem affinity purification (TAP) tag at its C-terminus and a stable human embryonic kidney (HEK) cell line EcR-293 (derived from HEK 293) carrying this construct was produced (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>).

Trizol reagent (Invitrogen) was then added directly to the beads to extract immunoprecipitated 7SK according to the manufacturer's protocol. Extracted RNA was resolved on a denaturing 6% TBE acrylamide RNA gel, ethidium bromide (EtBr) stained, and visualized using a cooled charge-coupled camera (UVP).

TZM-bl cells, HeLa-cell derivatives that are stably transduced with a LTR-driven firefly luciferase cassette, were obtained from the NIH AIDS Reference and Reagent Program.

After an incubation of 3 h, cells were co-transfected with 0.5 &#x000b5;g of the luciferase reporter construct and 0.1 &#x000b5;g of the Tat expressing plasmid or control plasmid. The plasmid encoding Tat (SV CMV Tat), the control plasmid (SV CMVexPA), as well as the LTR-driven firefly luciferase plasmid (pGL2-43-LTR-luc) were described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>). Transfected cells were collected 24 h post-final transfection and lysed using the luciferase assay system buffer (Promega). The protein concentration in cell lysates was determined using the Bio-Rad Protein Assay kit (Bio-Rad Laboratories). The luciferase activity was measured using the Dual-Luciferase&#x000ae; Reporter Assay System (Promega).</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>RESULTS</title><sec><title>LARP7 is associated with P-TEFb, HEXIM1/2, MEPCE and 7SK RNA</title><p>In a recent study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>), a protein interaction network of human transcription and RNA processing machinery was constructed. P-TEFb was found to be associated with its negative regulators (HEXIMs and 7SK snRNA), the 7SK capping enzyme (MEPCE), and among other proteins, a previously uncharacterized protein, LARP7. A bioinformatics analysis revealed that LARP7 is a member of a family of about a dozen La related proteins generated from seven human genes. Of all the family members LARP7 is the most closely related to La. In their amino terminal halves, both La and LARP7 contain the La domain and an associated RNA recognition motif (RRM1) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>A). A recent structure determination using a co-crystal of La and an RNA oligo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>) strongly suggests that both the La domain and RRM1 are involved in the interaction of La with the 3&#x02032; end of newly synthesized RNAPIII transcripts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>). Both proteins also contain a second RRM (RRM3) in their carboxyl terminal half (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>A). Previous studies have shown that the La protein is a multifunctional protein that binds to and plays key roles in RNA metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>). In the study presented here, we further characterize the association of LARP7 with the 7SK snRNP and determine the functional consequences of knocking down LARP7 in human cells. <fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p>LARP7 is associated with P-TEFb, HEXIM, MEPCE, 7SK snRNA and U6 snRNA.

The proteins found in affinity purified LARP7 complexes were identified by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) after separation of the proteins on an SDS gel. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>B shows the composition of the TAP-tagged LARP7 eluate. Proteins that have been either identified in a control eluate prepared from the non-induced cell extract or represent interactions that had Interaction Reliability scores below a stringent threshold (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>) were not listed. RNA extracted from the TAP-tagged LARP7 eluate was subjected to northern analysis. Consistent with the results obtained earlier with MEPCE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>), 7SK and U6 snRNAs, but not U2 snRNA were pulled down with LARP7 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>C). As we have previously shown for the MEPCE-TAP eluate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>), both 7SK and U6 RNAs were found partially degraded when compared to their respective cellular counterpart isolated from total cell RNA. This is due to extensive incubations of the RNPs in crude extracts. Also relatively less U6 came down with LARP7 compared to that brought down by MEPCE suggesting that LARP7 might preferentially associate with 7SK or that MEPCE might preferentially associate with U6. Combining the data obtained from the previous study in which MEPCE and Cdk9 were tagged (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>) with the data obtained here by TAP tagging LARP7 allowed us to construct an interaction network for LARP7, MEPCE and P-TEFb (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>D). Note that arrows point from the tagged protein to the protein discovered to interact. Many of the proteins discovered interact with both MEPCE and LARP7. Not surprisingly, LARP7 is tightly connected to P-TEFb (cyclin T1 and Cdk9 subunits), its negative regulatory factors (HEXIM1 and HEXIM2) and MEPCE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>D). Together, our results indicate that LARP7 may be a part of the 7SK<bold>&#x02022;</bold>HEXIM<bold>&#x02022;</bold>MEPCE<bold>&#x02022;</bold>P-TEFb snRNP. To facilitate further analysis of the endogenous LARP7 protein, we developed a highly specific LARP7 antibody in sheep that detects a band near the predicted molecular weight (69 kDa) of LARP7 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>E).</p></sec><sec><title>LARP7 co-sediments with large form P-TEFb and 7SK</title><p>To analyze the potential association of LARP7 and MEPCE with P-TEFb, HEXIM1 and 7SK, glycerol gradient sedimentation analysis of HeLa cell lysates was carried out. Otherwise identical cultures were either mock-treated or treated with 500 nM Flavopiridol for 1 h. Flavopiridol is a potent P-TEFb inhibitor that leads to inhibition of RNAPII transcription and to the release of P-TEFb and HEXIM1 from the large 7SK containing snRNP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>). As expected, in control cells most of the P-TEFb (cyclin T1 and Cdk9) and about 20% of HEXIM1 were found in fractions 9&#x02013;11 that contain the 7SK snRNP with inactive P-TEFb (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>A). The 7SK capping enzyme, MEPCE, was previously found in a complex containing P-TEFb, HEXIM1 and 7SK (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>). Here slightly less than half of MEPCE was found to co-sediment with P-TEFb in control cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>A) and the rest exhibited a slower sedimentation (found toward the top of the gradient). This observation is not surprising since MEPCE was found associated predominantly with U6 snRNA and could potentially be associated with other small RNAs that it targets for capping (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>). LARP7, on the other hand, completely co-sedimented with P-TEFb and HEXIM1 in the 7SK snRNP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>A). Flavopiridol treatment led to the expected release of P-TEFb and HEXIM1 from the 7SK snRNP and subsequent shift towards the top of the gradient (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>B). MEPCE sedimentation was unaffected. However, LARP7 shifted about one fraction down the gradient (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>B). <fig id="F2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><p>LARP7 co-sediments with the 7SK snRNP before and after P-TEFb and HEXIM release.

To be sure that the shift in 7SK was not due to differences in the sedimentation or fractionation of the two samples, we visualized other RNAs with EtBr staining of the gel before the transfer. The pattern of sedimentation of other RNAs was identical between the two gradients, but as was found by the northern analysis, the pattern of 7SK changed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>D). These data strongly suggest that LARP7 remains in a stable complex with the 7SK snRNP even after Flavopiridol treatment and the release of P-TEFb and HEXIM1 from the snRNP. The shift down the gradient is likely due to association of hnRNP proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39 B40 B41">39&#x02013;41</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>LARP7 is a stable component of the 7SK snRNP</title><p>Results presented so far strongly suggest that LARP7 forms a complex with the large form of P-TEFb and remains in complex with 7SK after P-TEFb release. To determine if endogenous LARP7 is actually a component of these complexes, we carried out a series of immunoprecipitation experiments using an affinity purified LARP7 antibody. Glycerol gradient fractions 8&#x02013;11, which contain &#x0223c;80% of LARP7 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>A and B), were pooled from either control or Flavopiridol-treated cells and passed over beads that lacked antibody or had LARP7 antibody covalently attached. Analysis by either northern blot or EtBr staining of the RNA gel gave the same result. About 90% of 7SK was retained on the beads containing LARP7 antibody, but not on control beads (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>A). Here, because care was taken to avoid ribonucleases, all the 7SK detected was intact. This indicates that LARP7 interacts with full length 7SK and not just the degradation products detected after the TAP purification earlier. Flavopiridol treatment of cells and the subsequent release of P-TEFb and HEXIM did not change the association of 7SK with LARP7 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>A). Pulldown of 7SK from these samples was highly specific, and did not affect the binding of the other small RNAs found in the gradient fractions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>A, ethidium bromide). Immunoprecipitation of LARP7 also resulted in the immunodepletion of HEXIM1 and Cdk9 from control gradient samples, and as expected these two proteins were absent from the samples from Flavopiridol-treated cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>A, western blot). Some, but not all, of the MEPCE was pulled down with the LARP7 antibody and treatment of cells with Flavopiridol caused less MEPCE to be pulled down (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>A, western blot). <fig id="F3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><p>Immunoprecipitation of LARP7 confirms that it is a stable component of the 7SK snRNP.

As increasing amounts of LARP7 were added, two 7SK mobility shifts were observed. The two RNPs could be due to the binding of LARP7 to one or two molecules of 7SK or one or two molecules of LARP7 binding to a single molecule of 7SK. From these results we conclude that LARP7 binds directly to 7SK.</p><p>To further examine the proteins associated with the 7SK snRNP before and after release of P-TEFb, immunoprecipitations from whole cell extracts of control cells or cells treated with another P-TEFb inhibitor, DRB, were performed using LARP7, HEXIM1 and hnRNP A1 antibodies. Regardless of the presence of the large form of P-TEFb, LARP7 was associated with a significant fraction of 7SK (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>C). Immunoprecipitation of the 7SK snRNP from control cells using a HEXIM1 antibody verified that LARP7 is associated with this complex before but not after release of P-TEFb (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>C). Recent research has shown that HEXIM and P-TEFb are replaced by hnRNP proteins after release from the 7SK snRNP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>). Here we confirm that the association of hnRNP A1 with 7SK increases after release, and show that only after release does hnRNP A1 associate with LARP7. Note that the immunoprecipitation with the LARP7 antibody brought down only a small fraction (less than 5%) of the hnRNP A1 protein which is more clearly seen with a longer exposure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>C, bottom blot). The low fraction bound to 7SK is expected since hnRNP A1 is found in many other RNPs. Overall, these results demonstrate that LARP7 is a stable component of the 7SK snRNP while HEXIM1, P-TEFb and hnRNP A1 are not.</p></sec><sec><title>Knockdown of LARP7 decreases the steady-state level of 7SK while increasing free P-TEFb and enhancing Tat-mediated transcription</title><p>Given the well-established role of the La protein in the protection of RNAPIII transcripts from 3&#x02032; exonucleolytic degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>), we asked whether knockdown of LARP7 expression by siRNA would have a negative effect on 7SK snRNA steady-state levels in human cells. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>A shows that reducing the expression of LARP7 by about 70% <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>A) caused a decrease in the steady-state level of 7SK (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>B). LARP7 knockdown had no effect on U2 or U6 snRNA levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>B). This result indicates that LARP7 stabilizes the 7SK snRNA in human cells. <fig id="F4" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><p>Knockdown of LARP7 decreases 7SK levels, increases free P-TEFb, and enhances Tat transactivation.

Glycerol gradient analysis was carried out on control cells or cells treated with either LARP7 or MEPCE siRNA. siRNA treatment resulted in a 70% reduction of both LARP7 and MEPCE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>C and D). Knockdown of either protein resulted in a small, but significant increase in the amount of free P-TEFb; however, the effect of MEPCE knockdown was less dramatic (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>E). Because the release of P-TEFb is a highly regulated process, we speculated that the increase in free P-TEFb mediated by the loss of LARP7 and MEPCE and subsequent loss of 7SK would affect transcription. LARP7 and MEPCE siRNAs were introduced into human HEK 293 cells, followed by the transient transfection of an HIV-1 LTR-luciferase reporter construct in the presence of the HIV-1 transactivator, Tat. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>F, knockdown of LARP7 caused a consistent &#x0223c;2-fold increase in Tat-mediated transactivation of the HIV-1 LTR. Knockdown of MEPCE had little or no effect either alone or in combination with knockdown of LARP7. Essentially the same results were observed in TZM-bl cells, a stable HeLa-derived cell line containing an integrated luciferase reporter gene driven by the HIV-1 LTR (data not shown). The relatively weak enhancement of Tat-mediated transactivation was most likely due to the 25&#x02013;50% efficiency of LARP7 knockdown in treated cells (data not shown). Of note, these results compare well with those obtained in an earlier study of the effect HEXIM1 knockdown on transcription from the HIV-1 promoter, which also led to a &#x0223c;2-fold increase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>). Together, these data provide evidence that LARP7 plays an important role in stabilizing and maintaining the 7SK snRNP. Knockdown of LARP7 led to both a reduction in 7SK and to an increase in active P-TEFb.</p></sec><sec><title>Knockdown of 7SK disrupts the large form of P-TEFb</title><p>To determine if the level of 7SK could directly impact the amount of free P-TEFb, siRNA directed against 7SK was used to knock down the snRNA. Previously, 7SK siRNA, but not a non-specific siRNA, was shown to specifically reduce 7SK even though it is a nuclear RNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>). Total RNA was isolated 6, 12, 24, 48 or 72 h post-transfection from cells treated with siRNA or Lipofectamine 2000 alone. Northern blotting was performed to determine the extent of 7SK knockdown. Knockdown was rapid and persistent, with 7SK levels in siRNA-treated cells reduced to 21% of control cells at 6 h and 16% at 72 h (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>A). The effect of knockdown of 7SK on the forms of P-TEFb was then examined by glycerol gradient sedimentation analysis of cell lysates made 48 h after mock transfection or transfection with 7SK siRNA. In the control cells, the vast majority of P-TEFb was found in the large form, with a small amount in the free form (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>B, Control). The ratio of the free and large forms of P-TEFb was dramatically shifted by 7SK knockdown, with very little P-TEFb remaining in the large form (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>B, 7SK siRNA). We conclude that reduction in the amount of 7SK in cells leads to the release of P-TEFb from the large form and is similar to the effect seen after LARP7 knockdown (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>E) except that when 7SK siRNA is used the reduction in 7SK is much more rapid. However, at the 48 h time point analyzed the absolute signals for cyclin T1 and Cdk9 in 7SK siRNA-treated cells were reduced compared to control cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>B). <fig id="F5" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><p>Direct knockdown of 7SK disrupts the large form of P-TEFb and decreases total P-TEFb.

Northern blotting for 7SK confirmed that it was reduced to &#x0223c;20% of control cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>C). Knockdown of 7SK caused a reduction in both Cdk9 and cyclin T1 to 30% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>C), indicating that the absolute amount of P-TEFb is dependent on 7SK levels. Evidently, the prolonged release of active P-TEFb from the disintegrating large form triggers the reduction of P-TEFb. Additionally, reduction of free P-TEFb could be part of the explanation for why only low levels of released P-TEFb were detected 72 h after the LARP7 siRNA treatment of cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>E).</p><p>Finally, to determine if LARP7 knockdown had a similar effect as 7SK knockdown on total P-TEFb levels, HeLa cells were mock-transfected or transfected with 10, 30 or 100 pmoles of LARP7 siRNA for 48 h. LARP7 knockdown resulted in a significant decrease in both Cdk9 and cyclin T1 levels, paralleling the 7SK results, while HEXIM1 was unchanged (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>D). HEXIM1 levels likely remained the same due to the fact that HEXIM1 in the large form is a small fraction of the total HEXIM1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>A). Loss of the 7SK snRNP by either 7SK or LARP7 knockdown underscores the importance of 7SK stability in maintaining proper control over P-TEFb.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>We have examined the association of LARP7 with 7SK, P-TEFb, HEXIM1, MEPCE and hnRNP A1. Although the study began with a TAP-tagged LARP7 pulldown, all other experiments involved analysis of endogenous LARP7. Glycerol gradient sedimentation and immunoprecipitation experiments were used to compare the 7SK snRNP in control cells with the snRNP in cells treated with P-TEFb inhibitors or siRNAs. Our study demonstrated that LARP7 is a stable component of two major 7SK snRNPs that are present before and after the release of P-TEFb (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>). Treatment of cells with P-TEFb inhibitors caused the P-TEFb&#x02022;HEXIM1&#x02022;MEPCE&#x02022;LARP7&#x02022;7SK complex to be converted into an hnRNPA1&#x02022;LARP7&#x02022;7SK complex. Only a small (substoiciometric) amount of MEPCE was found to associate with 7SK and LARP7 after release of P-TEFb. Knockdown of LARP7 led to a reduction of 7SK, the release of P-TEFb from the large form and the activation of transcription from the HIV LTR. Additionally, reduction of 7SK by direct siRNA knockdown or by knockdown of LARP7 caused a time-dependent reduction in the total amount of P-TEFb. This suggests that there is a cellular mechanism that regulates the level of free P-TEFb when it is not inhibited by the 7SK snRNP. Based on bioinformatic analysis LARP7 is the most closely related family member to the founding protein, La. The similarities in the domain structure of La and LARP7 suggest that they may have similar properties. La has been found in association with many nascent RNAPIII transcripts including 7SK (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>). We propose that LARP7 replaces La during 7SK snRNP maturation. This would explain our finding that &#x0223c;90% of the 7SK snRNP was immunoprecipitated with LARP7 antibodies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>). This represents a difference between LARP7 and La in that La is not present in the final mature form of most snRNPs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44 B45 B46 B47">44&#x02013;47</xref>). The results presented here show that LARP7 protects 7SK from degradation similarly to La's role in protecting other RNPs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>). It is possible that this is accomplished through the binding of the La domain and RRM1 of LARP7 to both the 3&#x02032; and 5&#x02032; ends of 7SK (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>). In addition to its role in RNA protection, La has been implicated in nuclear localization and nucleolar trafficking of RNAs such as U6 and 7SL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>). Binding of LARP7 to 7SK may partially explain why 7SK is predominantly nuclear (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>). Interestingly, recent analysis of the crystal structure of La shows that the La domain contains hallmarks of a DNA binding protein and the surfaces that were assumed to be involved in RNA binding are actually free (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>). In conjunction with this finding, La has been shown to localize to RNAPIII promoters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>). It would be intriguing if LARP7 had a similar localization to DNA. If so then it could either be used to target inactive P-TEFb to positions on the chromatin for local release to enhance RNAPII transcription, or position 7SK on chromatin for local regulated inhibition of P-TEFb. <fig id="F6" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><p>Model of the 7SK snRNP before and after release of P-TEFb. Prior to treatment with P-TEFb inhibitors or cellular stress, the 7SK snRNP contains P-TEFb, a HEXIM dimer, MEPCE, LARP7 and 7SK. Following release, the 7SK snRNP is composed of, LARP7, 7SK and hnRNP proteins.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="gkn061f6"/></fig></p><p>Binding of La to its RNA targets is a regulated process that is dependent on the 5&#x02032; and 3&#x02032; ends of the RNA and the phosphorylation state of La. A 5&#x02032;-monomethyl-guanosine capping of U6 and B2 RNA has been shown to reduce the affinity of La for these RNAs while adenylation of these transcripts completely releases La (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>). The recent discovery of MEPCE, which monomethylates U6 and 7SK on their 5&#x02032; termini may provide a mechanism for 7SK release from La and the subsequent association of LARP7. However, the status of the 5&#x02032; end of 7SK bound by LARP7, as well as, the methylation preference of LARP7 has yet to be determined. Alternatively, it is possible that 5&#x02032; end capping of 7SK might affect the way that LARP7 and 7SK interact and that could impact the association or dissociation of P-TEFb and HEXIM1. It is also possible that modification of the 3&#x02032; end of 7SK could be used for regulation of the protein composition of the 7SK snRNP.</p><p>Approximately 70% of 7SK is post-transcriptionally adenylated on the 3&#x02032; end (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>) and this modification has been shown to affect La binding to other RNAPIII snRNAs. This modification may provide a mechanism for release of 7SK from La or release of P-TEFb from the LARP7&#x02022;7SK snRNP. Release of P-TEFb from the LARP7&#x02022;7SK snRNP could be accomplished by altering the association of LARP7 with 7SK in such a way that the secondary structure of the RNA is affected and prevents HEXIM and P-TEFb binding. It is possible that the 25% of 7SK that is associated with P-TEFb (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>A, Northern and 3B, 7SK) might be the fraction of 7SK, &#x0223c;30%, that is not adenylated. Phosphorylation of Ser366 of La has been shown to reduce 5&#x02032; end binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">53</xref>) providing another feasible regulatory mechanism.</p><p>Results from the 7SK and LARP7 knockdown experiments performed here provide evidence for the coordination of two cellular mechanisms regulating the level of free P-TEFb. When the level of free P-TEFb was increased by disruption of the large form during siRNA-mediated knockdown of LARP7, an increase in P-TEFb activity was observed. After several days of LARP7 or 7SK siRNA treatment less total P-TEFb was found. This is consistent with an initial increase in P-TEFb activity as the large form is disrupted followed by a slower cellular compensation that leads to reduction in the total amount of P-TEFb protein by increasing turnover or decreasing synthesis of Cdk9 and cyclin T1. The mechanism for the reduction of excess free P-TEFb is likely to be proteosome mediated decay because when P-TEFb subunits were overexpressed most of the P-TEFb was quickly ubiquitylated and degraded by the proteasome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">54</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B55">55</xref>). Degradation of the free P-TEFb would explain why we found only a slight increase in free P-TEFb after LARP7 knockdown. The idea that the amount of free P-TEFb arises from a balance between release from the large form and degradation of the free form is supported by the finding that knockdown of either Cdk9 or cyclin T1 results in a reduction of the total amount of P-TEFb in the cell without grossly affecting transcription of a reporter gene or cell viability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B56">56</xref>). In the future, it is important to determine how these mechanisms are used to obtain the selective P-TEFb function required for control of transcription during differentiation and development.</p><p>Mechanisms regulating the balance of free versus inactive P-TEFb have been previously characterized. Knockdown of HEXIM1 was shown to have no effect on the absolute levels of P-TEFb or the amount of P-TEFb in the large form because HEXIM1 was functionally replaced by HEXIM2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>). Two studies have shown that long-term treatment of cells with HMBA, caused an initial increase in free active P-TEFb, but ultimately resulted in a shift in the equilibrium back to the large inactive form (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B57">57</xref>). Together these studies provide support for a variety of cellular mechanisms that maintain the P-TEFb equilibrium in cells.</p><p>Comparative genomic analysis shows that LARP7 is closely related to the <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> protein multi sex combs (mxc). The domain structure of mxc is very similar to that of LARP7 and contains a La motif and two RRMs. In flies, mxc is a member of the Polycomb group (PcG) of genes which regulate gene expression during differentiation and development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B58">58</xref>). Mxc appears to function as a tumor suppressor because mutations were shown to result in uncontrolled malignant growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B59">59</xref>). Additionally, there is evidence that LARP7, studied under the alias DKFZP564K112, is a marker of gastric cancer as determined by microsatellite instabilotyping (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B60">60</xref>). Genetic studies in flies show that complete loss of mxc results in cell death after a few divisions while hypomorphic expression results in abnormalities during development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B61">61</xref>). Mxc is also implicated in <italic>Drosophila</italic> hematopoiesis by controlling plasmatocyte proliferation and differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B62">62</xref>). It would be interesting to see if the phenotypes observed in flies are related to an interaction between fly P-TEFb and its LARP7 homolog mxc. With these results in mind, it is important that we determine how LARP7 regulates P-TEFb function during cell differentiation, development and cancer progression.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS</title><p>We are grateful to Guy Poirier and Denis Faubert for mass spectrometry analysis, Mathieu Blanchette and Christian Poitras for help with bioinformatics and Benoit Chabot for assistance with siRNA design.
