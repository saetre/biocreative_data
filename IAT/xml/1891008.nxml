Here, we report the characterization of a locus where a small RNA (SymR) is encoded <italic>in cis</italic> to an SOS-induced gene whose product shows homology to the antitoxin MazE (SymE). Synthesis of the SymE protein is tightly repressed at multiple levels by the LexA repressor, the SymR RNA and the Lon protease. SymE co-purifies with ribosomes and overproduction of the protein leads to cell growth inhibition, decreased protein synthesis and increased RNA degradation. These properties are shared with several RNA endonuclease toxins of the toxin-antitoxin modules, and we show that the SymE protein represents evolution of a toxin from the AbrB fold, whose representatives are typically antitoxins. We suggest that SymE promotion of RNA cleavage may be important for the recycling of RNAs damaged under SOS-inducing conditions.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Introduction</title><p>In <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>, a combination of approaches based on sequence conservation, structural features and direct detection has led to the identification of approximately 80 small RNAs (sRNAs) that do not encode tRNAs, rRNAs or proteins but rather are thought to be regulators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b44">Storz and Gottesman, 2006</xref>). While the functions of only a subset of these regulatory RNAs is known, most of the characterized sRNAs act to modulate mRNA stability and/or translation by base-pairing with mRNAs that are encoded at a different chromosomal position. In general, the region of complementarity between these <italic>trans</italic>-encoded sRNA and the mRNA target is limited, and all of these sRNAs have been found to bind to and require the RNA chaperone Hfq for function.</p><p>In contrast to the sRNAs encoded on the bacterial chromosome, most of the characterized plasmid sRNAs are encoded opposite the genes that they regulate and thus have perfect complementarity with their target mRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b49">Wagner <italic>et al</italic>., 2002</xref>). Many of these <italic>cis</italic>-encoded sRNAs modulate the synthesis of replication proteins and thus control the copy number of the plasmids. They act by blocking ribosome binding or by promoting the formation of an mRNA secondary structure that leads to transcription termination. Other <italic>cis</italic>-encoded plasmid sRNAs repress the synthesis of proteins that would otherwise be toxic to the cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">Gerdes <italic>et al</italic>., 1997</xref>). Because the protein toxin kills cells in which the plasmid is lost, these sense-antisense pairs have been termed addiction modules or post-segregational killing systems. Perhaps the best-characterized antitoxin sRNA is the Sok antisense RNA of plasmid R1 which represses translation of the <italic>hok</italic> mRNA. The Sok RNA is very unstable and is quickly degraded when the R1 plasmid is lost from the cell. Under these conditions, the more stable <italic>hok</italic> mRNA is translated, and the Hok protein kills the cells that no longer carry the plasmid.</p><p>In addition to the Hok-Sok systems for plasmid addiction, a number of plasmids also encode toxin-antitoxin modules where the antitoxin is a protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">Engelberg-Kulka and Glaser, 1999</xref>). There are multiple classes of these protein toxin-antitoxin modules which are encoded not only on plasmids but on bacterial chromosomes as well (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">Anantharaman and Aravind, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">Pandey and Gerdes, 2005</xref>). The majority of these systems share a common gene organization &#x02013; usually operons of two closely linked genes where one gene encodes an antitoxin and the other a toxin. The antitoxins are typically transcription factors that repress the toxin-antitoxin operon and also bind to and block the activity of the toxins. The toxins encoded by these modules are a very diverse group of proteins that appear to kill cells by disrupting any of several different aspects of cell physiology. In the course of bacterial evolution, operons constituting these systems have undergone a wide range of &#x02018;mixing and matching&#x02019; of toxin and antitoxin genes, while retaining the same organizational syntax (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">Anantharaman and Aravind, 2003</xref>).</p><p>Free-living organisms in particular encode an abundance of these protein toxin-antitoxin modules, but their physiological roles have been controversial. It has alternatively been proposed that toxins promote cell killing, cell stasis, long-term cell persistence or reuse of resources; although some of these roles may not be mutually exclusive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">Buts <italic>et al</italic>., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">Gerdes <italic>et al</italic>., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">Condon, 2006</xref>). While the physiological roles of the toxin proteins remain under debate, the biochemical functions of some of the toxins are more clearly understood. Many toxins belong to the RelE, MazF/Kid, Doc and PIN domain superfamilies of predicted RNA endonucleases, and subsets of these toxins have been shown to promote mRNA cleavage either on their own or in association with ribosomes. As for the Hok-Sok example, the protein antitoxin generally is significantly less stable than the toxin such that toxin activity increases under conditions of stress when the antitoxin is degraded.</p><p>In our cloning-based screen for <italic>E. coli</italic> sRNAs, we identified a 77 nucleotide RNA, denoted RyjC based on its genomic position, which is encoded opposite the 5&#x02032; end of the <italic>yjiW</italic> mRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">Kawano <italic>et al</italic>., 2005</xref>). The RyjC promoter is embedded in the <italic>yjiW</italic> coding sequence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Fig. 1A</xref>) and the sRNA and much of its sequence are conserved in <italic>Salmonella</italic>. Here we examine the function of the <italic>yjiW</italic>-RyjC sense-antisense pair which we have renamed SymE (SOS-induced <italic>y</italic><italic>jiW</italic> gene with similarity to <italic>M</italic>az<italic>E</italic>) and SymR (symbiotic RNA). We present evidence that SymR serves an antitoxin function by repressing SymE synthesis and that the SymE protein has properties of the endonuclease toxins. We propose that SymE represents an instance of toxin evolution from a superfamily hitherto only known to contain antitoxin transcription factors. We also suggest that the SymE-SymR pair might represent the deployment of a chromosomal toxin-antitoxin module for the recycling of RNA damaged concomitantly with DNA.</p><fig id="fig01" position="float"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>SymR RNA represses SymE translation.

Given that the two genes overlap and the promoter of SymR is embedded within the <italic>symE</italic> open reading frame, we had to eliminate SymR expression by mutating the <italic>symR</italic> promoter. This was achieved by introducing two point mutations onto the <italic>E. coli</italic> chromosome that disrupted the &#x02212;10 sequence of the <italic>symR</italic> promoter but did not alter the SymE amino acid sequence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Fig. 1A</xref>). This &#x02212;10 mutation effectively abolished expression of the SymR RNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Fig. 1B</xref>). Previous studies had shown that the <italic>symE</italic> (<italic>yjiW</italic>) promoter has a LexA binding site and is strongly induced by DNA damaging agents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">Fern&#x000e1;ndez De Henestrosa <italic>et al</italic>., 2000</xref>). We therefore compared <italic>symE</italic> mRNA levels in wild-type MG1655 cells and the corresponding strain carrying the &#x02212;10 promoter mutation at different times before and after cells were treated with the DNA damaging agent mitomycin C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Fig. 1B</xref>). For wild-type cells virtually no <italic>symE</italic> mRNA expression was observed in the absence of mitomycin C treatment. Low levels of the mRNA were detected 30 min after SOS induction with a peak between 60 and 90 min. Overall slightly higher <italic>symE</italic> mRNA levels were detected for the &#x02212;10 mutant strain; more <italic>symE</italic> mRNA could be detected in the absence of DNA damage, and higher induction was observed at 30, 60, 90 and 150 min. Generally, the elimination of SymR expression resulted in approximately threefold higher <italic>symE</italic> mRNA levels.</p><p>We also examined the effects of SymR RNA on SymE protein levels by integrating a sequential peptide affinity (SPA) tag adjacent to the SymE stop codon on the chromosomes of the wild type and &#x02212;10 mutant strains. When <italic>symE-SPA</italic> mRNA levels after mitomycin C treatment were compared in the wild type and &#x02212;10 mutant backgrounds, we again observed an approximately threefold increase in <italic>symE-SPA</italic> mRNA levels in the &#x02212;10 mutant compared with the wild-type strain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Fig. 1C</xref>). A greater than sevenfold difference in SymE-SPA protein levels was observed between the wild-type and &#x02212;10 mutant strains. For the wild-type strain, no protein was detected in the absence of mitomycin C treatment and only low levels were detected after the treatment. As for the <italic>symE-SPA</italic> mRNA, the peak of SymE-SPA protein was at 90 min. For the &#x02212;10 mutant, SymE-SPA was clearly present in uninduced cells and the levels were strongly increased upon mitomycin C treatment. In contrast, no difference in <italic>recA</italic> mRNA and protein levels was observed with the same wild type and &#x02212;10 promoter extracts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Fig. 1C</xref>). Together these results indicate that while the presence of the SymR RNA has some effect on <italic>symE</italic> mRNA levels, there is a greater effect on protein levels. The presence of the antisense RNA however, does not impact the timing of SymE expression after SOS induction.</p></sec><sec><title>SymR RNA levels are 10-fold higher than <italic>symE</italic> mRNA levels</title><p>The relative levels of the <italic>symE</italic> mRNA and SymR RNA were determined by quantitative Northern analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02">Fig. 2A</xref>). The total RNA samples isolated for the 0 and 90 min time points in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Fig. 1B and C</xref> were separated alongside known amounts of <italic>in vitro</italic> synthesized SymR and <italic>symE</italic> RNAs. Using this approach, the amount of <italic>symE</italic> mRNA in wild-type strain was determined to be 0.01 fmol &#x003bc;g<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> of total RNA at time 0 and 0.02 fmol &#x003bc;g<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> at 90 min, while the amount of SymR in wild-type strain was determined to be 0.2 fmol &#x003bc;g<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> of total RNA at both time points. Thus, the ratio of <italic>symE</italic> mRNA and SymR is nearly 1:10 suggesting that most of the SymR RNA in the cell is not base-paired with the <italic>symE</italic> mRNA. We also found the SymR RNA to be very stable; almost no decrease in SymR levels was observed even 60 min after inhibiting transcription with rifampicin treatment (data not shown).</p><fig id="fig02" position="float"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><p>Effects of different SymR RNA levels.

The cultures were split and half of each culture was treated with 0.02% arabinose for 30 min (0 min). All cultures were then treated with 1 &#x003bc;g ml<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> mitomycin C for 90 min (90 min). Cell extracts prepared at the 0 and 90 min time points were analysed by immunoblot assays using monoclonal anti-FLAG M2-AP antibodies.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="mmi0064-0738-f2"/></fig></sec><sec><title>SymR expressed <italic>in trans</italic> represses SymE synthesis and anti-SymR expressed <italic>in trans</italic> activates SymE synthesis</title><p>To test whether SymR expressed <italic>in trans</italic> could also repress SymE-SPA synthesis, we moved a pACYC184 plasmid expressing <italic>symR</italic> from its own promoter into the &#x02212;10 promoter mutant strain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02">Fig. 2B</xref>). In cells treated with mitomycin C, SymE-SPA was detected in the control strain carrying the vector control, similar to the wild-type strain. However, for cells harbouring pACYC-SymR, no SymE-SPA protein was detected at any time points. Thus, SymR expressed from a plasmid can also repress SymE-SPA synthesis. In the pACYC-SymR containing strains, the SymR RNA was present at 8&#x02013;12 fmol &#x003bc;g<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>, more than 40-fold higher than the levels expressed from the chromosome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02">Fig. 2A</xref>). At these high levels of SymR RNA no <italic>symE-SPA</italic> mRNA was detected even 90 min after mitomycin C treatment. This decrease must be resulting from effects on <italic>symE</italic> mRNA stability because assays of a <italic>symE&#x02013;lacZ</italic> fusion showed that pACYC-SymR did not impact transcription from the <italic>symE</italic> promoter (data not shown).</p><p>We also constructed a plasmid expressing an RNA that is complementary to SymR and thus was predicted to interfere with SymR base-pairing with the <italic>symE</italic> mRNA. In this construct the anti-SymR RNA is under the control of the P<sub>BAD</sub> promoter of pAZ3. When the anti-SymR RNA was induced by arabinose for 30 min in the wild-type background, SymE-SPA synthesis was observed even in the absence of DNA damage and was further increased by mitomycin C treatment for 90 min (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02">Fig. 2C</xref>). These SymE-SPA levels were comparable to the levels observed in the &#x02212;10 mutant in the absence of arabinose induction. SymE-SPA levels were not further elevated in the &#x02212;10 mutant when anti-SymR expression was induced by arabinose. Our interpretation of these results is that anti-SymR is exerting its effects by preventing SymR base-pairing with the <italic>symE</italic> mRNA, and this regulation is abolished when SymR is not expressed in the &#x02212;10 mutant.</p></sec><sec><title>SymE protein levels are controlled by the Lon protease</title><p>For many well-characterized plasmid sRNAs that base-pair with <italic>cis</italic>-encoded mRNAs, the antisense RNA-target RNA duplexes are degraded by RNase III, an endoribonuclease specific for double-stranded RNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">Blomberg <italic>et al</italic>., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">Gerdes <italic>et al</italic>., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">Malmgren <italic>et al</italic>., 1997</xref>). In addition, all characterized <italic>E. coli</italic> sRNAs that base-pair with <italic>trans</italic>-encoded mRNA targets have been found to require the function of the Hfq RNA chaperone protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b44">Storz and Gottesman, 2006</xref>). To determine whether SymR regulation of SymE synthesis required either of these proteins, we moved the corresponding mutant alleles into the SymE-SPA strain and examined SymE-SPA synthesis at different time points after mitomycin C treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig03">Fig. 3A</xref>). In the <italic>rnc</italic> mutant, the pattern of SymE-SPA synthesis was virtually identical to the wild-type strain. For the <italic>hfq</italic> mutant strain, we also did not detect SymE-SPA protein at 0 min. The peak of SymE-SPA synthesis was later than for the wild-type strain, but we attribute this delay to the slower growth of this mutant strain. In general, neither RNase III nor Hfq appears to be required for SymR RNA repression of SymE synthesis.</p><fig id="fig03" position="float"><label>Fig. 3</label><caption><p>SymE protein is degraded by the Lon protease.

In contrast, SymE exhibited properties that were hitherto only exhibited by toxins. A careful examination of the sequence conservation patterns and their distribution on the three-dimensional structure suggested that beyond the residues those stabilize the structural core the AbrB fold, the SymE family had acquired a novel constellation of residues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig06">Fig. 6</xref>). These were predicted to map to regions involved in potential nucleic acid interactions and included some polar residues that might have a role in potential cleavage of RNAs. It was conceivable that SymE might antagonize the functions of other AbrB family members thereby releasing another toxin, but we observed the same decreases in colony-forming ability upon SymE overproduction in a wild-type strain and a strain lacking the five previously described toxin-antitoxin modules (data not shown). Thus, we suggest that the SymE proteins have undergone a functional shift from a transcription factor or antitoxin to an RNA-associating protein with toxin-like properties.</p></sec><sec><title>Gene neighbourhood analysis of the SymE systems supports a toxin-like function</title><p>To further investigate if SymE family proteins might have indeed acquired toxin-like function, we performed a detailed analysis of the gene neighbourhoods of SymE family members (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig07">Fig. 7A</xref>). The results of this analysis showed that SymE-family genes are often found in predicted operons together with genes encoding a transcription factor. The most commonly occurring transcription factor is a Cro/cI helix&#x02013;turn&#x02013;helix type protein (cHTH), which is found as the repressor and antitoxin in various toxin-antitoxin modules containing toxins of the PIN, RelE and Doc superfamilies. More infrequently, SymE family genes are found in operons encoding transcription factors of the YefM or MetJ/Arc ribbon&#x02013;helix&#x02013;helix type (RHH) superfamilies, which are also represented in toxin-antitoxin operons. Thus, where SymE genes are embedded in predicted operons with protein coding genes, they are always accompanied by another gene that encodes a transcription factor that typically functions as an antitoxin in the characterized toxin-antitoxin modules. This observation is consistent with the inference that, despite having an AbrB fold like the MazE antitoxins, the SymE family has undergone a functional shift to a toxin-like role. In these cases, SymE family genes most likely are regulated by means of transcriptional control.</p><fig id="fig07" position="float"><label>Fig. 7</label><caption><p>Physiological role of SymE. A.

In several of these cases there was noticeable nucleotide conservation upstream of the predicted start methionine, suggesting that members of this group are potentially all regulated by non-codings sRNAs as in the case of SymE. Thus, it appears likely that the SymE systems, like other toxin-antitoxin modules, had evolved through <italic>in situ</italic> operonic displacement of the transcription factor genes by genes for other such regulators or regulatory sRNAs that introduced a regulatory stricture an entirely different level.</p></sec><sec><title>SymE role in the SOS response</title><p>Various physiological roles have been proposed for the antitoxin-toxin modules including altruistic killing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">Aizenman <italic>et al</italic>., 1996</xref>), reversible stasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">Pedersen <italic>et al</italic>., 2002</xref>) and long-term persistence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">Lewis, 2005</xref>) as well as quality control and the reuse of resources (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">Gerdes <italic>et al</italic>., 2005</xref>).

We did not detect any differences between the &#x00394;<italic>symER</italic> deletion and parent wild type or <italic>lon</italic> mutant cells in any of these assays suggesting that endogenous levels of SymE expressed after SOS induction do not play a role in altruistic killing, bacterial stasis or long-term persistence. We thus propose that a more likely role of SymE in the SOS response is the reuse of resources, in particular damaged RNAs.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>Small, non-coding RNAs have been found to have a wide variety of regulatory functions in both bacteria and eukaryotes. We sought to define the role of SymR, a <italic>cis</italic>-encoded sRNA in <italic>E. coli</italic> and found that the antisense RNA tightly controls the synthesis of SymE, a SOS-induced protein that is also subject to degradation by the Lon protease. Surprisingly, despite homology to the AbrB superfamily of proteins which previously have been characterized as antitoxins, SymE has properties of the toxin-family of proteins. Similar to other toxins, SymE co-purifies with ribosomes, and overexpression of SymE leads to reduced colony formation, decreased protein synthesis as well as significant decreases in the levels of several RNAs tested. Sequence conservation and gene neighbourhood across bacterial species support the conclusion that this AbrB-family member has evolved to have a toxin-like function. These results have led us to suggest that SymE acts as an endoribonuclease, either on its own or in association with the ribosomes. Given its induction in response to DNA damage, we also propose that SymE might play a role in recycling RNAs damaged by the agents that induce the SOS response.</p><sec><title>Tight regulation of SymE synthesis</title><p>SymE synthesis is repressed at all levels; by the LexA repressor at the level of transcription, by the SymR RNA at the level of mRNA stability and translation, and by the Lon protease at the level of protein stability. Given the toxicity associated with SymE overexpression, we suggest that this tight, additive repression ensures endogenous SymE levels never rise to detrimental concentrations. Whether still other regulators modulate SymE synthesis remains to be seen.</p><p>We found several aspects of the SymR RNA regulation of SymE mRNA stability and translation to be surprising. First, at endogenous levels, the antisense RNA had a stronger impact on <italic>symE</italic> mRNA translation than on degradation. Because the SymR RNA is completely complementary to the 5&#x02032; end of the <italic>symE</italic> mRNA, there is extensive possibility for base-pairing and we expected this RNA-RNA duplex to be a good target for cleavage by RNase III. However, the absence of SymR only led to an approximately threefold increase in <italic>symE</italic> mRNA levels, and SymE synthesis was not affected in the <italic>rnc</italic> mutant strain. A second surprise was the high 10:1 SymR to <italic>symE</italic> ratio even after <italic>symE</italic> mRNA induction after DNA damage. All <italic>symE</italic> mRNA in the cell could be complexed with the SymR RNA. However, given that we do observe SymE protein synthesis, a subpopulation of the mRNA must not be involved in pairing or the pairing is sufficiently transient to allow occasional ribosome binding. This observation also raises the possibility that the SymR RNA has additional functions. Finally, the SymR RNA was unexpectedly stable. The levels or activities of most regulators are modulated. It could be that the SymR RNA is acting as a titrator rather than a switch. Alternatively there might be additional cellular factors that affect SymR RNA base-pairing with <italic>symE</italic>, and thus control the amount of SymR RNA that is active for regulation. The stability of SymR can probably be explained by the predicted structure of the RNA, which consists of two strong hairpins.</p><p>An intriguing difference between the SymE-SymR system and all previously characterized toxin-antitoxin modules is that in all other cases the antitoxin is rapidly degraded (for example the RelB antitoxin is a target of the Lon protease and the Sok antisense RNA is extremely unstable). In contrast, SymR antitoxin RNA is quite stable and in this case the toxin is target of Lon.</p></sec><sec><title>Evolution of an AbrB-fold protein into a toxin</title><p>Different independent lines of evidence, sequence divergence, operon organization and experimental results imply that the SymE protein, while originating within the AbrB fold, has evolved into a protein with toxin-like properties. AbrB-type antitoxins are widely distributed throughout the bacterial superkingdom, but the distinctive SymE family is nearly exclusively found only in proteobacteria. This suggests that evolution of the endonuclease is a recent innovation within the AbrB superfamily. While it was previously known that different toxins or antitoxin might be replaced by functionally equivalent, but evolutionarily unrelated equivalents, this appears to be the first case where we observe a possible emergence of a protein with toxin-like properties within a superfamily that contains antitoxins. The barrel-like structure of the dimers and the DNA-binding properties of the AbrB fold may have favoured evolution of an RNA cleaving activity. The presence of predicted operons with two tandem genes of distinct SymE proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig07">Fig. 7A</xref>) raises the possibility that such duplications might have allowed the original diversification of the fold.</p><p>We note that an astonishing range of structurally unrelated protein folds have been recruited for cleavage or degradation of RNAs in toxin-antitoxin modules. These include members of ancient RNase folds such as the PIN domain, which contains the same catalytic fold as the 5&#x02032;-to 3&#x02032; exonucleases, and predicted toxins, like HicA, which contains an RNase H fold (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b45">Takagi <italic>et al</italic>., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">Anantharaman and Aravind, 2006</xref>). The RelE nuclease domain was originally reported to contain a unique &#x003b1;-&#x003b2; fold with no resemblance to other previously characterized nucleases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b45">Takagi <italic>et al</italic>., 2005</xref>). However, careful structural comparisons show that it shares a common fold, including a core &#x003b1;(2)-&#x003b2;(4) topology, with the tRNA-specific RNase domain of the colicin D family. The MazF/KiD superfamily of toxins has been derived from the ancient SH3-like &#x003b2;-barrel fold, which includes several ancient non-catalytic RNA-binding domains like the ribosomal proteins L24/L21e and the SM domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">Anantharaman and Aravind, 2003</xref>). Doc toxins, in contrast appear to have a distinctive all-&#x003b1; helical metal-binding fold (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">Anantharaman and Aravind, 2003</xref>). In this context, the SymE family may represent convergent innovation of catalytic activity from a protein fold, whose previously characterized members were DNA-binding proteins. All together it appears that there has been a selection for similar RNA-cleaving/destabilizing functions on at least six independent occasions in evolution.</p><p>The phyletic patterns and genomic distributions of the SymE systems are strongly suggestive of movement between species as well as intragenomic proliferation and mobility. The presence of identical copies of the SymE systems in different genomes is especially indicative of recent duplications and transpositions of these operons. For example, the <italic>Erwinia</italic> genome has at least 14 copies (including two pairs of identical copies). The isolated presence of a SymE-like system in the Gram-positive bacterium <italic>Enterococcus faecalis</italic> suggests that the operons might also be laterally transferred between phylogenetically distant bacteria. Another notable feature is their genomic association with diverse mobile elements, such as restriction-modification systems, transposons and pathogenicity islands (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig07">Fig. 7A</xref> for examples) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">Kobayashi <italic>et al</italic>., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b43">Schmidt and Hensel, 2004</xref>). Widespread lateral mobility across bacterial genomes and association with other mobile elements are observed in other toxin-antitoxin modules. For example, a <italic>relBE</italic>-type system is associated with the restriction-modification system HsdS in the Gram positive bacterium <italic>Streptococcus mutans</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">Lemos <italic>et al</italic>., 2005</xref>). These observations suggest that SymE and other toxin-antitoxin modules are selfish elements that probably maintain themselves through toxin-dependent cell killing, and to tend proliferate within genomes and colocate to genomic hot spots harbouring other mobile elements. However, it is known that other mobile elements, like the restriction-modification systems and some transposons, on occasion, confer selective advantages to their hosts in the form of defences against DNA viruses or as DNA repair proteins and transcriptional regulators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">Kobayashi <italic>et al</italic>., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">Aravind <italic>et al</italic>., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">2005</xref>). Thus, it is possible that some toxin-antitoxin modules were recruited to control the cleavage and degradation of transcripts under specific conditions.</p></sec><sec><title>Protection against RNA damage</title><p>Until now, RNA lesions have largely been ignored, primarily because damage to DNA was understood to have consequences for subsequent generations, while effects of RNA damage were transient and likely to only affect a limited number of RNA molecules. However, the universal importance of the tmRNA in bacteria and the presence of various mRNA decay mechanisms in eukaryotes, such as &#x02018;no-go decay&#x02019; (NGD) for the degradation of mRNAs associated with stalled ribosome-mRNA complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">Doma and Parker, 2006</xref>), indicate that damaged RNAs can also have serious consequences for the cell, in part by inhibiting ribosome function. Thus, it is perhaps not surprising that the SOS response to DNA damage would also lead to the induction of activities that could degrade damaged RNA.</p><p>Given the wide distribution of the toxin-antitoxin modules, including the SymE-like toxins, it is intriguing to ask whether other toxin-antitoxin modules are induced by and play roles in the DNA damage responses of other organisms. A transcript encoding the <italic>E. coli hokE</italic> gene, which shows homology to the plasmid-encoded <italic>hok</italic> genes, is induced during the SOS response, but it is not clear whether a functional toxin is made from this transcript (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">Fern&#x000e1;ndez De Henestrosa <italic>et al</italic>., 2000</xref>). The synthesis of the SOS-induced TisB toxin also is regulated by an sRNA, in this case the adjacently encoded IstR RNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b48">Vogel <italic>et al</italic>., 2004</xref>). The function of this 29-amino acid toxin is not yet known. In addition, a LexA binding site was predicted to be downstream of the promoter of the <italic>dinJ-yafQ</italic> toxin-antitoxin operon in <italic>E. coli</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">Lewis <italic>et al</italic>., 1994</xref>), although there is no evidence for SOS induction of this operon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">Fern&#x000e1;ndez De Henestrosa <italic>et al</italic>., 2000</xref>). Because many other chromosomally encoded toxin-antitoxin genes are induced by stress conditions such as starvation that could lead to RNA damage and stalled ribosomes, we favour the model that RNA recycling is a general function of the ubiquitous toxin-antitoxin modules. Possibly many of the toxin-antitoxin-like systems of bacteria correspond to RNA degradation systems that are functionally analogous to the extensive RNA-based post-transcriptional regulatory mechanisms of eukaryotes.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Experimental procedures</title><sec><title>Media and growth conditions</title><p>Cells were grown aerobically at 37&#x000b0;C in either Luria&#x02013;Bertani (LB) medium or M9 minimal medium supplemented with 0.4% glycerol, 0.05% casamino acids, 1 mM MgSO<sub>4</sub>, 0.1 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub> and 1 &#x003bc;g ml<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> thiamine.
