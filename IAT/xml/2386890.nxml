INTRODUCTION</title><p>Islet amyloid polypeptide (IAPP), also referred to as amylin, is a 37 amino acid protein produced in the pancreatic islet beta cells. Human IAPP (hIAPP) is implicated in the pathophysiology of type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM2) since it forms proteinaceous tissue deposits in the pancreatic islets (&#x0201c;islet amyloid&#x0201d;) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Islet amyloid has been demonstrated in more than 80% of patients with DM2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. Islet amyloid formation is implicated in development of beta cell failure which, in addition to insulin resistance, is a characteristic of DM2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Overproduction of IAPP in insulin resistance may occur due to common transcription regulatory elements in the promoter regions of the IAPP and insulin genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>], and this might underly the enhanced amyloid formation in DM2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. This in turn may induce impairment of beta cell function since aggregation of hIAPP has been demonstrated to be cytotoxic [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. However, involvement of islet amyloid in development of DM2 is still not firmly established. Recent data, both for hIAPP and for other amyloidogenic proteins (notably the Alzheimer's disease-related Abeta peptide), indicate that the degree of amyloid formation does not correspond with the severity of disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. In addition, prefibrillar aggregates of amyloidogenic proteins seem to be more cytotoxic than mature amyloid fibrils [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. To explore the potential diabetogenic effects of hIAPP and islet amyloid, we have generated transgenic mice overproducing biologically active hIAPP in the islet beta cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>] (mouse IAPP does not form islet amyloid). We previously showed that hIAPP overexpression in itself does not induce hyperglycemia, hyperinsulinemia, or obesity in these mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. However, when the hIAPP transgenic mice were crossbred with leptin-deficient and insulin-resistant ob/ob mice, extensive islet amyloid formation with worsening of the diabetes was observed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. In the present paper, we describe two experimental studies. In an in vivo experiment, we examined the influence of transgenic hIAPP expression on glucose tolerance of mice on a high-fat diet for a long period of time. Previous studies had shown that long-term, high-fat diet induces hyperglycemia, hyperinsulinemia, and obesity in mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. Furthermore, high-fat diet may be involved in islet amyloid formation in hIAPP transgenic mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. We, thus, administered a high-fat diet for 14 months to hIAPP transgenic and nontransgenic (control) mice and report here the islet amyloid formation, glucose tolerance, and islet GLUT-2 mRNA expression. In addition, we describe the development of an ex vivo model system for islet amyloidosis, using pancreatic islets isolated from the hIAPP transgenic mice. When such islets were cultured in high-glucose medium, amyloid formation occurs more rapidly as compared to the in vivo situation. Thus, this ex vivo model system will enable to study the process and effects of islet amyloid formation more specifically and conveniently.</p></sec><sec sec-type="section" id="sec2"><title>2. MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec sec-type="subsection" id="subsec2.1"><title>2.1. Animals</title><p>The generation of C57Bl/6J hIAPP transgenic mice with a rat insulin-2 gene promoter fragment (position &#x02212;695 to +8 relative to the transcription start site) linked to the hIAPP gene has previously been described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. The hIAPP transgenic mice were maintained by breeding heterozygous transgenic mice with mates of the C57BL/6J strain. Transgenic mice were differentiated from nontransgenic (NT) littermates by dot blot Southern hybridization, using a 588 bp hIAPP-specific DNA probe [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. Mice were housed on hardwood bedding in polypropylene cages and maintained in air-conditioned rooms at 20&#x02013;22&#x000b0;C with a photoperiod of 12 hours light, 12 hours dark. Water was available continuously and the mice received ad libitum a regular diet until 2.5 months of age. This diet contained 4,500 kcal/kg and included 22.5% protein and 4.8% fat (Hope Farms, Woerden, The Netherlands). At 2.5 months of age, the diet was switched to a high-fat diet for 14 months containing 5,600 kcal/kg, 20.8% protein, and 36.0% fat (30.0% cocoa oil, 6.0% corn oil; Hope Farms).</p></sec><sec sec-type="subsection" id="subsec2.2"><title>2.2. Glucose tolerance test</title><p>At 14 months after the start of the high-fat diet, nonfasted mice were anaesthetized with an i.p. injection of midazolam (0.4 mg/mouse) (Dormicum, Hoffman-La-Roche, Basel, Switzerland), and a combination of fluanison (0.9 mg/mouse), and fentanyl (0.02 mg/mouse) (Hypnorm, Janssen, Beerse, Belgium). D-glucose (British Drug Houses, Poole, UK) was injected i.p. (1 g/kg) and blood was sampled from the retrobulbar, intraorbital, capillary plexus before glucose administration and after 10, 30, 60, and 120 minutes. The samples were taken in heparinized tubes and stored on ice. Following centrifugation, plasma was separated and stored at &#x02212;20&#x000b0;C until analysis. After the 120-minute blood sample, tissue was sampled (see below), and trunk blood was obtained for measurement of IAPP levels. The blood was collected in EDTA-tubes and kept on ice until centrifugation at 1500 g for 5 minutes at 4&#x000b0;C. Plasma was stored at &#x02212;80&#x000b0;C.</p><p>All animal experiments were approved by the Animal Welfare Committee of Utrecht University/University Medical Center Utrecht, The Netherlands.</p></sec><sec sec-type="subsection" id="subsec2.3"><title>2.3.

Free and bound radioactivity was separated by use of double antibody immunoprecipitation. The sensitivity of the assay is 3.5 pmol/l and the coefficiency of variation &#x0003c;10% at both low and high levels. Insulin levels were measured in 20 ul plasma by RIA using guinea pig anti-rat insulin antibody, <sup>125</sup>I-labelled human insulin as tracer and rat insulin as standard (Linco Research, St. Charles, Mo, USA). Free and bound radioactivity was separated by use of an anti-IgG antibody (Linco). The sensitivity of the assay is 12 pmol/l and the coefficiency of variation &#x0003c;3% at both low and high levels.

At least 10 islets per mouse were examined. The percentage of individual islet areas occupied by amyloid, as indicated by Congo red positive staining, was visually estimated and scored as follows: 0% = score 0, between 0 and 26% = score 1, 26&#x02013;50% = score 2, 51&#x02013;75% = score 3, and 76&#x02013;100% = score 4. The Amyloid Index (range: 0&#x02013;100) of an individual mouse was calculated as (1 &#x000d7; <italic>N</italic>1 + 2 &#x000d7; <italic>N</italic>2 + 3 &#x000d7; <italic>N</italic>3 + 4 &#x000d7; <italic>N</italic>4) &#x000d7; 25/<italic>n</italic>, where <italic>N</italic>1 is the number of islets with score 1, <italic>N</italic>2 the number with score 2, and so on, and <italic>n</italic> is the total number of islets investigated.

Islets (<italic>n</italic> = 5&#x02013;8 per animal) were randomly selected from different parts of the sections from 4 mice, 2 males and 2 females in each group. The transgenic mice analyzed were rated as negative for amyloid.

Krefeld, Germany).</p><p>Islets were isolated from the pancreas of 6-month-old hIAPP transgenic male mice, essentially as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. Briefly, under halothane anaesthesia, the abdomen was opened. The pancreas was excised starting from the spleen site to the duodenum. Subsequently, the pancreas was brougth in 10 mL sterile Krebs-Ringer-buffer supplemented with 25 mmol/L Hepes (KRH) and containing 10% Bovine Serum Albumin (BSA) at 4&#x000b0;C. Next, the pancreas was chopped, digested using a two-stage incubation of 20 minutes at 37&#x000b0;C with successively 1.0 and 0.7 mg/mL collagenase (Sigma type XI, Sigma, St Louis, MO, USA). Islets were separated from exocrine tissue by centrifugation over a discontinuous dextran gradient [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>] and further purified by handpicking into 9 cm petridishes with 12 mL KRH buffer, pH = 7.4, supplemented with 10% BSA penicillin (100 units/mL)/streptomycin (0.1 mg/mL) (KRH 10% BSA P/S) and glucose to a concentration of 11 mM. Two days after isolation, the islets from 12 mice were pooled, mixed and split into portions. Four portions of 75 islets each were fixed and embedded for amyloid quantification. Eight portions of approximately 90 islets were transferred to culture medium with 28 mM glucose. Medium was changed every 2-3 days, switching between 11 mM and 28 mM of glucose (to prevent possible desensitization of the beta cells). Islets were counted, while being picked into the dishes with fresh medium. At 3 weeks after islet isolation, the cultured islets were fixed and embedded for amyloid quantification.</p></sec><sec sec-type="subsection" id="subsec2.7"><title>2.7.

DISCUSSION</title><sec sec-type="subsection" id="subsec4.1"><title>4.1. High-fat diet and amyloid formation</title><p>In this study, transgenic mice overproducing the amyloidogenic hIAPP in their pancreatic islet beta cells, as well as NT control mice, were fed a high-fat diet for 14 months, in order to evaluate the impact on islet amyloid formation and glucose homeostasis when combining these two potentially diabetogenic factors. We anticipated a marked islet amyloid formation in the hIAPP transgenic mice on the high-fat diet because we previously observed that crossbreeding the hIAPP transgenic mice with the Obese mouse (being severly insulin resistant) resulted in extensive islet amyloid formation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. Also, when insulin resistance was induced in hIAPP mice by crossbreeding with the obese Agouti viable yellow mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>] or by exogenous growth hormone and glucocorticoids [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>], islet amyloid formation was promoted. In addition, high-fat feeding induced islet amyloid formation in approximately 80% of male mice in another hIAPP transgenic colony [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. However, we found that only four out of the 19 hIAPP mice (approx. 40% of the males) that were followed for 14 months on the high-fat diet did develop islet amyloid. This lower frequency might be due to differences in the genetic background and/or the composition of the diet, influencing insulin resistance and IAPP expression. The amyloid index in those four high-fat fed mice was higher than in six of 33 similarly aged hIAPP mice (approx. 30% of the males) which developed amyloid on a regular diet (11.0 &#x000b1; 6.2 versus 4.2 &#x000b1; 2.9, <italic>P</italic> = .024) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. This indicates that although long-term, high-fat diet indeed has the capacity to promote islet amyloid formation in these hIAPP transgenic mice, the efficiency is not high. Crossbreeding the hIAPP mice with leptin-deficient Obese mice introduced more severe obesity and insulin resistance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>] as compared to the high-fat diet. Consequently, these other factors seem of importance for the promotion of islet amyloid formation. Another factor might be hyperglycemia, which is more severe in the hIAPP ob/ob mice as compared to the hIAPP mice on high-fat diet. Such a hypothesis is supported by the finding that in isolated pancreatic islets of our hIAPP mice, islet amyloid was detected by electron microscopy after culture in high-glucose medium but not in low-glucose medium [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. Other mechanisms may, however, also be of importance.</p></sec><sec sec-type="subsection" id="subsec4.2"><title>4.2. High fat diet and glucose tolerance</title><p>In this study, we also observed severe glucose intolerance in female but not in male hIAPP transgenic mice. The finding that in all groups of mice plasma insulin levels failed to return to basal within 2 hours after the glucose load is in accordance with high-fat diet inducing insulin resistance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. Also, the higher insulin levels in male mice versus female mice is well known from previous studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. Thus, our data indicate that the overproduction of insulin in response to insulin resistance after high-fat diet was adequate in hIAPP males but not in hIAPP females. Since there was no gender difference in the amyloid formation in high-fat fed hIAPP mice, these results suggest that a metabolic impact of high levels of circulating IAPP underlies the gender difference in glucose tolerance of hIAPP transgenic mice after high-fat diet. IAPP has, thus, been shown to inhibit insulin secretion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>] as well as to inhibit glycogen synthesis in rat muscle tissue [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>] through inhibition of glycogen synthase and stimulation of glycogen phosphorylase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]. In addition, it has been observed that IAPP administration induces insulin resistance in rats [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>], although no such effect was evident in humans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>]. IAPP has also in some studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>] but not in others [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>] been shown to increase liver glucose production. Whether these actions show gender differences, and thus may explain the remarkable glucose intolerance observed in female but not in male hIAPP transgenic mice on the high-fat diet, is not known. Indeed, it is striking that although male rodents generally are more prone to insulin resistance than females, the hIAPP transgenic females on high-fat diet are more glucose intolerant than their male littermates. Since insulin levels are not lower in the hIAPP females compared to the NT females, these data suggest that insulin sensitivity is impaired in the female hIAPP mice.</p></sec><sec sec-type="subsection" id="subsec4.3"><title>4.3. High-fat diet and GLUT-2 expression</title><p>Islet GLUT-2 mRNA expression was reduced in hIAPP transgenic versus NT mice, and this reduction appeared more severe in female than in male mice. Beta cell GLUT-2 expression is known to correlate with glucose responsiveness of the cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>]. However, insulin levels were not reduced in the male or female hIAPP mice. Therefore, it is presently not known if and how the reduced GLUT-2 mRNA expression among the transgenic mice might be related to the glucose intolerance in the female hIAPP mice. Also, the mechanism of hIAPP mediated downregulation of islet GLUT-2 mRNA expression is unknown, but our data indicate that in addition to inhibition of insulin action in muscle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>] IAPP can (in) directly inhibit glucose responsiveness of islet beta cells by affecting GLUT-2 expression.</p><p>In conclusion, this in vivo study shows that promoting insulin resistance over a long period of time by giving a high-fat diet for 14 months promotes islet amyloid formation in hIAPP transgenic mice, although less extensively than in the severe insulin-resistant Obese, leptin-deficient hIAPP mice. This suggests that the degree of insulin resistance is important for extensive development of islet amyloid. In addition, we observed a remarkable gender difference in that severe glucose intolerance was observed only in female hIAPP transgenic mice given high-fat diet and not in males. We suggest that this gender difference is due to the high level of circulating IAPP rather than to islet amyloid formation. If and how this glucose intolerance might be mediated by downregulation of beta cell GLUT-2 gene expression, as observed in the hIAPP mice, is presently unknown.</p></sec><sec sec-type="subsection" id="subsec4.4"><title>4.4. Ex vivo islet amyloidosis model</title><p>The rationale for the ex vivo study was to examine if amyloid would be formed in isolated and cultured pancreatic islets from hIAPP mice, to such a degree that it would be detectable with light microscopy. Since both the present and previous [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>] in vivo data indicated the development of islet amyloid notably in male hIAPP mice, we decided to investigate amyloid formation in such islets specifically from male mice. To increase the potential for amyloid formation, we bred the mice to homozygosity for the hIAPP transgene. At an age of 6 months, homozygous transgenic hIAPP males had islet amyloid in about 5% of their pancreatic islets, at 2 days after islet isolation. Previously, we detected amyloid fibrils by electron microscopy in islets from 4&#x02013;10 months old heterozygous hIAPP transgenic mice, cultured for 1 week in medium with 11 or 28 mM glucose [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. With the present model, using islets from 6-month-old homozygous hIAPP transgenic males, cultured in medium with high glucose (switching between 11 and 28 mM), we can detect amyloid deposits with Congo red staining and light microscopy, thus enabling quantification of the degree of islet amyloidosis. The number of amyloid-positive islets increased more than 10 fold (from 5.5 to 70%) after 3 weeks of culture in medium containing a high glucose concentration. Although an accurate comparison between the degrees of islet amyloid formation in vivo and ex vivo was not made, our data certainly indicate stronger islet amyloid formation in hIAPP islets cultured ex vivo as compared to in vivo. This might be explained by the higher glucose concentrations in the ex vivo system. hIAPP transgenic mice in vivo have normal plasma glucose concentrations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>], whereas ex vivo the glucose concentration in the medium switched between 11 and 28 mM. It is known that a high glucose concentration triggers both insulin and IAPP secretion, and the hIAPP transgene is under control of an insulin promoter. In addition, macrophages have been implicated in in vivo removal of (beginning) amyloid deposits [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>] and such macrophages are absent in the ex vivo system, potentially allowing increased amyloid formation. When combined with a more accurate amyloid quantification procedure involving image analysis, this ex vivo system may present a fast and convenient model to study the process (and factors involved) of islet amyloidosis, as well as the detrimental consequences for individual beta cells (apoptosis) and islet function (insulin producing capacity). In addition, such a model system might be used as an amyloidosis assay to assess the potency of known and novel therapeutic strategies, aimed at reducing, or even preventing, islet amyloid formation, and its effects on beta cell and islet function.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGMENTS</title><p>The authors wish to thank Lena Kvist (Lund University, Lund), Bart de Haan (University of Groningen), Gerard Graad (Department of Endocrinology, UMC Utrecht), Renske Luneborg-Van Netten (Department of Pathology, UMC Utrecht), Herma Boere and Toon Hesp (Animal House Utrecht University) for expert technical assistance and Dr. P.
