We demonstrate for the first time that lung-recruited &#x0201c;exudate&#x0201d; macrophages significantly contribute to alveolar epithelial cell (AEC) apoptosis by the release of tumor necrosis factor&#x02013;related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) in a murine model of influenza-induced pneumonia. Using CC-chemokine receptor 2&#x02013;deficient (CCR2<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup>) mice characterized by defective inflammatory macrophage recruitment, and blocking anti-CCR2 antibodies, we show that exudate macrophage accumulation in the lungs of influenza-infected mice is associated with pronounced AEC apoptosis and increased lung leakage and mortality. Among several proapoptotic mediators analyzed, TRAIL messenger RNA was found to be markedly up-regulated in alveolar exudate macrophages as compared with peripheral blood monocytes. Moreover, among the different alveolar-recruited leukocyte subsets, TRAIL protein was predominantly expressed on macrophages. Finally, abrogation of TRAIL signaling in exudate macrophages resulted in significantly reduced AEC apoptosis, attenuated lung leakage, and increased survival upon IV infection. Collectively, these findings demonstrate a key role for exudate macrophages in the induction of alveolar leakage and mortality in IV pneumonia. Epithelial cell apoptosis induced by TRAIL-expressing macrophages is identified as a major underlying mechanism.</p></abstract></article-meta><notes><fn-group><fn><p>Abbreviations used: AEC, alveolar epithelial cell; BAL, bronchoalveolar lavage; BALF, BAL fluid; CCL2, CC-chemokine ligand 2; CCR2, CC-chemokine receptor 2; FasL, Fas ligand; IV, influenza virus; mRNA, messenger RNA; pi, post infection; TRAIL, TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand.</p></fn></fn-group></notes></front><body><p>Influenza viruses (IVs) may cause primary viral pneumonia in humans with fatal outcome as soon as the pathogen spreads from the upper respiratory tract to the alveolar air space, especially during infections with highly pathogenic IV. Early innate immune responses initiate the release of proinflammatory chemokines and the recruitment of neutrophils, lymphocytes, and particularly mononuclear phagocytes into the alveolar air space to limit viral spread (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">1</xref>). The mononuclear phagocyte system of the lung is composed of resident interstitial and alveolar macrophages (F4/80<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>CD11c<sup>high</sup>MHCII<sup>low</sup>) and pulmonary DCs (F4/80<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>CD11c<sup>high</sup>MHCII<sup>high</sup>), both derived from a common BM precursor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">3</xref>). During lung inflammation and IV infection, peripheral blood monocytes (GR1<sup>int</sup>F4/80<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>CD11c<sup>&#x02212;</sup>CD11b<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>CD115<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>) are recruited to the alveolar compartment of the lung via the interaction of CC-chemokine ligand 2 (CCL2), which is released from alveolar epithelial cells (AECs) with its monocytic receptor CC-chemokine receptor 2 (CCR2) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">6</xref>). These &#x0201c;exudate&#x0201d; macrophages acquire a lung resident macrophage phenotype and finally replenish the alveolar macrophage pool during the time course of infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">7</xref>).</p><p>Besides their essential host defense functions, mononuclear phagocytes have been proposed to contribute to an imbalanced detrimental immune response during IV pneumonia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">9</xref>) and have been implicated in alveolar epithelial damage. Human IV pneumonia, which is characterized by rapid progression to lung failure and poor outcome, has gained in importance during the recent outbreaks in Southeast Asia. Infection with highly pathogenic IV causes significant tissue damage to the lungs with acute alveolitis followed by massive pulmonary edema and hemorrhage and extensive destruction of the respiratory epithelium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">12</xref>). However, the distinct molecular steps of macrophage&#x02013;epithelial interaction during IV-induced acute lung injury remain elusive.</p><p>Several authors suggest AEC apoptosis to be an underlying mechanism of alveolar damage in murine and human models of adult respiratory distress syndrome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">15</xref>). Death receptors and their ligands play an important role in the orchestration of innate and adaptive immune responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">16</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">18</xref>). TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) is a transmembrane protein belonging to the TNF superfamily. Among the members of this family, TRAIL exhibits the highest homology to Fas ligand (FasL), a well known inducer of programmed cell death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">18</xref>). Being expressed mainly on T cells, NK cells, and mononuclear phagocyte subsets, murine TRAIL exerts its proapoptotic signals via binding to DR5 (death receptor 5) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">19</xref>) and displays potent antitumor activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">21</xref>). Recently, an antiviral function in experimental murine IV infection has been suggested (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">18</xref>). However, the contribution of TRAIL to alveolar epithelial apoptosis and lung barrier dysfunction during lethal IV pneumonia has not been elucidated yet.</p><p>In the present study, in a murine model of IV-induced acute lung injury, we demonstrate for the first time that exudate macrophages recruited via the CCL2-CCR2 axis largely contribute to AEC apoptosis involving the expression of TRAIL. Both blockade of the specific chemokine-receptor axis and abrogation of macrophage TRAIL signaling by anti-TRAIL mAb treatment or use of adoptively transferred mice recruiting TRAIL-deficient exudate macrophages significantly reduced alveolar epithelial apoptosis and lung leakage in infected mice, resulting in increased survival during otherwise fatal IV pneumonia.</p><sec><title>RESULTS</title><sec><title>Genetic deletion of CCR2 reduces mortality, morbidity, and alveolar barrier dysfunction during PR/8 infection</title><p>Previous reports suggest that the chemokine receptor CCR2 is critically involved in host immune responses to lung infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">22</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">24</xref>). To investigate the influence of CCR2 on the course of IV pneumonia in mice, C57BL/6 WT and CCR2<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice were intratracheally inoculated with a lethal dose of the mouse-adapted IV strain PR/8, and survival and body weight were determined during the 21 d post infection (pi).

Likewise, body weight loss was significantly less in CCR2<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice on days 8, 9, and 11 pi. To evaluate whether the observed differences in morbidity and mortality during PR/8 infection were associated with increased severity of lung injury in WT mice as compared with CCR2<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice, alveolar barrier function was assessed during a time course of 21 d after PR/8 infection in the two treatment groups.

Analyses of viral replication in lung homogenates from PR/8-infected WT compared with CCR2<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice revealed no significant differences in peak viral titers at days 2, 3, and 5 pi and even slightly elevated virus titers in CCR2<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice during the later stages of infection (1.05 &#x000b1; 1.33 &#x000d7; 10<sup>3</sup> vs. 6.20 &#x000b1; 3.90 &#x000d7; 10<sup>3</sup> foci-forming units/lung on day 11 pi; <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 C</xref>).

One of the hallmarks of acute lung injury is an incremental alveolar barrier dysfunction followed by accumulation of protein-rich edema fluid in the alveolar compartment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">27</xref>). Both viral pathogenicity factors and imbalanced host immune responses have been attributed a role in IV-induced lung failure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">28</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">30</xref>). However, the molecular cross talk between immune and lung structural cell populations that leads to severe immunopathology and organ dysfunction is largely unknown.</p><p>Therefore, we tested the hypothesis that exudate macrophages, recruited to the lung in a CCL2/CCR2-dependent manner, might contribute to lung barrier dysfunction during lethal IV infection. In fact, alveolar barrier function, which is severely affected in IV-infected WT mice, was found to be significantly improved in CCR2-deficient mice exhibiting defective exudate macrophage recruitment. Consequently, CCR2 deficiency was associated with drastically decreased mortality during experimental IV pneumonia. Moreover, the pronounced lung leakage observed in WT mice correlated with an increased AEC apoptosis rate found to be induced by TRAIL, which is predominantly expressed in exudate lung macrophages. Finally, treatment of IV-infected WT mice with an anti-TRAIL mAb or use of mice recruiting TRAIL-deficient exudate macrophages not only attenuated alveolar leakage but significantly reduced mortality from IV pneumonia. Collectively, these results demonstrate that macrophage recruitment to IV-infected lungs in mice exerts detrimental effects on lung parenchymal cells of the highly sensitive gas exchange compartment severely affecting alveolar barrier function via TRAIL-induced epithelial apoptosis.</p><p>CCR2 is known to play a crucial role in host defense against pathogens. Interacting with its primary ligand CCL2 (MCP-1), CCR2 mediates the egress of GR1<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> monocytes from the BM and their recruitment from peripheral blood to sites of infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">31</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">33</xref>). In our own previous studies, we demonstrated that monocyte transmigration upon epithelial PR/8 infection in vitro was strictly dependent on the CCL2-CCR2 axis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">4</xref>). Thus, we assumed that the reduced lung leakage and mortality observed in CCR2-deficient mice during IV infection might be attributed to abrogated pulmonary macrophage accumulation. In fact, as demonstrated by the use of chimeric mice, loss of alveolar barrier function was solely dependent on CCR2 expression on circulating monocytes, indicating that mononuclear phagocyte traffic was critically involved and that CCR2-positive resident lung cell populations did not contribute to increased lung permeability in our model. Interestingly, a reduction of lung macrophage recruitment by 50% resulted in an approximately fivefold decrease in alveolar leakage, suggesting that alveolar damage only occurs beyond a critical threshold of macrophage accumulation and that partial inhibition of macrophage recruitment during IV pneumonia may strongly attenuate lung injury while presumably maintaining critical macrophage host defense functions.</p><p>Several authors demonstrated both release of GR1<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> monocytes from the BM into the circulation and their inflammatory organ recruitment to be CCR2 dependent, with CCR2<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice exhibiting diminished peripheral blood monocyte counts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">33</xref>). Accordingly, GR1<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> peripheral blood monocytes were revealed to be &#x0223c;50% less in PR/8-infected CCR2-deficient mice and in anti-CCR2 mAb&#x02013;treated mice in our study (unpublished data), confirming the aforementioned data and supporting the concept of CCR2 involvement in distinct steps of monocyte homeostasis under inflammatory and noninflammatory conditions. Additionally, direct antibody-mediated cytotoxicity might account for reduced GR1<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> blood monocyte numbers in anti-CCR2 mAb&#x02013;treated mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">34</xref>). Therefore, a contribution of reduced circulating monocyte numbers to the attenuation of acute lung injury in IV pneumonia cannot be totally excluded.</p><p>CCR2 deficiency was found to be associated with a slight but significant delay in viral clearance, confirming observations reported previously by Dawson et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">1</xref>) who suggest delayed adaptive immune responses as the underlying mechanism. However, we were not able to detect significant differences in the alveolar accumulation of CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> or CD8<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T lymphocytes despite the observed delay in DC recruitment, which is known as the major APC population. Ongoing IV replication in CCR2<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice seemingly had no effect on alveolar epithelial integrity. In fact, epithelial apoptosis occurred when exudate macrophages were alveolar recruited in PR/8-infected WT mice between days 7 and 14 pi. This correlated with the bulk of mortality that was observed when virus titers were already reduced &#x0223c;100-fold and IV nucleoprotein detection in AECs declined. These data support the concept that macrophage-mediated immune pathology accounts for the severity of PR/8-induced lung injury in WT mice. Correspondingly, in a milder nonlethal model of IV infection (x31) where exudate macrophage numbers were &#x0223c;75% lower than in PR/8-infected WT mice, lung injury was considerably less pronounced, emphasizing the predominant role of host immune responses in IV-induced pathology.</p><p>Alveolar epithelial apoptosis has been described as a common feature of acute lung injury caused by direct or indirect factors such as pneumonia, aspiration, sepsis, or trauma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">15</xref>). Apoptosis is a regulated form of cell death that is mediated by membrane death receptors (extrinsic pathway) and direct mitochondrial injury (intrinsic pathway). Apoptosis has been described to occur in the lungs of patients with acute lung injury by activation of the epithelial membrane Fas death receptor by soluble FasL, released from invading leukocytes and accumulating in a biologically active form at the onset of lung injury (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">35</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">36</xref>). However, in our model of IV-induced acute lung injury, FasL transcripts were not differentially regulated in the macrophage subsets analyzed. In contrast, the proapoptotic molecule TRAIL not expressed in peripheral blood monocytes was found to be strongly up-regulated in exudate macrophages recruited into the alveolar space in IV-infected WT mice, whereas TRAIL was undetectable in the alveolar mononuclear phagocytes of IV-infected CCR2<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice. TRAIL induction in alveolar exudate macrophages may be caused by the recruitment process into the lung itself or by inflammatory mediators present within the IV-infected alveolar compartment. Notably, TRAIL induction on recruited macrophages was observed in PR/8 infection, representing a very severe and highly inflammatory form of IV pneumonia in mice, but not in x31 infection, suggesting that TRAIL-mediated alveolar injury might be restricted to severe forms of IV pneumonia as observed during human H5N1 infections. Consistent with this, previous reports identified type I IFNs as potent inducers of TRAIL in monocytes and DCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">37</xref>). Indeed, we found IFN-&#x003b1; to be alveolar released upon PR/8 infection in WT mice yet peaking early by day 2 pi (219 &#x000b1; 78 pg/ml; unpublished data). TRAIL, acting as a membrane-bound or soluble form, has been known to induce apoptosis in various tumor cells but not in nonneoplastic cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">21</xref>). Recently, TRAIL expressed on lymphocyte subpopulations, DCs, and monocyte-derived macrophages has been associated with antiviral host responses during IV infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">38</xref>), underlining the importance of death pathways in antiviral immunity. In contrast, Wurzer et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">39</xref>) found TRAIL-induced programmed cell death pathways to be crucial for IV propagation in vitro. In mice, TRAIL exclusively acts via the membrane DR5 that is expressed on the target cell. Interestingly, DR5 was up-regulated in primary murine AECs in vitro and in vivo upon PR/8 infection, suggesting that a preceding epithelial IV infection might facilitate TRAIL-induced apoptosis as a potential host mechanism to limit viral spread. Indeed, in our model, PR/8 clearance revealed to be delayed in mice upon anti-TRAIL treatment. However, DR5 expression was also detectable in uninfected epithelial cells, indicating that exudate macrophage TRAIL may have the potential to attack noninfected epithelial cells as well when released in large amounts. Consistent with this, the number of infected (NP<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>) AECs was only slightly reduced in WT compared with CCR2<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice on days 11 and 14 pi, indicating only partial selectivity of TRAIL-mediated killing between infected and noninfected cells. These data suggest that, upon such conditions, the destructive effects of TRAIL prevail over its antiviral function thereby leading to enhanced lung injury and mortality.</p><p>A recent study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">40</xref>) confirms the concept that monocyte-derived cells significantly contribute to immunopathology and lung injury in PR/8 pneumonia, but the authors suggest the underlying mechanism to be an increased production of inducible nitric oxide synthase and TNF-&#x003b1;. Regarding TNF-&#x003b1; release, we could not detect significant differences in alveolar-secreted TNF-&#x003b1; during the time course after PR/8 infection in WT and CCR2-deficient mice (unpublished data). As previously published by Akaike et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">41</xref>), reactive oxygen and nitrogen species have been detected in the alveolar fluid of IV infected mice, and macrophages and neutrophils were identified as the primary source. Although Lin et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">40</xref>) did not provide direct evidence that monocyte/macrophage-derived reactive nitrogen species accounted for the observed lung damage in their model, it is conceivable that macrophage-released proinflammatory mediators additionally contribute to lung injury in IV pneumonia.</p><p>Altogether, our study demonstrates for the first time a key role of exudate macrophage TRAIL in AEC apoptosis promoting alveolar barrier dysfunction during IV lung infection. Notably, inhibition of TRAIL activity largely protected mice from lethal IV pneumonia. Targeting the TRAIL&#x02013;DR5 pathway might therefore be a suitable tool for restoring lung epithelial function in patients suffering from severe IV pneumonia.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec disp-level="3"><title>Reagents.</title><p>The following anti&#x02013;mouse mAbs/secondary reagents were used for flow cytometry: CD45.2-FITC and CD45.2-PerCP-Cy5.5 (30F-11), CD45.1-PE (A20), GR1-PE and GR1-FITC (RB6-8C5), GR1-PE-Cy7 (RB6-8C5), biotinylated I-A/I-E (2G9), NK1.1-APC (PK136), CD4-FITC (RM4-4), biotinylated CD8-&#x003b1; (53&#x02013;6.7), CD11c-PE (HL3), CD11b-FITC (M1/70), SA-APC-Cy7, biotinylated F(ab&#x02032;)<sub>2</sub> anti&#x02013;mouse Ig, Streptavidin-PE, isotype-matched control IgG antibodies (all BD), F4/80&#x02013;Alexa Fluor 647 (CI:A3-1; Invitrogen), F4/80&#x02013;Alexa Fluor 488 (BM8; Invitrogen), CD11c-PE-Cy5.5 (418; Invitrogen), CD115-PE (MCA1898; AbD Serotec), T1&#x003b1;/Podoplanin/gp36 (Abcam), TRAIL-PE (N2B2; BioLegend), TRAIL R2 (DR5)&#x02013;PE (118929; R&#x00026;D Systems), isotype-PE (rat IgG2a&#x003ba;; BioLegend), antiinfluenza NP (Meridian Life Science, Inc.), annexin V&#x02013;Alexa Fluor 647, anti&#x02013;hamster Ig Alexa Fluor 488, and anti&#x02013;mouse Ig Alexa Fluor 647 (all Invitrogen). 150 &#x003bc;g of low endotoxin/azide-free anti-TRAIL mAb (N2B2; IgG2a; BioLegend) in 150 &#x003bc;l PBS<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> was applied i.p. at days 3, 5, 7, and 9 pi, and 75 &#x003bc;g of rat anti&#x02013;mouse CCR2 mAb (IgG2b; gift from M.
