Beta-2 adrenergic receptor gene polymorphisms Gln27Glu, Arg16Gly, and Thr164Ile were suggested to have a significant effect in patients with heart failure. In a study of 259 patients with ischemic or idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy, prognosis was less favorable in patients harboring the allele Ile164 relative to patients harboring the allele Thr164. In patients harboring alleles Gly16 and Glu27, previoulsy associated with increased down regulation of beta-2 adrenergic receptors, a statistically significant difference relative to prognosis has not been demonstrated. However, a trend to a prognostic influence of allele Gly16 was suggested by an apparent and non-significant lower survival rate in patients harboring allele Gly16 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. The polymorphisms Thr164Ile, Arg16Gly and the haplotypes with alleles Gly16 and Gln27 were associated with reduced exercise tolerance in other study that enrolled 232 patients with idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy or ischemic cardiomyopathy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. These findings substantiate the hypotheses that polymorphisms Arg16Gly, Gln27Glu and Thr164Ile of beta-2 receptor gene might be functional and might be associated with differences in the survival rate of patients with heart failure. Therefore, due to sparse and sometimes conflicting results, this hypothesis deserves further testing in different populations.</p><p>We performed this study to evaluate the polymorphisms Gln27Glu, Arg16Gly, and Thr164Ile of the beta-2 receptor gene relative to demographic and clinical variables, as well as, survival rate in a series of patients with heart failure of different etiologies.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Study population</title><p>501 patients with heart failure in functional class III or IV of the New York Heart Association were studied.

In this new model (using data from 471 cases and 185 events), not only the interaction term was significantly associated with mortality, but the marginal term for the Gln27Glu polymorphism was also associated with heart failure mortality in our population. Both terms remained significantly associated with mortality even after adjustment for age, serum sodium, serum creatinine, ethnicity, baseline beta-blocker use, and heart failure etiology (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref>). In fact, while a significant difference in relation to overall mortality was not observed for Gln27Glu genotypes in heart failure individuals younger than 65 years of age, a clear difference was observed when only individuals older than 65 years were analyzed (a subgroup comprising 30% of the studied sample) (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). In addition, a tendency towards increased mortality of Glu allele carriers was present in older individuals with both systolic and diastolic types of heart failure included in our cohort.</p><fig position="float" id="F2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p><bold>Kaplan-Meir survival curves for the Gln27Glu polymorphism per age group</bold>. Gray lines: GlnGln genotype; black lines: GlnGlu + GluGlu genotypes.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1471-2261-9-50-2"/></fig><p>Taking into account the linkage disequilibrium between Arg16Gly and Gln27Glu (in our population of 93), our data point to an effect derived specifically form the Glu27 allele. First, allele analysis in older individuals were only able to disclose a significant association for the Glu27 allele (p = 0,002 for mortality), but not for the Arg16 or Gly16 allele (p = 0,33). Second, haplotype analysis showed a higher frequency of the Gly16/Glu27 haplotype in individuals who died (p = 0,001), but a lower frequency of the Gly16/Gln27 in individuals that died (p = 0,03). No difference was observed for the Arg16/Gln27 between patients who died and patients that did not, and the Arg16/Glu27 was, as expected, very rare in these individuals. These data suggest that, in fact, the effect was only present for the Gln27Glu polymorphism, and not derived indirectly from the strong LD pattern with the Arg16Gly polymorphism.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>The different genotypes of polymorphisms Gln27Glu and Arg16Gly were present in the study sample in a distribution in accordance with previous reports including a Brazilian population sample [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. Most genotypes of polymorphism Thr164Ile were homozygous for Thr164Thr; no patient homozygous for Ile164Ile was identified. Thr164Ile was identified only in 9 patients (2%), a lower frequency than observed in a previous experiment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. The number was considered small to the point of hindering appropriate statistical analysis and further analysis of this polymorphism relative to survival rate was not performed.</p><p>We observed a significant difference in the distribution of the polymorphism Arg16Gly relative to body mass index in this study sample of patients with heart failure. In a previous study of a general population sample, Arg16Gly polymorphism interacted significantly with body mass index to determine systolic blood pressure. Further, the presence of Arg16 allele was associated with 1.49-fold increase in the risk of obesity in multiple logistic regression model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. Thus, the relationship between the presence of Arg16 and body mass index may be operative also in patients with heart failure. Nevertheless, we have not observed a significant effect of this genetic marker in relation to mortality.</p><p>We were not able to demonstrate a significant association between survival rate for the overall sample and the different genotypes, alleles or haplotypes of polymorphisms Gln27Glu and Arg16Gly in this study sample at the significance level of p &#x0003c; 0.05. The significant variables associated with mortality - low body mass index [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>], etiology of heart failure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>], serum sodium [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>], serum creatinine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>] are known from previous experiences. Interestingly, we have observed a potential interaction between age and Gln27Glu polymorphism in modulating mortality incidence of the studied patients. In this scenario, the Gln27Glu polymorphism is predictive of a higher mortality only in individuals older than 65 years of age. Allele and haplotype analysis suggest that the main predictor of this effect was the Gln27Glu polymorphism and not, indirectly, the Arg16Gly polymorphism.</p><p>Similar to Ligget et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>] and to De Groote et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>] we did not find a significant association between the Arg16Gly and Gln27Glu polymorphism and survival when analyzing the entire population. Different from the described by De Groote et al., however, we observed a tendency of a lower survival rate in the Gly16Glu27 haplotype and not the Gly16Gln27 haplotype [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. Nevertheless, we are not the first group to describe this particular association. Forleo et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>] also described a significantly higher risk for death from heart failure (among other end-points) associated with the Glu27 allele in homozygosis in a similar population than ours, patients with dilated cardiomyopathy. Others, however, have observed exactly the opposite association [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. In particular, Heckbert et al, studying a large sample of elderly individuals without heart failure observed the Glu27 allele to be associated with a lower risk of incident coronary events [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. Since the Gln27Glu polymorphism may modulate the response to beta-blocker treatment in humans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>], different frequency of beta-blocker use in these different populations and different studied clinical scenarios may explain, at least in part, such discordant findings.</p><p>Our study has limitations. Demographic and clinical characteristics of the patients in this study sample may also have been operative for our findings. Specifically, in patients with severe disease in an advanced stage of its natural history, other variables denoting the clinical condition may be more significant for the evaluation of prognosis than a specific genetic substrate. Different etiologies of heart failure in this study sample may also limit the observation. For several baseline predictors we were unable to acquire complete information and we did not have access to follow-up information on medical therapy that could not only modulate overall survival, but also the effect of a particular genotype. Finally, the duration of follow-up was only mid-term.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>The distribution of genotypes of polymorphism Arg16Gly was statistically significant relative to body mass index. We were not able to demonstrate a prognostic influence of polymorphisms Gln27Glu and Arg16Gly of beta-2 receptor gene, as individual alleles or as haplotypes, for the entire spectrum of patients with heart failure. Rather, there appears to be a specific modulating effect of the Gln27Glu polymorphism in individuals older than 65 years and heart failure. Further studies should address the specific role of the Glu27 allele in heart failure deterioration, especially in older individuals.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>AJM conceived the study, participated in the design of the study, data acquisition, interpretation of data and drafted the manuscript; RSF participated in data acquisition; RAC participated in data acquisition; RN conducted initial statistical analysis; APA participated in data acquisition; ACPL participated in data acquisition; JEK participated in the design of the study and supervised molecular analysis; ACP conceived the study, participated in the design of the study, data acquisition, statistical analysis and draft the manuscript.
