NTHi causes otitis media and conductive hearing loss in children while pulmonary presence of this facultative intracellular pathogen is implicated as an infectious trigger in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) in adults [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. The emergence of antibiotic-resistance strains of NTHi and the difficulty of development of efficacious vaccines urge further efforts to understand the host response mechanisms involved in NTHi infections.</p><p>The respiratory epithelium is an important interface to environmental microorganisms. In addition to provide a physical barrier against microbial invasion and contribute to mucociliary clearance, respiratory epithelial cells are actively involved in inflammation and host defense of the lung in multiple ways. In particular, type 2 alveolar epithelial cells (AECs) as a defender of the alveolus are located in alveoli where they recognize invading pathogens by extracellular and intracellular receptors and contribute to host innate immunity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. Lipid metabolites of arachidonic acid such as prostaglandins have been shown to modulate immune and inflammatory responses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. Prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) is a product of the cyclooxygenase (COX) pathway. Two isoforms of COX, the constitutively expressed COX-1 and the inducible COX-2, have been identified. PGE2 is commonly thought to have proinflammatory effects on the pathogenesis of several inflammatory diseases including rheumatoid arthritis and periodontitis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. However, increasing evidence demonstrated that pulmonary PGE2 has a role in limiting the inflammatory response and tissue repair in contrast to its counterparts in other organs of the body [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>].</p><p>The expression of COX-derived PGE2 and its molecular regulation depend on cell types and stimuli [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. In the present study, we showed that NTHi induced COX-2 expression and subsequent PGE2 production via activation of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and nuclear factor (NF)-kappa B in lung epithelial cells. The full understanding of the role of pulmonary endogenous anti-inflammatory mediators such as PGE2 and their regulation will bring new insight and develop novel treatment aiming at immune modulation.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec sec-type="materials"><title>Materials</title><p>SB203580, SB202190, PDTC, SC560, and NS398 were purchased from Sigma Chemicals (CA, USA), PGE2 ELISA kit was from R&#x00026;D Co.

Equipped with transmembranous and cytosolic pattern recognition receptors, respiratory epithelium actively participates in immune reaction against invading pathogens instead of being only a passive physical barrier [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. It has been shown that <italic>Streptococcus pneumoniae</italic>, <italic>Chlamydia pneumoniae</italic>, <italic>Moraxella catarrhalis</italic>, and respiratory syncytial virus induced COX-2 expression in pulmonary epithelium [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. However, whether NTHi infections have effect on the expression of COX-2 and subsequent PGE2 in lung epithelial cells still remains uncertain.</p><p>Lipid products of arachidonic acid including prostaglandins play important roles in pulmonary immune regulation. PGE2 released by lung cells is demonstrated as a potent endogenous anti-inflammatory mediator, which modulates host immune response [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. But, data about the molecular mechanisms of pulmonary PGE2 expression are very limited. In the present study, we demonstrated that NTHi induced COX-2 mRNA but not COX-1 mRNA in a dose-dependent manner in A549 cells. Furthermore, NTHi-induced PGE2 release was significantly suppressed by COX-2 specific inhibitor, but not COX-1 inhibitor. These results indicated that PGE2 release depends on COX-2 activity, in line with the previous studies by Schmeck <italic>et al</italic>. and Rupp <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>].</p><p>TLRs are well known cell surface receptors recognizing invading microbes and initiating cellular signaling pathways against bacterial components. Among of 11 mammalian TLRs, TLR2 is recognized as an important receptor for NTHi-induced signaling pathway in lung epithelial cells. Taken advantages of stably overexpressing TLR2 and TLR4 cells and TLR2 and TLR4 knock-out mice, we showed here that NTHi-induced COX-2 expression was mediated by TLR2 signaling pathway both <italic>in vitro </italic>and <italic>in vivo</italic>, but independently from TLR4. These data are in line with previous report that TLR2 is of particular important receptor for NTHi components [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>].</p><p>The lung epithelial cell signaling networks activated by NTHi have been partially elucidated in recent years. Among these signaling pathways, p38 MAPK and NF-kappa B are two key molecules which coordinate the induction of multiple genes encoding inflammatory mediators and are involved in host immune responses to NTHi infections [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Activation of p38 MAPK up-regulates inflammatory cytokines, mucin MUC5AC and down-regulates TLR2 expression while activation of NF-kappa B increases the expression of IL-8, IL-1&#x003b2;, mucin MUC2 and TLR2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. In addition, there exists an auto-regulation of NF-kappa B activation: NF-kappa B is essential for induction of cylindromatosis (CYLD) that in turn inhibits NF-kappa B signaling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. However, whether p38 and NF-kappa B are involved in COX-2 and PGE2 production induced by NTHi remained unclear. Herein, we showed that NTHi activated the phosphorylation of p38 MAPK and nuclear translocation of NF-kappa B within 90 mins, and the enhanced DNA binding activity was observed in nuclear extracts of A549 cells after NTHi inoculation. NTHi-induced COX-2 mRNA expression was markedly inhibited not only by p38 MAPK inhibitor SB203580, but also by another p38 MAPK inhibitor SB202190, and NF-kappa B inhibitor PDTC. Moreover, PGE2 release by NTHi, also, was significantly reduced by both p38 MAPK inhibitors and NF-kappa B inhibitor. The findings in the present study clearly demonstrate that the activation of p38 MAPK and NF-kappa B is involved in the regulation of COX-2 and PGE2 in NTHi-infected lung epithelium.</p><p>In this study, we found the impact of p38 MAPK on the activation of NF-kappa B. EMSA results showed that the NF-kappa B activation was not prevented by SB203580 in infected A549 cells, indicating that p38 MAPK and NF-kappa B are independent pathways regulating PGE2 expression in our experimental systems. Mancuso <italic>et al</italic>. reported that neither p38 nor ERK MAPK blockade had any effect on Group B streptococci (GBS)-induced NF-kappa B binding activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. Vallejo <italic>et al</italic>. demonstrated that p38 inhibitor SB202190 inhibited GBS-induced activator protein (AP)-1-DNA activity, but did not prevent NF-kappa B activation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. Similarly, the study by Singer et al. showed that p38 MAPK and NF-kappa B may affect COX-2 expression in human airway myocytes via separate signaling pathways given the fact that SB203580 did not affect cytokine-stimulated IkappaBalpha degradation and NF-kappa B nuclear binding activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. However, the above results cannot exclude another possibility that there exists an indirect cross-talk between p38 MAPK and NF-kappa B which converge further down in the signal cascades [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. Indeed, there are still increasing evidences that the blockade of MAPK inhibited NF-kappa B-dependent gene transcription without affecting IkappaBalpha phosphorylation and NF-kappa B-DNA binding ability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>].</p><p>In our study, the fold induction of NTHi-induced PGE2 production was relatively low compared with those from other studies conducted by using <italic>S. pneumoniae </italic>or <italic>C. pneumoniae </italic>infection model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>], possibly due to the different signaling pathways mediated. However, the absolute amount of PGE2 production measured in our study in lung epithelial cells A549 is quite equivalent to those from other studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. In addition to this, little is known about the patho-physiological role of the prostanoid intermediates including PGE2 in NTHi infections due to the absence of research information in this field. Thus, even though we could not rule the involvement of other prostanoid intermediates such as PGF and PGI in NTHi infections, we suggest here that NTHi-induced PGE2 may play an important role in NTHi infection. Further studies in the detailed molecular mechanisms underlying NTHi-induced PGE2 expression and in the pathological analysis of the role of PGE2 in NTHi infection based on the findings from present study will bring us novel insights into the therapeutic strategies of pulmonary NTHi infections.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>In conclusion, NTHi induces COX-2 and PGE2 expression in a p38 MAPK and NF-kappa B-dependent manner through TLR2 in lung epithelial cells <italic>in vitro </italic>and lung tissues <italic>in vivo</italic>.
