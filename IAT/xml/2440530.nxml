In an attempt to understand the roles of S5 in these essential cellular functions, we selected extragenic suppressors and identified <italic>rimJ</italic> as a high-copy suppressor of the cold-sensitive phenotype associated with the S5(G28D) mutation. Our studies indicate that RimJ overexpression suppresses the growth defects, anomalous ribosome profiles and mRNA misreading exhibited by the S5(G28D) mutant strain. Although previously characterized as the <italic>N</italic>-acetyltransferase of S5, our data indicate that RimJ, when devoid of acetyltransferase activity, can suppress S5(G28D) defects thus indicating that the suppression activity of RimJ is not dependent on its acetyltransferase activity. Additionally, RimJ appears to associate with pre-30S subunits indicating that it acts on the ribonucleoprotein particle. These findings suggest that RimJ has evolved dual functionality; it functions in r-protein acetylation and as a ribosome assembly factor in <italic>E. coli</italic>.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Introduction</title><p>Ribosome biogenesis in <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> (<italic>E. coli</italic>) is a highly complex and co-ordinated process that remains largely uncharacterized despite its importance to cell physiology. The ribosomal RNAs (rRNAs) are synthesized as a primary transcript, which must be processed, folded and bound by ribosomal proteins (r-proteins) to form functional ribosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b63">Wimberly <italic>et al</italic>., 2000</xref>). In <italic>E. coli</italic>, the two functionally distinct and asymmetric subunits that form the 70S, or the translationally active, ribosome are the small (30S) and large (50S) subunits. The small subunit contains a 16S rRNA and 21 r-proteins (S1-S21), while the large subunit contains two rRNAs, 5S and 23S, as well as 34 r-proteins. Thus, the process of ribosome biogenesis minimally involves the appropriate folding and interaction of over 50 r-proteins and three rRNAs (composed of more than 4000 nucleotides).</p><p>Although some bacterial ribosomal subunits self-assemble <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">Held <italic>et al</italic>., 1973</xref>), the non-physiological requirements (high temperature, high ionic conditions, long incubation and slow kinetics) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b58">Traub and Nomura, 1968</xref>) suggest that additional factors work <italic>in vivo</italic> to facilitate ribosome biogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">Nierhaus <italic>et al</italic>., 1973</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">Culver, 2003</xref>). At least 170 non-ribosomal factors are thought to be involved in ribosome biogenesis in yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">Fromont-Racine <italic>et al</italic>., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">Dez and Tollervey, 2004</xref>). In contrast, our knowledge of <italic>E. coli</italic> extra-ribosomal assembly factors is more limited (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">Hage and Tollervey, 2004</xref>). Currently, a few more than a dozen proteins have been implicated in aiding ribosome assembly in <italic>E. coli.</italic> These include chaperones (DnaK, RbfA, RimM; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">Bylund <italic>et al</italic>., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">Maki <italic>et al</italic>., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b64">Xia <italic>et al</italic>., 2003</xref>), GTPases (Era, Der, Cgt<sub>E</sub>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">Inoue <italic>et al</italic>., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b53">Sharma <italic>et al</italic>., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">Hwang and Inouye, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">Jiang <italic>et al</italic>., 2006</xref>), RNA-remodeling proteins such as RNA helicases (DeaD, SrmB, DbpA; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b52">Pugh <italic>et al</italic>., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">Charollais <italic>et al</italic>., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">2004</xref>), and RNA-modifying enzymes such as methyltransferases (KsgA, RrmJ; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">Lu and Inouye, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">Caldas <italic>et al</italic>., 2000</xref>) and pseudouridine synthases (RluD; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">Gutgsell <italic>et al</italic>., 2005</xref>). Thus while some of the enzymes responsible for rRNA modifications have been associated with ribosome biogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">Caldas <italic>et al</italic>., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">Gutgsell <italic>et al</italic>., 2005</xref>), the role of enzymes modifying r-proteins in ribosome biogenesis has not been established.</p><p>In a previous study, we identified a single mutation in S5 that confers spectinomycin resistance and cold sensitivity to <italic>E. coli</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">Kirthi <italic>et al</italic>., 2006</xref>). In the context of the large macromolecular complex (the 30S subunit), the mutation was shown to have profound effects on ribosome function, specifically tRNA binding and translational fidelity. Interestingly, this mutation is distinct from previously identified <underline>r</underline>ibosome <underline>am</underline>biguity (ram) mutations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">Ito and Wittmann, 1973</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b45">Piepersberg <italic>et al</italic>., 1975a</xref>) and thus offers new insight into the role of S5 in maintenance of translational fidelity. Additionally, this S5 mutant strain exhibits defects in ribosome biogenesis, which is associated with the cold-sensitive phenotype and this type of defect has not been reported for the other S5 ram strains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b45">Piepersberg <italic>et al</italic>., 1975a</xref>). To appreciate the basis of the functional defects of the S5(G28D) cold sensitivity in ribosome biogenesis, we selected for extragenic suppressors of the cold-sensitive phenotype using an <italic>E. coli</italic> genomic library.</p><p>Here, we describe the identification and characterization of a role of RimJ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">Cumberlidge and Isono, 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">Janda <italic>et al</italic>., 1985</xref>) in ribosome biogenesis. Our data suggest that RimJ, when overexpressed, suppresses the cold-sensitive, translational fidelity and ribosome biogenesis defects associated with S5(G28D). We have also shown that the S5(G28D) mutation in combination with <italic>rimJ</italic> deletion results in synthetic enhancement of the defective growth phenotype of the S5(G28D) strain. Additionally, we have shown that the suppressor function is independent of its acetyltransferase activity. We also demonstrate that RimJ associates with pre-30S subunits and can immunoprecipitate some 30S subunit components, including 16S rRNA, indicating that it exerts its function at the level of the RNP. Thus, an additional <italic>in vivo</italic> role has been identified for RimJ and leads to the proposal that RimJ acts as both a ribosome assembly factor and an r-protein modification enzyme.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title><italic>rimJ</italic> acts as a high-copy extragenic suppressor of S5(G28D) cold sensitivity</title><p>In an earlier study, the specific mutation of glycine to aspartate at position 28 in r-protein S5 was shown to result in spectinomycin resistance and cold sensitivity, whereby, at a reduced temperature (20&#x000b0;C), growth was undetectable for the mutant strain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">Kirthi <italic>et al</italic>., 2006</xref>). To further explore the functional defects of the S5(G28D) strain, we isolated extragenic suppressors which would rescue the S5(G28D) cold-sensitive phenotype. A high-copy pUC-based <italic>E. coli</italic> genomic library was transformed into the S5(G28D) strain and colonies that could grow at the non-permissive temperature (20&#x000b0;C) were identified. A total of 24 independent isolates were subsequently re-screened for growth at the non-permissive temperature (data not shown). A third round of screening, where plasmid DNA isolated from each of the cold-tolerant colonies was transformed again into S5(G28D) cells, resulted in the identification of five independent suppressors.</p><p>To identify the gene(s) responsible for the suppression of the cold sensitivity of the S5(G28D) strain, plasmid DNA from each of the five isolates was sequenced from both ends of the insert. Sequence analysis revealed that all of the isolates contained overlapping DNA fragments (data not shown). Although DNA sequences on either side of the overlapping elements were unique, all suppressor DNA fragments contained the entire <italic>rimJ</italic> gene. The <italic>rimJ</italic> gene is of particular interest as its product, RimJ, has been shown to acetylate the N-terminal alanine of S5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b65">Yoshikawa <italic>et al</italic>., 1987</xref>) and hence, we speculated that RimJ was the likely candidate as the suppressor. To confirm that extra copies of <italic>rimJ</italic> and thus possible overexpression of RimJ is responsible for suppression of the cold-sensitive S5 mutation, the <italic>rimJ</italic> gene was cloned into a vector (pBAD-DEST49; p<italic>-rimJ</italic>) that allows regulated expression of the gene. Induced expression of <italic>rimJ</italic> from p<italic>-rimJ</italic> alleviates the cold-sensitive phenotype of S5(G28D) thereby confirming that <italic>rimJ</italic> can act as an extragenic suppressor.</p></sec><sec><title>Overexpression of RimJ alleviates the growth defects associated with S5(G28D)</title><p>Overexpression of RimJ decreases the doubling time of S5(G28D) cells at all temperatures, although, the effect is more pronounced at the non-permissive temperature. At low temperature, the S5(G28D) strain has a doubling time at least five times longer than its parental strain and is virtually immeasurable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">Kirthi <italic>et al</italic>., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Fig. 1</xref>). Overproduction of RimJ in the S5 mutant strain reduces the doubling time to 58 min at 20&#x000b0;C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Fig. 1B</xref>), which is a comparable doubling time to the parental strain at low temperature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">Kirthi <italic>et al</italic>., 2006</xref>). While at 37&#x000b0;C, the S5(G28D) strain with overexpressed RimJ has a doubling time of 48 min compared with 54 min when the mutant cells contain the same vector (pBAD) with no insert (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Fig. 1A</xref>). Overexpresion of RimJ has no effect on the growth of wild-type cells (data not shown), suggesting that the normal dosage of RimJ is not limiting for growth in an otherwise wild-type background. This significant alteration in growth properties can be observed in liquid culture as demonstrated from the reported doubling times and on solid media as demonstrated from dilution plating experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Fig. 1</xref>). These findings indicate that increased dosage of RimJ is sufficient to suppress the cold sensitivity of S5(G28D).</p><fig id="fig01" position="float"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Analysis of growth of S5(G28D) strain in the presence and absence of RimJ.

To study this genetic link, a strain bearing a deletion of <italic>rimJ (JW1053)</italic> and the S5(G28D) mutation was constructed and the phenotype of the double mutant was analysed. Examination of doubling times revealed a growth defect of the [S5(G28D)&#x00394;<italic>rimJ</italic>] double mutant strain relative to the parental strains, S5(G28D) or &#x00394;<italic>rimJ</italic>. At reduced temperature (20&#x000b0;C), growth is virtually undetectable for both [S5(G28D)&#x00394;<italic>rimJ</italic>] and S5(G28D) strains (doubling time of &#x0003e; 300 min). At the permissive temperature (37&#x000b0;C), the double mutant strain had an exaggerated doubling time (69 min) as compared with S5(G28D) (44 min) and &#x00394;<italic>rimJ</italic> (36 min). This significant alteration in growth properties can be also observed on solid media (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Fig. 1C</xref>). As expected, deletion of <italic>rimJ</italic> (JW1053) results in a slight growth defect compared with the parental BW25113 strain at all temperatures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Fig. 1C</xref>). This suggests that although deletion of <italic>rimJ</italic> is tolerated in a S5(G28D) background, this double mutation is deleterious and that the suppression observed with RimJ overexpresson is not merely non-specific.</p></sec><sec><title>Overexpression of RimJ alleviates the ribosome defects associated with S5(G28D)</title><p>One likely cause of the growth defects observed in the S5(G28D) strain is the abnormal ribosomal subunit/functional ribosome ratio observed in this strain. Ribosomes from strains carrying the S5(G28D) mutation are characterized by an increase in free 30S and 50S subunits compared with functional 70S particles and an accumulation of precursor 30S particles, especially at the non-permissive temperature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">Kirthi <italic>et al</italic>., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02">Fig. 2</xref>). To begin to address the underlying cause of suppression, ribosomes isolated from the S5(G28D) strain with and without overexpression of RimJ were examined. Ribosome profiles from S5(G28D) carrying an empty pBAD expression plasmid, and therefore no extragenic suppressor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02">Fig. 2</xref>, panels A and C) are similar to S5(G28D) alone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">Kirthi <italic>et al</italic>., 2006</xref>). When RimJ expression is induced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02">Fig. 2</xref>, panels B and D), the profiles are altered and become more similar to those of the parental strain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02">Fig. 2</xref>, panels E and F) than to those observed in the mutant strain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02">Fig. 2</xref>, panels A and C). Concomitant with a slight change in the free subunits, increased amounts of 70S ribosomes are observed in profiles from the S5(G28D) + p<italic>-rimJ</italic> strain as compared with what is found in the S5(G28D) + pBAD strain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02">Fig. 2</xref>, panels A&#x02013;D). RimJ induction appears to only slightly alter the free 30S subunit peaks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02">Fig. 2</xref>, compare panel C with D) and the extent of this change is temperature-dependent. It is possible that the pre-30S particles containing S5(G28D) which are formed prior to RimJ induction (see Experimental procedures) are &#x02018;dead-end&#x02019; complexes and that RimJ cannot aid in their maturation. However, given the increase in functional 70S ribosome populations, and the concomitant decrease in doubling time, it seems likely that RimJ is able to aid in assembly of 30S subunits. Thus, while rescue in ribosome biogenesis of S5(G28D) strain is not complete at this level of RimJ induction, it appears that overexpression of RimJ contributes to the process. Additionally, deletion of <italic>rimJ</italic> results in slightly altered ribosome profiles relative to wild-type cells (B. Roy-Chaudhuri and G.M. Culver, unpubl. results), further indicating that RimJ plays a role in ribosome biogenesis.</p><fig id="fig02" position="float"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><p>Overexpression of RimJ alters ribosome profiles of the S5(G28D) strain.

Plasmids carrying either the wild-type <italic>lacZ</italic> gene or the <italic>lacZ</italic> gene with mutations in the 5&#x02032; end enable miscoding to be assessed by monitoring &#x003b2;-galactosidase activity <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">O'Connor <italic>et al</italic>., 1997</xref>), using both parental and mutant strains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig03">Fig. 3</xref>).

While the suppression of fidelity defects is not complete, the errors are reduced significantly and approach wild-type levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">Kirthi <italic>et al</italic>., 2006</xref>). Thus RimJ may act to restore growth rates near to wild-type in the presence of S5(G28D) by increasing not only the population of ribosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02">Fig. 2</xref>) but also elevating the translational accuracy of the ribosomes that are produced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig03">Fig. 3</xref>).</p><fig id="fig03" position="float"><label>Fig. 3</label><caption><p>RimJ rescues translational miscoding of S5(G28D).

RimJ is the <italic>N</italic>-acetyltransferase of S5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">Cumberlidge and Isono, 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b65">Yoshikawa <italic>et al</italic>., 1987</xref>) and has the well-conserved NAT (<italic>N</italic>-acetyltransferase) domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">Neuwald and Landsman, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b59">Vetting <italic>et al</italic>., 2005</xref>). Thus one possible scenario for suppression is that S5(G28D) is non-or under-acetylated and that overexpression of RimJ could increase acetylation of S5(G28D). This would offer a simple and plausible means by which RimJ can modulate the phenotypes associated with this S5 mutation. To determine the acetylation status of S5(G28D) in 30S subunits, mass spectrometry of the 30S subunit proteins isolated from the S5 mutant strain was performed. Both MALDI-TOF and ESI spectrometry were performed and revealed similar results (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref> and data not shown). Mass analysis was carried out for cells grown at both the permissive and non-permissive temperatures. Under both conditions, very similar results were obtained; however, for simplicity, only the mass analysis at the permissive temperature has been shown (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>).

Multiple alignment of the acetyltransferase domain sequences of RimJ from various species reveals that two conserved cysteines might be important for its enzymatic activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig04">Fig. 4A</xref>). Site-directed mutagenesis was carried out on p<italic>-rimJ</italic> to change the two cysteines at positions 54 and 105 in <italic>E. coli</italic> RimJ to alanine or phenylalanine residues to create four different singly and doubly substituted proteins [RimJ(C54F), RimJ(C105A), RimJ(C54F, C105A), or RimJ(C54A, C105A)]. To determine if these mutations were sufficient to obliterate acetyltransferase function, the mutant RimJ proteins were overexpressed in the <italic>rimJ</italic> deletion strain (CWZ387; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b62">White-Ziegler <italic>et al</italic>., 2002</xref>), and antibodies that recognize acetylated proteins were used to assess S5 acetylation. When wild-type RimJ is overexpressed from p<italic>-rimJ</italic> in CWZ387, a band corresponding to acetylated S5 is observed. In addition to S5, there is another small subunit r-protein, S18, which is acetylated by a separate enzyme, rimI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">Isono and Isono, 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b65">Yoshikawa <italic>et al</italic>., 1987</xref>) and this acetylated protein is also recognized by the same antibody (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig04">Fig. 4B</xref>, lane 1).

Hence, it appears that the acetyltransferase-deficient RimJ mutant acts in a similar fashion as wild-type RimJ to suppress the cold sensitivity and other phenotypes associated with S5(G28D).

These results indicate that RimJ exerts its role on the RNP and not solely on free S5.

Subunit dissociation and polysome analysis of ribosomes from S5(G28D) strain with RimJ overexpression further suggest that there is no stable interaction of RimJ with polysomes (data not shown).

RimJ was found to be associated with pre-30S subunits at different concentrations of NH<sub>4</sub>Cl tested, even at 0.5 M NH<sub>4</sub>Cl (data not shown), suggesting that the co-sedimentation of RimJ with pre-30S subunits is not fortuitous but likely due to a valid interaction. To augment our hypothesis that RimJ binds to 16S rRNA containing RNPs <italic>in vivo</italic>, we performed immunoprecipitations using RimJ. Analysis of the precipitated complexes for RNA revealed that RimJ associates with 16S rRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig05">Fig. 5B</xref>) but not with 23S rRNA (data not shown). Analysis of the immunoprecipitated complexes for specific r-proteins indicates the presence of S4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig05">Fig. 5C</xref>) but not S3 (data not shown). R-protein S4 is an early binding protein whereas S3 is a late assembling 30S subunit r-protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig05">Fig. 5D</xref>), indicating that RimJ binds to the assembling 30S RNP at an intermediate stage of assembly. This is consistent with the observation that RimJ associates with pre-30S subunits on the ribosome profile (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig05">Fig. 5A</xref>). These findings reveal that RimJ can associate with pre-subunit RNPs and it is likely via this interaction that it exerts its function in the biogenesis cascade.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>In our previous work, we identified a unique point mutation within S5 which results in a change of a glycine residue to an aspartate at a highly conserved position [S5(G28D); <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">Kirthi <italic>et al</italic>., 2006</xref>]. The S5(G28D) mutation leads to defects in ribosome biogenesis and translational fidelity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">Kirthi <italic>et al</italic>., 2006</xref>). However, this substitution is distinct from the previously characterized S5 ram mutations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">Piepersberg <italic>et al</italic>., 1975a</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">Piepersberg <italic>et al</italic>., 1975b</xref>), as the S5(G28D) mutant, unlike the other ram mutants, is cold sensitive, a hallmark of defects in ribosome biogenesis. Additionally, this S5 mutation is remote from the structural clustering of other known ram mutations including S4 ram mutations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">Donner and Kurland, 1972</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">Funatsu <italic>et al</italic>., 1972</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">van Acken, 1975</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b44">Ogle <italic>et al</italic>., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b43">Ogle and Ramakrishnan, 2005</xref>), and thus appears to be a new ram mutant. To address the functional significance of this S5 mutant, extragenic suppressors were selected by their ability to alleviate the cold sensitivity of S5(G28D) mutant strain. RimJ, which is the N-terminal acetyltransferase (NAT) of S5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b65">Yoshikawa <italic>et al</italic>., 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b48">Polevoda and Sherman, 2003</xref>), was identified as a suppressor and our work demonstrates that overexpression of the wild-type protein can alleviate phenotypes associated with S5(G28D). Additionally, we have shown that the ability of RimJ to suppress S5(G28D) defects is independent of its acetyltransferase function and therefore have identified an additional role of this protein <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p><p>Both r-proteins and rRNAs can be modified, however, the functional significance of these modifications remains unclear. Acetylation as a modification is found at the N-termini of r-proteins S5, S18 and L12 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">Cumberlidge and Isono, 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">Isono and Isono, 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">Isono and Isono, 1981</xref>), and these modifications are carried out by three separate NATs, RimJ, RimI and RimL respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b65">Yoshikawa <italic>et al</italic>., 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b57">Tanaka <italic>et al</italic>., 1989</xref>). The NAT enzyme family, with the putative acetyl-CoA-binding motifs A&#x02013;D, is ubiquitous in all kingdoms, suggesting an underlying importance to cell viability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">Neuwald and Landsman, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">Dyda <italic>et al</italic>., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b47">Polevoda and Sherman, 2002</xref>). However, like many rRNA modification genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">Lu and Inouye, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b56">Tan <italic>et al</italic>., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">Gutgsell <italic>et al</italic>., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">Baba <italic>et al</italic>., 2006</xref>), <italic>rimJ</italic> is not essential for viability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b62">White-Ziegler <italic>et al</italic>., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">Baba <italic>et al</italic>., 2006</xref>). Thus, S5 in its unacetylated state must be sufficient for ribosome assembly and function. Again, as for rRNA modifications, it is possible that modification of this r-protein aids in fine-tuning the structural and functional capacity of the translational machinery. Also, the viability of the <italic>rimJ</italic> deletion strain indicates that the additional function of RimJ uncovered in this work is not essential. Other factors associated with ribosome biogenesis in <italic>E. coli</italic> have also been shown to be dispensable for growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">Dammel and Noller, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">Bylund <italic>et al</italic>., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">Charollais <italic>et al</italic>., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">El Hage and Alix, 2004</xref>), suggesting that <italic>E. coli</italic> ribosome biogenesis is robust and that there are possibly redundant pathways. This would allow the cell to compensate for loss of specific assembly factors and thus increase the overall likelihood of survival.</p><p>Many factors implicated in ribosome biogenesis are also involved in multiple cellular functions. The <italic>E. coli</italic> DEAD-box proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b54">Silverman <italic>et al</italic>., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">Iost and Dreyfus, 2006</xref>) which have been shown to participate in ribosome biogenesis (CsdA, SrmB) also participate in mRNA processing and decay as well as in translation initiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">Iost and Dreyfus, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">Lu <italic>et al</italic>., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b51">Prud'homme-Genereux <italic>et al</italic>., 2004</xref>). Similarly, Era, which is one of the most-studied bacterial GTPases, has roles in cell cycle and cell division (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">Gollop and March, 1991</xref>), RNA binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">Johnstone <italic>et al</italic>., 1999</xref>) and is involved in carbon and nitrogen metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">Lerner and Inouye, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b50">Powell <italic>et al</italic>., 1995</xref>). Likewise, RimJ can act as a negative repressor of pyelonephritis-associated pili (Pap) expression in uropathogenic <italic>E. coli</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b61">White-Ziegler and Low, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b62">White-Ziegler <italic>et al</italic>., 2002</xref>). Thus, it may play an important role in adapting uropathogenic bacteria to changing environments. However, it is unknown if acetylation of S5 might be involved in downregulating <italic>papBA</italic> transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b62">White-Ziegler <italic>et al</italic>., 2002</xref>) or similar to suppression of S5(G28D)-associated phenotypes if this role is also independent of acetyltransferase activity. The mechanism by which RimJ acts in cellular processes outside of acetylation will be interesting to dissect. Other than a few N- and C-terminal amino acids in RimJ (194 residues), the remaining 171 amino acids form the NAT domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig04">Fig. 4A</xref>, ExPASy-PROSITE search). There is no obvious or readily discernible functional domain, other than the acetyltransferase, in RimJ and thus it is not clear how RimJ facilitates these additional processes. Given the level of homology with other NATs (see above) it is likely that acetylation of S5 was the initial function of RimJ. Once RimJ had been recruited to the biogenesis cascade, the second biogenesis role identified herein may have evolved. This would allow <italic>E. coli</italic> to make optimal use of its somewhat limited genome and thereby allow optimization of ribosome biogenesis.</p><p>How is RimJ related to ribosome biogenesis? It has been shown that unacetylated S5 binds to the assembling RNP at a faster rate than acetylated S5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b55">Talkington <italic>et al</italic>., 2005</xref>), suggesting that acetylation of S5 could occur once S5 has associated with the 16S rRNA-containing RNP. This association could then augment subsequent changes or preclude some non-productive interactions and thus aid in the assembly process. RimJ might bind to the assembling 30S subunits through or adjacent to S5. We show that RimJ associates with assembling 30S subunits devoid of S3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig05">Fig. 5</xref> and data not shown) <italic>in vivo</italic>. This is of particular interest as S4 is a primary binding protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">Grondek and Culver, 2004</xref>) to 16S rRNA in the assembly pathway of 30S subunits (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig05">Fig. 5D</xref>). S3 binds much later in the hierarchical order of binding of small subunit proteins. Additionally, our previous work demonstrated that S5(G28D) did not greatly alter S3 association (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">Kirthi <italic>et al</italic>., 2006</xref>). This might indicate the binding of RimJ at an intermediate step of 30S subunit maturation and suggest that acetylation of S5 and the additional function of RimJ could be occurring at the same stage of ribosome biogenesis.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Experimental procedures</title><sec><title>Strains</title><p>Strains S5(G28D), &#x00394;<italic>lacZ</italic> S5(G28D), JW1053 and CWZ387 have been described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b62">White-Ziegler <italic>et al</italic>., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">Baba <italic>et al</italic>., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">Kirthi <italic>et al</italic>., 2006</xref>).

Ten-fold serial dilutions were made using fresh LB and plated on LB plates plus appropriate antibiotics and 0.2% arabinose, when required. Plates were incubated at 37&#x000b0;C overnight or at the non-permissive temperature for at least 48 h.</p></sec><sec><title>Ribosome analysis</title><p>For analysis of ribosome profiles, cell growth was carried out as done for estimation of doubling times (mentioned above). Ribosome analysis was essentially carried out as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">Maki <italic>et al</italic>., 2002</xref>). The ribosomes were analysed by sucrose gradient sedimentation using 10&#x02013;40% sucrose gradients in polysome buffer [20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.8), 10 mM magnesium chloride and 100 mM ammonium chloride] in a SW41 rotor (25 000 r.p.m.) for 17 h at 4&#x000b0;C. The speed and time were optimized to enable a better separation of the 30S and the pre-30S peak, therefore not allowing polysomes to be readily observed.</p><p>To localize RimJ in the ribosome profiles, fractions of 1 ml were collected across the profiles of S5(G28D) with p-<italic>rimJ</italic> induced at the non-permissive temperature. Slot-blot analysis using a V5 antibody (against recombinant RimJ) was performed with amounts of RNA (OD measured at 260 nm) equalized. 16S rRNA and 23S rRNA were used as markers for 30S and 50S subunits, respectively, and analysed by agarose gel electrophoresis.</p></sec><sec><title>Cloning and expression of <italic>rimJ</italic></title><p>The <italic>rimJ</italic> gene was PCR amplified from <italic>E. coli</italic> (CSH142) genomic DNA using the primers: 5&#x02032;-CAGGCTATTCATATGTTTGGCTATCGCAGTAACGTG-3&#x02032; and 5&#x02032;-TCCGCGGCTGAATTCTTAGCGGCCGGGCGTCCA-3&#x02032;.</p><p>It was ultimately inserted into the pBAD-DEST49 vector by GATEWAY technology (Invitrogen).

For the CWZ387 strain in the presence of pBAD, p-<italic>rimJ</italic> or p-<italic>rimJ</italic>(C54A, C105A), growth was carried out at 37&#x000b0;C. MALDI and ESI samples were prepared by adding two volumes of 1 M magnesium acetate and glacial acetic acid mixture (1:20, v/v) to the 30S subunits and the extracted r-proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">Nierhaus, 1990</xref>) were desalted.

Cleared extracts containing &#x0223c;3 mg ml<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> total protein were incubated with Ni-NTA Agarose beads (Qiagen) for 3 h at 4&#x000b0;C. After washing six or more times with B-150 or twice with 50 mM imidazole, bound complexes were analysed for 16S rRNA or 23S rRNA by primer extension or by Western blotting using either S3, S4 or V5 (against recombinant RimJ) antibodies.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank members of our lab for critical reviewing and helpful discussions.
