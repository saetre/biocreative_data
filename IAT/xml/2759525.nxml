The ABC transporters can significantly decrease the intracellular concentration of antineoplastic drugs by increasing their efflux, thereby lowering the cytotoxic activity of antineoplastic drugs. One of these transporters, the multiple resistant protein 7 (MRP7, ABCC10), has recently been shown to produce resistance to antineoplastic drugs by increasing the efflux of paclitaxel. In this study, we examined the effects of BCR-Abl tyrosine kinase inhibitors imatinib, nilotinib and dasatinib on the activity and expression of MRP7 in HEK293 cells transfected with MRP7, designated HEK-MRP7-2.</p></sec><sec><title>Methodology and/or Principal Findings</title><p>We report for the first time that imatinib and nilotinib reversed MRP7-mediated multidrug resistance. Our MTT assay results indicated that MRP7 expression in HEK-MRP7-2 cells was not significantly altered by incubation with 5 &#x000b5;M of imatinib or nilotinib for up to 72 hours. In addition, imatinib and nilotinib (1-5 &#x000b5;M) produced a significant concentration-dependent reversal of MRP7-mediated multidrug resistance by enhancing the sensitivity of HEK-MRP7-2 cells to paclitaxel and vincristine. Imatinib and nilotinib, at 5 &#x000b5;M, significantly increased the accumulation of &#x0005b;<sup>3</sup>H&#x0005d;-paclitaxel in HEK-MRP7-2 cells. The incubation of the HEK-MRP7-2 cells with imatinib or nilotinib (5 &#x000b5;M) also significantly inhibited the efflux of paclitaxel.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>Imatinib and nilotinib reverse MRP7-mediated paclitaxel resistance, most likely due to their inhibition of the efflux of paclitaxel via MRP7.

The efficacy of chemotherapy can be limited due to acquired resistance from previous treatment. Consequently, research strategies to circumvent such resistance in cancer cells have become a current focus for the development of novel combinational chemotherapeutic strategies.

Therefore, cancer patients that receive multiple treatments can become increasingly insensitive to chemotherapeutic agents.</p><p>One of the primary cellular mechanisms that can produce resistance to antineoplastic therapy involves the efflux of drugs from the cancer cells by specific transmembrane transporters or pumps <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007520-Deeley1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>.

Consequently, it is possible that TKIs, in combination with other antineoplastic drugs, may be useful in the treatment of cancers that express MDR proteins, including the ABC transporters. An important discovery about TKIs was that certain so-called &#x0201c;small molecule&#x0201d; drugs could inhibit TK activity by competing with ATP for binding to the intracellular catalytic domain of receptor TKs, which produced inhibition of various downstream signaling cascades by autophosphorylation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007520-Mendelsohn1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>.

The IC<sub>50</sub> of paclitaxel in HEK-MRP7-2 cells co-cultured with 2.5 &#x000b5;M of nilotinib was significantly decreased from 207.0&#x000b1;19.7 nM to 15.9&#x000b1;0.9 nM, and this was significantly lower than that of paclitaxel in the control group (21.9&#x000b1;1.9 nM). The resistance to paclitaxel was completely reversed when imatinib was co-incubated with paclitaxel in HEK-MRP7-2 cells. A significantly greater reversal was obtained at the 5 &#x000b5;M (12.4-fold) compared to the 1 &#x000b5;M (4.7-fold) concentration. Imatinib, at 5 &#x000b5;M, also increased the sensitivity of cells to paclitaxel in HEK293-pcDNA3.1 cells by 2.2-fold, although this effect in HEK293-pcDNA3.1 was significantly lower than that in the MRP7 transfected cells (12.5-fold) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0007520-t001">Table 1</xref>). These results indicated that the BCR-Abl TKIs imatinib and nilotinib significantly attenuated the resistance to paclitaxel mediated by MRP7. Although the co-incubation of HEK293-pcDNA3.1 (control cells) with nilotinib and paclitaxel also enhanced the sensitivity to paclitaxel (a 2.5-fold shift in HEK293-pcDNA3.1 cells), this enhanced sensitivity was significantly lower than that determined for the MRP7 transfected cells (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0007520-t001">Table 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007520-g003">Fig. 3C</xref>). In contrast, another BCR-Abl TKI, dasatinib at 2.5 &#x000b5;M, did not significantly enhance paclitaxel sensitivity in either HEK293-pcDNA3.1 or HEK-MRP7-2 cells (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0007520-t001">Table 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007520-g003">Fig. 3C</xref>).</p><fig id="pone-0007520-g003" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0007520.g003</object-id><label>Figure 3</label><caption><title>The effect of imatinib (A), nilotinib (B) and dasatinib (C) on the sensitivity of MRP7-transfected HEK293 cells to paclitaxel.</title><p>Two cell lines, HEK293-pcDNA3.1 and HEK-MRP7-2, are represented as HEK293 and MRP7, respectively.

Similar to the findings with paclitaxel, nilotinib and imatinib (1, 2.5 and 5 &#x000b5;M) significantly reversed MRP7-mediated vincristine resistance (2.1-, 6.8- and 9.0-fold, respectively, for nilotinib; 2.4-, 6.9- and 8.2-fold, respectively, for imatinib) in a concentration-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0007520-t001">Table 1</xref>). We also examined the response of MRP7-transfected cells to another anticancer drug, doxorubicin, in the presence of imatinib, as doxorubicin is not a substrate of MRP7 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007520-Dean1">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref>.

This indicates that the response to these TKIs was specific for MRP7, as doxorubicin is not a substrate for MRP7 and thus would not mediate doxorubicin efflux. Doxorubicin is a substrate of P-gp, MRP1 and BCRP, but neither imatinib nor nilotinib significantly increased doxorubicin sensitivity of HEK-MRP7-2 cells, suggesting that P-gp, MRP and BCRP do not significantly contribute to the drug resistance of HEK-MRP7-2.</p><p>Overall, imatinib and nilotinib significantly reversed MRP7-mediated resistance to paclitaxel and vincristine, but not doxorubicin.

Therefore, the next experiment was conducted to determine if the increase in paclitaxel accumulation produced by imatinib and nilotinib was due to an inhibition of paclitaxel efflux. HEK-MRP7-2 cells and HEK293-pcDNA3.1 cells were incubated with paclitaxel and a time course for intracellular drug accumulation was determined (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007520-g005">Fig. 5</xref>). As expected, HEK-MRP7-2 cells released a significantly higher percentage of accumulated paclitaxel compared to HEK293-pcDNA3.1 cells, and the amount of paclitaxel that was effluxed increased with time. The paclitaxel accumulation at 0 min of drug efflux was set as 1. At 60 min, in cells incubated in drug-free medium, &#x0223c;60&#x00025; of the accumulated paclitaxel was exported from HEK-MRP7-2 cells in the absence of imatinib or nilotinib. In contrast, almost all of the paclitaxel was present inside the HEK-MRP7-2 cells incubated with imatinib or nilotinib at a final concentration of 5 &#x000b5;M over different time periods. For the control cells, the concentration of paclitaxel subjected to efflux also increased with time, but the level of efflux was only slightly less than that observed in cells transfected with MRP7. In contrast, in the HE293-pcDNA3.1 cells, &#x0223c;30&#x00025; of the paclitaxel was released after 60 min in the absence of the test compounds. The incubation of the HEK293-pcDNA3.1 cells with imatinib or nilotinib (5 &#x000b5;M) also inhibited the efflux of paclitaxel, although the magnitude of the effect was significantly lower than that observed for the HEK-MRP7-2 cells.</p><fig id="pone-0007520-g005" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0007520.g005</object-id><label>Figure 5</label><caption><title>The effect of imatinib (A) or nilotinib (B) on the paclitaxel efflux in HEK293-pcDNA3.1 and HEK-MRP7-2 cells.</title><p>The percentage of the paclitaxel released was plotted as a function of time.

These transfected cell lines have previously been used in studies designed to determine the effects of cepharanthine on the reversal of MRP7-mediated resistance to paclitaxel <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007520-Zhou1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>. In this study, Western blot analysis confirmed that the transfection of cells with MRP7 was successful, as MRP7 proteins were expressed only in HEK-MRP7-2 cells, and not in HEK293-pcDNA3.1 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007520-g002">Fig. 2</xref>). The cell lines were exposed to the exact same experimental conditions and procedures, and were cultured with the same antineoplastic drugs for the same incubation time. It may be argued that the MRP7-transfected cells expressed other proteins, in addition to MRP7, such as P-gp, that may have contributed to MDR. However, Western blot analysis indicated that neither the HEK293-pcDNA3.1 control cell line, nor the HEK-MRP7-2 transfected cell line, expressed detectable levels of P-gp (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007520-g002">Fig. 2</xref>), which can also mediate MDR. In addition, MRP1 and BCRP were undetectable in both control HEK293-pcDNA3.1 and transfected HEK-MRP7-2 cells through Western blot analysis (data not shown). Therefore, these results indicate that the HEK-MRP7-2 transfected cell line specifically expressed MRP7, but not P-gp, MRP, or BCRP.</p><p>Previously, it has been reported that cepharanthine and nilotinib significantly reversed P-gp-mediated MDR in HEK-MRP7-2 cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007520-Zhou1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref> and BCRP-overexpressing cell lines <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007520-Couture1">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref>, respectively. Since MRP7 and P-gp are similar in structure and functional activity, we designed experiments to determine if nilotinib could reverse MRP7-mediated drug resistance to paclitaxel. Owing to the structural similarity between MRP7 and P-gp, an earlier study indicated that some P-gp inhibitors were able to significantly reverse paclitaxel resistance in HEK-MRP7-2 cells overexpressing MRP7 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007520-Zhou1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>. We found that nilotinib (2.5 &#x000b5;M) significantly sensitized MRP7-transfected HEK293 cells to paclitaxel as it markedly decreased the IC<sub>50</sub> of paclitaxel in MRP7-trasnfected cells, compared to control cells. Although nilotinib is an inhibitor of P-gp <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007520-Couture1">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref>, this is not a confounding factor in our experiments as the P-gp protein is not expressed in either HEK293-pcDNA3.1 or HEK-MRP7-2 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007520-g002">Fig. 2</xref>).</p><p>In this study, we found that specific TKIs: 1) significantly decreased resistance to paclitaxel in MRP7-overexpressing cells (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0007520-t001">Table 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007520-g003">Fig. 3</xref>), 2) did significantly sensitize the response to paclitaxel in the empty vector transfected cells, but the effect was significantly lower than that in the MRP7 transfected cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007520-g003">Fig. 3</xref>), and 3) did not significantly inhibit or induce MRP7 expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007520-g002">Fig. 2C and D</xref>). Overall, these findings tentatively suggest that of the TKIs used in this study, imatinib and nilotinib are capable of reversing MRP7-mediated resistance by inhibiting the function of MRP7. Among the TKIs that were tested against paclitaxel, the BCR-Abl TKIs imatinib and nilotinib at 5 &#x000b5;M completely reversed MRP7-mediated paclitaxel resistance by a magnitude of 12.5- and 21.0-fold, respectively (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0007520-t001">Table 1</xref>). In contrast, another BCR-Abl TKI, dasatinib, produced no significant reversal of MRP7-mediated paclitaxel resistance (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0007520-t001">Table 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007520-g003">Fig. 3C</xref>). Currently, the explanation for the difference between dasatinib compared to nilotinib or imatinib remains to be determined. One potential approach that may yield insight into this issue would be that of structural-activity relationship (SAR). Based on their chemical structures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007520-g001">Fig. 1</xref>), dasatinib lacks a 2-phenylaminopyrimidine ring that is present in the structures of nilotinib and imatinib. It is possible that the absence of this ring in dasatinib could be an important factor that differentiates dasatinib activity from that of either nilotinib or imatinib. Detailed structure-function studies will be required to delineate the SAR for the interaction of these TKIs with MRP7-overexpressing cells. In addition, it was suggested that the HEK293-pcDNA3.1 cells were also sensitized by co-administering nilotinib or imatinib (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0007520-t001">Table 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007520-g005">Fig. 5</xref>). Such sensitization could be due to possible endogenous efflux pumps in the HEK293-pcDNA3.1 cells.</p><p>In order to extend the findings obtained with paclitaxel, we examined the effect of specific TKIs on the response of MRP7-expressing cells to another antineoplastic drug, vincristine, which is a substrate for MRP7 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007520-Dean1">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref>. Our results indicated that both nilotinib and imatinib (2.5 &#x000b5;M) completely reversed MRP7-mediated vincristine resistance by a factor of 6.8- and 6.9-fold, respectively (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0007520-t001">Table 1</xref>). Thus, nilotinib and imatinib can significantly attenuate MRP7-mediated resistance to not only paclitaxel, but also to vincristine. As an additional control, we examined the effect of nilotinib and imatinib on the response of MRP7-transfected cells to doxorubicin, which is not a substrate for MRP7 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007520-Dean1">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref>. The results indicated that neither nilotinib nor imatinib (1, 2.5, and 5 &#x000b5;M) significantly altered the response of cells to doxorubicin (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0007520-t001">Table 1</xref>). This finding suggests that the actions of the TKIs in reversing MRP7-mediated resistance are due to a specific effect on the MRP7 pump.</p><p>It is well established that MRP7, P-gp and MRP1 are all drug efflux pumps responsible for the extracellular transport of a variety of antineoplastic drugs. Consequently, when these pumps are present in the tumor cells concurrently, each of the pumps contributes to the efflux and decrease of intracellular drug concentrations. This latter action ultimately leads to drug levels that are no longer cytotoxic, leading to failure of therapy. For instance, nilotinib has been identified as an inhibitor of P-gp and the BCRP efflux pumps <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007520-Couture1">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref>. In the current study, it has also been identified as a reversal agent for MRP7-mediated resistance to paclitaxel. Our findings, provided that they can be translated to <italic>in vivo</italic> function, suggest that specific TKIs may be useful in treating cancer cells that have become resistant to treatment as a result of MRP7 overexpression. The systemic exposures achieved at the standard recommended doses of both imatinib (steady state C<sub>max</sub>/C<sub>min</sub> 5.2 and 2.5 &#x000b5;M at 400 mg q.d.) and nilotinib (steady state C<sub>max</sub>/C<sub>min</sub> 4.0 and 1.8 &#x000b5;M at 400 mg b.i.d.) are similar to the concentrations that reversed drug resistance in the present study <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007520-Kantarjian1">&#x0005b;25&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007520-Tanaka1">&#x0005b;26&#x0005d;</xref>. Thus, it is possible that TKIs such as those used in this study could be useful chemosensitizing drugs in the clinic for specific patients. Clearly, <italic>in vivo</italic> studies are needed to evaluate the effects of specific TKIs on the resistance of cancer cells to antineoplastic drugs.</p><p>Future experiments, based on the current findings, include the: 1) determination of the effects of newly synthesized TKIs to reverse MRP7-mediated drug resistance, and 2) analysis of the effects of TKIs on the efflux activity of other ABC transporters.</p><p>In summary, the results of this study are the first to indicate that the BCR-Abl TKIs imatinib and nilotinib, but not dasatinib, at concentrations that did not produce cytotoxicity, significantly reversed MRP7-mediated MDR to paclitaxel and vincristine. Furthermore, these TKIs might be inhibitors for multiple MDR efflux pumps, such as P-gp and BCRP for nilotinib <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007520-Bradford1">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref>. In addition, it is likely that imatinib and nilotinib reverse MDR in the HEK293-MRP7 transfected cells by inhibiting the efflux activity of the MRP7 (ABCC10) transporter. Provided these results can be extended to human cancer cells, they suggest that the TKIs could be useful in treating patients that exhibit resistance to paclitaxel or vincristine as a result of MRP7. Therefore, TKIs may be useful modifiers of MDR in cancer cells that overexpress P-gp, BCRP and/or MRP7 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007520-Bradford1">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref>.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank Dr. Gary Kruh (University of Illinois at Chicago, Chicago, IL) for providing HEK293 cells, MRP7 cDNA and his encouragement.
