In pilot experiments we noticed that cadherin-11 expression varied noticeably depending on the number of cells plated. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004797-g001">Figure 1</xref> shows that cells grown at higher cell densities had markedly increased cadherin-11 mRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004797-g001">Figure 1A</xref>) and protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004797-g001">Figure 1B</xref>) expression on a per cell basis compared to those grown at low density. In <italic>Xenopus laevis</italic>, cadherin-11 is regulated by xWnt8, although it is not known if the cadherin-11 gene is a direct transcriptional target or if either the canonical or non-canonical pathways are involved <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004797-Hadeball1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>. To test if the canonical Wnt pathway regulates cadherin-11 in MDA-MB-231 cells, we treated cells with lithium chloride (LiCl), an inhibitor of GSK3&#x003b2;. LiCl treatment repressed cadherin-11 mRNA and protein levels and blocked the effects of increased cell density (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004797-g001">Figure 1A, B</xref>). Cadherin-11 protein levels were also inhibited by LiCl in three other cell-lines (BT549, Hs578t and PC-3 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004797-g001">Figure 1C</xref>). Remarkably, N-cadherin, which is endogenously expressed by these cell-lines and not by MDA-MB-231 cells, was unaffected by LiCl, strongly indicating that inhibition of GSK3&#x003b2; specifically regulated cadherin-11 expression. If the effects of LiCl are due to transient inhibition of GSK3&#x003b2; we anticipated that removal of LiCl should reverse its effects on cadherin 11. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004797-g001">Figure 1D</xref> shows that this is indeed the case as cadherin-11 levels returned to control values 12 hours following LiCl washout. To confirm that the effects of LiCl were related to inhibition of GSK3&#x003b2;, we treated cells with 6-bromoindirubin-3&#x02032;-oxime (BIO), a small molecule kinase inhibitor selective for GSK3&#x003b1;/&#x003b2; (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004797-g001">Figure 1E, F</xref>). Inhibition of GSK3&#x003b2; with BIO stabilized &#x003b2;-catenin, and like LiCl, reduced cadherin-11 mRNA and protein accumulation. Furthermore, siRNA directed against GSK3&#x003b2; mRNA decreased cadherin-11 protein expression in the absence of either LiCl or BIO in MDA-MB-231 but not in PC-3 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004797-g001">Figure 1G</xref>). Therefore, GSK3&#x003b2; knockdown had little effect on cadherin-11 levels in PC-3 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004797-g001">Figure 1G</xref>). Unlike MDA-231 cells, PC-3 cells have high levels of nuclear activated &#x003b2;-catenin as a result of a PTEN mutation and constitutive inactivation of GSK3&#x003b2; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004797-McMenamin1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>.

To test this hypothesis, we carried out RNA polymerase II chromatin immunoprecipitation assays (Pol II ChIP) using cadherin-11 specific primers which amplify a portion of intron 1 (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004797-g002">Figure 2B</xref> shows that, as expected, actinomycin D markedly reduced the amount of Pol II recruited to both GAPDH and the cadherin-11 gene.

As the bone is remodeled, growth factors are released into the matrix further stimulating the tumor cells by creating a fertile environment for growth. These changes are reminiscent of those that occur during rheumatoid arthritis, a disease that is also characterized by an important role for cadherin-11 in the activated synoviocyte <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004797-Kiener1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004797-Lee1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>. Given its role in these important diseases we sought to determine how cadherin-11 expression is regulated. In the present study we show that cadherin-11 mRNA and protein levels are increased by high cell density and are markedly regulated by the activity of the ubiquitous serine/threonine kinase GSK3&#x003b2;.

Growth factors, such as insulin, activate the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt pathway. PI3K converts PIP<sub>2</sub> to PIP<sub>3,</sub> a critical step necessary for the activation of PKB/Akt. PTEN is a phosphatase commonly mutated in cancers that is necessary for the dephosphorylation of PIP<sub>3</sub> thereby inhibiting Akt activation. Once activated Akt acts on many cellular proteins including mTOR, caspase 9, Bad, IKK, and GSK3&#x003b2;. Akt phosphorylates GSK3&#x003b2; on serine 9 and GSK3&#x003b1; on serine 21 to inhibit their kinase activity. Understanding GSK3&#x003b2; regulation by the Akt pathway is important to the present study because a PTEN mutation in PC-3 prostate cancer cells results in activated Akt, GSK3&#x003b2; inhibition, and activation of endogenous &#x003b2;-catenin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004797-Ohigashi1">&#x0005b;28&#x0005d;</xref>.

Although many studies have observed that Wnt-GSK3&#x003b2;-mediated activation of &#x003b2;-catenin results in accumulation of nuclear <underline>and</underline> cytoplasmic &#x003b2;-catenin, most studies concentrate on the function of &#x003b2;-catenin as a transcriptional co-activator of TCF, and more recently nuclear receptors, in the nucleus <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004797-Barker1">&#x0005b;31&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004797-Shah1">&#x0005b;33&#x0005d;</xref>.

Samples were spun at 1000 rpm for 1 minute, then washed once with each: Low Salt Immune Complex Wash Buffer (0.1&#x00025; SDS, 1&#x00025; Triton X-100, 2 mM EDTA, 20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.1, 150 mM NaCl), High Salt Immune Complex Wash Buffer (0.1&#x00025; SDS, 1&#x00025; Triton X-100, 2 mM EDTA, 20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.1, 500 mM NaCl), LiCl Immune Complex Wash Buffer (0.25 M LiCl, 1&#x00025; Nonidet P-40, 1&#x00025; deoxycholic acid, 1 mM EDTA, 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.1), and TE buffer. Samples were eluted twice in 100 &#x003bc;l in elution buffer (1&#x00025; SDS, 0.1 M NaHCO<sub>3</sub>) vortexing for 15 minutes at room temperature. 12 &#x003bc;l 5 M NaCl was added to eluate and incubated at 65&#x000b0;C overnight. Then 4 &#x003bc;l 0.5 M EDTA, 8 &#x003bc;l 1M Tris-HCl, pH 6.5 and 2 &#x003bc;l of 10 mg/ml proteinase K was added and incubated at 45&#x000b0;C for 1 hour. The samples were cleaned up using the QIAGEN PCR Clean up kit (QIAGEN). PCR was performed using TaKaRa Premix Ex Taq kit (RR039, TaKaRa, Otsu, Shiga, Japan). The final reaction contains: 1&#x000d7; Premix Ex Taq, 2.5 &#x003bc;M of each primer, 8&#x00025; DMSO, and 20&#x00025; processed DNA (or 20&#x00025; of a 1:10 dilution of input).

Cell lysates were boiled for 10 minutes. Protein concentration was determined with a Bio-Rad DC Protein Assay (500-0116, Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA). After SDS-poly acrylamide gel electrophoresis, proteins were transferred to Protran BA 83 Nitrocellulose (10402495, Germany). Membranes were blocked with 5&#x00025; milk in Tris-Buffered Saline containing 0.1&#x00025; Tween-20, and incubated with primary antibody overnight at 4&#x000b0;C and subsequently with HRP-labeled secondary antibody. Proteins were visualized with ECL chemiluminescent reagents (RPN2106, Amersham Biosciences, Piscataway, NJ) or SuperSignal West Femto (34095, Pierce biotechnology Inc., Rockford, IL) using X-ray films (Denville Scientific Inc., Metuchen, NJ).</p></sec><sec id="s4h"><title>Luciferase Assay Analysis</title><p>Cells were plated at 2&#x000d7;10<sup>5</sup> in a 12-well plate in growth medium.

Cells treated with meBIO or BIO (1 &#x003bc;M) were transfected in triplicate using Fugene6 (Roche). 24 hours after transfection, cells were treated with either BIO or meBIO. 48 hours after treatment cells were collected. In all cases, cells were lysed using passive lysis buffer provided with the Dual-<italic>Luciferase</italic> Reporter Assay System (Promega). 20 &#x003bc;l of each sample was loaded in duplicate in a 96-well plate and analyzed using the Dual-<italic>Luciferase</italic> Reporter Assay System reagents (E1960, Promega).
