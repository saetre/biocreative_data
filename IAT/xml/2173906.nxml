Excess osteoclastic activity leading to focal bone loss is a common feature of human cancer, notably multiple myeloma (MM) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Two factors supplied by osteoblast lineage cells are of critical importance for osteoclastogenesis: macrophage-colony stimulating factor (M-CSF)<sup>1 </sup>and receptor activator of NF-&#x003ba;B ligand (RANKL) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. M-CSF is required for proliferation and survival of osteoclast precursors, while RANKL is critical for precursor differentiation into mature, multinucleated osteoclasts. In addition to these positive regulators, osteoblast lineage cells produce the major inhibitor of osteoclast differentiation, osteoprotegerin (OPG) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Upon secretion into the extracellular milieu, OPG acts as a decoy receptor for RANKL, blocking the various signaling cascades activated by binding of RANKL to its receptor on pre-osteoclasts, RANK [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Altered expression of M-CSF, RANKL and OPG in osteoprogenitors may facilitate cancer-associated osteolytic disease by promoting osteoblast-dependent osteoclastogenesis.</p><p>Homeostatic bone remodeling requires coordinated integration of biological signals from numerous cellular signal transduction pathways including Wnt/&#x003b2;-catenin signaling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. Wnt/&#x003b2;-catenin promotes new bone formation by functioning as a positive regulator of osteoblasts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>] and, by up-regulating OPG [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>] and down-regulating RANKL [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>] on osteoprogenitors, negative regulator of osteoblast-dependent osteoclastogenesis. Wnt/&#x003b2;-catenin signaling in the osteoblast lineage is activated by binding of canonical Wnt ligands, such as Wnt3a, to a membrane-bound receptor complex that consists of Frizzled and low-density-lipoprotein receptor-related protein 5/6 (LRP5/6). Canonical Wnt ligands inhibit the degradation of &#x003b2;-catenin in the cytoplasm, leading to translocation of &#x003b2;-catenin to the cell nucleus where it cooperates with transcription factors of the T-cell factor/lymphoid enhancer factor family in regulating target gene expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. In human beings, diminished and elevated Wnt/&#x003b2;-catenin signaling due to loss-of-function and gain-of-function mutations in LRP5 lead to osteoporosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>] and osteopetrosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>], respectively. Both phenotypes were accurately recapitulated in transgenic mouse models of LRP function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>], providing further evidence of Wnt/&#x003b2;-catenin's anabolic role in the bone.</p><p>Abnormal levels of secreted antagonists of Wnt signaling have been shown to shift bone remodeling in both directions. One class of Wnt inhibitors that blocks Wnt ligand binding to Frizzled includes secreted frizzled-related proteins (sFrps), which block both the canonical (&#x003b2;-catenin dependent) and the various non-canonical (&#x003b2;-catenin independent) Wnt pathways [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. Mice deficient in sFrp1 exhibit high bone mass [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>], whereas over-expression of sFrp2 has been implicated in the development of osteolytic lesions in MM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. Another class of Wnt inhibitors including Dickkopf (Dkk) proteins bind to LRP5/6 and Kremen1/2. This leads to suppression of canonical Wnt signaling but spares the non-canonical pathways [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. Mice containing one wild type and one null allele of <italic>Dkk1 </italic>exhibit increased bone mass [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>], whereas over-expression of DKK1 has been associated with osteolytic metastatic bone disease in prostate carcinoma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>] and MM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. These findings illustrate the significance of secreted Wnt inhibitors to bone health.</p><p>Secreted bone morphogenic proteins (BMPs), such as BMP2, are members of the transforming growth factor &#x003b2; (TGF-&#x003b2;) superfamily that can induce new bone formation <italic>in vivo </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. BMP2 signaling begins with binding to serine/threonine kinase receptors on the cell surface, continues with phosphorylation of so-called restricted Smads forming complexes with common Smad in the cytoplasm, and culminates in the transcriptional activation of specific target genes in the nucleus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. Among the BMP2-induced genes important for osteoblast development is the zinc finger transcription factor, Osterix [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. Upstream of Osterix is the transcription factor Cbfa1, a crucial determinant of the commitment of mesenchymal stem cells to undergo osteoprogenitor differentiation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. Farther upstream in this pathway is the cell cycle checkpoint protein and tumor suppressor, p53 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. Osteoblasts deficient in p53 exhibit enhanced ability to promote osteoblast-dependent osteoclastogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. Noggin prevents BMP2 receptor binding [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>], providing a tool to interrupt the BMP-p53-Cbfa1-Osterix axis in the osteoblast lineage.</p><p>Cross talk of Wnt/&#x003b2;-catenin and BMP signaling is known to play a role in the regulation of osteoblast differentiation and function, but the molecular mechanism by which Wnt/&#x003b2;-catenin influences BMP-induced osteoblastogenesis and, by inference, osteoblast-dependent osteoclastogenesis, is poorly defined. Here we used mesenchymal stem cells undergoing differentiation into osteoprogenitors <italic>in vitro </italic>to evaluate the mechanism by which Wnt3a/&#x003b2;-catenin modulates BMP2-driven pre-osteoblasts. Taking advantage of Wnt inhibitors from the Dickkopf family and the BMP inhibitor, Noggin, we demonstrated that inhibition of Wnt3a/&#x003b2;-catenin by Dkk-1 and -2 promotes certain aspects of osteoblast development through the BMP2-p53-Osterix axis. The concomitant up-regulation of M-CSF/RANKL and down-regulation of OPG indicated, however, that Dkk-1 and -2 also have the potential to promote osteoclastogenesis. The latter view is in line with a large body of clinical evidence on neoplasms constitutively expressing Dkk1 (MM, prostate carcinoma), showing that, on balance, this canonical Wnt inhibitor facilitates bone loss (osteolysis) <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Dkk1 and -2 produced by mouse plasmacytoma cells reduce &#x003b2;-catenin in L indicator cells</title><p>To evaluate the role of mouse Dkk proteins in cancer-associated focal bone lesions in mice, we generated four different sublines of mouse plasmacytoma MOPC315.4 that stably expressed Dkk1, -2, -3 or -4. Tumor cells were transfected with retrovirus that contained a bi-cistronic expression vector encoding one of the Dkk proteins in conjunction with the reporter, enhanced GFP. The reporter was used for enriching GFP-expressing cells by flow sorting, which increased, in the case of Dkk1, the fraction of GFP<sup>+ </sup>cells from 70% to 90%. Similar enrichments were achieved with Dkk2, -3 and -4. All four Dkk proteins were readily detected by Western blotting of lysates of GFP<sup>+ </sup>tumor cells using either Ab to the FLAG epitope (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref> top) or specific Ab to Dkk1, -2, -3 or -4 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref> center).

All four Dkk's were readily detected by antibody to the His<sub>6 </sub>tag (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref> top), FLAG (results not shown) or specific epitopes on the Dkk1, -2, -3 or -4 proteins (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref> bottom). MOPC315.4 cells left untreated or transfected with retrovirus expressing only GFP did not secrete Dickkopf protein (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>, lanes labeled Parental and Control, respectively). Just like human DKK secreted by transient 293T human embryonic kidney cell transfectants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>], the secreted mouse Dkk proteins appeared to undergo post-translational modification including proteolytic cleavage and glycosylation, which produced distinct, highly reproducible bands on the immunoblots (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref> and data not shown).</p><p>To investigate whether the secreted Dkk proteins functioned as inhibitors of Wnt/&#x003b2;-catenin signaling, we performed the &#x003b2;-catenin stabilization assay in L cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. Stimulation of L cells with Wnt3a-CM (obtained from Wnt3a-transfected L cells) resulted in a marked increase of &#x003b2;-catenin compared to L cells stimulated with L-CM (obtained from mock-transfected L cells), as shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C</xref> (compare lanes 3&#x02013;4 with lanes 1&#x02013;2). The Wnt3a-dependent accumulation of &#x003b2;-catenin was reduced in cells treated with Dkk1- or Dkk2-CM (obtained from transfected MOPC315.4 cells) in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1D</xref>). Dkk3-CM was ineffective, as expected, whereas Dkk4-CM, which was marginally effective in some experiments described below, was also ineffective in these experiments (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1D</xref>). These results clearly demonstrated that Dkk1 and -2 secreted by mouse plasmacytoma cells functioned as canonical Wnt/&#x003b2;-catenin inhibitor.</p></sec><sec><title>Dkk1 and -2 inhibit Wnt3a-induced expression of ALP and osteocalcin (OCN)</title><p>To investigate the role of Dkk proteins in Wnt-induced osteoblast differentiation <italic>in vitro</italic>, we took advantage of cell lines C3H10T1/2 and C2C12. The former is a mouse mesenchymal stem cell with differentiation potential along several lineages including osteoprogenitors. The latter is a primitive mouse myoblast that can undergo differentiation to preosteoblast-like cells. In both cell lines, osteoblastic differentiation can be monitored by expression of ALP and OCN, two representatives of early and late markers of osteoblast differentiation, respectively. Treatment with Wnt3a led to a 5-fold increase in ALP activity in C3H10T1/2 cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref> right, top bar), confirming a previous result under similar conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>].

Unlike C2C12 cells, treatment of C3H10T1/2 cells with Dkk4 led to a small but highly significant decrease in ALP. This indicated that Dkk4 sometimes exhibited Wnt-inhibiting activity, as mentioned above. Dkk3 was ineffective in both cell lines, as expected (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>). The ALP-inhibiting effect of Dkk1 and -2 was confirmed at the level of gene transcription using real-time RT-PCR (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>). Just as in case of ALP protein, Dkk1 was a potent inhibitor in both cell lines, whereas Dkk2's inhibitory activity was more convincing in C2C12 than in C3H10T1/2 cells. In contrast to Dkk3 and -4 (results not shown), Dkk1 and -2 inhibited the Wnt3a-dependent induction of OCN mRNA (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2C</xref>), with Dkk2 being once again more potent in C2C12 than C3H10T1/2 cells. These quantitative differences aside, the results suggested that Dkk1 and -2 inhibit Wnt/&#x003b2;-catenin-dependent osteoblast differentiation.</p></sec><sec><title>Dkk1 and -2 enhance BMP2-induced ALP expression</title><p>The developmental cues emanating from BMP signaling must be integrated with inputs from Wnt and other signal transduction pathways to properly orchestrate the network of transcription factors that govern osteoblast differentiation. Based on this consideration, we assessed osteoblastogenesis under conditions of ongoing BMP or Wnt/BMP signaling further modulated by the BMP inhibitor, Noggin, and the Wnt inhibitor, Dickkopf. Similar to previous reports on BMP2-induced differentiation of preosteoblasts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>], treatment of C2C12 cells with BMP2 led to a substantial induction of ALP protein (~150-fold, Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref> left, top bar) and ALP mRNA (~6000-fold, Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref> right, top bar). This response was abrogated by Noggin (2<sup>nd </sup>bar from bottom), indicating that ALP induction was dependent on BMP signaling. Surprisingly, we also found that in BMP2-stimulated cells, addition of Wnt3a resulted in a significant down-regulation of ALP (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>, 2<sup>nd </sup>bar from top), even though Wnt3a weakly induced ALP in absence of BMP2 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>). Treatment of BMP2-stimulated C2C12 cells with Dkk1 led to a more than two-fold increase in ALP protein (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref> left, 3<sup>rd </sup>bar from top), not a decrease as reported elsewhere [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. The increase was blunted by Wnt3a (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref> left, 4th bar), indicating that the Dkk1 effect was indeed dependent upon Wnt signaling, not caused by some unrelated property of this inhibitor. Dkk2 shared the above-described activities of Dkk1, while Dkk3 and -4 were ineffective (data not shown). These results indicated that in BMP2-stimulated osteoprogenitors the Wnt3a-dependent inhibition of ALP is partially abrogated by Dkk1 and -2.</p><fig position="float" id="F3"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p><bold>Wnt3a inhibits ALP and Osterix, but restores p53, in BMP2-stimulated C2C12 cells</bold>. <italic>A</italic>, Wnt3a diminishes BMP2-dependent expression of ALP.

Using real-time RT-PCR, we found that BMP2 caused but a modest (2-fold) increase in Cbfa1 mRNA (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref> left, top bar), yet a substantial (~60-fold) elevation in Osterix mRNAs (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref> right, top bar). ATF4 message was unchanged (data not shown). The induction of the Cbfa1 and Osterix genes was inhibited by Noggin (2<sup>nd </sup>bar from bottom), indicating that the transcriptional activation relied on BMP2 signaling.

We therefore speculated that the BMP2- or Wnt3a-dependent up- or down-regulation of Osterix may be accompanied by corresponding changes in p53 levels: decrease of p53 in case of BMP2 treatment and increase of p53 in case of treatment with Wnt3a. To evaluate this, we determined p53 in C2C12 cells using Western blotting. Lysate from untreated cells contained levels of p53 that were markedly reduced upon treatment with BMP2 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3C</xref>, lanes 1 and 2). Treatment of cells with Wnt3a, which left the p53 baseline essentially unaffected (lane 3), restored p53 to near baseline levels in the presence of BMP2 (lane 4). Addition of Dkk1 or -2 did not alter the levels of p53 in Wnt3a-stimulated cells (compare lanes 7 and 11 with lane 3), but slightly attenuated the Wnt3a-dependent restoration of p53 under conditions of ongoing BMP2 signaling (compare lanes 8 and 12 with lane 4). Since p53 is a positive regulator of p21 expression, we next examined whether the BMP2-dependent loss of p53 was associated with the reduction of p21. Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3C</xref> (center) shows that this was the case. In fact, the changes of p21 closely matched those of p53 regardless of the specific treatment condition. These findings suggested that Wnt/&#x003b2;-catenin signaling by itself is not important for the regulation of p53/p21 in preosteoblasts. However, in cells undergoing BMP2 signaling, the Wnt/&#x003b2;-catenin pathway functions as a strong antagonist of the BMP-mediated suppression of p53.</p></sec><sec><title>Dkk1 and -2 inhibit Wnt3a-induced OPG production</title><p>Wnt3a/&#x003b2;-catenin signaling has been reported to induce OPG transcription in C3H10T1/2 cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>], but this has not yet been extended to C2C12 cells, and the influence of Dkk proteins and ongoing BMP2 signaling on OPG expression are also unknown in both cell types.

This induction was abrogated by Dkk1 (3<sup>rd </sup>bar) and strongly inhibited by Dkk2 (4<sup>th </sup>bar). Dkk3 and -4 were ineffective (not shown). Similar findings were obtained with C3H10T1/2 cells (not shown). To further validate these results, we used ELISA to measure the amount of OPG protein secreted into the cell culture supernatant. There was a good match of OPG message and protein (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B</xref>) for all four treatment conditions. The same result was obtained with C3H10T1/2 cells (not shown).

The underlying mechanism appears to involve at least two aspects of Dickkopf biology. The first concerns the restoration of the Wnt/&#x003b2;-catenin-induced reduction of M-CSF in BMP2-stimulated osteoprogenitors. The second involves the ability of Dkk1 and -2 to mitigate the Wnt/&#x003b2;-catenin-dependent down-regulation of RANKL (observed in 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D<sub>3</sub>-stimulated osteoprogenitors) and the concomitant up-regulation of its inhibitor, OPG (seen in BMP2-induced osteoprogenitors). We postulate that the resultant changes in M-CSF/c-Fms and RANKL-RANK signaling enhance osteoclast development <italic>in vivo</italic>; i.e., the differentiation of monocytic precursors via pre-osteoclasts to mature, activated osteoclasts. The Dkk1- and -2-dependent changes in M-CSF, RANKL and OPG expression, and the somewhat unexpected ability of Dkk1 and -2 to promote rather than inhibit certain aspects of osteoblastogenesis, will be discussed in greater depth in the following.</p><p>Our finding that Dkk1 and -2 abolished the Wnt3a-dependent down regulation of ALP message and protein in otherwise untreated (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>) or BMP2-stimulated C2C12 and C3H10T1/2 cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>) indicated that Wnt3a inhibits certain aspects of osteoprogenitor differentiation <italic>in vitro</italic>. The mitigating effects of Wnt3a in BMP2-induced cells were consistent with results from other investigators indicating extensive crosstalk of the Wnt/&#x003b2;-catenin and BMP signaling pathways in pre-osteoblasts. Pertinent observations include the activation of Wnt/&#x003b2;-catenin by BMP2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>]; inhibition of BMP2-induced ALP by Dkk1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>]; conversely, enhancement of BMP2-induced ALP by enforced expression of constitutively active &#x003b2;-catenin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>]; and inhibition of Wnt3a-dependent ALP by Noggin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>]. Recent work with mouse C2C12 and human mesenchymal stem cells showed that TGF-&#x003b2;1 inhibits BMP2-induced ALP in a manner that involves the translocation of &#x003b2;-catenin to the cell nucleus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>]. This has connected TGF-&#x003b2; signaling with the BMP and Wnt/&#x003b2;-catenin pathways. Our findings are also in agreement with the notion that Wnt/&#x003b2;-catenin inhibits BMP2-dependent osteoprogenitor development by a mechanism that relies on the nuclear translocation of&#x003b2;-catenin, although this has not yet been formally demonstrated.</p><p>Our observation that Wnt3a blocked the BMP2-induced expression of Osterix [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>] raised questions about the mechanism by which Wnt/&#x003b2;-catenin suppresses BMP-dependent osteoblast differentiation. We showed, for the first time, that the expression of p53, a negative regulator of Osterix [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>], is down regulated by BMP2. Furthermore, Wnt3a was able to restore the BMP2-dependent loss of p53. These results supported the model that BMP2-dependent osteoblast differentiation is controlled in large measure by the p53-Cbfa1-Osterix-ALP axis (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7A</xref>). Apparently, this axis is down modulated by crosstalk with the Wnt/&#x003b2;-catenin pathway, the precise molecular mechanism of which remains to be elucidated. An important implication of our hypothetical scheme is that Dkk1 and -2 may promote osteoblast differentiation by virtue of releasing the &#x003b2;-catenin-dependent brake on the BMP-p53-Cbfa1-Osterix-ALP pathway.</p><fig position="float" id="F7"><label>Figure 7</label><caption><p><bold>Hypothetical scheme of the mechanism by which Dkk1 promotes osteolytic lesions <italic>in vivo</italic></bold>. <italic>A</italic>, The cellular differentiation of osteoprogenitors, which can be monitored by Osterix and ALP expression, is governed in part by Wnt3a and BMP2 signaling. BMP2, which is inhibited by Noggin, is a strong inducer of Osterix and ALP, relying on an indirect mechanism that involves p53 and Cbfa1 (not included). Wnt3a/&#x003b2;-catenin signaling, which is antagonized by Dkk1 (and Dkk2), can have opposing effects on osteoblast development depending on BMP2 signaling. In absence of BMP2, Wnt3a weakly promotes osteoblast differentiation through the &#x003b2;-catenin pathway. In presence of BMP2, Wnt3a inhibits osteoblast differentiation by down-regulating the BMP2-p53-Cbaf1-Osterix-ALP axis (thick line). The molecular mechanism of the crosstalk has not yet been elucidated. Our scheme postulates that the Dkk1-dependent inhibition of Wnt3a's positive effect on osteoprogenitors <italic>in vitro </italic>may be outweighed by the abrogation of Wnt3a's negative effect on BMP2 signaling, such that, on balance, Dkk1 enhances features of early osteoblastogenesis. <italic>B</italic>, The differentiation of osteoclasts, which is strictly dependent upon interaction of osteoclast precursors with osteoblasts, is mediated in part by signaling pathways that emanate from the binding of M-CSF and RANKL to c-Fms and RANK, respectively. Osteoblasts stimulated by BMP2 express high levels of M-CSF and RANKL (positive regulators of osteoclastogenesis) but low levels of OPG (negative regulator of osteoclastogenesis), resulting in a positive signal for osteoclast formation. Osteoblasts exposed to Wnt3a exhibit the opposite phenotype with regard to M-CSF, RANKL and OPG expression, resulting in a negative signal for osteoclast formation. Osteoclastogenesis is further dampened by Wnt3a's ability to inhibit BMP2 signaling, as indicated in panel A (thick line). Constitutive expression of Dkk1 (and Dkk2) by bone marrow-homing tumor cells (e.g., multiple myeloma) may enhance osteoclastogenesis <italic>in vivo </italic>by inhibiting Wnt3a, thus shifting the balance of Wnt3a/BMP2 co-signaling in favor of BMP2 signaling. The consequent increase in osteoclastogenesis promotes lytic bone lesions as long as the paracrine supply of Dkk1 by tumor (myeloma) cells is sustained.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1476-4598-6-71-7"/></fig><p>Expression of OPG in osteoblasts, a crucial factor for maintaining normal bone mass, has been reported to be regulated by Wnt/&#x003b2;-catenin signaling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. We confirmed this in three different types of osteoprogenitors (results for MC3T3-E1 cells not shown); demonstrated for the first time that Dkk1 and -2 inhibit the Wnt3a-induced OPG expression at the mRNA and protein level; and further showed that the BMP2-dependent repression of OPG is not affected by Dkk1 or -2 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>). Because osteoblast development <italic>in vivo </italic>is likely to occur in the co-presence of Wnt and BMP ligands, it seemed important to evaluate OPG expression upon co-stimulation of cells with Wnt3a and BMP2. Our results indicated that Wnt signaling predominates over BMP signaling in this regard. The increase in OPG output in Wnt3a-treated cells was abolished by Dkk1 and -2, suggesting that abnormally high levels of Dkk1 or -2 <italic>in situ </italic>reduce the amount of OPG secreted into the extracellular milieu. The resultant promotion of RANKL-dependent osteoclastogenesis may contribute to the development of lytic bone lesions in MM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. In support of this theory, MM patients generally exhibit reduced OPG serum levels compared to healthy individuals, and the number of lytic bone lesions is inversely correlated with OPG [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>].</p><p>Wnt/&#x003b2;-catenin signaling has been reported to attenuate osteoclastogenesis by down modulating the important regulator of bone homeostasis, RANKL [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>], in osteoprogenitors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. We extended this observation to the present C2C12 and C3H10T1/2 cells and the 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D<sub>3</sub>-induced pathway of RANKL activation in these cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>). We further showed, for the first time, that M-CSF was down regulated by Wnt/&#x003b2;-catenin in BMP2-stimulated osteoprogenitors (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>). M-CSF is a positive regulator of Osterix, which, in turn, down regulates p53 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. Our observation that BMP2-regulated p53 levels were inversely correlated with levels of Osterix and M-CSF suggested that, just like ALP, M-CSF is controlled by the BMP-p53-Osterix axis. Additional studies are warranted to validate this hypothesis. Studying the impact of Wnt3a on BMP2- or 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D<sub>3</sub>-dependent expression of RANKL, we noted that Wnt3a markedly diminished the 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D<sub>3</sub>-induced RANKL but did not interfere with the BMP2-induced RANKL.

Considering the activity of Dkk2 and -4, it is interesting to note that only Dkk1 has been implicated thus far in cancer-associated bone lesions. Unlike Dkk2 and -4, Dkk1 binds to Kremen1/2, which leads to rapid endocytosis of the Dkk1-LRP5/6-Kremen1/2 complex [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>]. This raises the possibility that Kremen is a critical co-factor of Dkk1-dependent osteolysis that warrants further investigation.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>The present study further implicates impaired Wnt signaling in the pathogenesis of cancer-associated lytic bone lesions.

To that end, the Dkk1-4-secreting sublines of the mouse plasmacytoma MOPC315 developed here may provide a starting point, as the tumor cells can be readily transplanted into BALB/c mice where they infiltrate the bone marrow (results not shown) and, possibly, cause osteolytic lesions in dependence on Dickkopf expression. Pre-clinical studies of this sort may also facilitate the development of small-drug Dkk inhibitors that may be useful not only for the treatment and prevention of cancer-associated bone loss, but also for treatment of osteoporosis, periodontal disease and bone destruction consequent to rheumatoid arthritis. Success will require further assessment of the molecular properties of the various Dkk's, their specific activities in different target cells, and thorough understanding of the regulatory loops between signaling pathways and cell populations affected by Wnt signaling in bone.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Cell lines and cell culture</title><p>Mouse plasmacytoma MOPC315.4 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>], a generous gift from Dr. B.
