To clarify the mutability, <italic>Acetobacter pasteurianus</italic> NBRC 3283, which forms a multi-phenotype cell complex, was subjected to genome DNA sequencing. The genome analysis revealed that there are more than 280 transposons and five genes with hyper-mutable tandem repeats as common features in the genome consisting of a 2.9-Mb chromosome and six plasmids. There were three single nucleotide mutations and five transposon insertions in 32 isolates from the cell complex. The <italic>A. pasteurianus</italic> hyper-mutability was applied for breeding a temperature-resistant strain grown at an unviable high-temperature (42&#x000b0;C). The genomic DNA sequence of a heritable mutant showing temperature resistance was analyzed by mutation mapping, illustrating that a 92-kb deletion and three single nucleotide mutations occurred in the genome during the adaptation. Alpha-proteobacteria including <italic>A. pasteurianus</italic> consists of many intracellular symbionts and parasites, and their genomes show increased evolution rates and intensive genome reduction. However, <italic>A. pasteurianus</italic> is assumed to be a free-living bacterium, it may have the potentiality to evolve to fit in natural niches of seasonal fruits and flowers with other organisms, such as yeasts and lactic acid bacteria.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Acetic acid bacteria (AAB) is a widely divergent group within the alpha-proteobacteria and are isolated from a variety of natural fields such as fruits, flowers and fermented foods, and are rarely found in soils and insect guts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1 B2 B3">1&#x02013;3</xref>). Recently, one species was identified as a human pathogen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>). Its metabolic uniqueness was also traditionally utilized to generate fermented food, especially vinegar, and also for industrial production of sorbose and dihydroxyacetone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>). AAB plays a crucial role in the quantity, taste, nutrition and hygienic quality of the productions, thus the reliability of strains in terms of functional properties and growth robustness is indispensable. AAB has a noticeable physiological instability and it is reported in at least two different terms of temporal acclimation and heritable adaptation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6 B7 B8 B9">6&#x02013;9</xref>).</p><p><italic>Acetobacter</italic> strains, which are among the most popular AAB for the production of vinegar in many countries, may gradually acquire resistance against higher concentrations of acetic acid when properly adapted to the conditions. However, the rapid loss of the acquired phenotype is observed when the cells are maintained in environments without acetate as a selection pressure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>). This acquisition of acetic acid resistance must be an example of the temporal acclimation or physiologic adaptation, and one reason why new tanks for fermentation are continuously inoculated with AAB from old tanks, but not from a preserved seed AAB in traditional vinegar production.</p><p>Heritable deficiencies in various physiological properties of <italic>Acetobacter</italic> strains, such as ethanol oxidation, acetic acid resistance and bacterial cellulose synthesis, are observed at high frequencies. Very little is known about the genetic background for the instability but phenotypic modifications by transposon insertion were reported in ethanol oxidation and acetic acid resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>), and cellulose formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>). Relatively copious transposons were identified in the genome of AAB strains, such as <italic>Gluconobacter oxydans</italic> 621H (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>) and <italic>Granulibacter bethesdensis</italic> CGDNIH1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>).</p><p>Genomic mutations are fundamental phenomena in the evolution of any organism. Bacteria may be more directly influenced by any mutations because of its minimized genomes or the density of information in its genomes. New information about the genomic structures and mutational events of bacteria have clarified various systems of the genomic mutations, such as a horizontal gene transfer of mobile gene units (e.g. transposon, plasmid and phage), hyper-mutable tandem repeat (HTR), genome-wide rearrangement and genome reduction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>), adding to the well-known mutation systems, such as nucleotide substitution, insertion and deletion and gene duplication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>).</p><p>In a harmful environment, mutations could provide beneficial alleles, but most mutations are likely to be neutral or deleterious, at least slightly, to organisms. Bacterial genomes accumulate mutations at certain rates even in well-fitted environments, and a natural environment causing stresses and stimuli may elevate the mutation rates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>). Therefore, DNA repair and proofreading systems must have evolved to minimize the rates of mutations and natural selection acts on the reliable maintenance and transmission of genome information (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>).</p><p>Genome modulation for survival under certain stressful environments may cause other types of mutation, i.e. genome-wide rearrangement and genome reduction. Under nutrition depleted conditions, genome-wide rearrangements were experimentally observed with a certain frequency in <italic>Salmonella enterica</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>) and <italic>Lactococcus lactis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>), suggesting the existence of a biological system acquired in evolution due to repeatedly facing harmful environments. Extreme genome reduction is mostly observed not only in endosymbionts and obligate intracellular pathogens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20 B21 B22 B23">20&#x02013;23</xref>), but also in a free-living photosynthetic marine bacterium, <italic>Prochlorococcus marinus</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>). The genetic variation of symbiont genomes in comparison to free-living bacteria illustrate a large scale of gene loss that includes genes for regulation of transcription, translation and replication as well as genes for intermediate metabolism and amino acid biosynthesis.</p><p>In association with adaptation to a new niche, unnecessary genes without significant functions may accumulate mutations and may be deleted from the genomes. One explanation for genome reduction was derived from a comparative genome analysis between <italic>Buchnera aphidicola</italic> and <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> that showed large gene deletions by chromosome rearrangements and multiple events of disintegration dispersed over the whole genome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>). However, the mechanism associated with genome reduction or shrinkage is still controversial, with regard to whether a wide deletion may occur as a single event or as an accumulation of smaller deletions. A previous chlamydial genome analysis predicted the replication terminal region within the plasticity zone was involved in genome reduction according to enrichment of species specific, hypothetical and truncated genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>).</p><p>The complete genomic DNA sequences of <italic>Acetobacter pasteurianus</italic>, which has been used for traditional vinegar productions, was herein determined to characterize the hyper-mutability of AAB, using a multi-phenotype cell complex formed by 21 years maintenance without crucial stresses. The strain that adapted to environments above the growth-limiting temperature was also subjected to genome analyses.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Strain and culturing</title><p>IFO records (maintained in NBRC to date) show that <italic>Acetobacter</italic> spp. NBRC 3283, formerly assigned as <italic>Acetobacter aceti</italic> IFO 3283, was originally isolated from a pellicle (a kind of biofilm) on the surface of vinegar fermentation. The 16S rRNA sequences of the <italic>Acetobacter</italic> spp. NBRC 3283 in this work are all identical to one of <italic>A. pasteurianus</italic> but not to <italic>A. aceti</italic> or any other <italic>Acetobacter</italic> strains. Therefore, the nomenclature of this strain was taxonomically reassigned as <italic>A. pasteurianus</italic> in this article. Different lots of <italic>A. pasteurianus</italic> NBRC 3283 were distributed and maintained as a typical <italic>Acetobacter</italic> strains for research. An NBRC 3283 stock sample for genome analyses was the closest to an original IFO 3283 but contained several substrains. To avoid any nomenclature confusion, the substrains isolated from the IFO 3283 (NBRC 3283) were designated, such as <italic>A. pasteurianus</italic> IFO 3283-01.</p><p>The <italic>A. pasteurianus</italic> IFO 3283 (NBRC 3283) and <italic>Gluconacetobacter xylinus</italic> NBRC 3288 were obtained from National Biological Resource Center of Japan (NBRC) and grown routinely at 30&#x000b0;C on YPG medium 1.0% yeast extract, 1.0% polypeptone and 2.0% glycerol. A rich medium, YPGD, contains 1.0% yeast extract, 1.0% polypeptone, 2.0% glycerol and 0.5% glucose, and a minimum medium, NCG, contains 0.5% yeast nitrogen base (BD Difco, Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA), 0.5% casamino acid (BD Difco) and 2.0% glycerol. Potato solid medium was prepared with potato extract from 200 g of boiled potato per liter, 3.0% yeast extract (BD Difco), 0.5% meat extract (Wako Pure Chemical Industries, Osaka, Japan), 1.0% thioglycolate medium (Wako), 0.5% glucose, 1.5% glycerol, 1.5% CaCO<sub>3</sub> and 1.5% agar (pH 7.0). Other media and supplementations, such as ethanol and acetic acid, are described in each figure legend. Short-term continuous cultivation was performed by a dilution method, i.e. when the optical density (OD<sub>600</sub>) of a culture reached &#x0223c;3.0, the culture was diluted to OD<sub>600</sub> = 0.1 with 100 ml of fresh medium in a 300-ml flask and continuously incubated at 30&#x000b0;C with aeration by rotation at 120 r.p.m.</p><p>Between 1954 and 1974, <italic>A. pasteurianus</italic> IFO 3283 (NBRC 3283) was maintained by a serial passage every 3 months at the Institute for Fermentation, Osaka (IFO). In each passage, a loaf of cells picked from a former slant tube stored at 5&#x000b0;C was spread onto the potato solid medium in a new tube and incubated at 28&#x000b0;C for 4 days to allow the cells to grow enough for the next passage, followed by storage at 5&#x000b0;C for 3 months. Reconstitution of the <italic>A. pasteurianus</italic> maintenance herein was performed with the potato medium within slant tubes of 18 mm in diameter in a manner similar to that carried out between 1954 and 1974 in IFO.</p><p><italic>Escherichia coli</italic> JM109 was grown routinely at 37&#x000b0;C on LB medium containing 1.0% NaCl, 1.0% bacto tryptone and 0.5% yeast extract.</p></sec><sec><title>DNA sequencing, assembling gap closing and variation detection</title><p>Three DNA shotgun libraries of <italic>A. pasteurianus</italic> IFO 3283 (NBRC 3283) complex were constructed with inserts of 1.5 and 5.0 kb in pUC118 vector (Takara, Otsu, Japan) and 35 kb in the pCC1FOS (Epicentre, Madison, WI, USA) fosmid vector. The plasmid clone DNAs were directly amplified from <italic>E. coli</italic> colonies and fosmid clone DNAs were extracted from <italic>E. coli</italic> transformants using the Montage BAC96 MiniPrep Kit (Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA), respectively, and DNAs were end-sequenced using dye-terminator chemistry on an ABI PRISM3730XL sequencer (ABI, Foster, CA, USA), as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>). The 42 048 raw sequence reads corresponding to &#x0223c;9.3-fold coverage were assembled using the PHRED/PHRAP/CONSED software package (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.phrap.org">http://www.phrap.org</ext-link>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28 B29 B30">28&#x02013;30</xref>). A number of repeat regions detected in the assembling were masked and then the sequences in most of the masked regions were determined by primer walking to assemble the sequences into supercontigs. Seven supercontigs corresponding to a chromosome and six plasmids were constructed with remains of 30 gaps and 84 low-quality regions under 40 in Phrap score. DNA fragments were then produced to fill all the gaps, except for one locus, by PCR based on the supercontig. The one locus with a few similar transposons was independently sequenced using a fosmid covering the region and Template Generation System II Kit (Finnzymes, Espoo, Finland). All regions with sequences of lower quality than 25 in Phred value were resequenced by primer walking. Assembling of genome DNA was validated by three methods, i.e. Pulse-field gel electrophoresis (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA) after genomic DNA digestion by NotI, SfiI and FseI, fosmid clone digestion by several restriction enzymes and an Optical Mapping system (OpGen, Madison, WI, USA). When any inconsistency in assembling and coexistence of different nucleotides were detected, the sequence variations were confirmed by resequencing all 32 isolated clones.</p><p>The draft genomic DNA sequence of <italic>G. xylinus</italic> NBRC 3288 was obtained by similar methods as described above, and the DNA sequence of the largest plasmid pGXY010 was analyzed in this work.</p><p>For the mutation mapping of <italic>A. pasteurianus</italic> IFO 3283-01-42C, which is bred from IFO 3283-01 by adaptation to 42&#x000b0;C, DNA sequencing was performed with the Genome Analyzer (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA). After the text editing of &#x0223c;1 billion of raw sequence data, mutation mapping was performed using the MAQ software (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>).

Since no colony isolation was performed in the maintenance to avoid the loss of the useful features of the strain, a multi-phenotype cell complex was formed characterized by different textures of rough (R) and smooth (S) colony surfaces, which may be based on a polysaccharide consisting of neutral sugars and a mucoid slime layer, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>b).

However, cell viability decreased to 0.88 &#x000d7; 10<sup>&#x02013;6</sup> (SD = 4.1) after 85 days storage in 5&#x000b0;C and each survival cell need to increased 0.88 &#x000d7; 10<sup>6</sup> fold (&#x000d7;2<sup>20.1</sup>) to recover the original amount of cells.

After the assembly of the sequence reads with 9.3-fold coverage, an approximate 2.9-Mbp supercontig and six short contigs were constructed corresponding to the chromosome and six plasmids, respectively. Thirty-eight assembling gaps and sequence discrepancies were identified as candidate loci for genome variations, i.e. 30 gaps by transposon insertions, five possible sites of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and three regions with HTRs.</p><p>The DNA sequences of the mutation candidates were completely determined using PCR products amplified from genomic DNAs of the 32 isolates (serially named from IFO 3283-01 to IFO 3283-32) from the IFO 3283 (NBRC 3283) cell complex, except one gap in the largest plasmid was sequenced by serial terminal deletions after cloning of the corresponding region from the IFO 3283-01. The results showed that four transposon insertions (numbered as Gap03, Gap14, Gap18 and Gap22), three SNPs (SNP01, SNP02 and SNP03) and three HTRs (AP-TR01, AP-TR03 and AP-TR04) were identified as chromosome variations and a transposon insertion (Gap107) and an HTR (AP-TR07) in the largest plasmid were found as a plasmid variation (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>). In the other 25 loci of the gaps, sequencing using long genome fragments shows that there are a few similar transposons but no genome variations in each locus. The complexity of transposons might prevent the program to assemble the loci with shotgun sequence data. Neither nucleotide substitutions nor insertion/deletion were found in the other two SNP loci out of the five candidates.</p><p>The mutation rate of non-mutator <italic>E. coli</italic> (chromosome size: 4.64 Mb) in the exponential phase was previously estimated as 2&#x02013;8 &#x000d7; 10<sup>&#x02013;4</sup> per generation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43 B44 B45">43&#x02013;45</xref>). When the rate is adapted to the <italic>A. pasteurianus</italic> (chromosome size: 2.9 Mb), its mutation rate may be 1.25&#x02013;5.0 &#x000d7; 10<sup>&#x02013;4</sup> per generation. Therefore, the mutation amount are predicted by multiplication of the mutation rate and the generation numbers, resulting in 0.3&#x02013;1.1 mutations within the 2.2 &#x000d7; 10<sup>3</sup> generations in the 21 years. Since the actual chromosome mutation number is eight (three SNPs and five transposon insertions) and <italic>A. pasteurianus</italic> seems to accumulate mutations faster than the non-mutator <italic>E. coli</italic>, the &#x02018;experienced&#x02019; hyper-mutability of <italic>A. pasteurianus</italic> might be explained by the high rate of mutation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>). It is also reported that the mutation rate of <italic>E. coli</italic> in the starvation or &#x02018;stationary phase&#x02019; increases up to 10&#x02013;100 times higher than that in the exponential phase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>). However, <italic>A. pasteurianus</italic> cells were allowed to grow on a rich medium during the maintenance, 85 days storage in 5&#x000b0;C remarkably decreased the cell viability to 0.88 x 10<sup>&#x02212;6</sup>.

The predicted metabolic pathways were illustrated in the <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkp612/DC1">Supplementary Figure S1</ext-link>. There are generally two pathways to produce dihyroxyacetone (DHA) phosphate from glycerol, one is via DHA catalyzed by glycerol dehydrogenase and the other is via glycerol 3-phosphate by glycerol kinase. The DHA phosphate may be converted to D-glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate by triosephosphate isomerase and thus enter into the glycolysis and gluconeogenesis pathway. However, the <italic>A. pasteurianus</italic> genome contains no genes encoding membrane-bound glycerol dehydrogenase which is well characterized in <italic>Gluconobacter</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>), the capability to produce both DHA and glycerol 3-phosphate by <italic>G</italic>. <italic>xylinus</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>) were reported and <italic>A. pasteurianus</italic> genome includes the glycerol kinase gene (described later) and several gens for alcohol dehydrogenase genes, such as sorbitol dehydrogenase.

Similarly, G144 at SNP02 in glycerol kinase gene (APA01-12552) might be an ancestral one and mutated to T. Alteration of nine and eight adenine at SNP03 generates different coding frames to encode 604 and 90 aa in downstream of the SNP03, respectively. However, no significantly similar proteins to both 604 and 90 aa were found in nonredundant database, the frame with 604 aa is more likely an ancient type because no overlapping genes were observed on the coding region and the coding sequence does not contain a significant amount of minor codons, such as AGG and CTA.</p><p>When the corresponding genes (alleles) at chromosome variations associated with transposon insertions (Gap03, Gap14, Gap22 and Gap18) were compared among the 32 strains, all transposons were inserted in a same site in each allele, and no insertion or deletion were observed in alleles without transposons. This suggests that each transposon insertion happened in a certain strain and inherited, and no removing occurred.</p><p>More assumptions were added for the lineage analysis of the chromosome variation: (i) no reversible mutation occurred, (ii) no chromosome recombination happened between independent strains and (iii) when a wider range of strains with a certain mutation incorporates a smaller one with a different mutation, the former mutation may happen earlier than the latter one. For example, Gap22 is observed in IFO3238-01, -05, -09, -10, -13, -16, -07, -06, -11, -14 and -15, but Gap03 in only IFO3238-01, -05, -09, -10, -13 and -16. In this case, Gap22 was thought to happen earlier than Gap03 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>).</p><p>Based on these assumptions, the 32 isolates were classified into seven groups in the order shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>a. One transposon insertion (Gap107) in the largest plasmid was excluded from the categorization of the genome variations, because plasmids are possibly transmittable among the independent cells. However, no transmission of the plasmids was observed between different genome groups in this work. One representative clone each was chosen from the seven groups, i.e. IFO 3283-01, IFO 3283-03, IFO 3283-07, IFO 3283-12, IFO 3283-22, IFO 3283-26 and IFO 3283-32 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>). IFO 3283-32 is the only strain without mutations, which may retain the original genotype, and may also show the original phenotype of <italic>A. pasteurianus</italic> NBRC 3283. The substrains carrying no (or a few) mutations were minor in the IFO 3283 cell complex.</p></sec><sec><title>Relationship between phenotypes and genotypes</title><p>The remarkable phenotypic differences in the 32 clones are the colony textures on plate culture and pellicle (a liquid/air interface biofilm) formation in liquid culture (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>b and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>a).

Polysaccharide productivities of the 32 clones were measured.

On the other hand, IFO 3283-07 and -12 groups produced less under both conditions. Interestingly, the IFO 3283-01 group produced soluble sugar in liquid culture as high as IFO3283-32 etc., but did less in the other conditions like the IFO 3283-07 and -12 groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>b).

However, at a terminal on the lineage, the high productivity of soluble polysaccharide of the IFO 3283-01 in liquid culture seems to be accompanied with disruption of <italic>secB2</italic> gene (Gap03). Colony textures and pellicle formation of all 32 isolates in media containing 0.5% glucose were same as without glucose (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkp612/DC1">Supplementary Figure S2</ext-link>), thus suggesting that the mutations, SNP02 and Gap03, affect polysaccharide production and the structural modification rather than glucose metabolism.</p><p>Glycerol kinase catalyzes the rate-limiting reaction in the pathway of glycerol utilization and the mutation is located in a beta sheet used to form the inter-homodimer Zn(II) binding site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B55">55</xref>). Therefore, the SNP02 mutation in glycerol kinase gene might directly affect glucose control of glycerol utilization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B56">56</xref>). However, since the strain with SNP02 can grow on glycerol as a sole carbons source at the similar speed as the strain without the mutation, the glycerol utilization by glycerol kinase may be similar to each other strain. SecB is a molecular chaperone in the general secretion system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B57">57</xref>).

The precise function of SecB2 and the relationship to polysaccharide synthesis are unknown. There are two genes related to glycerol metabolism (APA01-12570 and -12560) downstream of the glycerol kinase gene, and six genes (from APA01-21770 to -21820) in a predicted operon with <italic>secB2</italic> (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkp612/DC1">Supplementary Table S4</ext-link>).

However, the strains of IFO 3283-07, -12 and -01 groups, which lost the ability to produce a pellicle, were fixed in this population and became a major portion of the cell complex (total 12 clones out of 32). It is a fundamental but difficult question to answer how mutant strains could be prominent during cell maintenance without special selective pressures.</p><p>The strains in the IFO 3283-07, -12 and -01 groups showed longer lag phase in the YPG medium containing 2.5% ethanol than the others; however, in the absence of ethanol the former strains demonstrated a slightly, but significantly higher density in the stationary phase than in the latter one (data not shown). All strains showed no significant difference in viability in 5&#x000b0;C storage for 3 months (data not shown). The strains of IFO 3283-07, -12 and -01 groups form more smooth colonies to spread easily on the surface of solid medium. This could explain the fixation in the population.</p><p>No phenotypic differences were observed among the groups of IFO 3283-03, -22, -26 and -32, but the strains in the groups of IFO 3283-32 and IFO 3283-22 turned to minor groups (1 each out of 32). Instead, strains in IFO 3283-03 and -26 turned to a major one (18/32) in the complex with two more mutations, SNP01 and SNP03. The SNP01 mutation in <italic>rpoA</italic> gene changes Leu to Gln at 149 aa, which locates at a hinge region between an N-terminal domain for initiation of subunit assembly and a C-terminal domain for transcriptional factor binding and DNA association (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B59">59</xref>). It is possible that the mutation affects the affinity of the alpha subunit to other transcriptional factors, and subsequently the transcriptional level of its regulon(s) modifies fitting ability to the given environment. A gene (APA01-17930) at SNP03 is hypothetical and probably monocistronic, thus the significance of SNP03 is unpredictable. The annotation of the genes related to SNP01 and other mutation sites are listed in <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkp612/DC1">Supplementary Table S4</ext-link>.</p></sec><sec><title>Transposons and plasmids</title><p><italic>Acetobacter pasteurianus</italic> genome contains more than 280 transposons, &#x0223c;9% of total genes in the genome. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that the transposases in those transposons construct several paralogous clusters and the transposase in IS1380, which was previously reported as one of <italic>A. pasteurianus</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>), is most abundant and the total copy number is 74.

For instance, a gene cluster similar to the nitrate assimilation gene cluster of <italic>G. bethesdensis</italic> CGDNIH1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>) was identified in <italic>A. pasteurianus</italic> genome, but the assimilatory nitrate reductase catalytic subunit (APA01_42100) was truncated by a transposon while the genes encoding a assimilatory nitrate reductase electron-transfer subunit (APA01_42120) and a nitrate transporter (APA01_42150) contain a frameshift in each coding region. It suggests <italic>A. pasteurianus</italic> is unable to utilize nitrate as a source of nitrogen by the reduction of nitrate via nitrite to ammonium.</p><p><italic>Acetobacter pasteurianus</italic> genome harbors 6 plasmids besides a number of transposons, which is 9% of total genes in the genome. Spiral bacteria <italic>Borrelia</italic> genomes harbor remarkable amount of plasmids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B60">60</xref>), but transposons in <italic>Borrelia</italic> genomes account for only a few percentages of the total genes.

The plot analysis of the proportion of transposase genes in the total genes and the fragment number including chromosomes and plasmids using genome sequences of 777 bacterial species in the public database, suggests that the combination of relatively large amounts of plasmids and transposons is one of the characteristics leading to the hyper-mutability of <italic>A. pasteurianus</italic> genome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>). <fig id="F4" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><p>Features of <italic>A. pasteurianus</italic> hyper-mutability.

Six TRs, AP-TR01 and AP-TR03-07, are built from homogeneous repetitive sequences, and AP-TR02 is built from a heterogeneous one. All TRs are tracked into individual protein coding regions. Out of the seven TRs, AP-TR01, 03, 04, 06 and 07 all showed hyper-mutability by PCR-directed DNA sequencing and therefore were designated as <italic>A. pasteurianus</italic> HTRs herein.</p><p>The repetitive sequence units and numbers of HTRs and genes including HTRs are listed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>.

In sequencing to determine the repetitive numbers of HTRs, &#x0223c;5% of one repeat shorter and longer sequences were observed as backgrounds (data not shown). It seems that HTRs could be expanded and contracted by repetitive units during DNA multiplication from a single cell to PCR-directed colony sequencing, corresponding to several dozen generations (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkp612/DC1">Supplementary Figure S2</ext-link>).</p><p>The repetitive sequence units of AP-TR04 and AP-TR07 are penta (aggac) and octa (aggacaga) nucleotides, respectively. Therefore, the repetitive numbers alter the coding frames following the HTRs. When the repetitive number of AP-TR04 is multiple of three, the gene, APA01-18740, encodes a 1289-aa sequence consisting of three domains, a DNA helicase domain in the N-terminal, DRTGQ repeats at the TR and 283 aa in the C-terminal In the other two cases of the repetitive numbers, the gene encodes 8 aa and 58 aa in the C-termini (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>).

Where expansion and deletion of tandem repeats are thought to be enhanced by mutations that reduce the fidelity of replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B68">68</xref>), two genes with HTRs encoding a DNA helicase and DNA a polymerase III exonuclease epsilon subunit may be involved in the hyper-mutability of <italic>A. pasteurianus</italic>.</p><p>It is still unclear whether the involvement of translesion synthesis (TLS) or TLS polymerase is significant in the mechanism of expansions or deletions of TRs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B69">69</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B71">71</xref>). Genome of <italic>A. pasteurianus</italic> contains genes encoding RecA, RecFOR, SSB, and DNA polymerase I, III and IV, but not RecBCD, or DNA polymerase II or V. Therefore, it is possible that TLS is involved in <italic>A. pasteurianus</italic> hyper-mutability, if so, DNA polymerase IV, of which a mutant was shown to increase instability of TRs in <italic>E. coli</italic>, is the only error-prone DNA polymerase in <italic>A. pasteurianus</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B69">69</xref>).</p><p>Hyper-mutable TRs may play critical roles in the phenotypic modification of bacteria, such as phase variation and genetic diversity in pathogens.

Besides SNPs, sequence mapping indicated that there are clustered regions without mapped sequences at the predicted replication terminal region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>c). The entire regions were thoroughly sequenced using PCR products, and it revealed that a region 92 kb in length involving APA01-13760 to APA01-14470 was truncated.</p><p>To clarify the contributions of the SNPs and the 92-kb deletion region for adaptive evolution at high temperature, clones from 40C(3) and 40C(5) were tested for viability at 42&#x000b0;C and the genome variations shown in IFO 3283-01-42C. The 40C(5) clone was able to multiply at 42&#x000b0;C but not the 40C(3) one. No mutations were observed in the 40C(3) clone, but the SNP42-01 and 92-kb deletion were detected in 40C(5). This indicated that the SNP42-01 and/or 92-kb deletion may be involved in the adaptive evolution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>d).</p><p>The SNP42-01 was located in APA01-42C-00810 coding a two-component hybrid sensor istidine kinase and regulator. The mutation, from C1187 to T, is nonsynonymous, and resulted in amino acid substitution T396I in a conserved domain among histidine kinases. Therefore, the mutation may affect the signal transduction by an unknown environmental stimulation. The 92-kb deleted region includes 72 genes including a rRNA operon, 16 putative pseudogenes, 21 metabolism-related genes, 14 transposons, 13 transporter genes and six genes encoding unknown function proteins (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkp612/DC1">Supplementary Table S2</ext-link>). It is very difficult to evaluate the association of the SNP42-01 gene and genes in the deleted region with the adaptive evolution. While shorter plasmids and mitochondrial genomes show faster replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B78">78</xref>), the 92-kb deletion corresponding to approximate 3% of the whole genome may affect growth speed or cell viability by decreasing the stress for proliferation in this stressful environment.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>CONCLUDING REMARKS</title><p>Microorganisms utilized in academic and industrial fields must be maintained to conserve identical characteristics wherever and whenever used. Extraordinary consideration for storage and handling should be paid to hyper-mutable microorganisms isolated from nature. In the middle of the 20th century, it was believed that AAB should be maintained by serial passage to avoid phenotypic modification, but neither frozen nor maintained at 4&#x000b0;C, because of the extraordinarily low survival rate and high mutation frequency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B79">79</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B80">80</xref>). Furthermore, colony isolation during the passage was prohibited to avoid cloning unanticipated mutants. Attempting to clarify the hyper-mutability of <italic>A. pasteurianus</italic>, known as a hyper-mutable bacterium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>), therefore required the genome DNA sequencing of cells grown in two different culturing conditions.</p><p>First, <italic>A. pasteurianus</italic> IFO 3283 (NBRC 3283), which formed a multi-phenotype cell complex following a series of slant passages for 21 years, was subjected to &#x02018;mixed&#x02019; genome DNA sequencing. The genome analysis revealed that more than 280 transposons, &#x0223c;9% of the genes, exist in the genome consisting of a 2.9-Mb chromosome and 6 plasmids. The <italic>A. pasteurianus</italic> genome may be characterized by a combination of a large number both transposons and plasmids. Actually five variations by transposon insertion, as well as three SNPs, were found in the IFO 3283 (NBRC 3283) complex. A plasmid of <italic>G. xylinus</italic> carries a gene specifically similar to one in the <italic>A. pasteurianus</italic> chromosome, and a plasmid of <italic>A. pasteurianus</italic> was depleted during high-temperature adaptation. These findings may illustrate the involvement of plasmids in the genetic instability of AAB. The existence of HTRs in open reading frames is a characteristic of the <italic>A. pasteurianus</italic> genome. However, it seems to be involved in the feasibility of DNA maintenance, the physiological meaning is largely unknown.</p><p>Second, <italic>A. pasteurianus</italic> was used for the breeding of a strain proliferative at an unviable high temperature (42&#x000b0;C). Genome analyses of the bred strain by saturated genome shotgun sequencing revealed that a 92-kb deletion (&#x0223c;3% of the whole genome size) and three single nucleotide mutations occurred in the genome during the high-temperature adaptation. However, the generating mechanism and genetic meaning of the large deletion is unknown, it seems that the smaller genome yields a survival advantage in the highly stressful conditions, possibly because of faster replication or lower heat generation based on less burden in DNA replication.</p><p>Alpha-proteobacteria, including AAB, contains many intracellular symbionts and parasites such as bacteria in the families, Rhizobiaceae, Rickettsiaceae and Brucellaceae, whose genomes are generally shorter and show increased evolution rates in comparison to those of closely related free-living bacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>). However, <italic>A. pasteurianus</italic> is assumed to be a free-living bacterium, it may have evolved to fit in competitive natural niches of seasonal fruits and flowers accompanied by the genetic flexibility and instability.</p></sec><sec><title>ACCESSION NUMBERS</title><p>The eight substrains of <italic>A. pasteurianus</italic> (IFO 3283-01, -03, -07, -12, -22, -26, -32 and IFO 3283-01-42C) reported herein have been re-deposited in the National Biological Resource Center (NBRC) and its genome DNA sequences were registered in DDBJ/EMBL/GenBank database.
