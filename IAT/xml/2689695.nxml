In rodent cerebellar cortex, stellate interneurons elaborate characteristic axon arbors that selectively innervate Purkinje cell dendrites and likely regulate dendritic integration. We used GFP BAC transgenic reporter mice to examine the cellular processes and molecular mechanisms underlying the development of stellate cell axons and their innervation pattern. We show that stellate axons are organized and guided towards Purkinje cell dendrites by an intermediate scaffold of Bergmann glial (BG) fibers. The L1 family immunoglobulin protein Close Homologue of L1 (CHL1) is localized to apical BG fibers and stellate cells during the development of stellate axon arbors. In the absence of CHL1, stellate axons deviate from BG fibers and show aberrant branching and orientation. Furthermore, synapse formation between aberrant stellate axons and Purkinje dendrites is reduced and cannot be maintained, leading to progressive atrophy of axon terminals. These results establish BG fibers as a guiding scaffold and CHL1 a molecular signal in the organization of stellate axon arbors and in directing their dendritic innervation.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><sec id="st1"><title/><p>Large principal neurons in vertebrate neural circuits often consist of distinct anatomical and physiological compartments, which allow distributed and compartmentalized signaling and greatly increase the computational power of single neurons.

Subcellular synapse organization is a prominent feature of neuronal wiring specificity, but the underlying cellular and molecular mechanisms are not well understood.</p><p>A prime example of subcellular synapse organization is the Purkinje neurons of the cerebellum. The cerebellar cortex is organized as a near lattice-like circuit architecture along the two axes of the cerebellar lobules, the translobular and parlobular planes &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060103-b011">11</xref>&#x0005d;. At the focal position in the cerebellar cortex and as its sole output, Purkinje neurons are restricted in the translobular plane and receive at least four sets of subcellularly targeted excitatory and inhibitory inputs &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060103-b011">11</xref>&#x0005d;. The glutamatergic parallel fibers synapse onto the slender spines of the more distal dendrites, whereas the climbing fibers prefer the stubby spines of the proximal dendrite. In addition, the GABAergic basket interneurons target Purkinje cell soma and axon initial segment (AIS), whereas the stellate interneurons innervate the dendritic shafts. The mechanisms underlying subcellular synapse organization along Purkinje neurons are only beginning to be understood &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060103-b012">12</xref>&#x0005d;. There is evidence that the innervation of Purkinje AIS by basket interneurons is guided by a subcellular gradient of neurofascin186, an L1 family immunoglobulin cell adhesion molecule, recruited by the ankyrinG membrane adaptor protein &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060103-b013">13</xref>&#x0005d;. On the other hand, the mechanisms that direct the innervation of Purkinje dendrites by stellate interneurons are unknown.</p><p>Stellate cells mainly occupy the upper half of the molecular layer (ML) and are the only cell type of the upper third of the ML. Like the basket cells, stellate cells extend their axons within the translobular (e.g., parasagittal) plane of the cerebellar cortex &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060103-b011">11</xref>&#x0005d;. Although these axon arbors range from relatively simple to fairly complex, the most characteristic feature is their largely vertically oriented ascending and descending collaterals, which innervate multiple Purkinje dendrites along their path &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060103-b011">11</xref>&#x0005d;. Unlike climbing fibers, which have been well documented to grow along and eventually innervate single Purkinje dendrites, the cellular and developmental process by which stellate axon approach and innervate Purkinje dendrites have not been described.</p><p>Bergmann glia (BG) cells are highly polarized astrocytes, whose radial fibers dominate the cerebellar cortex &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060103-b011">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060103-b014">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060103-b015">15</xref>&#x0005d;.

By using a genetic strategy to simultaneously label stellate axons and BG fibers at high resolution, here we provide evidence that BG fibers constitute an intermediate template in the organization of stellate axon arbors into characteristic trajectories, and in their guidance to innervate Purkinje dendrites.</p><p>The L1 family immunoglobulin cell adhesion molecules (L1CAMs) have been implicated in axon growth, guidance &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060103-b020">20</xref>&#x0005d;, and the subcellular organization of GABAergic synapses &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060103-b012">12</xref>&#x0005d;.

We found that each member of the L1 family is localized to subcellular domains in neurons and glia in the developing and mature cerebellar cortex. In particular, CHL1 (Close Homologue of L1) is prominently expressed on BG fibers during the development of stellate axons and their innervation. In addition, we demonstrate a crucial and highly specific role of CHL1 in the patterning of stellate axons and in targeting their innervation to Purkinje cell dendrites.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Stellate and Basket Axons Use Different Cellular Mechanisms to Innervate Subcellular Domains of Purkinje Neurons</title><p>To investigate the cellular mechanisms underlying development of the stellate axon arbor and innervation pattern, it is necessary to visualize stellate axons together with their postsynaptic targets at high resolution and during the developmental process. We generated several lines of bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) transgenic reporter mice to achieve such visualization. The calcium binding protein parvalbumin (Pv) is normally expressed in all Purkinje, basket, and stellate neurons in the postnatal cerebellar cortex. In our Pv-GFP BAC transgenic mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060103-g001">Figure 1</xref>A), different fractions of Purkinje, basket, and stellate neurons express green fluorescent protein (GFP) among different stable lines (from a few percent to near 100&#x00025;; unpublished data), likely due to different genomic integration sites of the transgene. In the B20 line, sparse GFP expression allowed visualization of single Purkinje, basket, and stellate cells with synaptic resolution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060103-g001">Figure 1</xref>B&#x02013;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060103-g001">1</xref>E).

Consistent with previous Golgi studies &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060103-b011">11</xref>&#x0005d;, GFP labeling revealed distinct features of stellate and basket axons in their morphology and subcellular innervation pattern, even when they are found at the same location in the mid-lower ML (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060103-g001">Figure 1</xref>F&#x02013;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060103-g001">1</xref>H). For example, basket axons were smooth, whereas stellate axons were beaded. Although basket axons extended terminal branches along Purkinje cell proximal dendrites, soma, and towards AISs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060103-g001">Figure 1</xref>H), stellate axons clearly did not extend along the distinct contours of Purkinje dendrites. Instead, stellate axon arbors were often characterized by rather straight ascending and descending collaterals (also described in &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060103-b011">11</xref>&#x0005d;) that crossed Purkinje cell dendrites at rather sharp angles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060103-g001">Figure 1</xref>F and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060103-g001">1</xref>G). Interestingly, the axon tips of stellate cells in the lower ML often reached the Purkinje cell layer (PCL), as the basket axons. However, these descending collaterals never extended along Purkinje dendrite-soma-AIS, but always had rather straight paths that terminated abruptly at the PCL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060103-g001">Figure 1</xref>G). These contrasting features suggest that basket and stellate axons approach and innervate Purkinje neurons via profoundly different cellular and developmental mechanisms. Furthermore, the arborization and innervation patterns of stellate axons also contrast those of a dendrite-targeting climbing fiber, which grows along and &#x0201c;monopolizes&#x0201d; an entire Purkinje dendrite &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060103-b011">11</xref>&#x0005d;. These comparisons raise an obvious question: how do stellate axons approach and innervate segments of multiple Purkinje dendrites without growing along any single target?</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Development of Stellate Axon Arbor and Dendritic Innervation</title><p>To better understand the developmental process by which stellate axons innervate Purkinje dendrites, we used our reporter mice expressing GFP from the GAD67 promoter elements (GAD67-GFP BAC reporter mice, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060103-g002">Figure 2</xref>A and &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060103-b013">13</xref>&#x0005d;), which label Purkinje, basket, and stellate cells from embryonic stage to adulthood.

These progenitors migrate into the cerebellar cortex in the first two postnatal weeks as simple unipolar cells until arriving in the ML. They then undergo a series of morphological transformations that culminate in formation of mature interneurons during the third and fourth postnatal week. However, the morphological maturation of stellate axons has not been well described. Compared to basket cells, stellate cell precursors migrate into the ML a few days later, peaking between postnatal day 8 and 11 (P8&#x02013;P11) but continue to arrive as late as P14 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060103-g002">Figure 2</xref>B&#x02013;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060103-g002">2</xref>D; also see &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060103-b022">22</xref>&#x0005d;).

During the third and fourth week, BG fibers further branch, extend lateral varicoses and fine processes, eventually forming an extensive reticular meshwork &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060103-b016">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060103-b018">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060103-b025">25</xref>&#x0005d;. Consistent with these results, using single-cell electroporation to label BG with GFP, we found that BG fibers project highly irregular lateral branches during the third postnatal week (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0060103-sg004">Figure S4</xref>A). Furthermore, using transgenic mice expressing GFP under the control of a mouse GFAP promoter &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060103-b027">27</xref>&#x0005d;, we were able to visualize the extensive meshwork of the BG system in the ML, and found that GFAP was largely concentrated in the radial BG fibers, but not the finer lateral appendages and processes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0060103-sg004">Figure S4</xref>B). In addition to the apical radial fibers in the ML, BG cell bodies also give off numerous lamellar processes that enwrap Purkinje cell soma and AIS after the third postnatal week &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060103-b011">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060103-b014">14</xref>&#x0005d;, although the more precise timing of this process is unclear. Mature BG cells are thus highly polarized astrocytes with distinct subcellular specializations.</p><p>The vertical bias of the orientation of stellate axon collaterals prompted us to examine their relationship with BG fibers during the development of dendritic innervation. As expected, when stellate cell precursors were migrating across the PCL in the second postnatal week, GFAP-positive BG fibers were prominent throughout the ML (e.g., P8, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060103-g002">Figure 2</xref>D). Upon reaching their destination in the ML, stellate cells began to extend neurites. Although their axons extended in different directions, many of their descending/ascending branches were strictly associated with GFAP-labeled BG fibers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060103-g002">Figure 2</xref>E). This association was particularly prominent in the upper ML, where stellate axons often perfectly followed the curving BG fibers for tens of microns, and remained so in subsequence weeks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060103-g002">Figure 2</xref>F). Such extensive association with BG fibers contrasts the rather patchy and &#x0201c;en passant&#x02013;type&#x0201d; interaction between Purkinje dendrites and BG fibers &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060103-b014">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060103-b016">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060103-b028">28</xref>&#x0005d;. Our detection of association between stellate axons and Bergmann glia was probably an underestimate, since the finer lateral BG appendages were not well labeled by GFAP. Importantly, there was no association between basket axons and BG fibers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060103-g002">Figure 2</xref>G), consistent with the finding that basket terminals grow along the proximal dendrite-soma-AIS of Purkinje cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060103-g001">Figure 1</xref>H).</p><p>To substantiate this finding, we further examined the association of GABAergic synaptic markers with BG fibers. GAD65, an isoform of glutamic acid decarboxylase, is localized to GABAergic presynaptic terminals and physically coupled to synaptic vesicles (&#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060103-b029">29</xref>&#x0005d;). The onset of GAD65 expression has been shown to coincide with GABAergic synaptogenesis in the cerebellum &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060103-b030">30</xref>&#x0005d;. We focused our analysis to the upper ML, where most, if not all, GAD65 signals are derived from stellate cell axons. At P16, shortly after stellate neurons begin to send their axons and made synaptic contacts, double labeling revealed a 52&#x00025; colocalization between GAD65 and GFAP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060103-g003">Figure 3</xref>A). This colocalization increased to 65&#x00025; in the more mature ML (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060103-g003">Figure 3</xref>B and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060103-g003">3</xref>C). To rule out the possibility that these levels of colocalization can be reached by chance, we artificially shifted the confocal image stacks of GFAP horizontally relative to that of GAD65 by 5 &#x003bc;m, and then reanalyzed GAD65 and GFAP colocalization (since BG fibers were arranged vertically with an average gap of approximately 5 &#x003bc;m between neighboring fibers; see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>). This shift analysis revealed a highly significant 30&#x00025; decrease in GAD65-GFAP association (<italic>p</italic> &#x02264; 0.01, <italic>n</italic> &#x0003d; 20 different sections in 3 different mice), indicating that the organization of GAD65 along BG fibers was not due to chance. This analysis is likely an underestimate of GAD65&#x02013;BG association since GFAP antibodies did not label well the finer BG processes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0060103-sg004">Figure S4</xref>B and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0060103-sg004">S4</xref>E). In addition to the statistical association, strings of GAD65 puncta, indicative of an underlying stellate axon branch, were frequently seen to perfectly align with GFAP fibers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060103-g003">Figure 3</xref>B and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060103-g003">3</xref>C). The combined observations suggest that BG fibers in the cerebellar cortex provide a growth template, which may organize stellate axons into characteristic orientations and trajectories.

CHL1 expression in stellate cells likely also plays a significant role.

First, the association was apparent as soon as stellate cells begin to extend axons during the second postnatal week. Second, stellate axons often strictly followed the curving contours of BG fibers for tens of microns, as well as the lateral appendages of BG fiber. Finally, the association between BG fibers and stellate axons was specifically disrupted by the loss of an immunoglobulin family cell adhesion molecule expressed in both BG fibers and stellate cells. It is thus likely that BG fibers mainly serve as a growth template for stellate axons, and additional molecular and/or activity-dependent mechanisms may regulate the size and exuberance of axon arbors. Interestingly, BG processes also express GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors that enwrap inhibitory synapses &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060103-b037">37</xref>&#x0005d;; it is thus possible that BG fibers may respond to GABA signaling from developing stellate cell axons.

It is thus possible that an astroglial intermediate scaffold might be a more general mechanism for directing the trajectory of axon extension, pre- and postsynaptic target interaction, and complex patterns of innervation.</p></sec><sec id="s3b"><title>CHL1 as a Molecular Signal for the Patterning and Subcellular Organization of Stellate Axons</title><p>Like other members of the L1CAM &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060103-b020">20</xref>&#x0005d;, CHL1 is expressed in both neurons and glia &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060103-b031">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060103-b053">53</xref>&#x0005d;.

The well-defined architecture and connectivity in cerebellar cortex present an advantage in defining the cellular and subcellular expression of CHL1 and in dissecting its role in axonal and synapse development. CHL1 is prominently localized to apical BG fibers since the first postnatal week, and subsequently extend to the lateral appendages during the second and third postnatal week. We cannot ascertain whether CHL1 is also expressed in the fine BG fiber processes (due to the presence of CHL1 in parallel fibers and possibly other neural elements in the ML). Importantly, CHL1 is not localized to the basal lamellae of BG cells, which extend to Purkinje soma and AIS. Such polarized distribution of CHL1 in BG cells may present a permissive substrate for the growth and patterning of stellate axons and for their restriction to the ML to innervate Purkinje dendrites. In addition, CHL1 is expressed in stellate cells, but not in Purkinje neurons &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060103-b031">31</xref>&#x0005d;. CHL1 immunoreactivity could be clearly detected in stellate cell somata by P14 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060103-g004">Figure 4</xref>), although its subcellular distribution (on axons and dendrites) was difficult to discern.</p><p>In our analysis of <italic>CHL1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> mice, the trajectory and orientation of stellate axons and their innervation of Purkinje dendrites were profoundly aberrant. In contrast, basket axons and their innervation of the Purkinje soma-AIS were entirely normal. In addition, Purkinje dendrites and their glutamatergic innervation by climbing fibers and parallel fibers also appeared intact, even though CHL1 is known to be expressed in granule cells and parallel fibers &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060103-b031">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060103-b053">53</xref>&#x0005d;. These results reveal a highly specific role for CHL1 in the patterning of stellate cell axon arbors. The significant reduction of GAD65 puncta in the ML may result from a reduction in the number of stellate synapses, deficient synapses, or both. Whereas double labeling and confocal microscopy detected a reduced localization of GAD65 to stellate boutons, ultrastructural analysis confirmed a significant reduction of stellate synapses along Purkinje dendrites. Interestingly, a recent study shows that CHL1 is localized at presynaptic terminals of glutamatergic and GABAergic axons in dissociated hippocampal cultures &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060103-b058">58</xref>&#x0005d;; CHL1 appears to be targeted to synaptic vesicles by endocytosis in response to synapse activation and regulates the uncoating of clathrin-coated synaptic vesicles &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060103-b058">58</xref>&#x0005d;. It is thus conceivable that the absence of CHL1 in stellate cell axons may impair GABAergic vesicle endocytosis and GAD65 synaptic localization. We suggest that CHL1 deficiency results in dissociation of stellate axons from their normal BG fiber &#x0201c;tracks,&#x0201d; aberrant axon orientation and trajectory, which contribute to subsequent deficiency in synapse formation and stability. Our current analysis cannot distinguish whether the decreased number of GABAergic synapses from stellate onto Purkinje cells in <italic>CHL1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> mice results from the inability of the stellate axon to engage in synapse assembly, deficient cell adhesion prior to synapse assembly, or deficient synapse maintenance.</p><p>The reduction of GAD65 signals in the ML of BG-restricted CHL1 knockouts further pinpoints a specific role of CHL1 in BG fibers. On the other hand, the intermediate phenotype in these mice compared to that in germline <italic>CHL1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> mice implies that CHL1 in other cell types, e.g., stellate and granule cells, may also contribute to their axon and synapse development. It is possible that CHL1 may localize to stellate axons and contribute to arbor patterning through homophilic interaction with CHL1 distributed on BG fibers. On the other hand, unknown CHL1 ligands in stellate cells and BG fibers may mediate heterophilic interactions during stellate axon development. Indeed, CHL1 can act as a coreceptor for neuropilin-1 to mediate axon guidance by semaphorin3A during development of the thalamocortical projection &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060103-b059">59</xref>&#x0005d;. During the third postnatal week, CHL1 expression in stellate cells might also promote the maturation and stability of synaptic innervation through heterophilic interactions with Purkinje dendrites and hetero- or homophilic interaction with BG fibers. Finally, CHL1 might also be localized to stellate dendrites, which are innervated by other stellate axons. Deficiencies in stellate axon arbor and synaptic innervation in <italic>CHL1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> mice may contribute to the impairment in their motor behaviors, such as the ability to maintain balance on an accelerated Rota-Rod &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060103-b060">60</xref>&#x0005d;.</p></sec><sec id="s3c"><title>L1CAMs and the Subcellular Organization of GABAergic Axons along Purkinje Neurons</title><p>Although it was once debated whether basket cells and stellate cells were variants of the same class of cerebellar interneurons, it is now established that they constitute distinct cell types, likely with distinct genetic origins &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060103-b061">61</xref>&#x0005d;, and a fundamental difference is their subcellular target innervation. In both cell types, the final axon arbor and innervation pattern is achieved through sequential developmental processes, which may involve: the pattern and order of their migration into the ML, the elaboration of axon arbors along defined cellular substrates and adhesion mechanisms, and the formation&#x02013;stabilization of synaptic contacts along different compartments of Purkinje neurons. Here, we demonstrate that stellate and basket cells deploy different cellular and molecular mechanisms to achieve their distinct axon arborization and innervation patterns.</p><p>The basket cells make synaptic contacts along the soma-AIS of a Purkinje cell, a highly restricted synaptic target area. It is perhaps not surprising that basket axons arrive at their destination, in part, by growing along the Purkinje proximal dendrite-soma-AIS, guided by a subcellular gradient of neurofascin &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060103-b013">13</xref>&#x0005d;. The stellate cells, on the other hand, face a rather different task when innervating Purkinje dendrites: even though each Purkinje dendrite is a largely 2-dimensional, flat target, it expands hundreds of microns in the translobular plane. Unlike a climbing fiber, which adheres to and monopolizes a single Purkinje dendrite, a stellate axon innervates segments of multiple dendrites, often with characteristic descending and ascending collaterals. It is thus not obvious how stellate axons can ever achieve such a distinct innervation pattern by direct and strong adhesion to Purkinje dendrites. The BG fibers seem to provide a useful solution to this problem. As an extensive and largely radial scaffold in the ML, the BG fibers are well suited to organize and deliver stellate axons to Purkinje dendrites, with defined orientations and trajectories. In addition, by relying on a glial instead of neuronal substrate, stellate axons may reduce the risk of making ectopic and unnecessary synaptic contacts. Furthermore, the BG fibers appear to direct both the patterning of axon arbor and subcellular innervation. It remains to be investigated whether such an intermediate glial scaffold is a more general strategy to sculpt precise neuronal connections in other brain areas.</p><p>We present evidence that, CHL1, a close homolog of neurofascin186, is involved in the development of stellate axons and their dendritic innervation. Our results suggest that different members of the L1 family may contribute to axon patterning and subcellular synapse organization in different cell types, and may act in glia as well as in neurons. The subcellular recruitment of NF186 is achieved by the ankyrinG membrane adaptor protein at the Purkinje AIS &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060103-b013">13</xref>&#x0005d;. It is tempting to speculate that another form of ankyrin in BG cells may organize CHL1 subcellular localization. In addition to permissive/attractive signals, such as NF186 to basket axons and CHL1 to stellate axons, repulsive or bifunctional signals (depending on different axon types) at distinct subcellular sites may also contribute to topographically precise synapse organization. The identification of physiological ligands for NF186 and CHL1 in basket and stellate axons will further our understanding of the underlying molecular mechanisms.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>BAC transgenic mice.</title><p>BAC clones containing the mouse <italic>parvalbumin</italic> (<italic>PV</italic>) genes were identified from the RPCI-23 library (CHORI).
