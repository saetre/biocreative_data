Although JNK influences inflammatory signaling pathways, it remains unclear whether its activity in macrophages contributes to adipose tissue inflammation and ultimately to the regulation of systemic metabolism. To address whether the action of this critical inflammatory kinase in bone marrow-derived elements regulates inflammatory responses in obesity and is sufficient and necessary for the deterioration of insulin sensitivity, we performed bone marrow transplantation studies with wild type and JNK1-deficient mice. These studies illustrated that JNK1-deficiency in the bone marrow-derived elements (BMDE) was insufficient to impact macrophage infiltration or insulin sensitivity despite modest changes in the inflammatory profile of adipose tissue. Only when the parenchymal elements lacked JNK1 could we demonstrate a significant increase in systemic insulin sensitivity. These data indicate that while the JNK1 activity in BMDE is involved in metabolic regulation and adipose milieu, it is epistatic to JNK1 activity in the parenchymal tissue for regulation of metabolic homeostasis.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="11"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Over the last decade discoveries in the metabolism field, starting with the association of increased tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-&#x003b1;) and other inflammatory cytokines in obesity, have demonstrated the strong inflammatory underpinnings of obesity and associated metabolic diseases <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003151-Hotamisligil1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003151-Ventre1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>.

While it has yet to be determined whether inflammatory and stress signaling pathways are proximal or distal to organelle dysfunction or triggered by peptide or lipid mediators, it is evident that many of these harmful responses have common targets in regulating insulin receptor signaling. One such target is insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS-1) serine phosphorylation which is mediated by inflammatory kinases such as c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and I&#x003ba;B kinase beta (IKK&#x003b2;) and consequently modulates insulin action <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003151-Hotamisligil3">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003151-Gao1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>.

JNK activity has also been linked to adverse metabolic outcomes in several critical cellular models and tissues. For example, in &#x003b2;-cells of the islet of Langerhans, activation of JNK is involved in the reduction of insulin gene expression and suppression of the JNK pathway protects &#x003b2;-cells against oxidative stress <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003151-Kaneto2">&#x0005b;26&#x0005d;</xref>.

It remains to be determined, however, whether contributions of bone marrow-derived cells or those of the parenchymal elements are primarily responsible for triggering the inflammatory changes and dictate the detrimental metabolic outcomes of obesity. In the ApoE-deficient model of atherosclerosis, JNK1 activity in the bone marrow-derived cells had no measured effect on metabolic parameters <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003151-Ricci1">&#x0005b;31&#x0005d;</xref>. However, due to the limitations of this model to evaluate insulin action, we examined the role of JNK1 activity in bone marrow-derived elements in development of high fat diet-induced insulin resistance in the C57BL/6 genetic background. Since JNK1 action has been shown to lie at the interface of obesity and inflammation and the results of several studies indicate that macrophage activity may contribute to insulin resistance in diet-induced obesity, we performed bone marrow transplant experiments to test whether myeloid JNK1 regulates the development of insulin resistance. Specifically, we transplanted JNK1-deficient bone marrow into wild type (WT) mice and examined the metabolic impact in the resulting chimeras. We also performed the inverse transplantation experiments to determine the effects of JNK1 activity in the parenchymal tissues on systemic metabolic homeostasis in mice. We conclude that parenchymal JNK1 plays a predominant role in mediating insulin sensitivity in non-immune cells.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Regulation of lipid-induced inflammatory responses in macrophages by JNK1 <italic>in vitro</italic></title><p>To address the impact of JNK1 activity on the inflammatory capacity of myeloid cells, we examined free fatty acid-induced inflammatory cytokine expression in WT and JNK1-deficient macrophages.

Genetic interference with regulators of inflammatory pathways, such as IKK&#x003b2; and PPAR&#x003b3;, in myeloid derived cells has also been demonstrated to confer partial protection from insulin-resistance <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003151-Hevener1">&#x0005b;32&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003151-Arkan1">&#x0005b;35&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003151-Odegaard1">&#x0005b;36&#x0005d;</xref>. Our studies show that JNK1 activity in myeloid cells influences the cellular milieu of the adipose tissue and liver as well. Interestingly, however, the effect of myeloid JNK1 on the inflammatory cytokine expression is dependent on the tissue type examined. When JNK1 is present in the parenchyma, JNK1-deficieny in the bone marrow-derived cells does not confer protection against diet-induced insulin resistance, despite detectable but modest effects on adipose tissue inflammation. We were able to detect a small, but significant, negative impact of <italic>Jnk1<sup>&#x0002b;/&#x0002b;</sup></italic> macrophages on <italic>Jnk1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> recipients. These results indicate that JNK1 activity in myeloid cells is not sufficient to alter systemic glucose metabolism and that parenchymal JNK activity is the dominant determinant for metabolic homeostasis.</p><p>Furthermore, our results also suggest that conditions that alter the inflammatory gene expression in bone marrow-derived cells would not always yield corresponding changes in systemic insulin sensitivity. In this sense, the metabolic status of the parenchymal targets such as adipocytes or hepatocytes appears to be the driver of both inflammatory alterations and their systemic metabolic consequences. Although similarly identifying a role for JNK1 outside the parenchyma, a recent work by another group came to somewhat different conclusions regarding the magnitude of the contributions of JNK activity in the bone marrow-derived elements on systemic insulin action, where JNK1-deficiency in the bone marrow was sufficient to improve insulin sensitivity even in the WT recipients <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003151-Solinas1">&#x0005b;37&#x0005d;</xref>. In this study, the disease in general appeared to be more advanced despite a later start of dietary interventions, manifesting in higher average body weights and more severe disease. Hence, the differences in our results can be explained by the differences in bone marrow transplantation protocols (early vs. late dietary invention and the timing of the transplantation) and the magnitude of the disease achieved through high fat diet exposure. It is possible that at later stages of the disease, massive degeneration of tissue and recruitment of higher numbers of macrophages could exhibit a larger impact on general metabolism through the action of these bone marrow-derived cells, as reported <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003151-Solinas1">&#x0005b;37&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>In this study, we did not observe any changes in total body weight between the chimeric groups, whereas without transplantation, JNK1-deficiency results in a modest reduction in adiposity on a high fat diet <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003151-Hirosumi1">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref>.

This is consistent with our observations where we did observe the development of insulin resistance with differences in body weight between groups which allowed examination of the impact of JNK activity independent of secondary effects of body weight and adiposity. At this early stage disease model, the parenchymal cells such as adipocytes and hepatocytes appear to drive the initial events impacting insulin sensitivity and glucose metabolism. The ability to modulate systemic insulin sensitivity through manipulation of JNK1 action in the liver also supports this inference <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003151-Nakatani1">&#x0005b;27&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003151-Yang1">&#x0005b;28&#x0005d;</xref>.
