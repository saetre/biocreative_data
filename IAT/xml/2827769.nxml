APP are mainly synthesised by hepatocytes and their transcription is induced by pro-inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin-1 (IL-1). The molecular mechanisms underlying the IL-1-induced expression of key transcription factors implicated in the regulation of APP are poorly understood. We have investigated this aspect using the CCAAT/enhancer binding protein-&#x003b4; (C/EBP&#x003b4;) as a model gene. IL-1 induced the expression of C/EBP&#x003b4; mRNA and protein in the human hepatoma Hep3B cell line, a widely employed model system for studies on cytokine signalling in relation to the expression of APP. The IL-1-mediated induction of C/EBP&#x003b4; expression was attenuated in the presence of pharmacological inhibitors against c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) (curcumin and SP600125), casein kinase 2 (CK2) (apigenin) and nuclear factor-&#x003ba;B (NF-&#x003ba;B) (NF-&#x003ba;B activation inhibitor). RNA interference assays showed significant attenuation of the IL-1-induced expression of C/EBP&#x003b4; following knockdown of the p50 and p65 subunits of NF-&#x003ba;B. IL-1 induced NF-&#x003ba;B DNA binding and activation by this transcription factor and this was attenuated by curcumin and apigenin. Taken together, these results suggest a potentially crucial role for NF-&#x003ba;B in the IL-1-induced expression of C/EBP&#x003b4;, and thereby downstream APP genes regulated by this transcription factor.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Acute phase proteins</kwd><kwd>CCAAT/enhancer binding proteins</kwd><kwd>Hepatocytes</kwd><kwd>Interleukin-1</kwd><kwd>Cell signalling</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec><label>1</label><title>Introduction</title><p>The acute phase response (APR) is the body's innate immune defence against infection, inflammation, stress, physical trauma and pathological conditions such as cardiovascular disease (<xref rid="bib32 bib3" ref-type="bibr">Ramji et al., 1993a; Baumann and Gauldie, 1994</xref>). The APR is characterized by fever, leukocytosis, altered metabolism in many organs, and dramatic changes in the plasma concentrations of various acute phase proteins (APP) (<xref rid="bib32 bib3" ref-type="bibr">Ramji et al., 1993a; Baumann and Gauldie, 1994</xref>). Numerous studies have suggested that such APP may act as biomarkers and possibly causal agents in the development of cardiovascular disease (<xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">Packard and Libby, 2008</xref>).</p><p>The APP can be distinguished into two major groups; the positive APP (e.g. hemopexin, C-reactive protein (CRP), fibrinogen, serum amyloid A (SAA)) whose plasma concentrations increase during the APR, and the negative APP (e.g. albumin, transferrin) whose levels decrease (<xref rid="bib32 bib3" ref-type="bibr">Ramji et al., 1993a; Baumann and Gauldie, 1994</xref>). The main stimulators of APP production are inflammation-associated cytokines such as interleukin-6 (IL-6), interleukin-1 (IL-1), tumour necrosis factor-&#x003b1; and interferon-&#x003b3; (IFN-&#x003b3;) (<xref rid="bib32 bib33 bib3 bib26" ref-type="bibr">Ramji et al., 1993a,b; Baumann and Gauldie, 1994; Moshage, 1997</xref>). The liver is the major site for APP production and cytokines regulate their expression mainly at the transcriptional level (<xref rid="bib32 bib33 bib3 bib26" ref-type="bibr">Ramji et al., 1993a,b; Baumann and Gauldie, 1994; Moshage, 1997</xref>). It is essential that the molecular mechanisms underlying such regulation are fully understood, particularly how cytokines modulate the action of key transcription factors involved in this response. CCAAT/enhancer binding proteins (C/EBP) fall in this category (<xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">Ramji and Foka, 2002</xref>).</p><p>Transcription factors belonging to the C/EBP family contain a conserved basic-leucine zipper motif at the carboxyl terminus that is involved in dimerization and DNA binding (<xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">Ramji and Foka, 2002</xref>). There are six C/EBP family members (C/EBP&#x003b1; to &#x003b6;), most of which recognize similar DNA sequences, at least <italic>in vitro</italic>, and form heterodimers in intrafamilial combinations (<xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">Ramji and Foka, 2002</xref>). Binding sites for the C/EBPs have been identified in the regulatory regions of a large number of APP genes, including hemopexin, haptoglobin, CRP, &#x003b1;<sub>1</sub>-acid glycoprotein, &#x003b1;<sub>2</sub>-macroglobulin, SAA-1, -2 and -3, complement C3, plasminogen and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (<xref rid="bib31 bib34 bib2 bib9 bib10" ref-type="bibr">Poli, 1998; Ramji and Foka, 2002; Bannach et al., 2004; Dong et al., 2005, 2007</xref>). The general trend that has emerged from these studies is that C/EBP&#x003b1; homodimers or C/EBP&#x003b1;:C/EBP&#x003b2; heterodimers are mainly responsible for the constitutive transcription (<xref rid="bib6 bib35 bib31 bib34" ref-type="bibr">Chen and Liao, 1993; Ray and Ray, 1994; Poli, 1998; Ramji and Foka, 2002</xref>). However, upon induction of the APR, C/EBP&#x003b1; dimers are rapidly replaced by C/EBP-&#x003b2; and -&#x003b4; homo-/heterodimers, although the exact composition of these complexes varies with different gene promoters and depends on the experimental models used (<xref rid="bib33 bib6 bib35 bib31 bib34" ref-type="bibr">Ramji et al., 1993b; Chen and Liao, 1993; Ray and Ray, 1994; Poli, 1998; Ramji and Foka, 2002</xref>).</p><p>The expression and the activity of C/EBP-&#x003b2; and -&#x003b4; are also stimulated by IL-1 and IL-6 (<xref rid="bib33 bib31 bib34" ref-type="bibr">Ramji et al., 1993b; Poli, 1998; Ramji and Foka, 2002</xref>). Unfortunately, the molecular mechanisms underlying such regulation are relatively poorly understood, particularly those relating to cytokine-induced expression, which are further restricted to the action of IL-6 (<xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">Ramji and Foka, 2002</xref>).

For example, the hepatocyte origin and pro-inflammatory cytokine responsiveness of mRNAs that were found to be upregulated in acute systemic inflammation, as judged by complete coverage of the human liver transcriptome, has been confirmed in these cells (<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">Coulouarn et al., 2004</xref>). In addition, genome-wide studies in these cells in relation to the actions of pro-inflammatory cytokines have shown proper kinetics of changes in mRNA abundances for cytokines and their receptors, transcription factors and APPs, with the overall percentage of regulated mRNAs (&#x0223c;7%) being similar to the number of liver mRNAs regulated during the APR in mouse or humans <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">Coulouarn et al., 2005</xref>).</p><p>We have previously analysed the effect of IL-1 on C/EBP&#x003b4; expression in J774.2 macrophages and glomerular mesangial cells (<xref rid="bib39 bib13" ref-type="bibr">Tengku-Muhammad et al., 2000; Granger et al., 2000</xref>) but not in Hep3B cells. This was therefore investigated by time course RT-PCR and western blot analysis. For RT-PCR, sequence analysis confirmed the specific amplification of C/EBP&#x003b4;. <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>A shows that IL-1 induces C/EBP&#x003b4; mRNA expression that peaks at 3&#x000a0;h and remains at similar or slightly reduced levels throughout the 24&#x000a0;h incubation period. Such an induction was due to IL-1 and not because of a non-specific effect of harvesting the cells at the various time-points. The expression of the C/EBP&#x003b4; protein was also induced by IL-1 at 3&#x000a0;h post-treatment and was then expressed at reduced levels over the rest of the 24&#x000a0;h period (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>B). Statistical analysis of the data from three independent experiments showed that the IL-1-induced expression of the C/EBP&#x003b4; protein (normalized to &#x003b2;-actin) was significant (<italic>P</italic>&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x000a0;0.01 at 3&#x000a0;h, 6&#x000a0;h and 12&#x000a0;h and &#x0003c;0.05 at 24&#x000a0;h). Overall, these data show that IL-1 induces C/EBP&#x003b4; mRNA and protein expression in Hep3B cells, which is consistent with the previously noted activation of C/EBP&#x003b4; expression in the liver during experimentally induced inflammation in rodents (<xref rid="bib1 bib22" ref-type="bibr">Alam et al., 1992; Magalini et al., 1995</xref>). However, the induced levels of C/EBP&#x003b4; mRNA were maintained for a more prolonged period than the corresponding protein. This suggests that, similar to the actions of several extracellular mediators on the C/EBPs (<xref rid="bib34 bib22" ref-type="bibr">Ramji and Foka, 2002; Magalini et al., 1995</xref>), multiple mechanisms are involved in the IL-1-mediated induction of C/EBP&#x003b4; expression.</p><p>An IL-1-mediated induction of C/EBP&#x003b4; promoter activity was not observed when transient transfection assays were carried out using luciferase-based plasmids containing 1.6&#x000a0;kB of human C/EBP&#x003b4; promoter (<xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr">Sanford and DeWille, 2005</xref>) or 2.2&#x000a0;kB of mouse C/EBP&#x003b4; promoter (<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">Hutt et al., 2000</xref>) (data not shown).

IL-1 was functional in this system as it could activate the pNF-&#x003ba;B-Luc plasmid (Clontech) which contains multiple binding site of this transcription factor linked to a minimal promoter upstream of the luciferase reporter gene (data not shown). Although the precise reason(s) for the non-responsiveness of the C/EBP&#x003b4; promoter to IL-1 is currently unclear, it is possible that either the regulatory sequences for IL-1 actions reside outside those present in the DNA constructs used or a specific chromatin context is required for the response that is not present in the transfected plasmids.

Further experiments showed that such an increase in JNK phosphorylation was due to IL-1 and not because of incubation of the cells for the time period (<xref rid="app1" ref-type="sec">Fig. I in supplementary data</xref>).</p><p>The activity of JNK can be monitored using an <italic>in vitro</italic> kinase assay kit in which the ability of immunoprecipitated JNKs to phosphorylate c-Jun, its key downstream target, is determined. This assay was therefore employed to determine the action of IL-1 on JNK activity in the absence or the presence of pharmacological inhibitors. Consistent with the pattern of phospho-JNK levels (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>A), IL-1 induced the activity of the enzyme (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>B) (<italic>P</italic>&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x000a0;0.05 at 15&#x000a0;min and 30&#x000a0;min). In addition, curcumin and SP600125, but not apigenin, attenuated the IL-1-induced JNK activity (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>C) (<italic>P</italic>&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x000a0;0.001 for both curcumin and SP600125).</p></sec><sec><label>3.4</label><title>siRNA-mediated knockdown of NF-&#x003ba;B attenuates the IL-1-induced expression of C/EBP&#x003b4;</title><p>siRNA-mediated knockdown of JNK-1 and -2, the two prominent isoforms expressed in hepatocytes, or its downstream target c-Jun did not attenuate the IL-1-induced expression of the C/EBP&#x003b4; protein (<xref rid="app1" ref-type="sec">Figs. IIA-IIB in supplementary data</xref>). Similarly, siRNA-mediated knockdown of CK2-&#x003b1; and -&#x003b1;&#x02032;, two of the three catalytic subunits of this enzyme (<xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">Singh and Ramji, 2008</xref>) had no effect (<xref rid="app1" ref-type="sec">Fig. IIC in supplementary data</xref>). For JNK and CK2, the findings were confirmed at the level of C/EBP&#x003b4; mRNA expression (data not shown). Although the precise reason(s) for these results are currently unclear, it is possible that this could be because of functional redundancy between the different pathways and/or sufficient amount of residual activity being present following siRNA-mediated knockdown. Because it was not possible to simultaneously knockdown all the JNK and CK2 isoforms due to potential toxicity effects from the use of large quantities of siRNA that would be required, the role of the downstream transcription factor NF-&#x003ba;B was investigated. The expression of both the p50 and p65 NF-&#x003ba;B subunits, the two most abundant isoforms that play a key role in IL-1 signalling (<xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">Pereira and Oakley, 2008</xref>), was knocked down by transfection of Hep3B cells with siRNA against these two subunits but not GAPDH (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>A and B). The IL-1-induced expression of the C/EBP&#x003b4; protein was attenuated by knockdown of p50 and p65 expression but not by GAPDH (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>A and C). Knockdown had no effect on the expression of the &#x003b2;-actin protein (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>A). Similar results were obtained when the C/EBP&#x003b4; mRNA expression was monitored by RT-PCR (data not shown).</p><p>The IL-1-mediated activation of NF-&#x003ba;B is known to occur via a TAK-dependent or -independent manner (<xref rid="bib44" ref-type="bibr">Yao et al., 2007</xref>). siRNA-mediated knockdown of TAK1, however, failed to attenuate the IL-1-induced expression of C/EBP&#x003b4; (<xref rid="app1" ref-type="sec">Fig. III in supplementary data</xref>), thereby suggesting a potential TAK1-independent pathway.</p></sec><sec><label>3.5</label><title>The action of pharmacological inhibitors on the DNA binding activity and the trans-activation potential of NF-&#x003ba;B</title><p>Because the IL-1-induced expression of C/EBP&#x003b4; was attenuated by inhibitors of JNK and CK2 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>), the action of these on NF-&#x003ba;B-mediated transcriptional activation along with its DNA binding activity was investigated. Transfection assays using the pNF-&#x003ba;B-Luc plasmid, which contains multiple NF-&#x003ba;B binding sites linked to a luciferase reporter gene, showed that IL-1 induced its activity and this was attenuated in a statistically significant manner by both apigenin and curcumin (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>). The IL-1-mediated activation of pNF-&#x003ba;B-Luc was specific to this transcription factor because it could be attenuated by expression of a superrepressor (I&#x003ba;B&#x003b1;&#x00394;N) that inhibits NF-&#x003ba;B action (<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">Heissmeyer et al., 1999</xref>) (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>).</p><p>Time course EMSA using whole cell extracts and a radiolabelled consensus NF-&#x003ba;B binding site oligonucleotide as a probe (called &#x003ba;B oligonucleotide hereafter) showed the formation of at least five DNA&#x02013;protein complexes (labelled a&#x02013;e in <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>). From these, four of the complexes (a, c, d and e) were present in untreated cells (although signals for c and d were generally faint) and induced to varying degrees by IL-1 treatment. On the other hand, complex b was entirely induced by IL-1 treatment. The induction of NF-&#x003ba;B was transient, being apparent 5&#x000a0;min post-IL-1 treatment and decreased at 180&#x000a0;min. Further experiments focused on the 15&#x000a0;min time point where a marked IL-1 induced NF-&#x003ba;B activity was observed.</p><p>A similar profile of DNA&#x02013;protein interactions was observed with both nuclear and whole cell extracts, thereby ruling out the possibility that the previously noted induction of NF-&#x003ba;B activity was peculiar to the use of whole cell extracts for EMSA (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref>A). The specificity of DNA&#x02013;protein complexes was analysed by competition EMSA and showed attenuation by pre-incubation of the extracts with a 250-fold molar excess of the unlabelled &#x003ba;B oligonucleotide but not by that containing the unrelated AP-1 binding site (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref>B). The potential involvement of p50 and the p65 subunits, the major components of NF-&#x003ba;B in several modes of regulation (<xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">Pereira and Oakley, 2008</xref>), was investigated using antibody supershift/interference EMSA with non-immune serum serving as a control. Pre-incubation with the anti-p50 NF-&#x003ba;B antibody resulted in the formation of a slower migrating antibody-DNA-protein supershift complex, complete inhibition of complex b, and partial inhibition of complex a (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref>B). On the other hand, pre-incubation with the anti-p65 antibody interfered with the formation of complexes a and d (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref>B). These results suggest that, consistent with the data for siRNA-mediated knockdown (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>), both p50 and p65 were involved in DNA&#x02013;protein interactions. Finally, the IL-1-induced NF-&#x003ba;B binding was attenuated by pre-treatment of the cells with apigenin or curcumin. Densitometric analysis showed that the induction of NF-&#x003ba;B binding by IL-1 was significant (<italic>P</italic>&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x000a0;0.05) along with the attenuation of this by curcumin and apigenin (<italic>P</italic>&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x000a0;0.01 and 0.05, respectively). Thus, similar to the previously noted effect on trans-activation (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>), apigenin and curcumin also attenuate the IL-1-induced NF-&#x003ba;B DNA binding.</p></sec></sec><sec><label>4</label><title>Discussion</title><p>Circulating levels of several APP are elevated during inflammation and inflammatory disorders such as cardiovascular disease in response to increased transcription of these genes in hepatocytes by cytokines such as IL-1 (<xref rid="bib32 bib33 bib3 bib26 bib34 bib28" ref-type="bibr">Ramji et al., 1993a,b; Baumann and Gauldie, 1994; Moshage, 1997; Ramji and Foka, 2002; Packard and Libby, 2008</xref>). Although the C/EBPs play crucial roles in such regulation, the mechanisms underlying the actions of cytokines on these transcription factors remain poorly understood (<xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">Ramji and Foka, 2002</xref>). We show here that IL-1 induces the expression of C/EBP&#x003b4; mRNA and protein in Hep3B cells (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>) and this was attenuated by inhibitors of JNK, CK2 and NF-&#x003ba;B (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>). siRNA-mediated knockdown of the p50 and p65 NF-&#x003ba;B subunits attenuated the IL-1 induced expression of C/EBP&#x003b4; (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>). IL-1 stimulated NF-&#x003ba;B DNA binding and trans-activation, which was attenuated by inhibitors of CK2 and JNK (<xref rid="fig5 fig6 fig7" ref-type="fig">Figs. 5&#x02013;7</xref>). Although a role for JNK in IL-1-induced expression of C/EBP&#x003b4; expression in hepatocytes, as judged by inhibition of the response in HepG2 cells by SP600125, has been reported (<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">Dong et al., 2007</xref>), our studies also show important and novel roles for CK2 and NF-&#x003ba;B.</p><p>The association of the JNK pathway in the control of inflammation is well established and recent studies have also suggested an important role for CK2 (<xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">Singh and Ramji, 2008</xref>). In addition, these two pathways have also been implicated in IL-1 signalling (<xref rid="bib27 bib37" ref-type="bibr">O&#x02019;Neill and Greene, 1998; Singh and Ramji, 2008</xref>). For example, IL-1 has been shown to activate CK2 in intestinal epithelial cells and inhibition of this enzyme attenuates the expression of several genes induced by this cytokine (<xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">Parhar et al., 2007</xref>). Although inhibitors of JNK and CK2 attenuated the IL-1-induced expression of C/EBP&#x003b4; (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>), no such effect was observed following siRNA-mediated knockdown of JNK-1/2 and CK2-&#x003b1;/&#x003b1;&#x02032; (e.g. <xref rid="app1" ref-type="sec">Fig. II in supplementary data</xref>). The precise reasons for these results are currently unclear but could be due to functional redundancy between the pathways. Indeed, such functional redundancy is relatively common in signalling cascades involved in the regulation of gene expression as multiple pathways often regulate key transcription factors such as NF-&#x003ba;B (<xref rid="bib25 bib21" ref-type="bibr">Mestre et al., 2001; Lowell et al., 1994</xref>). In addition, as siRNA-mediated depletion of a target protein only leads to a knockdown of expression, any remaining protein could function to compensate for its reduced expression.</p><p>Five NF-&#x003ba;B members exist in mammalian cells [RelA (p65), RelB, c-Rel, p50/p105 (NF-&#x003ba;B1) and p52/p100 (NF-&#x003ba;B2) (<xref rid="bib23 bib30" ref-type="bibr">May and Ghosh, 1997; Pereira and Oakley, 2008</xref>). The p50 and p52 subunits are produced by proteolytic processing of precursor proteins (p105 and p100, respectively) (<xref rid="bib23 bib30" ref-type="bibr">May and Ghosh, 1997; Pereira and Oakley, 2008</xref>). Transcriptional regulation by this family is complex in part due to extensive dimerization between the different proteins (<xref rid="bib23 bib30" ref-type="bibr">May and Ghosh, 1997; Pereira and Oakley, 2008</xref>). RelA (p65), RelB and c-Rel contain a potent transcriptional activation domain at the carboxyl terminus (<xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">May and Ghosh, 1997</xref>). Although p50 and p52 lack these domains, activation by p50 homodimers has been demonstrated (<xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">May and Ghosh, 1997</xref>). Our studies show a crucial role for p50 and p65 in the IL-1-induced C/EBP&#x003b4; expression. Both these subunits were involved in DNA&#x02013;protein interactions, and IL-1 activated NF-&#x003ba;B DNA binding and trans-activation, which was attenuated by curcumin and apigenin (<xref rid="fig5 fig6 fig7" ref-type="fig">Figs. 5&#x02013;7</xref>). Whether the action of these inhibitors on NF-&#x003ba;B is direct or a secondary response to inhibition of JNK and CK2 is currently unclear. However, cross-talk between JNK and NF-&#x003ba;B is relatively common (<xref rid="bib41" ref-type="bibr">Wullaert et al., 2006</xref>). In addition, IL-1 has been found to increase the association of CK2 and NF-&#x003ba;B (<xref rid="bib4 bib37" ref-type="bibr">Bird et al., 1997; Singh and Ramji, 2008</xref>). Furthermore, CK2 has been found to regulate the trans-activation potential of the p65 subunit along with other components of this pathway (<xref rid="bib4 bib29 bib37" ref-type="bibr">Bird et al., 1997; Parhar et al., 2007; Singh and Ramji, 2008</xref>). For example, CK2-mediated phosphorylation of I&#x003ba;B&#x003b1; facilitates its degradation, thereby leading to stimulation of transcription of NF-&#x003ba;B gene targets (<xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">Singh and Ramji, 2008</xref>).</p><p>In conclusion, we show here for the first time that NF-&#x003ba;B plays a crucial role in the IL-1 induced expression of C/EBP&#x003b4;, a key transcription factor in the activation of APP gene transcription. JNK and CK2 were also involved in the response and modulated the IL-1-induced trans-activation and DNA binding by NF-&#x003ba;B. The studies therefore provide novel insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying the IL-1-mediated induction of APP gene transcription in hepatocytes.</p></sec><sec

Panel B shows the p50:&#x003b2;-actin or the p65:&#x003b2;-actin ratios (mean&#x000a0;&#x000b1;&#x000a0;SD), as determined by densitometric scanning of signals from three independent experiments, with the ratio from GAPDH siRNA transfected cells being arbitrarily assigned as 1. Panel C displays the C/EBP&#x003b4;:&#x003b2;-actin ratio with that from IL-1 treated, GAPDH siRNA transfected cells being arbitrarily assigned as 1 with the others represented to this value.

The cells were transfected with the pNF-&#x003ba;B-Luc plasmid either alone (experiments involving curcumin or apigenin where DMSO was used as a vehicle control), or along with pcDNA3 control vector or the NF-&#x003ba;B superrepressor (I&#x003ba;B&#x003b1;&#x00394;N). The cells were then either left untreated or incubated for 3&#x000a0;h with 100&#x000a0;U/ml IL-1 (the inhibitors were added 1&#x000a0;h before the addition of IL-1). The luciferase activity in cell extracts was then determined and normalized to the total protein concentration. In each case, the normalized luciferase activity in untreated cells was arbitrarily assigned as 1 (not shown) with those from IL-1 treated cells represented as Fold induction.

EMSA was carried out using either whole cell extracts (WCE in panel A and all samples in panels B and C) or nuclear extracts (NE in panel A) from Hep3B cells that were either left untreated (&#x02212;) or incubated with 100&#x000a0;U/ml of IL-1 for 15&#x000a0;min (+ and all samples in panel B). Competition assays in panel B included either no competitor (none) or a 250-molar excess of the &#x003ba;B binding site oligonucleotide (NF-&#x003ba;B) or that containing the AP-1 binding site (AP-1). Panel B also shows the outcome of antibody interference assays using non-immune serum (NIS) or antiserum against the p50 or p65 isoform of NF-&#x003ba;B as indicated. For panel C, curcumin (Cur; 50&#x000a0;&#x003bc;M) or apigenin (Api; 40&#x000a0;&#x003bc;M) were added to the cells 1&#x000a0;h before the addition of IL-1 and DMSO was used as a vehicle control. The different DNA&#x02013;protein complexes are labelled a&#x02013;e (the free probe has migrated off the gel). In panel B, ss p50 shows the antibody-DNA-protein supershift complex produced by the p50 antibody, and the potential proteins involved in the formation of each complex, as judged from antibody interference assays, are indicated on the right side (? indicates members other than p50 or p65).
