In this study, we further investigated the mechanism by which cyclin G1 transcriptionally activates cyclin B1. Deletion or point mutations within the cyclin B1 promoter region revealed that the c-Myc binding site (E-box) is necessary for cyclin G1-mediated transcriptional activation of cyclin B1 to occur. In addition, the kinase activity of Cdk5 was increased by cyclin G1 overexpression, and Cdk5 directly phosphorylated c-Myc on Ser-62. Furthermore, cyclin G1 mediated increased radiosensitivity, and radiation-induced M phase arrest was attenuated when RNA interference of Cdk5 was treated. Taken together, the results of this study indicate that Cdk5 activation in cells that overexpress cyclin G1 leads to c-Myc phosphorylation on Ser-62, which is responsible for cyclin G1-mediated transcriptional activation of cyclin B1.</p></abstract></article-meta><notes><fn-group><fn><p><italic>Author's Choice</italic>&#x02014;Final version full access.</p></fn><fn id="fn1"><label>*</label><p>This work was supported by the <grant-sponsor>Korea Science</grant-sponsor> and <grant-sponsor>Engineering Foundation</grant-sponsor> and the <grant-sponsor>Ministry of Education, Science, and Technology</grant-sponsor> through the <grant-sponsor>National Nuclear Technology Program</grant-sponsor>.

Therefore, both the G<sub>1</sub>/S and G<sub>2</sub>/M checkpoints are important for maintaining genomic stability, as well as for maintaining the fidelity of transmission of intact genomes to cellular progeny (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref>). The eventual target of the G<sub>2</sub>/M entry checkpoint is the mitotic kinase Cdc2-cyclin B1, which governs most of the processes involved in mitotic initiation and progression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref>). Cyclin protein levels oscillate during the cell cycle, with B-type cyclins appearing during the S phase and accumulating in G<sub>2</sub> and mitosis before disappearing during the transition from metaphase to anaphase. Synthesis of cyclin B1 during the cell cycle is regulated primarily at the transcriptional level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref>) by a cell cycle-dependent element (CDE)<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4">3</xref> and cell cycle gene homology region (CHR) tandem element (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref>). Transcription of Cdc25C, cyclin A, and the Cdc2 gene causes CDE/CHR elements to repress transcription during the early phases of the cell cycle; however, relief from this repression later in S and G<sub>2</sub> leads to their expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref>). Furthermore, although degradation by ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis leads to a large drop in cyclin B1 protein levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref>), it has been reported that an E-box is involved in the transcriptional regulation of cyclin B1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref>). Moreover, a recent report has provided evidence that the cyclin B1 promoter is also subject to activation by c-Myc, as demonstrated by the binding of c-Myc to the activating E-box (CACGTG) of cyclin B1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref>). However, the exact upstream mechanisms that cause c-Myc to bind to the E-box of the cyclin B1 promoter region during cell cycle regulation have not yet been defined.</p><p>An enhancer E-box can be defined as a transcriptional homograph, which is a short DNA element with the ability to dispense different transcriptional outputs depending upon the features of the sequence and cellular environment. For example, by recruiting the proto-oncogene c-Myc, an E-box can drive cells to become growth factor-independent, to speed through G<sub>1</sub> of the cell cycle, to avoid differentiation, or to undergo apoptotic death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref>). The perplexing diversity of E-box-dependent processes has fueled an intense search for trans-acting factors regulating a given E-box. Predictably, such efforts have resulted in an ever expanding list of transcription factors that can recognize E-box binding factors, including c-Myc, Arnt, Max, and MyoD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">19</xref>).</p><p>Temporal regulation of c-Myc protein accumulation is essential for normal cell proliferation to occur, and deregulation of the c-<italic>myc</italic> oncogene is often observed in human cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">20</xref>). In addition, c-Myc protein overexpression can immortalize cells, reduce their growth factor requirements, promote cell cycle progression, and inhibit differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref21">21</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref23">23</xref>). c-Myc protein is stabilized after activation of several signal transduction pathways that inhibit glycogen synthase kinase-3&#x003b2; (GSK-3&#x003b2;), such as the Raf-MEK-ERK kinase cascade or the PI3K (phosphatidylinositol-3-OH kinase)-Akt pathway. The ERK and GSK-3&#x003b2; kinases phosphorylate two sites, Ser-62 and Thr-58, respectively, which are near the amino terminus of c-Myc and are highly conserved in all mammalian c-Myc isofoms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref24">24</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref27">27</xref>). These phosphorylation sites exert opposing control of c-Myc degradation through the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref27">27</xref>). In response to a growth-stimulatory signal, transcription of the c-<italic>myc</italic> gene is increased and newly synthesized c-Myc protein is phosphorylated on the Ser-62 residue, which results in its stabilization. Phosphorylation at Ser-62 is also required for the subsequent phosphorylation of c-Myc at Thr-58 by GSK-3&#x003b2;, which is associated with c-Myc degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref26">26</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref28">28</xref>). Thr-58 phosphorylation contributes to degradation of c-Myc through the ubiquitin pathway, whereas mutation of Thr-58 to alanine results in a stable and more oncogenic c-Myc protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref27">27</xref>).</p><p>Cyclin G1, one of the target genes of p53, has been studied to determine its role as it relates to p53 activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref30">30</xref>). However, recent observations suggest that cyclin G1 might be involved in various activities that are not associated with p53. Cyclin G1 is associated with cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (Cdk5) and non-Cdk-serine/threonine kinase, which is also known as cyclin G-associated kinase (GAK) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref32">32</xref>). In addition, because of its overexpression in human tumor cells, it has been suggested that cyclin G1 acts as an oncogenic protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref33">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref34">34</xref>). Conversely, cyclin G1 is also involved in G<sub>2</sub>/M phase arrest in response to DNA damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref35">35</xref>) and in the facilitation of tumor necrosis factor-induced apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref36">36</xref>), indicating that it has a tumor-suppressing function. Despite these findings, there is limited understanding of the biochemical function of cyclin G1 when it is complexed with associated partners or of the molecular function of its associated partners.</p><p>In a previous study, we found that cyclin G1 was overexpressed in lung cancer tissues but that it regulated cyclin B1 at the transcriptional level, independently of p53. In addition, in that study, cyclin G1 was found to overcome radiation-induced G<sub>2</sub> arrest, resulting in increased radiation sensitivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref37">37</xref>). In this study, we further describe the mechanisms of cyclin G1-mediated transcriptional activation of cylcin B1. Cyclin G1 interacted with Cdk5, which in turn induced kinase activation of Cdk5. Active Cdk5 then phosphorylated c-Myc on Ser-62, and the phosphorylated c-Myc then bound directly to the E-box promoter region of cyclin B1, resulting in increased cyclin B1 promoter activity.</p><sec sec-type="methods"><title>EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES</title><p><italic>Reagents</italic>&#x02014;Nocodazole was purchased from Sigma.

However, siRNA treatment of cyclin G1 reversed this phenomenon (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1<italic>A</italic></xref>, <italic>Si-Cyclin G1</italic>). Because a previous study had indicated that overexpression of cyclin G1 induces cyclin B1 at the transcriptional level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref37">37</xref>), the pathway by which cyclin G1 regulates the transcription activity of cyclin B1 was evaluated. Deletion or point mutations within the cyclin B1 promoter region revealed that increased cyclin B1 promoter activity in cells that overexpressed cyclin G1 was diminished by transfection of additional genes containing mutation of the E-box site in the cyclin B1 promoter region, which is the c-Myc binding site (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1<italic>B</italic></xref>, <italic>top</italic>). In addition, the level of promoter activity was found to be similar to that of Si-cyclin G1-transfected cells (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1<italic>B</italic></xref>, <italic>bottom</italic>). However, the transfection of point mutants containing CDE or CHR sites, which are the cell cycle-dependent transcriptional elements in the cyclin B1 promoter, did not affect the transcriptional activity of cyclin B1 in cells that overexpressed cyclin G1. Furthermore, in cells that overexpressed cyclin G1, the transcription activity of cyclin B1 was unaffected by transfection of deletion mutants containing NF-Y (&#x00394;NF-Y2 and &#x00394;NF-Y3), which are the dominant activating elements in the cyclin B1 promoter (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1<italic>B</italic></xref>, <italic>top</italic>).

Therefore, we evaluated c-Myc expression to determine whether it was related to the cyclin G1-mediated transcriptional activation of cyclin B1. Treatment of cells that overexpressed cyclin G1 with Si-c-Myc inhibited cyclin B1 protein levels as well as its promoter activity, suggesting that cyclin G1-mediated c-Myc expression was involved in the promoter activation of cyclin B1 by cyclin G1 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2, <italic>A</italic> and <italic>B</italic></xref>). Furthermore, the increased DNA binding activity that was observed when an E-box probe was added to cyclin G1-transfected cell lysates was reduced by treatment with Si-c-Myc, and when cells that had been treated with a mutant E-box probe were used, the DNA binding activity disappeared completely (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2<italic>C</italic></xref>).</p><p><italic>Increased Protein Stability of c-Myc by Cyclin G1</italic>&#x02014;The mRNA level of c-Myc in cells that overexpress cyclin G1 did not change (supplemental Fig. 1). Therefore, we examined whether <italic>de novo</italic> protein synthesis or the protein stability of c-Myc was affected by cyclin G1. The half-life of c-Myc following treatment with cycloheximide was increased by cyclin G1 overexpression when compared with that of control MFG cells (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3<italic>A</italic></xref>). However, when we examined c-Myc protein synthesis using [<sup>35</sup>S]methionine, no differences were observed between the control vector and cyclin G1-transfected cells (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3<italic>B</italic></xref>), which suggests that cyclin G1 affects c-Myc protein stability.</p><p><italic>Increased Phosphorylation of c-Myc on Ser-62 by Cyclin G1</italic>&#x02014;Because c-Myc stability is regulated by the phosphorylation status of Thr-58 and Ser-62 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref26">26</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref28">28</xref>), the phosphorylation of c-Myc were examined. Increased phosphorylation of c-Myc on both Ser-62 and Thr-58 was observed in cells that overexpressed cyclin G1 (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4<italic>A</italic></xref>). When the phosphorylation levels of c-Myc in the same amount of immunoprecipitated c-Myc protein were examined, expression of phospho-c-Myc on Ser-62 was found to be increased by cyclin G1 overexpression; however, no difference was observed in the expression of phospho-c-Myc on Thr-58 when control and cyclin G1-overexpressing cells were evaluated (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4<italic>B</italic></xref>). This finding suggests that cyclin G1 overexpression stabilizes the c-Myc protein via phosphorylation on Ser-62. The DNA binding activity observed when we used the E-box probe also suggests that increased DNA binding activity to the E-box probe in cells that overexpressed cyclin G1 was inhibited by the addition of antibody to phospho-c-Myc on Ser-62; however, this did not occur when antibody to phospho-c-Myc on Thr-58 was added (supplemental Fig. 2). This finding suggests that phospho-c-Myc on Ser-62 was responsible for the increased DNA binding activity to the E-box of the cyclin B1 promoter in cells that overexpressed cyclin G1. To directly test the <italic>in vivo</italic> binding activity of c-Myc to the cyclin B1 promoter, we performed chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays. Quantitative PCR and PCR data carrying the E-box DNA fragment in ChIPs of cyclin G1-overexpressing cells yielded signals for c-Myc and phospho-c-Myc (Ser-62) antibodies. However, the antibody of phospho-c-Myc (Thr-58) did not bind to the cyclin B1 promoter, and when we performed a ChIP assay of the &#x003b1;-globin promoter, no signals were detected (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4<italic>C</italic></xref>, <italic>top</italic>). Moreover, a ChIP assay conducted using the lysates of cells transfected with various point mutants revealed that transfection of plasmids encoding wild-type or phospho-c-Myc on Ser-62 resulted in direct binding to the cyclin B1 promoter region but that transfection of plasmid encoding phospho-c-Myc on Thr-58 did not (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4<italic>C</italic></xref>, <italic>bottom</italic>). Further, transfection with the point mutant containing c-Myc on Ser-62 (c-MycS62A, a phosphorylation-defective mutant) did not induce cyclin B1 protein expression or cyclin B1 promoter activity, even in the cyclin G1-overexpressing cells. However, the phospho-mimetic form still induced cyclin B1 protein expression and promoter activity in the case of c-MycS62D. Moreover, a mutation of c-Myc on Thr-58 (c-MycT58A) did not affect cyclin G1-mediated cyclin B1 protein expression or promoter activity. Additionally, transfection of c-MycT58A to cyclin G1-overexpressing cells increased cyclin B1 protein expression and its promoter activity; however, this increase was not found in the transfection of MycT58AS62A. This finding suggests that c-Myc phosphorylation on Ser-62 is important for increased cyclin B1 promoter activity by cyclin G1 (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4<italic>D</italic></xref>). Protein stability was increased following cycloheximide treatment of c-MycS62D- or c-MycT58A-transfected cells, even though these cells showed a shortened half-life (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4<italic>E</italic></xref>), which indicates that phosphorylation of c-Myc on Ser-62 by cyclin G1 overexpression increased the protein stability of c-Myc, as well as the binding activity of the E-box region of the cyclin B1 promoter. However, the phospho-defective form of c-Myc increased the protein stability of Thr-58.</p><p><fig position="float" id="fig3"><label>FIGURE 3.</label><caption><p><bold>Increased protein stability of c-Myc by cyclin G1.</bold><italic>A</italic>, protein extracts were prepared at the indicated time points following cycloheximide treatment (20 &#x003bc;g/ml) of MFG control and cyclin G1-overexpressing NCI-H460 cells.

In addition, treatment of the cells with Si-Cdk5 or Sicyclin G1 inhibited this kinase activity when c-Myc protein was used as a substrate. Increased phosphorylation of c-Myc on Ser-62 and cyclin B1 protein expression in cyclin G1-overexpressing cells were also inhibited by treatment with Si-Cdk5 or Si-cyclin G1. This suggests that Cdk5 is involved in cyclin G1-mediated c-Myc phosphorylation and cyclin B1 expression, as well as in cyclin B1 transcriptional activity (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5, <italic>A</italic> and <italic>B</italic></xref>).

However, treatment with GST-Cdk5 protein induced c-Myc phosphorylation, and co-treatment with GST-cyclin G1 and GST-Cdk5 protein enhanced <sup>32</sup>P incorporation, which suggests that Cdk5 is responsible for c-Myc phosphorylation and co-treatment of cyclin G1 and that Cdk5 potentiates this phenomenon (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5<italic>C</italic></xref>).

Furthermore, addition of GST-cyclin G1 protein to the cell lysates of NCI-H596 resulted in a lower expression of cyclin G1, which in turn increased the level of c-Myc phosphorylation on Ser-62 via activation of Cdk5 by cyclin G1. Additionally, cell lysates that were treated with GST-Cdk5 protein showed greater c-Myc phosphorylation than those treated with only GST-cyclin G1 protein, and co-treatment with GST-cyclin G1 and GST-Cdk5 proteins dramatically increased these phenomena (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5<italic>E</italic></xref>).

Therefore, we evaluated Cdk5 to determine whether it was involved in M phase arrest and cell death. Phosphorylated histone H3, a mitosis marker, was induced by overnight nocodazole block and release for a greater length of time in cells that overexpressed cyclin G1 than in MFG control cells.

We have identified c-Myc phosphorylation on Ser-62 by Cdk5, which is a prominent partner of cyclin G1. Additionally, we have demonstrated that c-Myc phosphorylation is essential for transcriptional activation of cyclin B1 by cyclin G1 to occur. Cyclin G1 was originally identified as a novel member of the cyclin family and is one of the target genes of transcriptional factor p53 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref30">30</xref>). However, in our system, the role that cyclin G1 plays in transcriptional activation of cyclin B1 exhibited a p53-independent pattern (supplemental Fig. 4). In addition, the cyclin G1-mediated increase of cyclin B1 expression was observed in both p53 wild-type and null cells. Moreover, there are reports that p53 can repress the transcription of cyclin B1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref>), which suggests that p53 function is not involved in cyclin B1 transcription.</p><p>Cyclin G1 has been shown to play an important role in various biological phenomena (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref36">36</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref39">39</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref40">40</xref>) including apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref34">34</xref>), and the molecules that it associates with have been identified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref41">41</xref>). However, the functional consequences of cyclin G1 are still the subject of debate. For instance, transcription of cyclin G1 is induced within a few hours of growth factor stimulation of quiescent cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref42">42</xref>). In addition, retroviral vector-mediated gene transfection of antisense cyclin G1 inhibits proliferation of human osteogenic sarcoma cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref43">43</xref>), which suggests that cyclin G1 plays a pivotal role in mammalian cell growth regulation. Conversely, some data suggest that cyclin G1 has growth-inhibitory activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref36">36</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref39">39</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref44">44</xref>). Furthermore, a recent study concluded that a low level of cyclin G1 results in a lack of growth-inhibitory activity and may even promote growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref37">37</xref>), whereas high levels of cyclin G1 suppress growth activity.</p><p>Previously, we found that cyclin G1 increases radiation-induced M phase arrest and cell death as a result of increased cyclin B1 promoter activity. Synthesis of cyclin B1 during the cell cycle is regulated primarily at the transcriptional level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref37">37</xref>), and cell cycle-related transcription by this promoter is regulated by a CDE and CHR tandem element (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref>). However, the cyclin B1 promoter is also subject to activation by c-Myc.</p><p>Here, we have demonstrated that cells that overexpress cyclin G1 increased the promoter activity of cyclin B1 through activation of the E-box, which suggests that activation of the cyclin B1 promoter by cyclin G1 is dependant on c-Myc (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>). Indeed, in our system, cyclin G1 overexpression increased the c-Myc protein level (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>). However, levels of c-Myc mRNA and c-Myc protein synthesis were not altered by cyclin G1, but the protein stability of c-Myc was increased (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>). Therefore, we evaluated the phosphorylation status of c-Myc to determine whether it was affected by cyclin G1. It has been reported that phosphorylation sites Thr-58 and Ser-62 are associated with c-Myc degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref24">24</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref27">27</xref>), and in this study we observed that cyclin G1 increased c-Myc phosphorylation on Ser-62. However, increased phosphorylation of c-Myc on Thr-58 in cells that overexpressed cyclin G1 was not the direct consequence of overexpression of cyclin G1 (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>). Phosphorylation of c-Myc on Ser-62 is regulated by ERK1/2 activation, and GSK-3&#x003b2; is involved in c-Myc phosphorylation on Thr-58. Nevertheless, because cyclin G1 overexpression did not affect the status of ERK1/2 and GSK-3&#x003b2; phosphorylation (supplemental Fig. 5), we excluded c-Myc phosphorylation by ERK1/2 or GSK-3. Although the mechanism by which phospho-c-Myc on Thr-58 increased by cyclin G1 is unclear, it is possible that increased phospho-c-Myc on Ser-62 affected the stability of phospho-c-Myc on Thr-58. Indeed, when we examined the half-life of the phospho-mimetic (c-MycT58D) or phospho-defective (c-MycT58A) forms of c-Myc on Thr-58, c-MycT58A was found to have greater stability than c-MycT58D (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>). In our system, the phospho form of c-Myc on Ser-62 was found to increase the binding activity of the cyclin B1 promoter region. It has been reported that c-Myc phosphorylation on Ser-62 and Thr-58 has no impact on the transcriptional activity of E-box-containing promoters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref45">45</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref47">47</xref>). However, several studies have suggested that phosphorylation of c-Myc enhances the transcriptional activity of its target genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref48">48</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref49">49</xref>). Our data also suggest that phosphorylation of c-Myc on Ser-62, but not on Thr-58, affects its ability to bind to the E-box of cyclin B1 (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>). It is not clear why only phospho-c-Myc on Ser-62 enhanced the promoter activity of cyclin B1; however, it has been shown that c-MycS62A fails to be recruited to the E-box site of &#x003b3;-glutamyl cysteine synthetase promoter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref48">48</xref>), which is similar to the results of this study.</p><p><fig position="float" id="fig8"><label>FIGURE 8.</label><caption><p><bold>Hypothetical scheme of Cdk5-mediated c-Myc phosphorylation on Ser-62 in cyclin G1-overexpressing cells.</bold> Cdk5, the binding partner of cyclin G1, was responsible for c-Myc phosphorylation on Ser-62, and this stable form of phosphorylated c-Myc then bound to the E-box promoter region of cyclin B1, which resulted in increased radiation-induced M phase arrest and cell death in cyclin G1-overexpressing cells.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="zbc0270839900008"></graphic></fig></p><p>Cyclin G1 does not have kinase activity; therefore, we evaluated binding partners of cyclin G1, such as Cdk5, to determine whether they were involved in c-Myc phosphorylation.

In addition, an <italic>in vitro</italic> kinase assay revealed that Cdk5 alone induced c-Myc phosphorylation and that additional treatment with cyclin G1 potentiated this phenomenon, whereas cyclin G1 alone did not (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>). Furthermore, the results of this study revealed an interaction between c-Myc and Cdk5 (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>), which suggests that this interaction was important for the phosphorylation of c-Myc by Cdk5 to occur.</p><p>We previously reported that cyclin G1 was overexpressed in cancer tissues, including cancerous lung tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref37">37</xref>). In this study, the cyclin G1 levels in several lung cancer cell lines were found to be well correlated with c-Myc phosphorylation on Ser-62, as well as with cyclin B1 expression, both of which were mediated by Cdk5 (supplemental Fig. 6). Taken together, these results suggest that the cyclin B1 expression level in cyclin G1-overexpressing cancer cells was controlled by Cdk5. It has been shown that cyclin G1 overexpression results in increased radiation sensitivity as a result of the increased transition from the G<sub>2</sub> to M phase, which occurs due to cyclin B1 promoter activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref37">37</xref>). In this study, inhibition of Cdk5 by siRNA treatment was found to reduce radiation-induced G<sub>2</sub>/M phase arrest and cell death in cyclin G1-overexpressing cells. This suggests that Cdk5-mediated activation of c-Myc phosphorylation on Ser-62, which is responsible for the transcriptional activation of cyclin B1, is essential for increased radiation sensitivity by cyclin G1 (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref>).</p><p>In conclusion, the results of this study provide an explanation for the mechanism by which cyclin G1 regulates cyclin B1 promoter activity. We propose that Cdk5, the binding partner of cyclin G1, is responsible for c-Myc phosphorylation on Ser-62 and that this phosphorylated c-Myc has an increased protein half-life and binds to the E-box promoter region of cyclin B1. Further, we suggest that these effects result in increased cyclin B1 promoter activation in cyclin G1-overexpressing cells, which are frequently observed in cancer cells (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8</xref>).</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material id="PMC_1" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>[Supplemental Data]</title></caption><media mimetype="text" mime-subtype="html" xlink:href="M800987200_index.html"/><media xlink:role="associated-file" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="M800987200_1.pdf"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ref-list><ref id="ref1"><label>1</label><citation citation-type="journal">Hartwell, L.
