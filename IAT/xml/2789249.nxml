Linkage of bipolar disorder and recurrent major depression with markers on chromosome 4p15&#x02013;p16 has been identified in a large Scottish family and three smaller families. Analysis of haplotypes in the four chromosome 4p-linked families, identified two regions, each shared by three of the four families, which are also supported by a case-control association study. The candidate gene <italic>phosphatidylinositol 4-kinase type-II beta</italic> (<italic>PI4K2B</italic>) lies within one of these regions. <italic>PI4K2B</italic> is a strong functional candidate as it is a member of the phosphatidylinositol pathway, which is targeted by lithium for therapeutic effect in bipolar disorder. Two approaches were undertaken to test the <italic>PI4K2B</italic> candidate gene as a susceptibility factor for psychiatric illness. First, a case-control association study, using tagging SNPs from the <italic>PI4K2B</italic> genomic region, in bipolar disorder (<italic>n</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;368), schizophrenia (<italic>n</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;386) and controls (<italic>n</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;458) showed association with a two-marker haplotype in schizophrenia but not bipolar disorder (rs10939038 and rs17408391, global <italic>P</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.005, permuted global <italic>P</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.039). Second, expression studies at the allele-specific mRNA and protein level using lymphoblastoid cell lines from members of the large Scottish family, which showed linkage to 4p15&#x02013;p16 in bipolar disorder and recurrent major depression, showed no difference in expression differences between affected and non-affected family members. There is no evidence to suggest that <italic>PI4K2B</italic> is contributing to bipolar disorder in this family but a role for this gene in schizophrenia has not been excluded.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Bipolar disorder</kwd><kwd>Chromosome 4p15</kwd><kwd><italic>PI4K2B</italic></kwd><kwd>Phosphatidylinositol pathway</kwd><kwd>Association</kwd><kwd>Expression studies</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec><label>1</label><title>Objectives</title><p>Genetic evidence for psychiatric illness, including bipolar disorder, schizophrenia and related phenotypes to chromosome 4p15&#x02013;p16, has been established in linkage, population and affected individual studies as detailed previously (<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">Le Hellard et al., 2007</xref>). Haplotype analysis of chromosome 4p15&#x02013;p16 using four families with linkage to that region, highlighted two areas in the 20&#x000a0;Mb linked region, where three of the four linkage regions overlap, namely region B and region D (<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">Le Hellard et al., 2007</xref>). These regions have been supported by association analysis in the Scottish population (<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">Christoforou et al., 2007</xref>). Region D appeared an attractive region for further study because of the strength of the linkage evidence from a Welsh family with schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorder (LOD 2, (<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">Asherson et al., 1998</xref>)) and a large family from the United States of Ashkenazi Jewish origin with major mental illness including bipolar disorder and schizophrenia (LOD 3.2, (<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">Detera-Wadleigh et al., 1999</xref>)). Of the 13 known genes in region D (<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">Le Hellard et al., 2007</xref>), <italic>PI4K2B</italic> has the strongest case as a candidate gene from biological and neuropharmacological evidence. In addition, the aforementioned association study identified SNP rs10939038, which lies in the same linkage disequilibrium (LD) block as <italic>PI4K2B</italic>, as a potentially important variant in schizophrenia cases (allele <italic>P</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.006, odds ratio (OR)&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;1.314, 95%CI: 1.08&#x02013;1.59) (<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">Christoforou et al., 2007</xref>).</p><p><italic>PI4K2B</italic> is a phosphatidylinositol 4-kinase and a member of the phosphoinositide (PI) signal transduction pathway.

Details of this sample have been previously reported (<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">Christoforou et al., 2007</xref>). The study was approved by the Multi-Centre Research Ethics Committee for Scotland. The sample comprised individuals contacted through the inpatient and outpatient services of hospitals in South East Scotland. Diagnoses according to DSM-IV criteria were based on information from an interview with the patient using the Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia-Life time version (SADS-L) were reached by consensus between two trained psychiatrists. Controls from the same region were recruited through the South of Scotland Blood Transfusion Service and from hospital staff. Control subjects were drawn from the same population in South East and South Central Scotland. The majority (&#x0003e;80%) were recruited through the Scottish National Blood Transfusion service. Although the blood donors were not screened by interview for personal or family history of psychiatric illness, donors are only allowed to donate blood if they are not currently on medication and had no chronic illness. The remaining controls were recruited from the local population and from hospital staff. These controls were briefly screened by interview to exclude anyone currently on medication or with a history of treatment for psychiatric illness.</p></sec><sec><label>2.1.2</label><title>SNP Selection</title><p>SNP genotype data from 30 CEPH trios, 100&#x000a0;kb upstream and downstream of the <italic>PI4K2B</italic> genomic region (24,745,440&#x02013;24,986,687&#x000a0;bp, NCBI build 35) from HapMap Phase II (January 2006) (<ext-link xlink:href="http://www.hapmap.org" ext-link-type="uri">http://www.hapmap.org</ext-link>) was uploaded to Haploview version 3.2 (<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">Barrett et al., 2005</xref>).

Certain members of the family have a defined haplotype on chromosome 4p15&#x02013;p16, referred to as &#x0201c;the linked haplotype&#x0201d; that segregates with the majority of cases of bipolar disorder and recurrent major depression, as described previously (<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">Le Hellard et al., 2007</xref>). RNA expression of <italic>PI4K2B</italic> was assessed in lymphoblastoid cell lines by allele-specific quantitative RT-PCR using three SNPs by Taqman technology comparing relatives with and without the &#x0201c;linked haplotype&#x0201d;. Estimation of allelic imbalance from standard curves was performed as previously described (<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">Pastinen et al., 2004</xref>). Based on the standard curves, we found that deviation from equal expression could reliably be detected from both alleles (50:50) at a 80:20 allele ratio at rs313567, a 90:10 allele ratio at rs313548 and a 70:30 allele ratio at rs6834255, respectively. The allelic imbalances observed for the heterozygote cDNA samples did not reach the detection threshold (data not shown). To detect a more sensitive difference, gDNA measurements from heterozygotes were incorporated, which represented equal expression from each allele, as a control, as previously performed (<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">Bakker et al., 2007</xref>). <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref> shows the allelic expression at rs313548 between linked haplotype carriers (<italic>n</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;13) and controls (<italic>n</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;10).

Positional evidence from linkage and association analyses have implicated this genomic region on chromosome 4p15&#x02013;p16. Genetic evidence has also suggested other members of the phosphoinositide signalling pathway as susceptibility factors for bipolar disorder, schizophrenia and recurrent major depression (<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">Kato, 2007</xref>) and components of the phosphoinositide pathway are inhibited by lithium, a therapeutic agent in bipolar disorder (<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">Berridge et al., 1989</xref>). Indeed a recent consortium has been initiated to investigate all genes involved in the lithium pathway as candidate genes for psychiatric illness (<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">Schulze et al., in press</xref>) (<ext-link xlink:href="http://www.ConLiGen.org" ext-link-type="uri">www.ConLiGen.org</ext-link>). Our study contributes to the genetic basis of psychiatric illness research by adopting a candidate gene study with two approaches; (i) an association study in 368 bipolar disorder, 386 schizophrenia and 458 Scottish participants and (ii) an expression study in lymphoblastoid cell lines from bipolar disorder and recurrent major depression members of a large Scottish family.</p><p>This study identified association between a haplotype in <italic>PI4K2B</italic>, which withstood gene-wide permutation testing, and schizophrenia, but not bipolar disorder. This improved haplotype association, relative to the original single-marker finding, may better tag the actual susceptibility variant and thus narrow the target region. If replicated, the association results may reflect association with any feature within the large &#x0003e;240&#x000a0;kb genomic region investigated, in particular <italic>PI4K2B</italic> or a neighbouring gene <italic>SLA/LP</italic>. Previous evaluation of population structure showed no evidence of population stratification in the control group, suggesting that this is unlikely to be the cause of any spurious association due to population stratification (<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">Christoforou et al., 2007</xref>).</p><p>This study of <italic>PI4K2B</italic> expression levels has shown no difference in lymphoblastoid cell line samples from bipolar disorder family members with the &#x0201c;linked haplotype&#x0201d; and those without. This was demonstrated at the allele-specific level by Taqman assays and at the protein level by quantitative immunoblotting techniques. The advantage of the Taqman method was the sensitivity obtained by comparing the linked haplotype to a series of different control alleles within the one family, using a well-validated method (<xref rid="bib2 bib17" ref-type="bibr">Bakker et al., 2007; Pastinen et al., 2004</xref>). This method could reveal the presence of cis-acting regulatory variants, which may contribute to susceptibility for bipolar disorder. <italic>Cis</italic>-acting variation has been reported to account for 25&#x02013;35% of inter-individual differences in gene expression throughout the human genome (Pastinen and Hudson, 2004). Three <italic>PI4K2B</italic> SNPs were used to measure gene expression levels, one of which was an intronic SNP to measure heteronuclear RNA as previously described (<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">Pastinen et al., 2004</xref>). Initially, standard curves of homozygote gDNA dilutions were created, to look for a deviation from the expected 1:1 allelic ratio in cDNA. Despite optimisation attempts, the standard curves did not achieve the required sensitivity to detect small differences. However, the standard curves were useful to show that a gross deviation in allele-specific expression was not present. A second method, which compared expression in cDNA to that seen in gDNA from heterozygous samples, proved more sensitive. Indeed, in the future it may be useful to investigate lymphoblastoid cell lines from schizophrenia patients for <italic>PI4K2B</italic> expression differences due to the above association study evidence.</p><p>The limitations of this expression study are the sensitivity of the technical procedures, the reduced power from the limited number of heterozygote family members with viable lymphoblastoid cell lines available and whether lymphoblastoid cell lines effectively model pathogenic processes in the brain (<xref rid="bib11 bib21" ref-type="bibr">Gladkevich et al., 2004; Tsuang et al., 2005</xref>). Studies have shown that whole blood does share significant gene expression similarities with multiple central nervous system tissues (<xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">Sullivan et al., 2006</xref>). There is also evidence to suggest that gene expression profiles and functional effects in blood lymphocytes do correlate with psychiatric illness (<xref rid="bib11 bib12 bib16 bib21 bib22" ref-type="bibr">Gladkevich et al., 2004; Iwamoto et al., 2004; Marazziti et al., 2006; Tsuang et al., 2005; Vawter et al., 2004</xref>).</p><p>This study showed that there was no direct evidence for a role of <italic>PI4K2B</italic> in susceptibility to bipolar disorder from expression studies in lymphoblastoid cell lines. Nevertheless, this candidate gene still merits further investigation to assess its potential role in psychiatric illness, because of the significant case-control association study result that withstood permutation testing.</p></sec><sec><title>Conflict of interest</title><p>All authors declare that they have no conflicts of interest.</p></sec><sec><title>Contributors</title><p>Lorna M.
