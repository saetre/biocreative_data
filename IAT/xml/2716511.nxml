There are three isoforms of HP1 in mammals: HP1&#x003b1;, &#x003b2;, and &#x003b3;. Studies have shown that the level of HP1&#x003b1; is reduced in invasive human breast cancer cell lines such as MDA-MB-231 and HS578T compared with non-invasive cell lines such as MCF7 and T47D. It is hypothesized that reduced HP1&#x003b1; expression may lead to impaired epigenetic silencing of genes that are important in the acquisition of an invasive phenotype.

Chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments verified YY1 occupancy at the HP1&#x003b1; gene promoter in MCF7 cells but not HS578T cells.

Mutations in the HP1 gene resulted in suppression of position-effect variegation, a result that implicated HP1 in chromatin structure and gene expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Mutation of the gene encoding HP1 in <italic>Drosophila </italic>resulted in larval lethality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Examination of HP1 mutant embryos revealed defects in chromosome segregation and telomere maintenance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. Therefore, HP1 is thought to play an essential role in heterochromatin-dependent processes in <italic>Drosophila</italic>. HP1 can also be found in certain euchromatic loci, implying its role in euchromatic regions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>].</p><p>HP1 homologues have been identified in a variety of organisms including yeast, nematodes, insects, chickens, frogs, and mammals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. There are three HP1 isoforms in mammals: HP1&#x003b1;, &#x003b2; and &#x003b3; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Each HP1 isoform has a different chromosomal distribution. HP1&#x003b1; is located mainly in heterochromatic regions, HP1&#x003b2; is found in both heterochromatic and euchromatic regions, and HP1&#x003b3; is located almost exclusively in euchromatic regions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. The localization of HP1 isoforms to different regions of chromatin implies that each isoform plays a unique role in chromatin structure and transcriptional regulation.</p><p>All HP1 family members share a similar structure: an amino-terminal chromodomain (CD), a variable hinge region and a carboxy-terminal chromoshadow domain (CSD) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. HP1 associates with chromatin primarily through the CD, which binds to the histone-fold domain of histone H3 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. This interaction is stimulated by methylation of the H3 histone tail on lysine 9 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. It has therefore been suggested that the repressive effect of H3K9 methylation is mediated, in part, by HP1. HP1&#x003b1; can also interact with histone H1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. In addition, RNA may play a role in targeting HP1&#x003b1; to pericentric heterochromatin by interacting with the hinge region [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. An interaction between HP1&#x003b1; and the histone variant H2A.Z may contribute to the compaction of heterochromatic domains [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. However, the mechanism by which different isoforms of HP1 occupy distinct regions of chromatin remains unclear.</p><p>Although HP1 associates with chromatin via the CD, the CSD of HP1 can mediate interactions with a number of different proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. The CSD can bind HP1 itself, allowing HP1 to hetero- and homo-dimerize [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. This interaction is thought to contribute to the compaction of heterochromatic domains. The CSD can also bind the histone methyltransferase SUV39H1, an interaction that may facilitate spreading of heterochromatin to adjacent loci [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. The CSD mediates the interaction between HP1 and the co-repressor KAP-1 (TIF1&#x003b2;, KRIP1), which can result in mitotically-heritable gene silencing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. Interaction between HP1&#x003b1; and &#x003b3; and the TFIID subunit TAF4 (TAF<sub>II</sub>130) is also mediated by the CSD and may be responsible for dissociation of TAF4 from promoter regions upon HP1 binding [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. The ability of the CSD to associate with such a functionally diverse group of proteins suggests that HP1 exerts its effects on gene expression through a variety of mechanisms.</p><p>It has been reported that HP1&#x003b1; expression is reduced in invasive human breast cancer cell lines such as HS578T and MDA-MB-231 compared with non-invasive breast cancer cell lines such as MCF7 and T47D [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. Over-expression of HP1&#x003b1; in the invasive cell line MDA-MB-231 reduced its <italic>in vitro </italic>invasive potential [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. Reducing the expression of HP1&#x003b1; in MCF7 cells increased their invasive potential without affecting their rate of growth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. This data suggests that HP1&#x003b1; acts as a metastasis suppressor in breast cancer cells. In addition, reduction of HP1&#x003b1; expression has been observed in metastatic colon cancer cell lines compared with non-metastatic cell lines, in desmoplastic vs. classic meduloblastoma, and in papillary thyroid carcinoma compared with normal thyroid tissue [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>].</p><p>HP1&#x003b1; is one of many proteins that have been identified as metastasis suppressors. These proteins have roles in diverse cellular functions including cell adhesion and migration as well as cell signaling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. The role of HP1&#x003b1; in epigenetic gene silencing makes it a unique metastasis suppressor. A decrease in HP1&#x003b1; expression could disrupt the epigenetic program of the cell, altering gene expression at a global level. Therefore, it has been hypothesized that decreased expression of HP1&#x003b1; in breast cancer cells leads to deficient epigenetic silencing of genes that promote a metastatic phenotype. We set out to determine the mechanism by which HP1&#x003b1; expression is reduced in highly invasive breast cancer cells.</p><p>To address this question we used the MCF7 and HS578T breast cancer cell lines as models of non-invasive and invasive breast cancer, respectively. To study the transcriptional activity of the HP1&#x003b1; gene promoter in these cell lines we sub-cloned the human HP1&#x003b1; gene promoter region into a luciferase reporter construct. Using the Transcription Element Search Software (TESS) database, we identified several highly conserved transcription factor binding motifs in the HP1&#x003b1; promoter region [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. We then used site-directed mutagenesis to assess the importance of each motif in the transcriptional activity of the HP1&#x003b1; gene promoter in each cell line. Our study suggests that the transcription factor yin yang 1 (YY1) may be involved in the differential expression of HP1&#x003b1; in MCF7 and HS578T cells. In addition, we demonstrate that YY1 overexpression suppresses HS578T cell migration <italic>in vitro</italic>. We conclude that decreased YY1 expression may contribute to the invasive phenotype of metastatic breast cancer cells.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Cell culture</title><p>Cell lines were obtained from American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) and maintained in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM; Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Gemini Bio-Products, West Sacramento, CA, USA) and 1% penicillin/streptomycin/glutamine mixture (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA).

In each case, nucleotides reported to be critical for factor binding were changed. The YY1.2 mutation abolished YY1 binding (see text), and the NRF-1.3 mutation abolished NRF-1 binding as determined by electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) (data not shown).</p></sec><sec><title>Real time RT-PCR</title><p>RT-PCR was performed using the Roche LightCycler instrument.

Migration transwells (Corning, Lowell, MA, USA) and matrigel invasion chambers (BD Biosciences, Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA) were prepared according to the manufacturer's protocols. 10<sup>5 </sup>cells were used for each migration assay and 5 &#x000d7; 10<sup>4 </sup>cells for each invasion assay. Twenty-four hours later the migration and invasion chambers were cleaned with cotton-tip applicators and stained for 15 minutes in crystal violet solution (diluted 1:5 in dH<sub>2</sub>O from a stock of 2 mg/ml in methanol). The membranes were destained in dH<sub>2</sub>O and allowed to dry overnight. The stain was eluted from the migration membranes using 10% acetic acid, and the eluate was read at OD 600 nm in a Versamax microplate reader (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA, USA). The invasion membranes were removed, and mounted on slides using Permount (Fisher Scientific, Pittsburgh, PA, USA).

We used the UCSC genome browser [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>] to look for areas of sequence conservation between species in the region between the HP1&#x003b1; and HNRPA1 gene transcriptional start sites. Part of the sequence of the intergenic region is depicted in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1b</xref>. Nucleotides that are conserved between human, mouse, rat, and chimpanzee are indicated in red. Note the high degree of sequence conservation in the intergenic region. Next, we used the TESS database to identify potential transcription factor binding sites in this region (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1b</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>].

It is therefore not surprising that we identified a highly conserved E2F binding motif, as well as three highly conserved NRF-1 binding motifs.

We found that the half-life of HP1&#x003b1; mRNA is approximately 12.5 hours in both cell lines (data not shown).

We made several luciferase constructs, one containing the entire bidirectional promoter region (CbxD98) and others containing truncations of the promoter at the 5' end (CbxU283 and CbxU146; Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1b</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2a</xref>). We also explored the possibility that sequence downstream of the start site may be involved in differential expression and found the sequence to have no effect on promoter activity (data not shown). Because it is difficult to directly compare luciferase activity levels between two cell lines, we decided instead to observe differences in the trend of luciferase activity of different constructs in each cell line. Therefore, the luciferase activity of each construct in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2a</xref> is represented as a percentage of the activity of the CbxD98 construct. Truncating a portion of the promoter between -594 and -283 resulted in increased luciferase activity in both cell lines (compare CbxD98 and CbxU283 in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2a</xref>). Truncation of the sequence between -283 and -146 caused a reduction in luciferase activity. Interestingly, this reduction in luciferase activity was more pronounced in MCF7 cells than in HS578T cells (compare CbxU283 and CbxU146 in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2a</xref>).

Each mutation had an effect on the promoter activity that was comparable in both cell lines; however, the only mutation that consistently had a differential effect between the two cell lines was the mutation in the YY1.2 site (the distal YY1 site, construct M2). The YY1.2 mutation caused a more pronounced reduction in promoter activity in MCF7 cells than in HS578T cells similar to what was observed for CbxU146 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2b</xref>).

Both of the YY1-specific siRNAs were effective in reducing the level of YY1 protein (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3a</xref>).

An examination of the YY1 mRNA and protein levels showed that they are both reduced in HS578T cells compared with MCF7 cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1c, d</xref>). This is significant, because our knockdown experiment indicated that YY1 is a positive regulator of HP1&#x003b1; expression. We used gel shift experiments to determine if a lower level of YY1 expression in HS578T cells resulted in decreased binding of YY1 to the YY1.2 site <italic>in vitro</italic>. Labeled probes containing the wild type or mutant YY1.2 sequence were incubated with nuclear extract from MCF7 or HS578T cells. The YY1-specific shift was only visible when we used MCF7 nuclear extract, indicating that there was not likely to be enough YY1 in the HS578T extract to produce a visible shift (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>, compare lanes 2 and 5). The identity of the YY1-shifted species was confirmed by super-shift with an antibody against YY1 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>, lane 4 asterisk). Note the presence of a nonspecific band that was not shifted by the YY1-specific antibody. An unrelated antibody (against Ac H3K9) did not produce a super-shift (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>, lane 3). The shifted band representing the YY1 protein-DNA complex was present only when the wild type probe was used, indicating that the mutation introduced into the YY1.2 site effectively disrupted YY1 binding (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>, compare lanes 2 and 9).

Next, we wished to determine if this phenomenon also occurs at the endogenous HP1&#x003b1; gene promoter using the ChIP assay. Chromatin prepared from MCF7 and HS578T cells was immunoprecipitated using specific antibodies against YY1 or NRF-1. The HP1&#x003b1; gene promoter was previously identified as an NRF-1 target gene; thus, it served as a positive control [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>]. NRF-1 occupancy was detected at HP1&#x003b1; gene promoter in both cell lines (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5a</xref>). In contrast, YY1 occupancy at the HP1&#x003b1; gene promoter could only be detected in MCF7 cells. As a positive control for YY1 occupancy, we amplified a region in the glucocorticoid receptor gene promoter (located 2.2 kb upstream from the transcriptional start site), which contains three YY1 consensus binding motifs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>]. YY1 occupancy was detected at this region in both cell lines, indicating that YY1 DNA binding activity is not entirely absent in HS578T cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5a</xref>). As a negative control, we amplified a region 22 kb downstream of the HP1&#x003b1; gene transcriptional start site. As expected, only background signal was detected in this region. We quantified the ChIP data from several experiments and calculated the occupancy of each transcription factor as a percentage of input (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5b</xref>). From our ChIP experiments we conclude that the lower level of YY1 in HS578T cells results in reduced occupancy of YY1 at the HP1&#x003b1; gene promoter region. These studies indicate that the reduced occupancy of YY1 at the HP1&#x003b1; gene promoter in HS578T cells contributes to lower HP1&#x003b1; expression.</p><fig position="float" id="F5"><label>Figure 5</label><caption><p>YY1 occupancy at the HP1&#x003b1; gene promoter is higher in MCF7 cells than in HS578T cells. <bold>(a) </bold>Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay was performed using chromatin form MCF7 and HS578T cells.

YY1 overexpression also led to a decrease in invasive potential of these cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6b</xref>).

In past decades, much work in the cancer field has focused on identifying genetic alterations that suppress or promote these phenotypes. It has become increasingly apparent, however, that disruption of proper epigenetic mechanisms also contributes significantly to cancer development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>]. For example, expression of HP1 in prostate cancer was found to be altered compared with normal prostate tissue [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>]. It is therefore not surprising that HP1 has been linked to cancer progression in humans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>]. Although the molecular mechanism by which HP1&#x003b1; suppresses the invasive potential of breast cancer cells is unclear, it is important to understand the mechanism of reduced HP1&#x003b1; expression in invasive breast cancer cells.</p><p>In a previously published study, the DNA sequence of the HP1&#x003b1; gene in MCF7 and MDA-MB-231 was compared in order to identify any polymorphisms that may account for differential expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>]. This study found no differences in the sequence in the HP1&#x003b1; gene between these two cell lines. In addition, no difference in the pattern of DNA methylation was found in the HP1&#x003b1; gene promoter region. The investigators therefore hypothesized, as we did, that the difference in HP1&#x003b1; expression is attributable to differences in transcription factor occupancy at the promoter region in different cell lines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>].</p><p>In the previous study, as in our study, luciferase reporter assays were used to determine how HP1&#x003b1; expression is differentially regulated at the level of transcription. One of the sequence motifs that was identified by this group was an E-box site (noted in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1b</xref>). Mutation of this E-box site in the HP1&#x003b1; gene promoter construct resulted in a reduction in differential transcriptional activity between MCF7 and MDA-MB-231 cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>]. In agreement with their data, we found that mutation of the same E-box site in our CbxU283 construct caused a small increase in promoter activity in MCF7 cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2b</xref>, M4). However, we did not find that mutation of the E-box site had a differential effect on promoter activity of the CbxU283 construct between MCF7 cells and MDA-MB-231 cells (data not shown) or HS578T cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2b</xref>).</p><p>Instead, we identified transcription factor binding motifs that were not identified in the previous study, including binding motifs for NRF-1 and YY1. Although our mutagenic analysis was not exhaustive, our data suggests that NRF-1 and YY1 are both important positive regulators in the expression of HP1&#x003b1;. Mutating both the distal NRF-1 and YY1 sites (NRF-1.3 and YY1.2) resulted in a drastic reduction in promoter activity (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2b</xref>, M6). This result is supported by previously reported NRF-1 knockdown experiments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>], and by the YY1 knockdown data in this study (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3b</xref>). YY1 has been implicated in the expression of many genes with numerous functions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>]. However, this is the first report to show that YY1 regulates HP1&#x003b1; expression. The role of YY1 as a positive regulator of HP1&#x003b1; expression implicates YY1 as an important gene in maintaining the cellular epigenetic program.</p><p>Our mutagenic analysis of the HP1&#x003b1; gene promoter region also revealed a possible role for YY1 in differential expression between MCF7 and HS578T cells. We found that the level of YY1 RNA and protein is higher in MCF7 cells than in HS578T cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1c, d</xref>). Our ChIP data show that YY1 occupancy at the HP1&#x003b1; promoter region is much lower in HS578T cells than in MCF7 cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>). Taken together, our data suggests that this difference in YY1 occupancy contributes to the difference in HP1&#x003b1; expression between the MCF7 and HS578T cell lines.</p><p>YY1 is a member of the GLI-Kruppel family of zinc-finger transcription factors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>]. YY1 is known to be essential for development because knockout of YY1 in mice results in peri-implantation lethality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>]. YY1 can act as an activator or repressor of transcription depending on its interaction with other factors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>]. Multiple studies have implicated YY1 in the development and progression of cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>]. Some of the most compelling data implicating YY1 in tumorigenesis are regarding its role in apoptosis. YY1 negatively regulates p53 by facilitating its interaction with Mdm2 (and its human orthologue, Hdm2), leading to p53 ubiquitination [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">53</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">54</xref>]. This mechanism is thought to increase the cell's resistance to apoptosis in response to genotoxic stress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">54</xref>]. In addition, depletion of YY1 can sensitize cells to apoptotic stimuli through p53-independent pathways [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>]. The fact that YY1 expression can render a cell resistant to apoptosis may explain why levels of YY1 are increased in certain types of cancer such as osteosarcoma, non-melanoma skin cancer, and acute myeloid leukemia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B55">55</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B57">57</xref>].</p><p>Our data suggest that YY1 acts as a suppressor of migration in breast cancer cells. This is not the first report to implicate YY1 in invasion and metastasis. YY1 has been implicated in the metastatic progression of lung cancer cells due to its regulation of the putative metastasis suppressor HLJ1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B58">58</xref>]. YY1 has also been implicated in the negative regulation of the chemokine receptor CXCR4 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B59">59</xref>], which has been implicated in the ability of breast cancer cells to metastasize to bone [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B60">60</xref>]. In addition, our results indicate that decreased YY1 expression can result in decreased expression of HP1&#x003b1;, which could contribute to the development of an invasive phenotype.</p><p>By definition, metastasis suppressor genes affect the metastatic process without affecting tumorigenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. As mentioned previously, YY1 has been proposed to play a number of roles in the process of tumorigenesis, and can therefore not be regarded as a pure metastasis suppressor. YY1 may play a role at several different points in cancer development and progression. High levels of YY1 may be advantageous to transformed cells during the early stages of cancer development, principally by reducing the tendency toward apoptosis. However, reduced expression of YY1 may be advantageous to metastasizing cells. Interestingly, high levels of YY1 are observed in high-grade prostate cancer, but prostate tumors with areas of low YY1 expression show a high rate of recurrence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B61">61</xref>]. It is possible that decreased expression of YY1 allows sub-populations of cells within these tumors to become more highly invasive. By exploring the role of YY1 in migration and invasion, our study adds another layer to the complex role that YY1 may play in the development of metastatic disease.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>Studies have shown that the level of HP1&#x003b1; is reduced in invasive breast cancer cell lines such as MDA-MB-231 and HS578T compared with non-invasive cell lines.
