We and others have shown that oxidized fats are strong activators of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor &#x003b1; (PPAR&#x003b1;) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>], a ligand-activated transcription factor that belongs to the family of nuclear receptors. PPAR&#x003b1; is centrally involved in the regulation of lipid homeostasis in the liver and is essential for normal liver function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. Upon activation of PPAR&#x003b1; by a ligand, which includes the fibrate class of hypolipidemic drugs such as clofibrate or fenofibrate, fatty acids, and eicosanoids, the transcription of genes containing a PPAR response element (PPRE) in its promoter region is induced. Typical PPAR&#x003b1;-responsive genes in the liver, which are also up-regulated by oxidized fats and its components such as oxidized fatty acids (e.g. hydroperoxy-fatty acids, cyclic fatty acids) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>], include a wide array of genes that are involved in peroxisomal and mitochondrial fatty acid &#x003b2;-oxidation such as L-type carnitin-palmitoyl transferase I (L-CPT I), acyl-CoA oxidase (ACO), cytochrome P<sub>450 </sub>4A1 (CYP4A1), medium-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (MCAD), and long-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (LCAD) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. PPAR&#x003b1; activation by oxidized fat was also shown to cause liver enlargement due to peroxisome proliferation and reduce triacylglycerol concentrations in liver, plasma, and very low-density lipoproteins in rats [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. In part, the triacylglycerol-lowering effect of oxidized fat in the rat is presumably also due to the observed reduction in mRNA concentrations and activities of lipogenic enzymes such as fatty acid synthase (FAS) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>].</p><p>During pregnancy treatment of rats with the pharmacological PPAR&#x003b1; activator clofibrate has been shown to cause proliferation of peroxisomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>], induction of peroxisomal enzyme activities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>], and induction of CYP4A1 in fetal liver [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>] indicating that clofibrate is capable of activating PPAR&#x003b1; transplacentally. In addition, pathological changes in newborn rats born to mothers treated with clofibrate during pregnancy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>], and an impaired fetal growth of fenofibrate-treated pregnant rats have been reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. Moreover, in rat and mouse liver epithelial cells treatment with the PPAR&#x003b1; agonist WY-14,643 caused up-regulation of proto-oncogenes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>], which has been attributed to the hepatocarcinogenic effect of peroxisome proliferators in rodents [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. However, whether feeding oxidized fat to pregnant rats also results in activation of PPAR&#x003b1; and up-regulation of PPAR&#x003b1; target genes in fetal livers is unknown from the literature. Moreover, it is unknown whether components of oxidized fats such as oxidized fatty acids are able to substantially pass the placenta and enter the fetus, because it has been shown that the transplacental transport of fatty acids from the maternal diet is highly selective for individual fatty acids, e.g. long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids such as docosahexaenoic acid and arachidonic acid are preferentially transported through the placenta at the expense of other less important fatty acids [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>].</p><p>Therefore, the present study aimed to explore whether feeding oxidized fat during pregnancy causes a PPAR&#x003b1; response in fetal liver as estimated by the up-regulation of typical PPAR&#x003b1;-responsive genes such as ACO, L-CPT I, CYP4A1, MCAD, and LCAD and whether the induction of fatty acid catabolism might also affect fetal hepatic triacylglycerol concentrations. We also analyzed the mRNA abundance of the lipogenic transcription factor sterol regulatory-element binding protein (SREBP)-1c and its target gene FAS, because in previous studies administration of oxidized fats has also been demonstrated to reduce mRNA expression of lipogenic enzymes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. To address possible adverse effects of treatment with oxidized fat, we also determined the mRNA abundance of the proto-oncogenes c-myc, c-jun, and c-fos.</p><p>Since the duration of administration of oxidized fat during pregnancy might also influence the effect on lipid metabolism in the fetal liver, we performed two experiments which varied in the duration of administration of the oxidized fat. In the first experiment we investigated the effect of short-term administration (last 5 d of pregnancy) of oxidized fat on the PPAR&#x003b1; response in maternal and fetal liver, whereas in the second experiment the effect of long-term administration (whole pregnancy) was studied.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Fatty acid composition and concentrations of lipid peroxidation products in the experimental fats</title><p>The oxidized fat in the short-term experiment had lower proportions of polyunsaturated fatty acids (C18:2) but higher proportions of saturated (C16:0, C18:0) and monounsaturated (C18:1) fatty acids compared to the control fat due to the heat treatment of sunflower oil during preparation of the oxidized fat (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>). In the long-term experiment the proportions of C18:2 and C18:1 in the oxidized fat were similar to those in the control fat due to adjustment of fatty acid composition of the control fat, whereas the proportions of saturated fatty acids were lower in the oxidized fat compared to the control fat (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref>). In both experiments the oxidized fat had higher concentrations of peroxides, TBARS, and conjugated dienes, and a higher acid value than the fat of the control group. The concentrations of lipid peroxidation products (peroxide value and conjugated dienes) in the control fat were higher in the long-term experiment than in the short-term experiment. This is probably due to the fact that fats in the long-term experiment were included into a semi-synthetic diet which contained pro-oxidant minerals such as iron or copper whereas fats in the short-term experiment were administered the rats directly by gastric tube.</p><table-wrap position="float" id="T1"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Characteristics of the experimental fats of the short-term experiment</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><td align="left">Treatment group</td><td align="center">Control</td><td align="center">Clofibrate</td><td align="center">Oxidized fat<sup>1</sup></td></tr><tr><td align="left">Fat</td><td align="center" colspan="2">SFO<sup>2</sup></td><td align="center">oxidized SFO<sup>2</sup></td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left">Major fatty acids, g/100 g total fatty acids</td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td align="left">&#x02003;C16:0</td><td align="center" colspan="2">6.1</td><td align="center">9.1</td></tr><tr><td align="left">&#x02003;C18:0</td><td align="center" colspan="2">3.4</td><td align="center">5.3</td></tr><tr><td align="left">&#x02003;C18:1 (n-9)</td><td align="center" colspan="2">32.6</td><td align="center">38.3</td></tr><tr><td align="left">&#x02003;C18:2 (n-6)</td><td align="center" colspan="2">56.6</td><td align="center">44.7</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Peroxidation products</td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td align="left">&#x02003;Peroxide value, mEq O<sub>2</sub>/kg</td><td align="center" colspan="2">3.0</td><td align="center">379</td></tr><tr><td align="left">&#x02003;Acid value, g KOH/kg</td><td align="center" colspan="2">0.4</td><td align="center">5.8</td></tr><tr><td align="left">&#x02003;Conjugated dienes, mmol/kg</td><td align="center" colspan="2">&#x0003c; 0.1</td><td align="center">274</td></tr><tr><td align="left">&#x02003;TBARS<sup>2</sup>, mmol/kg</td><td align="center" colspan="2">1.1</td><td align="center">13.1</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><p><sup>1</sup>Prepared by heating at a temperature of 60&#x000b0;C for 25 d.</p><p><sup>2</sup>Abbreviations: SFO, sunflower oil; TBARS, thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances.</p></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap><table-wrap position="float" id="T2"><label>Table 2</label><caption><p>Characteristics of the experimental fats of the long-term experiment</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><td align="left">Treatment group</td><td align="center">Control</td><td align="center">Clofibrate</td><td align="center">Oxidized fat</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Fat</td><td align="center" colspan="2">SFO<sup>2 </sup>: lard (54:46)</td><td align="center">oxidized SFO<sup>2</sup></td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left">Major fatty acids, g/100 g total fatty acids</td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td align="left">&#x02003;C16:0</td><td align="center" colspan="2">14.9</td><td align="center">10.2</td></tr><tr><td align="left">&#x02003;C18:0</td><td align="center" colspan="2">9.5</td><td align="center">6.2</td></tr><tr><td align="left">&#x02003;C18:1 (n-9)</td><td align="center" colspan="2">28.9</td><td align="center">34.4</td></tr><tr><td align="left">&#x02003;C18:2 (n-6)</td><td align="center" colspan="2">42.0</td><td align="center">44.2</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Peroxidation products</td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td align="left">&#x02003;Peroxide value, mEq O<sub>2</sub>/kg</td><td align="center" colspan="2">6.6</td><td align="center">230</td></tr><tr><td align="left">&#x02003;Conjugated dienes, mmol/kg</td><td align="center" colspan="2">12.3</td><td align="center">139</td></tr><tr><td align="left">&#x02003;TBARS<sup>2</sup>, mmol/kg</td><td align="center" colspan="2">1.0</td><td align="center">19</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><p><sup>1</sup>Prepared by heating at a temperature of 60&#x000b0;C for 25 d.</p><p><sup>2</sup>Abbreviations: SFO, sunflower oil; TBARS, thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances.</p></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap></sec><sec><title>Final body weights and relative liver weights of pregnant rats</title><p>Body weight development was not affected by dietary treatment in both experiments due to the controlled feeding regimen applied.

Moreover, the present study shows that feeding oxidized fat during whole pregnancy, but not during late pregnancy, lowers triacylglycerol concentrations in fetal livers. Hydroxy- and hydroperoxy-fatty acids such as hydroxyoctadecadienoic acid (HODE) and hydroperoxyoctadecadienoic acid (HPODE) occurring in oxidized fats are very potent PPAR&#x003b1; agonists [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. These oxidized fatty acids are produced during the early stage of lipid peroxidation, and, due to their low thermodynamic stability, easily decompose at high temperatures. Thus, fats treated at low temperatures have markedly higher concentrations of these primary lipid peroxidation products than fats treated at high temperature [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Therefore, in order to provoke a significant PPAR&#x003b1; activating effect of the oxidized fat, we decided to use a fat treated at a relatively low temperature for a long period. Although we did not determine the concentrations of oxidized fatty acids such as 13-HODE or 13-HPODE in the oxidized fat, the high peroxide value and the high concentration of conjugated dienes indicate that the oxidized fats used in both experiments presumably had high concentrations of hydroxy- and hydroperoxy-fatty acids which may be particularly responsible for the PPAR&#x003b1; activating effect of oxidized fats. Nonetheless, other components of heated fats such as cyclic fatty acid monomers which also show a strong PPAR&#x003b1; response [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>] might be also causative for PPAR&#x003b1; activation.</p><p>The lower concentrations of primary lipid peroxidation products (peroxides, conjugated dienes) in the oxidized fat used in the long-term experiment compared to that used in the short-term experiment are probably explained by the fact that in the long-term experiment the lipid peroxidation products in the oxidized fat were determined after inclusion into the diet. Primary lipid peroxidation products easily decompose and are partially degraded in the presence of other diet components such as metal ions (e.g. iron, copper) acting as catalysts.</p><p>Since unspecific effects might have been caused by a different fatty acid composition of the experimental fats (the heating process caused a loss of polyunsaturated fatty acids), we aimed at equalizing in particular the concentration of the polyunsaturated fatty acid C18:2 (n-6) in the fresh fat and the oxidized fat in the second experiment which lasted during the whole pregnancy. Although the concentrations of the long-chain saturated fatty acids C16:0 and C18:0 were consequently decreased in the oxidized fat compared to the fresh fat, we think that these differences are not responsible for the differences in the PPAR&#x003b1; response observed between the experimental groups, because saturated long chain-fatty acids were shown to bind and activate PPAR&#x003b1; only very weakly compared to polyunsaturated fatty acids such as C18:2 (n-6) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. Therefore, we assume that the PPAR&#x003b1; response to an oxidized fat might depend on the balance between unoxidized fatty acids with low PPAR&#x003b1; transactivation activity and oxidized fatty acids with high PPAR&#x003b1; transactivation activity because both types of fatty acids compete for the PPAR&#x003b1;-ligand binding site.</p><p>A further consequence of the use of lard in the control fat was that the cholesterol content of the control and the clofibrate diet slightly differed from that of the oxidized fat diet. However, based on an average cholesterol concentration of about 80 mg per 100 g lard the control and the clofibrate diet contained less than 0.004% cholesterol. Therefore, we assume that the slight difference in the cholesterol concentration between the experimental diets is negligible, especially since no relation between PPAR&#x003b1; activation and dietary cholesterol is known from the literature.</p><p>The present study clearly shows that feeding oxidized fat during pregnancy, similar to clofibrate, which was used as a positive control, causes not only a PPAR&#x003b1; response in the liver of pregnant animals as shown by liver enlargement and up-regulation of PPAR&#x003b1;-responsive genes but also in the liver of the fetuses. Although the induction of the PPAR&#x003b1; response by oxidized fat in the fetal liver was not as pronounced as observed with clofibrate, the oxidized fat also caused a strong up-regulation of PPAR&#x003b1;-target genes of up to 9-fold in the livers of fetuses which was even more pronounced than the effect of oxidized fat in the livers of pregnant rats. Therefore, these findings suggest that not only pharmacological PPAR&#x003b1; activators but also components of oxidized fat are able to sufficiently pass the placenta and activate PPAR&#x003b1; in the fetal liver. This finding is novel since the placental transfer of these components of oxidized fat with PPAR&#x003b1; activating potential from the maternal diet to the fetus is unknown. Indeed, the transplacental transport of fatty acids is highly selective for individual fatty acids [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>], but no data are available from the literature with respect to the placental passage of oxidized fatty acids which are presumably decisive for the PPAR&#x003b1; activating effect of oxidized fat. Thus, the present results indicate that these critical components of oxidized fats are also sufficiently transported across the placenta. Moreover, the observation from the short-term experiment that up-regulation of mRNA expression of ACO, CYP4A1 and L-CPT I by oxidized fat in the fetal liver was even more pronounced than in the liver of pregnant rats indicates that components of oxidized fat responsible for PPAR&#x003b1; activation are presumably transported through the placenta with high preference.</p><p>Since activation of hepatic PPAR&#x003b1; by clofibrate or oxidized fat has been demonstrated to enhance the fatty acid oxidation capacity in the liver and to lower hepatic triacylglycerol concentrations in non-pregnant rats [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>], we also studied the effect of oxidized fat on the concentrations of triacylglycerols in the fetal liver. Indeed, we could demonstrate that feeding the oxidized fat during pregnancy also reduced the concentrations of triacylglycerols in the fetal liver indicating that the transplacental induction of PPAR&#x003b1; responsive genes enhanced the peroxisomal and mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation capacity of the fetal liver. However, this effect has only been observed when the oxidized fat was fed during the whole pregnancy, but not when the oxidized fat was fed for the last 5 d of pregnancy only, although the PPAR&#x003b1; responsive genes were markedly up-regulated in fetal livers of pregnant rats treated during either whole or late pregnancy. This suggests that short-term administration of oxidized fat to pregnant rats causes significant alterations on the gene expression level, which have no implications on the phenotypic level, e.g. triaclyglycerol concentrations. In contrast, short-term administration of clofibrate during pregnancy even revealed alterations on the phenotypic level as evidenced by reduced triacylglycerol concentrations in fetal livers. The latter might be attributed to the fact that clofibrate caused a more pronounced activation of PPAR&#x003b1; in fetal livers due to a higher affinity for PPAR&#x003b1; compared to oxidized fat leading to a marked induction of fatty acid oxidation and a significant lowering of triacylglycerol concentrations in fetal livers even after short-term exposure to clofibrate.</p><p>Interestingly, no effect of oxidized fat and even clofibrate on hepatic triacylglycerol concentrations following short-term treatment could be observed in pregnant rats, although clofibrate reduced triacylglycerol concentrations in fetal livers following short-term treatment. The failure of clofibrate or oxidized fat to reduce hepatic triacylglycerol concentrations in pregnant rats in the short-term experiment might be attributed to the fact that treatment was only performed during late pregnancy when significant alterations in lipid metabolism [e.g. hypertriacylglycerolemia as a consequence of enhanced adipose tissue lipolytic activity, enhanced liver production of VLDL particles, and decreased extrahepatic lipoprotein lipase activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]] occur in the pregnant animal. The enhanced arrival of free fatty acids, which also serve as ligands for PPAR&#x003b1;, in the liver during late pregnancy could decrease the availability for the stronger PPAR&#x003b1; activators clofibrate or components of oxidized fat with PPAR&#x003b1; activating potential to their PPAR&#x003b1;-ligand binding site. This in turn could reduce the capability of fibrates or oxidized fat to activate PPAR&#x003b1; and consequently, its metabolic effects. This might be important since a substantial body of evidence suggests that not all alterations in gene transcription induced by pharmacological PPAR&#x003b1; activators are also induced by fatty acids [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>], e.g. some genes that contain a PPRE do not respond to fatty acids but to high-affinity PPAR&#x003b1; activators [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. Thus, administration of oxidized fat or clofibrate during late pregnancy might provoke differential effects on lipid metabolism than in virgin or early pregnant rats. The observation that treatment of rats with the triacylglycerol-lowering PPAR&#x003b1; agonist fenofibrate during late pregnancy even increased triacylglycerol concentrations in plasma, whereas in virgin rats treatment with fenofibrate caused a reduction in plasma triacylglycerol concentrations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>], is probably supportive of this assumption.</p><p>Whether the effect observed with oxidized fat or clofibrate might have been also influenced by the metabolic state, e.g. fasting vs. non-fasting, cannot be answered with certainty. In the present study we decided to perform gene expression analysis of PPAR&#x003b1;-responsive genes in the liver in the non-fasting state, because lipolysis of stored triacylglycerols in adipose tissue is strongly activated during fasting, resulting in a marked increase in plasma free fatty acid levels. These free fatty acids act as endogenous PPAR&#x003b1; ligands and might have competed with the exogenous ligands (e.g. clofibrate, oxidized fatty acids or cyclic fatty acid monomers) for the PPAR&#x003b1;-ligand binding site. Therefore, an altered ratio between endogenous free fatty acids and exogenous oxidized fatty acids as a consequence of the fasting state might have provoked a different PPAR&#x003b1; response in the liver of pregnant rats and fetuses than observed in the non-fasting state. However, further studies are required to definitely resolve this question.</p><p>Only slight effects have been observed in the present study with respect to the lipogenic transcription factor SREBP-1c and its target gene FAS. Namely, oxidized fat caused a slight reduction in the mRNA abundance of FAS in the liver of pregnant rats, which is consistent with recent findings in non-pregnant rats [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. However, no effect of oxidized fat has been observed on gene expression of lipogenic enzymes in fetal livers indicating that the reduced hepatic triacylglycerol concentrations in fetuses from pregnant rats treated with oxidized fat are probably largely due to an enhanced fatty acid oxidation capacity due to transplacental activation of PPAR&#x003b1;. In part, the failure of oxidized fat on FAS gene expression in fetal livers might be explained by the fact that lipogenesis in fetal livers is generally very low and only increased during late pregnancy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>], and, therefore, probably does not respond to variations in the maternal diet.</p><p>Since pathological changes in newborn rats born to mothers treated with clofibrate during pregnancy have been reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>], treatment with fenofibrate has been shown to impair fetal growth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>], and a link between induced CYP4A1 expression, peroxisome proliferation, and carcinogenesis in rat livers has been described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>], we also addressed possible adverse effects of treatment with oxidized fat on fetal livers. With respect to the hepatocarcinogenic effect of peroxisome proliferators in rodents it has been suggested that enhanced DNA synthesis as a consequence of up-regulation of proto-oncogenes including c-fos, c-jun, and c-myc might be mechanistically involved [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. In the present study an up-regulation of proto-oncogenes in the livers of pregnant rats has been observed in the long-term experiment, but not in the short-term experiment, indicating that short-term administration of oxidized fat has no impact on mRNA expression of proto-oncogenes. However, in fetal livers mRNA expression of proto-oncogenes was not affected by oxidized fat regardless of the duration of oxidized fat administration suggesting that the oxidized fat is uncritical with respect to hepatocarcinogenesis. Unexpectedly, treatment with clofibrate had no effect on proto-oncogene expression in pregnant rats and fetuses either in the short-term and the long-term experiment, although it has been reported that the high-affinity PPAR&#x003b1;-ligand WY-14,643 strongly up-regulated various proto-oncogenes in rat and mouse liver epithelial cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. This differential action of WY-14,643 and clofibrate on proto-oncogene mRNA expression cannot be explained at the moment and, therefore, requires further research activities.</p><p>Although oxidized fat had no effect on proto-oncogene expression in fetal livers in the present study, oxidized fats might be considered critically in view of inducing oxidative stress in different tissues as shown in recent studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]. In addition, specific components of oxidized fats such as cyclic fatty acid monomers, which are formed in substantial amounts during domestic frying of frozen foods in sunflower oil [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>], are probably toxic, e.g. earlier studies reported that mice receiving cyclic fatty acid monomers as well as rat pups from mothers fed cyclic fatty acid monomers had a higher death rate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>In conclusion, the present study demonstrates for the first time that components of oxidized fat with PPAR&#x003b1; activating potential contained in the maternal diet are able to induce a PPAR&#x003b1; response in the liver of fetuses as evidenced by an up-regulation of PPAR&#x003b1; target genes. In addition, the present study shows that feeding oxidized fat during whole pregnancy, but not during late pregnancy, lowers triacylglycerol concentrations in fetal livers, probably as a consequence of an enhanced peroxisomal and mitochondrial &#x003b2;-oxidation capacity. Although administration of oxidized fat during pregnancy had not impact on fetal proto-oncogene mRNA expression either after short-term or long-term administration, the observed pronounced transplacental PPAR&#x003b1; activation by oxidized fat might be considered critically because of other recently reported adverse effects of treatment with PPAR&#x003b1; activators during pregnancy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. Therefore, further research should be encouraged with respect to possible detrimental effects of oxidized fat on fetal development.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Animals</title><p>Two experiments were carried out with female Sprague-Dawley rats obtained from Charles River (Sulzfeld, Germany). At 11 wk of age, the rats were mated by housing one male rat with two female rats. D 1 of pregnancy was assigned upon observation of sperm in the vaginal smears, at which time rats were randomly assigned to the treatment groups. The short-term experiment was performed from d 16 to d 21 of pregnancy and included 27 pregnant rats with an initial body weight (d 16 of pregnancy) of 297 &#x000b1; 26 (Mean &#x000b1; SD) g, which were allotted to three groups of nine rats each. The long-term experiment was performed from d 1 to d 21 of pregnancy and included 36 rats with an initial body weight (d 1 of pregnancy) of 238 &#x000b1; 27 g, which were allotted to three groups of twelve rats each. Pregnant rats were kept individually in Macrolon cages in a room maintained with controlled temperature (23 &#x000b1; 1&#x000b0;C), humidity (50&#x02013;60%), and lighting (0600 to 1800 h).

To standardize food intake, the diets were fed daily in controlled amounts of 16 g per d. The first group (control group) received sunflower oil, the second group (oxidized fat group) oxidized fat (see "preparation of the oxidized fat"), and the third group (clofibrate group) sunflower oil containing 75 mg clofibrate (Fluka, Buchs, Switzerland) equivalent to 250 mg clofibrate per kg body weight. The experimental fats were given for 5 d from d 16 of pregnancy to d 21 of pregnancy. The standard diet was completely consumed by all the rats. Thus, all the rats within this experiment consumed identical amounts of the food.</p></sec><sec><title>Long-term experiment</title><p>In the long-term experiment, semipurified diets, composed according to the recommendations of ASNS for rats during reproduction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>], were used. The diet consisted of (g/kg diet): casein, 200; cornstarch, 390; saccharose, 198; cellulose, 50; fat, 100; mineral mixture, 40; vitamin mixture, 20; DL-methionine, 2. The type of fat was varied according to a one-factorial design. The first group (control group) received a mixture of sunflower oil and lard (54:46, w/w) was used. This ratio was chosen to equalize the fatty acid composition of the fresh fat with that of the oxidized fat, since the heating process caused a loss of polyunsaturated fatty acids, therefore, excluding that the treatment effects were caused by a different fatty acid composition of the experimental fats. The second group (oxidized fat group) received oxidized fat (see "preparation of the oxidized fat"). The third group (clofibrate group) received the same fat as in the control group, and clofibrate was added to the diet at a concentration of 5 g/kg. The vitamin E concentration of the diets was 50 mg &#x003b1;-tocopherol equivalents per kg diet. To adjust the vitamin E concentration of the diets, the native concentrations of tocopherols of the fats were analyzed. Based on the native concentrations of the fats, diets were supplemented individually with all-rac-&#x003b1;-tocopheryl acetate (the biopotency of all-rac-&#x003b1;-tocopheryl acetate is considered to be 67% of that of &#x003b1;-tocopherol). Diets were prepared by mixing the dry components with the fat and water and subsequent freeze drying. The residual water content of the diet was below 5 g/100 g of diet. In preliminary experiments rats fed diets with clofibrate or oxidized fat ad libitum consumed their diets over a longer period than rats fed control diets, which consequently shortened the fasting period and which itself has a pronounced effect on PPAR&#x003b1;-response. Therefore, we decided to administer food daily at 0800 h in controlled amounts to standardize intake and to ensure that rats from all treatment groups had a comparable fasting period. The amount of food administered was 20% less than the amounts of identical diets with fresh fats consumed ad libitum by rats in preliminary studies. The amount of food offered daily was increased continuously during the experiment from 14 g to 17 g. In this feeding system, the food offered was completely consumed by all the rats. Thus, all the rats within this experiment consumed identical amounts of food.

Sunflower oil was filled into a glass beaker and placed into a drying oven set at the intended temperature. Throughout the heating process, air was continuously bubbled through the fat at a flow rate of 650 ml/min. This treatment caused a loss of polyunsaturated fatty acids, and a complete loss of tocopherols and raised the concentrations of lipid peroxidation products in the fats. The extent of lipid peroxidation in the oxidized fat was estimated by assaying the peroxide value (POV) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>], acid value [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>], concentration of thiobarbituric acid substances (TBARS) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>], and concentration of conjugated dienes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>].
