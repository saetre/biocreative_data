Although this sialomucin has been shown to block cell adhesion, the mechanisms involved remain enigmatic.

Moreover, we show that ectopic expression of Podocalyxin in epithelial cells leads to microvillus formation along an expanded apical domain that extends laterally to the junctional complexes. Removal of the C-terminal PDZ-binding domain of Podocalyxin abolishes NHERF-1 recruitment but, surprisingly, has no effect on the formation of microvilli. Instead, we find that the extracellular domain and transmembrane region of Podocalyxin are sufficient to direct recruitment of filamentous actin and ezrin to the plasma membrane and induce microvillus formation.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions/Significance</title><p>Our data suggest that this single molecule can modulate NHERF localization and, independently, act as a key orchestrator of apical cell morphology, thereby lending mechanistic insights into its multiple roles as a polarity regulator, tumor progression marker, and anti-adhesin.</p></sec></abstract><counts><page-count count="12"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>The apical surface of adherent cells is a highly specialized domain that, in differentiated epithelia, is characterized by microvilli. These structures act as high surface area transport sites, and their formation coincides with the polymerization of f-actin at the core of the microvilli and recruitment of the ezrin/radixin/moesin (ERM) family of proteins to the apical domain, presumably to act as linkers between the cytoskeleton and transmembrane proteins (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000237-LouvetVallee1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>).

Specifically, Podocalyxin knockout mice generate normal numbers of podocyte precursors, but they fail to generate the extensive, highly-interdigitated foot processes typical of differentiated podocytes and instead retain cell junctions between immature podocytes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000237-Doyonnas1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>. Thus, loss-of-function studies implicate Podocalyxin in specialized epithelial cell morphogenesis.</p><p>It has been hypothesized that the normal function of Podocalyxin is to act as an &#x0201c;apicalizing&#x0201d; factor and an anti-adhesin that can disrupt cell-cell contacts between epithelial cells, and that overexpression can lead to altered morphologies associated with cancer progression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000237-Somasiri1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000237-Takeda1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000237-Meder1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>. How these processes are regulated at the ultrastructural level, however, has not been elucidated. To define the cytosolic components that link Podocalyxin to the cytoskeleton and regulate its activity as a blocker of adhesion, a number of groups have screened for intracellular Podocalyxin-binding proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000237-Tan1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000237-Li1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000237-Takeda2">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>. This led to the identification of the extremely versatile NHERF (Na&#x0002b;/H&#x0002b; exchanger regulatory factor) family of adaptor proteins (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000237-Weinman1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000237-Shenolikar1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>) as Podocalyxin binding partners. NHERF-1/EBP-50 and NHERF-2/E3KARP/TKA-1 are closely related adapter proteins bearing two N-terminal PDZ domains and a C-terminal ERM domain. These proteins bind the C-terminus of a variety of membrane receptors via their PDZ domains and link them to cytoskeletal components through their conserved ERM domain. They have been implicated in regulating a wide variety of biological processes including ion transport, signal transduction, and growth control; known ligands for NHERF PDZ domains include G protein coupled receptors, receptor tyrosine kinases, and transcription factors (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000237-Weinman2">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>).</p><p>The discovery that NHERF-1 and 2 bind the C-terminal DTHL motif of Podocalyxin's cytosolic tail has led to speculation that formation of NHERF/Podocalyxin complexes may be the key mechanistic step in 1) formation of apical domains in epithelial cells, 2) dissolution of cell-cell junctions between normal epithelial cells or during tumor progression, 3) generation of highly-interdigitated foot processes for normal podocyte function, and 4) blocking hematopoietic cell adhesion <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000237-Doyonnas1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000237-Somasiri1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000237-Takeda1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000237-Meder1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000237-Tan1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000237-Takeda2">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000237-Weinman1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>.

Strikingly, we find that Podocalyxin is a robust inducer of apical microvillus formation and that these structures recruit f-actin in a manner characteristic of normal microvilli <italic>in vivo</italic>. Surprisingly, however, this process required only the extracellular domain and transmembrane region of Podocalyxin; the bulk of the cytoplasmic domain including all phosphorylation sites and the highly conserved NHERF binding domain were completely dispensable for this function. When present, however, Podocalyxin's cytoplasmic tail potently recruited NHERF-1 to the apical plasma membrane; in its absence NHERF-1 was dispersed throughout the cell, suggesting that Podocalyxin may modulate NHERF function by regulating its apical membrane localization. Our results suggest that Podocalyxin is a potent regulator of epithelial cell morphogenesis, which may provide mechanistic clues to its previously described role in blocking cell adhesion and as a marker of aggressive cancers when overexpressed.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Podocalyxin is a potent inducer of microvillus formation</title><p>Since Podocalyxin is normally found in polarized cells with highly distinctive cell surface extensions, we investigated the possibility that this molecule may be directly involved in generation of such structures. MDCK kidney epithelial and MCF-7 breast carcinoma cell lines were stably transfected with constructs encoding full-length murine Podocalyxin and the morphologies of resulting bulk populations were examined by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). In Podocalyxin-transfected cells, but not cells transfected with empty vector, we observed a striking increase in microvillus formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000237-g001">figure 1A&#x02013;D</xref>). This phenomenon was even more apparent upon scanning electron microscopy (SEM) analysis of clonally isolated populations of transfected cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000237-g001">figure 1E&#x02013;H</xref>). Quantification revealed a 2-3-fold increase in microvillus numbers in Podocalyxin-transfected cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000237-g001">figure 1I</xref>). We therefore conclude that ectopic expression of Podocalyxin is sufficient to induce the formation of microvilli.</p><p>Intact actin filaments are an essential component of normal microvilli. MCF-7 and MDCK cells were therefore treated with latrunculin A, an inhibitor of actin polymerization, to determine if the Podocalyxin-induced cell surface projections were structurally dependent on f-actin. Confocal microscopic analysis revealed colocalization of f-actin and Podocalyxin in a punctate pattern at the apical cell surface where microvilli form in untreated Podocalyxin-transfected cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000237-g002">figure 2</xref>). In vector-transfected cells, apical actin was more diffuse and less abundant, demonstrating that Podocalyxin is capable of apical actin recruitment, as shown previously <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000237-Schmieder1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>. Strikingly, latrunculin A treatment of Podocalyxin-transfected cells led to loss of actin filaments, including apically localized f-actin, and redistribution of Podocalyxin into a diffuse pattern at the cell surface. Together, these data demonstrated that Podocalyxin induces formation of typical actin-dependent microvillar structures.</p><p>Previously we found that Podocalyxin expression is an independent indicator of invasive breast cancer with very poor prognosis and that ectopic expression in breast carcinoma cell lines leads to subtle alterations of cell junctions and shedding of cells from confluent, high density monolayers <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000237-Somasiri1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>. In an effort to correlate these observations with microvillus formation, we used confocal imaging to determine the morphology and microvillus status of cells expressing Podocalyxin in monolayers. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000237-g003">figure 3</xref> and, more strikingly, in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0000237.s001">supplemental figure S1</xref><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0000237.s002"/>, MCF-7 cells expressing high levels of Podocalyxin exhibited a distinctive apical expansion above surrounding cells in these monolayers. This correlated closely with the appearance of a &#x0201c;shag-rug&#x0201d; morphology on the apical face of these cells as detected by Podocalyxin staining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000237-g003">figure 3A</xref>, inset). The same phenotype was observed in human ovarian carcinoma and normal murine mammary epithelial cell lines overexpressing Podocalyxin (data not shown). We conclude that monolayer disruption, progressive loss of cell contacts, and decreased integrity of cell junctions induced by Podocalyxin is likely linked to its ability to induce the apical domain expansion that is associated with microvillus formation.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Podocalyxin recruits NHERF-1, f-actin, and ezrin to the apical membrane</title><p>We, and others, have shown previously that Podocalyxin can interact with NHERF-1 and NHERF-2 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000237-Meder1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000237-Tan1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000237-Li1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000237-Takeda2">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000237-Schmieder1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>. Since NHERF molecules act as scaffolding proteins and associate with actin through ezrin, it was assumed that NHERF proteins were responsible for apical localization of Podocalyxin. Surprisingly, here we observed the opposite. In control MCF-7 cells endogenous NHERF-1 was diffusely localized throughout the cytoplasm, whereas in Podocalyxin-transfected cells there was a dramatic increase in apically localized NHERF-1 and a concomitant decrease in cytoplasmic staining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000237-g003">figure 3B, C</xref>). Thus, Podocalyxin is capable of recruiting NHERF-1 to apical domains.</p><p>Podocalyxin and NHERF-1 both interact with the actin-binding protein ezrin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000237-Yun1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000237-Orlando1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>. Since ezrin is an important component of microvilli, we sought to determine the localization of endogenous ezrin and f-actin at the apical plasma membrane in cells expressing Podocalyxin. High resolution confocal analysis revealed that in cells lacking ectopic Podocalyxin expression, ezrin localized to small discrete puncta and did not colocalize with f-actin. In contrast, in cells ectopically expressing Podocalyxin, both ezrin and f-actin were enriched at the apical membrane and dramatically colocalized with Podocalyxin in microvillar structures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000237-g004">figure 4</xref>). Taken together, overexpression of Podocalyxin induced the formation of apical actin-dependent microvilli, enriched with NHERF-1 and ezrin.</p><p>Since ezrin is known to link transmembrane proteins to the actin cytoskeleton, we assessed the role of ezrin in the recruitment of Podocalyxin to the apical membrane by transiently expressing a dominant-negative mutant of the molecule (N'ezrin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000237-Crepaldi1">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref>) in MCF-7 cells already stably expressing Podocalyxin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000237-g005">figure 5</xref>). When N'ezrin was expressed in pre-formed, fully polarized monolayers, Podocalyxin and NHERF-1 both remained localized at the apical membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000237-g005">figure 5A, B</xref>). A considerable amount of the N'ezrin itself was also targeted to the apical domain in these cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000237-g005">figure 5A</xref>) although, as expected <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000237-Crepaldi1">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref>, the mutant protein was also targeted to basal and basolateral domains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000237-g005">figure 5B</xref>). We also expressed N'ezrin in cells prior to monolayer formation, which allowed us to examine protein localization as polarity was being established (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000237-g005">figure 5C, D</xref>). In this case N'ezrin was clearly present at apical, lateral, and basal surfaces (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000237-g005">figure 5D</xref>). The same was not true of Podocalyxin and NHERF-1, which were found mainly apically and laterally as polarity was being established. Importantly, there was no difference in Podocalyxin and NHERF-1 localization in neighboring cells that did not express mutant N'ezrin. Thus, while we cannot rule out subtle differences in localization, it appears that ezrin is not likely required for Podocalyxin's apical targeting or its ability to recruit NHERF-1 to the apical domain and retain it there. This does preclude the possibility, however, that Podocalyxin may be capable of regulating the localization of endogenous, wild type ezrin (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000237-g004">figures 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000237-g009">9</xref>).</p><p>In order to gain further insights into the mechanisms involved in Podocalyxin-induced NHERF-recruitment and microvillus formation, we generated a series of MCF-7 clones expressing wild-type avian Podocalyxin or the following three deletion mutants: 1) &#x0201c;&#x00394;DTHL,&#x0201d; lacking the C-terminal DTHL motif essential for interaction with NHERF proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000237-Li1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000237-Takeda2">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>; 2) &#x0201c;&#x00394;tail,&#x0201d; lacking the entire cytoplasmic tail with the exception of the juxtamembrane sequence HQRF, which was retained as a membrane anchor (this mutant <underline>lacks</underline> all potential phosphorylation sites, the C-terminal NHERF-binding site, and a recently described ezrin-binding site) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000237-McNagny1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000237-Sassetti1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000237-Schmieder1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000237-Kershaw1">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref>; and, finally, 3) &#x0201c;&#x00394;EC,&#x0201d; lacking the majority of the extracellular domain (including the mucin domain and the cysteine-bonded globular domain) and instead encoding an extracellular &#x0201c;flag-tag,&#x0201d; Podocalyxin's transmembrane region, and its full-length cytoplasmic tail (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000237-g006">figure 6A</xref>). Avian Podocalyxin was chosen as the basis for these experiments for three reasons: 1) it is 85&#x00025; identical to mammalian Podocalyxin in its intracellular domain, 2) as with the murine protein used in the above experiments, wildtype avian Podocalyxin also induced microvillus formation in MCF-7 cells, and 3) ectopic expression could be selectively detected using a species-specific monoclonal antibody that reacts with native, fixed, and denatured forms of the molecule <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000237-McNagny1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>. MCF-7 cells were transfected with these constructs, and clones were isolated based on similar levels of ectopic Podocalyxin expression as determined by FACS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000237-g006">figure 6B</xref>).</p><p>As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000237-g007">figure 7</xref>, full-length Podocalyxin showed strong colocalization with endogenous NHERF-1 at the apical membrane, while &#x00394;DTHL and &#x00394;tail mutants, both of which lack the C-terminal NHERF binding motif, did not. In contrast, the &#x00394;EC mutant lacking the extracellular domain but retaining the entire cytoplasmic tail of Podocalyxin was apically targeted and colocalized with NHERF-1. This further demonstrates that Podocalyxin recruits NHERF-1 to the apical domain through its C-terminal DTHL motif.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Although the cytoplasmic domain is dispensable, the extracellular domain of Podocalyxin is required for microvillus formation</title><p>We then assessed how loss of the Podocalyxin/NHERF-1 interaction affected microvillus formation. MCF-7 cells transfected with the Podocalyxin mutants described above were used for analysis of microvillus formation by TEM and SEM. TEM demonstrated that, as expected, control cells had few microvilli while cells transfected with full-length Podocalyxin displayed a dramatic increase in microvillus number (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000237-g008">figure 8A</xref>). Strikingly, cells expressing &#x00394;DTHL or &#x00394;tail mutants generated microvilli in similar numbers to full-length Podocalyxin transfectants. Conversely, the extracellular domain of Podocalyxin was found to be essential for this phenotype since there was no increase in microvilli in cells expressing the &#x00394;EC mutant bearing only the flag-tagged transmembrane region and the entire cytoplasmic domain of Podocalyxin, even though this mutant was able to apically recruit NHERF-1 (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000237-g007">figure 7</xref>, above).

A caveat with this model, however, is our inability to detect a loss of microvilli in neuraminidase-treated cells suggesting that, at least for microvillus formation, the terminal sialic acid residues are dispensable.

In this model, an increasing amount of cell surface Podocalyxin would lead to an increasing expansion of the apical domain of these cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000237-g011">figure 11A</xref>). Continued expression would lead to marginalization of cell-cell junctions and, eventually, a decrease in cell-cell contact and adhesion.

As stated above, Podocalyxin could have a passive or biophysical role involving apical membrane expansion. In this scenario epithelial cells would cope with this Podocalyxin-dependent apical domain expansion (possibly as a consequence of a unique property of its extensive glycosylation) by passively creating membrane projections that are subsequently locked into place by the linkage of other apically targeted proteins to the actin cytoskeleton. Alternatively, we favor a model in which Podocalyxin could play a more active role in microvillus production. Podocalyxin's extracellular domain could directly bind another interacting transmembrane molecule that is able to recruit ezrin and f-actin and induce direct production of microvilli rather than passive apical domain expansion. This interaction may therefore transduce the signal to initiate microvillus formation. Regardless of the model, the retention of the microvillus formation phenotype in the presence of neuraminidase suggests that this specific glycosylation is not a prerequisite for this phenotype. Instead Podocalyxin's stalk or globular domain, or perhaps the remainder of its bulky mucin-like domain, may be particularly important in this interaction (under investigation).</p></sec><sec id="s3c"><title>What is the significance of NHERF recruitment to apical domains by Podocalyxin?</title><p>Several groups have suggested that NHERF proteins are responsible for strict apical localization and membrane retention of Podocalyxin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000237-Meder1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000237-Li1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000237-Schmieder1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>. In these studies, deletion of Podocalyxin's NHERF docking site led to a modest reduction in apical Podocalyxin. Although we agree that loss of the NHERF binding site may lead to a subtle relocalization of a small portion of Podocalyxin, our studies demonstrating <underline>complete</underline> relocalization of NHERF-1 from the cytoplasm to the apical membrane when full length Podocalyxin is ectopically expressed argue that it is primarily Podocalyxin that regulates the distribution of NHERF-1 (and presumably other NHERF-bound signaling molecules) rather than NHERF-1 regulating the distribution of Podocalyxin. Although our results preclude a direct functional role for NHERF/Podocalyxin interactions in formation of microvilli and apical cell domains, apical recruitment of NHERF-1 by Podocalyxin is likely to be very important for other aspects of NHERF function, which include ion transport, signal transduction, growth control, receptor signaling, and receptor internalization. Regarding the latter, NHERF can bind a wide variety of signaling ligands (ie. EGFR, PDGFR, &#x003b2;-catenin, PTEN, and adrenergic and purinergic receptors, to name but a few) with functional consequences <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000237-Weinman2">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000237-Sneddon1">&#x0005b;41&#x0005d;</xref>.

Microvilli were enumerated in six random 15 000&#x000d7;(50 &#x000b5;m<sup>2</sup>) fields for each sample. Statistical significance was demonstrated using T-tests to compare vector versus Podocalyxin-transfected cells (or wildtype Podocalyxin versus &#x00394;EC-transfected cells in the case of the &#x00394;EC mutant).</p></sec><sec id="s4e"><title>Immunofluorescence microscopy</title><p>Cells were grown on glass coverslips, fixed with 4&#x00025; paraformaldehyde, permeabilized with 0.1&#x00025; Triton X-100, labeled with primary and secondary antibodies (described above), and examined using an Olympus Fluoview FV1000 confocal microscope. Triple-labeled images were collected sequentially. Micrographs were generated with several merged confocal planes or vertical sections of confocal stacks using Olympus Fluoview FV1000 software (version1.3b). Pearson's coefficient was used to quantitate colocalization on individual slices using ImagePro 3DS 6.0 software. Photos were arranged with Adobe Photoshop and Adobe Illustrator software.</p></sec><sec id="s4f"><title><italic>In vitro</italic> binding assay using purified recombinant proteins</title><p>Biotinylated Podocalyxin tail peptides were produced with a spacer and the following sequences: HQRF (the cytoplasmic tail of the &#x00394;tail mutant), HQRFSQKKSQQRLTEELQ (partial tail of Podocalyxin including the ezrin binding site), and the full-length Podocalyxin cytoplasmic tail. A pGEX construct encoding the N-terminal domain of ezrin fused with GST was a generous gift from Dr. Monique Arpin. GST and GST-N'ezrin were produced according to manufacturer's instructions (Amersham Biosciences, Piscataway, NJ). Biotinylated Podocalyxin peptides (4.3 nmol) were bound to streptavidin-sepharose (Amersham Biosciences), and then incubated for 2 hours at 4&#x000b0;C with 20 &#x000b5;g GST or an equimolar amount of GST-N'ezrin in 150 mM NaCl, 20 mM Tris (pH7), and 0.2&#x00025; Triton X-100 containing 1 mM PMSF and a protease inhibitor cocktail (Sigma-Aldrich). Bound proteins were detected by immmunoblotting using an anti-GST antibody.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0000237.s001"><label>Video S1A</label><caption><p>Podocalyxin induces apical domain expansion and NHERF-1 recruitment. 3D rotated reconstructions of MCF-7 cells transfected with (A) empty vector or (B) murine Podocalyxin showing Podocalyxin (red), NHERF-1 (green), and DAPI (blue) labeling.

Overexpression of Podocalyxin leads to recruitment of f-actin to the apical membrane for formation of microvilli along with apical domain expansion and weakening of cell-cell junctions. Higher expression induces further recruitment of f-actin to the apical surface, which may lead to a decrease in basolateral actin and disruption of integrin-mediated cell-substratum adhesion. Two models are proposed to explain Podocalyxin's mechanism of action. (B) In the absence of Podocalyxin expression NHERF-1 is localized throughout the cytoplasm, whereas in cells expressing high levels of Podocalyxin NHERF-1 is recruited to the apical membrane. Thus, Podocalyxin may regulate NHERF's role in many biological processes.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="pone.0000237.g011"/></fig></sec><fn-group><fn fn-type="conflict"><p><bold>Competing Interests: </bold>The authors have declared that no competing interests exist.</p></fn><fn fn-type="financial-disclosure"><p><bold>Funding: </bold>JSN is a recipient of an NSERC Canada Graduate Scholarship; MLG is a recipient of a UBC Graduate Fellowship; KMM is an MSFHR scholar.
