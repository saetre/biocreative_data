In the hemichordate embryo, genes encoding bone morphogenetic proteins (Bmp) 2/4 and 5/8, as well as several genes for modulators of Bmp activity, are expressed in a thin stripe of ectoderm on one midline, historically called &#x0201c;dorsal.&#x0201d; On the opposite midline, the genes encoding Chordin and Anti-dorsalizing morphogenetic protein (Admp) are expressed. Thus, we find a Bmp-Chordin developmental axis preceding and underlying the anatomical dorsoventral axis of hemichordates, adding to the evidence from <italic>Drosophila</italic> and chordates that this axis may be at least as ancient as the first bilateral animals. Numerous genes encoding transcription factors and signaling ligands are expressed in the three germ layers of hemichordate embryos in distinct dorsoventral domains, such as <italic>pox neuro, pituitary homeobox, distalless,</italic> and <italic>tbx2/3</italic> on the Bmp side and <italic>netrin, mnx, mox,</italic> and <italic>single-minded</italic> on the Chordin-Admp side. When we expose the embryo to excess Bmp protein, or when we deplete endogenous Bmp by small interfering RNA injections, these expression domains expand or contract, reflecting their activation or repression by Bmp, and the embryos develop as dorsalized or ventralized limit forms. Dorsoventral patterning is independent of anterior/posterior patterning, as in <italic>Drosophila</italic> but not chordates. Unlike both chordates and <italic>Drosophila,</italic> neural gene expression in hemichordates is not repressed by high Bmp levels, consistent with their development of a diffuse rather than centralized nervous system. We suggest that the common ancestor of hemichordates and chordates did not use its Bmp-Chordin axis to segregate epidermal and neural ectoderm but to pattern many other dorsoventral aspects of the germ layers, including neural cell fates within a diffuse nervous system. Accordingly, centralization was added in the chordate line by neural-epidermal segregation, mediated by the pre-existing Bmp-Chordin axis. Finally, since hemichordates develop the mouth on the non-Bmp side, like arthropods but opposite to chordates, the mouth and Bmp-Chordin axis may have rearranged in the chordate line, one relative to the other.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="toc"><p>Experimental and anatomical evidence for the role of Bmp and Chordin in the development of the dorsal-ventral axis of hemichordates provides insights into the evolution of the chordate lineage.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="17"/></counts><custom-meta-wrap><custom-meta><meta-name>citation</meta-name><meta-value>Lowe CJ, Terasaki M, Wu M, Freeman RM Jr., Runft L, et al.

Suites of genes are arranged in conserved domain maps in both the anteroposterior and dorsoventral dimensions of developing embryos. Paradoxically, this conservation of axial patterning provides the developmental platform for astonishing anatomical and physiological diversification both within and between phyla. Clearly a major step in the evolution of bilateral animals was the origination of these domain maps and the usage of transcription factors and signaling proteins by which diverse target genes could be expressed at specific times and places in development at subsequent stages.</p><p>The evolution of the dorsoventral axis (transverse to the anteroposterior axis) is not well understood. It may have originated during the transition from radial to bilateral animals &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040291-b003">3</xref>&#x0005d;, although recent evidence raises the possibility it was already cryptically present in radial animals &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040291-b004">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040291-b005">5</xref>&#x0005d;. Bilateral animals, at least back to the Cambrian, have numerous anatomical and physiological specializations located along this axis, in all three germ layers. The mesodermal tissues such as the heart, blood forming elements (and the direction of blood flow), gonads, visceral muscle, and striated muscle are arranged in dorsoventral patterns. The gill slits (in chordates and hemichordates) and other endodermal organs have similarly conserved patterns in the dorsoventral domain. Ectodermal examples include the central nervous system and epidermal territory. The dorsal and ventral poles of the axis are usually assigned based on the orientation of the animal related to gravity (dorsal up; ventral down) or on the location of the mouth (defining the ventral side). Some of these specializations were presumably added before others in the evolution of bilateral animals. The more widespread the specialization among bilateral animals, the older it is assumed to be. For example, since arthropods and chordates have central nervous systems, and since new molecular data reveal commonalities of their development and organization, the central nervous system has been considered a dorsoventral differentiation already present in the bilateral ancestor &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040291-b001">1</xref>&#x0005d;. We will address this point in our study of hemichordates.</p><p>Preceding the dorsoventral axis of anatomical and physiological specializations in the course of development is a molecular axis. In arthropods and chordates genes for bone morphogenetic protein (Bmp 2,4,7, or Dpp) are expressed in the embryo at one pole and the genes for Bmp antagonists, such as Chordin and Noggin, at the other. All subsequent tissues, organs, and cell types develop in accordance with this Bmp-Chordin axis &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040291-b001">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040291-b006">6</xref>&#x0005d;. It may be part of the fundamental body plan of all bilateral animals and may be a key innovation of the bilaterian ancestor (urbilaterian), to which all later dorsoventral differences of anatomy and physiology were attached &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040291-b001">1</xref>&#x0005d;.</p><p>Once established in the embryo, two phases of dorsoventral patterning can be distinguished in chordates and <italic>Drosophila</italic> &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040291-b007">7</xref>&#x0005d;. During the first stage, at pre-gastrula and gastrula stages, ectoderm segregates into two distinct domains, neural and non-neural (i.e., epidermis). Embryonic ectodermal cells that are exposed to high Bmp levels develop as epidermis, whereas cells exposed to low Bmp levels, due to the action of antagonists, develop as neural ectoderm. In both cases, the nervous system develops on the Chordin (low-Bmp) side (called dorsal in the former and ventral in the latter). In vertebrates, a neural default circuitry underlies the decisions, in which Bmp signals repress neural development and promote epidermal development of the ectoderm, whereas elimination of Bmp by antagonists de-represses neural development and represses epidermal &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040291-b008">8</xref>&#x0005d;. Bmp absence, though necessary, may not suffice for neural development in chordates; fibroblast growth factor may have a licensing role &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040291-b009">9</xref>&#x0005d;. Likewise, different antagonists of Bmp may operate in different organisms, such as noggin and follistatin in addition to Chordin; the extracellular modulators of Bmp distribution may also vary. This segregation of ectodermal territories along the Bmp-Chordin axis in the first phase accomplishes the centralization of the nervous system in chordates and <italic>Drosophila.</italic></p><p>In the second phase, at post-gastrula stages, Bmp serves to pattern the germ layers in <italic>Drosophila</italic> and chordates &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040291-b010">10</xref>&#x0005d;. In the vertebrate neural tube there is a new round of <italic>bmp</italic> expression in the roof plate. Hedgehog (Hh) protein and Bmp antagonists emanate from the floorplate and notochord. More than 20 gene expression domains distribute along the dorsoventral axis of the tube in relation to these signals and specify neural cell types &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040291-b011">11</xref>&#x0005d;. Sensory cells and sensory interneurons (in the dorsal part of the neural tube) arise where there is high Bmp, whereas motor neurons arise in regions of low Bmp and high Hh protein &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040291-b012">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040291-b013">13</xref>&#x0005d;. Similar patterning occurs in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> neurogenic ectoderm, where Bmp is opposed by antagonists and by epidermal growth factor &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040291-b014">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040291-b015">15</xref>&#x0005d;. In the mesoderm of chordates and <italic>Drosophila,</italic> high Bmp specifies the heart, and visceral muscle, whereas low Bmp (high antagonists) specifies striated body wall muscle &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040291-b016">16</xref>&#x0005d;. In vertebrates, Bmp levels also specify gut regions and organs of the endoderm &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040291-b017">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040291-b018">18</xref>&#x0005d;. The similar anatomical and physiological specializations along the Bmp-Chordin axis in both <italic>Drosophila</italic> and chordates may imply that some of them date back to the bilateral ancestor and were conserved in later divergent lineages of bilaterians. However, it is also possible that some of them evolved independently in different bilaterian lineages within the context of the pre-existing Bmp-Chordin axis. A central question would be whether the segregation of epidermis and neurogenic ectoderm, as a means of centralizing the nervous system, dates back to the bilaterian ancestor or arose independently in several lines of descendents including chordates and arthropods &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040291-b019">19</xref>&#x0005d;.</p><p>We report here the study of the origins of the dorsoventral developmental axis in <italic>Saccoglossus kowalevskii,</italic> a member of the hemichordata, a phylum of bilateral adult animals, the sister taxon to echinoderms, and closely related to chordates. These three phyla along with the recently reclassified <italic>Xenoturbella</italic> constitute the deuterostome supertaxon &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040291-b020">20</xref>&#x0005d;. We expected hemichordate embryos to utilize a Bmp-Chordin axis to pattern their dorsoventral anatomical axis, in light of the conserved use of Bmp-Chordin in dorsoventral patterning of arthropods and chordates. However, hemichordates differ from those phyla in lacking a central nervous system: theirs is diffuse throughout the ectoderm. Nerve cells and epidermal cells are finely intermixed &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040291-b021">21</xref>&#x0005d;. The epidermis is not broadly segregated from neural ectoderm, and thus seems to lack phase 1 of neural development that is characteristic of arthropods and chordates.</p><p>Yet, despite its diffuse nervous system, hemichordates have a well-developed dorsoventral polarity in all three germ layers, as if phase 2 patterning occurs. On one side (sometimes called dorsal) are localized the gill slits, stomochord, heart/kidney complex, and gonads, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040291-g001">Figure 1</xref>. On the other (called ventral) are localized the mouth and post-anal tail &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040291-b022">22</xref>&#x0005d;. Even for the diffuse nervous system, there are dorsoventral differences in neuronal cell types. The two axon tracts on the opposite midlines differ functionally (the ventral one more associated with motor function). The dorsal tract is internalized in the collar region by a neurulation-like developmental process &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040291-b023">23</xref>&#x0005d;. Giant neurons develop near the dorsal midline, and a specialized patch of sensory neurons develops near the mouth on the ventral side at the base of the proboscis &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040291-b021">21</xref>&#x0005d;. Despite these differences, the categorical assignment of dorsal and ventral poles to the hemichordate axis is ambiguous, because the animal lives mostly in a vertical orientation and its mouth is very wide &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040291-b024">24</xref>&#x0005d;. The mouth side is nonetheless often called ventral, by convention.</p><p>Overall, this organization led N&#x000fc;bler-Jung and Arendt &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040291-b025">25</xref>&#x0005d; to propose that hemichordates have a dorsoventral anatomical axis the inverse of chordates and the same as protostomes such as <italic>Drosophila.</italic> Said in other words, they predicted that the hemichordate mouth falls on the Chordin side of the animal, whereas in chordates it is on the Bmp side. If true, chordates would be unique among bilateral animals in having moved the mouth to the opposite side of the body. A venerable explanation for the chordate anomaly is the inversion hypothesis: an ancestor of the chordate lineage inverted the body dorsoventrally and then moved the mouth to the other side &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040291-b026">26</xref>&#x0005d;. Although the hypothesis, as usually presented, holds that the ancestor already had a centralized nervous system on one side (ventral in the ancestor, dorsal in chordates after inversion), this is not a necessary provision of the hypothesis. Other germ layers and organs might have had dorsoventral organization at the time of body inversion, and the nervous system might have centralized later.</p><p>We have examined the topology of expression of a range of orthologs of genes in <named-content content-type="genus-species">S. kowalevskii</named-content> embryos that are known in vertebrates to depend on the Bmp-Chordin axis for their domain location and to have roles in dorsoventral development. We also investigated the functional importance of Bmp signaling for dorsoventral patterning by RNA interference (RNAi) knockdown and by treatment with ectopic ligand. The comparison of hemichordates to chordates affords insights about which elements of dorsoventral patterning are likely ancestral to deuterostomes and which are unique to chordates or hemichordates. <named-content content-type="genus-species">S. kowalevskii</named-content> indeed expresses many orthologs in a topology that would support the hypothesis of conserved roles in patterning along a Bmp-Chordin axis. Other orthologs, we find, are expressed differently, most notably those that are targets of Hh signaling in the phase 2 patterning of the chordate nervous system. Our functional studies confirm that the Bmp-Chordin axis underpins the dorsoventral anatomical axis of members of this phylum. However, the segregation of neural and epidermal territories does not seem to be a part of this patterning, and this initial phase is not required for other aspects of dorsoventral patterning. Furthermore, dorsoventral patterning seems independent of anteroposterior patterning in <italic>S. kowalevskii,</italic> an independence well known in <italic>Drosophila</italic> but not found in chordates. We discuss the evolutionary implications of our data for the evolution of bilaterians and suggest that the developmental steps involved in centralization of the nervous system (that is, the epidermal-neural segregation) were added independently in different lineages, but always utilizing an existing Bmp/Chordin axis already involved in dorsoventral patterning in the ectoderm.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><p>Despite the difficulties of assigning definitive dorsal and ventral poles in hemichordates, we will, for descriptive purposes in this section, use the classical definition with ventral represented by the position of the mouth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040291-g001">Figure 1</xref>).</p><sec id="s2a"><title>Bmp Signaling and the <italic>bmp</italic> Synexpression Group</title><p>The site of Bmp signaling in the embryos of chordates and arthropods defines one pole of the Bmp-Chordin developmental axis.

Low levels of expression are also detected throughout the ectoderm. In later stages, its dorsal expression declines to undetectable levels (unpublished data). Tsg, a modifier of Bmp signaling, binds to Chordin and Tolloid to agonize or antagonize Bmp signaling, depending on the presence of yet other modifiers &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040291-b035">35</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040291-b037">37</xref>&#x0005d;.

In <italic>S. kowalevskii, cv-2</italic> is expressed on the dorsal midline (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040291-g002">Figure 2</xref>J) of the embryo. Like <italic>bambi</italic> and <italic>tsg,</italic> its expression diminishes in later stages. To conclude, five members of the <italic>bmp4</italic> synexpression group, originally identified in <named-content content-type="genus-species">D. melanogaster</named-content> and vertebrates, show dorsal midline domains of expression in <named-content content-type="genus-species">S. kowalevskii</named-content>. We thus find significant correlative evidence of Bmp signaling from this midline in hemichordates. In a later section of results, we will experimentally investigate the role of Bmp signaling in hemichordate dorsoventral patterning.</p><p>We also cloned an ortholog encoding Chordin, a Bmp antagonist, from <named-content content-type="genus-species">S. kowalevskii</named-content> and examined its expression in relation to the <italic>bmp</italic> domain. Expression begins in a sector of ectoderm of the early gastrula, the presumed prospective ventral side, since it is opposite the <italic>bmp2/4</italic> domain as shown by double in situ hybridization (see thumbnail photo). At early stages, its breadth of expression extends almost to the dorsal side in the mid-level ectoderm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040291-g002">Figure 2</xref>M&#x02013;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040291-g002">2</xref>P), though less extensively in the anterior and posterior ectoderm. At later stages, <italic>chordin</italic> expression remains broad, strongest in the mesosome and anterior metasome, and tapering off at the telotroch (a dense ciliated band) in the posterior metasome. Anteriorly, <italic>chordin</italic> is expressed in the ectoderm of the posterior prosome, tapering off toward the tip (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040291-g002">Figure 2</xref>O). By day 4, its expression shrinks to a small ventral patch in the anterior metasome, mesosome, and posterior prosome ectoderm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040291-g002">Figure 2</xref>P). This pattern of expression of <italic>chordin,</italic> centered on the ventral midline, strongly suggests that its encoded protein and Bmp on the dorsal side are involved in an antagonistic interaction, as found in other bilateral animals. In <named-content content-type="genus-species">S. kowalevskii</named-content> as well as <italic>Drosophila, chordin</italic> is only expressed in the ectoderm, whereas in <italic>Xenopus,</italic> it is expressed in both the ectoderm and mesoderm &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040291-b042">42</xref>&#x0005d;. In the course of development of <named-content content-type="genus-species">S. kowalevskii</named-content> to the hatched juvenile stages, the only domains of expression of <italic>chordin</italic> and <italic>bmp</italic> are the midline stripes described above; there are no secondary domains.</p><p>Another gene from the Bmp sub-family of transforming growth factor-beta signaling molecules, which encodes a protein with a key role in vertebrate organizer function, is <italic>anti-dorsalizing morphogenetic protein (admp).</italic> No <italic>admp</italic> ortholog has been found in <italic>Drosophila.</italic> Like Bmp2, 4, and 7, the Admp protein may bind to Chordin and be rendered inactive in signaling until the Tolloid protease releases it &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040291-b043">43</xref>&#x0005d;. Unlike the genes of other Bmps, <italic>admp</italic> appears to be co-expressed with <italic>chordin,</italic> not opposite it, and to be repressed by Bmps. According to current views, Admp acts like a Bmp signal in concert with the other Bmps, when released on their side of the embryo &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040291-b044">44</xref>&#x0005d;. We cloned the <named-content content-type="genus-species">S. kowalevskii</named-content> ortholog of <italic>admp</italic> from an expressed sequence tag collection. The ortholog is expressed on the ventral midline of embryonic ectoderm and also in some regions of ventral midline endoderm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040291-g002">Figure 2</xref>Q&#x02013;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040291-g002">2</xref>T). Expression begins in the ventral ectoderm and endoderm of the late gastrula (unpublished data). Thereafter, as the embryo elongates, ectodermal <italic>admp</italic> expression extends in a thin line from the anterior tip to the anus, interrupted only by the telotroch (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040291-g002">Figure 2</xref>Q). It is expressed directly opposite <italic>bmp2/4</italic> as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040291-g002">Figure 2</xref>R. At day 4, <italic>admp</italic> is still expressed along the ventral midline of the embryo; however, its level is much lower in the mesosome and anterior prosome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040291-g002">Figure 2</xref>S). Ventral endoderm expression of <italic>admp</italic> is most prominent in two domains; the more anterior of these in the metasome becomes more intense than the other by day 4 of development (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040291-g002">Figure 2</xref>S). Thus, as in chordates, <italic>chordin</italic> and <italic>admp</italic> are co-expressed in hemichordates on the side opposite Bmps. Unlike chordates, the hemichordate expression is in the ectoderm and endoderm, rather than in the mesoderm. Thus like <italic>chordin</italic> expression, <italic>admp</italic> does not identify organizer-like mesoderm in hemichordates.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Dorsally Restricted Domains of Target Gene Expression</title><p>Orthologs encoding seven transcription factors exhibit dorsal domains of expression in the different germ layers, providing evidence of a dorsoventral pattern of transcriptional regulation in hemichordates, previously unreported.

From a morphological and molecular perspective, the embryos are &#x0201c;dorsalized,&#x0201d; in a dose dependent manner (unpublished data). Treated embryos are cylindrical in shape, more elongated than normal, flattened at the proboscis tip, and lacking the dorsal flexure that normally results from asymmetric tissue extension. The mouth is absent, and instead of a thin neck, the mesosome is thickly connected to the prosome. Also the first gill slits are entirely lacking, although at very low levels of Bmp exposure (10 ng/ml) a deep circumferential groove forms in the ectoderm at the position along the anteroposterior axis at which the gill slits would first perforate. The organization of the anteroposterior axis is generally unaffected.</p><p>To supplement the morphological observations, we investigated the Bmp dependence of the expression of various genes in the three germ layers. First we assayed the expression of <italic>bmp2/4</italic> itself and found that this mRNA is elevated to detectable levels throughout the ectoderm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040291-g005">Figure 5</xref>D), rather than remaining localized to the dorsal midline as in control embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040291-g002">Figure 2</xref>A&#x02013;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040291-g002">2</xref>D).

Then we assayed five genes that, in normal embryos, are expressed on or near the dorsal midline in either the ectoderm or endoderm, as candidates for activation by Bmp. <italic>Dlx</italic>, as described earlier (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040291-g003">Figure 3</xref>A and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040291-g003">3</xref>B), is expressed in the ectoderm of the entire prosome &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040291-b045">45</xref>&#x0005d; and on the dorsal midline of the meso- and metasome. In Bmp-treated embryos, <italic>dlx</italic> expression expands into all meso- and metasomal ectoderm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040291-g005">Figure 5</xref>I). A similar Bmp dependence is found for <italic>tbx2/3,</italic> a gene also normally expressed on the dorsal midline (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040291-g003">Figure 3</xref>C and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040291-g003">3</xref>D). In Bmp-treated embryos, <italic>tbx2/3</italic> is expressed around the entire circumference of the embryo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040291-g005">Figure 5</xref>J). In the case of <italic>pitx,</italic> which has two ectodermal domains normally, the dorsal spot at the base of the proboscis expands in the presence of excess Bmp to encircle the base of the proboscis, along with underlying mesenchyme expression, as if repressed by Bmp. As further evidence of repression, <italic>chordin</italic> expression could not be detected in Bmp-treated embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040291-g005">Figures 5</xref>E and F).</p><p>Then we examined three genes normally expressed asymmetrically in the endoderm. <italic>Hex</italic> is normally expressed along the dorsal midline, with stronger expression anteriorly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040291-g003">Figures 3</xref>E and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040291-g005">5</xref>). After Bmp ligand treatment, this domain is expanded circumferentially most prominently in the anterior endoderm, but also at lower levels in posterior endoderm. Expression seems entirely down-regulated in the mid endoderm region, possibly at the level where gill slits would normally begin to develop (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040291-g005">Figure 5</xref>M). <italic>Pax 1/9</italic> is normally expressed as a bilateral pair of spots in the dorsolateral endoderm as the first gill slit pair forms &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040291-b045">45</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040291-b091">91</xref>&#x0005d;. In treated embryos, these spots expand to a ring of expression around the body (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040291-g005">Figure 5</xref>N). Similar results were also found with <italic>nk2.3/2.5,</italic> normally expressed on the dorsal midline of the endoderm, including the dorsal and medial region of the first gill slit pair. Like <italic>pax1/9, nk2.3/2.5</italic> expression expands to a ring encircling the entire endoderm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040291-g005">Figure 5</xref>O). As a final case, we chose <italic>admp</italic> as a candidate for Bmp repression since this gene is normally expressed only on the ventral midline of the ectoderm and endoderm. In Bmp-treated embryos, <italic>admp</italic> expression is indeed repressed, except for a residual small spot in the anterior endoderm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040291-g005">Figure 5</xref>P). Thus, uniform exposure of the embryo to excess Bmp protein activates the widespread expression of those genes normally expressed dorsally, and represses those normally expressed ventrally. These findings implicate dorsal midline Bmp in normal dorsoventral patterning in at least the ectoderm and endoderm.</p><p>We might expect very different effects of Bmp in specifying the nervous system of hemichordates. In <italic>Drosophila</italic> and vertebrates, Bmp represses neurogenesis, but in hemichordates there is no apparent segregation of ectoderm into neurogenic and epidermal territories. To test this, we examined the expression of <italic>elv,</italic> a pan neural gene &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040291-b045">45</xref>&#x0005d;.

In Bmp protein-exposed embryos, the expression of <italic>elv</italic> is not down-regulated; it is similar to controls along the anteroposterior axis and is expressed at uniform high levels around the embryo's circumference (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040291-g005">Figure 5</xref>G and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040291-g005">5</xref>H). Therefore, unlike insects and vertebrates, hemichordates do not have a gene regulatory circuit by which Bmp represses neural fates during early development.</p></sec><sec id="s2g"><title>Knockdown of Bmp by Small Interfering RNA</title><p>To further test the role of Bmp in dorsoventral patterning, we knocked down endogenous Bmp levels by injecting into the newly fertilized egg either a pool of small interfering RNA (siRNA) generated by the cleavage of the full-length transcript by the dicer enzyme or individual synthetic siRNAs directed against two different regions of the open reading frame of the <italic>bmp2/4</italic> mRNA. The phenotypes of the resulting embryos are identical and highly reproducible from all three kinds of materials and between injection runs. The embryos look normal throughout early stages; however, after gastrulation they fail to extend dorsally and remain cylindrical in organization, as we might expect from ventralized embryos. Anteroposterior organization is normal, as reflected by the fact that the prosome, mesosome, and metasome are set off by anterior and posterior grooves. On day 3, when the anterior groove would normally deepen on the ventral side to form the mouth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040291-g006">Figure 6</xref>A and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040291-g006">6</xref>B), the groove indents circumferentially and severs the mesosome from the prosome, which falls off (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040291-g006">Figure 6</xref>D&#x02013;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040291-g006">6</xref>F). Gill slits fail to form in the metasome. The telotroch remains close to the anus, and the posterior endoderm is wider than normal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040291-g006">Figure 6</xref>A and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040291-g006">6</xref>B). Overall, the effects of the siRNA injections to produce ventralized embryos complement those of Bmp ligand treatments to produce dorsalized embryos.</p><p>Indicative of the specificity of the anti-<italic>bmp</italic> siRNAs, control eggs injected with a scrambled siRNA sequence developed normally with a dorsoventral axis (unpublished data). Furthermore, when siRNA injected embryos were then treated with Bmp protein, they undertook Bmp-dependent gene expression, indicating that the siRNAs did not cause systemic damage unrelated to Bmp.</p><p>We examined the expression of four genes that normally have ventral domains and are therefore candidates for repression by endogenous Bmp from the dorsal side. As described earlier (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040291-g003">Figure 3</xref>L and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040291-g003">3</xref>M), <italic>netrin</italic> is expressed in a broad band on the ventral side at early stages and then restricts down to a thin stripe on the ventral midline. In anti-<italic>bmp</italic> siRNA injected embryos, <italic>netrin</italic> expression expands uniformly throughout the ectoderm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040291-g006">Figure 6</xref>F), indeed suggesting that Bmp normally represses <italic>netrin</italic> dorsally. As a second example, <italic>pitx</italic> expression is altered in the embryos from eggs injected with anti-<italic>bmp</italic> siRNAs; the posterior ventral domain of <italic>pitx</italic> expands uniformly throughout the ectoderm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040291-g006">Figure 6</xref>D) whereas the anterior dorsal spot of expression is absent from the detached prosome. These data on <italic>pitx</italic> from Bmp knockdown embryos complement the results from the Bmp over-expression assays and suggest strongly that Bmp normally represses the expression of <italic>pitx</italic> to a posterior ventral stripe in the metasome but activates its expression in the anterior dorsal spot on the proboscis. Third, we examined <italic>admp,</italic> which is normally expressed in a ventral stripe. In anti-<italic>bmp</italic> siRNA embryos, <italic>admp</italic> expression expands uniformly, especially in the proboscis where it becomes very intense (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040291-g006">Figure 6</xref>E). And fourth, in anti-<italic>bmp</italic> siRNA embryos, <italic>dlx</italic> expression in the prosome ectoderm remains patchy; however, the dorsal midline expression is absent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040291-g006">Figure 6</xref>C). Thus, Bmp is likely required for activation of <italic>dlx</italic> on the dorsal midline but not for prosome ectoderm expression.</p><p>In summary, Bmp2/4 activates and represses specific genes in the ectoderm, mesoderm, and endoderm germ layers to give unique dorsoventral patterns of expression in the embryonic body. Differences of Bmp availability along this axis are presumably related not only to the location of a Bmp source at the dorsal midline of the embryo and a Chordin (and perhaps Admp) source at the opposite midline, but also to the interactions of Bmp with a variety of modifiers encoded by genes of the Bmp synexpression group.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Discussion</title><p>The anatomical components of the dorsoventral axis of hemichordates have been recognized for decades, such as the opposed midline axon tracts, giant neurons &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040291-b092">92</xref>&#x0005d;, the heart/kidney complex &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040291-b064">64</xref>&#x0005d;, gill slits, gonads, body wall muscle, and tail &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040291-b093">93</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040291-b094">94</xref>&#x0005d;. However, the homology of these to candidate counterparts in chordates has been ambiguous, making problematic the comparisons along the dorsoventral axes of the two groups. Molecular and developmental comparisons have been impossible given the paucity of data from hemichordates. We have improved the basis for comparison by supplementing anatomical observations with molecular data. In particular, our finding of the polarized expression of <italic>bmp</italic> and <italic>chordin</italic> on the two midlines of the early embryo establishes the existence of a Bmp-Chordin axis to which we can relate the locations of various gene expression domains and anatomical specializations of the definitive dorsoventral axis of the animal. These midlines seem to be the only sites of <italic>bmp</italic> and <italic>chordin</italic> expression in the embryo and juvenile. Furthermore, we have tested the developmental importance of the Bmp-Chordin axis and have found that at least 13 candidate target genes, which normally have dorsal or ventral expression, predictably expand or contract their domains in line with Bmp availability, as do all the observable anatomical specializations. At uniform high levels of exogenous Bmp we obtain cylindrical dorsalized embryos, and in the absence of endogenous Bmp we obtain ventralized embryos. All aspects of dorsoventral organization of ectoderm and endoderm, and likely also mesoderm (for which we lack good marker genes), depend on the Bmp-Chordin axis in the <named-content content-type="genus-species">S. kowalevski</named-content> embryo. As concluded previously for chordates and arthropods, and now supported by the hemichordate findings, this Bmp-Chordin axis is truly a developmental axis underlying the definitive anatomical dorsoventral axis, and it may date back to the earliest bilateral animals &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040291-b001">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040291-b027">27</xref>&#x0005d;.</p><p>Furthermore, for comparisons with chordates, the Bmp-Chordin developmental axis of hemichordates can be defined intrinsically, without reference to unreliable features such as the orientation of the animal in the gravitational field or by the location of the mouth, features which have proven hard to compare across taxa. The expression of <italic>bmp</italic> mRNA at one pole of the Bmp-Chordin axis and <italic>chordin</italic> at the other suggests that a gradient of active Bmp protein across the embryo, high at the <italic>bmp</italic> pole and low at <italic>chordin,</italic> sets the quantitative conditions for selecting and organizing target gene expression. However, many modulators are known to affect the local level of active Bmp, such as the complexes it forms with Chordin, Tsg, and perhaps Cv-2, and its release from those complexes by the Tolloid protease &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040291-b095">95</xref>&#x0005d;. The Bmp midline is also the site of expression of <italic>bambi,</italic> encoding a pseudoreceptor of Bmp which is thought to inhibit Bmp auto-activation &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040291-b033">33</xref>&#x0005d; Furthermore, <italic>admp,</italic> which is expressed on the ventral midline, encodes a protein with Bmp-like action when released by Tolloid from its complex with Chordin, and then Admp acts through a receptor not used by Bmps &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040291-b044">44</xref>&#x0005d;. Also, Bmp antagonists exist besides Chordin, such as Noggin and DAN. Preliminary tests indicate that these are widespread in the ectoderm of S<italic>. kowalevskii,</italic> not concentrated at a midline (unpublished data). Thus, the concentration profile of active Bmp protein across the embryo may not be a monotonic gradient. Still, whatever its shape, we propose that the Bmp profile constitutes the fundamental developmental axis for the selection and placement of components of the eventual anatomical dorsoventral axis.</p><p>While the Bmp-Chordin axis is shared by chordates and hemichordates, it remains to compare what target genes and anatomical specializations are indeed selected and placed on the axis in the two groups. On the Bmp side, both groups place gill slits, coelomic mesoderm, a contractile heart-like dorsal vessel, and <italic>nk2.3/2.5</italic> expression; on the Chordin side, both groups place the post-anal tail, the majority of striated body wall muscle and motor neurons, and <italic>netrin1</italic> expression. These shared features, including their similar placements along the Bmp-Chordin axis, can be ascribed to the deuterostome ancestor, and some perhaps even to the bilateral ancestor. These features were just brought forward in the chordate lineage (hemichordate, too), not evolved anew within the lineage.</p><p>There are two prominent exceptions to the list of targets of the Bmp-Chordin axis shared by hemichordates and chordates, namely, the nervous system and the mouth. The hemichordate diffuse nervous system does not reveal a dorsoventral asymmetry of neurogenesis or neuron abundance; it develops throughout the ectoderm, even at the midline of <italic>bmp</italic> expression. In chordates (and <italic>Drosophila,</italic> too) the central nervous system develops near the source of Chordin, and the large epidermal territory develops near the Bmp source. In hemichordates, neurogenic and epidermal cells are finely intermixed throughout the ectoderm &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040291-b021">21</xref>&#x0005d;. In chordates and <italic>Drosophila,</italic> increased Bmp contracts the developing territory of neurogenic ectoderm, and expands the epidermal territory, whereas decreased Bmp results in the reverse effect &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040291-b090">90</xref>&#x0005d;. However, as shown here, the exposure of the hemichordate embryo to a uniform excess of exogenous Bmp protein, which up-regulates endogenous <italic>bmp</italic> gene expression around the body, does not cause the territory of neurogenesis to contract, as shown by the persistence of widespread pan-neural gene expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040291-g005">Figure 5</xref>H). This insensitivity of neurogenesis to Bmp in hemichordates, despite the presence of a Bmp-Chordin axis in the embryo, implies that the &#x0201c;anti-neurogenic phase&#x0201d; of Bmp signaling is absent in hemichordates.</p><p>Nonetheless hemichordates use the Bmp-Chordin axis for a second phase, the &#x0201c;morphogenetic phase&#x0201d; for patterning the three germ layers. The patterning of neuronal cell types within the diffuse nervous system is included in the patterning, for example, the giant neurons near the dorsal midline (the Bmp pole); a nerve tract rich in motor neuron axons at the ventral midline, a specialized patch of sensory neurons near the mouth, and a line of <italic>poxN</italic> expressing cells, perhaps specialized neurons, on the posterior dorsal midline. However, chordates appear to achieve much more patterning of neuronal cell types than do hemichordates. Indeed, the entire Bmp-Hh double gradient used by chordates to select and place ten gene expression domains in the dorsoventral axis of the neural tube &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040291-b096">96</xref>&#x0005d;, is absent from hemichordates. Hh is localized to the apical ectoderm and anterior gut in hemichordates; it has no dorsoventral expression. Whereas the neural tube domains of chordates include those of <italic>pax6, dbx, en, irx, nk2.2,</italic> and <italic>msx,</italic> none of these genes shows a dorsoventral domain in <named-content content-type="genus-species">S. kowalevskii</named-content> (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s2">Results</xref> here and in &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040291-b045">45</xref>&#x0005d;). Yet all of these are expressed in the hemichordate embryo in anteroposterior domains, as they are in chordates in domains additional to the dorsoventral domains. Particularly noteworthy are the <italic>nk2.2</italic> and <italic>msx</italic> domains since these are thought to have similar expression in <italic>Drosophila</italic> neurectoderm and the chordate neural tube &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040291-b015">15</xref>&#x0005d;. Yet they have no dorsoventral domains in <italic>S. kowalevskii.</italic> These differences suggest that much of the regulatory architecture involved in dorsoventral patterning of chordate nervous system evolved subsequent to the divergence of hemichordates and chordates. If true, the dorsoventral axis would have been a locus of much more evolution in chordates than was the anteroposterior axis since, as we showed previously &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040291-b045">45</xref>&#x0005d;, the gene expression domains of this axis are extensively similar in both groups, hence in the deuterostome ancestor.</p><p>Further analysis will be needed to determine if the neural default circuitry of the kind operating in vertebrates &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040291-b097">97</xref>&#x0005d; is entirely absent from hemichordates. If so, the circuitry and its role in segregating neural and epidermal territories must have arisen independently in the chordate and arthropod lines, and perhaps in other lines as well &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040291-b019">19</xref>&#x0005d;. Such segregation was presumably a key evolutionary step in the centralization of the nervous system, which is a major dorsoventral innovation. Presumably, intrinsic to the evolution of a restriction of neural and epidermal fates in the different lineages was the use in all lineages of the pre-existing Bmp-Chordin axis. Alternatively, hemichordates (and perhaps echinoderms) may have lost the central nervous system of a deuterostome ancestor, rendering it diffuse and presumably simplified. However, we think this unlikely because the domain map of anteroposterior neural patterning genes of hemichordates does not seem to be reduced in complexity relative to chordates &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040291-b045">45</xref>&#x0005d; and because the germ layers of hemichordates seem otherwise rich in dorsoventral differentiations, except for neural-epidermal segregation.</p><p>In the context of the Bmp-Chordin axis, we must last discuss the location of the mouth in hemichordates. It is on the Chordin side, as in <italic>Drosophila,</italic> but in chordates it is on the Bmp side. Chordates then, among protostomes and deuterostomes, would be the only group to have this mouth location, a conclusion reached by Nubler-Jung and Arendt &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040291-b025">25</xref>&#x0005d; from anatomical comparisons, now reinforced by our elucidation of the Bmp-Chordin axis in hemichordates. The recent finding of left-sided expression of <italic>pitx</italic> and <italic>nodal</italic> in sea urchin larvae has been presented as evidence that echinoderms are also uninverted &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040291-b059">59</xref>&#x0005d;, although direct comparisons of larval and adult body plans are problematic. Wherever the mouth is, that side is called ventral, by convention, thereby fixing the orientation of the anatomical dorsoventral axis. The inverse relation of the axes of chordates and arthropods was furthermore recognized by the positions of heart, coelomic mesoderm, body wall muscle, and nerve cords. Thus, the dorsoventral axis of chordates is the inverse of all other bilateral animals.</p><p>A venerable explanation of the inverse relationship is the inversion hypothesis (dating back to E. Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040291-b026">26</xref>&#x0005d;) in which a chordate ancestor inverted its entire body dorsoventrally and then moved the mouth to the opposite side (or the reverse order of events). Our current studies of altering Bmp levels in development indicate that mouth development is repressed by Bmp and hence it arises at the point farthest from Bmp, in the mesosome-metasome groove. Bmp-overexposed embryos lack a mouth, and Bmp-deficient embryos form a mouth circumferentially which causes the proboscis to fall off (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040291-g005">Figures 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040291-g006">6</xref>). The new mouth of chordates would seem to hold a new relationship to the Bmp-Chordin axis. The classical inversion hypothesis, despite its attractions, does not require the nervous system to have been already centralized before inversion occurred, even though such centralization is usually assumed. Our data raise the possibility that centralization and inversion are separate issues (outlined in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040291-g007">Figure 7</xref>). The ancestor, even with a diffuse system, could have inverted its body, which already had dorsoventral differences in the other germ layers, and then moved its mouth. Subsequently it could have centralized its nervous system to the Chordin side. Such a scenario works just as well, indicating that inversion can't be used to argue the existence of a central nervous system in the uninverted deuterostome or bilateral ancestor.</p><p>However, there are other ways to achieve inversion in chordates, other than assuming a major shift in the life history mode of an ancestor. One of the ways might be termed the &#x0201c;ectopic chordin hypothesis.&#x0201d; In chordates, Chordin is produced by both endomesoderm of Spemann's organizer, and the neurogenic region of the ectodermal blastula stage, at least in <named-content content-type="genus-species">Xenopus laevis</named-content> &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040291-b042">42</xref>&#x0005d; whereas in all other phyla, including hemichordates, the source of Chordin is exclusively the ectoderm. As shown here for hemichordates and elsewhere for other bilateral animals, all organs, tissues, and expression domains of the definitive dorsoventral axis depend on the Bmp-Chordin axis for their selection and placement. If this developmental axis were inverted during very early development, without moving the mouth-forming agency, all aspects of definitive dorsoventral organization would necessarily invert. In chordates, Bmp is produced &#x0201c;at large&#x0201d; in the ectoderm whereas the Chordin-Admp source is primarily localized in the chordamesoderm which arises from the archenteron/gut midline. Wherever the Chordin-Admp source is placed, this defines the Bmp-Chordin axis in chordates. Perhaps this new germ layer source, so different from ectoderm, evolved on the side opposite the mouth in a chordate ancestor, thus inverting the axis. To further these inquiries, we plan to examine the means by which the Bmp and Chordin stripes are placed opposite one another in the ectoderm of the hemichordate embryo, and the means of placement of the mouth.</p><p>Whatever the means by which the mouth and the central nervous system are produced in chordates, these studies reinforce the prominence of the Bmp-Chordin axis as a patterning mechanism in perhaps all bilaterian animals. The hemichordate <named-content content-type="genus-species">S. kowalevskii</named-content> seems to be an exceptional object for the study of the origin of the chordate body plan. This is in part because of the functional independence of the dorsal-ventral and anterior-posterior axes and the fact that patterning genes often appear dedicated to a single use and not used successively in new patterns. From our studies we can conclude that in the deuterostome lineage, the anteroposterior pattern, delineated by <italic>hox</italic> and other genes, may have been established very early, as a modest but significant modification of the bilaterian ancestor. In the dorsoventral dimension, the basic Bmp-Chordin axis would have been just as fundamental in the common lineage of bilaterians, but considerable modification of the subdivisions of this axis has certainly occurred in deuterostomes. The centralized nervous system of arthropods and vertebrates, so important in the previous theories of anatomical evolution of the bilateral organisms, may itself have arisen independently in both groups but built on the pre-existing Bmp-Chordin gradient. The studies in hemichordates suggest strongly that the chordate body plan emerged from the deuterostome ancestor's body plan by maintaining the anteroposterior patterning and the Bmp-Chordin gradient, but re-specifying features such as the mouth, the nervous system, and numerous details of dorsoventral patterning.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Eggs, embryos, and juveniles.</title><p>Adult <named-content content-type="genus-species">S. kowalevskii</named-content> were collected intertidally in September near Woods Hole, Massachusetts.

An ancestral secreted Bmp axis was involved in dorsoventral patterning of the three germ layers in the bilaterian ancestor. This ancestor we propose was characterized by a diffuse organization of its nervous system, shown by blue dots. A Bmp gradient was involved in dorsoventral patterning of all three germ layers. In the basal deuterostome and hemichordates the role of the Bmp gradient is conserved in general dorsoventral patterning. During chordate (and protostome) evolution, the existing Bmp/Chordin axis was co-opted for an additional developmental role in nervous system centralization.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="pbio.0040291.g007"/></fig><table-wrap id="pbio-0040291-t001" content-type="2col" position="float"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Bmp Levels Control Dorsoventral Domains of Gene Expression in <named-content content-type="genus-species">S. kowalevskii</named-content></p></caption><graphic xlink:href="pbio.0040291.t001"/></table-wrap></sec><fn-group><fn id="ack1" fn-type="con"><p><bold>Author contributions.</bold> CJL, MK, and JG conceived and designed the experiments.
