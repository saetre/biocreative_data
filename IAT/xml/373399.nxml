The nucleolus of the eukaryotic cell is densely packed with pre-ribosomal RNAs (pre-rRNAs) and a number of small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs) that are essential components involved in pre-rRNA processing &#x0005b;reviewed by Maxwell and Fournier (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh264c2">2</xref>) and Smith and Steitz (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh264c3">3</xref>)&#x0005d;. Maturation of rRNAs is achieved by post-transcriptional events including methylation, pseudouridylation and multiple cleavages, resulting in the generation of mature 18S, 5.8S and 25&#x02013;28S rRNA species in all eukaryotic cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh264c4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh264c5">5</xref>). These processes are accomplished via various <italic>cis</italic>-acting elements within pre-rRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh264c6">6</xref>) and a number of non-ribosomal <italic>trans</italic>-acting factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh264c7">7</xref>). Although the outline of the pre-rRNA processing pathway is roughly understood and the structures of two ribosomal subunits have recently been solved by X-ray crystallography and cryoelectron microscopy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh264c8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh264c9">9</xref>), little is understood about how ribosome biogenesis is controlled in eukaryotic cells and whether it is linked to more complex biological events, such as developmental processes in multicellular organisms.</p><p>Mrd1p was initially given this name because it contains multiple copies of an RNA-binding domain called RBD, also known as RRM (RNA recognition motif), and was recently shown to be a member of the group of non-ribosomal proteins that are involved in pre-rRNA processing in the yeast <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh264c10">10</xref>). In yeast, Mrd1p is essential for viability and its depletion leads to a decrease in the levels of mature 18S rRNA and 40S ribosome and concomitant accumulation of 18S rRNA precursors, whereas 25S rRNA processing is not affected. Since Mrd1p can associate with pre-rRNA and two components of U3 small nucleolar ribonucleoprotein complex (snoRNP), Mrd1p is also likely to be a component of U3 snoRNP, which is known to be required for 18S rRNA processing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh264c11">11</xref>). Since Mrd1p homologs are found in a wide range of metazoans, the homologs may also be involved in pre-rRNA processing. Indeed, in the dipteran <italic>Chironomus tentans</italic>, a homologous protein (Ct-RBD-1) is localized mainly in the nucleus and is likely to be involved in 18S rRNA processing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh264c12">12</xref>). Interestingly, RNA interference (RNAi)-mediated depletion of the <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> homolog RBD-1 (according to its gene name in the database) and a truncation mutation in the zebrafish homolog Npo causes various developmental abnormalities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh264c12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh264c13">13</xref>). These observations imply that there may be the linkage between ribosome biogenesis and developmental events in multicellular organisms. However, the question as to whether the developmental abnormalities are correlated with defects in ribosome biogenesis still remains to be examined, since there is no direct evidence for the involvement of RBD-1 or Npo in pre-rRNA processing.</p><p>To address the question of this possible correlation, we examined in detail the role of RBD-1 in both ribosome biogenesis and development in <italic>C.elegans</italic>. We found that RBD-1 depletion by RNAi inhibits processing of 18S rRNA and subsequent formation of the 40S ribosomal subunit, and causes various developmental abnormalities simultaneously, indicating its essential role in pre-rRNA processing and development in <italic>C.elegans</italic>. We also found that RBD-1 is localized in the nucleolus, like Mrd1p and Ct-RBD-1 and that its zygotic expression starts in late embryos, although transcription of pre-rRNA by RNA polymerase I is known to start as early as the one-cell stage. We observed a similar expression pattern during embryogenesis for a component of U3 snoRNP, FIB-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh264c14">14</xref>), a <italic>C.elegans</italic> homolog of the yeast Nop1p, which is an essential factor for 18S rRNA processing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh264c15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh264c16">16</xref>). These results provide evidence for the linkage between ribosome biogenesis and developmental events in multicellular organisms and imply that transcription and processing of pre-rRNA may be regulated differentially during early embryogenesis in <italic>C.elegans</italic>.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Construction of GFP reporter gene fusion</title><p>The reporter construct expressing green fluorescent protein (GFP) under the control of the <italic>rbd-1</italic> promoter was made as follows.

To measure the levels of RBD-1 expression, we used synchronized populations at each developmental stage. Western blot analyses with anti-RBD-1 antibody reveal that RBD-1 is expressed constantly during the four larval stages and the adult stage, whereas the RBD-1 expression level in embryos is significantly lower than that at other stages (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh264f1">1</xref>A). This suggests that RBD-1 expression is downregulated during embryogenesis. Consistently, immunostaining of embryos shows that RBD-1 expression is limited to late embryonic stages (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh264f1">1</xref>B). Interestingly, a small amount of maternally supplied RBD-1 is also detectable in the fertilized egg (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh264f1">1</xref>B, a and b: arrowhead). In contrast to zygotic RBD-1, maternal RBD-1 is seen as a number of granules in the cytoplasm and disappears shortly after cleavage begin, suggesting that maternal RBD-1 may be degraded rapidly in early embryos. To confirm the downregulation of RBD-1 in early embryos, we utilized a transgenic strain carrying the GFP gene under the control of the native promoter for the <italic>rbd-1</italic> gene and monitored GFP fluorescence from a single embryo (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh264f1">1</xref>C). As expected, prominent GFP fluorescence from the <italic>rbd-1</italic> reporter gene is seen at the beginning of the morphogenesis stage, but not at the gastrulation stage, and persists with a gradual increase throughout subsequent embryogenesis. Interestingly, FIB-1, a <italic>C.elegans</italic> homolog of the yeast Nop1p, which is an essential component of U3 snoRNP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh264c14">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh264c16">16</xref>), shows a very similar expression pattern to RBD-1 during <italic>C.elegans</italic> embryogenesis (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh264f1">1</xref>D).</p><p>During post-embryonic development, RBD-1 is expressed ubiquitously in L1 larvae and continues to be expressed until adulthood in both somatic and germline cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh264f2">2</xref>A, a&#x02013;f). To determine the subcellular localization of RBD-1, we closely inspected intestine cells since they have relatively large nuclei, making it possible to easily discriminate the cell compartments (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh264f2">2</xref>B). As evidenced by its colocalization with a nucleolar marker protein FIB-1, RBD-1 is localized in the nucleolus. These results show that RBD-1 is a nucleolar protein, like its counterparts in yeast and <italic>C.tentans</italic>, and is expressed ubiquitously after the late embryonic stage.</p></sec><sec><title>RBD-1 is essential for <italic>C.elegans</italic> development</title><p>To determine the possible function of RBD-1 during development of <italic>C.elegans</italic>, RNAi by injection was performed using adult hermaphrodites, and the phenotypes of the F1 progeny from the injected hermaphrodites were analyzed. RNAi of <italic>rbd-1</italic> has no visible effects on embryogenesis, but causes various abnormalities during post-embryonic development (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh264f3">3</xref>). After hatching, all F1 progeny exhibit growth retardation (Gro: 100&#x00025;, <italic>n</italic> &#x0003d; 870). Approximately half of them show severe larval phenotypes such as larval lethality or arrest (Lvl or Lva: 24.8&#x00025;) and defective molting (Mlt: 20.7&#x00025;, Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh264f3">3</xref>B), resulting in larval death. The remaining progeny grow to adulthood but show abnormal gonad formation (Gon: 24.9&#x00025;, Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh264f3">3</xref>C) and protruded vulva (Pvl: 12.9&#x00025;, Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh264f3">3</xref>D).</p><p>In addition, most of the <italic>rbd-1(RNAi)</italic> adult hermaphrodites show malformation of the surface cuticle structure. In particular, the alae, which are protruding ridges formed over each lateral row of hypodermal seam cells, are abnormal in most <italic>rbd-1(RNAi)</italic> hermaphrodites. In wild-type animals, three lines of alae are seen along each lateral side of the animal (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh264f3">3</xref>E). In contrast, in <italic>rbd-1(RNAi)</italic> hermaphrodites, the alae were disconnected at many points, increase in number or are severely deformed (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh264f3">3</xref>F&#x02013;H). These observations show that RBD-1 is required for various developmental processes in <italic>C.elegans</italic>.</p></sec><sec><title>Inhibition of 40S ribosomal subunit formation by RBD-1 depletion</title><p>It has been reported that depletion of Mrd1p reduces 18S rRNA synthesis and the formation of 40S ribosomal subunits in yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh264c10">10</xref>). To test whether RBD-1 is also involved in ribosomal biogenesis, we performed RNAi of <italic>rbd-1</italic> by soaking to deplete RBD-1 in <italic>C.elegans</italic> and analyzed the ribosome profile in <italic>rbd-1(RNAi)</italic> animals. The level of RBD-1 decreases significantly and concomitantly the level of 18S rRNA decreases to &#x0223c;60&#x00025; as compared with the wild-type level, whereas 26S rRNA is not affected (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh264f4">4</xref>A&#x02013;C). Simultaneously, depletion of RBD-1 causes a prominent change in the ribosome profile in a sucrose density gradient (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh264f4">4</xref>D). As expected, the formation of 40S subunits is severely inhibited in <italic>rbd-1(RNAi)</italic> animals. Accordingly, the level of 80S ribosome (a complex of 40S and 60S ribosomal subunits) decreases significantly in such animals, accompanied by a relative increase of the level of 60S ribosomal subunits. Thus, we concluded that RBD-1 is essential for ribosome biogenesis through 18S rRNA synthesis in <italic>C.elegans</italic>, like Mrd1p in yeast.</p></sec><sec><title>Pre-rRNA processing in <italic>C.elegans</italic></title><p>In many organisms, mature 18S, 5.8S and 28S rRNAs are generated from a single pre-rRNA by multiple processing events that remove the external transcribed sequence (ETS) and internal transcribed sequence (ITS). However, there was no information about <italic>C.elegans</italic> pre-rRNA processing so far. Therefore, we decided to examine the outline of the pre-rRNA processing pathway in <italic>C.elegans</italic> by northern blot analysis using RNA probes which are specific to distinct regions of the primary rRNA transcript (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh264f5">5</xref>). Probes 1 and 2 correspond to the positions within the putative 5&#x02032; ETS region. The probe 1 region includes a predicted TATA-like sequence for transcription by RNA polymerase I (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh264f5">5</xref>C, boxed sequence). Since RNA polymerase I transcription initiates just downstream of TATA-like sequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh264c26">26</xref>), it is expected that probe 1 hybridizes to the 5&#x02032; end of the primary pre-rRNA. On the other hand, probe 2 hybridizes with the region just before the 5&#x02032; end of 18S rRNA (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh264f5">5</xref>A, site I). These two probes detect the same three kinds of rRNA intermediates <bold>a</bold>, <bold>b</bold> and <bold>d</bold> (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh264f5">5</xref>B, lanes 1 and 2). Judging from the size, the largest band <bold>a</bold> corresponds to the pre-rRNA containing 18S, 5.8S and 26S rRNAs. Since both bands <bold>b</bold> and <bold>d</bold> are detected with a probe for the 18S rRNA coding region (data not shown), these RNA species are intermediates for 18S rRNA. Considering that there is no difference between the bands detected with probes 1 and 2, it is likely that there is no major processing site within the 5&#x02032; ETS region of <italic>C.elegans</italic> pre-rRNA, although we could not exclude the possibility that the probe 1 region contains an additional processing site.</p><p>To examine the processing sites within the ITS region, we used four probes (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh264f5">5</xref>B, lanes 3&#x02013;6). Probes 3&#x02013;5 correspond to the positions between the 3&#x02032; end of 18S rRNA (site II) and the 5&#x02032; end of 5.8S (site V). Probe 6 corresponds to the position immediately downstream of the 3&#x02032; end of 5.8S rRNA (site VI). Probe 3 detects bands <bold>a</bold>, <bold>b</bold> and <bold>d</bold>, as do probes 1 and 2, confirming that there is no major processing site in the 5&#x02032; ETS region. Probe 4 detects bands <bold>a</bold>, <bold>d</bold> and also a new <bold>c</bold>&#x02032;, but not band <bold>b</bold>. Probe 5 detects bands <bold>a</bold> and <bold>c</bold>&#x02032;, but not bands <bold>b</bold> and <bold>d</bold>. Probe 6 detects bands <bold>a</bold> and <bold>c</bold>&#x02032; and a new band <bold>c</bold>. Considering the sizes of these bands, bands <bold>b</bold> and <bold>d</bold> correspond to the intermediates for 18S rRNA with different 3&#x02032; ends, band <bold>c</bold>&#x02032; corresponds to the intermediate for 5.8S and 26S rRNAs, and band <bold>c</bold> corresponds to the intermediate for 26S rRNA. These results indicate that there are at least two processing sites in the ITS1 region: one (site III) lies between site II and the 5&#x02032; end of the probe 4 region, and the other (site IV) within the probe 4 region. It should be noted that the probe 4 region encompasses the site IV.</p><p>Finally, we examined the processing sites in the putative 3&#x02032; ETS region using probes 7&#x02013;9 which are complementary to the positions between the 3&#x02032; end of 26S rRNA (site VIII) and the probe 1 region (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh264f5">5</xref>B, lanes 7&#x02013;9). Only band <bold>a</bold> is detected with these three probes, although the signal with probe 9 is very faint. In addition, we noticed that the hybridization signals for band <bold>a</bold> are relatively weak with probes 7&#x02013;9 as compared with those with probes 1&#x02013;6. This is possibly because band <bold>a</bold> includes at least two pre-rRNAs: the major one lacks the 3&#x02032; ETS region, and the minor one contains the 3&#x02032; ETS region, and these two pre-rRNAs cannot be resolved under our gel electrophoresis conditions because of their relatively large sizes. Although we could not identify any processing site in the 3&#x02032; ETS region in this study, the results suggest that transcription termination of the primary pre-rRNA transcript occurs near the probe 9 region. We do not know the precise sites for transcription initiation and termination of the primary pre-rRNA transcript, but it is likely that both sites exist within the region encompassing the probes 9 and 1, since there are two putative TATA-like sequences and a T-rich sequence within the region which may function for initiation and termination of RNA polymerase I, respectively (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh264f5">5</xref>C). The results also suggest that the elimination of the 3&#x02032; ETS region is very rapid since the amount of the 3&#x02032; ETS-containing pre-rRNA(s) is very low at the steady state, consistent with the previous finding that rRNA processing is initiated by rapid cleavage within the 3&#x02032; ETS region of the primary transcript (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh264c27">27</xref>).</p><p>Taken together, the outline of the pre-rRNA processing pathway in <italic>C.elegans</italic> is depicted in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh264f5">5</xref>A. There are at least eight processing sites in the primary pre-rRNA including both ends of mature rRNAs. We do not exclude the possibility that there are more processing sites for very short-lived rRNA intermediates, especially in the 3&#x02032; ETS region.</p></sec><sec><title>Inhibition of 18S rRNA processing by RBD-1 depletion</title><p>Since we have clarified the outline of the pre-rRNA processing pathway in <italic>C.elegans</italic>, we then compared the processing patterns of pre-rRNAs between the wild-type and <italic>rbd-1(RNAi)</italic> animals to examine in which steps of pre-rRNA processing RBD-1 is involved (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh264f6">6</xref>). The most prominent differences are the levels of mature 18S rRNA and the band <bold>d</bold> intermediate. In <italic>rbd-1(RNAi)</italic> animals, the amount of mature 18S rRNA significantly decreases, whereas the amount of the band <bold>d</bold> intermediate significantly increases (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh264f6">6</xref>B, see probes 1, 3, 4, 18S). This indicates that cleavage at the site III in the band <bold>d</bold> intermediate is inhibited by RBD-1 depletion and that the site III processing is a rate-limiting step for 18S rRNA synthesis. In contrast, the levels of the band <bold>c</bold> and <bold>c</bold>&#x02032; intermediates are not affected in <italic>rbd-1(RNAi)</italic> animals, indicating that cleavages at site IV and its downstream sites do not depend upon RBD-1. In addition, the amount of the band <bold>a</bold> intermediates slightly increases in <italic>rbd-1(RNAi)</italic> animals. As discussed later, the accumulation of the band <bold>a</bold> intermediates suggests an additional processing site in the 5&#x02032; ETS region. Taken together, these findings indicate that RBD-1 is involved at least in the site III processing during <italic>C.elegans</italic> 18S rRNA synthesis.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>In this study, we have clarified for the first time the outline of the pre-rRNA processing pathway in <italic>C.elegans</italic> and shown that a nucleolar RNA-binding protein, RBD-1, is required for 18S rRNA processing in <italic>C.elegans</italic>. The requirement of RBD-1 for 18S rRNA processing is essentially the same conclusion as that reported by Jin <italic>et al</italic>. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh264c10">10</xref>) for the yeast counterpart Mrd1p, but we extend the functional conservation of RBD-1 to a multicellular organism. We have also shown that zygotic expression of both RBD-1 and FIB-1 only starts in late embryos and that RBD-1 depletion affects various developmental processes in <italic>C.elegans</italic>.</p><p>Previous studies on yeast pre-rRNA processing have shown that processing of 18S rRNA includes multiple cleavages at the sites A<sub>0</sub>, A<sub>1</sub> and A<sub>2</sub>, and requires the U3 snoRNP function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh264c27">27</xref>). Interaction of the hinge region of U3 snoRNA with a short segment upstream of the A<sub>0</sub> site is required for the cleavages at the sites A<sub>0</sub>, A<sub>1</sub> and A<sub>2</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh264c28">28</xref>). In addition, interaction of the Box A sequence of U3 snoRNA with two internal segments of 18S rRNA forms a pseudoknot structure and is required for the cleavages at the sites A<sub>1</sub> and A<sub>2</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh264c29">29</xref>). These previous findings clearly show that U3 snoRNP binds the segments and promotes the 18S rRNA processing. The sites I, II and III in <italic>C.elegans</italic> correspond to the A<sub>1</sub>, D and A<sub>2</sub> in yeast, respectively, and the cleavage of these sites apparently depends upon the RBD-1 function, since the site III processing is inhibited in association with the reduction of the level of mature 18S rRNA in <italic>rbd-1(RNAi)</italic> animals. In this study, we could not identify the cleavage site in <italic>C.elegans</italic> which corresponds to the yeast A<sub>0</sub> site. Such an A<sub>0</sub>-like site may exist in the 5&#x02032; ETS region in <italic>C.elegans</italic> pre-rRNA, especially in the probe 1 region, although we could not examine the possibility in this study. Cleavage of the putative A<sub>0</sub>-like site may also depend upon the RBD-1 function, on the analogy of the dependence of A<sub>0</sub> site cleavage upon the function U3 snoRNP in yeast. If this is the case, the band <bold>a</bold> accumulation in <italic>rbd-1(RNAi)</italic> animals (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh264f6">6</xref>) can be explained as a result from the defect of the A<sub>0</sub>-like site cleavage. In addition, we have identified two cleavage sites, III and IV, in the <italic>C.elegans</italic> ITS1 region, which correspond to the yeast A<sub>2</sub> and A<sub>3</sub> sites, respectively. In contrast, there is only a single A<sub>3</sub>-like site in the ITS1 region in <italic>Xenopus</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh264c30">30</xref>), suggesting some diversity in the pre-rRNA cleavage sites even in the higher eukaryotes.</p><p>The detailed mechanism of how U3 snoRNP functions in 18S rRNA processing still remains unclear. Recently, more than dozens of core components of U3 snoRNP have been identified in yeast using mass spectrographic analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh264c31">31</xref>). Surprisingly, Mrd1p is not a member of the core components of U3 snoRNP, although it is also required for 18S rRNA processing in yeast, as does RBD-1 in <italic>C.elegans</italic>. Thus, it is conceivable that many extrinsic factors may be required for proper 18S rRNA processing other than U3 snoRNP. The mode of action of Mrd1p and its homologs including RBD-1 is not known at present, but one could speculate that they may transiently associate with pre-rRNA and/or U3 snoRNP, and help the function of U3 snoRNP for 18S rRNA processing, since they contain multiple RNA-binding domains and are required for all U3 snoRNP-involved cleavages.</p><p>An important outcome of this study is the clear demonstration of the linkage of ribosome biogenesis with several developmental events. Bj&#x000f6;rk <italic>et al</italic>. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh264c12">12</xref>) described briefly that RNAi of <italic>rbd-1</italic> causes various developmental phenotypes in <italic>C.elegans</italic>, as we observed in this study. However, they did not show any evidence for the RBD-1 function in 18S rRNA processing in <italic>C.elegans</italic>. In this respect, our results provide direct evidence for the first time that ribosome biogenesis is involved in developmental regulation in multicellular organisms. Previous studies in bacteria and yeast have demonstrated that cell growth (increase in cell size and number) is correlated closely with an increase in both protein synthesis and ribosome biogenesis &#x0005b;reviewed in Nomura <italic>et al</italic>. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh264c32">32</xref>)&#x0005d;. In higher eukaryotes, this correlation is seen in the diminished transcription of rRNAs during quiescence and the subsequent increase after stimulation with growth factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh264c33">33</xref>). Studies of hypertrophy in vertebrate cardiomyocytes have also linked rRNA and 5S RNA synthesis with control of cell size (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh264c34">34</xref>). These studies suggest that regulators of ribosome biogenesis may play an important role in cellular growth control. From this point of view, some of the phenotypes that we observed in <italic>rbd-1(RNAi)</italic> animals, such as the molting defect and cuticle malformation, seem to be closely related to protein synthesis. During the molting and subsequent growth processes, drastic and rapid changes occur in the nematode surface structures, and thus rapid massive production of proteins should be required for such processes. Accordingly, it appears that an insufficient quantity of 40S ribosomal subunits caused by RBD-1 depletion disturbs such rapid protein synthesis, resulting in severe defects in molting and cuticle formation. Since it is well known that RNAi efficiency varies with the dosage of dsRNA delivered in individual animals, target genes and cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh264c35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh264c36">36</xref>), it is not surprising that various phenotypes emerge upon RNAi of <italic>rbd-1</italic>. More complete inhibition of 18S rRNA synthesis by efficient RNAi of <italic>rbd-1</italic> seems to lead to fatal effects, such as larval arrest and lethality that we observed in this study. Consistent with this, RNAi of <italic>fib-1</italic> showed only such severe phenotypes (our unpublished data). An alternative explanation for the phenotypes caused by RNAi of <italic>rbd-1</italic> is that RBD-1 may have a specific role for cuticle formation in addition to the role for 18S rRNA processing, like yeast Nop7p and Nop15p that are not only required for 28S rRNA processing but also have critical functions in DNA replication and cytokinesis, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh264c37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh264c38">38</xref>).</p><p>Another important finding of this study is that RBD-1 is not present in early embryos, although 18S rRNA synthesis should require RBD-1. We have also shown similar limitation of the expression to late embryogenesis and thereafter for a component of U3 snoRNP, FIB-1, which is thought to be required for 18S rRNA synthesis in <italic>C.elegans</italic>. These observations imply that processing of 18S rRNA may be repressed in early embryos. It is likely that only the maternal stock of ribosomes is utilized for protein synthesis in early embryos and that such maternal ribosomes would have been fully consumed in late embryos. Thus, zygotic RBD-1 should start to be expressed in late embryos to newly synthesize 18S rRNA. Interestingly, it was reported that zygotic transcription of pre-rRNA starts as early as the one-cell stage and persists thereafter in <italic>C.elegans</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh264c39">39</xref>). Thus, the apparent absence of RBD-1 and FIB-1 in early embryos raises the possibility for the first time that transcription and processing of pre-rRNA are uncoupled during early embryogenesis.</p></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="display-objects"><title>Figures and Tables</title><fig id="gkh264f1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p> Expression of RBD-1 in <italic>C.elegans</italic> during development.
