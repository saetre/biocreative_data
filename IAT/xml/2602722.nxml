Although SUMO-specific proteases are known to reverse sumoylation in many defined systems, their importance in mammalian development and pathogenesis remains largely elusive. Here we report that SENP2 is highly expressed in trophoblast cells that are required for placentation. Targeted disruption of SENP2 in mice reveals its essential role in development of all three trophoblast layers. The mutation causes a deficiency in cell cycle progression. SENP2 has a specific role in the G&#x02013;S transition, which is required for mitotic and endoreduplication cell cycles in trophoblast proliferation and differentiation, respectively. SENP2 ablation disturbs the p53&#x02013;Mdm2 pathway, affecting the expansion of trophoblast progenitors and their maturation. Reintroducing SENP2 into the mutants can reduce the sumoylation of Mdm2, diminish the p53 level and promote trophoblast development. Furthermore, downregulation of p53 alleviates the SENP2-null phenotypes and stimulation of p53 causes abnormalities in trophoblast proliferation and differentiation, resembling those of the <italic>SENP2</italic> mutants.

An important function of p53 as a guardian of the genome ensures that the genetic information is properly propagated during these processes. In this study, we discovered that mice with disruption of SENP2, an enzyme that removes small molecular signals (called SUMO) that modify a protein's behavior and stability, are unable to form a healthy placenta as a result of deficiencies in the formation of various trophoblast cell types that give rise to the placenta. In the mutants, SUMO modification of Mdm2, a protein that monitors the cellular levels of p53, is deregulated. The loss of SENP2 causes dislocation of Mdm2, leading to aberrant stimulation of p53. The precursor cells known as trophoblast stem cells rely on p53 to proliferate and differentiate into specialized polyploid cells, which contain multiple copies of chromosomes. In <italic>SENP2</italic> mutants, all three trophoblast layers were substantially defective, with the layer containing mainly the polyploid cells most severely affected and diminished.

The trophoblast stem (TS) cells in the mural trophectoderm, distal to the ICM, stop dividing but continue to duplicate their genomes, a mechanism known as endoreduplication.

As development proceeds, the trophoblast progenitors give rise to three distinct layers in rodents&#x02014;labyrinth, spongiotrophoblast and TGCs&#x02014;to form a functional placenta acting as the maternal&#x02013;fetal interface &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060310-b006">6</xref>&#x0005d;.

The labyrinth is formed by extensive branching morphogenesis of the labyrinth trophoblast and endothelial cells &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060310-b008">8</xref>&#x0005d;. The maternal blood passes through the small spaces of the labyrinth, directly contacting the fetal trophoblast cells to ensure exchange between the two blood systems. The labyrinth layer is supported structurally by the spongiotrophoblast cells, which are mainly derived from the ectoplacental cone and which form a layer separating the labyrinth from the TGC. The simplicity of placental cell lineages makes the placenta a valuable model system for understanding general aspects of development, including branching morphogenesis, lineage-specific determination, cell invasion, and polyploidy, crucial for cancer development and metastasis.</p><p>SENP2 belongs to a family of proteases that remove a small ubiquitin-related modifier (SUMO) from protein substrates. SUMO (also known as sentrin), which regulates posttranslational modification of proteins, is a member of the ubiquitin-like modifier family &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060310-b009">9</xref>&#x0005d;. This covalent conjugation process is reversible and highly evolutionary conserved from yeasts to humans &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060310-b010">10</xref>&#x0005d;. Unlike ubiquitination, which has a well-established role in targeting protein degradation, SUMO modification is involved in protein trafficking, cell cycle, cell survival, and cell death &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060310-b011">11</xref>&#x0005d;. SUMO conjugation of proteins can alter their function, activity, or subcellular localization. Many sumoylated proteins have been shown to accumulate preferentially in specific complexes such as the nuclear pore and PML (promyelocytic leukemia) bodies &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060310-b012">12</xref>&#x0005d;. Similar to ubiquitination, sumoylation requires processing, conjugation, and transfer. The transfer process, which covalently conjugates SUMO polypeptides to their targets, is catalyzed by E3 ligases &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060310-b013">13</xref>&#x0005d;. The reverse desumoylation process is mediated by SUMO proteases. The hallmark of these proteases is the highly conserved carboxyl-terminal SENP domain of &#x0223c;200 amino acids. SENP2, which is found in three different alternatively spliced forms, has been localized to the nucleus, cytoplasmic vesicles and PML nuclear bodies &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060310-b014">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060310-b016">16</xref>&#x0005d;. Although SENPs have been shown to catalyze SUMO modification in various physiological systems, their roles in mammalian development and pathogenesis are mostly unknown.</p><p>We previously discovered an interaction of SENP2 with Axin &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060310-b017">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060310-b018">18</xref>&#x0005d;, a key signaling regulator for the canonical Wnt pathway. To determine the role of SENP2 in cellular signaling and the importance of SUMO modification in trophoblast development, we initiated a genetic analysis in mice. A SENP2-null mouse strain was created by gene targeting in embryonic stem (ES) cells. We found that the disruption of SENP2 leads to developmental defects in all three trophoblast layers. SENP2 is essential for the G&#x02013;S transition of both the mitotic and the endoreduplication cell cycles, which control the expansion of trophoblast precursors and the maturation of TGCs, respectively. In the mutants, the loss of SENP2 caused a deregulation of Mdm2, resulting in p53 stimulation. We also present evidence to support an essential role of SENP2 in modulating the p53&#x02013;Mdm2 circuit that underlies genome replication in mitosis and polyploidy during trophoblast development.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Expression of SENP2 in Trophoblast Development</title><p>To determine the role of SENP2 and the importance of SUMO modification in trophoblast development, we first examined its expression pattern.

These abnormalities are likely caused by a deficiency in endopolyploidy. An important specialized process for TGC maturation is endoreduplication, whereby the genome is amplified without a complete mitosis.

The results implied that there is a deficiency in p53 regulation caused by the SENP2 deletion. Degradation of p53 is mediated by ubiquitination-dependent proteolysis.

We therefore tested whether the loss of SENP2 had an effect on Mdm2. Immunostaining of Mdm2 revealed its localization in both the <italic>SENP2<sup>&#x0002b;/&#x0002b;</sup></italic> cytoplasm and the nucleus during early stages (E8.5&#x02013;E9.5) of TGC development (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060310-g009">Figure 9</xref>G and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060310-g009">9</xref>H). However, Mdm2 was mainly located to the nuclei of the terminally differentiated TGCs at E10.5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060310-g009">Figure 9</xref>I). The differential subcellular distribution of Mdm2 implies that it might be critical for development of TGCs. In contrast, Mdm2 accumulated in nuclei throughout TGC development in the absence of SENP2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060310-g009">Figure 9</xref>J&#x02013;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060310-g009">9</xref>L).

Furthermore, the loss of SENP2 also affected Mdm2 localization in the stem cell niche sites, such as extraembryonic ectoderm and chorion. Mdm2 clearly accumulated in the nuclei of the <italic>SENP2<sup>&#x02013;/&#x02013;</sup></italic> trophoblast progenitors, but was evenly distributed in the whole cells of the controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060310-g009">Figure 9</xref>M and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060310-g009">9</xref>N). Similar nuclear accumulations of Mdm2, affecting the p53 level, were also detected in the <italic>SENP2<sup>&#x02013;/&#x02013;</sup></italic> labyrinth and spongiotrophoblast layers (data not shown). Therefore, Mdm2 appeared to be aberrantly localized in the stem cell niches and all three major layers of trophoblast during early embryogenesis. The data suggest that SENP2 is required for proper localization of Mdm2 and degradation of p53. Disturbance of SUMO modification by the SENP2 deletion thus causes deregulation of the p53&#x02013;Mdm2 pathway, leading to deficiencies in mitotic and endoreduplication cell cycle progression and abnormal trophoblast development.</p><fig id="pbio-0060310-g009" position="float"><label>Figure 9</label><caption><title>SENP2 Regulates the p53&#x02013;Mdm2 Circuit During Trophoblast Development</title><p>(A&#x02013;N) Sections of the E7.5 (M,N), E8.5 (A,D,G,J), E9.5 (B,E,H,K) and E10.5 (C,F,I,L) <italic>SENP2<sup>&#x0002b;/&#x0002b;</sup></italic> or <italic>SENP2<sup>&#x0002b;/&#x02013;</sup></italic> (A&#x02013;C,G&#x02013;I,M) and <italic>SENP2<sup>&#x02013;/&#x02013;</sup></italic> (D&#x02013;F,J&#x02013;L,N) placentas were stained with an anti-p53 (A&#x02013;F) or anti-Mdm2 antibody (G&#x02013;N).

In addition to altering the subcellular distribution of Mdm2, the loss of SENP2 had an effect on posttranslational modification of Mdm2. The loss of SENP2 disturbed desumoylation of Mdm2.

We encountered a technical problem in determining the actual amount of the sumoylated Mdm2 by immunoprecipitation&#x02013;immunoblot analysis. This is likely because desumoylation occurs rapidly in isolated cell extracts whereas immunoprecipitation requires proteins in a native conformation. Therefore, a straight immunoblot assay appears to be better suited for quantitative measurements. To determine whether SUMO modification of Mdm2 is regulated by SENP2, a plasmid expressing a Myc-tagged SENP2 (MT&#x02013;SENP2) under the control of a CMV promoter was transiently transfected into the mutants. The reintroduction of SENP2 altered the ratio of Mdm2 and Mdm2&#x02013;SUMO and diminished the level of Mdm2&#x02013;SUMO, suggesting that its desumoylation is modulated by SENP2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060310-g009">Figure 9</xref>O).

The p450scc induction level did not reach that of the <italic>SENP2<sup>&#x0002b;/&#x0002b;</sup></italic> TGCs, most likely due to the transfection efficacy, in that not all of the mutants were transfected.

This suggests that SENP2 inactivation is the cause of the trophoblast developmental defects observed in the mutants.

We therefore investigated whether Mdm2 localization is affected by SUMO. First, immunoblot analysis after cell fractionation showed that sumoylated Mdm2 is found preferentially in the nuclear fraction of <italic>SENP2<sup>&#x02013;/&#x02013;</sup></italic> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060310-g009">Figure 9</xref>R). Next, we examined whether SUMO conjugation alters the subcellular distribution of Mdm2 in live cells. GFP analysis of TS cells transiently expressing GFP-tagged Mdm2 or Mdm2&#x02013;SUMO-1, revealed their preferential localization. We found that Mdm2 mainly accumulated in the cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060310-g009">Figure 9</xref>S and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060310-g009">9</xref>V), with occasional distribution to the whole cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060310-g009">Figure 9</xref>T). However, Mdm2&#x02013;SUMO-1 displayed a clear nuclear accumulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060310-g009">Figure 9</xref>U), with either a punctated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060310-g009">Figure 9</xref>W) or a nucleolar (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060310-g009">Figure 9</xref>X) staining pattern. Similar results were also obtained by the use of Mdm2&#x02013;SUMO-1<sup>GG96&#x02013;97&#x00394;</sup>, a mutant lacking the last two glycine residues of SUMO-1, which prevent further conjugation that might affect subcellular distribution (data not shown). Therefore, the SENP2 mediated SUMO modification of Mdm2 appears to be crucial for its subcellular trafficking.</p></sec><sec id="s2j"><title>The Requirement for p53 in Mediating the Deficiencies of SENP2-Null Mutants</title><p>To address the importance of p53 in mediating the SENP2-null phenotype, we tested whether p53 activation is necessary and sufficient to affect trophoblast proliferation and differentiation.

All three major trophoblast layers were affected by SENP2 deficiency. Our data provide an important connection between SENP2 and the p53&#x02013;Mdm2 pathway in trophoblast development. The loss of SENP2 caused a deficiency in the G&#x02013;S transition, which is required for both the mitotic cell cycle (containing G1, S, G2, and M phases) and the endocycle (containing only the G and S phases) during trophoblast proliferation and differentiation, respectively. The cell cycle regulators p53 and Mdm2 appear to be critical for SENP2-dependent trophoblast mitosis and polyploidy. We propose that the SENP2&#x02013;Mdm2&#x02013;p53 pathway has a dual role in the G&#x02013;S checkpoint of mitotic division and endoreduplication (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060310-g011">Figure 11</xref>A). Although high levels of p53 induce a G1 arrest, a low level may be necessary to go through the rest of mitosis, such as through the tetraploid checkpoint. Because of the omission of M phase in endoreduplication, repression of p53 is essential to produce polyploid cells. Our findings further suggest that SENP2-dependent SUMO modification controls the subcellular localization of Mdm2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060310-g011">Figure 11</xref>B). Sumoylated Mdm2, which preferentially accumulates in the nucleus, likely cannot modulate p53, whereas desumoylated Mdm2, which can move freely to the cytoplasm, is capable of p53 degradation.</p><fig id="pbio-0060310-g011" position="float"><label>Figure 11</label><caption><title>Model for the SENP2&#x02013;Mdm2&#x02013;p53 Pathway in Trophoblast Development</title><p>(A) Diagram illustrating the p53&#x02013;Mdm2 circuit regulated by SENP2 in the trophoblast cell cycle.

An endoreduplication deficiency was previously observed in embryos lacking cyclin E proteins &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060310-b041">41</xref>&#x0005d;. In contrast to the SENP2-null deficiencies, the loss of cyclin E proteins did not affect TGC differentiation. It is conceivable that cyclin E, which functions in late G1 phase to promote S-phase entry, acts further downstream of the SENP2&#x02013;Mdm2&#x02013;p53 pathway. In the SENP2 mutants, we detected alterations of this regulatory pathway not only in the stem cell niche site, but also in the differentiated trophoblast layer.

Polyploid cells have several different fates. They can arrest in the cell cycle mediated by the tetraploidy checkpoint, which then triggers apoptosis.

The nature of trophoblast development provides a system to elucidate the regulatory mechanism underlying polyploidy. Because of the biochemical activity of SENP2, the SENP2-null model offers a unique opportunity to further investigate the modulation of the p53&#x02013;Mdm2 circuit by SUMO in normal developmental programming of polyploidy. The knowledge obtained here might be applicable to malignant transformation processes associated with polyploidy.</p><p>SENP2 is also known as Axam, which has been shown to modulate Wnt signaling by interacting with Axin, a scaffold protein involved in targeting &#x003b2;-catenin for degradation &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060310-b014">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060310-b017">17</xref>&#x0005d;.

However, we identified the p53&#x02013;Mdm2 pathway as a downstream target of SENP2. Our data imply that SUMO modification mediated by SENP2 is required for proper localization and function of Mdm2, which in turn controls p53 stability during trophoblast development. Not only does stimulation of p53 induce phenotypic defects resembling those of the SENP2 inactivation, but downregulation of p53 alleviates the trophoblast deficiencies caused by SENP2 deficiency. It is conceivable that Wnt or JNK/SAPK signaling regulated by SENP2 is critical for another cell type and lineage development. The generation of mouse models permitting conditional inactivation of SENP2 will aid these studies and determine its essential role in other developmental processes.</p><p>The loss of SENP2 disturbs the balance of SUMO modification. Although sumoylation of Mdm2 has been described &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060310-b047">47</xref>&#x0005d;, it was not clear whether this modification dictates subcellular distribution. Our data provide evidence that cellular distribution of Mdm2 is regulated by the SUMO pathway. Disruption of SENP2, leading to an accumulation of Mdm2 in a hyper-sumoylated state, induces its mislocalization. Many sumoylated proteins, including PML, preferentially accumulate in specific complexes called PML nuclear bodies &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060310-b012">12</xref>&#x0005d;. Sumoylation of PML is essential not only for these nuclear bodies to form but also for other sumoylated proteins to concentrate there. Although the biological function of PML nuclear bodies remains largely elusive, subsequent recruitment of proteins can modulate transcription activity. It has been shown that sumoylation of PML directs p53 to nuclear bodies, leading to a stimulation of its transcriptional and pro-apoptotic activities &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060310-b048">48</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060310-b049">49</xref>&#x0005d;.

Because of technical limitations and, more importantly, SUMO regulation of a number of p53 regulators (Mdm2, MdmX, and PML), the functional consequences of sumoylation have been difficult to elucidate.

Briefly, each blastocyst was placed in a culture dish with mitomycin C-treated MEF feeders and cultured in a humidified 5&#x00025; CO<sub>2</sub> incubator at 37 &#x000b0;C. The blastocysts were hatched and attached to the dishes in 24&#x02013;36 h. After 48 h, a small outgrowth from a blastocyst was formed and cultured in TS medium containing 25 ng/ml FGF4 and 1 ng/ml heparin. After 72&#x02013;96 h, the outgrowths were ready to be disaggregated by the addition of 0.25&#x00025; trypsin/EDTA and incubation for 3 min at 37 &#x000b0;C. The disaggregated cells were continuously cultured in TS medium with the presence of FGF4 and heparin. The TS cell colonies began to appear after days 6 to 10, and continued to be cultured until they were about 50&#x00025; confluent. After expanding the cultures on the feeders for one or two passages, MEF-free TS cells were obtained and maintained in media containing 70&#x00025; MEF-conditioned medium, 30&#x00025; TS medium, 37.5 ng/ml FGF4, and 1.5 ng/ml heparin.

For BrdU labeling of the cultured cells, 30 &#x003bc;g/ml BrdU (Sigma) was added in the media for 1 h. The labeled cells were then fixed with methanol/acetone (1:1), followed by immunostaining analysis. For cell cycle analysis by flow cytometry, 8 &#x000d7; 10<sup>5</sup> (for mitotic cell cycle) or 10<sup>5</sup> (for endoreduplication cycle) TS cells were cultured in 6 cm dishes in TS media plus FGF4, heparin, and MEF-conditioned medium (undifferentiated medium) for 2 d, and TS media only (differentiated medium) for 6 d, respectively. Cells were then harvested by trypsinization and fixed in 70&#x00025; ethanol at 4 &#x000b0;C for at least 24 h. Cells were then treated with RNase (1 mg/ml) for 30 min, followed by PI staining (20 &#x003bc;g/ml) for 10 min at room temperature. Samples were analyzed by an Epics Elite ESP (Coulter Electronics) set to collect 10,000 events. The percentage of cells in G0&#x02013;G1, S, G2&#x02013;M or with polyploidy were determined using ModFit LT software. For synchronizing cells in M phase, 3 &#x003bc;M nocodazole was added to the media.
