Cellular re-arrangements and modified metabolism of the syncytia are accompanied by massive intra- and intercellular solute allocations. In this study the expression of all genes annotated as sugar transporters in the Arabidopsis Membrane Protein Library was investigated by Affymetrix gene chip analysis in young and fully developed syncytia compared with non-infected <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> roots. The expression of three highly up-regulated (<italic>STP12</italic>, <italic>MEX1</italic>, and <italic>GTP2</italic>) and three highly down-regulated genes (<italic>SFP1</italic>, <italic>STP7</italic>, and <italic>STP4</italic>) was analysed by quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR). The most up-regulated gene (<italic>STP12</italic>) was chosen for further in-depth studies using <italic>in situ</italic> RT-PCR and a nematode development assay with a T-DNA insertion line revealing a significant reduction of male nematode development. The specific role of <italic>STP12</italic> expression in syncytia of male juveniles compared with those of female juveniles was further shown by qRT-PCR. In order to provide evidence for sugar transporter activity across the plasma membrane of syncytia, fluorescence-labelled glucose was used and membrane potential recordings following the application of several sugars were performed. Analyses of soluble sugar pools revealed a highly specific composition in syncytia. The presented work demonstrates that sugar transporters are specifically expressed and active in syncytia, indicating a profound role in inter- and intracelluar transport processes.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Electrophysiology</kwd><kwd>gene chip</kwd><kwd><italic>Heterodera schachtii</italic></kwd><kwd><italic>in situ</italic> RT-PCR</kwd><kwd>sugar transporter</kwd><kwd>syncytium</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The obligate plant parasitic cyst nematode <italic>Heterodera schachtii</italic> infects roots of <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> in which it induces syncytial feeding cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Sijmons <italic>et al.</italic>, 1991</xref>). Unisex second-stage juveniles (J2) invade the roots and move intercellularly towards the central cylinder. There, they pierce one single cell with their stylet and release gland secretions which induce a dramatic re-organization of the tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Wyss, 1992</xref>). Local cell wall dissolution commences at plasmodesmata of the affected cells and leads to the formation of a syncytium consisting of up to several hundred cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Grundler <italic>et al.</italic>, 1998</xref>). Along with syncytium formation, the central vacuole fragments into several small vesicles, the nuclei enlarge, and cell organelles such as the smooth endoplasmatic reticulum, plastids, and mitochondria proliferate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Golinowski <italic>et al.</italic>, 1996</xref>). Turgor pressure rises and osmotic potential drops in syncytial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">B&#x000f6;ckenhoff, 1995</xref>), reflecting high metabolic activity, elevated sucrose levels, and the formation of starch (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hofmann <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">2008</xref>). The altered metabolisms of the affected root cells involve increased allocation of metabolites such as soluble sugars. Sugar transporters enable intra- and intercellular trafficking, ensure sugar retrieval, or act as direct sugar providers in connection with membrane-bound enzymes. Sugar import into syncytia also follows the symplasmic path during later stages of development, although most syncytia of early-stage females and males are symplasmically isolated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hoth <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Hofmann and Grundler, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hofmann <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>). The different mechanisms of long- and short-distance transport towards and into nematode feeding sites have recently been reviewed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Hofmann and Grundler, 2007<italic>a</italic></xref>). To date, there have been two studies on the expression of two sucrose transporters in nematode-induced syncytia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Juergensen <italic>et al.</italic>, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hofmann <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>). Given the 85 sugar transporter genes listed in the Arabidopsis Membrane Protein Library (AMPL <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="www.cbs.umn.edu/arabidopsis/">www.cbs.umn.edu/arabidopsis/</ext-link>), these two represent only a small part of the picture. The large number of transporters reflects their different specific roles in physiology and development. In order to understand sugar transport mechanisms in syncytia it is therefore crucial to investigate the expression of a wide spectrum of sugar transporter genes in comparison with control roots. Affymetrix gene chip analysis is a valuable tool to study a large variety of expressed genes in various tissues. Such experiments have been performed for different plant&#x02013;nematode interactions such as <italic>Meloidogyne incognita</italic> on <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> or tomato, and <italic>Heterodera glycines</italic> on soybean (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Puthoff <italic>et al.</italic>, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Bar-Or <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Hammes <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Jammes <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Ithal <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Hammes <italic>et al.</italic> (2005)</xref> studied changes of transporter gene expression in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> roots containing nematode galls induced by <italic>M. incognita</italic>. According to this study, sucrose and amino acid transporters as well as aquaporins are amongst the most highly regulated genes.</p><p>Data on the expression of sugar transporter genes give only a first hint of their possible role in cells. The actual activity is further determined by translation, protein turnover, allosteric control, competitive inhibition, and phosphorylation. Most sugar transporters operate by exploiting the proton-motive force. They are primarily energized by the activity of a proton pump (H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase) which carries protons outside a membrane and thereby generates a concentration difference of &#x0223c;100-fold. Movement of H<sup>+</sup> through the plasma membrane can be measured as a transient depolarization.</p><p>Here a transcript analysis of all annotated sugar transporter genes expressed in syncytia induced by <italic>H. schachtii</italic> is presented. Six highly regulated sugar transporter genes were selected for quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) analysis and the most highly up-regulated gene was studied in detail. Electrophysiological recordings and transport studies with fluorochrome-labelled glucose confirmed the activity of sugar transporters in the syncytium plasma membrane. As a result of this combined molecular and physiological approach, it was demonstrated that transporters play a pivotal role in sugar transport into and within nematode-induced syncytia.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Plant and nematode culture</title><p>Sterile <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> wild-type (Col) seeds were sown on 0.2% Knop medium and grown at 16&#x02009;h light/8&#x02009;h dark and 21&#x02009;&#x000b0;C.

Plants were grown on sugar-free medium in order to restrict the sugar supply to the syncytia and nematodes to naturally occurring transport mechanisms. Two weeks after inoculation plants were screened for the development of female and male nematodes and the infection rate per cm root length was calculated (raw data are shown in <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://jxb.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/erp0138/DC1">Supplementary Table S3</ext-link> at <italic>JXB</italic> online).

As most of the regulated transporter genes in syncytia are monosaccharide transporters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1B</xref>), fluorochrome-labelled glucose was used (2-NBD-glc, see Material and methods) for <italic>in situ</italic> transport studies. 2-NBD-glc was previously used for uptake experiments into walled plant cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Etxeberria <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>).

Thus, syncytia and attached nematodes were screened for fluorescent signals 8&#x02009;h after loading. The fluorochrome was detected in almost all syncytia and nematodes already at 3 dai (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4A</xref>, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://jxb.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/erp0138/DC1">Supplementary Table S2</ext-link> at <italic>JXB</italic> online).

Since male juveniles induce syncytia of much smaller size than female juveniles this analysis was technically restricted to syncytia associated with female animals. The most pronounced depolarization occurred after fructose and glucose application, which may indicate the highest transport potential for these sugars. While sucrose showed an intermediate reaction, depolarization after raffinose application was the lowest. The profiles suggest that phloem-derived sucrose and raffinose in the apoplast are imported as such or may be cleaved by the activity of cell wall-bound invertase and taken up by the syncytia as hexoses.</p><fig id="fig5" position="float"><label>Fig. 5.</label><caption><p>Typical changes in the syncytial transmembrane potential in response to application of different sugars.

In nematode-induced syncytia, however, <italic>SUC1</italic>, <italic>GTP1</italic>, and <italic>VGT1</italic> transcript levels were not regulated and <italic>SFP1</italic> and <italic>TMT1</italic> were significantly down-regulated. The most highly up-regulated gene in syncytia was that of the membrane transporter STP12 which is mainly expressed in flowers and seeds (Genevestigator: https://<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.genevestigator.ethz.ch">www.genevestigator.ethz.ch</ext-link>). It was the only considerably up-regulated gene coding for a transmembrane transporter. Further, the genes for two plastidial transporters (<italic>MEX1</italic> and <italic>GTP2</italic>) were amongst the most highly up-regulated genes in syncytia indicating an induced starch metabolism as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hofmann <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>). The results show that the most highly regulated sugar transporter gene in galls (<italic>SUC1</italic>) was not regulated in syncytia and none of the transporter genes highly regulated in syncytia was mentioned to be differentially expressed in galls (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Hammes <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>). Transcriptome analyses often show that several genes are up-regulated and others down-regulated within multigene families. This phenomenon was also found in the present work in the case of the ERD family. While some ERD genes were clearly down-regulated (At1g08930, At1g20450, and At3g20460), others (At2g48020, At4g19120, and At3g05400) were up-regulated. Individual genes of multigene families are often dedicated to specific functions in relation to developmental stages or plant organs, as may be the case here.</p><p>The expression levels of the three strongly up-regulated genes <italic>STP12</italic>, <italic>MEX1</italic>, and <italic>GTP2</italic> and the strongly down-regulated genes <italic>SFP1</italic>, <italic>STP7</italic>, and <italic>STP4</italic> (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>) were chosen to be tested by qRT-PCR. Analysing highly up- and down-regulated genes gives information about processes induced in syncytia and thus important for nematode parasitism and those processes that have a negative influence or have no specific role for nematode development and therefore become silenced. The first analysed gene is <italic>STP12</italic> (At4g21480), a member of the &#x02018;sugar transporter protein&#x02019; (STP) gene family.

Nematode-induced syncytia contain many plastids in which high levels of starch are stored (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hofmann <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>). <italic>GPT2</italic> (At1g61800) also codes for a putative plastidial translocator representing the main route for plastidial glc-6P/P import in non-photosynthetic active tissues. It has been described to be involved in sugar sensing as it is highly induced by application of sucrose and glucose (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Gonzali <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>). Further, <italic>GPT2</italic> is induced in the starchless <italic>pgm</italic> mutant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Gonzali <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>) and the <italic>SUC2</italic>-deficient <italic>pho3</italic> mutant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Lloyd and Zakhleniuk, 2004</xref>) that are both characterized by increased levels of soluble sugars. The presence of plastid-specific transporters supports previous results that starch storage is employed for regulating sugar levels in syncytia. <italic>GTP2</italic> was one of the few genes showing a significantly altered expression in 5 dai and 15 dai syncytia. Its induction at 15 dai indicates a higher starch metabolism requiring more glc-6P at that stage.</p><p>Amongst the strongest down-regulated genes was <italic>SFP1</italic> (At5g27350), a senescence-related monosaccharide transporter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Quirino <italic>et al.</italic>, 2001</xref>) responsible for sugar export. Syncytia are strong sink tissues in plants characterized by import processes so that the silencing of <italic>SFP1</italic> is evident. The two strongest down-regulated hexose transporters were <italic>STP4</italic> (At3g19930) and <italic>STP7</italic> (At4g02050). Presently, there is no information about <italic>STP7</italic> available, but <italic>STP4</italic> has been characterized as sink specific and stress regulated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Truernit <italic>et al.</italic>, 1996</xref>). Interestingly, <italic>STP4</italic> was induced by wounding, bacterial elicitors, and pathogen challenge, and was suggested specifically to supply hexose to cover the increased energy demand of infection sites. The down-regulation of this transporter in syncytia suggests that nematodes do not induce general plant defence responses in syncytia.</p><p>While most results of the qRT-PCR confirmed the gene chip results, at 15 dai deviations between dissected and microaspirated syncytial samples were detected. <italic>STP12</italic> transcript levels decreased in syncytium-enriched root samples, but the gene was up-regulated in microaspirated syncytial content hybridized onto gene chips as well as measured by qRT-PCR. Further in-depth studies were performed on the hexose transporter <italic>STP12</italic> that was the most strongly up-regulated gene in the chip analysis. Transcripts of the transporter were specifically localized in syncytial cells by <italic>in situ</italic> RT-PCR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3</xref>). A possible scenario may be that the transporter is down-regulated in the neighbouring cells in order to increase the efficiency of sugar uptake into syncytia. An additional line of evidence for the functional role of the transporter was created using a T-DNA insertion mutant. Transcription disruption led to a significant reduction of nematode development that affected males in particular. Most syncytia of male juveniles have previously been shown to remain isolated from the phloem (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Hofmann and Grundler, 2006</xref>). Further, juveniles developing into males induce smaller syncytia in the pericycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Sobczak <italic>et al.</italic>, 1997</xref>). Probably this site of syncytium induction makes a symplasmic connection to the phloem improbable. Therefore, syncytia should be more dependent on intracellular sugar transporters than syncytia of female juveniles. In fact, this is reflected by increased transcript levels of <italic>STP12</italic> in syncytia of male juveniles and their more sensitive response to the lack of <italic>STP12</italic> expression in the mutant line. Thus additional evidence is provided that the organization of syncytia of males differs remarkably from that of females.</p><p>In order to show active sugar transport across the plasma membrane, phloem loading with the fluorescent 2-NBD-glc and electrophysiological measurements of transmembrane potentials were performed. Even though syncytia have been reported to be connected to phloem elements especially at later stages of development, this appears not to contradict the additional sugar import by transporters via the plasma membrane. Loading experiments with different types of labelled molecules result in different patterns of import into the syncytium. While experiments with CFDA indicate the symplasmic isolation of the majority of young syncytia, loading of 2NBD-glc gives evidence for the activity of sugar transporters in almost all young syncytia. Therefore, physiological analyses clearly demonstrate the activity of hexose transporters in the studied system that is closely related to transporter gene expression. Hexoses may primarily be imported by genes of the STP family. Next to <italic>STP12</italic> that was the most highly up-regulated gene in syncytia, <italic>STP1</italic> and <italic>STP3</italic> could also play a role in hexose transport as both genes are expressed to a considerable extent in syncytia. In another plant&#x02013;nematode interaction, the importance of glucose transporters for nematode-induced giant cells appeared to be minor. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Jones <italic>et al.</italic> (1975)</xref> found no effect on the membrane potential of the plasma membrane of giant cells induced by <italic>M. incognita</italic> in roots of <italic>Impatiens balsamina</italic> in response to glucose application. Glucose was one of the predominant monosaccharides in syncytia; however, it was not accumulated significantly. Glucose underlies high turnover rates since it is the primary substrate for many polysaccharides such as starch that is formed in syncytia in order to balance high osmotic pressure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hofmann <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>). By performing electrophysiological analyses, sucrose and raffinose could also be identified as being imported into syncytia by transporter activity. According to transcript analyses, sucrose is primarily imported into syncytia by the products of <italic>SUC1</italic>, <italic>SUC2</italic> and <italic>SUC4</italic>. The expression pattern of <italic>SUC2</italic> and <italic>SUC4</italic> in nematode-induced syncytia has been studied previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Juergensen <italic>et al.</italic>, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hofmann <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>). Due to the moderate regulation of the sucrose transporters&#x02019; gene expression in syncytia, the physiological analyses suggest that their activity is regulated at a metabolic level. Sucrose was, after glucose, the dominant soluble sugar in syncytia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hofmann <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>). Its significantly increased levels indicate a specific role as an import sugar or as short-term storage, decreasing the osmotic potential of hexoses. Further, raffinose and trehalose levels were increased significantly in syncytia compared with control roots (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6</xref>). Both sugars have been described to be essential during drought stress or desiccation. Raffinose is the second major transport sugar in the phloem of <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Haritatos <italic>et al.</italic>, 2000</xref>) but trehalose usually accumulates at rather low levels (&#x02264;0.15&#x02009;&#x003bc;g g<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> fresh weight) in plants (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Schluepmann <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>). Recently, much attention was focused on trehalose and its effects on plant growth, development, and stress resistance in view of its intriguing regulatory effects (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Rolland <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>). Due to structural similarities to sucrose, trehalose was proposed to be an important device for sugar signalling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Ramon and Rolland, 2007</xref>). So far, no trehalose or raffinose transporter genes have been identified in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>; however, several sugar transporters have been described with a high affinity for one substrate while transporting others with lower efficiencies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Gahrtz <italic>et al.</italic>, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Ludwig <italic>et al.</italic>, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Meyer <italic>et al.</italic>, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Sherson <italic>et al.</italic>, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chandran <italic>et al.</italic>, 2003</xref>). Therefore, raffinose and trehalose may be transported by less specific sucrose transporters. The measured sugars levels may also result from metabolic processing of carbohydrates.</p><p>In conclusion, the present data clearly support the hypothesis that sugar transporters play a pivotal role in the sugar transport and carbohydrate processing in nematode-induced syncytia in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> and are therefore important for the development of the cyst nematode <italic>H. schachtii</italic> in this host.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary data</title><p>The following <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://jxb.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/erp0138/DC1">supplementary data</ext-link> are available at <italic>JXB</italic> online.</p><p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://jxb.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/erp0138/DC1"><bold>Table S1.</bold></ext-link> Gene chip analysis of 5- and 15-d-old syncytia in comparison with non-infected root pieces.
