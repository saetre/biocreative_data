Previously, we and others have shown that both proteins form a functional complex that regulates glycogen synthesis by a novel mechanism involving ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation of at least two proteins, glycogen synthase and R5/PTG.

LD initially manifests during adolescence with generalized tonic-clonic seizures, myoclonus, absences, drop attacks and visual hallucinations. As the disease proceeds, a rapidly progressive dementia with apraxia, aphasia and visual loss ensues, leading patients to a vegetative state and death, usually within the first decade from onset of the first symptoms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005907-Ganesh1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005907-DelgadoEscueta1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>).

We and others have recently described that laforin interacts physically with malin and that laforin recruits specific substrates to be ubiquitinated by malin, targeting them for proteasomal degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005907-Lohi1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005907-Gentry1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005907-SolazFuster1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>). In fact, it has been described that the laforin-malin complex is involved in the degradation of the muscle isoform of glycogen synthase <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005907-Vilchez1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>, the glycogen debranching enzyme (AGL) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005907-Cheng1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>, and some glycogen targeting subunits of type 1 protein phosphatase (PP1), such as R5/PTG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005907-SolazFuster1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005907-Vilchez1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005907-Worby1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>) and R6 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005907-Worby1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>. Recently, an alternative function of laforin on glycogen homeostasis has been described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005907-Worby2">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005907-Tagliabracci1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>). In this case, laforin acts as a phosphatase of complex carbohydrates and it has been proposed that this function might be necessary for the maintenance of normal cellular glycogen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005907-Gentry2">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005907-Tagliabracci2">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>). Taken together, these results define the importance of the laforin-malin complex in regulating glycogen biosynthesis. This is consistent with the accumulation of glycogen-like intracellular inclusions (Lafora bodies), as one of the histological determinants of LD. However, it is still under debate whether the accumulation of Lafora bodies is the cause of the disease or if they are only the result of a previously established neurodegeneration.</p><p>Lafora bodies contain around 90&#x00025; glucose polymers and 6&#x00025; protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005907-Sakai1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005907-Yokoi1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>). They stain positive for anti-ubiquitin and anti-advanced glycation end products antibodies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005907-Ganesh2">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>, which suggest that they contain misfolded proteins destined for degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005907-Lohi1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005907-Ganesh2">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>). For this reason, it has been proposed that LD is a disorder of protein clearance <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005907-DelgadoEscueta1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>. Consistent with this idea, it has been described recently that laforin and malin form centrosomal aggregates when the cells are treated with proteasomal inhibitors, being these aggregates immunoreactive to ubiquitin, ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes, proteasomal subunits and chaperones, demonstrating their aggresome-like properties <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005907-Mittal1">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref>. It is known that aggresome formation is a general cell response which occurs when the capacity of the proteasome is exceeded by the production of misfolded proteins. These proteins have a strong tendency to aggregate, which results in an impairment of proteasomal function since the capacity of the proteolytic machinery is saturated by non-degradable material <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005907-Grune1">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Impairment of proteasomal function leads, among other effects, to the induction of stress at the endoplasmic reticulum (ER-stress), probably by the inhibition of ER-associated degradation (ERAD, see below), which eventually leads to apoptotic cell death <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005907-Seki1">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref>. ER function is highly sensitive to stresses that perturb cellular energy levels, red-ox status or Ca&#x0002b;&#x0002b; concentration. Such stresses reduce the folding capacity of the ER, which results in the accumulation and aggregation of unfolded proteins in the lumen. These events trigger a signal responsible for the activation of the unfolded protein response (UPR), resulting in restoration of ER function. In addition, unfolded proteins are retrotranslocated to the cytosol, polyubiquitinated and degraded by the proteasome by the ER-associated degradation (ERAD) pathway. The UPR pathway is characterized by the activation of two ER-resident kinases (PKR-like ER kinase, PERK; and the inositol-requiring protein 1, IRE1) and the translocation to the Golgi apparatus and subsequent cleavage of ATF6, a transmembrane ER-resident protein with a cytosolic domain with transcriptional activity. These components induce signaling cascades that lead to the overexpression of characteristic UPR-mediators, such as the heat shock protein BIP/Grp78, the protein disulphide isomerase PDI, the transcriptional factor CHOP (a member of the C/EBP family of bZIP transcription factors that induce apoptosis) and the phosphorylated form of the eukaryotic initiation factor 2 alpha (p-EIF2&#x003b1;), among others (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005907-Ron1">&#x0005b;25&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005907-Yoshida1">&#x0005b;26&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005907-Schroder1">&#x0005b;27&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005907-Lin1">&#x0005b;28&#x0005d;</xref>, for review).</p><p>Since laforin and malin are localized at the ER (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005907-Mittal1">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005907-Ganesh3">&#x0005b;29&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005907-Ianzano1">&#x0005b;30&#x0005d;</xref>), we tested whether they were affecting the ER-unfolded protein response pathway. In this work, we show that under conditions of laforin depletion, two different human cell lines Hek293 and SH-SY5Y, increase their sensitivity to agents triggering ER-stress, and this correlates with impairment of the ubiquitin-proteasomal pathway and increased apoptosis. Additionally, in both a mouse Epm2a-/- model and in necropsies from a human LD patient with mutations in the <italic>EPM2A</italic> gene, we detected higher levels of ER-stress markers, indicating that in the absence of laforin, cells were under permanent conditions of ER-stress, probably due to an impairment of proteasomal function. These data suggest that proteasomal dysfunction and ER-stress play an important role in the pathogenesis of LD.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>1.- Lack of laforin enhances cell sensitivity to agents that induce endoplasmic reticulum stress</title><p>To test the possible involvement of laforin in the ER-unfolded protein response pathway (UPR), we depleted Hek293 cells of laforin by siRNA silencing.

We then checked for the presence of UPR-markers such as the heat shock protein BIP/Grp78 and the transcriptional factor CHOP (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s1">Introduction</xref>). Under standard growth conditions, short-term laforin depletion did not increase the levels of these markers. However, if cells were treated with thapsigargin, an ER-stress producing agent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005907-Yoshida1">&#x0005b;26&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005907-Schroder1">&#x0005b;27&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005907-Lin1">&#x0005b;28&#x0005d;</xref>), laforin-depleted cells accumulated significantly higher levels of BIP/Grp78 and CHOP than control non-depleted cells (see quantification of the levels of the proteins in the right panel of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005907-g001">Fig. 1A</xref>).

These results indicated that laforin prevented the induction of ER-stress markers upon thapsigargin treatment.

These results indicated that under conditions of ER-stress, loss of laforin impaired proteasomal function.

In addition, we decided to study the effect of long-term laforin depletion. To this end, we constructed a plasmid expressing a shRNA based on oligo #2108 (pSUPER-Laf) that was introduced in SH-SY5Y cells to select stable transfectants. These stable transfectants were grown in selective media for five days and, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005907-g002">Fig. 2A</xref>, they presented undetectable levels of laforin. We then measured the amount of BIP/Grp78 under untreated and ER-stress conditions (induced by thapsigargin).

ER function is highly sensitive to stresses that perturb cellular energy levels, the red-ox state or Ca&#x0002b;&#x0002b; concentration. Such stresses reduce the folding capacity of the ER, which results in the accumulation and aggregation of unfolded/misfolded proteins. These unfolded proteins accumulate in the lumen of the ER triggering a signal responsible for the activation of the unfolded protein response (UPR). In addition, unfolded proteins are retrotranslocated to the cytosol, polyubiquitinated and degraded by the proteasome by the ER-associated degradation (ERAD) pathway. UPR and ERAD are highly coordinated processes: efficient ERAD requires intact UPR and UPR induction increases ERAD capacity. However, when UPR and ERAD are impaired, cell viability is markedly decreased (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005907-Travers1">&#x0005b;31&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005907-Paschen1">&#x0005b;32&#x0005d;</xref>). The last steps of the ERAD pathway involve ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation of unfolded substrates. In mammals, several integral ER-membrane proteins with E3-ubiquitin ligase activity, such as synoviolin/HsHrd1 and gp78, play a role in ERAD. In addition, several soluble cytosolic E3-ubiquitin ligases, such as parkin and CHIP (<underline>c</underline>arboxy terminus of the <underline>H</underline>sc70-<underline>i</underline>nteracting <underline>p</underline>rotein), also function in ERAD. All these E3-ubiquitin ligases ubiquitinate unfolded proteins marking them for proteasomal degradation. Defects in the function of any of these E3-ubiquitin ligases results in proteasomal dysfunction and in the accumulation of specific unfolded proteins, which triggers the UPR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005907-Meusser1">&#x0005b;33&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005907-Carvalho1">&#x0005b;34&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005907-Raasi1">&#x0005b;35&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005907-Kostova1">&#x0005b;36&#x0005d;</xref>). Similarly, in this work we present evidence indicating that in the absence of laforin, cells become more sensitive to agents triggering ER-stress and that this situation correlates with an impairment of proteasomal function. Conversely, the overexpression of laforin resulted in a partial prevention of proteasomal dysfunction upon ER-stress conditions. It is worth pointing out that proteasomal activity is not affected by depletion of laforin in the two cell lines used in this study, unless cells were subjected to ER-stress. This could indicate that only when cells are challenged with ER-stress conditions, the presence of laforin exerts its protective role, what suggests that the function of laforin, in combination with its partner malin (E3-ubiquitin ligase), would be to contribute to the elimination of unfolded proteins upon ER-stress conditions. In agreement with this hypothesis, it has been very recently described that the laforin-malin complex suppresses the cellular toxicity of misfolded proteins by promoting their degradation through the ubiquitin-proteasome system <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005907-Garyali1">&#x0005b;37&#x0005d;</xref>. Therefore, we suggest that in the absence of a functional laforin/malin complex more unfolded proteins would accumulate causing proteasomal dysfunction and aggravating the conditions of ER-stress. However, liver extracts of Epm2a-/- mice already presented lower proteasomal activity and higher induction of ER-stress markers than control mice. We suggest that during the life of the mice used in this study (9 months), they have been probably subjected to environmental situations that may have elicited conditions of ER-stress. The absence of laforin in these animals would have prevented them from recovering from these challenges, resulting in the establishment of permanent ER-stress conditions.</p><p>As indicated above, liver cells of Epm2a-/- mice present constitutive conditions of ER-stress. By analogy, human LD patients lacking laforin might also present permanent ER-stress conditions in the liver and other tissues, which may explain some cases of LD patients in whom liver failure has anticipated the neurological symptoms <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005907-GomezGarre1">&#x0005b;38&#x0005d;</xref>. However, brain extracts from Epm2a-/- mice do not present any detectable alteration in the regulation of the UPR and proteasomal function. Since we present evidence that in the brain of a human LD patient there is a clear induction of ER-stress markers, we suggest that differences between samples from mouse and human brains may account for this apparent contradiction. For example, mice and human may have a distinct progression of the disease <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005907-Ganesh2">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>, (i.e., the disease could not have been established in the brain of the mice, yet), or these tissues may have been differentially exposed to ER-stress conditions.</p><p>It is known that prolonged conditions of ER-stress triggers apoptosis, as a last resort of multicellular organisms to dispense of dysfunctional cells. Since we present evidence that samples from the brain of a human LD patient lacking laforin presented increased levels of ER-stress markers, this suggests that LD cells may also be more sensitive to apoptosis. In agreement with this hypothesis we found higher levels of apoptosis in a human neuroblastoma cell line (SH-SY5Y) depleted of laforin when subjected to ER-stress conditions. Moreover, it was recently described that 2-deoxyglucose treatment (causing ER-stress because of energy deprivation) also induces higher levels of apoptosis in cells defective of laforin than in normal cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005907-Wang2">&#x0005b;39&#x0005d;</xref>. This enhanced predisposition to apoptosis could be deleterious for the central nervous system and could lead to increased neurodegeneration.</p><p>As described above, the laforin/malin complex has a protective role in ER-stress. This protective role likely overlaps the role of other cytosolic E3-ubiquitin ligases involved in ERAD, such as parkin and CHIP. Defects in the function of parkin and CHIP results in an impairment of proteasomal function and overexpression of these proteins results in an amelioration of ER-stress conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005907-Imai1">&#x0005b;40&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005907-Tsai1">&#x0005b;41&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005907-Dikshit1">&#x0005b;42&#x0005d;</xref>). These are situations that closely resemble the laforin data reported here. Moreover, malin expression, similarly to parkin and CHIP, is increased under conditions of ER-stress. All these results suggest that the laforin/malin complex may be a novel component of the ERAD pathway. In this sense, the recent report that indicates that the laforin-malin complex is involved in the degradation of misfolded proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005907-Garyali1">&#x0005b;37&#x0005d;</xref>, would support this hypothesis. Since parkin and CHIP target a specific set of unfolded proteins for degradation, further studies would be needed to determine whether this is also the case for the laforin-malin complex and to characterize its physiological substrate(s). In any case, our results indicate that Lafora disease may be considered as a novel pathology related to ER-stress, which may offer novel opportunities for therapeutic developments.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Ethics statement</title><p>All animal care and use procedures used in this study were in accordance with the guidelines of the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee and approved by the Centro de Investigaciones Biol&#x000f3;gicas (CSIC) ethical review board.

Polyclonal antibodies against PDI, BIP/Grp78, phospho-EIF2alpha (Ser51) (Cell Signaling Technology, MA); GADD153/CHOP, SOD2 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA, U.S.A.); anti-S1 (19S regulatory particle) and anti-&#x003b2;2 (20S proteasome) (Biomol Research Labs; Exeter, UK) were used in the analyses. Mouse anti-laforin (monoclonal antibody against human laforin) was described previously <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005907-SolazFuster1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>. Protein loading was assessed by reprobing the membrane with an anti-tubulin antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc) and IRDye 800/700&#x02013;labelled secondary antibodies (1&#x02236;10000) (LI-COR Biosciences, Lincoln, NE). Visualization of protein expression was performed using the LI-COR Odyssey IR Imaging System.</p></sec><sec id="s4h"><title>Proteasome activity quantification</title><p>40 &#x000b5;g of soluble protein extracts were incubated with the Promega Proteasome-Glo Assay Reagent (Promega Bioscience, Madison, WI) for 10 minutes. The chymotrypsin-like proteasome activity was detected as the relative light unit (RLU) generated from the cleaved substrate in the reagent. Luminescence generated from each reaction condition was detected with a Wallac 1420 VICTOR luminometer.</p></sec><sec id="s4i"><title>Quantitative real-time PCR</title><p>Dissected brain biopsies were frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at &#x02013;80&#x000b0;C. Thawed tissue was homogenized in 2 ml TRIPURE reagent (Roche Diagnostics, Manheim, Germany) and total RNA was isolated according to the manufacturer's instructions. The integrity of total RNA was verified by electrophoresis through denaturing agarose gels. First strand cDNA was synthesized from 1 &#x000b5;g of total RNA using random hexamer and expand reverse transcriptase (Roche Diagnostics, Manheim, Germany). cDNA was used as a template for real-time PCR. PCR primers and fluorogenic TaqMan probe sets for each gene were designed using Universal probe library Service (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) to meet all TaqMan design guidelines. Probes were synthesized with a reporter dye 6-carboxyfluorescein (6-FAM) covalently linked at the 5&#x02032; end and a quencher dye 6-carboxy-tetramethyl-rhodamine (TAMRA) was linked to the 3&#x02032; end of the probe. See <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0005907-t001">Table 1</xref> for primer and probe sequences. Each PCR was carried out in a final volume of 25 &#x000b5;l of PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems), containing 200 nM of each primer and 40 nM of specific fluorescent probe. The cycle conditions were 20 s at 95&#x000b0;C for initial denaturing, followed by 35 cycles of 95&#x000b0;C for 3 s and 60&#x000b0;C for 30 s in the 7500 Fast Real-time PCR system (Applied biosystems). GAPDH was used as an internal standard. Each reaction was done in duplicate from at least three independent experiments. The relative amount of each mRNA was calculated using the second derivative comparative Ct method.</p><table-wrap id="pone-0005907-t001" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0005907.t001</object-id><label>Table 1</label><caption><title>Sequences of the primers and probes used in this work.</title></caption><graphic id="pone-0005907-t001-1" xlink:href="pone.0005907.t001"/><table frame="hsides" rules="groups" alternate-form-of="pone-0005907-t001-1"><colgroup span="1"><col align="left" span="1"/><col align="center" span="1"/><col align="center" span="1"/><col align="center" span="1"/></colgroup><thead><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">GENE</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Primer FWD</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Primer REV</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">TaqMan probe number</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">LAFORIN/EPM2A</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><named-content content-type="gene">cgtggacacgttctggtaca</named-content></td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><named-content content-type="gene">cggtcatgatgaggtccatt</named-content></td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">#52</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">GAPDH</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><named-content content-type="gene">ctctgctcctcctgttcgac</named-content></td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><named-content content-type="gene">acgaccaaatccgttgactc</named-content></td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">#60</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">CHOP</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><named-content content-type="gene">agctggaacctgaggagaga</named-content></td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><named-content content-type="gene">tggatcagtctggaaaagca</named-content></td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">#9</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">BIP/Grp78</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><named-content content-type="gene">agcctggcgacaagagtg</named-content></td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><named-content content-type="gene">tccttgggcagtattggatt</named-content></td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">#39</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">MALIN/EPM2B</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><named-content content-type="gene">gggctgagcctctactttcc</named-content></td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><named-content content-type="gene">cctggtgatcaaaggtcaca</named-content></td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">#16</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">PDI</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><named-content content-type="gene">gagctcctagcgggcttt</named-content></td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><named-content content-type="gene">caccaccacgaacagcac</named-content></td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">#16</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">SOD2</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><named-content content-type="gene">ctggacaaacctcagcccta</named-content></td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><named-content content-type="gene">tgatggcttccagcaactc</named-content></td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">#22</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">TTase1</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><named-content content-type="gene">ttggagctctgcagtaacca</named-content></td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><named-content content-type="gene">atccaccagaagtgctgtca</named-content></td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">#42</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap></sec><sec id="s4j"><title>Statistical analyses</title><p>Values are given as means&#x000b1;SEM of three independent experiments.
