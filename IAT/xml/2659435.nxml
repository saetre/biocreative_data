However, the evolutionary effects these restriction factors may have had on active retroviruses such as HIV-1 are less well understood. An HIV-1 variant that has been highly G-to-A mutated is unlikely to be transmitted due to accumulation of deleterious mutations. However, G-to-A mutated hA3G target sequences within which the mutations are the least deleterious are more likely to survive selection pressure. Thus, among hA3G targets in HIV-1, the ratio of nonsynonymous to synonymous changes will increase with virus generations, leaving a footprint of past activity. To study such footprints in HIV-1 evolution, we developed an <italic>in silico</italic> model based on calculated hA3G target probabilities derived from G-to-A mutation sequence contexts in the literature. We simulated G-to-A changes iteratively in independent sequential HIV-1 infections until a stop codon was introduced into any gene. In addition to our simulation results, we observed higher ratios of nonsynonymous to synonymous mutation at hA3G targets in extant HIV-1 genomes than in their putative ancestral genomes, compared to random controls, implying that moderate levels of A3G-mediated G-to-A mutation have been a factor in HIV-1 evolution. Results from <italic>in vitro</italic> passaging experiments of HIV-1 modified to be highly susceptible to hA3G mutagenesis verified our simulation accuracy. We also used our simulation to examine the possible role of A3G-induced mutations in the origin of drug resistance. We found that hA3G activity could have been responsible for only a small increase in mutations at known drug resistance sites and propose that concerns for increased resistance to other antiviral drugs should not prevent Vif from being considered a suitable target for development of new drugs.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><p>The search for new drugs to battle HIV-1 infections is a continuing struggle. APOBEC3G proteins have been shown to deaminate C-residues in HIV-1 minus strand DNA during its synthesis, resulting in G-to-A mutations in the RNA genome. The HIV-1 Vif protein has evolved to counteract APOBEC3G and thereby escape these frequently deleterious mutations, making Vif an attractive target for new drugs. However, a partial block of Vif could result in an increased although low-level HIV-1 G-to-A mutation rate. Here we investigated APOBEC3G mutation footprints in HIV-1 evolution and the potential risk for known drug resistance from sublethal G-to-A mutations. Using computer simulations, the accuracies of which were verified by infection experiments, we detected evolutionary APOBEC3G mutation footprints in the HIV-1 genome. We predict that the risk that APOBEC3G-induced G-to-A mutations will cause drug resistance is very low. We therefore propose that concerns for increased resistance to other antiviral drugs should not prevent Vif from being considered a suitable target for development of new drugs.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="9"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>The human and mouse APOBEC3 (A3) protein family members, hA3F and G and mA3, respectively, are well-studied host factors that restrict retrovirus replication. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000367-Esnault1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000367-Okeoma1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>.

Due to the specificity of A3 for single-stranded DNA, the frequency of induced mutations forms an increasing gradient in the genome from the primer binding site (PBS) to the polypurine tract (PPT) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000367-Yu1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>. In the case of HIV-1, whose genome contains a central PPT (cPPT), this effect results in dual gradients of G-to-A mutations from the PBS to the cPPT and the cPPT to the PPT <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000367-Suspene1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>. A role of A3-mediated defense in more distant retroviral evolution became apparent when we recently showed that mA3 likely contributed to inactivation of the infectivity of some types of endogenous MLV at the time of their integration into the host germline around a million years ago <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000367-Jern1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>. Taken together, these observation show that A3 was active as an antiviral factor in the distant evolutionary past, and that it is so today. However, the effects these APOBEC3 restriction factors have had on the evolution of actively replicating retroviruses such as HIV-1 are less clear.</p><p>The present study was undertaken to look for a signal of past A3-induced G-to-A changes in the sequence of modern day HIV-1 genomes. We hypothesized that the observed variation in G&#x02236;A ratios in different viruses and in their sensitivities to A3 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000367-Bishop1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000367-Chiu1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000367-Rulli1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref> is partly an effect of earlier A3-induced mutation and selection pressure on the virus genomes. Highly G-to-A mutated sequences are unlikely to be transmitted due to deleterious mutations. However, less efficient A3 activity, and thus fewer G-to-A mutations, could allow virus transmission, although with reduced efficiency. In this scenario, mutated A3 target sequences within which G-to-A mutations are the least deleterious are more likely to survive purifying selection pressure. This model predicts that as mutations accumulate with time, the ratio of nonsynonymous (NS) to synonymous (S) sites in probable A3 target sequences will increase with increasing virus generations more rapidly than at sites that are not A3 targets.</p><p>To study the potential of human APOBEC3G (hA3G) to affect HIV-1 evolution, we developed an <italic>in silico</italic> model that takes into account the observed mutation gradient and the probabilities of hA3G-mediated mutation at each site, derived from the sequence contexts of mutation sites (hereafter referred to as &#x0201c;contexts&#x0201d;) found in the literature <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000367-Yu1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000367-Suspene2">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>. After adjustment for location in the provirus in our simulations, we found that the frequency of G-to-A mutations introduced into HIV-1 could be partly explained by the virus's genetic profile as well as its distribution of probable target sequence contexts. Our simulation approach is supported by independent experimental results obtained by passaging HIV-1 under conditions that permit a high level of A3G-induced mutation. Further analyses showed that the ratio of NS to S-mutations at hA3G target sites has increased during HIV-1 evolution compared to random controls, implying an evolution where A3 sites have had higher mutation rates than non-A3 sites and therefore been subjected to greater influence from purifying selection. We also analyzed the potential of low-level hA3G-mediated G-to-A mutations to give rise to naturally occurring drug resistance mutations.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Human APOBEC3G mutation site contexts and probabilities</title><p>To calculate the likelihood of hA3G-mediated G-to-A mutation at different sites in HIV-1, we analyzed mutation site contexts surrounding 1324 observed G-to-A mutations attributed to hA3G from the literature <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000367-Yu1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000367-Suspene2">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>.

The simulation took into account both the dual hA3G mutation gradients (PBS-cPPT and cPPT-3&#x02032;PPT) and the target probability at each G-nucleotide calculated from the surrounding sequence context. A collection of 4000 HIV-1 sequences &#x02013; with nonsynonymous (NS, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000367-g002">Figure 2B</xref>) and synonymous (S, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000367-g002">Figure 2C</xref>) mutations accumulated until one lethal mutation was introduced &#x02013; was analyzed. Most of the simulated mutations displayed the expected dual gradient (black circles). Very infrequent mutations at the bottom of the graphs result from contexts that are at or very close to the probability cutoff. To ensure that this pattern did not reflect a nonuniform distribution of high probability hA3G targets, we also plotted the distribution of context probability scores for all G-residues. As can be seen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000367-g002">Figure 2B and C</xref>, gray squares), there is no indication of an uneven distribution of context probabilities across the HIV-1 provirus.</p><p>The distribution of the number of accumulated G-to-A changes per provirus resulting from our simulations is presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000367-g003">Figure 3</xref>.

As expected from our model, without selection pressure on the virus sequence, NS (red) to S (blue) mutation ratios were consistent (approximately 3&#x02236;1) independent of the number of mutations that were introduced into the viruses. Further, the numbers of random G-to-A mutations introduced before a stop codon appeared averaged about 1.6 S and 4.0 NS mutations, but some individual genomes accumulated as many as 40 substitutions when an 80&#x00025; hA3G target probability cutoff was used (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000367-g003">Figure 3</xref>). This value increased to 72 when all G-nucleotides were considered. Thus, when all sites were used in simulations, mutations were more widespread and high scoring hA3G target contexts accumulated slightly fewer mutations than in simulations where a probability cutoff was used (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1000367.s002">Figure S2</xref>). This pattern reflects the fact that higher scoring sites have a larger proportion of potential stop codons resulting from G-to-A mutations.

Briefly, we summarized the likelihood scores for each G-nucleotide context and tested for mutation type when changed into an A-nucleotide. We then calculated a ratio of NS to S sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000367-g004">Figure 4A</xref>). In the same way, we summarized likelihood scores for currently residing A-nucleotides, which we treated as putative ancestral G-nucleotides. Evolutionary theory predicts that the least costly mutations will have a higher chance to become fixed in the viral sequence and that deleterious mutations, i.e. mostly NS, will naturally be sorted out from the virus population due to purifying selection pressure. Conversely, among target sequences in which the target G-nucleotide has been changed to an A (referred to here as &#x0201c;putative&#x0201d; targets), the NS/S ratio should increase with time. Thus, the action of A3 on ancestral virus should have left a footprint on the viral genome in the form of an increased NS/S ratio at A3G targets relative to putative ancestral targets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000367-g004">Figure 4A</xref>). In search of such a footprint, we tested a modern HIV-1, subtype B sequence for the score and likelihood ratios at potential hA3G target sites and found an increased NS/S ratio (p&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;0.07, &#x003c7;<sup>2</sup> test) when compared to the cognate ratios at putative ancestral sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000367-g004">Figure 4B</xref>).

Increasing the target score cutoff led to slightly higher ratios for HIV-1, whereas a decreased cutoff had the opposite effect on both sequences (data not shown). To ensure that differences in NS/S ratios between currently observed G-nucleotides and putative ancestral hA3G mutation site contexts were not artifacts from random HIV-1 RT errors, we repeated our analyses by random sampling of codons from the virus sequences while not considering context scores or likelihoods. In these controls we found no significant differences in nonsynonymous to synonymous ratios between the current and putative ancestral G-nucleotides (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000367-g004">Figure 4B</xref>).

To minimize bias due to purifying selection, the impaired vif gene was chosen for analysis of G-to-A mutation frequency. Another practical reason was that we needed to verify with each sequence that the Vif inactivating mutation was not reverted to regain Vif function.

The increased rate of G-to-A mutations from hA3G does not seem overly problematic for the evolution of drug resistance in HIV-1.

However, since the predicted effect on resistance to standard antiviral drugs is likely to be small, we propose that concerns over increased resistance mutations should not impede development of HIV-1 Vif as a candidate drug target.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="ppat.1000367.s001"><label>Figure S1</label><caption><p>Position-specific scoring matrix (PSSM) derived from observed G-to-A mutation site contexts found in the literature.</p><p>(0.06 MB PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="ppat.1000367.s001.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="ppat.1000367.s002"><label>Figure S2</label><caption><p>HIV-1 (AF033819) <italic>gag</italic>, <italic>pol</italic> and <italic>env</italic> polyprotein ORFs and amino acid translations.
