Motor proteins associated to the dynactin subunit p150<sup>Glued</sup> bind to LEs via the Rab7 effector Rab7-interacting lysosomal protein (RILP) in association with the oxysterol-binding protein ORP1L. We found that cholesterol levels in LEs are sensed by ORP1L and are lower in peripheral vesicles. Under low cholesterol conditions, ORP1L conformation induces the formation of endoplasmic reticulum (ER)&#x02013;LE membrane contact sites. At these sites, the ER protein VAP (VAMP [vesicle-associated membrane protein]-associated ER protein) can interact in trans with the Rab7&#x02013;RILP complex to remove p150<sup>Glued</sup> and associated motors. LEs then move to the microtubule plus end. Under high cholesterol conditions, as in Niemann-Pick type C disease, this process is prevented, and LEs accumulate at the microtubule minus end as the result of dynein motor activity. These data explain how the ER and cholesterol control the association of LEs with motor proteins and their positioning in cells.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p>Late endosomes (LEs), lysosomes, and lysosome-related organelles are characteristically positioned by motor protein interactions with cytoskeletal elements.

The small GTPase Rab7 associates with the LE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Zerial and McBride, 2001</xref>), and its effector Rab7-interacting lysosomal protein (RILP) binds the p150<sup>Glued</sup> subunit of the dynactin protein complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Jordens et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Johansson et al., 2007</xref>). The p150<sup>Glued</sup> protein can bind to dynein heavy chain via the dynein intermediate chain (DIC), but it can also bind to the oppositely directed kinesin II (KIF3A) motor via KAP3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Wubbolts et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Deacon et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Brown et al., 2005</xref>).

When p150<sup>Glued</sup> binding to LEs is inhibited, the kinesin I motor remains active, resulting in net plus end transport (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Wubbolts et al., 1999</xref>). Although Rab7 and RILP are sufficient for the recruitment of p150<sup>Glued</sup>-associated motor proteins, the actual translocation of LEs toward the microtubule-organizing center (MTOC) further requires &#x003b2;III spectrin and the oxysterol-binding protein (OSBP)&#x02013;related protein 1L (ORP1L; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Johansson et al., 2007</xref>).

Cholesterol-laden LEs in Niemann-Pick type C patients cluster around the MTOC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Mukherjee and Maxfield, 2004</xref>). This phenotype is shared with other lysosomal storage diseases like Tangier, Fabry, and Gaucher (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Neufeld et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Maxfield and Tabas, 2005</xref>). Increasing endosomal cholesterol levels with the chemical compound U-18666A causes a similar phenotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Roff et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Koh and Cheung, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Sobo et al., 2007</xref>).

Conversely, cholesterol depletion results in LE positioning at the plus end of microtubules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Sugii et al., 2006</xref>). This suggests that motor protein activities controlling LE positioning involve Rab GTPases and cholesterol, but the mechanism is unclear.</p><p>We show that cholesterol in LEs is sensed by ORP1L, which transmits this information to the Rab7&#x02013;RILP&#x02013;p150<sup>Glued</sup> complex through the formation of ER&#x02013;LE membrane contact sites (MCSs). At these sites, the ER protein VAP enters the Rab7&#x02013;RILP complex to control p150<sup>Glued</sup> binding and positioning of LEs. The characteristic clustering of LEs at the microtubule minus end in Niemann-Pick type C and other lysosomal storage diseases is a result of this process.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec><title>Chemical and genetic cholesterol manipulations in LEs and their positioning</title><p>Cholesterol is an essential component of cellular membranes and contributes to a host of different processes.

However, no effect of cholesterol manipulation on intramolecular donor FRET efficiency E<sub>D</sub> was detected, suggesting that cholesterol-induced conformational changes in mRFP-ORP1L-GFP were mediated by the cholesterol-sensing ORD (Fig. S4 A).</p><p>FRET efficiencies can also be calculated from differences in donor fluorophore lifetime (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Bastiaens and Squire, 1999</xref>). The aforementioned FRET experiments were repeated with FRET determination by fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (FLIM). The lifetime of GFP is typically 2.7 ns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Pepperkok et al., 1999</xref>) but decreases in the case of FRET, when energy is transferred to the acceptor fluorophore mRFP. Cells expressing mRFP-ORP1L-GFP were imaged along with control cells expressing only GFP to determine GFP lifetime under non-FRET conditions. Again, FRET efficiency E<sub>D</sub> was decreased by cholesterol depletion and increased in response to enhanced cholesterol levels (Fig. S4 C). Cells grown under the various control conditions were also imaged by FLIM and showed no response to cholesterol manipulation, which is fully consistent with the results of FRET experiments measured by sensitized emission (Fig. S4, D and E).

Cholesterol can distribute over the LE-limiting membrane and the internal vesicles by flip-flop mechanisms and/or specific transporters. ORP1L senses cholesterol in the cytosolic leaflet of the LE-limiting membrane before translating this into LE repositioning. To test whether cholesterol sensing by ORP1L is required for LE clustering in Niemann-Pick type C, NPC1-silenced MelJuSo cells (Fig. S1 B) were transfected with different mRFP-ORP1L constructs before analysis by confocal laser-scanning microscopy (CLSM; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 C</xref>).

To separate cholesterol accumulation from LE clustering, mRFP-&#x00394;ORD was expressed in NPC1-silenced cells.

The CD63-positive LEs scattered by &#x00394;ORD expression still accumulated cholesterol when NPC1 was silenced. This suggests that the characteristic clustering of LEs near the MTOC, which is typical in Niemann-Pick type C, is a consequence of cholesterol accumulation, as sensed by ORP1L (and is abrogated by &#x00394;ORD). ORP1L transmits this information to the Rab7&#x02013;RILP&#x02013;p150<sup>Glued</sup>&#x02013;dynein motor complex for microtubule minus end&#x02013;driven transport and clustering of LEs.</p></sec><sec><title>ORP1L conformation differs between peripheral and perinuclear LEs</title><p>If cholesterol levels in LEs determine its intracellular positioning, these levels should be different between peripheral and perinuclear LEs.

Whereas cholesterol accumulation in LEs (as the result of U-18666A) diminished these contacts, cholesterol depletion markedly induced formation of ER&#x02013;LE contact sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Fig. 8 D</xref>). These data suggest that the conformational state of ORP1L, as controlled by cholesterol levels, determines whether ER contacts the LE. This is required for the ER protein VAP to contact (and manipulate) the Rab7&#x02013;RILP&#x02013;p150<sup>Glued</sup> complex on LEs.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Cholesterol is a hydrophobic molecule essential for fluidity and microdomain formation in biomembranes. The transfer of cholesterol to other organelles requires specific cholesterol-binding chaperones. A series of proteins with cholesterol-binding domains like the steroidogenic acute regulatory protein&#x02013;related lipid transfer domain and ORD have been identified in various compartments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Holthuis and Levine, 2005</xref>). Two such proteins, MLN64 and ORP1L, are located at LE membranes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Ikonen, 2008</xref>). The transfer of cholesterol over LE membranes requires transporters like ABCA1 and possibly NPC1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Ikonen, 2008</xref>), but flip-flop of cholesterol may be another possibility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hamilton, 2003</xref>). If so, high concentrations of cholesterol in the intraluminal vesicles of LEs should be reflected by high concentrations of cholesterol in their cytosolic leaflet.</p><p>High cholesterol content in LEs is typical for a series of lysosomal storage diseases with characteristic LE clustering at the minus end of microtubules. It has been suggested that cholesterol influences LE transport involving Rab GTPases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Holtta-Vuori et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lebrand et al., 2002</xref>). Minus end transport of LEs involves the dynein&#x02013;dynactin motor complex and its receptor complex, Rab7&#x02013;RILP&#x02013;ORP1L. Because ORP1L binds both Rab7&#x02013;RILP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Johansson et al., 2007</xref>) and cholesterol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Suchanek et al., 2007</xref>), we tested whether ORP1L could transfer information on LE cholesterol content to Rab7&#x02013;RILP and then to p150<sup>Glued</sup>-associated motor proteins like the dynein motor. Using intramolecular FRET, we showed that the C-terminal ORD of ORP1L senses LE cholesterol. ORD can be in a membrane-bound state (when cholesterol levels are high) or in a cytosolic, membrane-free conformation (when cholesterol levels are low). Overexpression of ORP1L or one of its mutants did not change cholesterol levels in LEs (unpublished data), which suggests that ORP1L is merely a cholesterol sensor rather than an active contributor to extracting and redistributing cholesterol.</p><p>When ORD is in its cytosolic conformation or absent (as in the truncation mutant &#x00394;ORD), the FFAT motif of ORP1L prevents access of p150<sup>Glued</sup> to Rab7&#x02013;RILP. This does not occur when ORD is in the membrane-associated state (as in the chimeric &#x00394;ORDPHDPHD). The ER protein VAP is directly involved in the removal of the dynein&#x02013;dynactin subunit p150<sup>Glued</sup> from the Rab7&#x02013;RILP complex because silencing VAP restores p150<sup>Glued</sup> binding to &#x00394;ORD&#x02013;Rab7&#x02013;RILP-containing vesicles. This was confirmed when purified VAP-A removed p150<sup>Glued</sup> from the RILP&#x02013;Rab7&#x02013;ORP1L complex (which also indicated that the minimal set of proteins involved in this process had been identified).</p><p>The ER protein VAP would not be an obvious candidate for regulating LE positioning. Light microscopy suggested that VAP localized to LEs when &#x00394;ORD was expressed (indicating ER&#x02013;LE fusion). However, visualization of this process at a higher resolution by EM revealed that the ER (containing VAP) aligned to rather than fused with LEs, creating LE&#x02013;ER contact sites. The formation of these contact sites is dependent on the conformation of ORP1L. &#x00394;ORD or low cholesterol levels in the LEs increased the number and area of contact sites, whereas &#x00394;ORDPHDPHD or high cholesterol decreased these interactions. ER&#x02013;LE contact sites were proposed as sites where lipids like cholesterol could be transferred from LEs to the ER for further distribution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Underwood et al., 1998</xref>). However, the ER&#x02013;LE contact sites are predominantly observed under conditions of low cholesterol and, to a lesser extent, under control conditions. It is possible that they are transiently formed when ORP1L changes conformation to expose the FFAT domain and released when ORP1L adopts the membrane-associated cholesterol-high state. Under low cholesterol conditions when the ER&#x02013;LE MCSs form, the ER protein VAP can interact in trans with the Rab7&#x02013;RILP receptor on LEs to release p150<sup>Glued</sup>. This then results in microtubule plus end transport and scattering of LEs. The ER network is directly linked to the microtubule network that is also used by p150<sup>Glued</sup>-associated motors on LEs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Vedrenne and Hauri, 2006</xref>). The ER&#x02013;LE contact sites are relatively stable between a dynamic ER and with moving vesicles, as can be appreciated in Videos 5&#x02013;7. Whether other proteins contribute to stabilizing interactions between these organelles is unclear.</p><p>When NPC1 is depleted or mutated, as in Niemann-Pick type C disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Carstea et al., 1997</xref>), or when chemical drugs raise cholesterol levels of LEs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Roff et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Sobo et al., 2007</xref>), the ORD of ORP1L is membrane associated, preventing the formation of ER&#x02013;LE MCSs. This allows enduring binding of p150<sup>Glued</sup>&#x02013;DIC&#x02013;dynein motor complexes to Rab7&#x02013;RILP and transport to the microtubule minus end.</p><p>Why cholesterol is selected to dictate LE positioning is unclear. Cholesterol is present in the intraluminal vesicles as well as the cytosolic leaflet of LEs, allowing cytosolic exposure of intraluminal conditions. If cholesterol levels increase with maturation of the LE, the resulting ORP1L-controlled Rab7&#x02013;RILP&#x02013;p150<sup>Glued</sup>&#x02013;DIC&#x02013;dynein motor interactions would position the most matured compartments at the extreme minus end of microtubules with &#x0201c;shells&#x0201d; of less matured vesicles surrounding these at more plus end locations. Newly arriving LEs would then first encounter the youngest LE, resulting in spatial maturation before encountering lysosomes. Thus, cholesterol at the LE cytosolic leaflet would control the positioning of these organelles. We have tested this by analyzing the conformation of the cholesterol sensor ORP1L by FRET on LEs located in the perinuclear area versus the periphery. Donor FRET efficiency was lower in the cell periphery, indicating a lower cholesterol concentration.</p><p>We have visualized how the Rab7&#x02013;RILP complex controls intracellular positioning of LEs. This process is controlled by cholesterol levels sensed by ORP1L to induce ER&#x02013;LE contact sites via interaction with the ER protein VAP. In these contact sites, VAP interacts in trans with the Rab7&#x02013;RILP receptor, promoting dissociation of p150<sup>Glued</sup> and its associated motor proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Fig. 9</xref>). This model explains how cholesterol depletion causes LE scattering and high cholesterol levels induce LE clustering, as observed in Niemann-Pick type C disease. We reveal an unexpected contribution of ER proteins in the control of LE intracellular positioning by motor proteins in a process controlled by cholesterol.</p><fig id="fig9" position="float"><label>Figure 9.</label><caption><p><bold>Model showing control of Rab7&#x02013;RILP&#x02013;p150<sup>Glued</sup> motor protein complexes by the ER protein VAP, cholesterol, and the sensor ORP1L.</bold> Rab7 recruits the homodimeric effector protein RILP to LEs. RILP binds the p150<sup>Glued</sup> subunit of the dynein&#x02013;dynactin motor. ORP1L also binds to the Rab7&#x02013;RILP complex. ORP1L has a C-terminal cholesterol-sensing ORD that exists in different conformational states determined by cholesterol in LEs. At low cholesterol levels, ORD adopts a conformation in which the adjacent FFAT motif is exposed and which can be detected by the ER protein VAP in ER&#x02013;LE MCSs. VAP binds in trans to the Rab7&#x02013;RILP&#x02013;p150<sup>Glued</sup> complex and removes p150<sup>Glued</sup>, thus preventing minus end&#x02013;directed transport. High cholesterol conditions initiate a different ORP1L conformation, preventing formation of ER&#x02013;LE MCSs, and VAP fails to interact with the Rab7&#x02013;RILP&#x02013;p150<sup>Glued</sup> complex. Thus, cholesterol levels in LEs determine the conformation of ORP1L and thereby VAP recruitment in ER&#x02013;LE contact sites. The ER protein VAP then controls p150<sup>Glued</sup> binding to Rab7&#x02013;RILP, resulting in the scattering of cholesterol-poor LEs and clustering of cholesterol-laden LEs, as in Niemann-Pick type C disease.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="JCB_200811005_RGB_Fig9"/></fig></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Reagents</title><p>Rabbit anti-GFP and rabbit anti-mRFP antibodies were generated using purified His-mRFP or His-GFP recombinant proteins as immunogen, respectively.

Filipin signal was recorded using a 390&#x02013;415-nm band-pass (BP) excitation filter and with a 450&#x02013;470-nm BP emission filter. FITC signal was recorded with a 480&#x02013;510-nm BP excitation filter and with a 515&#x02013;550-nm BP emission filter. mRFP signal was recorded with a 555&#x02013;590-nm BP excitation filter and with a 605&#x02013;655-nm BP emission filter (Carl Zeiss, Inc.). For data acquisition, the manufacturers' software was used.</p></sec><sec><title>Protein purification</title><p>His-Rab7, His-RILP, and GST-ORP1L were produced as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Johansson et al., 2007</xref>). Cells were lysed in 0.5% Triton X-100, 20 mM Hepes, pH 7.5, 200 mM NaCl, 8 mM &#x003b2;-mercaptoethanol, and complete EDTA-free protease inhibitors cocktail (Roche). The lysate was cleared by centrifugation, and the supernatant was incubated with pre-equilibrated Talon Co<sup>2+</sup> resin (Clontech Laboratories, Inc.) for 30 min. The resin was then washed extensively with 20 mM Hepes, pH 7.5, 200 mM NaCl, and 8 mM &#x003b2;-mercaptoethanol. Proteins were stored in 8.7% glycerol at &#x02212;80&#x000b0;C until use in protein reconstitution experiments. GST&#x02013;VAP-A construct in pGEX was a gift from N. Ridgway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Wyles et al., 2002</xref>). GST was removed by cleavage with thrombin by incubation at 30&#x000b0;C for 2 h before inactivation and precipitation by 0.1 mM PMSF. The GST moiety was removed using a glutathione-Sepharose column (GE Healthcare), and the purity of GST-free VAP-A was confirmed by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie staining.</p></sec><sec><title>In vitro VAP-A induced p150<sup>Glued</sup> removal from the Rab7&#x02013;RILP protein complex</title><p>The reconstitution assay was performed in a detergent/salt buffer (20 mM Hepes, pH 7.5, 200 mM NaCl, 4 mM &#x003b2;-mercaptoethanol, 5 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 0.05% [vol/vol] Triton X-100, and 50 &#x000b5;M GTP). 15 &#x000b5;g His-Rab7(Q67L) was coupled to 3 &#x000b5;l of Talon Co<sup>2+</sup> beads and preloaded with GTP. Beads were washed to remove unbound His-Rab7(Q67L), and recombinant purified proteins were added in equimolar concentrations. 3 &#x000b5;g His-RILP, 8.7 &#x000b5;g GST-ORP1L, 2.2 &#x000b5;g VAP-A, and 4.5 &#x000b5;g maltose-binding protein (MBP)&#x02013;p150<sup>Glued</sup>(C25) were added to the beads as indicated and incubated in a total volume of 0.4 ml for 2 h at 4&#x000b0;C. Beads were washed extensively, and 4.5 &#x000b5;g MBP-p150<sup>Glued</sup>(C25) or 2.2 &#x000b5;g VAP-A was added to the beads as indicated. Proteins were subsequently incubated in a total volume of 0.4 ml of detergent/salt buffer for 30 min at 22&#x000b0;C. Beads were washed extensively, and proteins bound to His-Rab7(Q67L) were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. Proteins were detected with the following antibodies: &#x003b1;-His (GE Healthcare), &#x003b1;-MBP (New England Biolabs, Inc.), and &#x003b1;-GST (gift from W. Moolenaar, The Netherlands Cancer Institute, Amsterdam, Netherlands). Direct binding of p150<sup>Glued</sup> to VAP-A was assayed as follows. 30 &#x000b5;g GST&#x02013;VAP-A or 15 &#x000b5;g GST was coupled to 15 &#x000b5;l of glutathione&#x02013;Sepharose 4B beads (GE Healthcare). Beads were washed to remove unbound proteins, and 4.5 &#x000b5;g MBP-p150<sup>Glued</sup>(C25) was added to the beads in a total volume of 0.4 ml for 30 min at 22&#x000b0;C. Beads were washed extensively, and proteins bound to the glutathione&#x02013;Sepharose 4B beads were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting.</p></sec><sec><title>Online supplemental material</title><p>Fig. S1 shows cholesterol, NPC1, the ORD, and vesicle distribution.
