Unlike mammals, the function of TGF-beta in the reproduction of lower vertebrates, such as fish, is not clear. Recently, we showed that TGF-beta1 inhibits gonadotropin- and 17alpha, 20beta-dihydroxyprogesterone (DHP)-induced maturation in zebrafish. The aim of the present study was to investigate the mechanisms underlying this action.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Method</title><p>To determine if the effect of TGF-beta1 on oocyte maturation involves transcription and/or translation, ovarian follicles were pre-treated with actinomycin D, a blocker of transcription, and cyclohexamide, an inhibitor of translation, and incubated with hCG or DHP, either alone or in combination with TGF-beta1 and oocyte maturation scored. To determine the effect of TGF-beta1 on mRNA levels of several key effectors of oocyte maturation, three sets of experiments were performed. First, follicles were treated with control medium or TGF-beta1 for 2, 6, 12, and 24 h. Second, follicles were treated with different concentrations of TGF-beta1 (0 to 10 ng/ml) for 18 h. Third, follicles were incubated with hCG in the absence or presence of TGF-beta1 for 18 h. At the end of each experiment, total RNA was extracted and reverse transcribed. PCR using primers specific for 20beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (20beta-HSD) which is involved in DHP production, follicle stimulating hormone receptor (FSHR), luteinizing hormone receptor (LHR), the two forms of membrane progestin receptor: mPR-alpha and mPR-beta, as well as GAPDH (control), were performed.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Treatment with actinomycin D, a blocker of transcription, reduced the inhibitory effect of TGF-beta1 on DHP-induced oocyte maturation, indicating that the inhibitory action of TGF-beta1 is in part due to regulation of gene transcription. Treatment with TGF-beta1 caused a dose and time-dependent decrease in mRNA levels of 20beta-HSD, LHR and mPR-beta in follicles. On the other hand, TGF-beta1 had no effect on mPR-alpha mRNA expression and increased FSHR mRNA levels. Furthermore, hCG upregulated 20beta-HSD, LHR and mPR-beta mRNA levels, but this stimulatory effect was blocked by TGF-beta1.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>These findings suggest that TGF-beta1 acts at multiple sites, including LHR, 20beta-HSD and mPR-beta, to inhibit zebrafish oocyte maturation.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>Transforming Growth Factor-&#x003b2;1 (TGF-&#x003b2;1) is the prototypical member of the TGF-&#x003b2; family [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Members of this family are implicated in diverse physiological processes, including reproduction. Three isoforms of TGF-&#x003b2; (TGF-&#x003b2;1, -&#x003b2;2, and -&#x003b2;3) are expressed in the mammalian ovary [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. They have been shown to regulate follicle development, steroidogenesis, oocyte maturation, ovulation and follicular atresia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. There is molecular evidence for the presence of TGF-&#x003b2;1&#x02013;3 in fish [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. However, the role of TGF-&#x003b2; in fish reproduction is not well understood. Studies in zebrafish have suggested that TGF-&#x003b2; inhibits oocyte maturation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. In the goldfish, TGF-&#x003b2; has been reported to inhibit ovarian steroid production [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>].</p><p>Ovarian development in fish is broadly divided into two major phases: growth and maturation. During oocyte growth, follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) stimulates production of estradiol-17&#x003b2; from the ovary. Estradiol-17&#x003b2; stimulates the production of vitellogenin by the liver. Vitellogenin is taken up by the developing oocyte and cleaved to yolk protein, which serves as a nutritional reserve for the developing embryo [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. Oocyte maturation in teleosts is triggered by the release of leutinizing hormone (LH) from the pituitary. LH stimulates a number of signaling cascades culminating in the production of 17&#x003b1;-hydroxyprogesterone (17&#x003b1;-HP). In the granulosa cells, under the action of 20&#x003b2;-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (20&#x003b2;-HSD), 17&#x003b1;-HP is converted to 17&#x003b1;, 20&#x003b2;-dihydroxyprogesterone (DHP), the maturation inducing hormone (MIH) in cyprinids, such as zebrafish and goldfish. MIH activates the cytoplasmic maturation promoting factor (MPF), which is made up of two subunits: cyclin B (a regulatory subunit) and cdc2 (a catalytic subunit). MIH stimulates the <italic>de novo </italic>synthesis of cyclin B. Cyclin B protein binds to cdc2 to form MPF. The newly formed MPF is activated by phosphorylation of cdc2 on threonine 161. The active MPF, then, stimulates all the changes associated with oocyte maturation, such as germinal vesicle break down (GVBD), spindle formation, chromosome condensation and allows the transition from G2/M phase of meiosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>].</p><p>Two isoforms of the MIH receptor, designated as membrane progestin receptor-&#x003b1; (mPR-&#x003b1;) and mPR-&#x003b2;, have recently been cloned in zebrafish [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. Microinjection of zebrafish oocytes with antisense oligonucleotides to either mPR-&#x003b1; or mPR-&#x003b2; or both receptors has been shown to block MIH-induced maturation, indicating that both play a role in zebrafish oocyte maturation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. Originally discovered in sea-trout oocytes, several isoforms of mPR have also been discovered in humans and other vertebrates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>].</p><p>The zebrafish model has been used extensively for studies on early embryonic development. This model is also very useful for the investigation of ovarian follicle development and maturation because the zebrafish ovary contains ovarian follicles at different stages of development. We and others have been using zebrafish to examine the role of TGF-&#x003b2; superfamily in oocyte maturation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. Our previous work has shown that TGF-&#x003b2;1 inhibits human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) and MIH-induced maturation in zebrafish [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. We have also observed a decrease in TGF-&#x003b2;1 mRNA expression in maturing follicles. These findings suggest that TGF-&#x003b2;1 may play a role in preventing premature oocyte maturation in zebrafish. The present study is an attempt to elucidate the mechanisms underlying the inhibitory effect of TGF-&#x003b2;1 by identifying the potential target genes of TGF-&#x003b2;1. We report here our recent findings on the effect of TGF-&#x003b2;1 on the important effectors of oocyte maturation in zebrafish, including: 20&#x003b2;-HSD, LHR, mPR-&#x003b1;, and mPR-&#x003b2;.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Animals</title><p>Adult zebrafish, <italic>Danio rerio</italic>, were purchased from a local pet supplier (Fish &#x00026; Bird Emporium, Brampton, ON) and maintained in 10 L tanks of an AHAB System(Aquatic Habitats, FL) at 26&#x000b0;C, under a 14-h light, 10-h dark photoperiod.

The primers for 20&#x003b2;-HSD, FSHR, LHR, mPR-&#x003b1; and mPR-&#x003b2; were designed according to the sequences from GenBank (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>). The semi-quantitative RT-PCR was validated by peforming PCR reactions for different cycles to determine the cycle number that generated half maximal PCR product for each gene studied.

The PCR products were electrophoresed on 1.5% agarose gels and visualized by ethidium bromide staining. The spot density of each PCR product was determined using the Fluorchem v2.0 Software (Alpha Innotech Corporation, San Leandro, CA). GAPDH was used as an internal control to normalize the variation in mRNA concentration in the RT reaction.

Recent studies have suggested that TGF-&#x003b2; inhibits steroid production in the goldfish ovary [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>] and oocyte maturation in zebrafish [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. In the present study, we further examined the cellular mechanisms underlying the inhibitory effect of TGF-&#x003b2; in oocyte maturation. We have shown that TGF-&#x003b2;1 inhibits mRNA expression of 20&#x003b2;-HSD, the key enzyme involved in MIH production, as well as LHR and mPR-&#x003b2;. These novel findings suggest that TGF-&#x003b2;1 inhibits multiple targets in the oocyte maturation pathway, both upstream and downstream of MIH.</p><p>One of the potential targets of TGF-&#x003b2;1 identified in this study is 20&#x003b2;-HSD. We found that TGF-&#x003b2;1 inhibited basal and hCG-induced 20&#x003b2;-HSD mRNA levels. TGF-&#x003b2;1 alone induced a dose- and time-dependent inhibitory effect on 20&#x003b2;-HSD mRNA expression. Treatment with hCG increased 20&#x003b2;-HSD mRNA levels; however, in the presence of TGF-&#x003b2;1, the effect of hCG was blocked. 20&#x003b2;-HSD activity in the ovary and its stimulation by gonadotropins and cAMP-enhancing drugs has been demonstrated in many species [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. Our finding that hCG stimulates 20&#x003b2;-HSD is consistent with studies in mammals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>] and a recent study in Nile Tilapia, which reported an increase in the mRNA expression of 20&#x003b2;-HSD in response to hCG treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. The observation of decreased 20&#x003b2;-HSD mRNA levels after TGF-&#x003b2;1 treatment suggests that TGF-&#x003b2;1 may inhibit 20&#x003b2;-HSD activity, leading to a decrease in MIH production. This notion is supported by a recent report that TGF-&#x003b2;1 inhibits the conversion of 17&#x003b1;-HP to DHP in the goldfish [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. It is possible that one of the actions of TGF-&#x003b2;1 is to decreases MIH production, and thus inhibits oocyte maturation.</p><p>In this study, we observed that hCG increased LHR but had no effect on FSHR mRNA levels. Several studies conducted in fish on the effect of gonadotropin on LHR and FSHR expression have yielded inconsistent results. In African and Channel catfish, it has been reported that hCG treatment caused an activation of the LHR and cAMP mediated pathways, as well as a slight increase in FSHR mRNA levels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. However, a two-fold increase in FSHR expression, but no change in LHR expression in pre-maturational follicles of rainbow trout in response to treatment with partially purified gonadotropins has also been reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. The reason for such discrepancy is unclear, however, it could be due to species specificity or variation in treatment conditions.</p><p>An interesting finding from this study is that TGF-&#x003b2;1 differentially regulates FSHR and LHR mRNA levels. We observed that basal FSH receptor mRNA levels were increased, while basal- and hCG-induced LH receptor mRNA levels were decreased, upon incubation of follicles with TGF-&#x003b2;1. TGF-&#x003b2;1 has been reported to regulate LH and FSH binding sites in mammals, however, whether TGF-&#x003b2;1 has a stimulatory or inhibitory effect appears to be species-dependant. TGF-&#x003b2;1 decreased basal and FSH-induced LH binding sites in porcine granulosa cells but enhanced FSH-induced LH binding in rat granulosa cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. FSH induced FSH binding in porcine granulosa cells and this effect was attenuated by TGF-&#x003b2;1. On the other hand, FSH decreased its own binding levels in rat granulosa cells and this effect was also blocked by TGF-&#x003b2;1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. Our finding that TGF-&#x003b2;1 increased FSHR mRNA levels is consistent with previous studies in rat granulosa cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. However, our observation that TGF-&#x003b2;1 decreased LHR mRNA levels is opposite to studies in rat [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>] and chicken [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>] granulosa cells. In these studies, it was reported that TGF-&#x003b2;1 induced LHR mRNA expression. Whether this is due to species variation as in the case of rat and pig or to the difference in follicle development between fish and higher vertebrates awaits more studies in fish species. The finding that TGF-&#x003b2;1 inhibited LHR mRNA expression suggests that the inhibitory effect of TGF-&#x003b2;1 on hCG-induced oocyte maturation may be due, in part, to the downregulation of LH receptor by TGF-&#x003b2;1. Since FSH is known to be a major regulator of oocyte growth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>], by stimulating FSH receptor expression TGF-&#x003b2;1 may play a role in promoting follicle growth. These findings, together with our previous observation that TGF-&#x003b2;1 mRNA levels are higher in growing follicles than in maturing follicles, suggest that TGF-&#x003b2;1 may stimulate follicle development and inhibit precocious oocyte maturation in the zebrafish ovary. This possibility will be investigated further in the future.</p><p>A recent study has shown that microinjection of zebrafish oocytes with antisense oligonucleotides to either mPR-&#x003b1; or mPR-&#x003b2; or both causes similar marked decreases in the rates of oocyte maturation, suggesting that both subtypes are obligatory for oocyte maturation in zebrafish [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. In this study, we observed a strong induction of mPR-&#x003b2; mRNA levels by hCG and an inhibitory effect of TGF-&#x003b2;1 on both basal and hCG-induced mPR-&#x003b2; mRNA expression. These findings support the role of mPR-&#x003b2; in oocyte maturation and suggest that one of the mechanisms by which TGF-&#x003b2;1 inhibits hCG- and MIH-induced oocyte maturation is by the downregulation of MIH receptors, specifically mPR-&#x003b2;. However, we found that neither hCG nor TGF-&#x003b2;1 had an effect of mPR-&#x003b1; mRNA levels, suggesting that the two membrane progestin receptors are under differential regulation. It has been reported that hCG caused an increase in the mPR protein expression in sea-trout oocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. The sea-trout mPR has a higher homology to mPR-&#x003b1; (80%) than to mPR-&#x003b2; (46%). It remains to be determined if hCG regulates mPR-&#x003b1; and mPR-&#x003b2; protein levels in the zebrafish. Recently, Kazeta et al. (2005) reported that hCG did not change mRNA levels of mPR-&#x003b1; and mPR-&#x003b2; at 5 and 10 h after hCG treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]. The difference between this and our studies may be due to the duration of hCG treatment as 18 h was used in our study.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Based on our findings that TGF-&#x003b2;1 downregulates basal and hCG-induced LHR, 20&#x003b2;-HSD, and mPR-&#x003b2; mRNA levels, we propose that TGF-&#x003b2;1 acts upon multiple targets to exert its inhibitory effect on oocyte maturation. TGF-&#x003b2;1 may downregulate LHR, leading to decreased signal transduction and decreased production of 17&#x003b1;-hydroxyprogesterone. TGF-&#x003b2;1 may inhibit basal and gonadotropin-induced MIH production by inhibiting 20&#x003b2;-HSD. Finally, TGF-&#x003b2;1 may inhibit the expression of the MIH receptor, such as mPR-&#x003b2;, on the oocyte surfaces, leading to a reduction of MPF activation and subsequent oocyte maturation. This model can be tested in the future by examining the protein levels on these molecules once antibodies become available. Similarly, the physiological significance of TGF-&#x003b2; on oocyte maturation will be confirmed using loss-of-function approaches.</p></sec></body><back><ack><sec><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>This study was supported by a grant from Natural Science and Engineering Research Council (NSERC) of Canada and an Ontario Premier's Research Excellence Award to CP.
