These small nucleoli tend to coalesce into one or a few large nucleoli during interphase by unknown mechanisms. Here, we demonstrate that the N- and C-terminal domains of a nucleolar protein, hNopp140, bound respectively to &#x003b1;-satellite arrays and rDNA clusters of acrocentric chromosomes for nucleolar formation. The central acidic-and-basic repeated domain of hNopp140, possessing a weak self-self interacting ability, was indispensable for hNopp140 to build up a nucleolar round-shaped structure. The N- or the C-terminally truncated hNopp140 caused nucleolar segregation and was able to alter locations of the rDNA transcription, as mediated by detaching the rDNA repeats from the acrocentric &#x003b1;-satellite arrays. Interestingly, an hNopp140 mutant, made by joining the N- and C-terminal domains but excluding the entire central repeated region, induced nucleolar disruption and global chromatin condensation. Furthermore, RNAi knockdown of hNopp140 resulted in dispersion of the rDNA and acrocentric &#x003b1;-satellite sequences away from nucleolus that was accompanied by rDNA transcriptional silence. Our findings indicate that hNopp140, a scaffold protein, is involved in the nucleolar assembly, fusion, and maintenance.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Acrocentric chromosomes</kwd><kwd>Alpha-satellite DNA</kwd><kwd>Centromere</kwd><kwd>Nopp140</kwd><kwd>Nucleolus</kwd><kwd>rDNA</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-wrap><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; National Science Council Taipei 2008</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-wrap></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p>The human diploid genome contains &#x0223c;400 ribosomal RNA gene (rDNA) copies, each of which is composed of a 13&#x000a0;kb transcribed region and a 30&#x000a0;kb intergenic spacer. These units are arranged in a mosaic of canonical and palindromic repeats [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>], collectively spanning megabases on each of the short arms of the five acrocentric chromosomes 13, 14, 15, 21 and 22, at positions termed nucleolar organizer regions (NORs) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. The remaining parts of the acrocentric short arms are composed of interspersed arrays of different repetitive satellite DNA, which extend to the centromeric and telomeric regions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. As cells exit from mitosis, transcription of the rDNA loci leads to the formation of numerous mini-nucleoli around the active NORs. These small nucleoli tend to coalesce into a single or a few large nucleoli in the interphase nucleus by mechanisms that are currently unknown [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Evidence has shown that the rDNA and the centromeric sequences of acrocentric chromosomes are closely juxtaposed in the interphase nucleus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>], and that several NOR-bearing chromosomes are involved in the development of one nucleolus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Notably, at any given time only a subset of the rDNA is actively transcribed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>], and most of the transcriptionally silent NORs are also included in nucleoli [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Thus, in addition to the rDNA transcription and ribosome biogenesis, in which both activities are believed to be essential for maintaining the nucleolar integrity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>], certain unknown structural elements must exist for tethering the short arms of the five acrocentric chromosomes into a nearby spatial location in interphase to facilitate the formation of a large nucleolar territory.</p><p>The nucleolar territory in higher eukaryotic cells consists of three morphologically distinct zones as observed by electron microscopy. Pale fibrillar centers (FCs) are surrounded by dense fibrillar components (DFCs) to form many round-shaped islets, which in turn are embedded in granular components (GCs) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. The rDNA repeats localize to the FCs and/or DFCs that represent interphase NORs and thereby sites of transcription. In the DFCs, nascent pre-rRNA transcripts give rise to the &#x0201c;Christmas trees&#x0201d; structure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>] and subject to the early processing events [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Subsequently, these transcripts move to the GCs for the late processing steps followed by the assembly of the mature rRNA and ribosomal proteins into preribosomal particles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. On the light microscopy level, the RNA polymerase I (pol I) or the rDNA foci combined with the nucleolar Br-UTP incorporation sites, equivalent to the FCs and DFCs, can be visualized as intense dots embedded within the nucleolar body [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>].</p><p>The Nopp140 homologous proteins of rat, human, frog and fruit fly distribute in the nucleolus in a dotted pattern; their sequences show a three-domain feature, a large central region with alternating acidic and basic motifs surrounded by the small N- and C-terminal segments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. The C-terminal domain is conserved in all Nopp140 homologs across a broad range of eukaryotes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. In contrast, the N-terminal domain is highly conserved in mammals but divergent in other species, and even absent in the budding yeast [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. Reports based on coimmunoprecipitation indicate that Nopp140 associates with both FC and DFC components, representing by pol I and small nucleolar ribonucleoprotein (snoRNP) complexes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. It has been suggested that Nopp140 is not essential for the box H/ACA snoRNP-mediated pseudouridylation of rRNA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>] and that the involvement of Nopp140 in U3 snoRNP biogenesis occurs in nucleoplasm but not in nucleolus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. Nopp140 is known to be present predominantly in the nucleolus and its precise roles in the early ribosome biogenesis remain unclear. Nevertheless, there are clues that functions of Nopp140 may relate to the nucleolar structural organization. For example, deletion mutants of Nopp140 with dominant-negative effects can alter the normal distribution of nucleolar components and arrest the rDNA transcription [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. Here, we report that human Nopp140 (hNopp140) relies respectively on its N- and C-terminal domains for tethering the &#x003b1;-satellite DNA and the rDNA repeats of acrocentric chromosomes to facilitate the nucleolar formation and rDNA transcription. These findings imply that Nopp140, as a nucleolar architectural scaffold, is involved in the assembly of FCs and DFCs.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Antibodies</title><p>Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) used included M2 (IgG1; anti-Flag; Sigma), 9E10 (IgG1; anti-c-Myc; Santa Cruz), CP2 (IgG2a; anti-hNopp140), HC2 (IgG2b; anti-hNopp140), JY1 (IgG1; anti-hNopp140), F9 (IgG1; anti-upstream binding factor; Santa Cruz), Tau-1 (IgG2a; anti-nuclear tau; a gift from Lester I.

To label the rDNA and the &#x003b1;-satellite probes with biotin, PCR was performed in the presence of biotin-16-dUTP (Roche) using the plasmids above as templates and the same pairs of primer sets. The probes were then eluted and resuspended in hybridization buffer (2&#x000d7; SSC, standard saline citrate [pH 7.2]; 50% formamide; 10% dextran sulfate).

Unlike the full-length hNopp140, it retained less effectively in the nucleolus, as indicated by immunofluorescence in the nucleoplasm.

When expression levels were low, DM2 formed round-shaped structures whose peripheries displayed an uneven distribution of DM2. The rDNA repeats localized in the DM2-rich area (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>c, i). Some exhibited patched patterns of DM2 distribution, and, notably, rDNA repeats always colocalized with DM2 (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>c, iii and iv, arrows). As the DM2 expression increased, the small circles coalesced into large asymmetric spheres that harbored rDNA repeats wherever DM2 was abundant (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>c, ii).

The maximal intensity of DM3 in nucleoli could reach a constant, and the excessive DM3 was accumulated in the nucleoplasm (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>d, compare the two cells; see also Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>e and g).

Consistently, autoantibodies to centromeric proteins detect interphase centromeres in locations around and within nucleoli as well as along the nuclear envelope [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>]. Recent data have demonstrated that nucleolar tau interacts with AT-rich pericentromeric satellite sequences [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>]. Thus, there are links between nucleolus and centromeric heterochromatin. We observed that overexpressed hNopp140 remained at sites corresponding to the peri-nucleolar condensed chromatin (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>c), which is known to have centromeric sequences [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Although the C-terminally truncated mutant of hNopp140 lost the ability to colocalize with rDNA, it still anchored at positions equivalent to the extended peri-nucleolar chromatin (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>b). Apparently, there could be chromatin-binding sites distal to rDNA loci for retention of this mutant protein in the nucleolus. We, therefore, used a 287&#x000a0;bp &#x003b1;-satellite DNA probe, which selectively detects acrocentric chromosomes 13, 14 and 21 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>], to monitor the locations of these &#x003b1;-satellite elements in control and transfected HeLa cells. The validity of the probe was demonstrated on metaphase spreads, of which only regions near the ends representing the centromeres of the acrocentric chromosomes were hybridized (data not shown). In interphase, the hNopp140-containing islets were embedded within areas positive to the &#x003b1;-satellite of chromosomes 13, 14 and 21 (&#x003b1;13,14,21) in the control HeLa cells (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>a). In cells overexpressing hNopp140, the &#x003b1;13,14,21 arrays were enriched at the periphery of the enlarged sphere (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>b), a pattern similar to that of rDNA (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>c). Note that the adjacent small circles before integrated into the large sphere were composed of both the hNopp140 and the &#x003b1;13,14,21. A negative control probe, which is specific to the centromeric &#x003b1;-satellite elements of chromosome 9 (&#x003b1;9) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>], did not hybridize the chromatin at the nucleolar region (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>f).</p><p>In mutant expression experiments, the acrocentric &#x003b1;-satellite arrays colocalized with DM1 in a concave pattern without occupying the indent spaces (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>c), but filled up areas of the sphere wherever DM2 was sparse (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>d). Thus, the &#x003b1;13,14,21 became separate from the rDNA in both DM1 and DM2 transfectants (compare Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>c and d with Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>b and c, respectively). Disruption of the nucleolar structure was further supported by the evidence that pol I was mislocalized to the DM1 and DM2 rich regions (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>g, the first and second rows). In contrast, DM3 did not alter distribution of the &#x003b1;13,14,21 (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>e). The normally nucleolar punctate pattern of pol I also supported that DM3 did not change the general nucleolar architecture (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>g, the third row). Furthermore, double immunofluorescence staining for detecting the endogenous pol I and upstream binding factor (UBF) demonstrated that these two proteins were colocalized in the altered nucleoli where the DM1 or the DM2 was also accumulated as judged by the distinct phenotypes of cells expressing these two types of truncated hNopp140 (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>g, the fourth and fifth rows).</p><p>We also analyzed rDNA transcription in cells expressing DM1 or DM2. A faint incorporation of Br-UTP occurred at the border of the invaginations of DM1-containing spheres (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>h, upper row; arrows point out the invaginations). It was already known that in these DM1-derived structures, the rDNA was condensed mostly in the indent areas (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>b), where pol I and UBF were excluded (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>g). Thus, residual levels of rDNA transcription took place only at the contact sites between rDNA and transcription machinery. On the other hand, Br-UTP incorporation was detected at sites of DM2-enriched region (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>h, lower row), where the rDNA, pol I, and UBF were collected together (Figs.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>c and&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>g). We have constantly observed that the inhibition of rDNA transcription was more severe in the altered nucleoli induced by DM1 than those by DM2 (compare the transfected cells with the neighboring untransfected cells in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>h). All results argue for that the N- and C-termini of hNopp140 interplay respectively with chromatin regions containing the &#x003b1;-satellite and rDNA repeats of acrocentric chromosomes during interphase for the correct nucleolar assembly and the optimal rDNA transcription.</p></sec><sec id="Sec15"><title>The joined N- and C-terminal domains of hNopp140 anchor on the nucleolar condensed chromatin</title><p>In order to further evaluate roles of the two ends of the hNopp140 molecule, we constructed deletion clones encoding the N-terminal domain (DM7), C-terminal domain (DM8; NLS-&#x003b2; region also included for a better nuclear targeting), and fused N- and C-terminal domains (DM9) of hNopp140 (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>a). Transfectants expressing the Flag-tagged DM7, DM8 or DM9 were subjected to double immunofluorescence staining with mAbs to Flag-tag and to hNopp140 (amino acids 384&#x02013;399 as the epitope region). Thus, localization of the mutant proteins and the endogenous hNopp140 could be traced simultaneously. We observed that at low expression levels, all DM9 targeted to nucleolus and colocalized with the endogenous hNopp140 (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>b, dashed arrows). As the expression levels increased, DM9 frequently showed a ring-like distribution pattern (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>a and b, arrows), which matched well with the peri-nucleolar condensed chromatin (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>a, right panel, arrows). The rings became masked when the nucleoplasm collected more DM9. Nevertheless, DM7 or DM8 did not form distinct rings (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>c and d). Occasionally very faintly stained rings were seen. At much higher expression levels, all showed relatively homogeneous distribution patterns in nuclei (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>b&#x02013;d, left panels, arrowheads); however, only DM9 (no longer with visible rings), but not DM7 and DM8, caused the endogenous hNopp140-containing dots to be spread into nucleoplasm (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>b&#x02013;d, arrowheads). This phenomenon occurred only when cells overexpressed DM9 or two other similar mutant proteins, DM10 and DM11 (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>a), demonstrating the competition between the endogenous hNopp140 and the mutant proteins for the same binding sites. <fig id="Fig4"><label>Fig.&#x000a0;4</label><caption><p>Analysis of the N- and C-terminal parts of hNopp140.

As the DM9 expression was increased further, chromatin condensation then became obvious, which was always accompanied with phenomena that hNopp140 and UBF were undetectable or fully dispersed, and that pol I was densely packed (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>a, arrows; see also Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>b).

In contrast, the &#x003b1;13,14,21 arrays were dispersed away and became hardly detectable in cells with condensed chromatin due to extremely high expression of DM9 (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>b, the second row, arrows).

To test this, we cotransfected the wild type of hNopp140 or its mutant DM3, encoding only the central ten repeats, each with two different tags, into 293T cells. Specific interactions were examined when lysates were reciprocally precipitated with one tag-specific antibody and blotted with the other. Flag- and Myc-tagged hNopp140 were coimmunoprecipitated by each other (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>a). In contrast, the central ten repeats of hNopp140 showed a weak interaction (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>b). We further performed coimmunoprecipitation assays on cell lysates from 293T cells after transient transfection with a number of Flag-tagged deletion mutants of hNopp140.

However, DM4, DM5 and DM6, representing various parts of the central repeated domain of hNopp140 (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>a), completely lost the ability to precipitate hNopp140 (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>c, lanes 12, 9 and 6). Surprisingly, mutants with the joined N- and C-terminal domains of hNopp140 (DM9 or DM10) precipitated the endogenous hNopp140 more effectively than the DM3 did (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>c, lanes 15 and 18). <fig id="Fig7"><label>Fig.&#x000a0;7</label><caption><p>Determination of the self-self interacting domain of hNopp140.

This turned out to be true, since DNase digestion of the anti-Flag immunoprecipitates, prepared from DM9-transfected 293T cells, allowed the bound endogenous hNopp140 to be released into the supernatant (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>d, upper right panel). Similar results were obtained when we examined whether the endogenous hNopp140 interacts with fragments containing its own N- or C-terminal domains, as represented by DM7 and DM8, respectively (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>d, lower panel). However, the same DNase treatment did not alter the weak interaction between DM3 and the endogenous hNopp140 (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>d, upper left panel).

HeLa cells were transiently transfected with specific siRNA duplexes by using lipofectamine. After incubation for 72&#x000a0;h, about 70% of the cell populations, as estimated at the single cell level, showed down-regulation of hNopp140. Thus, the neighboring cells either with or without reduction of the endogenous hNopp140 could be compared with each other. Localizations of UBF and pol I were not noticeably affected when the hNopp140 was reduced to a barely detectable level (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref>a and b). In contrast, the rDNA and &#x003b1;13,14,21 repeats were dispersed away from the nucleoli after RNAi knockdown of hNopp140 (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref>c and d; note that the signals for &#x003b1;13,14,21 can be seen in the nucleoplasm). Additionally, using a non-targeting siRNA as the control, the normal distributions of rDNA and &#x003b1;13,14,21 were observed (data not shown). rDNA transcription was then assessed by monitoring Br-UTP incorporation into nascent nucleolar RNA. Evidently, the nucleolar uptake of Br-UTP was decreased to a near undetectable level in cells with hNopp140 being effectively down regulated (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref>e). Because the rDNA transcription machinery remained in the nucleolus under the same situation (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref>a and b), transcriptional silence was likely due to the mislocalization of rDNA repeats. Thus, the topographic distribution of rDNA and &#x003b1;13,14,21 repeats in nucleolus is more sensitive to shortage of the hNopp140 than do the nucleolar transcription-related factors. <fig id="Fig8"><label>Fig.&#x000a0;8</label><caption><p>RNAi knockdown of hNopp140.

The NOR-associated UBF and pol I serve as docking sites for nucleolar reformation at the exit of mitosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>]. Moreover, the rDNA chromatin specified by extensive UBF binding can recruit pol I transcription and pre-rRNA processing machineries for coordinating the early events of ribosome biogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>]. However, there must be other components with inherent affinities responsible for spatial organization of rDNA repeats and for nucleolar fusion during nucleologenesis. In this dynamic process, the multiple NORs are drawn to the proximity for facilitating the formation of one or a few large nucleoli [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>]. Furthermore, pol I-driven transcription per se is not sufficient for the maintenance of nucleolar morphology [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>]. The work described in this paper has revealed that hNopp140 is involved in the nucleolar assembly and maintenance as mediated by tethering of both rDNA and acrocentric &#x003b1;-satellite sequences.</p><p>Domains for binding to the acrocentric &#x003b1;-satellite and rDNA chromatin regions have been defined at the N- and C-termini of hNopp140, respectively. Without the ten central repeats of hNopp140, the deletion mutants, only when the N- and C-terminal domains are joined together as represented by DM9, can be concentrated in the nucleolar chromatin-rich places and compete away the endogenous hNopp140. Thus, under physiological condition, the two ends of the hNopp140 molecule are likely folded to a proximal position to create an anchoring domain. Unlike the full-length hNopp140, DM9 does not expand the nucleolar region; and the central ten-repeat, as shown by DM3, homogeneously distributes to the nucleolus in a saturable fashion without affecting the nucleolar appearance. Apparently, both the anchoring domain and the central repeats of hNopp140 are required for hNopp140 to establish the nucleolar round-shaped structure. As the anchoring domains from many hNopp140 molecules attach to chromatin containing the rDNA and acrocentric &#x003b1;-satellite arrays, their central repeated regions are able to interact with each other, resulting in forming a highly ordered structure that appears normally as multiple adjacent islets, which can be expanded and fused to become one large sphere if hNopp140 is in large excess. This concept has been supported by the fact that, in addition to the chromatin binding features, hNopp140 has a central repeated domain for homologous self-self interaction. Furthermore, the hNopp140 mutants missing either the N- or the C-terminal domains have shown the strongly dominant-negative effects to mislocalize the acrocentric &#x003b1;-satellite, rDNA repeats, pol I and UBF resulting in blockade of rDNA transcription. Apparently, hNopp140, rDNA repeats and acrocentric &#x003b1;-satellite sequences are all involved in forming the nucleolar dotted structure, which is equivalent to the FC and the surrounding DFC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>].</p><p>It has been proposed that a nucleolar factory with an FC at its core contains about four transcriptionally active rDNA units [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>]. There are &#x0223c;150 actively transcribed ribosomal genes per HeLa nucleus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>]. About 10&#x02013;40 rDNA foci (or nucleolar factories) on the light microscopy level have been mapped in one HeLa nucleus, in which the in situ length of a contorted transcribing rDNA (the 13&#x000a0;kb coding region) has been calculated to be &#x0223c;800&#x000a0;nm on the electron microscopy level [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Thus, the rDNA repeats on one chromosome can extend to a considerable distance in nucleus. It is conceivable that these rDNA units even coming from different acrocentric chromosomes are possibly assembled into one round-shaped islet. In each nucleus there are tens of islets, which together may have actually cross-linked all or most of the acrocentric chromosomes. We propose that the assembly of the islets is mediated, at least in part, through hNopp140, due to its unique nature of auto-interaction and recognition of common elements present in the rDNA loci as well as in the centromeric regions of acrocentric chromosomes. Once these chromosomes are cross-linked by the assembled islets during interphase, nucleolar fusion (i.e., multiple NORs to be joined into one nucleolus) would be the consequence.</p><p>The evolutionally conserved N- and C-termini of hNopp140 appear to recognize two distinct DNA sequence elements. One element recognized by the C-terminus of hNopp140 locates within the rDNA cluster region, since the tail-less mutant, DM1, renders the rDNA clusters to be free and to be squeezed out. The transcription-active rDNA repeats associated with nascent rRNA transcripts, seen as the &#x0201c;Christmas trees&#x0201d;, are free of regularly spaced nucleosomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>], and are mobile during transcription in a template-sliding model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>]. Therefore, we interpret our results that these less compact rDNA clusters may be released from the gradually enlarged DM1-containing sphere and eventually condensed into one or two tiny spots that occupy spaces at poles of the sphere. In this context, the DM1 molecules missing only the C-termini can still recognize a second type of elements in nucleolus, likely the acrocentric &#x003b1;-satellite arrays, through their N-termini, and expand the nucleolar territory via the homologous interaction of the central repeated domains until the large concave spheres appear. Conversely, the head-less mutant molecules of hNopp140, DM2, unleash the acrocentric &#x003b1;-satellite sequences while bringing the rDNA repeats over the DM2-dense region to yield the nucleolar large spheres with asymmetric morphology. In situ run-on transcription assays also support that the DM1 and DM2 with their different partitioning effects can alter locations of the rDNA transcription. Taken together, the N- or the C-terminally truncated hNopp140 can induce nucleolar segregation mediated by detaching the rDNA repeats from the acrocentric &#x003b1;-satellite arrays.</p><p>The siRNA-mediated blockade of hNopp140 expression reduces but not completely depletes the endogenous hNopp140, possibly due to its slow turnover rate at the protein level, that is consistent with a report using a different targeting sequence for Nopp140 knockdown [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. Our results indicate that when the amount of hNopp140 is below a certain threshold, both rDNA repeats and &#x003b1;13,14,21 arrays do not stably stay in the nucleolus. Although it is possible that other components may also be involved in mediating the nucleolar retention of these two DNA sequences, hNopp140 seems relatively more important for rDNA and &#x003b1;13,14,21 to be maintained in nucleolus.</p><p>The UBF has been shown to bind to the entire rDNA clusters [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>] and to cause chromatin relaxation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref>]. Interestingly, we found that greatly overexpressed DM9 induced global chromatin condensation that was accompanied with the dispersion of UBF, hNopp140 and acrocentric &#x003b1;-satellite arrays. Under such conditions, the pol I changed its positioning status from a loosely punctate into a densely compact distribution manner, and so did the rDNA. Release of UBF from the rDNA clusters may contribute to condensation of this region. Moreover, the observation of large-scale chromatin condensation across the entire genome during interphase indicates that DM9 can modulate the general chromatin structure. A logical speculation would be that, in addition to the specific recognition of the chromatin regions of the rDNA and the &#x003b1;13,14,21, DM9 might also have a weak binding ability to sites representing a common chromatin configuration. Once the specific nucleolar binding sites have been saturated by DM9, the excessive DM9 accumulated in the nucleoplasm is able to interact with chromatin and alter general features of the chromatin architecture. It is likely that chromatin region of &#x003b1;13,14,21 arrays can escape from nucleolus and distribute into nucleoplasm owing to the pulling effects through DM9, as mediated by recognition of a specific DNA sequence and a nonspecific chromatin configuration. The exact mechanisms remain to be determined.</p><p>The Nopp140-chromatin-UBF complexes are for collecting the polymerase I transcription factors and the pre-rRNA processing/modification machineries to engage in activities during the early ribosome biogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>]. The rRNA intermediate products are then transferred from the Nopp140-containing islets (FC plus DFC) to the surrounding GC compartment for further maturation. Our current findings suggest that Nopp140 is involved in the assembly, fusion, and maintenance of nucleolus.
