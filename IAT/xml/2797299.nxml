Our hypothesis is that epigenetics is also involved in the gestational programming of adult phenotype by alcohol. We have developed a model of gestational ethanol exposure in the mouse based on maternal <italic>ad libitum</italic> ingestion of 10&#x00025; (v/v) ethanol between gestational days 0.5&#x02013;8.5 and observed changes in the expression of an epigenetically-sensitive allele, <italic>Agouti viable yellow</italic> (<italic>A<sup>vy</sup></italic>), in the offspring. We found that exposure to ethanol increases the probability of transcriptional silencing at this locus, resulting in more mice with an agouti-colored coat. As expected, transcriptional silencing correlated with hypermethylation at <italic>A<sup>vy</sup></italic>. This demonstrates, for the first time, that ethanol can affect adult phenotype by altering the epigenotype of the early embryo. Interestingly, we also detected postnatal growth restriction and craniofacial dysmorphology reminiscent of fetal alcohol syndrome, in congenic <italic>a/a</italic> siblings of the <italic>A<sup>vy</sup></italic> mice. These findings suggest that moderate ethanol exposure <italic>in utero</italic> is capable of inducing changes in the expression of genes other than <italic>A<sup>vy</sup></italic>, a conclusion supported by our genome-wide analysis of gene expression in these mice. In addition, offspring of female mice given free access to 10&#x00025; (v/v) ethanol for four days per week for ten weeks prior to conception also showed increased transcriptional silencing of the <italic>A<sup>vy</sup></italic> allele. Our work raises the possibility of a role for epigenetics in the etiology of fetal alcohol spectrum disorders, and it provides a mouse model that will be a useful resource in the continued efforts to understand the consequences of gestational alcohol exposure at the molecular level.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><p>In humans it has been known for some time that exposure to environmental insults during pregnancy can harm a developing fetus and have life-long effects on the individual's health. A well known example is fetal alcohol syndrome, where the children of mothers that consume large amounts of alcohol during pregnancy exhibit growth retardation, changes to the shape and size of the skull, and central nervous system defects. At present the molecular events underlying fetal alcohol syndrome are unknown. We have developed a model of alcohol exposure in the mouse, in which the genetics and the environment can be strictly controlled. We find that chronic exposure of the fetus to a physiologically relevant amount of alcohol during the first half of pregnancy results in epigenetic changes at a sensitive reporter gene and produces fetal alcohol syndrome-like features in some mice. Our model is a useful tool to study the underlying causes of fetal alcohol syndrome, and our work raises the interesting possibility that the long-term physical effects of alcohol exposure during pregnancy are mediated by epigenetic changes established in the fetus and then faithfully remembered for a lifetime. In the future, such epigenetic changes could be used as markers for the preclinical diagnosis and treatment of fetal alcohol spectrum disorders.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="10"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>While it is well-recognized that gestational exposure to environmental triggers can lead to compromised fetal development and adult disease in humans <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000811-Barker1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>, the underlying molecular mechanisms remain unknown.

One way of detecting such events is to use reporters whose expression is closely linked to their epigenetic state.

High levels of alcohol consumption during pregnancy can result in fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) which is characterized by prenatal and postnatal growth restriction, craniofacial dysmorphology and structural abnormalities of the central nervous system.

It should be noted that these studies used acute ethanol exposures between gestational days (GDs) 7 and 9 and high concentrations; generally two intraperitoneal injections of 0.015 ml of &#x0223c;25&#x00025; (v/v) ethanol per gram of body weight over a 4 hour interval resulting in ataxia and lethargy. These studies only examined the fetal outcomes (GDs 8-18) of ethanol exposure and did not assay offspring either after birth or as adults.

The C57BL/6J mouse is null (<italic>a</italic>) at the <italic>Agouti</italic> locus, so it has a black coat color. <italic>A<sup>vy</sup></italic> is a gain-of-function, semi-dominant mutation and so the coat color of heterozygous (<italic>A<sup>vy</sup>/a</italic>) mice in the C57BL/6J background is a direct read out of <italic>A<sup>vy</sup></italic> transcriptional activity and DNA methylation. The nature of the matings used in this study, an <italic>A<sup>vy</sup>/a</italic> male crossed with an <italic>a/a</italic> female, means that only 50&#x00025; of the offspring will inherit the <italic>A<sup>vy</sup></italic> allele and be useful for coat color phenotyping. The remaining (<italic>a/a</italic>) offspring will be black. To study the effects of gestational ethanol exposure, female <italic>a/a</italic> C57BL/6J mice were supplied with 10&#x00025; (v/v) ethanol in their drink bottles for eight days after fertilization by a congenic male carrying the <italic>A<sup>vy</sup></italic> allele (n&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;46 litters, 242 total offspring, 109 <italic>A<sup>vy</sup>/a</italic> offspring). To evaluate the effects of preconceptional ethanol exposure, female <italic>a/a</italic> mice were given 10&#x00025; (v/v) ethanol for four days per week for ten weeks prior to fertilization (n&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;22 litters, 131 total offspring, 69 <italic>A<sup>vy</sup>/a</italic> offspring). The <italic>A<sup>vy</sup></italic> allele was passed through the male germ line to avoid the bias associated with maternal transmission, where epigenetic marks can be incompletely cleared between generations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000811-Morgan1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>. Control mice were given water instead of ethanol (n&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;37 litters, 189 total offspring, 91 <italic>A<sup>vy</sup>/a</italic> offspring). Maternal ethanol exposure during gestation did not significantly alter Mendelian inheritance of the <italic>A<sup>vy</sup></italic> allele (data not shown) or litter size (control 5.1&#x000b1;0.4, ethanol exposed 5.2&#x000b1;0.3, mean&#x000b1;SEM, Student's <italic>t</italic>-test, p&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;0.9).</p><p>The establishment of epigenetic marks at <italic>A<sup>vy</sup></italic> occurs during early embryogenesis and is a probabilistic event. The resulting variable expression of <italic>A<sup>vy</sup></italic> among genetically identical mice produces individuals with a predictable range of coat colors. We found that, in the absence of any treatment, 21&#x00025; of the offspring of <italic>A<sup>vy</sup>/a</italic> sires were yellow, 66&#x00025; were mottled and 13&#x00025; were pseudoagouti (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000811-g001">Figure 1</xref>). Gestational ethanol exposure resulted in a higher proportion of pseudoagouti (Pearson's chi-square test, p&#x0003c;0.05). Twenty-eight percent of offspring were pseudoagouti compared with 13&#x00025; in the control group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000811-g001">Figure 1</xref>). Preconceptional ethanol exposure produced a similar trend (Pearson's chi-square test, p&#x0003c;0.05). This shows that ethanol exposure can influence the establishment of <italic>A<sup>vy</sup></italic> expression early in development. It increases the probability of transcriptional silencing at this particular locus. To confirm that the coat color correlated with DNA methylation at the <italic>A<sup>vy</sup></italic> allele in gestationally exposed mice, 11 CpG dinucleotides in the LTR cryptic promoter of the <italic>A<sup>vy</sup></italic> IAP were subjected to bisulfite sequencing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000811-g002">Figure 2</xref>). The results showed that, as expected, ethanol-exposed yellow mice were hypomethylated compared to ethanol-exposed pseudoagouti mice. Interestingly, atypical hypermethylated clones were found in five out of six yellow mice in the ethanol-exposed group, but they were clearly not sufficient to affect coat color. In the ethanol-exposed group 11&#x00025; of the CpG dinucleotides were methylated compared to 2&#x00025; in the control group. Using this measure a Student's <italic>t</italic>-test or non-parametric equivalent was unsuitable because the data did not meet the distribution requirements of being spread on a continuum. So we analyzed allele-specific methylation. In the ethanol-exposed group 23&#x00025; of clones showed evidence of methylation, n&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;91, compared with 8&#x00025; of clones in the control group, n&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;71 (Pearson's chi-square tests, p&#x0003c;0.01). In contrast, total DNA methylation level in ethanol exposed pseudoagouti mice (61&#x00025;) was not significantly different to that observed in the controls (65&#x00025;, Student's <italic>t</italic>-test, p&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;0.27). Equivalent results were obtained from a random effects model which allowed for the clustering of clones within mice (p&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;0.23). Bisulfite sequencing was also carried out on control and ethanol-exposed mottled mice and we found the results extremely variable from one mouse to the next within both groups (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000811.s001">Figure S1</xref>). Presumably, this is the result of the small size of the tissue sample (tail tip). The variegated expression in mottled mice means that any one sample could represent only one clonal patch, which could harbour an active or an inactive <italic>A<sup>vy</sup></italic> allele and not represent the true methylation state of the whole animal. For this reason mottled mice were not used in our analyses.</p><fig id="pgen-1000811-g001" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pgen.1000811.g001</object-id><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>Gestational and preconceptional ethanol exposure produced a higher proportion of pseudoagouti <italic>A<sup>vy</sup></italic> mice.</title><p>In each pedigree, the black square represents the <italic>a/a</italic> dam and the diamonds represent her <italic>A<sup>vy</sup>/a</italic> offspring. <italic>A<sup>vy</sup>/a</italic> sires and all <italic>a/a</italic> offspring have been excluded from the pedigrees.

We did not assay these other phenotypes following ethanol exposure in our mice as their relevance to humans is questionable since no human ortholog of the <italic>A<sup>vy</sup></italic> allele has been identified. So, while <italic>A<sup>vy</sup></italic> was initially useful as a sensitive indicator of epigenetic changes, any further study of FAS-like phenotypes must necessarily focus elsewhere in the genome. For this reason and the fact that variable <italic>Agouti</italic> expression would confound many phenotypes, all subsequent analyses were performed on the congenic <italic>a/a</italic> siblings of the <italic>A<sup>vy</sup></italic> mice. In the mouse, IAPs are present at approximately 1,000 copies per haploid genome <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000811-Kuff1">&#x0005b;28&#x0005d;</xref>. To see if gestational ethanol exposure changed the methylation level of IAPs globally, we performed bisulfite sequencing using PCR primers that anneal to all IAP LTRs and analyzed ten CpG sites in both the tail and forebrains of <italic>a/a</italic> mice. Tail DNA from eight ethanol-exposed mice (66 clones total) and eight control mice (65 clones total) were compared, and forebrain DNA from five ethanol-exposed mice (33 clones total) and five control mice (43 clones total) were compared using the Student's <italic>t</italic>-test. All samples were highly methylated and no differences between the ethanol exposure group and controls were detected (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000811.s002">Figure S2</xref>). This suggests that only a subset of IAPs, perhaps those that are usually hypomethylated, are sensitive to ethanol exposure.</p><p>To detect changes in gene expression genome-wide, we performed expression arrays with liver tissue. The benefit of using liver is its homogeneity; it consists mainly of hepatocytes and consequently subtle changes will be detectable.

Analysis of the 561 possible inter-landmark measurement combinations assessed by the 34 assigned landmarks (i.e. 34(34-1)/2) demonstrate that the majority show a consistent ratio below one, indicative of the fact that they are changed only relative to skull size and do not reflect localized altered shape. Nevertheless, numerous inter-landmark measures were shown to be significantly different from this mean form.

Strikingly, almost all of these forty most significant differences pertain to midfacial and palatal inter-landmark measures, highlighting the sensitivity of this region to the ethanol. In particular, these data reveal that the ethanol group as a whole have a relatively wider inter-orbital distance (inter-landmark measure 7&#x02013;11), yet relatively shorter midface than controls (reflected in multiple inter-landmark measures). This is consistent with the CVA findings.</p><p>A univariate analysis of inter-landmark distances (normalized to centroid size) also supported these differences between the ethanol and control groups, in particular, confirming the greater relative cranial and inter-orbital width in both males and females compared to the sex-matched controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000811-g005">Figure 5C</xref>).

We have used the <italic>A<sup>vy</sup></italic> allele to investigate the epigenetic effects of exposure to ethanol, and established two models of moderate exposure in the mouse. The first involves exposure during the first eight days after fertilization; a period that encompasses pre-implantation, implantation and the first two days of gastrulation. This model simulates the effects of ethanol exposure during the first trimester of pregnancy in humans. Based on previous studies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000811-Allan1">&#x0005b;49&#x0005d;</xref> we estimated that the peak blood alcohol level in our model is approximately 0.12&#x00025;, which is a realistic human exposure. A World Health Organization (WHO) report shows that the maximum legal blood alcohol level for driving in Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) countries varies from 0.02&#x02013;0.08&#x00025; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000811-WHO1">&#x0005b;50&#x0005d;</xref>. The second model involves ethanol consumption for ten weeks immediately prior to fertilization; a period that encompasses multiple cycles of oocyte maturation and ovulation. In mammals, oocyte maturation is characterized by the resumption of meiosis, extrusion of the first polar body and the accumulation of RNAs and proteins in the cytoplasm in preparation for fertilization. Studies of epigenetic reprogramming have shown that following global DNA demethylation, the period of genome-wide remethylation coincides with implantation (for embryos) and oocyte growth (for female germ cells) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000811-Reik1">&#x0005b;51&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Our results demonstrate that gestational ethanol exposure increases the likelihood of transcriptional silencing at <italic>A<sup>vy</sup></italic>, resulting in an agouti-colored coat. It is worth emphasizing that despite being genetically identical, not all <italic>A<sup>vy</sup></italic> mice become pseudoagouti; rather there is a subtle &#x0223c;15&#x00025; increase in the proportion of pseudoagouti offspring. Previous studies have demonstrated that there is a tight correlation between DNA methylation at <italic>A<sup>vy</sup></italic> and coat color <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000811-Morgan1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>. As expected, bisulfite sequencing showed that the observed coat colors correlated with DNA methylation status in all cases. We did observe atypical hypermethylated clones in five of six yellow mice from the ethanol exposed group that, while not sufficient to change coat color, may reflect a tendency towards increased DNA methylation in this group. Preconceptional ethanol exposure produced a similar shift towards pseudoagouti in <italic>A<sup>vy</sup></italic> offspring. It is likely that the two types of ethanol exposure have different modes of action on <italic>A<sup>vy</sup></italic> because this allele is paternally-derived and not present in unfertilized oocytes. Consequently, the effects of preconceptional ethanol exposure on <italic>A<sup>vy</sup></italic> expression will be indirect, and further work will be required to understand this mechanism. It is of interest that the coat color changes observed in <italic>A<sup>vy</sup></italic> mice exposed to a methyl rich diet can be inherited across generations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000811-Cropley1">&#x0005b;52&#x0005d;</xref>. It is therefore possible that the altered coat color following alcohol exposure could also be transmitted to the next generation, but was beyond the scope of this study.</p><p>Our model of moderate gestational ethanol exposure produces a postnatal growth restriction phenotype and craniofacial dysmorphism in line with those seen with FASD in humans. It is possible that the postnatal growth restriction phenotype is an indirect effect; for example, the offspring may be smaller because of deficient maternal care between birth and weaning. It is unlikely that the dam would have been intoxicated or even experiencing ethanol withdrawal symptoms in the postpartum period since ethanol exposure ceased at GD 8.5 and water was consumed for the rest of gestation (&#x0223c;11.5 days) and throughout nursing (21 days). Regardless of whether the phenotype is a direct physiological consequence of exposure <italic>in utero</italic> or the indirect result of altered maternal behavior, we would argue that it is ultimately a product of exposure to ethanol. Interestingly the effects on skull shape in these mice, like the coat color presentation in <italic>A<sup>vy</sup></italic> mice, are variable despite the fact that the mice are isogenic. Marked variability in phenotype has also been recognized in humans in which not all children of heavily drinking mothers have the typical FAS facial phenotype; the others falling in the continuum of FASDs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000811-Hoyme1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>. While this variability has been attributed to genetic differences, and differences in the level/timing of exposure, it may also be a consequence of stochastic establishment of epigenetic state.</p><p>The mechanism by which ethanol alters the establishment of epigenetic state at <italic>A<sup>vy</sup></italic> is not known.

Any clones with lower than 90&#x00025; conversion rate were also excluded from the dataset.</p></sec><sec id="s4d"><title>Gene Expression Arrays</title><p>To detect possible changes in gene expression in gestational ethanol exposure mice compared to the controls, we used the MouseWG-6 v2.0 Expression BeadChips (Illumina). We extracted total liver RNA from 28 days old males from control and gestational ethanol groups, using a Qiagen RNeasy Plus-kit (Qiagen). We used a Bioanalyzer (Agilent RNA 6000 Nano, Agilent) to confirm the quality of RNA and accepted only samples with RNA Integrity Numbers (RINs) above 9. We amplified RNA using an Illumina TotalPrep RNA Amplification Kit and performed a Whole-Genome Gene Expression Direct Hybridization Assay (Illumina). The gene expression data from scanned microarray images generated by the Illumina BeadArrayTM Reader was analysed by the GenomeStudio Gene Expression Module (Illumina) by using probe information. Four control samples from two litters and three gestational ethanol exposure samples from three litters were analysed.</p></sec><sec id="s4e"><title>Analysis of Skull Morphology</title><p>Seventeen <italic>a/a</italic> mice (ten controls and seven ethanol exposed mice) aged between 28 and 30 days were subjected to micro-computed tomography using a SkyScan 1076 microtomograph at the Small Animal Tomographic Analysis Facility located at the University of Washington. The sex and treatment breakdown of the microCT samples is female ethanol (n&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;4), female control (n&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;5), male ethanol (n&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;3) and male control (n&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;5). Specimens were scanned at 18 micron resolution (65 kV, 150 mA, 1.0 mm Al filter) and reconstructed as series of 8-bit grayscale images. Three-dimensional models of the skulls were generated using the thresholding algorithm in Analyze 3D (Mayo Clinic, version 9.0). A grayscale value of 55 was determined to be the optimum threshold value to remove the soft tissue structures and scan noise while keeping the skull morphology intact, and was used for all specimens. Using the point measurement tool of Analyze, 35 landmarks were collected from each specimen (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000811.s005">Text S1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000811.s003">Figure S3</xref>). Specimens were digitized by the same observer (MM) to reduce inter-observer error. Visualizations showed that landmark 31 could not be accurately determined in every specimen because of the occasional fusion of the presphenoid and basisphenoid bones. Because geometric morphometrics requires homologous landmarks collected from every specimen, this landmark was omitted in subsequent analyses.</p><p>Landmark data were fed into various morphometric packages. Using the R statistical package <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000811-Venables1">&#x0005b;69&#x0005d;</xref>, linear measurements of certain common cranial dimensions were calculated from the landmark coordinates and normalized to their respective skull centroid sizes. Generalized Procrustes Analysis (GPA) was also conducted in R by using the SHAPES module. Goodall's F test was used to test for statistical significance of mean shape differences among groups. The Canonical Variates Analysis (CVA) was conducted in the MorphoJ package <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000811-Klingenberg1">&#x0005b;70&#x0005d;</xref>. The loadings of the canonical variates 1 and 2 were used to visualize the cranial shape changes depicted by each axis.</p><p>The WinEDMA package <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000811-Cole1">&#x0005b;71&#x0005d;</xref> was used to conduct Euclidean Distance Matrix Analysis. We used the FORM procedure of WinEDMA to find the landmark pairs that significantly differed between two mean forms (i.e., ethanols and controls) as measured by the form difference matrix. Following Lele and Richtsmeier <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000811-Lele3">&#x0005b;45&#x0005d;</xref>, the 90&#x00025; confidence intervals for the pairwise ratios were calculated by bootstrapping the form difference matrix 1000 times.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pgen.1000811.s001"><label>Figure S1</label><caption><p><italic>A<sup>vy</sup></italic> methylation in control offspring and offspring exposed to ethanol <italic>in utero</italic> in mottled mice.
