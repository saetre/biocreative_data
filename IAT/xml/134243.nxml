We have recently developed a novel system for isolation of genes in the Fas- and TNF-&#x003b1;-mediated pathways to apoptosis using poly(A)-connected hammerhead ribozyme libraries with randomized substrate-binding arms at both the 5&#x02032; and 3&#x02032; ends of ribozymes. The transcripts of these hybrid ribozymes have a poly(A) motif that can recruit RNA helicases and, thus, they can effectively attack target sites. In the previous studies, hybrid ribozymes were stably expressed. In order to save selection times, in this study we adopted transiently expressed hybrid ribozymes. In the case of Fas-mediated apoptosis, when we transiently introduced these hybrid-ribozyme libraries into Fas-expressing HeLa cells, we were able to isolate surviving clones that were resistant to or exhibited a delay in Fas-mediated apoptosis. We identified many pro-apoptotic genes and novel genes using this strategy with these transiently expressed hybrid-ribozyme libraries. In contrast, we identified significantly smaller numbers of candidate genes using conventional ribozyme libraries that were expressed transiently. Thus, when changes of a particular phenotype occur within a short period of time, our gene discovery system based on transiently expressed hybrid-ribozyme libraries should also be useful for the rapid identification of functional genes in the post-genome era.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>The sequence of the human genome is now available (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf476c1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf476c2">2</xref>) and it is important to identify functional human genes and to clarify their functions that are involved in particular signal transduction pathways such as growth factor-mediated pathways, a cell cycle or apoptosis. The shorter the time that is required for the identification of functional genes, the better it is as a method for the identification (we will describe the transient strategy later). The Fas protein is a member of the TNFR family of the tumor necrosis factor receptors and it induces apoptosis when associated with Fas ligand or a Fas-specific antibody (&#x003b1;-Fas) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf476c3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf476c4">4</xref>). Upon activation of Fas by the ligand or antibody, Fas induces formation of the death-inducing signaling complex, which consists of FADD and caspase 8 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf476c5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf476c6">6</xref>). Release of active caspase 8 from the complex initiates apoptosis. The major aspects of the mechanism in the Fas-mediated apoptosis are well known, but many factors that participate in this pathway remain to be characterized. Therefore, we tried to identify genes that function in this pathway using a novel method with randomized poly(A)-connected hammerhead ribozyme libraries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf476c7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf476c8">8</xref>). When the phenotype of cells changes upon introduction of a ribozyme library, genes that are responsible for the changes in phenotype can be identified by sequencing the active ribozyme clones.</p><p>Hammerhead ribozymes are small RNA molecules that can catalyze cleavage of an RNA in a sequence-specific manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf476c9">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf476c14">14</xref>). These ribozymes can be designed to cleave any RNA substrate that contains an NUX triplet, where N can be any nucleotide and X can be C, A or U and, thus, they have been used successfully to knock out the intracellular expression of a variety of specific viral and cellular targets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf476c15">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf476c20">20</xref>). The major limitations to effective intracellular ribozyme use are target site accessibility and co-localization of ribozymes with target RNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf476c21">21</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf476c25">25</xref>). Since transcripts of target RNAs form secondary and tertiary structures, they may interfere with accessions from ribozymes. To determine the best target site on a target RNA, an <italic>in vitro</italic> approach that utilizes the binding of randomized DNA oligonucleotides to an <italic>in vitr</italic>o synthesized RNA and&#x0002f;or a computer prediction such as MulFold are generally used (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf476c20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf476c26">26</xref>). To overcome this target site accessibility problem, we recently constructed two novel hybrid ribozymes, a poly(A)-connected ribozyme (tRNA<sup>Val</sup>-Rz-A60; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf476c7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf476c8">8</xref>) and a constitutive transport element-connected ribozyme (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf476c27">27</xref>), and demonstrated that ribozymes of both types have strong cleavage activity and substrate-unwinding activity, regardless of the putative secondary or tertiary structure of the target in the vicinity of the actual target site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf476c27">27</xref>).</p><p>We also demonstrated recently that a rapid identification of functional genes is possible, using the RNA helicase-associated hybrid-ribozyme libraries, which were expressed stably, with randomized substrate-binding arms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf476c7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf476c8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf476c28">28</xref>). We identified many pro-apoptotic genes and novel genes using this strategy with these hybrid-ribozyme libraries. In using this method, inhibition of the expression of a particular gene was reflected by a change in a particular phenotype; hence, the method allowed the easy and rapid identification of functional genes. However, in the previous studies, as we stably expressed the hybrid-ribozyme libraries, it took a few weeks for each selection cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf476c7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf476c8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf476c28">28</xref>). As we felt that it would be possible, depending on the speed of appearance of a specific phenotype, to transiently express the hybrid-ribozyme libraries, we tried in this study to take such an approach in the Fas-mediated pathway to apoptosis. We demonstrate in this work that our gene discovery system based on transiently expressed hybrid-ribozyme libraries is indeed useful for the rapid identification of functional genes in the post-genome era.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Construction of randomized hammerhead ribozyme libraries</title><p>Chemically synthesized oligonucleotides encoding a randomized ribozyme sequence (5&#x02032;-TCC CCG GTT CGA AAC CGG GCA CTA CAA AAA CCA ACT TCN NNN NNN NNN CTG ATG AGG CCG AAA GGC CGA ANN NNN NNN NNG GTA CCC CGG ATA TCT TTT TTT-3&#x02032;) with a total of 20 randomized nucleotides in the substrate-binding arm and a pol III termination sequence (TTTTTT) were converted to double-stranded DNAs by PCR.

After 24 h, HeLa-Fas cells that expressed the randomized library were treated with Fas-specific antibody (&#x003b1;-Fas). After 36 h, surviving cells were picked up manually and plasmid DNA was purified from these survival cells.

The intracellular activities of ribozymes depend on the level of expression of the ribozyme and the secondary structure of the target mRNA in cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf476c15">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf476c20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf476c24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf476c25">25</xref>). Therefore, we chose to express ribozyme libraries under the control of the promoter of a human gene for tRNA<sup>Val</sup>, which can be expected to produce high-level expression of transcripts in cells. We then introduced these ribozyme libraries transiently into HeLa-Fas cells. A schematic diagram of the transient gene discovery system for the Fas-mediated pathway to apoptosis is shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf476f1">1</xref>B. After transfection with libraries, cells were treated with Fas-specific antibodies (&#x003b1;-Fas, C-11; MBL, Nagoya, Japan). After 36 h, surviving cells were picked up manually and the plasmid DNA was purified from these surviving cells. Then we introduced isolated plasmids into <italic>E.coli</italic> and these plasmids were amplified to a limited extent in <italic>E.coli</italic>. After purification of the amplified plasmids, we re-introduced these plasmids into HeLa-Fas cells and repeated this cycle five times in all. Finally, we introduced these isolated plasmids into <italic>E.coli</italic> and the transformed <italic>E.coli</italic> cells were plated on a LB plate. Each independent plasmid was isolated from clones of <italic>E.coli</italic> cells. The sequences of active ribozymes included in these plasmids were analyzed with an automated DNA sequencer. Finally, we searched for the target genes of these ribozymes and identified them using the BLAST search program (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf476c31">31</xref>), as we did previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf476c7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf476c8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf476c28">28</xref>).</p><p>We realized that this transient gene discovery system would function optimally with the delivery of one type of ribozyme-encoding plasmid per cell. However, in transient transfection systems, in many cases, multiple plasmids are introduced into the same cell. Thus, background clones exhibiting Fas-mediated apoptosis can be observed when a cell contains a specific anti-apoptosis ribozyme and other unrelated background ribozymes. To overcome this problem, we performed multi-cycle selection, and determined numbers of surviving clones after each cycle (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf476f2">2</xref>B). We also compared the effects of conventional ribozyme libraries and poly(A)-connected ribozyme libraries (ribozyme-A60 library) in order to confirm the effectiveness of the unwinding activity of RNA helicase eIF4AI &#x0005b;we have confirmed previously that the poly(A)-connected ribozymes can make a complex with eIF4AI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf476c7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf476c8">8</xref>)&#x0005d;.</p><p>We first examined the levels of tRNA<sup>Val</sup>-Rz or tRNA<sup>Val</sup>-Rz-A60 transcripts in cells by RT&#x02013;PCR. As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf476f2">2</xref>A, the levels of expression were nearly identical for both ribozyme libraries, within the limits of experimental errors. Since a hybrid ribozyme with an attached helicase can attack the target site effectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf476c7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf476c8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf476c27">27</xref>), when we used the poly(A)-connected ribozyme library, the number of surviving clones and, thus, the number of genes identified was much greater than when we use the conventional ribozyme library (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf476f2">2</xref>B). It should be noted that this is the third example that indicates that poly(A)-connected ribozyme libraries were significantly more effective than their conventional counterparts in the gene discovery system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf476c7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf476c8">8</xref>).</p><p>Although several genes were recently identified by randomized ribozyme libraries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf476c7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf476c8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf476c28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf476c32">32</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf476c35">35</xref>), our present method is the first transient method and our data clearly demonstrate that multi-cycle selection can be used to rapidly identify functional genes. In our previous strategies based on stably expressed hybrid-ribozyme libraries, it usually took 2 weeks for each selection cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf476c7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf476c8">8</xref>), whereas the time required for each cycle in this transient strategy was 4 days. Using our newly devised transient method, as shown in Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="gkf476tb1">1</xref>, we identified many genes that are known to have pro-apoptotic functions during Fas-induced apoptosis, such as genes for FADD, caspases 3, 8 and 9, Bik (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf476c36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf476c37">37</xref>), Apaf-1 and DNase CAD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf476c38">38</xref>). Moreover, we also isolated many novel genes (indicated by UG in Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="gkf476tb1">1</xref>). To confirm that the active ribozymes that were targeted to the various genes had, in fact, cleaved the respective mRNAs in cells, we performed RT&#x02013;PCR analysis using primers specific for Bik and for CAD, which were not identified by our previous stable expression system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf476c7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf476c8">8</xref>).</p><p>As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf476f3">3</xref>A, the level of Bik mRNA in HeLa-Fas cells that expressed a poly(A)-connected Bik ribozyme was 5-fold lower than levels in wild-type HeLa-Fas cells and in cells that expressed inactive ribozymes (&#x02018;Bik-inactive Rz-A60&#x02019;, with a single G-to-A mutation at a catalytically important, conserved nucleotide). Similar results were obtained in the case of CAD-Rz-A60 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf476f3">3</xref>A). The level of CAD mRNA in HeLa-Fas cells that expressed a poly(A)-connected CAD ribozyme was more than 10-fold lower than levels in wild-type HeLa-Fas cells and in cells that expressed inactive ribozymes. It should be emphasized that, in both cases, transiently expressed conventional ribozymes without the poly(A) tail failed to effectively cleave the mRNAs, indicating that we would not have identified these genes if we had not used the RNA helicase-associated ribozymes. Importantly, when the novel target genes (UG1&#x02013;UG43) were analyzed using RT&#x02013;PCR with specific up primers and oligo dT down primers, the level of respective mRNA was also reduced dramatically in HeLa-Fas cells that expressed a poly(A)-connected specific ribozyme, as compared with levels in wild-type HeLa-Fas cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf476f3">3</xref>B).</p><p>We next investigated whether apoptotic functions were correlated with phenotype in our gene discovery system. We examined the relative numbers of apoptotic cells that expressed various ribozymes during apoptosis that was induced by &#x003b1;-Fas using the TUNEL method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf476c16">16</xref>). We counted TUNEL-positive cells 36 h after the start of treatment with &#x003b1;-Fas. As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf476f4">4</xref>A, apoptosis occurred in wild-type cells after treatment with &#x003b1;-Fas. In contrast, cells that expressed the poly(A)-connected ribozymes Bik-Rz-A60 or CAD-Rz-A60 exhibited significantly reduced progress towards apoptosis. Control cells that expressed inactive ribozymes targeted to Bik mRNA or CAD mRNA underwent apoptosis. These results suggest that the phenotypes of cells that expressed either Bik-Rz or CAD-Rz were correlated with those of positive clones obtained by our gene discovery method, demonstrating the usefulness and validity of this transient method. In agreement with the results shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf476f3">3</xref>, the conventional ribozymes without the poly(A) motif did not slow down the apoptotic process. Therefore, it should be emphasized again that, in the absence of the poly(A) tail, we would not have identified Bik and CAD in our screening with the conventional ribozyme libraries (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf476f4">4</xref>A). Moreover, cells that expressed poly(A)-connected ribozymes against the respective novel genes (UG1&#x02013;UG43) exhibited a significant delay in apoptosis after treatment with &#x003b1;-Fas (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf476f4">4</xref>B). We are now cloning and analyzing them.</p><p>In this study, we developed a transient system for the rapid identification of functional genes using hybrid-ribozyme libraries. Progress with differential display and microarray technologies has recently been considerable. These technologies allow identification of genes that are turned on or off in association with a particular phenotype. However, genes identified using these systems might simply represent downstream effects (outcomes caused by other upstream genes) and it might prove difficult to identify the genes that are really responsible for a change in phenotype, in other words, the genes that are directly responsible for the specific phenotype. However, since genes identified in our gene discovery system are directly related to a specific change in phenotype, we can directly identify functional genes that are directly responsible for the phenotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf476c7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf476c8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf476c28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf476c32">32</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf476c35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf476c39">39</xref>). However, these systems depend heavily on the efficiency of ribozymes and it is important to use our hybrid ribozymes, such as poly(A)-connected ribozymes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf476c7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf476c8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf476c28">28</xref>) that recruit the RNA helicase eIF4AI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf476c40">40</xref>), which are significantly more effective than the corresponding unmodified conventional ribozymes (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf476f2">2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf476f3">3</xref>).</p><p>We clearly demonstrate here that the time required for each selection cycle can be shortened from 2 weeks for stably expressed hybrid-ribozyme libraries to 4 days if we use the transient expression system. Moreover, since conventional ribozymes cannot cleave target sites that form stable secondary structures, our novel functional gene screening system using hybrid-ribozyme libraries, which can be expressed either stably (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf476c7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf476c8">8</xref>) or transiently (as demonstrated here depending on the time required to observe a specific phenotype), should be a powerful tool for the rapid identification of functional genes in the post-genome era.</p></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="display-objects"><title>Figures and Tables</title><fig id="gkf476f1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p> The rationale for the system for discovery of genes that act in Fas-mediated apoptosis using poly(A)-connected ribozyme libraries.
