The gene was initially identified based on the constitutive pathogen response phenotype of the mutants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>], and appears to act just downstream of pathogen recognition and upstream of salicylic acid in <italic>NPR1</italic>-dependent disease resistance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. In addition, Boch and co-workers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>] showed that <italic>CPR5 </italic>activates pathogenesis-related (PR) gene expression in the <italic>RPS2</italic>-mediated pathway and not the <italic>RPM1</italic>-mediated pathway. However, <italic>CPR5 </italic>appears to play a broader role in plant growth and development as well, because <italic>cpr5 </italic>mutants exhibit defects in cell proliferation and cell expansion, and the gene has been hypothesized to play a role in programmed cell death [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. In addition, <italic>cpr5 </italic>mutants are hyper-responsive to glucose and sucrose and prematurely accumulate senescence-regulated transcripts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. The <italic>CPR5 </italic>gene encodes a putative membrane protein with five putative transmembrane domains at the carboxy-terminus, a putative bipartite nuclear localization signal at the amino-terminus, and no sequence similarity to other known proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>].</p><p>In contrast to other constitutive pathogen response mutants, <italic>cpr5 </italic>mutations affect trichome morphology. The trichomes on Arabidopsis leaves are specialized single cells that project from the epidermis, and in wild-type they have an unusual branched shape. In addition, wild-type trichomes replicate their DNA without division during development in a process called endoreplication or endoreduplication, reaching nuclear DNA levels of 16C-32C [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Trichomes of <italic>cpr5 </italic>mutants are smaller and less branched than those of wild-type, and have a lower nuclear DNA content [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. This trichome phenotype suggests that, unlike other constitutive pathogen response mutants, <italic>CPR5 </italic>may play a more specific role in trichome development.</p><p>Arabidopsis trichomes are used as a model of plant cell differentiation and cell biology [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>], and the control of early trichome development is well-understood. Initiation of trichome development requires a transcription factor complex consisting of the basic-helix-loop-helix transcription factor GLABRA3 (GL3), the Myb transcription factor GLABRA1 (GL1), and the WD-repeat protein TRANSPARENT TESTA GLABRA (TTG). Mutations in these genes result either in the absence of trichomes, or in reduced numbers of trichomes, and interactions among these proteins have been demonstrated in yeast. The TRIPTYCHON (TRY) protein acts as a negative regulator of trichome development, and is thought to prevent neighboring cells from developing as trichomes by diffusing to neighboring cells via plasmodesmata and inhibiting trichome development in a classic lateral inhibition mechanism. TRY has a Myb DNA-binding domain, but lacks a transcription activation domain, and can bind to GL3 in yeast, suggesting that it directly inhibits function of the GL1/GL3/TTG complex in cells neighboring a developing trichome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>].</p><p>Several mutants affect endoreplication levels in trichomes, and these mutants reveal that nuclear DNA content, trichome size, and trichome branching are highly correlated, with mutants resulting in higher DNA contents generally having trichomes that are larger and more branched [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. Among the genes that control the degree of trichome expansion and endoreplication are the trichome cell fate regulators themselves. Endoreplication is reduced in <italic>gl3 </italic>loss-of-function mutants, and these mutants have smaller trichomes with reduced branching, while <italic>try </italic>mutants have increased levels of trichome endoreplication, and increase trichome size and branching [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. Trichomes of plants containing the gain-of-function <italic>gl3-sst </italic>allele also have large, extra-branched trichomes with enlarged nuclei indicative of an increased DNA content [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. These observations indicate that GL3 is required for continued trichome development beyond initiation, and that TRY acts within developing trichomes to limit the extent of expansion and endoreplication, in addition to its role in preventing neighboring cells from developing as trichomes.</p><p>To gain insight into the function of CPR5, we examined the role of this gene in the context of the well-understood pathway for trichome development. Here, we show that <italic>cpr5 </italic>mutants have altered cell walls with a reduced cellulose content in leaves as well as in trichomes, a previously unrecognized aspect of the phenotype. We also find that <italic>cpr5 </italic>mutations are epistatic to the extra expansion of trichome cells conditioned by either <italic>GL3 </italic>gain-of function and <italic>try </italic>loss-of-function. The <italic>cpr5 </italic>mutations also increase the number of adjacent trichomes formed due to failure of lateral inhibition signaling in <italic>try </italic>mutants. Our work indicates that the pleiotropy of <italic>cpr5 </italic>mutants is due to a primary role for the gene product in a general cellular process such as cell wall biogenesis or integrity that impinges on many cellular pathways, rather than a specific role in pathogen response signaling or senescence.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Mutant phenotype</title><p>Two recessive alleles were used in this study, <italic>cpr5-1 </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>] and <italic>cpr5-2 </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. As described previously by others, the overall size of <italic>cpr5 </italic>mutant plants was smaller than wild-type, cotyledons of <italic>cpr5 </italic>plants senesce sooner than those of wild-type, lesions are present on <italic>cpr5 </italic>rosette leaves, and both leaf epidermal cell size and cell number were greatly reduced in comparison with wild-type [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. For all aspects of the phenotype, <italic>cpr5-1 </italic>plants have a more severe mutant phenotype than <italic>cpr5-2 </italic>mutant plants. The <italic>cpr5-1 </italic>mutation is a missense mutation in the fourth exon (G420D), and the <italic>cpr5-2 </italic>mutation creates a premature stop in the fourth exon at codon 477. Of greatest relevance to this work, trichome branching and size were reduced in plants homozygous for either <italic>cpr5 </italic>allele (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A, B, C</xref>; Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>).

One readily observable property of plant cell walls is the birefringence they exhibit in polarized light due to the presence of paracrystalline cellulose, a major component of plant cell walls. Paracrystalline cellulose contributes to the high degree of birefringence observed in wild-type trichome cell walls [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. This birefringence depends on the orientation of the sample relative to the plane of polarization of the illuminating light.</p><p>We examined wild-type and <italic>cpr5 </italic>trichomes by polarized light microscopy. As expected, wild-type trichomes were highly birefringent, indicated by transmission of light when a trichome branch was oriented appropriately relative to the plane of polarization (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>), whereas <italic>cpr5-1 </italic>trichomes showed little detectable birefringence (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2C</xref>), and <italic>cpr5-2 </italic>trichomes exhibited reduced birefringence (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2E</xref>).

The work presented here identifies a previously unrecognized cell wall defect in <italic>cpr5 </italic>mutants, resulting in a deficit of paracrystalline cellulose. At the same time, the epistasis of the <italic>cpr5 </italic>phenotype in genetic interactions with <italic>try </italic>and <italic>proGL2:GL3 </italic>indicates that <italic>CPR5 </italic>function is necessary for the increased cell expansion and endoreplication conditioned by loss of <italic>TRY </italic>function or by over-expression of <italic>GL3</italic>. These two genes encode transcription factors that play opposing roles in trichome development. Unexpectedly, <italic>cpr5 </italic>mutations also appear to enhance the lateral inhibition signaling defect of <italic>try </italic>mutants that normally prevents trichomes from forming adjacent to one another (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref>).</p><p>It is difficult to reconcile our results with the specific roles that have been proposed by others as the most fundamental function of the <italic>CPR5 </italic>gene product, such as pathogen response signaling or endoreplication and programmed cell death. No other constitutive pathogen response mutants have been reported to affect trichomes, and we have observed no trichome defects on examining <italic>constitutive expressor of pathogenesis-related genes1</italic>, <italic>nonexpressor of PR genes1 </italic>(<italic>npr1</italic>), <italic>accelerated cell death2 </italic>(<italic>acd2</italic>), and <italic>accelerated cell death6 </italic>(<italic>acd6</italic>), and these mutants appeared to have normal birefringent trichome cell walls (J. C. Larkin, unpublished observations). Similarly, <italic>gl3 </italic>loss-of-function mutants, which have reduced endoreplication, produce normally birefringent trichome walls [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>], and trichome walls of plants expressing <italic>proGL2:ICK1/KRP1</italic>, a construct that induces programmed cell death in trichomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>], also appear to be normal (R. Kasili and J. C. Larkin, unpublished observations). It thus seems likely that the <italic>CPR5 </italic>gene product is involved in some general process that is indirectly necessary for trichome cell expansion, pathogen response signaling, and suppressing premature senescence and programmed cell death, rather than being a specialized component of any one of these processes.</p><p>An attractive locus of action for the <italic>CPR5 </italic>gene product suggested by our data is the cell wall itself. The cell wall is directly involved in several processes related to the <italic>cpr5 </italic>mutant phenotype, including both cell expansion and pathogen responses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. Recently, a reduction of the rhamnogalacturonan II component of tobacco cell walls by Virus-induced Gene Silencing (VIGS) of a UDP-D-apiose/UDP-D-xylose synthase gene was shown to result in dwarfing of plants, induction of several pathogen-response genes, production of reactive oxygen species, and cell death [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. A <italic>cev1 </italic>mutant of Arabidopsis, which has a mutation in the <italic>CES3A </italic>cellulose synthase gene, was also shown to result in constitutive expression of pathogen response genes and to have enhanced pathogen resistance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. This mutant was originally identified as an activator of jasmonic acid signaling pathways, and overproduces jasmonic acid and ethylene. Furthermore, a mutation in another cellulose synthase gene, <italic>rsw1</italic>, also results in activation of jasmonic acid signaling, and cellulose biosynthesis inhibitors can mimic the <italic>cev1 </italic>mutant phenotype in wild-type plants, including the activation of pathogen response genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. Jasmonic acid-dependant pathogen response pathways are known to be activated in <italic>cpr5 </italic>mutants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. And, not surprisingly, mutations in cellulose synthase genes can affect cell morphology and expansion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. Indeed, the cell expansion defects seen in <italic>cpr5 </italic>mutants are comparable in severity to those seen in cellulose synthase mutants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]</p><p>Taken together, these results demonstrate that defects in the cell wall itself can lead to many of the specific aspects of the <italic>cpr5 </italic>mutant phenotype, including the constitutive pathogen response signaling for which it is named. One aspect of the phenotype that is less obviously coupled to the cell wall is the reduced endoreplication seen in <italic>cpr5 </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. However, the degree of endoreplication is often strongly correlated with cell size [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>], and it is possible that limitations on cell expansion have a feedback effect on endoreplication.</p><p>An alternative model to explain the extreme pleiotropy of the <italic>cpr5 </italic>mutant phenotype that is the CPR5 protein may be required directly for the function of multiple transcription factors involved in a wide range of distinct processes. Our observation that <italic>cpr5 </italic>is epistatic to the phenotypes conditioned by <italic>try </italic>loss-of-function or <italic>GL3 </italic>overexpression indicates that <italic>CPR5 </italic>function is required for the cell expansion and increased endoreplication conditioned by these two transcription factors. The <italic>CPR5 </italic>gene product is predicted to be a Type IIIa membrane protein with five transmembrane domains and a cytoplasmic N-terminus. This N-terminal domain contains a bipartite nuclear localization sequence (NLS), and it has been proposed that the protein may be involved in a signaling cascade in which the cytoplasmic domain is proteolytically cleaved and transported into the nucleus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>], a signaling process for which there is substantial precedent [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. An alternative is suggested by recent work demonstrating that some membrane proteins in yeast that localize to the inner nuclear membrane are targeted to this membrane via an NLS and use an karyopherin-dependant pathway to enter the nucleus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. In this case, the full-length CPR5 protein might be directly required in the nucleus for function of multiple transcription factors.</p><p>Either of these models, a primary role for CPR5 in cell wall biogenesis or a primary role for CPR<italic>5 </italic>in regulation of nuclear transcription, can provide an explanation for the reduced lateral inhibition (i.e., increased trichome cluster size) seen in the <italic>cpr5 try </italic>double mutants (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">3</xref>). Altered cell wall structure could reduce transmission of the inhibitory signal by reducing intercellular transport of the functionally redundant members of the TRY protein family, CPC, ETC1, and ETC2, perhaps by altering plasmodesmata. Alternatively, if CPR5 is needed for function of the GL3-TTG-GL1 transcriptional activation complex in the nucleus, reduced activity of this complex might result in inefficient upregulation of these TRY homologs in developing trichomes, reducing the degree of inhibition of trichome development in neighboring cells.</p><p>It is obvious that testing these models will require biochemical analysis of localization and function of the CPR5 protein. Perhaps because it is a membrane protein, little progress has been reported on this front, and our own attempts in this regard have not been fruitful. For example, fluorescent protein fusions to the <italic>CPR5 </italic>coding sequence were generated that fully complemented the <italic>cpr5 </italic>mutant phenotype, but no fluorescence was detected in any of the transgenic lines (V. Kirik, unpublished observations). Nevertheless, the work presented here suggests that the cell wall may be a unifying locus for CPR5 function, and will provide guidance for further studies. The important role of <italic>CPR5 </italic>in multiple essential aspects of plant growth and development merits further work to unravel the mechanism of <italic>CPR5 </italic>function.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Plant materials and growth conditions</title><p>Plants were grown under constant illumination as described previously.
