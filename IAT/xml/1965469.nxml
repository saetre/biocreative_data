Beyond the oxygen diffusion limit from a capillary blood vessel, tumor cells become apoptotic. Angiogenesis results from a balance of pro- and anti-angiogenic stimuli. Endogenous inhibitors regulate enzyme activities that promote angiogenesis. Tumor cells may express pro-angiogenic factors and hydrolytic enzymes but also kinin-degrading oligopeptidases which have been investigated.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Angiogenesis induced by B16F10-Nex2 melanoma cells was studied in a co-culture with HUVEC on Matrigel. A stimulating effect on angiogenesis was observed in the presence of B16F10-Nex2 lysate and plasma membrane. In contrast, the B16F10-Nex2 culture supernatant inhibited angiogenesis in a dose-dependent manner. This effect was abolished by the endo-oligopeptidase inhibitor, JA-2. Thimet oligopeptidase (TOP) and neurolysin activities were then investigated in B16F10-Nex2 melanoma cells aiming at gene sequencing, enzyme distribution and activity, influence on tumor development, substrate specificity, hydrolytic products and susceptibility to inhibitors. Fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) peptides as well as neurotensin and bradykinin were used as substrates. The hydrolytic activities in B16F10-Nex2 culture supernatant were totally inhibited by <italic>o</italic>-phenanthrolin, JA-2 and partially by Pro-Ile. Leupeptin, PMSF, E-64, Z-Pro-Prolinal and captopril failed to inhibit these hydrolytic activities. Genes encoding M3A enzymes in melanoma cells were cloned and sequenced being highly similar to mouse genes. A decreased proliferation of B16F10-Nex2 cells was observed in vitro with specific inhibitors of these oligopeptidases. Active rTOP but not the inactive protein inhibited melanoma cell development in vivo increasing significantly the survival of mice challenged with the tumor cells. On Matrigel, rTOP inhibited the bradykinin &#x02013; induced angiogenesis. A possible regulation of the homologous tumor enzyme in the perivascular microenvironment is suggested based on the observed rTOP inhibition by an S-nitrosothiol NO donor.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Data show that melanoma cells secrete endo-oligopeptidases which have an important role in tumor proliferation in vitro and in vivo. rTOP inhibited growth of subcutaneously injected B16F10-Nex2 cells in mice. TOP from tumor cells and bradykinin in endothelial cells are two antagonist factors that may control angiogenesis essential for melanoma growth. A regulatory role of NO or S-nitrosothiols is suggested.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>Angiogenesis is a fundamental process in tumor growth, providing nutrients and oxygen to the tumor cells. This complex process involves extensive interplay between cells, soluble factors and ECM components. Among the soluble factors, secreted peptidases by tumor and neighbor cells can have a significant role in both tumor development and angiogenesis. Tumor cells express many different types of proteases that are associated with tumor invasibility [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Considering the various specificities of secreted and membrane-bound hydrolytic enzymes in the invasive melanoma a diversity of products can be generated. Peptide fragments can stimulate tumor cells to produce oligo-, amino- and carboxipeptidases for further degradation giving rise either to biologically active peptides (growth factors, regulators or signalling ligands), or to substrates accessible to be used as nitrogen source.</p><p>Presently, we describe the stimulating effect of B16F10-Nex2 melanoma cells on endothelial cells in a co-culture model of angiogenesis on Matrigel in vitro. In contrast, an inhibitory effect of melanoma cell culture supernatant was observed. The agents responsible for these effects were investigated.</p><p>We detected the expression of oligopeptidases in murine melanoma cells of high invasiveness. The homologous mammalian enzymes of the M3A subfamily are generally found in different tissues and cellular compartments. They are neurolysin (EC 3.4.24.16) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>] and thimet oligopeptidase (TOP, EC 3.4.24.15) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>], exhibiting similar substrate specificities and possessing a highly conserved HEFGH metal binding motif [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. They were originally described as having 60% sequence identity, and distribution in the cytosol, endoplasmic reticulum, mitochondria and nucleus of different mammalian tissues and tumor cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. Membrane-associated forms of these enzymes have been described in corticotrophic tumor cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>], neuronal cell lines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>] and neurons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>] and the secreted forms in neuronal cell line [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>] cultures.</p><p>Both peptidases are known to hydrolyze in vitro various bioactive peptides, including bradykinin (BK) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>], and numerous reports have linked the enzymes to the metabolism of these peptides in vivo [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. BK, generated through the action of kallikreins on a precursor kininogen substrate, induces inflammation, increased vascular permeability, stimulation of the endothelial isoform of nitric oxide (NO) synthase, and vasodilation. Pathological conditions, such as myocardial ischemia, hypertension and cancer are deeply influenced by the kallikrein/kininogen/kinin system. Evidence suggests that part of the cardioprotective effects of specific inhibitors of the angiotensin I-converting enzyme (ACE) and neutral endopeptidase (NEP) is due to the enhanced BK activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. Schriefer et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>] demonstrated that inhibition of TOP precludes degradation of endogenous BK and provides long-lasting protection from myocardial ischemia/reperfusion injury. TOP and neurolysin also contribute to BK metabolism in the blood vessels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>].</p><p>The BK role on tumor-associated angiogenesis and tumor growth has already been addressed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. BK stimulates angiogenesis in a sponge granuloma model, synergistically with interleukin-1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. BK has been implicated in the enhancement of tumor growth via increased permeability of the tumor neo-vasculature [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. Tumor growth and development of tumor-associated angiogenesis are suppressed in kininogen-deficient rats [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. These evidences suggest that BK is a primary mediator of tumor angiogenesis and, consequently, of tumor growth.</p><p>In the present work, we have characterized TOP and neurolysin activities in conditioned media, lysate and membrane preparations of B16F10-Nex2 melanoma cells. Furthermore, we used in vivo experiments and in vitro Matrigel angiogenesis assay, to determine the role of oligopeptidases released by B16F10-Nex2 melanoma cells on tumor growth and BK-dependent angiogenesis. We suggest that locally produced NO could play a role in the regulation of anti-kinin TOP activity.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Mice and cell lineages</title><p>Six- to eight-week-old female C57BL/6 mice were obtained from the Center for Development of Experimental Models (CEDEME) animal facility, Federal University of S&#x000e3;o Paulo (UNIFESP), and kept in isolators, with autoclaved water and food. The animal experiments were carried out in accordance with the UNIFESP Ethics Committee for Animal Experimentation.</p><p>The B16F10 murine melanoma cell line is syngeneic in C57Bl/6 mice and was originally obtained from the Ludwig Institute for Cancer Research (S&#x000e3;o Paulo Branch). At the Experimental Oncology Unit (UNONEX), we isolated sublines from the original cell line with different phenotypes. The melanotic subline Nex2 (B16F10-Nex2) is characterized by low immunogenicity and moderate virulence. It forms lethal subcutaneous tumours, with no metastasis to the lung unless injected intravenously. The melanoma cells and human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) were maintained in complete medium consisting of RPMI 1640, pH 7.2, supplemented with 10 mM N-2-hydroxyethylpiperazine-N'-2-ethanesulphonic acid (HEPES), 24 mM sodium bicarbonate, 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum (FCS) from Gibco (Minneapolis, MN, USA) and 40 &#x003bc;g/mL gentamicin sulfate (Hipolabor Farmac&#x000ea;utica, Sabar&#x000e1;, MG, Brazil).</p></sec><sec><title>Tumor cells growth and processing</title><p>B16F10-Nex2 cells were grown in 75-cm<sup>3 </sup>flasks (Costar Corning, NY, USA) until 80&#x02013;90% confluence.

Membranes were incubated for 1 h in PBS and 5% dry skim milk. The anti-TOP and anti-neurolysin antibodies (Proteimax, S&#x000e3;o Paulo, Brazil) at 1:1000 were used as the primary antibody, and the secondary antibody was horse-radish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit antibody in PBS and 1% dry skim milk. The blot was visualized using the ECL detection system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech).</p></sec><sec><title>In vitro angiogenesis assay on Matrigel</title><p>BD Matrigel&#x02122; Matrix (B&#x00026;D Biosciences, Bedford, MA, USA) was thawed on ice and then 15 &#x003bc;L per well was distributed in 96-well plates, and allowed to polymerize for 1 h at 37&#x000b0;C. HUVEC cells (5 &#x000d7; 10<sup>3 </sup>cells/well) suspended in 100 &#x003bc;L of RPMI medium supplemented with 0.2% of FCS were added to each well in the presence of the following inducers or inhibitors, isolated or combined: BK (1 &#x003bc;M), B16F10-Nex2 supernatant, membrane preparation or lysate, rTOP (specific activity: 231 &#x003bc;M/min/mg protein), JA-2 (5 &#x003bc;M), NT (1 &#x003bc;M), Angiotensin-II (1 &#x003bc;M) or CA-074 (100 nM). In the co-culture model consisting of HUVEC cells and irradiated B16F10-Nex2 cells (5 &#x000d7; 10<sup>3 </sup>cells/well), the tumor and endothelial cells were added together to Matrigel after polymerization. The co-culture assay was standardized with live irradiated melanoma cells to prevent tumor growth.</p><p>The plates were incubated at 37&#x000b0;C for 18 h and then images were captured at 8&#x000d7; magnification with a Sony Cyber-shot camera coupled to a light inverted microscope. The number of angiogenic structures (closed rings) was counted from 4 different wells, and the average value was determined for each sample. As a control of the assay HUVEC cells were plated on Matrigel without any addition.</p></sec><sec><title>Peptides</title><p>FRET peptides derived from neurotensin (NT) and bradykinin (BK) were synthesized by the solid phase and classical solution methods of peptide synthesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>] using <italic>o</italic>-aminobenzoic acid (Abz) as fluorescent group and ethylenediamino-2,4-dinitrophenyl (EDDnp) as fluorescence quencher, attached respectively to the N- and C-terminal groups of the peptides.

The 1-cm-path-length cuvette containing 1 ml of the substrate solution was placed in a thermostatically controlled cell compartment for 5 min before the samples were added and the increase in fluorescence with time was continuously recorded for 5&#x02013;10 min. The readings were converted into moles of hydrolyzed substrate per minute based on the fluorescence curves of standard peptide solutions before and after total enzymatic hydrolysis. The concentration of the peptide solutions was obtained by colorimetric determination of the 2, 4-dinitrophenyl group (17,300 M<sup>-1</sup>.cm<sup>-1 </sup>extinction coefficient at 365 nm). The sample concentration for initial rate determination was chosen at a hydrolysis level less than 5% the substrate present.

The growth of HUVECs on Matrigel with 0.2% fetal calf serum led to the formation of closed intercellular compartments arising from endothelial cell sprouting (pro-angiogenic structure) independent of any other factor. Addition of BK to the incubation mixture at 1 &#x003bc;M stimulated formation of these structures more than 2-fold. The co-culture of irradiated melanoma and endothelial cells increased the number of pro-angiogenic structures to the same level as in BK-treated HUVECs. The same occurred with the B16F10-Nex2 membrane preparation and lysate. In contrast, B16F10-Nex2 supernatant exerts a clear negative effect on angiogenesis compared to the control.</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Effect of BK and B16F10-Nex2 tumor cells on pro-angiogenic closed structures formed by sprouting of endothelial cells</bold>.

Addition of 1, 4-dithiothreitol (DTT) in the assay before the fluorogenic substrate prevented TOP inhibition by SNAP.</p><table-wrap position="float" id="T4"><label>Table 4</label><caption><p>Effect of the NO donor SNAP on the hydrolysis of Abz-GFSPFRQ-EDDnp by rTOP</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><td align="left"><bold>SNAP</bold></td><td align="center"><bold>Hydrolysis (%)</bold><sup>1</sup></td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left">Control (no inhibitor)</td><td align="center">100</td></tr><tr><td align="left">1 mM</td><td align="center">38 &#x000b1; 3</td></tr><tr><td align="left">500 &#x003bc;M</td><td align="center">50 &#x000b1; 3</td></tr><tr><td align="left">250 &#x003bc;M</td><td align="center">83 &#x000b1; 4</td></tr><tr><td align="left">100 &#x003bc;M</td><td align="center">98 &#x000b1; 2</td></tr><tr><td align="left">1 mM + DTT 0.5 mM</td><td align="center">100 &#x000b1; 1</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><p><sup>1</sup>100% hydrolysis represents the cleavage of 20 &#x003bc;M of Abz-GFSPFRQ-EDDnp by rTOP during 5 min at 37&#x000b0;C in 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4.</p></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap></sec></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>We describe in the present work the stimulating effect on angiogenesis of irradiated melanoma B16F10-Nex2 tumor cells using HUVEC on Matrigel substrate. A melanoma cell lysate and membrane preparation showed the same effect of whole irradiated tumor cells, suggesting a distribution of pro-angiogenic factors in both membrane and cytoplasm of the tumor cells. In contrast, B16F10-Nex2 conditioned medium inhibited endothelial cell sprouting and the formation of pro-angiogenic structures. The negative effect on angiogenesis was reversed by the thimet oligopeptidase inhibitor JA-2, suggesting the anti-angiogenic role of this or a similar secreted oligopeptidase into the melanoma culture supernatant.</p><p>The presence of TOP and neurolysin in melanoma cells and culture supernatants was confirmed by hydrolytic assays and by cloning and sequencing the corresponding cDNAs from B16F10-Nex2 cells. The hydrolysis of NT, BK and FRET peptides were consistent with the presence of Zn-dependent oligopeptidases with a catalytic activity similar to that of both TOP and neurolysin. In addition, the enzymes of the melanoma supernatant hydrolyzed the substrate Abz-GFSPFRQ-EDDnp at the Pro-Phe bond as described for TOP and neurolysin, indicating that the melanoma activity had the same specificity as of the recombinant mouse enzymes (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3D</xref>).</p><p>The complete inhibition of melanoma peptidase by <italic>o</italic>-phenanthrolin as well as by JA-2, and the partial inhibition by Pro-Ile give support to the functional similarity of melanoma enzymes with the oligopeptidases TOP and neurolysin. The absence of inhibition of peptidase activity by PMSF, E-64, Z-Pro-Prolinal, leupeptin and captopril excludes the presence of other peptidase classes eventually responsible for the cleavage of Abz-GFSPFRQ-EDDnp, the substrate used in these assays. The generation of NT<sub>9&#x02013;13 </sub>and NT<sub>10&#x02013;13 </sub>in the presence of bestatin suggested that an aminopeptidase was the most likely enzyme responsible for degradation of the C-terminal fragment of NT.</p><p>The cDNA sequencing of melanoma enzymes showed few mutations in comparison with the mouse counterparts. The only modification found in the melanoma TOP gene sequence did not cause an alteration in the amino acid sequence. The melanoma neurolysin gene showed three modifications in relation to mouse gene sequence, but only two changes promoted substitutions in the amino acid sequence away from the conserved Zn-binding catalytic site (HEFGH) or from other amino acids described as important to enzyme activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>].</p><p>We show here that significant TOP and neurolysin-like activities can be detected in conditioned media, lysate and membrane preparations from melanoma cells. The oligopeptidase activity per cell was 10-fold greater in the lysate than supernatant. The activity in the cell membrane preparation was scarce. When the assay was normalized by specific activity, the supernatant and lysate values were similar, since the protein content in the lysate is approximately 4-fold that in the supernatant. Using specific antibodies against the studied oligopeptidases, we showed that TOP activity in melanoma cells is significantly greater than that of neurolysin. TOP expression as detected by immunoblotting was prominent in the supernatant, lysate and membrane fraction of B16F10-Nex2 cells.</p><p>The importance of the oligopeptidases for melanoma cells in vitro was assessed by proliferation assay in the presence of JA-2 and bestatin. We observed a decreased B16F10-Nex2 cell proliferation in the presence of JA-2, bestatin and a greater inhibition with both. Presumably both inhibitors may act intracellularly, inhibiting oligopeptidases and aminopeptidases that are essential for melanoma cells. The secretion of both enzymes, TOP and neurolysin, might, however, influence tumor growth in vivo by affecting angiogenesis. Mice injected with active rTOP at a concentration that was not toxic in vitro, showed a delay in tumor development and increased survival of animals compared with mice challenged with tumor cells and inactive rTOP, indicating that the active enzyme and not only the protein was necessary for this effect. A possible target of rTOP activity in the tumor microenvironment could be kinins stimulating angiogenesis.</p><p>Tumors require an adequate supply of oxygen, metabolites and an effective way to remove waste products [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>]. The generation of new blood vessels for tumor blood supply is thus a rate-limiting step in tumor progression, being a prerequisite for the rapid clonal expansion associated with the formation of macroscopic tumors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>]. Experimental data suggest that the angiogenic stimulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>] is activated during the early stages of tumour development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>]. During development of cutaneous melanoma in humans a similar stage-specific stimulation is also evident [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>]. Tumors appear to activate the angiogenic switch by changing the balance of angiogenesis inducers and counteracting inhibitors, so that tumor neovascularization and consequent growth depends on how heavily the balance tips towards angiogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">53</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">54</xref>]. One strategy for shifting the balance involves proteases that can control the bioavailability of angiogenic activators and inhibitors.</p><p>A prototype of pro-angiogenic molecule is bradykinin. Evidence suggests that BK may be one of the primary mediators responsible for tumor angiogenesis and, consequently, of tumor growth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. It is well known that endothelial cells can synthesize and secrete tissue kallikrein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B55">55</xref>]. Schmaier et al [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B56">56</xref>] have also shown the expression of high molecular weight kininogen in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC). The generation of the vasoactive peptide bradykinin from HUVEC-bound high molecular weight kininogen is also known [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B57">57</xref>]. Therefore, endothelial cells, particularly those used in the present study (HUVEC) do produce kininogen and kallikrein and generate BK. Such functional activities of endothelial cells are stimulated in Matrigel. The inhibitory effect of active rTOP inoculated with tumor cells, could well involve the hydrolysis of bradykinin, shifting the balance of angiogenic/anti-antiangiogenic factors at an early stage of tumor implantation. In agreement with this we have shown in an angiogenesis assay with HUVEC on Matrigel that rTOP was able to reverse the angiogenic stimulation promoted by BK. Similarly to BK, NT and A-II, two peptides that are hydrolyzed by TOP, were able to stimulate the endothelial cell sprouting. These peptides are further examples of positive modulators of the angiogenic process.</p><p>The results suggest that TOP affects angiogenesis in vitro and in vivo, at concentrations that did not inhibit B16F10-Nex2 tumor cells directly. The secretion of TOP by tumor cells would therefore favor an anti-angiogenic response in balance with the pro-angiogenic stimuli by other tumor proteases expressed for instance at the cell surface and released in the medium. We incubated HUVEC cells with CA-074, a cathepsin B inhibitor, in the Matrigel angiogenesis assay and showed stimulation of angiogenesis. The same inhibitor enhanced the pro-angiogenic effect induced by B16F10-Nex2 lysate, tumor cell membrane, and in the co-culture of B16F10-Nex2 with HUVEC cells (data not shown). References to the role of cathepsin B on tumor angiogenesis are contradictory. In human tumors, there is evidence of a positive correlation between the level of cathepsin B and angiogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B58">58</xref>], and the inhibition of cathepsin B expression was associated with angiogenesis suppression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B59">59</xref>]. In contrast, the generation of endostatin by cathepsin B could block the angiogenesis in many tumor systems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B60">60</xref>]. The role of cathepsins in melanoma requires additional studies in face of the multienzymatic complex of the tumor microenvironment. Clearly, in the in vitro Matrigel invasion assays, cathepsins B and L increase the angiogenesis-independent invasive capacity of tumor cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B61">61</xref>]. We described a more invasive B16F10 clone (Nex2B) as compared to a less invasive one (2D), though with a greater capacity of lung colonization than 2B, based on the extracellular rather than intracellular accumulation of cathepsins B, D, and L [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Nevertheless, an intracellular role for cathepsin B in matrix degradation has been identified [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B62">62</xref>], and also, three forms of extracellularly active cathepsin B and two forms of active cathepsin L have been described in the highly invasive melanoma cell line MV3 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B63">63</xref>]. These isoforms add to the complexity of the system and demand a careful study to unravel their role on tumor growth.</p><p>An additional control of angiogenesis and tumor growth may exist based on the local release of NO. Kashiwagi et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B64">64</xref>] using intravital microscopy demonstrated in a B16 murine melanoma model that eNOS from vascular endothelial cells is the predominant generator of NO. NO released by endothelial cells could be an inhibitory ligand of TOP activity. The inhibition of enzymes by nitric oxide has been demonstrated in the cysteine proteases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B65">65</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B67">67</xref>], but not metallo-proteases. TOP and dipeptidylpeptidase IV (DPP IV) were not inhibited by the NO donors sodium nitroprusside(SNP) and 3-morpholinosydnoimine (SIN-1) in the 1&#x02013;100 &#x003bc;M range [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B68">68</xref>]. Both compounds, however, were shown to release peroxynitrite, a reactive nitrogen species that primarily can nitrate tyrosine residues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B69">69</xref>]. Site-directed mutation of Tyr residues at positions 612 and 613 in TOP and neurolysin, respectively, strongly reduced <italic>k</italic><sub><italic>cat</italic></sub>/<italic>K</italic><sub><italic>M </italic></sub>for both enzymes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B70">70</xref>].</p><p>Nitrosothiols, which may act as NO reservoirs, could nitrosate cysteine residues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B71">71</xref>], such as those that play an important role in TOP activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B72">72</xref>]. Presently, we exposed rTOP to SNAP a nitrosothiol, and the activity of the enzyme was inhibited in a concentration-dependent manner (250 &#x003bc;M to 1 mM range). Such inhibition was abolished in the presence of DTT. This result should be considered in the perspective of a tumor microenvironment with hydrophobic niches that may increase the efficiency of NO-based regulatory reactions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B73">73</xref>], potentially influencing angiogenesis and tumor growth.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>The present work describes TOP and neurolysin oligopeptidases in B16F10-Nex2 melanoma cells and shows the importance of these enzymes for tumor proliferation in vitro and in vivo. Recombinant TOP protected mice against the subcutaneous challenge with murine melanoma cells. The results suggest that secreted thimet oligopeptidase in tumor cells and bradykinin are two antagonist factors that may regulate or trigger the angiogenic switch essential for melanoma growth. A regulatory role of NO or S-nitrosothiols on TOP activity is suggested. Together with endogenous inhibitors, endo-oligopeptidases secreted by tumor cells can also regulate angiogenesis and might also be studied, in adequate protocols, as potential anti-tumor agents.</p></sec><sec><title>Abbreviations</title><p>TOP or EC 24.15, metallo-endopeptidase EC 3.4.24.15; EC 24.16, metallo-endopeptidase EC 3.4.24.16; rTOP, recombinant thimet oligopeptidase; FRET, fluorescence resonance energy transfer; HUVEC, human vein endothelial cell; FCS, fetal calf serum; NT, neurotensin; BK, bradykinin; A-II, angiotensin II; JA-2, N-[1(R,S)-carboxy-3-phenylpropyl]-Ala-Aib-Tyr-<italic>p</italic>-aminobenzoate; IPTG, isopropyl &#x003b2;-D-thiogalactoside; Abz, <italic>o</italic>-aminobenzoic acid; EDDnp, ethylenediamine-2,4-dinitrophenyl; E-64, <italic>trans</italic>-epoxysuccinyl-L-leucylamido-(4-guanido)butene; SNAP, S-nitroso-N-acetylpenicillamine; DTT, 1,4-dithiothreitol.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The author(s) declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>TP designed and performed all biochemical and cell biological experiments, carried out data analysis and drafted and conceived the manuscript.
