Therefore, a genetic screen was employed in the nematode <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> that identified the Elongator complex as a possible regulator of &#x003b1;-tubulin acetylation. Detailed characterization of mutant animals revealed that the acetyltransferase activity of the Elongator is indeed required for correct acetylation of microtubules and for neuronal development. Moreover, the velocity of vesicles on microtubules was affected by mutations in Elongator. Elongator mutants also displayed defects in neurotransmitter levels. Furthermore, acetylation of &#x003b1;-tubulin was shown to act as a novel signal for the fine-tuning of microtubules dynamics by modulating &#x003b1;-tubulin turnover, which in turn affected neuronal shape. Given that mutations in the acetyltransferase subunit of the Elongator (Elp3) and in a scaffold subunit (Elp1) have previously been linked to human neurodegenerative diseases, namely Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis and Familial Dysautonomia respectively highlights the importance of this work and offers new insights to understand their etiology.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><p>We were able to demonstrate how a screen, that utilized the nematode model organism <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic>, yielded the novel discovery that the Elongator protein complex is critical for neuronal development and microtubule acetylation. Other scientists have previously shown that the Elongator is important for transcription, but also hypothesized that a hitherto unknown function within the cytoplasm prevails. Regulation of microtubule acetylation is indeed important for cellular function. Our results provide the first tantalizing insights of how worms display neuronal phenotypes that may be linked to changes in degrees of acetylation of microtubules. We also point out that the Elongator itself has a defined acetyltransferase function that could well be directly responsible for the acetylation of &#x003b1;-tubulin. In conclusion, we discuss how the regulation of microtubule acetylation might impact on the understanding of human neurodegenerative diseases, namely Familial Dysautonomia and Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="19"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Microtubules (MTs) are polymers of &#x003b1;/&#x003b2;-tubulin heterodimers that associate head-to-tail and laterally to form hollow tubes. MTs are usually highly dynamic and undergo rapid turnover by exchange of subunits where the ends of MTs undergo transitions between growth and shrinkage.

An example of a PTM is the acetylation of &#x003b1;-tubulin on a lysine residue at position 40.

This assay was designed to uncover possible effects of the drug during development, e.g. commissure formation defects that persist from L1 to adulthood (since the worms developed through all stages in the presence of the drug). In wt, movement was impaired by nocodazole in a linear dose dependent manner. <italic>elpc-1</italic> and to a lesser extent <italic>elpc-3</italic> mutants were both more resistant to nocodazole treatment with no additive effect seen in the double mutant <italic>elpc-1</italic>; <italic>elpc-3</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000820-g007">Figure 7D</xref>). Compared to <italic>mig-2(gf)</italic>, the suppression of <italic>mig-2(gf)</italic> by single or double <italic>elongator</italic> mutants resulted in an increased resistance to nocodazole (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000820-g007">Figure 7D</xref>). To gain an insight into whether the observed nocodazole resistance in <italic>elongator</italic> mutants is neuron specific or due to a broader effect, <italic>elpc-1</italic> was re-introduced under the control of a neuron specific promoter into <italic>elpc-1</italic> mutant worms. The resistance to nocodazole was abolished and essentially wt, suggesting that this phenotype of <italic>elpc-1</italic> is neuron specific (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000820-g007">Figure 7D</xref>).</p><p>If stabilization of MTs is fundamental for the suppression of <italic>mig-2(gf)</italic> by <italic>elongator</italic> mutants (as suggested by the nocodazole experiment) then MT stabilization by taxol should have a similar effect. In turn, <italic>elongator</italic> mutants may be expected to have an increased sensitivity towards taxol. Indeed, exposure to taxol suppressed the movement phenotype in <italic>mig-2(gf)</italic>, an effect that was dependent on <italic>mec-12/&#x003b1;-tubulin</italic>. In contrast, <italic>elongator</italic> mutants by themselves displayed an increased sensitivity to high concentrations of taxol (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000820-g007">Figure 7E</xref>). In conclusion, these experiments show that <italic>elongator</italic> fine-tunes the amount of MEC-12/&#x003b1;-tubulin protein, which in turn may regulate the sensitivity of MTs to depolymerizing and stabilizating drugs revealing a change in their dynamic properties.</p></sec><sec id="s2k"><title>Regulation of microtubule structure in <italic>elongator</italic> mutants</title><p>Resistance to nocodazole in <italic>elpc-1(lf)</italic> may arise due to MTs being stabilized by MT associated proteins. However this is unlikely, as the comparative expression analysis of wt and <italic>elpc-1</italic> mutants by DNA microarray technology yielded no MT associated proteins (data not shown). Alternatively, MTs number or length may be increased, a notion that was addressed by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). An ideal target for investigation proved to be the ALM neuron because firstly, it has an unusually high number of special MTs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000820-g008">Figure 8A</xref>) and secondly, MEC-12/&#x003b1;-tubulin is highly expressed <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000820-Fukushige1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000820-Chalfie1">&#x0005b;47&#x0005d;</xref>). In randomly selected TEM sections, the overall number of MTs was indistinguishable in wt and <italic>mig-2(gf)</italic> but significantly increased in <italic>elpc-1(lf)</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000820-g008">Figure 8A and 8B</xref>). This was confirmed in serial sections (in 3.2 &#x000b5;m increments) of single wt and <italic>elpc-1(lf)</italic> mutant worms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000820-g008">Figure 8C</xref>). The identified variation in MT number along the axon was fed into a mathematical model (see Experimental Procedures for details) which suggested that, the difference identified in <italic>elpc-1(lf)</italic> may be also the result of MTs being longer rather than solely based on an increase of MT number (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000820.s005">Figure S5B</xref>). This is, as said above, further supported by the fact that the DNA microarray data could not pinpoint MT nucleation factors (e.g. &#x003b3;-tubulin) in <italic>elpc-1(lf)</italic> that are instrumental for the increase in MT numbers. In summary, this provides at least circumstantial evidence that an increase in MTs number is unlikely (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000820-g008">Figure 8A&#x02013;8C</xref>).</p><p>If increasing the amount of MEC-12/&#x003b1;-tubulin causes longer MTs and subsequently suppresses <italic>mig-2(gf)</italic> movement defects, any alternative means that increases MEC-12/&#x003b1;-tubulin levels should be able to replicate these observations. Treatment with lactacystin, a potent and specific inhibitor of the proteasome used in <italic>C. elegans</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000820-Ding1">&#x0005b;48&#x0005d;</xref>, imposed no movement effect on wt animals, but was able to partially suppress the movement phenotype of <italic>mig-2(gf)</italic> at 15 &#x000b5;M (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000820-g008">Figure 8D</xref>). As mentioned before, the treatment was continuous during development of the worms, thereby ensuring that defects during early larval stages impose effects on locomotion at young adult stage. Moreover, the suppression was dependent on MEC-12/&#x003b1;-tubulin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000820-g008">Figure 8D</xref>), thus (re)confirming the taxol data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000820-g007">Figure 7E</xref>). Interestingly, compared to wt, <italic>mec-12/&#x003b1;-tubulin</italic> and <italic>elongator</italic> mutants were all sensitive to high concentrations of lactacystin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000820-g008">Figure 8D</xref>). In both cases high levels of lactacystin are predicted to impair MT function, where accumulation of a mutated MEC-12/&#x003b1;-tubulin and &#x0201c;overstabilized&#x0201d; MTs in <italic>elongator</italic> mutants alter MT function; findings that are analogous to the taxol experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000820-g007">Figure 7E</xref>).</p><p>Ubiquitin mediated proteolysis is the key player in the control of cytoplasmic protein turnover. To investigate whether impaired proteasomal proteolysis of &#x003b1;-tubulin might be linked to the phenotypes observed in <italic>elongator</italic> mutants, immunoprecipitated &#x003b1;-tubulin from different genetic backgrounds was probed with an anti ubiquitin antibody (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000820-g008">Figure 8E</xref>). The ubiquitination level was higher in <italic>elpc-3</italic> mutants compared to worms with an <italic>elpc-1</italic> background. Interestingly, this observation parallels the strong effects on acetylation levels in <italic>elpc-3</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000820-g002">Figure 2B</xref>). These differences in post-translational modification are possibly due to the fact that ELPC-3 is the catalytic subunit of the elongator complex. This experiment demonstrated that &#x003b1;-tubulin is strongly modified by endogenous ubiquitin in <italic>elongator</italic> mutants. We conclude that <italic>elongator</italic> is a critical factor for &#x003b1;-tubulin turnover.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Discussion</title><sec id="s3a"><title><italic>elongator</italic> regulates &#x003b1;-tubulin acetylation</title><p>The results presented here demonstrate how a genetic animal model can be used to study acetylation of MTs. In detail, it was possible to corroborate that <italic>mig-2</italic> regulates &#x003b1;-tubulin acetylation and ascertain that the <italic>elongator</italic> is a new regulator of &#x003b1;-tubulin acetylation. Recently, Creppe and colleagues showed that elongator is involved in this process in mouse cortical neurons <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000820-Creppe1">&#x0005b;36&#x0005d;</xref>. Their data confirm the hypothesis, presented here, namely that elongator activity regulates &#x003b1;-tubulin function. In our work, regulation of acetylation by the <italic>elongator</italic> was shown to be strong in early stages of development and acetylation of &#x003b1;-tubulin lower, but nevertheless still present, in late stages of <italic>elongator</italic> mutants. The fact that <italic>elongator</italic> also regulates other processes and that some acetylation remains in the absence of <italic>elongator</italic> suggests the presence of some degree of redundancy. It should be noted that during embryonic development and early larval stages numerous neurons undergo dramatic morphological change and in consequence, a tight control of acetylation by <italic>elongator</italic> has a deep impact on neuronal structure during development. This notion is discussed below.</p></sec><sec id="s3b"><title>Regulation of MT acetylation and neuronal shape</title><p>Gain of function alleles of the Rac-like GTPase <italic>mig-2</italic> display defects in neuronal shape due to the hyperacetylation of &#x003b1;-tubulin. The defects are partially suppressed (although not fully) when acetylation is reduced either by overexpression of HDAC-6, the &#x003b1;-tubulin deacetylase, or by knocking out the <italic>elongator</italic>. This implies that <italic>mig-2</italic> modulates other pathways as well. For example <italic>mig-2</italic> is also involved in actin dynamics to regulate neuronal shape and axon pathfinding <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000820-Shakir1">&#x0005b;49&#x0005d;</xref>. But if acetylation of MTs is regarded as a distinct fact, how can acetylation of MTs affect cell shape? It has been shown in fibroblasts and neurons that Rac GTPases regulate MT dynamics by different mechanisms. One of those is the recruitment of &#x0002b;TIPs such as APC and EB1 to promote stabilization via Rac effector mDia <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000820-Watanabe1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>. The same &#x0002b;TIPs are proposed to act in the linkers between actin cortex and the protruding MTs in the growth cone of neurons <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000820-Witte1">&#x0005b;50&#x0005d;</xref>. Although acetylation of MTs seems to be secondary to stabilization <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000820-Verhey1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>, it has not been excluded that RacGTPases may actively regulate acetylation.</p><p>If &#x003b1;-tubulin is hyperacetylated, as in the Rac gain of function mutants, the cellular consequences are twofold: firstly, neurons fail to project their axons correctly and secondly neuronal migration is, at least in some cases, downregulated. The discovery that acetylation affects &#x003b1;-tubulin levels by regulating its turnover is important, since the dynamics of MT may also be altered in a system where &#x003b1;-tubulin is &#x0201c;hyperacetylated&#x0201d;. This may be the result of MTs being too short or prone to depolymerization. Whilst a regulation in number of MT cross-sections was not seen in the <italic>mig-2(gf)</italic> mutant, it was possible to suppress its phenotypes by either raising the stability of the MTs with taxol or by mimicking an &#x003b1;-tubulin accumulation by blocking the proteasome. This supports the hypothesis that the regulation of &#x003b1;-tubulin levels affects the dynamics of MTs. In contrast, if acetylation is reduced, as seen in the <italic>elpc-1</italic> mutants, then the length of MTs was probably increased. This evidence was supported by the observed resistance to the depolymerizing drug nocodazole and the increased sensitivity to taxol and proteasome inhibitor. In addition, a significant change in neuron shape was seen in <italic>elongator</italic> mutants. Altogether, the results advocate that the formation of stable MTs requires the fine-tuning of &#x003b1;-tubulin levels. Moreover, since Rac GTPases are upstream of these effects, it is possible that they contribute to the coordination of multiple events that lead to changes in cell shape, namely: a) actin cytoskeleton dynamics, b) stabilization of MT ends and c) fine-tuning of MT dynamics via regulation of &#x003b1;-tubulin turnover.</p><p>A further aspect is that axons of <italic>mig-2(gf)</italic> mutants do not only elongate less, but also show misguidance phenotypes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000820-Lundquist1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>. Since acetylation of &#x003b1;-tubulin affects vesicle loading and transport, it is conceivable that extracellular axon guidance cues might be deregulated by transport problems due to incorrect acetylation of MTs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000820-Verhey1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>. Recently it has been shown that <italic>mig-2</italic> and <italic>vab-8</italic> (kinesin-like motor protein) are required to regulate the correct subcellular localization of UNC-40 (a homolog of the netrin receptor) which specifies cell polarity of neurons <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000820-LevyStrumpf1">&#x0005b;51&#x0005d;</xref>. In addition, the authors showed that UNC-40 was mislocalized in a <italic>mig-2</italic> gain of function mutant. Of course MTs were hyperacetylated in that background, as shown by the results presented here. This leads to the assumption that UNC-40 was in fact mislocalized due to the improper loading and/or velocity of VAB-8 dependent vesicles. A more direct involvement of elongator complex in the regulation of intracellular trafficking that is critical for cell shape remodeling during migration and terminal branching of mouse cortical neurons (corticogenesis) has recently been shown <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000820-Creppe1">&#x0005b;36&#x0005d;</xref>. In summary, this adds further evidence that acetylation may affect neuronal shapes by regulating a) the dynamics of MTs and their propensity to be stabilized via the turnover of &#x003b1;-tubulin and b) the loading and transport of vesicles (and their cargo).</p></sec><sec id="s3c"><title>Stability and function of microtubules</title><p>The <italic>elongator</italic> mutants were shown to be resistant to the MT depolymerizing drug nocodazole. Based on this alone, one may conclude that MTs are more stable in <italic>elongator</italic> mutants, however further experiments showed that the resulting increase of &#x003b1;-tubulin levels also altered the dynamics of MTs. This can be confused with the notion that the &#x0201c;stability&#x0201d; of MTs requires an involvement of active stabilizing factors (such as &#x0002b;TIPs) which in the end change the half life of MTs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000820-Verhey1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000820-Witte1">&#x0005b;50&#x0005d;</xref>.

Indeed, the experiments presented here confirm this point of view, and in addition allow a re-interpretation, namely that their findings are likely a result of the &#x003b1;-tubulin pool being regulated and not due to the direct regulation of MT stability.</p></sec><sec id="s3d"><title>Protein turnover and acetylation</title><p>Deregulation of acetylation not only affects vesicle dynamics but also &#x003b1;-tubulin turnover (summarized in model <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000820-g008">Figure 8F</xref>). Indeed, this is important for cellular function as revealed by the movement defect of the <italic>elongator</italic>; <italic>&#x003b1;-tubulin</italic> double mutant. It is noteworthy that the defects can only be seen when crossing structural mutants of &#x003b1;-tubulin and not regulative or null mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000820-g003">Figure 3B&#x02013;3D</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000820.s006">Table S1</xref>). These defects may thus be the consequence of the accumulation of damaged &#x003b1;-tubulin, which in turn alters MT and neuronal function. In contrast, precise regulation of the levels of functional &#x003b1;-tubulin is required in the suppression experiments, since all mutations in &#x003b1;-tubulin abolish suppression. This provides further evidence that acetylation is important for the regulation of &#x003b1;-tubulin levels. Besides this work, a significant and growing amount of studies identifies acetylation of various proteins as a key regulator for their turnover. A very interesting finding is that molecules that participate in protein deacetylation, for example HDAC6, can directly interact with CDC48, a factor required for quality control and polyubiquitination of substrates.

DNA microarray analysis on human cells revealed that the depletion of Elongator (via RNAi of ELP1) in fibroblasts modulates the expression of genes, several notably linked to motility and migration.

As the worm knock-out of <italic>elpc-1</italic> is viable, it is arguably at present, the most suitable system to study and model the ELP1 function in neurons. Indeed, it may at first seem surprising that the defects in the worm nervous system are more similar to the human disease, while the mouse model has such a severe phenotype. However, several differences within the systems may offer plausible explanations. In humans, ELP1 is only downregulated, rather than completely deleted as in the mouse ELP1 experiment. Moreover, whilst only one &#x003b1;-tubulin is acetylable in the nematode, namely MEC-12/&#x003b1;-tubulin (expressed exclusively in neurons, which are not critical for survival as in mouse), all vertebrate &#x003b1;-tubulins possess the acetylatable lysine 40. Therefore regulation of vertebrate turnover of &#x003b1;-tubulin may have a greater impact at the cellular and organismal level and contribute to the severe phenotype observed in the knock out mouse. The mouse phenotypes may all be a result of defective cytoskeletal dynamics, such as reduced polarization and/or vesicular transport due to the downregulation of &#x003b1;-tubulin acetylation. The results presented here offer exquisite support for this line of argumentation, but clearly need further investigations into the transcriptional function of the <italic>elongator</italic> in vertebrates.</p><p>A further aspect is the degeneration of neurons present in FD patients as well as in ALS patients. In the worm model &#x003b1;-tubulin turnover is regulated through acetylation. Degenerative aspects may arise from deregulation of transcription as both ELP1 (involved in FD) and Elp3 (involved in ALS) are part of the same transcriptional <italic>elongator</italic> complex. Nevertheless, accumulation of &#x0201c;hypoacetylated&#x0201d; targets may be an additional explanation, since acetylation is important in the regulation of protein turnover. In addition, the reduced transport along MTs might lead to an accumulation of proteins destined for degradation. Indeed, the results show that transport is hampered in <italic>elongator</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000820-g004">Figure 4</xref>), that the <italic>elongator</italic> regulates &#x003b1;-tubulin acetylation and that downregulation of acetylation leads to accumulation of &#x003b1;-tubulin which in turn alters MT dynamics.

In wt the average number of intersections and its standard deviation are &#x003bc;<sub>1</sub>&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;67 and &#x003c3;<sub>1</sub>&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;9; for <italic>elpc-1(lf)</italic> &#x003bc;<sub>2</sub>&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;85 and &#x003c3;<sub>2</sub>&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;5. The means are statistically different: &#x003bc;<sub>1</sub> differs from &#x003bc;<sub>2</sub> (one-sided t test, P&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;2&#x000b7;10<sup>&#x02212;4</sup>; 11&#x02013;Inf is 95&#x00025; confidence interval for &#x003bc;<sub>2</sub>&#x02212;&#x003bc;<sub>1</sub>). These measurements confirm that the two individuals of different genotype show similar MT intersection levels than the respective ones in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000820-g007">Figure 7B</xref>. Based on these data, homogeneity of variances cannot be discarded (one-sided F test, P&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;0.1). Interpretation model: Assuming that microtubules have a fixed length <underline>h</underline>, parallel to the axis of the axon and distributed uniformly along an axon of a given length <underline>L</underline> leads to following calculations: the probability for a microtubule to cross any section is p&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;h/L and follows the Poisson distribution (h/L equals the ways a &#x0201c;stick&#x0201d; of length h can be placed in a longer &#x0201c;tube&#x0201d; of length L). Performing N trials of a Poisson process with probability p, the expected value and the variance of the number of successes for a random variable X are E(X)&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;Np and VAR(X)&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;Np(1&#x02212;p), respectively. Thus, if we have m microtubules, the expected value for the number of intersections is E(X)&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;mh/L, while the variance is VAR(X)&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;mh/L(1&#x02212;h/L). Since the <italic>elpc-1(lf)</italic> mutant has, on average, more microtubules intersections than wild type, using E(X)&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;mh/L we obtain the condition m<sub>2</sub>h<sub>2</sub>&#x0003e;m<sub>1</sub>h<sub>1</sub> (1&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;wt; 2&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;<italic>elpc-1(lf)</italic>). In other words, <italic>elpc-1(lf)</italic> have more microtubules, or the microtubules are longer, or both. It seems unlikely that the main change is the number of microtubules, because the assumption that microtubule length is unchanged, i.e. h<sub>2</sub>&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;h<sub>1</sub> and m<sub>2</sub>&#x0003e;m<sub>1</sub>, requires VAR<sub>2</sub>(X)&#x0003e;VAR<sub>1</sub>(X), i.e. &#x003c3;<sup>2</sup><sub>2</sub>&#x0003e;&#x003c3;<sup>2</sup><sub>1</sub>.
