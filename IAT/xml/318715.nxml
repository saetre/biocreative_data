An open reading frame spanned positions 61 to 1602. The first 25, and three of the last five, amino acids of P3-450 are identical to those found in the amino- and carboxy-terminus, respectively, of the rat P-450d protein. Mouse P3-450 protein has 513 residues, and a molecular weight of 58,223 with six cysteine residues. P3-450 nucleotides 305 to 352 exhibit 74% homology, and nucleotides 1068 to 1260, 69% homology, with portions of rat P-450b exons 2 and 7, respectively. P3-450 shows 62% homology in the so-called "highly conserved region" of 39 nucleotides in the rat P-450b and P-450e and the mouse P-450b. These results indicate that P3-450, P-450b and P-450e arose from a common ancestral gene. Cysteinyl peptide-coding regions were examined: P3-450 nucleotides 1405 to 1464 exhibit 61% homology, and nucleotides 502 to 552 exhibit 37% homology, when compared with their corresponding regions in the rat P-450b gene. These data support the likelihood that cysteine 456 is the thiolate ligand to the heme iron in the P3-450 enzyme active-site.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><supplementary-material content-type="scanned-pages"><graphic xlink:href="nar00324-0328.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="2917"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00324-0329.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="2918"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00324-0330.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="2919"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00324-0331.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="2920"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00324-0332.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="2921"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00324-0333.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="2922"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00324-0334.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="2923"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00324-0335.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="2924"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00324-0336.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="2925"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00324-0337.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="2926"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00324-0338.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="2927"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00324-0339.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="2928"/></supplementary-material></body></article>
