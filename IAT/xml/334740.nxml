As a basal histone, H2A.Z is synthesized throughout the cell cycle at a constant rate, unlinked to DNA replication, and at a much lower rate in quiescent cells. Each of the cDNA isolates encodes the entire H2A.Z polypeptide. The human isolate is about 1.0 kilobases long. It contains a coding region of 387 nucleotides flanked by 106 nucleotides of 5'UTR and 376 nucleotides of 3'UTR, which contains a polyadenylation signal followed by a poly A tail. The bovine and rat cDNAs have 97 and 94% nucleotide positional identity to the human cDNA in the coding region and 98% in the proximal 376 nucleotides of the 3'UTR which includes the polyadenylation signal. A potential stem-forming sequence imbedded in a direct repeat is found centered at 261 nucleotides into the 3'UTR. Each of the cDNA clones could be transcribed and translated in vitro to yield H2A.Z protein. The mammalian H2A.Z cDNA coding sequences are approximately 80% similar to those in chicken and 75% to those in sea urchin.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><supplementary-material content-type="scanned-pages"><graphic xlink:href="nar00145-0325.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1113"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00145-0326.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1114"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00145-0327.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1115"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00145-0328.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1116"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00145-0329.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1117"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00145-0330.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1118"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00145-0331.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1119"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00145-0332.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1120"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00145-0333.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1121"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00145-0334.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1122"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00145-0335.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1123"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00145-0336.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1124"/></supplementary-material></body></article>
