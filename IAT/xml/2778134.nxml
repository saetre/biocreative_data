In plants, poly(A) polymerases are encoded by modest gene families. To better understand this multiplicity of genes, poly(A) polymerase-encoding genes from several other plants, as well as from <italic>Selaginella</italic>, <italic>Physcomitrella</italic>, and <italic>Chlamydomonas</italic>, were studied.</p></sec><sec><title>Methodology/Principal Findings</title><p>Using bioinformatics tools, poly(A) polymerase-encoding genes were identified in the genomes of eight species in the plant lineage. Whereas <italic>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</italic> was found to possess a single poly(A) polymerase gene, other species possessed between two and six possible poly(A) polymerase genes. With the exception of four intron-lacking genes, all of the plant poly(A) polymerase genes (but not the <italic>C. reinhardtii</italic> gene) possessed almost identical intron positions within the poly(A) polymerase coding sequences, suggesting that all plant poly(A) polymerase genes derive from a single ancestral gene. The four <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> poly(A) polymerase genes were found to be essential, based on genetic analysis of T-DNA insertion mutants. GFP fusion proteins containing three of the four <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> poly(A) polymerases localized to the nucleus, while one such fusion protein was localized in the cytoplasm. The fact that this latter protein is largely pollen-specific suggests that it has important roles in male gametogenesis.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions/Significance</title><p>Our results indicate that poly(A) polymerase genes have expanded from a single ancestral gene by a series of duplication events during the evolution of higher plants, and that individual members have undergone sorts of functional specialization so as to render them essential for plant growth and development. Perhaps the most interesting of the plant poly(A) polymerases is a novel cytoplasmic poly(A) polymerase that is expressed in pollen in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>; this is reminiscent of spermatocyte-specific cytoplasmic poly(A) polymerases in mammals.</p></sec></abstract><counts><page-count count="10"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Eukaryotic messenger RNAs possess characteristic 5&#x02032;- and 3&#x02032;- modifications that promote the overall functionality of the molecule. The 3&#x02032; modification is an extended poly(A) tract, and serves to promote RNA stability and translatability through interactions with poly(A) binding proteins and translation initiation factors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008082-Kuhn1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>. The poly(A) tract is added posttranscriptionally to mRNAs in the nucleus in a two-step RNA processing reaction; a precursor RNA (or pre-mRNA) is processed at a specific site, and the processed RNA subsequently polyadenylated by a specialized nucleotidyltransferase, poly(A) polymerase. Processing and polyadenylation is mediated by a sizeable complex of factors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008082-Mandel1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>; this complex recognizes specific sequence elements in the pre-mRNA, cleaves the pre-mRNA at a particular site, and facilitates the addition, by poly(A) polymerase, of the poly(A) tract to the cleaved pre-mRNA. Poly(A) length is controlled by interactions of the poly(A) polymerase and poly(A) itself with a distinctive poly(A) binding protein.</p><p>Poly(A) polymerases are broadly conserved enzymes and members of the larger class of nucleotidyltransferases <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008082-Martin1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>. The canonical nuclear poly(A) polymerase that participates in mRNA 3&#x02032; end formation is present in all eukaryotic organisms. In structural terms, all canonical poly(A) polymerases share a conserved N-terminal 450&#x02013;500 amino acids that includes crucial RNA-binding domains, Mg-coordinating amino acid side chains, the ATP-binding active site of the enzyme, and nuclear localization signals <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008082-Martin2">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008082-Raabe1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>. The C-termini of eukaryotic poly(A) polymerases are more divergent. For example, mammalian poly(A) polymerases have a 200&#x02013;300 amino acid C-terminus that contains numerous phosphorylation sites <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008082-Colgan1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>. The C-terminus of the yeast enzyme is smaller (ca. 100 amino acids) and consists (in part) of additional RNA-binding domains that are important for overall function of the enzyme (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008082-Zhelkovsky1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>).</p><p>There are a number of other poly(A) polymerases, closely related in sequence, that have functions apart from that of the canonical nuclear poly(A) polymerase. For example, testis-specific poly(A) polymerases have been identified in the mouse <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008082-Kashiwabara1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008082-Kashiwabara2">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008082-Lee1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>. This enzyme is encoded by a gene that is distinct from other poly(A) polymerase genes, since the testis-specific gene lacks introns. The testis-specific poly(A) polymerase is present in the cytoplasm <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008082-Kashiwabara2">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008082-Lee1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref> and nucleus <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008082-Lee1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref> of mouse testis cells. Interestingly, it possesses only one (N-terminal) of the two nuclear localization signals that are seen in other mammalian poly(A) polymerases, and lacks the C-terminal domain that is involved in various regulatory modifications and interactions.</p><p>In the model plant <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic>, poly(A) polymerases related to the canonical nuclear poly(A) polymerase are encoded by a small four-member gene family <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008082-Addepalli1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>. Three of these genes encode polypeptides that are similar in sequence and size, while the fourth encodes a more distantly-related polypeptide that consists almost entirely of the conserved N-terminal portion of the enzyme. The predicted products of all four genes possess poly(A) polymerase activity, and all four are expressed in the plant <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008082-Addepalli1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008082-Hunt1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>, indicating that none of the four are pseudogenes. Transcripts from all four genes are alternatively-spliced in tissue-specific manners, such that each gene has the potential to encode very small (ca. 200&#x02013;300 amino acid) polypeptides as well as the full-sized gene products <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008082-Addepalli1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>To better understand the nature of poly(A) polymerase genes in plants, we have undertaken a combined evolutionary, molecular, and genetic analysis of the higher plant poly(A) polymerase gene families. The results reported here reveal that higher plants possess a set of conserved poly(A) polymerase genes that likely arose from a single ancestral gene via a series of gene duplications. They also indicate that all but one of the six rice poly(A) polymerase gene is expressed, albeit to different extents. Furthermore, the results of this study show that each of the four <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> poly(A) polymerase genes is essential, that the promoters of these four genes have distinctive expression properties, and that one of the four poly(A) polymerase proteins is cytoplasmic. Together, these studies reveal a remarkable evolutionary history of duplication and suggest a degree of functional specialization of poly(A) polymerases in plants.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Duplication and Diversification of Poly(A) Polymerase Genes in the Plant Lineage</title><p>Previous reports have described some properties of the <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> poly(A) polymerase gene family.

Rice was chosen because its poly(A) polymerase genes are representative of the entire range of poly(A) polymerase genes seen in the eight species examined; in particular, it has members of all three poly(A) polymerase classes, and has an intron-lacking gene (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0008082.s002">Figure S2</xref>) encoding a protein that seems distantly related, at best, to other plant poly(A) polymerases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0008082-g001">Figure 1</xref>). In this experiment, no discernible expression of the intron-lacking poly(A) polymerase gene (Os4g49870) would be seen, even when using the sensitive RT/PCR method (not shown). The expression of one gene (Os07g48890) was exceedingly low, such that partial cDNA clones (that spanned one or more introns, and thus were derived from spliced mRNAs) could be obtained by RT/PCR, but full-length cDNAs could not be generated. The other rice poly(A) polymerase genes were expressed, such that full-length cDNAs could be amplified by RT/PCR, cloned, and sequenced (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0008082.s004">File S1</xref>).</p><p>The expression of four of the rice poly(A) polymerase genes could be detected by RNA blotting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0008082-g002">Figure 2</xref>). These experiments revealed a modest bias in the expression of these genes in different tissues. Os2g13400 was expressed somewhat uniformly in the four tissues sampled (leaves, stems, roots, and flowers), although expression in flowers was somewhat higher. Os6g21470 and Os6g36360 were also expressed throughout the plant, at levels near the limits of detection using the RNA blotting assay. In contrast to the somewhat uniform expression of these three poly(A) polymerase genes throughout the plant, Os3g19220 was expressed in leaves, stems, and flowers, but not in roots. The levels of expression of one of the rice poly(A) polymerase genes (Os07g48890) was beneath the detection limits of the RNA blotting assay. From these results, it may be concluded that at least four of the six rice poly(A) polymerase genes are expressed, one has very low expression and the other, if expressed, is at levels that are beneath the limits of detection of the assays used in this study.</p><fig id="pone-0008082-g002" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0008082.g002</object-id><label>Figure 2</label><caption><title>Expression profile of four of the rice poly(A) polymerase genes.</title><p>10 &#x000b5;g of total RNA isolated from the indicated tissue (denoted on the top: L &#x02013; leaf, S &#x02013; stem, R &#x02013; root, F - flower) was separated on agarose gels, transferred to nylon membranes, and probed with labeled probes specific for each poly(A) polymerase gene (these were derived from the 3&#x02032; ends of each mRNA).

The lack of any progeny homozygous for any of the T-DNA insertions suggests that the inactivation of each gene is lethal.

The three basic families seem to have been established before the divergence of the angiosperm lineages studied here, but a number of subsequent duplications occurred subsequent to these various divergences. Thus, the PAPS3 family of the grasses expanded by duplication, apparently before the divergence of the sorghum and rice lineages. This is suggested by the closer similarity of the two rice poly(A) polymerases to their putative sorghum relatives than to each other.

Based on the topography of the tree shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0008082-g001">Figure 1</xref>, there appears to have been in the rosids a series of duplications of the putative ancestral PAPS2/PAPS4 gene that occurred after the divergence of the rosid species (<italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic>, <italic>Populus trichocarpa</italic>, and <italic>Vitis vinifera</italic>) studied in this report. An analogous duplication occurred prior to the divergence of the rice and sorghum lineages. Thus, it would appear as if the hypothetical ancestral PAPS2/PAPS4 gene was duplicated independently in most of the rosid lineages analyzed here. This is remarkable, since the PAPS2 and PAPS4 genes are both essential in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>. The implication is that similar duplications occurred repeatedly, consistently, and independently in the course of plant evolution, and that these events have yielded poly(A) polymerases with different but essential functions.</p><p>However, the topography of the PAPS2/PAPS4 branch of the tree shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0008082-g001">Figure 1</xref> may be a result, not of multiple independent duplications of the hypothetical ancestral gene in the various lineages, but rather of evolutionary trajectories that are constrained by the interactions of poly(A) polymerases with other proteins in the cell. One such constraint may be the interactions of these two proteins with Fip1 orthologs. Both PAPS2 and PAPS4 interact with one such ortholog, FIPS5, in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008082-Hunt1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008082-Forbes1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>.

Since FIPS5 is encoded by a single gene in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008082-Hunt1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref> and the other plants studied here (D. Xing et al., in preparation), any co-evolution of interacting FIPS5 and poly(A) polymerase domains could act to limit the diversification of different poly(A) polymerases. Should this be the case, then the ancestral PAPS2 and PAPS4 genes likely arose prior to the divergence of the different rosid lineages. This is rather different from the possibility suggested in the preceding paragraph. A clarification of these two models awaits further study.</p><p>The plant PAPS3 isoforms differ from the other poly(A) polymerase variants in that they lack the extended C-terminal domains seen in the latter proteins, along with the predicted nuclear localization information. Moreover, they are cytoplasmic in location, judging from the subcellular distribution of the <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> PAPS3-GFP fusion protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0008082-g005">Figure 5</xref>). In many ways, these smaller plant poly(A) polymerases resemble the mouse testis-specific poly(A) polymerase, TPAP<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008082-Kashiwabara2">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>. TPAP is a cytoplasmic enzyme that is essential for spermatogenesis in mammals; TPAP-deficient mice display an arrest in spermatogenesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008082-Kashiwabara1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>, a phenotype that is reversed by expression of TPAP as a transgene in deficient animals <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008082-Zhuang1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>. The expression studies performed in this work and earlier <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008082-Addepalli1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref> do not provide an adequate resolution of the expression of the plant poly(A) polymerases during gametogenesis. However, public-domain microarray experiments (see, e.g., <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.genevestigator.ethz.ch">http://www.genevestigator.ethz.ch</ext-link>) indicate that the <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> PAPS3 gene is expressed preferentially during microgamete development and in mature pollen <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008082-Hunt1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>. This possible parallel between TPAP and the plant PAPS3 family of proteins is interesting, as it suggests cytoplasmic poly(A) polymerases specific for sperm or pollen development evolved independently in the plant and animal lineages.</p><p>To summarize, the results presented here reveal a striking evolutionary history of poly(A) polymerase genes in plants. The plant poly(A) polymerase gene family expanded via a series of duplications, and the products of these duplications subsequently appear to have acquired specialized functions.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Plant Material</title><p><italic>Oryza sativa</italic> sub-species <italic>indica</italic> var Lemont seed was a gift from Anna McClung, 93 Foundation, USDA-Texas A&#x00026;M.
