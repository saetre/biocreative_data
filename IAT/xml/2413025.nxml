In response to proinflammatory cytokines and pathogen-associated molecular patterns, NF-&#x003ba;B activation is controlled by I&#x003ba;B kinase (IKK)&#x003b2;. Using Cre/<italic>lox</italic>-mediated gene targeting of IKK&#x003b2;, we have uncovered a tissue-specific role for IKK&#x003b2; during infection with group B streptococcus. Although deletion of IKK&#x003b2; in airway epithelial cells had the predicted effect of inhibiting inflammation and reducing innate immunity, deletion of IKK&#x003b2; in the myeloid lineage unexpectedly conferred resistance to infection that was associated with increased expression of interleukin (IL)-12, inducible nitric oxide synthase (NOS2), and major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II by macrophages. We also describe a previously unknown role for IKK&#x003b2; in the inhibition of signal transducer and activator of transcription (Stat)1 signaling in macrophages, which is critical for IL-12, NOS2, and MHC class II expression. These studies suggest that IKK&#x003b2; inhibits the &#x0201c;classically&#x0201d; activated or M1 macrophage phenotype during infection through negative cross talk with the Stat1 pathway. This may represent a mechanism to prevent the over-exuberant activation of macrophages during infection and contribute to the resolution of inflammation.

NF-&#x003ba;B activation in response to proinflammatory stimuli is regulated by I&#x003ba;B kinase (IKK)&#x003b2;, which has recently become a major target for the development of new antiinflammatory drugs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">2</xref>). However, we have previously established both pro- and antiinflammatory roles for NF-&#x003ba;B in inflammation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">4</xref>). In this study, we have tested the hypothesis that NF-&#x003ba;B has tissue-specific roles in inflammation; although NF-&#x003ba;B activation in epithelial cells is required to drive the inflammatory response, NF-&#x003ba;B activity in macrophages has an opposing role in the resolution of inflammation.</p><p>Macrophages are an extremely heterogeneous lineage displaying a range of both pro- and antiinflammatory functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">6</xref>). Two extremes in the spectrum of macrophage function are represented by the &#x0201c;classically&#x0201d; activated (or M1) and the alternative (or M2) phenotypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">7</xref>). The M1 phenotype is typified by IFN-&#x003b3;&#x02013;primed macrophages and is characterized by increased MHC class II, IL-12, and inducible nitric oxide synthase (NOS2) expression. M2 macrophages are characterized by decreased expression of NOS2, MHC class II, and IL-12, but elevated expression of antiinflammatory cytokines such as IL-10. The M2 phenotype is promoted by Th2 cytokines such as IL-4 and IL-13. Generally, M2 macrophages are considered antiinflammatory cells, whereas M1 macrophages are proinflammatory. The signaling pathways that regulate these phenotypes in vivo are not well understood.</p><p>We used Cre/<italic>lox</italic>-mediated gene targeting of IKK&#x003b2; in lung epithelial cells and macrophages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">10</xref>) and show that IKK&#x003b2; deletion in airway epithelial cells inhibits inflammation and prevents clearance of bacteria in the lung. However, IKK&#x003b2; deletion in macrophages has the opposite role, increasing the inflammatory response and enhancing the clearance of bacteria. In addition, we show that IKK&#x003b2; activation suppresses the classically activated or M1 macrophage phenotype, and we present evidence for negative regulation of Stat1 activation by IKK&#x003b2;. These findings represent important new information regarding the role of NF-&#x003ba;B in macrophage biology during inflammation and infection. Furthermore, cross talk between IKK&#x003b2; and Stat1 signaling pathways could have implications for the development and clinical use of IKK&#x003b2; inhibitors.</p><sec><title>RESULTS AND DISCUSSION</title><p>To investigate the tissue-specific role of IKK&#x003b2; in innate immunity, we specifically targeted the <italic>Ikk&#x003b2;</italic> gene using Cre/<italic>lox</italic>-mediated recombination in lung epithelial cells and myeloid cells using the clara cell&#x02013;specific protein promoter (Cc10) and lysozyme promoter to express Cre in bronchial airway epithelial cells and the myeloid cell lineage, respectively.

These experiments suggested that IKK&#x003b2; played a tissue-specific role in response to infection and that IKK&#x003b2; activity in airway epithelium was required for leukocyte recruitment and clearance of bacteria; however, IKK&#x003b2; activation in resident macrophages or myeloid cells recruited to the lung inhibited the inflammatory response and therefore impaired clearance of bacteria.</p><fig position="float" id="fig1"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p><bold>Tissue-specific role for IKK&#x003b2; in Streptococcal pneumonia.</bold> (A) IKK&#x003b2;<sup>&#x00394;Epi</sup> and IKK&#x003b2;<sup>f/f-Otet-cre</sup> control mice were infected intranasally with 5 &#x000d7; 10<sup>6</sup> CFUs GBS in PBS.

IKK&#x003b2;<sup>&#x00394;Mye</sup> mice were indeed more resistant to systemic infection with GBS. More than 60% of IKK&#x003b2;<sup>&#x00394;Mye</sup> mice survived a lethal dose of GBS beyond 48 h, whereas &#x0003e;90% of littermate controls had died within 24 h, and none survived to 48 h (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 A</xref>). Furthermore, resistance of IKK&#x003b2;<sup>&#x00394;Mye</sup> mice to lethal GBS infection correlated with significantly lower titres of bacteria in the blood (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 B</xref>; IKK&#x003b2;<sup>f/f</sup> vs. IKK&#x003b2;<sup>&#x00394;Mye</sup>; &#x0002a;&#x0002a;, P &#x0003d; 0.0057). To investigate the mechanism for this resistance, we measured the expression of proinflammatory cytokines in the spleen and serum of GBS-infected mice. <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 C</xref> shows a significant increase in the levels of protective Th1 cytokines IFN-&#x003b3; and IL-12 in IKK&#x003b2;<sup>&#x00394;Mye</sup> mice (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 C</xref>; IKK&#x003b2;<sup>f/f</sup> vs. IKK&#x003b2;<sup>&#x00394;Mye</sup>; IFN-&#x003b3;: &#x0002a;, P &#x0003d; 0.0148; IL-12: &#x0002a;&#x0002a;, P &#x0003d; 0.0023). Recently it has been reported that IKK&#x003b2; inhibits caspase 1&#x02013;dependent IL-1&#x003b2; release in LPS-stimulated PMNs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">4</xref>); however, we found no increase in serum IL-1&#x003b2; in GBS-infected IKK&#x003b2;<sup>&#x00394;Mye</sup> mice (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 C</xref>). In fact, IL-1&#x003b2; levels were slightly decreased, although these data did not reach statistical significance (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 C</xref>). To further analyze the macrophage phenotype in IKK&#x003b2;<sup>&#x00394;Mye</sup> mice, we isolated peritoneal macrophages from GBS-infected mice and measured MHC class II expression by FACS. IKK&#x003b2;<sup>&#x00394;Mye</sup> mice showed a threefold increase in MHC class II expression compared with control mice (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 D</xref>). Expression of the costimulatory molecules CD80 (B7.1) and CD86 (B7.2) were also increased on macrophages from IKK&#x003b2;<sup>&#x00394;Mye</sup> mice, whereas CD124 (IL-4R&#x003b1;) expression was decreased (Fig. S1 A, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20080124/DC1">http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20080124/DC1</ext-link>). We also analyzed IL-12p40 and arginase-1 mRNA expression in the spleen from GBS-infected mice; although expression of IL-12p40 was increased in IKK&#x003b2;<sup>&#x00394;Mye</sup> mice, expression of the antiinflammatory macrophage marker arginase-1 was reciprocally decreased (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 E</xref>). In addition, immunohistochemical analysis of lungs from GBS-infected mice revealed dramatically increased NOS2 expression in alveolar macrophages, whereas NOS2 expression in lung epithelium remained unchanged (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 F</xref>). IL-12 is a critical cytokine for host defense (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">12</xref>) and, along with MHC class II and NOS2, is a marker for classically activated or M1 macrophages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">7</xref>). On the other hand, increased expression of arginase-1 and IL-10 is characteristic of alternative M2 macrophage activation, which is dependent on CD124 expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">7</xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="fig2"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><p><bold>IKK&#x003b2; inhibits M1 macrophage activation during infection.</bold> (A) IKK&#x003b2;<sup>&#x00394;Mye</sup> and IKK&#x003b2;<sup>f/f</sup> control mice were infected by intraperitoneal injection of 5 &#x000d7; 10<sup>7</sup> CFUs GBS in PBS, and survival was monitored (<italic>n</italic> &#x0003d; 16&#x02013;17).

The impaired ability of IKK&#x003b2;<sup>&#x00394;Epi</sup> mice to clear bacteria is therefore quite expected; however, the finding that IKK&#x003b2; deletion in myeloid cells increases inflammation and bacterial clearance was somewhat surprising. In IKK&#x003b2;<sup>&#x00394;Mye</sup> mice, IKK&#x003b2; expression is effectively deleted in both macrophages and PMNs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">14</xref>). PMNs are the major defense against extracellular bacteria such as GBS, although macrophage activation is also critical to PMN recruitment in inflammation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">15</xref>). Previous work from our group has also shown that NF-&#x003ba;B can have a proapoptotic role in leukocytes during the resolution of inflammation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">3</xref>), which was recently confirmed in IKK&#x003b2;<sup>&#x00394;Mye</sup> mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">4</xref>); however, we found no difference in apoptosis in the lungs of GBS-infected IKK&#x003b2;<sup>&#x00394;Mye</sup> mice (not depicted). We performed in vitro killing assays with macrophages and PMNs isolated from IKK&#x003b2;<sup>&#x00394;Mye</sup> mice to test their direct antimicrobial activity. Although IKK&#x003b2;<sup>&#x00394;</sup> macrophages showed some level of increased killing in vitro, IKK&#x003b2;<sup>&#x00394;</sup> PMNs did not (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3, A and B</xref>). This suggested increased phagocytic killing by macrophages, probably through increased NOS2 expression, and macrophage-mediated PMN recruitment was responsible for enhanced clearance of bacteria rather than increased PMN activation. To test this hypothesis, we challenged IKK&#x003b2;<sup>&#x00394;Mye</sup> mice intranasally with a noninfectious stimulus, bacterial LPS, to measure activation of alveolar macrophages and PMN recruitment. Lung tissue was collected for FACS analysis of PMN recruitment (CD11b<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> Gr-1<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> staining), and macrophage activation was measured by MHC class II expression (CD11b<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> Gr-1<sup>&#x02212;</sup> MHC class II<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>). <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 C</xref> shows increased MHC class II expression on alveolar macrophages from IKK&#x003b2;<sup>&#x00394;Mye</sup> mice compared with control mice.

Peritoneal macrophages were elicited and stimulated in vitro with heat-killed bacteria over a 24-h time course, and protein extracts were prepared for biochemical analysis. As expected, there was a profound impairment in IKK activity and NF-&#x003ba;B activation in IKK&#x003b2;<sup>&#x00394;</sup> macrophages, whereas activation of JNK MAPK remained unchanged (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 A</xref>). However, although the absence of IKK activity was associated with decreased expression of pro&#x02013;IL-1&#x003b2; and TNF-&#x003b1;, expression of NOS2 was in fact elevated, which correlated with increased tyrosine phosphorylation of Stat1 (pY-Stat1) (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4, B&#x02013;D</xref>). Expression of the endogenous inhibitor of Stat1, suppressor of cytokine signaling (SOCS)1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">16</xref>), was unaltered in IKK&#x003b2;<sup>&#x00394;</sup> macrophages (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 B</xref>). Stat1 is a critical transcription factor for NOS2, IL-12, and MHC class II expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">17</xref>). These data suggest that IKK&#x003b2; activity in macrophages suppresses NOS2 as well as MHC class II and IL-12 expression during infection by antagonizing Stat1. M1 macrophage activation is typified by IFN-&#x003b3; priming (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">7</xref>), and IFN signaling in macrophages absolutely requires Stat1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">17</xref>). In macrophages stimulated in vitro with Toll-like receptor ligands, Stat1 is activated by the autocrine production of IFN-&#x003b2;; however, GBS-induced IFN-&#x003b2; expression was inhibited in IKK&#x003b2;<sup>&#x00394;</sup> macrophages (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 D</xref>). To investigate a role of IKK&#x003b2; in the cross regulation of Stat1 signaling, we stimulated IKK&#x003b2;<sup>&#x00394;</sup> macrophages with bacterial LPS and recombinant IFN-&#x003b3; in vitro. As shown in <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5 A</xref>, IKK&#x003b2;<sup>&#x00394;</sup> macrophages had increased activation of Stat1 and NOS2 expression when stimulated with LPS/IFN-&#x003b3;, whereas activation of Stat3 appeared unchanged. IFN-&#x003b3; and Stat1 strongly activate MHC class II expression in macrophages. To confirm the in vivo data described above, we measured MHC class II expression on macrophages stimulated in vitro with IFN-&#x003b3;. MHC class II expression was dramatically enhanced with IKK&#x003b2;<sup>&#x00394;</sup> macrophages (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5 B</xref>). In addition, IKK&#x003b2;<sup>&#x00394;</sup> macrophages showed an increased ability to drive T cell proliferation in an allogenic mixed lymphocyte assay (Fig. S1 B). In further experiments, we used a recombinant adenovirus to express a dominant-negative inhibitor of IKK&#x003b2; (IKK&#x003b2;<sup>dn</sup>) in macrophages in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">18</xref>). <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5 C</xref> shows that expression of IKK&#x003b2;<sup>dn</sup> increased both Stat1 activation and NOS2 expression upon stimulation with LPS. Similar results were obtained with heat-killed bacteria (not depicted). Expression of IKK&#x003b2;<sup>dn</sup> also dramatically increased LPS/IFN-&#x003b3;&#x02013;induced IL-12 production (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5 D</xref>). To confirm the role of IKK&#x003b2; in the suppression of Stat1 transcriptional activity, we performed reporter assays in RAW 264.7 macrophages using a GAS luciferase reporter gene. Transient overexpression of IKK&#x003b2; in RAW cells inhibited GAS reporter activity, whereas transfection of the endogenous NF-&#x003ba;B inhibitor I&#x003ba;B&#x003b1; increased GAS reporter activation (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5 E</xref>). As a positive control, overexpression of SOCS1 inhibited GAS activity. Interestingly, previous studies have also described sustained IL-12 expression in macrophages deficient in p50 and heterozygous for RelA expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">19</xref>), suggesting that NF-&#x003ba;B activation downstream of IKK&#x003b2; suppresses IL-12 expression. However, these studies did not include analysis of Stat1 activation. Our data would suggest that IL-12 expression is inhibited in macrophages by the NF-&#x003ba;B&#x02013;dependent expression of a Stat1 inhibitor other than SOCS1.</p><fig position="float" id="fig4"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><p><bold>IKK&#x003b2; inhibits Stat-1 activation in GBS-infected macrophages.</bold> (A) Peritoneal macrophages from IKK&#x003b2;<sup>&#x00394;Mye</sup> and IKK&#x003b2;<sup>f/f</sup> mice were stimulated in vitro with heat-killed GBS (MOI of 20:1).

In the current study, we describe a specific role for IKK&#x003b2; in limiting the expression of Stat-1&#x02013;regulated genes. There is clearly still much to learn about the relative and specific roles for IKK&#x003b1; and IKK&#x003b2; in inflammation and immunity. Our working hypotheses, based on previously published work and data presented here, is that IKK&#x003b1; acts to limit inflammation by inhibiting the persistent expression of NF-&#x003ba;B&#x02013;dependent proinflammatory genes. However, IKK&#x003b2;/NF-&#x003ba;B also acts to limit Stat-1 activity and the overexpression of Stat-1&#x02013;dependent genes as a result of autocrine and paracrine IFN signaling. These antiinflammatory roles for the IKK complex have clear implications for the clinical use of IKK inhibitors.</p><p>Here, we have described a new role for IKK&#x003b2; in the suppression of M1 macrophage activation during infection through the inhibition of Stat1 activity. To further test this hypothesis, we infected IKK&#x003b2;<sup>&#x00394;Mye</sup> mice with the fungal pathogen <italic>Cryptococcus neoformans</italic> (Cn). Cn infects macrophages and promotes an M2 phenotype to evade a protective Th1 response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">20</xref>). IKK&#x003b2;<sup>&#x00394;Mye</sup> mice infected with Cn showed increased clearance of fungi after 10 d compared with control mice (Fig. S2 B, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20080124/DC1">http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20080124/DC1</ext-link>; IKK&#x003b2;<sup>f/f</sup> vs. IKK&#x003b2;<sup>&#x00394;Mye</sup>; &#x0002a;, P &#x0003d; 0.003). FACS analysis of BAL and lung tissue from Cn-infected mice showed MHC class II expression on alveolar macrophages was significantly increased (Fig. S2 C; IKK&#x003b2;<sup>f/f</sup> vs. IKK&#x003b2;<sup>&#x00394;Mye</sup>; &#x0002a;, P &#x0003d; 0.0172). In addition, the proportion of T cells in the lungs of IKK&#x003b2;<sup>&#x00394;Mye</sup> mice was elevated, although these data did not reach statistical significance (Fig. S2 C). These changes correlated with increased IFN-&#x003b3; in BAL and reduced levels of Th2 cytokines IL-4 and IL-5 (Fig. S2 D), suggesting a switch to a protective Th1 response. These data, and that described above, suggest that IKK&#x003b2; inhibits M1 macrophage activation during infection with both extracellular Streptococci and the intracellular fungal pathogen Cn. The precise pathophysiological significance of M1 and M2 macrophage populations is not yet well established (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">7</xref>). However, it is clear that M1 macrophage activation is critical to control certain infections, but a switch to an M2 phenotype may limit the innate immune response and be required for the resolution of inflammation.</p><p>In summary, IKK&#x003b2; plays a tissue-specific role in inflammation. In resident tissue cells, such as lung epithelium, IKK&#x003b2;-mediated NF-&#x003ba;B activation drives cytokine and chemokine production required to initiate the inflammatory response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">13</xref>). However, NF-&#x003ba;B activation in resident macrophages or leukocytes recruited during inflammation has an antiinflammatory role (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">21</xref>). This may represent a mechanism to prevent the over-exuberant activation of macrophages during inflammation. In a parallel study in this issue on page <related-article related-article-type="article-reference" vol="205" page="1261" id="N0x3d24180N0x4966860" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="18490490" ext-link-type="pubmed">1261</related-article>, Hagemann et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">22</xref>) show that inhibition of IKK&#x003b2; in tumor-associated macrophages, which have an M2 phenotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">23</xref>), also leads to increased Stat1 activation and a polarized M1 phenotype (increased; NOS2, MHC class II, and IL-12). However, in this context IKK&#x003b2; inhibition confers enhanced tumoricidal activity, analogous to the increased antimicrobial activity observed in IKK&#x003b2;<sup>&#x00394;Mye</sup> mice. It will be interesting to investigate if pathogens can highjack the IKK&#x003b2;&#x02013;NF-&#x003ba;B pathway to evade M1 macrophage activation and innate immunity in a similar fashion to tumor cells.</p><p>Considering the dominant role of Stat1 in regulation of NOS2, MHC class II, and IL-12 expression, it is likely that activation of this pathway is a major determinant of the M1 macrophage phenotype. Collectively, these data suggest that IKK&#x003b2; activation plays an important role in suppression of this phenotype, contributing to both the resolution of inflammation during infection and the suppression of macrophage tumoricidal activity in cancer. The potential to manipulate the inflammatory phenotype of macrophages by targeting IKK&#x003b2; may offer therapeutic opportunities for the treatment of inflammatory diseases, infection, and cancer.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec disp-level="3"><title>Mice.</title><p>The generation and characterization of IKK&#x003b2;<sup>f/f</sup>, IKK&#x003b2;<sup>&#x00394;Mye</sup>, IKK&#x003b2;<sup>f/f-Otet-cre</sup>, and IKK&#x003b2;<sup>&#x00394;Epi</sup> mice has been described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">10</xref>).
