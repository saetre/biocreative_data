Introduction</title><p>Human pulmonary epithelial cell is one of major sources of productive inflammatory biomediators, such as prostaglandin E<sub>2 </sub>(PGE<sub>2</sub>), interleukin-6 (IL-6), in respiratory inflammatory diseases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) is an inducible enzyme that is expressed in response to inflammatory cytokines, and it is responsible for the synthesis of pro-inflammatory PGs such as PGE<sub>2</sub>. Increased expression of COX-2 and production of PGE2 have been found in pulmonary inflammatory disorders [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>].</p><p>Statins is a class of compounds that decreases cholesterol synthesis via inhibition of 3-hydroxy-3methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase. Recently, anti-inflammatory effects of statins have been described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. For example, Atorvastatin reduces expression of the COX-2 in cultured vascular smooth muscle cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. However, it is not clear whether Atorvastatin also affects COX-2 expression in human pulmonary epithelial cells. Because of importance of COX-2 in inflammatory respiratory diseases, we tested the effects of Atorvastatin on lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced expression of COX-2 in cultured human pulmonary epithelial cells.</p></sec><sec><title>2. Methods</title><sec><title>2.1 Materials</title><p>Human pulmonary epithelial cell line (A549) was purchased from American Type Culture Collection (ATCC). Medium DMEM, trypsin, fetal bovine serum (FBS) and LPS were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. ECL chemiluminescence reagents, COX-2 polyclonal antibody were purchased from Cayman Chemical Co. Anti-rabbit IgG, horseradish peroxidase linked whole antibody was obtained from Amersham LIFE SCIENCE. HECAMEG was from Vegatec (Villejuif, France). Trizol and electrophoresis reagents were from Promag Co. Atorvastatin was a gift from Beijing Honghui Medicine Co.</p></sec><sec><title>2.2 Cell culture</title><p>A549 cells were grown in DEME medium supplemented with 5% FBS, 100 u/ml penicillin, 100 u/ml streptomycin, and 50 &#x003bc;g/L amphotericin B. Cells were sub-cultured into six-well plates and maintained until sub-confluence. The medium was then replaced by a serum-free culture medium for 24 h prior to the addition of LPS and/or other reagents. The cells were then incubated with various concentrations of LPS for 9 h, or 10 &#x003bc;g LPS for different times. For atorvastatin experiments, the cells were incubated in the serum-free medium containing 10 &#x003bc;g LPS in the presence or absence of different concentrations of atorvastatin for 9 h.</p></sec><sec><title>2.3 PGE<sub>2 </sub>assay</title><p>After incubation, the medium was collected for measurement of PGE<sub>2</sub>. PGE<sub>2 </sub>was determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA, Shanghai Sun Biomedical Co. CV &#x0003c;10%).</p></sec><sec><title>2.4 RNA extraction, reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR)</title><p>COX-2 mRNA was measured by RT-PCR as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. Briefly, total RNA from different experimental conditions was obtained by Trizol method (Life technologies) and the concentration of RNA was determined by an absorbance at 260 nm. For RT-PCR, 100 ng of RNA from different experimental conditions was applied to the access RT-PCR System. The following primers were used for COX-2: forward: 5'-AAG CTG GGA AGC CTT CTC TA-3' and reverse: 5'-TTT CCA TCC TTG AAA AGG CGC-3', which yielded products of 342 bp (50 sec at 55&#x000b0;C for annealing of the primers, 35 cycles), and CYCLOPHILIN A: forward: 5'-ATG GTC AAC CCC ACC GTG TTC TTC G-3' and reverse: 5'-CGT GTG AAG TCA CCA CCC TGA CAC A-3', which yielded products of 206 bp (50 sec at 55&#x000b0;C for annealing primers, 38 cycles). The DNA products from RT-PCR reactions were analyzed on a 4% polyacrylamide-urea gel in the same buffer. The polyacrylamide gels were dried and scanned using the ImageQuant densitometer (Gel Doc 2000, BioRad Co).</p></sec><sec><title>2.5 Western Blot analysis</title><p>After incubation, A549 cells were washed twice in phosphate-buffered saline, lysed in 200 &#x003bc;l lysis buffer (20 mM Tris/HCL, pH 7.5, 20 mM HECAMEG, 1 mM benzamidine). Protein content was determined by a microbicinchoninic acid assay (Pierce) with bovine serum albumin as standard. Western blot analysis was performed as described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Briefly, the protein was separated by electrophoresis on a 10% polyacrylamide gel at 180 V for 45 min. After transfer to nitrocellulose, the membrane was blocked, incubated with a specific rabbit polyclonal antibody against COX-2 (1:1000). The blots were then incubated with a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit antibody (1:5000). Antibody labeling was detected by enhanced chemiluminescence. The films were scanned using an Arcus II Agfa scanner, and densitometric analysis was performed using Sigma Gel software.</p></sec><sec><title>2.6 Statistical analysis</title><p>Statistical analysis was performed with SPSS analysis (SPSS10.0 Software). PGE<sub>2 </sub>and RT-PCR data are presented as mean &#x000b1; S.D., and the differences between the multiple treatment groups were analyzed by the one-way ANOVA, LSD test. Data were correlated by nonparametric Spearman's rank method. Probability values of 0.05 or less were considered to be statistically significant.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>3. Results</title><sec><title>3.1 Dose- and time-dependent effects of LPS on COX-2 mRNA expression and PGE2 production</title><p>To determine the concentration dependent effect of LPS, A549 cells were incubated with various concentrations of LPS for 9 h. RT-PCR analysis indicated that LPS increased the expression of COX-2 mRNA in a concentration-dependent manner (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>, <bold>top</bold>). Concentrations as low as 5 &#x003bc;g/ml LPS were effective in inducing expression of the COX-2 mRNA. To determine the time-dependent effect, A549 cells were incubated with LPS (10 &#x003bc;g/ml) for different times. The expression of COX-2 mRNA was increased by LPS as early as 6 h, the earliest time point tested. It reached a maximum induction by 9 h of incubation, and remained stable for at least 12 h, the longest time tested (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>, <bold>middle</bold>). LPS also increased the production of PGE<sub>2</sub>, a major cyclooxygenase product in A549 cells, in a time- and dose-dependent manner (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C</xref>, <bold>bottom</bold>). LPS (5 &#x003bc;g/ml) caused a 3-fold increase in amount of PGE<sub>2</sub>, and increased PGE<sub>2 </sub>was also observed as early as 6 h of incubation.</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>A: </bold>Dose-dependent effect of LPS on COX-2 mRNA expression.

Discussion</title><p>Inflammatory cytokines as well as prostaglandins (PGs) play important roles in inflammatory process of respiratory system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. PGs are synthesized from arachidonic acid by a reaction catalyzed by cyclooxygenase. Two isoforms of this enzyme have been identified [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. COX-1 is expressed constitutively in almost all tissues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>], and COX-2 is an inducible enzyme that is expressed in response to inflammatory cytokines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Increased expression of COX-2 has been reported in human pulmonary epithelial cells under experimental inflammatory conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. In the present study, we also found that LPS induces expression of COX-2 mRNA and PGE2 formation in a dose- and time-dependent manner in A549 cells. These results suggested that expression of the COX-2 could be induced in A549 cells. Because the COX-2 is responsible for the synthesis of pro-inflammatory PGs such as PGE<sub>2 </sub>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>], an increased expression of COX-2 might play an important role in respiratory inflammatory processes.</p><p>HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, which decrease the synthesis of cholesterol, have been shown to decrease the incidence of acute coronary events [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. Recent studies suggest that the beneficial effects of statins on clinical events may be not related to its' effect on cholesterol synthesis. Statins affect endothelial cells, smooth muscle cells, monocyte- macrophage, vasomotor function, inflammatory responses, and plaque stability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. Anti-inflammatory action of statins might be related to the reduction of the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Statins inhibit the Ang II-induced secretion of interleukin-6 (IL-6) in cultured human vascular smooth muscle cells, and decrease production of IL-6, interleukin-1&#x003b2; in human umbilical vein endothelial cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. Atorvaststin also down-regulates expression of COX-2 mRNA both <italic>in vivo </italic>and <italic>in vitro </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. In this study, we found that atorvastatin significantly reduced LPS-induced expression of COX-2 mRNA in cultured A549 cells. Atorvastatin also significantly reduced LPS-induced PGE<sub>2 </sub>production. The correlation analysis indicated that there is a positive correlation between reduced expression of COX-2 and decreased PGE<sub>2</sub>. Furthermore, the patterns showing effects of atorvastatin on LPS-induced expression of COX-2 mRNA, protein and PGE<sub>2 </sub>production in different times were similar. These suggest that decreased production of PGE<sub>2 </sub>by atorvastatin is caused by down-regulation of COX-2 expression. In contrast to our observations, other study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>] showed that mevastatin and lovastatin increase expression of COX-2 and subsequent prostacyclin formation in human aortic smooth muscle cells. It appears that the effects of statins on expression of COX-2 might depend on the cell types or different statins used.</p><p>In conclusion, atorvastatin down-regulates LPS-induced expression of COX-2 and production of PGE<sub>2 </sub>in cultured A549 cells. These results suggest that HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors might have beneficial effects against respiratory inflammation.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><ref id="B1"><citation
