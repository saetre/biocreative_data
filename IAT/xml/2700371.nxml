Cby physically interacts with &#x003b2;-catenin to repress its activation of transcription. To elucidate the function of Cby in vertebrates, we generated <italic>Cby</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice and found that after 2&#x02013;3 d of weight loss, the majority of mice die before or around weaning. All <italic>Cby</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice develop rhinitis and sinusitis. When challenged with <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> isolates, <italic>Cby</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice are unable to clear the bacteria from the nasal cavity. Notably, <italic>Cby</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice exhibit a complete absence of mucociliary transport caused by a marked paucity of motile cilia in the nasal epithelium. Moreover, ultrastructural experiments reveal impaired basal body docking to the apical surface of multiciliated cells. In support of these phenotypes, endogenous Cby protein is localized at the base of cilia. As the phenotypes of <italic>Cby</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice bear striking similarities to primary ciliary dyskinesia, <italic>Cby</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice may prove to be a useful model for this condition.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p>Chibby (Cby) was originally discovered as an inhibitor of the Wnt&#x02013;&#x003b2;-catenin pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Takemaru et al., 2003</xref>). Cby inhibits Wnt&#x02013;&#x003b2;-catenin signaling through two distinct mechanisms: by competing with T cell factor/lymphoid-enhancer factor transcription factors for binding &#x003b2;-catenin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Takemaru et al., 2003</xref>) and by facilitating nuclear export of &#x003b2;-catenin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Li et al., 2008</xref>). Another study demonstrated that Cby also functions in the cytoplasm as a binding partner and a mediator of intracellular trafficking of Polycystin-2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Hidaka et al., 2004</xref>), which is a protein required for the proper function of primary cilia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Nauli et al., 2003</xref>). Interestingly, Polycystin-2 is also found in the membrane of motile cilia, suggesting that it may be important for the function of this distinct subclass of cilia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Pazour et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Teilmann et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Christensen et al., 2007</xref>).</p><p>Cilia are eukaryotic organelles that are traditionally classified according to their microtubule composition, with the 9 + 0 arrangements in primary cilia and the 9 + 2 arrangements in motile cilia, although this classification is an oversimplification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Kramer-Zucker et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Ong and Wagner, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Davis et al., 2006</xref>). Primary cilia are present on most mammalian cells and play critical roles in mechanosensation, photoreception, olfaction, and intracellular signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Singla and Reiter, 2006</xref>). Motile cilia are less ubiquitous and are found primarily in epithelial cells lining the airways, reproductive tracts, and the ependyma and choroid plexus in the brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Eley et al., 2005</xref>). They are important in clearing mucus and debris from the airway, circulating cerebrospinal fluid in the brain, and possibly transporting the cumulus&#x02013;oocyte complex in the female reproductive tract (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Salathe, 2007</xref>). Defects in motile cilia lead to a wide spectrum of phenotypes, including abnormal left&#x02013;right patterning, infertility, hydrocephalus, and respiratory infections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Badano et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Salathe, 2007</xref>). Various combinations of these phenotypes are present in multiple diseases, including primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Badano et al., 2006</xref>).</p><p>PCD, which includes Kartagener syndrome and the immotile cilia syndrome, is a rare genetically heterogeneous disorder with an estimated prevalence rate of 1 in 15,000 to 1 in 60,000, although the number of diagnosed cases is lower as a result of variability in symptoms and similarity to acquired conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Coren et al., 2002</xref>). The most common genetic causes of PCD are mutations in the human <italic>DNAI1</italic> and <italic>DNAH5</italic> genes, which encode outer dynein arm components (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Pennarun et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Olbrich et al., 2002</xref>). Mutations in these genes are responsible for up to 40% of the known cases of PCD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Zariwala et al., 2007</xref>). A small percentage of patients with PCD were reported to have mutations in <italic>DNAH11</italic>, <italic>TXNDC3</italic>, <italic>RPGR</italic>, or the <italic>OFD1</italic> gene, whereas other causative genes remain unidentified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bush and Ferkol, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Livraghi and Randell, 2007</xref>). Recurrent respiratory infections, chronic otitis media, and partially penetrant situs inversus are the hallmarks of PCD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Meeks and Bush, 2000</xref>). Mortality and morbidity associated with PCD are primarily caused by repeated infections resulting in respiratory insufficiency.</p><p>The lesions of PCD highlight the importance of efficient mucociliary clearance, which depends on mucus production and mucociliary transport (MCT). In the normal airway, goblet cells produce mucus that traps particles and pathogens. Coordinated ciliary beating transports mucus and embedded particles toward the larynx to be swallowed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Cohen, 2006</xref>). In patients with PCD, abnormal motility of airway cilia leads to an inability to transport mucus. Mucus plaques obstruct the airway and serve as a nidus for many opportunistic bacteria, including <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic>.</p><p>In this study, we describe germline inactivation of the <italic>Cby</italic> gene and the resulting respiratory phenotype, which is similar to the clinical features observed in PCD patients. <italic>Cby</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice develop upper respiratory infections and are unable to clear bacteria because of the absence of MCT. We show that the MCT defects result, at least in part, from a marked paucity of motile cilia in the nasal epithelium possibly caused by the abnormal transport or docking of basal bodies to the apical membrane. In agreement with this phenotype, we demonstrate that Cby is normally localized at the base of the cilia in cultured MDCK2 cells and in nasal epithelial tissue. The perturbation of cilia and the corresponding effects on MCT render <italic>Cby</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice particularly suitable for studies of PCD and other chronic upper respiratory diseases.</p></sec><sec><title>Results and discussion</title><sec><title><italic>Cby</italic> expression</title><p>We first characterized the expression of mouse <italic>Cby</italic> in embryonic day (E) 9.5&#x02013;11.5 embryos by whole mount in situ hybridization analysis using a probe specific for the <italic>Cby</italic> coding region.

As previously mentioned, abnormal airway cilia structure or motility underlies PCD phenotypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Livraghi and Randell, 2007</xref>). In contrast, human patients with CF caused by mutations in the CF transmembrane conductance regulator exhibit abnormal ion and water transport secondary to defects in Cl<sup>&#x02212;</sup> conductance. This leads to depletion of the periciliary aqueous layer in the respiratory system with accumulation of abnormally viscous mucus that adheres to the epithelial surfaces and cannot be transported by cilia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Livraghi and Randell, 2007</xref>).</p><p>To address potential ion channel deficiencies in <italic>Cby</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice, we determined Na<sup>+</sup> absorption in response to amiloride and Cl<sup>&#x02212;</sup> secretion in response to UTP and forskolin in tracheas from <italic>Cby</italic><sup>+/+</sup> and <italic>Cby</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice.

This is especially evident when <italic>Cby</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice are exposed to bacterial challenge, exacerbating the already inflamed state of their upper airway.

Once the skin and fascia were stripped from the soft palate, the very thin ventral wall of the nasopharyngeal meatus became evident, and the beating cilia on the apical side of the membrane were seen clearing debris caudally. Next, water-equilibrated mineral oil was applied to the membrane to prevent desiccation. As the cilia are on the opposite side of the membrane (and the nasopharyngeal meatus is not actually opened), the mineral oil did not contact the cilia.

When the data were reduced, the video monitor was calibrated for distance using the recorded image of the slide micrometer.
