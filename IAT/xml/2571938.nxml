We show that a key chemokine, CXCL12 (stromal cell&#x02013;derived factor 1&#x003b1;), redirects the polarization of effector Th1 cells into CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>CD25<sup>&#x02212;</sup>Foxp3<sup>&#x02212;</sup>interleukin (IL) 10<sup>high</sup> antigen-specific regulatory T cells in a CXCR4-dependent manner, and by doing so acts as a regulatory mediator restraining the autoimmune inflammatory process. In an attempt to explore the therapeutic implication of these findings, we have generated a CXCL12-immunoglobulin (Ig) fusion protein that, when administered during ongoing EAE, rapidly suppresses the disease in wild-type but not IL-10&#x02013;deficient mice. Anti&#x02013;IL-10 neutralizing antibodies could reverse this suppression. The beneficial effect included selection of antigen-specific T cells that were CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>CD25<sup>&#x02212;</sup>Foxp3<sup>&#x02212;</sup>IL-10<sup>high</sup>, which could adoptively transfer disease resistance, and suppression of Th17 selection. However, in vitro functional analysis of these cells suggested that, even though CXCL12-Ig&#x02013;induced tolerance is IL-10 dependent, IL-10&#x02013;independent mechanisms may also contribute to their regulatory function. Collectively, our results not only demonstrate, for the first time, that a chemokine functions as a regulatory mediator, but also suggest a novel way for treating multiple sclerosis and possibly other inflammatory autoimmune diseases.</p></abstract></article-meta><notes><fn-group><fn><p>Abbreviations used: CNS, central nervous system; EAE, experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis; MOG, myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein; MS, multiple sclerosis; PI, propidium iodide; SDF-1&#x003b1;, stromal cell&#x02013;derived factor 1&#x003b1;.</p></fn><fn><p>M.

Members of this molecular superfamily share structural similarities, including four conserved cysteine residues that form disulphide bonds, which are crucial to the tertiary structures. Chemokines can be divided into four subclasses: the C, C-C, C-X-C, and C-X3-C chemokines, depending on the location of the first two cysteine residues in their protein sequence. The interaction of these soluble proteins with their specific receptors mediates their biological effects. Most of the attention has been devoted to elucidating the key role of these mediators in inflammatory processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">2</xref>), with special interest in inflammatory autoimmune diseases, mainly multiple sclerosis (MS) and its experimental models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">4</xref>). Except for their role in inflammatory diseases, chemokines are also involved in allergic responses and cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">5</xref>).</p><p>The CXC chemokine CXCL12 (stromal cell&#x02013;derived factor 1&#x003b1; [SDF-1&#x003b1;]) was originally identified as a growth factor for mouse pre&#x02013;B cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">7</xref>). CXCL12 is constitutively expressed by various cells and tissues, and exhibits chemoattractive activity for monocytes, bone marrow neutrophils, and early stage B cell precursors. It is also a highly efficient and potent chemoattractant for T cells, as well as a co-stimulator of their activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">8</xref>). Furthermore, CXCL12 induces the adhesion of T cells to intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (CD54) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">9</xref>) by up-regulating the binding activity of lymphocyte function-associated antigen 1 (CD11a/CD18), and also modulates the &#x003b1;4-&#x003b2;7 integrin&#x02013;mediated lymphocyte adhesion to mucosal addressin cell adhesion molecule 1 and fibronectin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">10</xref>). As a result of these activities, it is thought to play an important role in the attraction of T cells into specific sites. In addition to these observations, CXCL12 has been associated with the regulation of rheumatoid arthritis and nephritis in a mouse lupus model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">12</xref>). Interestingly, this chemokine is preferentially expressed in the healthy central nervous system (CNS), where it also serves as a survival and migratory factor for neuronal and oligodendrocyte precursors that express CXCR4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">13</xref>).</p><p>Experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) is an experimentally induced autoimmune disease of the CNS that serves as an animal model for MS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">14</xref>). The expression of CXCL12 within the CNS was found to be up-regulated in the MS brain, particularly by astrocytes, which are likely to attract dendritic cells, macrophages, and T cells to the perivascular areas of the CNS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">17</xref>). This motivated us to explore the role of this chemokine in the regulation of EAE and its clinical implications.</p><sec><title>RESULTS</title><sec><title>Neutralization of CXCL12 during ongoing EAE aggravates its manifestation</title><p>We first explored the possibility that the endogenously produced CXCL12 participates in the natural regulation of disease. To test this hypothesis, EAE mice were administered with a mAb to CXCL12, or an isotype-matched control IgG, after the onset of disease. Our results (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>) indicate that these mice, but not those administered with the control antibodies, developed an exacerbated, long-term form of disease (mean maximal score of 3 &#x000b1; 0.28 vs. 2.166 &#x000b1; 0.18 in both control groups; P &#x0003c; 0.03). The data shown represent one out of three experiments with very similar observations. These results suggest that CXCL12 may function as an antiinflammatory chemokine in regulating an ongoing disease.</p><fig position="float" id="fig1"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p><bold>Neutralization of CXCL12 during ongoing EAE aggravates ongoing EAE.</bold> C57BL/6 female mice (<italic>n</italic> &#x0003d; 6 per group) were subjected to active induction of MOG<sub>p35-55</sub>-induced EAE, and at the onset of disease (day 10) were separated into three equally sick groups (<italic>n</italic> &#x0003d; 6 mice per group).

We explored the possibility that this chemokine functions as a potential regulatory and antiinflammatory mediator. At first, rCXCL12 was added, in different concentrations, to primary spleen cells isolated from EAE mice that were cultured with their target antigen (myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein [MOG]<sub>p35-55</sub>). <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 A</xref> shows that supplementing these cultured cells with this chemokine induced an increase in IL-10 production (P &#x0003c; 0.01 in cultures supplemented with 100 ng/ml CXCL12), and at the same time a significant decrease in IL-12 and TNF-&#x003b1; production (P &#x0003c; 0.01 in cultures supplemented with 100 ng/ml CXCL12), all in a dose-dependent manner. Because the CXCR4 receptor is expressed on both CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells and macrophages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">1</xref>), we determined the direct effect of this chemokine on the production of various cytokines in each cell type separately. Initially, rCXCL12 was added in different concentrations to freshly isolated, LPS-activated peritoneal macrophages, and the effect on the production of various key cytokines was determined 48 h later. A dose-dependent increase in IL-10 production and, at the same time, a decrease in TNF-&#x003b1; and IL-12 were recorded (P &#x0003c; 0.01 in cultures supplemented with 100 ng/ml CXCL12 for all comparisons; <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 B</xref>). To determine whether CXCL12 directly affects IL-10 production by CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells, we isolated and purified CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells from spleens of naive C57BL/6 mice (MACS beads) and subjected them to anti-CD3&#x02013;induced activation in the presence of CXCL12. <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 C</xref> shows a significant, dose-dependent elevation in IL-10 production (P &#x0003c; 0.01 in cultures supplemented with 100 ng/ml CXCL12), accompanied by a significant reduction in TNF-&#x003b1; (P &#x0003c; 0.01 in cultures supplemented with 100 ng/ml CXCL12), and a dose-dependent increase in IL-2 production (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 C</xref>). The increased production of IL-2 may suggest that the increased production of IL-10 results, in part, because of the differential proliferation of IL-10&#x02013;producing cells, but it cannot explain the reduced levels of TNF-&#x003b1; produced by the cultured cells. These results may thus suggest a possible role for this chemokine as a regulatory mediator, and they motivated us to determine its potential use for the treatment of ongoing EAE.</p><fig position="float" id="fig2"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><p><bold>CXCL12 directs the functional polarization of macrophages and T cells into high IL-10, low inflammatory mediator&#x02013;producing cells.</bold> (A&#x02013;C) CXCL12 was added at different concentrations to primary whole spleen culture taken from EAE mice and stimulated with their target MOG<sub>p35-55</sub> antigen for 72 h (A), freshly isolated peritoneal macrophages stimulated with 0.5 &#x003bc;g/ml LPS for 48 h (B), or purified naive CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells activated with anti-CD3/anti-CD28 for 48 h (C).

To overcome this, we adopted the strategy of generating Ig-based fusion proteins and constructed a chimeric protein composed of CXCL12 fused to IgG1 (Fc). The fusion protein was expressed as a disulphide-linked homodimer, similar to IgG1, and it had a molecular mass of &#x0223c;72 kD, consisting of two identical 36-kD subunits (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 A</xref>). Next, we determined whether our CXCL12-Ig maintains the functional properties of the chemokine, including its ability to attract human THP-1 monocytic cell line cells (P &#x0003c; 0.001; <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 B</xref>), as well as Jurkat cells (not depicted), in a Transwell system. CXCL12-Ig was also tested for its ability to elicit IL-10 production in LPS-activated peritoneal macrophages (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 C</xref>), and in primary T cells undergoing antigen-specific in vitro activation (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 D</xref>).

As CXCR4 exclusively mediates CXCL12-induced migration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">19</xref>), we first determined the optimal concentration of AMD3100 that completely blocked CXCL12-induced migration of anti-CD3&#x02013;activated naive T cells. <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 E</xref> shows that at AMD3100 concentrations &#x0003e;50 nM, CXCL12-induced migration of anti-CD3&#x02013;activated T cells was entirely blocked.

We then determined whether the addition of 100 nM AMD3100 could block the increase in IL-10 production induced by CXCL12 in these cells. We clearly show that blocking CXCR4 completely reversed IL-10 production induced by CXCL12 (879 &#x000b1; 34 vs. 413 &#x000b1; 28 pg/ml; <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 F</xref>) but not IL-2 production (3,153 &#x000b1; 158 vs. 3,353 &#x000b1; 226 pg/ml; <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 G</xref>), indicating the pivotal role of CXCR4 in IL-10 production by these cells.</p><p>We then explored the ability of this fusion protein to suppress ongoing EAE. <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 A</xref> shows that repeated administration of this fusion protein, but not of a control fusion protein comprised from soluble &#x003b2;-actin&#x02013;Ig, could effectively and rapidly suppress the disease.

Immunohistochemical analysis of representative sections revealed high IL-10 expression in spleen sections from CXCL12-Ig&#x02013;treated mice (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5 A</xref>). Intracellular flow cytometry analysis, conducted on samples of cultured cells from these groups, clearly showed a significant increase in IL-10<sup>high</sup> CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells (4.2 vs. 1.1 and 0.9%, respectively; <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5 B</xref>), as well as in IL-10<sup>high</sup> CD14<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> macrophages/dendritic cells (7.7 vs. 4.8 and 4.9%, respectively) in the CXCL12-Ig&#x02013;treated mice. T cells from donors treated with protective CXCL12-Ig or &#x003b2;-actin&#x02013;Ig were then administered to mice suffering from active EAE. After antigen-specific activation, these cells were administered to EAE recipients (just after the onset of disease). <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5 C</xref> shows that although the administration of spleen cells from EAE donors, treated with &#x003b2;-actin&#x02013;Ig, aggravated the severity of disease (day 18 mean score of 5 &#x000b1; 0 vs. 3 &#x000b1; 0.26; P &#x0003c; 0.01), the administration of spleen cells from CXCL12-Ig&#x02013;treated mice led to a rapid recovery (day 18 mean score of 0 &#x000b1; 0; P &#x0003c; 0.001).

It is likely that in healthy individuals endogenous CXCL12, produced by various resident cells within the CNS, is involved in modulating the migration of leukocytes that are essential for the regular &#x0201c;policing&#x0201d; of this partially immune-privileged area. The development of progressive multifocal leucoencephalopathy after anti&#x02013;very late antigen 4 therapy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">23</xref>) may serve as an example for the importance of such policing of the CNS by T cells and macrophages. Our earlier working hypothesis was therefore that CXCL12 functions as a proinflammatory chemokine and, as such, neutralization of its activity during ongoing EAE would be beneficial for the host. Our data show that the administration of anti-CXCL12 antibodies aggravated EAE (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>), which motivated us to revise our working hypothesis. We show in this paper that a chemokine may function as an antiinflammatory mediator, which not only attracts T cells to the site of inflammation but also polarizes them, including inflammatory Th1 cells, into antiinflammatory regulatory T cells.</p><p>Depending on their cytokine profile, the CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells can be categorized into different subsets, including (a) Th1 cells that produce large amounts of IFN-&#x003b3; and TNF-&#x003b1; and low levels of IL-4; (b) Th2 cells that mostly produce IL-4, IL-5, and IL-13, and to a much lesser extent, IFN-&#x003b3; and TNF-&#x003b1; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">24</xref>); (c) Th3 cells producing high levels of TGF-&#x003b2; and to a much lesser extent other cytokines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">25</xref>); and (d) Tr1 cells that produce high levels of IL-10 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">26</xref>), CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>CD25<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> regulatory T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">28</xref>), and the recently defined Th17 cells, selected in the presence of IL-6 and TGF-&#x003b2; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">29</xref>), and that in response to IL-23 produce high levels of the inflammatory cytokine IL-17 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">30</xref>). The inflammatory process during EAE is driven by at least two types of effector cells: the newly discovered IL-17&#x02013;producing Th17 cells, and the IFN-&#x003b3;&#x02013; and TNF-&#x003b1;&#x02013;producing Th1 cells. Of these effector cell subtypes, the Th17 cells are likely to be more potent initiators of the inflammatory process in the CNS than Th1 cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">31</xref>). Their activity is later suppressed, in part by IFN-&#x003b3;, which is largely produced by Th1 cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">33</xref>). Although IL-12 is involved in selecting Th1 cells, IL-23 has been reported to be dominant in selecting Th17 cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">35</xref>). We show a significant reduction in the levels of both IL-23, which drives Th17 polarization, and IL-12, which promotes Th1 polarization (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>) after CXCL12-Ig therapy. This may well explain the significant reduction in IL-17 and TNF-&#x003b1; in primary cultures (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>), and the function of CXCL12 as an antiinflammatory chemokine. Several studies have previously shown that by altering their Th1/Th2 balance, C-C chemokines may affect the polarization of antigen-specific T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">36</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">38</xref>). In addition to these studies, we have shown that of the three CXCR3 ligands&#x02014;CXCL9, CXCL10, and CXCL11&#x02014;only CXCL10 directs the polarization of antigen-specific T cells into Th1 cells, and therefore its neutralization effectively suppresses EAE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">39</xref>) and adjuvant-induced arthritis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">40</xref>). Our recent observations suggest that CXCL11, which effectively competes with CXCL10 in binding their common CXCR3 receptor, antagonizes this function, and thus acts as an antiinflammatory chemokine (unpublished data). The possibility that CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>CD25<sup>&#x02212;</sup>Foxp3<sup>&#x02212;</sup> Th1 cells could potentially be converted into IL-10&#x02013;producing regulatory T cells has been very recently raised by Anderson et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">41</xref>), showing that Th1 cells redirect their polarization during chronic cutaneous leishmaniasis (for review see O'Garra and Vieira [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">42</xref>]). We show in this paper, for the first time, that a chemokine may alter the polarization of antigen-specific effector Th1 cells into IL-10&#x02013;producing T cells. This may explain the rapid effect of CXCL12-Ig therapy on ongoing EAE (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4, A and D</xref>), and it could also suggest a novel way of targeted cell therapy in which effector T cells from patients are being activated in vitro in the presence of CXCL12-Ig and returned back to the patient.</p><p>The current study shows, for the first time, that a well-defined chemokine functions as a regulatory mediator during the course of diseases in two complementary ways: (a) down-regulation of inflammatory cytokine production and up-regulation of IL-10 production in macrophages, and (b) selection of IL-10&#x02013;producing regulatory T cells capable of transferring the beneficial effect of therapy (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figs. 5</xref> and <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>). Both mechanisms are related because IL-10 directly suppresses proinflammatory mediator production by activated macrophages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">43</xref>). To determine whether disease suppression is mostly IL-10 dependent, we have conducted three sets of experiments. The first shows that primary T cells from protected mice suppress the MOG<sub>p35-55</sub>-specific proliferative response of primary T cells from EAE donors in an IL-10&#x02013;dependent manner (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5 F</xref>). The second shows that IL-10&#x02013;deficient mice, which develop a more severe form of disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">44</xref>), are resistant to CXCL12-Ig&#x02013;induced therapy (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5 G, a and b</xref>), whereas the third experiment shows that disease suppression, induced by CXCL12-Ig, could be reversed in vivo by anti&#x02013;IL-10 antibodies (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5 G, c</xref>). These experiments are complementary and emphasize the pivotal role of IL-10 and IL-10&#x02013;producing regulatory T cells in disease suppression. Nevertheless, as IL-10 neutralization could not fully recover the ability of antigen-specific regulatory T cells, selected in CXCL12-Ig&#x02013;treated mice, to inhibit effector T cell proliferation (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5 F</xref>), it is plausible that other mechanisms that are IL-10 independent also contribute to their function. This issue is further discussed in the last paragraph of this section.</p><p>An alternative interpretation for our data could be that by creating a strong chemokine gradient, which could potentially direct activated T cells away from the CNS, the trafficking of inflammatory cells into the CNS may be altered. This effect might also exist in addition to the selection of IL-10&#x02013;producing regulatory T cells and IL-10&#x02013;producing macrophages. However, the results showing that CXCL12-Ig exerts no therapeutic effect on IL-10<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5 G</xref>) emphasize the IL-10&#x02013;dependent function of this chemokine as its major, but not necessarily exclusive, mechanism of action.</p><p>The function of CXCL12 as a regulatory mediator that suppresses immune activity extends beyond the regulation of inflammation and inflammatory autoimmune diseases. More specifically, this chemokine is preferentiality produced by various cancer cells and, therefore, serves as a potential target for treating these diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">45</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">46</xref>). It has been previously proposed that this chemokine assists in suppressing immunity against ovarian cancer by attracting myeloid dendritic cells that produce IL-10 at the tumor site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">47</xref>). Our results show that CXCL12 is not only involved in attracting antigen-presenting cells and T cells but also in directing their antiinflammatory properties, and may also explain how tumors that largely produce CXCL12 escape antitumor immunity.</p><p>At least two different receptors bind CXCL12 on macrophages and T cells, CXCR4 and CXCR7 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">19</xref>). Of these receptors, only CXCR4 mediates CXCL12-induced migration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">19</xref>). We show in this paper that the blockade of CXCR4 completely blocked CXCL12-induced production of IL-10, and thereby the selection of antigen-specific IL-10&#x02013;producing regulatory T cells. Recently, McCandless et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">48</xref>) showed that in vivo administration of the CXCR4 antagonist AMD3100 affects the mobilization of hematopoietic precursor cells to the CNS, thus aggravating EAE. Our data clearly show that a major role of CXCR4 in the regulation of EAE is to direct CXCL12-induced IL-10 production by CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells and macrophages, and by so doing to select antigen-specific regulatory T cells that transfer disease resistance.</p><p>Notably, in vivo administration of CXCL12 significantly increased IL-10 but not IL-4 production in primary T cells (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>). Yet in vitro selection in the presence of CXCL12-Ig also led to the selection of IL-4&#x02013;producing Th2 cells (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6 A</xref>) and an elevated level of IL-4 (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6 B</xref>). It is thus plausible that CXCL12, as an antiinflammatory chemokine, is also involved in directing the Th1/Th2 balance in favor of Th2. However under our in vivo conditions this type of selection is not dominant, as it is under in vitro selective conditions.</p><p>We have previously shown that IL-10&#x02013;producing Tr1 cells participate in the regulation of EAE, including limiting the consequences of disease during determinant spread, and that administering the soluble form of the target determinant leading to the spread amplifies this beneficial function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">49</xref>). Based on this study and the present one, we suggest that a combined therapy that would include soluble peptide therapy together with CXCL12-Ig could be considered. Such a therapeutic approach may be useful for rapidly selecting antigen-specific regulatory T cells that would provide selective tolerance. One should not ignore the possibility that because of its role in attracting T cells and monocytes for the regular &#x0201c;policing&#x0201d; of the CNS, a targeted expression of CXCL12 in the CNS at preclinical stages of MS might increase the recruitment of inflammatory cells into the CNS, and thus put in risk patients subjected to CXCL12-Ig&#x02013;based therapy. However, it is likely that, at that particular stage of the disease, the blood&#x02013;brain barrier is not activated enough to allow the entry of molecules as large as CXCL12-Ig into the CNS.</p><p>Finally, if the suppressive effect of CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells from protected donors is solely mediated by IL-10, why then does simply adding rIL-10 to effector T cell cultures not mediate the same suppression as shown in <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5 F</xref>? (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">50</xref>) Moreover, if this suppression was solely directed by IL-10, then antibodies to IL-10 could completely reverse the suppressive effect of regulatory T cells in mixed culture experiments. It is therefore likely that even though IL-10 is a dominant mediator of the regulatory function of CD25<sup>&#x02212;</sup>Foxp3<sup>&#x02212;</sup>IL-10<sup>high</sup> CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells, and that anti&#x02013;IL-10 antibodies reverse the in vivo therapeutic effect of CXCL12-Ig, other yet to be identified mechanisms also contribute to their suppressive function.</p><p>Our data, showing that on one hand IL-10<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice are resistant to CXCL12-Ig based therapy (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5 G, a and b</xref>) and anti&#x02013;IL-10 antibodies reverse tolerance in CXCL12-Ig treated mice (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5 G, c</xref>), whereas IL-10, even though a key player in CXCL12-induced tolerance, is not the solitary mean by which IL-10&#x02013;producing regulatory T cells, selected by CXCL12-Ig, suppress effector T cell activity (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5 F</xref>), are conflicting. These observations strongly suggest that IL-10, even though being a major component in IL-10&#x02013;producing regulatory T cell&#x02013;induced tolerance, is not solely responsible for the protection induced by these cells, and that other mechanisms, yet to be identified, contribute to their function. It is likely that the dynamics of EAE result from the balance between proinflammatory activities and antiinflammatory activities, some of which are directed by CXCL12 that selects IL-10&#x02013;producing regulatory T cells to suppress inflammation by various means. Thus, the blockade of the IL-10&#x02013;directed suppression does not eradicate all IL-10&#x02013;producing regulatory T cell activities, but it is sufficient to shift the antiinflammatory/inflammatory balance and reverse CXCL12-induced tolerance.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec disp-level="3"><title>Mice.</title><p>6-wk-old female C57BL/6 mice were purchased from Harlan and were maintained under specific pathogen-free conditions in our animal facility.</p><p>Breeders of IL-10<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> C57BL/6 mice were purchased from the Jackson Laboratory, from which our colony was set under pathogen-free conditions.
