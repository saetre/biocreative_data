UvsY, the phage recombination mediator protein, promotes filament assembly in a concentration-dependent manner, stimulating UvsX at stoichiometric concentrations but inhibiting at higher concentrations. Recent work demonstrated that UvsX-H195Q/A mutants exhibit decreased ssDNA-binding affinity and altered enzymatic properties. Here, we show that unlike wild-type UvsX, the ssDNA-dependent ATPase activities of UvsX-H195Q/A are strongly inhibited by both low and high concentrations of UvsY protein. This inhibition is partially relieved by UvsY mutants with decreased ssDNA-binding affinity. The UvsX-H195Q mutant retains weak DNA strand exchange activity that is inhibited by wild-type UvsY, but stimulated by ssDNA-binding compromised UvsY mutants. These and other results support a mechanism in which the formation of competent presynaptic filaments requires a hand-off of ssDNA from UvsY to UvsX, with the efficiency of the hand-off controlled by the relative ssDNA-binding affinities of the two proteins. Other results suggest that UvsY acts as a nucleotide exchange factor for UvsX, enhancing filament stability by increasing the lifetime of the high-affinity, ATP-bound form of the enzyme. Our findings reveal new details of the UvsX/UvsY relationship in T4 recombination, which may have parallels in other recombinase/mediator systems.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Recombinases of the highly conserved RecA/Rad51 family catalyze DNA strand exchange reactions that are of central importance in pathways of homologous recombination and DNA double-strand break repair. DNA strand exchange requires the formation of a presynaptic filament consisting of recombinase cooperatively bound to single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>). Presynaptic filament assembly is necessary to activate enzymatic activities of RecA/Rad51 including ssDNA-stimulated ATP hydrolysis, homologous pairing and strand transfer. Defects in presynaptic filament assembly cause genome instability and sensitivity to DNA-damaging agents in all organisms, and are associated with cancer predisposition in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2 B3 B4 B5">2&#x02013;5</xref>).</p><p>The assembly and stability of recombinase&#x02013;ssDNA presynaptic filaments are regulated by recombination mediator proteins (RMPs) and ssDNA-binding proteins (SSBs), both of which are highly conserved at the functional level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>). The assembly of recombinase onto SSB-covered ssDNA is rate limiting in many recombination processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>). The RMP component stimulates DNA strand exchange by accelerating SSB displacement from ssDNA by the incoming recombinase.</p><p>Studies of the bacteriophage T4 recombination system have provided important insights on the biochemical interactions between recombinase, RMP and SSB components during presynapsis and strand exchange (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>). UvsX protein, the RecA/Rad51 ortholog of T4 phage, catalyzes ssDNA-stimulated ATP hydrolysis and DNA strand exchange. UvsX ssDNA-stimulated ATPase activity is unusual in that both ADP and AMP are generated as products (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>), a property unique among characterized recombinases. UvsY, the phage RMP, stimulates UvsX activities by promoting filament assembly and displacement of Gp32, the phage SSB. <italic>In vitro</italic>, UvsY is absolutely required for strand exchange along with UvsX and Gp32 under salt conditions that approximate <italic>in vivo</italic> ionic strength. <italic>In vivo</italic>, <italic>uvsY</italic> and <italic>uvsX</italic> mutants are equally deficient in recombination and repair functions, indicating that the mediator activity of UvsY is essential for UvsX biological function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12 B13 B14 B15">12&#x02013;15</xref>). Previous work demonstrated that UvsY destabilizes Gp32&#x02013;ssDNA interactions while stabilizing UvsX&#x02013;ssDNA interactions; data indicate that UvsY alters ssDNA structure in ways that favor UvsX binding and disfavor Gp32 binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16 B17 B18 B19 B20">16&#x02013;20</xref>).</p><p>Recently, our laboratory characterized missense mutants of UvsX that dramatically alter its enzymatic properties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>). UvsX-H195Q and -H195A mutants exhibit reduced DNA strand exchange activity, altered ssDNA-stimulated ATPase activity and reduced ssDNA-binding affinity compared to wild-type. We hypothesized that UvsY protein might restore wild-type-like activity to these mutants by stabilizing their filaments on ssDNA. In this report we demonstrate that, surprisingly, the opposite is true. Unlike wild-type UvsX, both mutants are strongly inhibited by UvsY protein. Their defects are partially complemented, however, by mutations in UvsY protein that reduce its ssDNA-binding affinity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>). These and other results suggest that the formation of competent presynaptic filaments requires a hand-off of ssDNA from UvsY to UvsX, with the efficiency of the hand-off controlled by the relative ssDNA-binding affinities of the two proteins. Other data suggest that UvsY promotes nucleotide exchange by UvsX protein, an activity that may be important for the observed stabilization of UvsX interactions by UvsY. Our findings provide new insights on the relationships between recombinases and recombination mediators, and on the mechanism of the presynaptic phase of homologous recombination.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Reagents and enzymes</title><p>Chemicals, biochemicals and enzymes were purchased from Sigma unless otherwise noted.

Activity increases with increasing UvsY concentration until a sharp optimum activity is reached at a UvsY:UvsX molar ratio of approximately 1:1. Further increases in UvsY concentration cause activity to decrease and high concentrations are inhibitory. These results are consistent with previous reports of UvsY concentration optima in T4 recombination processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>). UvsY has a dramatically different effect on the ssDNA-stimulated ATPase activities of UvsX-H195Q and -H195A mutants. Both activities decline precipitously with increasing UvsY concentration, and there are no concentration optima (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>). Clearly, UvsX-H195Q/A mutants have lost the ability to be stimulated by UvsY, which now acts as their strict inhibitor. <fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p>UvsY effects on ssDNA-dependent ATPase activities of UvsX, UvsX-H195A and UvsX-H195Q.

UvsY stimulates ADP production by UvsX in a highly concentration-dependent manner with an optimum at approximately 1:1 molar ratio of UvsY:UvsX (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>A). Higher UvsY concentrations are inhibitory. At the same time, UvsY strongly suppresses AMP production by UvsX (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>B). As a result, UvsY also affects the ADP/AMP product ratio of UvsX ssDNA-stimulated ATP hydrolysis in a concentration-dependent manner. This ratio increases from approximately 5&#x02013;7 with no UvsY to approximately 25&#x02013;30 at optimum UvsY before falling again at higher UvsY concentrations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>C). Therefore, the presence of stoichiometric UvsY greatly increases the specificity of UvsX for catalyzing the ATP &#x02192;ADP reaction as opposed to the ATP &#x02192; AMP reaction. The implications of this finding for presynaptic filament dynamics are discussed in a later section. <fig id="F2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><p>Effects of wild-type and mutant UvsY proteins on ADP and AMP production by UvsX ssDNA-dependent ATPase activity.

At salt concentrations relevant to UvsX/UvsY-dependent DNA strand exchange, the order of relative ssDNA-binding affinities is wild-type (UvsY-wt) &#x0003e; UvsY-K58A (&#x02018;single mutant&#x02019; or UvsY-SM) &#x0003e; UvsY-K58A,R60A (&#x02018;double mutant&#x02019; or UvsY-DM). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref> shows that substitution of UvsY-SM or -DM mutants for wild-type has a major effect on UvsX ATPase profiles. UvsY-SM has a much broader concentration optima than wild-type UvsY for stimulating ADP production by UvsX (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>A). Therefore, ADP production increases with increasing UvsY-SM concentration and remains high, and the inhibition of UvsX observed at high UvsY concentrations is not observed with UvsY-SM. Nor is inhibition observed with UvsY-DM, which with increasing concentration gradually increases ADP production by UvsX (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>A). Thus, &#x02018;KARL&#x02019; motif mutations relieve the inhibition of UvsX ADP production caused by high UvsY concentrations. These mutations also relieve the inhibition of UvsX AMP production caused by wild-type UvsY (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>B). The relief is partial in the case of UvsY-SM and full in the case of UvsY-DM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>B). As a result, the ADP/AMP product ratio of UvsX ssDNA-stimulated ATP hydrolysis responds to UvsY-SM and UvsY-DM concentrations very differently compared to wild-type UvsY (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>C). The ADP/AMP ratio increases substantially but more gradually with increasing UvsY-SM than with increasing UvsY concentration, and it does not go through an optimum within the concentration range examined. Meanwhile the ADP/AMP ratio is virtually independent of UvsY-DM concentration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>C).</p><p>UvsY &#x02018;KARL&#x02019; motif mutations also partially relieve UvsY's inhibition of the ATPase activities of UvsX-H195Q/A mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>). ADP production by UvsX-H195A decreases with increasing concentrations of UvsY, UvsY-SM or UvsY-DM, but the severity of the inhibition decreases in the order UvsY &#x0003e; UvsY-SM &#x0003e; UvsY-DM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>A). A similar pattern occurs in reactions with UvsX-H195Q (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>B). Therefore, mutations that decrease UvsY ssDNA-binding affinity have the general effect of decreasing UvsY inhibitory effects on UvsX-catalyzed ATP hydrolysis, whether inhibition is caused by excessive UvsY concentration or by mutations that weaken UvsX&#x02013;ssDNA interactions. <fig id="F3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><p>Effects of wild-type and mutant UvsY proteins on ADP production by (<bold>A</bold>) UvsX-H195A mutant and (<bold>B</bold>) UvsX-H195Q mutant ssDNA-dependent ATPase activities.

Typical results are shown. Note that the reaction products are DNA &#x02018;aggregates&#x02019; that run at the top of the gel. These aggregates are a characteristic product of UvsX-catalyzed strand exchange, which generates branched networks of DNA caused by multiple synapsis events per DNA molecule (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>). The aggregates are not resolved by Proteinase K treatment (data not shown). The reactions in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref> were performed in the absence of Gp32 and under salt and protein concentration conditions in which UvsX strand exchange activity is UvsY dependent. This was verified in control reactions lacking UvsY protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>A, lanes 1&#x02013;4), in which no strand exchange products (DNA joint molecules or aggregates) and no consumption of RFIII substrate were observed after 30 min in reactions containing either UvsX, UvsX-H195A or UvsX-H195Q. The weak strand exchange activity of UvsX-H195Q (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>) is not detectable under these conditions. The addition of wild-type UvsY activates the strand exchange activity of UvsX (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>A, lanes 5&#x02013;8), but not that of UvsX-H195A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>A, lanes 9&#x02013;12) or of UvsX-H195Q (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>A, lanes 13&#x02013;16) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>B&#x02013;D).

Significantly, unlike wild-type UvsY, both UvsY-SM and UvsY-DM facilitate DNA strand exchange by the UvsX-H195Q mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>A, lanes 25&#x02013;28 and lanes 37&#x02013;40, respectively; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>C, D).

In contrast, both UvsY-SM and UvsY-DM fail to rescue strand exchange by the UvsX-H195A mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>A, lanes 21&#x02013;24 and lanes 33&#x02013;36, respectively; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>C, D).

Histidine-195 in UvsX protein is an allosteric switch residue analogous to glutamine-194 in <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> RecA protein, which coordinates ATP binding and hydrolysis activities with DNA binding and strand exchange (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>). The data demonstrate that the UvsX-H195A mutation completely uncouples ATP binding/hydrolysis from strand exchange, since the mutant enzyme retains strong ssDNA-stimulated ATPase activity but is devoid of strand exchange activity under all conditions examined (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figures 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>). The conservative UvsX-H195Q mutant retains strong ssDNA-stimulated ATPase activity as well as partial strand exchange activity. Both mutants have reduced apparent ssDNA-binding affinity compared to wild-type UvsX (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>), and unlike wild-type both proteins are inhibited by relatively low concentrations of UvsY (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>).</p><p>UvsY &#x02018;KARL&#x02019; motif mutant proteins&#x02014;UvsY-SM (K58A) and UvsY-DM (K58A + R60A) have strongly reduced ssDNA-binding affinity compared to wild-type, but retain wild-type-like self- and heteroprotein-association properties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>). UvsY-SM and UvsY-DM mutants retain partial recombination mediator protein activity in that both partially stimulate UvsX-catalyzed DNA strand exchange reactions in the presence of Gp32 [(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>) and this study] and both modestly stabilize UvsX&#x02013;ssDNA complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>). The residual mediator activities of UvsY-SM and UvsY-DM likely result from protein&#x02013;protein interactions with UvsX.</p><p>Results of this study, involving different combinations of UvsX and UvsY mutants and concentrations, demonstrate that correct assembly of presynaptic filaments requires an optimal balance between the ssDNA-binding activities of UvsX and UvsY. Conditions that strongly favor UvsY&#x02013; over UvsX&#x02013;ssDNA interactions, such as high UvsY/UvsX concentration ratios or UvsX-H195Q/A mutations, are generally inhibitory toward UvsX activity. These inhibitory effects are mitigated by UvsY-SM and UvsY-DM mutations, which exhibit functional complementation of UvsX-H195Q/A ssDNA-dependent ATPase and of UvsX-H195Q strand exchange activities <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figures 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>). UvsY-SM/-DM mutants also relieve the UvsY concentration-dependent inhibition of wild-type UvsX ssDNA-dependent ATPase activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>). Thus, it is possible to complement the effects of weak UvsX&#x02013;ssDNA interactions by weakening UvsY&#x02013;ssDNA interactions.</p><p>UvsY appears to modulate the ssDNA-binding activities of other proteins primarily by altering ssDNA structure, increasing UvsX&#x02013;ssDNA affinity while decreasing Gp32&#x02013;ssDNA affinity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16 B17 B18">16&#x02013;18</xref>). Results of this study imply that UvsX itself must possess sufficiently strong ssDNA-binding activity in order to capitalize on ssDNA structural changes induced by UvsY. High-affinity UvsY&#x02013;ssDNA interactions involve wrapping of ssDNA around UvsY hexamers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>). Previous studies demonstrated that UvsY co-occupies the ssDNA with either Gp32 or UvsX (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>). Thus, UvsY forms a stoichiometric UvsY&#x02013;Gp32&#x02013;ssDNA complex in which Gp32&#x02013;ssDNA interactions are weakened, but Gp32 is not displaced from the complex until UvsX and ATP are added (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>). Similarly, data indicate that stoichiometric UvsY is retained in the complex after UvsX binds and Gp32 is ejected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>). Therefore, our complementation data cannot be explained by a simple competition for ssDNA-binding sites between UvsX and UvsY mutants with different ssDNA-binding affinities. Instead, to explain the effects of mutations and protein concentration effects described in this work, we propose that there must be a hand-off mechanism in which the ssDNA wrapped around UvsY is passed to UvsX, and that the efficiency of the hand-off is governed by the relative affinities of the two proteins for ssDNA. This model is shown in schematic form in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>A. We postulate that UvsY&#x02013;ssDNA is in equilibrium between a tightly wrapped or &#x02018;closed&#x02019; complex and a loosely wrapped or &#x02018;open&#x02019; complex, and that the closed complex is favored at higher UvsY concentrations. UvsX cannot capture ssDNA from the closed complex, but it can capture ssDNA from the open complex, effectively pulling the closed/open equilibrium to the right, as shown in the step-wise mechanism at the top of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>A. UvsX mutants with weak ssDNA-binding affinity, such as H195Q or H195A, are unable to capture ssDNA from the open complex, so UvsY&#x02013;ssDNA remains closed. UvsY &#x02018;KARL&#x02019; motif mutations shift the closed/open equilibrium to the right, increasing the likelihood of ssDNA capture by UvsX mutants or at higher mediator concentrations. Alternatively, the hand-off of ssDNA from UvsY to UvsX might occur by a concerted mechanism as shown at the bottom of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>A. In this case, the efficiency of the hand-off would be determined by the amount of closed versus open character in a &#x02018;transition state&#x02019; containing both proteins and ssDNA. Changes in the relative ssDNA-binding affinities of UvsX and UvsY would determine the forward commitment of this &#x02018;transition state&#x02019;. <fig id="F6" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><p>Models for UvsY effects on UvsX&#x02013;ssDNA dynamics. (<bold>A</bold>) Formation of competent presynaptic filaments requires a hand-off of ssDNA from UvsY to UvsX, with the efficiency of the hand-off controlled by the relative ssDNA-binding affinities of the two proteins. A step-wise mechanism (upper path) is postulated in which UvsY hexamers interact with ssDNA to form a tightly wrapped &#x02018;closed&#x02019; complex in equilibrium with a loosely wrapped &#x02018;open&#x02019; complex. High UvsY concentrations shift the equilibrium toward the closed form that is inaccessible to UvsX protein. In contrast, UvsX captures ssDNA from the open complex, effectively shifting the closed/open equilibrium to the right. Mutations that weaken UvsX&#x02013;ssDNA interactions, such as H195Q/A, cannot capture ssDNA from the open complex. On the other hand, mutations that weaken UvsY&#x02013;ssDNA interactions, such as K58A/R60A, shift the closed/open equilibrium to the right, complementing UvsX mutations by allowing more efficient ssDNA hand-off and neutralizing the inhibitory effects of high UvsY concentrations. Alternatively, ssDNA hand-off could occur by a concerted mechanism as shown in the lower path. See text for additional details. (<bold>B</bold>) A hypothetical model for UvsY suppression of UvsX AMP production. Kinetics data indicate that ssDNA-bound UvsX hydrolyzes ATP to AMP via a processive, step-wise mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>). UvsY may short circuit this process, causing ADP to release from the active site prior to hydrolysis to AMP. UvsY may therefore act as a nucleotide exchange factor for UvsX&#x02013;ssDNA presynaptic filaments, and stimulate recombination by increasing the lifetime of UvsX in a high ssDNA-binding affinity state. See text for additional details.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="gkp096f6"/></fig></p><p>An alternative explanation for the inhibitory effects of high UvsY concentrations is that the excess UvsY could interfere with normal UvsX function through nonproductive protein&#x02013;protein interactions occurring off of the ssDNA. The data appear to rule out this possibility, however. Under this scenario, high concentrations of UvsY-SM or -DM mutants would be expected to be as inhibitory as wild-type UvsY toward UvsX, which is not the case (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>). Therefore, DNA-independent protein&#x02013;protein interactions do not appear to be an important inhibitory mechanism in this system. Similarly, the strictly inhibitory effects of wild-type UvsY on UvsX-H195Q/A mutants, even at relatively low UvsY concentrations, demonstrate that the negative effects of competing protein&#x02013;ssDNA interactions dominate any positive effects of protein&#x02013;protein interactions on UvsX mutant activities. We conclude that the relationship between UvsX and UvsY ssDNA-binding affinities is of primary importance in determining whether the mediator stimulates or inhibits recombinase activities.</p><p>The postulated &#x02018;closed&#x02019; and &#x02018;open&#x02019; UvsY&#x02013;ssDNA complexes have not been observed directly. Indirect evidence supports the notion that UvsY&#x02013;ssDNA complexes can occupy two or more conformational states, however. Fluorescence studies of UvsY interactions with etheno-modified ssDNA (&#x003b5;DNA) demonstrate that there is an unusually large (4- to 6-fold) enhancement of &#x003b5;DNA fluorescence caused by UvsY binding at low salt (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>). The addition of moderate salt reduces UvsY&#x02013;&#x003b5;DNA fluorescence enhancement to 2- to 3-fold, a more typical value observed for many proteins that bind to ssDNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>). Similarly, the observed degree of ssDNA wrapping by UvsY depends on DNA tension as well as on salt concentration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>). These observations suggest that there is a structural transition in UvsY&#x02013;ssDNA complexes that is sensitive to ions, to DNA stretching or conceivably to protein&#x02013;protein interactions. It is reasonable to hypothesize, as we do in our model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>A), that mutations in UvsY affect the position of equilibrium between UvsY&#x02013;ssDNA conformers, and that different conformers have different accessibilities to UvsX protein.</p><p>An attractive corollary to our model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>A) is that the &#x02018;closed&#x02019; UvsY&#x02013;ssDNA complex interferes with Gp32&#x02013;ssDNA interactions while the &#x02018;open&#x02019; complex promotes UvsX&#x02013;ssDNA interactions, allowing for a &#x02018;double hand-off&#x02019; of ssDNA, from Gp32 to UvsY then UvsY to UvsX, during presynaptic filament assembly. There is growing evidence that the coordinated hand-off of DNA intermediates between proteins is a common feature of DNA replication and repair pathways. For example, it is proposed that ssDNA is handed off from one primosome protein to another as part of a dynamic primosome assembly process during replication fork restart (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>). Evidence has also been presented for the step-wise hand-off of DNA repair intermediates between AP endonuclease, DNA polymerase beta and other elements of the base excision repair machinery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>). Our results indicate that DNA hand-offs also occur in homologous recombination and homology-directed repair. The biological functions of the handoff of ssDNA from an SSB protein to a mediator to a recombinase may include protecting the cell from cytotoxic effects of ssDNA and/or excluding other enzymes, such as helicases, polymerases or primases from the ssDNA until an appropriate point of the homology-directed repair pathway is reached. In fact, assembly of the T4 replicative helicase/primosome apparatus is rigidly excluded from ssDNA undergoing UvsY-mediated presynaptic filament assembly, providing evidence that ssDNA hand-off mechanisms are important for the coordination of recombination-dependent DNA replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>). Although the coordinated transfer of ssDNA between recombination proteins appears to be driven by ssDNA structural changes, it seems likely that specific protein&#x02013;protein interactions are also important for maintaining the overall integrity of the process. For instance, a seamless UvsX&#x02013;UvsY&#x02013;ssDNA filament contains no Gp32 and so is refractory to helicase loading by the T4 Gp59 protein; but UvsY depletion allows some Gp32 clusters to interrupt the presynaptic filament, which then become targets for untimely Gp59-mediated helicase assembly that disrupts recombination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>).</p><p>Another important finding of this study is that UvsY strongly suppresses AMP production by UvsX's ssDNA-stimulated ATPase activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>). The ATPase activity of UvsX is unusual in that both ADP and AMP are produced as products (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>). Differences in the steady-state kinetics of ADP and AMP production suggest that the two products are formed at two different classes of active sites within the UvsX&#x02013;ssDNA presynaptic filament, one that generates ADP, and one that generates AMP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>). UvsY therefore either selectively inhibits the active sites that produce AMP, or converts them into ADP-producing active sites. Based on kinetics data, we proposed a model in which ADP and AMP production occur sequentially within one type of active site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>). According to this model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>B), UvsY could suppress AMP production at a given site by acting as an ADP/ATP nucleotide exchange factor. This would explain the large increase in ADP/AMP ratio and overall ATPase activity increase brought about by UvsY under optimal conditions. It is noteworthy that the highest ADP/AMP product ratios are observed at UvsX and UvsY concentrations that yield optimal stability of presynaptic filaments and optimal DNA strand exchange activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>B). Under steady-state conditions for ATP hydrolysis, AMP production by the second class of sites is associated with the lowest affinity for ssDNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>). Also, previous work demonstrated that UvsX&#x02013;ssDNA presynaptic filaments are destabilized as ATP substrate is depleted and ADP and AMP products accumulate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>). Results of this study suggest that UvsY could stabilize presynaptic filaments by promoting a rapid exchange of ADP product for ATP substrate at UvsX active sites. This exchange would tend to increase the average lifetime of UvsX subunits in the ATP-occupied, high ssDNA-binding affinity state, while minimizing lifetimes of ADP- or AMP-occupied forms with lower affinity for ssDNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>B). It is important to note that this represents a different, but ultimately congruent, method of regulating ssDNA-binding affinity than is used by many (predominantly eukaryotic) recombinases. For example, the human hRAD51 recombinase hydrolyzes ATP rapidly in the presence of ssDNA, but releases the ADP product very slowly, causing the enzyme to become trapped in an inactive hRAD51&#x02013;ADP&#x02013;ssDNA state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>). Ca<sup>++</sup> ions stimulate the recombination activity of hRAD51 by slowing ATP hydrolysis, increasing its lifetime in the active hRAD51&#x02013;ATP&#x02013;ssDNA state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>). In the T4 system, UvsY realizes the same goal by helping UvsX to eject ADP from the active site and bind to a new ATP substrate molecule. Though carried out by different mechanisms, the net effect is the same in the human and T4 recombination systems&#x02014;recombination activity is increased by increasing the average lifetime of the active recombinase&#x02013;ATP&#x02013;ssDNA state.</p><p>It is clear from our results that optimal assembly and activity of presynaptic filaments during homologous recombination involves a delicate interplay between the DNA-binding activities of recombinase and mediator components, which are linked in multiple ways to filament stability. The data are consistent with the notion that mediator effects on DNA structure and on recombinase nucleotidase activity are important modulators of presynaptic filament stability. The strong conservation of function between T4 UvsX/UvsY and other recombinase/mediator pairs (i.e. eukaryotic Rad51/Rad52 and bacterial RecA/RecOR) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>) suggests that similar mechanistic strategies may be used to control the assembly and activity of presynaptic filaments in many different organisms.</p></sec><sec><title>FUNDING</title><p><grant-sponsor>National Institutes of Health</grant-sponsor> [Program Project grant number <grant-num>P01 CA098993</grant-num>].
