In mammals, there is a parallel system for cell cycle entry in which cyclin dependent kinase (CDK) activates transcription factor E2F/Dp. Here we show that Cln3 regulates SBF by at least two different pathways, one involving the repressive protein Whi5, and the second involving Stb1. The Rpd3 histone deacetylase complex is also involved. Cln3 binds to SBF at the <italic>CLN2</italic> promoter, and removes previously bound Whi5 and histone deacetylase. Adding extra copies of the SBF binding site to the cell delays Start, possibly by titrating Cln3. Since Rpd3 is the yeast ortholog of mammalian HDAC1, there is now a virtually complete analogy between the proteins regulating cell cycle entry in yeast (SBF, Cln3, Whi5 and Stb1, Rpd3) and mammals (E2F, Cyclin D, Rb, HDAC1).

We find that the Cln3-CDK acts through a histone deacetylase, as well as through the previously discovered repressor Whi5, to activate the SBF transcription factor and trigger entry into the cell cycle. The system is strikingly similar to the one in mammalian cells, which relies on Cyclin D, CDK, the transcription factor E2F, its repressor Rb, and the histone deacetylase system. There is preliminary evidence that as the yeast cell grows in size, the increasing number of Cln3 molecules is titrated against the fixed number of Cln3-CDK-SBF binding sites in genomic DNA, and that this cell size-dependent titration could be the mechanism that makes cell cycle entry dependent on cell size.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="14"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>The budding yeast <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> commits to cell-cycle entry at a point called &#x0201c;Start,&#x0201d; equivalent to the restriction point in animals.

At the molecular level, Start coincides with and depends on a Start-specific burst of transcription of over 100 genes including the G1 cyclins <italic>CLN1</italic> and <italic>CLN2</italic>, the S-phase cyclins <italic>CLB5</italic> and <italic>CLB6</italic>, and many genes for budding and DNA synthesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000189-Spellman1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000189-Tyers1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>. The burst of transcription at Start depends on two closely related transcription factors SBF and MBF, each of which contains the transcriptional modulator Swi6, and a sequence-specific DNA binding protein, Swi4 in SBF, and Mbp1 in MBF <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000189-Koch1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>. SBF is most important for the transcription of <italic>CLN1</italic> and <italic>CLN2</italic>, and these G1 cyclins are most important for propelling the cell cycle forward. SBF is found bound to the <italic>CLN1</italic> and <italic>CLN2</italic> promoters in early G1, well before Start, but at this time does not induce any transcription <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000189-Cosma1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000189-Koch2">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>. Indeed, in early G1, SBF may repress transcription. When cells have grown to critical size, the SBF is somehow converted to a transcriptional activator, and induces transcription of many genes including <italic>CLN1</italic> and <italic>CLN2</italic>.</p><p>The G1 cyclin Cln3, in combination with the cyclin dependent kinase Cdc28 (or Cdk1), is a key regulator of Start <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000189-Cross1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000189-Nash1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>, and is critical for the size-dependent activation of SBF and MBF <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000189-Tyers1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>, converting them from their early G1 repressive forms into the late G1 activating forms. Consistent with the idea that <italic>CLN3</italic> is a critical activator of Start, hyperactive alleles of <italic>CLN3</italic> (e.g., <italic>WHI1-1</italic>), and over-expression of <italic>CLN3</italic>, accelerate Start to smaller cell sizes, whereas deletion of <italic>CLN3</italic> delays Start to much larger cell sizes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000189-Cross1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000189-Nash1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>. A <italic>cln3</italic> null mutant, despite having a delayed Start and large cells, is viable because there are alternative methods of inducing transcription of <italic>CLN1</italic> and <italic>CLN2</italic>. The most important alternative route depends on the mysterious gene <italic>BCK2</italic>. The mechanism by which the Bck2 protein activates <italic>CLN1</italic> and <italic>CLN2</italic> transcription is still largely unknown <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000189-Ferrezuelo1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000189-Manukyan1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>. A <italic>cln3 bck2</italic> mutant is inviable in most genetic backgrounds precisely because it does not express sufficient amounts of <italic>CLN1</italic> or <italic>CLN2</italic>, and inviability can be suppressed by the expression of <italic>CLN2</italic> from a heterologous promoter <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000189-DiComo1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000189-Epstein1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>An obvious model for the <italic>CLN3</italic>-dependent activation of SBF is that the Cln3-Cdc28 kinase complex might phosphorylate SBF, thus activating it. However, no evidence for this model has been found <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000189-Wijnen1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>. Instead, there has been an accumulation of evidence that Cln3 works, at least in part, by inhibiting a repressor of SBF.

Cln3-Cdc28 activates SBF only when cells have grown to a critical size. But Cln3-Cdc28 is present even in very small cells. At least in slowly growing G1 cells, Cln3 abundance increases through G1 as the cell grows more-or-less in proportion to cell size and total cell protein. That is, its absolute abundance increases, but its relative abundance (relative to cell volume, or relative to protein content) does not, or at least not by very much <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000189-Tyers1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000189-Sillje1">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref>. How does a small increase in abundance trigger Start at a critical size? One possibility is that Cln3 is titrated against something that is constant per cell. Here, we suggest that increasing amounts of Cln3 are titrated directly against the SBF bindings sites in genomic DNA, which are of course constant in number through G1 phase. At a sufficiently high Cln3/SBF site ratio, SBF is activated, and Start ensues.</p><p>Finally, it is remarkable how well eukaryotic cell cycle control mechanisms have been conserved, with the functional replacement of fission yeast <italic>cdc2</italic> by human <italic>cdc2</italic> (<italic>CDK1</italic>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000189-Lee1">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref> an early and striking example. The yeast system for promoting Start is analogous and perhaps homologous to the mammalian system, with SBF, Cln3, and Whi5 playing roles similar to those of E2F-Dp, Cyclin D, and Rb, respectively <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000189-Schaefer1">&#x0005b;25&#x0005d;</xref>. Our results suggest that the analogy goes even deeper, with both the yeast and mammalian system making critical use of the Rpd3 histone deacetylase to repress transcription of S-phase genes.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Whi5 Is Not the Sole Target of Cln3</title><p>The only known role of Cln3 is to activate SBF and MBF; evidence for this is that <italic>swi6</italic> mutants (which lack both SBF and MBF) are completely nonresponsive to <italic>CLN3</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000189-Wijnen1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>.

First, it could be that some or all of the suppressors de-repressed the native, genomic <italic>CLN2</italic> locus, allowing viability, but that the degree of de-repressed <italic>CLN2</italic> expression was modest, and viability also required a trace of additional expression, which could come either from <italic>RME1</italic> (driving genomic <italic>CLN2</italic>), or from repressed <italic>MET-CLN2</italic> (expressing low, residual levels of <italic>CLN2</italic>).

First, the transcript from the native <italic>CLN2</italic> locus differs in length from the <italic>MET-CLN2</italic> transcript.

To address this, we did epistasis analysis. We constructed double mutants with <italic>whi5</italic> (i.e., <italic>stb1 whi5</italic>, <italic>sin3 whi5</italic>, <italic>rpd3 whi5</italic>), and asked whether any of these double mutants would reduce or eliminate responsiveness to <italic>CLN3</italic> (which would indicate that the new repressors are in the second new pathway).

There are at least three nonexclusive explanations for these kinetics: first, it could be that the repressive proteins are quickly phosphorylated and thereby inactivated as repressors by the Cln3-Cdc28 kinase complex; loss of the proteins from the promoter could be a secondary event. Second, it could be that Cln3-Cdc28 is promoting some positive event that directly induces transcription, and this precedes full loss of the repressive activities. Perhaps phosphorylation of Stb1 or Swi4 or Swi6, for instance, could directly promote transcription even in the presence of repressors. Third, there could be some systematic bias in our ChIP assay such that it is easier to see new proteins arriving at <italic>CLN2</italic> than to see old proteins leaving. Additional experiments will be required to distinguish these possibilities.</p><p>The <italic>GAL-CLN3 bck2 cdc34-2</italic> strain used in the experiments above allowed us to look at events at the <italic>CLN2</italic> promoter in a way that is powerful and sensitive, but also contrived. Therefore, we repeated some of the experiments in a different genetic background. We used a strain carrying a <italic>cdc20</italic> mutation and a galactose inducible <italic>CDC20</italic> gene (<italic>GAL-CDC20</italic>) to arrest cells at the <italic>cdc20</italic> block (mitosis; pre-anaphase), then release them synchronously. Although this approach is less sensitive than the <italic>GAL-CLN3 bck2 cdc34-2</italic> method, we were able to reproduce several of the main results. For example, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000189-g004">Figure 4E</xref> shows Sin3 being recruited to the <italic>CLN2</italic> promoter early in G1, then leaving as cells exit G1 (in this experiment, budding begins at about 50 min).</p><p>We began to characterize the binding dependencies of some of the proteins at the <italic>CLN2</italic> promoter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000189-g005">Figure 5</xref>; <xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-1000189-t001">Table 1</xref>); one obvious question is whether binding of the Sin3-Rpd3 complex depends on Whi5 or Stb1. Sin3 still binds to the <italic>CLN2</italic> promoter in a <italic>whi5</italic> mutant and also in an <italic>stb1</italic> mutant, and also in a <italic>whi5 stb1</italic> double mutant. To see if Sin3 binding was SBF dependent, we used both <italic>swi4</italic> and <italic>swi6</italic> mutations, and found that the association of Sin3 with the <italic>CLN2</italic> promoter is dependent on <italic>SWI6</italic> (<italic>p</italic>&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;4&#x000d7;10<sup>&#x02212;3</sup>), but only slightly if at all dependent on <italic>SWI4</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000189-g005">Figure 5</xref>; <xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-1000189-t001">Table 1</xref>). Presumably in the absence of Swi4, MBF (Mbp1&#x0002b;Swi6) is binding to the <italic>CLN2</italic> promoter and recruiting Sin3-Rpd3.

ChIP showed that Cln3 is found on the <italic>CLN2</italic> promoter close to the SBF binding sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000189-g006">Figure 6</xref>), the same location as SBF, Whi5, Sin3, Stb1, and Rpd3. Cln3-Cdc28 is thus in a location suitable for the direct phosphorylation of these and other associated proteins. Both Whi5 and Stb1 have a very high density of consensus phosphorylation sites for the Cdc28 kinase (2.7 or 2.6 consensus and near-consensus sites per 100 amino acids, respectively), and previous work suggests that they are very likely substrates for Cln-Cdc28 kinase <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000189-Costanzo1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000189-deBruin1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000189-Ho1">&#x0005b;34&#x0005d;</xref>.

Yeast has 100 to 200 genes under the control of SBF and the related transcription factor MBF, and these genes typically have two, three, or more SBF/MBF binding sites each. Thus the total number of functional SBF and MBF binding sites in the cell is in the vicinity of 400. But the average number of Cln3 molecules in a haploid cell is only about 100 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000189-Cross2">&#x0005b;38&#x0005d;</xref>. Of course there is considerable uncertainty in these measurements, but nevertheless it is likely that cellular SBF/MBF binding sites are in excess over Cln3.</p><p>This excess of binding sites could provide a basis for the critical size requirement for Start. As cells grow in mass, ribosome content, and protein synthetic capacity, they contain increasing numbers of Cln3 molecules <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000189-Tyers1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>. Indeed, growth in the number of Cln3 molecules may be faster than the growth in mass <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000189-Schneider1">&#x0005b;39&#x0005d;</xref>. Yet the number of SBF binding sites is fixed by DNA content. Thus, as the cell grows, it could titrate an increasing number of Cln3 molecules against a fixed number of SBF binding sites, which are initially in excess. At some ratio, the bound Cln3 could activate SBF, resulting in Start.</p><p>If this model were correct, then an increase in the number of SBF sites in the cell would increase the requirement for Cln3, and so would cause an increase in cell size at Start. We transformed otherwise wild-type cells with a high copy number plasmid containing four tandem, perfect SBF binding sites (an SBF binding site is called an &#x0201c;SCB&#x0201d;). Since the plasmid has a copy number of about 30, this provides about 120 extra sites, or roughly a 20&#x00025; increase over the wild-type number of sites. We used elutriation to collect small G1 phase cells carrying the 4&#x000d7;SCB plasmid (or a control plasmid lacking the 4&#x000d7;SCB insert), then let these cells grow. We assayed cell volume, and the percentage of budded cells as an assay of Start. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000189-g007">Figure 7</xref>, cells lacking the 4&#x000d7;SCB insert went through Start at about 32 fl, while cells containing the 4&#x000d7;SCB insert went through Start at about 38 fl, roughly a 20&#x00025; increase. This experiment is consistent with the idea that the cell is setting the critical size for Start by titrating some molecule against the number of available SBF binding sites.</p><fig id="pbio-1000189-g007" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pbio.1000189.g007</object-id><label>Figure 7</label><caption><title>Cln3 may be titrated by SBF binding sites.</title><p>Cells (BF305-15d, HWL148, HWL145, and HWL146) were transformed with an empty vector (pBA70, grey line) or the same vector carrying an insert with four tandem copies of an SBF binding site (&#x0201c;pSCB&#x0201d;) (pMT3579, black line).

The differences in critical size in the five experiments were 2.6, 3.7, 6.1, 9.2, and 10.6 fl, with a mean of 6.4 fl (<italic>p</italic>&#x0003c;0.005 for a test of the hypothesis that the difference is 0 using a paired sample one-tailed Student's <italic>t</italic>-test; also statistically significant by nonparametric tests). The experiment shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000189-g007">Figure 7</xref> is the median experiment, with a 6.1 fl difference.</p><p>One issue with this titration experiment is that the 4&#x000d7;SCB plasmid might increase critical size through some irrelevant pathology. If this were so, then the 4&#x000d7;SCB plasmid would cause roughly the same percentage increase in size regardless of any changes we might make to the <italic>CLN3/WHI5</italic>/SBF system. A second issue is that even if the activator titration model is correct, it is not clear what activator is being titrated; it might be Cln3, but Swi4, Swi6, and even Stb1 are also possibilities.</p><p>To address these issues, we first repeated the experiment in a strain carrying two copies of <italic>CLN3</italic> (2&#x000d7;<italic>CLN3</italic>; a second copy is tandemly integrated at the wild-type <italic>CLN3</italic> locus). If the titration hypothesis is correct, then the second copy of <italic>CLN3</italic> should largely compensate for the &#x0223c;20&#x00025; increase in SCB sites. Indeed, the increased size caused by the 4&#x000d7;SCB plasmid in a 2&#x000d7;<italic>CLN3</italic> background is only 0.6 fl (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000189-g007">Figure 7</xref>). A 2&#x000d7;<italic>CLN3</italic> 4&#x000d7;SCB strain had almost exactly the same size as a wild-type (i.e., 1&#x000d7;<italic>CLN3</italic>) strain bearing the control plasmid. (We note that a second copy of <italic>CLN3</italic> causes only &#x0223c;10&#x00025; decrease in critical size in a wild-type strain <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000189-Cross2">&#x0005b;38&#x0005d;</xref>. Presumably when Cln3 is sufficiently abundant, some other molecule becomes limiting for Start.)</p><p>In addition, we did the titration experiment in a <italic>cln3</italic> deletion strain. If the effect of the 4&#x000d7;SCB plasmid is irrelevant pathology, then in the <italic>cln3</italic> strain, the same irrelevant pathology should occur, and the 4&#x000d7;SCB plasmid should again increase critical size. On the other hand, if Cln3 is the activator being titrated, then in the <italic>cln3</italic> strain, the 4&#x000d7;SCB plasmid should have no effect on critical size, since it has nothing to titrate. In fact, to our great surprise, we got neither of these results. Instead, <italic>cln3</italic> cells actually got smaller when we added the 4&#x000d7;SCB plasmid (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000189-g007">Figure 7</xref>). This surprising result was confirmed with two additional experiments (unpublished data), using independently constructed strains. (The experiment shown has the median difference of the three experiments.) This result tells us two things: first, the results are not irrelevant pathology, because the results change in a specific way with changes in the <italic>CLN3/WHI5</italic>/SBF system. Second, a likely interpretation is that Cln3 is indeed the activator being titrated (otherwise a deletion of <italic>CLN3</italic> would make no difference), but that the 4&#x000d7;SCB plasmid is also titrating repressors. That is, Cln3 is most limiting (so high copy 4&#x000d7;SCB causes bigger cells in a wild-type background), and repressors are next most limiting (so when there is no Cln3 anyway, then the high copy 4&#x000d7;SCB plasmid decreases size by titrating repressors).</p><p>If this is true, then a strain that lacks both Cln3 and also the repressors (Whi5 and Stb1) should not be affected by high copy 4&#x000d7;SCB. And this proves to be the case (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000189-g007">Figure 7</xref>, bottom right); a <italic>whi5 stb1 cln3</italic> strain is not affected by the high copy 4&#x000d7;SCB plasmid. Note that the <italic>whi5 stb1</italic> mutant is not responsive to <italic>CLN3</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000189-g001">Figure 1</xref>); the fact that it is also not responsive to extra SCBs is the expectation from the titration model.</p><p>The <italic>whi5 stb1 cln3</italic> strains shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000189-g007">Figure 7</xref> lack all known regulation of the Cln3 size control pathway. Yet, these strains have a size at budding similar to that of wild-type, and have a sigmoidal budding curve suggesting a dependence of budding on size. That is, although the best-characterized size control mechanism is missing, the cells apparently exhibit some form of size control. This suggests the existence of a redundant size control mechanism. The same phenomenon has been observed previously in different circumstances <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000189-Schneider1">&#x0005b;39&#x0005d;</xref>, where the redundant size control was attributed to a translational mechanism. In addition, Jorgensen et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000189-Jorgensen1">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref> found many size control mutants that were not in the <italic>CLN3</italic> pathway.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Discussion</title><p>Here we have found that the Whi5 pathway is not the sole link between Cln3-Cdc28 and SBF activity. We have found several mutants that, like <italic>whi5</italic>, relieve the repression of SBF, and render its activity somewhat independent of Cln3-Cdc28. These mutants include <italic>chd1</italic>, <italic>hda2</italic>, <italic>pho23</italic>, <italic>sin3</italic>, <italic>rpd3</italic>, and <italic>stb1</italic>. Of these, <italic>pho23</italic>, <italic>sin3</italic>, <italic>stb1</italic>, and <italic>rpd3</italic>, are members of, or have been physically linked to, the Rpd3 histone deacetylase complex, a repressive histone deacetylase orthologous to mammalian HDAC1.</p><p>Although we do not know the exact relationship between these proteins and Whi5, we have found that the <italic>stb1</italic> mutation is synergistic with <italic>whi5</italic>; that is, in the context of a <italic>bck2</italic> mutation, the <italic>stb1 whi5</italic> double mutant, unlike either single mutant, has little ability to respond to Cln3-Cdc28. Thus in some sense Stb1 identifies a pathway for regulating SBF that is separate from the Whi5 pathway.</p><p>While we have identified <italic>STB1</italic> in a screen for repressors of SBF, others have previously identified <italic>STB1</italic> as an activator of SBF or MBF <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000189-Costanzo2">&#x0005b;33&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000189-Ho1">&#x0005b;34&#x0005d;</xref>. While paradoxical at first sight, it is quite common for transcription factors to have both positive and negative roles in transcription. An example is Fkh2, which collaborates with Mcm1 and Ndd1 transcription factors, and with Clb-Cdc28 kinase activity, to regulate mitotic genes. In this context, Fkh2 appears to be an activator in late G2 and mitosis, but a repressor at other times <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000189-Darieva1">&#x0005b;40&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000189-Zhu1">&#x0005b;44&#x0005d;</xref>. Similarly, we imagine that Stb1 helps repress SBF in the absence of Cln3 and Bck2 (the situation in which we found it as a repressor), but helps activate SBF in the presence of Cln3 or Bck2 (the situation in which it was characterized as an activator). Consistent with this, cell cycle expression analysis of <italic>stb1</italic> mutants shows that target genes are less repressed at troughs, and less induced at peaks; i.e., they are less regulated and more constitutive (e.g., Figure 3 in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000189-Ho1">&#x0005b;34&#x0005d;</xref>). The fact that <italic>CLN3</italic> can induce expression of <italic>CLN2</italic> even before Sin3, Rpd3, and Whi5 are lost from the promoter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000189-g004">Figure 4</xref>) is consistent with the idea that the initial expression of <italic>CLN2</italic> depends on activation, perhaps via Stb1, rather than on loss of repression.</p><p>If Stb1 is both a repressor and an activator, then some of our assays may preferentially see one of these activities, and some may see the other. Presumably it is the lack of repression by Stb1 that allows the <italic>stb1</italic> mutation to suppress the lethality of the <italic>cln3 bck2</italic> mutant. But the cell size assay for responsiveness to <italic>CLN3</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000189-g001">Figure 1</xref>) may be more sensitive to Stb1 as an activator; in particular, the synergistic defect between <italic>whi5</italic> and <italic>stb1</italic> may be due to the lack of repression in the <italic>whi5</italic> mutant, plus the lack of activation in the <italic>stb1</italic> mutant. We note that the combinations of mutations that include <italic>stb1</italic> tend to have relatively large cell sizes after induction of <italic>GAL-CLN3</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000189-g001">Figure 1</xref>), perhaps showing that <italic>STB1</italic> is needed for full induction of <italic>CLN2</italic>.</p><p>While Whi5 and Stb1 seem to define two pathways of regulation of SBF, it is still unclear how the Sin3-Rpd3 histone deacteylase complex is recruited to the <italic>CLN2</italic> promoter. Previously, the Rpd3 complex has been linked to Stb1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000189-Kasten1">&#x0005b;29&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000189-Kasten2">&#x0005b;31&#x0005d;</xref>. More recently, Huang, Kaluarchchi and Andrews have found evidence for an association between Rpd3 and Whi5 (personal communication). Despite these associations, we found that even <italic>whi5 stb1</italic> double mutants had at least some Sin3 (and so presumably Rpd3) at the <italic>CLN2</italic> promoter, whereas <italic>swi6</italic> mutants had little or no Sin3. Thus although one could imagine various relationships between these proteins, one model is that SBF has some ability to recruit each of Whi5, Stb1, and Sin3-Rpd3, but that these proteins in addition interact with each other (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000189-g008">Figure 8</xref>). Later, in a size- and growth-dependent fashion, Cln3-Cdc28 also joins the complex, and phosphorylates Whi5 and Stb1 and probably Swi6 and possibly Swi4. This causes the loss of the Rpd3 complex; a somewhat slower loss of Whi5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000189-g004">Figure 4</xref>); and perhaps allows phosphorylated Stb1 to help activate transcription (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000189-g008">Figure 8</xref>). That Swi6, along with Whi5 and Stb1, is probably a target of Cln3-Cdc28 phosphorylation is strongly suggested by the fact that over-expression of a mutant Whi5 lacking CDK phosphorylation sites is lethal in a mutant where Swi6 is likewise lacking CDK phosphorylation sites <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000189-Costanzo1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000189-Wagner1">&#x0005b;45&#x0005d;</xref>.

Although <italic>CLB2</italic> is most highly expressed in G2/M, the association of Sin3 and Rpd3 with the <italic>CLB2</italic> promoter was lost in late G1, at about the same time we see loss of Sin3 and Rpd3 from the <italic>CLN2</italic> promoter. Veis et al. interpreted their results in terms of the association between Sin3/Rpd3 and the Fkh2 (forkhead) transcription factor, and suggested that this association was sensitive to Start. However, we note that <italic>CLB2</italic>, despite being most strongly up-regulated in G2/M, is a client of SBF as well as a client of Fkh2. The <italic>CLB2</italic> promoter contains at least three clustered SBF/MBF binding sites, at least two of which are conserved in other species of yeast <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000189-Harbison1">&#x0005b;46&#x0005d;</xref>.

Thus the loss of Sin3/Rpd3 from the <italic>CLB2</italic> promoter in late G1 as seen by Veis and coworkers could involve SBF at the <italic>CLB2</italic> promoter, and so could be related to the phenomenon we see at the <italic>CLN2</italic> promoter.</p><p>Another protein we find at the <italic>CLN2</italic> promoter is Cln3. However, demonstrating this association was difficult, and required a special genetic background and over-expression of Cln3. Part of the difficulty in ChIPing Cln3 to the <italic>CLN2</italic> promoter is presumably because Cln3 is a nonabundant protein, and does not bind DNA directly. But in addition, Cln3 may not be a stoichiometric member of the complex. Instead, it may bind weakly and transiently, phosphorylate its substrate(s), and leave. The two proteins we find to be essential for Cln3 responsiveness, Whi5 and Stb1, are both very likely substrates of Cln-Cdc28 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000189-Costanzo1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000189-deBruin1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000189-Ho1">&#x0005b;34&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Cln3 is present at only about 100 molecules of protein per cell, and yet there are in the vicinity of 400 functional binding sites for SBF and the related factor MBF. The fact that Cln3 is sub-stoichiometric with respect to binding sites could provide a partial solution to the size control problem: Perhaps the amount of Cln3 in the cell, which is a function of cell size and growth rate, is titrated against the number of binding sites. And indeed we found that cells containing extra SCBs had to grow to a larger size to accomplish Start, and this effect could be compensated by one extra dose of <italic>CLN3</italic>. Extra SCBs did not enlarge a <italic>cln3</italic> null mutant, and extra SCBs had no effect whatever on <italic>cln3 stb1 whi5</italic> triple mutants. These findings are all supportive of the titration model.</p><p>Even though larger G1 cells contain more Cln3 molecules than smaller cells, the increase in Cln3 content with size is probably quite moderate, possibly only linearly correlated with cell size. Thus even at cell sizes adequate for Start, Cln3 may still be sub-stoichiometric with respect to binding sites. Thus we imagine that at any and all physiologically reasonable concentrations of Cln3, there will only be fractional occupancy of SBF sites, especially if Cln3 is a weak and transient binder. But as the amounts of Cln3 rise, and are titrated against a fixed number of SBF sites, that fractional occupancy will rise, until at some occupancy (i.e., at some critical cell size), <italic>CLN2</italic> and other targets are expressed, and the cell passes through Start. The issue is, how to convert a relatively small change in total Cln3 into a large change in fractional occupancy, or, alternatively, how to convert a small change in occupancy into a large effect?</p><p>Although we do not know the answers to either of these questions, Ferrell and coworkers have described many mechanisms by which such &#x0201c;super-sensitivity&#x0201d; can occur <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000189-Bagowski1">&#x0005b;49&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000189-Pomerening1">&#x0005b;56&#x0005d;</xref>. One mechanism would use the fact that SBF target genes have multiple SBF binding sites. Perhaps the binding of Cln3 to SBF is cooperative; or perhaps the Cln3 molecules, once bound, cooperate to do something else, such as phosphorylate a substrate. Cooperativity of any kind between multiple sites will give exponential sensitivity to Cln3 amounts, so this is one possible mechanism. A second mechanism is multisite phosphorylation. That is, perhaps the substrates of Cln3-Cdc28 have to be phosphorylated at multiple sites, and this can only happen when fractional occupancy of SBF sites by Cln3 is relatively high. Since phosphorylation is in a dynamic equilibrium with dephosphorylation, a requirement for multisite phosphorylation (at, say, five sites) imposes a super-sensitive threshold on the amount of kinase required <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000189-Ferrell2">&#x0005b;52&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000189-Klein1">&#x0005b;57&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000189-Nash2">&#x0005b;58&#x0005d;</xref>.

A third possible mechanism is to consider the relationship between the complexes at the multiple SBF sites. There are three sites at <italic>CLN2</italic>; if all three have repressive proteins, is enough Cln3 needed to fill all three sites simultaneously, even though occupancy of any one site is always transient? At any rate, although we do not know how supersensitivity works in this situation, there are lots of ways it could work in theory, as cited above.</p><p>There are remarkable parallels between the SBF/Cln3/Whi5,Stb1/Rpd3 regulatory module in yeast, and the E2F-Dp/Cyclin D1/Rb/HDAC1 regulatory module in mammalian cells. To begin with, the cluster of regulated genes is highly conserved: In <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000189-Spellman1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>, in the distantly related yeast <italic>S. pombe</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000189-Oliva1">&#x0005b;59&#x0005d;</xref>, in mammalian cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000189-Whitfield1">&#x0005b;60&#x0005d;</xref>, and probably in most or all other eukaryotes, there is a highly conserved cluster of genes needed for DNA replication, and expressed around the G1/S transition. In both yeasts and mammals, the motifs regulating these genes contain a core &#x0201c;CGCG&#x0201d; element. In both yeasts and mammals, the transcription factors recognizing this element (SBF/MBF in the yeasts, E2F-Dp in mammals) contain a DNA binding domain with a &#x0201c;winged helix&#x0201d; fold <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000189-Gajiwala1">&#x0005b;61&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000189-Zheng1">&#x0005b;63&#x0005d;</xref>. There is no apparent sequence homology between the yeast and mammalian DNA binding domains, but the domain is small, the evolutionary distance vast, and there are other examples where structure but not sequence has been preserved across time.</p><p>In E2F-Dp, the transactivator is repressed by binding of Rb and its family members. There are two mechanisms of repression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000189-Cobrinik1">&#x0005b;64&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000189-Rubin1">&#x0005b;70&#x0005d;</xref>. First, the transactivation domain is masked. Second, Rb family members (but possibly not Rb itself-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000189-Rayman1">&#x0005b;69&#x0005d;</xref>) recruit mSin3B and HDAC1 which deacetylate and otherwise modify chromatin so as to be inhospitable towards expression. Here, we likewise show that there are at least two pathways of regulation, one of them involving recruitment of a histone deacetylase. In mammals, the transactivation domain is unmasked when a cyclin-CDK complex such as cyclin D-CDK4 phosphorylates Rb and family members, disrupting binding to E2F-Dp, and allowing Sin3m and HDAC1 to leave the chromatin. Similarly, in yeast, Cln3-CDK phosphorylates Whi5 and probably Stb1. Whi5, Sin3, and Rpd3 all leave the chromatin. Interestingly, expression of the target gene Cln2 precedes the loss of the repressive proteins, consistent with a dominant activation, possibly due to Stb1. In any case, it is clear that there are deep, well-conserved parallels between the SBF/Cln3/Whi5,Stb1/Rpd3 regulatory module in yeast, and the E2F-Dp/Cyclin D1/Rb/HDAC1 regulatory module in mammals. It is possible that these modules have regulated the cluster of genes for DNA synthesis since early in eukaryotic evolution.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Strains</title><p>Strains are shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-1000189-t002">Table 2</xref>.</p><table-wrap id="pbio-1000189-t002" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pbio.1000189.t002</object-id><label>Table 2</label><caption><title>Plasmids and strains.</title></caption><alternatives><graphic id="pbio-1000189-t002-2" xlink:href="pbio.1000189.t002"/><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><colgroup span="1"><col align="left" span="1"/><col align="center" span="1"/><col align="center" span="1"/><col align="center" span="1"/></colgroup><thead><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Plasmid or Strain</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Name</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Genotype</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Source</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Plasmids</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">pBA70s</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><italic>CYC1::lacZ</italic> 2 micron <italic>URA3</italic></td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">M.
