There are two biovariants of <italic>C. trachomatis</italic>: 'trachoma', causing ocular and genital tract infections, and the invasive 'lymphogranuloma venereum' strains. Recently, a new variant of the genital tract <italic>C. trachomatis </italic>emerged in Sweden. This variant escaped routine diagnostic tests because it carries a plasmid with a deletion. Failure to detect this strain has meant it has spread rapidly across the country provoking a worldwide alert. In addition to being a key diagnostic target, the plasmid has been linked to chlamydial virulence. Analysis of chlamydial plasmids and their cognate chromosomes was undertaken to provide insights into the evolutionary relationship between chromosome and plasmid. This is essential knowledge if the plasmid is to be continued to be relied on as a key diagnostic marker, and for an understanding of the evolution of <italic>Chlamydia trachomatis</italic>.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The genomes of two new <italic>C. trachomatis </italic>strains were sequenced, together with plasmids from six <italic>C. trachomatis </italic>isolates, including the new variant strain from Sweden. The plasmid from the new Swedish variant has a 377 bp deletion in the first predicted coding sequence, abolishing the site used for PCR detection, resulting in negative diagnosis. In addition, the variant plasmid has a 44 bp duplication downstream of the deletion. The region containing the second predicted coding sequence is the most highly conserved region of the plasmids investigated. Phylogenetic analysis of the plasmids and chromosomes are fully congruent. Moreover this analysis also shows that ocular and genital strains diverged from a common <italic>C. trachomatis </italic>progenitor.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>The evolutionary pathways of the chlamydial genome and plasmid imply that inheritance of the plasmid is tightly linked with its cognate chromosome. These data suggest that the plasmid is not a highly mobile genetic element and does not transfer readily between isolates. Comparative analysis of the plasmid sequences has revealed the most conserved regions that should be used to design future plasmid based nucleic acid amplification tests, to avoid diagnostic failures.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p><italic>Chlamydia trachomatis </italic>is the most common cause of non specific urethritis in the industrialised world, and the major infectious cause of preventable blindness (trachoma) in the third world [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. <italic>C. trachomatis </italic>can be divided into at least 15 serovars or serotypes, distinguished by <italic>ompA </italic>sequencing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>], which are associated with different disease pathologies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. Serotypes A, B, Ba and C are generally associated with blinding trachoma and serotypes D to K cause non-disseminating sexually transmitted infections. These 12 serotypes are all naturally restricted to infection of genital or ocular epithelial cells and have not been observed to be invasive [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. By contrast, serotypes L1, L2 and L3 cause a rare invasive and systemic sexually transmitted infection normally found in the tropics, known as lymphogranuloma venereum (LGV) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>].</p><p>In October 2006 a new variant of <italic>C. trachomatis </italic>was described in Sweden that evaded several of the then current commercial molecular diagnostic tests for detecting the microorganism, which were based on the presence of specific plasmid sequences [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. A deletion of 377 bp of plasmid DNA, in the region used for nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs), is responsible for the negative diagnoses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. All new variant strains of <italic>C. trachomatis </italic>belong to serotype E [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Failure to detect the plasmid and hence treat those infected with the new variant has led to a significant increase in cases, and in some Swedish counties 20 &#x02013; 64% of current infections are caused by this strain of <italic>C. trachomatis </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>].</p><p>Strains of <italic>C. trachomatis </italic>have a highly conserved small genome of approximately 1 Mb and harbour a plasmid of approximately 7 kb [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. Some plasmid-free isolates of <italic>C. trachomatis </italic>have been described, but these are exceedingly rare and the only viable clinical isolates described that are plasmid free belong to serotypes L2, D and E [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. The <italic>C. trachomatis </italic>plasmids sequenced to date each contain eight predicted coding sequences (CDSs), along with a set of four 22 bp repeats which is understood to be the origin of replication [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. Characterization of plasmid functions and of chlamydial genes in general has been greatly impeded by the lack of a genetic system for studying <italic>C. trachomatis </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>] and so little is known about the function of these CDSs beyond <italic>in silico </italic>predictions of function for 5 CDSs and the observation that the CDS previously designated ORF5 encodes a protein of 28 kDa (pgp3) when expressed in <italic>Escherichia coli </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. However, the role of pgp3 in the chlamydial developmental cycle and the overall biological function of the plasmid remains unknown.</p><p>Since the study of <italic>C. trachomatis </italic>genes is hampered by the lack of any molecular tools with which to manipulate strains, the emergence of the new variant strain and naturally occurring mutants provides an opportunity to investigate the evolution of the plasmids and to determine whether the evolutionary pathway of these plasmids matches that of the chromosome. In this study the nature and extent of chromosome and plasmid variation in <italic>C. trachomatis </italic>has been investigated. To extend the current dataset, two isolates of the previously unsequenced serotype B were completely sequenced, as were four plasmids from Swedish strains belonging to serotypes E and F, including that of the new variant strain. The plasmid is useful as a target for diagnostic testing because it is relatively stable and hence more resistant to nuclease damage than the genome, and present at up to ten copies per genome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. Thus a detailed knowledge of the sequence conservation and the stability of chlamydial plasmids will be critically informative in determining whether the plasmid is a reliable target for future diagnostic tests.</p></sec><sec><title>Results and Discussion</title><sec><title>Genome sequences of serotype A and B isolates of <italic>C. trachomatis</italic></title><p>The genomes of two serotype B ocular isolates of <italic>C. trachomatis </italic>were sequenced. These provide the first high quality genome sequences of ocular isolates: B/TZ1A828/OT and B/Jali20/OT (referred to as CTB and Jali20 respectively, for ease of nomenclature), summarised in Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>. Whole genome comparisons showed that the genomes are highly syntenic, and that there are no whole gene differences between the strains. The pairwise mean nucleotide identity between orthologous genes is 99.8%. A comparison of the genomes against that of <italic>C. trachomatis </italic>serotype A strain A/HAR-13 (referred to as A/HAR-13) sequenced by microarray [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>] showed no insertions or deletions of predicted coding sequences (CDSs).</p><table-wrap position="float" id="T1"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>General properties of <italic>C. trachomatis </italic>genomes sequenced.</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><td align="left"><bold>Strain</bold></td><td align="left"><bold>B/TZ1A828/OT</bold></td><td align="left"><bold>Jali20</bold></td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left">Chromosome (bp)</td><td align="left">1044282</td><td align="left">1044352</td></tr><tr><td align="left">% G+C</td><td align="left">41.3</td><td align="left">41.3</td></tr><tr><td align="left">No. CDSs</td><td align="left">879</td><td align="left">875</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Coding percentage</td><td align="left">88.5</td><td align="left">88.5</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Average gene size (bp)</td><td align="left">1051</td><td align="left">1056</td></tr><tr><td align="left">No. pseudogenes</td><td align="left">14</td><td align="left">18</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><p>The SNP comparisons have been made to the serotype A reference strain A/HAR-13.</p></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap><p>Previous microarray and sequencing studies have shown that almost all sequence and gene variation distinguishing serotypes of <italic>C. trachomatis </italic>from each other are restricted to a region at the terminus of replication known as the Plasticity Zone (PZ) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. It was demonstrated by microarray and PCR analysis that a strain belonging to serotype B lacked most of the genes found within this region [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. However, analysis of the serotype B isolates sequenced for this study showed that they possess many of the CDSs found within the PZ (see additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>). These include cytotoxin gene fragments, remnants of a much larger cytotoxin gene which is thought to have been similar to those still found intact in <italic>C. muridarum </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. In a strain of <italic>C. trachomatis </italic>serotype D, a remnant of the cytotoxin gene is expressed, and is cytotoxic on HeLa cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. Consistent with previous analysis of the PZ, the phospholipase D genes display high levels of disruption in both serotype B strains [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. The PZ also encompasses the <italic>trpRBA </italic>operon, which has been found to be functional only in genital isolates, and to carry mutations in ocular strains [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. This operon is non-functional in both the strains presented here, with either the <italic>trpB </italic>(B/TZ1A828/OT) or <italic>trpA </italic>(B/Jali20/OT) being disrupted (see additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>).</p><p>Despite there being no whole gene differences between the strains, analysis of the genomes identified several pseudogene differences when they were compared to each other and also with the genomes of other <italic>C. trachomatis </italic>serotypes and biovariants A/HAR-13 and the serotype L2 strain L2/434/BU (see additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S2">2</xref>). Eleven of the disrupted CDSs are common to both serotype B strains, whereas only one of these is common also to A/HAR_13 and L2/434/BU (CTB_3211/JALI_3211/CTA_0350/CTL0578). The equivalent putative membrane proteins CTB_0571/JALI_0571 contain different inactivating mutations: a single base deletion causing a frameshift after codon 333 (CTB), or a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) prematurely truncating the protein after codon 177 (Jali20). Another example of a CDS with distinct inactivating mutations is the putative exported protein JALI_1341/CTA_0142. This CDS carries a frameshift mutation in Jali20, and is truncated by a premature stop codon leading to a loss of 60 amino acids from the C terminus in A/HAR-13.</p><p>Inclusion proteins are an important family of chlamydial proteins, associated with virulence, which target the host inclusion membrane. Consequently, the inactivation of CDSs CTB_2231 and JALI_2231 encoding candidate inclusion membrane proteins may have implications with regard to how the cell interacts with the host. This CDS has been disrupted by an identical SNP creating a stop codon after codon 113 in both strains, with JALI_2231 having undergone a further single base insertion and deletion at other sites to create two additional frameshifts. Another notable difference is the variation in the sequence of the <italic>secF </italic>gene, which is present as a full length gene in the serotype B strains, but is found as two separate CDSs <italic>secD</italic>/<italic>secF </italic>in A/HAR-13 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. A further functional loss is the operon comprising pyruvoyl-dependent arginine decarboxylase and arginine/ornithine antiporter, involved in pH homeostasis. The antiporter (CTB_3721/JALI_3721/CTA_0406-7) is disrupted in the serotype A and B strains, the decarboxylase (CTL0627) is disrupted in L2/434/BU, whereas the operon is intact in the serotype D strain D/UW-3/CX [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>].</p><p>Set against a high level of sequence identity (generally in excess of 99% identity at the nucleotide level), some predicted CDSs display higher levels of variation (see additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S3">3</xref>). As has been noted before, these include <italic>ompA</italic>, which is used to distinguish between serotypes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>], <italic>tarp</italic>, encoding the translocated actin recruiting phosphoprotein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>], and <italic>hctB</italic>, encoding histone-like HC2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Phylogenetic analysis of <italic>C. trachomatis </italic>genomes</title><p>The first genome-scale, SNP-based phylogenetic analysis of all six available <italic>C. trachomatis </italic>genomes was carried out, covering serotypes A, B, D, L2 and L2b (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref>). Comparative genome analysis identified 11,500 SNPs, of which the large majority define splits between the three major groups (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). Monophyly of LGV strains is supported by 6200 SNPs, 1477 SNPs unite the three ocular strains and 1377 are unique to the genital, serotype D strain. These splits are also strongly supported in the results of the phylogenetic analysis of the SNPs, using a general time reversible model of evolution and four discrete gamma distributed rate categories to account for among site rate variation. Pairwise comparisons of the genomes by SNP numbers also confirms this clustering (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">3</xref>). Within the ocular strains, the two serotype B isolates cluster together, suggesting that serotypes are identifiable on the basis of SNP phylogenies. These data are derived from the genomes of six isolates (five serotypes), whilst the numbers are small they reflect the same patterns of genome evolution observed using fragments of the genome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>] and our data using complete genomes are strong enough to support these associations, although further studies would be beneficial to confirm these findings when the technology will allow rapid easy purification of genomes from these obligate intracellular pathogens.</p><table-wrap position="float" id="T2"><label>Table 2</label><caption><p>Strains of <italic>C.

To investigate the new variant strain which evaded diagnosis, isolates from epithelial sexually transmitted infections (STIs) from the city of Malmo in Sweden were included. Genital tract isolates representing the new variant <italic>C. trachomatis </italic>(strain Sweden2, serotype E) and three concurrently isolated strains (Sweden3, serotype E; Sweden4 and Sweden5, both serotype F) were selected. To represent plasmids from other chlamydial serotypes, plasmid sequences were obtained from Genbank covering further trachoma and LGV strains (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref>).</p><p>Alignment of these 11 plasmid sequences showed that there are 83 SNP locations, representing approximately 1.1% variation. Six of these occur in intergenic locations. The SNPs and their effects on coding sequences are shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>. Each plasmid is unique and identifiable by the presence of at least one SNP and/or indel (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B&#x02013;D</xref>). Only two SNPs, at positions 5,328 and 7,458 (using pSW3 as the reference sequence), allow differentiation of the chlamydial plasmids into LGV, trachoma and genital tract groupings. Most of the SNPs are located within CDSs and there is no significant clustering of SNPs within the plasmid. Only one non-synonymous mutation occurs within CDS2 which may suggest that this gene is under strong selection. Analysis of the informative SNPs and indels allowed phylogenetic reconstruction of the relationships between the plasmids (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). The resulting phylogenetic tree shows that the chlamydial plasmids segregate into tight groupings reflecting the phenotypes of their host bacteria. The LGV plasmids are the most distantly related, with the STI and ocular strain plasmids having apparently diverged at a later time.</p><fig position="float" id="F2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p><bold>Schematic of the location of SNPs and indels within the chlamydial plasmids</bold>.

Of the serotype A, B, L2 and L2b strains, for which both complete genome and plasmid sequence sets exist, and serotype D for which there are independent complete genome and plasmid sequences, the phylogenies mirror each other. The complete genomes and plasmids from the LGV strains cluster tightly, as do those from the ocular strains, and the STI strains branch from these and also cluster together.</p><p>These data suggest that the chlamydial plasmids have not been freely exchanged, but have remained closely linked to their cognate host chromosome (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Analysis of the new variant plasmid</title><p>The plasmid with the most variation (pSW2) was found in strain Sweden2. However, pSW2 still belongs to the genital tract lineage and therefore has not appeared as result of a transfer event. The complete nucleotide sequence of pSW2 comprises 7,169 bp, 333 bp smaller than the 7,502 bp plasmid (pSW3) from strain Sweden3. Sweden3 could be hypothesised to be the potential progenitor strain of Sweden2 because they have identical sequences of the chromosomal <italic>ompA </italic>gene. The difference in size between pSW2 and pSW3 is accounted for by a deletion of 377 bp and a duplication of 44 bp at a different locus (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). pSW2 is the smallest chlamydial plasmid described, some 200 bp smaller than the previously smallest known chlamydial plasmid, pCpnE1 (7,369 bp), which is from an equine strain of <italic>C. pneumoniae </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>].</p><fig position="float" id="F3"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p><bold>Comparison of plasmids pSW2 (inner circle) and pSW3 (outer circle)</bold>. pSW2 carries a 377 bp deletion in CDS1 (coloured brown for pseudogene) and a 44 bp duplication immediately upstream of CDS3 (shown in red). CDS2 is transcribed in the opposite direction to the other CDSs and is shaded grey. The set of 22 bp repeats upstream of CDS1 form the putative origin of replication.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1471-2164-10-239-3"/></fig><p>The 377 bp deletion within pSW2 is situated within CDS1, creating a frameshift which shortens the predicted protein from 305 to 178 amino acids and removing a primer binding site for the diagnostic nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs). This region of the plasmid was originally selected as the target for several commercial diagnostic NAATS and the new variant strain became established because infection by this strain went undetected and hence untreated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. Plasmid pL2 from strain L2/434/BU contains a single nucleotide deletion within CDS1 (position 910) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>] leading to a truncated CDS1 protein (260 amino acids). pCpnE1 also has a deletion within CDS1, but the location is different to that within pSW2 and the effect is to create two small putative CDSs, which are unlikely to be functional.</p><p>The observation of CDS1 as a region of the plasmid apparently prone to inactivation and therefore potentially dispensable may be explained by the possible functional redundancy between the proteins encoded by CDS1 and CDS2. These proteins have similar sizes (305 and 332 amino acids respectively), share 35% amino acid sequence identity, and both match to the Pfam domain PF00589 (CDS1 e-value of 0.003, CDS2 e-value of 4.9e-39), suggesting some functional equivalence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>].</p><p>A second difference between the pSW2 and the other <italic>C. trachomatis </italic>plasmids is a 44 bp perfect tandem duplication, located immediately upstream of both CDS2 and CDS3, which are divergently transcribed. The transcription start points (tsp) for CDS2 and CDS3 (encoding a homologue of DnaB, a protein involved in forming the replication complex) have been mapped previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>] and are both located within this 44 bp section. The duplication of the tsp could potentially boost CDS2 expression. Both the deletion in CDS1 and the 44 bp duplication are unique to pSW2, and no intermediate plasmid carrying either of the mutations separately has been identified. This could indicate that these changes are related events, and that potential up-regulation of CDS2 may compensate for the loss of a functional product from CDS1.</p></sec><sec><title>Candidate plasmid regions for improved diagnostic targets</title><p>When all <italic>C. trachomatis </italic>plasmid CDSs from the eleven complete nucleotide sequences were compared, CDS2 was found to be the most highly conserved. Although there are eleven SNPs within the coding sequence, only one results in an amino acid change (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>), suggestive of a functional requirement. This SNP (Met-Leu, position 1,147), present in pSW2 and pSW3, is at the extreme carboxy terminus of the protein. A further constraint on variation within CDS2 is the presence of two short RNA molecules (225 and 415 nucleotides), which are complementary to the 3' terminus of the primary transcript encoding CDS2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. These two short 'antisense' transcripts are differentially expressed during the developmental cycle. This level of sequence conservation, possibly tied to an essential function, suggests that the region of the plasmid encompassing CDS2 would be a good target for future screening.</p><p>CDS6, CDS7 and CDS8 also show high levels of amino acid conservation. CDS6 (unknown function) is the smallest plasmid encoded protein and contains a single SNP. The proteins encoded by CDS7 and CDS8 display homology to proteins involved in the process of plasmid partitioning [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>], and have been shown to be active at cell division. These proteins may play an important role for these relatively low copy number plasmids, ensuring that each daughter cell acquires an equal number of plasmid copies.</p><p>The protein predicted to be encoded by CDS5, previously designated ORF 5 (pgp3) has the largest number of non-synonymous SNPs. There are 14 SNPs, evenly spread throughout CDS, resulting in ten amino acid changes (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). SNP 5,112 differentiates LGV plasmids from the trachoma plasmids and SNP 5,114 is unique to the blinding trachoma isolates (using pSW3 as the reference sequence). The protein encoded by CDS5 (pgp3) has been located to the cell surface and it has recently been suggested that the CDS5 product can be secreted from inside the inclusion, to the cytoplasm of <italic>Chlamydia</italic>-infected cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. Thus the higher number of non-synonymous changes in this CDS could result from immune selection giving rise to more variation.</p><p>The area of the plasmid from the stop codon of CDS8 to the start codon of CDS1 has the highest density of intergenic SNPs, as well as apparent deletions, making the region the most susceptible to mutation within the <italic>C. trachomatis </italic>plasmids. Thus the area around the replication origin is the most variable and is a poor region in which to design diagnostic PCR primers.</p></sec><sec><title>Analysis of plasmid copy number</title><p>The sequencing of pSW5 revealed that this plasmid carries one 22 bp repeat fewer than the others at the putative origin of replication. To test whether this affects plasmid copy number, DNA from several strains was subjected to quantitative PCR. The results showed that, where loss of the repeat sequence had occurred, plasmid copy number was not adversely affected, with plasmid/genome (P/G) ratios in the range of 2&#x02013;6 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>). Interestingly, it appears that genital strains have a slightly lower plasmid copy number than the others, and strain Jali20 has the highest P/G ratio.</p><fig position="float" id="F4"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><p><bold>Plasmid copy number in <italic>C. trachomatis</italic></bold>.

This may be accounted for by the constraints demanded by the obligate intracellular developmental cycle, and the lack of a route for foreign DNA exchange. Attempts to cure <italic>C. trachomatis </italic>of its plasmid using chemical agents have been unsuccessful [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>], and viable plasmid-free isolates of <italic>C. trachomatis </italic>(plasmid extinction) are exceedingly rare, with only three such isolates reported. The plasmid is therefore not essential for chlamydial viability, but a recent study comparing the pathobiological properties of a naturally occurring plasmid-free L2 isolate with a plasmid-bearing strain suggested that the plasmid may have a role in virulence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. Furthermore, studies with plasmid cured <italic>C. muridarum </italic>showed that this strain failed to cause disease within the infected mouse oviduct [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>].</p><p>A more detailed examination of the plasmids and genomes of <italic>C. trachomatis </italic>was prompted by the appearance and spread of a new variant strain in Sweden, carrying significant changes to its plasmid. Previous phylogenetic analyses of chlamydial plasmids indicated that their evolutionary lineage includes plasmids from other chlamydial species [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. Complete genome SNP analysis of the <italic>C. trachomatis </italic>genomes and plasmids presented here indicates that the plasmids from the lymphogranuloma biovars diverged from the trachoma biovars first and this has been followed by subsequent evolution of these plasmids following biological pathways of ocular or genital strains. The current data set therefore provides no evidence that there has been any exchange of plasmids between ocular, genital tract and LGV serovar groupings. There is no accurate molecular clock to measure the evolutionary rate within <italic>C. trachomatis</italic>, but as these are exclusively human pathogens it would seem likely that these events have occurred within recent human evolution. The discovery of the new variant <italic>C. trachomatis</italic>, undocumented before 2002, strongly suggests either that the novel mutations within the plasmid are very recent [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>], or that this variant has become prominent due to the reliance on a plasmid-based diagnostic test.</p><p>The cryptic plasmid is an important target for chlamydial detection and knowledge of its structure and variation is essential in designing accurate and sensitive new assays. The data presented here indicate that the CDS2 region of the plasmid is the most highly conserved part of the sequence and thus the optimal choice for developing new nucleic acid amplification tests. Each plasmid analysed has a unique sequence, reflecting its associated serotype; however the differences between some are very slight and it is unlikely that a useful typing system could be developed based on the plasmid alone. Undoubtedly, the changes in the new variant <italic>C. trachomatis </italic>plasmid give it a distinctive signature which will allow its spread in new populations to be followed. Even with these large differences between the new variant plasmid pSW2 and its putative progenitor pSW3, it is clear that the chlamydial plasmid remains closely associated with its cognate chromosomal partner. The parallel evolution of the chlamydial plasmid and chromosome, and lack of horizontal gene transfer, is consistent with the intracellular developmental cycle of this species.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Chlamydia and cell culture</title><p>The isolates and sources of <italic>Chlamydia trachomatis </italic>used in this work are summarised in Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref>.
