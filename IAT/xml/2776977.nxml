The absence of identifiable mutations in the majority of WTs suggests the frequent involvement of epigenetic aberrations in WT. We therefore conducted a genome-wide analysis of promoter hypermethylation in WTs and identified hypermethylation at chromosome 5q31 spanning 800 kilobases (kb) and more than 50 genes. The methylated genes all belong to <italic>&#x003b1;-</italic>, <italic>&#x003b2;-</italic>, and <italic>&#x003b3;-protocadherin</italic> (<italic>PCDH</italic>) gene clusters (Human Genome Organization nomenclature <italic>PCDHA@</italic>, <italic>PCDHB@</italic>, and <italic>PCDHG@</italic>, respectively). This demonstrates that long-range epigenetic silencing (LRES) occurs in developmental tumors as well as in adult tumors. Bisulfite polymerase chain reaction analysis showed that <italic>PCDH</italic> hypermethylation is a frequent event found in all Wilms' tumor subtypes. Hypermethylation is concordant with reduced <italic>PCDH</italic> expression in tumors. WT precursor lesions showed no <italic>PCDH</italic> hypermethylation, suggesting that de novo <italic>PCDH</italic> hypermethylation occurs during malignant progression. Discrete boundaries of the <italic>PCDH</italic> domain are delimited by abrupt changes in histone modifications; unmethylated genes flanking the LRES are associated with permissive marks which are absent from methylated genes within the domain. Silenced genes are marked with non-permissive histone 3 lysine 9 dimethylation. Expression analysis of embryonic murine kidney and differentiating rat metanephric mesenchymal cells demonstrates that <italic>Pcdh</italic> expression is developmentally regulated and that <italic>Pcdhg@</italic> genes are expressed in blastemal cells. Importantly, we show that PCDHs negatively regulate canonical Wnt signalling, as short-interfering RNA&#x02013;induced reduction of <italic>PCDHG@</italic> encoded proteins leads to elevated &#x003b2;-catenin protein, increased &#x003b2;-catenin/T-cell factor (TCF) reporter activity, and induction of Wnt target genes. Conversely, over-expression of PCDHs suppresses &#x003b2;-catenin/TCF-reporter activity and also inhibits colony formation and growth of cancer cells in soft agar. Thus PCDHs are candidate tumor suppressors that modulate regulatory pathways critical in development and disease, such as canonical Wnt signaling.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><p>The development of tissues and organs in the human body requires carefully regulated production of proteins by cells. Proteins permit the growth and development of the many varied structures required for a healthy body. In many diseases, including some cancers, tissues and organs fail to develop as they should due to the normal production of proteins being changed. The work presented here shows that in Wilms' tumor, a childhood cancer of the kidney, a large group of related proteins that are likely necessary for growth and development of a normal kidney are not produced properly. This is due to their production being switched off within the cancer cells. We show how these proteins, known as protocadherins, can themselves alter the function of other proteins already known to be important in normal growth and cancer. Thus our study increases our understanding of how protocadherins are important in normal growth and of how altering protocadherins may lead to disease, such as cancer.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="13"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Wilms' tumour (WT) represents a paradigm for cancer arising from disrupted development. Failure of the metanephric blastemal cells to undergo mesenchymal to epithelial transition, together with proliferation of these undifferentiated cells, is intrinsic to the development of Wilms' tumours <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000745-Rivera1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>. Thus WT predisposing genes are often critical in normal nephrogenesis. As the aetiology of WTs cannot be explained solely by the known genetic changes, we have evaluated epigenetic changes in WTs. Several epigenetic lesions have previously been identified in Wilms' tumour, in particular loss of imprinting at chromosome 11p13 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000745-Dallosso1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000745-Malik1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref> and 11p15 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000745-Ogawa1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>, which we have shown to be early and independent events <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000745-Brown1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>. In common with other cancers, WTs also show tumour suppressor gene silencing which includes genes such as <italic>HACE1</italic> (73&#x00025; of tumours analysed) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000745-Zhang1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>, <italic>RASSF1</italic> (56&#x00025;) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000745-Wagner1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>, <italic>CASP8</italic> (43&#x00025;), <italic>MGMT</italic> (30&#x00025;), <italic>RASSF5/NORE1</italic> (15&#x00025;), and <italic>CDKN2A</italic> (10&#x02013;15&#x00025;) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000745-Morris1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>. In addition, we have recently shown over-expression of the <italic>GLIPR1</italic> gene resulting from promoter hypomethylation (87&#x00025;) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000745-Chilukamarri1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>In order to identify candidate genes involved in Wilms' tumorigenesis, we undertook genome-wide analysis of promoter methylation. We have identified pronounced tumour-specific hypermethylation in a region spanning &#x0223c;800 kb of chromosome 5q31. This region contains members of the <italic>PCDH</italic> superfamily in 3 multi-gene clusters (<italic>PCDHA@, PCDHB@ and PCDHG@</italic>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000745-Morishita1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>. Hypermethylation of this locus is an example of long range epigenetic silencing, which has previously been reported in colorectal cancer at chromosome 2q14.2 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000745-Frigola1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>, the <italic>MLH1</italic> locus on 3p22 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000745-Hitchins1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>, and for the <italic>HOXA</italic> gene cluster on chromosome 7p15 in breast and lung cancers <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000745-Novak1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000745-Rauch1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>. We demonstrate that silencing of gene expression is concomitant with DNA hypermethylation and repressive histone modifications. Although little is known about the functions of these clustered PCDHs, other members of the PCDH superfamily have been shown to have tumour suppressor activity, such as PCDH10 in various carcinomas <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000745-Ying1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000745-Yu1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref> and PCDH8 in breast cancer <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000745-Yu2">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>. Functional data presented here suggest that proteins encoded by the chromosome 5q31 PCDHs modulate the Wnt pathway and are candidate Wilms' tumour suppressor genes.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>A large hypermethylated domain at 5q31 in Wilms' tumour</title><p>Following methylated DNA immunoprecipitation (MeDIP, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000745.s001">Figure S1A</xref>), the efficacy and specificity of the MeDIP protocol was verified using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) of a constitutively methylated CpG island (CGI) at the <italic>H19</italic> imprinting control region, demonstrating successful enrichment relative to input DNA. Specificity for methylated CGIs was shown by PCR of the <italic>RASSF1</italic> 5&#x02032; CGI. Amplification of a non-CGI sequence (an intragenic region of the <italic>TBP</italic> gene), was used as a negative control for methylated DNA enrichment (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000745.s001">Figure S1B</xref>). Validated MeDIP DNA samples from human fetal kidney and Wilms' tumours were then hybridised to Nimblegen HG18 Refseq promoter microarrays (MeDIP-chip) to detect tumour-specific alterations in methylation.</p><p>Microarray data from 5 sporadic WTs were examined to identify promoters displaying tumour-specific hypermethylation (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.05, <italic>t</italic>-test). Overall we found 2043 hypermethylated genes. Significantly, a large subset of these targets were found in 2 or more tumours; pairwise comparisons showed that each individual tumour had between 12.0&#x00025; and 33.7&#x00025; (mean 23.8&#x00025;) of hypermethylated targets in common with the other tumours analysed. The genomic distribution of recurrently hypermethylated genes was non-random (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.001, chi square test), with many being located together or within gene clusters (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000745.s009">Table S1</xref>). Contiguous hypermethylated genes were more likely to be found in several tumours (13 out of 17 loci).</p><p>Strikingly, of 146 annotated genes hypermethylated in 3 or more tumours, 25 were <italic>PCDHs</italic> located at chromosome 5q31 and MeDIP-chip data revealed enriched tumour/normal ratios across 50 closely-linked CGIs spanning 800 kb on chromosome 5q31.3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000745-g001">Figure 1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000745.s001">Figure S1C</xref>). Hypermethylation at this locus was identified in all tumours examined (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000745.s010">Table S2</xref>) and hypermethylated CGIs localise to <italic>PCDHA@, PCDHB@ and PCDHG@</italic>. Each <italic>PCDHB@</italic> gene is encoded by a single, unspliced exon, while the <italic>PCDHA@</italic> and <italic>PCDHG@</italic> genes have unique 5&#x02032; exons splicing into cluster-specific constant region exons encoding invariant cytoplasmic domains <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000745-Morishita1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>.

Similar to the Notch signalling paradigm, regulated presenilin dependent-processing of the &#x003b3;-PCDHs generates C-terminal fragments which can localize to the nucleus and autoregulate the &#x003b3;-<italic>PCDH</italic>s <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000745-Haas1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000745-Hambsch1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>In contrast to breast cancer <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000745-Novak2">&#x0005b;30&#x0005d;</xref>, our ChIP data shows a strong link between DNA methylation and H3K9me2 at silenced <italic>PCDH</italic> genes, as reported for the LRES on chromosome 2q14.2 and 3p22 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000745-Frigola1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000745-Hitchins1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>. Indeed a correlation between degree of silencing and H3K9me2 enrichment was apparent, whereas H3K4me2 and H3Ac marking is evident in all active genes and lost in silenced genes. This suggests that H3K9me2 plays a role in establishing and maintaining the silenced state, as previously demonstrated for <italic>CDKN2A</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000745-Bachman1">&#x0005b;31&#x0005d;</xref>, and that histone 3 acetylation and H3K4me2 marks are removed prior to increases in H3K9me2 and DNA methylation. It has been postulated that a significant proportion of hypermethylated loci in cancer do not arise by adaptive selection but rather are the result of an &#x02018;instructive&#x02019; mechanism, via <italic>cis</italic>-targeting of the <italic>trans</italic>-acting Polycomb group protein-complexes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000745-Keshet1">&#x0005b;32&#x0005d;</xref>, and that these loci are pre-marked in normal (unmethylated) tissues by histone H3 trimethyl - lysine27 (H3K27me3).

Therefore the <italic>PCDH</italic>s do not appear to be pre-marked for <italic>de novo</italic> methylation in WT, indicating that this molecular lesion is selected for during tumorigenesis. This is also supported by tumour-type specific variations in hypermethylation such as observed for <italic>PCDHGC3</italic>, as discussed above.</p><p>Hypermethylation of <italic>PCDH</italic>s was not detectable in nephrogenic rests, consistent with a previous assessment of <italic>RASSF1</italic>, <italic>DNAJC15</italic>/<italic>MCJ</italic> and <italic>TNFRSF25</italic> gene hypermethylation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000745-Ehrlich1">&#x0005b;35&#x0005d;</xref>.

Expression of PCDHs in blastemal cells, together with our methylation analysis of nephrogenic rests, also negates the possibility that Wilms' tumour <italic>PCDH</italic> hypermethylation can be attributed to clonal expansion of progenitors with cell-type specific methylation.</p><p>Genetic lesions in WT known to be late events include chromosome 16q loss of heterozygosity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000745-Charles1">&#x0005b;36&#x0005d;</xref> and <italic>CTNNB1</italic> mutations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000745-Fukuzawa1">&#x0005b;37&#x0005d;</xref>; interestingly, the CTCF gene locates to 16q, is mutated in some WTs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000745-Filippova1">&#x0005b;38&#x0005d;</xref> and the encoded epiregulatory protein has multiple binding sites across the <italic>PCDH</italic> locus <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000745-Kim1">&#x0005b;39&#x0005d;</xref>, suggesting that aberrant CTCF function may be involved in LRES.</p><p>Expression of the <italic>Pcdhs</italic> peaks in the last week of nephrogenesis; thereafter, expression decreases, in contrast to <italic>Cdh1</italic>, which encodes the archetypal epithelial adhesion protein, E-cadherin. Epithelial differentiation of rat metanephric mesenchyme cells in organ culture was also accompanied by decreasing levels of <italic>Pcdhg@</italic> expression.

Our <italic>PCDH</italic> expression analyses in human fetal kidney, during murine nephrogenesis and in rat metanehpric mesenchyme suggest that PCDHs may have hitherto uncharacterised roles in renal development. Although <italic>Pcdhg@</italic> mutant mice, which undergo neurodegeneration and neonatal death in less than 12 hours, did not show a gross kidney phenotype, kidney defects were not explored in detail <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000745-Wang1">&#x0005b;42&#x0005d;</xref> (Wang &#x00026; Sanes, personal communication). The early postnatal lethality observed with homozygous <italic>Pcdhg@</italic> mutant mice would also preclude full assessment of effects on nephrogenesis, as murine kidney development continues in the first week following birth. Although we were unable to assess renal defects in <italic>Pcdhg@</italic> null mice, we did examine postnatal kidney from heterozygous <italic>Pcdhg@</italic> mutant mice (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000745.s013">Text S1</xref>), as heterozygous mutations of developmental genes such as <italic>Wt1</italic> have been shown to result in end-stage renal disease <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000745-Menke1">&#x0005b;43&#x0005d;</xref>. Histological examination of kidneys from 3 month old heterozygotes showed no evidence of overt kidney malformations (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000745.s008">Figure S8</xref>). However, it will clearly be of great interest to analyse a larger heterozygous cohort together with embryonic kidney from homozygous <italic>Pcdhg@</italic> mutants in future studies.</p><p>The canonical Wnt signalling pathway is a prerequisite for initiating and maintaining mesenchymal to epithelial transitions during kidney development, and it is also known that mesenchyme with high &#x003b2;-catenin activity fails to form epithelial structures <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000745-Park1">&#x0005b;44&#x0005d;</xref>. Thus attenuation of Wnt signalling is necessary during nephrogenesis. Importantly, our functional analysis shows that &#x003b3;-PCDHs repress &#x003b2;-catenin/TCF mediated transcription, with lowered PCDH leading to elevated &#x003b2;-catenin protein, high &#x003b2;-catenin/TCF reporter activity and induced expression of Wnt target genes. Conversely, ectopic expression of <italic>PCDHs</italic> was able to suppress &#x003b2;-catenin/TCF reporter activity in heterologous cell systems. In contrast to Wnt target genes, <italic>WT1</italic> expression levels were reduced by PCDH knockdown, demonstrating that Wnt target gene induction is not reflecting a generalised increase in transcription and that other regulatory networks are also influenced by cellular PCDH levels. The significance of these results is underlined by our findings of epigenetic silencing of <italic>PCDH</italic>s in WT, as this would be predicted to lead to elevated &#x003b2;-catenin/TCF activity. In this regard, it is notable that enhanced &#x003b2;-catenin signalling in WTs is observed more frequently than <italic>CTNNB1</italic> and <italic>WTX</italic> mutations in WTs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000745-Ruteshouser1">&#x0005b;45&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000745-Koesters1">&#x0005b;46&#x0005d;</xref> and that <italic>CTNNB1</italic> mutation is, like <italic>PCDH</italic> silencing, a late event in Wilms' tumorigenesis. Although our analysis of PCDHs on Wnt signalling can only approximate the permutational silencing in WTs, our results prompt the hypothesis that the canonical Wnt pathway is modulated by PCDHs, and that in normal nephrogenesis, elevated PCDHs serve to downregulate &#x003b2;-catenin activity, thereby permitting completion of epithelial differentiation. Epigenetic silencing of <italic>PCDH</italic>s might contribute to deregulation of Wnt signalling, and a failure of mesenchymal to epithelial transition resulting in persistence of a progenitor cell pool and consequent Wilms' tumorigenesis.
