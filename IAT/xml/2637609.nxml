PARP1 enzyme is known to catalyze the transfer of ADP-ribose to a variety of nuclear proteins. At present, however, while we do know that the main acceptor for pADPr <italic>in vivo</italic> is PARP1 protein itself, by PARP1 automodification, the significance of PARP1 automodification for <italic>in vivo</italic> processes is not clear. Therefore, we investigated the roles of PARP1 auto ADP-ribosylation in dynamic nuclear processes during development. Specifically, we discovered that PARP1 automodification is required for shuttling key proteins into Cajal body (CB) by protein non-covalent interaction with pADPr <italic>in vivo</italic>. We hypothesize that PARP1 protein shuttling follows a chain of events whereby, first, most unmodified PARP1 protein molecules bind to chromatin and accumulate in nucleoli, but then, second, upon automodification with poly(ADP-ribose), PARP1 interacts non-covalently with a number of nuclear proteins such that the resulting protein-pADPr complex dissociates from chromatin into CB.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><p>Previous studies revealed vital roles for the Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerase (PARP) protein in developmental program regulation, as well as in chromatin loosening and transcriptional activation. The main gap in our understanding of PARP protein roles during development involves integrating the biological activities of PARP protein into a general network of nuclear protein dynamics and gene expression. Here, we report the functional association of PARP protein activity with proteins trafficking through Cajal bodies. Cajal bodies (CBs) are nuclear organelles that regulate the biogenesis of RNA-protein complexes involved in transcription and splicing. We demonstrate that (1) PARP is present in CBs, (2) its loss leads to CB disassembly, (3) an increase in PARP levels leads to formation of CBs, and, finally, (4) PARP localization is ecdysone sensitive. We further propose a model in which PARP controls protein trafficking through the CB and contributes to CB formation.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="14"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>The basic enzymatic reactions catalyzed by PARP1 involve transferring ADPr from NAD to either a protein acceptor or to an existing poly(ADP-ribose) (pADPr) chain <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000387-DeMurcia1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>. More than thirty pADPr acceptor proteins have been identified. However, multiple observations <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic> have confirmed that the main acceptor of nuclear pADPr <italic>in vivo</italic> is PARP1 protein itself (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000387-DAmours1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>). This suggests that PARP1 automodification plays important roles in the regulation of nuclear functions. To understand these roles, the present study proposes to elucidate the mechanisms of such automodified PARP1 action on nuclear processes.</p><p>Most PARP1 protein binds to chromatin and accumulates in nucleoli <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000387-Meder1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000387-Tulin1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>. Previously, we showed that local activation of transcription in specific domains of chromatin always correlates with local activation of PARP1 protein enzymatic reaction followed by automodification of PARP1 protein within the same chromatin domains <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000387-Kim1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000387-Tulin2">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>. The automodification of PARP1 causes it to dissociate from the chromatin template and lose its ability to synthesize pADPr <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000387-MendozaAlvarez1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000387-Tulin3">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>. This event, however, allows either the automodified PARP1, or free pADPr, to gain another special biological activity by specifically enabling either one to interact non-covalently with a broad class of nuclear proteins which bear a conserved domain recognizing pADPr <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000387-Gagn1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000387-Reale1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>. Thus, automodified PARP1 which accumulates around a particular locus could serve as a local signal for binding and transportation of those proteins, as well as for modification of their biochemical properties. To date, however, no one has shown the functional significance of those interactions <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p><p>Poly(ADP-Ribose)Glycohydrolase (PARG) protein is the only known catalyst of pADPr degradation <italic>in vivo</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000387-Tulin3">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000387-Davidovic1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000387-Hanai1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>. Recently, we demonstrated that loss of PARG reduces overall PARP1 activity by trapping a large fraction of the PARP1 protein in the automodified state, which is removed from active chromatin and then accumulates in specific nucleoplasmic organelles <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000387-Tulin3">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>. These findings raise the possibility that automodified PARP1 targets from chromatin into these organelles and that, consequently, automodified PARP1 could serve as a shuttle to deliver other proteins interacting with pADPr into these organelles. In this paper, we show that those organelles are Cajal bodies (CBs). CBs (also known as &#x0201c;Coiled bodies&#x0201d;) are spherical sub-organelles found in the nucleus of proliferative or metabolically active cells in plant, yeast, and animals. CBs are possible sites of assembly or modification of the transcription machinery of the nucleus <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000387-Cremer1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>. Since PARP1 protein also controls transcription and nucleoli and since automodified PARP1 is targeted into CB, PARP1 could be an important link in this process. Moreover, CBs are often seen attached to the nucleolus and share many nucleolar protein components, such as protein Fibrillarin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000387-Kinderman1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref> and p80 protein coilin which is a common specific marker of CBs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000387-Raska1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref> that we have used in our experiments.</p><p>Here, we show that PARP1 protein interacts with key components of CBs and that the presence of pADPr is critical for their delivery to CB. Specifically, our data show that chromosomal PARP1 molecules become activated by developmental cues, such as ecdysteroid signaling, and are automodified by pADPr. Automodified PARP1 then binds protein components of nucleoli and chromatin. Following that, automodified PARP1 serves as a &#x0201c;shuttle&#x0201d; for protein delivery to Cajal bodies for recycling, thus contributing to protein trafficking through CBs and to the overall stability of Cajal body.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>PARP1 Protein Is an Obligatory Resident of Cajal Bodies</title><p>To study PARP1 protein nuclear localization during <italic>Drosophila</italic> development, we used <italic>Drosophila</italic> stock ubiquitously expressing PARP1-DsRed recombinant protein.

In wild-type nuclei, the automodified PARP1 protein form is represented by a very minor and transient fraction of the total PARP1 protein. Therefore, at all stages of development and in all tissues, most of the PARP1 protein pool is shown to be associated with chromatin. However, using high resolution laser confocal microscopy, we often observed small PARP1-positive (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000387.s001">Figure S1A</xref>) and pADPr-positive extrachromosomal particles (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000387.s001">Figure S1B</xref>), the structural properties, size and localization of which all suggested certain similarities to Cajal bodies (CBs) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000387-Stepanova1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref> and the related organelle, histone locus body (HLB) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000387-Gall1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000387-Liu1">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref>.

No interaction between GFP and Coilin proteins has been detected. Second, we demonstrated that preimmune antibodies do not co-immunoprecipitate PARP protein as well as components of CB and HLB (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000387.s002">Figure S2C</xref>), thus giving additional support to the finding that interactions of PARP1 protein with components of CB and HLB are specific.</p><p>To confirm that intrinsic PARP1 protein interacts with proteins of CB, as well as ectopically expresses, we performed a co-immunoprecipitation experiment using antibody against the C-terminal domain of PARP1 (generous gift of Dr. W.

In order to test whether PARP1 protein is required for CB function, we compared localization of typical CB resident proteins, Fibrillarin and Coilin, in wild-type flies and <italic>PARP1</italic> mutants. In wild-type animals, Coilin protein localizes exclusively in CB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000387-g002">Figure 2A</xref>). Fibrillarin protein occupies CB as well as nucleoli (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000387-g002">Figure 2A</xref>). Fibrillarin and Coilin completely co-localized in the CB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000387-g002">Figure 2A</xref>) and demonstrated physical interaction in co-immunoprecipitation experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000387-g002">Figure 2E</xref>). <italic>Drosophila PARP1</italic> mutants survive until maternally-contributed Parp1 mRNA and PARP1 protein degrade <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000387-Tulin1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>. The earliest phenotype which we detected in those mutants is the relocation of Fibrillarin from CBs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000387-g002">Figure 2B</xref>). At the same time, Fibrillarin still occupies the nucleolus, and CB is detected as a single intact organelle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000387-g002">Figure 2B</xref>). At the later stages, however, we detected the breakdown of single CB into disintegrating Coilin-positive particles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000387-g002">Figure 2C</xref>). Finally, even at the most severe <italic>PARP1</italic> mutant stage, when Fibrillarin relocalized from nucleolus to cytoplasm, we were still able to identify a few small, separated Coilin-containing bodies in nuclei (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000387-g002">Figure 2D</xref>).

Therefore, we suggest that extrachromosomal PARP1, which shuttles into HLB/CB, as indicated above, is automodified.

In the <italic>parg<sup>27.1</sup></italic> mutant nuclei, we found that PARP1 protein is exclusively associated with chromatin until late second-instar larvae (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000387-g004">Figure 4A</xref>). However, at the next step of development, ecdysis III, 60&#x00025; of nuclei demonstrate the appearance of extrachromosomal PARP1-positive particles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000387-g004">Figure 4B</xref>). This same developmental stage demonstrates severe elevation of pADPr by Western blotting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000387-g004">Figure 4G&#x02013;H</xref>). After progressing through ecdysis, in early third-instar larvae, the level of pADPr is decreased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000387-g004">Figure 4G&#x02013;H</xref>), and no nucleoplasmic PARP1 particles are detected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000387-g004">Figure 4C</xref>). The most dramatic accumulation of pADPr is detected in late third-instar and early prepupae (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000387-g004">Figure 4G&#x02013;H</xref>). Those same stages in PARG mutants (100&#x00025; of nuclei) are characterized by progressive relocation of the PARP1 protein from chromatin to nucleoplasmic bodies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000387-g004">Figure 4D&#x02013;E</xref>). These results suggest that PARP1 protein activation and its relocation to HLB/CBs are events linked and sensitive to ecdysteroid signaling and transcriptional activation cascades which accompany this signaling. In late prepupae of Parg mutant cells, no PARP1 protein could be detected in chromatin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000387-g004">Figure 4F</xref>), which suggests that, without PARG, the automodified PARP1 could not be recovered and probably degrades through a protein degradation pathway. Diploid tissues of the <italic>parg<sup>27.1</sup></italic> mutant also demonstrate PARP1 protein relocalization from chromatin into HLB/CBs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000387-g004">Figure 4I&#x02013;J</xref>) in a manner similar to the phenotype described above for polyploid tissue. However, only one HLB/CB-like organelle could be seen in the diploid nucleus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000387-g004">Figure 4J</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000387.s004">Figure S4C</xref>).

Using temperature-inducible hsp::Gal4 activator (gift of G. Cavalli lab), we were also able to suppress <italic>parg<sup>27.1</sup></italic> phenotypes. When expression of hsp::Gal4 was induced before third-instar larvae stage, the PARG-EGFP protein was strongly accumulated in nucleoplasm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000387-g005">Figure 5A, B</xref>). No ectopic PARP1-DsRed-containing bodies were observed in those animals. Moreover, 10&#x02013;20 hours after Gal4 transgene induction, the PARP1-DsRed protein accumulation appeared in a subset of chromosomal loci (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000387-g005">Figure 5A</xref>); after 30 hours, the PARP1-DsRed protein distribution in chromatin was similar to that of the wild-type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000387-g005">Figure 5B</xref>). Late expression of the PARG-EGFP (in third-instar larvae) did not rescue <italic>parg<sup>27.1</sup></italic> mutants. In this case, the accumulation of PARG-EGFP in nucleoplasm still occurs, but the amount of PARG protein is not sufficient to rescue mutant phenotypes. Therefore, the nucleoplasmic bodies persist and absorb the PARP1-DsRed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000387-g005">Figure 5C</xref>). It is also interesting to note that such conditions result in the presence of a detectable amount of PARG-EGFP protein in the HLB/CBs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000387-g005">Figure 5C</xref>). This last result suggests that the PARG protein, as well as PARP1, may be one of the HLB/CB components. Moreover, the same experiment performed with catalytically inactive PARG<sup>AA</sup>-EGFP proteins (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Material and Methods</xref>) does not rescue PARP1 protein localization to chromatin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000387-g005">Figure 5D</xref>) and does not suppress accumulation of pADPr (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000387-g005">Figure 5E</xref>). This, in turn, implicates that the regulation of pADPr turnover may be one function of HLB/CB. If this is true, then poly(ADP-ribosyl)ated proteins necessarily pass through CB, giving further evidence that PARP1 is a key component of the CB transcription machinery, as proposed above. Considered together, these results 1) support the hypothesis that PARG enzyme cleaves pADPr in HLB/CBs and recycles proteins modified in chromatin and nucleoli, including PARP1 protein itself and 2) implicate these processes in maintaining control over the protein flow through Cajal bodies, a dynamic that we have proposed and demonstrated in this report.</p><fig id="pgen-1000387-g005" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pgen.1000387.g005</object-id><label>Figure 5</label><caption><title>The ectopic expression of recombinant PARG-EGFP protein in <italic>Parg<sup>27.1</sup></italic> mutant animals rescues PARP1-DsRed localization to chromatin.</title><p>The expression of UAS::PARG-EGFP transgene was induced in early second-instar larvae (A, B), or in early third-instar larvae (C), using hsp::Gal4 driver induction.

As demonstrated by the results enumerated in this paper, 1) PARP1 regulates protein localization to Cajal body and 2) PARP1 automodification plays a further key regulatory role in this activity. Specifically, PARP1 activation, followed by automodification by PARP1 molecules, is critical for PARP1 protein removal from chromatin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000387-MendozaAlvarez1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref> and subsequent localizing to CB. To accomplish this, PARP1 protein is shuttled between chromatin and CBs.

Beyond protein localization into CB, however, we have further addressed the significance of protein interaction with pADPr <italic>in vivo</italic> in relation to CB integrity. In this paper, we have characterized this phenomenon by testing the mediation of the interaction between the key protein Coilin and other components of CB, such as Fibrillarin. Therefore, since interaction of Coilin and Fibrillarin can be disrupted in PARP1 mutants and since CB has been shown to disintegrate into multiple small particles, we have also demonstrated that PARP1 is crucial for maintaining CB integrity. Thus, we hypothesize that it is the PARP1/PARG protein machinery which provides the mechanism that controls the shuttling of protein complexes between nucleolus and chromatin and CBs.</p><sec id="s3a"><title>Automodified PARP1 Is a Shuttle for Protein Delivery to Cajal Body</title><p>Most detected <italic>in vivo</italic> acceptors of pADPr are chromatin proteins (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000387-DAmours1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>), but the significance of this modification <italic>in vivo</italic> is unclear.

Beyond this possibility, however, the dramatic difference between levels of incorporation of ADPr to PARP1 and to other proteins allows us to hypothesize that acceptors of pADPr are not in and of themselves important. Rather, it is the generation of huge, charged shells of pADPr alone that may cause local changes of nuclear architecture and chromatin structure <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000387-Tulin2">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000387-Althaus1">&#x0005b;31&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000387-Panzeter1">&#x0005b;32&#x0005d;</xref>.

Many components of CBs are shared with the nucleolus, and CBs frequently localize to the nucleolar periphery or within the nucleoli <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000387-Gall2">&#x0005b;41&#x0005d;</xref>. Although their function is not fully understood, recent work suggests that they are involved in several nuclear functions, including modification of small nuclear RNAs and small nuclear ribonucleoproteins. Such modification is important for the assembly of the eukaryotic RNA polymerases that are then transported as multiprotein complexes to specific chromatin domains <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000387-Gall2">&#x0005b;41&#x0005d;</xref>. CBs have been implicated in replication-dependent histone gene transcription and mRNA maturation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000387-Ma1">&#x0005b;42&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000387-Zhao1">&#x0005b;43&#x0005d;</xref>, and a subset of CBs is physically associated with histone gene clusters (HLB) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000387-Frey1">&#x0005b;44&#x0005d;</xref>. Therefore, up to now, a general model of CB function has been represented by preassembly of nuclear protein complexes for their performance. We have, however, suggested that inactivated automodified PARP1 proteins accumulate in CB which leads to the construct of a different model for CBs in the nuclei. Specifically, most previous reports proposed initial (post-synthesis) translocation of a given protein into CBs, followed by modification, assembly and transportation of matured components toward a place of their final destination and work <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000387-Gall1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>. In the case of the <italic>parg<sup>27.1</sup></italic> mutant, however, we detected an opposite order of events with the PARP1 protein. That is, PARP1 is normally localized and active in chromatin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000387-Tulin1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>. Each cycle of PARP1 protein activation then terminates by automodification <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000387-MendozaAlvarez1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000387-Tulin3">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>. Based on our findings, however, PARP1 next relocates from chromatin into CB after its automodification and is subsequently inactivated. In the case of PARP1 protein, at least, because CB is important for recovery of inactive hypermodified protein, this sequence of events necessarily leads to the suggestion that CB is an organelle for the disassembly and recovery of protein complexes after their work has been done and, thus, supports a novel recently suggested paradigm of CB function <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000387-Stanek1">&#x0005b;45&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>In summary, we have demonstrated that poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation is required for protein delivery into CB. Furthermore, interaction of the key protein Coilin with other protein components of CB, such as Fibrillarin, depends upon the activity of PARP1 and PARG proteins. These results provide the first molecular explanation for the roles that PARP1/PARG protein machinery play in the regulation of nucleolar organelle biogenesis and dynamics. Finally, our findings suggest the novel role of CB in nuclear protein recycling and emphasize the importance of increasing our knowledge about the properties of poly(ADP-ribose) dynamics <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title><italic>Drosophila</italic> Strains and Genetics</title><p>Genetic markers are described in FlyBase <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000387-FlyBase1">&#x0005b;46&#x0005d;</xref>, and stocks were obtained from the Bloomington Stock Center, except as indicated. <italic>Parg<sup>27.1</sup></italic> was constructed by Hanai et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000387-Hanai1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>. pP{w1, UAST::PARP1-DsRed}, called UAS::Parp1-DsRed, was described in Tulin et al., 2002 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000387-Tulin1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>.
