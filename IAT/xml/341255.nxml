We have characterized secondary DNA recombination events at two kappa alleles which have undergone misaligned V-J recombinations. One such secondary recombination has joined the flanking sequences of a V kappa and a J kappa 2 gene segment as if it were the reciprocal product of a V-J kappa 2 recombination, and resulted in the displacement of the recombined VJ kappa 1 gene segments from the C kappa locus. The non-rearranged form of the V kappa fragment which had recombined with the J kappa 2 flank was cloned. Nucleotide sequencing of this fragment identified a V kappa gene that differed by at least 38% from all previously sequenced human V kappa genes. The other V-J kappa segment analyzed has undergone a secondary recombination at a different site from that described above, at a site within the intervening sequence between the J kappa and C kappa gene segments, similar to the location of secondary recombinations which have occurred in lambda + B cell lines from mice and humans (2,3). These results prove that multiple recombinations can occur at one J kappa-C kappa locus.</p><sec><title>Images</title><fig id="F1"><graphic xlink:href="nar00304-0105-a" xlink:role="3499"/></fig><fig id="F2"><graphic xlink:href="nar00304-0112-a" xlink:role="3506"/></fig></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><supplementary-material content-type="scanned-pages"><graphic xlink:href="nar00304-0101.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="3495"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00304-0102.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="3496"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00304-0103.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="3497"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00304-0104.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="3498"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00304-0105.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="3499"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00304-0106.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="3500"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00304-0107.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="3501"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00304-0108.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="3502"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00304-0109.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="3503"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00304-0110.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="3504"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00304-0111.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="3505"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00304-0112.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="3506"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00304-0113.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="3507"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00304-0114.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="3508"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00304-0115.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="3509"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00304-0116.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="3510"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00304-0117.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="3511"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00304-0118.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="3512"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00304-0119.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="3513"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00304-0120.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="3514"/></supplementary-material></body></article>
