The mechanism behind Ptch1-dependent Smo inhibition remains unresolved. We now show that by mixing Ptch1-transfected and Ptch1 small interfering RNA&#x02013;transfected cells with Gli reporter cells, Ptch1 is capable of non&#x02013;cell autonomous repression of Smo. The magnitude of this non&#x02013;cell autonomous repression of Smo activity was comparable to the fusion of Ptch1-transfected cell lines and Gli reporter cell lines, suggesting that it is the predominant mode of action. CHOD-PAP analysis of medium conditioned by Ptch1-transfected cells showed an elevated 3&#x003b2;-hydroxysteroid content, which we hypothesized to mediate the Smo inhibition. Indeed, the inhibition of 3&#x003b2;-hydroxysteroid synthesis impaired Ptch1 action on Smo, whereas adding the 3&#x003b2;-hydroxysteroid (pro-)vitamin D3 to the medium effectively inhibited Gli activity. Vitamin D3 bound to Smo with high affinity in a cyclopamine-sensitive manner. Treating zebrafish embryos with vitamin D3 mimicked the <italic>smo</italic><sup>&#x02013;/&#x02013;</sup> phenotype, confirming the inhibitory action in vivo. Hh activates its signalling cascade by inhibiting Ptch1-dependent secretion of the 3&#x003b2;-hydroxysteroid (pro-)vitamin D3. This action not only explains the seemingly contradictory cause of Smith-Lemli-Opitz syndrome (SLOS), but also establishes Hh as a unique morphogen, because binding of Hh on one cell is capable of activating Hh-dependent signalling cascades on other cells. </p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="toc"><p>The authors show that patched can inhibit smoothened activity by promoting transport of Vitamin D3 (which binds Smo), addressing a long-standing mystery in hedgehog signaling.

For instance, Hh signalling is mediated by two membrane proteins: patched (Ptch1) and smoothened (Smo). The former is a 12-pass transmembrane protein &#x0005b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040232-b002">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040232-b003">3</xref>&#x0005d; resembling the Niemann-Pick disease type C1 (NPC1) protein (which is involved in cholesterol trafficking and has a pump function); the latter is a seven-pass transmembrane protein that resembles a G protein&#x02013;coupled receptor &#x0005b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040232-b004">4</xref>&#x0005d;. In the absence of the inhibitory receptor Ptch1 (or in the case of a specific mutation rendering Ptch1 dysfunctional), Smo is constitutively active and leads to the activation and nuclear translocation of its downstream transcription factor glioma associated (Gli). Under normal physiological circumstances, the activation of the signalling pathway is caused by binding of Hh to Ptch1, resulting in the internalisation of Ptch1 and, consequently, the alleviation of the inhibitory effect of Ptch1 on Smo &#x0005b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040232-b005">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040232-b006">6</xref>&#x0005d;. The exact mechanism behind Ptch1 inhibition of Smo, however, remains unclear &#x0005b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040232-b007">7</xref>&#x0005d;. </p><p>Similarities in the phenotypes of humans with inherited disorders of sterol biosynthesis ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040232-g001">Figure 1</xref>A, lathosterolosis and Smith-Lemli-Opitz syndrome &#x0005b;SLOS&#x0005d;) and the phenotypes seen with mutations in the Hh signalling pathway have led to the suggestion that cholesterol-synthesizing enzymes may somehow be involved in Ptch1-dependent Smo inhibition &#x0005b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040232-b001">1</xref>&#x0005d;. Sterol content has been found to be crucial to a cell's responsiveness to Hh, independent of proper Hh sterolation &#x0005b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040232-b008">8</xref>&#x0005d;, suggesting that sterol&#x02014;or more specifically cholesterol&#x02014;levels are pivotal to a cell's ability to respond to Hh, rather than to the accumulation of a specific inhibitory metabolite. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040232-g001">Figure 1</xref>B depicts the proposed possible modes of Ptch1 action on Smo. Because Ptch1 and Smo do not unambiguously show physical association and because Ptch1 can inhibit Smo substoichiometrically, direct binding of Ptch1 to Smo as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040232-g001">Figures 1</xref>B, columns 1 and 2, seems an unlikely mechanism of inhibition &#x0005b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040232-b009">9</xref>&#x0005d;. Ptch1 shares high homology (for instance, a sterol-sensing domain) with NPC1, a protein involved in cholesterol trafficking &#x0005b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040232-b010">10</xref>&#x0005d;, as well as with various (prokaryotic) pump proteins. Also, several small molecules with homology to cholesterol that act as Hh pathway antagonists have been identified &#x0005b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040232-b011">11</xref>&#x02013; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040232-b013">13</xref>&#x0005d;. Cyclopamine, a well-known antagonist of Smo, has been widely used for assessing the effects of Hh pathway inhibition in several model systems (for example, in &#x0005b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040232-b014">14</xref>&#x0005d;). Consequently, it has been anticipated that in the absence of Hh, Ptch1 translocates a small molecule resembling cholesterol across the membrane, acting as a Smo antagonist. This hypothesis is summarized in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040232-g001">Figure 1</xref>B, column 3. </p><p>A consequence of the proposed &#x0201c;pump&#x0201d; model for Ptch1 is that the action of Ptch1 should be non&#x02013;cell autonomous. We set out to test this prediction, and we established that Hh activates its signalling cascade by inhibiting Ptch1-dependent secretion of the 3&#x003b2;-hydroxysteroid (pro-)vitamin D3. These data provide fundamental new insight into the molecular mechanisms by which Hh exerts its action in pathophysiology.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>A Model System for Measuring Ptch1-Dependent Smo Inhibition</title><p>An experimental system allowing the study of intercellular inhibitory actions of Ptch1 on Smo should fulfill four requirements: (1) cells must be capable of sustaining Ptch1 expression, (2) expressed Ptch1 must be functionally active, (3) the inhibition of Gli activity should be Smo-mediated, and (4) endogenous Hh should not be a contributing factor. To set up a model system for studying Ptch1-dependent inhibition, C3H/10T1/2 fibroblasts, which are cells extensively used for Hh research, were transfected with an 8&#x000d7; Gli&#x02013;binding site luciferase construct &#x0005b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040232-b015">15</xref>&#x0005d; together with Ptch1, Smo, Smo and Ptch1, or Gli1. </p><p>Overexpression of Ptch1 drove cells into apoptosis (unpublished data, consistent with &#x0005b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040232-b016">16</xref>&#x0005d;), possibly a reflection of the function of Ptch1 as a so-called dependence receptor. To overcome this problem, we performed experiments in the presence of 20 &#x003bc;M caspase inhibitor zVADfmk. Under these conditions, transfection with a Ptch1 expression construct led to efficient overexpression of Ptch1 as detected by Western blot ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040232-g002">Figure 2</xref>A). Transfection of Ptch1 effectively inhibited transactivation of the Gli reporter in the presence of overexpressed Smo ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040232-g002">Figure 2</xref>B). The Ptch1-insensitive mutant SmoM2 &#x0005b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040232-b011">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040232-b017">17</xref>&#x0005d; was not inhibited by Ptch1 cotransfection and showed a high basal Gli activity. Ptch1 transfection in the absence of Smo overexpression yielded no inhibition below control values, which has been described previously &#x0005b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040232-b018">18</xref>&#x0005d;. This finding suggests the presence of high basal Ptch1 levels and indicates the specificity of Ptch1 inhibition acting through Smo in our system. The inhibitory effect of the high basal Ptch1 levels could be overcome by the addition of 1 &#x003bc;g/ml recombinant N-terminal Sonic hedgehog (Shh) for 6 h, as can be seen from the high reporter activity upon stimulation ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040232-g002">Figure 2</xref>B). Addition of 1 &#x003bc;g/ml 5E1 Shh-blocking antibody &#x0005b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040232-b019">19</xref>&#x0005d; could counteract the stimulation by Shh. Because Smo and Gli overexpression were capable of increasing transactivation of the Gli reporter despite the presence of a caspase inhibitor, our experimental system is a valid readout for Smo-mediated Gli activity. </p><p>The requirement for Smo overexpression to respond to Ptch1 inhibition and the high responsiveness to exogenously added Shh suggest that endogenous Hh production is not a major factor in our setup, although others have shown mRNA for Indian hedgehog (Ihh) and Shh in C3H/10T1/2 cells &#x0005b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040232-b020">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040232-b021">21</xref>&#x0005d;. To exclude Hh protein excretion by our C3H/10T1/2 cells as a contributing factor in our model system, we performed Western blot analysis on Shh-spiked medium and medium from fibroblast cell culture. The cells did not excrete Hh protein ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040232-g002">Figure 2</xref>C). As can be seen, the detection limit was about 5 ng/ml, which was not reached in the (4&#x000d7; concentrated) medium, indicating that the Hh concentration in the medium was less than 1.25 ng/ml, a concentration too low to evoke a response &#x0005b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040232-b022">22</xref>&#x0005d;. Reprobing the blot for Ihh did not yield a signal for the medium either. </p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Ptch1 Can Inhibit Smo in a Non&#x02013;Cell Autonomous Fashion</title><p>To assess the ability of Ptch1 to act upon Smo on another cell, we used a &#x0201c;mix-and-match&#x0201d; approach (as schematically shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040232-g003">Figure 3</xref>A), in which two populations of cells are mixed. The donor population expresses Ptch1 at different levels (using an overexpression construct or small interfering RNA &#x0005b;siRNA&#x0005d;) that could act on reporter cells with a constitutively active Hh pathway (reporter cells: Smo receptor overexpressed and a Gli-luciferase reporter). We mixed reporter cells with vector, Ptch1, Ptch1 siRNA and scrambled control siRNA transfectants. Cell populations were detached by EDTA treatment, mixed, and replated. By using two fluorescent tracers for labelling the cell populations, the capability of this procedure to obtain a homogenous mixture could be assessed. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040232-g003">Figure 3</xref>A shows that combining two cell populations yields evenly mixed cells with intimate cell-cell contacts (micrograph). When Gli reporter cells were mixed with Ptch1- overexpressing cells in these mix-and-match experiments, a significant reduction in Smo-mediated Gli activation could be seen compared with control. This inhibition could not be diminished by addition of 1 &#x003bc;g/ml 5E1 Hh-blocking antibody ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040232-g003">Figure 3</xref>A), again demonstrating that endogenous Hh is not a contributing factor in our experimental setup. This is important, specifically because the presence of Hh in the medium would increase reporter activity. As Ptch1 scavenges Hh from the medium, medium of Ptch1-overexpressing cells would contain lower Hh levels than would control or Ptch1 siRNA-transfected cells. The reduction in reporter activity as consequence of such scavenging would mask the action of a potential inhibitory molecule. The addition of 1 &#x003bc;g/ml recombinant Shh, which should inhibit Ptch1 present in these experiments, was able to abolish the inhibition conferred by Ptch1. Mixing reporter cells with Ptch1 siRNA-transfected cells increased Smo-dependent reporter activity ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040232-g003">Figure 3</xref>A, blue bars), demonstrating that the inhibition is Ptch1 dependent and again suggests that C3H/10T1/2 cells have a significant basal level of Ptch1 activity. Showing opposite effects of Ptch1 siRNA versus DNA excludes any overexpression artefacts from responsibility for the observed non&#x02013;cell autonomous effect. To exclude cell-specific artefacts, the procedures were also performed with MDA-MB-231 breast tumour cells, which had even higher levels of endogenous PTCH1 and SMO than the C3H/10T1/2 fibroblasts (Western blot, unpublished data). Indeed, using these cells yielded similar but more pronounced effects, as did the C3H/10T1/2 cells ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040232-g003">Figure 3</xref>A, hatched bars). </p><p>To determine the maximal inhibition Ptch1 confers in a cell-autonomous fashion&#x02014;that is, the extent to which Ptch1 can inhibit Smo on the same cell&#x02014;we mixed and fused the two previously described cell populations. PEG1500 induced efficient cell fusion, which was evident from blended staining of PEG1500-treated cells and the multinucleated cells (procedure and micrographs shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040232-g003">Figure 3</xref>B, left panel). Fusion of reporter cells with Ptch1-overexpressing cells again showed a reduction in Gli activation, similar to that observed in the mix-and-match experiments ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040232-g003">Figure 3</xref>A). The reduction in reporter activity was of the same magnitude as that obtained in the mixing experiments. Therefore, we conclude that Ptch1 inhibition of Gli reporter activity in our system is mediated mainly intercellularly. </p><p>The specificity of the observed inhibitory action of Ptch1 acting through Smo was assessed by using the Ptch1-insensitive SmoM2 mutant, as previously shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040232-g002">Figure 2</xref>B. As can be seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040232-g003">Figure 3</xref>C, SmoM2-transfected reporter cells are no longer sensitive to mixing with Ptch1-overexpressing donor cells, even when cotransfected with wild-type Smo. These findings led us to suggest the model for Ptch1 action as depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040232-g001">Figure 1</xref>B, column 3, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040232-g003">Figure 3</xref>D, in which Ptch1 on one cell is capable of specifically inhibiting Smo on another cell, to act non&#x02013;cell autonomously. </p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Non&#x02013;Cell Autonomous Ptch1-Dependent Smo Inhibition Is Carried Out by a Medium-Borne Factor</title><p>The intercellular Ptch1-mediated inhibition of Smo as identified in the mix-and-match experiments may be conferred by either an inhibitory molecule secreted or translocated by Ptch1 or by diffusion of a cytosolic mediator through tight junctions. The latter possibility is less likely, because it would result in a merged fluorophore signal in the mixed cell population, which was not observed ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040232-g003">Figure 3</xref>A). Indeed, important support for the possibility that Ptch1 secretes a Smo inhibitory molecule into the medium was obtained from experiments in which medium conditioned on Ptch1 <italic>-</italic>transfected cells was transferred to reporter cells in which Gli activity was assayed (procedure schematically shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040232-g004">Figure 4</xref>A, left panel). </p><p>By using this experimental setup, we found that medium conditioned on Ptch1 <italic>-</italic>transfected cells exerted a strong inhibitory effect on Gli activation as compared with medium conditioned on control-transfected cells ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040232-g004">Figure 4</xref>A). This inhibition could not be blocked by the addition of 1 &#x003bc;g/ml Shh or 5E1 to the reporter cells. The inability of Shh to prevent Ptch1-conditioned, medium-dependent inhibition of Smo activity is expected, because the transferred medium does not contain donor cells expressing Ptch1 on which Shh should exert its action, and the presence of the medium-borne factor in the Ptch1-conditioned medium shortcuts the function of endogenous Ptch1 in the reporter cells. Using MDA-MB-231 cells in this setup, similar results were obtained ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040232-g004">Figure 4</xref>A, hatched bars). As for the mix-and-match experiments, medium conditioned on Ptch1 siRNA-transfected cells increased Smo-dependent reporter activity in both cell lines. Medium conditioned on mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) from <italic>Ptch1</italic> knockout mice &#x0005b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040232-b023">23</xref>&#x0005d; showed a distinct deficiency in their capacity to inhibit Smo compared with medium conditioned on wild-type ( <italic>Ptch1 <sup>&#x0002b;/&#x0002b;</sup></italic>) MEFs ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040232-g004">Figure 4</xref>, pink bars). This inhibitory effect could again not be conferred to reporter cells transfected with the Ptch1-insensitive SmoM2. The opposite effects, as observed with Ptch1 DNA transfection versus either Ptch1 siRNA transfection (blue bars) or genetic Ptch1-deficient MEFs, exclude transfection artefacts on the donor cells as the potential cause of the observed effects. Overall, these findings suggest that Ptch1 transfers a molecule to the medium that inhibits Smo activity. Medium conditioned on Ptch1-overexpressing MDA-MD-231 cells could inhibit Gli activity in C3H/10T1/2 cells and vice versa (unpublished data), suggesting that the inhibitory factor is not species-specific, at least not among mammals. </p><p>Using serum-free medium, we could confer no inhibitory action of Ptch1-conditioned medium on reporter cells ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040232-g004">Figure 4</xref>A). Serum-free medium contains no lipoproteins, which implies an important role for lipoproteins in conveying the inhibitory signal from cell to cell. Alternatively, serum-free medium also lacks lipids, which could stress the necessity for lipids supplied in the medium for Hh responsiveness &#x0005b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040232-b008">8</xref>&#x0005d;. However, serum-free conditions for 8 h (the incubation time in our experiments) do not deplete a cell's cholesterol metabolism, arguing in favour of a role for lipoproteins in communicating the inhibitory signal. </p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>Ptch1-Dependent Secretion of 3&#x003b2;-Hydroxysteroids</title><p>The conditioned media were subjected to fast performance liquid chromatography (FPLC)-coupled cholesterol oxidase peroxidase-amidopyrine (CHOD-PAP) analysis, a technique that analyzes 3&#x003b2;-hydroxysteroid content. The Ptch1-conditioned medium was found to be enriched with 3&#x003b2;-hydroxysteroids relative to medium conditioned by control cells ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040232-g004">Figure 4</xref>B and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040232-g004">4</xref>C; quantification of FPLC profiles as mM total 3&#x003b2;-hydroxysteroid). Judging from the retention profile, these 3&#x003b2;-hydroxysteroids were present on low-density lipoprotein (LDL) particles and, to a lesser extent, on very-low-density lipoprotein (VLDL). High-density lipoprotein (HDL) 3&#x003b2;-hydroxysteroid levels remained constant in all conditions. Medium incubated on cells transfected with siRNA for Ptch1 was virtually devoid of LDL-associated 3&#x003b2;-hydroxysteroids. This correlation between modified Ptch1 levels and the accumulation of 3&#x003b2;-hydroxysteroid molecules in the medium suggests that Ptch1 translocates or pumps these 3&#x003b2;-hydroxysteroids into the medium and thereby transfers the Smo inhibitory activity. </p></sec><sec id="s2e"><title>3&#x003b2;-Hydroxysteroids Are Necessary for Ptch1-Dependent Smo Inhibition</title><p>In the presence of pravastatin, a 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitor that abrogates the biosynthesis of the 3&#x003b2;-hydroxysteroid precursor mevalonate ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040232-g001">Figure 1</xref>A), LDL-associated 3&#x003b2;-hydroxysteroid (named LDL-C on axis) levels were substantially reduced ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040232-g004">Figure 4</xref>C), and, correspondingly, reduced Gli inhibition was observed in Ptch1-overexpressing reporter cells as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040232-g004">Figure 4</xref>D.

This fits the observation that UV treatment enhanced the inhibitory potential of Ptch1-conditioned medium ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040232-g005">Figure 5</xref>B).

The magnitude of inhibition conveyed by either the transfer of Ptch1 transfectant&#x02013;conditioned medium or Ptch1 cotransfection were both smaller than that of vitamin D3. In addition, inhibition conferred by vitamin D3 was stronger than that of 10 &#x003bc;M cyclopamine. The finding that AY-9944 was not a necessity for inhibitory action excludes a role for sterol deprivation in this model ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040232-g001">Figure 1</xref>A), because the exogenously added 7-DHC or vitamin D3 can be readily metabolized by these (wild-type) fibroblasts to produce downstream sterols. </p><p>Shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040232-g006">Figure 6</xref>B is a dose-dependent response of reporter cells to vitamin D3 for 6 h.

Using SmoM2-transfected reporter cells, Gli reporter inhibition occurred only at 100 &#x003bc;M vitamin D3, and below that concentration, no inhibition could be observed.

Thus, the inhibitory effect of vitamin D3 on Gli reporter activity appears to be a genuine effect of Smo-dependent signalling. </p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040232-g006">Figure 6</xref>D shows Gli reporter inhibition by vitamin D3 in the cell lines C3H/10T1/2 and MDA-MB-231 previously used in the mix-and-match and medium transfer experiments.

By mixing Ptch1-expressing cells with cells expressing Smo and a Gli reporter, we were able to show that Ptch1 is capable of non&#x02013;cell autonomous repression of Smo. This non&#x02013;cell autonomous repression is carried by the extracellular medium, because medium conditioned by Ptch1-transfected cells was capable of inhibiting Gli reporter activity as well. Conversely, medium conditioned by cells transfected with Ptch1 siRNA (so lacking endogenous Ptch1 expression) elevated Gli reporter activity significantly above medium that was conditioned by control cells, demonstrating that Ptch1 overexpression is not a prerequisite for observing this cell non-autonomous repression of Smo by Ptch1. Mixing Ptch1-overexpression cells with cells expressing Smo and Gli reporter produced inhibition of Gli reporter activity to approximately the same extent as fusing these cells, showing that this non&#x02013;cell autonomous repression of Smo by Ptch1 is of roughly similar potency compared to intracellular Smo repression by Ptch1. This result suggests that this intercellular repression constitutes an important physiological mechanism. In this context, it is important to note that Hh quenching was not a major contributing factor in our experimental system, because Hh-neutralising antibodies do not interfere with Ptch1-dependent intercellular repression of Smo and we were not able to detect Hh release by the cells.</p><p>Conditioning medium with Ptch1-transfected cells led to the appearance of a 3&#x003b2;-hydroxysteroid in this medium, suggesting that this compound is increasingly translocated into the medium as a consequence of elevated Ptch1 expression. These results are concordant with the observation that Smo antagonists bear structural similarities to steroids &#x0005b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040232-b012">12</xref>&#x0005d; and the high homology of Ptch1 to the NPC1 protein, which has cholesterol trafficking and pump functions &#x0005b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040232-b010">10</xref>&#x0005d;, as well as to various prokaryotic pump proteins. These homologies gave rise to the suggestion that, in the absence of Hh, Ptch1 pumps a compound out of the cell that binds to and inhibits Smo, and the data from this study confirm this model. Transfection of Ptch1 siRNA abolished deposition of this 3&#x003b2;-hydroxysteroid into the medium when compared to control-transfected cells, showing that 3&#x003b2;-hydroxysteroid translocation is not an artefact of Ptch1 overexpression, but that endogenous Ptch1 expression levels are sufficient to sustain detectable 3&#x003b2;-hydroxysteroid translocation. This 3&#x003b2;-hydroxysteroid translocation seems important for the intercellular repression of Smo by Ptch1, because in the presence of 3&#x003b2;-hydroxysteroid synthesis inhibitors Ptch1 was no longer capable of repressing Smo, whereas artificial stimulation of 3&#x003b2;-hydroxysteroid biosynthesis by using mevalonate supplementation enhanced the inhibitory potential of Ptch1 on Smo. </p><p>The 3&#x003b2;-hydroxysteroid responsible for intercellular repression of Smo is most likely the (pro-)vitamin D3 (that is, either 7-DHC or its metabolite vitamin D3) or a highly similar molecule. Fibroblasts derived from animals genetically incapable of synthesizing these 3&#x003b2;-hydroxysteroids <italic>(Sc5d <sup>&#x02013;/&#x02013;</sup>) </italic> do not sustain intercellular repression of Smo by Ptch1, whereas fibroblasts that have a genetic defect leading to increased (pro-)vitamin D3 production <italic>(Dhcr7 <sup>&#x02013;/&#x02013;</sup>) </italic> show exaggerated intercellular repression of Smo by Ptch1. Exogenous addition of vitamin D3 was more efficient in inhibiting Gli reporter activity than the established Smo antagonist cyclopamine. SmoM2, which has a reduced sensitivity towards cyclopamine, showed diminished sensitivity to vitamin D3 as well. In Scatchard assays, cyclopamine and vitamin D3 competed for Smo binding, suggesting that both compounds have an identical binding site on Smo. Scatchard analysis using the precursor 7-DHC as a competitor revealed a 10-fold lower affinity for Smo than did vitamin D3 or the hydroxylated (active) form of vitamin D3 (unpublished data). Treatment of <named-content content-type="genus-species">Danio rerio</named-content> embryos with vitamin D3 phenocopied most of the aspects of the <italic>smo <sup>&#x02013;/&#x02013;</sup></italic> phenotype in zebrafish. These findings strongly suggest that Ptch1 translocates either vitamin D3, a related molecule, or possibly a precursor that is subsequently metabolised in the extracellular medium that acts as a Smo antagonist. </p><p>Our findings shed light on the puzzling biochemical basis of SLOS, in which accumulation of 7-DHC ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040232-g001">Figure 1</xref>A) accompanies a reduced cholesterol content and a seemingly decreased Hh signalling &#x0005b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040232-b038">38</xref>&#x0005d;. Previously, the SLOS phenotype has been mimicked by using AY-9944 &#x0005b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040232-b025">25</xref>&#x0005d;, which inhibits 7-DHC reductase ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040232-g001">Figure 1</xref>A), leading to the accumulation of its substrate. This result suggests that this molecule mediates Hh inhibition. Treatment of patients with a cholesterol-rich diet, however, has been successful, and statin treatment does not seem to alleviate the symptoms, suggesting that the lack of cholesterol is the culprit &#x0005b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040232-b038">38</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040232-b039">39</xref>&#x0005d;.

Although these findings seem to preclude the stacking of a specific metabolite to be responsible for the SLOS phenotype, it has become clear that the clinical phenotype correlates best with the ratio of 7-DHC to cholesterol levels in patient plasma rather than the levels of cholesterol alone. Also, the treatment of infants with cholesterol is arguably too late an intervention, because most of the Hh patterning events are completed in utero. Our experiments show that even in the absence of AY-9944, addition of vitamin D3 strongly inhibits Hh signalling. This inhibition is stronger than Ptch1 cotransfection and Ptch1-transfectant conditioned medium, and we therefore conclude that the stacking of 7-DHC is responsible for the SLOS phenotype. </p><p>Very relevant to this manuscript and the abovementioned studies are the findings of Cooper et al., who found that reduced sterol levels impair a cell's responsiveness to Hh &#x0005b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040232-b008">8</xref>&#x0005d;. By using fibroblasts from mice genetically deficient for the enzymes involved in lathosterolosis (Sc5d) and SLOS (Dhcr7) and by depleting lipids and sterols from the medium, they showed that sterol levels were crucial to a cell's responsiveness to Hh. By analyzing the Hh protein in these cells under the various conditions, they could demonstrate proper Hh maturation, thereby excluding improper Hh sterolation as the cause of SLOS. They did not, however, hypothesize an inhibitory role for excess cholesterol precursors. We explain our hypothesis and findings in light of their results: by genetic and/or medium condition causes, steroid synthesis is seriously impaired in cells in their experiments. As a result, 7-DHC levels will drop, leaving Ptch1 devoid of substrate. Without substrate to pump or translocate, Ptch1 is &#x0201c;paralysed&#x0201d;, and addition of Hh will not exert an effect, explaining the reduced responsiveness. Hh responsiveness does not equal pathway activity, and the absence of Ptch1 substrate will diminish responsiveness but not pathway activity. Because both cell lines share the inability to properly synthesize cholesterol, and because we find a differential inhibitory potential on Smo, we conclude that sterol content alone cannot account for Ptch1-mediated Smo inhibition, and we suggest that the effects found by other groups take place elsewhere in the Hh signalling pathway. In our system, LDL seems to be a prerequisite for the diffusion of the inhibitory molecule, and, recently, a similar requirement has also been found for the distribution of Hh itself &#x0005b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040232-b041">41</xref>&#x0005d;. </p><p>Although the present study clearly demonstrates that Ptch1 can inhibit Smo in an intercellular fashion, we have not addressed whether such intercellular action of Ptch1 on Smo is relevant for Hh action in vivo. Vitamin D3 is highly hydrophobic and is not expected to diffuse very far in the aqueous environment that surrounds cells. We observed that in the absence of LDL as a carrier for the hydrophobic Smo inhibitor, intercellular repression of Smo activity was undetectable. Hence, although Ptch1 exports (pro-)vitamin D3, it might act on Smo on the same cell (and thus function cell autonomously) or, depending on the cell's surroundings, on Smo on adjacent cells (and thus function non&#x02013;cell autonomously). Nevertheless, the expression of Ptch1 and Smo is often discordant, with Ptch1 expression being in the vicinity of Smo-expressing cells, without complete colocalisation &#x0005b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040232-b042">42</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040232-b043">43</xref>&#x0005d;. We observed that in cardiac nerve branch ganglia, Smo and Ptch1 colocalise in the bronchial cartilage and epithelium, but not in the ganglion itself. In the ganglion, a pronounced staining for Ptch1 can be seen, whereas Smo staining is observed in only the adjacent cells. These findings are suggestive for intercellular signalling actually occurring in vivo (MF Bijlsma, unpublished data). In contrast with these findings are earlier reported experiments by Briscoe et al. &#x0005b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040232-b044">44</xref>&#x0005d; in which a Hh uninhabitable form of Ptch1 (Ptch1 <sup>&#x00394;loop2</sup>) was evaluated with respect to its effects on Hh signalling in <named-content content-type="genus-species">Drosophila melanogaster</named-content> and <named-content content-type="genus-species">Gallus gallus</named-content> embryogenesis. The results obtained in this study suggest that the border of Ptch1 <sup>&#x00394;loop2</sup> expression more or less corresponds with the boundary of Hh-induced gene expression. Thus, it would appear that in these experimental systems, a Smo-inhibitory, vitamin D3&#x02013;like ligand has not much capacity to diffuse over multiple cell layers. We therefore suggest that the action of Ptch1 can be cell autonomous or non&#x02013;cell autonomous in various in vivo situations, perhaps dependent on the presence or absence of molecules that can carry the hydrophobic ligand over larger distances and subsequently present this molecule to Smo. </p><p>Recently it was demonstrated that Hh-bound Ptch1 could titrate the inhibitory action of the abovementioned Ptch1 <sup>&#x00394;loop2</sup>. Furthermore, Hh-bound Ptch1 allowed Smo signalling to occur even in the presence of a Ptch1 form that is incapable of binding Hh &#x0005b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040232-b045">45</xref>&#x0005d;. This observation is inconsistent with a model in which Ptch1 serves to translocate a Smo-inhibitory molecule out of the cell, because in this model, Ptch1 action would depend on the amount of unliganded Ptch1, not the amount of liganded Ptch1. Casali and Struhl provide as a possible explanation for the titration effect that liganded and unliganded Ptch1 compete for access to Smo: Ptch1 acts as a multimer in which binding of Hh to any of the subunits blocks the action of the complex, or liganded and unliganded Ptch1 exert counteracting catalytic activities. Only the latter explanation seems consistent with the data presented in this study; the other explanation requires Ptch1 to function in a cell-autonomous fashion. Hence, it is possible that unliganded Ptch1 translocates a Smo inhibitor to extracellular medium, whereas Hh-bound Ptch1 would transport this inhibitor to the cytosol. Alternatively, Hh-bound Ptch1 is internalized, and it is possible that in this process it cointernalizes the Ptch1 <sup>&#x00394;loop2</sup> protein, especially if both proteins would localize to the same plasma membrane compartment&#x02014;for example, lipid rafts. Support for this notion might be deduced from the strong Hh-dependent endocytosis we observed in the present study, suggesting that endocytosis is indeed a major cellular response to Hh binding to Ptch1. But further studies are needed to address the exact mode by which wild-type Ptch1 impairs Ptch1 <sup>&#x00394;loop2</sup> function. </p><p>Activation of the Hh pathway is, under certain conditions, associated with the development of cancer, especially in the upper digestive tract &#x0005b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040232-b046">46</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040232-b047">47</xref>&#x0005d; and in basal cell carcinoma in the skin, where this disease is linked to mutations in Ptch1 &#x0005b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040232-b048">48</xref>&#x02013; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040232-b051">51</xref>&#x0005d;. Intercellular action of Ptch1 will allow this molecule to exert its action as a tumour suppressor, on not only the Ptch1-expressing cell but also neighbouring cells that may have acquired inactivating mutations of Ptch1, making this mode of Ptch1-dependent Smo inhibition especially attractive with respect to tumour suppression. Thus, it will be interesting to investigate whether intercellular repression of Smo by Ptch1 actually contributes to tumour suppression in vivo. Experiments addressing this possibility are currently in progress. </p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Constructs/siRNA used.</title><p>Mouse Ptch1 (a generous gift of Dr. M.

The Hh pathway is active, and Gli activity can be measured in a reporter assay. Second panel: in the absence of Hh, Ptch1 is active and uses vitamin D3 to inhibit Smo. The pathway is inactive, and low Gli activity is measured. Third panel: in the presence of Hh as well as exogenous D3, Smo is inhibited independently of Ptch1, and Hh can no longer elicit a Gli response.</p><p>(F) Confluent Shh-LIGHT II stable Gli reporter transfectants were stimulated with 10 &#x003bc;M vitamin D3 and/or 200 ng/ml Shh overnight in the presence of 0.5&#x00025; FCS. Luciferase activity was assayed; values are RLU values corrected for an internal CMV Renilla standard and expressed as percent difference to control stimulated cells (0 &#x003bc;M vitamin D3; 0 ng/ml Shh). In the presence of vitamin D3, Shh is no longer able to induce reporter activity. <italic>n</italic> &#x0003d; 4; depicted is the mean &#x000b1; SEM. </p></caption><graphic xlink:href="pbio.0040232.g006"/></fig><fig id="pbio-0040232-g007" position="float"><label>Figure 7</label><caption><title>Scatchard Analysis of Vitamin D3 Using Smo-Expressing <named-content content-type="genus-species">P. pastoris</named-content></title><p>(A) 24 h methanol induction (buffered methanol-complex medium; BMMY) of Smo-transformed <named-content content-type="genus-species">P. pastoris</named-content> yielded successful Smo expression as shown by Western blot analysis with an antibody directed against Smo. </p><p>(B) Scatchard analysis of heterologous competition with cyclopamine representing the binding of &#x0005b;3H&#x0005d;-D3 to Smo-expressing (solid circles, MeOH induced) and nonexpressing (open circles, noninduced) yeast strains.

At the different developmental stages (as indicated), the embryos were analysed, revealing persistent somite malformations, a ventrally curved body, poorly developed myoseptum, an aberrant extension of the yolk tube, a prominent dorsal midbrain, and a reduced trunk. The wild-type Engrailed staining (4D9) of muscle pioneers and surrounding cells in control-treated animals was not observed upon vitamin D3 treatment.
