Comparison on the nucleotide and protein level of three H-2K alleles (Kk, Kb and Kd) reveals a high degree of homology, in particular between the Kb and Kk alleles. Differences between the two latter antigens are almost exclusively confined to the alpha 1 and alpha 2 domains. At nine positions in the extracellular part of the molecules we have found allele-specific amino acids. Interestingly, 78% of these residues are either polar or carry hydroxyl-groups. This makes it likely that they are exposed on the surface of the molecules and might then be part of antigenic determinants. We have also identified potentially allele-specific nucleotide sequences of the K genes which might be used as specific DNA probes.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><supplementary-material content-type="scanned-pages"><graphic xlink:href="nar00342-0250.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="9473"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00342-0251.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="9474"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00342-0252.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="9475"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00342-0253.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="9476"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00342-0254.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="9477"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00342-0255.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="9478"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00342-0256.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="9479"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00342-0257.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="9480"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00342-0258.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="9481"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00342-0259.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="9482"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00342-0260.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="9483"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00342-0261.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="9484"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00342-0262.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="9485"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00342-0263.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="9486"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00342-0264.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="9487"/></supplementary-material></body></article>
