These effects are mediated by cannabinoids binding to peripheral, spinal and supraspinal CB1 and CB2 receptors, making it difficult to determine the relevance of each receptor type to these phenomena. However, in the brain, the CB1 receptors (CB1Rs) are expressed at high levels in neurons, whereas the expression of CB2Rs is marginal. Thus, CB1Rs mediate the effects of smoked cannabis and are also implicated in emotional behaviors. We have analyzed the production of supraspinal analgesia and the development of tolerance at CB1Rs by the direct injection of a series of cannabinoids into the brain. The influence of the activation of CB1Rs on supraspinal analgesia evoked by morphine was also evaluated.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Intracerebroventricular (icv) administration of cannabinoid receptor agonists, WIN55,212-2, ACEA or methanandamide, generated a dose-dependent analgesia. Notably, a single administration of these compounds brought about profound analgesic tolerance that lasted for more than 14 days. This decrease in the effect of cannabinoid receptor agonists was not mediated by depletion of CB1Rs or the loss of regulated G proteins, but, nevertheless, it was accompanied by reduced morphine analgesia. On the other hand, acute morphine administration produced tolerance that lasted only 3 days and did not affect the CB1R. We found that both neural mu-opioid receptors (MORs) and CB1Rs interact with the HINT1-RGSZ module, thereby regulating pertussis toxin-insensitive Gz proteins. In mice with reduced levels of these Gz proteins, the CB1R agonists produced no such desensitization or morphine cross-tolerance. On the other hand, experimental enhancement of Gz signaling enabled an acute icv administration of morphine to produce a long-lasting tolerance at MORs that persisted for more than 2 weeks, and it also impaired the analgesic effects of cannabinoids.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>In the brain, cannabinoids can produce analgesic tolerance that is not associated with the loss of surface CB1Rs or their uncoupling from regulated transduction. Neural specific Gz proteins are essential mediators of the analgesic effects of supraspinal CB1R agonists and morphine. These Gz proteins are also responsible for the long-term analgesic tolerance produced by single doses of these agonists, as well as for the cross-tolerance between CB1Rs and MORs.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>The cannabinoid receptors belong to the G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) superfamily and include at least two receptor types: CB1 and CB2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. The systemic administration of endocannabinoids, such as anandamide, the synthetic agonist [(R)-(+)-[2,3-dihydro-5-methyl-3-(4-morpholinylmethyl) pyrrolo [1,2,3-de]-1,4-benzoxazin-6-yl]-1-naphthalenylmethanone] (WIN55,212-2) or the naturally occurring compound &#x00394;<sup>9</sup>-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), produces analgesia in rodent pain models. Unfortunately, long-term administration of agonists leads to a progressive decrease in the cannabinoid-mediated effects, a process referred to as analgesic tolerance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>], which persists for as long as 14 days [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. The tolerance that follows repeated systemic administration of cannabinoids is caused by down-regulation and/or uncoupling of the receptors from the G proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Most cannabinoids induce rapid internalization of their receptors via clathrin-coated pits [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>], and long-term treatment leads to a significant down-regulation of CB1 receptors (CB1Rs). Indeed, an important fraction of the internalized receptors is transported to the lysosomal compartment for degradation, and the interaction between CB1Rs and G protein-associated sorting protein 1 (GASP1) plays an essential role in this process [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>].</p><p>In the brain, CB1R is expressed at high levels in neural cells, whereas CB2R exists only at low levels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Thus, CB1R appears to mediate the supraspinal effects of cannabinoid agonists. CB1R is found in the cerebral cortex, amygdala, hippocampus, basal ganglia, cerebellum, and brain areas involved in descending pain modulation, such as the periaqueductal gray matter (PAG), rostral ventromedial medulla (RVM), and the spinal cord [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. This distribution is consistent with the effects of cannabinoids on emotional responses, cognition, memory, movement, and nociception [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. At the molecular level, CB1R couples to pertussis toxin (PTX)-sensitive Gi/o proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>] and to certain pertussis toxin-insensitive G proteins, probably Gq/11 and Gz [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. This receptor regulates the expression of immediate early genes and various cellular effectors, such as adenylyl cyclase, ion channels, mitogen-activated protein kinase, and focal adhesion kinase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>].</p><p>Interestingly, cannabinoids may be useful in controlling pathological pain that is resistant to conventional opioid therapies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. Although cannabinoids act independently of opioids to produce analgesia in rodents, similar brainstem circuitry seems to be involved [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. Brain areas such as the caudate putamen, dorsal hippocampus, and substantia nigra are rich in both cannabinoid and opioid receptors, and the co-localization of both types of receptors has been described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. Loss of functional receptors leads to desensitization in both systems. Chronic treatment induces analgesic cross-tolerance between opioids and cannabinoids. This cross-tolerance, however, occurs without any change in the receptors of the other system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. This observation suggests that interactions can take place at the signal transduction/effector level. In nervous tissue, desensitization in response to single doses of opioids, such as morphine, occurs without the loss of surface receptors. However, in response to subsequent doses of morphine, the MOR becomes phosphorylated and undergoes internalization/recycling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. In contrast to what happens with the CB1R, few internalized MORs are destroyed in the lysosomal fraction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. Rather, most of the internalized MORs are re-inserted in the membrane, and tolerance to opioids that induce robust receptor internalization develops slowly [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>].</p><p>A series of recent studies have increased our knowledge of the molecular mechanisms implicated in neural MOR signaling and desensitization. In nervous tissue, the C-terminus of MOR interacts with a signaling module consisting of histidine triad nucleotide binding protein 1 (HINT1) that is associated with the Gz regulatory proteins RGS17 (RGSZ2) and RGS20 (RGSZ1). The RGSZ proteins are specific GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs) of receptor-activated G&#x003b1;z-GTP subunits. Thus, this HINT1-RGSZ signaling module is physically close to the MOR-regulated Gz proteins and helps to deactivate the agonist-activated G&#x003b1;z-GTP subunits [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. For opioids such as morphine, which induce little MOR internalization, neural-specific Gz proteins are essential to the desensitization of supraspinal antinociception.</p><p>Given the relevance of brain CB1Rs as analgesics, in the present study we sought to analyze supraspinal antinociception and its desensitization following icv administration of cannabinoid agonists. The results indicate that CB1Rs, like MORs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>], interact with the HINT1-RGSZ signaling module. Both receptors regulate Gz proteins to produce supraspinal analgesia, and this G protein is implicated in their desensitization and cross-desensitization.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Single-dose analgesic desensitization of brain CB1 receptors: time required to recover the initial response</title><p>The CB1R agonists methanandamide, ACEA, and WIN55,212-2 all produced dose-dependent antinociception in the tail-flick test when injected icv into mice (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>, upper panel); this antinociception was antagonized by the cannabinoid antagonist AM-251 (data not shown). These effects showed rapid onset, typically within 5 to 10 min post-injection, and then declined slowly. Doses of 50 nmol methanandamide, 40 nmol ACEA, or 20 nmol WIN55,212-2 produced comparable peak analgesic effects, which were approximately 70% of the maximum effect that can be observed in this test. Administration of an acute dose of these agonists caused a robust analgesic desensitization, and a second administration of either agonist 24 h after the priming dose produced almost no detectable analgesia (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>, middle panel). Because inhibiting PKC reverses single-dose analgesic tolerance to opioids such as morphine [see references in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]], we tested the effect of injecting 1 nmol of the PKC inhibitor G&#x000f6;7874 icv 30 min before the second dose of the agonists. Contrary to our expectations, this approach failed to rescue the analgesic effect of the cannabinoid agonists.</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Long-term supraspinal analgesic tolerance produced by agonists of brain CB1Rs</bold>. <italic>Upper panel</italic>: Mice were injected icv with methanandamide, ACEA or WIN55,212-2 at the doses indicated, and analgesia was evaluated at various intervals post-injection using the "tail-flick" test with a thermal stimulus of a 52&#x000b0;C water bath. <italic>Middle panel</italic>: A priming dose of methanandamide (50 nmol), ACEA (40 nmol), WIN55,212-2 (20 nmol), or saline was administered icv to mice (n = 10 per group). After 24 h, single-dose tolerance was examined by administering a test dose of each agonist (same dose as the priming dose) to mice that had received either saline (open bars) or the priming doses (grey bars). In another set of assays, mice that had received the priming doses of the corresponding agonists were injected icv 24 h later with the PKC kinase inhibitor G&#x000f6;7874 (1 nmol), and 30 min later with test doses of the cannabinoid agonists (dark grey bars) (n = 10 per group).

Mice received a desensitizing priming dose of the agonists, and were then divided into subgroups. Each subgroup received a second test dose of the agonist at different intervals after the priming dose. Notably, the CB1R desensitization caused by a single dose of the cannabinoid agonist lasted for several days and the recovery of the response took 2 or 3 weeks (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>, lower panel). This result differs from that observed in acute tolerance to morphine, which lasts only 3 or 4 days [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. In this way, our results indicate that the CB1R agonists studied produce dose-dependent supraspinal analgesia, which leads to significant and long-lasting desensitization of the receptor. We then analyzed a series of mechanisms that could be responsible for this CB1R tolerance.</p></sec><sec><title>Internalization of CB1Rs evoked in mouse brain by CB1R agonists</title><p>A plausible explanation for the observed long-lasting single-dose desensitization of CB1Rs is that the agonists reduced the functional CB1Rs at the neural membrane. Because most of the neuronal CB1Rs are associated with synaptic terminals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>], our study was performed on the membrane fraction enriched in synaptosomes. Then, in order to directly evaluate the presence of the CB1Rs in the synaptosomal membrane, we developed two antibodies that recognize extracellular domains on the CB1 receptor: one is directed against a peptide sequence in the N terminus (Nt) and the other against the first extracellular loop (1EL). These antibodies were affinity-purified using the corresponding antigenic peptide sequence, and their ability to label the target proteins in neural cells was assessed. With this aim, living cultured astrocytes were incubated, in the absence of detergents, with the anti-CB1R antibodies, Nt or 1EL, which had been covalently attached to the fluorescent label, Alexa-488. Under conditions of no detergent, Triton X-100 does not disrupt the lipid bilayer and the IgGs do not penetrate into the living cells. In this case, both antibodies labeled only surface CB1Rs (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>; Nt, A1 and A3; 1EL, A2). This labeling was not observed when the living astrocytes had been pre-treated with the cannabinoid agonist WIN55,212-2 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>). These observations indicate that both antibodies label extracellular epitopes of the CB1R and that WIN55,212-2 reduces its surface expression, probably by inducing receptor internalization.</p><fig position="float" id="F2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p><bold>WIN55,212-2 promotes internalization of CB1Rs in cultured astrocytes</bold>. <italic>Labeling of surface CB1Rs in living astrocytes</italic>: astrocytes were incubated with WIN55,212-2 for 1 h, then CB1R antibodies (1:500) labeled with Alexa-488 were added to the cultures for 30 min. The antibodies were washed out and the tissue was fixed. The CB1R was labeled by antibodies targeting the first external loop (1L) or the N-terminus (Nt). Anti-CB1R Nt was used in A1, B1, A3, and B3; anti-CB1R 1EL was used in A2 and B2.

Afterwards they were fixed and incubated with a solution containing 0.1% Triton X100. The CB1R antisera were added in this solution and incubated for 2 h. Anti-CB1R Nt was used in C1, D1, and E1; anti-CB1R 1EL was used in C2, D2, and E2. Details in Methods and Results.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1744-8069-5-11-2"/></fig><p>In order to detect the internalized CB1Rs, the living astrocytes were exposed to WIN55,212-2 and then incubated with a fixative solution that modifies extracellular sequences of surface proteins, such as the CB1Rs. However, if the integrity of the cell membrane is preserved, the fixative does not reach and alter the sequences of the cytosolic proteins. The anti-CB1R antibodies were then added in a medium containing 0.1% Triton X-100 to disorganize the lipid membrane. In doing so, the antibodies failed to bind the corresponding epitopes on the surface CB1Rs (compare Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2C</xref>), but reached the intact epitopes on the internalized CB1Rs (Nt, D1 and E1; 1EL, D2 and E2). Therefore, WIN55,212-2 at concentrations of 0.1 &#x003bc;M and 1 &#x003bc;M, promoted the internalization of the CB1Rs (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2D</xref>). These results indicate that the Nt and 1EL antibodies bind to CB1Rs. Moreover, both antibodies recognized the recombinant CB1R protein in immunoblotting assays (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="F3"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p><bold>Agonist-induced internalization of brain CB1Rs</bold>. A. The recombinant CB1 receptor (rCB1R) was labeled by both Nt and 1EL antibodies. The CB1R in solubilized PAG synaptosomal membranes was precipitated with 1EL or Nt antibodies and then immunodetected using the other antibody, yielding a ladder pattern. This banding of CB1Rs was also observed in the purified glycosylated fraction of PAG membranes, indicating the presence of multiple glycosylated species. B. Cannabinoid agonists used at doses that desensitize analgesia caused the internalization of surface CB1Rs (P2) into the cytosol (S3).

These substances act on the PAG to RVM connection, where certain neurons carrying these receptors in the RVM project down to the substantia gelatinosa in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord and reduce the intensity of the ascending nociceptive signals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>]. Therefore, to compare the analgesic effects with molecular events, we examined the discrete neural structure, the PAG. The neural CB1R has been described as heavily glycosylated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>]. Consequently, our anti-CB1R antibodies revealed a stepladder pattern, reflecting differently glycosylated populations. The covalently bound sugar branches prevent CB1R from adopting the globular shape that is expected for proteins subjected to sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). Thus, sugars reduce the mobility of this protein through the pores of the gel and produce the observed bands (ladder steps), depending on the kind of sugar or the extent of the glycosylation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>]. This stepladder pattern was also observed when the receptor was immunoprecipitated from the synaptosomal glycosylated protein fraction (obtained by WGL affinity chromatography) and analyzed using the other CB1R antibody (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>). In neurons, glycosylation of GPCRs is very common and produces similar patterns after SDS-PAGE (e.g., &#x003bc;- and &#x003b4;-opioid receptors) [[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>] and references therein].</p><p>For the sake of simplicity, we studied the agonist-induced internalization of brain CB1Rs by focusing on the 55- to 60-kDa band. In these assays, the cannabinoid agonists were used at acute doses that produced a long-lasting analgesic tolerance. Early after icv ACEA or WIN55,212-2 administration and during their analgesic time-courses, the level of cytosolic CB1Rs increased and the level of surface CB1Rs decreased. This trend gradually changed after an additional 48 h, such that the presence of this receptor in the cytosol and at the cell surface had returned to the levels observed in the absence of agonist (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3C</xref>). In contrast, methanandamide induced a low to moderate internalization of the CB1R (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref>). However, over several days, the mice remained refractory to the analgesic effects of additional doses of all these agonists.</p><p>A significant fraction of the internalized CB1Rs is shuttled into lysosomes, where the receptors are degraded. Therefore, the recovery of the surface CB1Rs observed after a single dose of WIN55,212-2 indicates that CB1R turnover takes about 28 h. In the absence of an exogenous agonist, some of the cytosolic CB1R staining is not associated with lysosomes and may indicate synthesis (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3C</xref>). In contrast, MOR, which has a turnover rate of 10 to 14 days, is barely detectable in the cytosol in the absence of agonist treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. After WIN55,212-2 challenge, CB1Rs were internalized and their levels in early endosomes and lysosomes increased. These findings indicate that the CB1R is being lysosomally degraded [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. Based on the antibody staining pattern, it appears that the transition between early endosomes and lysosomes depends on the level of CB1R glycosylation. The 55- to 60-kDa band remained in the fraction containing early and recycling endosomes longer than did the bands representing more slowly migrating proteins, which rapidly associated with lysosomes (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3C</xref>).

This has been observed for morphine, which promotes high analgesic tolerance with no loss of surface MORs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. In the brain, most cases of tolerance to morphine occur as a result of depletion of the MOR-regulated G proteins, which are transferred to RGS proteins belonging to the R7 and Rz subfamilies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>]. In the mouse brain, the CB1R is associated with different classes of G proteins. In the PAG, this receptor co-precipitates with PTX-sensitive Gi and Go as well as with PTX-insensitive Gq/11 and Gz (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A</xref>). WIN55,212-2 (20 nmol), which induces the internalization of PAG CB1Rs, also promoted some transfer of G&#x003b1;i and G&#x003b1;z subunits from CB1Rs toward RGSZ2 proteins. However, this association was only transitory, and when the CB1Rs gradually returned to the membrane, they reassociated with the G proteins (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B, C</xref>). This is not the case for morphine, however, which promotes a long-term transfer of Gi/z proteins toward RGSZ2 proteins and thus a persistent decrease in the signaling capacity of MORs. Interestingly, the opioid agonist [<sc>D</sc>-Ala<sup>2</sup>, <italic>N</italic>-Me-Phe<sup>4</sup>, Gly-ol<sup>5</sup>]-encephalin (DAMGO), which stimulates robust internalization of MORs, also promotes temporary association of G proteins with RGSZ2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. However, DAMGO produces low levels of analgesic tolerance, whereas WIN55,212-12, ACEA, and methanandamide induce a significant and long-lasting tolerance.

In our study, the analgesia produced by WIN55,212-2 and methanandamide was more resistant to the blocking effect of PTX than that of ACEA or THC (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5A</xref>). Consistent with this observation, knockdown of the PTX-sensitive G&#x003b1;i2 proteins produced little change in the activity of WIN55,212-2. Of the PTX-resistant G proteins, knockdown of G&#x003b1;z, but not G&#x003b1;q, significantly reduced the analgesic effects of WIN55,212-2 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5B</xref>). Besides, the supraspinal antinociception evoked by methanandamide decreased when expression of G&#x003b1;z was reduced. This reduction was only moderated for THC and ACEA (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5C</xref>). For all of the agonists studied, the desensitization that followed was not significantly altered by treating the mice with PTX (shown for WIN55,212-2, Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5A</xref>).

Nevertheless, the absence of RGS9 did not affect the activity of WIN55,212-2 or its capacity to produce CB1R desensitization.

This pattern is consistent with CB1R desensitization produced by the acute doses of icv cannabinoid agonists (see Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>, lower panel).

However, the connection between CB1R and MOR persisted when the expression of G&#x003b1;i2 was reduced (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>, middle panel). Thus, Gz plays a key role in impairing the activity of the CB1R agonist, WIN55,212-2, on morphine-promoted analgesia.

These results indicate that acute desensitization operates only in the direction from the CB1R toward the MOR. It may be that MORs as well as &#x003b1;2A receptors efficiently regulate Gz-mediated signaling, thereby promoting little desensitization of Gz target effectors. In fact, MOR tolerance produced by an acute dose of morphine lasted for only 3 or 4 days (e.g., Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5D</xref>), whereas that of CB1R agonists persisted for more than 14 days. Consistent with this idea, deregulation of receptor-activated G&#x003b1;z-GTP subunits through reduction in the expression of its GAP, the RGSZ2 protein, leads to profound desensitization of morphine analgesia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">54</xref>].

However, after knockdown of RGSZ2 proteins, the analgesic effects of both morphine and WIN55,212-2 were greatly reduced; thus, no interaction could be reliably studied. To circumvent this difficulty, we considered an alternative approach to deregulate the receptor-activated Gz proteins. The HINT1-RGSZ signaling module on the C-terminus of MORs helps control the MOR-induced activation of Gz proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. The absence of HINT1 dissociates RGSZ proteins from MORs and reduces the deactivation of the morphine-activated G&#x003b1;z-GTP subunits.

The analgesic tolerance that is observed after ip or sc administration of these substances usually requires repeated injections and affects both CB1 and CB2 receptors at spinal and supraspinal levels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B61">61</xref>]. This long-term cannabinoid administration produces CB1R desensitization and down-regulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Specifically, supraspinal CB1R expression diminishes, as does the ability of systemic cannabinoids to induce hypoactivity, hypothermia, and antinociception [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. Up to 2 weeks are required to recover the initial levels of CB1Rs in the synaptosomal membrane as well as the analgesic response to cannabinoids [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B62">62</xref>]. Therefore, the analgesic tolerance that follows the repeated systemic administration of cannabinoids can be explained in terms of the loss of surface CB receptors.</p><p>Brain CB1Rs, however, desensitize in response to acute doses of agonists; this cannot be explained merely in terms of a permanent loss of receptors. The effect of a single icv-injection of ACEA or WIN55,212-2 on surface CB1Rs is certainly brief. During the analgesic time-course of these agonists, the CB1Rs decreased in the PAG membrane by 60&#x02013;70%. Most of the internalized CB1Rs bind to GASP1 and are then degraded in the lysosomal compartment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. After the analgesic effects of single doses of the cannabinoids cease, the CB1Rs are gradually restored to the surface, probably by both the recycling of a portion of the internalized receptors and the insertion of newly synthesized receptors. As a result, 24 h or 48 h later, the presence of CB1Rs in the membrane is comparable to that seen before the agonist challenge. During this time, the restored CB1Rs become coupled to G proteins, but the analgesic response takes a significantly longer time to be restored: about 14 days. Most relevant, this tolerance is also promoted by cannabinoids such as methanandamide, which cause almost no loss of surface CB1Rs. Thus, it is likely that the analgesic desensitization promoted after several days of systemic treatment with cannabinoids primarily affects receptors at the spinal and peripheral levels, and the associated downregulation of the supraspinal CB1Rs, about 30&#x02013;50% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B62">62</xref>], may be secondary to these effects.</p><p>There is compelling evidence that the CB1R couples to and regulates both PTX-sensitive Gi/o proteins and PTX-insensitive Gq/11 and Gz proteins. Thus, the endocannabinoid, 2-arachidonoylglycerol, protects neurons by limiting cyclooxygenase-2 expression, an effect mediated by PTX-sensitive G proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. WIN55,212-2 shows a more complex pattern of receptor activation. Whereas this agonist affects acetylcholine release in the hippocampus through a PTX-sensitive mechanism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B63">63</xref>], in cultured hippocampal neurons it promotes increases in intracellular calcium via CB1Rs and the PTX-insensitive Gq protein. Interestingly, the latter effect is not reproduced by other cannabinoids, such as THC, CP55,940, 2-arachidonoylglycerol, or methanandamide [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. These results indicate that after binding the CB1R, cannabinoids may determine the class(es) of G proteins to be activated. Indeed, in a cell line derived from human trabecular meshwork, which is an ocular tissue, WIN55,212-2 was shown to increase intracellular calcium via CB1R and Gq/11 proteins and to increase ERK1/2 phosphorylation via PTX-sensitive Gi/o proteins. In this system, CP55,940 and methanandamide produced the same effects, but they acted via PTX-sensitive Gi/o proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. Therefore, the CB1R, like the MOR, couples to a series of PTX-sensitive and -insensitive G proteins, and the agonists determine the pattern of G protein activation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B56">56</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B58">58</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B64">64</xref>].</p><p>Brain CB1Rs mediate the production of analgesia via PTX-sensitive and PTX-insensitive G proteins [[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">53</xref>] and present study].

Intrathecal administration of PTX also abolishes the analgesia evoked by icv cannabinoids, indicating that the descending pathways triggered by these substances act at the spinal level through receptors coupled to Gi/o proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B65">65</xref>]. Signaling via the neural-specific PTX-insensitive Gz protein appears to occur more at the supraspinal level [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B55">55</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B66">66</xref>]. In fact, supraspinal analgesia mediated by MORs has an important Gz component [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B56">56</xref>]; at the spinal level, in contrast, PTX abolishes most MOR-mediated analgesia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B66">66</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B67">67</xref>]. Consistent with this observation, the levels of expression of specific regulators of activated G&#x003b1;z subunits, GAPs, RGSZ1, and RGSZ2, are lower in the spinal cord than in the midbrain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">54</xref>].</p><p>Activation of Gz proteins mediates long-lasting analgesic desensitization of supraspinal CB1Rs. Cannabinoid agonists, such as methanandamide, which apparently do not activate Gq/11 proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>], produced desensitization of CB1Rs via activation of Gz proteins. Therefore, it seems that agonists that trigger activation of Gi/o proteins via CB1Rs also activate the PTX-insensitive Gz protein. The unique biochemical and regulatory properties of G&#x003b1;z subunits account for their strong ability to desensitize GPCR signaling events. The Gz transducer protein, like Gi/o proteins, regulates adenylyl cyclase activity and the gating of certain K<sup>+ </sup>channels. G&#x003b1;z, however, is predominantly confined to neuronal cells. The rate of G&#x003b1;z-GTP hydrolysis is as much as 200-fold slower than that of G&#x003b1;s-GTP and G&#x003b1;i-GTP. Therefore, Gz may be resistant to inactivation after receptor activation unless external factors accelerate the rate of G&#x003b1;z-GTP hydrolysis, much the same way that the GAPs do for many Ras-like proteins. Therefore, inadequate control of G&#x003b1;z signaling may easily lead to over-regulation of target effectors and subsequent desensitization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>]. Thus, deactivation requires the assistance of specific GAPs to augment the rate of hydrolysis and thus release effector(s) from continuous regulation.</p><p>The RGS-Rz subfamily bears the primary responsibility for regulating Gz, and the C-terminus of the MOR associates with a signaling module consisting of HINT1-RGSZ, which helps deactivate MOR-activated G&#x003b1;z-GTP subunits [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. This study has shown that brain CB1Rs regulate Gz proteins and associate with the HINT1-RGSZ signaling module, which is involved in the zinc-mediated recruitment of PKC&#x003b3; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. Indeed, PKC has been implicated in the desensitization of CB1Rs by phosphorylation of a serine residue (S317) in the third internal loop [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B68">68</xref>]. We have observed the in vivo recruitment of PKC&#x003b3; toward the HINT1-RGSZ module at the C-terminus of CB1R during the intervals when the receptor is uncoupled from regulated transduction. However, the inhibition of this kinase did not prevent the development of acute tolerance, suggesting that other post-receptor mechanisms operate in this process. Most relevant, deregulation of this module brings about increased Gz signaling at the corresponding effector(s) and the development of profound analgesic desensitization of brain MORs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">54</xref>] and CB1Rs (present study). In contrast, depletion of Gz proteins reduces the analgesic desensitization produced by icv injection of various doses of morphine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>] and also abolishes acute desensitization of brain CB1Rs and cross-tolerance with morphine. A single icv injection of morphine produces desensitization that lasts for approximately 3 days; however, the cannabinoid agonists studied here desensitized CB1Rs for more than 14 days. Because both of these effects were mediated by the activation of Gz proteins, this observation indicates that CB1R-activated Gz proteins are controlled less efficiently than those activated by the MOR. In agreement with this idea, disruption of the HINT1-RGSZ module led acutely administered morphine to promote a profound and long-lasting desensitization of brain MORs, and most relevant, impaired the analgesic activity of CB1R agonists. Therefore, disruption of Gz regulation brings about a bidirectional supraspinal cross-tolerance between acute doses of morphine and cannabinoids, similar to that attained through chronic and systemic administration of the respective MOR or CB1R agonists [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>].</p><p>Morphine poorly internalizes MORs and promotes strong analgesic desensitization by stimulating permanent transfer of a part of the receptor-regulated G proteins toward RGS proteins belonging to the R7 and Rz subfamilies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>]. In contrast, DAMGO produces a robust internalization and recycling of MORs, a transient transfer of G proteins toward the RGS proteins, and a low level of analgesic tolerance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. Because icv-injected cannabinoids facilitated a reversible transfer of G&#x003b1; subunits toward RGSZ2 proteins and because the membrane levels of CB1Rs were almost restored within 24 h of their initial challenge, one should expect the resensitization of the analgesic response to these substances, as with DAMGO. However, our results reveal a long-term supraspinal analgesic tolerance even after the CB1R reassociates with these G proteins. This apparent divergence between DAMGO and cannabinoids in the production of tolerance can be explained in terms of the classes of G proteins activated by these agonists after binding to their respective supraspinal receptors. Thus, the analgesic effects of WIN55,212-2 are mediated mostly by Gz proteins, whereas those of DAMGO require Gi/o proteins and, to a lesser extent, Gz [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B56">56</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B58">58</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B64">64</xref>]. In the absence of Gz activation, the cannabinoids behave as DAMGO, promoting low levels of analgesic tolerance. Therefore, the desensitizing capacity of Gz proteins on post-receptor events predominates over the resensitization caused by reinsertion and G protein-coupling of the internalized CB1Rs in the neural membrane. Thus, it is the coincidence of WIN55,212-2 and morphine at Gz proteins that accounts for their cross-desensitization, whereas the poor regulation of this Gz by DAMGO explains why WIN55,212-2 fails to impair DAMGO-evoked analgesia.</p><p>Thus, an inefficient G&#x003b1;z-GTP deactivation results in desensitization of brain MORs and CB1Rs, suggesting a post-receptor mechanism that appears to be regulated by Gz proteins. However, at the spinal level CB1Rs primarily regulate Gi/o proteins, and in the absence of Gz proteins, tolerance is primarily achieved by reducing the density of active surface receptors. Indeed, this is seen after repeated systemic treatment with cannabinoids (see Introduction).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>At the supraspinal level, CB1Rs are enriched in neurons, whereas CB2Rs are expressed at very low levels. Brain CB1Rs interact with the HINT1-RGSZ signaling module and produce analgesia by regulating PTX-sensitive Gi/o proteins and PTX-insensitive Gz proteins. A single icv injection of WIN55,212-2, methanandamide, or ACEA brings about a long-lasting tolerance that is not mediated by the persistent loss of functional CB1Rs, but rather, seems to involve the action of CB1R-activated G&#x003b1;z subunits on certain effector(s). Such effectors appear to be common to CB1Rs and MORs, given their joint regulation of Gz proteins and the fact that Gz deregulation results in analgesic desensitization to cannabinoids and morphine. Together with the findings of other groups, our results suggest that both CB1Rs and MORs co-exist in certain neurons within the brain, where they regulate Gz proteins and similar effectors.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Drugs and production of antibodies</title><p>Arachidonyl-2&#x000a1;-chloroethylamide (ACEA, Tocris #1319), WIN55,212-2 mesylate (Tocris #1038), N-(piperidin-1-yl)-5-(4-iodophenyl)-1-(2,4-dichlorophenyl)-4-methyl-1H-pyrazole-3-carboxamide (AM251, Tocris #1117), and &#x00394;<sup>9</sup>-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC, Pharm, Frankfurt, Germany) were dissolved in 1:1:18 (v/v/v) mixture of ethanol: cremophor EL (Sigma Chemical Co., Madrid): physiologic saline.
