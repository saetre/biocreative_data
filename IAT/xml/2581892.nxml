Disruption of this negative feedback might lead to neurological pathologies, such as epilepsy, but the precise mechanisms by which this feedback can occur remain incompletely understood. At one glutamatergic synapse, the Drosophila neuromuscular junction, a mutation in the group II metabotropic glutamate receptor gene (<italic>DmGluRA</italic>) increased motor neuron excitability by disrupting an autocrine, glutamate-mediated negative feedback. We show that <italic>DmGluRA</italic> mutations increase neuronal excitability by preventing PI3 kinase (PI3K) activation and consequently hyperactivating the transcription factor Foxo. Furthermore, glutamate application increases levels of phospho-Akt, a product of PI3K signaling, within motor nerve terminals in a <italic>DmGluRA</italic>-dependent manner. Finally, we show that PI3K increases both axon diameter and synapse number via the Tor/S6 kinase pathway, but not Foxo. In humans, PI3K and group II mGluRs are implicated in epilepsy, neurofibromatosis, autism, schizophrenia, and other neurological disorders; however, neither the link between group II mGluRs and PI3K, nor the role of PI3K-dependent regulation of Foxo in the control of neuronal excitability, had been previously reported. Our work suggests that some of the deficits in these neurological disorders might result from disruption of glutamate-mediated homeostasis of neuronal excitability.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><p>Use-dependent downregulation of neuronal excitability (negative feedback) can act to maintain neuronal activity within specified levels. Disruption of this homeostasis can lead to neurological disorders, such as epilepsy. Here, we report a novel mechanism for negative feedback control of excitability in the Drosophila larval motor neuron. In this mechanism, activation by the excitatory neurotransmitter glutamate of metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs) located at motor nerve terminals decreases excitability by activating PI3 kinase (PI3K), consequently causing the phosphorylation and inhibition of the transcription factor Foxo. Foxo inhibition, in turn, decreases neuronal excitability. These observations are of interest for two reasons. First, our observation that PI3K activity regulates neuronal excitability is of interest because altered PI3K activity is implicated in a number of neurological disorders, such as autism and neurofibromatosis. Our results raise the possibility that altered excitability might contribute to the deficits in these disorders. Second, our observation that group II metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs) activate PI3K is of interest because group II mGluRs are implicated in epilepsy, anxiety disorders, and schizophrenia. Yet the downstream signaling pathways affected by these treatments are incompletely understood. Our results raise the possibility that the PI3K pathway might be an essential mediator of signalling by these mGluRs.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="12"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Negative feedback processes, which can enable maintenance of neuronal homeostasis, are widely observed in neuronal systems <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000277-Davis1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000277-Pozzi1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>.

However, the signaling pathways responsible for these excitability changes remain unclear.</p><p>The mammalian group II metabotropic glutamate receptors, which are G-protein coupled receptors activated by glutamate, are well positioned to mediate negative feedback. When localized presynaptically, these receptors can act as autoinhibitors of glutamate release <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000277-Chen1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000277-Scanziani1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>. Because these receptors are located outside of the active zone <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000277-Schoepp1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>, activation is thought to occur only during conditions of elevated glutamate release and might serve to prevent glutamate-mediated neurotoxicity. Agonists for these receptors are proposed for treatment of schizophrenia, anxiety and epilepsy, among others <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000277-Patil1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000277-Swanson1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>, but the mGluR-dependent signaling pathways that underlie these disorders remain unidentified. Furthermore, although many of the acute effects of group II mGluR activation on neuronal physiology have been elucidated <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000277-Alexander1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000277-Anwyl1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>, possible long term effects on neuronal function, such as through changes in ion channel gene expression, remain essentially unexplored.</p><p>In Drosophila, the single <italic>DmGluRA</italic> gene encodes a protein most similar to the mammalian group II mGluR <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000277-Bogdanik1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>. DmGluRA is located presynaptically at the neuromuscular junction (nmj), which suggests that DmGluRA might regulate transmitter release from motor neurons. Elimination of <italic>DmGluRA</italic> by the null mutation <italic>DmGluRA<sup>112b</sup></italic>, or by RNAi-mediated <italic>DmGluRA</italic> knockdown specifically in motor neurons, increases neuronal excitability <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000277-Bogdanik1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>. Given that glutamate is the excitatory neurotransmitter from Drosophila motor neurons, the increased excitability of <italic>DmGluRA</italic> mutants raised the possibility that DmGluRA decreases motor neuron excitability upon activation by glutamate released from motor nerve terminals. In this view, DmGluRA would mediate an activity-dependent negative feedback on excitability. However, the mechanism by which this negative feedback is accomplished was not elucidated.</p><p>Here we show that glutamate-mediated activation of DmGluRA decreases neuronal excitability by activating the lipid kinase PI3 kinase (PI3K), which promotes growth and inhibits apoptosis in various cell types. In particular, we report that transgene-induced inhibition of PI3K in motor neurons confers neuronal excitability phenotypes similar to <italic>DmGluRA<sup>112b</sup></italic>, whereas transgene-induced activation of PI3K confers the opposite excitability phenotypes. We also show that PI3K activation in motor neurons suppresses the increased excitability of <italic>DmGluRA<sup>112b</sup></italic>, and glutamate application to motor nerve terminals activates PI3K in a DmGluRA-dependent manner. Finally, we show that altered PI3K activity regulates both axon diameter and synapse number, and that these effects on neuronal growth are mediated by the Tor/S6 kinase pathway, whereas the effects of PI3K on neuronal excitability are mediated by the transcription factor Foxo. We conclude that negative feedback of Drosophila motor neuron excitability occurs via the glutamate-induced activation of DmGluRA autoreceptors, causing the PI3K-dependent inhibition of Foxo and a consequent decrease in neuronal excitability. A similar negative feedback operating in the mammalian CNS might underlie neuronal disorders involving the group II mGluRs or PI3K.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Drosophila mGluRA (DmGluRA) Affects the Rate of Onset of Long-Term Facilitation (LTF), a Reporter for Motor Neuron Excitability</title><p>The increase in neuronal excitability conferred by the <italic>DmGluRA<sup>112b</sup></italic> null mutation is manifested by an increased rate of onset of a form of synaptic plasticity termed long-term facilitation (LTF) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000277-Bogdanik1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000277-Jan1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>, which is induced when a motor neuron is subjected to repetitive nerve stimulation at low bath &#x0005b;Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>&#x0005d;.

By increasing motor neuron excitability, the genotypes described above apparently bring excitability closer to the threshold required to evoke LTF and consequently decrease the number of prior nerve stimulations required to reach this threshold. In these genotypes, the prolonged nerve terminal depolarizations that triggered LTF were revealed by recording ejps and simultaneously recording extracellularly electrical activity within the peripheral nerves during LTF onset. It was found that LTF onset was accompanied by the appearance within peripheral nerves of supernumerary action potentials occurring at about 10 msec intervals following the initial induced action potential <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000277-Stern1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000277-Ganetzky1">&#x0005b;25&#x0005d;</xref>. Several lines of evidence suggested that these supernumerary action potentials arose in motor axons and were responsible for the increased transmitter release underlying LTF. First, the number of these supernumerary action potentials correlated with ejp duration, and second, these supernumerary action potentials often preceded depolarizing steps in the asynchronous, multi-step ejps that occurred after LTF onset. Similar supernumerary action potentials were observed following nerve stimulation in the <italic>eag Sh</italic> double mutant, in which two distinct K channel &#x003b1; subunits are simultaneously eliminated, and which consequently exhibits extreme neuronal hyperexcitability. In the <italic>eag Sh</italic> double mutant, these supernumerary action potentials arise in the motor nerve terminals and exhibit retrograde propagation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000277-Ganetzky1">&#x0005b;25&#x0005d;</xref>. It was suggested that the supernumerary action potentials were caused by, and also prolonged, motor nerve terminal depolarization, and thus participated in a positive feedback loop prolonging depolarization <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000277-Ganetzky1">&#x0005b;25&#x0005d;</xref>. This positive feedback loop presumably underlies the abrupt, threshold-like onset of LTF.</p><p>The observation that <italic>mGluR<sup>112b</sup></italic> increases the rate of onset of LTF suggested that <italic>DmGluRA<sup>112b</sup></italic> increases motor neuron excitability as well <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000277-Bogdanik1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>. To confirm this suggestion, we simultaneously recorded peripheral nerve electrical activity and ejps during LTF induced by 10 Hz stimulus trains. As previously observed in the hyperexcitable genotypes described above <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000277-Stern1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000277-Ganetzky1">&#x0005b;25&#x0005d;</xref>, we found that the abrupt onset of LTF in <italic>mGluRA<sup>112b</sup></italic> was accompanied in the nerve by the appearance of supernumerary action potentials (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000277.s001">Figure S1</xref>). This observation confirmed that LTF onset in <italic>mGluRA<sup>112b</sup></italic> was caused by prolonged motor nerve terminal depolarization, and hence that <italic>mGluRA<sup>112b</sup></italic> increases neuronal excitability. Thus, as suggested previously <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000277-Bogdanik1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>, it appears that DmGluRA mediates an activity-dependent inhibition of neuronal excitability. In this view, glutamate release from motor nerve terminals downregulates subsequent neuronal activity by activating presynaptic DmGluRA autoreceptors, which then decrease excitability.

Quinidine application sensitizes the motor neuron to the effects of the nerve stimulation and enables LTF to occur reliably in genotypes with low excitability, even at lower stimulus frequencies. To demonstrate that altered PI3K activity does not alter rate of onset of LTF by altering sensitivity to quinidine, we compared the timing of LTF onset in the absence of quinidine in wildtype larvae and in larvae with inhibited PI3K. We found that inhibiting PI3K activity in motor neurons significantly accelerated LTF onset even in the absence of quinidine (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000277.s002">Figure S2</xref>) demonstrating that altered sensitivity of motor neurons to quinidine does not underlie the altered onset rate of LTF that we observe.</p><p>In addition to effects on LTF, mutations that alter motor neuron excitability can alter basal transmitter release and hence ejp amplitude at low bath Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> concentrations, at which Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> influx would be limiting for vesicle fusion to occur. For example, mutations in <italic>ether-a go-go (eag)</italic>, which encodes a potassium channel &#x003b1; subunit, increase transmitter release about two-fold <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000277-Ganetzky1">&#x0005b;25&#x0005d;</xref>, whereas a mutation in the sodium channel gene <italic>paralytic</italic> decreases transmitter release by increasing the frequency at which nerve stimulation failed to evoke any vesicle fusion, termed &#x0201c;failure&#x0201d; of vesicle release <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000277-Huang1">&#x0005b;30&#x0005d;</xref>.

Z-stacks were compiled from 2 &#x000b5;m serial sections to a depth adequate to encompass the entire bouton thickness for each sample (from 8&#x02013;20 &#x000b5;m). Muscles 7 and 6 from either abdominal segments A3 or A4 were used for measurements. ImageJ software was used to analyze p-Akt intensities. In particular, 2D projections were created using the median pixel intensity from each stack at each coordinate point. Neuronal structures, marked by anti-HRP, were traced using the freehand selection tool and the selection was transferred to the anti-p-Akt image where the mean pixel intensity value was measured. Background was obtained with a selection box encompassing the non-neuronal area of muscles 6 and 7 in the particular abdominal segment, the mean pixel intensity was measured and subtracted from the mean p-Akt pixel intensity.</p></sec><sec id="s4c"><title>Electrophysiology</title><p>The <italic>D42</italic> motor neuron driver was used to express transgenes for all experiments, except that the <italic>OK6</italic> driver was used for experiments the <italic>Foxo<sup>21</sup>/Foxo<sup>25</sup></italic> genotype was included. <italic>OK6</italic> is located on a different chromosome from <italic>Foxo</italic>, which simplifies stock construction. Larvae were grown to the wandering third-instar stage in uncrowded bottles at room temperature and dissected as described (17, 18) in standard saline solution (128 mM NaCl, 2.0 mM KCl, 4.0 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 34 mM sucrose, 5.0 mM HEPES, pH 7.1, and CaCl<sub>2</sub> as specified in the text). Peripheral nerves were cut posterior to the ventral ganglion and were stimulated using a suction electrode. Muscle recordings were taken from muscle 6 in abdominal sections 3&#x02013;5. Stimulation intensity (5 V for approximately 0.05 msec) was adjusted to 1.5 times threshold, which reproducibly stimulates both axons innervating muscle cell 6. Recording electrodes were pulled using a Flaming/Brown micropipette puller to a tip resistance of 10&#x02013;40 M&#x003a9; and filled with 3M KCl. LTF and ejp amplitude data are reported as geometric, rather than arithmetic means, because the data show a positive skew. For extracellular recordings of neuronal action potentials, a loop of nerve near the nerve terminal was introduced into a suction electrode and nerve activity recorded with a DAM-80 differential amplifier.</p></sec><sec id="s4d"><title>Electron Microscopy</title><p>Larvae were grown to the wandering third-instar stage in uncrowded bottles at room temperature.
