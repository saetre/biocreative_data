Many challenges exist for the replication machinery to perform its task. One problem arises when the growing replication fork is halted. Replication fork arrest occurs when the replication complex encounters a site of DNA damage, some secondary DNA structures or nucleotide depletion, as in the case of treatment with hydroxy urea (HU) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf581c1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf581c2">2</xref>). Stalled replication forks have been shown to create sites for recombination, as demonstrated in both bacterial and eukaryotic systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf581c2">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf581c5">5</xref>). The loss of the <italic>recQ</italic> homolog in various systems leads to hyper-recombination when the cells undergo replication arrest induced by HU or ultraviolet (UV) DNA damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf581c6">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf581c13">13</xref>). These data suggest that the RecQ helicases act to suppress recombination at arrested replication forks, although the RecQ helicases have also been shown to promote certain types of recombination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf581c10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf581c14">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf581c16">16</xref>). Different models have been proposed to explain how RecQ helicases might suppress recombination. In <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>, arrested replication forks are believed to be stabilized by RecQ through the formation of a triple helix (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf581c10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf581c17">17</xref>). Studies on the human and <italic>Schizo saccharomyces pombe</italic> RecQ helicases (Blm and Rqh1, respectively) suggest that they act to remove Holliday junctions formed at stalled replication forks, by reverse branch migration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf581c18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf581c19">19</xref>). In one of these studies, expression of the bacterial Holliday junction resolvase was shown to significantly suppress UV and HU sensitivity in <italic>S.pombe</italic> &#x00394;<italic>rqh1</italic> cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf581c18">18</xref>). These results suggest that cells lacking Rqh1 accumulate Holliday junctions at stalled replication forks.</p><p>Recent findings in <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> demonstrating a synthetic interaction between <italic>srs2</italic> and the <italic>recQ</italic> homolog <italic>sgs1</italic> suggest the possibility that Srs2 might also function at stalled replication forks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf581c14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf581c20">20</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf581c22">22</xref>). The <italic>S.cerevisiae</italic> Srs2 DNA helicase, which is structurally related to the bacterial helicase II (<italic>UvrD</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf581c23">23</xref>), was first discovered in a screen for suppressors of trimethoprim sensitivity of <italic>rad6</italic> and <italic>rad18</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf581c24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf581c25">25</xref>). It was independently characterized as a suppressor of homologous recombination (named <italic>HPR5</italic>), as mutants showed a hyper-recombination phenotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf581c24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf581c26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf581c27">27</xref>). <italic>SRS2</italic> has since been shown to be associated with the <italic>RAD6</italic> post replication repair (PRR) pathway. Specifically, Srs2 functions with the <italic>RAD5</italic>-dependent error-free branch of PRR, where it has been shown to suppress the UV sensitivities of <italic>rad5</italic>, <italic>ubc13</italic> and <italic>mms2</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf581c28">28</xref>). This suppression is lost in cells lacking a functional recombination system, consistent with a role of Srs2 blocking damage from being chanelled into the <italic>RAD52</italic>-dependent homologous recombination pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf581c28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf581c29">29</xref>). The synthetic interaction between <italic>srs2</italic> and <italic>sgs1</italic> was shown to be suppressed by mutations in the homologous recombination genes <italic>rad51</italic>, <italic>rad55</italic> and <italic>rad57</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf581c14">14</xref>). It has also been demonstrated that <italic>S.cerevisiae</italic><italic>srs2</italic> shows either a lethal phenotype or poor growth when combined with a number of other mutants (<italic>rdh54</italic>, <italic>rad50</italic>, <italic>mre11</italic>, <italic>xrs2</italic>, <italic>top3</italic> and <italic>rad54</italic>&#x00029; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf581c21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf581c30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf581c31">31</xref>). The synthetic interactions of these double mutants are furthermore suppressed by mutating the recombination genes <italic>rad51</italic>, <italic>rad52</italic>, <italic>rad55</italic> and <italic>rad57</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf581c14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf581c30">30</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf581c32">32</xref>). In addition, it was shown that <italic>srs2 rad54</italic> and <italic>srs2 rdh54</italic> lethality can be suppressed by loss of checkpoint function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf581c31">31</xref>). These data are complemented by evidence of genetic interaction between <italic>SRS2</italic> and <italic>RAD52</italic>, based on suppression of <italic>rad52</italic> mutations by deletion of <italic>SRS2</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf581c33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf581c34">34</xref>). <italic>srs2</italic> mutants have also been shown to suppress hyporecombination of some <italic>rad51</italic> and <italic>rad52</italic> alleles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf581c24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf581c32">32</xref>). Together, these results demonstrate that Srs2 function in <italic>S.cerevisiae</italic> is linked to homologous recombination.</p><p>Both Srs2 and the RecQ helicases are associated with DNA damage response and&#x0002f;or genomic instability. In <italic>S.cerevisiae</italic>, Sgs1 and Srs2 have been shown to participate in activation of the intra-S checkpoint following exposure to MMS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf581c35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf581c36">36</xref>). In <italic>S.pombe</italic>, <italic>rqh1</italic> mutants show sensitivity to UV and gamma radiation and treatment with HU (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf581c7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf581c8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf581c37">37</xref>). <italic>rqh1</italic><sup>&#x0002b;</sup> was originally identified as <italic>rad12</italic><sup>&#x0002b;</sup> in a screen for UV sensitive mutants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf581c38">38</xref>). One phenotype associated with <italic>rqh1</italic> mutants is that although cells undergo a normal G<sub>1</sub>&#x02013;S arrest following DNA damage, they recover poorly. Fluorescence microscopy has revealed that the problem is in mitosis as cells divide with torn chromosomes and uneven distribution of nuclear material (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf581c7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf581c8">8</xref>). It has been proposed in <italic>S.cerevisiae</italic> that Srs2 acts in recombination repair of double strand breaks to stabilize the invading single strand with its homolog, thereby acting against reverse branch migration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf581c39">39</xref>). Srs2 is phosphorylated in response to intra-S DNA damage, and this phosphorylation is dependent on both checkpoint activation and Cdk1 (cyclin-dependent kinase) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf581c36">36</xref>). Following DNA damage in S-phase, <italic>srs2</italic> mutants do not fully arrest and Rad53 phosphorylation is reduced, suggesting Srs2 functions in an intra-S checkpoint. In addition, <italic>srs2</italic> mutants suppress the lethality of a <italic>rad17</italic> checkpoint mutant following intra-S DNA damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf581c36">36</xref>).</p><p>Our interest in <italic>rqh1</italic><sup>&#x0002b;</sup> has led us to study other genes related to its activity such as <italic>top3</italic><sup>&#x0002b;</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf581c40">40</xref>). In this context we have sought to identify other potentially interacting proteins. Therefore, we identified a homolog of <italic>SRS2</italic> by searching the <italic>S.pombe</italic> genomic database and created a null mutant, &#x00394;<italic>srs2</italic>. As reported previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf581c41">41</xref>), we found that Srs2 is not essential in <italic>S.pombe</italic> and that the single mutant does not exhibit significant sensitivity to either UV damage or treatment with HU. Furthermore, the &#x00394;<italic>srs2</italic> &#x00394;<italic>rqh1</italic> double mutant shows a severe slow growth defect compared with the single mutants. Our studies found that the &#x00394;<italic>srs2</italic> &#x00394;<italic>rqh1</italic> double mutant progresses through S-phase with a slight delay but arrests in G<sub>2</sub>&#x0002f;M with many of these cells ultimately undergoing an aberrant mitosis. The G<sub>2</sub>&#x0002f;M arrest is likely due to a checkpoint dependent DNA damage response, as deletion of the <italic>rad9</italic><sup>&#x0002b;</sup> checkpoint gene suppresses the accumulation of &#x00394;<italic>srs2</italic> &#x00394;<italic>rqh1</italic> cells in G<sub>2</sub>&#x0002f;M. This arrest appears to be related to recombination, as deletion of recombination genes also suppresses the slow growth of &#x00394;<italic>srs2</italic> &#x00394;<italic>rqh1</italic> and improves their viability. This result is in contrast to a recently published paper where it was reported that loss of recombination actually worsened the slow growth of &#x00394;<italic>srs2</italic> &#x00394;<italic>rqh1</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf581c41">41</xref>). We will point out why we believe we find these differences. Interestingly, we found that when replication fork stalling is increased by treatment with UV or HU, &#x00394;<italic>srs2</italic> &#x00394;<italic>rqh1</italic> cells show improved survival compared with that of a &#x00394;<italic>rqh1</italic> single mutant. These data imply that the synthetic phenotype of &#x00394;<italic>srs2</italic> &#x00394;<italic>rqh1</italic> is not a direct result of the double mutant inability to cope with stalled replication. Lastly, in studying the effect of loss of recombination on &#x00394;<italic>srs2</italic> &#x00394;<italic>rqh1</italic> we found that &#x00394;<italic>srs2</italic> is synthetically lethal with &#x00394;<italic>rhp54</italic>, and this lethality is suppressed in a &#x00394;<italic>rhp51</italic> mutant background.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Yeast strains, molecular techniques and media</title><p>The strains with their genotypes used in this study are listed in Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="gkf581tb1">1</xref>.

Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf581f2">2</xref>C shows that the double mutant has a phenotype characteristic of fission yeast strains having a growth defect; a mixed population of normal and abnormal appearing cells. The abnormal cells are typically long, often with aberrant cellular morphologies and distorted or fragmented nuclei. The double mutant also shows a very poor plating efficiency (16.7&#x00025;; see Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="gkf581tb3">3</xref>). We have previously shown that &#x00394;<italic>rqh1</italic> cells not only grow some 30&#x00025; slower than wild-type cells but the population also contains a number of elongated and abnormally shaped cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf581c40">40</xref>). The fact that the &#x00394;<italic>srs2</italic> single mutant has normal growth characteristics and nearly normal resistance to both UV and HU further suggests that Srs2 alone plays a relatively minor role in cell viability.</p></sec><sec><title>&#x00394;<italic>srs2</italic> &#x00394;<italic>rqh1</italic> arrests in G<sub>2</sub>&#x0002f;M and show a mitotic defect</title><p>We initially suspected that the slow growth seen in &#x00394;<italic>srs2</italic> &#x00394;<italic>rqh1</italic> cells might be due to a delay in S-phase based on the proposed role of both of these proteins functioning during DNA replication. To investigate this, we carried out FACS analysis on synchronized cells. Overnight cultures of wild type, &#x00394;<italic>srs2</italic>, &#x00394;<italic>rqh1</italic> and &#x00394;<italic>srs2</italic> &#x00394;<italic>rqh1</italic> were synchronized in G<sub>1</sub> by growth in media lacking nitrogen. Cells were released from the block and samples collected for analysis at time intervals over several hours. In our initial studies, FACS profiles of the &#x00394;<italic>srs2</italic> &#x00394;<italic>rqh1</italic> strain were difficult to interpret, presumably due to the abundance of abnormally large cells present in the population (data not shown). In subsequent experiments, following nitrogen starvation, large cells were eliminated by size selection using 7&#x02013;30&#x00025; lactose gradients. These size-selected cells were released from the block by switching to YEA media. FACS analysis of these cells gave much improved results. The results in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf581f3">3</xref> show that &#x00394;<italic>srs2</italic> &#x00394;<italic>rqh1</italic> cells do exhibit a slightly elongated S-phase. The &#x00394;<italic>srs2</italic> &#x00394;<italic>rqh1</italic> cells exit the G<sub>1</sub> block and progress through S-phase somewhat slower than wild-type cells or cells containing either single mutation. This is seen in &#x00394;<italic>srs2</italic> &#x00394;<italic>rqh1</italic> as a greater number of cells in S-phase between 1 and 2 h after release from G<sub>1</sub>. This slight delay in S-phase would not seem to account for all of the slow growth seen in the double mutant.</p><p>Since &#x00394;<italic>srs2</italic> &#x00394;<italic>rqh1</italic> cells did not show a significant S-phase delay, we went on to determine if there was a more substantial delay in another part of the cell cycle. To address this, we used cells from the same synchronization experiments described above. Cells, fixed at various times after G<sub>1</sub> release, were stained with DAPI and examined microscopically. At each time point, random fields of cells were scored as being either small&#x0002f;normal, elongated, having two nuclei or having torn or abnormal nuclei. On average about 250 cells were counted for each time point. Elongated cells were cells judged to be longer than a typical dividing cell. Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf581f4">4</xref> summarizes the results of wild-type and &#x00394;<italic>srs2</italic> &#x00394;<italic>rqh1</italic> cells. Pictures of DAPI stained cells representative of each classification of cells is shown at the top of each column. The percentage of each cell type seen at each time point are listed below each picture. At 0 h, essentially all wild-type and mutant cells were small, consistent with a good G<sub>1</sub> arrest. By 2 h we still saw mainly small or normal sized cells in both strains. By 3.5 h post release we began to see cells from both wild-type and &#x00394;<italic>srs2</italic> &#x00394;<italic>rqh1</italic> that contained two nuclei, consistent with cells having completed mitosis. At 4 h, 28&#x00025; of wild-type cells and 13&#x00025; of &#x00394;<italic>srs2</italic> &#x00394;<italic>rqh1</italic> cells were found to contain two nuclei. These results demonstrate that a sub-population of &#x00394;<italic>srs2</italic> &#x00394;<italic>rqh1</italic> cells cycle normally. At 4 h many &#x00394;<italic>srs2</italic> &#x00394;<italic>rqh1</italic> were not cycling normally, as indicated by the presence of elongated cells with single nuclei (12&#x00025; of &#x00394;<italic>srs2</italic> &#x00394;<italic>rqh1</italic> compared with 3&#x00025; of wild-type cells). This phenotype is indicative of cells delayed in G<sub>2</sub>&#x0002f;M, suggesting a checkpoint-dependent arrest. These elongated cells appear to accumulate, as their numbers increased to 25&#x00025; by 5.5 h after release. Only a few percent of elongated cells were ever seen in wild-type cells.</p><p>In addition to the elongated cells, at the later time points (5&#x02013;6 h), there was also an accumulation of cells with torn and abnormally shaped nuclei, indicative of cells that have undergone mitotic catastrophe. This morphology is reminiscent of the phenotype seen in &#x00394;<italic>rqh1</italic> cells following DNA damage or HU arrest. We also examined synchronized &#x00394;<italic>srs2</italic> and &#x00394;<italic>rqh1</italic> single mutants through this same block and release time course. The &#x00394;<italic>srs2</italic> cells were indistinguishable from wild-type cells, while a very small number (&#x0003c;5&#x00025;) of &#x00394;<italic>rqh1</italic> cells did elongate with a single nucleus or had torn chromosomes (&#x0003c;2&#x00025;, data not shown). From these results we conclude that the events that lead to cell growth arrest in &#x00394;<italic>srs2</italic> &#x00394;<italic>rqh1</italic> are stochastic, as some cells fail to progress through the cell cycle while others proceed at what appears to be a normal rate of growth. Also, when cells do arrest it appears to be at G<sub>2</sub>&#x0002f;M although our FACS data do not rule out the possibility that the arrest is in very late S-phase.</p></sec><sec><title>Loss of Srs2 and Rqh1 leads to induction of a checkpoint response</title><p>One explanation for the G<sub>2</sub>&#x0002f;M arrest of &#x00394;<italic>srs2</italic> &#x00394;<italic>rqh1</italic> cells is that their DNA is altered or damaged in such a way that a checkpoint response is elicited. To test this, we created a triple mutant strain in which the <italic>rad9</italic><sup>&#x0002b;</sup> checkpoint gene was deleted in a &#x00394;<italic>srs2</italic> &#x00394;<italic>rqh1</italic> background. Figure A shows that loss of the <italic>rad9</italic><sup>&#x0002b;</sup> gene suppresses the slow growth of the &#x00394;<italic>srs2</italic> &#x00394;<italic>rqh1</italic> mutation. Furthermore, when these cells (&#x00394;<italic>srs2</italic> &#x00394;<italic>rqh1</italic> &#x00394;<italic>rad9</italic>) were stained with DAPI and visualized by fluorescence microscopy, fewer elongated cells were detected (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf581f5">5</xref>B). This result suggests that by deleting <italic>rad9</italic><sup>&#x0002b;</sup>, the &#x00394;<italic>srs2</italic> &#x00394;<italic>rqh1</italic> cells escape a checkpoint-dependent arrest, reducing their elongated cell cycle time and, therefore, partially suppressing their slow growth. We also reasoned that an apparent suppression of slow growth would occur if deletion of <italic>rad9</italic><sup>&#x0002b;</sup> improved cell survival in &#x00394;<italic>srs2</italic> &#x00394;<italic>rqh1</italic> cells. We suggest this in light of our finding that the &#x00394;<italic>srs2</italic> &#x00394;<italic>rqh1</italic> double mutant shows a high rate of spontaneous cell death, contributing to an appearance of slow growth. Therefore, we measured the plating efficiency of &#x00394;<italic>srs2</italic> &#x00394;<italic>rqh1</italic> and compared it with that of the &#x00394;<italic>srs2</italic> &#x00394;<italic>rqh1</italic> &#x00394;<italic>rad9</italic> triple mutant. The data shown in Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="gkf581tb3">3</xref> reveal that the plating efficiency of the triple mutant was actually worse than that of the double mutant, 7.5&#x00025; for &#x00394;<italic>srs2</italic> &#x00394;<italic>rqh1</italic> &#x00394;<italic>rad9</italic> versus 17.6&#x00025; for &#x00394;<italic>srs2</italic> &#x00394;<italic>rqh1</italic>. Therefore, the increased growth rate in the triple mutant cannot be explained by improved cell viability. These data support the conclusion that loss of <italic>rad9</italic><sup>&#x0002b;</sup> in &#x00394;<italic>srs2</italic> &#x00394;<italic>rqh1</italic> improves the growth rate because these cells can no longer induce a checkpoint-dependent arrest.</p><p>We next wanted to ask whether the arrest of &#x00394;<italic>srs2</italic> &#x00394;<italic>rqh1</italic> cells was specific to S-phase or G<sub>2</sub>. To answer this question we made &#x00394;<italic>cds1</italic> &#x00394;<italic>srs2</italic> &#x00394;<italic>rqh1</italic> and &#x00394;<italic>chk1</italic> &#x00394;<italic>srs2</italic> &#x00394;<italic>rqh1</italic> triple mutants and examined the growth and morphology of these cells. Cds1 controls S-phase checkpoint arrest while Chk1 controls G<sub>2</sub> checkpoint arrest. While the loss of <italic>cds1</italic><sup>&#x0002b;</sup> had no effect on cell growth, loss of <italic>chk1</italic><sup>&#x0002b;</sup> did improve cell growth (data not shown). Consistent with this finding, loss of <italic>chk1</italic><sup>&#x0002b;</sup> suppressed the appearance of elongated cells normally seen in the &#x00394;<italic>srs2</italic> &#x00394;<italic>rqh1</italic> mutant (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf581f5">5</xref>C), while loss of <italic>cds1</italic><sup>&#x0002b;</sup> had no apparent effect on the morphology of &#x00394;<italic>srs2</italic> &#x00394;<italic>rqh1</italic> cells. &#x00394;<italic>cds1</italic> &#x00394;<italic>srs2</italic> &#x00394;<italic>rqh1</italic> and &#x00394;<italic>chk1</italic> &#x00394;<italic>srs2</italic> &#x00394;<italic>rqh1</italic> triple mutants had plating efficiencies similar to &#x00394;<italic>srs2</italic> &#x00394;<italic>rqh1</italic>, 22 and 14&#x00025;, respectively. These results are consistent with the &#x00394;<italic>srs2</italic> &#x00394;<italic>rqh1</italic> mutant arresting in G<sub>2</sub>.</p></sec><sec><title>The slow growth of &#x00394;<italic>srs2</italic> &#x00394;<italic>rqh1</italic> double mutants is suppressed by loss of the recombination pathway</title><p>Loss of <italic>rqh1</italic><sup>&#x0002b;</sup>, as well as other members of the <italic>recQ</italic> family, leads to hyper-recombination, as does loss of <italic>srs2</italic><sup>&#x0002b;</sup> in <italic>S.pombe</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf581c8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf581c41">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf581c44">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf581c45">45</xref>). Thus, the phenotype associated with the simultaneous loss of both <italic>srs2</italic><sup>&#x0002b;</sup> and <italic>rqh1</italic><sup>&#x0002b;</sup> might be explained by increased rates of recombination. It follows that eliminating recombination genes might suppress the slow growth seen in this double mutant. To study this, we created two different recombination deficient strains, &#x00394;<italic>srs2</italic> &#x00394;<italic>rqh1</italic> &#x00394;<italic>rhp51</italic> and &#x00394;<italic>srs2</italic> &#x00394;<italic>rqh1</italic> &#x00394;<italic>rhp57</italic>. One complicating factor with these studies is that in <italic>S.pombe</italic> recombination mutants themselves are slow growing, although not nearly as severe as &#x00394;<italic>srs2</italic> &#x00394;<italic>rqh1</italic>. Despite this, we were able to see clear suppression of the slow growth in &#x00394;<italic>srs2</italic> &#x00394;<italic>rqh1</italic> when either recombination gene was deleted (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf581f6">6</xref>A and B). We created the triple mutant by random spores and characterized over 100 colonies for each strain. Our &#x00394;<italic>rhp51</italic> and &#x00394;<italic>rhp57</italic> strains were disrupted with <italic>ura4</italic><sup>&#x0002b;</sup> while both &#x00394;<italic>srs2</italic> and &#x00394;<italic>rqh1</italic> were disrupted with <italic>kanMX</italic>. This allowed us to rapidly screen our colonies. We found that every slow growing colony that we examined was &#x00394;<italic>srs2</italic> &#x00394;<italic>rqh1</italic> while faster growing colonies were always either &#x00394;<italic>rhp51</italic> or &#x00394;<italic>rhp57</italic>. The figure shows that loss of <italic>rhp51</italic><sup>&#x0002b;</sup> partially suppresses the slow growth of &#x00394;<italic>srs2</italic> &#x00394;<italic>rqh1</italic> double mutants, to a level similar to that of the &#x00394;<italic>rhp51</italic> single mutant (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf581f6">6</xref>A). &#x00394;<italic>rhp57</italic> mutant was also found to suppress the slow growth of &#x00394;<italic>srs2</italic> &#x00394;<italic>rqh1</italic> (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf581f6">6</xref>B).</p><p>Clearly, loss of recombination suppresses the slow growth of &#x00394;<italic>srs2</italic> &#x00394;<italic>rqh1</italic>, but does it improve cell survival? To test this we measured the plating efficiency of &#x00394;<italic>srs2</italic> &#x00394;<italic>rqh1</italic> &#x00394;<italic>rhp51</italic> and compared it with the double mutant as well as the single mutants. In Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="gkf581tb3">3</xref>, we see that the triple mutant showed a plating efficiency of 40&#x00025; as compared with &#x00394;<italic>srs2</italic> &#x00394;<italic>rqh1</italic>, which was only 17.4&#x00025;. The efficiency was not as good as the single &#x00394;<italic>rhp51</italic> mutant, which was 65&#x00025;.</p><p>In light of the discrepancy between our data and that of Wang <italic>et al</italic>. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf581c41">41</xref>) concerning suppression of &#x00394;<italic>srs2</italic> &#x00394;<italic>rqh1</italic> slow growth by loss of recombination genes, we carried out one other experiment to eliminate the possibility that our suppression was the result of some spontaneous suppressor. To determine if a spontaneous suppressor did arise in our strains we crossed &#x00394;<italic>srs2</italic> &#x00394;<italic>rqh1</italic> to &#x00394;<italic>srs2</italic> &#x00394;<italic>rqh1</italic> &#x00394;<italic>rhp51</italic>. The progeny were analyzed by random sporulation. Spores were found to be either large or small at about 50:50. A screen of over 100 colonies from the cross found that all of the large colonies that were tested contained &#x00394;<italic>rhp51</italic> (data not shown). This demonstrates that the suppression is due to the loss of recombination and not due to a spontaneous suppressor. From these results we show conclusively that the synthetic slow growth of &#x00394;<italic>srs2</italic> &#x00394;<italic>rqh1</italic> is suppressed in a recombination deficient background. These results are consistent with findings reported in <italic>S.cerevisiae</italic> where it was demonstrated that the synthetic lethality or slow growth of <italic>srs2</italic><italic>sgs1</italic> is suppressed by mutations in genes coding for proteins of the recombination machinery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf581c14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf581c30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf581c32">32</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Loss of <italic>srs2</italic><sup>&#x0002b;</sup> partially suppresses the HU and UV sensitivity of &#x00394;<italic>rqh1</italic></title><p>Our FACS analysis of synchronized &#x00394;<italic>srs2</italic> &#x00394;<italic>rqh1</italic> cells indicates that these cells progress through S-phase slightly slower than wild type, which seems to argue against the slow growth being primarily a function of stalled replication. However, it is possible that the impairment seen in &#x00394;<italic>srs2</italic> &#x00394;<italic>rqh1</italic> cells is related to an inability to properly respond to stalled replication forks, even though the major cell cycle arrest occurs outside of S-phase. If stalled forks are the problem, then increasing the number of stalled replication forks in &#x00394;<italic>srs2</italic> &#x00394;<italic>rqh1</italic> cells by DNA damage with UV radiation or depleting the nucleotide pool with HU should have a profound negative effect on cell survival. In Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf581f7">7</xref>A, it is seen that rather than being more sensitive to UV the &#x00394;<italic>srs2</italic> &#x00394;<italic>rqh1</italic> double mutant was actually less sensitive to UV than that of the &#x00394;<italic>rqh1</italic> single mutant. &#x00394;<italic>srs2</italic> &#x00394;<italic>rqh1</italic> double mutants showed an equivalent sensitivity to 12 mM HU in liquid culture when compared with the &#x00394;<italic>rqh1</italic> single mutant (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf581f7">7</xref>B). To consider the possibility that the lack of increased sensitivity to HU in the double mutant was a function of its slow growth, we examined the HU sensitivity of the double mutant with continuous HU exposure by plating cells directly onto HU-containing plates. Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf581f7">7</xref>C shows plates containing 2.4 mM HU after 8 days of incubation.

Together, these data support the conclusion that loss of <italic>srs2</italic><sup>&#x0002b;</sup> partially suppresses the HU and UV sensitivity of &#x00394;<italic>rqh1</italic>.

The synthetic phenotype of &#x00394;<italic>srs2</italic> &#x00394;<italic>rqh1</italic> would suggest that Srs2 plays a similar or alternative role at stalled forks. However, our data do not support this interpretation. First, if the phenotype of the double mutant results from a major defect in the cells&#x02019; ability to cope with spontaneously arising stalled replication forks, then predictably these cells should arrest or slow in S-phase. Our FACS data from synchronized cells show that &#x00394;<italic>srs2</italic> &#x00394;<italic>rqh1</italic> show only a slight delay in S-phase (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf581f3">3</xref>). Second, if the phenotype of the double mutant results from a defect in its ability to cope with replication fork stalling, then these cells should be extremely sensitive to any increase in the number of stalled forks. Again we find this not to be the case, as the &#x00394;<italic>srs2</italic> &#x00394;<italic>rqh1</italic> double mutant actually shows increased survival when exposed to UV or treated with HU when compared with &#x00394;<italic>rqh1</italic> (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf581f7">7</xref>A, B and C). These results argue against the phenotype of the double mutant resulting from stalled replication.</p><p>If &#x00394;<italic>srs2</italic> &#x00394;<italic>rqh1</italic> cells are not arresting in S-phase at a significant level, where do they arrest? In an effort to determine this, &#x00394;<italic>srs2</italic> &#x00394;<italic>rqh1</italic>, wild-type and single mutant cells were DAPI stained and examined microscopically at times after release from G<sub>1</sub> synchronization. Cells from each time point were scored as being either small or normal in size, elongated (assumed to be in G<sub>2</sub> arrest), bi-nucleated (cells having completed mitosis) or abnormal (cells with torn or fragmented nuclei). We draw two conclusions from these studies. Our first conclusion, based on the data in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf581f4">4</xref>, is that some double mutant cells appear to cycle normally. Initially both wild-type and &#x00394;<italic>srs2</italic> &#x00394;<italic>rqh1</italic> cells are small with single nuclei. At 3.5 h, which is the earliest time that double nucleated wild-type cells are seen, an equal number of &#x00394;<italic>srs2</italic> &#x00394;<italic>rqh1</italic> are double nucleated. This shows that cells have progressed through mitosis. At later time points we see continued evidence of &#x00394;<italic>srs2</italic> &#x00394;<italic>rqh1</italic> cells cycling normally, as double nucleated cells continue to be present. Our second conclusion is that many &#x00394;<italic>srs2</italic> &#x00394;<italic>rqh1</italic> cells undergo an arrest, most likely at G<sub>2</sub>&#x0002f;M. This conclusion is based on our observation that large numbers of &#x00394;<italic>srs2</italic> &#x00394;<italic>rqh1</italic> cells accumulate as single nucleated (pre-mitotic) elongated cells. In combination with our FACS data showing no major accumulation of cells in S-phase, these elongated cells with a single nucleus must be in G<sub>2</sub>, unable to enter M. We cannot rule out the possibility that these cells are in very late S-phase. By 6 h there are essentially no elongated cells found in wild-type, yet 25&#x00025; of &#x00394;<italic>srs2</italic> &#x00394;<italic>rqh1</italic> cells are elongated. In addition to elongated cells, at 6 h 7&#x00025; of &#x00394;<italic>srs2</italic> &#x00394;<italic>rqh1</italic> cells have aberrant or torn nuclei. This occurs in elongated cells, suggesting that some arrested cells ultimately undergo mitotic catastrophe. While we did not look at time points beyond 6 h, we assume that the number of cells showing mitotic catastrophe will continue to accumulate with time. We speculate that most, if not all, elongated cells will fail to progress through mitosis properly. This cannot be determined by these experiments, as elongated cells will continue to accumulate. However, if this assumption is correct, then the 25&#x00025; of elongated cells together with the 7&#x00025; of cells having already undergone mitotic catastrophe represent one-third of the cell population dying during each round of the cell cycle. This number is in good agreement with a doubling time of &#x0223c;6 h for &#x00394;<italic>srs2</italic> &#x00394;<italic>rqh1</italic>. A recent study in <italic>S.cerevisiae</italic> demonstrated that 15&#x00025; of <italic>srs2 sgs1</italic> double mutants arrest in mitosis as large budded cells and that this arrest was checkpoint dependent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf581c20">20</xref>). Cells arrested in mitosis were also found in 7&#x00025; of <italic>srs2</italic> and 2&#x00025; of <italic>sgs1</italic> single mutants, demonstrating that this is not strictly a phenotype of the double mutant. Interestingly, when we examined &#x00394;<italic>srs2</italic> in a similar experiment, there was no evidence of G<sub>2</sub>&#x0002f;M arrested cells or cells undergoing a mitotic catastrophe. We saw evidence for a few elongated &#x00394;<italic>rqh1</italic> cells suggesting a mild arrest. These data demonstrate that the apparent slow growth of &#x00394;<italic>srs2</italic> &#x00394;<italic>rqh1</italic> cells is not due to a homogeneous slowing of the entire cell population, but that this is a mixed population of normal cycling and arrested cells. This indicates that the cellular events leading to cell cycle arrest are stochastic.</p><p>The G<sub>2</sub>&#x0002f;M arrest seen in &#x00394;<italic>srs2</italic> &#x00394;<italic>rqh1</italic> cells is likely due to the accumulation of some type of DNA damage or structure that induces a checkpoint response. This is further corroborated by our finding that deletion of the <italic>rad9</italic><sup>&#x0002b;</sup> checkpoint gene suppresses the accumulation of the elongated, G<sub>2</sub>&#x0002f;M arrested cells in the &#x00394;<italic>srs2</italic> &#x00394;<italic>rqh1</italic> mutant (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf581f5">5</xref>B). While we cannot be certain what DNA structure is recognized as damage, it is tempting to speculate that it is recombination intermediates. This is based on the fact that &#x00394;<italic>srs2</italic> mutants have been reported to have a hyper-recombination phenotype and our findings that loss of recombination genes suppresses the slow growth of &#x00394;<italic>srs2</italic> &#x00394;<italic>rqh1</italic> cells and improves their viability (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf581f6">6</xref>A and B, and Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="gkf581tb3">3</xref>). It is known that Cds1 regulates the S-phase arrest while Chk1 regulates the G<sub>2</sub> arrest. Our data, showing that loss of <italic>chk1</italic><sup>&#x0002b;</sup> but not <italic>cds1</italic><sup>&#x0002b;</sup> suppresses the elongated morphology seen in &#x00394;<italic>srs2</italic> &#x00394;<italic>rqh1</italic>, further support the conclusion that these cells are arresting in G<sub>2</sub>.</p></sec><sec><title>Deletion of recombination genes suppress the &#x00394;<italic>srs2</italic> &#x00394;<italic>rqh1</italic> phenotype</title><p>Previous studies demonstrated that &#x00394;<italic>rqh1</italic> mutants have no increase or only slightly elevated recombination rates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf581c8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf581c18">18</xref>). However, loss of Srs2 is associated with a 12-fold increase in spontaneous recombination rates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf581c41">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf581c45">45</xref>). The elevated recombination rates in &#x00394;<italic>srs2</italic> do not appear to have any obvious deleterious effect on cells, as they grow normally and have normal morphologies. We wondered if the severe phenotype seen in &#x00394;<italic>srs2</italic> &#x00394;<italic>rqh1</italic> was due to the inability of these cells to deal effectively with recombination. This would appear to be the case as we found that deletion of either <italic>rhp51</italic><sup>&#x0002b;</sup> or <italic>rhp57</italic><sup>&#x0002b;</sup> markedly suppresses the slow growth and low viability of &#x00394;<italic>srs2</italic> &#x00394;<italic>rqh1</italic> cells. Loss of recombination also returns &#x00394;<italic>srs2</italic> &#x00394;<italic>rqh1</italic> cells to a more normal cellular phenotype. This normalization suggests that recombination is at least a partial cause of the aberrant phenotype seen in the double mutant. One interpretation of these results is that potential problems caused by hyper-recombination in &#x00394;<italic>srs2</italic> cells are suppressed by Rqh1 function, and so the problems are only seen upon simultaneous loss of both genes.</p><p>Our findings of slow growth suppression in &#x00394;<italic>srs2</italic> &#x00394;<italic>rqh1</italic> cells by loss of recombination are in contrast to the results of Wang <italic>et al</italic>. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf581c41">41</xref>). They reported that &#x00394;<italic>rhp51</italic> failed to suppress the slow growth of &#x00394;<italic>srs2</italic> &#x00394;<italic>rqh1</italic> and, in fact, the triple mutant grew worse. We found clear suppression by not only loss of <italic>rhp51</italic><sup>&#x0002b;</sup>, but also by loss of <italic>rhp57</italic><sup>&#x0002b;</sup>. Additionally, they reported that their &#x00394;<italic>srs2</italic> &#x00394;<italic>rhp51</italic> double mutant looked like a &#x00394;<italic>srs2</italic> &#x00394;<italic>rqh1</italic> mutant and were more sensitive to UV damage than the &#x00394;<italic>rhp51</italic> single mutant. Our experiments showed neither a synthetic interaction between &#x00394;<italic>srs2</italic> and &#x00394;<italic>rhp51</italic> nor increased UV sensitivity in the double mutant compared with the &#x00394;<italic>rhp51</italic> single mutant (data not shown). Other results with &#x00394;<italic>srs2</italic> were the same between our laboratories. This suggests that the discrepancies may arise from the use of different &#x00394;<italic>rhp51</italic> mutants which could contain uncharacterized strain differences. We used the &#x00394;<italic>rhp51</italic> reported previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf581c46">46</xref>), while Wang <italic>et al</italic>. used a &#x00394;<italic>rhp51</italic> created for their studies. However, we are confident in our conclusion that loss of recombination suppresses the &#x00394;<italic>srs2</italic> &#x00394;<italic>rqh1</italic> phenotype based on the fact that we observed suppression with two different recombination mutants and that comparable results have been established for the budding yeast <italic>S.cerevisiae</italic>. We also addressed the possibility that our suppression was due to a spontaneous suppressor. Our results argue against the presence of a spontaneous suppressor of the &#x00394;<italic>srs2</italic> &#x00394;<italic>rqh1</italic> phenotype.</p></sec><sec><title>&#x00394;<italic>srs2</italic> is synthetic lethal with &#x00394;<italic>rhp54</italic></title><p>While searching for recombination mutants that would suppress the slow growth of &#x00394;<italic>srs2</italic> &#x00394;<italic>rqh1</italic>, we found synthetic lethality between &#x00394;<italic>srs2</italic> and &#x00394;<italic>rhp54</italic>. This lethality was suppressed by deletion of <italic>rhp51</italic><sup>&#x0002b;</sup>. Two possible explanations could account for this result. One is that Srs2 functions in recombination in a process in parallel with Rhp54 and that one of these two proteins is necessary to complete recombination initiated by Rhp51. This would explain why deletion of <italic>rhp51</italic><sup>&#x0002b;</sup> suppresses this synthetic lethality. An alternative explanation comes from studies in <italic>S.cerevisiae</italic> where Srs2 is known to function in the PRR pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf581c24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf581c29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf581c47">47</xref>). Loss of <italic>srs2</italic> in a <italic>rad6</italic> mutant suppresses the UV sensitivity of these strains presumably by allowing repair of DNA damage to occur by homologous recombination. While we do not know if Srs2 plays the same role in PRR in <italic>S.pombe</italic>, the same synthetic lethality between &#x00394;<italic>srs2</italic> and &#x00394;<italic>rad54</italic> exists in <italic>S.cerevisiae</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf581c31">31</xref>). We also know that loss of <italic>srs2</italic><sup>&#x0002b;</sup> in <italic>S.pombe</italic> leads to a hyper-recombination phenotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf581c41">41</xref>). From this, we can speculate that in the absence of <italic>srs2</italic>, damaged or incompletely replicated DNA is funneled into the Rhp51-dependent homologous recombination pathway. Presumably the process initiated by Rhp51 in a &#x00394;<italic>srs2</italic> background requires Rhp54 to be completed, and the initiation of this process in the absence of Rhp54 leads to lethality. In this scenario, Srs2 plays an indirect role in recombination.</p></sec><sec><title>Why does loss of <italic>srs2</italic><sup>&#x0002b;</sup> suppress <italic>rqh1</italic> sensitivity to UV and HU?</title><p>It is difficult to explain how deletion of <italic>srs2</italic><sup>&#x0002b;</sup> in a &#x00394;<italic>rqh1</italic> background can have a negative effect on cell growth and viability, yet have a protective effect on the ability of these cells to cope with UV and HU. We have already given a reasonable possible explanation for the synthetic interaction between &#x00394;<italic>srs2</italic> and &#x00394;<italic>rqh1</italic> as it relates to normal growth. It is not necessary to link these two phenotypes since one happens in damaged or replication arrested cells and the other is a spontaneous response. One possibility is as follows: upon replication arrest, caused by DNA damage or HU treatment, recombination takes place at a high rate in the absence of Rqh1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf581c8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf581c18">18</xref>). It is the process of recombination that leads to the decrease in viability seen in these cells. We base this latter statement on the finding that expression of a recombination resolvase partially suppresses the HU and UV sensitivity of &#x00394;<italic>rqh1</italic> cells. In addition, unpublished data from our laboratory show that loss of either <italic>rhp51</italic><sup>&#x0002b;</sup> or <italic>rhp57</italic><sup>&#x0002b;</sup> completely or nearly completely suppresses the HU or UV sensitivity of &#x00394;<italic>rqh1</italic>. One proposed function of <italic>SRS2</italic> in <italic>S.cerevisiae</italic> is to act downstream of <italic>RAD51</italic> to stabilize recombination intermediates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf581c39">39</xref>). By enhancing recombination, Srs2 might increase the HU and UV sensitivity of &#x00394;<italic>rqh1</italic> cells. This proposed function might explain why the loss of Srs2 improves the survival of &#x00394;<italic>rqh1</italic> cells when challenged with UV or HU. Obviously, further investigation will be necessary to answer this question with certainty.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="display-objects"><title>Figures and Tables</title><fig id="gkf581f1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p> Characterization of the &#x00394;<italic>srs2</italic> mutant.
