However, it remains unknown how Zn homeostasis is regulated in mast cells and if Zn transporters are involved in allergic reactions. We show that Znt5/Slc30a5 is required for contact hypersensitivity and mast cell&#x02013;mediated delayed-type allergic response but not for immediate passive cutaneous anaphylaxis. In mast cells from Znt5<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice, Fc&#x003f5; receptor I (Fc&#x003f5;RI)&#x02013;induced cytokine production was diminished, but degranulation was intact. Znt5 was involved in Fc&#x003f5;RI-induced translocation of protein kinase C (PKC) to the plasma membrane and the nuclear translocation of nuclear factor &#x003ba;B. In addition, the Zn finger&#x02013;like motif of PKC was required for its plasma membrane translocation and binding to diacylglycerol. Thus, Znt5 is selectively required for the mast cell&#x02013;mediated delayed-type allergic response, and it is a novel player in mast cell activation.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><p>Zinc (Zn) is one of the essential trace elements. It is a structural component of a great number of proteins, including enzymes and transcription factors, and it is essential for their biological activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">2</xref>). Zn has a variety of effects in the immune system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">3</xref>). Zn-deficient mice have defects in natural killer cell&#x02013;mediated cytotoxic activity, antibody-mediated responses, host defense against pathogens, and tumors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">6</xref>). In contrast, Zn itself is cytotoxic, and it induces apoptosis in T and B cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">7</xref>). Therefore, cells have evolved a complex system to maintain a balance of Zn uptake, intracellular storage, and efflux (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">11</xref>). Two solute-linked carrier (Slc) protein families have been identified in Zn transport: the Zn transporter (Znt)/Slc30 and ZRT/IRT-related protein (Zip)/Slc39 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">13</xref>). Znt transporters reduce cytoplasmic Zn availability by promoting Zn efflux from the cytoplasm into the extracellular space or intracellular compartments. The Zip transporters increase cytoplasmic Zn availability by promoting extracellular Zn uptake and Zn release from compartments into the cytoplasm.</p><p>Zn has also been implicated as an intracellular signaling molecule (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">17</xref>). A nematode ZnT1 orthologue, CDF1, positively affects Ras&#x02013;extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) signal transduction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">18</xref>). Slc39a7/Zip7 was found to affect epidermal growth factor/insulin-like growth factor signaling and tamoxifen resistance of breast cancer cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">19</xref>). We showed that Slc39a6/Zip6/Liv1 controls the nuclear localization of the Zn finger transcription factor Snail (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">20</xref>). In addition, Toll-like receptor 4&#x02013;mediated DC maturation is, at least in part, dependent on a Toll-like receptor 4&#x02013;induced decrease in intracellular free Zn effected by a change in the gene expression profile of Zip and Znt family members (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">21</xref>). Furthermore, in mast cells, Fc&#x003f5; receptor I (Fc&#x003f5;RI) stimulation induces an increase in intracellular free Zn, a phenomenon called the &#x0201c;Zn wave&#x0201d; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">22</xref>). These results support the idea that Zn is involved in intracellular signaling and lead to the prediction that Znts have roles not only in maintaining Zn homeostasis but also in intracellular signaling events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">17</xref>). Along these lines, we previously showed that Zn might be required for mast cell activation in allergic responses; the Zn chelator TPEN (<italic>N</italic>,<italic>N</italic>,<italic>N</italic>,<italic>N</italic>-tetrakis (2-pyridylmethyl) ethylenediamine) inhibits Fc&#x003f5;RI-mediated NF-&#x003ba;B activation and degranulation in mast cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">23</xref>). All of these results suggest that Zn has pivotal roles in mast cell function. However, it remains completely unknown how Zn homeostasis is regulated in mast cells and if Znts are involved in mast cell function.</p><p>Mast cells are major players in allergy responses such as immediate- and delayed-type hypersensitivity reactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">24</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">26</xref>). Passive cutaneous anaphylaxis (PCA) and contact hypersensitivity (CHS) are mouse models for in vivo immediate-type and delayed-type reactions, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">27</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">29</xref>). Fc&#x003f5;RI stimulation activates several downstream pathways that initiate the allergic inflammatory process by eliciting mast cell degranulation accompanied by the rapid release of preformed chemical mediators such as histamine and serotonin. This process plays critical roles in the immediate-type allergic response. In contrast, the mast cell&#x02013;mediated delayed responses and IgE-induced chronic allergic inflammatory processes are mainly dependent on cytokine production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">31</xref>). One important question in mast cell biology is how the early signaling events after Fc&#x003f5;RI stimulation are integrated and how specific mast cell responses, such as immediate degranulation versus a delayed-type allergic reaction, are selected. It would be helpful to understand these mechanisms because the identification of molecules that selectively regulate specific mast cell effector functions could provide targets for therapies for mast cell&#x02013;mediated diseases.</p><p>Fc&#x003f5;RI stimulation can induce the de novo synthesis of proinflammatory cytokines such as IL-6 and TNF-&#x003b1; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">33</xref>). In particular, both calcium and diacylglycerol (DAG) activate conventional protein kinase C (PKC) isoforms that mediate a critical positive signal necessary for cytokine production in mast cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">35</xref>). In addition, conventional PKCs have two regions in their regulatory domain, C1 and C2, in common. The C1 region regulates the activation or translocation of PKC and has two cysteine-rich loops (Zn finger-like motifs) that interact with DAG or phorbol esters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">36</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">40</xref>). The C2 region mediates calcium binding. Recently, in T, B, and mast cells, PKCs were shown to be important for NF-&#x003ba;B activation and the upstream function of an adaptor protein complex composed of Bcl-10 and MALT1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">41</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">43</xref>). Collectively, these studies indicate that the PKC/Bcl-10/MALT1/NF-&#x003ba;B cascade plays important roles in cytokine production. Although this linear cascade is well established, it still seems oversimplified. Additional molecules are likely to be involved in the regulation of the PKC&#x02013;NF-&#x003ba;B signaling pathway.</p><p>Inoue et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">44</xref>) reported that mice deficient in Znt5 show severe osteopenia and male-specific sudden death from bradyarrhythmia during their reproductive period. We demonstrate in this paper that a Znt, Znt5, is required for the mast cell&#x02013;mediated delayed-type allergic response but not the immediate response. Znt5 is required for the Fc&#x003f5;RI-induced translocation of PKC-&#x003b2; to the plasma membrane and, therefore, for NF-&#x003ba;B&#x02013;dependent cytokine production. These observations provide the first genetic evidence that a Znt, Znt5, is required for immunological responses and has a selective role in allergic reactions.</p><sec sec-type="results"><title>RESULTS</title><sec><title>Znt5 is highly expressed in BM-derived mast cells (BMMCs) but not required for mast cell development</title><p>There are eight known members of the Znt family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">45</xref>). To examine the role of the Znts in mast cells, we checked the expression level of each family member in BMMCs by examining the ReFDIC (Reference Database of Immune Cells) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">46</xref>). The database showed that Znt5 was among the Znts that were highly expressed in BMMCs (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20082533/DC1">Fig. S1</ext-link>). The messenger RNA (mRNA) level of Znt5 was also enhanced by Fc&#x003f5;RI stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 A</xref> and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20082533/DC1">Fig. S2</ext-link>). Because Znt5<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice are available (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">44</xref>), we focused on Znt5 to clarify its role in mast cell function. First, we determined that Znt5 protein was expressed in BMMCs from WT but not Znt5<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 B</xref>). We also determined that in the BMMCs, Znt5 was mainly located in the Golgi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 C</xref>), as reported previously for other cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">47</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">48</xref>). Next, we investigated whether Zn homeostasis was disordered in Znt5<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mast cells using a cell-permeable Zn-specific fluorescent probe, Newport green DCF diacetate, which predominantly localizes to the cytoplasm. The Znt5<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> BMMCs showed an increased level of free Zn in the cytoplasm (Znt5<sup>+/+</sup> = 0.0723 &#x000b1; 0.00225 &#x000b5;M; Znt5<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> = 0.106 &#x000b1; 0.0132 &#x000b5;M; P &#x0003c; 0.05; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 D</xref>), indicating that the intracellular distribution of free Zn was impaired in the Znt5<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> BMMCs.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p><bold>Localization of Znt5 in BMMCs.</bold> (A) RT-PCR of mRNAs encoding Znt family members (1&#x02013;8), IL-6, and hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyl transferase in BMMCs.

Culturing BM cells from WT and Znt5<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice in the presence of IL-3 yielded highly purified mast cell populations. These BMMCs, whether derived from WT or Znt5<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice, were indistinguishable in morphology when stained with Alcian blue (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20082533/DC1">Fig. S3 A</ext-link>). The growth rate and total cell numbers in these cultures, as well as the frequency of BMMCs as revealed by flow cytometric analysis of the surface expression of c-kit and Fc&#x003f5;RI, were equivalent (Fig. S3 B). In addition to the normal in vitro development of the mast cells, the number of mast cells, their morphology, and their anatomical distribution in the ear, skin, and stomach of WT and Znt5<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice were comparable (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20082533/DC1">Fig. S4, A and B</ext-link>).

The mast cell is widely recognized as the most important effector cell in IgE-associated allergic disorders such as anaphylaxis. Previous experiments with genetically mast cell&#x02013;deficient Kit<sup>W</sup>/Kit<sup>W-V</sup> or Kit<sup>W-sh</sup>/Kit<sup>W-sh</sup> mice have shown that mast cells are required for the IgE-mediated immediate-type allergic response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">27</xref>). Thus, the participation of mast cells in the immediate allergic reaction is well established. In addition to this classical role, much evidence has accumulated showing that mast cells play crucial roles in delayed-type allergic reactions and chronic inflammatory diseases, including arthritis, experimental allergic encephalomyelitis, colitis, and CHS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">52</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">54</xref>). A variety of mast cell&#x02013;derived cytokines and chemokines are likely to be essential for delayed-type allergic reactions and chronic inflammatory diseases. In fact, the mast cell&#x02013;defective Kit<sup>W</sup>/Kit<sup>W-V</sup> mouse does not develop experimental allergic encephalomyelitis, and this defect is rescued by transferred WT BMMCs but not by IL-4&#x02013;deficient BMMCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">55</xref>). These studies indicate that mast cell&#x02013;derived cytokines are important in inflammatory diseases.</p><p>In this paper, we showed that Znt5<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mast cells had an intact degranulation process but impaired cytokine and chemokine production. Most importantly, Znt5<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice had a defective mast cell&#x02013;dependent delayed-type allergic reaction, i.e., CHS, but their immediate-type reaction, i.e., PCA, was unimpaired. Therefore, the Znt5<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mouse will be valuable for further dissection of the in vivo roles of mast cells in immune and allergic responses and for analyzing the pathological status of a variety of immune-related diseases.</p></sec><sec><title>Znt5 is required for Fc&#x003f5;RI-mediated NF-&#x003ba;B activation and the translocation of PKC to the plasma membrane</title><p>Our results showed that Znt5 is important for Fc&#x003f5;RI-mediated cytokine or chemokine production. As Znt5 was mainly located in the Golgi, we first examined whether Znt5<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mast cells were defective in cytokine processing/secretion. However, LPS-induced cytokine production was normal, indicating that the transport step was unaffected by the Znt5 deficiency in mast cells. We also observed that Fc&#x003f5;RI induced normal activation of LAT and PLC-&#x003b3; and calcium mobilization. This observation is consistent with our result showing normal degranulation in Znt5<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> BMMCs. From this, we deduced that the degranulation process can be induced in Znt5<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mast cells as a result of intact calcium influx. Our results do not dispute the reported involvement of PKC in the degranulation process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">35</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">56</xref>), but this requirement for PKC may be compensated by other signaling pathways in Znt5<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mast cells. Alternatively, the threshold of the degree of PKC activation required for degranulation and that for NF-&#x003ba;B activation might be different. To support this idea, we performed PKC family inhibitor experiment and showed that PKC inhibitor-treated Znt5<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mast cells were significantly reduced by Fc&#x003f5;RI-mediated degranulation (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20082533/DC1">Fig. S11</ext-link>).</p><p>We found that Fc&#x003f5;RI-mediated NF-&#x003ba;B activation was defective in the Znt5<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> BMMCs; Fc&#x003f5;RI-induced nuclear translocation of p65 was reduced, and Fc&#x003f5;RI-mediated I&#x003ba;B&#x003b1; phosphorylation and its subsequent degradation were impaired. From these results, we concluded that Znt5 is selectively required for Fc&#x003f5;RI-mediated NF-&#x003ba;B activation but not for MAPK activation or calcium mobilization.

In this paper, we showed that Znt5 was required for the Fc&#x003f5;RI- or PMA-induced translocation of PKC-&#x003b2; to the plasma membrane of BMMCs, and this requirement explains why Znt5 is needed for NF-&#x003ba;B activation.</p><p>A related question is how Znt5 regulates the plasma membrane translocation of PKC-&#x003b2;, and several of our findings relate to this issue: the C1A Zn finger&#x02013;like motif of PKC-&#x003b2; was required for translocation of PKC to the plasma membrane; mutating the C1A Zn finger&#x02013;like motif of PKC-&#x003b2; diminished its ability to bind PMA; PKC obtained from Znt5<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> BMMCs showed decreased binding to PMA; Znt5 was located in the Golgi; and Znt5<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> BMMCs showed an increase in cytoplasmic free Zn. Because Znt5 was located in the Golgi, it probably promotes a Zn efflux from the cytoplasm into the Golgi. Because Znt5<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> BMMCs had increased cytoplasmic free Zn, it seems likely that the available Zn in the Golgi was decreased concomitantly.</p><p>Together, these observations suggested the hypothesis that in the Znt5<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> BMMCs, the Zn available to the C1A Zn finger&#x02013;like motif of PKC as it transits through the Golgi is decreased, which results in an increase in Zn-free PKC. The mutation of the Zn-binding site of C1A interfered with the plasma membrane translocation of PKC, and this mutation also diminished PMA binding to PKC. Collectively, our findings suggest that binding of Zn to the C1A of PKC induces a conformational change required for DAG binding, which is itself required for the translocation of PKC to the plasma membrane. This hypothesis is supported by our data as well as by findings from other groups that Zn is involved in the translocation of PKC to the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">59</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">61</xref>). Furthermore, in experiments using Znt5<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> DT40 cells, Suzuki et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">48</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">62</xref>) showed that Znt5 expressed on the ER-Golgi membrane is required for the enzymatic activity of the Zn-dependent alkaline phosphatases (ALPs), which are processed from apoALPs to holoALPs in the ER-Golgi.</p><p>In summary, the results in this paper show that a Znt, Znt5, is selectively required for the mast cell&#x02013;mediated delayed-type allergic response but not for the immediate-type allergic reaction. We further showed that Znt5 is required in the PKC-mediated NF-&#x003ba;B signaling pathway. The identification of Znt5 as a novel component of Fc&#x003f5;RI-mediated PKC activation sheds light on the molecular mechanisms of the processing and activation of PKC and of the Zn-mediated regulation of mast cell&#x02013;dependent allergic responses, specifically of the delayed type.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title/><sec><title>Mice.</title><p>C57BL/6J mice were obtained from CREA Japan.
