Recently developed 3C and 4C technology allowed us to test the importance of transcription for nuclear architecture. We demonstrate that upon transcription inhibition binding of RNA polymerase II to gene regulatory elements is severely reduced. However, contacts between regulatory DNA elements and genes in the &#x003b2;-globin locus are unaffected and the locus still interacts with the same genomic regions elsewhere on the chromosome. This is a general phenomenon since the great majority of intra- and interchromosomal interactions with the ubiquitously expressed <italic>Rad23a</italic> gene are also not affected. Our data demonstrate that without transcription the organization and modification of nucleosomes at active loci and the local binding of specific trans-acting factors is unaltered. We propose that these parameters, more than transcription or RNA polymerase II binding, determine the maintenance of long-range DNA interactions.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="12"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>An intricate relationship appears to exist between chromosome folding and gene expression in the mammalian cell nucleus <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001661-Lanctot1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001661-Misteli1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>.

Recently we have used novel 4C technology to analyze the genomic environments of several gene loci and found that active and inactive loci tend to separate in the nuclear space.

We demonstrate that ongoing RNAPII transcription or the presence of RNAPII at regulatory sites is not required to maintain the shape of the genome in the mammalian cell nucleus. In absence of transcription the overall chromatin state remains unaltered. This observation supports the notion that the organization and modification of nucleosomes along the DNA fiber and the binding of specific <italic>trans</italic>-acting factors, more than transcription or RNAPII-binding, determines the interaction between DNA loci and the formation of chromatin loops.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Inhibition of transcription in the &#x003b2;-globin locus</title><p>To study the role of RNAPII transcription in nuclear architecture, we investigated the intricate folding of the &#x003b2;-globin locus and its long-range contacts with other genes in primary erythroid cells treated with drugs that inhibit transcription. First, we extensively tested how drug treatment affected transcription at the &#x003b2;-globin locus. Single cell suspensions made from freshly dissected E14.5 fetal livers were cultured for five hours in the presence of very stringent concentrations of &#x003b1;-amanitin (100 &#x000b5;g/ml), a drug that inhibits RNAPII transcription initiation and elongation. Previous studies have demonstrated that under similar conditions RNAPII transcription is inhibited within one hour of treatment while the level of serine2-phosphorylated RNAPII is strongly reduced <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001661-Xie1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001661-Branco1">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref>. In order to distinguish between effects of transcription initiation versus elongation on genome organization we also used 5,6-dichloro-1-&#x003b2;-D-ribofuranosylbenzamidazole (DRB) (3 hours, 100 &#x000b5;M) in some experiments. DRB is a drug that specifically inhibits kinases that phosphorylate Serine 2 of the RNAPII C-terminal domain (CTD), thereby exclusively inhibiting transcriptional elongation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001661-Chodosh1">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001661-Trimborn1">&#x0005b;25&#x0005d;</xref>. RNA FISH analysis of primary transcripts demonstrated that inhibition of transcription with DRB or &#x003b1;-amanitin was indeed very efficient, with the percentage of cells showing active globin transcription going down from &#x0003e;70&#x00025; in untreated cells to &#x0223c;3&#x00025; and 0&#x00025; in DRB- and &#x003b1;-amanitin-treated cells, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001661-g001">Figure 1B</xref>). A western blot using an antibody detecting total RNAPII demonstrated that the high molecular weight band, which represents the active phosphorylated form of RNAPII is indeed almost absent upon &#x003b1;-amanitin treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001661-g001">Figure 1C</xref>). This was confirmed when we used an antibody specific for the actively elongating RNAPII, which is phosphorylated at the Serine 2 position of its CTD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001661-g001">Figure 1C</xref>). Accordingly, foci of Ser2 phosphorylated RNAPII, which define the nuclear sites of active transcription, disappeared upon transcription inhibition (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0001661.s004">Figure S1</xref>).</p><p>Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) experiments using an antibody against RNAPII demonstrated that treatment of erythroid cells with DRB results in reduced RNAPII occupancy at intron2 and exon3 of the &#x003b2;-major gene while the &#x003b2;-major promoter remains bound (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001661-g001">Figure 1D</xref>), in agreement with DRB causing abortive transcription elongation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001661-Chodosh1">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001661-Trimborn1">&#x0005b;25&#x0005d;</xref>. In contrast, treatment with &#x003b1;-amanitin resulted in a strong reduction of RNAPII occupancy at all sites tested. RNAPII was no longer bound within the &#x003b2;-major gene and was almost absent from the hypersensitive sites in the LCR. Some RNAPII remained bound to the &#x003b2;-major promoter and the promoters of <italic>Rad23A</italic> and several other genes present at a gene-dense region of mouse chromosome 8, but in each case binding was strongly reduced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001661-g001">Figure 1D,E</xref>). These observations are in agreement with &#x003b1;-amanitin being an inhibitor of both transcription initiation and elongation by RNAPII <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001661-Gong1">&#x0005b;26&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001661-Nguyen1">&#x0005b;28&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>We conclude that under our experimental conditions transcription is efficiently inhibited. As reported previously, DRB specifically reduces the elongating form of RNAPII while &#x003b1;-amanitin inhibits both the initiating and elongation form. Importantly, upon treatment with &#x003b1;-amanitin the active, Ser2 phosphorylated, form of RNAPII disappears almost completely and association of RNAPII with regulatory elements of the &#x003b2;-globin locus and other loci is lost or strongly reduced.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>LCR-gene interactions in the &#x003b2;-globin locus are not dependent on ongoing transcription</title><p>We next investigated if transcription inhibition had an effect on DNA contacts formed between regulatory sites in gene loci.

The threshold used was based on the running mean distribution of the data after it was randomly shuffled, which reveals to what extent clustering of positive hybridization signals can occur by chance. Genomic regions were defined as interacting if they met this threshold in two independent replicate experiments (i.e. double positive regions)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001661-Simonis1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Using these criteria we identified 30 interacting regions in the untreated sample and most were the same regions, containing actively transcribed genes, as previously observed in freshly dissected, uncultured fetal liver cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001661-Simonis1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>. Of these 30 regions, 16 (53&#x00025;) were also found to be double positive in &#x003b1;-amanitin treated samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001661-g003">Figure 3A,B</xref>).</p><p>We validated these interactions using cryo-FISH.

Routinely, 250 loci or more were analyzed per cryo-FISH experiment and a person not aware of the two loci under investigation determined how frequently their hybridization signals overlapped. When we applied cryo-FISH to a region that scored double negative in the 4C analysis for the untreated and &#x003b1;-amanitin treated samples we found an interaction frequency of &#x0223c;4&#x00025; between these loci, which is similar to the background interaction that was found previously <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001661-Simonis1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>. In contrast, the regions we tested and that scored to be interacting based on the 4C data indeed had interaction frequencies significantly above the background (&#x0003e;9&#x00025;; p&#x0003c;0.001, G-test), both in untreated and &#x003b1;-amanitin treated cells. Surprisingly, when we applied cryo-FISH to four regions that scored double positive in untreated samples but not in &#x003b1;-amanitin treated samples we found interaction frequencies significantly above background (&#x0003e;9&#x00025;; p&#x0003c;0.001, G-test) not only in untreated cells but also in the &#x003b1;-amanitin treated cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001661-g003">Figure 3D</xref>). This observation shows that these regions are still in close proximity in the &#x003b1;-amanitin treated samples and demonstrates they are scored false negative by 4C technology.</p><p>We therefore examined more closely the 4C data of our &#x003b1;-amanitin treated samples, in particular the 14 out of 30 regions (47&#x00025;) that were no longer identified as interacting in these samples. We noticed that they often (11/14) scored positive for interaction in one of the 4C experiments (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0001661.s005">Figure S2</xref>), while they just failed to reach the threshold in the replicate experiment (i.e. single positive regions) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001661-g003">Figure 3B,C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0001661.s005">Figure S2</xref>). This suggests that these regions were not identified by 4C as interacting due to the stringent threshold we applied.</p><p>To find out whether 4C more often scores such regions as false negative we collected all our cryo-FISH data also from other ongoing projects. Cryo-FISH analysis of 104 different intra and interchromosomal interactions showed that regions, which scored double positive by 4C, interact significantly more frequently than 4C-negative regions (p&#x0003c;0.001, independent samples T-test). Importantly, this was also true for the 10 regions tested that scored single positive by 4C (but double positive under a different condition) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001661-g003">Figure 3E</xref>). Thus, counting by cryo-FISH of more than 26,000 alleles representing 104 different interactions confirmed that 4C very accurately identifies long-range DNA interactions. The data also demonstrate that regions identified as 4C-positive in only one of the two experiments in general represent true, i.e. non-random, interactions, at least when they are also scored double positive by 4C under a different experimental condition. Therefore, these single positives are regions are not identified as interacting by 4C, using our stringent criteria, because they fail to reach the threshold in one of the two 4C replicate experiments. Yet, they often do interact, as determined by cryo-FISH. In general, these are long-range interactions that occur in less than 5&#x00025; of the cells. Their identification by 4C relies on the detection of very rare ligation products that can easily be missed if the experiment is carried out under sub-optimal conditions.</p><p>We conclude that the great majority of interactions (at least 90&#x00025;) between the &#x003b2;-globin locus and other active gene loci are independent of ongoing transcription. This percentage may even be higher, as the 1 out 3 regions that we tested in cryo-FISH and which scored negative in each 4C replicate of the &#x003b1;-amanitin treated samples nevertheless also appeared to interact frequently (10&#x00025;) with the &#x003b2;-globin locus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001661-g003">Figure 3D</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0001661.s002">Table S2</xref>).

In FAIRE, chromatin is crosslinked with formaldehyde in vivo, sheared by sonication, and phenol-chloroform extracted. The DNA recovered in the aqueous phase is enriched for nucleosome-depleted DNA, which is coincident with the location of DNaseI hypersensitive sites, transcriptional start sites and active promoters. All regulatory elements tested in the &#x003b2;-globin locus were readily identified in both untreated and transcriptionally inhibited fetal liver cells. They were absent from fetal brain cells, in line with them being erythroid-specific hypersensitive sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001661-g006">Figure 6D</xref>).

More generally speaking, ChIP, 3C and 4C all measure steady state levels in a cell population and a severe drop in the levels of chromatin-associated RNAPII as measured by ChIP is expected to result in reduced DNA:DNA interaction frequencies as measured by 3C and 4C, if such interactions were mediated by RNAPII.

This reinforces the idea that these (erythroid specific) transcription factors, probably in complex with other proteins, are mainly responsible for the stability of the DNA interactions between regulatory elements of the &#x003b2;-globin locus. The regulatory sites of the &#x003b2;-globin and Rad23a locus retain their active chromatin marks and their physical and chemical properties that allow their identification by FAIRE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001661-g005">Figure 5B&#x02013;C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0001661.s006">Figure S3</xref>).</p><p>Our analysis allows the appreciation of three states of the &#x003b2;-globin locus (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0001661-t001">Table 1</xref>). First, in fetal brain cells a developmental program transcriptionally inactivates the &#x003b2;-globin locus. In these cells the &#x003b2;-globin locus has an inactive chromatin state associated with transcriptionally inactive loci, with no RNAPII bound at regulatory regions. Here, the locus displays long-range chromatin interactions with other transcriptionally silent loci <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001661-Simonis1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>. Second, in fetal liver cells the &#x003b2;-globin locus is transcriptionally highly active, accordingly has an active chromatin state associated with transcriptionally active regions and RNAPII is highly enriched at regulatory regions. Here, the locus interacts with other transcriptionally active loci <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001661-Simonis1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>. Third, in &#x003b1;-amanitin treated fetal liver cells, the &#x003b2;-globin locus is transcriptionally silenced and RNAPII is largely evicted from the gene body and the regulatory regions. The locus retains its overall active chromatin profile though and it interacts with the same regions that are contacted by the highly transcribed &#x003b2;-globin locus (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0001661-t001">Table 1</xref>).</p><table-wrap id="pone-0001661-t001" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0001661.t001</object-id><label>Table 1</label><caption><title>Observed states of the &#x003b2;-globin locus</title></caption><graphic id="pone-0001661-t001-1" xlink:href="pone.0001661.t001"/><table frame="hsides" rules="groups" alternate-form-of="pone-0001661-t001-1"><colgroup span="1"><col align="left" span="1"/><col align="center" span="1"/><col align="center" span="1"/><col align="center" span="1"/><col align="center" span="1"/></colgroup><thead><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Cell type</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Transcription<xref ref-type="table-fn" rid="nt101">a</xref></td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">RNAPII<xref ref-type="table-fn" rid="nt102">b</xref></td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Chromatin state<xref ref-type="table-fn" rid="nt103">c</xref></td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Long-range interactions<xref ref-type="table-fn" rid="nt104">d</xref></td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Fetal Brain</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02212;</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02212;</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">inactive</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">inactive loci <xref ref-type="table-fn" rid="nt105">e</xref></td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Fetal Liver</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x0002b;&#x0002b;</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x0002b;&#x0002b;</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">active</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">active loci <xref ref-type="table-fn" rid="nt105">e</xref></td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Fetal Liver&#x0002b;&#x003b1;-amanitin</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02212;</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02212;/&#x0002b;</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">active</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x0201c;active loci&#x0201d;</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><fn id="nt101"><label>a</label><p>Transcriptional activity of the &#x003b2;-globin locus.</p></fn><fn id="nt102"><label>b</label><p>presence of RNAPII at regulatory sites of the &#x003b2;-globin locus as determined by ChIP.</p></fn><fn id="nt103"><label>c</label><p>as judged by the presence of acetylated histone H3 at regulatory sites of the &#x003b2;-globin locus as determined by ChIP and/or nucleosome occupancy as determined by FAIRE.</p></fn><fn id="nt104"><label>d</label><p>Activity of loci found to be interacting with the &#x003b2;-globin locus. &#x0201c;active loci&#x0201d; refers to the same subset of loci found to be active in fetal liver cells but now inactive due to &#x003b1;-amanitin treatment.</p></fn><fn id="nt105"><label>e</label><p>see ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001661-Simonis1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref> for details.</p></fn></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap><p>Previous studies suggested a role for chromatin modifications in large-scale movement of loci away from heterochromatic regions and the subsequent changes in transcription and replication timing in the human &#x003b2;-globin locus <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001661-Schubeler1">&#x0005b;47&#x0005d;</xref> and the CFTR locus <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001661-Englmann1">&#x0005b;48&#x0005d;</xref>.

Raw data is available in the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database under accession number GSE10170. 4C data analysis and Array design were performed as described before except that hybridization with differentially labeled genomic DNA was omitted. Each array was hybridized with two independently processed experimental samples labeled with alternate dye orientations.

Results shown are based on a window size of 29 probes (on average 60 kb) and were compared with the running mean performed across randomized data. This was done for each array separately. Consequently, all measurements were judged relative to the amplitude and noise of that specific array. We determined the correlation between long-range interactions of the &#x003b2;-globin locus in cultured fetal liver cells and previous data obtained for HS2 in freshly dissected fetal liver cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001661-Simonis1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>. Correlation was high (&#x003c4;&#x02245;0.5; Spearman's rank correlation) demonstrating that culturing of erythroid cells does not drastically influence the interactions of the &#x003b2;-globin locus with distal regions.

Fixed tissue blocks were immersed in 2.3 M sucrose for 20 min at room temperature (18&#x02013;24&#x000b0;C), mounted on a specimen holder and snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen. Tissue blocks were stored in liquid nitrogen until sectioning. Ultrathin cryosections of approximately 200 nm were cut using a Reichert Ultramicrotome E equipped with a cryo-attachment (Leica). For hybridization, sections were washed with PBS to remove sucrose, treated with 250 ng/ml RNase in 2&#x000d7; SSC for 1 h at 37&#x000b0;C, incubated for 10 min in 0.1 M HCl, dehydrated in a series of ethanol washes and denatured for 8 min at 80&#x000b0;C in 70&#x00025; formamide/2&#x000d7; SSC, pH 7.5.
