The concentration of epidermal growth factor (EGF), a modulator of ion channels, in the body is highest in prostatic fluid. Thus, EGF could be involved in the VGSC upregulation in PCa. The effects of EGF on VGSC expression in the highly metastatic human PCa PC-3M cell line, which was shown previously to express both functional VGSCs and EGF receptors, were investigated. A quantitative approach, from gene level to cell behaviour, was used. mRNA levels were determined by real-time PCR.

A novel 'neuroscience' approach to understanding the pathophysiology of PCa suggested that upregulation of voltage-gated Na<sup>+ </sup>channels (VGSCs) could be an accelerating factor in metastatic disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Thus, we have shown previously that functional VGSC expression could distinguish strongly and weakly metastatic human and rat PCa cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. Importantly, application of tetrodotoxin (TTX), a highly specific blocker of VGSCs, suggested that VGSC activity could directly enhance metastatic ability by potentiating a range of <italic>in vitro </italic>cellular behaviours integral to the metastatic cascade: morphological enhancement [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>], directional motility [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>], secretory membrane activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>], adhesion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>], gene expression, including auto-regulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>] and invasion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. In fact, over-expression of VGSC alone was found to be "necessary and sufficient" to confer invasive potential on non-metastatic human PCa cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>].</p><p>The catalytic/pore-forming VGSC &#x003b1;- subunit (VGSC&#x003b1;) responsible for the functional activity was found to be Nav1.7, upregulated at mRNA level by &#x0003e; 1000-fold in strongly vs weakly metastatic rat and human PCa cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Furthermore, VGSC&#x003b1; protein and Nav1.7 mRNA expression were also markedly up-regulated in human PCa <italic>in vivo </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. In fact, analysis of "receiver- operator characteristics" suggested that Nav1.7 could serve as an effective functional diagnostic marker for PCa [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>].</p><p>However, the mechanism(s) responsible for the functional VGSC expression in metastatic PCa is not known. VGSCs have been found to be regulated by growth factors, such as fibroblast growth factor (FGF), nerve growth factor (NGF), epidermal growth factor (EGF), in various human and rat cell lines, such as pheochromocytoma PC12 cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>] and rat PCa Mat-LyLu cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. On another front, it has also been emphasised that growth factors could play <bold>a </bold>major role in progression of human PCa [e.g. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]]. Moreover, increased EGF expression also has been confirmed in human PCa <italic>in vivo </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. Thus, there is the following possible triangular relationship (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>) and EGF could be responsible for the VGSC upregulation in PCa. This possibility has been tested in the present study using the strongly metastatic human prostate epithelial PC-3M cell model which expresses both functional VGSCs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>] and EGF receptors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>].</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>The possible triangular relationship between EGF, VGSC and PCa.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1476-4598-6-76-1"/></fig></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The overall approach was as follows: 1) Effects of exogenous EGF on PC-3M metastatic cell behaviours (MCBs) were tested; (2) possible involvement of VGSC activity in the EGF-induced effects was determined; and (3) the level (mRNA or protein) at which such VGSC involvement could occur was elucidated. The results obtained are described below hierarchically, from functional to molecular aspects.</p><sec><title>Effects of EGF on <italic>in vitro </italic>metastatic cell behaviours</title><p>Exogenous EGF (1&#x02013;100 ng/ml) significantly increased transverse migration of PC-3M cells in a dose dependent manner (p &#x0003c; 0.05 for all concentrations; n = 9; Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>). The greatest effect was seen for 50 ng/ml EGF, which increased migration by 39 &#x000b1; 1.2 % (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref> &#x00026;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>). In most of the experiments that followed, working concentrations of EGF around this peak (i.e., 20, 50 or 100 ng/ml) were used. In endocytosis assays, treatment with EGF (20 ng/ml) enhanced HRP uptake by 23 &#x000b1; 5.4 % (p = 0.01; n = 9; Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2C</xref>). This effect was also concentration dependent (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2D</xref>). Interestingly, in both assays, increasing the EGF concentration ultimately produced reduced effects (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref> &#x00026;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2D</xref>). In Boyden chamber invasion assays, EGF (100 ng/ml) increased the cells' invasiveness by 20 &#x000b1; 5.2 % (p &#x0003c; 0.03 cf. control; n = 4; Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2E</xref>). Application of 100 nM AG1478, an inhibitor of EGF receptor, alone had the opposite effect, reducing cell invasion by 19 &#x000b1; 5.4 % (p = 0.02, n = 4; Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2E</xref>). This result suggested that the potentiating effect of EGF on MCBs also occurred endogenously.</p><fig position="float" id="F2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p>Functional evidence for EGF-induced enhancement of metastatic cell behaviours via VGSC expression/activity in PC-3M cells.

Importantly, TTX when co-applied substantially blocked the enhancement effects of exogenous EGF (20 &#x02013; 100 ng/ml) in all 3 assays (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A, C</xref> &#x00026;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2E</xref>). In the case of migration and endocytosis, there was a strong blocking effect of TTX on the EGF-induced enhancement; thus, for TTX vs EGF + TTX, P = 0.23 (migration) and P = 0.12 (endocytosis), ie EGF had no effect in the presence of TTX. Essentially the same effect was observed for invasion (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2E</xref>), although the difference in the values of InvI for TTX and EGF + TTX was only just not significant (P = 0.051).

As regards therapy, whilst androgen ablation works for a few years, hormone resistance ultimately sets in and this may coincide with PCa progression becoming dependent on growth factor signalling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. A key such growth factor may be EGF which has a well known role in embryogenesis, cellular differentiation, proliferation and angiogenesis. A high level of EGF immunoreactivity has been shown in normal rat prostate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>] and this may be controlled by androgen [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. Androgen receptor can interact with EGFR signalling and this can regulate invasiveness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. In fact, the highest concentration of EGF in body (~175 ng/ml) occurs in prostate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>], comparable to the concentrations used in the present study. Upregulation of EGF/EGFR expression has been reported in metastatic PCa [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>].

At present, the signalling cascades responsible for the observed transcriptional upregulation of VGSC in PC-3M cells is not known. There are 4 main transduction mechanism(s) associated with EGFR signalling: Stat, PLC&#x003b3;, PI3K and MAPK [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. It is possible that VGSC expression/activity was controlled at a variety of levels from transcription to post-translation, including mRNA stability and phosphorylation by PKC or PKA [e.g. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]]. Further work is required to elucidate these aspects.</p><p>Although blocking VGSC activity with TTX suppressed EGF-induced enhancement of endocytosis and migration, the statistical analysis suggested that the involvement of VGSC in invasion was somewhat less. It is highly likely, in fact, that EGF would have parallel affects upon other functional cellular components involved in metastatic behaviour, including actin cytoskeleton [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>], focal adhesion kinase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>] and Ca<sup>2+ </sup>signalling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. A similar conclusion was reached from a similar study on rat PCa cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>].</p><p>VGSC expression in PC-3M cells was also under auto-regulation by activity-dependent positive feed-back, such that blocking channel activity with TTX for 24 h would down-regulate its expression in plasma membrane. Such a mechanism was shown to occur in analogous strong metastatic rat PCa Mat-LyLu cells and involved PKA activated by the Na<sup>+ </sup>influx occurring via active VGSCs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. The present study showed that a comparable feed-back mechanism also operates in human PCa cells, although it is not known if this also involves PKA as an intermediary. This auto-regulatory mechanism is robust and, if blocked, the up-regulatory effect of EGF was lost. It would follow, therefore, that EGF and VGSC are inter-connected in the regulation of functional VGSC expression and control of MCBs.</p></sec><sec><title>Possible role of other growth factors and VGSC association in PCa</title><p>A number of other growth factors have also been associated with metastatic PCa. These include NGF [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>], FGF [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>], transforming growth factor-beta [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>], vascular endothelial growth factor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>] and hepatocyte growth factor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>]. Some of these growth factors have also been shown to regulate VGSC activity e.g. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>]. The case of NGF is interesting since its concentration outside the nervous system is highest in the prostate. NGF was shown previously also to induce upregulation of VGSC expression/activity in PC12 cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>], frog sympathetic B neurons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>], human astrocytoma cell lines (1321N1 and A172) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>] and rat PCa Mat-LyLu cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Importantly, however, although NGF also potentiated MCBs in Mat-LyLu cells, this did not occur via VGSC activity. It would seem, therefore, that the multitude of growth factors that occur in prostate may contribute to metastatic disease in different ways; this is likely to be a dynamic process and may be compartmentalised.</p></sec><sec><title>EGF &#x02013; VGSC interactions in PCa</title><p>Taking the available evidence, including the results of the present study together, a scheme of dual regulation VGSC expression/activity by EGF and feed-back can be considered for metastatic PCa, modelled here by PC-3M cells. In the main part, EGF is tonically released from PCa cells, consistent with the effect of AG1478 alone, also, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>]. This would upregulate VGSC expression/activity, thus potentiating MCBs. VGSC activity enhances secretory membrane activity in PCa cells, as indicated by the results of the endocytosis assays (also [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]). If VGSC activity controlled the release of EGF (eg via vesicular trafficking), it could lead to the following positive feed-back: VGSC activity &#x02192; EGF release &#x02192; VGSC upregulation etc. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>]. In a further loop, VGSC activity auto-regulates itself also by positive feed-back, as detailed previously for analogous rat PCa cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. It is possible, in fact, that the two loops 'overlap' to some extent, and PKA may be a common factor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>]. Importantly, under conditions when VGSC activity was blocked, upregulation of VGSC protein expression (total or in plasma membrane) by EGF was not seen. It would follow, therefore that VGSC expression/activity is a key gate in progression of EGF-dependent (androgen-independent?) PCa. Accordingly, the metastatic process in PCa would be accelerated significantly by the two positive feed-back mechanisms (up)regulating VGSC expression. Further fine-tuning of this control mechanism may occur via interactions within the EGF system itself whereby, for example, EGF can control EGFR expression and vice versa, in autocrine fashion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>].</p><p>The present study highlighted further the potential of VGSC (Nav1.7) in clinical management of PCa [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>]. We have shown previously that Nav1.7 expression has sufficient sensitivity and selectivity to be an effective diagnostic marker for metastatic PCa [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. In fact, the biology of the VGSC (in being upregulated by growth factors, such as EGF, and enhancing various MCBs) is consistent with it being an early event in progression of PCa to metastasis. Suppression of VGSC activity directly using channel blockers, therefore, could have therapeutic potential. Indeed, VGSC-blocking anti-convulsant drugs have been shown to be cytostatic inhibitors of PCa [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>]. The present work also raises the possibility of developing additionally effective combination therapy, aimed at concurrent blockage of VGSC activity and EGF signalling.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>The main conclusion is that EGF has a major involvement in the upregulation of functional VGSC expression in PC-3M human PCa cells. In turn, VGSC activity enhances the cells' <italic>in vitro </italic>migration, endocytosis and invasion. The effect of EGF is transcriptional, at least in part, and the <italic>de novo </italic>protein produced is largely targeted to the plasma membrane. VGSC expression is also under auto-regulation by activity-dependent positive feed-back. Thus, VGSC expression/activity could be a major intermediary of the potentiating effect of EGF in human PCa.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Cell culture and pharmacological treatments</title><p>PC-3M cells were maintained in RPMI medium (without phenol red) supplemented with 10 % foetal bovine serum (FBS) and 1 % L-glutamine, in a humidified 37&#x000b0;C incubator with 5 % CO<sub>2 </sub>. Prior to any pharmacological treatment, cells were first 'conditioned' in 0.5 % FBS for 24 h. 0.5 % FBS was determined as a optimum by testing the effect of a range of FBS concentrations on cell viability (data not shown). Cells were then incubated in one of the following: (1) EGF; (2) TTX; (3) EGF+TTX; (4) AG1478; an inhibitor of EGF receptor tyrosine kinase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">53</xref>] or (5) EGF+AG1478. All pharmacological agents were applied in 0.5 % FBS for 24 h.</p></sec><sec><title><italic>In vitro </italic>metastatic cell behaviour assays</title><p>Initial 3-(4,5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assays showed that there was no proliferative effect of any of the pharmacological agents at their working concentrations. Lack of effect of EGF on proliferation of PCa cells has also been reported before [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">54</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B56">56</xref>]. Also, none of the treatments had any effect on cell viability, monitored using trypan blue staining. Three different assays of <italic>in vitro </italic>metastatic cell behaviour (MCB) were carried out, as follows:</p><p>1. <italic>Transwell migration</italic>. Details of this assay were described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B57">57</xref>]. Essentially, conditioned cells seeded in multi-well dishes were pharmacologically treated and then re-suspended using trypsin-EDTA and plated at a density of 20 &#x000d7; 10<sup>4 </sup>cells/well onto 12 &#x003bc;m pore Transwell filters with polycarbon membrane (Corning, MA, USA). Following 6 h incubation, MTT was used to determine the number of migrated cells. These measurements were plotted as the percentage (%) of the readings for migrated cells/original cell number, giving "Migration Index (MiI)".</p><p>2. <italic>Endocytic membrane activity</italic>. This followed the procedure originally described by Onganer and Djamgoz [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B58">58</xref>]. Briefly, cells were seeded in multi-well dishes at a density of 5 &#x000d7; 10<sup>4 </sup>cells/well in normal medium. Endocytosis was measured by optimised (0.5 mg/ml for 40 min) uptake of horseradish peroxidase (HRP type IV; Sigma). Endogeneous peroxidase activity was measured in parallel in every experiment and subtracted from the uptake. The difference in the optical densities was assumed to represent true endocytosis and plotted as the percentage of the control level in untreated cells, giving "Endocytosis Index, EI (%)".</p><p>3. <italic>Matrigel invasion</italic>. Boyden invasion chambers with 8 &#x003bc;m pore size inserts pre-coated with Matrigel basement membrane matrix were used in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions (BD BioSciences, MA, USA) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B57">57</xref>]. Cells were plated at a density 7.5 &#x000d7; 10<sup>4 </sup>/well and each treatment was repeated three times.

Protein yield was determined by spectrophotometry. The primary antibody was a pan-VGSC (Upstate Biotechnology, Buckingham, UK). The secondary antibody was a peroxidase-conjugated swine anti-rabbit immunoglobulin (DAKO, Glostrup, Denmark). The nitrocellulose membrane was stripped and treated with an anti-actinin antibody (Sigma, UK) as a loading control. For the latter, the secondary antibody was peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse immunoglobulin (DAKO, Glostrup, Denmark). The amount of protein loaded has been specified in given figure legends. Optical density of the gels for all the treatments was calculated using by Image-Pro Plus software (Media Cybernetics).</p></sec><sec><title>Cell surface biotinylation</title><p>Following pharmacological treatment, cells were washed three times with cold PBS. Live cells were incubated for 2 h with 1 mg/ml EZ-Link Sulfo-NHS-Biotin (Pierce, IL, USA) at 4&#x000b0;C. After washing with PBS containing 10 mM glycine, total cell protein was extracted, as before. One-half of the extracted protein was kept at -20&#x000b0;C for Western blots. The other half was labelled with streptavidin beads for 1 h.

Total and streptavin-labelled proteins were subject to Western blots, as described above.</p></sec><sec><title>Immunocytochemistry and digital image analysis</title><p>Control or treated cells (2 &#x000d7; 10<sup>4</sup>) were seeded onto13 mm sterile coverslips (BHD, Poole, UK) pre-coated with poly-L-lysine in 24 well plates and fixed in 4 % PFA for 15 min. After washing (3 &#x000d7; 5 min with 0.1 % BSA in PBS; pH 7.4), plasma membranes were stained with concanavalin A for 45 min [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. After further washing (&#x000d7;3), cells were permeabilised with 0.1 % saponin for 3 min, washed and blocked with 5 % BSA in PBS for 1 h at room temperature. The primary antibody, pan-VGSC&#x003b1; (Upstate Biotechnology, Buckingham, UK), diluted in 5 % BSA in PBS to the working concentration (1 &#x003bc;g/100 &#x003bc;l), was applied for 1 h at room temperature in a moist chamber and then washed off. The secondary antibody (a peroxidase-conjugated swine anti-rabbit immunoglobulin; DAKO, Glostrup, Denmark) and Alexaflour 568 were applied for 1 h at room temperature and then washed off. Finally, cells were washed in distilled H<sub>2</sub>O and mounted with anti-fading medium, Vectashield (Vector, Burlingame, USA). Cells were examined by confocal microscopy (Leica DM IRBE). Exposures and optical sectioning were identical for all the treatments.</p><p>VGSC protein expression in plasma membrane was quantified as the mean optical intensity of immunoreactivity of permeabilized cell outlines, calculated using the "freeform line profile" function (Lecia confocal software LCS Lite; version 2.00) drawn around the cell surface, determined by concanavalin A staining. Randomly chosen 50 cells (from 3 repeats in each experiment) were analysed. The subcellular distribution of VGSC protein was determined using the "straight line profile" function drawn across the cytoplasm avoiding the nucleus, as described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Digitised optical density in plasma membrane region, set to cover 1.5 &#x003bc;m inward from the edge of concanavalin A staining, was compared with cytoplasmic signal density within the central 30 % of the line profile.
