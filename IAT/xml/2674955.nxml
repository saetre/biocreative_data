Profusion proteins, such as the dynamin-related protein mitofusins 1 and 2 (Mfn1 and Mfn2), are integral components of the outer mitochondrial membrane (OMM), essential to mitochondria tethering and fusion <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005471-Chen1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005471-Rojo1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>.

Conversely, the dynamin-related protein 1 (Drp1/DNM1) is a cytosolic protein, recruitment of which to the OMM by the anchored fission 1 protein (Fis1p/FIS1) adaptor initiates and controls the fission and distribution of mitochondria in cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005471-Smirnova1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Previously, we identified the Carboxy-Terminal Modulator Protein (CTMP) in a two-hybrid search for PKB/Akt binding partners <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005471-Maira1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>. CTMP has been shown to inhibit PKB/Akt activation at the plasma membrane in response to various stimuli and also to have tumor suppressor-like functions. This notion was strengthened by the observation that primary glioblastomas exhibit downregulation of CTMP mRNA levels due to promoter hypermethylation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005471-Knobbe1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>. We recently reported the mitochondrial localization of endogenous and exogenous CTMP <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005471-Parcellier2">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref>. CTMP exhibits a dual sub-mitochondrial localization as a membrane-bound pool and a free pool of mature CTMP in the inter-membrane space; it was released from the mitochondria into the cytosol early during apoptosis. CTMP overexpression was associated with an increase in mitochondrial membrane depolarization, caspase-3 and polyADP-ribose polymerase (PARP) cleavage. In contrast, CTMP knockdown resulted in a marked reduction in the loss of mitochondrial membrane potential as well as a decrease in caspase-3 and PARP activation. Mutant CTMP retained in the mitochondria lost its capacity to sensitize cells to apoptosis. Thus, proper maturation of CTMP appears essential for its pro-apoptotic function. Finally, we demonstrated that CTMP delayed PKB/Akt phosphorylation following cell death induction, suggesting that CTMP regulates apoptosis via inhibition of PKB/Akt.</p><p>Here we show that compromising Carboxy-Terminal Modulator Protein (CTMP) integrity by preventing its N-terminal cleavage by point mutation or by a knockdown approach affected mitochondrial network organization in cells. CTMP depletion did not affect mitochondria intercomplementation but enhanced the interconnected network, suggesting that CTMP positively influences the mitochondrial fission process, arguing for a potential role of CTMP in regulating mitochondrial functions.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>A defect in N terminal cleavage of CTMP expression leads to swollen mitochondria</title><p>HeLa cells transfected with full-length CTMP GFP-tagged expressed CTMP in the mitochondria (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005471-g001">Fig. 1A</xref>).

We have shown that interference with CTMP expression and/or protein maturation critically affected mitochondria morphology. Loss of cellular CTMP expression led to the establishment of an interconnected mitochondrial network in 40&#x00025; of cells without affecting cell viability (data not shown). Furthermore, CTMP knockdown appeared to have a second long-term effect leading to the accumulation of swollen mitochondria, either interconnected or tubular. Importantly, such a phenotype has been reported previously in cells depleted for proteins involved in the regulation of the mitochondrial fission process, such as Drp1 or the recently identified Drp1-binding protein MARCH-5 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005471-Jagasia1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005471-Nakamura1">&#x0005b;28&#x0005d;</xref>. Mitochondria from CTMP knockdown cells efficiently fuse <italic>in vitro</italic>, suggesting that the observed phenotype, presumably caused by imbalanced fusion/fission, does not result from a dysfunction in mitochondrial fusion. Indeed, we provide evidence that CTMP function in mitochondria is tightly linked to its submitochondrial distribution, where it is found in both soluble and membrane-bound mitochondrial fractions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005471-Parcellier2">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref>. Expression of a non-cleavable mutant of CTMP (refractory to mitochondrial membrane peptidase cleavage) in HeLa cells promoted dissociation of the mitochondrial network into individual round-shaped, dilated mitochondria.</p><p>We recently reported that CTMP is released early from mitochondria into the cytosol upon apoptosis and we demonstrated that CTMP overexpression is associated with an increase in mitochondrial membrane depolarization and the activation of apoptotic markers such as caspase-3 and PARP. Furthermore, we observed that CTMP depletion or a defect in CTMP maturation leads to inhibition of apoptosis. We suggested that CTMP regulates apoptosis via PKB/Akt inhibition since we detected a delay in PKB/Akt phosphorylation in cells overexpressing CTMP in which apoptosis was induced <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005471-Parcellier2">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref>. Similarly, other recent reports suggest that the regulation of OPA1 relies on the activity of a presenilin-associated rhomboid-like protein (PARL), a protease that regulates OPA1 release into the inner mitochondrial space <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005471-Frezza1">&#x0005b;29&#x0005d;</xref>. Furthermore, Cipolat et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005471-Cipolat1">&#x0005b;30&#x0005d;</xref> suggested that the loss of this soluble OPA1 species in PARL&#x02212;/&#x02212; cells is responsible for their extreme sensitivity to apoptotic stimuli. They further proposed a complex mechanism by which both soluble and inner mitochondrial membrane-anchored OPA1 regulates the tight closure of the mitochondria cristae, preventing massive release of cytochrome c into the inter-mitochondrial space.</p><p>Taken together, these observations lead us to hypothesize that accumulation of a premature form of CTMP in the inner mitochondrial membrane (due to inhibition of mitochondrial membrane peptidase cleavage) may be responsible for the observed mitochondrial phenotype. Moreover, <italic>in vitro</italic> characterization of the molecular mechanisms regulating inner mitochondrial membrane dynamics are as yet poorly understood. Surprisingly, a subtle abnormal mitochondrial phenotype in the brain tissue of PKB/Akt knockout mice has been reported recently <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005471-Wright1">&#x0005b;31&#x0005d;</xref>. These animals display fewer and larger mitochondrial structures, and the authors suggest that PKB/Akt plays a significant role in mitochondrial biogenesis. In addition, PKB/Akt has been shown to translocate to the outer mitochondrial membrane, following plasma membrane activation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005471-Andjelkovic1">&#x0005b;32&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005471-Sasaki1">&#x0005b;34&#x0005d;</xref>. Although the biological significance of the translocation of active PKB/Akt to the mitochondria is not yet clear, it has been reported to be cell-type and stimulus-specific <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005471-Ahmad1">&#x0005b;35&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005471-Bijur1">&#x0005b;36&#x0005d;</xref>. Thus, CTMP may modulate PKB/Akt activity in a specific subcellular compartment, e.g. the mitochondria or the cytosol, depending on the nature of the stimulus (survival or apoptosis). Further investigation is needed to integrate the direct and/or indirect modulation of PKB/Akt activity in this model and more experiments will be required to address the biological activity of CTMP.</p><p>Striking similarities exist between the mitochondria network rearrangement observed in CTMP knockdown cells and those already reported in cells knocked down for the Drp1 fission protein or cells missing a functional OPA1 protein <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005471-Jagasia1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005471-Frezza1">&#x0005b;29&#x0005d;</xref>. Nonetheless, the loss of electron absorbance observed in CTMP knockout mice liver mitochondria further supports the involvement of CTMP in the maintenance of inner mitochondrial membrane integrity. Thus, the phenotype observed following CTMP depletion with respect to mitochondrial network rearrangements is less penetrant than those already reported for the key mitochondria-shaping proteins. Moreover, CTMP protein depletion did not affect HeLa cell growth or mitochondrial transmembrane potential measured <italic>in vitro</italic> (data not shown). Most interestingly, it has been shown that CTMP interacts with LETM1, another mitochondrial protein involved in mitochondrial morphology <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005471-Piao1">&#x0005b;37&#x0005d;</xref>. LETM1 is located in the inner membrane of mitochondria and oligomerized in higher molecular weight complexes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005471-Dimmer1">&#x0005b;38&#x0005d;</xref>. LETM1 has been found to be deleted in Wolf-Hirschorn syndrome (WHS), a complex congenital syndrome characterized by microcephaly, growth and mental retardation, seizures, epilepsy and other associated symptoms <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005471-Bergemann1">&#x0005b;39&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005471-Zollino1">&#x0005b;40&#x0005d;</xref>. LETM1 is considered as playing a major role in the pathogenesis of seizures. The function of LETM1 in apoptosis, mitochondrial homeostasis and mitochondrial dynamics is well documented, although the different reports drew different conclusions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005471-Piao1">&#x0005b;37&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005471-Dimmer1">&#x0005b;38&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005471-Tamai1">&#x0005b;41&#x0005d;</xref>. Thus, it will be very exciting to further investigate the interplay between CTMP and LETM1 in regulating mitochondrial dynamics and functions in future studies. In particular, it would be of interest to explore the phenotype of CTMP knockout mice in the context of Wolf-Hirschorn syndrome.</p><p>It is plausible that CTMP mediates its effect by modulating the activity of the key regulators of mitochondrial dynamics and further experiments should address the biological mechanism by which CTMP regulates mitochondrial functions. We have demonstrated already that CTMP exhibits a dual submitochondrial localization. Therefore, the tight association between CTMP protein integrity and maintenance of mitochondria shape observed in this study provides a novel opportunity to investigate the mitochondrial function of CTMP in metabolic regulation.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Cloning and plasmids construction</title><p>All CTMP untagged plasmids used in this study were constructed following PCR amplification of hCTMP cDNA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005471-Maira1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref> and inserted into the <italic>Bam</italic>HI and <italic>Eco</italic>RI sites of the pcDNA4-IRES-GFP plasmid <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005471-Tintignac1">&#x0005b;42&#x0005d;</xref>.
