Increasing evidence suggests that similar to its counterpart, Sir2, in yeast, <italic>Caenorhabditis</italic><italic>elegans</italic>, and <italic>Drosophila</italic><italic>melanogaster</italic>, SIRT1 may function to regulate life span in mammals. However, SIRT1's role in cancer is unclear. During our investigation of SIRT1, we found that c-Myc binds to the SIRT1 promoter and induces SIRT1 expression. However, SIRT1 interacts with and deacetylates c-Myc, resulting in decreased c-Myc stability. As a consequence, c-Myc's transformational capability is compromised in the presence of SIRT1. Overall, our experiments identify a c-Myc&#x02013;SIRT1 feedback loop in the regulation of c-Myc activity and cellular transformation, supporting/suggesting a role of SIRT1 in tumor suppression.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p>The Sir2 protein deacetylase has emerged as an important regulator of aging in yeast, <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic>, and <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Guarente and Picard, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Longo and Kennedy, 2006</xref>). The conserved role of Sir2 in extending life span in lower organisms raises the possibility that the mammalian orthologue of Sir2 may also play a similar role. In mammals, there are seven homologues of Sir2, SIRT1&#x02013;7, of which SIRT1 is most similar to the yeast Sir2 and is considered to be the orthologue of yeast Sir2. SIRT1 has been shown to regulate multiple cellular functions, including cellular stress response, cell differentiation, development, and metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Michan and Sinclair, 2007</xref>). Activators of SIRT1 improve cellular mitochondria function and protect mice from metabolic diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Baur et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Lagouge et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Milne et al., 2007</xref>). Furthermore, SIRT1 transgenic mice also display beneficial phenotypes similar to mice on a calorie-restricted diet (leaner and more metabolically active; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bordone et al., 2007</xref>), supporting an antiaging role of SIRT1.</p><p>Recent studies also revealed a paradoxical role of SIRT1 in tumorigenesis, possibly as a result of SIRT1's inhibitory effect toward tumor suppressors such as p53. Inhibition of SIRT1 by small molecule inhibitors or down-regulation of SIRT1 by siRNA results in arrested cell growth and apoptosis in several tumor cell lines, including breast, lung, and colon cancer lines, suggesting a role for SIRT1 in tumor cell growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Ford et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Heltweg et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Ota et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Lain et al., 2008</xref>). In addition, inhibition of SIRT1 results in reactivation of tumor suppressor gene transcription in human breast and colon cancer lines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Pruitt et al., 2006</xref>), suggesting a role for SIRT1 in silencing tumor suppressor genes. Together, these studies suggest a possible role of SIRT1 in promoting tumorigenesis. However, recent work with SIRT1 transgenic and knockout mice also suggests a role for SIRT1 in tumor suppression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Firestein et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Wang et al., 2008</xref>). Therefore, the biological effects of SIRT1 are complex. In this study, we show that c-Myc and SIRT1 form a negative feedback loop that inhibits c-Myc&#x02013;induced cellular transformation. These results support a tumor suppression function of SIRT1.</p></sec><sec><title>Results and discussion</title><p>During our investigation of SIRT1 regulation, we found that there are three potential c-Myc&#x02013;binding sites (E-box) localized at the SIRT1 promoter. This finding led us to hypothesize that c-Myc may regulate SIRT1 expression. Indeed, overexpression of c-Myc increased SIRT1 expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 a</xref>). However, down-regulation of c-Myc decreased SIRT1 expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 b</xref>). Furthermore, SIRT1 expression is higher in c-Myc&#x02013;proficient fibroblasts (TGR and Myc3) than that of Myc-deficient cells (HO15; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 c</xref>). These results suggest that c-Myc may act to enhance SIRT1 expression. To investigate whether c-Myc regulates SIRT1 expression at the transcriptional level, we performed quantitative RT-PCR (QRT-PCR) of SIRT1 transcripts. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 d</xref>, there were more SIRT1 transcripts in c-Myc&#x02013;proficient cells than those of c-Myc&#x02013;deficient cells, suggesting that c-Myc induces SIRT1 transcription. Finally, to directly demonstrate that c-Myc binds at the SIRT1 promoter, we performed chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays using anti&#x02013;c-Myc antibodies. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 e</xref>, Myc binds one E-box (E1) but not other E-boxes (E2 and E3) of the SIRT1 promoter. Overall, our results suggest that c-Myc promotes SIRT1 expression by elevating SIRT1 transcription.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p><bold>c-Myc induces SIRT1 expression.</bold> (a) Control vector or constructs encoding Flag&#x02013;c-Myc were transfected into 293T cells. 48 h later, cell lysates were examined by Western blotting.

To confirm the specificity of this interaction, we used SIRT1 siRNA to down-regulate SIRT1. c-Myc failed to coimmunoprecipitate with SIRT1 in cells transfected with SIRT1 siRNA <bold>(</bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 a</xref>), confirming the specificity of the c-Myc&#x02013;SIRT1 interaction. Furthermore, immunoprecipitation of c-Myc also pulled down SIRT1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 b</xref>). To examine whether the SIRT1&#x02013;c-Myc interaction is direct, we incubated purified c-Myc and SIRT1 under cell-free conditions and found that SIRT1 interacts with c-Myc in vitro, suggesting that SIRT1 directly interacts with c-Myc (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 c</xref>).</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><p><bold>SIRT1 interacts with c-Myc and deacetylates c-Myc at K323.</bold> (a and b).

Because SIRT1 is a protein deacetylase, it is possible that SIRT1 could regulate c-Myc activity by deacetylating c-Myc. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 d</xref>, overexpression of wild-type (WT) SIRT1, but not catalytically inactive SIRT1-H363Y, resulted in hypoacetylation of c-Myc. Conversely, down-regulation of SIRT1 using SIRT1 siRNA resulted in c-Myc hyperacetylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 e</xref>). Finally, SIRT1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> cells showed that c-Myc hyperacetylation compared with SIRT1<sup>+/+</sup> cells; reconstitution of SIRT1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> cells with WT SIRT1, but not inactive SIRT1-H363Y, decreased c-Myc acetylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 f</xref>). These results suggest that SIRT1 deacetylates c-Myc in cells.</p><p>We further explored potential SIRT1 deacetylation sites of c-Myc. Previous studies have identified several potential acetylation sites of c-Myc (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Patel et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Faiola et al., 2005</xref>). We found that Lys323 (K323) is a major SIRT1 deacetylation site because overexpression of SIRT1 was unable to reduce c-MycK323R acetylation as it was with the WT c-Myc. Thus, although the c-MycK232R mutant is not able to be acetylated, SIRT1 overexpression was not able to reduce the acetylation status of the mutant below that of basal levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 g</xref>). Confirming this result, the loss of SIRT1 did not increase acetylation levels of the K323R mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 h</xref>). These results suggest that K323 of c-Myc is the major SIRT1 deacetylation site.</p><p>c-Myc has previously been shown to be acetylated, which enhances c-Myc stability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Vervoorts et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Patel et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Faiola et al., 2005</xref>). Because SIRT1 deacetylates c-Myc, we hypothesized that SIRT1 affects c-Myc stability. In support of our hypothesis, overexpression of SIRT1 decreased the c-Myc protein level without affecting the c-Myc mRNA level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 a</xref>). Conversely, down-regulation of SIRT1 increased c-Myc expression with no effect on c-Myc transcripts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 b</xref>). To confirm these findings, we used SIRT1<sup>+/+</sup> and SIRT1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 c</xref>, there was increased expression of c-Myc in SIRT1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> cells. Reconstitution of WT SIRT1, but not catalytically inactive SIRT1, decreased c-Myc expression (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200809167/DC1">Fig. S1 a</ext-link>). These results suggest that SIRT1 regulates c-Myc expression at the posttranscriptional level. We next examined whether SIRT1 regulates c-Myc stability in the presence of cycloheximide, which blocks protein translation. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 d</xref>, overexpression of SIRT1 decreased c-Myc stability. Conversely, loss of SIRT1 expression enhanced c-Myc stability (Fig. S1 b). Reconstitution of SIRT1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> cells with WT SIRT1, but not catalytically inactive SIRT1, restored the c-Myc half-life to the level of WT MEFs (Fig. S1 b). These results suggest that SIRT1 negatively regulates c-Myc stability.</p><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><p><bold>SIRT1 decreases c-Myc stability.</bold> (a) The indicated constructs were transfected into 293T cells. 48 h later, proteins and mRNA were extracted and subjected to Western blotting or QRT-PCR.

It is possible that SIRT1 regulates c-Myc stability through FBW7. We used the MycT58A mutant to investigate this possibility. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 e</xref>, MycT58A is more stable than WT c-Myc, which is consistent with previous findings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Welcker et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Yada et al., 2004</xref>). However, SIRT1 still decreased MycT58A stability, suggesting that SIRT1 and FBW7 regulate c-Myc stability through distinct pathways.</p><p>Because we have shown that K323 is a major SIRT1 deacetylation site of c-Myc (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2, g and h</xref>), we further examined whether SIRT1 regulates c-Myc stability through K323. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 e</xref>, MycK323 was less stable than WT c-Myc. Although SIRT1 decreased the stability of WT c-Myc, it had no effect toward MycK323R. These results suggest that SIRT1 regulates c-Myc stability by deacetylating K323.</p><p>We next investigated how SIRT1 affects c-Myc function by examining the expression of c-Myc target genes. We first examined the expression of telomerase reverse transcriptase gene (TERT), which is a direct target gene of c-Myc (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Greenberg et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Wu et al., 1999</xref>). Consistent with its negative regulation of c-Myc, overexpression of SIRT1 decreased TERT expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 a</xref>). However, overexpression of the catalytically inactive SIRT1 mutant SIRT1-H363Y did not affect TERT expression. Furthermore, TERT expression is clearly higher in SIRT1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> cells than that of SIRT1<sup>+/+</sup> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 b</xref>), confirming that SIRT1 negatively regulates TERT expression.</p><fig id="fig4" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><p><bold>SIRT1 inhibits Myc target gene expression through c-Myc.</bold> (a) 293T cells were transfected with the indicated constructs. 48 h later, cells were lysed, and cell lysates were blotted with the indicated antibodies.

We found little expression of TERT in Myc<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> HO15 cells. However, HO15 cells stably reconstituted with c-Myc (Myc3) showed enhanced TERT expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 c</xref>). Importantly, overexpression of WT SIRT1, but not catalytically inactive SIRT1, suppressed TERT expression, suggesting that SIRT1 negatively regulates TERT expression through c-Myc.</p><p>To further confirm the inhibitory effects of SIRT1 toward c-Myc, we also examined the expression of other c-Myc target genes. c-Myc has been shown to activate cyclin B1 expression and suppress Gadd45 and p21 expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adhikary and Eilers, 2005</xref>). We found increased expression of cyclin B1 and decreased expression of Gadd45 and p21 in SIRT1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> cells and cells transfected with SIRT1 siRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4, d and e</xref>). However, overexpression of WT SIRT1, but not catalytically inactive SIRT1, results in decreased cyclin B1 expression and increased Gadd45 and p21 expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 f</xref>).

In addition, Myc has also been shown to regulate cancer cell energy metabolism by inducing genes such as lactate dehydrogenase A (LDHA) and mitochondrial serine hydroxymethyltransferase (mSHMT) expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Shim et al., 1997</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Nikiforov et al., 2002</xref>).

Overall, these results strongly suggest that SIRT1 negatively regulates c-Myc activity.</p><p>The inhibitory effect of SIRT1 on c-Myc raised the possibility that SIRT1 could negatively regulate cell growth and transformation. To specifically examine how SIRT1 affects c-Myc&#x02013;induced cell growth, we used Myc<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> HO15 cells, and HO15 rat fibroblast cells stably reconstituted with c-Myc (Myc3). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5 a</xref>, expression of c-Myc greatly increased colony formation. However, coexpression of WT SIRT1, but not catalytically inactive SIRT1, with c-Myc significantly decreased c-Myc&#x02013;induced colony formation. Furthermore, we performed soft agar assays to examine how SIRT1 affects anchorage-independent cell growth. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5 b</xref>, Myc3 cells displayed anchorage-independent cell growth in soft agar. However, expression of SIRT1 significantly decreased the colony formation in soft agar, whereas catalytically inactive SIRT1 only slightly affected colony formation. These results suggest that SIRT1 inhibits c-Myc&#x02013;dependent cellular transformation. To confirm that SIRT1 suppresses cell growth by deacetylating c-Myc, we used the MycK323R mutant to perform cell growth experiments. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5 c</xref>, although SIRT1 could suppress WT c-Myc and MycT58A-induced cell growth, it had no effect on MycK323R-induced cell growth.

Ac, acetylation.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="JCB_200809167_RGB_Fig5"/></fig><p>Finally, to confirm the role of SIRT1 in suppressing cellular transformation in vivo<italic>,</italic> we stably expressed Ras and SIRT1 in Myc3 cells. Cells were then implanted into athymic nude mice. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5 d</xref> and Fig. S3 b, overexpression of SIRT1 significantly inhibited tumorigenesis in nude mice. Collectively, these results demonstrate a tumor suppression role of SIRT1 in vitro and in vivo.</p><p>In this study, we present evidence that c-Myc induces SIRT1 expression, and SIRT1 in turn deacetylates and down-regulates c-Myc, resulting in decreased c-Myc target gene (i.e., TERT) expression and cellular transformation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5 e</xref>). Consequently, this Myc-SIRT1 negative feedback loop can restrain Myc's transformational activities. Although it has been established that SIRT1 has several important roles in metabolism and cellular stress response, its role in tumorigenesis remains controversial because both pro- and antitumorigenesis effects of SIRT1 have been suggested. It is possible that SIRT1's role in tumorigenesis is context dependent. For example, senescence is important for suppression of tumor initiation; however, it is thought to drive tumor growth by secreting inflammatory factors and tissue-disrupting enzymes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Campisi, 2005</xref>). It is possible that SIRT1 inhibits the initiation of tumor in premalignant cells by inhibiting c-Myc. However, cancer cells could become addicted to SIRT1 as a result of SIRT1's antiapoptosic functions. In support of this notion, inhibition of SIRT1 induces cell cycle arrest and death only in cancer cells but not noncancerous cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Ford et al., 2005</xref>). Therefore, SIRT1 might have both tumor suppression and promotion roles depending on the stage of cell transformation.</p><p>Feedback mechanisms have previously been demonstrated for the regulation of Myc activity. For example, Myc induced expression of ribosomal protein L11, which in turn binds Myc and blocks Myc transcriptional activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Dai et al., 2007</xref>), forming a negative feedback loop. Myc also induces L23 expression, which blocks Miz1 function and p21 and p16 transcription, thereby acting as a positive feedback loop to further potentiate Myc's ability to promote cell growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Wanzel et al., 2008</xref>). We showed that through a negative feedback loop, SIRT1 could decrease the expression of c-Myc target genes (e.g., TERT) and increase expression of tumor suppressors (e.g., p21 and Gadd45). Our results are consistent with previous findings that SIRT1 can limit replicative life span (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chua et al., 2005</xref>) and TERT expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Narala et al., 2008</xref>).</p><p>In addition, through this Myc-SIRT1 feedback loop, SIRT1 could also modulate cells' energy metabolism. It has been established that in addition to regulating cell cycle progression and apoptosis, c-Myc also regulates energy metabolism through the induction of LDHA and mSHMT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Shim et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Nikiforov et al., 2002</xref>), which are important for cellular transformation. We showed that SIRT1 also blocks Myc-mediated expression of LDHA and mSHMT, providing another route by which SIRT1 regulates glucose metabolism in addition to its known role in regulating glucose metabolism. One can also postulate that Myc-induced redox metabolism could change the NAD/NADH ratio, which in turn affects SIRT1 activity. This is another possible feedback mechanism that requires further investigation.</p><p>In summary, our experiments suggest that a c-Myc&#x02013;SIRT1 negative feedback loop suppresses cell growth and transformation. These experiments also provide a rationale using SIRT1 activators as cancer prevention agents in the future.</p></sec><sec sec-type="Materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Cell culture</title><p>HEK293T and HeLa cells were cultured in RPMI with 10% FBS.
