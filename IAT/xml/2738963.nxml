HDACi, such as SAHA/Vorinostat, Trichostatin A, and MS-275 were found to induce apoptosis of leukemic blasts through activation of the death receptor pathway and transcriptional induction of the Tumor Necrosis Factor (TNF)-related pro-apoptotic family members, TRAIL and FasL. The impact of HDACi on TNF-related costimulatory molecules such as 4-1BB ligand (4-1BBL/<italic>TNFSF9</italic>) is however not known. Following exposure to SAHA/Vorinostat, Trichostatin A, and MS-275, transcript levels were determined by real time PCR in Jurkat, Raji and U937 cells. Treatment with HDACi up-regulated <italic>TNFSF9</italic> gene expression in the three leukemia cell lines, yet to different extend and with distinct kinetics, which did not require <italic>de novo</italic> protein synthesis and was not associated with DNAse I hypersensitive chromatin remodeling. Transcriptional activity of <italic>TNFSF9</italic> promoter-luciferase constructs was induced up to 12 fold by HDACi, and implication of Sp1/Sp3 transcription factors binding to functional GC-box elements was evidenced by reporter gene assays, site-directed mutagenesis, and electrophoretic mobility shift assays. Functionality of modulated target genes was assessed in allogeneic mixed leukocyte reaction experiments. MS-275- and to a lesser extent Trichostatin A- and SAHA-treated Raji cells significantly up regulated T lymphocytes proliferation which was reduced by about 50&#x00025; by a 4-1BB blocking recombinant protein, while MS-275- but neither Trichostatin A- nor SAHA-treated cells up-regulated IFN&#x003b3; secretion by T lymphocytes. Our results identify 4-1BBL/4-1BB as a downstream target of HDACi, especially of MS-275 anti-leukemia action <italic>in vitro</italic>. Thus, HDACi such as MS-275 displaying dual TNF-dependent proapoptotic and costimulatory activities might be favored for inclusion in HDACi-based anti-cancer therapeutic strategies.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="14"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Members of the Tumor Necrosis Factor ligands and receptors Superfamily (TNFSF) are both secreted and membrane-bound factors that regulate proliferation, activation, differentiation, maturation and survival or programmed cell death of lymphoid, myeloid and other haematopoietic, as well as various non-haematopoietic cell types <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007085-Hehlgans1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007085-Locksley1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>.

PCR was developed as recommended by the manufacturer. Briefly, 5 &#x000b5;l cDNA (equivalent to 100 ng of total RNA) was mixed with TaqMan Universal Mix (Applied Biosystems) and loaded into 1 sample port. Thermal cycler conditions were as follows: 2 minutes at 50&#x000b0;C, 15 s at 95&#x000b0;C, 60 s at 60&#x000b0;C for 40 cycles. Capture of fluorescence was recorded on the ABI Prism 7900HT scanner, and the C<sub>T</sub> was calculated for each assay using Sequence Detection System Software 2.1 (Applied Biosystems). Normalization of quantitative-PCR assays was conducted using the C<sub>T</sub> value of the <italic>GAPDH</italic> endogenous control.

These oligonucleotides were radiolabeled and tested in electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSA) for DNA&#x02013;protein interactions with nuclear extracts from mock-treated and TSA-treated Jurkat cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007085-g005">Fig. 5B</xref>). Retarded protein&#x02013;DNA complexes were observed using the three distinct GC-box oligonucleotides and TSA treatment did not induce detectable modification of the observed pattern of retarded protein-DNA complexes. To evaluate the sequence specificity of the binding to these GC-boxes, we performed competition EMSAs using different unlabeled double-stranded competitor oligonucleotides (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007085-g005">Fig. 5C</xref>). The specificity of the protein binding was demonstrated because their formation was inhibited by competition with molar excesses of the unlabeled homologous oligonucleotides (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007085-g005">Fig. 5C</xref>, lane 3). In contrast, these complexes were not competed by mutated version of the oligonucleotides (lane 4). Similar results were observed for the three GC-boxes. To identify directly the Sp family members within the retarded complexes, we performed supershift assays using specific antibodies directed against individual members of the Sp family of transcription factors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007085-g005">Fig. 5D</xref>). The wild-type probe was incubated with nuclear extracts from Jurkat cells and polyclonal antibodies directed against Sp1 and/or Sp3 were added to the binding reaction mixture. The Sp1 antibody selectively supershifted the major slower migrating complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007085-g005">Fig. 5D</xref>, lane 3) and the Sp3 antibody resulted in the strong decrease of the faster migrating complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007085-g005">Fig. 5D</xref>, lane 4). We confirmed these results when both the anti-Sp1 and anti-Sp3 antibodies were included in the same binding reaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007085-g005">Fig. 5D</xref>, lane 5). In contrast, the binding pattern was not affected by the addition of the antibodies directed against other Sp proteins (Sp2 and Sp4) (data not shown), showing that the two complexes did not seem to involve these other proteins. Moreover, the binding pattern was not affected by the addition of purified IgG, used as a negative control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007085-g005">Fig. 5D</xref>, lane 6). Again, similar results were obtained using the three GC-boxes.

This proliferative response was blocked in the presence of competing 4-1BB-Fc, but not by DR3-Fc recombinant protein, showing that 4-1BB/4-1BBL interaction was specifically required for this HDACi-enhanced T cell proliferative response. More recent studies have further revealed additional mechanisms that may account for 4-1BB anti-tumor effects. Firstly, 4-1BB signaling is able to prevent and rescue T cells from immune tolerance, promoting regression of poorly immunogenic tumors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007085-Wilcox1">&#x0005b;54&#x0005d;</xref>.

CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> and CD8<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells have been shown to mediate tumor rejection in an IFN&#x003b3;-dependent fashion through different mechanisms, including up-regulation of molecules critical for antigen processing and presentation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007085-Boehm1">&#x0005b;59&#x0005d;</xref>, differentiation of fully competent effector cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007085-Fallarino1">&#x0005b;60&#x0005d;</xref>, secretion of angiostatic chemokines by stromal cells present within a tumor <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007085-Qin1">&#x0005b;61&#x0005d;</xref>, and regulation of T-cell migration to the tumor site <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007085-Nakajima1">&#x0005b;62&#x0005d;</xref>. In this study, co-cultures of MS-275-treated Raji cells with T cell receptor-stimulated peripheral blood leukocytes enhanced T lymphocyte IFN&#x003b3; secretion, as compared to untreated Raji cells. Increased IFN&#x003b3; secretion was blocked in the presence of competing 4-1BB/TNFRSF9-Fc recombinant protein, showing that 4-1BB/4-1BBL interactions were required. Importantly, induction of IFN&#x003b3; was also observed in the absence of T cell activation, and was completely blocked in the presence of the 4-1BB-Fc recombinant protein, indicating that induction of IFN&#x003b3; by MS-275-treated Raji cells occurred through 4-1BB triggering and could occur in the absence of T cell activation.</p><p>Despite similar levels of induction of 4-1BBL transcription and cell surface expression by TSA, SAHA and MS-275, only MS-275 potentiated IFN&#x003b3; secretion in mixed leukocyte reactions and also provided more efficient T lymphocyte proliferative responses in these assays. These results suggest that compared to TSA and SAHA, MS-275 can provide additional specific signalling to improve further immune responses. Previous reports have shown that HDACi can induce the expression of CD86/B7.2 costimulatory molecule in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells and freshly isolated AML clinical samples <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007085-Maeda1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>. Taken together with our present finding that HDACi can enhance expression of yet another costimulatory molecule, 4-1BBL, this data further supports HDACi, especially MS-275, as antitumor drugs to be used in immunotherapeutic clinical approaches. HDACi have been shown to induce growth arrest, differentiation, and/or apoptosis of cancer cells <italic>in vitro</italic> and in <italic>vivo</italic> tumor-bearing animals models <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007085-Saito1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007085-Butler1">&#x0005b;63&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007085-Jaboin1">&#x0005b;64&#x0005d;</xref>. In association with the proapoptotic effect of HDACi, the enhancement of costimulatory molecules on leukemia blasts could augment tumor immunogenicity, increasing specific CTL activity against tumor cells. Combinatorial treatment modulating both apoptotic and costimulatory molecules may be more effective for reinforcing host immunity and eradicating tumors. This point is supported by a recent study by Uno et al. who showed that induction of tumor cell apoptosis by an agonistic antibody to TRAILR2/DR5, combined with T cell activation by CD40 and 4-1BB agonistic monoclonal antibodies, potently and rapidly stimulated tumor-specific CD8<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells capable of eradicating pre-established tumors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007085-Uno1">&#x0005b;65&#x0005d;</xref>. It is noteworthy that HDACi treatment did not induce 4-1BBL transcription in breast-derived tumor cells lines, nor did it induce significant 4-1BBL transcription in primary human peripheral blood lymphocytes, suggesting leukemia specific modulation of 4-1BBL by HDACi treatment (BV, data not shown).</p><p>In conclusion, we have demonstrated that HDACi can modulate the expression of 4-1BBL costimulatory molecule in B leukemia cell line model, which can enhance T cell responses towards the tumor cells. Further studies are now required to examine these effects using primary cells from patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and to determine in animal models whether 4-1BBL/<italic>TNFSF9</italic> up-regulation contributes to HDACi-induced anti-tumor effects <italic>in vivo</italic>.
