We report here the nucleotide sequence of aspS and the corresponding primary structure of the aspartyl-tRNA synthetase, a protein of 590 amino acid residues with a Mr 65,913, a value in close agreement with that observed for the purified protein. Primer extension analysis of the aspS mRNA using reverse transcriptase located its 5'-end at 94 nucleotides upstream of the translation initiation AUG; nuclease S1 analysis located the 3'-end at 126 nucleotides downstream of the stop codon UGA. Comparison of the DNA-derived protein sequence with known aminoacyl-tRNA sequences revealed important homologies with asparaginyl- and lysyl-tRNA synthetases from E.coli; more than 25% of their amino acid residues are identical, the homologies being distributed preferencially in the first part and the carboxy-terminal end of the molecule. Mutagenesis directed towards a consensus tetrapeptide (Gly-Leu-Asp-Arg) and the carboxy-terminal end showed that both domains could be implicated in catalysis as well as in ATP binding.</p><sec><title>Images</title><fig id="F1"><graphic xlink:href="nar00207-0351-a" xlink:role="7112"/></fig><fig id="F2"><graphic xlink:href="nar00207-0353-a" xlink:role="7114"/></fig><fig id="F3"><graphic xlink:href="nar00207-0354-a" xlink:role="7115"/></fig></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><supplementary-material content-type="scanned-pages"><graphic xlink:href="nar00207-0348.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="7109"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00207-0349.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="7110"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00207-0350.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="7111"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00207-0351.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="7112"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00207-0352.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="7113"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00207-0353.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="7114"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00207-0354.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="7115"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00207-0355.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="7116"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00207-0356.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="7117"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00207-0357.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="7118"/></supplementary-material></body></article>
