The Th2 cytokine interleukin (IL)-13 has been implicated in the pathogenesis of asthma[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Its central role in the asthma paradigm is supported by human studies that have reported increased IL-13 mRNA expression in bronchial biopsies from subjects with moderate asthma[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>] and from sputum cells from corticosteroid na&#x000ef;ve and inhaled corticosteroid treated asthmatics[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. In addition, following allergen challenge in mild asthmatics bronchoalveolar lavage IL-13 concentration was upregulated[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. This association between IL-13 and asthma in humans is supported by animal models[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. T-lymphocyte deficient mice have shown exogenous addition of IL-13 promotes AHR and airway inflammation, while neutralisation of IL-13 in murine models can resolve these features[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>].</p><p>Importantly comparisons between asthma and non-asthmatic eosinophilic bronchitis (EB), a common cause of chronic cough[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>] in which disordered airway physiology is not a feature, have been informative about the key immunopathological features of asthma. Over expression of IL-13 in sputum [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>], bronchial submucosa[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>] and co-localisation to mast cells in the ASM-bundle[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>] are features of asthma that are not shared by EB and have therefore further supported its role in the pathogenesis of AHR. Whether this differential IL-13 expression is specific to the airway or is a generalised phenomenon present in peripheral blood cells is uncertain.</p><p>We hypothesised that IL-13 expression is upregulated in peripheral blood T-cells and eosinophils in asthma compared to EB and healthy controls. We have further considered the possibility that asthmatic serum contains a pro-inflammatory stimulus that primes IL-13 release from healthy subjects.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Subjects</title><p>Subjects with asthma (n = 24) and EB (n = 7) and healthy volunteers (n = 16) were recruited from Glenfield Hospital outpatients, staff and by local advertising. All subjects were non-smokers with a smoking history of &#x0003c; 10 pack years; had been free of exacerbations and on stable treatment for 8 weeks prior to entry into the study. EB was defined according to the American College Of Chest Physicians (ACCP) criteria[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. Asthma was defined by one or more of the following objective criteria: significant bronchodilator reversibility of &#x0003e; 200 mls, a provocation concentration of methacholine causing a 20% fall in FEV<sub>1 </sub>(PC<sub>20</sub>) of less than 8 mg/ml or a peak flow amplitude % mean over 2 weeks of more than 20%. Severity was classified using the current global initiative for asthma (GINA) treatment steps[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. Normal subjects had no history of respiratory disease and normal spirometry. The Leicestershire ethics committee approved the study and all patients gave their written informed consent.</p></sec><sec><title>Protocol and clinical characterisation</title><p>Subjects underwent spirometry, allergen skin prick tests for <italic>Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus</italic>, dog, cat and grass pollen, measurement of exhaled nitric oxide (eNO) concentration (measured at 50 mls/s NIOX; Aerocrine, Stockholm, Sweden), a methacholine inhalation test[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>] and sputum induction[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Isolation of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) and eosinophils</title><p>Mononuclear cells and eosinophils were isolated from peripheral blood. Briefly, 100 mls of heparinised peripheral blood was venesected from a subgroup of the patients with asthma (n = 12), EB (n = 7) and healthy controls (n = 9). After an initial step of Dextran red cell sedimentation, the plasma layer was removed and after centrifugation the cell pellet was resuspended over Histopaque 1077 (Sigma, Poole, Dorset, UK). After further centrifugation the mononuclear cell interface was collected and washed twice with phosphate buffered saline. For eosinophil separation the remaining pellet after histopaque centrifugation underwent red cell lysis followed by negative immunomagnetic selection using anti-CD16 coated immunomagnetic beads. There were insufficient eosinophils isolated to undertake further experiments from 3 healthy controls and 1 subject with EB. Cell purity and viability was assessed and was &#x0003e; 95% in all subjects. Following purification PBMC and eosinophils were cultured at 1 &#x000d7; 10<sup>6 </sup>cells/ml in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and either left unstimulated in the presence of brefeldin or stimulated with phorpbol myristate acetate (PMA) [5 ng/ml; Sigma Chemical Co, UK] and calcium ionophore [250 ng/ml; Sigma, UK] in the presence of the fungal protein brefeldin [10 &#x003bc;g/ml] for 4 h at 37&#x000b0;C.</p></sec><sec><title>Intracellular Flow cytometry for IL-13</title><p>The cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde (Sigma, UK) and stored overnight at 4&#x000b0;C in PBS, 0.5% BSA. The following day the cells were washed and incubated with CD3-RPE (mononuclear cells only) (BD biosciences, UK) permeabilised in 4% paraformaldehyde, 0.1% saponin (Sigma, UK) for 15 min on ice and labelled with IL-13-FITC (BD biosciences, UK) or isotype controls and analysed by two-colour flow-cytometry as described previously[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Stimulation of healthy PBMC with asthmatic serum</title><p>PBMC from 10 healthy controls, including 3 subjects that had participated in the first part of this study, were stimulated with pooled serum from asthmatic subjects and PBMC from 4 of these subjects were stimulated with pooled serum from non-asthmatics.</p><p>PBMC stimulation was carried out in 24-well cell culture plates in duplicates in the presence and absence of 0.1, 1 and 10% human serum. IL-17E has been implicated to promote IL-13 release from PBMC and may be an important mediator in the asthmatic serum. Therefore the serum stimulation was undertaken with and without recombinant human IL-17E (100 ng/ml) and or IL-17E neutralising antibody (20 &#x003bc;g/ml) (R&#x00026;D Systems, Abingdon, Oxford, UK). 500 &#x003bc;l of PBMC suspension was added to each well equating to 2 &#x000d7; 10<sup>6 </sup>PBMC/well. Finally, 250 &#x003bc;l of either DMEM alone, or DMEM containing 4 &#x000d7; final concentration (final concentration was 20 ng/ml) of PMA (Sigma, UK) was added to the cells. The cells were incubated for 16 h at 37&#x000b0;C in a humidified atmosphere flushed with 5% CO<sub>2</sub>. Following the incubation, PBMC were decanted into 1.5 ml Eppendorf<sup>&#x000ae; </sup>tubes and centrifuged at 400 &#x000d7; g for 5 min. The supernatants were removed and stored at -20&#x000b0;C for analysis.</p><p>IL-13 was measured using a sandwich ELISA (Bender MedSystems, UK). The limit of detection of the ELISA was 1.56 pg/ml. The IL-13 concentration in the pooled asthmatic and non-asthmatic serum was subtracted from the concentration of IL-13 released by stimulated PBMC primed with serum.</p></sec><sec><title>Mesoscale analysis of serum from asthmatics and healthy controls</title><p>The concentration of a panel of cytokines and chemokines were measured in serum from the 10 healthy subjects that had participated in asthmatic serum-stimulated PBMC experiments and 12 asthmatics using the mesoscale discovery system. This assay uses electrochemiluminescence detection and pattern arrays (Mesoscale Discovery, Gaithersburg, Maryland, USA). The panel included the cytokines (IFN-&#x003b3;, IL-1&#x003b2;, IL-2, IL-4, IL-5, IL-8 (CXCL8), IL-10, IL-12p70, IL-13, TNF-&#x003b1;) and chemokines (CCL11, CCL4, CCL26, CCL17, CXCL10, CCL2, CCL22, CCL13). The limits of detection of the mesoscale system were, [CCL2; 1 pg/ml], [CCL4; 20 pg/ml], [CCL11; 10 pg/ml], [CCL13; 100 pg/ml], [CCL17; 50 pg/ml], [CCL22; 150 pg/ml], [CCL26; 200 pg/ml], [CXCL8; 1 pg/ml], and [CXCL10; 200 pg/ml], all other limits of detection were 1 pg/ml.</p></sec><sec><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Subject characteristics were described using descriptive statistics.

Our findings are consistent with a previous study by <italic>Park et al</italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>], in which IL-13 secretion by PBMC was increased in asthma compared to EB and healthy controls. In addition we have shown for the first time that IL-13 expression in eosinophils was not different between subjects with asthma and EB, although there was a non-significant trend towards increased expression in eosinophils in the disease groups compared to controls. This suggests that the observed up-regulation of the IL-13 axis by airway eosinophils in asthma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>] may be influenced by the local microenvironment.</p><p>Importantly, we have demonstrated that serum from asthmatics but not from non-asthmatics can promote increased IL-13 release from healthy PBMC suggesting that asthmatic serum contains an activator of the IL-13 pathway. We investigated the role of IL-17E a known pro-inflammatory primer for IL-13 release as a potential candidate[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>], but our findings do not support a role for IL-17E as a primer for IL-13 release in peripheral blood. In addition we were unable to identify a potential pro-inflammatory candidate in serum across a range of chemokines and cytokines assessed by mesoscale analysis. Therefore further work is required to assess the potential role of systemic inflammation in mediating up-regulated Th2 cytokine expression in asthma.</p><p>Our findings further strengthen the argument for IL-13 being a key mediator in the pathogenesis of AHR in asthma. IL-13 may promote AHR by a variety of diverse mechanisms. In vitro IL-13, but not IL-4, has been shown to attenuate ASM relaxation to &#x003b2;-agonists[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>] and augment contractility to acetylcholine[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>] suggesting that IL-13 may induce AHR by directly activating ASM. Indirectly IL-13 may modulate AHR by its effects on airway smooth muscle proliferation[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>] and interactions with the airway epithelium[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. In contrast to <italic>Park et al </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>], we were unable to demonstrate a correlation between AHR and T-cell IL-13 expression suggesting that the relationship between the intensity of IL-13 expression and AHR is complex as we have previously described in severe asthma[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>].</p><p>One potential criticism of our study is its cross-sectional design as this does limit our interpretation of the possible effects of corticosteroid therapy and the longitudinal variability of IL-13 expression in peripheral blood cells. However, we are confident that we have established key differences in IL-13 expression between asthma and EB by peripheral blood T-cells supporting the view that the differences observed in the airway and also present systemically. Further work is required to explore the mechanisms driving this differential IL-13 expression.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>In conclusion we have found that IL-13 expression is increased in peripheral blood T-cells in asthma compared to EB and healthy subjects, which in part may be due to a pro-inflammatory stimulus in asthmatic serum. This further supports the role of IL-13 in asthma.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>CB has received consultancy fees and research funding from GlaxoSmithKline, MedImmune, and AstraZeneca.
