For example, morphogens such as WNTs are important not only for neural patterning but also for synaptogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Similarly, secreted factors such as UNC-6/netrin and semaphorins are required for both axon guidance and synapse formation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>], and gamma-protocadherins promote both neuronal survival and synapse formation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. These molecules may serve multiple functions through a single or multiple genetic pathways during the different developmental processes.</p><p>Distinguishing the multiple roles of a gene in neuronal development is often challenging because the developmental processes are highly interdependent: neurons that fail to polarize cannot form functional synapses, and conversely, failure in establishing synapses may lead to axon retraction and subsequent abnormalities in axon growth. Therefore, the involvement of a gene in later differentiation stages could be masked by an early-stage arrest. Addressing this issue with conventional genetic methods is not always possible. Gene knock-outs lead to an irreversible, often complete loss of gene function, and their mutant phenotypes are likely to reveal only the earliest roles during development. Temperature sensitive (<italic>ts</italic>) or partial loss-of-function (LOF) genetic alleles are a commonly used alternative. However, <italic>ts </italic>alleles are available for only a very small number of genes, and partial LOF alleles may carry sufficient residual activity to obscure the functional identification. The conditional Cre-Lox recombination-induced gene knock-out system allows temporal and tissue-specific gene inactivation; but few Cre lines permit the tight temporal control required to analyze the neuronal differentiation events that transition from one stage to the next within a narrow window of time. Therefore, a complete but reversible inactivation strategy that allows for tight temporal control and tissue specificity would be an ideal approach to addressing this issue [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>].</p><p>A chemical-genetic method that combines the specificity of genetics with the reversibility and temporal control of pharmacology has been developed for kinases. Initially identified as an inhibitor for the Src kinase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>], the adenine analog PP1 was modified to selectively bind genetically sensitized kinases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. In this method, the hydrophobic gate-keeper residue in the ATP-binding pocket of a kinase of interest is mutated to glycine or alanine (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>), creating extra space in the ATP-binding pocket. Exposing this mutant kinase to membrane-permeable, non-hydrolyzable PP1 analogs containing a bulky moiety (for example, 1NA-PP1) allows for selective inactivation of the kinase of interest [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>].</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>L123A SAD-1 is functional and can be inactivated with a PP1 analog <italic>in vitro</italic>.</bold> (A) Alignment of <italic>C. elegans </italic>SAD-1 and murine SAD kinases with other kinases successfully engineered using the chemical-genetic strategy.

In the absence of LKB1, both wild-type (WT) and analog-sensitive (<italic>as</italic>) versions of SAD-1 were inactive. Following treatment with LKB1, both versions became active towards tau [S262], but the kinase activity of the L123A SAD-1 was reduced 70%.

Initially identified in <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic>, SAD-1 is required for proper neuronal polarity and synaptic organization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. In <italic>sad-1 </italic>LOF mutants, synaptic vesicles and other presynaptic proteins are trafficked to both axons and dendrites, and vesicle clusters are abnormally diffuse at synapses. Its mammalian orthologs, SAD-A and SAD-B, also play multiple roles in neural development. Mouse SAD-A and SAD-B (also known as BRSK2 and BRSK1, respectively) function redundantly to regulate neuronal polarity <italic>in vivo </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>], and SAD-B regulates the release of synaptic neurotransmitters in cultured rat neurons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>].</p><p>The mechanism of SAD-1-mediated regulation of neuronal polarity and synaptic organization is not well-understood. Our recent study showed that SAD-1 physically interacts with a scaffolding protein, NAB-1 (Neurabin-1), and that this interaction is essential for regulating neuronal polarity but not synaptic organization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. These data suggest that SAD-1 regulates neuronal polarity through pathways that are distinct from those for synaptic organization. Whether SAD-1 is required for the establishment or maintenance of the two neuronal structures is unknown. To dissect the temporal requirements for SAD-1 in neuronal polarity and synaptic organization, precise temporal inactivation of SAD-1 activity <italic>in vivo </italic>is needed. The kinase activity of SAD proteins is essential for their <italic>in vivo </italic>functions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>], making SAD-1 an ideal candidate for a chemical-genetic system that allows for inducible and reversible inactivation of kinase activity.</p><p>The chemical-genetic strategy has been used in yeast, <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, <italic>Drosophila</italic>, mammalian cell lines, and mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. Here we report the first successful application of this method in <italic>C. elegans</italic>. Using this system, we discovered that the kinase activity of SAD-1 is required at developmental stages that coincide with the establishment of neuronal polarity and synaptic organization. However, while inactivating SAD-1 when neurons are establishing polarity and synapses led to irreversible defects in neuronal polarity, defects in synaptic organization were reversible and corrected by SAD-1 activity during maintenance. Therefore, these differentiation events have distinct temporal requirements for SAD-1 activity.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>L123A SAD-1 is functional and can be inactivated by a PP1 analog <italic>in vitro</italic></title><p>To generate a SAD-1 variant that is sensitive to PP1 analogs, its gate-keeper residue, leucine 123, was mutated to an alanine (L123A; Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>). The kinase activity of L123A SAD-1 was compared to that of the wild-type enzyme in an <italic>in vitro </italic>kinase assay using tau as a substrate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>] (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>). Upon activation by the LKB1 complex [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>], both wild-type and L123A mutant enzymes were able to phosphorylate tau at S262. L123A SAD-1 was 30% as active as the wild-type enzyme even at the highest ATP concentrations tested (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>). An alteration in activity of this magnitude is not uncommon for kinases with mutated gate-keeper residues, and in most cases the decrease in activity does not affect the ability of the kinase to properly function <italic>in vivo </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>].</p><p>We next tested the sensitivity of wild-type and L123A SAD-1 to a PP1 analog, 1NA-PP1. The wild-type enzyme was unaffected by 1NA-PP1, but L123A SAD-1 was inhibited in a dose-dependent manner (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>). In summary, L123A SAD-1 retains kinase activity and is selectively sensitive to a PP1 analog.</p></sec><sec><title>L123A SAD-1 is functional <italic>in vivo</italic></title><p>To determine if L123A SAD-1 can substitute for wild-type SAD-1 <italic>in vivo</italic>, we asked whether it can rescue neuronal polarity and synaptic organization phenotypes of <italic>sad-1 </italic>null mutants. The L123A mutation was introduced to a <italic>sad-1 </italic>construct that rescues defects in both neuronal phenotypes of <italic>sad-1 </italic>mutants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. This construct, <italic>P</italic><sub><italic>sad-1</italic></sub>-<italic>sad-1</italic>(<italic>L123A</italic>), was introduced into <italic>sad-1 </italic>(<italic>ky289</italic>) null mutants along with <italic>juIs1</italic>, a fluorescent marker of synaptic vesicles in GABAergic neurons (<italic>P</italic><sub><italic>unc-25</italic></sub>-<italic>snb-1</italic>::<italic>gfp</italic>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. The <italic>juIs1 </italic>marker has been shown to be a reliable reporter for neuronal polarity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>] and synaptic organization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>].</p><p>We first examined if L123A SAD-1 rescued the neuronal polarity defect in <italic>sad-1 </italic>mutants. In adult animals, the two classes of <italic>C. elegans </italic>GABAergic motoneurons, DDs and VDs, innervate dorsal and ventral body wall muscles, respectively. We observed vesicle trafficking in VD neurons by selectively eliminating the <italic>juIs1 </italic>expression in DD neurons (see Materials and methods). The polarity of VD neurons is reflected by the selective accumulation of the presynaptic <italic>juIs1 </italic>vesicle clusters, or puncta, in axonal processes along the ventral nerve cord and their exclusion from dendrites along the dorsal nerve cord in wild-type animals as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>] (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2Ai</xref>). In <italic>sad-1 </italic>mutants, on the other hand, vesicles are present in both ventral axons and dorsal dendrites (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2Aii</xref>). This polarity defect was quantified by counting the number of ectopic, dorsal <italic>juIs1 </italic>puncta (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B, C</xref>). As previously reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>], a 10-fold increase in ectopic <italic>juIs1 </italic>puncta was observed in <italic>sad-1 </italic>mutants relative to wild-type animals (<italic>p </italic>= 3.2 &#x000d7; 10<sup>-6</sup>). In the L123A SAD-1-expressing <italic>sad-1 </italic>mutants, the number of ectopic <italic>juIs1 </italic>puncta was decreased more than 50% (<italic>p </italic>= 3.2 &#x000d7; 10<sup>-6 </sup>compared to <italic>sad-1 </italic>mutants; Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B, C</xref>). This partial rescue may reflect the reduced kinase activity of L123A SAD-1 compared to the wild-type enzyme (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>). It is noteworthy, however, that wild-type SAD-1 also only partially rescued polarity defects in <italic>sad-1 </italic>null mutants (<italic>p </italic>= 3.2 &#x000d7; 10<sup>-5 </sup>compared to <italic>sad-1 </italic>mutants; Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2C</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>], suggesting that the rescue of the <italic>sad-1 </italic>polarity phenotype is sensitive to the protein level typically over-expressed by transgenes.</p><fig position="float" id="F2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p><bold>L123A SAD-1 is functional <italic>in vivo</italic>.

In wild-type animals, <italic>juIs1 </italic>puncta in DD axons were round and discrete along the dorsal nerve cord, displaying the characteristic 'beads-on-a-string' morphology (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2Di, Ei</xref>). In <italic>sad-1 </italic>mutants, <italic>juIs1 </italic>puncta appeared diffuse or smaller (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2Dii, Eii</xref>). This defect in the <italic>juIs1 </italic>morphology correlates with a more diffuse distribution of synaptic vesicles in <italic>sad-1 </italic>mutants as shown by electron microscopy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. For a quantitative analysis of the <italic>juIs1 </italic>morphology, the width of each punctum was measured, and the population distribution of punctum widths was examined. As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2F</xref>, <italic>sad-1 </italic>mutants displayed a broader distribution of punctum widths, or 'lower kurtosis' of the distribution curve, than wild-type animals, consistent with the appearance of both diffuse and smaller puncta.

We devised a liquid culture method using 96-well tissue culture dishes (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>), which allows for effective entry of 1NA-PP1 into animals through ingestion and also reduces the quantity of analog required. A dose-response curve was generated by exposing animals to different concentrations of 1NA-PP1 throughout their life and then assaying for polarity and synaptic organization phenotypes in adults (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>).

Conversely, an exposure to 1NA-PP1 throughout maintenance had little effect on the polarity phenotype of SAD-1<italic>as </italic>animals (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4Biii, C</xref>). These results suggest that SAD-1 activity is required for the establishment, but not the maintenance, of neuronal polarity.</p><p>In contrast to the dramatic effects of early larval inhibition on adult neuronal polarity, inactivating SAD-1<italic>as </italic>for either three days or 30 hours in early larvae had little effect on the <italic>juIs1 </italic>morphology in adults (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B, D</xref>). Diffuse puncta were observed occasionally after three days of inactivation (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4Di</xref>), but this subtle abnormality was not quantitatively significant (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4Div</xref>).</p><p>These results suggest at least two possibilities. SAD-1 may be required solely for the maintenance of already-established synaptic organization and not for synapse formation. However, this is unlikely as exposing animals selectively during maintenance did not affect the <italic>juIs1 </italic>morphology (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4Biii, Diii, vi</xref>). Alternatively, SAD-1 kinase activity during the maintenance stage may be sufficient to re-establish synaptic organization. To test this possibility, we treated SAD-1<italic>as </italic>animals with 1NA-PP1 either throughout establishment until the end of the L2 stage or during the short 30-hour duration of DD synapse formation and observed their <italic>juIs1 </italic>morphology immediately after treatment (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5Aii, iii</xref>). Indeed, <italic>juIs1 </italic>puncta appeared diffuse immediately after treatment, suggesting that inhibiting SAD-1<italic>as </italic>during synaptogenesis abolished its rescuing effects on vesicle clustering (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5B</xref>). Therefore, the re-activation of SAD-1<italic>as </italic>during maintenance following the early exposures to 1NA-PP1 led to restoration of the <italic>juIs1 </italic>morphology in adults (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4Dii&#x02013;iii</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5Bi</xref>).

Using this system, we temporally inactivated SAD-1 kinase during different stages of the <italic>C. elegans </italic>life-cycle and found that SAD-1 activity is necessary in establishing both neuronal polarity and synaptic organization but dispensable for their maintenance (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>). However, while SAD-1 activity is required strictly during a narrow window of time to establish neuronal polarity, its activity is not temporally restricted to the establishment stage and sufficient to re-establish synaptic organization in later stages. Our study thus reveals temporally distinct requirements for SAD-1 activity during neuronal differentiation.</p><sec><title>A chemical-genetic approach in analyzing kinase functions in <italic>C. elegans</italic></title><p>We showed that SAD-1<italic>as </italic>can be generated by mutating the gate-keeper residue, allowing inducible, fast, and reversible inhibition of its kinase activity with a specific small-molecule inhibitor. In this study, a small-volume liquid culture system was devised that offered several advantages over conventional plate cultures (Additional files <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S2">2</xref>; described in Materials and methods). The small volumes of the liquid culture required only microgram quantities of 1NA-PP1, reducing the quantity of inhibitor used 30-fold. The liquid culture also facilitated efficient administration of the membrane-permeable inhibitor through feeding.</p><p>PP1 analogs effectively blocked the activity of <italic>as</italic>-kinases at nanomolar concentrations in yeast and mammalian cell cultures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. In our study, micromolar-range 1NA-PP1 was required to achieve complete inhibition of SAD-1<italic>as </italic>(Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). This is likely caused by the poor permeability of <italic>C. elegans </italic>cuticles, only allowing entry through feeding.

Indeed, a similar PP1 analog, 1NM-PP1, has been shown to cross the murine blood-brain barrier within minutes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. We also do not believe differential susceptibilities to 1NA-PP1 entry existed during different larval stages of the <italic>C. elegans </italic>life-cycle because the phenotypic difference in synaptic organization between the lifetime exposure (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7Aii</xref>) and early larval exposures (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7Avi, vii</xref>) suggests that there was sufficient 1NA-PP1 entry and inhibition of SAD-1<italic>as </italic>across the larval stages.</p><p>Although the chemical-genetic system has proven to be quite a versatile and effective tool for regulating the activity of different kinases in yeast and cell culture studies, its application to intact animal models has been limited.

Using inducible modulation of protein activity (<italic>as</italic>) and of mRNA expression (HS), we have now demonstrated that the neuronal structures also display different temporal requirements for SAD-1 activity.</p><p>The molecular basis for the temporal distinction between neuronal polarity and synaptic organization is unknown. The simplest explanation is that SAD-1 targets different substrates during polarization and synapse formation. While the substrates involved in neuronal polarization may only be present or active during the establishment stage, those involved in synapse formation may be present throughout establishment and maintenance. The mammalian orthologs of SAD-1, SAD-A and SAD-B, have been shown to regulate neuronal polarity through phosphorylation of tau, a microtubule associated protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>], and subsequent promotion of microtubule dynamics during axon extension [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. As an activator of microtubule dynamics, SAD-1 would define neuronal polarity only during the establishment stage. At synapses, the diffuse vesicle clustering in <italic>sad-1 </italic>mutants may reflect a failure in regulating vesicle release at the active zone or vesicle retrieval at the periactive zone. SAD-1 might phosphorylate distinct substrates that are required for organizing the endo- and exo-cytosis apparatus or for facilitating the interactions between vesicles and active zone/periactive zone regions.</p><p>To further our understanding of SAD-1, it is critical to identify all of its physiological substrates.
