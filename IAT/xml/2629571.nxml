We have investigated the cross talk between the two main signaling pathways involved in activation and repression of corticotrophin releasing hormone (CRH) mRNA expression: cyclic AMP (cAMP) and GR. We report that in the At-T20 cell-line the glucocorticoid-mediated repression of the cAMP-induced human CRH proximal promoter activity depends on the relative timing of activation of both signaling pathways. Activation of the GR prior to or in conjunction with cAMP signaling results in an effective repression of the cAMP-induced transcription of the CRH gene. In contrast, activation of the GR 10 minutes after onset of cAMP treatment, results in a significant loss of GR-mediated repression. In addition, translocation of ligand-activated GR to the nucleus was found as early as 10 minutes after glucocorticoid treatment. Interestingly, while both signaling cascades counteract each other on the CRH proximal promoter, they synergize on a synthetic promoter containing &#x02018;positive&#x02019; response elements. Since the order of activation of both signaling pathways may vary considerably <italic>in vivo</italic>, we conclude that a critical time-window exists for effective repression of the CRH gene by glucocorticoids.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="6"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Corticotropin releasing hormone (CRH) is a pivotal signaling molecule in the regulation of the stress response. This neuropeptide is expressed at high levels in the hypothalamus, from where it coordinates the hormonal and autonomic response to stress, and the central nucleus of the amygdala, where it plays a crucial role in regulating anxiety. Regulation of the expression of CRH is therefore thought to be physiologically important in relation to coping with stress. CRH gene regulation is a complex process that involves multiple activating and repressing transcription factors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004327-Liu1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>. Among the often studied factors that can regulate CRH expression are glucocorticoid hormones <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004327-Swanson1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>, which in a cell-dependent manner either repress of stimulate the CRH gene.

Clearly, the reduced time of DEX exposure is not proportional to the loss of GR-mediated repression pointing to a &#x02018;GR resistance&#x02019;. Because FSK treatment induces a progressive increase of the CRH-luc promoter activity over a period of at least 5 hours (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004327-g002">fig. 2A</xref>) we assume that FSK-induces binding of CREB to the promoter over that period.

The spacing of the elements is such that it is unlikely that both GR and CREB may bind simultaneously in an independent manner <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004327-Pearce1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>. Sterical hindrance at the promoter due to the formation of larger protein complexes may be responsible for the importance of timing of stimuli. Alternatively, in view of the dynamic nature of transcription factor-DNA interactions, CREB-mediated chromatin remodeling events that disfavor GR-binding may account for the decreased GR efficacy observed after prior cAMP elevations.</p><p>Interestingly, the analogous dependence of timing of both cAMP and GR that exists for ACTH secretion <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004327-Shipston1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>, which obviously is not linked to the activity of the exogenous reporter plasmid, suggests that the phenomenon of time-dependence occurs at multiple genes. Any gene regulated in a parallel manner will allow better hypotheses as to the mechanism that is responsible for the time dependent effects. POMC and CRH seem to depend on the same coregulator molecule, namely SRC-1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004327-vanderLaan1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004327-Winnay1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>. In this respect it would be of great interest to also study negative regulation of the endogenous POMC gene in these cells under similar conditions as were used for the CRH reporter construct.</p><p>Although numerous studies were devoted to understanding the regulation of CRH gene expression in the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus, it is still a topic of debate whether the activated-GR directly acts on the promoter region of the gene or that different mechanisms are responsible for the repression of CRH gene after stress. Bali <italic>et al.</italic> convincingly demonstrated in organotypic slice cultures that the GR directly acts on the paraventricular neurons to repress FSK-induced activity. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying this GR-mediated repression are still unknown. Guardiola-Diaz <italic>et al.</italic> suggested in 1996 that glucocorticoid repression occurs via interactions between the GR and the cAMP-responsive element-binding proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004327-GuardiolaDiaz1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>, rather than via direct DNA binding of GR. In contrast, Dorin <italic>et al.</italic> provided evidence, also in the same cell line as used in present study, that the nGRE in the promoter is essential for repression by glucocorticoids <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004327-Malkoski1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>. It would certainly be of interest to study whether CREB phosphorylation status changes as a consequence of GR activation at different time points, and test the hypothesis that it is inversely related with the extent of GR repression. However, while CREB-driven transcription is repressed by glucocorticoids on the composite hCRH promoter, it is unaffected on a 5&#x000d7;CRE-containing promoter <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004327-vanderLaan1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>. With the possible caveat that the 5&#x000d7;CRE may be not allow detection of subtle changes in CREB function, these data point to gene/promoter specificity of any direct CREB-GR interactions.</p><p>On the other hand, FSK-induced PKA can modulate glucocorticoid signaling both on the composite hCRH and the exclusively 3&#x000d7;GRE-containing promoters. Therefore, PKA activation can determine the transcriptional outcome at glucocorticoid target genes, independent of the presence of CREs in the promoter. We postulate that there is no cross-talk between the GR and CREB off the DNA but that PKA activation modulates GR-mediated transcription by changing e.g the phosphorylation status of coregulator proteins. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays should be used to test the interactions between GR and (phospho-)CREB at the CRH promoter, and demonstrate lack of direct GR-CREB interactions at non-composite GRE-containing promoters.</p><p>An unexplained phenomenon is that, in contrast to the situation in PVN, glucocorticoids induce, rather than repress, CRH gene expression in the placenta and amygadala <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004327-Swanson1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004327-Makino1">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004327-King1">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref>. The opposite effect of GR in these cells may rather relate to differential presence of transcription factors or coactivators such as SRC1a <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004327-vanderLaan1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004327-King2">&#x0005b;25&#x0005d;</xref>. One principle difference in cellular context between CRH containing cells in PVN and other tissues is that activation of the CRH gene in the paraventricular cells often will be accompanied by increased activation of the HPA axis, causing a quick rise in glucorticoid levels and GR activation. However, current data should be interpreted in the context of regulation of the CRH-promoter in the PVN, and do not give insights in the mechanisms governing the cell-specific effects of glucocorticoids on CRH expression.</p><p>It is well known that acute exogenous steroid treatment effectively suppresses stress-induced expression of CRH mRNA in rats <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004327-Ginsberg1">&#x0005b;26&#x0005d;</xref>. However, the current study using a model system shows that repression is markedly attenuated if GR activation is initiated with as little as a 10 minutes delay. The critical time-window for effective repression by glucocorticoids may have interesting implications in the control of CRH expression <italic>in vivo.</italic> The order of activation of both signaling pathways is variable, and depends on the history of stress and glucocorticoid exposure, as well as the circadian and ultradian pulsatility of glucocorticoid levels <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004327-Windle1">&#x0005b;27&#x0005d;</xref>. Therefore, it is likely that effective GR-mediated repression of the stress-induced CRH mRNA expression will only occur in specific situations. We conclude that the differences in timing of stimulatory and repression signals are of consequence for adaptation of the organism to stress.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Reporter assays</title><p>0.1&#x000d7;10<sup>6</sup> cells were transiently transfected in 24-wells plate using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen, Breda, The Netherlands) according to the manufacturer's instructions.

Cells were incubated with a GR-specific antibody (M20; dilution 1&#x02236;500; Santa Cruz biotechnologies) during 60 minutes, washed and subsequently incubated for 60 minutes with a secondary goat anti-rabbit Alexa Fluor 488 antibody (dilution 1&#x02236;750; Invitrogen, Breda, The Netherlands). After incubation, cells were washed and counterstained for 10 min with Hoechst 33528. All sections were embedded in polyaquamount (Polysciences, Inc.) and visualized with an immunofluorescence microscope (Leica DM6000). Control cells were incubated with equal amounts of non-immune rabbit serum (Santa Cruz), which was used as substitute for the primary antibodies. Nuclear immunoreactivity was measured using ImageJ 1.32j software (NIH, USA).</p></sec></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="pone.0004327-Liu1"><label>1</label><citation
