Identification of regulatory networks modulating <italic>PCSK9</italic> transcription is important for developing selective repressors of PCSK9 to improve statin efficacy by prolonging the up-regulation of LDLR. Interestingly, the plant-derived hypocholesterolemic compound berberine (BBR) up-regulates LDLR expression while down-regulating PCSK9. In our investigations to define mechanisms underlying the transcriptional suppression of <italic>PCSK9</italic> by BBR in HepG2 cells, we have identified a highly conserved hepatocyte nuclear factor 1 (HNF1) binding site residing 28 bp upstream from SRE as a critical sequence motif for <italic>PCSK9</italic> transcription and its regulation by BBR. Mutation of the HNF1 site reduced <italic>PCSK9</italic> promoter activity &#x0003e;90%. A battery of functional assays identified HNF1&#x003b1; as the predominant trans-activator for <italic>PCSK9</italic> gene working through this sequence motif. We further provide evidence suggesting that HNF1 site works cooperatively with SRE as HNF1 mutation significantly attenuated the activity of nuclear SREBP2 to transactivate <italic>PCSK9</italic> promoter. Finally, we show that a coordinate modest reduction of HNF1&#x003b1; and nuclear SREBP2 by BBR led to a strong suppression of <italic>PCSK9</italic> transcription through these two critical regulatory sequences. This is the first described example of SREBP pairing with HNF1 to control an important regulatory pathway in cholesterol homeostasis. This work also provides a mechanism for how BBR suppresses <italic>PCSK9</italic> transcription.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><p>Recent studies of human genetics and genome-wide screens have identified proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (<italic>PCSK9</italic>)<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN2"><sup>2</sup></xref> as the third gene associated with autosomal dominant familial hypercholesterolemia, after LDL receptor (<italic>LDLR</italic>) and apoB100 (<italic>apoB</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2"/>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>).

It is synthesized as a 72-kDa zymogen that undergoes autocatalytic cleavage in the endoplasmic reticulum into a heterodimer of a prosegment (122 amino acids) and a 60-kDa active form, which is secreted as a proteolytic inactive form (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>). Once secreted outside cells, PCSK9 can bind to the EGF-A extracellular domain of LDLR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>) and trigger its intracellular degradation in lysosomes, thus increasing the level of circulating LDL-cholesterol (LDL-C).</p><p>At the transcriptional level, <italic>PCSK9</italic> has been identified as a target gene of sterol regulatory element binding proteins (SREBPs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>). The proximal promoter of the <italic>PCSK9</italic> gene contains a functional sterol regulatory element (SRE) that responds to changes in intracellular cholesterol levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>). It has been shown that insulin induces <italic>PCSK9</italic> transcription through the interaction of SREBP1c with the SRE motif in rodent primary hepatocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>). In HepG2 cells both SREBP1 and SREBP2 transcriptionally activate <italic>PCSK9</italic> via this SRE site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>). <italic>In vivo</italic> however, it was suggested that the sterol-dependent regulation of <italic>PCSK9</italic> is mediated predominantly by SREBP2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>).</p><p>Statins reduce intracellular levels of sterols and activate the SREBP pathway by inhibiting hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA, the rate-limiting enzyme in cholesterol biosynthesis. <italic>PCSK9</italic> and <italic>LDLR</italic> both contain an SRE motif in their proximal promoters and thus are coordinately up-regulated by statins through activation of SREBP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>). Several studies have demonstrated the induction of PCSK9 by statins in cultured cells and in animal models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>). The abrogation of the effect of pravastatin on <italic>PCSK9</italic> promoter harboring a mutated SRE further confirmed its regulation by the SREBP pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>). In human studies, it was reported that atorvastatin at a 40-mg dose significantly elevated circulating PCSK9 protein levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>). This led to the speculation that the diminishing efficacy of statins to further reduce LDL-C levels might be caused by the induced degradation of LDLR protein by the concomitant up-regulation of PCSK9 at higher drug doses. These findings from <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> studies raised an important question as to whether <italic>PCSK9</italic> gene transcription could be separately regulated from LDLR; such a mechanism, if it existed, might be applied to inhibit <italic>PCSK9</italic> transcription to further enhance the actions of statins to lower plasma cholesterol through their effect on LDLR transcription. This could, for example lead to a lower and more effective dose of the statins and reduce the chance of unwanted side effects.</p><p>Recently, several studies have reported the inhibition of <italic>PCSK9</italic> transcription by small molecules. In immortalized human hepatocytes, activation of PPAR&#x003b1; by various fibrates decreased PCSK9 mRNA and protein levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>). Co-incubation of fenofibrate acid with statins also significantly impaired the induction of PCSK9 protein expression by pravastatin. This effect was further confirmed at the transcriptional level by showing that fenofibrate repressed the wild-type <italic>PCSK9</italic> promoter activity alone and with pravastatin. However, this study did not further address whether SRE is the sole cis-acting element responsible for this repression. In another report, it was shown that activation of farnesoid X receptor by chenodeoxycholic acid, a bile acid, or by a farnesoid X receptor synthetic agonist repressed PCSK9 expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>). Similar to the effects of fibrates, coadministration of chenodeoxycholic acid counteracted the statin-induced PCSK9 expression, leading to a potentiation of LDLR ligand uptake activity. The observation that chenodeoxycholic acid treatment did not change PCSK9 mRNA half-life suggested a transcriptional regulation by an unknown mechanism.</p><p>Our laboratory has previously demonstrated that the natural cholesterol-lowering compound berberine (BBR) up-regulates LDLR expression through a post-transcriptional mechanism of mRNA stabilization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29"/>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>). Interestingly, it was recently reported that BBR also exerts inhibitory effects on the expression of PCSK9 protein and mRNA in HepG2 cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>). Thus, BBR could have dual actions on LDLR metabolism by prolonging its mRNA half-life as well as directly increasing the protein abundance through the blockage of PCSK9-mediated degradation. This would make BBR or BBR-like compounds attractive candidates for enhancing statin efficacy. Collectively, these studies provided evidence for divergent regulation of <italic>PCSK9</italic> transcription from statins and warranted further investigations at the promoter level to fully characterize the regulatory mechanisms involved in <italic>PCSK9</italic> transcription by BBR or other non-statin small molecules.</p><p>In the initial study of <italic>PCSK9</italic> promoter, a computer-aided sequence analysis has identified putative binding sites for NF-Y (&#x02212;613), Sp1 (&#x02212;430), and SREBPs (&#x02212;337) within a region &#x0223c;650 bp upstream from the translation start site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>). However, until this report, the SRE motif was the only proven functional cis-acting element that conferred cholesterol regulation through its interaction with SREBPs. The Sp1 binding site located 76 bp upstream of SRE was later shown to not be involved in cholesterol regulation and has a minor role in <italic>PCSK9</italic> transcription as the <italic>PCSK9</italic> promoter activity was moderately reduced when this Sp1 site was abolished (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>).</p><p>In an effort to define the BBR-responsive element on <italic>PCSK9</italic> promoter in the current study, we have identified a functional hepatocyte nuclear factor 1 (HNF1) binding site (&#x02212;386 to &#x02212;374) that is essential for <italic>PCSK9</italic> transcription as a positive regulator through its interaction predominantly with HNF1&#x003b1; and to a lesser extent with HNF1&#x003b2;. The HNF1 site appears to work cooperatively with the SRE as mutation of HNF1 reduced the sensitivity of the promoter to sterols and attenuated the effect of SREBP2 to transactivate <italic>PCSK9</italic> promoter. We further showed that the HNF1 motif along with the SRE is uniquely involved in BBR-mediated transrepression of PCSK9 as mutation of either site diminished the BBR effect.</p><p>Considering the fact that HNF1&#x003b1; is a liver-enriched transcription factor known to regulate many target genes in liver and intestine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33"/>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>) and that the HNF1 site lies within the highly conserved section between Sp1 and SRE sites and its nucleotide sequence (GTTAATGTTTAAT) is 100% conserved among human, mouse, and rat <italic>PCSK9</italic> promoters, our findings for the first time provide a mechanistic explanation for the abundant expression of PCSK9 in liver and intestine.</p><sec sec-type="methods"><title>EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES</title><sec><title/><sec><title/><sec><title>Cells and Reagents</title><p>The human hepatoma cell line HepG2 was obtained from American Type Culture Collection and cultured in minimum essential eagle medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS).

These results, combined with the data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6</xref>, showing a reduced expression of HNF1&#x003b1; in BBR-treated cells, suggest that BBR exerts an integrated action on these two transcription factors, which translates into a strong suppression <italic>PCSK9</italic> transcription synergistically.</p><fig id="F7" position="float"><label>FIGURE 7.</label><caption><p><bold>Reduction of SREBP2 protein by BBR treatment is partially responsible for reduced PCSK9 expression.</bold><italic>A</italic>, HepG2 cells were treated with BBR for 24 h at concentrations of 20 and 40 &#x003bc;<sc>m</sc>.

Whereas cholesterol and statins regulated both LDLR and PCSK9 in a coordinated manner, BBR acted to down-regulate the transcription of <italic>PCSK9</italic> while up-regulating LDLR mRNA level post-transcriptionally. This investigation led us to uncover a novel transcriptional regulatory network that modulated the expression of PCSK9, a promising new therapeutic target in LDL-C metabolism.</p><p>PCSK9, a recently discovered serine protease important in regulating the degradation of LDLR protein, is a new addition to the list of more than 30 genes whose transcription is controlled by SREBPs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>). When intracellular cholesterol levels are depleted, the mature SREBP translocates to the nucleus, where it activates <italic>PCSK9</italic> and other genes' transcription by direct binding to nonpalindromic 9-bp sterol response elements in the promoter/enhancer regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>). Although in many cases, the key SRE motifs are adjacent to Sp1 or NF-Y binding sites and SREBPs work in concert with these coactivators to induce full transactivation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38"/>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>), findings from our current study indicate that the <italic>PCSK9</italic> promoter is rather unique in this aspect. Despite the initial characterization of <italic>PCSK9</italic> promoter that identified putative NF-Y and Sp1 sites upstream of the SRE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>), both sequence motifs were later shown to not be critical for SRE function. The NF-Y site (&#x02212;613) resides 5&#x02032; outside the functional proximal promoter region, whereas mutation of the Sp1 site (&#x02212;430) modestly attenuated basal <italic>PCSK9</italic> promoter activity in a manner that was not associated with sterol suppression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>) or berberine inhibition (present study). Additional putative Sp1 sites downstream of SRE also failed to exhibit a significant impact on <italic>PCSK9</italic> transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>). These observations raised an important question as to what was the SREBP cofactor in controlling <italic>PCSK9</italic> transcription. In this current study, by conducting several different lines of investigation, we provided solid evidence to demonstrate that the HNF1 binding site adjacent to SRE is the critical regulatory sequence motif and HNF1&#x003b1; is the predominant working partner for SREBP2 in the regulation of <italic>PCSK9</italic> gene in the context of HepG2 cells.</p><p>It was previously reported that Sp1 and SRE sites, separated by &#x0223c;75 bp were perfectly conserved in the PCSK9 proximal promoter of human, mouse, and rat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>). In this study, we show that the HNF1 site residing between Sp1 and SRE is also 100% preserved in the <italic>PCSK9</italic> promoter of these three species. This underscores the importance of this &#x0223c;100 bp proximal promoter region for <italic>PCSK9</italic> gene transcription. Our promoter analysis revealed that deletion or mutation of this HNF1 site severely reduced <italic>PCSK9</italic> promoter activity to levels even below those observed with the SRE mutation. Mutation of the HNF1 site also significantly mitigated the transactivation of <italic>PCSK9</italic> promoter by nuclear SREBP2 through SRE, suggesting that these two sites work in concert. The liver-enriched trans-activator HNF1&#x003b1; shares dimerization and homeodomains with its related protein HNF1&#x003b2; and mediates sequence-specific DNA binding through the recognition of its cognate sequence 5&#x02032;-GTTAATNATTAAC-3&#x02032; located in promoter regions of the target genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>). The PCSK9-HNF1 site (GTTAATGTTTAAT) shares 11 of 13 nucleotide identities with the consensus sequence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>). To identify the proteins interacting with the PCSK9-HNF1 promoter region, we combined approaches of EMSA, ChIP, siRNA knockdown, and exogenous overexpression. Nuclear extracts of HepG2 cells formed two discrete complexes with the labeled probe of PCSK9-HNF1. Both complexes were supershifted with anti-HNF1&#x003b1; antibody, indicating HNF1&#x003b1; was a major protein in these complexes. These complexes also modestly reacted with anti-HNF1&#x003b2; antibody as evidenced by a weak supershifted band. At present, we could not conclude whether the major complex represented the homodimer of HNF1&#x003b1; and the minor one was composed of HNF1&#x003b1; and HNF1&#x003b2; as a heterodimer. Further experiments are required to clearly define the protein components within these complexes. A stronger binding of HNF1&#x003b1; compared with HNF1&#x003b2; in intact HepG2 cells was also detected by ChIP assays. Taken together, these results firmly demonstrate the specific binding of HNF1&#x003b1; to this newly defined HNF1 site on <italic>PCSK9</italic> promoter. The functional importance of this interaction is demonstrated by our siRNA transfection studies. Depletion of HNF1&#x003b1; by siRNA transfection reduced the promoter activity, endogenous mRNA, and protein expression of PCSK9 to near background levels. In comparison, siHNF1&#x003b2; transfection modestly reduced <italic>PCSK9</italic> promoter activity and mRNA expression, and caused a small reduction in PCSK9 protein expression. The less significant role of HNF1&#x003b2; on <italic>PCSK9</italic> transcription is further demonstrated by a small increase in <italic>PCSK9</italic> promoter activity in HepG2 cells after transfection of pTS-HNF1&#x003b2; as compared with a substantial increase seen in pTS-HNF1&#x003b1;-transfected cells. Based upon these results we conclude that HNF1&#x003b1; is the major form of HNF1 factors that interacts with PCSK9-HNF1 site under our experimental conditions. It is possible that HNF1&#x003b2; may have a significant role in <italic>PCSK9</italic> transcription in a different cellular context. Recently, in an integrated study of analysis of mRNA expression in <italic>Hnf1</italic>&#x003b1;<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> pancreatic islets and liver with a computational and experimental identification of HNF1&#x003b1; target genes, by conducting ChIP assays Servitja <italic>et al.</italic> showed that a promoter region containing a putative HNF1 binding motif of mouse <italic>PCSK9</italic> gene was occupied by HNF1&#x003b1; in hepatocytes isolated from wild-type liver, whereas in hepatocytes isolated from <italic>Hnf1</italic>&#x003b1;<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> liver, HNF1&#x003b2; was found to bind to this promoter region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>). This observation is consistent with our speculation that HNF1&#x003b2; could have a compensational role in <italic>PCSK9</italic> transcription under certain circumstances.</p><p>Since the discovery of PCSK9 and its implication in plasma LDL-C metabolism, different strategies have been explored to block the function of PCSK9 and its interaction with LDLR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>). In this study, through elucidation of the mechanism of BBR-mediated suppression of PCSK9 we provide new evidence to support the notion that inhibition of <italic>PCSK9</italic> expression at the transcriptional level by small molecules could be a viable means to increase LDLR expression and to minimally complement and potentially synergize with statin therapy. We showed that BBR inhibits PCSK9 mRNA and protein expression and counteracts the inducing effects of various statins. We have shown at the promoter level the inhibitory effect of BBR was partially abolished by each single mutation of SRE or HNF1 site; this led us to speculate that somehow BBR affected interactions of both SREBP and HNF1 factors to their recognition sequences. By Western blotting we showed that the amount of HNF1&#x003b1; was &#x0223c;60% less in BBR-treated cells compared with control. Similarly, the abundance of SREBP2 was modestly reduced by BBR treatment. In contrast to the moderate reductions of SREBP2 and HNF1&#x003b1;, the diminution of PCSK9 protein expression by BBR was pronounced. These data imply a synergistic effect occurred in BBR-treated cells by down-regulation of each transcription factor at modest levels. This observed synergy would be beneficial with regard to LDLR expression, because SREBP2 is absolutely required for LDLR transcription, and a strong inhibition of SREBP2 would eventually shut down LDLR expression. The facts that BBR treatment increases LDLR protein level in HepG2 cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>) and in livers of hyperlipidemic hamsters <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>) suggest that the balanced effects of BBR are in favor of LDLR expression and stability.</p><p>In summary (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Fig. 8</xref>), we have identified a highly conserved HNF1 binding site located between SRE and Sp1 site as a critical cis-regulatory sequence of <italic>PCSK9</italic> promoter. Our data suggest that the liver-enriched transcription factor HNF1&#x003b1; is the principal form of HNF1 factors that binds to the HNF1 sequence motif to stimulate <italic>PCSK9</italic> transcription. Whereas statins induce <italic>PCSK9</italic> transcription by enhancing the binding of SREBP2 to SRE-1, BBR lowers the cellular abundance of HNF1&#x003b1; and SREBP2, resulting in reduced interaction of these two critical trans-activators with their recognition sequences of <italic>PCSK9</italic> promoter and leading to a transcriptional repression. These findings may provide novel insights into developing small molecule inhibitors of PCSK9 to improve the efficacy of statins in even further reducing LDL-C by overcoming one of the feedback loops that limits LDLR expression and longevity.</p><fig id="F8" position="float"><label>FIGURE 8.</label><caption><p><bold>Depiction of human <italic>PCSK9</italic> promoter and its regulation by statin and BBR through the cis-regulatory elements and trans-acting factors.</bold> The <italic>plus sign</italic> indicates that statin induces SREBP2 to bind SRE-1 site of the <italic>PCSK9</italic> promoter to stimulate transcription.
