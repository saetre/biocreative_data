A defect in dendritic cell (DC) function has thus been suspected, but this remains a controversial issue.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and Findings</title><p>Here we show that monocyte-derived DC (MoDC) from chronically-infected patients can mature in response to TLR1/2, TLR2/6 or TLR3 ligands. In contrast, when stimulated with the TLR4 ligand LPS, MoDC from patients show a profound defect in inducing IFN&#x003b3; secretion by allogeneic T cells. This defect is not due to defective phenotypic maturation or to the presence of HCV-RNA in DC or monocytes but is correlated to reduced IL-12 secretion by DC. Restoration of DC ability to stimulate IFN&#x003b3; secretion can be obtained by blocking MEK activation in DC, indicating that MEK/ERK pathway is involved in the Th1 defect of MoDC. Monocytes from HCV patients present increased spontaneous secretion of cytokines and chemokines, especially MIP-1&#x003b2;. Addition of MIP-1&#x003b2; on healthy monocytes during differentiation results in DC that have Th1 defect characteristic of MoDC from HCV patients, suggesting that MIP-1&#x003b2; secretion by HCV monocytes participates in the Th1 defect of DC.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>Our data indicate that monocytes from HCV patients are activated in vivo. This interferes with their differentiation into DC, leading to deficient TLR4 signaling in these cells that are enable to induce a Th1 response. This specific defect is linked to the activation of the MEK/ERK pathway.</p></sec></abstract><counts><page-count count="10"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is a single-stranded RNA virus classified in the Flaviviridae virus family by sequence homology <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002260-Choo1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002260-Miller1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>. HCV infection is a major public health problem since 200 millions people are infected worldwide.

In chronically infected patients, HCV often resists to clearance even after repeated antiviral treatments. Thus, the virus may have evolved strategies to escape the immune surveillance.</p><p>Several groups have reported that monocyte-derived DC (MoDC) from HCV chronically-infected patients have impaired allostimulatory capacities <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002260-AuffermannGretzinger1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002260-Tsubouchi2">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>, however this was challenged by other groups showing that MoDC from chronically-infected patients could phenotypically and functionally mature <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002260-Longman1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002260-Piccioli1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>. Since the patients appear immunologically competent, major dysfunction of dendritic cells (DC) is not expected, rather a discrete DC function could be targeted by the virus without affecting global immunity. Recent studies reported that peripheral blood DC of chronically infected patients express less IL-12 than control cells from healthy individuals <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002260-DellaBella1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref> and a small population of circulating myeloid DC displayed an impaired response to specific toll-like receptor (TLR) stimulation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002260-RodrigueGervais1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>. These transmembrane receptors expressed by cells of innate immunity are involved in the detection of microbes and activation of signaling pathways inducing the innate immune response.</p><p>There is increasing evidence that viruses can interact with TLR signaling. Viral components can either bind to TLR and activate their signaling pathway or block TLR function by interfering with intracellular intermediates. TLR3 activation can be triggered by polyriboinosinic-polyribocytidylic acid (poly I:C), a synthetic analog of double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) generated during viral replication. Moreover, the HCV serine protease NS3/4A can specifically degrade the adaptor protein TRIF resulting in inhibition of TLR3 signaling in HeLa cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002260-Li1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>. TLR2 is also involved in the detection of viral components such as measles hemagglutinin or viruses such as human cytomegalovirus or herpes simplex virus type 1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002260-Bieback1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002260-Sato1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>. Although TLR4 is well-known for its capacity to detect bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS), this receptor can also recognize viral components such as the fusion protein from respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002260-KurtJones1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref> and the envelope protein of mouse mammary tumor virus (MMTV) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002260-Rassa1">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref>. TLR4 is important for clearing RSV infection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002260-Haynes1">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref> whereas MMTV maintenance depends on TLR4 stimulation by the virus that induces immunoregulatory IL-10 secretion <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002260-Jude1">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref>. HCV non structural proteins such as NS5A can interact with MyD88, inhibiting TLR signaling and reducing cytokine production resulting from TLR activation in macrophages <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002260-Abe1">&#x0005b;25&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>We examined the type of T cell response elicited by myeloid DC derived from blood monocytes after stimulation with different TLR ligands. Here we show that DC differentiated from monocytes of patients chronically infected by HCV present an altered TLR4-induced maturation resulting in a deficient Th1 function that can be restored by inhibition of the MEK-ERK signaling pathway. The monocytes isolated from these patients have an increased level of activation and secrete higher amounts of cytokines and chemokines especially MIP-1 &#x003b1; and &#x003b2;, that can interfere with DC functional maturation.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Patients</title><p>Blood samples were obtained from volunteers attending the Liver Unit at Necker Hospital (Paris, France).

Allogeneic T cells from healthy donors were used to assess MoDC ability to induce a Th1 or Th2 oriented response, upon activation by different TLR ligands. LPS was used as a prototype of TLR4 ligand, pIC for TLR3 stimulation, and PGN or Pam as ligands of the heterodimers TLR2/TLR6 or TLR2/TLR1 respectively. MoDC from chronically-infected patients stimulated with the TLR4 ligand LPS showed a strongly decreased ability to induce IFN&#x003b3; secretion by allogeneic T cells compared to MoDC from healthy individuals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002260-g001">figure 1A</xref>). These LPS-treated MoDC were only slightly more efficient than immature MoDC with a mean stimulation index of 1.6 compared to 24.3 for MoDC from healthy donors. This difference between MoDC from HCV and healthy individuals was statistically highly significant (p&#x0003c;0.01) using the non parametric Mann-Whitney rank test. No significant increase in Th2 cytokines such as IL-5 and IL-13 could be detected in coculture supernatants of T cells with HCV-MoDC compared with healthy MoDC (data not shown). Maturation of MoDC from HCV-infected patients stimulated by TLR2/6, TLR2/1 or TLR3 ligands yielded cells able to stimulate IFN&#x003b3; production by T cells as efficiently as MoDC from healthy individuals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002260-g001">figure 1A</xref>). Therefore HCV infection is associated with a selective Th1 defect of MoDC in the TLR4 pathway. To understand how HCV infection interferes with TLR4-induced maturation, we analyzed the phenotype and the cytokine secretion of mature cells.</p><fig id="pone-0002260-g001" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0002260.g001</object-id><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>Comparison of MoDC from chronically HCV infected patients and healthy individuals upon TLR ligands stimulation.</title><p>MoDC from healthy individuals or chronically HCV infected patients were treated at day 5 with LPS, PGN, Pam or pIC for 24h.

Without any stimulation, MoDC from HCV chronically-infected patients had the characteristics of immature DC. In response to TLR ligands, DC maturation resulted in enhanced expression of costimulation molecules (CD80, CD86, CD40), MHC class II and adhesion molecules (CD54) with similar efficiencies whether cells were derived from HCV patients or healthy donors. Differences in HLA-DR and CD86 expression levels between healthy and HCV<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> individuals are donor-dependent (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0002260.s001">figure S1</xref>). Therefore the deficient Th1 function of LPS stimulated MoDC from HCV patients could not be explained by altered expression of these surface markers of DC.</p><p>The cytokine secretion profile of mature DC participates in the orientation of the T cell response. Therefore we quantified the cytokines secreted in the supernatant of DC culture after 24 h maturation induced by the different TLR ligands. Pam or pIC-stimulated DC secreted low amounts of IL-6, TNF&#x003b1;, IL-10 and IL-12 whereas LPS or PGN-activated DC showed strong secretions of cytokines especially IL-6 and IL-12 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002260-g001">figure 1D, E</xref>). A significant difference could be observed for IL-12 secretion. Upon LPS stimulation, MoDC from chronically-infected individuals secreted lower amounts of IL-12 than MoDC from healthy individuals (p&#x0003c;0.01).

The allostimulatory defect was observed only when DC were stimulated with the TLR4 ligand LPS and not with TLR3, TLR2/6 or TLR1/2 ligands. A growing list of molecules from bacteria, viruses, and parasites can interfere with TLR4 signaling. This underlines the crucial role of TLR4 pathway in the innate recognition of pathogens but may also reveal microbial strategies evolved to facilitate infection. Physiological relevance of TLR4 signaling interference by HCV may relate to liver and intestine infection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002260-Deforges1">&#x0005b;36&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002260-Diaz1">&#x0005b;37&#x0005d;</xref>. The liver lies directly downstream of the gut and is therefore constantly exposed to antigens and microbial products derived from the intestine. The control of liver inflammation and tolerance to gut-derived antigens (food antigens and commensal bacteria) is likely to rely, at least in part, on functional characteristics of hepatic and intestinal antigen presenting cells. One of these characteristics is the modulation of TLR4 signaling under the dual pressure of protecting the host from pathogenic infections and coexistence with the myriad commensal organisms <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002260-Abreu1">&#x0005b;38&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>There are several reasons for HCV to interfere preferentially with the TLR4 pathway. This could first reflect the action of LVP on monocytes. HCV can circulate in the blood of chronically infected patients in the form of Lipo-Viro-Particles (LVP) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002260-Andre1">&#x0005b;27&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002260-Diaz1">&#x0005b;37&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002260-Andre2">&#x0005b;39&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002260-Diaz2">&#x0005b;41&#x0005d;</xref>. These particles are triglyceride-rich lipoproteins, containing viral RNA and capsids and carrying the viral envelope proteins at their surface. LVP are found in all chronically infected patients and can represent a variable proportion of the total viral load ranging from a few percent to 90 percent. They originate from both the liver and the intestine <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002260-Diaz1">&#x0005b;37&#x0005d;</xref>. We previously reported that LVP can interfere with TLR4-triggered maturation of DC, resulting in cells having a better potential to stimulate a Th2 response rather than a Th1 response of T cells. This shift of DC function did not occur upon pIC stimulation and was found to be dependent on ERK and p-38-MAPK activation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002260-Agaugue1">&#x0005b;34&#x0005d;</xref>. Although MoDC from HCV patients did not acquire a Th2 function, one intriguing possibility is that LVP could interact with blood monocytes and modify their capacities to differentiate into DC. The impact of LVP on blood monocytes remains to be analyzed but it could be mediated either by the viral material carried by the particle or by its lipid contain. It was previously shown that HCV E2 envelope protein can induce ERK and p-38-MAPK signaling in human T cells via both CD81 and Low-Density Lipoprotein Receptor <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002260-Zhao1">&#x0005b;42&#x0005d;</xref>. LVP could also contain modified lipids that could activate ERK or alter lipid raft distribution, thus inhibiting subsequent LPS maturation of DC ex vivo <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002260-Lupo1">&#x0005b;43&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002260-Walton2">&#x0005b;46&#x0005d;</xref>. It has been shown recently that lipoproteins from HCV patients induced some modifications of lipid synthesis in human monocyte-derived macrophages <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002260-Napolitano1">&#x0005b;47&#x0005d;</xref>. LVP could thus interfere with TLR4 signaling by modifying the lipid composition of the plasma membrane of monocytes. Among other possibilities, the induction of Th1 responses can be inhibited by polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA), possibly by insertion in the membrane <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002260-Zeyda1">&#x0005b;48&#x0005d;</xref>. PUFA are known to be agonists of PPAR&#x003b3; and we have previously shown that activating PPAR&#x003b3; in DC can inhibit their functional maturation, leading to phenotypically mature DC unable to induce a Th1 response of T cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002260-Coutant1">&#x0005b;49&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>In MoDC from HCV patients, TLR4 signaling remains functional since the ability of DC to induce IFN&#x003b3; secretion by T cells can be restored by treatment with the MEK inhibitor 24 h prior to LPS maturation. The RAS/MEK/ERK pathway is involved in the regulation of differentiation in many cell types. However, the function of this pathway depends on the cell type, the differentiation stage of the cell and the type of stimulation of the receptor. Interestingly, ERK phosphorylation is involved in the inhibition of the B cell response to TLR4 agonist LPS <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002260-Rui1">&#x0005b;50&#x0005d;</xref>. We previously observed that an increased phosphorylation of p38 and ERK MAP-kinases and a sustained activation of the transcription factor c-Fos were correlated to a Th2 shift of DC function <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002260-Agaugue2">&#x0005b;35&#x0005d;</xref>. In this model of functional shift induced by 1-methyl-tryptophan, we found that ERK inhibition could restore the ability of DC to stimulate IFN&#x003b3; secretion by T cells. This was also the case for DC generated from HCV patients as shown here. This result strongly suggests that monocytes isolated from the blood of these patients present some modifications resulting in a deregulation of ERK phosphorylation. This dysfunction can be due either to a positive stimulation of the MEK/ERK pathway or to the absence of negative regulation by phosphatases such as the dual-specific phosphatases (DUSP) that oppose the action of MEK by dephosphorylating ERK. This latter mechanism has been observed for TLR4-induced plasma cell differentiation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002260-Rui1">&#x0005b;50&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>The deficient response to LPS stimulation of MoDC points at an alteration of the monocytes isolated from HCV patients. This defect is not correlated to the amount of HCV-RNA detected in monocytes. The low content of viral RNA in these cells (less than 4 copies for 10<sup>3</sup> cells) is in favor of a role of environmental factors affecting monocytes function. No or trace amounts of HCV-RNA remained in differentiated DC indicating that they probably did not present HCV peptides. In consequence, these cells should not specifically display an HCV-specific defect in term of antigen presentation and activation of HCV-specific T cells. We also found that the addition of IFN&#x003b1; 24h prior induction of maturation by LPS slightly improved the ability of DC differentiated from monocytes of 4 out of 6 HCV infected patients, to stimulate IFN&#x003b3; secretion by T cells (data not shown). This weak restoration of the TLR4 stimulation efficiency is thus independent of the antiviral effect of IFN&#x003b1; and probably relate to signaling events triggered by IFN&#x003b1;.</p><p>Monocytes from HCV patients can respond to LPS stimulation, secreting cytokines and chemokines with an efficiency similar to that of control monocytes. Desensitization of these cells to LPS can therefore be excluded. However, we observed that monocytes from HCV patients had an elevated basal activation state compared to monocytes from healthy donors. HCV-monocytes secreted higher levels of cytokines and chemokines among which, MIP-1 &#x003b1; and &#x003b2;. DC differentiated from healthy monocytes in the presence of MIP-1&#x003b2;, displayed a similar Th1 defect after LPS stimulation than MoDC from HCV patients. This defect could be overcome by inhibition of the ERK pathway. Addition of anti-MIP-1 antibodies during differentiation of MoDC from HCV patients tend to restore the ability of these cells to stimulate a Th1 response (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0002260.s002">Figure S2</xref>). The MIP-1 &#x003b1; and &#x003b2; chemokines are found in higher amounts in the blood of HCV patients <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002260-Lichterfeld1">&#x0005b;51&#x0005d;</xref> and can both stimulate the CCR5 receptor. Although the mechanism involving the ERK pathway remains to be determined, ERK hyperactivation could result from CCR5 stimulation by MIP-1 as it was previously described for human macrophages <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002260-Tomkowicz1">&#x0005b;52&#x0005d;</xref>.
