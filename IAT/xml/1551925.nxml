Epidermal cells in a given embryonic segment display a stereotyped pattern of two distinct morphological fates: cells with a smooth apical surface, which generate naked cuticle, and cells producing actin-rich cytoplasmic extensions, which eventually become the mature larval microtrichiae or trichomes, generally called denticles (ventral) and hairs (dorsal).</p><p>In the ventral region of the abdomen, each segment possesses six to seven rows of pigmented denticles, which are involved in locomotion. Activation of the Wingless (Wg) pathway determines the naked fate &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040290-b006">6</xref>&#x0005d;, whereas activation of the d-EGF-receptor (DER) pathway promotes denticle formation &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040290-b007">7</xref>&#x0005d;.

DER activates <italic>svb</italic> transcription in denticle-forming cells, whereas Wg acts as a repressor in the naked territories (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040290-g001">Figure 1</xref>A), leading to the precise expression of <italic>svb</italic> in denticle cells. In turn, <italic>svb</italic> is required for denticle formation, since <italic>svb</italic> mutants display essentially naked cuticle.

Although different mechanisms specify morphological fates in the dorsal epidermis &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040290-b015">15</xref>&#x0005d;, <italic>svb</italic> is required for the formation of dorsal hairs as it is for denticles.

Somewhat surprisingly, given the large number of genes that are theoretically capable of modifying dorsal hair patterning &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040290-b001">1</xref>&#x0005d;, all cases of dorsal hair&#x02013;pattern evolution examined in dipterans are the consequence of the modification of <italic>svb</italic> expression only &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040290-b016">16</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040290-b018">18</xref>&#x0005d;. Thus, developmental and evolutionary studies show that <italic>svb</italic> is critical for epidermal differentiation and that the presence/absence of <italic>svb</italic> expression ultimately determines the pattern of denticles and dorsal hairs &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040290-b019">19</xref>&#x0005d;.</p><p>How does <italic>svb</italic> control the formation of denticles and dorsal hairs during epidermal differentiation? Little is known about the cellular mechanisms underlying trichome formation. Epidermal cells are highly polarized along the apico-basal axis, with actin microfilaments accumulating at the cell cortex where they interact with apical junction complexes &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040290-b020">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040290-b021">21</xref>&#x0005d;. The formation of denticles and dorsal hairs is initiated by F-actin accumulation and reorganization, leading to the production of an apical bundle in the posterior region of the cell &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040290-b014">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040290-b022">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040290-b023">23</xref>&#x0005d;.

At later stages, ecdysteroid hormones induce epidermal cells to synthesize components of the cuticular envelopes, which are modified by the catecholamine biosynthetic pathway to ensure trichome pigmentation and hardening &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040290-b024">24</xref>&#x0005d;.

We identified several cellular factors involved directly in subsequent steps of denticle formation. Although actin remodeling is generally regarded as the outcome of post-translational modifications, we show that denticle formation relies on the <italic>svb</italic>-dependent transcriptional activation of several factors involved in microfilament formation or bundling. We provide evidence that <italic>svb</italic> directly controls the transcription of <italic>miniature (m),</italic> which encodes a membrane protein containing a Zona Pellucida (ZP) domain, and we show that <italic>m</italic> is required for the membrane/cuticle interaction in the denticle. We also identified a <italic>svb</italic> target responsible for denticle pigmentation, therefore demonstrating that <italic>svb</italic> coordinates several aspects of denticle differentiation. Finally we show that <italic>svb</italic> regulates the same set of genes for the formation of dorsal hairs and suggest that the evolution of the dorsal hairs pattern in <named-content content-type="genus-species">D. sechellia</named-content> results from the concerted modification of the expression of cellular effectors regulated by <italic>svb</italic>.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title><italic>svb</italic> Directs <italic>m</italic> Expression in the Embryonic Epidermis</title><p>As a first step towards identifying players involved in denticle formation, we searched for genes expressed in epidermal cells by conducting a systematic survey of expression patterns available from the Berkeley Drosophila Genome Project &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040290-b027">27</xref>&#x0005d; and the literature (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0040290-st001">Table S1</xref>). Among the approximately 400 genes reported to be transcribed in the epidermis, we found that only a small number (&#x0003c;10&#x00025;) are expressed in a segmentally repeated pattern, at a time of epidermal cells morphological differentiation. We further analyzed the epidermal expression of these genes by in situ hybridization and tested for its dependence on <italic>svb</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0040290-st001">Table S1</xref>). We first focused on <italic>m</italic> &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040290-b028">28</xref>&#x0005d;, because its expression in stage-15 embryos strikingly resembles the trichome pattern, which is specified by <italic>svb</italic> at previous stages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040290-g001">Figure 1</xref>B).</p><p>We found that <italic>m</italic> expression in epidermal cells is abolished in <italic>svb</italic> mutant embryos (Figure1B), showing that <italic>svb</italic> is required for <italic>m</italic> transcription in the epidermis. Detailed examination (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040290-g001">Figure 1</xref>C) revealed a precise correlation between <italic>m</italic> expression and the denticle pattern in wild-type embryos, with a six to seven&#x02013;cell-wide expression stripe in each segment that alternates with a band of <italic>m</italic>-negative cells. OvoA is a germinal isoform of the <italic>ovo</italic>/<italic>svb</italic> gene that acts as a transcriptional repressor &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040290-b013">13</xref>&#x0005d;, able to counteract <italic>svb</italic> activity when its expression is artificially directed in the epidermis &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040290-b013">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040290-b014">14</xref>&#x0005d;. When expressed in <italic>ptc</italic>-expressing cells (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040290-g001">Figure 1</xref>A), OvoA leads to the replacement of denticle rows 2 and 3 by a stripe of naked cuticle interrupting each denticle belt (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040290-g001">Figure 1</xref>C). This OvoA expression also represses <italic>m</italic> transcription in the epidermal cells corresponding to denticle rows 2 and 3, providing evidence that <italic>svb</italic> activity is required cell autonomously for <italic>m</italic> expression in denticle cells. To test whether <italic>svb</italic> is sufficient to induce <italic>m</italic> expression in the epidermis, we examined the consequence of the ectopic expression of <italic>svb</italic> in smooth cells. Ectopic expression of <italic>svb</italic> in <italic>wg</italic>-expressing cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040290-g001">Figure 1</xref>A) causes the formation of a supernumerary row of cuticular extensions and leads to an ectopic stripe of <italic>m</italic> expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040290-g001">Figure 1</xref>C), showing that <italic>svb</italic> is sufficient to trigger <italic>m</italic> transcription in epidermal cells.</p><p>As the evolutionary loss of dorsal trichomes in <named-content content-type="genus-species">D. sechellia</named-content> embryos is the result of the restriction of <italic>svb</italic> expression to narrow stripes in dorsal epidermal cells &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040290-b016">16</xref>&#x0005d;, we asked whether <italic>m</italic> expression was modified accordingly in <named-content content-type="genus-species">D. sechellia</named-content>.

These data thus bring independent support to the conclusion that <italic>m</italic> expression is controlled by <italic>svb</italic> in the embryonic epidermis and show that this regulation has been evolutionarily conserved.</p><p>All together, our results demonstrate that <italic>svb</italic> activity is necessary and sufficient to control <italic>m</italic> expression specifically in epidermal cells producing denticle and dorsal hairs.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Shavenbaby Directly Controls Miniature Transcription</title><p>To investigate whether <italic>svb</italic> directly regulates <italic>m</italic> expression, we first attempted to identify <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory elements directing <italic>m</italic> transcription in the embryonic epidermis.</p><p>We generated transgenic lines in which a reporter gene is placed under the control of a 6-kilobase (kb) genomic region encompassing the <italic>m</italic> transcriptional start site (6Kmin) (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040290-g002">Figure 2</xref>A). These 6Kmin reporter transgenes faithfully reproduce <italic>m</italic> expression in late embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040290-g002">Figure 2</xref>B and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040290-g002">2</xref>C) and display a similar dependence on <italic>svb</italic> activity (unpublished data). Deletion of most intronic sequences to a 3-kb fragment leads to a strong diminution of the expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040290-g002">Figure 2</xref>D), showing that <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory elements required for <italic>m</italic> epidermal expression are located in intronic regions. We focused on a 0.4-kb region from the second <italic>m</italic> intron, which is highly conserved in Drosophilidae (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040290-g002">Figure 2</xref>A). This fragment, when placed upstream of a minimal promoter, promotes a robust expression in the epidermis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040290-g002">Figure 2</xref>E), similar to that of the endogenous <italic>m</italic> gene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040290-g002">Figure 2</xref>B&#x02013;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040290-g002">2</xref>H). Expression of 0.4Kmin lines is lost in a <italic>svb</italic> mutant background (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040290-g002">Figure 2</xref>F), whereas an additional stripe of expression appears when <italic>svb</italic> is ectopically expressed in smooth cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040290-g002">Figure 2</xref>G). Therefore, this 0.4-kb region of the <italic>m</italic> gene behaves as a <italic>svb</italic>-responsive element, able to drive epidermal expression under the control of <italic>svb</italic>.</p><p>We then assayed the ability of the Svb protein to bind in vitro to the corresponding DNA region. Gel retardation assays showed that the recombinant Svb protein binds specifically to the 0.4-kb <italic>m</italic> element through a single region, further refined to a 200-base pair (bp) fragment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040290-g002">Figure 2</xref>I). Sequence analysis revealed the presence of a nucleotide motif matching (7/7) the consensus binding site previously defined for Ovo proteins &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040290-b029">29</xref>&#x0005d;, which share the same DNA binding domain with Svb &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040290-b012">12</xref>&#x0005d;. Additional DNA-binding experiments showed that Svb binds to this predicted site with a high affinity (estimated Kd &#x0003d; 2.5 &#x000b1; &#x02212;0.8 nM, unpublished data). The sequence of this Svb binding site on the <italic>m</italic> enhancer (at position chrX:11487686, on the genomic scaffold) is conserved in all sequenced <italic>Drosophila</italic> species. Introduction of point mutations that substitute two invariant nucleotides found in all Ovo binding sites &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040290-b029">29</xref>&#x0005d; eliminates Svb binding in vitro (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040290-g002">Figure 2</xref>I), showing that Svb interacts specifically with the <italic>m</italic> enhancer through this single binding-site. To test the consequence of preventing Svb binding in vivo, we introduced these two mutations into the 0.4-kb enhancer construct and generated corresponding transgenic lines (0.4KminKO). All the tested 0.4KminKO lines (12) lost <italic>m</italic>-like epidermal expression, with only some variable residual staining, variable from line to line (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040290-g002">Figure 2</xref>J).</p><p>These results demonstrate that Svb binds to an evolutionarily conserved element of the <italic>m</italic> gene, which behaves as a <italic>svb</italic>-responsive enhancer in the embryonic epidermis.

This prompted us to analyze the embryonic expression of these genes, as well as additional actors in actin remodeling <italic>(chickadee, gelsolin,</italic> and <italic>twinstar)</italic>. All exhibit ubiquitous expression in embryos, which is not influenced by <italic>svb</italic> activity (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0040290-st001">Table S1</xref>).

These defects are likely due to the lack of activation of the Arp2/3 complex, since the zygotic inactivation of two ubiquitous Arp2/3 subunits (ArcP34 and ArcP41) causes denticle alterations similar to those observed in <italic>wsp</italic> mutants (unpublished data).</p><p>Consistent with the idea that actin reorganization is required for denticle formation, our results show that Svb activates the expression of a subset of genes controlling actin dynamics, whose individual inactivation produces defects in denticle morphology.</p></sec><sec id="s2e"><title><italic>svb</italic>-Regulated Genes Functionally Collaborate in Denticle Formation</title><p>Inactivation of each <italic>svb</italic> target we identified leads to specific defects in the morphology of denticles, but is not sufficient to inhibit their formation. This suggests either that these genes are involved in nonessential aspects of denticle formation (e.g., fine shaping) or, alternatively, that denticle formation relies on the collective activity of numerous effectors, none of them being absolutely indispensable. To discriminate between these possibilities, we analyzed embryos carrying combinations of mutations in different <italic>svb</italic> targets.</p><p>The phenotype of <italic>sn, f</italic> double mutants is slightly aggravated when compared to that of <italic>sn</italic> or <italic>f</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0040290-st002">Table S2</xref>). When <italic>m</italic> mutation is combined with either <italic>sn</italic> or <italic>f,</italic> denticles display both the crooked extremities found in <italic>sn</italic> and <italic>f,</italic> and the defects characteristic of <italic>m</italic>. In addition, the inactivation of <italic>m</italic> and <italic>f</italic> (or <italic>sn</italic>) causes denticle splitting, as revealed by a significant increase in the number of abnormal denticles per row (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0040290-st002">Table S2</xref>). Simultaneous inactivation of all three genes leads to small and highly misshapen denticles that are more affected than in double mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040290-g005">Figure 5</xref>A and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0040290-st002">Table S2</xref>). Adding a fourth mutation, <italic>wsp</italic> or <italic>sha,</italic> further impairs the formation of denticles, leading in many cases to their replacement by naked regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040290-g005">Figure 5</xref>A). The cumulated inactivation of <italic>svb</italic> targets thus progressively leads to tiny and highly malformed denticles, ending in the inhibition of denticle formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040290-g005">Figure 5</xref>A). A similar effect is observed in the dorsal region, where combining mutations in <italic>svb</italic> targets ultimately prevents dorsal hair formation, in addition to producing cumulative morphological defects (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040290-g005">Figure 5</xref>B). These results demonstrate that the morphological differentiation of the embryonic epidermis requires the concerted action of multiple genes, all playing a direct role in the formation both of denticles and dorsal hairs.</p><p>To better understand the role of <italic>svb</italic> targets, we analyzed the subcellular distribution of Singed, Forked, and Miniature proteins at the onset of denticle formation. Forked, Singed, and Miniature are sequentially accumulated in denticle cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0040290-sg001">Figure S1</xref>) and, consistent with their bundling activity, both Singed and Forked co-localize with F-actin in growing denticles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040290-g006">Figure 6</xref>A). Forked accumulates in nascent denticles, from the earliest steps of F-actin reorganization, whereas Singed appears slightly later, when the apical bundle is already formed and is continuing to grow. Miniature appears concomitantly with Singed and is initially detected in the cytoplasm of denticle cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0040290-sg001">Figure S1</xref>). In later embryos (stage 15 and 16), Miniature accumulates in a restricted apical domain that underlines the base of each denticle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040290-g006">Figure 6</xref>A). Since Miniature is a membrane protein, this observation suggests the existence of a denticle-specific membrane subdomain. We therefore analyzed mutant defects at the ultrastructural level. In stage 16 wild-type embryos, the apical surface of epidermal cells organizes a dense array of microvilli that contact the cuticle only at their distal tips (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040290-g006">Figure 6</xref>B). In contrast, there is a continuous and tight interaction between plasma membrane and cuticle layers in the denticle region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040290-g006">Figure 6</xref>B). Although naked cells are unaffected, denticle cells do not contact cuticle correctly in <italic>m</italic> mutant embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040290-g006">Figure 6</xref>B). The apical membrane is disorganized, with an abnormal gap between the denticle membrane and cuticle layers, indicating that <italic>m</italic> is required for the membrane/cuticle interaction that is specific to denticle cells. These defects are not observed in <italic>sn, f</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040290-g006">Figure 6</xref>B), confirming that they are specific to the lack of <italic>m</italic> activity.</p><p>Therefore, these data reveal that denticle formation requires, besides actin remodeling, a specific modification of the membrane/cuticle interaction that is directly dependent on the localized activity of Miniature.

Miniature is a single-pass membrane protein, with a short cytoplasmic tail and a large extracellular region that contains a conserved Zona Pellucida (ZP) domain &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040290-b028">28</xref>&#x0005d;.

We show that Miniature is required for the correct formation of denticles, revealing a novel aspect of ZP protein function in the formation of polarized cellular extensions. The absence of <italic>m</italic> severely impairs the interaction between the plasma membrane and cuticle layers in denticle cells, a defect likely due to a disorganization of the extracellular matrix.

It is also possible that other regulators modulate the response to <italic>svb</italic> (cf. the weak expression of <italic>f</italic> and <italic>wsp</italic> in naked cells expressing ectopically <italic>svb,</italic> when compared to that of <italic>sn, m, sha</italic> and <italic>y</italic>). Finally, upstream signaling pathways certainly contribute to the sculpting of each kind of trichome through the regulation of the expression and/or activities of cellular effectors. Recent studies have shown that members of the planar polarity pathway (PCP) are indeed involved in defining denticle polarity in response to signaling pathways &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040290-b023">23</xref>&#x0005d;. Interestingly, one of the identified <italic>svb</italic> targets, <italic>shavenoid,</italic> has recently been reported to interact with PCP in the adult wing, raising the possibility that such a dialog also occurs during embryonic epidermal cell remodeling. <italic>svb</italic> thus appears to govern a morphological module responsible for the major switch from smooth surface to trichome, the precise shape of which is finely sculptured by independent intrinsic factors and activities.</p></sec><sec id="s3d"><title>Evolutionary Perspectives</title><p>The pattern of trichomes has been modified several times during the evolution of insects. Across the genus <italic>Drosophila,</italic> at least four independent evolutionary transitions have led to the loss (to various extents) of dorsal hairs. Nevertheless, evolution of the pattern of dorsal hairs and denticles results from the modification of <italic>svb</italic> expression in all studied cases &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040290-b017">17</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040290-b019">19</xref>&#x0005d;. Although the expression of patterning genes is unchanged in all species examined &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040290-b042">42</xref>&#x0005d;, the difference in the dorsal hair pattern between <named-content content-type="genus-species">D. melanogaster</named-content> and <named-content content-type="genus-species">D. sechellia</named-content> is due only to the modification of <italic>shavenbaby</italic>'s response to signaling pathways &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040290-b016">16</xref>&#x0005d;. Our analysis further shows that the restriction of <italic>svb</italic> expression in <named-content content-type="genus-species">D. sechellia</named-content> embryos causes, in turn, the restriction of the dorsal expression of <italic>m, sn, f, sha,</italic> and <italic>wsp</italic> genes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0040290-sg002">Figure S2</xref>). Therefore, all these <italic>svb</italic> targets display a concerted modification of their expression in <italic>D. sechellia,</italic> bringing additional evidence that together they constitute a developmental module. Consistent with this interpretation, we show that individual inactivation, or experimental modifications of the expression, of any of the <italic>svb</italic> target genes identified so far are not sufficient to modify the trichome pattern. These data indicate that denticle formation requires multiple factors that act collectively to remodel epidermal cell shape. This requirement for many genes to build a cuticular extension doubtless constitutes a developmental constraint, explaining why modifications of the expression of <italic>svb,</italic> the factor that governs this entire set of genes, are required for the trichome pattern to evolve.</p><p>Evolutionary modifications of <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory elements of <italic>lin-48,</italic> the putative <italic>svb</italic> homolog in worms, were responsible for the difference in the position of the excretory duct between <named-content content-type="genus-species">Caenorhabditis elegans</named-content> and <named-content content-type="genus-species">C. briggsae</named-content> &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040290-b043">43</xref>&#x0005d;. Although accumulated data thus demonstrate the particular role of <italic>svb</italic> genes in morphological diversification between relatively close species, how they are related to the evolution of animal forms across more distant phyla remains an open question. Several features of <italic>svb</italic> function have been conserved in mammals, including the role of one of its homologs, <italic>m-ovo1,</italic> in the differentiation of epidermal derivatives &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040290-b044">44</xref>&#x0005d; and its regulation by the Wnt pathway &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040290-b045">45</xref>&#x0005d;. Our identification of genes regulated by <italic>svb</italic> in flies now opens the way to evaluate the contribution of the different parameters contributing to the role of <italic>svb</italic> in morphological evolution, from the modification of its response to signaling pathways to that of its cellular targets.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Fly strains and transgenic constructs.</title><p>We used <italic>UAS-svb; UAS-ovoA; Ptc-Gal4; Wg-Gal4; svb<sup>1</sup>; btd<sup>1</sup>, svb<sup>1</sup>; svbR9; w,m<sup>1</sup>; sn<sup>3</sup>; f<sup>3</sup>; f<sup>5</sup>; f<sup>36a</sup>; sha<sup>1</sup>; sha<sup>V15</sup>; sn<sup>3</sup>,f<sup>36a</sup>; m<sup>1</sup>,f<sup>36a</sup>; m<sup>1</sup>,sn<sup>3</sup>; m<sup>1</sup>,sn<sup>3</sup>, f<sup>36a</sup>; wsp<sup>1</sup>; wsp<sup>3</sup>; m<sup>1</sup>,sn<sup>3</sup>, f<sup>36a</sup>; m<sup>1</sup>,sn<sup>3</sup>, f<sup>36a</sup>;sha<sup>1</sup>; m<sup>1</sup>,sn<sup>3</sup>,f<sup>36a</sup>;sha<sup>V15</sup>; m<sup>1</sup>,sn<sup>3</sup>, f<sup>36a</sup>;wsp<sup>3</sup>; w, Df(1)m-MR; P(EP)EP345,</italic> and a <italic>w D. sechellia</italic> stock from the D.

Embryos triple mutant for <italic>m, sn,</italic> and <italic>f</italic> display an aggravated phenotype with respect to each simple mutant or double mutant. This leads to poorly differentiated denticles, which display an extremely thin tip and a small triangular base. In addition, the lateral spacing of mutant denticles is reduced, a consequence of denticle splitting with two tiny extensions side by side. The combined inactivation of <italic>sn, f, m,</italic> and <italic>wsp</italic> further increases the severity of mutant phenotypes, producing very small and highly abnormal denticles. Similarly, in embryos simultaneously lacking <italic>sn, f, m,</italic> and <italic>sha,</italic> the few remaining extensions are atrophic, and numerous denticles are replaced by naked cuticle.</p><p>(B) <italic>svb</italic> downstream targets are required for dorsal hair formation. The dorsal region of a wild-type abdominal segment displays a stereotyped arrangement of epidermal extensions presenting a specific morphology: a row of large trichomes pointing anteriorly, a stripe of naked cuticle, three rows of extensions of intermediate size, and several rows of thin hairs. The cumulated inactivation of <italic>svb</italic> targets profoundly impairs dorsal hair formation. Hairs that display the superimposition of single mutant phenotypes are thickened <italic>(m)</italic>, crooked <italic>(sn, f)</italic> and split <italic>(f, wsp, sha)</italic>. In <italic>sn<sup>3</sup>, f<sup>36a</sup>, m<sup>1</sup></italic> triple mutants, dorsal hairs are severely reduced in size and, in several cases, the formation of dorsal hair is abrogated, leaving abnormal naked regions, as best seen in the first row of trichomes. These phenotypes are even more pronounced following the combination with <italic>wsp</italic> mutation, and culminate in embryos lacking <italic>m, sn, f,</italic> and <italic>sha,</italic> where most dorsal hairs are absent and replaced by naked cuticle. In some cases, atrophic dorsal hairs are seen as duplicated spots, revealing hair splitting as observed in <italic>sha</italic> and <italic>f</italic> embryos.

The Shavenbaby transcription factor triggers in turn the expression of different classes of genes encoding cellular effectors. They are directly involved in distinct aspects of trichome formation, including the reorganization of actin <italic>(singed, forked, wasp,</italic> and <italic>shavenoid)</italic>, extracellular matrix <italic>(m)</italic> and cuticle <italic>(y)</italic>, likely through modifying the activity of ubiquitous cellular machineries. Additional cytoskeletal factors or regulators (independent of <italic>svb</italic>) might be required for the fine sculpturing of each kind of trichome, characteristic of a given body region.
