Immunoreactivities for cav-1 and for cav-2 were co-localized in the cell membrane of the basal cells and basolaterally in the ciliated epithelial cells of large airways of rat and human. However, no labeling for cav-1 or cav-2 was observed in the epithelial cells of small bronchi. Using conventional double-labeling indirect immunofluorescence combined with CLSM-FRET analysis, we detected an association of cav-1&#x003b1; and -2 in epithelial cells. The presence of caveolae was confirmed by electron microscopy. In contrast to human and rat, cav-1-immunoreactivity and caveolae were confined to basal cells in mice. Epithelial caveolae were absent in cav-1-deficient mice, implicating a requirement of this caveolar protein in epithelial caveolae formation.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>These results show that caveolae and caveolins are integral membrane components in basal and ciliated epithelial cells, indicating a crucial role in these cell types.

They are found in numerous cell types such as type I pneumocytes, endothelial cells, adipocytes, fibroblasts, smooth muscle cells, cardiac and striated muscle cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Caveolar formation is dependent on the expression of caveolins. Three caveolins (cav) are known. Cav-1 and cav-2 are widely expressed, whereas cav-3 is thought to be restricted to muscle cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Cav-1 is expressed in two isoforms, cav-1&#x003b1; and cav-1&#x003b2;, exhibiting a cell type-specific distribution (endothelial vs. alveolar type-1 cells) in the alveolar region [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>].</p><p>Caveolae are involved in diverse cellular functions such as organizing signal transduction mechanisms, endocytosis and intracellular transport [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Several pathogenic microorganisms selectively use caveolae to enter cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. After accumulation in the caveolae, they are delivered to the endoplasmatic reticulum bypassing the classical endosome-lysosome trafficking and thereby preventing inactivation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. It has been shown that the infectivity of C-type human adenovirus can be greatly reduced by the expression of a dominant negative cav-1 mutant in plasmocytic cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>], indicating that caveolae are involved in this process. In addition, it was recently shown for Chlamydia pneumoniae that it co-localizes intracellularly with cav-1 and cav-2 after infection, and a role of these proteins for the developmental cycle of Chlamydiae is discussed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. Also, the human coronavirus 229E that is known to induce respiratory tract infections enters cells via a caveolae dependent mechanism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>].</p><p>Although the airway epithelium serves as entry site for microbes, fulfils functions that are associated with caveolae such as endo- and transcytosis, and harbors receptors that are associated with caveolae [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>], the expression of caveolins, their interaction, and the presence of caveolae in tracheal and bronchial epithelial cells have not yet been determined. Interestingly, the presence of "vesicles that sometimes are connected with the membrane" has earlier been described at the electron-microscopic level in mouse basal cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. Moreover cav-1 and cav-2 were detected in cell lines derived from bronchial epithelium [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>], pointing to the presence of caveolae in the airway epithelium.</p><p>Both cav-1 and cav-2 exhibit a similar expression, but seem to have different functions. Cav-1 is sufficient to drive caveolar formation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. In general, it is thought that cav-2 alone is not sufficient for caveolae formation, and the absence of caveolae in cav-1-deficient mice is associated with marked reduction in cav-2 levels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. In contrast, although caveolae are still present in cav-2 deficient mice, these mice show the marked pathological alveolar phenotype of cav-1 deficient mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. This indicates that cav-2, although not able to form caveolae on its own, has profound influences on caveolar function. Since a selective association of cav-2 but not cav-1 was described with Chlamydia species other than Chlamydia pneumoniae it is likely that both proteins can have divergent functions during infectious processes making it necessary to examine the presence and localization of both proteins.</p><p>In view of these facts, it is pivotal to gain insight in the cellular expression of caveolae and caveolins in bronchial and tracheal epithelium. We therefore examined the expression of cav-1 and cav-2 on the mRNA and protein level, determined the distribution of cav-1&#x003b1;, cav-1&#x003b2;, and cav-2 by immunohistochemistry and examined the presence of caveolae by electron microscopy. To address the molecular composition of caveolae, we determined the molecular association of cav-1&#x003b1; and cav-2 in tracheal epithelial cells in tissue sections by double-labeling indirect immunofluorescence combined with confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) and fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) analysis.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Animals</title><p>This study was performed on 1) Wistar rats (150&#x02013;250 g) of either sex, kept either under standard laboratory conditions or under specified pathogen-free (SPF) conditions, and 2) cav-1-deficient mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>] and the corresponding C57/Bl6 wild-type mice that were kept under SPF conditions.

After incubation of the protein solutions at 4&#x000b0;C for 1 h, they were centrifugedfor 5 min at 14,000 rpm. Equal amounts of proteins for each tissue were applied as judged by staining of gels with Simply BlueTM Safe Stain (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, USA) stained gels. Ten &#x003bc;l appropriately diluted protein solution and 2 &#x003bc;l of 5 &#x000d7; sample buffer (320 mM Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 5% SDS, 50% glycerol, 0.25 mg/ml bromphenol blue and 1% &#x003b2;-2-mercaptoethanol) were boiled for 5 min at 95&#x000b0;C. The samples were subjected to 15% SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions and subsequently transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane (Bio-Rad) by semidry blotting. The nitrocellulose membranes were stained with Ponceau S to confirm the protein transfer from the gels to the membrane. After subsequent washing in 25 mM Tris-buffered saline with 0.05% Tween-20 (TTBS), the unspecific binding sites were saturated by incubation with 10% non-fat dry milk in TTBS for1 h at room temperature. The membrane was incubated overnight at 4&#x000b0;C with anti-cav-1&#x003b1;, -1&#x003b1;&#x003b2; and -2, primary antibodies, diluted in 5% non-fat dry milk in TTBS. The secondary antibodies were diluted in 2.5% non-fat dry milk in TTBS and incubated for 1 h at room temperature. Super Signal West Pico Chemiluminescence Substrate (Pierce) was used for visualization. Controls were done by omitting the primary antibody, and the specificity of the anti-cav-1&#x003b1; and anti-cav-2 antibodies was verified in lung homogenates from cav-1-deficient mice.</p></sec><sec><title>Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET)</title><p>FRET is a nonradiative energy transfer between two fluorophores (a donor and an acceptor) that can be detected only if the two fluorophores are less than 10 nm apart. We used FRET combined with CLSM and double-labeling indirect immunofluorescence as a technique for measuring close spatial association of proteins in tissue sections [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. Cav-1 and cav-2 were labeled using conventional indirect double-labeling immunofluorescence technique (anti-cav-1&#x003b1; from rabbit labeled with Cy5-conjugated secondary reagent, anti-cav-2 antibody labeled with Cy3-conjugated secondary reagent). Both primary antibodies were applied simultaneously. After a washing step, Cy3-conjugated donkey anti-mouse-Ig was applied for 1 h and after a second washing step the slides were incubated with Cy5-conjugated F(ab')<sub>2 </sub>donkey anti-rabbit-Ig. For control of the species-specificity of the secondary reagents, only the anti-cav-1 antibody and both secondary antibodies were applied. FRET was quantified by the acceptor photobleaching method using a CLSM (TCS-SP2 AOBS, Leica). In this method, FRET is detected by measuring the intensity of fluorescence of the donor before and after bleaching of the acceptor. The CLSM settings were as follows: Detection of Cy3: 52% laser power at 543 nm, detection at 555&#x02013;620 nm; Cy5: 20% laser power at 633 nm, detection at 639&#x02013;738 nm. A region of interest was photobleached 10 times at 100% activity using the 633 nm laser and maximal zoom to destroy the acceptor fluorophore (Cy5) and the change in Cy3 signal (&#x00394;IF) was determined in the photobleached area where</p><p>&#x00394;IF = D<sub>DA </sub>&#x02013; D<sub>DB</sub>,</p><p>D<sub>DA </sub>is the fluorescence intensity of the donor after photobleaching of the acceptor, and D<sub>DB </sub>is the fluorescence intensity of the donor before photobleaching of the acceptor.</p></sec><sec><title>Statistical analyses</title><p>Differences among experimental group and control group in the FRET-experiments were analysed with the Kruskal-Wallis test followed by Mann-Whitney test using SPSS software, version 11.5.1 (SPSS GmbH Software, Munich, Germany), with p &#x02264; 0.05 being considered as significant and p &#x02264; 0.01 as highly significant.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>RT-PCR</title><p>RT-PCR analysis of total mRNA isolated from rat lungs and abraded tracheal epithelial cells revealed expression of cav-1 and cav-2.

Electron microscopy demonstrated that, indeed, ciliated and basal cells possess caveolae. It has been shown that muscarinic receptors as well as &#x003b2;-adrenergic receptors may translocate to caveolae upon agonist binding [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. These receptors are involved in the regulation of ciliary function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. In addition, several proteins involved in Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent signaling processes, including the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-pump and Ca<sup>2+</sup>-ATPase, are localized to caveolae as shown in renal and intestinal epithelial cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. Therefore, caveolae are likely to be involved in the fine-tuned regulation of epithelial cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup>-concentration and in regulation of ciliary function.</p><p>Several pathogenic microorganisms selectively use caveolae to enter cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. Since the caveolae are localized at the basolateral surface of the ciliated cells, it is conceivable that they may be involved in the process of endocytosis of infectious agents after epithelial damage. Indeed, adenoviruses require damage of the integrity of the epithelia or of the tight junctions to get access to the basolateral membrane of the ciliated cells to be infectious [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. Basal cells are much more susceptible to infection with adenoviruses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. Accordingly, we observed more caveolae in basal cells than in ciliated epithelial cells. It has been shown for the adenovirus2 that it can enter the cell via its receptor CAR that is also localized basolaterally in ciliated cells and in basal cells. Since adenovirus2-CAR is endocytosed via clathrin-coated pits, caveolae, at first sight, seem not to be important in this process. Nevertheless, another receptor for adenovirus2 is major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class 1. This also is localized in the basolateral membrane of ciliated cells and in basal cells. MHC class 1 is also the receptor for simian virus 40 that is endocytosed via caveolae. This indicates a role for caveolae in the infection of airway epithelium by these adenoviruses. Furthermore, the infectivity of C-type human adenovirus can be greatly reduced by the expression of a dominant negative cav-1 mutant in plasmocytic cells indicating that caveolae can serve as an alternative entry site for these viruses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. In addition, it was recently shown for Chlamydia pneumoniae that it co-localizes with cav-1 and cav-2 in the cytosol in HeLa cells after cellular entrance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>], indicating a role for caveolins in infectious processes after microbial entry.</p><p>Since the loss of cav-1 was accompanied with loss of caveolae in tracheal epithelial cells in cav-1-deficient mice, cav-1 is required for the formation of caveolae in these cells. In addition, the stabilization and the transport of cav-2 to the plasma membrane are dependent on the expression of cav-1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. Our results from FRET experiments also prove that cav-1&#x003b1; and cav-2 are closely associated in ciliated and in basal cells, indicating that both proteins are involved in the formation of caveolae. Interestingly, we found considerably higher expression of cav-2 mRNA than cav-1 mRNA, indicating that cav-2 could have roles independent from cav-1 once it has reached the plasma membrane. Indeed, it has been shown for cav-2 that it associates with chlamydial inclusions independently of cav-1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>].</p><p>We observed differences in the labeling intensities for cav-1&#x003b1; and cav-1&#x003b1;&#x003b2; among cell types. Cav-1&#x003b1;-immunoreactivity was stronger in endothelial cells compared to epithelial cells. In contrast, cav-1&#x003b1;&#x003b2;-labeling was stronger in the epithelium than in the endothelium of the large airways. In line with this observation, Western blots showed a strong protein expression of cav-1&#x003b2; in abraded tracheal epithelium but not in lung and heart homogenates. Cav-1&#x003b2; is less efficient in the formation of caveolae [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>], which could be an explanation for the lower number of caveolae found in epithelial cells compared to endothelium where the &#x003b1;-isoform is predominantly expressed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. The &#x003b2;-isoform of cav-1 is derived from an alternative translational starting site that creates a protein truncated by 32 amino acids [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>] and lacks the phosphorylation site tyr 14. This site has been shown to be phosphorylated upon stimulation of cultured cells by epithelial growth factor (EGF), leading to neoformation of caveolae [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. Since EGF is considered as a key factor for repair of the bronchial epithelium [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>], caveolae containing the &#x003b1;-isoform might be involved in this process. It is tempting to speculate that certain caveolae may exist that contain predominantly the &#x003b2;-isoform. Such caveolae might be involved in other signaling cascades. If both isoforms are present in caveolae, cav-1&#x003b2; could be a negative regulator for signaling cascades relying on the phosphorylation of cav-1&#x003b1;.</p><p>We found caveolin-1 and -2 only in the large airways of mice and rats, limiting caveolar function to larger airways in these species. It has to be kept in mind, however, that many human intrapulmonary bronchi are considerably larger than the rat trachea. Since we have found cav-1 also in human intrapulmonary bronchi, caveolins are likely to be present throughout a substantial part of the human bronchial tree.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>In summary, we conclude that ciliated and basal cells of the trachea and large bronchi possess caveolae resulting from an association between cav-1&#x003b1; and cav-2. Since caveolae are implied in a variety of different functions in other cell types, they are likely to be important also for these functions in the airway epithelium.</p></sec><sec><title>Abbreviations</title><p>BSA, bovine serum albumin</p><p>cav, caveolin</p><p>CLSM, confocal laser scanning microscopy</p><p>CT, cycle threshold</p><p>&#x00394;IF, change in Cy3 signal</p><p>EGF, epidermal growth factor</p><p>eNOS, endothelial nitric oxide synthase</p><p>FRET, fluorescence resonance energy transfer</p><p>IHC, immunohistochemistry</p><p>MHC, major histocompatibility complex</p><p>&#x003b2;-MG, &#x003b2;-2-microglobulin</p><p>PFA, paraformaldehyde</p><p>ROI, region of interest</p><p>RE, relative expression</p><p>SP-D, surfactant protein D</p><p>SPF, specified pathogen-free</p><p>TE, tracheal epithelium</p><p>TEC, tracheal epithelial cells</p><p>TTBS, Tris-buffered saline with Tween-20</p><p>WB, Western blotting</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The author(s) declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>PK and GK conceived and designed the study.
