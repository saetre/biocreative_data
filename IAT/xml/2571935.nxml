Although TLR3 is known to respond to RNA from necrotic cells, the relative importance of this response in vivo during acute inflammatory processes has not been fully explored. We observed the involvement of TLR3 activation during experimental polymicrobial septic peritonitis and ischemic gut injury in the absence of an exogenous viral stimulus. In TLR3-deficient mice, increased chemokine/cytokine levels and neutrophil recruitment characterized the initial inflammatory responses in both injury models. However, the levels of inflammatory chemokines and tumor necrosis factor &#x003b1; quickly returned to baseline in <italic>tlr3<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> mice, and these mice were protected from the lethal effects of sustained inflammation. Macrophages from <italic>tlr3<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> mice responded normally to other TLR ligands but did not respond to RNA from necrotic neutrophils. Importantly, an immunoneutralizing antibody directed against TLR3 attenuated the generation of inflammatory chemokines evoked by byproducts from necrotic neutrophils cultured with wild-type macrophages. In vivo, anti-TLR3 antibody attenuated the tissue injury associated with gut ischemia and significantly decreased sepsis-induced mortality. Collectively, these data show that TLR3 is a regulator of the amplification of immune response and serves an endogenous sensor of necrosis, independent of viral activation.</p></abstract></article-meta><notes><fn-group><fn><p>Abbreviations used: AST, aspartate aminotransferase; CLP, cecal ligation and puncture; HMGB1, high mobility group box 1; LDH, lactic acid dehydrogenase; MIP-2, macrophage inflammatory protein 2; MPO, myeloperoxidase; PAMP, pathogen-associated molecular pattern; PI, propidium iodide; PMN, polymorphonuclear neutrophil; poly(I:C), polyriboinosinic-polyribocytidylic acid; TLR, Toll-like receptor.</p></fn></fn-group></notes></front><body><p>The innate immune system provides a first line of defense via the detection and elimination of pathogens. Pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) are recognized by Toll-like receptors (TLRs), which activate inflammatory pathways leading to de novo cytokine and chemokine generation. When innate immunity is not appropriately regulated or the pathogen not contained, local and systemic inflammation can lead to severe pathophysiologic consequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">2</xref>). Factors released from stressed or damaged tissues serve as &#x0201c;danger signals,&#x0201d; and these might provide the innate immune system with activation ligands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">3</xref>). &#x0201c;Endogenous ligands&#x0201d; are potent activators of the innate immune response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">7</xref>), and the TLRs appear to be the target of these factors. In this regard, TLR3 activation aggravates and/or potentiates preexisting inflammation associated with the kidney (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">8</xref>), rheumatic synovium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">9</xref>), and gastrointestinal tract (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">11</xref>). In addition, TLR3 ligand amplifies the systemic hyperinflammatory response observed during sepsis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">12</xref>). Although TLR3 recognizes viral double-stranded RNA, recent studies have suggested that RNA released from either damaged tissue or contained within endocytosed cells might serve as a ligand for TLR3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">13</xref>). Whether TLR3 functions in this manner during inflammatory responses in vivo is presently unknown.</p><p>This study addressed the hypothesis that TLR3 regulates the inflammatory response during polymicrobial septic peritonitis and ischemic bowel injury. In the absence of an exogenous viral pathogen, TLR3 activation was important for the initiation and the amplification of inflammation via recognition of cellular by-products from necrotic, but not apoptotic, cells. Interestingly, <italic>tlr3<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> mice were protected from the lethal effects of total cecal ligation alone and cecal ligation and puncture (CLP)&#x02013;induced experimental sepsis. In addition, antibody-mediated immunoneutralization of TLR3 activation suppressed the tissue injury mediated by necrosis of the gut and sepsis-induced mortality in WT mice. Collectively, these data demonstrate that TLR3 regulates amplification events during inflammation mediated by nonviral mechanisms.</p><sec><title>RESULTS</title><sec><title>Up-regulation of TLR3 in macrophages and neutrophils after sepsis</title><p>PAMPs activate TLR-induced signaling pathways, leading to the induction of innate immune responses. A mixed pathological picture is associated with CLP, which includes the elicitation of various leukocyte populations, vascular permeability changes, and significant necrosis of the gut tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">14</xref>). This latter pathology may hold an important key in understanding endogenous signals that amplify the innate response, as growing evidence has suggested that host-derived RNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">13</xref>) from necrotic cells serve as major stimuli for TLR3 activation. To assess the expression pattern of TLR3 during the development of CLP sepsis, we initially localized the expression of TLR3. Although peritoneal macrophages and neutrophils recovered from the sham WT mice did not express TLR3, the expression of TLR3, via immunohistochemistry, was detected in these cell populations from mice undergoing experimental sepsis induced by CLP (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 A</xref>). As a control, no expression of this receptor was detected in thioglycollate-elicited peritoneal macrophages from <italic>tlr3<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> mice (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 B</xref>), confirming the specificity of this antibody. At 24 h, CLP mice showed increased intracellular expression of TLR3 in peritoneal and splenic CD11b<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> cells (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1, C and D</xref>, respectively) when compared with sham mice. Surprisingly, CLP also induced the extracellular expression of TLR3 in CD11b<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> cells isolated from peritoneal lavage (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 E</xref>). No statistical differences were observed at the extracellular expression of this molecule in spleen cells from CLP and sham surgery mice (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 F</xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="fig1"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p><bold>CLP surgery induced local and systemic expression of TLR3.</bold> (A) Representative immunochemistry analysis of TLR3 expression in peritoneal cells from sham and CLP 6 h after surgery.

As shown in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 G</xref>, poly(I:C) promoted the release of CCL3 and macrophage inflammatory protein 2 (MIP-2) from WT neutrophils but not from <italic>tlr3<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> neutrophils. Thus, peritoneal inflammatory stimuli promoted the expression of functional TLR3 in macrophages and neutrophils.</p></sec><sec><title>The absence of TLR3 enhanced the influx of neutrophils, but suppressed necrosis and apoptosis, during experimental peritonitis</title><p>The contribution of TLR3 to septic peritonitis in WT and <italic>tlr3<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> mice after sham or CLP surgery is summarized in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>.

Moreover, peritoneal washes from septic mice were characterized by considerable necrotic cellular debris and bacterial contamination, whereas similar washings from septic <italic>tlr3<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> mice contained greater numbers of neutrophils, little necrotic cellular debris, and fewer bacteria (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 C</xref>).

Both TLRs were increased in whole spleen from septic <italic>tlr3<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> mice relative to identical spleen samples from septic WT mice (Fig. S1 A, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20081370/DC1">http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20081370/DC1</ext-link>). Consistent with this observation, isolated peritoneal neutrophils released significantly greater levels of CXCL10 after exposure to synthetic oligodeoxynucleotide (CpG-ODN) and the chemokine KC after exposure to LPS (Fig. S1 B). Also, the marked absence of bacteria in peritoneal washes from the knockout group might be explained by our observation that <italic>tlr3<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> neutrophils exhibited a marked increase in basal reactive oxygen intermediate generation compared with WT neutrophils (unpublished data).</p><p>FACS analysis confirmed the marked absence of necrotic cells in the peritoneal cavity of septic <italic>tlr3<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> mice.

Between 4 and 7% of peritoneal cells in both septic groups were apoptotic (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 E</xref>). Collectively, these findings demonstrate that TLR3 regulates the amplification of acute inflammatory response evoked by a septic peritoneal challenge.</p></sec><sec><title>TLR3 activation contributes to organ injury induced by septic peritonitis and gut ischemia</title><p>To evaluate the contribution of TLR3 activation on the mortality induced by septic peritonitis, we monitored survival rates in <italic>tlr3<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> and WT mice for 8 d after CLP. The <italic>tlr3<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> animals were significantly protected from sepsis-induced lethality (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 A</xref>). The data show that &#x0223c;80% of WT mice were dead at 4 d after CLP surgery, whereas &#x0223c;80% of <italic>tlr3<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> mice were alive at day 8 after surgery. Mortality in the CLP model is caused by multiorgan failure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">14</xref>), including ischemic injury to the bowel. In addition to the septic injury, we examined the role of TLR3 in ischemic injury to the gastrointestinal tract induced by complete ligation of the cecum. As shown in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 B</xref>, complete ligation of the cecum without punctures for 24 h in WT mice caused severe necrotic injury to this portion of the bowel, characterized by the near total loss of tissue architecture and integrity. In contrast, the same procedure in <italic>tlr3<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> mice was associated with markedly less destruction to the architecture of the cecum and the cell infiltrate, and the contents of the cecum were still apparent in this organ, suggesting that reduced intralumen of its contents had leaked into the peritoneal cavity. Compared with WT mice, <italic>tlr3<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> mice showed significantly reduced levels of alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase (AST), bilirubin, and lactic acid dehydrogenase (LDH) after 6 and 24 h following CLP surgery, and at 24 h after total cecal ligation (Fig. S2, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20081370/DC1">http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20081370/DC1</ext-link>). Collectively, these findings are consistent with the concept that TLR3 activation contributes to the magnitude of the inflammatory response evoked by both septic and necrotic processes in the damaged gastrointestinal tract.</p><fig position="float" id="fig3"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><p><bold><italic>tlr3<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> mice are resistant to lethality after CLP surgery and exhibit less tissue damage after gut ischemia.</bold> (A) Septic peritonitis was induced by CLP in WT (<italic>n</italic> &#x0003d; 20) and <italic>tlr3<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> (<italic>n</italic> &#x0003d; 17) mice.

In cultures of peritoneal macrophages from thioglycollate-challenged mice stimulated with poly(I:C) in the presence of IgG or anti-TLR3 antibody, the presence of 10 &#x003bc;M chloroquine did not markedly impair the neutralizing activity of anti-TLR3 antibody when compared with IgG treatment (Fig. S5 A, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20081370/DC1">http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20081370/DC1</ext-link>). These data suggested that activity of this antibody might not be restricted to TLR3 blockade in the endosome. In addition, the presence of chloroquine did not alter the effects of anti-TLR3 antibody on the synthesis of CCL5, CCL3, KC, and MIP-2 (Fig. S5 A). As a control, the production of chemokines by LPS-activated macrophages, which depends of TLR4, is neither affected by chloroquine or anti-TLR3 blockade (Fig. S5 B). These data confirmed that this TLR3-directed antibody specifically alters the activating effects of a known TLR3 ligand.</p><p>In additional in vitro studies, WT necrotic neutrophils were co-cultured with WT peritoneal macrophages in a 1:1 ratio with either control IgG, anti&#x02013;IFN-&#x003b2; antibody, or anti-TLR3 antibody.

The inclusion of an antibody directed against IFN-&#x003b2; in this co-culture system resulted in chemokine generation that was similar to that observed in co-cultures with IgG (unpublished data). However, the addition of anti-TLR3 antibody to this cell co-culture system significantly decreased levels of all four chemokines (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7, B&#x02013;E</xref>). Thus, these data showed that the activation of peritoneal macrophages by necrotic neutrophils was dependent on TLR3.</p></sec><sec><title>Antibody-mediated immunoneutralization of TLR3 attenuated the tissue damage mediated by gut ischemia and significantly reduced sepsis-induced mortality</title><p>Given that the genetic absence of TLR3 provided a dramatic protective and modulatory effect during septic and ischemic inflammatory responses in the peritoneal cavity, we next assessed whether this effect could be achieved through antibody-mediated immunoneutralization of this TLR. We therefore assessed the effect of this neutralizing anti-TLR3 antibody in WT mice subjected to total cecal ligation and CLP. IgG administration before total cecal ligation provided no protective effect, as indicated by severe tissue necrosis and marked disruption of the normal gastrointestinal architecture (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8 A</xref>, inset) observed at 24 h after surgery. In marked contrast, anti-TLR3 antibody administration preserved the histological appearance of cecal tissue analyzed in WT mice that received anti-TLR3 antibody (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8 B</xref>). The protective effect of neutralizing TLR3 receptors in this necrosis model was reflected by decreased levels of AST and LDH serum enzymes (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8 C</xref>).

The recognition of PAMPs by TLRs has garnered much of the research attention in the elucidation of innate immunity in the context of pathogen exposure. However, growing evidence suggests that TLRs exert a prominent role in the response to endogenous signals provided by the host during injury events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">7</xref>). In the present study, we examined the relative importance of TLR3, a TLR initially characterized for its responses to double-stranded RNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">15</xref>) but more recently for its response to endogenous nucleic acids from necrotic cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">13</xref>). We observed that during septic peritonitis, intracellular as well as extracellular TLR3 expression was markedly induced in CD11b<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> cells. The absence of TLR3 in mice was protective in the context of both CLP surgery and gut ischemia. Two key features were noted in these injury models. First, the initiation of the inflammatory response in <italic>tlr3<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> mice was enhanced compared with appropriate WT controls. Specifically, we observed that neutrophil influx into the peritoneal cavity was significantly increased, and this influx was associated with increased CXC chemokine levels. Second, the inflammatory response was quickly contained within <italic>tlr3<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> mice, in large part because of the absence of an amplifying effect of byproducts from necrotic but not apoptotic cells. Importantly, this latter feature in <italic>tlr3<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> mice was replicated in WT mice via the use of an immunoneutralizing antibody directed against TLR3. Thus, the absence or the modulation of TLR3 activity has major beneficial effects in mouse models of peritonitis characterized by infection and tissue necrosis.</p><p>TLR3 is expressed in DCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">19</xref>), astrocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">20</xref>), Schwann cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">21</xref>), macrophages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">22</xref>), glomerular mesangial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">23</xref>), T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">24</xref>), epithelial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">26</xref>), fibroblasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">27</xref>), and hepatocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">11</xref>). Although TLR3 is present mainly within the endosomic compartment of these cell types, epithelial cells appear to uniquely express this TLR on their cell surface as well (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">26</xref>); however, we observed, like others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">28</xref>), that during inflammation macrophages express this receptor on the surface. These results were confirmed in studies in which the presence of chloroquine did not alter the inhibitory effect of the anti-TLR3 antibody during poly(I:C)-induced chemokine synthesis by inflamed macrophages. Viral infection drives TLR3 expression in epithelial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">30</xref>), but TLR3 expression can be driven during chronic inflammation in the absence of virus or viral byproducts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">31</xref>). Herein, we observed that TLR3 protein was expressed in macrophages and neutrophils after sepsis. The observation that TLR3 was induced in septic mouse neutrophils was novel because this TLR has only been reported in isolated human neutrophils (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">32</xref>). The presence of functional TLR3 in inflamed mouse neutrophils was confirmed by the addition of poly(I:C), which induced CCL3 and MIP-2 in WT but not <italic>tlr3<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> neutrophils. Thus, TLR3 expression was induced in macrophages and neutrophils in the absence of a viral stimulus.</p><p>Severe sepsis, a lethal syndrome after infection or injury, is the third leading cause of mortality in the United States (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">2</xref>), and it is characterized by multiorgan damage because of the fact that the excessive inflammation directed toward the infectious pathogen precipitates major tissue damage. Several initiation signals direct the migration of mononuclear cells and neutrophils during sepsis, but this response must be tightly regulated to avoid tissue injury (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">33</xref>). In the present study, the absence of TLR3 was associated with an increase in neutrophil recruitment into the peritoneal cavity in mice undergoing CLP and into the wall of the ischemic cecum at the 24-h time point. One explanation for the increased initial inflammatory response in <italic>tlr3<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> mice stems from our observation that neutrophils and macrophages generated significantly greater amounts of CXCL10 and KC, two potent neutrophil chemoattractants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">34</xref>), after exposure to hypomethylated DNA, a ligand for TLR9. Consistent with this explanation, it was observed that significantly greater quantities of CXCL10 were detected in the peritoneal cavities of septic <italic>tlr3<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> mice compared with WT mice. Also, at 6 h after CLP both TLR4 and TLR9 were markedly increased in innate immune cells from <italic>tlr3<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> mice. The activation of these receptors might account for the increased neutrophil recruitment and effective bacterial killing initially observed in the knockout.</p><p>The amplified inflammatory response during peritonitis is characterized by the exuberant presence of cytokines and chemokines, and these mediators contribute directly and indirectly to tissue and organ destruction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">35</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">36</xref>). Previous studies in <italic>tlr3<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> mice have noted that these mice exhibit markedly altered cytokine and chemokine generation in response to poly(I:C) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">15</xref>) or a viral infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">37</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">40</xref>). The intestinal tract appears to be highly susceptible to the damaging effects of double-stranded RNA, leading to a breakdown in the homeostasis in this organ system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">10</xref>). Recently, Doughty et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">12</xref>) reported that the activation of a TLR3 pathway with poly(I:C) in mice before septic peritonitis caused by CLP surgery significantly augmented the inflammatory response in this model, in part because of the up-regulation of IFN-&#x003b1;/&#x003b2;. The results from the present study expand these previous findings in that <italic>tlr3<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> mice were markedly resistant to the lethal effects of CLP. This decreased mortality in <italic>tlr3<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> mice was also associated with significantly lower levels of many proinflammatory cytokines (including IFN-&#x003b2; and TNF-&#x003b1;) and chemokines at 24 h after CLP surgery. Similarly, during total cecal ischemia in <italic>tlr3<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> mice, cytokine and chemokine levels were significantly reduced compared with WT mice, suggesting that the amplification of the inflammatory cascade was blunted in <italic>tlr3<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> mice. Thus, the inflammatory response in <italic>tlr3<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> mice was regulated in a manner consistent with tissue preservation.</p><p>The factors contributing to poorly regulated inflammatory responses such as those observed in sepsis and gut ischemia are not well understood, but tissue necrosis might provide a major &#x0201c;danger&#x0201d; signal that inappropriately amplifies inflammation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">3</xref>). In the present study, significantly fewer necrotic cells were observed in <italic>tlr3<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> mice after sepsis. Further, the coincubation of necrotic neutrophils with WT macrophages promoted the release of many chemokines, most notably CXCL10. This effect was restricted to co-cultures of necrotic neutrophils and WT macrophages, because the co-culture of necrotic neutrophils and <italic>tlr3<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> macrophages failed to show similar elevations in proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines. Tissue necrosis leads to the release of several cellular components, including heat shock proteins, HMGB1, and nucleic acids. Heat shock proteins and HMGB1 have been shown or suggested to be agonists for TLR2 and TLR4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">41</xref>), whereas mRNA is an endogenous ligand for TLR3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">13</xref>). More recently, Brentano et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">9</xref>) showed that RNA released from necrotic synovial cells activated fibroblasts in the arthritic joint in a TLR3-dependent manner. Also, necrotic neuronal cells were found to induce inflammatory Schwann cell activation via TLR3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">21</xref>). Although vimentin and HMGB1 are intracellular proteins, which are released during cell apoptosis and necrosis, respectively, neither factor appeared to activate peritoneal macrophages in a TLR3-dependent manner. However, the treatment of necrotic neutrophils with endonuclease or RNase significantly inhibited the ability of these cells to induce inflammatory chemokine secretion by WT &#x0201c;inflamed&#x0201d; macrophages. These findings lend credence to our hypothesis that RNA released from necrotic cells activates TLR3, leading to the amplification of the inflammatory response. Thus, TLR3 amplifies the inflammatory process in the peritoneal cavity, and its role in this process appears to be related to the detection of RNA from necrotic cells.</p><p>The development and characterization of an antibody directed against TLR3 allowed for the examination of TLR3 blockade in in vitro and in vivo experiments. We observed that this antibody recognized TLR3 in WT and <italic>tlr7<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> peritoneal macrophages but failed to detect any protein product in <italic>tlr3<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> macrophages. Moreover, the anti-TLR3 antibody significantly attenuated the cytokine- and chemokine-inducing effects of poly(I:C) and necrotic neutrophils by WT macrophages. Studies with chloroquine-treated &#x0201c;inflamed&#x0201d; peritoneal macrophages raised the possibility that this antibody worked via the blockade of TLR3 at the cell surface, but we cannot exclude the possibility that the neutralizing TLR3 antibody was internalized by macrophages via Fc &#x003b3; receptor&#x02013;mediated endocytosis. Importantly, the findings in <italic>tlr3<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> mice were duplicated in vivo in WT mice using a neutralizing antibody directed against TLR3. Specifically, tissue necrosis was significantly reduced after the administration of this antibody before the induction of gut ischemia. Interestingly, the administration of anti-TLR3 antibody at 6 and 24 h after CLP surgery, but not at earlier times after CLP surgery, had a significant protective effect, which is likely caused by the time interval needed to induce cell necrosis in this model. These findings are consistent with the role of TLR3 in the amplification of the inflammatory response after sepsis. Thus, TLR3 can now be included with the select group of molecules known to contribute to the amplification of the septic response. Other members on this list include HMGB1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">17</xref>) and TREM-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">42</xref>).</p><p>In summary, <italic>tlr3<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> mice showed regulated peritoneal and systemic inflammation after tissue injury in the absence of a viral challenge. Thus, the use of antibody directed against TLR3 might serve as a therapeutic clinical option in the treatment of necrosis-induced inflammatory events.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec disp-level="3"><title>Mice.</title><p>Specific pathogen-free, male C57BL/6 (WT) mice (aged 6&#x02013;8 wk; Taconic) were housed at the University of Michigan. <italic>tlr3<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> mice, backcrossed 10 generations onto a C57BL/6 background, were originally provided by R.

Equal amounts of cell lysates (18 &#x003bc;g) and 10 ng of recombinant mouse TLR3 (R&#x00026;D Systems) were fractionated by SDS-PAGE (NuPage; Invitrogen), followed by transfer onto nitrocellulose (Invitrogen). After overnight incubation with polyclonal rabbit anti&#x02013;mouse TLR3 antibody (dilution &#x0003d; 1:1,000), membranes were counterstained with peroxidase-conjugated anti&#x02013;rabbit IgG and visualized with enhanced chemiluminescence detection reagents (ECL; GE Healthcare).

Before each ELISA, snap-frozen lung and spleen samples were thawed on ice and homogenized in a solution containing 2 mg of protease inhibitor (Complete; Boehringer Mannheim) per milliliter of normal saline. Cell-free supernatants from the lung and spleen homogenates were analyzed. MPO activity in peritoneal lavage samples was determined by ELISA (Hycult biotechnology). All cytokine and chemokine levels were normalized to the total protein concentration from tissues and peritoneal lavage, as determined by the Bradford method (Bio-Rad Laboratories).</p></sec><sec disp-level="3"><title>In vitro macrophage and neutrophil activation.</title><p>Macrophages and neutrophils were obtained from thioglycollate-challenged WT and <italic>tlr3<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> mice. One of the following stimuli was added to triplicate wells of isolated macrophages and neutrophils: 2.5 &#x003bc;g/ml tri-palmitoyl-S-glyceryl cysteine (Pam3Cys; EMC Microcollections), 10 &#x003bc;g/ml poly(I:C) (GE Healthcare), 1 &#x003bc;g/ml LPS from <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> 0111:B4 (Sigma-Aldrich), or 2 &#x003bc;M CpG-ODN (Hycult biotechnology). Inflammatory chemokine generation by cultured macrophages and neutrophils was determined by ELISA or Bio-Plex at 24 and 5 h, respectively. In separate experiments, cultures of peritoneal macrophages cultures were co-cultured with necrotic neutrophils or apoptotic splenocytes in the ratio 0.5&#x02013;1:1 macrophage, vimentin (1, 2, or 5 &#x003bc;g/ml; Cytoskeleton), or recombinant HMGB1 (10 &#x003bc;g/ml; R&#x00026;D Systems). Necrotic neutrophils were generated from peritoneal neutrophils (73.4% were Gr1<sup>high</sup>CD11c<sup>neg</sup>) harvested at 16 h after i.p. thioglycollate injection and incubated at 55&#x000b0;C for 25 min, as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">46</xref>). Apoptotic splenocytes or neutrophils were generated by the addition of 1 &#x003bc;M staurosporine (Sigma Aldrich) for 6 h. In additional experiments, samples of 10<sup>6</sup> necrotic PMNs were treated with either 20 &#x003bc;g RNase (DNase and protease free; Roche) or 10 U/10<sup>6</sup> cells of Benzonase Nuclease (EMD) for 2 h at 37&#x000b0;C. After incubation, the necrotic cells were thoroughly washed and co-cultured with WT macrophages at a 1:1 ratio. Nucleic acid content in all necrotic PMN samples was determined with a RediPlate 96 RiboGreen RNA Quantitation kit (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's directions.</p></sec><sec disp-level="3"><title>Immunoneutralization of TLR3.</title><p>Cultures of peritoneal macrophages were exposed to 150 &#x003bc;g/ml anti-TLR3 of control IgG antibody for 1.5 h. Subsequently, TLR2, 3, 4, and 9 ligands or necrotic neutrophils were added. In separate experiments, macrophages were preincubated with 10 &#x003bc;M chloroquine. 2 h later, all cells were washed and incubated with neutralizing anti-TLR3 or IgG antibodies for 90 min. After this incubation, the cultures were stimulated with poly(I:C). In in vivo experiments, control IgG or 1 mg anti-TLR3 antibody per mouse were injected i.p. at 2 h before and 6 h after total cecal ligation. 24 h later, cecums and serum were collected for analysis. In the CLP model, control IgG or anti-TLR3 (3 mg per mouse) were injected i.p. according to one of the following treatment regimens: (a) at 3 h before CLP surgery only; (b) 3 and 24 h after CLP surgery; and (c) at 6 and 24 h after CLP surgery. Survival was monitored for 54 h after the CLP surgery.</p></sec><sec disp-level="3"><title>Statistics.</title><p>Data are expressed as mean &#x000b1; SEM.

Fig. S1 B shows that the absence of TLR3 in neutrophils increased the responsiveness (i.e., chemokine production) of these cells to TLR4 (LPS). Fig. S2 shows that TLR3 activation increased the levels of AST, bilirubin, and LDH induced by septic peritonitis and gut ischemia. Fig. S3 shows that vimentin as well as HMGB1 proteins are not involved in the activation of TLR3 during acute inflammation. Fig. S4 shows that the polyclonal anti-TLR3 antibody used in the in vitro and in vivo studies attenuated the poly(I:C)-induced chemokine production and did not have any effect in the chemokine production induced by other TLR ligands. Fig. S5 shows that chemokine production mediated after TLR3 activation is not completely restricted by the endosomal acidification with chloroquine.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material id="PMC_1" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>[Supplemental Material Index]</title></caption><media mimetype="text" mime-subtype="html" xlink:href="jem.20081370_index.html"/><media xlink:role="associated-file" mimetype="text" mime-subtype="html" xlink:href="jem.20081370_1.html"/><media xlink:role="associated-file" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="jpeg" xlink:href="jem.20081370_JEM_20081370_FS1.jpg"/><media xlink:role="associated-file" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="jpeg" xlink:href="jem.20081370_JEM_20081370_FS1-01.jpg"/><media xlink:role="associated-file" mimetype="text" mime-subtype="html" xlink:href="jem.20081370_2.html"/><media xlink:role="associated-file" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="jpeg" xlink:href="jem.20081370_JEM_20081370_FS2.jpg"/><media xlink:role="associated-file" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="jpeg" xlink:href="jem.20081370_JEM_20081370_FS2-01.jpg"/><media xlink:role="associated-file" mimetype="text" mime-subtype="html" xlink:href="jem.20081370_3.html"/><media xlink:role="associated-file" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="jpeg" xlink:href="jem.20081370_JEM_20081370_FS3.jpg"/><media xlink:role="associated-file" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="jpeg" xlink:href="jem.20081370_JEM_20081370_FS3-01.jpg"/><media xlink:role="associated-file" mimetype="text" mime-subtype="html" xlink:href="jem.20081370_4.html"/><media xlink:role="associated-file" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="jpeg" xlink:href="jem.20081370_JEM_20081370_FS4.jpg"/><media xlink:role="associated-file" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="jpeg" xlink:href="jem.20081370_JEM_20081370_FS4-01.jpg"/><media xlink:role="associated-file" mimetype="text" mime-subtype="html" xlink:href="jem.20081370_5.html"/><media xlink:role="associated-file" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="jpeg" xlink:href="jem.20081370_JEM_20081370_FS5.jpg"/><media xlink:role="associated-file" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="jpeg" xlink:href="jem.20081370_JEM_20081370_FS5-01.jpg"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank Ms. Robin Kunkel for graphic assistance, and Ms. Holly Evanoff, Mr. Aaron Berlin, Dr. Ron Allen, and Ms. Lisa Riggs for technical assistance.</p><p>This work was supported in part by National Institutes of Health grants HL31237 and HL31963 (to S.L.
