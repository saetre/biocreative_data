We have found that EPO treatment substantially reduces the acute clinical paralysis seen in EAE mice and this improvement is accompanied by a large reduction in the mononuclear cell infiltration and downregulation of glial MHC class II expression within the inflamed CNS. Other reports have recently indicated that peripherally generated anti-inflammatory CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>Foxp3<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> regulatory T cells (Tregs) and the IL17-producing CD4&#x0002b; T helper cell (Th17) subpopulations play key antagonistic roles in EAE pathogenesis. However, no information regarding the effects of EPO therapy on the behavior of the general mononuclear-lymphocyte population, Tregs or Th17 cells in EAE has emerged.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and Findings</title><p>We first determined in vivo that EPO therapy markedly suppressed MOG specific T cell proliferation and sharply reduced the number of reactive dendritic cells (CD11c positive) in EAE lymph nodes during both inductive and later symptomatic phases of MOG<sub>35&#x02013;55</sub> induced EAE. We then determined the effect in vivo of EPO on numbers of peripheral Treg cells and Th17 cells. We found that EPO treatment modulated immune balance in both the periphery and the inflamed spinal cord by promoting a large expansion in Treg cells, inhibiting Th17 polarization and abrogating proliferation of the antigen presenting dendritic cell population. Finally we utilized tissue culture assays to show that exposure to EPO in vitro similarly downregulated MOG-specific T cell proliferation and also greatly suppressed T cell production of pro-inflammatory cytokines.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>Taken together, our findings reveal an important new locus whereby EPO induces substantial long-term tissue protection in the host through signaling to several critical subsets of immune cells that reside in the peripheral lymphatic system.</p></sec></abstract><counts><page-count count="11"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Most autoreactive T cells are negatively selected and eliminated during thymic development in a process called central T cell tolerance <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001924-Sebzda1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001924-Baldwin1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>.

In this study, we characterized the effect of EPO on immunogenesis within the peripheral lymphoid tissues and the impact of EPO therapy on infiltrating inflammatory cells within the CNS target organ using the EAE mouse model. We found that EPO therapy exerts unexpectedly profound biologic effects within the peripheral lymphoid system tissues and acts as a potent molecular check on inflammation by blocking dendritic cell expansion and T cell proliferation while inducing rapid expansion of the Treg cell population and a corresponding reduction in Th17 cells. This comprehensive immune modulating mechanism likely accounts for the bulk of the EPO neuroprotective effects induced in the EAE animal model.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>EPO down-regulates MOG-specific T cell proliferation in vitro and suppresses T cell cytokine production</title><p>Autoreactive T cells are believed to play key roles in the pathogenesis of EAE.

Anti-inflammatory regulatory T cells have been found to be an important CD4 cell subpopulation for controlling the development of autoimmune disease <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001924-Kohm1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001924-FernandezMartin1">&#x0005b;34&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001924-Sakaguchi1">&#x0005b;35&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001924-Reddy2">&#x0005b;36&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001924-Bynoe1">&#x0005b;37&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001924-Viglietta1">&#x0005b;38&#x0005d;</xref>. Adoptive transfer of Treg cells has been shown to be of therapeutic efficacy in several animal autoimmune disease models. Our study shows that short-term EPO therapy in MOG-immunized mice is associated with rapid expansion of the Treg cell population in peripheral lymphoid tissue and this EPO-induced expansion of Treg cells was sustained over long term follow up. In fact, EPO-treated EAE animals that manifested delayed onset of clinical disease and less neurologic damage were found to have higher numbers of Treg cells within both DILNs and spinal cord. The EPO-induced higher Treg population may play an important role in reducing the peripheral immune response to MOG autoantigen, and may be the major source of Tregs migrating into CNS to minimize inflammation within CNS white matter. A recent study showed that anti-inflammatory vasoactive intestinal peptide also prevents neurologic progression in MOG-EAE by inducing Treg cell expansion in peripheral lymphoid tissue and the CNS <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001924-FernandezMartin1">&#x0005b;34&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>The other important subpopulation of CD4 helper T cells recently recognized to be a critical player in inflammatory autoimmune disease pathogenesis is the IL-17 cell. IL-17 is a potent proinflammatory cytokine and overproduction of IL-17 has been associated with a variety of human autoimmune diseases and their corresponding animal models. The kinetics and organ distribution of Th17 cells in our MOG<sub>35&#x02013;55</sub> induced EAE mice was very similar to the Th17 cell kinetics following proteolipid protein 139&#x02013;151 peptide induced EAE in SLJ/J mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001924-Hofstetter3">&#x0005b;39&#x0005d;</xref>. Th17 cells, like the MOG<sub>40&#x02013;54</sub> specific T cells, reside mainly in the peripheral lymphatics during the EAE induction phase after immunization. Later, when increased numbers of infiltrating inflammatory cells invade the CNS (12&#x02013;20 days post MOG-immunization), Th17 cells, together with MOG-specific T effector cells, were easily detected in diseased spinal cords. EPO treatment abrogates the proliferation of peripheral Th17 cells during both the early induction phase as well as at later stages of EAE, and EPO treatment inhibits Th17 cell formation within the spinal cord during both acute and convalescent phases of EAE.</p><p>It is unknown by what mechanism EPO suppresses expansion of the Th17 cell subset in EAE animals. Since IL-6 has been reported to promote differentiation of na&#x000ef;ve CD4 T cells into Th17 cells in vitro, the level of IL-6 secretion by inflammatory cells could be playing a crucial role for in vivo development and expansion of Th17 cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001924-Hirota1">&#x0005b;40&#x0005d;</xref>. Our in vitro studies demonstrated significantly reduced IL-6 levels in EPO treated MOG-T cell cultures, suggesting that down-regulation of Th17 by EPO could be a consequence of reduced IL-6 secretion. A less severe inflammatory environment in peripheral lymphoid tissue as well as in the CNS after EPO therapy may prevent significant Th17 migration into the CNS, thereby delaying disease onset and inducing less severe CNS pathology.</p><p>The mechanism and precise signaling pathway by which EPO suppresses the immune response in the peripheral lymphoid tissues is also unknown. Since CD 11c expressing dendritic cells are pivotal in the control of developing immune responses, it may be that the EPO treatment induced massive 20-fold reduction in lymphoid dendritic cells coupled with marked down-regulation of MHC II expression on the surface of mononuclear cells in EAE is sufficient to block full development of the autoimmune process. This notion is supported by reports on 3 genetic conditions of mice where excessive DCs accumulate in the lymphoid tissues (DC-p35, CD11c-CRE Fas KI, and mice deficient in the immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitor motif (Dcir)). These animals have greatly expanded dendritic cell populations; show exaggerated immune responses and subsequently develop systemic autoimmunity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001924-Chen1">&#x0005b;41&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001924-Stranges1">&#x0005b;42&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001924-Fujikado1">&#x0005b;43&#x0005d;</xref>. The classic EPO signaling pathway for erythropoiesis occurs through EPO ligand binding to EPO receptors and subsequent receptor dimerization, however there are recent reports claiming that EPO tissue protection is mediated by a different signaling pathway that involves binding to a hetero receptor composed of EPO receptor and the common beta receptor (&#x003b2;cR). The common beta receptor is used for IL-5, IL-3, and macrophage colony stimulating factor signaling and is upregulated during inflammatory responses <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001924-Brines2">&#x0005b;44&#x0005d;</xref> .</p><p>Beneficial therapeutic effects of exogenously administered whole molecule EPO have been described in several animal models of neurologic injury, including occlusive cerebral vascular disease, acute brain trauma, epilepsy, as well as in both autoimmune arthritis and EAE <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001924-Li1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001924-Brines3">&#x0005b;45&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001924-Cuzzocrea1">&#x0005b;46&#x0005d;</xref>. However, application of even medium-term EPO therapy for most acute conditions in humans remains improbable because EPO therapy may overly stimulate erythropoiesis with the subsequent risk of thromboembolic complications. To overcome this concern, whole molecule EPO administration would have to be limited to very short term use.</p><p>Other EPO molecular preparations, such as an asialo-form of EPO, carbamylated EPO (CEPO), or certain EPO mutants, have been reported to have protective effects in animals following experimental traumatic spinal cord injury or acute stroke without provoking an increase in red cell mass <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001924-Erbayraktar1">&#x0005b;47&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001924-Leist1">&#x0005b;48&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001924-Adembri1">&#x0005b;49&#x0005d;</xref>.

This small domain appears to code for a region that contains most of the immuno/inflammatory modulating effects described in this report. Our evidence suggests that distinct functional and structural domain(s) co-exist within the whole molecule EPO, that retain tissue protective effects without manifesting hematopoietic side effects.</p><p>One of the surprising newly recognized consequences of EPO therapy in humans that has emerged over the past several years has been the unexpected negative effect of EPO therapy on survival in cancer patients <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001924-Crawford1">&#x0005b;51&#x0005d;</xref>.

The reason for the decreased cancer patient survival in these studies is unknown and enhanced tumor growth induced by signaling to EPO receptors growing on malignant cell surfaces has been suggested as one possible mechanism. The new observations described here in our report suggests another intriguing possibility that remains to be studied - could the immunomodulatory effects of EPO be contributing to suppressing immune function in the cancer patient?</p><p>In conclusion, we investigated the mechanism behind the neuroprotective effects of EPO in classic autoimmune EAE animals and found that EPO has striking pleiotropic immunomodulatory effects on the peripheral lymphatic tissues as well as on the CNS target organ. EPO appears to restrain the overwhelming autoimmune response in MOG-immunized EAE animals and restores it to a more balanced immune status. Our studies suggest that multiple alterations including a reduction in total autoreactive T cells, DCs, MHC expression as well as an alteration in the balance between Th17 cells and expanded Treg cell populations within peripheral lymphoid tissue and CNS all contribute to EPO-mediated neuroprotection.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Mice</title><p>C57BL/6 (8&#x02013;10 weeks old) female mice were purchased from Charles River Laboratories and maintained in a conventional facility.
