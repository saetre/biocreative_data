In order to successfully avoid infection, they have evolved a series of defense mechanisms that work in concert to limit pathogen invasion and multiplication <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000139-Chisholm1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>. Unlike vertebrates, plants lack an adaptive immune system and rely on their innate immune system to recognize and restrict pathogenic microbes. Conceptually, there are two primary branches of plant innate immunity. One branch employs extracellular receptors to recognize conserved microbial features termed pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs), resulting in PAMP-triggered immunity (PTI). The second branch uses intracellular plant resistance (R) proteins to recognize pathogen effectors delivered inside host cells during infection, resulting in effector-triggered immunity (ETI). Despite the importance of plant innate immunity, how pathogen perception activates immune responses and signaling overlap between PTI and ETI remain elusive.</p><p>PAMPs are conserved microbial features, such as bacterial flagellin or fungal chitin, which fulfill a function crucial to the lifestyle of the organism. PAMPs are perceived by pattern-recognition receptors resulting in PTI. The activation of PTI leads to the induction of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling, transcriptional reprogramming, production of reactive oxygen species, and callose deposition, which serves as a physical barrier at infection sites (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000139-Nurnberger1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>).</p><p>In order to colonize plants, virulent microorganisms need to overcome PTI. Plant pathogenic bacteria use the type III secretion system to deliver 20&#x02013;30 effector proteins into the plant cell during pathogenesis. Collectively, these effectors are required for virulence and individual effectors have been shown to inhibit PTI through a variety of mechanisms <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000139-Zhou1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>. The most well-studied bacterial effectors come from <italic>P. syringae</italic> pv. <italic>tomato</italic> (<italic>Pst</italic>), the causal agent of bacterial speck on <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> and tomato. In susceptible plant genotypes effectors enhance pathogen virulence and can inhibit PTI and ETI; in resistant plant genotypes effectors are recognized, culminating in an inhibition of pathogen growth <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000139-Dangl1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000139-Shan1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>. Despite the wide range of pathogens recognized, the majority of R genes can be grouped into one large family encoding proteins with a nucleotide-binding site (NB) and C-terminal leucine rich repeat (LRR) domains <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000139-Meyers1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>. Several plant R proteins can detect effectors indirectly by monitoring for effector-induced perturbations of key host proteins.</p><p>To date, RIN4 (At3g25070) is the only known protein that can regulate both branches of the plant immune system. <italic>RIN4</italic> overexpression lines exhibit decreased callose deposition after PAMP treatment as well as enhanced growth of virulent and type III secretion-deficient <italic>Pst</italic>, indicating a reduction in PTI <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000139-Kim1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>. <italic>rin4</italic> knockout lines exhibit increased callose deposition after PAMP treatment and decreased <italic>Pst</italic> growth, consistent with enhanced PTI signaling <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000139-Kim1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>. These data indicate that RIN4 is a negative regulator of PTI. In addition, two R proteins, RPM1 (At3g07040) and RPS2 (At4g26090), monitor RIN4. RPM1, RPS2, and RIN4 are all localized to the plasma membrane <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000139-Mackey1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000139-Axtell1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>. In the absence of pathogen perception, RIN4 acts as a negative regulator of RPM1 and RPS2. When the <italic>P. syringae</italic> effectors AvrRpm1 or AvrB are delivered to the plant cell, RIN4 is hyper-phosphorylated, which in turn leads to the activation of RPM1-mediated resistance <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000139-Mackey1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>. Another <italic>P. syringae</italic> effector, AvrRpt2, is a protease that directly targets RIN4, leading to the activation of RPS2-mediated resistance <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000139-Axtell2">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000139-Coaker1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>. Investigation of the <italic>Arabidopsis&#x02013;P. syringae</italic> interaction has identified RIN4 is a point of convergence for the regulation of both PTI and ETI. However, a mechanistic understanding of how RIN4 negatively regulates PTI remains elusive.</p><p>Many pathogenic bacteria can proliferate as epiphytes on the plant leaf surface, but in order to infect a plant they must colonize host tissues. Bacterial pathogens gain entry inside plant leaves through wounds or natural openings like stomata. Stomatal pores, located on the aerial epidermis, permit gas exchange between plants and the atmosphere. A pair of guard cells surrounds stomatal pores. Guard cells respond to diverse stimuli in order to regulate stomatal apertures including: blue light, temperature, humidity, CO<sub>2</sub>, plant hormones, and pathogen inoculation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000139-Melotto1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000139-Hetherington1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>. Stomatal pores operate as osmotic machines that open when the PM H<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>-ATPase of guard cells is allowed to be active. The activity of this proton pump generates a large transmembrane electrochemical gradient that drives the uptake of charged solutes and, as a consequence, water, which in turn causes the cells to swell and the pore between them to open. Stomatal closure is initiated upon depolarization of the guard cell plasma membrane by inhibiting the PM H<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>-ATPase.</p><p>Historically, stomata were thought to be passive ports of entry, but recent evidence reveals that stomatal closure is induced by both PTI and ETI in an attempt to restrict bacterial invasion <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000139-Melotto1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000139-Melotto2">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000139-Gudesblat1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>. Upon perception of PAMPs, stomata will close within 1 h. However, virulent bacteria are able to re-open stomata after 3 h, facilitating their entry into the plant leaf. For example, virulent <italic>Pst</italic> secretes the polyketide toxin coronatine, which stimulates the plant to re-open their stomata <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000139-Melotto1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000139-Bender1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>.

Fusicoccin is a strong activator of the plasma membrane H<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>-ATPase and rapidly induces stomatal opening, presumably in order to facilitate fungal penetration <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000139-Baunsgaard1">&#x0005b;25&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000139-Oecking1">&#x0005b;27&#x0005d;</xref>. Taken together, these data highlight the importance of stomatal pores and guard cell signaling during pathogen infection.</p><p>In this study, we report the identification and characterization of the <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> RIN4 protein complex. We were able to purify several associated proteins by immunoaffinity chromatography and identify them by mass spectrometry. We identified the PM H<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>-ATPases AHA1 (At2g18960) or AHA2 (At4g30190), whose interaction we characterized in greater detail. The C-terminal regulatory domain of AHA1 and AHA2 interact with RIN4 by yeast two-hybrid and we can detect a specific interaction between AHA1/AHA2 and RIN4 in planta using bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC). <italic>RIN4</italic> overexpression enhanced PM H<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>-ATPase activity, while the <italic>rin4</italic> knockout line exhibited decreased PM H<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>-ATPase activity. Importantly, we demonstrate that the <italic>rin4</italic> knockout cannot re-open its stomata in response to virulent <italic>Pst</italic>. We also show that <italic>RIN4</italic> is expressed in guard cells along with other PTI and ETI signaling components. Our findings are consistent with a model in which RIN4 associates with the C-terminal autoinhibitory domain of the PM H<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>-ATPase to regulate leaf stomata in response to PAMPs.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Purification and Identification of the RIN4 Protein Complex</title><p>In order to gain a more comprehensive understanding of the proteins involved in plant immune signaling, we investigated the components of the RIN4 protein complex in <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic>. We used affinity-purified antibody recognizing RIN4 to purify associated proteins by immunoaffinity chromatography (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000139.s001">Figure S1</xref>). The <italic>rps2-101c</italic> mutant complemented with the RPS2 transgene containing a C-terminal fusion to the hemagglutinin (HA) epitope was used for RIN4 purifications. This line is biologically relevant because RPS2:HA is expressed from its native promoter, can complement the <italic>rps2-101c</italic> mutation, and confers resistance to <italic>Pst</italic> expressing AvrRpt2 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000139-Axtell2">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>. RPS2 associates with RIN4 in planta, and we used this association to troubleshoot purification conditions. Because the <italic>rin4</italic> knockout is lethal in the presence of RPS2, we used the <italic>rps2/rin4</italic> double mutant line to control for nonspecific protein binding <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000139-Mackey2">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>. Multiple purification protocols were tested in order to identify conditions that would enable us to detect the presence of both RIN4 and RPS2 by mass spectrometry. We found that wash conditions containing more than 150 mM NaCl eliminated most nonspecific protein binding, but also eliminated our ability to copurify RPS2 in the positive controls. Protein complex purifications were also conducted after plasma membrane fractionation, but this eliminated our ability to copurify RPS2 (unpublished data). Therefore, we used whole leaf protein extracts and mild wash conditions to purify RIN4 associated proteins across three biological replicates. Proteins from each sample were analyzed directly using high performance liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry (MS; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000139.s001">Figure S1</xref>). Proteins were identified using the MASCOT algorithm to search the <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> genome. All experiments captured native, biologically relevant levels of RIN4 and associated proteins.</p><p>We reproducibly identified RIN4 and RPS2 as well as six novel RIN4-associated proteins across three biological replications (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-1000139-t001">Tables 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000139.s006">S1</xref>, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000139.s007">S2</xref>). In order to be classified as a RIN4-associated protein, the protein had to be identified by a minimum of two unique peptides and be present in all three replications of the positive control, but never identified in the negative control <italic>rps2/rin4</italic>. Although we were able to identify RPS2 and RIN4 by mass spectrometry, we did not identify two additional proteins that are known to interact with RIN4: NDR1 (At3g20600) and the R protein RPM1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000139-Mackey1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000139-Day1">&#x0005b;28&#x0005d;</xref>. Both proteins have been demonstrated to interact by yeast two-hybrid and co-immunoprecipitation. Our inability to detect RPM1 could be because only a small percentage of RPM1 interacts with RIN4 in the plant, indicating that these two proteins may transiently interact during ETI <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000139-Mackey1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>. Alternatively, our mass spectrometry analysis may have only identified the most abundant RIN4 associated proteins. In contrast to RIN4, which is easily detected by western blot, RPM1 and NDR1 are expressed at very low levels, making them difficult to identify by mass spectrometry.</p><table-wrap id="pbio-1000139-t001" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pbio.1000139.t001</object-id><label>Table 1</label><caption><title>Members of the RIN4 protein complex identified by mass spectrometry.</title></caption><alternatives><graphic id="pbio-1000139-t001-1" xlink:href="pbio.1000139.t001"/><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><colgroup span="1"><col align="left" span="1"/><col align="center" span="1"/><col align="center" span="1"/><col align="center" span="1"/><col align="center" span="1"/><col align="center" span="1"/></colgroup><thead><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Protein</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Gene Identifier</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Accession Number (IPI)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><italic>rps2 RPS2:HA</italic> (1)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><italic>rps2 RPS2:HA</italic> (2)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><italic>rps2 RPS2:HA</italic> (3)</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">RIN4</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">At3g25070</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">IPI00517440</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">7</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">9</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">8</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">RPS2</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">At4g26090</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">IPI00547830</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">0</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">3</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">2</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">AHA1 or AHA2</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">At2g18960 At4g30190</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">IPI00526113</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">13</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">8</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">4</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">ERD4</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">At1g30360</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">IPI00526219</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">5</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">4</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">2</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Remorin</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">At3g61260</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">IPI00539947</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">2</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">3</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">2</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">MATH domain</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">At3g28220</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">IPI00528031</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">2</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">6</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">12</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Jacalin domain</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">At1g52000</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">IPI00531879</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">2</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">2</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">2</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Jacalin domain</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">At3g16420</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">IPI00543838</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">2</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">6</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">6</td></tr></tbody></table></alternatives><table-wrap-foot><fn id="nt101"><p>Counts are the sum of three biological replications (except RPS2, identified in only two replications).

This apparently induces the formation of a dodecamer consisting of six H<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>-ATPase and six 14-3-3 molecules in the PMA2 H<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>-ATPase isoform from <italic>N. plumbaginifolia</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000139-Duby1">&#x0005b;54&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000139-Ottmann1">&#x0005b;56&#x0005d;</xref>.
