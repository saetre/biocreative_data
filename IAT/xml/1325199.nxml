In HeLa cells, two ddx42 poly(A)<sup>+</sup> RNA species were detected both encoding the nuclear localized 938 amino acid Ddx42p polypeptide. Ddx42p has been heterologously expressed and its biochemical properties characterized. It is an RNA binding protein, and ATP and ADP modulate its RNA binding affinity. Ddx42p is an NTPase with a preference for ATP, the hydrolysis of which is enhanced by various RNA substrates. It acts as a non-processive RNA helicase. Interestingly, RNA unwinding by Ddx42p is promoted in the presence of a single-strand (ss) binding protein (T4gp32). Ddx42p, particularly in the ADP-bound form (the state after ATP hydrolysis), also mediates efficient annealing of complementary RNA strands thereby displacing the ss binding protein. Ddx42p therefore represents the first example of a human DEAD box protein possessing RNA helicase, protein displacement and RNA annealing activities. The adenosine nucleotide cofactor bound to Ddx42p apparently acts as a switch that controls the two opposing activities: ATP triggers RNA strand separation, whereas ADP triggers annealing of complementary RNA strands.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Nucleic acid metabolism in all organisms is made possible by the activity of a wealth of highly specific DNA and RNA helicases, with &#x0223c;600 different proteins per eukaryotic cell [(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>), reviewed in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>)]. Consistent with their central roles in nucleic acid metabolic processes, an increasing number of helicases are found to be involved in severe diseases, often associated with significant cancer susceptibility, and in viral diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>). Helicases, by classical definition, are enzymes, which disrupt the hydrogen bonds of nucleic acid secondary structures to form single strands in an NTP-dependent manner. While several DNA helicases are also known to disrupt protein&#x02013;DNA interactions [recently summarized in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>)], to date only two DExH/D proteins (the processive NPH-II helicase and the non-processive Ded1p) have been directly shown to couple ATP hydrolysis with the removal of proteins bound to RNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>). Two spliceosomal DExH/D proteins from yeast have been inferred to rearrange ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>).</p><p>RNA helicases are of particular interest owing to the recently growing perception of RNA metabolism as a fundamental regulatory element in cellular biochemistry and metabolism. The most extensively studied are NPH-II helicase from vaccinia virus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>) and NS3 protein from hepatitis C virus (HCV) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>), which are critical for virus replication and capable of processive unwinding of RNA duplexes. Interestingly, the latter protein unwinds RNA as well as DNA duplexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>), a property shared, e.g. by Dbp9p, a yeast DEAD box protein involved in ribosome biogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>) and Simian Virus 40 large T antigen (SV40 T ag), a hexameric replicative helicase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>). However, the number of biochemically, let alone physiologically (with particular respect to their <italic>in vivo</italic> targets), well-characterized cellular RNA helicases is limited. Many of them seem to disrupt only short RNA duplexes, e.g. eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4A (eIF4A) [reviewed in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>)]. eIF4A appears to represent a &#x02018;minimal&#x02019; RNA helicase, consisting of a core sequence common to most of these proteins, and is regarded as the prototype of DExH/D proteins. eIF4A, a non-processive helicase on RNA or DNA/RNA duplexes, unwinds 10&#x02013;15 bp, depending on the stability of the respective duplex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>), and its activity is modulated by other translation initiation factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>). Ded1p from yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>) appears closely related to eIF4A, although it has also been found in spliceosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>). Two other DEAD box proteins from higher eukaryotes studied in detail are p68 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>) and p72 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>). Apart from having low processive RNA helicase activity, they are capable of catalyzing RNA rearrangement events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref>) and may thus participate in reorganization of RNA structures <italic>in vivo.</italic> While the exact biological role(s) of p68 and p72 is(are) as yet unknown, they seem to be related to cell growth and/or division and have appeared in various functional contexts: as transcriptional co-activators [e.g. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref>)], as spliceosome components (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref>), in alternative splicing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref>) and in rRNA metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref>). p68 has also been found in a complex with 5-methylcytosine DNA glycosylase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref>). Very recently, it emerged as a cellular factor involved in HCV replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">36</xref>). Interestingly, p72 mRNA translation can start in-frame upstream of the AUG codon resulting in an N-terminally extended protein, p82, which is biochemically similar to p72 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">37</xref>). Most notably, no DEAD box protein is as closely related to another as p68 and p72/p82 are. Their cores show &#x0003e;90% homology, and their biochemical profile is similar. This led to the proposal that they constitute a p68-type subfamily unique to &#x02018;higher&#x02019; eukaryotic cells while the unicellular eukaryote <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> contains only one homologous protein, Dbp2p (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">38</xref>). Dbp2p (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">39</xref>) and p68 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">40</xref>) are posttranscriptionally autoregulated via a conserved intron. A similar regulation mechanism for p72/82 is likely as a pre-mRNA retaining an unspliced intron is detected in the nucleus as well (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">37</xref>). These observations are consistent with a fundamental role for each of these proteins in the cell.</p><p>In this work, we identified, purified and extensively characterized a human DEAD box protein, Ddx42p, which was previously found to be associated with the SF3b subunit of human 17S U2 snRNP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">41</xref>). According to its sequence, the protein is more closely related to the p68 subfamily than any other known DEAD box protein, but differs with respect to its biochemical characteristics. It acts as an NTPase and non-processive ATP-dependent RNA helicase that can be stimulated by a single-strand (ss) binding protein. Annealing of partially complementary ssRNA by Ddx42p, even in the presence of excess ss binding protein, is mediated most efficiently in the presence of ADP so that RNA helicase and RNA annealing activities appear to proceed in a regulated manner. These combined activities make Ddx42p well suited to restructuration of RNP complexes.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Biochemicals, enzymes and routine procedures</title><p>Restriction endonucleases were purchased from Roche, plasmids pGEM-7Zf(&#x02212;) and pGEM-3Z as well as M-MLV Reverse transcriptase were from Promega.

Samples with T4gp32 were preincubated (before addition of Ddx42p) for 5 min with a 100-fold molar excess of T4gp32 over RNA (in nucleotides); a 3-fold molar excess theoretically allows for complete ssRNA coating [calculated from (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b47">47</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b48">48</xref>)].</p><p>RNA annealing experiments were designed similarly except that two RNA single strands with complementary portions were the substrates of the reaction.

For annealing assays in the presence of T4gp32, reaction conditions were identical except that RNA substrate concentration was reduced by one half in order to achieve 100% annealing in the control reaction. Variable amounts of T4gp32 (at least 20-fold molar excess over RNA) were again added 5 min before addition of Ddx42p.

The cDNA encodes a 938 amino acid polypeptide, which is strictly conserved among vertebrates (more than 70% homology, i.e. identical residues plus conservative substitutions, of the full-length sequence), and invertebrates also contain a highly related hypothetical protein. Ddx42p contains all the classical core motifs of a DEAD box protein. In addition, its homology to both p68 and p72/p82 is significantly above average. While the N- and C-terminal regions of the proteins differ, their core regions contain &#x0003e;80% homologous amino acid residues (43.6% identity, 37.4% similarity), in contrast to eIF4A, which has &#x0003c;70% homology (27.2% identity, 41.6% similarity) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Analysis of the ddx42 mRNA</title><p>The mRNAs of the p68 protein subfamily contain unusual features (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">40</xref>). Therefore, owing to the apparent close relationship of Ddx42p to the p68 subfamily, we first characterized the ddx42 RNA. Northern blotting with a ddx42-specific probe revealed an mRNA of &#x0223c;4 kb, which occurs in similar concentration in HeLa, Hep3B, COS, TC7 and HaCaT cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>).

This approach confirmed the existence of two ddx42 poly(A)<sup>+</sup> RNA species (GenBank <ext-link ext-link-type="gen" xlink:href="NM_007372">NM_007372</ext-link> and <ext-link ext-link-type="gen" xlink:href="NM_203499">NM_203499</ext-link>, respectively), which differ in their 5&#x02032;-UTRs (overall length 255 and 184 bases, respectively) with the smaller one being the prominent product. Evidently, the two RNA species arise from alternative splicing as the shorter variant lacks a sequence corresponding exactly to exon 2. Both variants, however, encode the full-length Ddx42p polypeptide.

HeLa, Hep3B and COS cells were found to contain at least 2- to 3-fold more Ddx42p than TC7 and HaCaT cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>).

In order to obtain information on the cellular distribution of Ddx42p, western blot analysis of subcellular fractions was performed (&#x003b1;-D42N and &#x003b1;-D42C are not suited to immunofluorescence studies). The endogenous protein as well as Ddx42p overexpressed in COS cells were found exclusively in the nucleus. A Ddx42p deletion mutant lacking the C-terminal part of the protein, which contains a potential nuclear localization sequence (NLS; PPKRKKSR), could also be detected only in the nucleus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>), which points to an internal NLS.

As a starting point to identify protein&#x02013;protein interactions of Ddx42p, we checked whether the protein binds to p68 or to p53. Preliminary immunoprecipitation studies with monoclonal antibodies C10 (against p68) and pab421 (against p53), however, do not indicate complex formation of Ddx42p with p68 or p53 (data not shown).</p></sec><sec><title>Properties of Ddx42p</title><p>In order to obtain sufficient amounts of purified Ddx42p for further studies, we overexpressed the ddx42 cds in <italic>E.coli</italic> with a hexa-His tag fused to its N-terminal end. Most of the Ddx42p protein was found in the soluble fraction after cell lysis and purified to apparent homogeneity by a two-step chromatography protocol (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>).

Native PAGE of the purified protein revealed high molecular weight complexes of Ddx42p of &#x0003e;440 kDa (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>), which appear to be stable in the presence of ATP or ADP (not shown). This may suggest oligomer formation of the protein <italic>in vivo</italic>. Native PAGE of nuclear or cellular extracts followed by western blotting with &#x003b1;-D42C revealed the incorporation of Ddx42p in complexes of even higher molecular weight, and no free monomer was detected even after overexpression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>).

Therefore, we analyzed the hydrolysis of the four NTPs by Ddx42p in the absence and in the presence of nucleic acid. Basal hydrolysis activity of Ddx42p was found for all four NTPs. However, only the ATPase activity of Ddx42p could be stimulated by addition of RNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B and C</xref>). Interestingly, RNA homopolymers poly(C) and poly(A) as well as completely dsRNA did not stimulate the ATPase (data not shown), while poly(A)<sup>+</sup> RNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B and C</xref>), total RNA, tRNA or <italic>in vitro</italic> transcripts (not shown) all stimulate the Ddx42p ATPase by &#x0223c;1.5- to 2-fold. Addition of RNase abolished this stimulation (data not shown).

The members of the p68 subfamily were shown to separate partially dsRNA substrates up to 25 bp (corresponding to a <italic>T</italic><sub>m</sub> of &#x0223c;65&#x000b0;C as a measure of duplex stability) with 3&#x02032; ss overhangs into the respective single strands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">37</xref>). Accordingly, Ddx42p was offered p68 helicase substrates with 3&#x02032; ss overhangs (M and K, respectively). Ddx42p unwound none of substrate K (<italic>T</italic><sub>m</sub> = 62&#x000b0;C; not shown) and about 10% of substrate M (<italic>T</italic><sub>m</sub> = 53&#x000b0;C; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>, lane 3) in the presence of ATP under optimized reaction conditions (5 nM Ddx42p, final concentration of NaCl 50 mM, 30 min reaction time). Increasing concentrations of Ddx42p gradually reduced the fraction of unwound substrate M, and addition of poly(C) as a competitor had no effect (data not shown). The assay, however, allows the detection of only completely unwound strands, as intermediates in which part of the duplex is still intact when the protein dissociates would snap back into the original ds substrate.</p><p>Indeed, some DEAD box proteins, like eIF4A, are non-processive RNA helicases, which can unwind 10&#x02013;15 bp, depending on duplex stability, at most. In order to check if Ddx42p mediates strand separation of less stable duplexes, substrate PK (<italic>T</italic><sub>m</sub> = 41&#x000b0;C), and two substrates in which the duplex is interrupted by a loop of 4 (AK, <italic>T</italic><sub>m</sub> = 53&#x000b0;C) and 10 bases (BK, <italic>T</italic><sub>m</sub> = 43&#x000b0;C), respectively, were created. Substrate AK was not unwound, while about 15% of BK and about 20% of PK could be separated into their respective single strands by Ddx42p (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>, lanes 7, 11 and 15), which therefore seems to represent a non-processive RNA helicase. A substrate with 5&#x02032; ss overhangs (substrate 5, <italic>T</italic><sub>m</sub> = 45&#x000b0;C), on the other hand, was not unwound by Ddx42p (data not shown).</p><p><italic>In vivo</italic>, RNA helicase activities can be modulated due to complex formation with other cellular factors. Such functional cooperations are known from spliceosomal complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>) or from the translation initiation complex, in which the RNA helicase activity of eIF4A is modulated. However, the eIF4A RNA helicase is also stimulated in an <italic>in vitro</italic> assay containing only isolated eIF4A and eIF4B (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>), which do not seem to form a protein&#x02013;protein complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b55">55</xref>). eIF4B binds not only to ss, but also to structured RNA, and the precise mechanism by which it stimulates the eIF4A helicase is unknown (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>). However, classical <italic>in vitro</italic> RNA helicase assays as those described do not account for two important facts: (i) ssRNA occurs almost exclusively covered by proteins <italic>in vivo</italic> and (ii) ssRNA produced in an RNA helicase reaction is exposed to other RNA binding proteins, e.g. for subsequent reactions, or may be removed by protein-mediated transport processes. In order to mimic these effects in the <italic>in vitro</italic> experiments with Ddx42p, we wanted to check whether a ssRNA binding protein has an effect on the Ddx42p helicase. Thus we performed a helicase assay in the presence of T4gp32, the ss binding protein of bacteriophage T4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b56">56</xref>), as a model protein, which was unlikely to affect the intrinsic properties of Ddx42p. T4gp32 is capable of non-base-specific binding to ssDNA or ssRNA owing to its oligonucleotide/oligosaccharide binding domain (OB fold) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b57">57</xref>). Excess T4gp32 was allowed to bind to RNA prior to addition of Ddx42p. Under the conditions of the helicase assay, T4gp32 binds RNA with an apparent <italic>K</italic><sub>D</sub> of about 100 nM [(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b52">52</xref>) and data not shown]. None of the helicase substrates used was separated into single strands by T4gp32 alone (control reactions lacking Ddx42p; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>, lanes 2, 6, 10 and 14). Almost no effect on the Ddx42p unwinding activity was seen for substrates M and AK (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>, lanes 4 and 8), indicating that T4gp32 did not affect the Ddx42p processivity. On the other hand, the fraction of unwound BK was increased, and PK was unwound completely under these conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>, lanes 12 and 16, respectively). This shows that T4gp32 assists in Ddx42p helicase action most likely by stabilizing newly generated single strands as neither Ddx42p ATPase activity nor Ddx42p RNA binding appeared to be affected by T4gp32 (not shown).</p></sec><sec><title>Annealing of complementary RNA sequences by Ddx42p</title><p>We observed that higher concentrations of Ddx42p in the helicase assays did in fact decrease the fraction of unwound molecules. This lead us to the presumption that the protein might also mediate annealing of complementary RNA regions as had been shown previously for p68 and p72 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref>). Indeed, when partially complementary single strands (complementary regions of 14&#x02013;123 bases) were offered to Ddx42p instead of a helicase substrate, the protein produced some ds molecules under helicase assay conditions, thus counteracting the helicase activity. While essentially no annealing was seen in the absence of Ddx42p, raising the protein concentration increased the yield of annealed RNA strands (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>, lanes 4&#x02013;7). The reaction reached equilibrium after 10 min, and the efficiency of the annealing reaction correlates with the length, and thus with the stability, of the RNA duplex formed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>, lanes 7, 10 and 13).</p><p>Protein-catalyzed RNA annealing activity proceeds independently of NTP for p68, p72 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref>) and p53 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b58">58</xref>), and DNA annealing by RecQ5&#x003b2; is more pronounced in the absence of NTP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b59">59</xref>). Thus, the role for Ddx42p-mediated RNA annealing of the nucleotide cofactor was studied (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). About 20% of the strands were annealed when ATP had been added to the reaction. Nearly no duplex was formed upon omission of a nucleotide cofactor or in the presence of ATP&#x003b3;S, a non-hydrolyzable analog of ATP. Addition of ADP as a model for the state of Ddx42p after ATP hydrolysis, on the other hand, lead to significantly more (&#x0223c;80%) annealed product. Also, lower concentrations of Ddx42p were sufficient for duplex formation in the presence of ADP as compared with ATP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>), indicating that Ddx42p after ATP hydrolysis favors local enrichment of complementary single strands.</p><p>In order to determine whether covering of ssRNA strands with a ss binding protein affects Ddx42p-mediated RNA duplex formation, we performed the RNA annealing assay with ssRNA preincubated with increasing amounts of T4gp32 (molar excess over RNA in nucleotides at least 20-fold). The binding site of T4gp32, taken as a model ss binding protein here, was determined to be 6&#x02013;10 nt long (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b60">60</xref>), which is similar to that of, e.g. the RNP exon junction complex [8&#x02013;10 nt; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>)]. No annealing was observed in control reactions lacking Ddx42p. T4gp32 started to significantly interfere with the annealing reaction from a &#x0003e;50-fold molar excess of T4gp32 over Ddx42p in the reaction containing ATP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>, lanes 3&#x02013;7). In contrast, essentially no inhibition of annealing by ADP-bound Ddx42p was observed under these conditions (lanes 8 and 9). As expected from the above experiments, RNA persisted in the ss state upon omission of the nucleotide (lanes 10 and 11). These results show that Ddx42p mediates RNA annealing even when the RNA has been covered by an RNA binding protein. Complex formation between T4gp32 and Ddx42p as a theoretically possible, though unlikely mechanism for removal of T4gp32 from the RNA was not detected (data not shown). Since binding of T4gp32 to RNA is ss specific, the Ddx42p-catalyzed annealing reaction shows that T4gp32 is efficiently displaced from the RNA.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>DISCUSSION</title><sec><title>ddx42 gene and mRNA structure imply regulated gene expression</title><p>The genomic sequence of ddx42 extends over 45 kb. The occurrence of two introns in the ddx42 5&#x02032;-UTR sets it apart from the intronless 5&#x02032;-UTRs of the p68 and p72/p82 mRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">40</xref>), but the UTRs of all three mRNAs rank with long eukaryotic ones. Additionally, sequence composition (high GC content of 5&#x02032;-UTR, Us in 3&#x02032;-UTR) and lack of a canonical poly(A) signal also point to translational regulation of ddx42. This implication is supported by the finding that in spite of a consistently low ddx42 mRNA level in the different cell lines analyzed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>), the amount of Ddx42p differs from cell line to cell line (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). Remarkably, immortalized cells (HaCaT and TC7) show a lower Ddx42p content than transformed ones (HeLa, Hep3B, COS).</p></sec><sec><title>Characteristics of Ddx42p</title><p>Ddx42p, according to its sequence, is highly related to the p68 subfamily of DEAD box proteins. The known members of this group of proteins have been found in the nucleus as is also shown here for Ddx42p. A predicted NLS in the C-terminal part of the protein (PPKRKKSR), which is similar to the functional NLSs of protein kinase A (PPKKRKV) and of SV40 T antigen (PKKKRKV) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b61">61</xref>), does not or not exclusively determine nuclear localization of Ddx42p. Consequently, other sequence features at least contribute to its nuclear import. Sequences predicted (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://cubic.bioc.columbia.edu/predictNLS"/>) to determine nuclear localization of p68 (KKFGNPGEKLVKKK) and of p72/p82 (RGGGGGGGGR), respectively, are not present in Ddx42p, however. On the other hand, not all nuclear proteins are assigned a defined NLS and novel types of NLSs continue to be reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b62">62</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b63">63</xref>). Moreover, the sequence of Ddx42p contains stretches consisting of positively charged and apolar amino acids that might be recognized as a nuclear import signal.</p><p>Based on the high degree of sequence homology of Ddx42p to the p68 subfamily proteins and one common homolog in yeast, Dbp2p, one could assume similar functional contexts, and that Ddx42p may interact with the same protein partners as p68 and p72. Yet, we did not observe binding of Ddx42p to either p68 or p53, which form complexes with p68 and/or p72 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b50">50</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b51">51</xref>). Characterization of Ddx42p interaction partners will be particularly interesting future work as Ddx42p probably has functions that differ from p68/p72. In addition, the biochemical similarity of Ddx42p and the p68 group is limited since some activities of Ddx42p resemble more those of non-processive helicases like eIF4A or Ded1p.</p></sec><sec><title>RNA binding by Ddx42p is modulated by the adenosine nucleotide</title><p>Like most DExH/D proteins, Ddx42p requires a ss region for binding to RNA, as shown by its inability to bind to completely dsRNA. The ssRNA binding affinity of Ddx42p in the absence and in the presence of ATP or ATP&#x003b3;S is similar. However, ADP-bound Ddx42p shows an almost 10-fold increased affinity for ssRNA. The yeast protein Ded1p shows a similar behavior: (i) it does not bind to a complete RNA duplex, (ii) it shows an increased affinity to partial duplexes in the presence of ATP, but not ADP, and (iii) hydrolysis of ATP increases the affinity of Ded1p to ssRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b53">53</xref>). This suggests that ATP hydrolysis modulates the relative affinities of Ddx42p for ssRNA versus dsRNA in a similar way, probably based on conformational changes of the protein as was shown for eIF4A (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b64">64</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Ddx42p ATPase is stimulated by heteropolymeric RNA only</title><p>Though NTP binding and hydrolysis by DExH/D proteins is substantially based on Walker A and B motifs, usage of NTPs differs considerably. Even the members of the p68 subfamily differ in this respect: p68, with ATP being its best substrate, also harnesses CTP or UTP for RNA unwinding whereas p72 and p82 are strictly ATP-dependent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">37</xref>). Ddx42p is an RNA binding protein and shows basal hydrolysis of all four NTPs, but only ATP hydrolysis by Ddx42p is enhanced by RNA binding. The 2-fold stimulation of the Ddx42p ATPase by RNA seen here is similar to that of other DExH/D proteins like p68 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>) or spliceosomal helicases Prp2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b65">65</xref>) and UAP56 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b66">66</xref>) under comparable conditions. The apparent <italic>K</italic><sub>M</sub> for ATP of 0.2 &#x000b5;M indicates that Ddx42p binds ATP more tightly than other DEAD box proteins, and the turnover number for ATP hydrolysis (&#x0223c;2 min<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>) is in the same range as that of eIF4A (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b67">67</xref>). ATP hydrolysis by Ddx42p is significantly stimulated in the presence of various heteropolymeric RNAs, but not with poly(A) and poly(C), indicating weak or no binding of Ddx42p to these RNAs. Correspondingly, poly(C) was no competitor for Ddx42p helicase. Little stimulation of ATPase activity by RNA homopolymers was shown previously, e.g. for Ded1p (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b53">53</xref>). It may be due to inherent low affinity of some DEAD box proteins to these non-natural RNAs, which adopt conformations different from RNA heteropolymers. Also, complete RNA duplexes do not stimulate Ddx42p ATPase, indicating that Ddx42p in ATP-bound state needs a ss region or ss/ds junction for binding to its RNA substrate. The lower ssRNA binding affinity of ATP-bound relative to ADP-bound Ddx42p (see above) is consistent with a preference of ATP-bound Ddx42p for ss/ds junctions.</p></sec><sec><title>Ddx42p RNA helicase is stimulated in the presence of a single-strand binding protein</title><p>Testing of several RNA helicase substrates of different stability has revealed that Ddx42p is a non-processive RNA helicase in contrast to p68 and p72/p82 which can be regarded as low processive RNA helicases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref>). This result corresponds well with the higher affinity of Ddx42p for ATP and lower turnover number. Single-stranded loops up to 10 bases in one strand of the helicase substrate are not accessible to Ddx42p, because it could be expected that substrate BK was unwound with higher efficiency then. The absence of processivity is characteristic for a number of RNA helicases, e.g. for eIF4A, Ded1p [reviewed in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b68">68</xref>)], Prp16 and Prp22 [reviewed in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>)]. In most pathways that include RNA restructuration, processive separation of base pairs is not only unnecessary but could even lead to uncoordinated release of single strands which might then be available for a physiologically wrong interaction partner.</p><p>The non-processive Ddx42p helicase activity is promoted in the presence of a ss binding protein (T4gp32) with respect to the fraction of unwound substrate, but not the length of the ds region, i.e. processivity is not influenced. Absence of competition for the nucleic acid substrate and a stimulatory effect on DNA unwinding by SV40 T ag was found previously in the presence of excess SSB, leading to the conclusion that T antigen helicase preferentially binds to ss/ds junctions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b69">69</xref>). This may also hold true for Ddx42p (see above). Protein-mediated stabilization of nascent ss RNA during rearrangement of a protein&#x02013;nucleic acid complex avoids wrong interactions and cooperation between helicases and ssRNA binding proteins is indeed found in spliceosomal rearrangement reactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>). Thus, a scenario of Ddx42p helicase assisted by another ssRNA binding protein is not unlikely <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p></sec><sec><title>Ddx42p efficiently anneals complementary strands of RNA</title><p>Ddx42p is also capable of mediating RNA annealing (which may counteract its helicase activity such that net unwinding is low), and the annealed region appears not to be limited to a certain length. In contrast to other helicases with annealing activity [p68, p72 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref>) or RecQ5&#x003b2; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b59">59</xref>)], Ddx42p RNA annealing depends on the presence of a nucleotide cofactor. Maximum Ddx42p annealing activity (even at Ddx42p concentrations where the protein is helicase active) is seen in the presence of ADP, i.e. the state of Ddx42p after ATP hydrolysis, so the ADP-bound conformation of Ddx42p apparently has the highest affinity to ssRNA. This is confirmed by RNA binding studies (see above). In the presence of ATP, annealing is observed starting at higher concentrations of Ddx42p. This suggests that ATPase activity is required to convert part of Ddx42p into the ADP-bound state, which then mediates annealing. Correspondingly, addition of a non-hydrolyzable ATP analog or omission of nucleotide abolishes RNA annealing. Taken together, the activities of Ddx42p appear accurately tuned, which makes sense for the coordination of helicase and annealing activities under physiological conditions.</p><p>Whereas the helicase mechanism is beginning to be understood, far less is known on the mechanism of protein-catalyzed intermolecular or intramolecular RNA annealing. Base pairing requires a local enrichment of complementary single strands, which is effected by Ddx42p possibly by the formation of oligomers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). Ddx42p apparently binds to RNA in a sequence-unspecific manner like most RNA helicases, i.e. it binds to the acidic sugar-phosphate backbone. A clue of how Ddx42p may promote strand annealing is provided by the RNA annealing protein gBP21 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b70">70</xref>). (i) Clusters of basic amino acids, particularly RG-rich domains, assist in neutralization of RNA backbone charges. Clustering of basic residues is found in the C-terminal part of Ddx42p. (ii) ADP-bound Ddx42p has a high affinity to ssRNA and traps a ss until it encounters a complementary region. (iii) Base pairing leads to a conformational change in RNA, the affinity of Ddx42p to dsRNA is low, and the protein dissociates (possibly triggered by base pairing energy).</p></sec><sec><title>Ddx42p disrupts protein&#x02013;RNA interactions</title><p>Ddx42p displays RNA helicase as well as annealing activities not only on free but also on RNA covered by an excess of a ssRNA binding protein. At least the latter process requires removal of the pre-bound protein from RNA. Annealing of T4gp32-precoated ssRNA includes Ddx42p-mediated T4gp32 removal and duplex formation. ADP-bound Ddx42p, as in the assay with free RNA, was most efficient in this reaction. Competition by excess T4gp32 in the presence of ATP indicates impaired annealing due to shielding of ssRNA. This result underscores the importance of ATP hydrolysis by Ddx42p for protein removal and strand annealing. The driving force for the reaction is most probably a conformational change in Ddx42p leading to increased affinity of the protein for ssRNA.</p><p>Taken together, these observations allow us to speculate on a possible mechanism by which a non-processive RNA helicase uses ATP hydrolysis to affect conformational changes in RNP assemblies: ATP hydrolysis leads to a conformational change in Ddx42p, thus enabling the protein by its increased affinity to ssRNA to remove a nearby bound obstacle (i.e. base pairs of a short ds duplex and/or protein). This process might be accompanied by conformational changes on the RNA strand, exposing it to a suitable binding partner, e.g. a protein or another complementary RNA. Ddx42p, perhaps as an oligomer, provides several RNA binding sites, thus raising the probability of accumulating complementary single strands in spatial proximity. Coordination of non-processive helicase, protein displacement and annealing activities residing in Ddx42p, without the need for the simultaneous presence of another protein, is an ideal prerequisite for its involvement in RNP restructuration, for instance in the remodeling of the spliceosomal complex SF3b as has been hypothesized recently (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b71">71</xref>). Upon U2 snRNP formation, SF3b interacts with the 12S U2 particle to constitute the intermediate 15S U2 complex, which in turn binds SF3a to build the mature 17S U2 snRNP. The complexes are highly flexible to allow for the necessary conformational changes. Ddx42p is apparently associated with splicing factor SF3b, but not with the 17S U2 snRNP itself (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">41</xref>). A possible role of Ddx42p (as a temporary component of SF3b) could thus include a remodeling of a protein&#x02013;RNA interaction or a base pair contact (i) at the 5&#x02032; end of the U2 snRNA where SF3b binds, or (ii) after 15S U2 formation, perhaps at stem&#x02013;loops IIa/IIb, to facilitate SF3a joining. On the other hand, SF3b is also part of the U11/U12 di-snRNP of the minor spliceosome. It splices U12-type introns, which have not been found in yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b72">72</xref>). The fact that no obvious homolog of Ddx42p exists in yeast raises the possibility of a specific involvement of Ddx42p in U11/U12 di-snRNP formation. Furthermore, Ddx42p may be involved in other spliceosomal rearrangements as it binds not only to U2, but also to U4 and U5 snRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">41</xref>), and last but not least, it might participate in the recycling of spliceosome components.</p><p>Finally, the results presented in this work provide evidence for the assumption that ATP hydrolysis-driven protein displacement from RNA is indeed a general feature of DExH/D proteins.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>SUPPLEMENTARY DATA</title><p>Supplementary Data are available at NAR Online.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material id="PMC_1" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>[Supplementary Material]</title></caption><media mimetype="text" mime-subtype="html" xlink:href="nar_34_1_10__index.html"/><media xlink:role="associated-file" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="nar_34_1_10__1.pdf"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank Anna-Maria Bohrer for excellent technical assistance and W.

For the less stable substrates BK and PK, respectively, the weak Ddx42p-mediated strand-separating activity (lanes 11 and 15, respectively) is promoted by T4gp32 (lanes 12 and 16, respectively).

RNA strands containing complementary regions of differing length were used as substrates for Ddx42p-catalyzed annealing reactions. The ss and ds control samples were incubated under identical conditions, but in the absence of Ddx42p. RNA annealing samples were subjected to SDS&#x02013;PAGE and autoradiographed. D, M and P7 denote the partially ds product of the respective annealing reaction. The efficiency of RNA annealing by Ddx42p under helicase conditions increases with increasing length of the base pairing region: M (14 bp) &#x0003c; D (46 bp) &#x0003c; P7 (123 bp). The positions of the respective dsRNA and ssRNA species are indicated on the right. (<bold>B</bold>) Ddx42p-mediated RNA annealing is most efficient with ADP as the nucleotide cofactor. Annealing reactions with 50 nM Ddx42p were carried out with ssRNAs DT7 and DSP6 (complementary region of 46 bases) to exclude a possible counteracting of Ddx42p helicase activity. The reaction is most efficient with ADP, indicating that ATP must be hydrolyzed before RNA annealing. The weak RNA duplex band in lane 3 is attributed to 10% ADP content in the ATP&#x003b3;S preparation as declared by the manufacturer. (<bold>C</bold>) RNA annealing as a function of Ddx42p concentration. Formation of duplex D (46 bp) was monitored at increasing Ddx42p concentrations. Each point is the average of at least three measurements. In the presence of ADP (after ATP hydrolysis), significant annealing activity was observed even at a Ddx42p concentration used in helicase assays. (<bold>D</bold>) Ddx42p removes bound protein from RNA. Ddx42p-mediated RNA annealing reactions were carried out with the indicated nucleotide cofactors in the presence of RNA coated with saturating concentrations of the ss binding protein T4gp32. T4gp32 affects the Ddx42p-mediated RNA annealing reaction only when a 50-fold molar excess of T4gp32 over Ddx42p is used in the presence of ATP (lane 6). ADP-bound Ddx42p is even more effective as essentially no inhibition of annealing is seen under these conditions (lane 9).</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="gkj403f6"/></fig></sec></back></article>
