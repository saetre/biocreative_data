In skeletal muscle, the DGC provides mechanical stability to the sarcolemma during contraction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Petrof et al., 1993</xref>). Mutations in the dystrophin gene are responsible for X-linked Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD), which is characterized by progressive wasting of skeletal muscles eventually resulting in cardiac and respiratory failure (for review see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Durbeej and Campbell, 2002</xref>). In DMD patients, loss of dystrophin results in the absence of the entire DGC complex, leading to severe membrane damage and muscle degeneration (for review see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Durbeej and Campbell, 2002</xref>). <italic>mdx</italic> mice, which are an established model for DMD, possess a genetic mutation in exon 23 of the murine dystrophin gene, resulting in loss of dystrophin protein. As a result, the entire DGC is also absent from the sarcolemma, likely because of rapid protein degradation in the absence of a fully assembled complex. Muscles from <italic>mdx</italic> mice are pathologically similar to DMD patients and display marked membrane disruption as a result of sarcolemmal instability. Akt signaling is hyperactivated in muscles from DMD patients and <italic>mdx</italic> mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Peter and Crosbie, 2006</xref>), suggesting that the DGC may also play a role in cellular signaling in addition to its role in mechanical stability of the sarcolemma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Judge et al., 2006</xref>).</p><p>The transmembrane proteins of the DGC serve as important anchorages for the peripheral membrane DGC components. These integral membrane proteins include sarcospan (SSPN), the sarcoglycans (SGs; &#x003b1;-, &#x003b2;-, &#x003b3;-, and &#x003b4;-SG), and &#x003b2;-dystroglycan (DG; for review see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Michele and Campbell, 2003</xref>). The SGs and &#x003b2;-DG are single-pass transmembrane glycoproteins. Dystrophin, an actin-binding protein, is localized adjacent to the sarcolemma by attachment to the intracellular N terminus of &#x003b2;-DG (for review see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Michele and Campbell, 2003</xref>). On the extracellular face of the membrane, &#x003b2;-DG interacts with &#x003b1;-DG to form a receptor for ligands in the extracellular matrix (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Ervasti and Campbell, 1993</xref>). The SGs form a tight subcomplex with SSPN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Crosbie et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Miller et al., 2007</xref>). Together, the SG&#x02013;SSPN subcomplex functions to anchor &#x003b1;-DG attachment to the sarcolemma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Holt and Campbell, 1998</xref>). As a whole, the DGC provides a physical linkage across the sarcolemma between the extracellular matrix and the intracellular actin cytoskeleton protecting the membrane from contraction-induced damage (for review see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Barresi and Campbell, 2006</xref>).</p><p>It is well established that stable interactions among the integral membrane proteins are critical for DGC function and prevention of muscular dystrophy (for review see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Durbeej and Campbell, 2002</xref>). Despite their importance, the factors that determine the structural integrity of the DGC are not well understood. The observation that SSPN possesses some sequence homology to the tetraspanin superfamily of proteins raises the possibility that SSPN may serve an important role in mediating and stabilizing protein interactions within the DGC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Crosbie et al., 1997</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">1998</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">1999</xref>). The tetraspanins each possess four transmembrane domains and function to cluster and organize transmembrane protein complexes, thereby controlling a wide range of cellular functions (for reviews see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hemler, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Levy and Shoham, 2005</xref>). Using a site-directed mutagenesis approach, we have demonstrated that SSPN exhibits the structural characteristics that define the tetraspanin superfamily of proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Miller et al., 2007</xref>).</p><p>As a first test of SSPN function, we generated SSPN transgenic (SSPN transgene [Tg]) mice with moderate (10-fold) levels of SSPN protein overexpression in skeletal muscle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Peter et al., 2007</xref>). Forced elevation of SSPN caused a concomitant increase in DGC protein expression but did not disrupt localization of the complex to the sarcolemma. We found that overexpression of exogenous SSPN dramatically reduced endogenous SSPN to levels that were barely detectable, suggesting that SSPN expression is tightly regulated. 10-fold elevation of SSPN disrupted normal interactions within the SG&#x02013;SSPN subcomplex, which, in turn, weakened &#x003b1;-DG attachment to the sarcolemma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Peter et al., 2007</xref>). As a result, assembly of the extracellular matrix was disrupted, giving rise to severe congenital muscular dystrophy in mice with moderate levels of SSPN overexpression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Peter et al., 2007</xref>). Furthermore, membrane instability was not detected in 10-fold SSPN-Tg mice, demonstrating that pathogenetic mechanisms resulting from SSPN overexpression are distinct from dystrophin deficiency. Despite our exhaustive efforts, we were never able to isolate free, unassociated SSPN in 10-fold SSPN-Tg muscle, which strongly supports our conclusion that SSPN's toxicity is directly related to its association with other molecules within the sarcolemma.</p><p>SSPN-Tg mice with low levels of SSPN overexpression (two- to threefold) were also characterized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Peter et al., 2007</xref>). In contrast to SSPN-Tg mice with 10-fold levels of overexpression, SSPN-Tg mice with low levels of SSPN overexpression did not exhibit detectable signs of muscle pathology. DGC levels were mildly up-regulated in these mice, but interactions with the extracellular matrix were not adversely affected. Endogenous SSPN was not affected by this low level of exogenous SSPN expression. Collectively, these findings lead us to conclude that SSPN levels control DGC structure and function. Furthermore, this work leads to the hypothesis that SSPN may function to orchestrate assembly and stability of the DGC.</p></sec><sec><title>Results and discussion</title><p>Our previous work has shown that SSPN functions as a tetraspanin to coordinate protein interactions within the DGC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Peter et al., 2007</xref>), which led us to rationalize that SSPN expression in dystrophin-deficient muscle might anchor the transmembrane components of the DGC within the sarcolemma. To test this hypothesis, we engineered transgenic mice to overexpress SSPN on the dystrophin-deficient <italic>mdx</italic> background (SSPN-Tg:<italic>mdx</italic>). The <italic>mdx</italic> phenotype is inherited as an X-linked recessive trait, which stems from a premature stop codon in the dystrophin gene, leading to complete absence of the dystrophin protein. The DGC is absent from the sarcolemma of <italic>mdx</italic> muscle likely because of premature degradation of the protein components in the absence of a fully assembled complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Ohlendieck and Campbell, 1991</xref>). For these experiments, we chose to use low (two- to threefold) SSPN-transgenic (SSPN-Tg) mice, lines 31.6 and 29.1, which displayed normal muscle morphology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Peter et al., 2007</xref>). SSPN-Tg mice were engineered to carry the human SSPN (hSSPN) gene under control of the human skeletal muscle &#x003b1;-actin promoter, which limited SSPN protein expression to skeletal muscles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Peter et al., 2007</xref>). Although human and mouse SSPN proteins are &#x0003e;90% identical at the amino acid level, antibodies specific to human and mouse SSPN permitted us to distinguish between exogenous (human) and endogenous (mouse) SSPN. SSPN-Tg males were crossed with <italic>mdx</italic> females to generate dystrophin-deficient mice carrying the SSPN Tg (SSPN-Tg:<italic>mdx</italic>).</p><p>We first investigated whether SSPN overexpression affected membrane association of DGC components in dystrophin-deficient muscle. Indirect immunofluorescence was performed on transverse cryosections of SSPN-Tg:<italic>mdx</italic> quadriceps muscle to determine the subcellular localization of the other DGC components. In addition to the core components of the DGC, we also analyzed the localization of utrophin, a protein closely related to dystrophin. At the postsynaptic region of the neuromuscular junction in wild-type and <italic>mdx</italic> muscle, utrophin replaces dystrophin to form an otherwise identical utrophin&#x02013;glycoprotein complex (UGC; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Matsumura et al., 1992</xref>). Analysis of wild-type non-Tg and SSPN-Tg muscle served as positive controls, and <italic>mdx</italic> muscle was used as a negative control. As shown in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>, DGC expression was robust in positive controls (wild-type non-Tg and SSPN-Tg) but was not detected in negative control samples (<italic>mdx</italic> and SSPN-Tg:<italic>mdx</italic>). As expected, staining for exogenous SSPN (hSSPN) was only detected in SSPN-Tg muscle, and utrophin expression was restricted to the neuromuscular junction in wild-type non-Tg and SSPN-Tg muscles (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>). In agreement with previous results (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Matsumura et al., 1992</xref>), we found that utrophin expression was slightly up-regulated in <italic>mdx</italic> muscle at the extrasynaptic sarcolemma. Surprisingly, we found that overexpression of SSPN in <italic>mdx</italic> muscle broadened the localization of utrophin protein so that it was no longer restricted to the neuromuscular junction but was present throughout the sarcolemma (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Grady et al. (2000)</xref> have demonstrated that expression and localization of the UGC is important for proper synaptic formation and clustering of acetylcholine receptors at the postsynaptic membrane. Introduction of utrophin in dystrophin-deficient muscle broadens localization of the UGC to the extrasynaptic sarcolemma, where it ameliorates muscular dystrophy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Tinsley et al., 1996</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">1998</xref>). The observation that utrophin is localized to the extrasynaptic sarcolemma in SSPN-Tg:<italic>mdx</italic> muscle raises the possibility that utrophin displays elevated protein levels leading to the observed increased sarcolemmal localization and possible functional replacement of the DGC. We also found that SSPN overexpression in <italic>mdx</italic> muscle increased &#x003b1;-/&#x003b2;-DG as well as &#x003b1;-/&#x003b2;-SG levels at the sarcolemma (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>). These data suggest that SSPN has restored expression of a complete UGC at the sarcolemma in <italic>mdx</italic> muscle, where it may functionally compensate for the loss of dystrophin and its associated proteins.</p><fig position="float" id="fig1"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p><bold>SSPN stabilizes the UGC at the sarcolemma.</bold> Transverse cryosections of quadriceps muscle from non-Tg (wild type), SSPN-Tg (wild type), <italic>mdx</italic>, and SSPN-Tg:<italic>mdx</italic> mice were stained with the antibodies to dystrophin (Dys), utrophin (Utrn), DGs (&#x003b1;- and &#x003b2;-DG), mouse SSPN (mSSPN), transgenic hSSPN, and SGs (&#x003b1;- and &#x003b2;-SG).

To confirm expression of the Tg, immunoblots were probed with antibodies specific to hSSPN. Exogenous SSPN was abundant in SSPN-Tg:<italic>mdx</italic> muscle samples, demonstrating that stable SSPN protein was produced from the Tg (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 A</xref>). Levels of &#x003b1;- and &#x003b2;-DG as well as &#x003b1;-, &#x003b2;-, and &#x003b3;-SG were dramatically increased in SSPN-Tg:<italic>mdx</italic> mice relative to <italic>mdx</italic> controls (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 A</xref>). DG and SG protein expression in SSPN-Tg:<italic>mdx</italic> muscle was identical to age-matched non-Tg (wild type) muscle (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 A</xref> and not depicted). As expected, dystrophin protein was not detected in samples from either <italic>mdx</italic> or SSPN-Tg:<italic>mdx</italic> mice. Utrophin protein levels were elevated in SSPN-Tg:<italic>mdx</italic> muscle relative to <italic>mdx</italic> muscle (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 A</xref>). To investigate whether SSPN increased utrophin expression by enhancing transcription, we performed quantitative RT-PCR analysis. Utrophin mRNA levels were similar in SSPN-Tg:<italic>mdx</italic> and <italic>mdx</italic> muscle (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 B</xref>). This finding demonstrates that utrophin up-regulation by SSPN does not involve transcriptional regulation. Furthermore, these data suggest that SSPN maintains utrophin protein at the sarcolemma by providing a tetraspanin scaffold, which stabilizes and promotes protein interactions.</p><fig position="float" id="fig2"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><p><bold>SSPN regulates UGC levels by interacting directly with this complex.</bold> (A) Skeletal muscle from <italic>mdx</italic> and SSPN-Tg:<italic>mdx</italic> tissue was solubilized in modified radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer, and 60-&#x003bc;g protein samples were resolved by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted using antibodies against dystrophin (Dys), utrophin (Utrn), DGs (&#x003b1;- and &#x003b2;-DG), exogenous SSPN (hSSPN), and SGs (&#x003b1;-, &#x003b2;-, and &#x003b3;-SG). As expected, exogenous hSSPN was only detected in SSPN-Tg:<italic>mdx</italic> muscle. Expression levels of DGs and SGs were dramatically elevated in SSPN-Tg:<italic>mdx</italic> muscle samples. Utrophin, a homologue of dystrophin, is up-regulated in SSPN-Tg:<italic>mdx</italic> tissue. Equal loading of <italic>mdx</italic> and SSPN-Tg:<italic>mdx</italic> lysates was confirmed by Coomassie blue (CB) staining. Molecular masses of individual proteins are indicated in parentheses.

Purified UGC proteins were separated by ultracentrifugation through 5&#x02013;30% sucrose gradients. Fraction 1 represents the lightest region of the gradient. Fractions were analyzed by immunoblotting with antibodies to utrophin (Utrn), DGs (&#x003b1;- and &#x003b2;-DG), SGs (&#x003b1;-, and &#x003b3;-SG), and exogenous SSPN (hSSPN) as indicated. SSPN and utrophin are enriched in fraction 4, demonstrating that SSPN is a core component of the UGC. The molecular mass of each component is identical to that indicated in A.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="jcb1830419f02"></graphic></fig><p>We established that SSPN is a core component of the DGC using rigorous biochemical methods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Crosbie et al., 1997</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">1998</xref>). In normal skeletal muscle, SSPN is enriched at the postsynaptic region of the neuromuscular junction in a utrophin-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Crosbie et al., 1999</xref>). Our findings that SSPN expression alters utrophin localization and, conversely, that SSPN enrichment at the neuromuscular junction is dependent on utrophin suggest that SSPN functions to regulate utrophin through direct association with the UGC. To biochemically determine whether SSPN is a core component of the UGC, we isolated this complex from skeletal muscle of SSPN-Tg:<italic>mdx</italic> mice using lectin affinity chromatography followed by ultracentrifugation on 5&#x02013;30% sucrose gradients. Only proteins that are tightly associated will be maintained as a complex and migrate together during ultracentrifugation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Crosbie et al., 1997</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">1998</xref>). Fractions were collected and analyzed by immunoblotting with antibodies to components of the UGC. We found that SSPN protein is highly enriched in fraction 4, which contains utrophin and utrophin-associated proteins (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 C</xref>). We conclude that SSPN regulates utrophin levels in a mechanism that involves direct association of SSPN with the UGC.</p><p>To investigate the functional consequences of increased UGC levels in dystrophin-deficient muscle, we examined SSPN-Tg:<italic>mdx</italic> muscle for dystrophic pathology. <italic>mdx</italic> pathology is characterized by progressive muscle degeneration, compensatory hypertrophy, and necrosis of damaged muscle fibers. Histological analysis was performed by staining transverse cryosections of quadriceps muscle with hematoxylin and eosin (H&#x00026;E). Images of whole quadriceps muscle taken from <italic>mdx</italic> mice revealed numerous patches of necrosis, which were not present in SSPN-Tg:<italic>mdx</italic> muscle (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 A</xref>). Central nucleation, a marker of myofiber regeneration, was quantitated by analyzing H&#x00026;E-stained quadriceps muscle at higher magnification (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 B</xref>). <italic>mdx</italic> muscles at 6 wk of age display elevated levels (60%) of regenerated myofibers with central nuclei (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 A</xref>). We found a dramatic (40%) reduction in central nucleation in muscle from SSPN-Tg:<italic>mdx</italic> mice (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 A</xref>). Although the level of centrally nucleated fibers in SSPN-Tg:<italic>mdx</italic> mice remained slightly elevated compared with non-Tg controls, this is likely explained by fiber to fiber variation in promoter activation (unpublished data). In addition, expression of SSPN in <italic>mdx</italic> mice was associated with a reduction in the number of smaller, atrophic muscle fibers (Fig. S1, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200808027/DC1">http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200808027/DC1</ext-link>).

In contrast, we never observed Evans blue&#x02013;positive fibers in SSPN-Tg:<italic>mdx</italic> tissue (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 B</xref>).</p><p>In this study, we provide biochemical evidence that SSPN ameliorates dystrophic pathology in <italic>mdx</italic> mice by stabilizing the UGC at the sarcolemma through direct interaction with this complex. We demonstrate that SSPN causes redistribution of the UGC to the extrasynaptic sarcolemma, where it functionally replaces the DGC. The primary defect in dystrophin-deficient mice is the loss of sarcolemma integrity, and we demonstrate that SSPN provides stability to the sarcolemma. These data suggest that the actin-UGC&#x02013;extracellular matrix connection is fully and functionally restored. Future studies will be performed to determine whether SSPN overexpression improves muscle strength in <italic>mdx</italic> mice.</p><p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Tinsley et al. (1996</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">1998)</xref> have shown that increased expression of utrophin in <italic>mdx</italic> mice rescues muscular dystrophy by stabilizing the UGC at the sarcolemma in a dose-dependent manner. Complete reduction of <italic>mdx</italic> pathology to normal wild-type levels (as determined by central nucleation and muscle strength measurements) occurred when utrophin was overexpressed at twice the levels of <italic>mdx</italic> mice (note that endogenous utrophin levels are already up-regulated in <italic>mdx</italic> muscle compared with wild-type controls). Their data nicely show that pathology was directly correlated with the level of utrophin overexpression. Lower levels of utrophin expression reduced the pathology, but not completely back to normal levels. Based on these findings, we speculate that increasing the level of SSPN overexpression would have an even greater impact on improving <italic>mdx</italic> pathology.</p><p>Overexpression of DGC proteins, signaling molecules, and compensatory molecules can improve the pathology of muscle fibers in the <italic>mdx</italic> mouse. Utrophin, dystrophin, integrin, neuronal nitric oxide synthase, and cytotoxic T cell <italic>N</italic>-acetylgalactosamine transferase have been shown to improve muscular dystrophy. Most of these efforts have been focused on the use of dystrophin and utrophin to restore normal muscle function in <italic>mdx</italic> mice. Elegant work from Chamberlain's group has established that full-length (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">DelloRusso et al., 2002</xref>) and internally truncated forms of dystrophin are highly effective at ameliorating <italic>mdx</italic> pathology in addition to increasing muscle strength (for review see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Odom et al., 2007</xref>). SSPN is unique and offers numerous advantages over current therapeutic strategies. The SSPN cDNA is under 1 kb, which is well within the range for easy packaging into adeno-associated viral vectors for delivery, circumventing the necessity to generate recombinant forms of SSPN. Because SSPN is expressed in a variety of nonmuscle tissues, even in dystrophin deficiency, increasing the expression of SSPN in skeletal muscle should not pose an immune threat. One therapeutic angle for the treatment of DMD is to identify small molecules that up-regulate utrophin protein expression. Our findings now establish that SSPN regulates utrophin protein levels and localization within the myofiber.</p><p>The results in this study were unexpected because, for nearly 10 yr, the precise function of SSPN has remained elusive. Our experiments show that SSPN is a critical mediator of protein interactions within UGC and raise the possibility that SSPN contributes to the assembly and targeting of the UGC. This is impressive considering that SSPN, the smallest member of the complex, must orchestrate proper structural arrangement of over seven large peripheral and integral membrane proteins. These properties are unique to SSPN and suggest that gene therapeutic strategies targeting SSPN expression may be beneficial for the treatment of DMD.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Generation of SSPN-Tg:<italic>mdx</italic> mice</title><p>Transgenic constructs were engineered with the human skeletal actin promoter and the VP1 intron upstream of hSSPN as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Crawford et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Spencer et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Peter et al., 2007</xref>).
