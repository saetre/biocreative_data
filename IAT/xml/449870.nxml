Interspecies cDNA array-based comparative genomic hybridization was used to individually compare copy number variation for 39,711 cDNAs, representing 29,619 human genes, across five hominoid species, including human. We identified 1,005 genes, either as isolated genes or in clusters positionally biased toward rearrangement-prone genomic regions, that produced relative hybridization signals unique to one or more of the hominoid lineages. Measured as a function of the evolutionary age of each lineage, genes showing copy number expansions were most pronounced in human (134) and include a number of genes thought to be involved in the structure and function of the brain. This work represents, to our knowledge, the first genome-wide gene-based survey of gene duplication across hominoid species. The genes identified here likely represent a significant majority of the major gene copy number changes that have occurred over the past 15 million years of human and great ape evolution and are likely to underlie some of the key phenotypic characteristics that distinguish these species.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="toc"><p>This genome-wide analysis reports the major lineage-specific gene copy number changes that have occurred over the past 15 million years of human and great ape evolution</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><sec id="s1a"><title>Gene and Genome Evolution</title><p>The evolution of genomes has been primarily driven by single basepair mutation, chromosomal rearrangement, and gene duplication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020207-Ohno1">Ohno 1970</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020207-Samonte1">Samonte and Eichler 2002</xref>), with the latter being the key mechanism for generating new genes and biological processes that facilitated the evolution of complex organisms from primitive ones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020207-Li1">Li 1997</xref>). These factors are thought to also be important in hominoid evolution and speciation, although a systematic assessment of the relative contribution of each has not yet been possible.</p><p>Over the past few years, as the human genome sequence has become available, it has become apparent that recent segmental duplications in the human genome are far more frequent than originally believed, comprising approximately 5&#x00025; of the available sequence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020207-Bailey1">Bailey et al. 2001</xref>). Duplicated regions can range from one to several hundred kilobases in size and show very high sequence similarity (90&#x00025;&#x02013;100&#x00025;) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020207-Bailey1">Bailey et al. 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020207-Stankiewicz1">Stankiewicz and Lupski 2002</xref>). While such regions can pose unusually difficult challenges for accurate genome assembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020207-Cheung1">Cheung et al. 2003</xref>), they are also likely to be among the most evolutionarily recent duplications and thus are among the most important to human speciation and evolution.</p></sec><sec id="s1b"><title>Interspecies cDNA Array-Based Comparative Genomic Hybridization</title><p>The assessment of DNA copy number changes between different human genomes has been aided by the development of comparative genomic hybridization (CGH), which originally involved cohybridizing differentially labeled test and reference genomic DNAs to normal metaphase chromosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020207-Kallioniemi1">Kallioniemi et al. 1992</xref>). A cytogenetic representation of copy number variation was obtained by scoring the resulting fluorescence ratios along the length of the chromosome. Increased resolution was obtained through the subsequent use of arrayed sets of either large genomic DNA clones or cDNA clones (array CGH &#x0005b;aCGH&#x0005d;) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020207-Pinkel1">Pinkel et al. 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020207-Pollack1">Pollack et al. 1999</xref>), with the latter having the advantage of permitting the analysis of individual genes.</p><p>While cDNA microarrays, containing sequences derived from tens of thousands of genes, have been used extensively to profile mRNA expression levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020207-Schena1">Schena et al. 1995</xref>), their use in aCGH is technically more challenging. Human genomic DNA represents at least a 20-fold increase in complexity compared to human cellular mRNA, and the cDNA array elements represent a smaller (e.g., less than 2 kb), generally more discontinuous hybridization target for a genomic DNA sample. These technical issues notwithstanding, highly reproducible aCGH signals can be obtained using human genomic DNA against high-density human cDNA microarrays, and gene changes as small as an increase or decrease of a single copy can be detected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020207-Pollack1">Pollack et al. 1999</xref>).</p><p>Until now, cDNA aCGH studies have been limited to only within-species comparisons, partly due to concerns related to the increased sequence divergence that would come into play with interspecies applications. Such sequence divergence may produce differential hybridization signals that would be difficult to distinguish from those that arose from copy number changes. Fortunately, despite their significant anatomical and physical differences, hominoid species show a strikingly high degree of similarity at the genome sequence level, with the average sequence divergence values estimated as 1.24&#x00025;, 1.62&#x00025;, and 1.63&#x00025; for human&#x02013;chimp, human&#x02013;gorilla, and chimp&#x02013;gorilla, respectively, and orangutan showing approximately 3.1&#x00025; sequence divergence when compared to human, chimp, or gorilla (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020207-Chen1">Chen and Li 2001</xref>).</p><p>Because of this close sequence conservation, we reasoned that it may be possible to use cDNA aCGH to directly compare the cross-species hybridization signatures of human genes to those of the great apes and to identify genes that have alterations in copy number and/or significant changes in exonic sequence between human and other hominoid species. After we initiated such a cDNA aCGH study, two interhominoid aCGH reports appeared that used arrays containing either cloned or amplified genomic DNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020207-Frazer1">Frazer et al. 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020207-Locke1">Locke et al. 2003</xref>). While these studies provided useful insights into hominoid DNA copy variations, they afforded little direct knowledge of changes in individual gene copy number and covered only limited sections of the genome. In contrast, interhominoid aCGH using human cDNA microarrays, representing more than 29,000 different genes, would allow a level of genomic resolution not previously obtainable and also provide direct data regarding the recent evolutionary history of a significant majority of human and great ape genes.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results/Discussion</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Identification of Lineage-Specific Gene Duplication and Contraction</title><p>Interhominoid cDNA aCGH was carried out in a series of pairwise comparisons using microarrays containing 39,711 human cDNAs, representing the majority of all human genes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="st001">Table S1</xref>). The pairwise comparisons involved using a great ape (or human control) as the test genomic DNA sample (Cy5 red dye) and a sex-matched human as the reference genomic DNA sample (Cy3 green dye) in all comparisons. In each experiment, a test and a reference genomic DNA were simultaneously hybridized to a human cDNA microarray under standard cDNA aCGH conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020207-Pollack1">Pollack et al. 1999</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020207-Pollack2">2002</xref>). Specific test/reference DNAs were bonobo/human, chimp/human, gorilla/human, orangutan/human, and, as a control, human/human. After background was subtracted and data normalized, hybridization signals were scored and fluorescence ratios of the test/reference genomic DNAs determined. Using relatively conservative cutoff values (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>), cDNAs were identified that gave aCGH signatures unique to one or more of the hominoid lineages, permitting such gene changes to be placed within specific evolutionary time frames (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020207-g001">Figure 1</xref>). The TreeView program (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://rana.lbl.gov/EisenSoftware.htm">http://rana.lbl.gov/EisenSoftware.htm</ext-link>) was used for visualization of aCGH data for each gene as it occurred in the genome, permitting a &#x0201c;gene-by-gene&#x0201d; survey of the data and allowing for easy detection of interspecies copy number variations, whether they occur as single isolated genes or as multigene blocks.</p><p>Results of the distribution of lineage-specific (LS) aCGH signatures for different individual hominoid species are presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020207-g002">Figure 2</xref>A. Several lines of evidence indicate that the aCGH signature variations that were obtained are primarily due to gene copy number changes and not to interspecies sequence divergence or highly repetitive sequences (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sg001">Figure S1</xref>; see also <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>). Because bonobos and chimpanzees diverged relatively recently and show a striking degree of sequence similarity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020207-Kaessmann1">Kaessmann et al. 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020207-Wildman1">Wildman et al. 2003</xref>), they were dealt with both as individual lineages as well as a single clade. After collapsing the LS dataset by UniGene cluster to remove redundant cDNAs corresponding to the same gene, 815 different genes were identified that gave aCGH signatures unique to a specific hominoid lineage. Each respective lineage and the numbers of genes identified that showed LS copy number change (increases/decreases) are as follows: human: 134/6; bonobo: 23/17; chimpanzee: 11/4; bonobo/chimpanzee pre-split: 26/11; gorilla: 121/52; and orangutan: 222/188.</p><p>Several interesting features were evident from these data. First, when increases and decreases were scored separately or combined, the number of LS signatures was generally in proportion to the evolutionary age of that lineage, although not in all cases. Bonobo and chimpanzee, from the time since the <italic>Homo/Pan</italic> split, showed fewer LS signatures (92) than did human (140), even though they represent the same evolutionary age. As mentioned below, this is due in large part to the significant number of LS gene copy number increases found in human.</p><p>Second, while all lineages showed more gene copy number increases than decreases, this was most pronounced in humans, with 134 cDNAs representing increases and only six representing decreases. This increase-to-decrease ratio (22.3:1) was significantly greater than that of any of the great apes, which showed ratios ranging from 2.75:1 (chimpanzee) to 1.18:1 (orangutan). It is worth noting that only genes found in the human genome are represented on the cDNA arrays, and if there are genes that are absent in human but present in the great apes, e.g., genes that were lost as the human lineage emerged, those genes would not be part of this analysis. So, while it is likely that the complete loss of both copies of a gene in an LS manner is a rare event, the number of genes identified here as having a reduced copy number specifically in the human lineage may be an underestimate of the true total.</p><p>Third, as mentioned above, for all lineages tested, the number of genes showing LS increases was greater than those showing LS decreases. Determination as to whether this is due to some, as yet unknown, ascertainment bias of the method or whether this is a real evolutionary tendency favoring gene duplication over gene loss will require further investigation. The favoring of gains over losses is even more striking when two additional factors are considered. (1) The fact that the cDNAs were only from human, while likely to be important to the low number of genes showing human lineage-specific (HLS) losses previously mentioned, does not help explain why, for all lineages tested, the number of LS genes showing increases was greater than the number showing decreases. To the contrary, if there were genes not on the microarray because they were only found in one or more of the great ape lineages, inclusion of such genes would be expected to add to the total number of LS increases, making the disparity between increased and decreased LS genes even greater. (2) If human/great ape sequence divergence was responsible for some of the LS aCGH signals that were obtained, it would, if anything, produce a falsely elevated number of LS decreases.</p><p>Fourth, while only orangutan had more LS gene copy number increases (222) than did human (134), when the number of genes showing copy number increases was measured as a function of the evolutionary age of the lineage, human showed the greatest number of expansions of any hominoid. When measured as copy number increases per million years of age, the following values were obtained: human, 26.8; bonobo and chimpanzee since the <italic>Homo/Pan</italic> split, 12; gorilla, 17.3; and orangutan, 17.1.</p><p>We also identified genes that gave aCGH signatures indicative of great ape gene copy number changes, relative to human, that were present in more than one great ape lineage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020207-g002">Figure 2</xref>B). For situations in which two great ape lineages showed copy number losses relative to human, there was a general trend that correlated with evolutionary age of the represented species: <italic>Pan</italic>/gorilla, 16 genes; <italic>Pan</italic>/orangutan, 27, and gorilla/orangutan, 45. For gene increases, this trend continued, with gorilla/orangutan (17) showing more changes than <italic>Pan</italic>/orangutan (nine). Interestingly, <italic>Pan</italic>/gorilla showed a departure from this trend with 28 increased genes, suggesting that gene expansion may have been particularly active in the African great apes as a group. There were also a number of more complex gene copy number changes in the five hominoid lineages, with some species showing an increase relative to human for a particular gene and others showing a decrease. These changes are likely due to more than one event, which may be indicative of a genomic region that is relatively unstable and/or of genes whose copy numbers have been influenced by different selection pressures. We identified 190 genes that showed copy number changes in multiple lineages, bringing the total number of LS genes identified to 1,005, which represents 3.4&#x00025; of the total number of genes tested on the microarrays. Given the relatively conservative selection criteria used (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>), this likely reflects an underestimate of the true total. To visualize the effects of relaxing the selection criteria below a log<sub>2</sub> fluorescence ratio of 0.5, a series of HLS datasets were generated using progressively reduced thresholds. Using values of 0.45, 0.4, 0.35, and 0.3 added 27, 31, 31, and 22 cDNAs, respectively, as the cutoff was progressively lowered. As seen in the TreeView image of these data (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sg002">Figure S2</xref>), while some of the additional cDNAs could plausibly be scored HLS, several appeared to give marginal HLS signals.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Independent Confirmation of Interspecies cDNA aCGH Data: Fluorescence In Situ Hybridization Analysis</title><p>A cluster of several genes located around map position 70 Mb in human Chromosome 5q13.3 showed one of the stronger HLS aCGH signatures. Several of these genes (test probe), as well as a set of flanking genes not shown to be increased in human (control probe), were evaluated by interphase and metaphase fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) using bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) probes (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>). The FISH studies confirmed a duplication of the gene region in human, while the control probe containing a flanking region showed no duplication (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020207-g003">Figure 3</xref>A). Two separate probe signals (and sometimes multiple probe signals) for the test probe could be seen in interphase nuclei with only one signal for the flanking probe; metaphase chromosomes showed a larger signal for the test probe than for the flanking probe. In all of the four great ape species, on the other hand, the FISH analyses showed no duplication of the gene region; all of these experiments showed a single signal for the test probe and a single signal of comparable size for the flanking probe (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020207-g003">Figure 3</xref>B&#x02013;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020207-g003">3</xref>E). The Golden Path (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://genome.ucsc.edu">http://genome.ucsc.edu</ext-link>) genome assembly lists multiple Chromosome 5 locations for some of the HLS cDNAs contained on the positive BAC (e.g., <italic>BIRC1</italic>) and therefore it is likely that the multiple, closely spaced signals seen in some of the human interphase spreads (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020207-g003">Figure 3</xref>A) reflect additional copies of these genes.</p><p>Metaphase FISH showed both the test probe and the flanking probe to be located in the human 5q13 band. Both probes were located in the proximal q arm of the orangutan (PPY) Chromosome 4 and in the p arms of the bonobo (PPA) and chimpanzee (PTR) Chromosomes 4. In the gorilla (GGO), both probes were located on the gorilla Chromosome 19. All of these primate locations are consistent with described evolutionary chromosomal rearrangements, with the orangutan Chromosome 4 considered to be the ancestral Chromosome V (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020207-Stanyon1">Stanyon et al. 1992</xref>). These rearrangements include a pericentric inversion of the ancestral Chromosome V (Chromosome 5 in human, Chromosome 4 in the great apes), in the bonobo and chimpanzee, and a translocation between the ancestral chromosome for human Chromosome 5 and the ancestral chromosome for human Chromosome 17 to form the gorilla Chromosomes 4 and 19.</p><p>It is of interest that, considering the orangutan Chromosome 4 as the ancestral Chromosome V, rearrangements at this site have occurred in all of the other three great ape species (pericentric inversion in bonobo and chimpanzee, translocation in gorilla) and in the human (gene duplication). This region is also involved in spinal muscular atrophy (SMA), which is characterized by deletions of one or more genes in this region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020207-Lefebvre1">Lefebvre et al. 1995</xref>). Taken together these data suggest this region is one of high genomic instability that is relevant to both disease and evolutionary processes.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Independent Confirmation of Interspecies cDNA aCGH Data: Literature-Based Validation</title><sec id="s2c1"><title/><p><bold><italic>FGF7</italic>-like genes.</bold> Some genes we identified as having LS aCGH signatures have been previously studied by others using different methods, which provides a means of independently checking the accuracy of the cDNA aCGH data presented here.

(2002)</xref>, using this BAC showed that the copy number was highly elevated (more than 30 signals) in gorilla relative to all other hominoids tested (fewer than or equal to three signals).</p><p>Further independent support for the accuracy of the aCGH data comes from a comparison of the HLS gene dataset to the segmental duplication dataset generated by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020207-Bailey2">Bailey et al. (2002a)</xref>, who used whole genome shotgun data to generate a genome-wide database (the Whole Genome Shotgun Segmental Duplication &#x0005b;WSSD&#x0005d; database) of recent (less than 40 million years ago &#x0005b;MYA&#x0005d;) segmental duplications for the human genome (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="st002">Table S2</xref>). The majority of changes in copy number of the HLS gene set we identified are likely to have occurred since the <italic>Homo/Pan</italic> split (less than 5&#x02013;6 MYA) and therefore should represent a subset of the segmental duplications found in the WSSD dataset. Results of this analysis confirmed this expectation (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-0020207-t001">Table 1</xref>): 80&#x00025; of HLS genes gave significant basic local alignment search tool (BLAST) scores with the WSSD dataset (as a control, only 13&#x00025; of a randomly selected set of cDNAs were positive for the WSSD dataset), and 57&#x00025; (5414/9461) of the segments in the WSSD were positive with the HLS gene list.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>Non-Random Distribution of LS Genes</title><p>Genes identified as having a variation in copy number specific for one or more hominoid lineages occurred either as single isolated genes or as clusters of genes. This latter category likely reflects LS copy number changes that involved blocks of contiguous genes. In addition, certain specific regions of the genome, while not necessarily composed of contiguously positioned LS genes, showed a marked enrichment for LS genes. Surveying the genome for regions containing contiguous gene clusters of LS genes or for regions highly enriched in LS genes (greater than or equal to eight contiguous or nearly contiguous LS cDNAs) identified 23 prominent sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020207-g005">Figures 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020207-g006">6</xref>; <xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-0020207-t002">Table 2</xref>). Most (18) of these are not randomly distributed in the genome, but instead are found near regions thought to be more genomically and evolutionarily dynamic. Among these are heterochromatic C-band regions, pericentromeric and subtelomeric regions, breakpoints of recent pericentromeric inversions, and sites of recent chromosomal fusions. For example, the two cytogenetic regions with the most LS genes represented were 1p13.2&#x02013;1q21.2 (66 cDNAs) and 9p13.3&#x02013;9q21.12 (77 cDNAs) (see insets in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020207-g005">Figure 5</xref>, regions C and M). Interestingly, these regions are also known to contain C-band regions of heterochromatin which, along with C-band regions at pericentromeric 16 and at the distal end of Yq, are found at these chromosomal locations only in human and are known to be highly polymorphic. (While C-band chromosomal regions contain the alphoid class of repetitive DNA, there are several reasons that argue that the LS signals in these regions are not due to human-specific repetitive DNA. First, several HLS cDNAs were checked and found to contain no repetitive sequences in them. Second, <italic>Cot-1</italic> analyses, described earlier, indicated that HLS signals did not correspond to repetitive DNA regions. Third, the genes in these regions showed LS signals for other hominoid lineages in addition to human.). The regions near the C-band regions on 16 (15 cDNAs) and Y (14 cDNAs) also showed an enrichment of LS genes, although to a lesser extent. These regions, as well as the pericentromeric regions of the acrocentric chromosomes, which showed enrichment for LS genes, are known to contain highly repetitive DNA, which may make them especially prone to recombination and duplication.</p><p>Previous reports have shown that recent (less than 40 MYA) segmental duplications in the human genome are positionally biased and found more frequently in pericentromeric and subtelomeric regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020207-Bailey1">Bailey et al. 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020207-Mefford1">Mefford and Trask 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020207-Samonte1">Samonte and Eichler 2002</xref>). Consistent with this, most of the LS clusters we identified mapped to either pericentromeric (10/23) or subtelomeric (4/23) regions (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-0020207-t002">Table 2</xref>). Also, a recent report by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020207-Bailey3">Bailey et al. (2002b)</xref> showed that a 400 kb HLS duplication transposed from Chromosome 14 to the most proximal pericentromeric region of Chromosome 22 (at approximately 13&#x02013;14 Mb) and suggested that a pericentromeric gradient of duplications exists in which the most recent duplications transpose nearest to the centromere. Data presented here, showing a cluster of LS genes in this same region with HLS changes occurring nearer to the centromere, are consistent with this view.</p><p>Additional clusters were also identified at other sites known to be particularly unstable and prone to rearrangement and duplication. For example, the 5q13 region (see inset to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020207-g005">Figure 5</xref>, region I) is known to be involved in SMA, and deletions in the <italic>BIRC1</italic> gene, which we show is amplified uniquely in humans, are sometimes found in SMA patients. This region and another at 5p14.3&#x02013;5p13.3 that also contains a cluster of LS genes are near the breakpoint sites of a pericentric inversion that occurred during hominoid speciation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020207-Yunis1">Yunis and Prakash 1982</xref>). Another unstable region, the 2q14.1 region (see inset to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020207-g005">Figure 5</xref>, region F), is known to be the site at which two ancestral ape chromosomes fused telomere-to-telomere to form human Chromosome 2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020207-IJdo1">IJdo et al. 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020207-Fan1">Fan et al. 2002</xref>). This region shows a complex pattern of LS genes, with aCGH gene signatures specific for at least four different hominoid lineage combinations represented within a genomic region of only 400 kb. Enrichment of LS genes was also found in regions associated with other genetic disorders, including Di George syndrome, Williams&#x02013;Beuren syndrome, and Angelman and Prader&#x02013;Willi syndromes. Taken together, these data support the view that regions of the genome that are particularly unstable are enriched for LS gene copy number changes and are often disease-associated hotspots of evolutionary change.</p><p>To assess the frequency and type of repeated sequences associated with the HLS gene and LS gene cluster datasets, the repeat content near these genes was determined. Of known repeat classes surveyed, only the Satellite class showed a major deviation from the overall genome frequency (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-0020207-t002">Table 2</xref>). Satellite repeats associated with LS gene clusters and HLS genes were 10-fold and 4-fold enriched, respectively, over the genome average frequency. This may not be unexpected given the known pericentromeric and subtelomeric positional bias of Satellite sequences and their known involvement in interchromosomal duplication processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020207-Horvath1">Horvath et al. 2000</xref>). Relative frequencies of the subclasses of Satellite sequences associated with each cluster can be found in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="st003">Table S3</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="s2e"><title>Genes Showing HLS Variation in Copy Number</title><p>Of the 140 genes showing HLS variation in copy number, 134 represented human gene increases and six represented decreases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020207-g007">Figure 7</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="st004">Table S4</xref>). While roughly half of these genes were represented as expressed sequence tags (ESTs) or uncharacterized genes with little or no information as to possible biological function, the remaining cDNAs corresponded to known genes. Among this latter category were a number with interesting predicted functional characteristics. For example, the gene encoding the neuronal apoptosis inhibitory protein (NAIP or <italic>BIRC1</italic>) maps to Chromosome 5q13 and was elevated specifically in the human lineage. NAIP has been implicated in delaying neuronal programmed cell death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020207-Liston1">Liston et al. 1996</xref>) and is known to have at least one duplicated copy in the genome that appears to be functional (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020207-Xu1">Xu et al. 2002</xref>). If an increase in gene dosage results in an elevated functional effect, the possibility exists that such an LS increase in NAIP gene copy number may contribute to an increase in neuronal proliferation and/or brain size (either globally or regionally) in humans.</p><p>Several other genes implicated in neuronal function showed HLS changes in copy number: a neurotransmitter transporter for &#x003b3;-aminobutyric acid (GABA) (<italic>SLC6A13</italic>), a leucine zipper-containing gene highly expressed in brain (<italic>KIAAA0738</italic>), &#x003b1;7 cholinergic receptor/<italic>Fam7</italic> fusion gene (<italic>CHRFAM7A</italic>), a p21-activated kinase (<italic>PAK2</italic>), a Rho GTPase-activating protein (<italic>SRGAP2</italic>), a Rho guanine nucleotide exchange factor (<italic>ARHGEF5</italic>) that is a member of the rhodopsin-like G protein-coupled receptor family, and Rho-dependent protein kinase (<italic>ROCK1</italic>). Inhibition of <italic>ROCK1</italic> has been shown to prevent long-term memory, and <italic>ROCK1</italic>, together with a RhoGEF and RhoGAP, have been recently implicated in a model of long-term memory based on fear conditioning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020207-Lamprecht1">Lamprecht et al. 2002</xref>). Also, members of the ARHGEF, PAK, and RhoGAP gene families comprise a disproportionately high fraction of the genes known to produce syndromic or nonsyndromic forms of mental retardation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020207-Ramakers1">Ramakers 2000</xref>).</p><p>Another gene showing an HLS copy number increase, <italic>USP10</italic>, encodes a ubiquitin-specific protease, an enzymatic class implicated in learning and memory and in synaptic growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020207-DiAntonio1">DiAntonio et al. 2001</xref>). Overexpression of the <italic>USP10</italic> homologue in <italic>Drosophila</italic> leads to uncontrolled synaptic overgrowth and elaboration of the synaptic branching pattern (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020207-DiAntonio1">DiAntonio et al. 2001</xref>), raising the possibility that the human-specific copy number increase for <italic>USP10</italic> could be relevant to expanded synaptic growth in humans. Interestingly, the <italic>USP10</italic> gene at Chromosome 16q24 and an unknown gene (integrated molecular analysis of genomes and their expression &#x0005b;IMAGE&#x0005d; 854706) at Chromosome 19q13 that is significantly elevated in human relative to most hominoids map to the two chromosomal regions giving the highest LOD scores in a recent genome-wide scan related to specific language impairment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020207-SLI1">SLI Consortium 2002</xref>).</p><p>The aquaporin 7 gene (<italic>AQP7</italic>), which is thought to be involved in water transport across membranes, shows an HLS increase in copy number, while the genes immediately flanking it (<italic>NFX1</italic> and <italic>AQP3</italic>) do not show HLS aCGH signals. Similarly, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020207-Bailey2">Bailey et al. (2002a)</xref> predict that a 22 kb region containing the <italic>AQP7</italic> gene has been recently (less than 40 MYA) duplicated several times while flanking regions show no recent duplication. These data suggest that a series of HLS segmental duplications occurred that focused primarily on the <italic>AQP7</italic> gene, which spans 17 kb of the 22 kb duplication. This observation, together with the fact that several of the additional <italic>AQP7</italic> copies appear to be potentially functional (see below), raises the possibility that significant selection pressure may have been exerted on <italic>AQP7</italic>-like genes specifically in the human lineage.</p></sec><sec id="s2f"><title>Genes Showing Copy Number Variation Specific to One or More Great Ape Lineages</title><p>In addition to identifying HLS gene changes, interhominoid cDNA aCGH allows genes to be identified that have changed during other branch points within the past 15 MY of hominoid evolutionary history.

Among genes elevated in copy number in chimpanzees are several with possible relevance to immune function, including the <italic>BMI1</italic> gene (B-cell lymphoma Mo-MLV insertion region) and, in bonobos and chimps, the <italic>FCER2</italic> gene, encoding a lymphocyte IgE receptor, and the <italic>IL1RL1</italic> gene encoding an interleukin receptor 1-like protein. Also, it has been shown that chimpanzees can synthesize a form of sialic acid while humans cannot, owing to the loss of function in humans of a specific sialic acid hydroxylase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020207-Muchmore1">Muchmore et al. 1998</xref>). Interestingly, one of the genes elevated in chimpanzees and bonobos encodes a CMP-sialic acid transporter (SLC35A1).</p><p>As mentioned previously, of genes specifically amplified in the gorilla lineage, the <italic>FLJ22004</italic> gene showed the largest gorilla-specific aCGH signal increase. While the function of this gene is unknown, the encoded protein contains a <italic>DUF6</italic> domain, which is found in the <italic>Erwinia</italic> PecM protein involved in cellulase and pectinase regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020207-Rieder1">Rieder et al. 1998</xref>). Interestingly, gorillas more than any other hominoid are folivorous. They eat leaves primarily, but also (like other hominoids) fruit, foods that contain energy-rich cellulose and pectin. This fact, together with the observation that <italic>FLJ22004</italic> is highly amplified only in the gorilla lineage, raises the possibility that amplification of this gene provides enhanced cellulase and pectinase capabilities, which in turn would facilitate utilization of the two key dietary staples of this species.</p><p>Another gene specifically increased in gorilla (average log<sub>2</sub> ratio = 2.02) encodes the fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 (FGFR3), which when disrupted in humans causes achondroplasia, the most frequent form of short-limb dwarfism. The <italic>SET8</italic> gene is also significantly elevated in copy number only in gorilla (average log<sub>2</sub> ratio = 2.65) and also related to development. The gene encodes a transcription factor and appears to be homologous (protein similarity of 43&#x00025; over 110 amino acids) to the <named-content content-type="genus-species">Drosophila trithorax</named-content> gene, which functions in segmentation determination through interaction with <italic>bithorax</italic> and <italic>antennapedia</italic> complex genes, suggesting that it may serve a role in gorilla-specific development. There were a significant number of genes (28) showing increased copy numbers specifically in the African great apes (bonobo, chimpanzee, and gorilla). Among these were the <italic>MSTP028</italic> gene, encoding a voltage gated potassium channel; the <italic>PLA2G4B</italic> gene, encoding phospholipase A2&#x003b2;, which shows high brain and (in particular) cerebellar expression; and the <italic>SPTBN5</italic> gene, which encodes a nonerythroid spectrin. <italic>SPTBN5</italic> is immediately adjacent to <italic>PLA2G4B</italic> at Chromosome 15q15.1 in the genome and, like <italic>PLA2G4B</italic>, shows high cerebellar expression, raising the possibility that their function(s) in the African great apes may be linked. Finally, while the HLS and LS genes mentioned above have interesting biological implications related to human and great ape differences, each should be viewed as tentatively HLS or LS until the interhominoid copy number differences for these genes are confirmed by independent methods.</p></sec><sec id="s2g"><title>Functional Classification of HLS and LS Genes</title><p>Classification of HLS and LS genes according to predicted molecular function was carried out by Gene Ontology (GO) analysis. For the great majority of functional categories, both HLS and LS gene groups gave GO distributions similar to that found with all known genes (UniGene collapsed set), with ligand binding, catalytic activity, signal transducer activity, and transporter activity being the four most highly represented functional categories (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sg004">Figure S4</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="st005">Table S5</xref>). This analysis should be tempered somewhat by the fact that almost half of all HLS and LS genes are unclassified or lack functional information and that some human genes are not present on the microarrays used (e.g., only 20&#x02013;30 olfactory receptor-related cDNAs were on the microarrays while, in hominoids, this family is thought to be comprised of several hundred functional members &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020207-Gilad1">Gilad et al. 2003</xref>&#x0005d;).</p><p>It can be expected that copies arising from gene duplications will be a mix of functional genes and pseudogenes, the exact ratio of which will vary depending on the gene involved. Although definitive assessment of the functional status of the copies of HLS genes identified here requires additional study, a preliminary analysis of several HLS genes, including those mentioned above, found this general trend to be evident (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="st006">Table S6</xref>). For example, analysis of BLAST-like alignment tool (BLAT) hits for the <italic>AQP7</italic> gene predicts that of seven closely related (greater than 90&#x00025;) copies in the genome, at least four appear to be potentially functional. In contrast, the <italic>FLJ13263</italic> gene had four closely related sequences, and these all appear to be pseudogene-like. Finally, the fact that it has been shown that pseudogenes can play important functional roles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020207-Hirotsune1">Hirotsune et al. 2003</xref>) implies that one cannot assume that even bonafide pseudogene copies will necessarily be functionally silent or unimportant to evolutionary differences between species.</p></sec><sec id="s2h"><title>Human and Chimpanzee Genome Sequences</title><p>A human versus chimpanzee genome comparison is now publicly available, through the University of California, Santa Cruz (UCSC) database's best reciprocal alignment of the July 2003 human genome and the November 2003 Arachne 4X chimpanzee draft genome (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://genome.ucsc.edu/goldenPath/hg16/versusPt0/">http://genome.ucsc.edu/goldenPath/hg16/versusPt0/</ext-link>). Using this comparison, we have determined that genes that gave aCGH signatures indicative of copy number increase specifically in the human lineage, showed a 7-fold increase in the frequency of gaps and absent sequence homology in the chimpanzee draft compared to a randomly selected gene (EST) set (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="st007">Table S7</xref>). Such a pronounced bias would be expected for genes with significant copy number increases in human relative to chimpanzee, independently supporting the accuracy of the HLS gene dataset we have defined.</p><p>However, a limitation of only comparing the human and chimpanzee genomes is that no out-group analysis is provided, preventing discrimination of ancestral and derived forms and limiting the ability to identify gene copy number changes unique to a specific hominoid lineage. In contrast, the interhominoid aCGH studies described here provide reliable genome-wide data for out-group analysis across five primate species, allowing easy identification of LS copy number differences.</p><p>In order to provide some perspective on the importance of out-group data when trying to identify LS gene changes, a comparison was carried out between two aCGH clone sets. One set contained 153 genes we identified by cDNA aCGH that were specifically increased in copy number in the human lineage when compared to each of the four great ape lineages (i.e., HLS). The other clone set, while derived from the same aCGH experiments using the same cutoff values, contained 353 genes that showed aCGH signals in which the human copy number was greater than the chimpanzee (i.e., &#x0201c;human &#x0003e; chimp&#x0201d;). Comparison of these two datasets allows one to determine how frequently a &#x0201c;human &#x0003e; chimp&#x0201d; gene is also HLS (i.e., human copy number is greater than <italic>each</italic> of the four great apes studied). Of the 353 genes that were &#x0201c;human &#x0003e; chimp,&#x0201d; 200 were not found in the HLS set, indicating that over half (57&#x00025;) of the &#x0201c;human &#x0003e; chimp&#x0201d; genes were not HLS.</p><p>It has been pointed out that the human genome is a mosaic composed of some regions more closely related to chimpanzee and, less frequently, others more closely related to gorilla (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020207-Paabo1">P&#x000e4;&#x000e4;bo 2003</xref>). Data presented here contain a number of examples of genes showing such evolutionary histories, but also contains examples of other more complex phylogenetic patterns (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020207-g007">Figure 7</xref>; see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="st004">Table S4</xref>). For example, the significant number of genes showing copy number increases or decreases specifically in the African great apes, in which human and orangutan copy numbers were equivalent to one another, suggests that either more than one event occurred to produce this distribution or the genomic mosaicism found in the human genome extends back to include sequences present at the time the orangutan lineage split. Because of this unusual phylogenetic profile, we tested several such cDNAs by interhominoid real-time PCR (RT-PCR) and FISH as an independent verification of our aCGH results. In all cases, copy number estimates based on RT-PCR analysis showed high correlation (0.94&#x02013;0.97) to estimates based on our aCGH data (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sg005">Figure S5</xref>). Interestingly, FISH analysis using a BAC probe containing two genes (<italic>PLA2G4B</italic> and <italic>SPTBN5</italic>) specifically elevated in the African great apes, showed that, in chimpanzee, signals were widely distributed among many chromosomes, while in gorilla the signals were restricted to two sites, one single copy and the other multicopy (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sg001">Figure S6</xref>). These results indicate that the increase in gene copy number in gorilla and chimp occurred independently of each other and therefore support the view that multiple separate events are likely responsible for the African great ape-specific aCGH signals we obtained.</p><p>In summary, the dataset presented here, containing over 714,000 aCGH datapoints, represents to our knowledge the first genome-wide survey of gene duplication and loss across five hominoid species. The changes identified likely represent most of the major LS gene-associated copy number changes that have occurred over the past 15 MY of human and great ape evolution. Further analyses of this dataset, of which only a fraction has been highlighted here, should provide additional insights into gene duplication and genome evolution, the relationship of genome instability, evolutionary adaptation, and disease, and the genes that underlie the phenotypic differences among human and great ape species.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Copy Number Variation, Sequence Divergence, and Repetitive Sequences</title><p>Though discussed above as copy number alterations, changes in cross-species cDNA aCGH signals could be due to changes in gene copy number between species, to pronounced exonic sequence divergence of the gene between species, or to a combination of both. To attempt to distinguish among these possibilities, we took advantage of the fact that, while cDNAs are randomly positioned on the microarrays, for analysis purposes they had previously been computationally grouped into two categories: cDNAs with single known genome locations (i.e., unique location) and cDNAs that mapped to multiple genomic locations (multiple locations). In this latter category, we also included a minority of cDNAs that had no assignable location in the genome assembly. We identified HLS cDNAs that showed stronger hybridization with human DNA (green signals in all great ape/human comparisons) and determined how many of these occurred in each of the two mapping categories. HLS signatures were found for 0.185&#x00025; of unique location cDNAs (66/35,680) and 2.88&#x00025; of multiple location cDNAs (116/4,031), a frequency difference of more than an order of magnitude (approximately 1:16).</p><p>Such a strong enrichment, in the multiple location category, of genes showing increased human aCGH signals specific to the human lineage would be expected if such genes were present as multiple closely related copies with distinct genome locations and, as a result, were placed in the multiple location group. No such gene distribution bias would be expected if the LS signatures were mainly due to sequence divergence.</p><p>Additionally, we estimated what fraction of LS cDNAs in each species were cDNAs with multiple human map positions. Values of 59&#x00025;, 10&#x00025;, 13&#x00025;, 14&#x00025;, 10&#x00025;, and 20&#x00025; were obtained for human, bonobo, chimp, bonobo/chimp total, gorilla, and orangutan, respectively, providing further support that the increased (i.e., green in all great ape:human comparisons) HLS aCGH signatures that were obtained are likely due to gene copy number increases specific to the human lineage.</p><p>We also carried out interhominoid FISH using a BAC probe (RP11-93K3) containing a gene (IMAGE 1882505) that gave a reduced signal specifically in the orangutan lineage, which is the lineage where sequence divergence might have its greatest artifactual contribution. Resulting FISH data (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sg001">Figure S1</xref>) showed 10&#x02013;15 signals in human, bonobo, chimpanzee, and gorilla, while for orangutan only two signals were evident. Finally, further evidence of aCGH data reflecting copy number change comes from the three examples of literature-based validation of aCGH-predicted copy number changes (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020207-g004">Figure 4</xref>). In all three cases, the orangutan signals were reduced relative to the human signals, and each of these genes were shown in published reports to have fewer copies in orangutan relative to human.</p><p>Lastly, to address the possibility that such signals might be due to highly repetitive sequences associated with LS genes that were not effectively blocked during hybridization, we examined the cDNA sequences of five cDNAs that showed stronger hybridization with human DNA. In all cases no repeats were found that would account for the HLS aCGH data.

Selection of LS cDNAs was based on the following criteria: First, for a given cDNA and a given species, no more than one value out of the species versus human comparisons for that species could be absent (see aCGH methods regarding absent signals). Second, for a gene copy number change to be considered unique to a particular species, at least half of the absolute values of comparisons within that species had to meet or exceed a threshold of 0.5 with all such values in the same direction, i.e., either all positive or all negative, and at least half of the absolute values of comparisons within each of the remaining species had to be below a threshold of 0.5. For example, for a gorilla LS gene, at least half of the gorilla comparisons had to meet or exceed the 0.5 threshold, while at least half of the comparisons within each of the remaining species had to be below the threshold. Third, in order to compensate for missing (i.e., &#x0201c;absent&#x0201d;) values for a given cDNA of all &#x0201c;present&#x0201d; values within each species, no more than one could fall below the threshold (0.5) for each species. Fourth, to ensure sufficiently high signal-to-noise in the identification of altered ratios, for a given cDNA and given great ape species, each absolute value of the average of the species versus human comparison for that species had to be at least 2.5-fold greater than the absolute value of each remaining species average, including human versus human comparisons. For HLS genes, the absolute value of each species average of the great ape versus human comparisons had to be at least 2.5-fold greater than the average of the absolute value of the human versus human comparisons.</p></sec><sec id="s3e2"><title>Genes showing copy number variation unique to more than one hominoid lineage</title><p>For cDNAs in which the copy number was either increased or decreased in two or more hominoids relative to all the other hominoids, the same criteria were used as before, except the cDNA would have to meet or exceed the 0.5 threshold selection criteria for more than one species.</p></sec><sec id="s3e3"><title>Relationship of aCGH signal to gene copy number</title><p>It is difficult to establish a precise relationship between gene copy number and interhominoid aCGH ratio because sequence divergence can influence hybridization signal strength and the sequences of additional gene copies are, in almost all cases, not known. However, prior studies by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020207-Pollack1">Pollack et al. (1999)</xref> showed that, using cell lines containing increasing numbers of X chromosomes, copy number, and aCGH signal exhibited a linear relationship over the copy number range tested, with an increase of a single gene copy corresponding to a ratio of 1.31 (log<sub>2</sub> value = 0.39). In a similar manner, we took advantage of the fact the one of the human-to-human comparisons used in our experiments was between a male and female. In this context, X chromosome genes in the female should be present as two copies while in the male will exist as one copy. Calculation of the average aCGH ratios of 957 such genes in the male/female comparison yielded a log<sub>2</sub> value of 0.21. The different values obtained in these two tests may reflect the fact that in the male/female comparison a Y chromosome was present, while this was not true in the other study, which used XO cell lines. The presence of sequences on the Y that are shared with the X could have produced a compression of aCGH fluorescence ratio values, accounting for the difference in X chromosome-related log<sub>2</sub> ratios described above. Similar compression effects on X chromosome ratios have recently been reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020207-Snijders1">Snijders et al. 2001</xref>). While both the 0.39 and 0.21 values fall below the 0.5 threshold we employed for the selection of LS genes, 0.5 was used to insure that selection of false positives was minimized. In an interhominoid aCGH study, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020207-Locke1">Locke et al. (2003)</xref> also determined a threshold of 0.5 to be most appropriate. Finally, the use of this relatively conservative threshold implies that the numbers presented here are likely to be underestimates of the actual number of genes that exhibit LS copy number differences between these hominoids.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3f"><title>FISH Analysis</title><p>Using standard procedures, metaphase spreads and interphase nuclei were prepared from human lymphocytes (<named-content content-type="genus-species">Homo sapiens</named-content> &#x0005b;HSA&#x0005d;) and from great ape fibroblast cell lines, obtained from Coriell.

For each species, two separate hybridizations were performed: one with the probe containing the genes showing increased human copy number labeled with Spectrum Green and the flanking probe with Spectrum Orange, and the other in which the dyes were reversed. For each probe combination for each species, a minimum of 200 interphase nuclei and ten metaphase spreads were examined. A whole chromosome painting probe for human Chromosome 5 (wcp5; Vysis) was used to confirm the gorilla Chromosome 19 to be syntenic with the human Chromosome 5 for the region of interest.</p><p>The hominoid cell lines used for FISH analysis were grown asynchronously in monolayer culture. Metaphase spreads and nuclei were obtained from a shake-off preparation and thus were somewhat selected for proliferative activity. Similarly, human lymphocyte cultures stimulated with the mitogen phytohemagglutinin contain cells in various stages of the cell cycle. In order to judge the replication state of the nuclei scored, dual-color FISH assays included probes both for DNA sequences that by aCGH showed copy number difference between test and reference DNA and for sequences on the same human chromosome that had the same (diploid) number of copies. Nuclei that showed diploid copy number of this control probe were assessed to be in G<sub>0</sub>. Nuclei that were in S/G<sub>2</sub> demonstrated four copies of the control probe and the test probes were proportionately in multiple copies of the number established in the nonproliferating cells.

Specific test DNAs were, left to right, human (H) (<italic>n</italic> = 5), bonobo (B) (<italic>n</italic> = 3), chimpanzee (C) (<italic>n</italic> = 4), gorilla (G) (<italic>n</italic> = 3), and orangutan (O) (<italic>n</italic> = 3). Each horizontal row represents aCGH data for one cDNA clone on the microarray, while each vertical column represents data from one microarray experiment. Regions shown contain LS genes (vertical black lines) and adjacent flanking genes ordered by chromosome map position using the UCSC Golden Path genome assembly (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://genome.ucsc.edu">http://genome.ucsc.edu</ext-link>), November 2002 sequence freeze. Arrows denote for which hominoid lineage the copy number change is unique. Note that fluorescence ratios (pseudocolor scale indicated) reflect copy number changes relative to the human genome. For great ape LS changes, red signal is interpreted according to parsimony as increased gene copy number, and green signal as decreased gene copy number in the specific ape lineage, while increased or decreased gene copy number specific to the human lineage is represented by green or red signal, respectively, in all the great ape lineages. Gray signal indicates cDNA comparisons scored as absent.

The numbers reflect totals after collapsing the dataset by UniGene cluster to remove redundant cDNAs corresponding to the same gene. Bonobo represents genes unique to this species; likewise with chimpanzee. &#x0201c;Bonobo and chimpanzee (pre-split)&#x0201d; refers to genes that were changed in both species and therefore likely occurred before these species diverged, and &#x0201c;bonobo and chimpanzee (total)&#x0201d; refers to the sum of the previous three categories, which was chosen to represent the period since the <italic>Homo/Pan</italic> split.

In general, selection required that at least half of the cDNAs in the cluster be lineage-specific (i.e., changed in one or more hominoid lineage) and that at least eight LS cDNAs be present. Cytogenetic and nucleotide positions were obtained from the UCSC Golden Path genome assembly November 2002 sequence freeze. cDNA totals reflect estimated numbers of LS cDNAs within the indicated interval.
