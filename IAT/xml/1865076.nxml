It plays important roles in epithelial and germ cell development, particularly by repressing c-Myc and Id2 genes and modulating the balance between proliferation and differentiation of progenitor cells. In this study, we show that Ovol1 negatively regulates its own expression by binding to and repressing the activity of its promoter. We further demonstrate that Ovol1 uses both passive and active repression mechanisms to auto-repress: (1) it antagonizes transcriptional activation of c-Myb, a known positive regulator of proliferation, by competing for DNA binding; (2) it recruits histone deacetylase activity to the promoter via an N-terminal SNAG repressor domain. At Ovol1 cognate sites in the endogenous <italic>Ovol1</italic> promoter, c-Myb binding correlates with increased histone acetylation, whereas the expression of Ovol1 correlates with a displacement of c-Myb from the DNA and decreased histone acetylation. Collectively, our data suggest that Ovol1 restricts its own expression by counteracting c-Myb activation and histone acetylation of the <italic>Ovol1</italic> promoter.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>The evolutionarily conserved <italic>ovo</italic> genes encode C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>2</sub> zinc finger transcription factors and act downstream of Wg(Wnt)/&#x003b2;-catenin and TGF-&#x003b2;/BMP signaling pathways that have been widely implicated in normal and malignant development of myriad tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>). Functional studies in several organisms have demonstrated an involvement of <italic>ovo</italic> genes in the development and differentiation of a number of epithelial lineages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2 B3 B4 B5 B6 B7">2&#x02013;7</xref>). However, less progress has been made on the biochemical mechanism by which Ovo proteins function to regulate gene expression in these biological processes.</p><p><italic>Ovol1</italic> is expressed in the epithelial tissues of hair follicles, interfollicular epidermis, kidney, as well as in the male germinal epithelium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>). In these tissues, <italic>Ovol1</italic> expression correlates with the onset of terminal differentiation of progenitor cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7 B8 B9">7&#x02013;9</xref>). <italic>Ovol1</italic> knockout mice display pleiotropic defects including ruffled hairs, a hyperproliferative epidermis, defective spermatogenesis and cystic kidneys (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7 B8 B9 B10">7&#x02013;10</xref>). A common theme of <italic>Ovol1</italic> function appears to be promoting the transition from a proliferating, less differentiated state to a post-mitotic, more differentiated state. In epidermis, <italic>Ovol1</italic> is required for embryonic epidermal progenitor cells to efficiently exit proliferation to embark on the terminal differentiation process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>). During spermatogenesis, <italic>Ovol1</italic> is required for germ cells to exit from mitosis and enter meiosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>). <italic>Ovol1</italic> likely plays a similar role in kidney epithelial cells, as it is known that over-proliferation of these cells results in kidney cyst formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>). Three downstream targets of Ovol1 have been identified: c-Myc, Id2 and <italic>Ovol2</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8 B9 B10">8&#x02013;10</xref>). These genes are expressed in proliferating progenitor cells and their expression is up-regulated when <italic>Ovol1</italic> is deleted. Both c-Myc and Id2 are known to have pro-proliferation and/or anti-differentiation roles, and therefore their negative regulation by Ovol1 is consistent with the growth inhibitory function of Ovol1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>).</p><p>Feedback control is common for important regulators of development. Genetic evidence suggests that <italic>Drosophila ovo</italic> auto-regulates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>), underlying the importance of an intricate regulation of <italic>ovo</italic> gene expression. This raises the interesting possibility that <italic>Ovol1</italic> might be a target of transcriptional repression by its own gene product. Distinct from <italic>Drosophila ovo</italic> and mouse <italic>Ovol2</italic>, which encode multiple protein isoforms with either transcriptional activator or repressor activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14 B15 B16">14&#x02013;16</xref>), <italic>Ovol1</italic> encodes a single polypeptide with transcriptional repressor activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7 B8 B9">7&#x02013;9</xref>). In this study, we address whether Ovol1 represses its own expression and how it represses transcription at a mechanistic level.</p><p>The predominant mode of action of a sequence-specific DNA-binding transcriptional repressor in eukaryotes is to recruit co-repressor complexes to its target promoters (active repression). Many sequence-specific repressors recruit histone deacetylases (HDACs), either directly or via adaptor proteins such as Sin3 [reviewed in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>)]. HDACs, opposing the function of histone acetylases, catalyze the deacetylation of lysine residues of core histone tails. This results in a more compact chromatin structure and consequently decreased accessibility for transcription factors. Two of the class I HDACs, HDAC1 and HDAC2, have been most widely implicated in transcriptional repression by myriad DNA-binding repressors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>). Transcriptional repression can also occur by a passive mechanism, where repressors interfere with the function of transcriptional activators, for example by competing for binding to common DNA sequences [reviewed in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>)]. Does Ovol1 interact biochemically or functionally with such repressors or activators? Such insight will add to our overall understanding of molecular pathways underlying the control of epithelial cell proliferation and differentiation, and might implicate additional potential players in this important process. Here we provide evidence that Ovol1 negatively regulates its own expression by binding to and repressing the <italic>Ovol1</italic> promoter. We further demonstrate that Ovol1 represses transcription using both passive (competing with the c-Myb transcriptional activator, a known positive regulator of proliferation) and active (recruiting HDAC1) repression mechanisms.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>CASTing (cyclic amplification of selected targets)</title><p>An 80-bp oligonucleotide was synthesized (IDT Technologies), which contained 35-base random nucleotides flanked by sequences complementary to primers A and B for cloning purposes.

A random sequence library of double-stranded radiolabeled oligonucleotides was prepared by annealing the 80-base oligonucleotide to 5-fold molar excess of primer B followed by extension with Klenow. The extension reaction for the annealed double-stranded oligonucleotide was performed in 50&#x02009;&#x003bc;l of the labeling reaction mixture that contained 50&#x02009;mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 10&#x02009;mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 100&#x02009;&#x003bc;M each of dATP, dGTP and dTTP and 5&#x02009;&#x003bc;l of 3000&#x02009;Ci/nmol of [&#x003b1;-<sup>32</sup>P]-dCTP. The labeling reaction mixture was incubated at 37&#x000b0;C for 1&#x02009;h with 5 units of the Klenow enzyme (Stratagene). The radiolabeled DNA was purified by using G-50 Nick columns (Amersham) and subjected to EMSA.

The amplified DNA was purified using G-50 Nick columns, and was used in subsequent EMSA experiments. After four cycles of CASTing, the final amplified DNA was cloned directly using pCR2.1-TOPO TA Cloning kit (Invitrogen). Nucleotide sequences of 105 independent clones were determined.

First, we generated recombinant proteins containing only the C-terminal (amino acids 107&#x02013;267, including the zinc finger domain) or the N-terminal half (amino acids 1&#x02013;107, lacking the zinc finger domain) of Ovol1 and tested their ability to bind to <italic>Ovol1D</italic>. The C-terminal half retained the ability to bind but the N-terminal half did not (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>C), indicating that the DNA-binding moiety of Ovol1 is the zinc finger domain. Second, we performed footprinting experiments using a 370-bp <italic>Ovol1</italic> promoter fragment (corresponding to &#x02212;356 to +15&#x02009;bp) encompassing both the proximal and distal Ovol1-binding sites to determine the nucleotide contacts of Ovol1 in a large sequence context. Under the experimental conditions used, increasing concentrations of recombinant Ovol1 created a single DNase I footprint of &#x0223c;19&#x02009;bp encompassing the proximal but not the distal site (in bracket) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>D). This result confirms that the proximal sequence constitutes a higher-affinity site. Hydroxyl radical, a small chemical reagent that cleaves DNA in a base-independent manner, was next employed to pinpoint the nucleotides within this region that contact Ovol1. Footprinting with hydroxyl radical usually provides a finer mapping of protein&#x02013;DNA contacts due to the small size of the reagent and hence greater accessibility to DNA. The result of this experiment confirmed that Ovol1 makes contacts with the core hexamer, CCGTTA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>E), within the DNase I-footprinted region of the <italic>Ovol1</italic> promoter. In addition, a 5-bp sequence, GTTGT (or CAACA, opposite strand, underlined in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>E), which is slightly upstream of the hexamer, was also contacted by Ovol1. Together, these results identify the <italic>Ovol1</italic> promoter as a putative target of Ovol1 and provide new insights into how Ovol1 interacts with DNA.</p></sec><sec><title>Ovol1 represses the transcription of its own promoter in a DNA binding-dependent manner</title><p>We performed both <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic> experiments to examine whether Ovol1 regulates its own transcription. <italic>Ovol1</italic> knockout mice, in which exons 3 and 4 encoding the C-terminal zinc finger region are deleted, produce no detectable Ovol1 protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>) but still generate aberrant, high-molecular-weight transcripts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>). The first two exons of the gene as well as the upstream regulatory sequences (including the Ovol1-binding sites identified above) remain intact in these mutant animals, therefore allowing us to compare the total level of transcripts generated from the wild-type and mutant <italic>Ovol1</italic> alleles to assess auto-regulation. Northern blot analysis of skin RNAs isolated from wild-type and <italic>Ovol1</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> newborns and E16.5 embryos revealed significantly higher transcript levels in the mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>A and data not shown). This result suggests that transcription from the <italic>Ovol1</italic> locus is up-regulated when Ovol1 protein is absent. </p><p>We next performed reporter assays to directly assess the effect of Ovol1 protein on <italic>Ovol1</italic> promoter activity. In 293T cells, a dosage-dependent repression of the basal activity of the promoter by Ovol1 was observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>B). A similar repression was observed in NIH3T3 cells, although there the basal promoter activity was significantly lower (data not shown). The repression depended on the ability of Ovol1 to bind to DNA, as mutating the cysteines in the first three C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>2</sub> zinc fingers to alanines (ZnFC2A), which disrupts zinc finger structure and hence DNA binding, completely abolished repression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>B). A deletion of the CCGTTA sequence (MutP-D) in <italic>Ovol1</italic> promoter led to a reduction in the extent of Ovol1 repression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>C), indicating that this binding site is required to mediate maximal repression. Surprisingly, a deletion of the low-affinity distal site (MutP-L) also led to reduced repression. Moreover, a further reduction was observed when both sites were deleted (MutP-LD), suggesting an additive effect. Therefore, inside the cells both the high- and low-affinity sites are utilized for repression. Collectively, these studies, while indicative of a somewhat promiscuous nature of DNA sequence recognition of Ovol1 within cells, demonstrate that Ovol1 represses the basal transcription of <italic>Ovol1</italic> promoter by directly binding to it.</p></sec><sec><title>Ovol1 competes with c-Myb for DNA binding and represses c-Myb-activated transcription</title><p>Interestingly, the CCGTTA sequence to which Ovol1 binds is identical to the high-affinity binding site of c-Myb, a proto-oncoprotein and transcription activator (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30 B31 B32 B33">30&#x02013;33</xref>). This finding raises the possibility that Ovol1 may repress transcription by competing with c-Myb for DNA binding. This biochemical model is consistent with the growth inhibitory function of Ovol1 and a role for c-Myb in maintaining immature, proliferating cells of the hematopoeitic and possibly epithelial lineages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>). To test this model, we first examined whether recombinant Ovol1 binds to previously reported c-Myb cognate sequences. Oligonucleotide <italic>mim</italic>-A contains a CCGTTA motif and hence is a high-affinity c-Myb site, whereas <italic>mim</italic>-C represents a low-affinity c-Myb site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>). In EMSA assays, recombinant Ovol1 bound to <italic>mim</italic>-A but not <italic>mim</italic>-C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>A). We next tested whether Ovol1 competes with c-Myb for binding to <italic>mim</italic>-A. The addition of increasing concentrations of recombinant Ovol1 at a fixed concentration of c-Myb resulted in a gradual decrease in the amount of c-Myb&#x02013;DNA complexes and a concomitant increase in slow-migrating complexes, the mobility of which are consistent with that of Ovol1&#x02013;DNA complexes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>B, lanes 1&#x02013;5, and data not shown). The addition of anti-Ovol1 antibody led to a supershift of the Ovol1&#x02013;DNA complexes and reappearance of the c-Myb&#x02013;DNA complexes. We also found that c-Myb was able to bind to <italic>Ovol1D</italic>, an Ovol1 cognate sequence as shown above, and that recombinant Ovol1 competed away this binding (data not shown). Taken together, these results suggest that Ovol1 and c-Myb recognize similar DNA sequences, namely a CCGTTA motif, and that <italic>in vitro</italic>, Ovol1 is able to compete with c-Myb for binding to this motif. </p><p>To determine if competition for DNA binding also occurs within cells at the endogenous <italic>Ovol1</italic> promoter in its chromatin context, we performed chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays on cells transfected with either c-Myb expression construct alone or both c-Myb and Ovol1 expression constructs. NIH3T3 cells instead of 293T cells were used for these experiments because they do not express any detectable levels of endogenous Ovol1 protein (data not shown), therefore allowing us to determine the competition effect of ectopically expressed Ovol1. When only c-Myb was present, we detected c-Myb occupancy at the <italic>Ovol1</italic> promoter in a region that contains the Ovol1/c-Myb-binding sites identified <italic>in vitro</italic> (amplified by primer set 2, the position of which is indicated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>A), but not the control region that is 2&#x02009;kb upstream (amplified by primer set 1) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>C). When Ovol1 was introduced, however, Ovol1 but not c-Myb now occupied the <italic>Ovol1</italic> promoter. This result demonstrates that Ovol1, when present, displaces c-Myb from the Ovol1/c-Myb-binding sites in the endogenous <italic>Ovol1</italic> promoter. In contrast to wild-type Ovol1, the DNA-binding mutant, ZnFC2A, did not efficiently displace c-Myb, indicating that this ability to compete away c-Myb binding requires the DNA-binding ability of Ovol1.</p><p>The binding of c-Myb to <italic>Ovol1</italic> promoter raises the issue of whether c-Myb activates this promoter, since c-Myb is known to be a transcriptional activator (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>). In reporter assays, c-Myb indeed activated the <italic>Ovol1</italic> promoter in a dosage-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>D). Moreover, maximum activation was dependent on both the proximal CCGTTA-containing and the distal low-affinity Ovol1-binding sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>D and data not shown). Thus, within cells, c-Myb displays identical and similarly promiscuous DNA sequence preferences as Ovol1 (see Discussion), but shows opposite transcriptional regulatory activity. To elucidate the functional consequence of Ovol1 competition with c-Myb, we set out to determine if Ovol1 represses c-Myb-activated promoter activity. Transient transfection experiments were performed using a fixed concentration (50&#x02009;ng) of the c-Myb expression construct (where a &#x0223c;2-fold activation was seen) and increasing concentrations of the Ovol1 expression construct. A dosage-dependent repression was observed; at high concentrations Ovol1 repressed the promoter to a level that is well below the basal activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>E). When ZnFC2A was used instead of the wild type, a complete loss of repression was observed. Therefore, Ovol1 represses both basal and c-Myb-activated transcription of the <italic>Ovol1</italic> promoter, and at least one underlying mechanism of this repression is the displacement of c-Myb from its cognate sites, thereby antagonizing c-Myb activation.</p></sec><sec><title>Ovol1 represses basal and activated transcription of the <italic>Ovol1</italic> promoter by recruiting HDAC activity via its SNAG domain</title><p>Sequence analysis of the Ovol1 protein revealed the presence of an N-terminal 9-amino acid SNAG domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>A), which was first identified in proto-oncoprotein Gfi-1 and vertebrate Snail-related proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>). Since the SNAG domain has been functionally implicated in recruiting HDAC1 and &#x02013;2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>), we hypothesized that Ovol1 may also repress transcription actively, namely by recruiting HDAC co-repressors. A generally accepted criterion for an active repressor is that it can repress transcription independently of its own DNA recognition context (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>). Indeed, Ovol1 when fused to a Gal4 DNA-binding domain (Gal4DBD) was able to repress the Gal-tk promoter, where the minimum tk promoter is under the control of multimerized Gal4-binding sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>), whereas GalDBD alone had no effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>A and data not shown). Subsequent deletion studies mapped the repression domain to an N-terminal 45-amino-acid region encompassing the SNAG domain (data not shown). To determine if the SNAG domain is indeed required for auto-repression, we generated untagged Ovol1 mutant derivatives containing deletion of (&#x00394;15 and &#x00394;6SNAG), or a point mutation (P2ASNAG) in SNAG, and assayed their repressor activity on the <italic>Ovol1</italic> promoter. These mutations led to a complete loss of repression, while the wild-type protein of comparable expression levels repressed efficiently (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>B). These results indicate that SNAG is essential for Ovol1 repression of the basal activity of <italic>Ovol1</italic> promoter. It is unlikely that the SNAG in Ovol1 is involved in DNA binding or nuclear localization, as we have shown that the N-terminal half of Ovol1 is dispensable for DNA binding (see above), and that &#x00394;15 was properly localized to the cell nuclei (data not shown). </p><p>We next directly investigated whether Ovol1 repression of its own promoter is HDAC-dependent. As observed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>C, TSA treatment did not significantly affect the basal activity of <italic>Ovol1</italic> promoter but led to a significant reduction (&#x0223c;4-fold) in repression by Ovol1. Having established that Ovol1 repression requires HDAC activity, we next performed immmunoprecipitation (IP) assays to determine if Ovol1 interacts with HDACs. Indeed, Ovol1 protein was immunoprecipitated from extracts of 293T cells transfected with Flag-tagged HDAC1 by an anti-Flag antibody, but not by the appropriate IgG control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>D). Conversely, anti-Ovol1 antibody but not the relevant IgG control immunoprecipitated both exogenously and endogenously expressed HDAC1. In contrast, the anti-Flag antibody did not efficiently immunoprecipitate the &#x00394;15 protein that lacks the SNAG domain. Therefore, the SNAG domain, which mediates maximum Ovol1 repression, is also required for its optimum interaction with HDAC1. Interestingly, while we also observed interaction of Ovol1 with HDAC2 and &#x02212;3, no apparent interaction with the mSin3A co-repressor was detected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>E and data not shown). This finding is distinct from those made for Snail (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>), suggesting that while the SNAG domain in both Ovol1 and Snail proteins is involved in interaction with HDAC co-repressor complexes, the exact nature/composition of the complexes is protein specific. To further demonstrate a functional involvement of HDACs in Ovol1 repression, we co-transfected increasing amounts of an HDAC1 expression plasmid along with the Ovol1 expression construct. Indeed, an HDAC1 dosage-dependent enhancement of promoter repression was observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>F). This enhancement required the presence of Ovol1, suggesting that HDAC1 is recruited to the promoter via Ovol1.</p><p>We next performed ChIP assays to directly examine the recruitment of HDAC1 by Ovol1 to the promoter in its genomic context. Consistent with the results described above, both wild-type and &#x00394;15 Ovol1 proteins were recruited to the <italic>Ovol1</italic> promoter in a region that contains the Ovol1-binding sites, whereas no association was observed in the control region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>G). However, HDAC1 occupied the same region only when wild-type Ovol1 was present. These results indicate that HDAC1 is recruited to Ovol1 sites that are present in the genomic <italic>Ovol1</italic> locus, and that the SNAG domain of Ovol1 is responsible for HDAC1 recruitment. Collectively, our studies provide strong evidence that Ovol1 is able to actively repress the transcription of <italic>Ovol1</italic> promoter, likely by recruiting HDAC activity to its target sites.</p><p>To address the relative contribution of passive and active repression mechanisms in c-Myb-activated transcription, we compared the dosage effect of wild-type and &#x00394;15 Ovol1. Since &#x00394;15 is deficient in HDAC1 interaction but is able to bind DNA, we predicted that its repression of the <italic>Ovol1</italic> promoter is indicative of the extent of passive repression, and would therefore be less dramatic than the wild type. Indeed, at high concentrations, wild-type Ovol1 repressed c-Myb-activated transcription to an extent that is below the basal level, whereas &#x00394;15 was only able to bring the promoter activity back down to the basal level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>H). This result suggests that Ovol1 not only displaces c-Myb to release activation, but also recruits HDAC activity to bring about additional repression at the same time. Therefore, Ovol1 combines passive and active repression mechanisms to achieve maximum repression of the <italic>Ovol1</italic> promoter.</p></sec><sec><title>Ovol1 and c-Myb exert opposing effects on histone H3 acetylation at the <italic>Ovol1</italic> promoter</title><p>HDACs repress transcription by deacetylating histone tails at the target promoter, whereas c-Myb is known to activate transcription by acetylating histones at its target promoters via interaction with the histone acetyl transferase (HAT) p300 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>). We therefore hypothesized that the switch in promoter occupancy from c-Myb to Ovol1 leads to a HAT-HDAC switch, thereby resulting in a deacetylated chromatin to silence gene expression. To test this model, we examined if changes in Ovol1 and c-Myb occupancy affects histone H3 acetylation at the <italic>Ovol1</italic> promoter. Upon transfection with c-Myb, a slight but reproducible increase in H3 acetylation was detected in the region that contains Ovol1/c-Myb-binding sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>A and B), supporting the previous report that c-Myb facilitates H3 acetylation at its target promoter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>). In contrast, when Ovol1 alone was transfected, a reduction in H3 acetylation was seen, and the reduction depended on the presence of the first 15 amino acids of the protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>A). Based on this result and studies presented above, we surmise that the SNAG domain is a key in recruiting HDAC1, which in turn deacetylates histone H3 at the target chromatin. When Ovol1 and c-Myb were co-introduced, the level of acetylated H3&#x02009;at the promoter was now significantly lower than that with only c-Myb, and was comparable to that with only Ovol1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>A and B). Co-introduction of ZnFC2A with c-Myb however, failed to reduce the c-Myb-enhanced H3 acetylation, indicating that binding of Ovol1 to the promoter is required for the observed reduction in histone acetylation levels. These differences between various conditions were reproducible and statistically significant. In all experiments, no change in H3 acetylation of the control region was observed (data not shown). Collectively, our data suggest that in cells, Ovol1 not only displaces c-Myb, hence decreasing c-Myb-facilitated histone acetylation, but also recruits HDAC activity to decrease the basal level of histone acetylation at the promoter. </p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>Auto-regulation is a well-known mechanism to intricately regulate the concentration of developmentally important transcription factors, and known examples include Snail1 and Gfi-1B repressors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40 B41 B42 B43">40&#x02013;43</xref>). The idea of a negative auto-regulation of <italic>Ovol1</italic> is supported by our <italic>in vivo</italic> studies detecting increased levels of <italic>Ovol1</italic> transcripts in tissues where Ovol1 protein production is ablated, and by our <italic>in vitro</italic> studies that Ovol1 binds to and represses its own promoter. Our study, in light of previous reports on <italic>Drosophila ovo</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>), suggests that auto-regulation is an evolutionarily conserved aspect of <italic>Drosophila</italic> and mouse <italic>ovo</italic> genes.</p><p>To date, studies on <italic>ovo</italic> genes have focused on their biological function and genetic context. Our work is the first to probe into the biochemical mechanisms by which this family of zinc finger proteins regulates transcription. Our results demonstrate that Ovol1 represses basal transcription in a manner that depends on its N-terminal SNAG moiety. The SNAG domain is found in multiple transcriptional repressors, where both its sequence and position are conserved (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>). Our result that SNAG is important for Ovol1 repression is consistent with previous reports demonstrating a functional involvement of SNAG in other repressors including Gfi-1 and Snail (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>). The N-terminal location of the SNAG domain is likely important for its repressive function, as Ovol1 protein tagged at the N-terminus does not repress as well as the untagged protein (data not shown). Ovol1 is also capable of repressing activated transcription by competing with the c-Myb activator for binding to common DNA sites. Taken together, our data suggest a novel model where Ovol1 uses an active repression mechanism to repress basal transcription of its promoter, and uses both passive and active repression mechanisms in combination to exert maximum repression of c-Myb-activated transcription (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>). A functional outcome of the c-Myb-Ovol1 switch at the target promoter is the change from an acetylated, presumably open chromatin, to a deacetylated, presumably condensed chromatin, resulting in silencing of target gene expression. Although not proven, dual (active and passive) repression has been implicated for vertebrate members of the Snail family of zinc finger repressors, which are involved in important developmental processes such as mesoderm and neural crest formation [reviewed in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>)]. While a SNAG domain is found in all vertebrate but not the <italic>Drosophila</italic> members of the Snail protein family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>), a domain bearing resemblance to SNAG consensus is present at the N-termini of mouse Ovol2, human Ovol1 and Ovol2, as well as <italic>Drosophila</italic> Svb, an epidermis-specific Ovo protein isoform (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>). The significance of this domain in the biochemical activities of these other Ovo proteins remains to be addressed. The similarity between Ovol1 and Snail1 repressors in auto-regulation and mode of repression is intriguing. In fact, Ovol1 shares a 28% sequence identity (39% similarity) (including SNAG domain) with the mouse Snail1 protein. A negative feedback loop to self-limit expression and dual repression to ensure an efficient, activation-silencing switch might be necessary for developmentally important repressors to regulate cell fates at important crossroads such as proliferation and terminal differentiation. </p><p>In addition to HDAC1, Ovol1 also interacts with two other Class I HDACs, HDAC2 and -3, but not with co-repressor mSin3A. This differs from previous studies on Snail, where the SNAG domain interacts with HDAC1, -2 and mSin3A but not HDAC3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>). It has been suggested that the Snail protein might assemble both mSin3A-dependent and -independent co-repressor complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>). Our studies on Ovol1 provide yet another possibility for SNAG-mediated complex formation, and extend our understanding of the repertoire of HDAC-containing co-repressor complexes. This work now adds Ovol1 to the list of versatile transcriptional repressors that can repress transcription in multiple ways.</p><p>We have recently shown that Ovol1 represses c-Myc and Id2 transcription by binding to their promoters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>). c-Myc is a known target of c-Myb (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46 B47 B48">46&#x02013;48</xref>), and our DNA-binding studies have shown that c-Myb indeed binds to an Ovol1 site in the Id2 promoter (data not shown). Therefore, the passive and active repression mechanisms of Ovol1 discovered here may apply to Ovol1-mediated regulation of its other target genes. In addition to discovering the CCGTTA-containing high-affinity site, this article and our previous work also identified atypical Ovol1-responsive elements that show low-binding affinity <italic>in vitro</italic> but are utilized inside cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>). This extends the parallel with c-Myb, as it was previously reported that low-affinity c-Myb-binding sites are indeed functionally utilized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>). Alternative mechanisms such as assistance from auxiliary factors might exist to recruit the proteins to these sites <italic>in vivo</italic>. Systematic ChIP-on-chip analysis of Ovol1 binding <italic>in vivo</italic> might reveal additional atypical sites and shed light on the underlying mechanisms. The discovery of competition between Ovol1 and c-Myb in DNA binding and transcriptional regulation is particularly exciting in light of their apparently opposing biological functions. c-Myb positively regulates the proliferation of immature cells that are committed to differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>), while Ovol1 is expressed later in a differentiation pathway and is necessary for efficient proliferation arrest (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7 B8 B9">7&#x02013;9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>). Based on the data presented here, it is tempting to speculate that c-Myb and Ovol1 transcriptional regulation represent two consecutive steps in a relevant differentiation pathway, where the balance of the opposing effects of these two proteins coordinates proliferation with differentiation. Since c-Myb is expressed in proliferating epidermal cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>), a possible scenario in skin epidermis is that c-Myb activates genes such as c-Myc and Id2 to up-regulate the transient proliferation of progenitor cells that have committed to differentiate, but also turns on the expression of its own antagonist, Ovol1, to restrict proliferation to allow terminal differentiation to actually occur. This notion can now be tested using a keratinocyte differentiation as well as animal models. Since c-Myb knockout mice die during gestation prior to the onset of epidermal differentiation, a study of an epidermal involvement of c-Myb awaits the generation of a conditional allele.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS</title><p>We thank Kristin Brevik Andersson for c-MybR2R3 and pEQP2-CMV-c-Myb constructs and Edward Seto for Flag-tagged HDAC1, -2 and -3 constructs.
