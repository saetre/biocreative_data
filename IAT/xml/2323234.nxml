In general, periodic phenomena are prevalent in transcriptional regulation - for example, in circadian rhythms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>], Msn transcription factor regulation in yeast [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>] and the pulsatile response of NF-&#x003ba;B and p53 in tissue culture cells following stimulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. Oscillations seem to be a universal mode of regulation for morphogenetic cell movements and gene transcription that requires fine spatial and temporal coordination. Calcium waves are observed during convergent extension in <italic>Xenopus </italic>and are believed to coordinate cell movement [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. In the case of somitogenesis, where segmentation is periodic, Notch and Wnt signaling is coupled to periodic expression of the Notch components themselves [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. It is expected that the functions of molecular networks will become apparent only when put into the context of such multicellular organization in time and space. Biologically relevant readouts with a temporal and spatial resolution are thus the final layer needed to connect high-throughput genomics data obtained at the molecular and cellular level to higher organizational and functional levels.</p><p>A classic experimental paradigm in developmental biology begins with a mutant phenotype and then asks which aspects of development are altered. The goal is to relate structure to function, first at the molecular, then the cellular, and finally the whole-organism level. The current richness of information for a few model organisms is testimony to the success of this approach. With the explosion of genome sequences, it is becoming realistic to rapidly map out relations between genotype and molecular level phenotype using large-scale assays at the level of transcription and translation. Efforts to complement such bottom-up approaches by high-throughput screens based on observational phenotypes at the cellular level have recently been reported in yeast, nematode, and cells in tissue culture [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. These studies have largely concentrated on the analyses of cell growth, division, and morphology, either through a growth-curve analysis of batch cultures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>] or by the analysis of morphology at a single to the few cell level by microscopy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. However, a comparable approach for a multicellular system based on quantitative real-time dynamic data gathered throughout the entire life cycle remains largely undeveloped.</p><p>Here we report on a first attempt in this direction with <italic>Dictyostelium</italic>, where solitary growing cells cooperate upon starvation to form a relatively simple and highly differentiated fruiting body of spore and stalk cells. Pulsatile signaling of the extracellular attractant cAMP, in addition to directing chemotaxis, induces the cAMP signaling components themselves and plays a critical role in determining the size of the aggregation territory [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>] as well as coordinating later morphogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. We demonstrate that high-throughput profiling of multicellular dynamics detects functional association between developmental genes. We combine collection of movies that covers almost the entire developmental cycle with quantitative and qualitative phenotyping based on temporal data gathered from the movie collection, and parallel genotyping of the characterized clones.</p></sec><sec><title>Results and discussion</title><sec><title>Parallel cell culture and phenotyping</title><p>Cell culture was scaled up to systematically follow the growth and development of as many as a hundred <italic>Dictyostelium </italic>clonal populations at a time (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1a</xref>). We designed a robotic system (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1b</xref>; see Materials and methods) to capture both early and later events in the morphogenetic cycle. Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1c</xref> summarizes a typical experiment with our wild-type strain, AX4. Cell-cell signaling mediated by extracellular cAMP was visualized by detecting optical density fluctuations that reflect cell shape change in response to passing cAMP waves [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. By 3 hours after the cells begin to develop, a few fragments of weak optical-density waves have begun to emerge from the background (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1c</xref>, 3 hours; see also Additional data file 1 for a movie), a characteristic feature of self-organization in excitable systems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. During the next few hours, cells show little directed movement and the cell density is spatially uniform (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1c</xref>, 5 hours). The images were enhanced by subtracting consecutive frames (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1c</xref>, 3 hours and 5 hours; right panels compared to the left; Additional data file 2). Optical density waves quickly develop spiral cores, which become organizing centers for cell territories by 6.5 hours, when territories of different sizes with aggregating streams of cells are readily apparent (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1c</xref>, 6.5 hours; see Additional data file 1). By 15 hours these territories have become rounded masses of cells, the majority of which by 18 hours have reached the motile slug stage, each slug containing from a few thousand to around 10<sup>5 </sup>cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1c</xref>, 18 hours; Additional data file 3). By around 40 hours the slugs have migrated and culminated to form fruiting bodies (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1c</xref>, 40 hours).</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Automated image acquisition and phenotyping of clonal populations. <bold>(a) </bold>Over 2,000 insertional mutant clones were subjected to parallel culture and phenotyping using the flow chart shown here. <bold>(b) </bold>The gantry robotic system.

Images were captured every 40 sec from each well for 10.5 h after plating for a total of 800 frames. Later stages of morphogenesis were then followed for 28.5 h by bright-field illumination. During this period, images were captured at 127-sec intervals, also for a total of 800 frames from each well. The images in the first column were obtained from a 16.8 mm &#x000d7; 12.6 mm area by averaging five frames taken approximately 66 msec apart for noise reduction. Successive averaged frames were then subtracted to obtain the wave images in the second column (3 and 5 h). Bright-field optics were used for the second half of the imaging session to follow slug motion (11 h). After the run was over, the final culminant morphology was checked under a dissecting microscope (48 h). (<bold>d</bold>) The wavelet portrait. For the first 10.5 h, a time course of strength of the signal oscillating at the specified periodicity <italic>s </italic>was obtained from averaged wavelet transformations of pixel intensities as a function of time (see main text for details).

The wavelet power spectrum (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1d</xref>; <italic>z</italic>-axis in pseudocolor) represents the strength of the signal oscillating at the specified periodicity (<italic>s</italic>) (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1d</xref>; <italic>y</italic>-axis) as the system develops in time (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1d</xref>; <italic>x</italic>-axis). A typical analysis with wild-type cells is illustrated in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1d</xref>. At <italic>t </italic>= 150 minutes, long-period (15 min) features have begun to emerge. The wave period evolves slowly and smoothly to <italic>t </italic>= 275 minutes, levels off for 50 minutes, then abruptly switches off as cells migrate to form well defined territories. At approximately <italic>t </italic>= 400 minutes a second long-period feature emerges, corresponding to the cell streaming pattern seen in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1c</xref> at 6.5 hours. These results are in good agreement with observations on wild-type cells grown under conventional culture conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>], and provide us with a quantitative summary of the first 12 hours of development.</p></sec><sec><title>Phenotype clustering</title><p>We have sampled 1,800 insertional mutants, hereafter referred to as the 'unbiased set' from an ongoing large-scale mutagenesis project [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>], and 400 or so containing many previously isolated mutants (see Materials and methods). In addition to the quantitative features just described for the early developmental stages, qualitative features such as cell morphology during axenic growth, slug motion/morphology and fruiting body structure (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>) were obtained from the movies and observation of the samples by microscopy. From these features, a phenotype matrix <italic>p</italic><sub>ij </sub>was obtained (see Materials and methods).

Our first result is that 83% of the total number of mutant clones (1870 of 2257) cannot be distinguished from wild type (blue-green in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2a</xref>), possibly because the insertion is in an intergenic region, or the mutated gene exists redundantly, or it is nonessential for growth and development under the present conditions. The second noticeable feature of these data is the number of strains clustered at the bottom of Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2a</xref> (139 clones appearing with two or more yellow boxes) and sparsely distributed elsewhere. Many of these exhibited slow vegetative growth and the low cell-density effect associated with it despite multiple attempts to grow them. This phenotype may be largely due to a systematic bias carried over from the parent, as most of them are from the same transformant set. After removing these clones from the dataset, we estimate that 1 to 2% are defective in genes that, while permitting vegetative growth on bacteria, interfere with normal growth in axenic medium. For several mutants in this category, we were able to confirm the observed behavior independently by disrupting the gene by homologous recombination (data not shown). The third feature of this dataset is the remaining strains with developmental phenotypes, representing 4% of the clones in the unbiased mutant set (76 strains out of 1,799) and 32% in the previously characterized mutant set.</p><fig position="float" id="F2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p>Phenotypic clustering based on the timing of mutant behavior. <bold>(a) </bold>2,257 strains were assigned phenotype vectors according to the stage-specific mutant defect.

This cluster includes a group of 'developmentally null' mutants in which genes such as <italic>mkpA</italic>, <italic>piaA</italic>, <italic>yakA </italic>and <italic>dagA </italic>are disrupted. Other groups include <italic>DG1105</italic>, <italic>DG1037</italic>, <italic>DG1122 </italic>from an earlier screen (W. Loomis, unpublished work), as well as another group that includes the protein kinase A pathway genes <italic>rdeA </italic>and <italic>regA </italic>(described in detail below). These mutants not only show early developmental defects, they also continue to exhibit aberrant behavior until mound formation, and are either stalled or show further aberrant behavior during slug migration and culmination. The above mutant clusters are followed by a cluster consisted of mutants with similarly severe phenotype plus growth-stage defects (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2c</xref>).</p><p>Another major mutant cluster contains clones showing defective behavior at the slug and culmination stage, but wild-type behavior during aggregation (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2d</xref>). Particularly noticeable are five mutants disrupted in <italic>tagB/C</italic>, mutations in <italic>tipA</italic>, <italic>tipB</italic>, <italic>tipC</italic>, and <italic>tipD</italic>, and multiple occurrence of mutants with insertions in the <italic>yelA </italic>gene and the <italic>dhkA </italic>gene. At the bottom of Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2d</xref> there are strains that show aberrant behavior in the early stage of development, but nevertheless form mounds, then again exhibit deficient slug and fruiting-body structure. A large number of mutants defective in early signaling are also defective later in development (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2d</xref>) even though they appear to stream normally to aggregation centers. This suggests either that the gene products are used at two or more different times during development - for example, cAMP metabolism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>] - or that wave phenotype dictates later aspects of morphogenesis in a way we do not yet fully understand. Finally, some strains exhibited aberrant behavior during the early signaling to aggregation stages, but no striking phenotypes during later stages (see Additional data file 4). These strains may be contrasted with those exhibiting defects only at the slug stage (see Additional data file 4) or the culmination stage (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2e</xref>), such as those disrupted in the cellulose synthase gene <italic>dcsA </italic>(Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2e</xref>).</p><p>We noticed that independent clones disrupted in the same gene co-cluster, providing strong validation of our profiling approach. In general, the developmental stages observed for most of the published mutants examined here agree with the literature. Mutants previously characterized as aggregation minus fail to aggregate, and stalk-defective mutants fail to make stalks. A caveat of the present coarse-grained representation is that similarities in the more detailed phenotypes are not reflected in clustering. We should note that detailed phenotypes, such as the break up of aggregation territories seen in chemotaxis-defective mutants of <italic>erkA </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>], <italic>mekA </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>] and <italic>phdA</italic>, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>] and long stalks in <italic>dhkA </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>] also agree well with known mutant phenotypes.</p><p>However, not all of the phenotypes were consistent with the literature. This includes V31742 from the new unbiased mutant set carrying an insertion in <italic>dstA</italic>, a gene encoding the STATa transcription factor, which under our assay conditions was defective only from the slug stage on, whereas a delay earlier in development has been reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. There were also some that exhibited phenotypes undocumented in the literature. For the two most conspicuous clones (disrupted in <italic>splA </italic>and <italic>lvsB</italic>), we showed that the phenotype could not be recapitulated by an independent knockout. In these cases, a secondary mutation introduced by the REMI vector is the likely cause of the observed defects. While it is possible that some of the differences between independent isolates are due to subtle differences in cell density and the growth condition at the outset of each experiment, we note that phenotyping was repeated two or more times, and thus it is likely that the clustering reflects either differences traceable back to mutant gene structure or the highly plastic nature of the mutant phenotype (for example, <italic>tipC</italic>, <italic>modA</italic>, <italic>yelA</italic>).</p></sec><sec><title>Early wave features</title><p>Several wavelet parameters serve to characterize the wild-type phenotype of early cAMP signaling. The peak of the averaged wavelet power spectrum was traced, and the time of the cessation of signaling <italic>t</italic><sub>end </sub>was determined. The resulting one-dimensional data can be clustered, yielding a group of samples that failed to exhibit normal oscillation patterns (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3a</xref>, and see the next section). We have done this by first placing sample runs into four groups using K-mean clustering of the wavelet transform (see Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3a</xref>), then removing possible pleiotropic effects during the growth phase by cross-verification with the phenotype cluster. A similar analysis using hierarchical clustering yields a continuous profile without apparent structure or organization. The first two clusters in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3a</xref> contain samples with slight differences in the onset that is within that observed in the wild type. The third cluster in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3a</xref>, with delayed wave-onset time, contains mostly low-density samples, whereas samples in the last cluster failed to establish waves. There is a faint secondary peak above the first peak in the wavelet portrait that signifies a deviation from the symmetric sinusoidal form of oscillation. Although these secondary peaks may be important to characterize mutants with altered forms of oscillation, such as <italic>stmF </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>], we have confined our analysis here to the main frequency.</p><fig position="float" id="F3"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p>Early cell-cell signaling. <bold>(a) </bold>The wavelet transform was further reduced to a one-dimensional representation by tracing the peak of the averaged wavelet power spectrum as a function of time <italic>t</italic>. The traced data were then subjected to K-mean clustering. The bottom cluster comes from experimental runs where the normal 5-min optical-density oscillations were not detected. Other clusters are wild type with respect to signaling periodicity but are grouped according to the difference in wave onset.

At <italic>t </italic>= <italic>t</italic><sub>end</sub>, the main frequency 1/<italic>s </italic>= 1/<italic>s</italic>* and the peak wavelet power spectrum was extracted. Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3b</xref> records the distribution of maximum frequency 1/<italic>s</italic>* of the optical density oscillations. The maximum frequency is narrowly distributed, with an average of 0.24/min (standard deviation (SD) &#x000b1; 0.03). This is equivalent to cells reaching approximately a 4.2-min period oscillation, in agreement with previous studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. Compared with the tight distribution of signal frequencies, the wavelet power spectrum follows a log-normal distribution, with mean 0.197 (SD &#x000b1; 0.132) (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3c</xref>). Cessation of oscillations <italic>t</italic><sub>end </sub>is well fitted by a Gaussian distribution (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3e</xref>). A tight frequency distribution and a broad (log-normal) amplitude distribution have also been reported recently in the p53 system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>] and may be a widespread feature of nonlinear oscillations in cells.</p><p>The number of spiral wave cores, which is a good measure of the number of cell territories that will later form, also follows a Gaussian distribution (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3d</xref>). This distribution is most plausibly explained by the fact that core formation is intrinsically stochastic in nature [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. It is also likely that the observed distribution depends on sample to sample variability in cell density which may correlate with the oscillation frequency (see below), although the number of aggregation centers is known to be relatively insensitive to cell density above 400 cells/mm<sup>2 </sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>], and our experiments were carried out at around 7,000 cells/mm<sup>2</sup>. To exclude such complications, the data in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3b-i</xref> were obtained from selected samples exhibiting spiral wave propagation where the growing cells had reached confluence and showed no growth defects (<italic>N </italic>= 1,639; top three clusters in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3a</xref>). We noticed that the number of aggregates exceeds the number of spiral cores because streams tend to break up just before aggregation completes. The extent of late stream break up was highly variable from sample to sample, even for the same strain, and therefore this phenotype was not considered as a robust trait for further annotation.</p><p>Spiral wave formation is a complex phenomenon that depends on the developmental trajectories of the cells; that is, how the mode of signaling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>], sensitivity to the signal [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>] and kinetics of signaling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>] develop in time. We investigated this aspect by displaying the related data as scatter plots (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3f-i</xref>). We note the following. First, when the system develops quickly, there is a weak tendency for the oscillation frequency to be smaller (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3f</xref>). Second, there appears to be a weak positive correlation between the amplitude and <italic>t</italic><sub>end </sub>(Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3g</xref>) and a negative correlation between the amplitude and the frequency at <italic>t</italic><sub>end </sub>(Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3h</xref>). Heterogeneity in the signaling response has been reported at the single cell level [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]. Because our analysis is based on data from groups of cells, wavelet amplitude mainly reflects the coherence among the cells of the periodic cytoskeletal rearrangement upon cAMP stimulation. The data, therefore, suggest that the cells are participating in periodic signaling more heterogeneously when the system takes a shorter time to reach the streaming stage, and/or when it reaches a high-frequency oscillation state. We see that in high-frequency samples, more spiral cores are observed (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3i</xref>). From the slope, there is roughly a fivefold increase in maximal number of spiral cores as the frequency increases from 0.17/min to 0.25/min. This is difficult to explain simply by scaling of the territory pattern with wavelength alone, because one can only expect an increase of approximately 1.5-fold. Rather, the data suggest a causal relationship between the formation of spiral cores and heterogeneity in cell excitability.</p></sec><sec><title>Pulsing and slow-oscillator mutants</title><p>As described above, early-stage mutants that failed to exhibit the typical developmental time course in optical-density oscillations can be systematically picked up by the clustering of the wavelet transform (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3a</xref>, the bottom cluster). The mutants detected in this way display a range of severity in signaling defects. For example, V10233 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4a</xref>) is disrupted in the <italic>piaA </italic>gene, which encodes a TOR (target of rapamycin) complex protein that is required for the cAMP pulse-induced activation of adenylyl cyclase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>]. Neither optical-density waves nor signs of aggregation are visible, as expected from the known null phenotype of <italic>piaA </italic>mutants. V10285 (<italic>DG1105</italic>; dictyBase ID: DDB0220018) shows local pulsatile waves, and development at this stage is prolonged (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4b</xref>). V10199 (<italic>DG1037</italic>; dictyBase ID: DDB0191301) shows slow oscillations of extended duration (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4c</xref>), and development appears to be arrested during early aggregation. Owing to the long period of the optical-density oscillations, the wavelength of the spirals is extended, and therefore only a few spiral wave territories appear. Finally, V10682 is able to develop after growth and starvation on bacterial plates, but on non-nutrient agar, development is delayed from early aggregation on (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4d</xref>). Optical-density wave onset is late, and wave periodicity remains long and never reaches the characteristic 5-min oscillation. The gene disrupted in this strain (dictyBase ID: DDB0218077) encodes a protein homologous to the conserved <italic>clc6/7 </italic>type chloride channel family protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>].</p><fig position="float" id="F4"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><p>Representative samples with defects in early development.

In these mutants, waves propagate for very short distances before annihilating when they crash into each other.

Slug migration velocity is typically of the order of several hundred micrometers per minute; therefore its characterization is difficult without time-lapse imaging.</p><p>Our dynamical profiling approach reveals mutants with coordination defects. A mutant V10633 of a putative GATA activator (dictyBase ID: DDB0220467) forms chubby slugs that are mostly developmentally arrested at this stage (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6b</xref>, right panel). Migration is almost absent, as is evident from the slug trajectories (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6b</xref> right panel). Some slugs do culminate to form fruiting bodies with small spore heads. The video records allow one to discriminate mutants with such behavior from those that proceed to the slug stage but show deficient migration.

The time-lapse movies contain a wealth of information that reflects the ability of individual cells to attach to the substratum, signal to one another, perform directional movement towards an attractant, form a multicellular body, migrate as a whole, and differentiate to construct the final culminant. In this study, we have shown how such a readout can be obtained for a simple multicellular organism, annotated, and stored in a form of streaming video that can easily be linked to a genome database [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>].</p><p>The current study achieved a comparative assay of mutant phenotype under uniform environmental conditions.

The number of major mutant cluster categories was on the order of the number of developmental stages, <italic>N</italic><sub>i</sub>. Assuming random insertion in the mutagenesis, the expected number of developmental genes in each cluster (<italic>N</italic><sub>g</sub>) is approximately <italic>N</italic><sub>g </sub>= (<italic>G </italic>&#x000d7; <italic>P</italic>)/(<italic>N </italic>&#x000d7; <italic>r</italic>) where <italic>G </italic>is the number of genes in the genome, <italic>P </italic>is the mutant frequency and <italic>r </italic>is the frequency of the coding regions in the genome.

Clones were of two major types. To test the generality of our approach, we analyzed a collection of mutants generated by restriction-enzyme-mediated insertional (REMI) mutagenesis, many of which have been published. These strains came from the Loomis and Shaulsky laboratories. They are numbered V00262 to V10300. To test our methods to discover new mutants with developmental phenotypes by unbiased random REMI mutagenesis, we analyzed a subset of an extensive collection developed at Baylor. This is the V10301-V11139 and V30000-V31999 series. Whenever the phenotype deviated from wild type, the time-lapse experiment was repeated, with the result that 882 clones were examined more than once. Of these, 357 were repeated two or more times. REMI mutagenesis provides a convenient and relatively unbiased way to conduct genome-wide forward genetic screens, allowing the investigator to rapidly identify the insertion site by plasmid rescue and inverse PCR.

These procedures were automated and integrated with image acquisition. Feature extraction from the wavelet analysis was performed using a script written in Perl that traces the peak of the wavelet power spectrum as a function of time. A running average with a time interval of 6.7 min was used to remove short time-scale fluctuations. The resulting trace data were clustered using a K-means algorithm with the Euclidean distance as a similarity metric.</p><p>For each developmental stage - growth, early wave, aggregation, mound, slug and fruiting body - deviation from reproducibly robust wild-type behavior at each stage was noted (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>). This information was ranked into four different categories <italic>p</italic><sub><italic>ij </italic></sub>= -1, -1/2, 0 or 1, where <italic>i </italic>&#x02208; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>] stands for ordered developmental stage (for example, <italic>i </italic>= 1 is the growth stage) and <italic>j </italic>represents the sample number. Category <italic>p</italic><sub><italic>ij </italic></sub>= 1 is thus the value for a given wild-type phenotype, and <italic>p</italic><sub><italic>ij </italic></sub>&#x0003c; 1 signifies the severity of the mutant phenotype. <italic>p</italic><sub><italic>ij </italic></sub>= -1 corresponds to a null phenotype, meaning that a developmental stage-specific behavior and morphology was completely absent, either because of developmental arrest at that particular stage, or at a preceding stage. <italic>p</italic><sub><italic>ij </italic></sub>= -1/2 is assigned when a clear deviation from wild-type behavior could be identified (for example, slow oscillations, short stalk, and so on). A phenotypic score of <italic>p</italic><sub><italic>ij </italic></sub>= 0 was assigned when the phenotype could not be distinguished from phenotypic fluctuations exhibited from experiment to experiment with wild-type cells. Many clones (V10546-V10646, V10676-V10696, V30001-V30896, V31301-V31596) systematically showed late slug behavior characterized by loss of cells from the slug posterior and early culmination. These were assigned <italic>p</italic><sub><italic>ij </italic></sub>= 0 and treated as wild type for clustering purpose. Multiple sample runs were averaged by taking the maximum</p><p><disp-formula><mml:math xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" id="M2" name="gb-2007-8-7-r144-i2" overflow="scroll"><mml:semantics><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>q</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>s</mml:mi><mml:mi>j</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:munderover><mml:mrow><mml:mi>max</mml:mi><mml:mo>&#x02061;</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>i</mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mn>1</mml:mn></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>N</mml:mi><mml:mi>s</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:munderover><mml:msub><mml:mi>p</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>i</mml:mi><mml:mi>j</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:semantics></mml:math></disp-formula></p><p>for strain <italic>s </italic>with <italic>N</italic><sub><italic>s </italic></sub>repeated runs. Although this filtering approach loses some information relative to simple mean averaging, it supplies a more rigorous justification for the claim that a given strain is defective in some aspect of development. Hierarchical clustering was performed by Cluster 3.0 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B71">71</xref>] using Pearson correlation as a similarity metric. The mean of all pairwise distances were used during clustering. The resulting trees were visualized by Java TreeView [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B72">72</xref>].</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Additional data files</title><p>Additional data is available online with this paper.
