We developed a fluorescence resonance energy transfer assay to probe how Hfq modulates the interaction between a sRNA, DsrA, and its regulatory target mRNA, <italic>rpoS</italic>. The relevant RNA fragments were labelled so that changes in intra- and intermolecular RNA structures can be monitored in real time. Our data show that Hfq promotes the strand exchange reaction in which the internal structure of <italic>rpoS</italic> is replaced by pairing with DsrA such that the Shine-Dalgarno sequence of the mRNA becomes exposed. Hfq appears to carry out strand exchange by inducing rapid association of DsrA and a premelted <italic>rpoS</italic> and by aiding in the slow disruption of the <italic>rpoS</italic> secondary structure. Unexpectedly, Hfq also disrupts a preformed complex between <italic>rpoS</italic> and DsrA. While it may not be a frequent event <italic>in vivo</italic>, this melting activity may have implications in the reversal of sRNA-based regulation. Overall, our data suggests that Hfq not only promotes strand exchange by binding rapidly to both DsrA and <italic>rpoS</italic> but also possesses RNA chaperoning properties that facilitates dynamic RNA&#x02013;RNA interactions.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>RNA molecules serve as important regulatory factors in a variety of cellular processes. Examples include small interfering and micro RNA in eukaryotes and non-coding small RNA (sRNA) and riboswitches in prokaryotes. Protein&#x02013;RNA interactions form the basis of RNA-based regulation of gene expression, but our understanding of its details at the molecular level is still poor. Fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) is a powerful tool to study intermolecular interactions and intramolecular conformational changes, and therefore it serves as a desirable technique to investigate the regulatory mechanisms involving RNA&#x02013;protein interactions. Here, we have developed FRET assays to probe how <italic>E. coli</italic> Hfq protein modulates the interaction between a sRNA and its target mRNA.</p><p>Hfq was originally discovered in <italic>E. coli</italic> as a host factor for Q-&#x003b2;-replicase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>), but analysis of <italic>hfq</italic> mutations suggested its involvement in many other metabolic pathways. Indeed, Hfq is now known to be a pleiotropic regulator that modulates the stability as well as translational activity of several mRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2 B3 B4">2&#x02013;4</xref>). The role of Hfq in translational regulation has been the focus of much attention lately since many sRNAs have been identified to require Hfq for their activity. For example, Hfq is involved in the post-transcriptional regulation of the <italic>rpoS</italic> gene (encoding the &#x003c3;<sup>s</sup> RNA polymerase subunit involved in bacterial stress response) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>). Hfq modulates <italic>rpoS</italic> expression by altering the binding of sRNAs such as DsrA, OxyS and RprA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6 B7 B8">6&#x02013;8</xref>). Other examples of protein pathways regulated by Hfq-mediated coupling of a regulatory sRNA to a target mRNA include OxyS&#x02009;&#x02026;&#x02009;<italic>fhlA</italic>, and Spot42&#x02009;&#x02026;&#x02009;<italic>galK</italic>, where mRNA targets are italicized (reviewed in ref. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>)). Although it is likely that only a fraction of sRNA molecules that require Hfq as an additional factor have been identified, it is already clear that many of these sRNAs act by base-pairing with mRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10 B11 B12">10&#x02013;12</xref>).</p><p>Hfq binds both sRNA and its corresponding mRNA simultaneously, forming a ternary complex and it was suggested that the enhanced local concentration of the RNA leads to final annealing of the two RNA which then exposes the mRNA coding sequence for translation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>). It has also been proposed that Hfq acts by changing the RNA structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>). Furthermore, Hfq was shown to rescue a group I intron splicing intermediate trapped in a misfolded form <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>) and hence qualifies as a RNA chaperone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>). It is likely that RNA chaperone activities of Hfq are also involved in translational regulation by sRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>).</p><p>Our current molecular understanding of Hfq activity largely stems from recent findings that it is a Sm-like protein. The most thoroughly characterized Sm proteins are those that form the cores of eukaryotic spliceosomal ribonucleoproteins implicated in pre-mRNA splicing. The Sm domain is highly conserved across many species and its wide phylogenetic distribution underlines its likely role in early evolution of RNA metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20 B21 B22">20&#x02013;22</xref>). In the case of Hfq, the relationship between eubacterial protein and Sm topology was first suggested by weak sequence conservation and subsequently confirmed by crystallographic structures of <italic>S. aureus</italic>, <italic>E. coli</italic> and <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> Hfq proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23 B24 B25 B26">23&#x02013;26</xref>). Eukaryotic and archaeal Sm proteins form closed rings composed of seven monomers (identical or different) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27 B28 B29">27&#x02013;29</xref>), whereas Hfq forms homo-hexameric rings. The toroidal-shaped Hfq ring is &#x0223c;70&#x02009;&#x000c5; in diameter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>), with a central cationic pore that forms the RNA-binding site. The structure of <italic>S. aureus</italic> Hfq-AU<sub>5</sub>G revealed RNA bound to one side of Hfq in a circular manner with each nucleotide stacking on the side chain of an aromatic residue (Tyr or Phe 42 for <italic>S. aureus</italic> and <italic>E. coli</italic> Hfq, respectively) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>). Furthermore, recent work has also provided compelling evidence that Hfq has multiple RNA binding sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>).</p><p>In this study, we have focused on DsrA&#x02009;&#x02026;&#x02009;Hfq&#x02009;&#x02026;&#x02009;<italic>rpoS</italic> interactions to examine the chaperoning role of Hfq in promoting intermolecular base-pairing. It is generally accepted that, in the absence of stress conditions, the translation of <italic>rpoS</italic> mRNA is repressed by a stem region upstream of the AUG start codon that sequesters the Shine-Dalgarno sequence. The current model proposes that stress results in stimulation of base pairing between <italic>rpoS</italic> and DsrA, at least in part by increasing the synthesis of DsrA. DsrA&#x02009;&#x02026;&#x02009;<italic>rpoS</italic> pairing allows disruption of the stem in <italic>rpoS</italic> and makes its ribosome binding site accessible (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>a). Nuclease footprinting experiments indicated that Hfq recognizes several sites in <italic>rpoS</italic> mRNA without changing its secondary structure in the region that inhibits translation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>) and that Hfq does not alter DsrA secondary structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>). In addition, results of native gel electromobility shift assays (EMSA) indicated that Hfq accelerates DsrA&#x02009;&#x02026;&#x02009;<italic>rpoS</italic> annealing by a factor of two (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>). Finally, it was proposed that binding of Hfq to DsrA stimulates annealing of <italic>rpoS</italic> to DsrA, followed by Hfq release from the sRNA&#x02009;&#x02026;&#x02009;<italic>mRNA</italic> complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>). In these <italic>in vitro</italic> assays, however, it was not clear how the RNA chaperone activities of Hfq are related to the enhanced DsrA&#x02009;&#x02026;&#x02009;<italic>rpoS</italic> interaction. </p><p>Here, we have developed real-time FRET assays to monitor the influence of Hfq on DsrA&#x02009;&#x02026;&#x02009;<italic>rpoS</italic> annealing. Our studies show that Hfq not only binds rapidly to both DsrA and pre-melted <italic>rpoS</italic> sequence but also acts as a RNA chaperone which modulates the RNA secondary structures in a sequence-specific manner. A model is proposed for how Hfq helps in annealing DsrA and <italic>rpoS</italic>.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>METHODS</title><p>Unless otherwise specified, all enzymes and chemicals were either from Sigma or Merck-Biochemicals.</p><sec><title>RNA sequences</title><p>We used the following RNA sequences for FRET measurements (5&#x02032;&#x02192;3&#x02032;): Cy5-DsrA, Cy5-AACACAUCAGAUUUCCUGGUGUAACGAAUUUUUUAAG; Cy3-<italic>rpoS</italic>I, biotin-AUUUUGAAAUUCGUUACAAGGGGAAAUCCGUAAACCC-Cy3; Cy5.5-<italic>rpoS</italic>II, Cy5.5-CAAGGGAUCACGGGUAGGAGCCACCUUAUGAGUCAGAAU.

The DsrA fragment was labelled with Cy5 (acceptor I) and a <italic>rpoS</italic> fragment, containing sequences upstream of the ribosome-binding site which is partially complementary to DsrA, was labelled with Cy3 (donor); they are referred to as Cy5-DsrA and Cy3-<italic>rpoS</italic>I, respectively. The third fragment containing the Shine&#x02013;Dalgarno sequence and the start codon of <italic>rpoS</italic> harbours a Cy5.5 label (acceptor II) and is named Cy5.5-<italic>rpoS</italic>II. Annealing of Cy3-<italic>rpoS</italic>I and Cy5.5-<italic>rpoS</italic>II mimics the stem of the secondary structure that masks the Shine-Dalgarno sequence of <italic>rpoS.</italic> All three RNA fragments were labelled at their 5&#x02032; or 3&#x02032; extremities so that annealing of Cy5-DsrA to Cy3-<italic>rpoS</italic>I and Cy5.5-<italic>rpoS</italic>II to Cy3-<italic>rpoS</italic>I results in high FRET (see Methods and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Hfq stimulates the annealing of <italic>rpoS</italic> and DsrA</title><p>To test whether Hfq promotes DsrA&#x02009;&#x02026;&#x02009;<italic>rpoS</italic> annealing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>a), we prepared 25&#x02009;nM of Cy3-<italic>rpoS</italic>I and 50&#x02009;nM of Cy5-DsrA in T50 buffer at 15&#x000b0;C. In the absence of Hfq, the emission spectrum showed negligible Cy5 signal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>b, black line), which did not change significantly for 5&#x02009;min (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>c), indicating that spontaneous annealing is slow under these conditions. We did observe significant spontaneous annealing at higher temperatures and higher RNA concentrations (Supplementary Figure S1). Addition of Hfq (28&#x02009;nM in hexamer) at <italic>t</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;9.5&#x02009;min caused an abrupt increase in the Cy5 signal and a corresponding decrease in the Cy3 signal, indicating that Hfq facilitates rapid association of Cy5-DsrA and Cy3-<italic>rpoS</italic>I (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>c). This large increase in FRET, which occurred in less than 20&#x02009;s, was followed by a more gradual increase in FRET (lifetime of &#x0223c;9&#x02009;min). The emission spectrum obtained 25&#x02009;min after Hfq addition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>b, blue line) also shows a clear increase in the Cy5 signal and a decrease in the Cy3 signal. This result was confirmed by electromobility shift assay (EMSA) which showed that 15% of <italic>rpoS</italic>I is in the annealed form after the first 5&#x02009;min with the reaction proceeding further with a lifetime of &#x0003e;10&#x02009;min, similar to the slow phase in the FRET data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>d and e). The Cy5-DsrA lane shows an additional larger molecular-weight species that we attribute to the DsrA dimer as reported previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>). Based on these data, we interpret the rapid FRET increase as the ternary complex formation via simultaneous binding of Hfq to <italic>rpoS</italic>I and DsrA and assign the subsequent slow FRET increase to the eventual annealing of the two RNA molecules. A similar ternary complex has been reported previously with the annealing process occurring over several minutes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>). </p></sec><sec><title>Hfq melts the <italic>rpoS</italic>I<italic>+</italic>DsrA duplex</title><p>Next, we examined if Hfq can promote the reverse reaction, i.e. melting of the <italic>rpoS</italic>I-DsrA duplex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>a). We pre-annealed Cy3-<italic>rpoS</italic>I and Cy5-DsrA (See Methods for details), termed here as <italic>rpoS</italic>I+DsrA. Addition of 28&#x02009;nM&#x02009;Hfq to 25&#x02009;nM <italic>rpoS</italic>I+DsrA (in T50; 15&#x000b0;C) has two clear effects on the fluorescence signals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>b). First, we observed an abrupt increase in both Cy3 and Cy5 signals upon the addition of Hfq. The increase in both fluorescence signals, typically 20&#x02013;30% (Supplementary Figure S2a), reflects an interaction of the protein with the cyanine dyes which blocks a non-radiative decay pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>). We cannot distinguish whether this effect is due to Hfq binding to the individual strands or to the annealed <italic>rpoS</italic>I+DsrA since the EMSA experiments suggest that there is a substantial fraction of RNA in the single-stranded form even after thermal annealing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>e). Second, the abrupt increase of fluorescence is followed by a gradual decrease in the Cy5 signal and an accompanying increase in the Cy3 signal, which indicates that Hfq melts <italic>rpoS</italic>I+DsrA over a time scale of minutes. The lifetime of FRET signal change decreased with increasing Hfq concentration and was &#x0223c;4&#x02009;min at saturation (560&#x02009;nM&#x02009;Hfq), (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>c). The melting activity of Hfq was enhanced with increase in temperature with the lifetime of 1.7&#x02009;min at 37&#x000b0;C for 56&#x02009;nM&#x02009;Hfq (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>d). Spontaneous melting of the <italic>rpoS</italic>I+DsrA duplex in the absence of Hfq was not observed at our standard temperature of 15&#x000b0;C but was observed at 37&#x000b0;C and was about 4-fold slower than the Hfq-induced melting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>d). This disruption of <italic>rpoS</italic>I+DsrA duplex by Hfq over a time scale of minutes was also confirmed by EMSA performed under the same conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>e and f). In contrast, we found that the melting of DsrA loop I domain by Hfq to be extremely slow even under saturating conditions (up to 2&#x02009;&#x003bc;M&#x02009;Hfq; K<sub>d</sub>&#x02009;=&#x02009;320&#x02009;nM) with lifetimes &#x0003e;30&#x02009;min (data not shown), suggesting that melting of <italic>rpoS</italic>I+DsrA by Hfq is a specific activity of the protein rather than a result of non-specific binding of the protein to RNA duplexes. </p></sec><sec><title>Hfq melts the stem structure of <italic>rpoS</italic> mRNA</title><p>We examined if Hfq has the ability to disrupt the <italic>rpoS</italic> stem structure which would enhance the eventual annealing with DsrA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>a). For this measurement, we annealed Cy3-<italic>rpoS</italic>I and Cy5.5-<italic>rpoS</italic>II as described in Methods. The annealed RNA complex, named <italic>rpoS</italic>I+II, mimics the secondary structure of <italic>rpoS.</italic> Before adding Hfq, the emission spectrum shows significant Cy5.5 signal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>b, black line) due to intact <italic>rpoS</italic>I+II (25&#x02009;nM in T50 at 15&#x000b0;C). Cy3 and Cy5.5 signals did not change significantly for 5&#x02009;min (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>c) indicating that <italic>rpoS</italic>I+II is stable under these conditions. However, when 28&#x02009;nM&#x02009;Hfq was added, the Cy5.5 signal gradually decreased with a concomitant Cy3 signal increase over a time scale of minutes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>c). The emission spectrum obtained 25&#x02009;min after Hfq addition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>b, blue line) also shows a clear decrease in FRET. These results demonstrate that Hfq can induce melting of the <italic>rpoS</italic> stem, independent of DsrA. The average melting time obtained by fitting the FRET decrease to an exponential decay decreases with Hfq concentration and begins to saturate at about 4&#x02009;min at concentrations above 300&#x02009;nM Hfq (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>d). This saturation is consistent with the formation of a complex between Hfq and <italic>rpoS</italic> with a <italic>K</italic><sub>d</sub> around 150&#x02009;nM as shown by previous affinity measurements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>) and our anisotropy measurements (Supplementary Figure S2b). Therefore, binding of Hfq to <italic>rpoS</italic> is slow, taking many minutes, under our standard conditions (28&#x02009;nM Hfq hexamer) and hence the slower melting observed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>c. </p></sec><sec><title>Hfq does not anneal the <italic>rpoS</italic> stem</title><p>In contrast to Hfq's ability to promote <italic>rpo</italic>SI&#x02026;DsrA annealing, we did not observe any increase in FRET when Cy3-<italic>rpoS</italic>I and Cy5.5-<italic>rpoS</italic>II were incubated in the presence of Hfq under the same condition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>e and f), despite the fact that Hfq is able to bind both <italic>rpoS</italic>I and <italic>rpoS</italic>II as observed by EMSA and anisotropy measurements (Supplementary Figure S2c and b). For this measurement, we incubated 25&#x02009;nM Cy3-<italic>rpoS</italic> and 62.5&#x02009;nM Cy5.5-<italic>rpoS</italic>II at 15&#x000b0;C for 25&#x02009;min without Hfq (black curve) and with 28&#x02009;nM of Hfq (blue curve). Therefore, the annealing activity of Hfq is specific to DsrA and <italic>rpoS</italic>I.</p></sec><sec><title>Strand exchange reaction</title><p>We then probed the effect of Hfq on the interaction between DsrA and <italic>rpoS</italic> (<italic>rpoS</italic>I+II) as shown schematically in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>a. First, we mixed 25&#x02009;nM <italic>rpoS</italic>I+II duplex and 65&#x02009;nM Cy5-DsrA in T50 buffer at 15&#x000b0;C to investigate whether Cy5-DsrA can anneal by itself to Cy3-<italic>rpoS</italic>I and release Cy5.5-<italic>rpoS</italic>II. After 30&#x02009;min incubation at 15&#x000b0;C, we measured the emission spectrum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>b). Although Cy3 and Cy5.5 emission is clear, Cy5 signal is negligible, indicating that spontaneous interaction between DsrA and <italic>rpoS</italic> does not occur effectively under our experimental conditions (black line; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>b). However, incubation with 28&#x02009;nM Hfq for 25&#x02009;min results in a decreased Cy5.5 signal and an increase in Cy5 emission (blue line; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>b). A larger change in fluorescence signals is seen with 280&#x02009;nM&#x02009;Hfq (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>c). The data show that Hfq enhances both the disruption of <italic>rpoS</italic> internal structure and annealing of DsrA with the upstream strand of the <italic>rpoS</italic> stem, thus in effect carrying out a strand exchange reaction. </p><p>Kinetic data on the strand exchange reaction provide additional details (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>d and e). When Hfq was added to a mixture of DsrA and <italic>rpoS</italic>I+II at <italic>t</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;5&#x02009;min, we observed an abrupt decrease in Cy3 signal and a simultaneous increase in Cy5 signal which we attribute to the rapid association of free single-stranded DsrA and <italic>rpoS</italic>I as we have shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>c. This was followed by a slow decrease in the Cy5.5 signal and a slow increase in the Cy5 signal without significant changes in the Cy3 signal indicating that DsrA gradually replaces <italic>rpoS</italic>II to pair up with <italic>rpoS</italic>I. The decay lifetime of the Cy5.5 signal decrease is &#x0223c;13&#x02009;min, similar to the time scale of melting of <italic>rpoS</italic>I+II at the same Hfq concentration. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>e shows fluorescence signals versus time from <italic>rpoS</italic>I+II where Hfq (28.5&#x02009;nM) is added at <italic>t</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;5&#x02009;min followed by DsrA addition at <italic>t</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;20&#x02009;min. Slow melting of <italic>rpoS</italic>I+II was observed upon Hfq addition similar to what has been seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>c. When DsrA was added, we observed a very rapid increase in FRET from Cy3 to Cy5.5 followed by a slower FRET increase as we have seen from the experiment using <italic>rpoS</italic>I and DsrA only. This experiment suggests that the strand exchange reaction can also proceed by slow melting of the <italic>rpoS</italic> duplex followed by rapid association of DsrA to melted <italic>rpoS</italic>.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>We have examined how Hfq affects the interaction between a non-coding sRNA, DsrA and its regulation target mRNA, <italic>rpoS</italic> using real-time FRET assays. In order to focus on the specific parts of the system that are involved in translational regulation of <italic>rpoS</italic> by DsrA, we limited our investigation to small fragments of DsrA and <italic>rpoS</italic>. In particular, we omitted the P3 site in <italic>rpoS</italic> and loop II domain in DsrA both of which contact Hfq strongly according to footprinting experiments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>). However, our constructs conserved all the known intra- and inter-strand base-pairing as well as uridine-rich regions important for Hfq binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>).</p><p>We demonstrated that Hfq assists in annealing of pre-melted DsrA and <italic>rpoS</italic>I. FRET measurements showed a rapid FRET increase within a few seconds after Hfq addition due to the binding of both DsrA and <italic>rpoS</italic>I to Hfq and formation of a partially annealed complex (allowing energy transfer between the RNAs that are in close proximity). This rapid binding step is followed by a slower FRET increase signifying the subsequent RNA annealing. This is consistent with previous observations of a partially annealed intermediate DsrA&#x02009;&#x02026;&#x02009;<italic>rpoS</italic> complex and only two fold enhancements in annealing in the presence of Hfq at 30&#x000b0;C (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>) and our own EMSA studies. This implies that actual rates of Hfq-mediated annealing are much slower than RNA binding and are in the time scale of minutes at low temperatures.</p><p>Our real-time FRET analysis also showed that Hfq melts <italic>rpoS</italic>I<italic>+</italic>II complex over several minutes. This activity could be important in promoting the final strand exchange since annealing of DsrA and <italic>rpoS</italic> requires pre-melting of the <italic>rpoS</italic> secondary structure. This observation is contrary to previous nuclease footprinting experiments which reported that Hfq recognized several sites on the <italic>rpoS</italic> mRNA without changing the secondary structure in the region that inhibits translation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>). However, the RNA constructs used in the two experiments are different. For example, our fluorescent construct does not contain the P3 site and the two strands of <italic>rpoS</italic> are not covalently linked in our study. Our current result is analogous to that of <italic>sodB</italic> (iron superoxide dismutase) mRNA where Hfq binding to the mRNA does alter its structure by partially opening a loop (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>). We propose that both the rates of denaturation of <italic>rpoS</italic> secondary structure and complete annealing of DsrA&#x02009;&#x02026;&#x02009;<italic>rpoS</italic> are slow at low temperatures (15&#x000b0;C) and will manifest in a slow formation rate (order of 0.1&#x02009;min<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>) of the final DsrA&#x02009;&#x02026;&#x02009;<italic>rpoS</italic> duplex. In fact, temperature-dependent rates of DsrA&#x02009;&#x02026;&#x02009;<italic>rpoS</italic> hybridization determined in a previous report range from 1&#x02009;min<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> at 42&#x000b0;C to 0.01&#x02009;min<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> at 8&#x000b0;C that agree well with our estimates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>).</p><p>Surprisingly, Hfq was also capable of melting the <italic>rpoS</italic>+DsrA complex with the average reaction time of &#x0223c;4&#x02009;min. The net effect is that Hfq can accelerate both annealing and melting reactions depending on initial conditions. The time scales of DsrA&#x02009;&#x02026;&#x02009;<italic>rpoS</italic> annealing and melting promoted by Hfq are similar, in the range of several minutes, suggesting that both of these processes might be competing to achieve equilibrium.</p><p>Note that the experiments were performed at 15&#x000b0;C in order to mimic the physiological function of the mRNA <italic>rpoS</italic> which codes for a factor required for cold shock response. At this temperature, the protein could promote these annealing and melting reactions only 30&#x02013;75 times per generation time of the bacteria; therefore, some additional co-factors might also be involved in one or both of these Hfq activities <italic>in vivo</italic>. For example, ribosomal protein S1 has been already shown to bind to DsrA and <italic>rpoS</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>) and was suggested to interact with Hfq and RNA polymerase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>). This also raises an interesting possibility of a coupling between transcription and Hfq-mediated translational regulation. Consequences of such coupled transcription&#x02013;translational systems need to be examined in the context of role of co-factors in Hfq activity.</p><p>The Hfq protein preparation used in this study is free of RNA and ATP (as judged from absorbance spectrum, see Methods). Thus, both annealing and melting activities are independent of ATP. The hydrolysis of ATP powers the unwinding activity of RNA helicases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>), which promotes disruption of RNA duplexes. By comparison, RNA chaperones have two distinct activities, secondary structure melting and strand annealing, which do not necessarily require NTP hydrolysis. Although Hfq was reported to have an ATPase activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>), such an activity does not appear to be necessary for its RNA chaperone functions in sequence-specific RNA annealing or melting we observed here.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>Our results confirm that Hfq rapidly associates with small RNA regulator, DsrA, and its target <italic>rpoS</italic> mRNA simultaneously increasing their local concentration. We also show that Hfq is a chaperone that can change the conformation of <italic>rpoS</italic> making it accessible to DsrA. We suggest that Hfq accelerates the arrival of the dynamic equilibrium between annealing and dissociation of RNA strands, and spectroscopic assays described here were able to track these processes in real time. Two primary results must be emphasized: (i) Hfq dramatically accelerates the association of DsrA and <italic>rpoS</italic> but eventual annealing of DsrA&#x02009;&#x02026;&#x02009;<italic>rpoS</italic> is slower and (ii) Hfq melts the <italic>rpoS</italic>I+II complex over several minutes. Taking these results into account, we propose a model for the function of Hfq in the translational regulation of <italic>rpoS</italic> by DsrA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>). Hfq binds rapidly to both <italic>rpoS</italic> and DsrA and melts the stem of <italic>rpoS</italic> (average reaction time &#x0223c;4&#x02009;min), which appears to be irreversible. Increased local concentration of both RNAs and melting of <italic>rpoS</italic> facilitates the annealing between <italic>rpoS</italic> and DsrA (average reaction time &#x0223c;9&#x02009;min) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>). Finally, Hfq dissociates from RNA duplex due to its low binding affinity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>). We have also shown that at least one step in the reaction is reversible so that Hfq facilitates the melting of DsrA and <italic>rpoS</italic> (average reaction time &#x0223c;4&#x02009;min). Such an activity of Hfq may be useful in the reversal of post-transcriptional regulation (for example, by re-sequestering the Shine&#x02013;Dalgarno sequence and blocking the ribosome binding site). The overall process is rather slow and it may be that additional co-factors might be assisting this translational regulatory machinery <italic>in vivo</italic>. </p></sec></body><back><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS</title><p>This work was supported by CNRS (UPR 9073), University Denis Diderot-Paris 7 and by the National Institutes of Health (GM 065367).
