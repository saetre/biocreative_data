Furthermore, iGb3 may represent an important obstacle in xenotransplantation, in which this lipid represents the only other form of the major xenoepitope Gal&#x003b1;(1,3)Gal. The role of iGb3 in NKT cell development is controversial, particularly with one study that suggested that NKT cell development is normal in mice that were rendered deficient for the enzyme iGb3 synthase (iGb3S). We demonstrate that spliced iGb3S mRNA was not detected after extensive analysis of human tissues, and furthermore, the iGb3S gene contains several mutations that render this product nonfunctional. We directly tested the potential functional activity of human iGb3S by expressing chimeric molecules containing the catalytic domain of human iGb3S. These hybrid molecules were unable to synthesize iGb3, due to at least one amino acid substitution. We also demonstrate that purified normal human anti-Gal immunoglobulin G can bind iGb3 lipid and mediate complement lysis of transfected human cells expressing iGb3. Collectively, our data suggest that iGb3S is not expressed in humans, and even if it were expressed, this enzyme would be inactive. Consequently, iGb3 is unlikely to represent a primary natural ligand for NKT cells in humans. Furthermore, the absence of iGb3 in humans implies that it is another source of foreign Gal&#x003b1;(1,3)Gal xenoantigen, with obvious significance in the field of xenotransplantation.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><sec id="st1"><title/><p>Identification of endogenous antigens that regulate natural killer T (NKT) cell development and function is a major goal in immunology. Originally the glycosphingolipid, iGb3, was suggested to be the main endogenous ligand in both mice and humans. However, recent studies have challenged this hypothesis. From a xenotransplantation (animal to human transplants) perspective, iGb3 expression is also important as it represents another form of the major xenoantigen Gal&#x003b1;(1,3)Gal. In this study, we assessed whether humans expressed a functional iGb3 synthase (iGb3S), the enzyme responsible for lipid synthesis. We showed that spliced iGb3S mRNA was not detected in any human tissue analysed. Furthermore, chimeric molecules composed of the catalytic domain of human iGb3S were unable to synthesize iGb3 lipid, due to at least one amino acid substitution. We also demonstrated that purified human anti-Gal antibodies bound iGb3 lipid and mediated destruction of cells transfected to express iGb3. A nonfunctional iGb3S in humans has two major consequences: (1) iGb3 is unlikely to be a natural human NKT ligand and (2) natural human anti-Gal antibodies in human serum could react with iGb3 on the surface of organs from pigs, marking these tissues for immunological destruction.</p></sec></abstract><abstract abstract-type="toc"><p>Controversy surrounds the glycolipid iGb3.

However, the physiological relevance of this in mammalian systems was difficult to understand because &#x003b1;-GalCer is not a mammalian product. Zhou et al. &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060172-b007">7</xref>&#x0005d; demonstrated that a deficiency in the lysosomal enzymes &#x003b2;-hexaminidase A and B selectively abrogated NKT cell development, suggesting that glycolipid(s) downstream of these enzymes are responsible for NKT cell selection. Experiments to directly test which of the candidate glycolipids were capable of stimulating NKT cells pointed to the glycosphingolipid, isogloboside 3 (iGb3). Both mouse and human fresh NKT cells, and NKT cell hybridomas and lines, responded to iGb3, and furthermore, specific inhibition of iGb3 on human cells, using isolectin B4 (IB4) that should selectively target iGb3 via its terminal Gal&#x003b1;(1,3)Gal sugars, suggested that iGb3 was also a primary human self-antigen for NKT cells &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060172-b007">7</xref>&#x0005d;. These data led the authors to suggest that iGb3 was the main endogenous ligand responsible for NKT cell development and self-recognition in both mice and humans. Subsequent studies from independent groups have confirmed that iGb3 is an agonist ligand for at least a subset of mouse and human NKT cells &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060172-b008">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060172-b013">13</xref>&#x0005d;, and furthermore, that this glycosphingolipid appears to be important for shaping the NKT cell TCR repertoire in mice &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060172-b012">12</xref>&#x0005d;. However, recent studies have challenged the hypothesis that iGb3 is the primary ligand responsible for NKT cell development in mice &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060172-b014">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060172-b016">16</xref>&#x0005d;. One of these studies &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060172-b016">16</xref>&#x0005d; failed to detect iGb3 in mouse or human thymus, although this study could not exclude the existence of low levels of iGb3, or higher levels of iGb3 expressed by a minor subset of the thymus. Another study &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060172-b015">15</xref>&#x0005d; demonstrated, by using iGb3 synthase (iGb3S) knockout mice, that NKT cell development was apparently normal, which more strongly suggested that iGb3 is at least not essential for this process in mice. Lastly, two papers have provided evidence that the defect in NKT cell development in Hex-b&#x02013;deficient mice may be the lysosomal storage disease that occurs with this mutation, thus causing a nonspecific defect in glycolipid processing and presentation &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060172-b014">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060172-b017">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060172-b018">18</xref>&#x0005d;. The ability of iGb3 to activate human NKT cells is not in dispute; what remains in question is the role of iGb3 in human NKT cell biology.</p><p>Another issue of major importance involving iGb3 is from the perspective of xenotransplantation, in which expression of this glycolipid on the cell surface of pig tissue could represent a major problem if it is not present in humans. iGb3 is synthesized by iGb3S, a member of the &#x003b1;1,3Gal/GalNAc transferase or Family 6 glycosyltransferases. Other family members include &#x003b1;1,3galactosyltransferase (&#x003b1;1,3 GT), and the B blood group transferase, which like iGb3S, transfer &#x003b1;Gal. In contrast, the two other members of the family, A blood group transferase and Forssman synthetase, transfer &#x003b1;GalNAc. Members of Family 6 are the only known mammalian glycosyltransferases that transfer either &#x003b1;Gal or &#x003b1;GalNAc in an &#x003b1;1,3 linkage to their respective acceptor molecules. Analysis of the human genome shows the genes for the &#x003b1;1,3GT, iGb3S, A/B blood group transferase, and the Forssman synthetase are present &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060172-b019">19</xref>&#x0005d;. Recently, GT6m7, a new Family 6 member, was reported &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060172-b019">19</xref>&#x0005d;; however, in humans, the gene for this glycosyltransferase contains a premature stop codon in the last exon. Indeed, mutation appears to be common in this family, with varying effects (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-0060172-t001">Table 1</xref>).</p><table-wrap id="pbio-0060172-t001" content-type="2col" position="float"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Characteristics of Human &#x003b1;1,3Gal/GalNAc (Family 6) Glycosyltransferases</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="pbio.0060172.t001"/></table-wrap><p>In a similar fashion to ABO blood groups, in which natural antibodies are made to specificities that individuals lack, humans produce anti-&#x003b1;Gal antibodies as a consequence of nonfunctional, or nontranslated enzymes.

Thus, organs from GT<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> pigs transplanted into humans may still potentially be subject to rejection by human natural antibodies to Gal&#x003b1;(1,3)Gal in the form of iGb3. The study from Zhou and colleagues &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060172-b007">7</xref>&#x0005d; provided data suggesting that this is unlikely to pose an immediate problem, because they showed that human anti-Gal antibodies did not react with iGb3, presumably because it was a self-ligand that caused deletion of iGb3-reactive lymphocytes in humans. Thus, although there is clearly a significant level of controversy surrounding iGb3, the fact remains that there are compelling results both for and against a role for iGb3 in NKT cell development. For the sake of understanding the factors that regulate this process, as well as whether iGb3 poses an additional problem for xenotransplantion, further studies are required to resolve this issue.</p><p>We recently characterized the mouse iGb3S cDNA &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060172-b024">24</xref>&#x0005d; that encodes the enzyme that synthesizes the Gal&#x003b1;(1,3)Gal xenoepitope on iGb3 by catalysing the transfer of donor sugar from UDP-Gal in an &#x003b1;&#x02212;1,3 linkage to its acceptor molecule Gal&#x003b2;(1,4)Glc-ceramide &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060172-b025">25</xref>&#x0005d;.

To examine expression of iGb3S mRNA in greater detail, reverse-transcription PCR (RT-PCR) was used to analyse several human tissues. Oligonucleotide primers for these experiments (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0060172-st001">Table S1</xref>) were designed based on the exon arrangement of the human iGb3S gene, established by the analysis of Genbank DNA sequences. RNA from heart, kidney, spleen, lung, and thymus (the latter two tissues express iGb3S in both rat and mouse) generated a product of the correct size (&#x0223c;550 bp) with forward and reverse primers within exon five (unpublished data). A product was also obtained from cDNA from human dendritic cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060172-g002">Figure 2</xref>B, lane 6). Some products were confirmed as human iGb3S by direct sequencing (unpublished data). However, generation of products within an exon may be due to genomic DNA or heteronuclear RNA; therefore, amplification across exon boundaries is required to show the presence of mRNA. We have previously shown that iGb3S mRNA can be successfully used as a template for cross-exon RT-PCR from mouse RNA &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060172-b024">24</xref>&#x0005d;. Despite exhaustive attempts (at least 50 times) to amplify human iGb3S using a combination of primers spanning all five exons in different tissues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060172-g002">Figure 2</xref>A), products were either not obtained from human template or the size of several of the PCR products corresponded to that expected from genomic DNA rather than spliced mRNA. The data shown are the amplification from dendritic cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060172-g002">Figure 2</xref>B); however, similar results were also obtained from all tissues examined. Primers across exon 1 to 3, exons 1 to 4, and exons 2 to 4 yielded products expected from amplification of genomic DNA rather than spliced RNA (lanes 1, 2, and 4, respectively, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060172-g002">Figure 2</xref>B and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0060172-st002">Table S2</xref>). The products observed in lanes 6 and 7 are within a single exon and could represent either genomic or mRNA products as there is no splicing over this region of the iGb3S gene. Despite using numerous primer combinations, including forward primers from exons 2, 3, or 4 with a reverse primer from exon 5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060172-g002">Figure 2</xref>C), we were unable to detect any products of the correct size to suggest spliced iGb3S mRNA in any human tissue examined (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060172-g002">Figure 2</xref>D), even when a high cycle number (up to 40) was used (unpublished data).

Whereas glycolipids are known to be synthesized in the Golgi and are typically expressed on the cell surface, the exact transport pathway(s) for newly synthesized glycolipids is not well defined. However, it is assumed to be similar to glycoproteins and involve vesicular flow from the endoplasmic reticulum through the Golgi complex to the plasma membrane. Glycolipids, particularly exogenous glycolipids, can localize to lysosomal compartments via endocytosis. Similarly, our knowledge of how glycolipids control immune responses and the context in which they are presented by CD1d and recognized by NKT cells is also still very limited. Since the glycolipid, &#x003b1;-GalCer, was originally shown to potently stimulate NKT cells in a CD1d-dependent manner, there has been an enormous effort to identify other ligands. Several classes of natural CD1d-binding ligands for NKT cells have been identified, including microbial-derived &#x003b1;-linked glycosphingolipids from the nonpathogenic <italic>Sphingomonas</italic> bacteria and phosphatidylinositol mannoside from <italic>Mycobacteria</italic> (reviewed in &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060172-b029">29</xref>&#x0005d;).

There is no easy interpretation that incorporates and integrates the findings from the studies for, and against, a role for iGb3 in mouse NKT cell development.

Specifically, the formal possibility remains that the minor MS<sup>n</sup> mass spectral signature for iGb4 detected in these studies is derived from related tetraglycosylceramides, as acknowledged by these investigators. Alternatively, the very low levels of iGb4 detected in these analyses may be derived from dietary sources and distributed throughout the body via lipoprotein particles.</p><p>The presence or absence of iGb3 in humans has potential major implications for xenotransplantation. If humans express iGb3S, iGb3 lipid present on transplanted pig tissues will not be &#x0201c;seen&#x0201d; as foreign and therefore would not represent a drawback for xenotransplantation. However, as humans do not express functional iGb3S (reported herein), then the presence of lipid-linked Gal&#x003b1;(1,3)Gal in pigs, synthesized by iGb3S, may pose a serious risk to successful xenotransplantation, even when using &#x003b1;1,3GT knockout pigs as donors (which were specifically generated to eliminate Gal&#x003b1;(1,3)Gal epitopes for xenotransplantation purposes). What are the implications of this in a transplant setting? Currently, we know that expression of iGb3 does not mediate hyperacute rejection of pig tissues transplanted into baboons &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060172-b035">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060172-b036">36</xref>&#x0005d;. However, human serum has at least a 4-fold higher level of natural anti-Gal&#x003b1;(1,3)Gal antibodies (&#x0223c;1&#x00025; of human IgG) than other primates &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060172-b037">37</xref>&#x0005d;<bold>,</bold> so this may not directly represent the human situation. Furthermore, iGb3 expression in pigs may have more serious consequences in the later phases of graft rejection. Firstly, changes in the affinity/avidity of the elicited antibodies may cause tissue damage by complement fixation. It is clear that the level of anti-Gal&#x003b1;(1,3)Gal antibody is critical for the speed of rejection in experimental models &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060172-b038">38</xref>&#x0005d;. Alternatively, elicited anti-Gal&#x003b1;(1,3)Gal antibodies may contribute to the acute vascular rejection observed when hyperacute rejection is eliminated, such as in knockout pig-to-primate transplants, by activation of endothelial cells via cross-linking of the lipid itself. Pathological features similar to acute vascular rejection are seen in humans when the Gb3 lipid (closely related to iGb3) is cross-linked by bacterial toxins &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060172-b039">39</xref>&#x0005d;. Secondly, because iGb3 activates human NKT cells &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060172-b007">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060172-b032">32</xref>&#x0005d; (in which synthetic, purified. and enzymatically derived iGb3 were all tested), consequently the expression of iGb3 on pig cells could lead to NKT cell activation resulting in destruction of the xenograft. Furthermore, our data clearly show that the anti-Gal antibodies in NHS can lyse iGb3 expressing cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060172-g007">Figure 7</xref>) and therefore any remaining iGb3 on pig cells may be a target for antibody-mediated destruction. Whereas it is clear that the use of heavy immunosuppression can control the later phases of xenograft rejection, the major advantage of xenotransplantation over allotransplantation is the ability to genetically modify the donor. The ultimate goal is to engineer a donor pig such that minimal, or indeed no immunosuppression is required for long-term graft survival. It is likely that genetic modification of pigs may be required to eliminate any effects of iGb3. Only at that stage will other obstacles be revealed. Thus, in formally demonstrating the lack of functional iGb3S in humans, this study alerts transplantation immunologists to a previously unrecognised risk associated with expression of iGb3 glycolipid on &#x003b1;1,3GT knockout pig tissues. Expression of this glycolipid could act as a secondary source of Gal&#x003b1;(1,3)Gal xeno-antigen capable of binding natural human anti-Gal antibodies present in normal human serum and marking these cells for destruction by complement mediated lysis.</p><p>In a perspectives article, Godfrey, Pellicci, and Smyth &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060172-b040">40</xref>&#x0005d; asked whether the search for the elusive NKT cell antigen is over.

It had generally been assumed that experimental data obtained from mice would be directly relevant to humans, and Zhou et al. &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060172-b007">7</xref>&#x0005d; provided indirect evidence that iGb3 is also a self-ligand for human NKT cells. However, our new data demonstrate that there appears to be critical differences between the two systems, and suggests that we are a long way from calling off the search for NKT cell-selecting antigens in humans. This remains one of the most important objectives in the field, and will ultimately lead to a better understanding of the factors that regulate NKT cell development and function in health, and in developing novel therapies for the treatment of disease.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Genomic database searching.</title><p>The human genomic iGb3S sequence was obtained from the National Center for Biotechnology Information Web site (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov</ext-link>) and searching the human genomic database.
