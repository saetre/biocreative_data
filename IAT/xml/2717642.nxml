Whether changes in intercellular adhesion can affect &#x003b2;-cat signaling and the mechanism through which this occurs has remained unresolved. We show that axin, APC2, GSK-3&#x003b2; and N-terminally phosphorylated forms of &#x003b2;-cat can localize to cell&#x02013;cell contacts in a complex that is molecularly distinct from the cadherin&#x02013;catenin adhesive complex. Nonetheless, cadherins can promote the N-terminal phosphorylation of &#x003b2;-cat, and cell&#x02013;cell adhesion increases the turnover of cytosolic &#x003b2;-cat. Together, these data suggest that cadherin-based cell&#x02013;cell adhesion limits Wnt signals by promoting the activity of a junction-localized &#x003b2;-cat phosphodestruction complex, which may be relevant to tissue morphogenesis and cell fate decisions during development.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p>The protein &#x003b2;-catenin (&#x003b2;-cat) serves two functions that are fundamental to tissue structure and function. As a central component of intercellular adherens junctions, &#x003b2;-cat links cadherin adhesion receptors to the actin cytoskeleton through the actin-binding protein &#x003b1;-catenin. As a key component of the Wnt signaling cascade, &#x003b2;-cat partners with lymphocyte enhancer factor/T-cell factor (TCF) family DNA-binding proteins to recruit chromatin-modifying factors required for gene expression (for review see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Willert and Jones, 2006</xref>). The fact that cells use &#x003b2;-cat in both cell&#x02013;cell adhesion and transcriptional activation has long suggested that these two processes may be coordinated. Indeed, gain- and loss-of-function studies support a model in which cadherins directly sequester &#x003b2;-cat from the nucleus and serve as a sink for the Wnt-generated cytosolic pool of &#x003b2;-cat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Heasman et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Cox et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Fagotto et al., 1996</xref>). However, whether changes in cell&#x02013;cell adhesion, rather than changes in cadherin abundance, can affect Wnt signaling has remained unanswered.</p><p>In the absence of Wnt, &#x003b2;-cat activity is largely regulated by a multiprotein complex that mediates the phosphorylation-dependent destruction of cytosolic &#x003b2;-cat. Specifically, the scaffold protein axin recruits two Ser/Thr kinases, CK1-&#x003b1; and GSK-3&#x003b2;, directing an ordered phosphorylation of &#x003b2;-cat at Ser45 (by CK1-&#x003b1;) and subsequently at Thr41, Ser37, and Ser33 (by GSK-3&#x003b2;; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Liu et al., 2002</xref>). Phosphorylated Ser33 and Ser37 are recognized by the E3 ligase &#x003b2;-TrCP (transducin repeat&#x02013;containing protein), which leads to the ubiquitylation and degradation of &#x003b2;-cat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hart et al., 1999</xref>). The tumor suppressor adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) appears to facilitate the flux of &#x003b2;-cat through the complex by displacing axin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Ha et al., 2004</xref>). APC2 is a second APC gene expressed in most epithelia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">van Es et al., 1999</xref>). Unlike the APC mutated in colon cancers and found at the ends of microtubules, APC2 localizes to actin-rich structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">McCartney et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Yu and Bienz, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Yu et al., 1999</xref>). Although gain- and loss-of-function studies show that both APCs can inhibit &#x003b2;-cat signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">McCartney et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">van Es et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Yu et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Polakis, 2000</xref>), the different subcellular distributions of APC and APC2, along with evidence that APC2 protein expression is maintained in APC mutant tumors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Jarrett et al., 2001</xref>), suggest that they participate in different phosphodestruction complexes that are subject to distinct regulation.</p><p>Wnts are the best-known inhibitors of the &#x003b2;-cat phosphodestruction complex. These ligands engage a receptor complex and induce the local inactivation of GSK-3&#x003b2; within and/or disruption of the axin scaffold complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Klaus and Birchmeier, 2008</xref>). As a result, an N-terminally hypophosphorylated form of &#x003b2;-cat accumulates, translocates to the nucleus, and activates TCF/lymphocyte enhancer factor family transcription factors. In this study, we show that N-terminal phospho forms of &#x003b2;-cat and components of the phosphodestruction complex are localized to sites of cell contact, where the activity of this complex can be enhanced by cadherin-based cell adhesion.</p></sec><sec><title>Results and discussion</title><sec><title>Epithelial cadherin (E-cad) reduces levels of the signaling form of &#x003b2;-cat by promoting its N-terminal phosphorylation</title><p>The SW480 colon carcinoma cell line exhibits robust &#x003b2;-cat/TCF signaling because of a loss-of-function mutation in APC and low levels of E-cad. Restoration of E-cad expression reduced the oncogenic signaling activity of &#x003b2;-cat without markedly sequestering cytosolic &#x003b2;-cat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Gottardi et al., 2001</xref>). This finding raised the possibility that Wnts might generate a minor, transcriptionally active form of &#x003b2;-cat used for both signaling and adhesion. Alternatively, the cadherin might inhibit &#x003b2;-cat signaling through a mechanism that catalytically inactivates the bulk pool of &#x003b2;-cat.</p><p>It is now appreciated that &#x003b2;-cat unphosphorylated at Ser33, Ser37, and Thr41 is more transcriptionally active than forms of &#x003b2;-cat phosphorylated at these sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Guger and Gumbiner, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Staal et al., 2002</xref>). Several recently developed reagents allow for detection of these specific phosphorylated and unphosphorylated epitopes in the N terminus of &#x003b2;-cat (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 A</xref>). Because SW480 cells are mutant for APC, the regulation and localization of these phospho forms of &#x003b2;-cat, which are normally coupled with ubiquitylation and degradation, can be characterized.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p><bold>Restoring E-cad expression in SW480 cells alters the phosphorylation status of the &#x003b2;-cat N terminus.</bold> (A) &#x003b2;-cat N-terminal epitopes recognized by antibodies to ABC (unphosphorylated at Ser37 and Thr41), P33/37/41, and P41/45.

However, using an antibody that recognizes the signaling form of &#x003b2;-cat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Staal et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">van Noort et al., 2002</xref>), we observe an inverse correlation between E-cad levels and the abundance of this hypophosphorylated form of &#x003b2;-cat (active &#x003b2;-cat [ABC]; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 B</xref>). Even mock-transfected SW480 cells, which normally express low levels of endogenous E-cad, up-regulate E-cad in densely plated cultures and correlate with reduced ABC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 B</xref>, third lane vs. first lane). The total amount of &#x003b2;-cat appears unchanged, suggesting that E-cad may promote the phosphorylation of &#x003b2;-cat and thereby loss of the unphosphorylated epitope. To test this, we used antibodies that recognize &#x003b2;-cat phosphorylated on Thr41 and Ser45 (phospho-41/45 [P41/45]; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 A</xref>) and observe an E-cad&#x02013;dependent increase in &#x003b2;-cat phosphorylated at these sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 C</xref>). As phosphorylation at these residues is associated with reduced signaling activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Guger and Gumbiner, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Staal et al., 2002</xref>), these data suggest that E-cad may be able to inhibit &#x003b2;-cat signaling catalytically by promoting the N-terminal phosphorylation of &#x003b2;-cat.</p></sec><sec><title>Phospho&#x02013;&#x003b2;-cat and components of the destruction complex localize to cell&#x02013;cell contacts in a complex that is distinct from cadherins</title><p>To further characterize this mechanism, we sought to determine the subcellular localization and fractionation characteristics of these phospho forms of &#x003b2;-cat. Of interest, &#x003b2;-cat phosphorylated at either Thr41 and Ser45 (P41/45) or Ser33, Ser37, and Thr41 (P33/37/41) can localize to cadherin-containing cell contacts in cultured cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2, A, B, H, and I</xref>) as well as in situ at adherens junctions in a normal epithelial tissue that exhibits Wnt/&#x003b2;-cat signaling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2, J and K</xref>; and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200811108/DC1">Fig. S1 A</ext-link>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Woodhead et al., 2006</xref>). Because these phospho forms of &#x003b2;-cat are only partially colocalized with cadherin and ABC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2</xref> and Fig. S1 A), we asked whether components of the &#x003b2;-cat phosphodestruction complex also localize to cell contacts. Indeed, immunofluorescence analysis of E-cad&#x02013;expressing SW480 cells reveals that axin, APC2, and GSK-3&#x003b2; can be detected at cell contacts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2, C&#x02013;F</xref>). Although diffuse cytoplasmic and nuclear localizations of these proteins are also evident, as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Henderson, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Cong and Varmus, 2004</xref>), these data agree with earlier studies demonstrating APC2 and axin localization to cell contacts in <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> and <italic>Xenopus laevis</italic>, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Fagotto et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">McCartney et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Yu et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Jarrett et al., 2001</xref>).</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><p><bold>Phospho&#x02013;&#x003b2;-cat and components of the destruction complex localize to cell contacts.</bold> (A&#x02013;D, H, and I) Antibodies to P41/45 and P33/37/41 &#x003b2;-cat (A and B) and axin (C) stain cell contacts but fail to completely colocalize with E-cad (merge, white boxes) or ABC (D, H, and I).

A membrane fraction was isolated from E-cad&#x02013;expressing SW480 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 A</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Gottardi and Gumbiner, 2004a</xref>) and subjected to sucrose density gradient centrifugation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 B</xref>). Using this method, we observe that E-cad floats to the top of the gradient in a light sucrose fraction as expected for a transmembrane protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 C</xref>, ii, lanes 6 and 7), whereas total &#x003b2;-cat partitions equally between this E-cad fraction and more dense fractions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 C</xref>, iii, lanes 1&#x02013;3). Remarkably, these two peak fractions of &#x003b2;-cat can be distinguished by their N-terminal phosphorylation status, such that dense fractions contain &#x003b2;-cat phosphorylated at 33/37/41 and 41/45 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 C</xref>, v and vi), whereas ABC predominantly floats with E-cad in light fractions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 C</xref>, iv, lanes 6 and 7). Although some ABC is observed in the denser fractions, this could result from a lag in coupling the priming phosphorylation at Ser45 to phosphorylation at GSK-3&#x003b2; sites 41, 37, and 33 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 C</xref>, iv, lanes 2&#x02013;5). Most of the ABC at cell contacts fails to colocalize with the phospho forms of &#x003b2;-cat (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2, H and I</xref>, merge, white box), suggesting that ABC is largely associated with the cadherin adhesive complex. Consistent with evidence that phosphorylation of &#x003b2;-cat occurs more efficiently in the presence of the axin complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Dajani et al., 2003</xref>), axin, APC2, truncated APC, and GSK-3&#x003b2; cosediment with phospho&#x02013;&#x003b2;-cat in the dense sucrose fractions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 C</xref>, vii&#x02013;x, lanes 1&#x02013;3). Together, these data suggest that the phospho&#x02013;&#x003b2;-cat observed at cell contacts may be localized to the membrane through an association with the axin&#x02013;phosphodestruction complex rather than binding to E-cad.</p><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><p><bold>Phospho&#x02013;&#x003b2;-cat and components of the destruction complex do not cofractionate with cadherins.</bold> (A and B) Outline of crude membrane fractionation (A) and sucrose density equilibrium centrifugation (B) methods.

As expected for the parental SW480 cells, total membrane-associated &#x003b2;-cat and ABC are largely associated with dense fractions because of the low level of E-cad expression compared with SW480/E-cad cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 D</xref>, ii and iii). However, axin, GSK-3&#x003b2;, APC2, and phospho&#x02013;&#x003b2;-cat forms continued to cosediment in the dense sucrose fractions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 D</xref>, iv&#x02013;vii, lanes 1 and 2; and not depicted). These data suggest that E-cad does not affect the sedimentation characteristics of the membrane-associated axin&#x02013;phosphodestruction complex.</p><p>It is formally possible that the sedimentation of phospho&#x02013;&#x003b2;-cat and components of the destruction complex to dense fractions could be caused by its large size rather than bona fide membrane association. Therefore, we sought to demonstrate that these components are membrane glycoprotein associated using the lectin Con A. As expected, we find that restoring cadherin expression in SW480 cells increases the amount of E-cad, total &#x003b2;-cat and ABC that can be affinity precipitated with Con A beads (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 F</xref>). Although axin, GSK-3&#x003b2;, and APC2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 F</xref> and not depicted) can be precipitated by Con A, restoring cadherin expression did not increase the abundance of these components in the glycoprotein fraction. The activity of GSK-3&#x003b2; was also not altered, at least with regard to the inhibitory phosphorylation at Ser9. However, cadherin expression did increase the amount of the phospho&#x02013;&#x003b2;-cat recruited to a glycoprotein fraction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 F</xref>). Altogether, these data suggest that cadherins may be able to reduce the signaling form of &#x003b2;-cat indirectly by promoting &#x003b2;-cat recruitment to and/or flux through the phosphodestruction complex.</p></sec><sec><title>Cell&#x02013;cell adhesion limits accumulation and activity of the signaling form of &#x003b2;-cat</title><p>To explore this mechanism further, we assessed whether changes in cadherin-based adhesion could impact the signaling form of &#x003b2;-cat in normal human epidermal keratinocytes (NHEKs), which are highly amenable to the Ca<sup>2+</sup> switch approach to control the formation or dissolution of cadherin-based adhesions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Watt et al., 1984</xref>). To determine whether cell adhesion could impact the accumulation of cytosolic &#x003b2;-cat during a Wnt-like signal, NHEKs were stimulated with the Wnt mimic LiCl in the presence of low or normal Ca<sup>2+</sup>, and &#x003b2;-cat was affinity precipitated with GST&#x02013;inhibitor of catenin and TCF (ICAT). ICAT is a small protein that binds to &#x003b2;-cat in the same region as cadherins and can be used to isolate a cadherin-free cytosolic pool of &#x003b2;-cat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Gottardi and Gumbiner, 2004b</xref>). We observe that loss of cadherin-based adhesion (low Ca<sup>2+</sup>) results in enhanced accumulation of cytosolic &#x003b2;-cat (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 A</xref>) as well as the hypophosphorylated form (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 B</xref>, ABC). Importantly, this phenomenon occurs in the absence of changes in cadherin protein levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4, A and B</xref>), or the amount of &#x003b2;-cat association with the cadherin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 C</xref>).

To test this directly, we measured the turnover of cytosolic &#x003b2;-cat in the presence or absence of robust cell contacts in MDCK cells. The phospho forms of &#x003b2;-cat localize to cell&#x02013;cell contacts in these cells and exhibit fractionation characteristics similar to E-cad&#x02013;expressing SW480 cells (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200811108/DC1">Fig. S2, A and B</ext-link>). As with NHEKs, treating MDCK cells with LiCl generated cytosolic &#x003b2;-cat, and this pool of &#x003b2;-cat was followed by affinity precipitation with GST-ICAT (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200811108/DC1">Fig. S3 A</ext-link>) using the cycloheximide (CHX) chase method. Compared with low Ca<sup>2+</sup> conditions, cytosolic &#x003b2;-cat disappears more rapidly in the presence of normal Ca<sup>2+</sup> (Fig. S3 B). This difference in turnover does not appear to be caused by the low concentrations of Ca<sup>2+</sup> itself because cells plated at subconfluency possess more cytosolic &#x003b2;-cat than confluent cells and exhibit slower turnover rates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5 A</xref>). Critically, cadherin protein levels and the integrity of the cadherin&#x02013;catenin complex are unchanged by density (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5, A and B</xref>) or low Ca<sup>2+</sup> conditions (Fig. S3 C), as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">McCrea and Gumbiner, 1991</xref>). Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent adhesion also limits Wnt3a-dependent &#x003b2;-cat accumulation (Fig. S3 D), indicating that the observed effect is not LiCl specific. Altogether, these data suggest that cadherin-based adhesion may limit the extent and/or duration of Wnt/&#x003b2;-cat signals by enhancing the activity of a junction-localized phosphodestruction complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5 E</xref>). According to our model, when less adherent cells receive a Wnt signal such as during migrations that accompany wound healing, the ability of cadherins to activate the junction-localized degradation complex is somehow reduced, allowing the signaling pool of &#x003b2;-cat to persist (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5 F</xref>). Indeed, an MDCK clone that stably expresses a TCF optimal promoter (TOP)&#x02013;destabilized GFP (dGFP; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Dorsky et al., 2002</xref>) shows enhanced reporter activation in cells along the colony edge (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5 C</xref>) or scratch wounds (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5 D</xref>).</p><fig id="fig5" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><p><bold>Density-dependent turnover of cytosolic &#x003b2;-cat.</bold> (A) Turnover of cytosolic (GST-ICAT bound) &#x003b2;-cat by CHX chase method from LiCl-treated subconfluent and confluent MDCK cells.

Although our data do not support a model in which &#x003b2;-cat dissociates from the cadherin, we do show that there is a membrane-localized form of phospho&#x02013;&#x003b2;-cat that is not cadherin associated, raising the possibility that this &#x003b2;-cat may be freed from the membrane as a result of changes in intercellular adhesion. How the phosphodestruction complex is localized to cell contacts and how cadherins promote &#x003b2;-cat N-terminal phosphorylation within this complex are not understood.</p><p>It is becoming increasingly clear that a wide variety of molecular components can affect &#x003b2;-cat signaling, although a simple framework for explaining these effects has not emerged. For example, a <italic>Drosophila</italic> genetic screen for enhancers of &#x003b2;-cat signaling revealed that loss of proteins necessary for the establishment and maintenance of polarity such as the Fat cadherin, Stardust, and Discs large could enhance &#x003b2;-cat signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Greaves et al., 1999</xref>). More recently, components required for primary cilium structure/function and machineries that control planar cell polarity and convergence/extension movements can antagonize &#x003b2;-cat signaling at the level of Disheveled (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Schwarz-Romond et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Corbit et al., 2008</xref>). Although precise mechanisms are lacking, it is likely that many of these components ultimately affect the rate at which &#x003b2;-cat is consumed by the phosphodestruction complex. Because cadherin-based adhesion is a necessary prerequisite for polarity establishment, cilium formation, and planar cell polarity signaling, it may be difficult to tease out whether cadherins promote the activity of the phosphodestruction complex directly or through these other various inputs.</p><p>A model of adhesion-based modulation of Wnt signaling may also be relevant to asymmetric cell divisions that result in cells with distinct differentiative capacities, as seen in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> testes where a contact region between the germline stem cell and a cluster of somatic cells called the Hub is enriched with cadherins and APC2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Yamashita et al., 2003</xref>). Specifically, we propose that cadherin-initiated inheritance and/or activation of a junction-localized &#x003b2;-cat phosphodestruction complex may generate daughter cells with different levels of &#x003b2;-cat signaling leading to distinct cellular outcomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5 G</xref>), suggesting an evolutionarily conserved mechanism relevant to development and stem cell biology.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Cell culture and antibodies</title><p>SW480 and MDCK cells were obtained from American Type Culture Collection.
