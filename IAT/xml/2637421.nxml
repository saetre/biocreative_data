Pax3 and Pax7 are expressed by postnatal satellite cells or their progeny but are down regulated during myogenic differentiation. We now show that constitutive expression of Pax3 or Pax7 in either satellite cells or C2C12 myoblasts results in an increased proliferative rate and decreased cell size. Conversely, expression of dominant-negative constructs leads to slowing of cell division, a dramatic increase in cell size and altered morphology. Similarly to the effects of Pax7, retroviral expression of Pax3 increases levels of <italic>Myf5</italic> mRNA and MyoD protein, but does not result in sustained inhibition of myogenic differentiation. However, expression of Pax3 or Pax7 dominant-negative constructs inhibits expression of <italic>Myf5</italic>, <italic>MyoD</italic> and <italic>myogenin</italic>, and prevents differentiation from proceeding. In fibroblasts, expression of Pax3 or Pax7, or dominant-negative inhibition of these factors, reproduce the effects on cell size, morphology and proliferation seen in myoblasts. Our results show that in muscle progenitor cells, Pax3 and Pax7 function to maintain expression of myogenic regulatory factors, and promote population expansion, but are also required for myogenic differentiation to proceed.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="13"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>The <italic>Pax</italic> gene family contains nine members characterised by the presence of a common paired-box domain that directs binding to specific DNA sequences. <italic>Pax</italic> genes encode transcription factors that have important and highly conserved roles during development.

Infected cells were plated at clonal density and analysed 72 h post-infection by co-immunostaining for either eGFP (green) and MyoD (red); eGFP (green) and Pax3 (red); eGFP (green) and Pax7 (red) or eGFP (green) and BrdU (red), before counterstaining with DAPI. NIH 3T3 fibroblasts did not express Pax3 or Pax7 (c) and constitutive expression of these proteins (a and b) did not elicit the initiation of the myogenic program, as shown by their failure to induce MyoD (a&#x02032;-b&#x02032;). As with myogenic cells, constitutive Pax3 (d) and Pax7 (e) expression resulted in larger clone sizes, while Pax3DN (f) and Pax7DN (g) had the opposite effect, and significantly reduced clone size (quantified in h). Infection of NIH 3T3 cells with Pax3DN RV (f&#x02032;) or Pax7DN RV (g&#x02032;) followed by a 2 h BrdU pulse after 72 h, indicated that S-phase length was not drastically altered (percentage of infected cells containing BrdU (BrdU&#x0002b;ve/eGFP&#x0002b;ve) quantified in i). Cells with double nuclei were present (f&#x02032; and g&#x02032;).

Target gene selection in PAX3-FOXO1A is directed by the <italic>Pax3</italic> sequences and expression of this strong transcriptional activator in fibroblasts can directly promote myogenin transcription and activate a myogenic program <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004475-Khan1">&#x0005b;34&#x0005d;</xref>, to the extent of conversion into fully differentiated myotubes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004475-Scuoppo1">&#x0005b;35&#x0005d;</xref>. However, since both Pax3 and Pax7 can delay the induction of myogenin expression, and so differentiation, it is possible that where inhibitory effects of Pax3 on myogenic differentiation have been reported, the time of analyses might have fallen within this period of pronounced delay <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004475-Epstein1">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004475-Boutet1">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref>. Whilst in our experiments, constitutive expression of Pax3 or Pax7 did not prevent expression of MyHC or fusion into syncytia, the resultant myotubes had a significantly smaller diameter, showing that ectopic Pax3 or Pax7 restricts myoblast accretion and/or myotube growth. Our results indicate that the inhibitory effect of Pax3 or Pax7 on myogenic differentiation may result from an extension of the normal proliferative phase.</p><p>It has been previously reported that dominant-negative inhibition of Pax3 in P19 pluripotent stem cells prevents the adoption of the myogenic, but not cardiac, skeletal lineage <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004475-Ridgeway1">&#x0005b;30&#x0005d;</xref>, demonstrating that dominant-negative constructs can be a useful tool for examining lineage-specific transcriptional regulation. In plated myogenic cells from juvenile (3-wk) mice, adenoviral delivery of Pax3DN or Pax7DN inhibited MyoD but not Myf5, and did not prevent myogenin induction, although the later stages of differentiation were not examined <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004475-Relaix2">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>. In our experimental system using defined adult satellite cell-derived myoblasts, or myogenic cell lines, dominant-negative inhibition of either Pax3 or Pax7 transcriptional targets resulted in essentially indistinguishable cell phenotypes: myogenic cells down-regulated <italic>Myf5</italic> mRNA and both <italic>MyoD</italic> mRNA and protein, and failed to induce <italic>myogenin</italic> mRNA or protein and fuse into myotubes.</p><p>Dominant-negative constructs also slowed the rate of proliferation and induced a dramatic increase in cell size. DNA synthesis (measured by BrdU uptake) was maintained, showing that the cells were still viable and undergoing cell division. Interestingly, we observed frequent doubling of nuclei, implying a failure or retardation of cleavage. This behaviour is analogous to that previously reported in cells treated with very low doses of the cleavage inhibitor cytochalasin. Whereas cells treated with high doses of cytochalasin become binucleate and arrest in G1, cells treated with very low doses become binucleate but maintain DNA synthesis and eventually divide <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004475-Uetake1">&#x0005b;36&#x0005d;</xref>. The inhibition of myogenic differentiation and severe retardation of proliferation that resulted from dominant-negative inhibition of Pax3/Pax7 transcriptional targets is not a phenomenon specific to transformed cell lines because we observed the same effects in primary satellite cell-derived myoblasts. Similarly, primary myoblasts isolated from <italic>Pax7</italic> null mice also display perturbation of the cell cycle and consequently, decreased colony size <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004475-Relaix2">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004475-Oustanina1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>. It is possible that the altered cell morphology caused by the presence of PaxDN constructs could be attributable to perturbed expression of cell surface antigens, since Pax3 is known to affect cell surface properties <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004475-Mansouri1">&#x0005b;37&#x0005d;</xref>, which may affect cell shape by changed adherence to the tissue culture substrate.</p><p>The paired-domain and homeodomain of Pax3 and Pax7 are responsible for directing DNA binding, and are highly conserved between the two proteins. Mouse Pax3 and Pax7 paired domains differ by 8/128 amino acids, and their homeodomains by only 2/60 amino acids <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004475-Jun1">&#x0005b;38&#x0005d;</xref>. In addition, both Pax3 and Pax7 recognise identical consensus DNA sites in vitro <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004475-Du1">&#x0005b;39&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004475-Schafer1">&#x0005b;40&#x0005d;</xref>. It is therefore likely that in adult muscle progenitor cells, there is significant overlap between Pax3 and Pax7 target gene selection, explaining the similar outcomes of infection with Pax3 and Pax7 RV and of inhibiting target gene transcription using the dominant-negative versions. Interestingly, as has been indicated by an earlier study <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004475-Olguin2">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>, not all of the observed effects of Pax genes on myogenic regulatory factors can be attributed to changes in gene expression.

However, whereas expression of Pax3 or Pax7 led to increased levels MyoD protein (as measured either by immunostaining or by Western blot) there were no significant changes in levels of <italic>MyoD</italic> mRNA, suggesting mechanisms other than transcriptional control, such as increased protein stability, are also operating.</p><p>We also analysed Pax3 and Pax7 function in non-myogenic NIH 3T3 fibroblasts, which do not express these <italic>Pax</italic> genes, to determine whether their effects on proliferation rate and cell size were dependent on the myogenic program. In contrast to the ability of ectopic PAX3-FOXO1A <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004475-Khan1">&#x0005b;34&#x0005d;</xref>, Pax3 and Pax7 were unable to induce each other, or myogenic proteins, in NIH 3T3 fibroblasts maintained under expansion conditions, as reported elsewhere <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004475-Gang1">&#x0005b;41&#x0005d;</xref> (although specific culture conditions can produce limited activation of the myogenic program after Pax3 infection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004475-Gang1">&#x0005b;41&#x0005d;</xref>).

In our experiments using NIH 3T3 fibroblasts, constitutive expression of Pax3 or Pax7 resulted in decreased cell size and increased proliferative rate, and expression of Pax3DN or Pax7DN resulted in increased cell size, decreased proliferative rate, and not uncommonly, doubling of nuclei. We do not exclude the possibility that off-target transcriptional effects contribute to the Pax3DN/Pax7DN cell phenotype. However, the effects of constitutively expressing Pax3 or Pax7 demonstrate that these factors are capable of modulating cell morphology and proliferative rate independently of their ability to regulate expression of muscle-specific genes. The recent observations that Pax3 can control components of the FGF signaling pathway provides a possible mechanism for how ectopic Pax3 may influence cell division <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004475-Lagha1">&#x0005b;44&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>In melanocyte precursors, Pax3 simultaneously activates expression of Mitf, a transcription factor critical for melanocyte development, and competitively inhibits Mitf binding to the dopachrome tautomerase enhancer which is required for melanin synthesis by fully-differentiated melanocytes, therefore causing cells to commit to differentiation but yet remain undifferentiated until the repressive Pax3 signal is relieved <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004475-Lang1">&#x0005b;45&#x0005d;</xref>.
