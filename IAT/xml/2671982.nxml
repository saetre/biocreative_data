NFAT is expressed in the epidermis, and although recent data suggest that NFAT is involved in the skin&#x02019;s responses to ultraviolet radiation (UVR), the wavelengths of radiation that activate NFAT and the biological function of UV-activated NFAT remain undefined. We demonstrate that NFAT transcriptional activity is preferentially induced by UVB wavelengths in keratinocytes. The derived action spectrum for NFAT activation indicates that NFAT transcriptional activity is inversely associated with wavelength. UVR also evoked NFAT2 nuclear translocation in a parallel wavelength-dependent fashion and both transcriptional activation and nuclear translocation were inhibited by the calcineurin inhibitor cyclosporin A. UVR also evoked NFAT2 nuclear translocation in three-dimensional skin equivalents. Evidence suggests that COX-2 contributes to UV-induced carcinogenesis. Inhibiting UV-induced NFAT activation in keratinocytes, reduced COX-2 protein induction, and increased UV-induced apoptosis. COX-2 luciferase reporters lacking functional NFAT binding sites were less responsive to UVR, highlighting that NFAT is required for UV-induced COX-2 induction. Taken together, these data suggest that the proinflammatory, antiapoptotic, and procarcinogenic functions of UV-activated COX-2 may be mediated, in part, by upstream NFAT signaling. Flockhart, R.

The radiation emitted by the sun can be divided into three main regions: ultraviolet, visible, and infrared, collectively termed optical radiation <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">(25)</xref>. UVR comprises wavelengths from 100 to 400 nm, which are further divided into three main wavebands: UVA (400&#x02013;315 nm), UVB (315&#x02013;280 nm), and UVC (280&#x02013;100 nm) <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">(25)</xref>. Effects of UVR on skin range from mild inflammation and erythema to hyperplasia, burns, photoageing, and cutaneous malignancies <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">(26)</xref>.

DNA mutations caused by UVA likely arise indirectly <italic>via</italic> oxidative stress or by photosensitisation reactions through absorption of UVA by unidentified chromophores <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">(28)</xref>. Conversely, UVR is used therapeutically for treatment of skin disorders, including psoriasis and atopic eczema <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">(30)</xref>. In the case of psoriasis, successful clearing is wavelength dependent, with UVB radiation being most effective in unsensitized skin <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">(31</xref><xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">, 32)</xref>. It is, therefore, important to consider wavelength-specific responses and employ biologically relevant wavelengths and doses when investigating biological responses to UVR. Investigating the molecular targets of UVR and the signal transduction pathways activated by UVR will increase understanding of both detrimental and therapeutic effects.</p><p>It has recently been shown that UVA increases DNA-binding of NFAT2 in human fibroblasts <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">(33)</xref> and that UVB/UVC radiation activates NFAT in a mouse cell line and in mouse skin <italic>in vivo</italic><xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">(34)</xref>. Solar UVC radiation is absorbed by the atmospheric ozone layer and does not present an environmental hazard. To date, there has been no comparison of the ability of different, physiologically relevant wavelengths to activate NFAT and biological functions of UV-activated NFAT are poorly understood.</p><p>Cyclooxygenases, of which there are two isoforms, are enzymes involved in conversion of arachidonic acid to prostaglandins (PGs). COX-1 is expressed constitutively in most tissues and is a housekeeping enzyme.

After irradiation, the PBS was replaced with fresh medium. For experiments using CsA (Calbiochem, Gibbstown, NJ, USA), cells were incubated with 5 or 10 &#x003bc;M CsA for 16 h prior to irradiation. Lamps used were as follows (shorthand name and percentage of UVB emitted is shown in parentheses): Philips TL 20W/12 RS (TL-12, 53% UVB), Philips TL 20W/01 RS (TL-01, 79% UVB), Helarium R1.01 (Helarium, 16% UVB) and Helarium B1-12-40W (Arimed B, 4% UVB). Arimed B lamps provided the closest spectral match to natural sunlight in this study. The irradiance of all lamps was checked before each experiment using a calibrated photoradiometer. All UVR doses administered were biologically relevant in terms of erythemogenic capacity and ranged from 0.7&#x02013;8.4 SED (standard erythemal dose). One SED is equivalent to an erythemal effective radiant exposure of 100 J/m<sup>2</sup> normalized (according to the erythema action spectrum) at 297 nm.

The reporters have been described previously <xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">(42)</xref> but briefly, P-1900 contains the complete human COX-2 promoter, and the other reporters are derivatives of this, with binding site mutations as follows. The plasmid P-274 lacks NF-&#x003ba;B binding sites. The other COX-2 reporter plasmids are mutants derived from P-274 that lack either the distal NFAT binding site (P-dNFAT-mut), the proximal site (P-pNFAT-mut), or both sites (P-d/pNFAT-mut). In all luciferase experiments, transfection efficiency and cell viability were controlled for by cotransfecting a <italic>Renilla luciferase</italic> control vector (pRLTK; Promega, Southampton, UK), and reporter firefly luciferase values were normalized to the <italic>Renilla</italic> values. Luciferase assays were performed using the dual luciferase assay system (Promega).

The following day, cells were irradiated as described then lysed at the desired time point post-UV.</p></sec><sec><title>Action spectrum</title><p>The NFAT action spectrum was derived by a process of mathematical induction exploring three candidate models; a Gaussian function, a single exponential function of wavelength, and a function representing the sum of 2 exponentials. An optimization solution for each model was derived using the SOLVER facility in Excel (http://www.solver. com/), where it was found that a function representing the sum of 2 exponentials provided the closest match between the observed reciprocal dose for a given end point and that calculated using the model. The basis of the induction approach is to estimate an action spectrum that is described by fewer parameters than the number of sources used, calculate the weighted dose for an appropriate end point (increased NFAT transcriptional activity of 3-fold) and compare these calculated doses with those actually observed. The optimization process involves repeated adjustment of the various parameters until the closest agreement between the calculated and the observed values is achieved. The action spectrum for healing of psoriasis patients using psoralens plus UVA photochemotherapy (PUVA) was defined using this process <xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">(44)</xref> and mathematical induction (although a slightly different method) was also applied to derive a candidate action spectrum for skin cancer induction by UVR <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">(27)</xref>.</p></sec><sec><title>Retroviral transduction</title><p>Human NFAT2 cDNA was cloned from pEGFPc1-NFAT2 <xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">(45)</xref> &#x0005b;a gift from D.

We investigated involvement of NFAT in UV-induced COX-2 induction using COX-2 luciferase reporters that selectively lacked NFAT binding sites. COX-2 luciferase reporter assays indicate that the proximal and distal NFAT binding sites in the COX-2 promoter are required for maximal induction of the COX-2 promoter by UVR (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5<italic>B</italic></xref>). Both Arimed B and TL-12 lamps induced activation of the reporter containing the complete COX-2 promoter (p1900). Interestingly, COX-2 promoter activity was induced more by TL-12 lamps than Arimed B lamps, and this wavelength-dependence parallels that of NFAT induction. UV-induced activity of the reporter lacking the distal NFAT binding site (dmut) did not differ compared to p274. UV-induced activity of the reporter lacking the proximal NFAT binding site (pmut), and the reporter lacking both distal and proximal sites (d/pmut) was significantly reduced compared to p274. This indicates that functional NFAT binding sites are required for maximal induction of the COX-2 promoter by UVR.</p><p>The involvement of NFAT in UV-induced COX-2 protein induction was assessed by treating cells with CsA prior to irradiation. Induction of COX-2 protein by Arimed B lamps was effectively blocked when cells were pretreated with 5 or 10 &#x003bc;M CsA (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5<italic>C</italic></xref>). Taken together with the COX-2 promoter data (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5<italic>B</italic></xref>), this illustrates that NFAT is involved in UV-induced COX-2 induction.</p></sec><sec><title>Inhibiting NFAT activation with CsA increases UV-induced apoptosis</title><p>Apoptosis was quantified 24 h after irradiation in the presence or absence of doses of CsA shown to inhibit UV-induced activation of NFAT <xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">(Fig. 4)</xref>.

NFAT2 was located in the cytoplasm of keratinocytes in untreated FTEs, and no cells stained positively for nuclear NFAT2 (<xref rid="F7" ref-type="fig"><bold>Fig. 7</bold></xref>).

UVR sources that exhibit a high ratio of UVB to total UVR, activated NFAT at much lower doses than lamps with a low ratio (and correspondingly high ratio of UVA to total UVR). The derived action spectrum for NFAT shows that NFAT activity is inversely associated with wavelength. Notably, the action spectrum for NFAT activation is distinct from the action spectra for erythema <xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">(47)</xref> and DNA damage <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">(29)</xref>. This implies that the chromophore for NFAT activation is not DNA and that it is also different from the (unknown) chromophore that is the principal trigger for erythema. It was shown prior to commencement of this study that UVB and UVC increased NFAT transcriptional activity in a mouse cell line and in mice <italic>in vivo</italic><xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">(34)</xref>. However, UVC is not physiologically important in the context of environmental solar exposure, and we are the first to compare the ability of physiologically relevant wavelengths to activate NFAT.</p><p>Since there are four calcineurin-regulated NFATs, we investigated the cellular localization of different NFAT proteins. GFP-NFAT2 translocates to the nucleus following irradiation with 62 mJ/cm<sup>2</sup> TL-12 irradiation, whereas 12,310 mJ/cm<sup>2</sup> is required when using Arimed B lamps. This highlights that nuclear translocation parallels the NFAT transcriptional data, and this observation was also similar for endogenous NFAT2. Interestingly, UVR did not evoke nuclear translocation of NFAT1, 3, or 4 (data not shown), and it appears that NFAT2 is the principal NFAT isoform activated by UVR. Isoform-specific activation of NFAT proteins has also been described elsewhere <xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">(48</xref><xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">, 49)</xref>, and this may be due to differences in the regulatory regions between NFAT proteins.</p><p>NFAT2 nuclear translocation in epidermal equivalents was also preferentially induced by UVB wavelengths. Irradiating epidermal equivalents with 6155 mJ/cm<sup>2</sup> (3.5 SED) using Arimed B lamps did not induce an appearance of cells staining positively for nuclear NFAT2, whereas this was achieved by 124 mJ/cm<sup>2</sup> (3.1 SED) TL-12 irradiation. Arimed B lamps (&#x0223c;4% UVB) were able to induce NFAT2 nuclear translocation when a higher dose was applied (12,310 mJ/cm<sup>2</sup>, 7 SED) and notably, this effective dose was around 100 times higher than that required by TL-12 lamps (&#x0223c;53% UVB), suggesting that UVB wavelengths are more potent activators of NFAT in epidermal equivalents. Furthermore, when irradiating cells with equally erythemogenic doses using Arimed B or TL-12 lamps (3.5 and 3.1 SED, respectively), the lamps that emitted a higher UVB to UVA ratio (TL-12 lamps) were much more effective at inducing NFAT2 activation. That TL-12 lamps were more effective activators of NFAT in epidermal equivalents than Arimed B lamps, is consistent with data showing that TL-12 lamps are more effective at inducing NFAT transcriptional activation and nuclear translocation in cultured keratinocytes <italic>in vitro</italic>.</p><p>Pretreating cells with CsA (at doses shown to inhibit UVR-induced NFAT activation) reduced the amount of COX-2 protein induced by UVR. This suggests an involvement of NFAT in UVR-driven induction of COX-2, and this was confirmed by COX-2 luciferase reporter experiments. The human COX-2 promoter contains binding sites for NF-&#x003ba;B, NF-IL6, CRE binding proteins, and NFAT <xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">(42)</xref>. There are two NFAT binding sites in the COX-2 promoter denoted the distal- and proximal-NFAT binding sites that lie at regions &#x02212;115 to &#x02212;83 and &#x02212;90 to &#x02212;47, respectively. The reporter lacking the distal site did not respond differently compared to the control reporter containing both NFAT binding sites, whereas the reporter lacking the proximal site displayed significantly reduced activity compared to the control plasmid following UV radiation. The reporter lacking both the distal and proximal sites was not induced by UVR. This suggests that the proximal site may be more important for driving COX-2 in response to UVR and that the distal site may serve to support or enhance the activity of the proximal site. The distal NFAT site has been described as a &#x0201c;pure site,&#x0201d; which binds NFAT in the absence of other factors, whereas the proximal NFAT binding site lies adjacent to an AP-1 binding site <xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">(42)</xref>. It is known that UVR induces AP-1 complex formation <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">(26)</xref> and that NFAT and AP-1 often bind DNA in cooperation with each other <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">(18)</xref>. It is likely that UV-induced NFAT and AP-1 both bind the proximal NFAT binding site in the COX-2 promoter, thus accounting for the apparent increased primary importance of the proximal NFAT site. It was also observed that the reporter vector lacking the NF-&#x003ba;B elements (P-274) was induced to a lesser extent by UVR than the complete reporter (P-1900), suggesting involvement of NF-&#x003ba;B. In addition, we show that NFAT is involved in induction of COX-2 by UVR and it is likely that several elements, including NFAT, NF-&#x003ba;B, and CRE are required for maximal induction of COX-2 by UVR <xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">(50)</xref>. Our data are further supported by a study that showed UVB reduced activity of GSK-3&#x003b2; and that overexpression of GSK-3&#x003b2; reduced COX-2 induction by UVB <xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">(51)</xref>. GSK-3&#x003b2; is a protein kinase known to be important in regulating NFAT localization by inhibitory phosphorylation.</p><p>Comparing responses induced by Arimed B and TL-12 lamps also indicates that UVB wavelengths activate the COX-2 promoter more than UVA. This supports findings by Mahns <italic>et al.</italic><xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr">(52)</xref>, who showed that induction of COX-2 in an artificial epidermis was largely UVB driven, and additionally, our data implicates NFAT in this response.</p><p>It is known that UVR induces apoptosis of keratinocytes, and the apoptotic response is likely to serve as a protective, anticarcinogenic response that prevents replication of cells harboring UV-induced DNA mutations. NFAT plays an antiapoptotic role during cardiomyocyte hypertrophy <xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr">(53)</xref>, in bronchial epithelial cells <xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr">(54)</xref>, and in granule neurons in the developing cerebellum <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">(9)</xref>. In our experiments, it was observed that doses of UVR that induced NFAT activation were also doses that induced appreciable levels of apoptosis. It was hypothesized that NFAT may be involved in mediating UV-induced apoptosis either positively or negatively. Pretreating HaCaT keratinocytes with doses of CsA shown to inhibit UV-induced NFAT activation increased the amount of UV-induced apoptosis, suggesting that UV-activated NFAT is antiapoptotic. These data support findings that show inhibiting NFAT with CsA resulted in decreased fibroblast viability following UV irradiation <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">(33)</xref>. Conversely, Yarosh <italic>et al.</italic><xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr">(55)</xref> suggest that NFAT plays a proapoptotic role in response to UVR by presenting data that show CsA reduces apoptosis of keratinocytes <xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr">(55)</xref>. However, this response is only seen when administering a highly cytotoxic dose of UVR <xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr">(55)</xref>. When irradiating cells with a lower dose of UVR, their data clearly show that CsA decreases viability <xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr">(55)</xref>. Our data support the similar responses found in fibroblasts <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">(33)</xref>.</p><p>In our experiments, CsA was used to inhibit UV-induced NFAT activation so that the biological function of UV-activated NFAT could be explored.

Furthermore, NFAT2 has been shown to induce a transformed phenotype in fibroblasts <xref rid="B63" ref-type="bibr">(63)</xref>. Our data suggest that NFAT signaling may be worthy of further study in the context of epidermal carcinogenesis in response to UVR.</p></sec><sec><title>CONCLUSIONS</title><p>We have demonstrated wavelength-dependent induction of NFAT by UVR, with UVB wavelengths being potent activators of NFAT. It is shown that inhibiting NFAT signaling causes increased apoptosis following irradiation, suggesting that UV-activated NFAT acts antiapoptotically in keratinocytes. NFAT is involved in induction of COX-2 by UVR and like NFAT; COX-2 is induced more effectively by UVB wavelengths. Taken together, our data suggest that the proinflammatory and procarcinogenic role played by COX-2 in response to UVR, may be mediated, in part, by upstream NFAT signaling.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>This work was funded by The British Skin Foundation (R.J.F.) and Wellcome Trust Research Leave Fellowship (N.J.R.).
