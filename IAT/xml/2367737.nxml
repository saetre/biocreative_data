Binding of miRNA to messenger RNA (mRNA) and structural features of the complex are crucial for gene silencing.

The 33-nt RNA construct folds into a stem&#x02013;loop structure that features two stem regions which are separated by an asymmetric internal loop. One of the stems comprises a GU wobble base pair, which does not alter its overall A-form RNA conformation. The asymmetric internal loop adopts a single, well-defined structure in which three uracils form a base triple, while two adenines form a base pair.

They regulate diverse biological processes such as developmental timing, differentiation, cell proliferation and apoptosis. Bioinformatics data indicate that each miRNA can control hundreds of gene targets, underscoring the potential influence of miRNAs on many genetic pathways. The enzyme Dicer produces miRNAs from endogenous stem&#x02013;loop RNA molecules giving rise to single-stranded molecules of about 21 to 23 nt in length (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>). Mature functional miRNA molecules are partially complementary to mRNA molecules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>) and their function is to repress protein synthesis. An example of an evolutionary conserved miRNA is <italic>let-7</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>). The 21-nt <italic>let-7</italic> miRNA, which was originally discovered as an essential regulator of developmental timing in the nematode <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic>, was later shown to be highly conserved in several organisms including humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>). On the other hand, <italic>lin-41</italic> is the first <italic>C. elegans</italic> heterochronic gene that has mammalian homologs involved in developmental timing. Studies by Slack <italic>et al</italic>. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>) showed that <italic>lin-41</italic> is temporarily expressed during mouse embryonic development in several tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>). While expression of <italic>lin-41</italic> is downregulated during mouse development, expression of <italic>let-7</italic> is upregulated. <italic>lin-41</italic> and many other mRNAs possess complementary sites for <italic>let-7</italic> miRNA in their 3&#x02032;-UTR regions. Numerous miRNAs, termed &#x02018;oncomirs&#x02019; are associated with cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>). In this respect, it has recently emerged that <italic>let-7</italic> is a promising therapeutic agent to treat lung cancer caused by mutations in <italic>RAS</italic> lung genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>). The formation of <italic>let-7</italic>:<italic>lin-41</italic> complexes suppresses expression of <italic>lin-41</italic> through the miRNA silencing mechanism which in turn regulates the transition from the last larval stage to adulthood in a nematode.</p><p>The purpose of the current study was to expand our knowledge on the process of miRNA-induced control of gene expression by focusing on the structural determinants that influence the stability of <italic>let-7</italic> miRNA:<italic>lin-41</italic> mRNA complex with the use of high-resolution NMR spectroscopy in aqueous solution. <italic>let-7</italic> miRNA forms two distinct complexes with the 3&#x02032;-UTR of the <italic>lin-41</italic> mRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>). We have concentrated on one of the <italic>let-7</italic> complementary sites (LCS 2) and designed a 33-nt model RNA stem&#x02013;loop construct by linking the two strands (i.e. miRNA and mRNA) with the GAAA tetraloop (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>). Our construct forms a stable structure consisting of two stem regions separated by the asymmetric internal loop. An additional CG base pair was included to close the GAAA tetraloop and increase the stability of the construct. 5&#x02032;-U of the <italic>let</italic>-7 miRNA was removed, and an additional GC base pair was added at the end of the construct to facilitate <italic>in vitro</italic> transcription. <fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic representation of the complex of <italic>let-7</italic> miRNA with 3&#x02032;-UTR of the <italic>lin-41</italic> mRNA (LCS 2).

In this way, a potential role of the internal loops and mismatch base pairs which are frequently found in miRNA:mRNA complexes involved in the regulation of gene expression would be evaluated. Elements of secondary structure other than canonical Watson&#x02013;Crick base pairs are expected to potentially induce bends in the structure or lead to changes in groove dimensions which are important for recognition in the RISC complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>). These local structural changes are expected to affect the thermodynamic stability of the miRNA:mRNA complex, water and cation localization, its predisposition for interaction with other (macro)molecules and molecular recognition properties. Similarly, it is not clear what is the limiting degree and nature of base pairing that is decisive as to choice of the gene suppression pathway entered by small noncoding RNAs. It has been shown that miRNAs can also work as small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) which are perfectly base paired with target mRNAs and negatively regulate gene expression by promoting degradation of mRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>).</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Sample preparation</title><p>The <sup>13</sup>C,<sup>15</sup>N uniformly labeled RNA construct was transcribed using standard enzymatic methods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>) with T7 RNA polymerase (Promega), <sup>13</sup>C,<sup>15</sup>N-labeled rNTPs (Silantes) and a partially double-stranded DNA template (IDT-DNA) consisting of a T7 promoter and a coding template strand. The template strand was modified with C2&#x02032;-methoxyls on the last two residues of the 5&#x02032; end (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>). The transcription reaction was quenched using EDTA, the transcribed RNA was precipitated in ethanol and the precipitate was recovered after centrifugation by redissolving it in water. The target 33-nt RNA sequence was purified from abort transcripts using denaturating (7 M urea) PAGE electrophoresis (17%). The transcribed 33-nt RNA was excised from the gel and recovered by electroelution (Schleicher &#x00026; Schuell). The electroeluted RNA solution was finally extensively dialyzed against an NMR buffer (starting from a high salt buffer and gradually reducing the ionic strength) using microcentrifugation tubes (Centricon, Millipore). The NMR sample was prepared by dissolving the RNA in an aqueous solution (10 mM sodium phosphate buffer, pH 6.7, 20 mM NaCl, 95% H<sub>2</sub>O, 5% <sup>2</sup>H<sub>2</sub>O or 100% <sup>2</sup>H<sub>2</sub>O), heated to 368 K and snap-cooled onto ice. The sample concentration was 2.0 mM. The sample used to measure RDCs was prepared (1.0 mM in RNA) by mixing the oligonucleotide with a 50 mg/ml filamentous Pf1 phage solution (Asla Ltd) to a total phage concentration of 17 mg/ml (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>). Deuterium splitting was 15.2 Hz at 800 MHz. UV melting of the construct was measured using a Perkin&#x02013;Elmer Lambda Bio 40 spectrometer equipped with a Peltier system. The melting temperature was 343 K (1.9 &#x003bc;M oligonucleotide, 10 mM sodium phosphate buffer, pH 6.7, 20 mM NaCl).</p></sec><sec><title>NMR spectroscopy</title><p>NMR data were acquired on Varian NMR Systems 600 and 800 MHz NMR spectrometers.

The volume of the pyrimidine H5-H6 cross-peak was used to set the reference distance of 2.45 &#x000c5;. Other proton&#x02013;proton distances were calculated using the <italic>I</italic> &#x0223c; <italic>r</italic><sub>ij</sub><sup>&#x02013;6</sup> relation. NOE distance restraints of exchangeable protons were obtained from the 2D NOESY spectra of the 95% H<sub>2</sub>O sample recorded with a 75 and 300 ms mixing time at 278 and 298 K with WATERGATE pulse sequence for solvent suppression. Cross-peaks were classified as strong (1.8&#x02013;3.6 &#x000c5;), medium (2.6&#x02013;5.0 &#x000c5;) and weak (3.5&#x02013;6.5 &#x000c5;). Additional NOE distance restraints for nonexchangeable protons were obtained from two 3D NOESY-<sup>13</sup>C-HSQC spectra (one for aromatic and one for ribose protons) recorded at 298 K with 150 ms mixing time. Altogether, 693 NOE distance restraints were used in the structure calculation, out of which 74 were from exchangeable protons. The &#x003b4; torsion angle was restrained to N-type sugar geometry for nucleotides with absent H1&#x02032;-H2&#x02032; cross-peaks in the DQF-COSY spectrum. Torsion angles &#x003bd;<sub>0</sub>&#x02013;&#x003bd;<sub>4</sub> of U24 were restrained to the values characteristic for S-type sugar geometry. The &#x003c7; torsion angles of nucleotides in the stems were estimated from the intensities of intranucleotide H6/H8-H1&#x02032;/H2&#x02032; cross-peaks in 2D NOESY spectra, and were therefore set to <italic>anti</italic> (210 &#x000b1; 40&#x000b0;). The &#x003b2; torsion angles of the stem nucleotides were restrained to <italic>trans</italic> (180 &#x000b1; 40&#x000b0;) due to the absence of P-H5&#x02032; and P-H5&#x02033; cross-peaks in the 2D HP-COSY spectrum. The <italic>&#x003b5;</italic> torsion angle was restrained to <italic>trans</italic> for all stem nucleotides. Torsion angles &#x003b1; and &#x003b6; were set to exclude the <italic>trans</italic> conformation due to the narrow range of <sup>31</sup>P resonances. We did not apply any backbone torsion restraints for residues in the asymmetric internal loop and GAAA tetraloop. Experimental RDC values were used in the simulations directly.</p><p>Structure calculations were performed using AMBER 9 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>) with a Wang <italic>et al</italic>.

Structures were then subjected to 60 ps of restrained simulated annealing (SA) calculations using a generalized Born implicit solvation model. The molecules were heated to 1000 K during the first 5 ps, after which temperature was constant for 30 ps, scaled down to 100 K in the next 11 ps and reduced to 0 K in the last 14 ps. The force constants were 35 kcal mol<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> &#x000c5;<sup>&#x02212;2</sup> for NOE distance, 300 kcal mol<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> rad<sup>&#x02212;2</sup> for torsion angle and 25 kcal mol<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> &#x000c5;<sup>&#x02212;2</sup> for base planarity restraints. The cutoff for nonbonded interactions was 20 &#x000c5;. The SHAKE algorithm for hydrogen atoms was used with a tolerance of 0.0005 &#x000c5;. All structures from SA were subjected to a maximum of 10 000 steps of conjugate gradient minimization. A family of 10 minimized structures with the lowest energy and the smallest NMR violations were analyzed using ptraj and suppose programs.

The 1D proton NMR spectrum displays nine well-resolved peaks in the region from 12.3 to 14.5 p.p.m., which is typical for Watson&#x02013;Crick imino proton resonances (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>B). The five additional imino proton resonances were found in the region from 10.5 to 11.7 p.p.m. and were assigned to non Watson&#x02013;Crick base-paired residues from the asymmetric internal loop, the GAAA tetraloop and the GU wobble base pair. Base pairing network was initially analyzed through imino&#x02013;imino and imino&#x02013;amino sequential walks in 2D NOESY spectra, and subsequently confirmed by the HNN-COSY spectrum, which correlated each imino proton with two nitrogen atoms within the regular GC and AU Watson&#x02013;Crick base pairs. The most upfield cross-peaks with the nitrogen chemical shifts in the range from 146 to 152 p.p.m. belong to ten guanine N1 atoms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>A). Eight of them show correlations with the corresponding cytosine N3 atoms with the characteristic chemical shifts in the range from 197 to 202 p.p.m. The cross-peaks with nitrogen resonances in the chemical shift range from 159 to 167 p.p.m. belong to N3 atoms of six uracils. U13, U27 and U31 are correlated with Watson&#x02013;Crick hydrogen-bonded partners, A20, A7 and A3, respectively, which exhibit N1 chemical shifts in the range from 223 to 226 p.p.m. (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>A). Imino protons of U6, U9, G15, U25 and G28 do not show correlations with adenine or cytosine <sup>15</sup>N atoms, which suggests that they are not involved in Watson&#x02013;Crick base pairs. <fig id="F2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><p>(<bold>A</bold>) HNN-COSY spectrum of 33-nt RNA molecule showing A-U and G-C base pairs (indicated by vertical lines).

The lower stem is stabilized by the 8 bp with U6&#x000b7;G28 being the wobble base pair. Three GC and one AU base pair stabilize the upper stem. The chemical shifts of U9, G15 and U25 imino protons are indicative of noncanonical base pairs which contribute to the stabilization of the internal and apical loops. The imino proton of U24 could not be observed neither at 278 K nor 298 K presumably due to its exposure to fast exchange with bulk solvent. No cross-peak was observed in the HNCCCH spectrum for U24, whereas imino protons of U9 and U25 showed correlations to their H6 protons (see <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkn088/DC1">Figure S1 in the Supplementary Data</ext-link>).</p></sec><sec><title>Resonance assignment</title><p>Our assignment procedure could be dissected into three steps. One of the steps established mutual intranucleotide correlations between imino, amino and aromatic protons and heteroatoms with the use of homonuclear and heteronuclear base experiments. H6 of cytosine and uracil residues were assigned through their correlations with amino and imino protons. H5 protons were assigned with the use of a 2D TOCSY spectrum which exhibited resolved correlations between H5 (&#x003b4; 5.0&#x02013;5.9 p.p.m.) and H6 proton resonances (&#x003b4; 7.4&#x02013;8.1 p.p.m.). The assignment of guanine H8 proton resonances was done through their correlations with imino protons within a guanine base. H2 protons of A3, A7 and A20 showed resolved correlations with uracil imino protons in the 2D NOESY spectrum. In addition, H2 and H8 protons of adenine residues, including those not involved in AU base pairs, were correlated with the use of a 2D HCCH-TOCSY spectrum.</p><p>The next step in our assignment procedure led to the identification of the ribose protons. 3D HCCH-COSY, 3D HCCH-RELAY and 3D HCCH-TOCSY spectra helped us to perform the assignment of all ribose protons including H5&#x02032; and H5&#x02033;. We noticed some unusual chemical shifts which were, however, characteristic for a GAAA tetraloop. For instance, the chemical shift of H3&#x02032; of A18, the last adenine in the tetraloop, appeared downfield at 5.13 p.p.m. H1&#x02032; of G19 which follows the GAAA tetraloop at the 3&#x02032; end resonates at 3.61 p.p.m. We noticed that ribose cross-peaks of G15, A16 and A17 were weak which suggested that their sugar moieties were involved in an unbiased pseudorotational equilibrium.</p><p>In the last step of our assignment, aromatic and ribose spin systems were coupled together using a 2D HCN experiment, which correlated most of the H1&#x02032; and H8 to purine N9, and H1&#x02032; and H6 to pyrimidine N1.</p><p>The problem of considerable spectral overlap in the ribose region of 2D NOESY spectra was reduced by utilizing 3D NOESY-<sup>13</sup>C-HSQC spectra.

Weak sequential NOE cross-peaks were observed between C14 H1&#x02032; and G15 H8, and between G15 H1&#x02032; and A16 H8 which are due to the long distances imposed by stacking of A16, A17 and A18 bases in the GAAA tetraloop.

Both 1D and NOESY spectra of stem&#x02013;loop and dimer constructs show evident similarities, and are almost identical except for the GAAA tetraloop which is replaced with the closing GC base pair in the latter.</p></sec><sec><title>Residual dipolar couplings</title><p>One-bond <sup>1</sup>H-<sup>15</sup>N residual dipolar couplings (RDCs) were measured from the splitting of the peaks along the nitrogen dimension of the 2D IPAP <sup>15</sup>N-HSQC spectrum and comparing the data for the samples before and after addition of Pf1 phage (Figure S4). The spectra used for quantification of RDC values were of high quality with narrow line widths showing no apparent signs of aggregation or interaction between phage and RNA. Altogether, 14 one-bond <sup>1</sup>H-<sup>15</sup>N RDC values were collected with values in the range from &#x02212;17.7 to &#x02212;5.0 Hz (Table S1). The lower stem exhibited one-bond <sup>1</sup>H-<sup>15</sup>N RDC values between &#x02212;17.7 and &#x02212;11.7 Hz and the upper stem between &#x02212;11.5 and &#x02212;10.7 Hz. These RDC values thus implied that the upper stem was not collinear with the lower stem. One-bond <sup>1</sup>H-<sup>13</sup>C RDC values were measured for H2-C2, H6-C6 and H8-C8 bonds. These RDC values were found in the range from 8.3 to 34.3 Hz and were similar for the lower and upper stems. Residues G4, G5 and A7 from the lower stem exhibited higher <sup>1</sup>H-<sup>13</sup>C RDC values than the other residues. G1 and C33 exhibited the lowest values which were attributed to the end frying. GAAA tetraloop residues exhibited <sup>1</sup>H-<sup>13</sup>C RDC values in the range from 12.1 to 20.1 Hz, while for residues in the asymmetric internal loop the corresponding values were in the range from 22.3 to 34.7 Hz.</p></sec><sec><title>Sugar conformation</title><p>The 2D DQF-COSY spectrum indicated the absence of most of H1&#x02032;-H2&#x02032; cross-peaks, which suggested that sugars in the stem regions adopted predominantly an N-type conformation. However, U24 exhibited a high <sup>3</sup><italic>J</italic><sub>1&#x02019;2&#x02019;</sub> coupling constant (&#x0223c;8 Hz) implying the predominance of S-type conformation for its sugar moiety. We observed weak H1&#x02032;-H2&#x02032; cross-peaks for residues A16, A17, A23 and C33, which indicated that their sugar rings are involved in an unbiased N-S conformational equilibrium. Consequently, sugar conformations of these four residues were not restrained in the course of structure calculations.</p></sec><sec><title>Structural restraints</title><p>NOE cross-peak volumes were translated into distances using the Felix 2002 program (Accelrys Inc.). 2D NOESY spectra acquired in 95% H<sub>2</sub>O were used for distance calculations involving exchangeable protons (imino&#x02013;imino, imino&#x02013;amino and imino&#x02013;H2 cross-peaks). These types of distance restraints were particularly valuable to establish spatial relations of sequential nucleotides as well as connectivities across the asymmetric internal loop. The distances between nonexchangeable protons were derived from 2D NOESY spectra acquired in 100% <sup>2</sup>H<sub>2</sub>O. Due to the considerable overlap in 2D NOESY spectra only resolved cross-peaks were used in the calculation of distance restraints. The 3D NOESY-<sup>13</sup>C-HSQC spectra were then used to quantitate the volumes of additional cross-peaks which were classified as strong, medium and weak. Internucleotide NOE contacts in the asymmetric internal loop are displayed schematically in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>. We noticed that the asymmetric internal loop exhibited a smaller number of NOEs per residue than the rest of the molecule. <fig id="F4" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><p>Schematic presentation of internucleotide NOE contacts in the asymmetric internal loop and the closing GC base pairs.

Thirty-two hydrogen bond and 22-bp planarity restraints were applied for GC, AU and GU base pairs in the two stems. No hydrogen bond and planarity restraints were used within the asymmetric internal and terminal loops. After extensive simulated annealing and energy minimization steps on over 100 structures our calculations converged to a family of 10 structures that agreed with all the available NMR data. NOE distance violations for the final set of 10 structures were below 0.4 &#x000c5; and torsion angle violations were below 5&#x000b0;. A perusal of the family of final structures shows that all parts of the 33-nt construct are well-defined (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>). Residues U9, U24 and U25 in the asymmetric internal loop form a base triple, while A10 and A23 form a base pair (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>).

It has been recently shown that mRNA can be targeted to control gene expression. RNA interference, chosen as the breakthrough of the year 2002 by the <italic>Science</italic> magazine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>), describes the ability of small and apparently structurally simple RNA molecules to switch off or regulate expression of specific genes in a wide variety of organisms ranging from plants to humans by binding to stretches of mRNA. Insight into the intricate mechanisms that induce the silencing function of the short RNAs is of critical importance in understanding their biological roles as well as in potential applications as drugs.</p><p>The 33-nt RNA construct, which mimics a complex between the <italic>C. elegans let-7</italic> miRNA and its imperfectly complementary site from the 3'-UTR of the <italic>lin-41</italic> mRNA (LCS 2), has been shown to fold into a well-defined stem&#x02013;loop structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>). NMR data and subsequent structure calculations have demonstrated that the structure exhibits two stems which are separated by an asymmetric internal loop. The lower stem is stabilized by seven Watson&#x02013;Crick and a GU wobble base pair and shows conformational features of A-form RNA. Hydrogen bonds within the U6&#x000b7;G28 base pair are formed between the U6 imino proton and the G28 O6 atom, and between the G28 imino proton and the U6 O2 atom (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>). The amino group of G28 points into the minor groove. The two bases of the GU base pair are rotated differently in comparison to the standard AU and GC Watson&#x02013;Crick base pairs. The &#x003bb; angle between the glycosidic bond and C1&#x02032;-C1&#x02032; line in a base pair is 69&#x000b0; for U6 and 38&#x000b0; for G28, while it is &#x0223c;54&#x000b0; for residues involved in Watson&#x02013;Crick base pairs. In addition, the U6&#x000b7;G28 wobble base pair affects the helical twist (&#x0223c;41&#x000b0;) with the A7&#x000b7;U27 base pair. The upper stem consists of four Watson&#x02013;Crick base pairs and exhibits an average twist and rise parameters of 32.7&#x000b0; and 3.0 &#x000c5;, respectively. For comparison, twist and rise parameters in A-form RNA are 32.7&#x000b0; and 2.8 &#x000c5;, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>).</p><p>The asymmetric internal loop adopts a single well-defined structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>A). U9 and U25 form a base pair with hydrogen bonds between imino protons and carbonyl groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figures 6</xref>B and S5) similar to the UU base pair described earlier (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>). The residue U24 is placed in a coplanar arrangement with respect to U9 and U25 thus forming a base triple (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>B). The puckering of the sugar ring of U24 is in the South conformation (C2&#x02032;-endo) with the phase angle of pseudorotation and the maximum puckering amplitude equal to 162&#x000b0; and 24&#x000b0;, respectively. In order to position nucleotide U24 next to U25, the torsion angles &#x003b6; in U24 and &#x003b1;, &#x003b2; and &#x003b5; in U25 adopt conformations outside their usual ranges found in A-form RNA. A10 and A23 form a base pair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>) with a hydrogen bond between the A10 amino proton and A23 N1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>B). The A10&#x000b7;A23 base pair is not corroborated by the observable amino group protons, which could have been resolved from a crowded amino&#x02013;amino region of the NOESY spectra. However, this base pair is supported by the correlation peak between the A10 H2 and A23 H2 proton observed in the 3D NOESY-<sup>13</sup>C-HSQC spectrum. The stacking of the nucleobases in the asymmetric internal loop is extensive and probably contributes to a well-defined and thermodynamically stable structure. The slide of the A10&#x000b7;A23 with respect to the U9&#x000b7;U25 base pair positions A10 above the U9&#x000b7;U25 base pair, and A23 above U24 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>A). The G8-C26 and G11-C22 base pairs close the asymmetric internal loop at the two ends. The U9&#x000b7;U25 base pair is stacked over the G8-C26 base pair. G11 is stacked over the center of the A10&#x000b7;A23 base pair, and C22 is stacked on A23. The helical twist between the G8-C26 and U9&#x000b7;U25 base pairs is around 36&#x000b0;.</p><p>The GAAA tetraloop exhibits characteristic and expected chemical shifts and structural features (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>). NMR spectra clearly show that the G15 imino proton is not freely accessible to solvent. The tetraloop thus consists of a sheared G15&#x000b7;A18 mismatch base pair and A16 and A17 which stack on A18. The G15&#x000b7;A18 base pair has a small helical twist (&#x0223c;10&#x000b0;) which positions A18 directly above G19 H1'. Additional hydrogen bonds, e.g. between the G15 amino proton and phosphate oxygen in the A16pA17 step, make the tetraloop very stable. Sugar puckers of adenine nucleotides in the GAAA tetraloop display unbiased pseudorotational equilibrium between N- and S-puckered conformations.</p><p>One-bond <sup>1</sup>H-<sup>15</sup>N and <sup>1</sup>H-<sup>13</sup>C RDC values suggest that the lower and upper stems are not completely collinear. The analysis of helical parameters of the lower and upper stems showed that their helical axes exhibited an angular bend of &#x0223c;20&#x000b0;. In recent years, several RNA structures have been determined which consist of internal loops, bulges or noncanonical base pairs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37 B38 B39 B40 B41 B42 B43">37&#x02013;43</xref>). Leeper and Varani (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>) have shown that the (2 + 3) internal loop &#x02018;J6&#x02019; in the structure of an enzyme-activating fragment of the human telomerase RNA introduces an angular bend of 20&#x000b0; between the two helical axes. This value is similar to the angular bend found in our construct. The structures of the two asymmetric internal loops show some similarities, although consisting of different nucleotides. For example, the base-stacking pattern between C288, A289 and C290 in Varani's structure is analogous to the base-stacking between C22, A23 and U24 in our construct. A potential C266&#x000b7;U291 base pair in the former is similar to the U9&#x000b7;U25 base pair in the construct studied here. The two internal loops differ, however, in base triple formation. C267 is hypothesized to lie coplanar with the G268-C288 base pair outside the internal loop (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>). U24, which is in our model system on the opposite side of the asymmetric internal loop, is coplanar with U9 and U25. A10 and A23 form a base pair and stack with G11-C22 base pair which closes the asymmetric internal loop.</p><p>The solution structure of the apical stem&#x02013;loop of the human hepatitis B virus encapsidation signal shows that a single nucleotide bulge induces &#x0223c;20&#x000b0; bend between the lower and the upper helices, which leads to an increase in deepness of the major groove (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>). The asymmetric internal loop in our model system bends both stems in such a way that the major groove becomes wider.</p><p>Asymmetric internal loops and mismatch base pairs are common for the miRNA:mRNA complexes.
