NF1 tumor suppressor protein, neurofibromin, has been shown to regulate ras: the NF1 protein contains a GTPase activating protein (GAP) related domain which functions as p21rasGAP. Our studies have previously demonstrated that the NF1 protein forms a high affinity association with cytokeratin 14 during the formation of desmosomes and hemidesmosomes in cultured keratinocytes.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p>The expression of NF1 protein was studied in developing human epidermis using western transfer analysis, indirect immunofluorescence, confocal laser scanning microscopy, immunoelectron microscopy, and <italic>in situ</italic> hybridization.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The expression of NF1 protein was noted to be highly elevated in the periderm at 8 weeks estimated gestational age (EGA) and in the basal cells at 8&#x02013;14 weeks EGA. During this period, NF1 protein was associated with cytokeratin filaments terminating to desmosomes and hemidesmosomes. NF1 protein did not display colocalization with &#x003b1;-tubulin or actin of the cytoskeleton, or with adherens junction proteins.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>These results depict an early fetal period when the NF1 tumor suppressor is abundantly expressed in epidermis and associated with cytokeratin filaments. This period is characterized by the initiation of differentiation of the basal cells, maturation of the basement membrane zone as well as accentuated formation of selected cellular junctions. NF1 tumor suppressor may function in the regulation of epidermal histogenesis via controlling the organization of the keratin cytoskeleton during the assembly of desmosomes and hemidesmosomes.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>The epidermis is derived from the embryonic ectoderm and is first detectable at 4 weeks estimated gestational age (EGA). At this time, the epidermis is composed of two distinct layers of cells. The surface layer, or the periderm, forms the outer limits of the embryo facing the amniotic fluid. Underneath the periderm lies the basal cell layer of the primitive epidermis. The maturation of the epidermis includes development of the intermediate cell layers simultaneously with the maturation of the basement membrane zone between 9 and 16 weeks EGA, shedding of the periderm layer and final maturation into stratified squamous epithelium by the beginning of the third trimester [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. The development of cellular junctions takes place concomitantly with the morphological maturation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. These events include the formation of desmosomes, adherens junctions, tight junctions and hemidesmosomes. The formation of cellular junctions is important for the proper development of epidermis, since e.g. conditional ablation of &#x003b1;-catenin, a cytoplasmic plaque protein of adherens junctions, in skin results in dramatic alterations in the morphogenesis and differentiation of epidermis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. The formation of hemidesmosomes and subsequent attachment of the keratinocytes to the underlying basement membrane is essential for the polarization of the basal cells of epidermis. The protein plaques of contact sites are connected to a specific set of cytoskeletal filaments. Specifically, the junctional proteins of desmosomes and hemidesmosomes are connected to intermediate filaments while adherens and tight junctions are linked with actin microfilaments.</p><p>NF1 refers to type 1 neurofibromatosis syndrome, which has been linked with mutations of the large <italic>NF1</italic> gene [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. The hallmarks of NF1 include caf&#x000e9; au lait pigment spots of the epidermis, skin freckling, cutaneous neurofibromas, and Lisch nodules of the iris [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. Other findings often associated with NF1 include learning disabilities, varying osseous dysplasias, optic pathway gliomas and predisposition to malignancies. Molecular cloning of the entire coding sequence of the <italic>NF1</italic> gene and subsequent analysis of the corresponding peptide sequence has lead to recognition of NF1 protein (neurofibromin) as a regulator of ras, or p21rasGAP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. NF1 protein regulates the levels of biologically active ras-GTP. Ras activity is associated with the regulation of cell growth and differentiation, including control of cytoskeletal organization and formation of cell-cell junctions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. The NF1 protein has been referred to as a tumor suppressor as cells of malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors of neurofibromatosis patients may display loss of heterozygosity of the <italic>NF1</italic> gene [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. In addition, somatic mutations of <italic>NF1</italic> gene have also been found in colon adenocarcinoma, myelodysplastic syndrome, and anaplastic astrocytoma tissues of otherwise healthy persons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. Furthermore, the levels of NF1 protein and/or mRNA have been reported to be altered in certain proliferative diseases, such as transitional cell carcinoma, basal cell carcinoma, astrocytoma, pheochromocytoma, meningioma, and psoriasis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>].</p><p>Several studies implicate that NF1 protein has a crucial role during the development. Mice carrying a homozygous null mutation at the <italic>NF1</italic> locus die <italic>in utero</italic> apparently due to the severe malformations in heart [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. Unlike in adult tissues, NF1 protein is ubiquitously expressed during the development. The expression level and pattern of NF1 protein have been noted to change markedly and rapidly during the development in mice and men [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. These rapid changes have been considered to be related to some of the major morphological changes occurring in tissues e.g. heart [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>].</p><p>In order to reveal the functions of NF1 protein at the molecular level, interactions of the NF1 protein with cytoskeletal and plasma membrane components have been studied. Recent keratinocyte culture studies have demonstrated that the NF1 tumor suppressor factor forms a high affinity association with cytokeratin 14 during the short period when the formation of desmosomes and hemidesmosomes takes place [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. NF1 protein becomes rapidly associated with intermediate filament cytoskeleton (cytokeratin 14), desmoplakin, and &#x003b2;4 integrin, when cultured human keratinocytes are induced to differentiate and form cell-cell junctions by increasing Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration of the cell culture medium. On the other hand, Li <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>] have demonstrated differential localization of the <italic>NF1</italic> gene product with the F-actin or microtubule cytoskeleton during the differentiation of telencephalic neurons. Furthermore, Hsueh <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>] have demonstrated that NF1 tumor suppressor can form a bipartite interaction with transmembrane proteoglycans syndecans 1&#x02013;4.</p><p>The purpose of the present study was to investigate the interactions of NF1 protein with cytoskeleton during the morphogenesis of human epidermis. Developing epidermis provided a unique opportunity to visualize cytoskeletal and junctional proteins together with NF1 protein <italic>in vivo</italic>. The results indicated interaction of NF1 protein with cytokeratin 14 during the polarization of basal cells and the maturation of intercellular junctions.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Tissue samples and keratinocyte cell cultures</title><p>Skin samples from 15 normal fetuses aged 8, 10, 10, 11, 12, 12, 13, 13, 14, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18 and 21 gestational weeks were obtained from the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, University Hospital of Turku, Finland. A sample of neonatal skin was obtained from the Department of Pathology, University of Turku, Finland. Adult skin samples were obtained from plastic surgical operations carried out for cosmetic reasons from healthy persons at the University Hospital of Turku, Finland. All the tissue samples were obtained with the appropriate approval of the Joint Ethical Committee of the University Hospital of Turku and the University of Turku, Finland. The tissue samples were used for the following experiments.

The dilution used for indirect immunofluorescence varied from 1:10 in neonatal and adult skin to 1:500 in fetal samples. Other antibodies specific for NF1 protein were the affinity-purified polyclonal NF1ab67 recognizing a peptide sequence encoded by exon 23a and the polyclonal antiserum NF1as159 recognizing a peptide sequence at the carboxyterminal end of NF1 protein.

After electrophoresis, proteins were transferred to Immobilon-P filter (Millipore Corporation, Bedford, MA) and immunolabeled with NF1GRP(D) antibody at the dilution of 1:1000. Peroxidase-linked donkey-anti-rabbit (NA 934) (Amersham International plc, Little Chalfont, Buckinghampshire, England) was used as secondary antibody at the dilution of 1:10 000. Proteins were detected with ECL (Amersham Life Sciences, Little Chalfont, England) and the filter was exposed to autoradiographic film (Eastman Kodak, New York, NY).</p></sec><sec><title>Co-immunoprecipitation</title><p>Cultured keratinocytes were extracted with CB-buffer (Coimmunoprecipitation buffer: 20 mM Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 0.5% Igepal CA-630, and Complete, Mini, EDTA-free Protease Inhibitors Cocktail Tablets, Boehringer Mannheim) and the protein concentrations of soluble fraction were detected with DC Protein Assay (Bio-Rad Laboratories). 650 &#x003bc;g of the cell lysate was used for the coimmunoprecipitation. The lysate was first precleared with 50 &#x003bc;l of G-sepharose (Boehringer Mannheim) for 3 h and centrifuged. 10 &#x003bc;l of antibody for syndecan-1 (0.1 mg/ml) was added to the supernatant and incubated for 1 h. 50 &#x003bc;l of G-sepharose was added and further incubated for 12 h. The lysate was centrifuged and the pellet was washed with CB-buffer for four times. Precipitated proteins were separated from the sepharose by adding Laemmli buffer and boiling the sample for 4 min. After centrifugation, the supernatant was loaded on SDS polyacrylamide gel, electrophoresed, transferred to Immobilon-P filter, immunolabeled with NF1GRP(D), and detected with ECL as described above with Western blotting.</p></sec><sec><title>Indirect immunofluorescence and confocal laser scanning microscopy</title><p>Indirect immunofluorescence labeling of frozen fetal, neonatal, and adult skin sections and confocal laser scanning microscopy of these labelings were performed as described earlier by Pummi <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Frozen sections of fetal, neonatal and adult skin were cut on silanated glass slides. Samples were fixed with 100% methyl alcohol and preincubated in PBS supplemented with 1% bovine serum albumin (BSA). The primary antibodies were diluted in 1% BSA-PBS, and incubated on the samples at 4&#x000b0;C for 20 h. After several washes in PBS, the slides were incubated with secondary antibodies at 20&#x000b0;C for 1 h. The samples were washed in PBS and mounted with Glycergel (Dako, Glostrup, Denmark). The secondary antibody used for indirect immunofluorescence was tetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanate (TRITC) conjugated swine anti-rabbit IgG (R0156, Dako A/S). In double labelings, TRITC-conjugated swine anti-rabbit IgG was mixed with fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-conjugated F(ab')<sub>2</sub> fragment of goat anti-mouse immunoglobulins (F0479, Dako A/S) or Alexa Fluor&#x02122; 488 conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR).

At 13 weeks EGA, cytokeratin 14 antibody labeled cytoskeletal intermediate filaments of the basal cells (Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5A</xref>:a,d). Some labeling was also noted in the periderm. Immunosignals for the NF1 protein and cytokeratin 14 showed marked colocalization on many locations in basal cells (Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5A</xref>:a,d). Actin antibody labeled the peripheral cytoplasm of all epidermal and periderm cells (Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5A</xref>:b,e). As the NF1 protein positive fibrils were located closer to the nuclei and actin labeling was detected more peripherally, these two components showed separate labeling (Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5A</xref>:b,e). &#x003b1;-tubulin antibody labeled also all epidermal cell layers, but did not colocalize with NF1 protein (Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5A</xref>:c,f).</p><p>In order to evaluate the spatial relationship of NF1 positive cytokeratin fibrils with desmosomes and hemidesmosomes, double immunolabelings of NF1 protein with desmosomal and hemidesmosomal marker proteins were carried out. At 13 weeks EGA, desmoplakin, a desmosomal cytoplasmic plaque protein, was present in a typical punctuate pattern at the cell-cell junction sites in all cell layers (Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5B</xref>:a). However, the intercellular junction sites of basal cells showed weaker labeling for desmoplakin. Higher magnification revealed that NF1 positive cytokeratin fibrils terminated to dots of desmoplakin (Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5B</xref>:c). Antibody for &#x003b2;4 integrin, a transmembrane component of hemidesmosomes, labeled the basal aspects of the basal cells as distinct dots (Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5B</xref>:b,d). Higher magnification revealed that NF1 positive cytokeratin fibrils were directed towards the &#x003b2;4 integrin dots (Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5B</xref>:d). By 16 weeks EGA, labeling of &#x003b2;4 integrin was intensified and changed into a more linear labeling pattern (not shown).</p><p>The localization of NF1 protein and selected adherens junction proteins were investigated using double immunolabelings in developing epidermis at 13 weeks EGA. E-cadherin antibody revealed the cell-cell junction sites of the basal and intermediate cells (Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5C</xref>:a), but high magnification showed that the immunosignals for E-cadherin and NF1 protein were not colocalized (Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5C</xref>:d). Also, &#x003b1;-actinin and NF1 protein were mutually exclusive (Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5C</xref>:b,e). &#x003b2;1 integrin labeled the cell membranes of the basal cells, including the basal aspect of basal cells (Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5C</xref>:c). Higher magnification showed that NF1 protein positive fibrils were terminating between the &#x003b2;1 integrin labeling at cell-cell junction sites (Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5C</xref>:f).

[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>] demonstrated interaction of NF1 protein and syndecans 1&#x02013;4. To evaluate whether these proteins were in close contact in keratinocytes, double immunolabeling was performed. In developing epidermis at 14 weeks EGA, syndecan-1 was localized to the plasma membrane of keratinocytes in all epidermal layers (Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6a</xref>). Potential colocalization or close spatial relationship of syndecan-1 with NF1 protein was noted on some basal cells (Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6a,6c</xref>). However, in adult epidermis, immunosignals for the NF1 protein and syndecan-1 were entirely separate (Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6b,6d</xref>). Immunoprecipitation of keratinocyte culture lysates with syndecan-1 specific antibody and subsequent western analysis with NF1GRP(D) antibody demonstrated that syndecan-1 was connected to a small fraction of NF1 protein (Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="F6"><label>Figure 6</label><caption><p>Double immunolabeling and CLSM analysis of developing and adult epidermis for NF1 protein and syndecan-1.

This emphasizes that the <italic>NF1</italic> gene is developmentally regulated also in human skin. These findings also strengthen the view that the large NF1 protein exerts its functions through multiple molecular interactions. Specifically, NF1 tumor suppressor factor associates and functions with proteins located with the plasma membrane (p21ras, syndecans), or with cytoskeletal components associated with selected cellular junctions (desmosomes, hemidesmosomes) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. The action of NF1 protein may be analogous to e.g. fatty acid synthase, which conducts its tasks using different sites of the same molecule. It should also be noted that the activity of ras is associated with the regulation of cell growth and differentiation, including control of cytoskeletal organization and formation of cell-cell junctions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>].</p><p>Western transfer analysis, immunolocalization and <italic>in situ</italic> hybridization showed that the <italic>NF1</italic> gene was abundantly expressed in developing human epidermis. In contrast to adult epidermis, fetal basal cells displayed a fibrillar labeling pattern for NF1 protein between 8 and 14 weeks EGA. Later during the development, the fibrillar labeling of basal cells changed into a more diffuse cytoplasmic pattern. The fibrillar labeling pattern suggested that the NF1 protein was associated with cytoskeleton. Double immunolabelings demonstrated a relatively high degree of colocalization of NF1 protein and cytokeratin 14 at light microscopic level, and immunoelectron microscopy located NF1 protein on perinuclear keratin bundles. In developing human epidermis, NF1 protein did not show detectable association with actin microfilaments or tubulin, although in other studies and conditions, NF1 protein has been shown to interact with these cytoskeletal components [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>].</p><p>Concomitantly with the association of NF1 protein to the cytokeratin, the epidermis undergoes profound changes: the stratification of epidermis, maturation of basement membrane zone, and the formation of desmosomes and hemidesmosomes is activated. At 9&#x02013;16 weeks EGA, keratin filaments become more prominent, and the number of desmosomes increase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. First hemidesmosomes have been noted at ~9 weeks EGA. Between 9 and 15 weeks EGA the number of hemidesmosomes increases by about fourfold, and the morphology of hemidesmosomes matures simultaneously with increased contact with intermediate keratin filaments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. NF1 protein was detected also near the desmosomes and hemidesmosomes as indicated by both immunoelectron microscopy and double immunolabeling of NF1 protein with desmoplakin and &#x003b2;4 integrin. These <italic>in vivo</italic> observations are in good agreement with the earlier <italic>in vitro</italic> study by Koivunen <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. They showed the association of NF1 protein with CK14-containing keratin intermediate filaments during the formation of desmosomes in cultured human keratinocytes. The present study demonstrates a similar association of NF1 protein and intermediate filaments during the formation of intercellular junctions <italic>in vivo</italic>. Developing epidermis thus provides a good model to study differentiation of keratinocytes <italic>in vivo</italic>, since the interactions of various cytoskeletal and junction proteins can be readily visualized.</p><p>The finding that NF1 specific antibodies raised against different peptide segments of the protein results in different labeling is in agreement with earlier studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. Specifically, NF1GRP(D) antibody labeled most intensely the basal cells, while other antibodies used, NF1ab67 and NF1as159, labeled all the developing cell layers indicating that NF1 protein is present in the intermediate cell layers, too. One plausible explanation is that NF1GRP(D) antibody may recognize only a specific type of NF1 protein conformation.</p><p>Expression of NF1 mRNA was studied at 13 and 18 weeks EGA using <italic>in situ</italic> hybridization. At 13 weeks, the localization of NF1 mRNA corresponded with the immunosignal for the NF1 protein. However, at 18 weeks, NF1 mRNA and protein displayed differential spatial distribution within the epidermis. Specifically, NF1 mRNA was detected in the suprabasal cells but not in the basal layer. Although NF1 protein remained detectable in the basal cells at 18 weeks EGA, the labeling pattern for NF1 protein in the basal cells had changed to a more diffuse cytoplasmic staining. It is thus possible that the more diffuse localization of NF1 protein in the basal cells is associated with downregulation of the NF1 mRNA level. These results are in concordance with previous studies detecting NF1 mRNA in suprabasal cell layers in late developing rat epidermis while basal cells contained no detectable NF1 mRNA at this stage of rat epidermal development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>].</p><p>NF1 mRNA was intracellularly distributed to the basal aspects of the basal cells and to the cell peripheries of intermediate cells at 13 weeks EGA. These are the sites where desmosome and hemidesmosome formation takes place during this stage of development. Previously, Yl&#x000e4;-Outinen <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>] have shown that NF1 mRNA is targeted to cell-cell contact zone in cultured human keratinocytes when they are induced to differentiate. This might be true also <italic>in vivo</italic>, since NF1 mRNA was accounted at cell-cell and cell-basement membrane contact zones.</p><p>Periderm cells showed profound changes in the expression pattern of NF1 protein. Our study revealed that, at 8 weeks EGA, when the desmosome formation is active in the periderm, the periderm cells showed fibrillar labeling for NF1 protein. By the 11th week of EGA, labeling for NF1 protein revealed a more diffuse pattern in the periderm cells, diminished thereafter, and disappeared by the 16th week EGA. This correlates with the cessation of periderm cell proliferation at about 12 weeks EGA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>] and disruption of intermediate keratin filaments at 15&#x02013;17 weeks EGA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. After the periderm cells cease dividing, they synthesize little if any protein and are gradually shed into the amniotic fluid by the end of the third trimester [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. The expression of NF1 protein in the periderm thus correlates well with the periderm cell proliferation and cell junction forming activity. This is also in concordance with previous study on developing rat skin demonstrating NF1 protein first in the basal and periderm cells, but later mostly in the spinous cell layer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>].</p><p>Even though a bipartite interaction between transmembrane syndecans and NF1 protein has been characterized in neurons by two hybrid method [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>], the results of the present study demonstrated only little of potential colocalization of NF1 protein and syndecan-1 in epidermal keratinocytes during the development and in adult. Thus, the conditions when NF1 protein and syndecans may interact, and the cell biological significance of this interaction remain to be elucidated.</p></sec><sec><title>List of abbreviations</title><p>BSA, Bovine serum albumin; CLSM, confocal laser scanning microscopy; EGA, estimated gestational age; GAP, G-protein activating protein; NF1, type 1 neurofibromatosis; PBS, phosphate buffered saline; SDS, sodium dodecyl sulphate.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>None declared.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' Contributions</title><p>MM carried out the Western transfer analysis, indirect immunofluorescence labelings, confocal laser scanning microscopy, immunoelectron microscopy, and avidin-biotin immunolabelings.
