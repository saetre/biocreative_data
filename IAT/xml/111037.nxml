Some 30 <italic>Sox</italic> genes have been identified in mammals and orthologues have been found in a wide range of other metazoans. <italic>Sox</italic> genes are highly conserved and are known to play important roles in embryonic development, including roles in gonadal, central nervous system, neural crest and skeletal development. Several <italic>SOX</italic> genes have been implicated in human congenital diseases. We report here the isolation of <italic>Sox8</italic> and its characterisation in mice and humans. This gene has a remarkably similar primary structure and genomic organisation to the campomelic dysplasia gene <italic>SOX9</italic> and the Waardenburg&#x02013;Shah syndrome gene <italic>SOX10</italic>. SOX8 protein is able to bind to canonical SOX target DNA sequences and activate transcription <italic>in vitro</italic> through two separate <italic>trans</italic>-activation regions.

SOX proteins are characterised by a highly conserved DNA-binding and bending domain, known as an HMG box due to its amino acid similarity to the DNA-binding domain of the high mobility group (HMG) proteins. Two main groups exist within the HMG superfamily, the HMG&#x0002f;UBF group and the TCF&#x0002f;MATA&#x0002f;SOX group. HMG&#x0002f;UBF proteins, including non-histone proteins such as HMG-1 and HMG-2, contain at least one HMG box, bind DNA non-specifically and are usually associated with organising chromatin structure. The TCF&#x0002f;MATA&#x0002f;SOX group on the other hand contains the transcription factors TCF1 and LEF1, the yeast mating type protein MATA1 and SOX proteins. Members of this group bind DNA sequence specifically and contain a single HMG box (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd245c2">2</xref>).</p><p><italic>Sox</italic> genes are predominantly expressed during embryogenesis and have been implicated in many developmental processes and human congenital diseases. <italic>Sox9</italic>, for example, is widely expressed in the developing embryo and is involved in skeletogenesis, brain development and sex determination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd245c3">3</xref>). Mutations in <italic>SOX9</italic> are responsible for the human congenital disease campomelic dysplasia, characterised by a variety of skeletal dysgeneses and, in the majority of XY cases, partial or complete sex reversal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd245c4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd245c5">5</xref>). In contrast, <italic>Sox10</italic> expression is associated with neural crest cells in the embryo and defects in <italic>Sox10</italic> underlie the <italic>Dom</italic> (dominant megacolon) mouse mutant and the human neurocristopathy Waardenburg&#x02013;Shah syndrome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd245c6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd245c7">7</xref>). The <italic>Sox</italic> gene family can be divided into eight subfamilies, A&#x02013;H, on the basis of the HMG box amino acid sequence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd245c8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd245c9">9</xref>). These subfamilies appear to represent groups which are derived from common ancestors (for a review see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd245c10">10</xref>). <italic>Sox9</italic> and <italic>Sox10</italic> are members of the same subfamily, group E, and share moderate sequence similarity and conserved functional motifs such as a C-terminal <italic>trans</italic>-activation domain.</p><p>The importance of <italic>Sox9</italic> and <italic>Sox10</italic> in both mouse and human development prompted us to investigate a previously uncharacterised member of group E, <italic>Sox8</italic>. A putative <italic>Sox8</italic> gene, dubbed <italic>SoxP1</italic>, was identified in rainbow trout by Ito and co-workers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd245c11">11</xref>), but very little is known about its function, expression or whether it is a genuine orthologue of mouse <italic>Sox8</italic>, hitherto known only as a PCR fragment of the HMG box region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd245c8">8</xref>). Here we present the sequence, genomic structure and chromosomal localisation of both mouse and human <italic>Sox8</italic> and note a striking similarity in sequence and genomic organisation to <italic>Sox9</italic> and <italic>Sox10</italic>. We show that SOX8 protein is able to bind sequence specifically to DNA and is able to activate transcription, suggesting that SOX8 acts as a modular transcription factor. The expression pattern of <italic>Sox8</italic> during mouse development, together with its location on human chromosome 16p13.3, implicate <italic>SOX8</italic> in the aetiology of the &#x003b1;-thalassemia deletion variant ATR-16, characterised by haematological abnormalities, mental retardation and craniofacial defects.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Isolation of genomic and cDNA clones</title><p>cDNA clones were obtained from an 11.5 days post coitum (d.p.c.) whole embryo cDNA library in &#x003bb;GT10 (Stratagene), using a partial HMG box probe of mouse <italic>Sox8</italic> (nucleotides 1321&#x02013;1496, GenBank accession no.

Primary screening revealed two identical cDNA clones that spanned nucleotides 843&#x02013;1507 (GenBank accession no. AF191325). These clones overlapped with an EST clone spanning nucleotides 1&#x02013;1171, the sequence of which concurred with those of the cDNA clones. The genomic library yielded a single clone of 14 kb from which the remainder of the open reading frame sequence was derived. Comparison of cDNA and genomic sequences, together with RT&#x02013;PCR analysis, revealed the intron&#x02013;exon boundaries, translation stop codon and putative translation initiation codon, which was preceded by an in-frame stop codon (nucleotide 1083). The deduced protein product of mouse <italic>Sox8</italic> is 464 amino acids in length (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd245f1">1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd245f2">2</xref>A and C).</p><p>A search of the NCBI high throughput genomic sequence database yielded a sequence identified as human <italic>SOX8</italic> on the basis of 100&#x00025; amino acid sequence identity in the HMG box region. The amino acid sequence of human SOX8 shows 84.1&#x00025; identity (91.4&#x00025; similarity) overall with mouse SOX8 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd245f1">1</xref>). The open reading frame of human <italic>SOX8</italic> is 1341 bp (producing a putative 447 amino acid protein), with intron&#x02013;exon boundaries in the same positions as in mouse <italic>Sox8</italic>. The mouse protein also showed 81.6&#x00025; similarity (72.4&#x00025; identity) with the previously published trout sequence, SOXP1 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd245f1">1</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd245c11">11</xref>), suggesting that <italic>tr-SoxP1</italic> is orthologous to <italic>Sox8</italic>.</p><p>The genomic organisation of <italic>Sox8</italic> was found to be remarkably similar to that of the other group E <italic>Sox</italic> genes <italic>Sox9</italic> and <italic>Sox10</italic>. All are comprised of three exons of similar size and two introns in exactly cognate positions (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd245f2">2</xref>A). Within this group, SOX9 and SOX10 are most similar, with 57.6&#x00025; amino acid identity (&#x0003e;72&#x00025; amino acid similarity), while SOX8 has a greater similarity to SOX9 (53.3&#x00025; identity) than to SOX10 (49.7&#x00025; identity) on the basis of amino acid sequence alone (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd245f2">2</xref>B). Comparison of the three protein sequences revealed, in addition to the highly conserved HMG box, two highly conserved regions flanking the HMG box and a less well conserved region at the C-terminus (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd245f2">2</xref>A and C).</p></sec><sec><title>DNA binding and transcriptional <italic>trans</italic>-activation by SOX8 protein</title><p>SOX proteins studied to date are characterised by the ability to bind to the core DNA sequence motifs AACAAT and AACAAAG or minor variants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd245c9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd245c17">17</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd245c21">21</xref>). We therefore wished to determine whether SOX8 is able to bind these sequences, which we have termed SryC and SoCM, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd245c21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd245c22">22</xref>). <italic>In vitro</italic> transcription&#x0002f;translation followed by EMSA (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd245f3">3</xref>A) demonstrated that full-length native mouse SOX8 is able to bind both oligonucleotides in the presence or absence of the non-specific competitor poly(dI&#x000b7;dC) (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd245f3">3</xref>A, lanes 1&#x02013;4). Furthermore, addition of the same unlabelled oligonucleotide abolished binding (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd245f3">3</xref>A, lanes 5 and 6). A higher affinity of SOX8 for the SoCM oligonucleotide (AACAAAG) was confirmed by cross-competition experiments in which equimolar and twice molar amounts of unlabelled SryC were competed off by the addition of labelled SoCM (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd245f3">3</xref>A, lanes 7 and 8).</p><p>The two closest relatives of SOX8, namely SOX9 and SOX10, each contain transcriptional <italic>trans</italic>-activation domains at their C-termini (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd245c21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd245c23">23</xref>). We tested the ability of SOX8 to activate transcription by co-transfecting GAL4&#x02013;SOX8 fusion constructs and a Gal4UAS&#x02013;luciferase reporter construct into COS1 cells and assaying the resultant luciferase reporter levels. All constructs lacked the DNA-binding HMG box as it is known to interfere with the activation assay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd245c22">22</xref>). Western analysis confirmed that all GAL constructs were expressed equally (data not shown). Amino acids 176&#x02013;464 of SOX8 were able to <italic>trans</italic>-activate transcription some 30-fold relative to GAL0 alone (vector containing no <italic>Sox8</italic> fragment, Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd245f3">3</xref>B). Nested deletions of this region showed reduced <italic>trans</italic>-activation. A region comprising the 174 amino acids immediately C-terminal of the HMG box showed a 10-fold increase in <italic>trans</italic>-activation compared with GAL0.

At 13.5 d.p.c. male-specific expression in the gonads, associated with testis cords (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd245f4">4</xref>E), and expression in the forebrain, midbrain, hindbrain and spinal cord, as well as the pharyngeal region and tongue, was observed (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd245f4">4</xref>F). Expression in the kidneys at 13.5 d.p.c. (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd245f4">4</xref>G) was observed at the tips of the ureteric trees. Strong <italic>Sox8</italic> expression was also apparent in the ventral nasal region of 9.5 d.p.c. embryos (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd245f4">4</xref>H). These <italic>in situ</italic> data confirmed and extended the expression profile determined by RT&#x02013;PCR.</p></sec><sec><title>Chromosomal localisation of mouse and human <italic>SOX8</italic></title><p><italic>Sox8</italic> was mapped in mice using the EUCIB interspecific backcross, exploiting an 18 bp difference in the first intron between <italic>M.musculus</italic> and <italic>M.spretus</italic>. Recombination and haplotype analysis of 83 mice (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd245f5">5</xref>A) revealed a location on proximal mouse chromosome 17, 5.8 &#x000b1; 3.2 cM from the anonymous marker D17Mit25 and 29.1 &#x000b1; 6.3 cM from D17Mit9. <italic>Sox8</italic> co-segregated with two other markers, D17Mit55 and D17Mit43, placing it within the t complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd245c26">26</xref>), a 20 cM region notable for several inversions and deletions and transmission ratio distortion (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd245f5">5</xref>B). Further confirmation of the location of <italic>Sox8</italic> was achieved by physically mapping <italic>Sox8</italic> on two yeast artificial chromosomes, 156-B5 and 240-D4, known to span this region of the t complex (UK-HGMP, http:&#x0002f;&#x0002f;www.menu.hgmp.mrc.ac.uk&#x0002f; ).</p><p>Human <italic>SOX8</italic> was mapped by typing 89 DNAs from the Genebridge4 radiation hybrid panel. This analysis revealed that <italic>SOX8</italic> is located on chromosome 16, within 5 cM of the telomere of 16p, in band 16p13.3 between the marker loci D16S521 and D16S3024 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd245f5">5</xref>B). This is a region of conserved synteny with the t complex region on mouse chromosome 17 where <italic>Sox8</italic> was localised, further confirming our mapping results.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>Despite the number and diversity of mammalian <italic>Sox</italic> genes, certain structural themes have emerged within each of the eight subfamilies, groups A&#x02013;H, described to date (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd245c1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd245c9">9</xref>). For example, group D <italic>Sox</italic> genes (<italic>Sox5</italic>, <italic>Sox6</italic>, <italic>Sox13</italic> and <italic>Sox23</italic>) all contain leucine zippers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd245c27">27</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd245c30">30</xref>), while the members of group C (<italic>Sox4</italic>, <italic>Sox11</italic>, <italic>Sox22</italic> and <italic>Sox24</italic>) encode highly conserved N- and C-terminal amino acid sequences and group G <italic>Sox</italic> genes (<italic>Sox15</italic> and <italic>Sox20</italic>) encode proteins with a common proline&#x0002f;glutamine&#x0002f;serine-rich region at the C-terminus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd245c1">1</xref>). In the case of group B, comprising <italic>Sox1</italic>, <italic>Sox2</italic>, <italic>Sox3</italic>, <italic>Sox14</italic>, <italic>Sox19</italic> and <italic>Sox21</italic>, some functional similarity is also apparent since all are involved in neural development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd245c1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd245c31">31</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd245c36">36</xref>).</p><p>In this report we describe the third member of <italic>Sox</italic> group E, <italic>Sox8</italic>, in mice and humans. This gene shares a common genomic organisation with the two other group E genes <italic>Sox9</italic> and <italic>Sox10</italic>, with the positions of the two introns absolutely conserved. Furthermore, the intron&#x02013;exon boundaries differ from those in other intron-containing <italic>Sox</italic> groups (group D, <italic>Sox5</italic>, <italic>Sox6</italic>, <italic>Sox13</italic> and <italic>Sox23</italic>; group F, <italic>Sox7</italic>, <italic>Sox17</italic> and <italic>Sox18</italic>), providing further evidence for a common evolutionary ancestor for group E <italic>Sox</italic> genes and likely also for each of the <italic>Sox</italic> subfamilies. It will be of interest to determine whether a gene with similar sequence and genomic organisation exists in simpler organisms that may represent the postulated progenitor of group E <italic>Sox</italic> genes in vertebrates.</p><p>Group E <italic>Sox</italic> genes are also conserved at the sequence level, encoding proteins with several conserved regions that may be functionally important. Two regions are particularly highly conserved, a 35 amino acid hydrophobic region N-terminal to the HMG box and a 19 amino acid hydrophilic region C-terminal to the HMG box. These regions may provide additional sequence-specific DNA-binding or -bending properties, which in turn may allow specific interaction with other components of the transcriptional machinery. Alternatively, they may be directly involved in protein&#x02013;protein binding with associated cofactors.</p><p>Several SOX proteins are modular transcription factors, with separable DNA-binding and transcriptional <italic>trans</italic>-activation domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd245c21">21</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd245c24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd245c36">36</xref>). We have demonstrated that mouse SOX8 binds the SOX consensus motif (A&#x0002f;T)(A&#x0002f;T)CAA(A&#x0002f;T)G and is able to <italic>trans</italic>-activate transcription in cultured cells. While SOX9 and SOX10 have strong <italic>trans</italic>-activation domains at their C-termini (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd245c21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd245c23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd245c24">24</xref>), the C-terminus of SOX8 activated transcription only weakly. However, we identified a second, more potent <italic>trans</italic>-activation region in SOX8 (amino acids 176&#x02013;349) that activates transcription 10-fold above GAL0. The two regions together appear to act synergistically to give a combined level of <italic>trans</italic>-activation some 30-fold above GAL0. It will be important to determine whether both regions are required in native SOX8 <italic>in vivo.</italic> McDowall <italic>et al</italic>. (37) have described a second <italic>trans</italic>-activation domain in SOX9 consisting entirely of proline, glutamine and alanine residues which contributes to the <italic>trans</italic>-activation ability of native SOX9. Curiously, this domain is poorly conserved between species and is completely absent in SOX8. Several SOX proteins, such as SOX9 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd245c38">38</xref>), SOX10 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd245c39">39</xref>) and SOX2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd245c34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd245c40">40</xref>), have been shown to require additional cell-specific cofactors to enhance transcription. If different factors were to associate with the two <italic>trans</italic>-activation regions of SOX8, then tissue-specific expression of these factors during development would represent a new mechanism of transcriptional control by SOX proteins.</p><p>The expression profile of <italic>Sox8</italic> during mouse development suggests roles in central nervous system, limb and facial development. Interestingly, expression in the developing gonads was specific to the testis cords, implicating <italic>Sox8</italic> in male sex determination or differentiation or male germ cell development. To date two other <italic>Sox</italic> genes have been implicated in these processes, namely <italic>Sry</italic>, the mammalian Y-linked testis-determining gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd245c41">41</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd245c43">43</xref>), and <italic>Sox9</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd245c4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd245c5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd245c44">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd245c45">45</xref>). During development, <italic>Sox8</italic> is co-expressed in some regions with either <italic>Sox9</italic> or <italic>Sox10</italic>, for example in the testis cords, kidneys and dorsal root ganglia. Whether this represents <italic>Sox</italic> gene complementation or some degree of functional redundancy, as suggested for <italic>Sox5</italic> and <italic>Sox6</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd245c27">27</xref>) and <italic>Sox1</italic>, <italic>Sox2</italic> and <italic>Sox3</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd245c33">33</xref>), is still unclear.</p><p>Mouse <italic>Sox8</italic> was mapped to chromosome 17, specifically within the t complex. The t complex is a 20 cM region characterised by four non-overlapping inversions which are maintained on a wild-type background by transmission ratio distortion, whereby heterozygous males pass on a copy of the t complex to the next generation at a rate of greater than 90&#x00025;. The mechanism by which this is achieved is still unclear, but is believed to involve specific sperm&#x02013;egg donor&#x02013;acceptor interactions (for a review see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd245c26">26</xref>). Another characteristic of the t complex is the accumulation of several t complex-associated mutants, two of which, <italic>t</italic><italic><sup>w18</sup></italic> and <italic>t</italic><italic><sup>h20</sup></italic>, are located near <italic>Sox8</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd245c46">46</xref>). The <italic>t</italic><italic><sup>w18</sup></italic> mutant has been shown to contain a deletion in the region of <italic>Sox8</italic> and a duplication at the distal end of the t complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd245c26">26</xref>). Homozygous <italic>t</italic><italic><sup>w18</sup></italic> embryos die prior to organogenesis and develop abnormalities after formation of the primitive streak. Snow and Bennett observed abnormalities in mesoderm cell migration, an apparent block in mitosis and abnormalities in the plane of cell division in <italic>t</italic><italic><sup>w18</sup></italic> homozygotes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd245c47">47</xref>). The <italic>t</italic><italic><sup>h20</sup></italic> mutant is a recessive T-related deletion encompassing the <italic>tufted</italic> locus (<italic>tf</italic>) and the nearby <italic>Ki</italic> and <italic>Hba-ps4</italic> loci (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd245c48">48</xref>), showing not only the abnormal hair phenotype of the <italic>tf</italic> mutant but also reduced fertility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd245c48">48</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd245c49">49</xref>). It will be of interest to determine whether <italic>Sox8</italic> is deleted in either of these mutants.</p><p>Human <italic>SOX8</italic> was mapped near the telomere of chromosome 16p, a region of conserved synteny with mouse proximal chromosome 17. This region is rich in disease loci (Online Inheritance in Man, http:&#x0002f;&#x0002f;www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov&#x0002f;Omim&#x0002f; ), however, the genes responsible for all but two of these have been identified. One disease for which no gene has been identified is CATM, involving microphthalmia and congenital cataract. <italic>SOX8</italic> is expressed weakly in the developing eye and remains a candidate gene for this disease. However, it is difficult to envisage mutations in this gene affecting only the eye, given the broad developmental profile of expression revealed by our study. The other disease for which there is no known gene candidate is haemoglobin H-related mental retardation, also known as ATR-16, which is a complex syndrome involving mild &#x003b1;-thalassemia associated with facial malformation and mental retardation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd245c50">50</xref>). ATR-16 is caused by deletion of a portion of the distal short arm of chromosome 16, with four different breakpoints identified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd245c50">50</xref>). The symptoms have been ascribed to the deletion of one to four of the &#x003b1;-globin genes, together with deletion of another unknown gene(s) within this region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd245c50">50</xref>). The expression of <italic>Sox8</italic> in the brain and spinal cord of developing mice, along with strong expression in the first and second branchial arches and nasal invaginations, is consistent with an involvement in this disease. However, since this syndrome is always associated with large deletions, it will not be possible to firmly identify <italic>SOX8</italic> as the gene responsible for ATR-16 by analysis of patient DNA. Targeted inactivation of <italic>Sox8</italic> in mice will be required to reveal the phenotypic consequences of <italic>Sox8</italic> mutation.</p></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="display-objects"><title>Figures and Tables</title><fig id="gkd245f1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p> Structure and conservation of SOX8.
