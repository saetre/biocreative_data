It is a mainly a water-borne contaminant. Inorganic trivalent arsenic (As<sup>III</sup>) is one of the major species that exists environmentally. The transport of As<sup>III </sup>has been studied in microbes, plants and mammals. Members of the aquaglyceroporin family have been shown to actively conduct As<sup>III </sup>and its organic metabolite, monomethylarsenite (MAs<sup>III</sup>). However, the transport of As<sup>III </sup>and MAs<sup>III </sup>in in any fish species has not been characterized.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>In this study, five members of the aquaglyceroporin family from zebrafish (<italic>Danio rerio</italic>) were cloned, and their ability to transport water, glycerol, and trivalent arsenicals (As<sup>III </sup>and MAs<sup>III</sup>) and antimonite (Sb<sup>III</sup>) was investigated. Genes for at least seven aquaglyceroporins have been annotated in the zebrafish genome project. Here, five genes which are close homologues to human AQP3, AQP9 and AQP10 were cloned from a zebrafish cDNA preparation. These genes were named <italic>aqp3, aqp3l, aqp9a, aqp9b </italic>and <italic>aqp10 </italic>according to their similarities to the corresponding human AQPs. Expression of <italic>aqp9a, aqp9b</italic>, <italic>aqp3, aqp3l </italic>and <italic>aqp10 </italic>in multiple zebrafish organs were examined by RT-PCR. Our results demonstrated that these aquaglyceroporins exhibited different tissue expression. They are all detected in more than one tissue. The ability of these five aquaglyceroporins to transport water, glycerol and the metalloids arsenic and antimony was examined following expression in oocytes from <italic>Xenopus leavis</italic>. Each of these channels showed substantial glycerol transport at equivalent rates. These aquaglyceroporins also facilitate uptake of inorganic As<sup>III</sup>, MAs<sup>III </sup>and Sb<sup>III</sup>. Arsenic accumulation in fish larvae and in different tissues from adult zebrafish was studied following short-term arsenic exposure. The results showed that liver is the major organ of arsenic accumulation; other tissues such as gill, eye, heart, intestine muscle and skin also exhibited significant ability to accumulate arsenic. The zebrafish larvae also accumulate considerable amounts of arsenic.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>This is the first molecular identification of fish arsenite transport systems and we propose that the extensive expression of the fish aquaglyceroporins and their ability to transport metalloids suggests that aquaglyceroporins are the major pathways for arsenic accumulation in a variety of zebrafish tissues. Uptake is one important step of arsenic metabolism. Our results will contribute to a new understanding of aquatic arsenic metabolism and will support the use of zebrafish as a new model system to study arsenic associated human diseases.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>Arsenic is a well known environmental toxin and Group A human carcinogen. Humans are exposed to arsenic via a variety of other geochemical and anthropogenic sources, especially drinking water. The two major oxidation states of inorganic arsenic in water are trivalent arsenite (As<sup>III</sup>) and pentavalent arsenate (As<sup>V</sup>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Arsenate is usually reduced to arsenite in the cytosol of cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Usually, in well water and surface water, both As<sup>III</sup>, the more toxic form, and As<sup>V</sup>, the oxidized but less toxic form co-exist at variable ratios [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. Since water is the major source of chronic exposure, most countries limit the upper level of arsenic allowed in drinking water. In the United States, the EPA lowered the maximal containment limit (MCL) from 50 ppb to 10 ppb <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.epa.gov/EPA-WATER/2001/January/Day-22/w1668.htm">http://www.epa.gov/EPA-WATER/2001/January/Day-22/w1668.htm</ext-link>. In Oakland County, Michigan (the location of Oakland University), wells contaminated with arsenic that leaches out of the Marshall Sandstone result in chronic arsenicosis in individuals dependent on those wells (front page of the Detroit Free Press, November 19, 1997; Flint Journal, Feb 14, 2008).</p><p>Aquaporins (AQPs) are integral membrane channel proteins that mediate the bidirectional downhill flux of water and selected small amphipathic molecules across cellular membranes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. Aquaglyceroporins are a subfamily of aquaporins that translocate larger molecules such as glycerol. Inherited mutation of AQPs is associated with multiple physiological disorders [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. In total, twelve human aquaporins have been reported, and four of them, AQP3, AQP7, AQP9 and AQP10, are aquaglyceroporins. These AQPs play important roles in the tissues where they are expressed. For example, AQP7 is an adipose isoform that releases glycerol into the blood stream during lipolysis, while AQP9 is a liver isoform that uptake the glycerol [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. The interplay of these two AQPs is critical for gluconeogenesis during starvation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. In addition to their physiological roles in nutrient transport, aquaglyceroporins have been shown to facilitate uptake of trivalent metalloids arsenite and antimonite because in solution they are trihydroxylated inorganic mimics of glycerol [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. AQPs including <italic>E. coli </italic>GlpF [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>], Yeast FPS1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>], plant Nodulin26-like Intrinsic Proteins (NIPs) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>] and mammalian AQP3, AQP7 and AQP9 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>] were shown to transport arsenite. We have previously demonstrated mammalian AQP9 transports both inorganic As<sup>III</sup>, and its cellular methylation product, MAs<sup>III </sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. Since AQP9 is a bi-directional channel, we have proposed that it mediates both influx of arsenite from blood into liver and efflux of MAs<sup>III </sup>from liver to blood.</p><p>Fish, along with other aquatic organisms, are known to accumulate significant amounts of arsenic as well as other toxic metals such as mercury, copper, cadmium and nickel. For example, feral marine fish usually contain from 1 &#x003bc;g As/g dry mass to more than 10 &#x003bc;g/g dry mass [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. In contrast, the reported levels for terrestrial animals, such as cattle or chickens, are only in the range of 7 - 30 ng As/g dry mass [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. Although there are many studies concerned with general arsenic accumulation and speciation in various types of fish, there have been no mechanistic studies of arsenic detoxification in fish. Since zebrafish is the most studied fish model, in this study, we examined the capacity of zebrafish aquaglyceroporins for metalloid uptake. By querying the zebrafish annotated genome database with the sequence of the human AQP9, seven members of aquaglyceroporins were indentified. These Aqps share high sequence similarity with the corresponding human AQPs. Only one, termed <italic>aqp3</italic>, has been characterized to date [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. In this study, we demonstrate that five zebrafish aquaglyceroporins are functionally expressed in <italic>Xenopus </italic>oocytes and transport water, glycerol and the metalloids As<sup>III</sup>, MAs<sup>III </sup>and trivalent antimonite (Sb<sup>III</sup>). These Aqps are differentially expressed in a variety of zebrafish organs. Thus, the extensive expression of Aqps may account for the accumulation of arsenic in different tissues. The identification of arsenic metabolism pathways in fish is important to understand the arsenic transformation mechanisms in aquatic organisms and to evaluate the safety of fish as a food.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Protein sequence alignment</title><p>The protein sequences were obtained from NCBI.

While in silver sea bream, Aqp3 was detected in gill, kidney, liver, brain, heart, and spleen [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. It appears that the gill and skin are sites where Aqp3 can be found in many types of fish.</p></sec><sec><title>Functional expression of zebrafish aquaglyceroporins in Xenopus oocytes</title><p>Five aquaglyceroporin genes, <italic>aqp9a</italic>, <italic>aqp9b</italic>, <italic>aqp3</italic>, <italic>aqp3l</italic>, and <italic>aqp10</italic>, were cloned using a cDNA library of whole adult zebrafish (a gift from Jeffery Yoder, North Carolina State University).

Inorganic arsenic, including trivalent arsenite and pentavalent arsenate, are often found in natural waters [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. Fish accumulate arsenic through mouth and gills. Since arsenite is more toxic than arsenate, arsenic accumulation was assayed in zebrafish larvae and adult tissues following arsenite exposure. Zebrafish larvae accumulated considerable amounts of arsenic (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>), which is consistent with our observation that larvae express <italic>aqp </italic>genes (data not shown). Adult fish tissues accumulated arsenic in different amounts. As is the case with humans, arsenic accumulates most highly in liver. Arsenic exposed fish had enlarged livers (data not shown), which has been observed also in humans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. Arsenic accumulated in gill, muscle, heart, eye, liver, intestine and skin. Brain is the only organ that exhibited limited ability to accumulate arsenic (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>). It is shown that zebrafish larvae accumulated as much arsenic as adult muscle, demonstrating that these channels which can take up arsenic are expressed early in development.</p><fig id="F6" position="float"><label>Figure 6</label><caption><p><bold>Effect of short-term arsenic exposure on accumulation of arsenic in zebrafish</bold>. After arsenic treatment, organs from adult fish were isolated (n = 6) and homogenized. Totally 10 zebrafish larvae were pooled as one sample (n = 4). Standard deviation is determined by Sigma plot 10.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1471-2199-10-104-6"/></fig></sec></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>It has been previously demonstrated that metalloids, including arsenic, antimony, boron and silicon are transported by microbial, mammalian and plant aquaglyceroporins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. Since arsenic is a major water-borne contaminant, it is reasonable to speculate that fish uptake and accumulate this toxic element. Fish are already known for their high tolerance and accumulation of toxic metals and metalloids [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. These elements are taken up via gills or consumed in the diet. However, the specific molecular mechanisms involved in arsenic accumulation and metabolism are not known. As uptake is the first step in arsenic metabolism, the first question to ask is what transporters are responsible for the observed high levels of arsenic accumulation. Since aquaglyceroporins are known to transport both inorganic arsenite [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>] and organic MAs<sup>III </sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>] in other species, it is logical to investigate the function of aquaglyceroporins in zebrafish. Aquaporins play an important role in water balance in all organisms including aquatic organisms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. Aquaglyceroporins may have additional functions in glycerol metabolism and cold tolerance, as this is the case in other organisms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. In this study, we cloned five zebrafish aquaglyceroporins, <italic>aqp9a, aqp9b, aqp3, aqp3l </italic>and <italic>aqp10</italic>. Their function in water, glycerol and metalloid As<sup>III</sup>, MAs<sup>III </sup>and Sb<sup>III </sup>transport was studied in <italic>Xenopus laevis </italic>oocytes. All five are efficient water/glycerol transporters. In addition, each of these aquaglyceroporins actively conducts metalloid arsenic and antimony transport with one exception that Aqp3 does not transport antimonite. These properties indicate that <italic>aqp9a, aqp9b, aqp3, aqp3l </italic>and <italic>aqp10 </italic>have a unique importance in normal physiological function as well as in toxin metabolism.</p><p>Metalloid transport by human aquaglyceroporins has been well characterized. The liver isoform, AQP9, has a high rate of transport of both As<sup>III </sup>and MAs<sup>III </sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. Intracellular arsenic undergoes a series of oxidative methylations and reductions in many mammals, including humans. These methylations and oxidations are catalyzed by the enzyme AS3MT, an arsenic methyl-transferase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>], and result in the production of the organic mono- and di-methylated arsenic species MAs<sup>III </sup>(monomethylarsonous acid), MAs<sup>V </sup>(monomethylarsonic acid), DMAs<sup>III </sup>(dimethylarsonous acid) and DMAs<sup>V </sup>(dimethylarsonic acid) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. MAs<sup>III </sup>is believed to be an early intermediate in the process of arsenic methylation in liver. It has been proposed that AQP9 facilitates the efflux of MAs<sup>III </sup>which is produced in the liver and transported to the blood and eventually urine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>].</p><p>Similar to humans, multiple zebrafish aquaglyceroporins transport both environmental As<sup>III </sup>and intracellularly generated MAs<sup>III</sup>. This observation provides a basis to position zebrafish as an excellent model organizm to study arsenic-associated diseases. Additionally, the zebrafish model has a number of practical advantages. The zebrafish is a vertebrate with rapid embryonic development and organ differentiation, and its entire genome has been sequenced. As such, the zebrafish fills the gap between microorganisms and mammals. Furthermore, it has a short generation time that allows for statistical analysis of large groups. Many zebrafish genes exhibit high sequence similarity to their human homologues. For example, the zebrafish aquaglyceroporin genes examined in this study are close homologues to aquaglyceroporin genes found in humans. Additionally, the zebrafish fish is native to streams of the Ganges region in eastern India, Pakistan, Bangladesh and Nepal, where the concentrations of arsenic are of the highest in the world. The zebrafish commonly inhabits streams, canals, ditches, ponds, and slow-moving to stagnant water bodies, including rice fields, which are often contaminated with arsenic. It would not be surprising if the zebrafish has adapted to this environmental exposure by expressing arsenic detoxification genes. In this study, we demonstrated that five zebrafish aquaglyceroporins facilitate the uptake of both As<sup>III </sup>and MAs<sup>III</sup>. This is similar to the results found with human AQP9. These five Aqps were shown to have different tissue localizations. This may partially explain why multiple adult organs accumulate large amounts of arsenic. While there is a lack of autopsy data to show the differential arsenic accumulation in human tissues, studies with rats show that after a single oral dose of arsenite, arsenic accumulates primarily in the liver and followed by the kidney [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>].</p><p>With more mechanistic studies of arsenic metabolism in zebrafish, it will be possible to clarify how environmental arsenic is detoxified by aquatic animals. Zebrafish is a promising model to simulate this process in other fish, including multiple commercial fish species such as tilapia, salmon and trout. By examining arsenic metabolism in zebrafish, we will discover valuable information to evaluate the safety of fish that is consumed as a food. With further studies, it may be possible to produce genetically modified zebrafish for use as a bio-monitor to evaluate environmental arsenic contamination.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Our studies demonstrate that five zebrafish aquaglyceroporins actively conduct water and glycerol, which is consistent with functions in osmoregulation. In addition, these five aquaglyceroporins conduct the metalloids arsenic and antimony, which is consistent with the observation that larvae and selected adult organs exhibit significant arsenic accumulation. Our results indicate that zebrafish can become a promising animal model to study arsenic-associated cancers and non-cancer-related diseases.</p></sec><sec><title>Abbreviations</title><p>As<sup>III</sup>: arsenite; As<sup>V</sup>: arsenate; MAs<sup>III</sup>: monomethylarsenite; DMA<sup>III</sup>: dimethylarsenite; DMA<sup>V</sup>: dimethylarsenate; TMAO: trimethylarsine oxide; TMA<sup>III</sup>: trimethylarsine; Aqp/AQP: aquaporin/aquaglyceroporin; ICP-MS: inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer; dpf: days post fertilization; hpf: hours post fertilization; ORF: open reading frame.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>MH carried out the arsenic accumulation study in different zebrafish tissues and the RT-PCR, as well as sequencing of RT-PCR products.
