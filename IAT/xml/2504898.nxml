A transcription factor that is critical to both &#x003b2;-cell development and function is <underline>p</underline>ancreatic-<underline>d</underline>uodenal homeobo<underline>x</underline>-1 (Pdx1,<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7">5</xref> IPF-1 in humans), the first pancreas-enriched gene product expressed in budding epithelium at embryonic day 8.5 (E8.5) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref>). Pdx1 is produced in early pancreatic endocrine, exocrine, and ductal progenitors, and complete loss in humans and mice results in an apancreatic phenotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref>). Later in development, islet &#x003b2; cells can be distinguished from pancreatic exocrine and ductal cells by their high Pdx1 levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref>). In mature pancreas, Pdx1 is principally localized to &#x003b2; cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref>), with specific removal leading to a severe diabetic phenotype due to &#x003b2;-cell dysfunction in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref>). <italic>Pdx1</italic> is also one of few genes associated with an autosomal dominant form of diabetes in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref>) and is viewed as a master regulator of &#x003b2;-cell formation and function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref>).</p><p>Endogenous <italic>Pdx1</italic> expression is predominately controlled by four conserved 5&#x02032;-flanking sequence domains, referred to as Area I (mouse AI, base pairs (bp) -2761/-2457), AII (bp -2153/-1923), AIII (bp -1879/-1600), and AIV (bp -6529/-6047) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref>). AI-III mediates pancreas-specific expression, as early targeted removal of these regions from the endogenous gene profoundly reduces pancreas formation <italic>in vivo</italic>, while leaving <italic>Pdx1</italic> expression in the stomach and duodenum intact (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref>). Several transgenic reporter lines encompassing AI, AII, and AIII have been developed to more precisely define their roles in pancreatic expression. Interactions between AIII and AI/II have been shown to be necessary in the early and broad transcription of <italic>Pdx1</italic> in acinar, endocrine, and ductal progenitors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref>). In contrast, AI and AII cooperate to selectively induce high Pdx1 expression in the insulin<sup>+</sup> cells produced after E13.5 that populate the adult islet (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref>). Notably, AII is the only <italic>Pdx1</italic> control region unique to mammals and capable of independently directing transgenic expression to (a fraction of) islet &#x003b2; cells <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref>).</p><p>Islet &#x003b2;-cell-enriched expression of <italic>Pdx1</italic> appears to be principally regulated by AII, and several key islet transcription factors bind to and activate through conserved <italic>cis</italic>-acting elements in this mammalian-specific control region, including FoxA2, Pax6, MafA, and MafB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">19</xref>). These closely related large Maf proteins are both expressed in &#x003b2; cells during development, with MafA found uniquely in adult islet &#x003b2; cells and only MafB compromising <italic>Pdx1</italic> expression and&#x003b2;-cell formation in knock-out mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">20</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref22">22</xref>). Here we first identified a new conserved MafA and/or MafB binding site in AII. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) analysis then illustrated that MafA binding within AII was highly enriched over AI, AIII, and AIV in islet &#x003b2; cell lines, while transfection-based reporter assays showed that the MafA/MafB binding elements contributed to activation. Both MafA and MafB were bound <italic>in vivo</italic> to Area II in E18.5 pancreata, and AI/AII-driven transgene activity was dramatically reduced during &#x003b2;-cell development in <italic>MafB</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice. Collectively, these data support an essential role for MafA and MafB specifically in AII-mediated activation of <italic>Pdx1</italic> transcription, and highlight the significance of MafB regulation in developing &#x003b2; cells.</p><sec sec-type="methods"><title>EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES</title><p><italic>Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay (EMSA)</italic>&#x02014;&#x003b2;TC3, MIN6, HeLa, and NIH3T3 cell nuclear extracts (NE) were prepared using lysis buffer (100 m<sc>m</sc> Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.5% Igepal CA-630 (Sigma-Aldrich), 2 m<sc>m</sc> sodium orthovanadate, 2 m<sc>m</sc> sodium fluoride, and protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science)), followed by pellet resuspension in nuclear extraction buffer (20 m<sc>m</sc> Hepes, pH 7.9, 400 m<sc>m</sc> NaCl, 1 m<sc>m</sc> EDTA, 1 m<sc>m</sc> EGTA, 1 m<sc>m</sc> dithiothreitol, 1 m<sc>m</sc> phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 m<sc>m</sc> sodium orthovanadate, 2 m<sc>m</sc> sodium fluoride, and protease inhibitor mixture).

EnMafB:pcDNA3.1 expresses a fusion protein of the <italic>Drosophila</italic> Engrailed (En) N-terminal repressor domain (coding sequence for amino acids 1&#x02013;298) and mouse MafB C-terminal DNA binding domain (coding sequence for amino acids 82&#x02013;324). These sequences were cloned into pcDNA3.1 (Invitrogen) along with a DNA fragment encoding an IRES and nuclear EGFP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref25">25</xref>).

Real time PCR analysis was performed on the purified, immunoprecipitated &#x003b2;TC3 DNA using SyBr green PCR master mix (Applied Biosciences) and the ABI Prism 7000. Input DNA was utilized to generate a standard curve, and only reactions with 100 &#x000b1; 20% efficiency (<italic>E</italic> = 10<sup>-1/slope</sup>) were included in the analysis.

Abdominal organs and pancreata were fixed, dehydrated, embedded in paraffin, and 6-&#x003bc;m serial sections were mounted on glass slides for immunohistochemical analysis. The primary antibodies were rabbit &#x003b1;-&#x003b2; galactosidase (1:500; Molecular Probes), guinea pig &#x003b1;-insulin (1:2000, Linco Research, ST Charles, MO), and goat &#x003b1;-Pdx1 (1:10,000, Chris Wright, Vanderbilt University Medical School). The &#x003b2;-gal signal was enhanced with biotin-conjugated &#x003b1;-rabbit (1:500, Jackson ImmunoResearch, West Grove, PA) and Cy5-conjugated streptavidin (1:1000 Jackson ImmunoResearch).

Upon examination of these sequences, Block 2 (B2, bp -2124/-2113 in mice) was found to have high identity with the recently described large Maf binding consensus (Ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref30">30</xref> and <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1<italic>A</italic></xref>). Three bands were specifically detected in gel shift experiments performed with &#x003b2;-cell nuclear extracts using either mouse or human B2 probes, with the top two supershifted with MafA antibody (compare <italic>MIN6</italic> and &#x003b2;<italic>TC3</italic> to <italic>NIH3T3</italic> in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1<italic>B</italic></xref>). Antibody screening studies demonstrated that the other band contains the Pax6 transcription factor, another activator of islet cell development and &#x003b2;-cell function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref32">32</xref>). However, the interaction between Pax6 and B2 appears to be weak, because the Pax6-DNA complex was disrupted by a supershift competent Pax6 antibody (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1<italic>B</italic></xref>), and only a very small amount of Pax6 was bound when compared with a Pax6 consensus site probe (data not shown). In contrast, B2 had high affinity for MafA as judged using <italic>bona fide</italic> large Maf competitors, Insulin C1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref33">33</xref>) and AII B4/5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref>) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1<italic>C</italic></xref>). (AII B4/5 resides just 14 bp from B2 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1<italic>A</italic></xref>)). Using the same large Maf competitors, MafB was also observed to bind the B2 element with the same specificity as MafA (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1<italic>D</italic></xref>). These data identify the B2 element of Area II as large Maf and Pax6 binding sites in EMSA, albeit Pax6 relatively poorly.</p><p><italic>Only MafA or MafB Stimulate B2 Activity</italic>&#x02014;Gel shift assays were performed with a series of B2 mutants to more precisely localize large Maf and Pax6 protein binding. Two unique 3-bp mutants were identified that distinguished their binding (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>). Hence, changing the TGC core in the large Maf consensus completely eliminates MafA and MafB binding to B2 without impacting Pax6 association in competition and direct binding assays (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2, <italic>B&#x02013;D</italic></xref>, see <italic>TGCmt</italic>). In contrast, mutation of individual base pairs outside of the large Maf consensus disrupted Pax6 binding without impairing MafA or MafB binding (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2, <italic>B&#x02013;D</italic></xref>, see <italic>CACmt</italic>).</p><p>The effect of the large Maf and Pax6 distinguishing mutations in B2 on human AII-driven activity was analyzed in &#x003b2; cell line transfection assays, a context wherein only MafA and Pax6 are expressed.

It is possible that AII B2-CAC mutant activity was potentiated due to either removal of a repressor (<italic>i.e.</italic> Pax6) or enhanced MafA activator binding. We favor the latter, as Pax6 actually binds very weakly to this site in relation to MafA/B in gel shift assays, and there is no precedence for this factor acting in a repressive manner. In addition, MafA binding was increased in the Pax6 binding mutant, as observed in concentration-dependent competition gel shift assays (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2<italic>B</italic></xref>).</p><p><fig position="float" id="fig2"><label>FIGURE 2.</label><caption><p><bold>MafA stimulates B2-mediated activity, but not Pax6.</bold><italic>A</italic>, shown is the relationship of the TGC and CAC mutations to the large Maf consensus.

ChIP analysis was performed in &#x003b2;TC3 cells to determine the relative distribution of MafA binding sites between conserved <italic>Pdx1</italic> transcriptional control regions. Real-time PCR analysis was used to quantitatively compare the enrichment of these regions to that of a non-transcribed gene, <italic>PEPCK</italic>. AII sequences were highly enriched relative to AI, AIII, and AIV (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4<italic>A</italic></xref>). Although the AI and AIII signals were slightly above the <italic>PEPCK</italic> control, this was not significant and likely represents randomly sheared chromosomal DNA (primarily 100&#x02013;500 bp) encompassing AI/AII or AII/III.

As predicted, EnMafB significantly reduced AII-driven activity (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4<italic>B</italic></xref>), while not affecting AI- or AIV-mediated expression. This and the ChIP data are complementary and indicate that large Maf factors bind to and regulate specifically through Area II.</p><p><italic>B2 and B4/5 Are the Principal Large Maf Binding Sites within AII</italic>&#x02014;Because large Maf binding was localized to the AII control domain of the <italic>Pdx1</italic> gene, we screened for additional large Maf binding elements within this region using a comprehensive series of overlapping oligonucleotides in gel shift competition assays.

However, 3 different AII competitors did impact MafA binding, with the -2124 competitor containing both B2 and B4/5 (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5<italic>B</italic></xref>). In contrast, the -2196 competitor spanned sequences located 5&#x02032; to the highly conserved AII domain, while the conserved B12&#x02013;15 elements were in -2029.

This work also supports MafA regulation of <italic>Pdx1</italic>, with a prominent role presumably in the adult islet &#x003b2;-cell. The control mechanisms described here are likely to be generally utilized by large Maf transcription factors, each of which have been implicated in multiple developmental processes (<italic>e.g.</italic> (NRL), eye rod formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref36">36</xref>); c-Maf, chondrocyte differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref37">37</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref39">39</xref>): MafB, hindbrain segmentation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref40">40</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref41">41</xref>), and podocyte differentiation in the kidney (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref42">42</xref>)).</p><p>AII was determined to be the exclusive large Maf binding region within the <italic>Pdx1</italic> 5&#x02032;-flanking region in quantitative ChIP and <italic>Pdx1</italic>-driven transfection experiments. A new AII large Maf control element, B2, was also discovered that lies directly upstream of the previously characterized B4/5 site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">18</xref>). Two other potential binding sites were revealed in Area II by gel shift analysis (termed 5&#x02032; and B13, <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>), but activation appears to principally be through B2 and B4/5 elements, as revealed in experiments performed with the EnMafB suppressor and 5&#x02032; and B13 mutants in &#x003b2; cell lines (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6<italic>B</italic></xref>). <italic>In vitro</italic> binding assays also recognized the ability of B2 to bind the Pax6 activator, albeit weakly.

Strikingly, MafA was only detected in insulin<sup>+</sup> cells while high Pdx1 levels were in both insulin<sup>+</sup> and hormone<sup>-</sup> progenitors until E15.5 in <italic>MafB</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice, although Pdx1 was clearly reduced in hormone<sup>-</sup> cells by E18.5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">20</xref>). <italic>Pdx1<sup>AI/II</sup></italic>-<italic>LacZ</italic> activity was also specifically detected in insulin<sup>+</sup> cells in <italic>MafB</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice at E18.5 (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8</xref>).
