Cytoplasmic linker&#x02013;associated proteins (CLASPs) are MT-associated proteins thought to organize intracellular MTs and display a unique spatiotemporal regulation. In migrating epithelial cells, CLASPs track MT plus ends in the cell body but bind along MTs in the lamella. In this study, we demonstrate that glycogen synthase kinase 3&#x003b2; (GSK3&#x003b2;) directly phosphorylates CLASPs at multiple sites in the domain required for MT plus end tracking. Although complete phosphorylation disrupts both plus end tracking and association along lamella MTs, we show that partial phosphorylation of the identified GSK3&#x003b2; motifs determines whether CLASPs track plus ends or associate along MTs. In addition, we find that expression of constitutively active GSK3&#x003b2; destabilizes lamella MTs by disrupting lateral MT interactions with the cell cortex. GSK3&#x003b2;-induced lamella MT destabilization was partially rescued by expression of CLASP2 with mutated phosphorylation sites. This indicates that CLASP-mediated stabilization of peripheral MTs, which likely occurs in the vicinity of focal adhesions, may be regulated by local GSK3&#x003b2; inactivation.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p>The microtubule (MT) network is important for many cell functions such as intracellular transport, cell division, and cell migration during development or tissue remodeling. In addition to actin-driven lamella/lamellipodia protrusion in the direction of migration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Small and Resch, 2005</xref>), migrating cells are characterized by orientation of the MT-organizing center and a large population of MTs toward the leading edge. This polarity of the MT network is thought to be important for directional migration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Wittmann and Waterman-Storer, 2001</xref>). MTs are dynamic polymers that stochastically switch between phases of polymerization and depolymerization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Howard and Hyman, 2003</xref>). Stabilization of lamella MTs is mediated by a bias of MT polymerization dynamics toward net growth downstream of intracellular signaling pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Wittmann et al., 2003</xref>), which may result from spatiotemporally regulated interactions of these MTs with the cortical cytoskeleton in the cell's lamella (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gundersen et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lansbergen and Akhmanova, 2006</xref>).</p><p>Plus end tracking proteins (+TIPs) are a heterogeneous class of proteins that specifically accumulate at or near the plus ends of growing MTs in cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Galjart, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Akhmanova and Steinmetz, 2008</xref>). Three different +TIP complexes have been suggested to participate in MT linkage to cortical sites. CLIP-170 may mediate lamella MT attachments through interactions with activated Rac1, IQGAP1, and components of the dynein&#x02013;dynactin complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Fukata et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lansbergen et al., 2004</xref>). Adenomatous polyposis coli protein may link lamella MTs to the actin cytoskeleton through EB1-mediated binding to the formin mDia1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Wen et al., 2004</xref>), and cytoplasmic linker&#x02013;associated proteins (CLASPs) may link lamella MTs to adhesion sites by interactions with the spectraplakin ACF7 and the phosphatidylinositol (3,4,5)-trisphosphate sensor LL5&#x003b2; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Drabek et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lansbergen et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Wu et al., 2008</xref>). However, it is not understood how such MT attachment is regulated to specifically stabilize lamella MTs. In directionally migrating cells, CLASPs display a spatiotemporal gradient of intracellular distribution that correlates with the cell's direction of migration. In fibroblasts, CLASPs accumulate in cortical patches near the cell's leading edge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Drabek et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lansbergen et al., 2006</xref>). In epithelial cells, CLASPs associate along lamella MTs independently of their plus end tracking activity in the cell body (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Wittmann and Waterman-Storer, 2005</xref>). In addition, CLASPs may anchor MTs at the Golgi apparatus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Efimov et al., 2007</xref>).</p><p>Many MT-associated proteins are negatively regulated by phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Cassimeris and Spittle, 2001</xref>), and expression of constitutively active glycogen synthase kinase 3&#x003b2; (GSK3&#x003b2;) disrupts CLASP&#x02013;MT association in cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Akhmanova et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Wittmann and Waterman-Storer, 2005</xref>). GSK3&#x003b2; substrates include several MT-associated proteins such as the adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) protein, the von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) protein, and neuronal MT-associated proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Zumbrunn et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cho and Johnson, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Trivedi et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hergovich et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Ferrarese et al., 2007</xref>), as well as other MT regulatory proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Yoshimura et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Fumoto et al., 2006</xref>). Thus, GSK3&#x003b2; may be a master regulator of the MT cytoskeleton. In contrast to most other protein kinases, GSK3&#x003b2; activity is high in nonstimulated cells and is inhibited in the leading edge of migrating astrocytes and developing neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Etienne-Manneville and Hall, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Yoshimura et al., 2006</xref>). Because this proposed gradient of GSK3&#x003b2; activity correlates well with the spatiotemporal distribution of CLASP&#x02013;MT association in migrating cells, we investigated the regulation of CLASP2 by GSK3&#x003b2; in greater detail. In this study, we identify a cluster of GSK3&#x003b2; phosphorylation sites in the CLASP&#x02013;MT plus end tracking domain and show that phosphorylation of a specific GSK3&#x003b2; motif switches CLASP activity between plus end tracking and association along MTs. In addition, our data indicate that GSK3&#x003b2;-mediated CLASP phosphorylation plays an important role in the cortical attachment and stabilization of lamella MTs in collectively migrating epithelial cells.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec><title>GSK3&#x003b2; regulates lamella MT persistence in migrating epithelial cells</title><p>To analyze whether local GSK3&#x003b2; inactivation regulates lamella MT dynamics in migrating epithelial cells, we used an immortalized human keratinocyte cell line (HaCaT; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Boukamp et al., 1988</xref>) because localization of endogenous CLASP along lamella MTs in these HaCaT cells was very similar to what we previously observed in PtK1 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 A</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Wittmann and Waterman-Storer, 2005</xref>).

The number of these MTs seemed large compared with other epithelial cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Waterman-Storer and Salmon, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Wittmann et al., 2003</xref>), indicating that HaCaT keratinocytes are a good model to study this lamella-specific MT population in truly migratory epithelial cells. Manual MT end tracking in EGFP-tubulin&#x02013;expressing cells revealed that lamella MTs were relatively nondynamic and spent a large amount of time in pause with mostly short excursions of growth or shortening (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 F</xref> and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200901042/DC1">Table S1</ext-link>).</p><p>HaCaT cells transiently expressing constitutively active monomeric RFP (mRFP)&#x02013;GSK3&#x003b2;(S9A) displayed significant morphological differences as compared with control cells (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200901042/DC1">Fig. S1</ext-link>). These cells were generally bigger with a flatter lamella and migrated significantly slower than control cells (control, 13.4 &#x000b1; 3.8 &#x000b5;m/h; GSK3&#x003b2;(S9A), 9.0 &#x000b1; 4.1 &#x000b5;m/h; Fig. S5 and see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig. 7 E</xref>). Although several aspects of cytoskeleton organization likely caused this phenotype, the most striking difference was a dramatically decreased density of lamella MTs in GSK3&#x003b2;(S9A)-expressing cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 B</xref> and Fig. S1 A) and the absence of stable acetylated MTs (Fig. S1 B). This decrease in lamella MT density was accompanied by altered MT polymerization dynamics. Although transition frequencies between phases of growth and shortening were only decreased mildly in GSK3&#x003b2;(S9A)-expressing cells, both growth and shortening rates of lamella MTs were significantly increased, and MTs spent less time in pause and more time growing and shortening (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 F</xref> and Table S1). In addition, lamella MTs in GSK3&#x003b2;(S9A)-expressing cells displayed increased lateral movement, buckling, and looping (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1, B and B&#x02032;</xref>, compare insets; and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200901042/DC1">Video 3</ext-link>). We confirmed this by image cross-correlation analysis in which the correlation coefficient between images at increasing time intervals decreased significantly more rapidly in GSK3&#x003b2;(S9A)-expressing cells than in control cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 G</xref>).</p><p>Because we were not able to distinguish individual MT ends in the cell body of EGFP-tubulin&#x02013;expressing cells, we used EB1-EGFP as a marker for growing MT plus ends to compare MT polymerization dynamics in the cell body and lamella of control and mRFP-GSK3&#x003b2;(S9A)&#x02013;expressing cells (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200901042/DC1">Videos 4 and 5</ext-link>). Computer vision tracking of a large population of EB1-labeled MT ends revealed that the density of growing MTs was significantly higher in the lamella of control cells as compared with the cell body (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1, C&#x02013;E</xref>). In GSK3&#x003b2;(S9A)-expressing cells, MT density was significantly reduced 1.7-fold in the cell body and threefold in the lamella (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1, E and E&#x02032;</xref>). In both control and GSK3&#x003b2;(S9A)-expressing cells, the growth rate of lamella MTs (control, 18.0 &#x000b1; 0.8 &#x000b5;m/min; GSK3&#x003b2;(S9A), 17.3 &#x000b1; 2.9 &#x000b5;m/min) was reduced as compared with MTs in the cell body (control, 21.4 &#x000b1; 1.4 &#x000b5;m/min; GSK3&#x003b2;(S9A), 24.1 &#x000b1; 1.6 &#x000b5;m/min), which is similar to what we previously observed in Ptk1 cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Wittmann and Waterman-Storer, 2005</xref>). However, the growth rate of lamella MTs in control and GSK3&#x003b2;(S9A)-expressing cells was not significantly different. Because the sampling frequency used for EB1 tracking was more than 10-fold faster than for direct MT end tracking, this indicates that the increase in growth rate observed by MT end tracking (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 F</xref>) is likely a result of the decreased amount of time lamella MTs spend in the pause state in GSK3&#x003b2;(S9A)-expressing cells.</p></sec><sec><title>GSK3&#x003b2; phosphorylates CLASP2 in the MT plus end tracking domain</title><p>CLASP knockdown by RNA interference results in decreased MT density in the cell periphery in both HeLa and HaCaT cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Mimori-Kiyosue et al., 2005</xref>; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200901042/DC1">Fig. S2</ext-link>).

We focused our analysis on CLASP2 phosphorylation because this is the main CLASP expressed in HaCaT cells (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200901042/DC1">Fig. S3</ext-link>).</p><p>We used a gel shift assay in which we compared the relative migration of CLASP in control HeLa cells and cells treated with two different GSK3&#x003b2; inhibitors. Both LiCl and SB216763 induced a downshift of the endogenous CLASP band and of EGFP-CLASP2(340&#x02013;1,084), indicating GSK3&#x003b2;-mediated CLASP phosphorylation and high GSK3&#x003b2; activity in nonstimulated cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 A</xref>). Because CLASP2 contains several potential GSK3&#x003b2; phosphorylation motifs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 C</xref>), we used truncated CLASP2 constructs to define the parts of the CLASP molecule phosphorylated by GSK3&#x003b2;. We found that only constructs containing the MT plus end tracking domain (MT#1; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 C</xref>) between amino acid 512 and 650 displayed a GSK3&#x003b2;-dependent gel shift (unpublished data).

S614A, which is not conserved in CLASP1, did not affect GSK3&#x003b2;-dependent phosphorylation, indicating that it is not part of the motif. In addition, mutation of serines at the C-terminal end of the motif had a larger impact on GSK3&#x003b2;-dependent phosphorylation than mutation of more N-terminal serine residues consistent with the proposed sequential mechanism of GSK3&#x003b2; phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Frame et al., 2001</xref>).</p><p>We next analyzed phosphorylation of EGFP-CLASP2(340&#x02013;875) that specifically lacks MT#2 required for CLASP binding along lamella MTs. EGFP-CLASP2(340&#x02013;875) was phosphorylated to a similar extent as EGFP-CLASP2(340&#x02013;1,084), phosphorylation was inhibited by SB216763, and coexpression of mRFP-GSK3&#x003b2;(S9A) led to a small increase in phosphorylation of both constructs. This indicates that association along lamella MTs is not required for GSK3&#x003b2;-dependent phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 C</xref>).</p><p>Although our initial gel shift experiments indicated that the GSK3&#x003b2; motif at S568 was not phosphorylated under physiological conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 B</xref>), this sequence is an exact duplication of the N-terminal part of the motif at S594 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 C</xref>). We therefore tested whether this motif can be phosphorylated in cells expressing constitutively active GSK3&#x003b2;(S9A) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 D</xref>). A construct containing only the plus end tracking domain (MT#1), EGFP-CLASP2(512&#x02013;650), was less efficiently phosphorylated by endogenous GSK3&#x003b2; than the longer constructs. However, coexpression of mRFP-GSK3&#x003b2;(S9A) boosted phosphorylation more than twofold. The 6&#x000d7;S/A construct was still phosphorylated to a reduced extent in the presence of mRFP-GSK3&#x003b2;(S9A), indicating that GSK3&#x003b2; can phosphorylate additional sites in the plus end tracking domain. However, additional S568/572/576A mutation (9&#x000d7;S/A) abolished phosphorylation even in mRFP-GSK3&#x003b2;(S9A)&#x02013;expressing cells.</p><p>Finally, we tested whether CLASP2 is a direct GSK3&#x003b2; substrate. To retain potential priming phosphorylation, instead of using bacterially expressed protein, we immunoprecipitated EGFP-tagged CLASP2(512&#x02013;650) from HeLa cell lysates and performed in vitro kinase assays with purified GSK3&#x003b2; (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 E</xref>). As compared with the wild-type (WT) protein, phosphorylation of both the 6&#x000d7;S/A and 9&#x000d7;S/A mutant was greatly reduced. Together, these results demonstrate that the S594/598/602/606/610 motif is a physiological target of GSK3&#x003b2; and is highly phosphorylated in nonstimulated cells. However, a partial duplication of this motif at S568/572/576 can be phosphorylated by high levels of intracellular GSK3&#x003b2; activity and may contribute to the regulation of CLASP function.</p></sec><sec><title>GSK3&#x003b2; phosphorylation modulates CLASP2&#x02013;MT binding in cells</title><p>The CLASP2 domain between amino acid 512 and 650 containing the GSK3&#x003b2; phosphorylation sites identified in the previous section is sufficient for MT plus end tracking in cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Mimori-Kiyosue et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 C</xref>, MT#1).

Both of the constructs with only one of the GSK3&#x003b2; motifs mutated, 3&#x000d7;S/A and 6&#x000d7;S/A, rescued MT plus end association only at very low GSK3&#x003b2;(S9A) expression levels.

In addition, MT density was still decreased in these cells, and cell migration rate was not rescued, which is consistent with GSK3&#x003b2; phosphorylation of other targets important for cell migration and MT regulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig. 7 E</xref> and Fig. S5).</p><p>However, we found that MTs decorated with 9&#x000d7;S/A CLASP2(340&#x02013;1,362) in GSK3&#x003b2;(S9A)-expressing cells displayed less lateral movement than MTs in GSK3&#x003b2;(S9A)-expressing cells (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200901042/DC1">Video 7</ext-link>). Consistent with this, image cross-correlation analysis revealed no significant difference in the time-dependent decay of the correlation coefficient between cells expressing WT or 9&#x000d7;S/A EGFP-CLASP2(340&#x02013;1,362) or cells expressing both mRFP-GSK3&#x003b2;(S9A) and 9&#x000d7;S/A EGFP-CLASP2(340&#x02013;1,362) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig. 7 F</xref>). In contrast, 9&#x000d7;S/A EGFP-CLASP2(340&#x02013;1,084) did not rescue GSK3&#x003b2;(S9A)-induced lateral MT movement, indicating that the CLASP2 C terminus is required to anchor lamella MTs to the cortical cytoskeleton.</p><p>In addition, in the lamella of migrating HaCaT keratinocytes, we often observed clusters of EGFP-CLASP2(340&#x02013;1,362), which remained stationary relative to the substrate reminiscent of adhesion dynamics in migrating cells (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200901042/DC1">Video 8</ext-link>). Such clusters were largely absent in cells expressing EGFP-CLASP2(340&#x02013;1,084) (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200901042/DC1">Video 9</ext-link>). Time-lapse analysis of EGFP-CLASP2(340&#x02013;1,362) in combination with mCherry-paxillin as a focal adhesion marker further revealed that CLASP-decorated MTs engulf focal adhesions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig. 7 C</xref> and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200901042/DC1">Video 10</ext-link>) and that focal adhesion and CLASP dynamics are spatiotemporally correlated during epithelial cell migration.</p><p>To test how such CLASP-mediated MT attachment to cortical sites affects MT polymerization dynamics, we directly tracked EGFP-CLASP2&#x02013;decorated lamella MT ends. MT dynamic instability parameters determined in this way were very similar to what we measured in EGFP-tubulin&#x02013;expressing cells, and both 9&#x000d7;S/A EGFP-CLASP2(340&#x02013;1,362) and 9&#x000d7;S/A EGFP-CLASP2(340&#x02013;1,084) largely rescued GSK3&#x003b2;(S9A)-induced MT polymerization dynamics defects (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig. 7 G</xref> and Table S1). This indicates that nonphosphorylated CLASP2(340&#x02013;1,084) has a stabilizing effect on MTs, which is independent of MT interactions with the cell cortex mediated by the C-terminal domain.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><sec><title>CLASP phosphorylation by GSK3&#x003b2;</title><p>In this study, we show that CLASPs are physiological GSK3&#x003b2; substrates. We used a candidate approach in which we replaced GSK3&#x003b2; consensus motifs with nonphosphorylatable alanine residues to identify sites that are phosphorylated by endogenous levels of GSK3&#x003b2;. Although CLASP2 contains several potential GSK3&#x003b2; motifs, mutation of five serine residues between S594 and S610 abolished GSK3&#x003b2;-dependent phosphorylation in different cell types. Furthermore, we found that a partial duplication of the N-terminal half of this motif between S568 and S576 can be phosphorylated by elevated GSK3&#x003b2; activity levels but may only have a small contribution to endogenous CLASP2 phosphorylation. These GSK3&#x003b2; phosphorylation motifs are highly conserved in all mammalian CLASPs, and phosphorylation of some of these sites has been observed by mass spectrometry proteomic approaches (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 C</xref>).</p><p>Phosphorylation of most GSK3&#x003b2; substrates depends on priming phosphorylation by a different protein kinase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Jope and Johnson, 2004</xref>). We currently do not know whether CLASP2 phosphorylation by GSK3&#x003b2; requires priming phosphorylation, but it is intriguing that both C-terminal residues of the functional GSK3&#x003b2; motifs (S610 and S576) are near perfect matches to the Cdk consensus (S/T)PX(K/R) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 C</xref>). In addition, inefficient phosphorylation of bacterially produced CLASP2 protein in vitro suggests that priming phosphorylation is required (unpublished data). Although Cdk5 may act as a priming kinase for other MT regulatory proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cho and Johnson, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Yoshimura et al., 2005</xref>), different Cdk inhibitors did not decrease CLASP phosphorylation in HeLa cells (unpublished data).</p></sec><sec><title>Regulation of CLASP&#x02013;MT interactions</title><p>All functional GSK3&#x003b2; phosphorylation sites reside within the CLASP2 domain required for MT plus end tracking and association with EB1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Mimori-Kiyosue et al., 2005</xref>), and we found that both of these activities are inhibited by GSK3&#x003b2;-mediated phosphorylation. Our experiments using subtilisin-treated MTs further indicate that MT binding of the CLASP2 plus end tracking domain requires the negatively charged tubulin C terminus. However, CLASP plus end tracking does not require the very C-terminal tubulin tyrosine residue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Peris et al., 2006</xref>). Thus, because the CLASP plus end tracking domain contains numerous strongly positively charged arginine and lysine residues, it is possible that the interaction of this short domain with MTs is primarily electrostatic.</p><p>Multisite phosphorylation by GSK3&#x003b2; could gradually disrupt this electrostatic glue by introducing multiple strongly negatively charged phosphate groups. Because a single phosphorylation may not be sufficient to disrupt the interaction of many charged residues, such a mechanism could explain the role of GSK3&#x003b2; as an amplifier of an initial priming kinase-dependent signaling event. The positive feedback achieved by hierarchical phosphorylation may contribute to a steeper response of such an electrostatic switch (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Roach, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Ferrarese et al., 2007</xref>). The role of GSK3&#x003b2; as a signal amplifier rather than a signal transducer could further explain why GSK3&#x003b2; is involved in such a wide variety of seemingly unrelated intracellular processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Jope and Johnson, 2004</xref>).</p><p>Intracellular dynamics of full-length CLASPs are complex, and CLASPs can directly or indirectly interact with MTs through at least three different domains. Although TOG-like domains, which may mediate interactions with MTs, only partially overlap with functionally defined domains involved in MT interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Mimori-Kiyosue et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Wittmann and Waterman-Storer, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Slep and Vale, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 C</xref>), differential regulation of multiple weak interactions may determine whether CLASPs track MT plus ends or bind along MTs. We propose a model in which partial phosphorylation of the motif at S594 inhibits MT#2, the domain required for association along MTs, through a long-range conformational change before directly affecting the plus end tracking domain (MT#1). Because MT#2 has very weak MT-binding activity on its own (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Wittmann and Waterman-Storer, 2005</xref>), it may not be involved directly in MT binding. Only complete phosphorylation of both GSK3&#x003b2; motifs in the presence of elevated GSK3&#x003b2; activity disrupted CLASP2(340&#x02013;1,084) plus end tracking, and it remains to be determined whether this occurs under physiological conditions.</p><p>Consistent with a model that partial phosphorylation may distinguish between different modes of CLASP&#x02013;MT association, complete phosphorylation of all eight GSK3&#x003b2; sites disrupted both plus end tracking and binding along lamella MTs, and mutation of all GSK3&#x003b2; sites rescued both activities in cells expressing elevated GSK3&#x003b2; levels. However, most importantly, mutation of the first GSK3&#x003b2; motif that is not phosphorylated by physiological GSK3&#x003b2; levels preferentially rescued plus end tracking. This strongly indicates that in cells, the physiologically relevant GSK3&#x003b2; motif at S594 is responsible for regulating CLASP&#x02013;MT association in the lamella. Thus, the observed gradient of CLASP&#x02013;MT association is likely the result of different CLASP phosphorylation states as a result of GSK3&#x003b2; inactivation in the protruding lamella (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Etienne-Manneville and Hall, 2003</xref>), although additional mechanisms may be involved.</p><p>It is possible that the two CLASP&#x02013;MT-binding domains recognize slightly different tubulin conformations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Nogales and Wang, 2006</xref>), resulting in different affinities of these domains for MT plus ends and MT lattices. In this case, CLASP plus end tracking would simply be an equilibrium binding process depending on a structural property of growing MT ends. This is entirely consistent with the observed rapid exchange of plus end&#x02013;bound and soluble +TIPs in cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Wittmann and Waterman-Storer, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dragestein et al., 2008</xref>), recent in vitro studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bieling et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Wittmann, 2008</xref>), and our observation that the EGFP-CLASP2(512&#x02013;650) plus end comet length does not depend on the phosphorylation state.</p></sec><sec><title>CLASP function in migrating cells</title><p>In migrating HaCaT keratinocytes, CLASP2-decorated lamella MTs often persisted in immobile clusters as the cell migrated across. We show that these clusters of CLASP-decorated lamella MTs are closely associated with focal adhesions. In addition, CLASP and focal adhesion dynamics were spatiotemporally correlated, and focal adhesion turnover preceded the disappearance of CLASP-decorated MTs. Thus, GSK3&#x003b2; and CLASPs may play a role in adhesion site turnover consistent with the observation that GSK3&#x003b2; inhibition freezes focal adhesion dynamics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kobayashi et al., 2006</xref>).</p><p>Because cortical interactions are mediated by the CLASP C terminus, CLASP-interacting proteins such as LL5&#x003b2; or ACF7 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Drabek et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lansbergen et al., 2006</xref>) are likely involved. We speculate that interactions of CLASP-decorated MTs with focal adhesions contribute to lamella MT stability, although our results suggest that CLASPs also influence MT polymerization dynamics directly, independent of interactions of the C terminus. Because the spectraplakin ACF7 guides MTs along actin cables in keratinocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Wu et al., 2008</xref>), it is likely that CLASPs and ACF7 cooperate to organize the MT cytoskeleton in migrating epithelial cells.</p><p>Punctate cortical structures often remained in cells with elevated levels of GSK3&#x003b2; activity, suggesting that cortical interactions may not be regulated directly by GSK3&#x003b2; phosphorylation. In cells expressing constitutively active GSK3&#x003b2;, MTs cannot interact with phosphorylated CLASP at these cortical sites, resulting in increased lateral MT movements, altered MT polymerization dynamics, and decreased MT stability as indicated by decreased acetylation and detyrosination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Eng et al., 2006</xref>). Consistent with this hypothesis, both CLASP RNA interference and ACF7-null cells displayed defects in peripheral MT density and dynamics that were qualitatively similar to the expression of constitutively active GSK3&#x003b2;(S9A) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kodama et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Mimori-Kiyosue et al., 2005</xref>). Interactions of nonphosphorylated CLASPs with the cell cortex likely occur along the sides of lamella MTs, which represent a more robust mechanism of lamella MT stabilization than direct capture of highly dynamic MT ends. Additional stabilization of CLASP lamella MT binding through interactions of the CLASP C terminus with the cell cortex may also explain the residual gradient of CLASP&#x02013;MT interactions in cells in which the GSK3&#x003b2; activity gradient was disrupted. Alternatively, gradients of other signaling molecules may affect CLASP&#x02013;MT binding, for example, by modulating priming phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Ridley et al., 2003</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="Materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Constructs and adenoviral vectors</title><p>pEGFP-CLASP2 and other constructs were used as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Wittmann and Waterman-Storer, 2005</xref>).
