In that context, early studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>] identified a hypomorphic <italic>mab-21 </italic>allele as a dominant enhancer of <italic>egl-5</italic>, a loss-of-function mutation affecting the nematode homolog of the <italic>Drosophila </italic>homeotic gene <italic>AbdominalB</italic>. Subsequent studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>] demonstrated that <italic>mab-21</italic>(+) plays a key role in the formation of the nematode male tail. Homozygous <italic>mab-21 </italic>mutations act cell-autonomously on the identity of a sensory ray, leading to alterations in anteroposterior identities akin to a homeotic transformation. Furthermore, they act non-cell-autonomously on the binary switch between hypodermal and neuroblast specification. Finally, hypomorphic <italic>mab-21 </italic>mutants exhibit pleiotropic changes affecting movement, body shape and fecundity, suggesting that <italic>mab-21</italic>(+) also plays key developmental roles outside the male tail region.</p><p>The <italic>mab-21 </italic>gene encodes a 41 kD basic protein with no significant homologies to any other published proteins. Homologs of the <italic>mab-21 </italic>gene have been identified in many other species, from <italic>Drosophila </italic>to humans. The first vertebrate counterparts of <italic>mab-21 </italic>were isolated in amniote genomes: a human homolog, <italic>MAB21L1</italic>, was cloned during a systematic search for transcripts carrying trinucleotide repeats [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>] and potentially involved in the pathogenesis of neuropsychiatric disorders. Interestingly, recent physical mapping data have located <italic>Mab21l1 </italic>within a chromosomal deletion discovered in a patient with autism and language deficit secondary to an auditory processing abnormality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>].</p><p>Our group, in parallel with others, identified two murine <italic>mab-21 </italic>genes (<italic>Mab21l1</italic>, <italic>Mab21l2</italic>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>] and the human <italic>MAB21L2 </italic>gene, and showed that they encode nuclear proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>] that are 94% identical, 98% homologous to each other. In the mouse, <italic>Mab21l1 </italic>and <italic>Mab21l2 </italic>are expressed in largely overlapping territories [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>], suggesting the possibility of a high degree of functional redundancy. More recently, only one vertebrate member of the mab-21 family was isolated in <italic>Xenopus laevis </italic>(<italic>Xmab21l2</italic>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>], (and our unpublished data: GenBank entry AF040992) and <italic>Danio rerio </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>] (<italic>Zmab21l2</italic>). <italic>Mab21l2 </italic>is an early marker of the tectum as well as primitive eye field, optic cup and retina in anamniotes, in agreement with observations previously made in mouse embryos.</p><p>To address the <italic>in vivo </italic>roles of mab-21 genes in vertebrates, loss-of-function studies have been carried out by different groups in <italic>Xenopus </italic>and mouse embryos. Lau et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>] interfered with the functions of <italic>Xmab21l2 </italic>in embryogenesis by applying antisense DNA and double-stranded RNAi techniques. As a result, they reported a high frequency of embryos arrested at late gastrula/early neurula, as well as a significant incidence of neural tube closure defects in tadpoles. Likewise, Wong and Chow [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>] cultured mouse embryos in the presence of antisense oligos specific for <italic>Mab21l1 </italic>and <italic>Mab21l2</italic>, and reported that both treatments caused a sharp increase in the incidence of defective axial turning, incomplete notochord formation, and neural tube closure defects. However, <italic>Mab21l2</italic>-specific antisense oligos were more potent and more effective than <italic>Mab21l1</italic>-specific ones, suggesting that <italic>Mab21l2 </italic>may play a more irreplaceable role in early development than <italic>Mab21l1</italic>.</p><p>As said, mab-21 genes mark early stages of eye development in various species. Likely due to redundancy in the vertebrate mab-21 gene family a knock-out mouse carrying a null mutation of <italic>Mab21l1 </italic>featured an isolated, cell-autonomous defect in lens placode development, providing a novel and valuable model for the study of various eye defects in humans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>], but no overt retinal abnormalities. Conversely, <italic>Mab21l2 </italic>has been found to participate crucially in zebrafish retina formation acting as a downstream effector of <italic>Rx2 </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>].</p><p>Some of these important advances point to a critical role for the mab-21 gene family as a whole in early embryogenesis on one hand, and in various aspects of neural development on the other. However, our knowledge on the molecular mechanisms through which mab-21 genes operate remains inadequate at best. Interestingly, by genetic analysis of loss-of-function mutations in <italic>C. elegans</italic>, Morita <italic>et al</italic>. have proposed <italic>mab-21 </italic>as a downstream target of a TGF-beta superfamily signaling pathway involved in sensory ray identity, the Small/Male-tail-abnormal pathway. This pathway is initiated by the secreted ligand CET-1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>], also known as DBL-1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>], and regulates body growth and male tail development. The CET-1/DBL-1 ligand transmits its signal through two receptor serine threonine kinases, DAF-4 and SMA-6, which in turn regulate the activity of the nuclear transducers SMA-2, SMA-3, and SMA-4. Hypomorphic mutations of <italic>mab-21 </italic>are epistatic to cet-1 pathway mutations affecting ray pattern formation (<italic>cet-1</italic>, <italic>sma-2</italic>, <italic>sma-3</italic>, <italic>sma-4</italic>), while they do not affect body size in double mutants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. Reportedly, this interaction did not reflect regulation of <italic>mab-21 </italic>gene transcription by the sma signaling pathway.</p><p>The above genetic studies prove the biological relevance of the <italic>mab-21 </italic>&#x02013; TGF-beta interaction, but stop short of addressing several key questions. What is the molecular counterpart of the genetic interaction described in <italic>C. elegans </italic>between <italic>mab-21 </italic>and the sma pathway? Is this interaction conserved in vertebrate development, and what TGF-beta superfamily molecules does it involve? Does it play a relevant role in the establishment of vertebrate dorsoventral (DV) polarity? If so, at what level do MAB-21 and TGF-beta pathways converge into a single regulatory cascade? In the present study, through a gain-of-function strategy, we analyze the molecular interplay between MAB21L2, a vertebrate homolog of <italic>C. elegans </italic>MAB-21, and TGF-beta superfamily signaling molecules. In particular, we focus on the signaling pathway initiated by BMP4, a ligand structurally related to CET-1/DBL-1, that regulates DV axis formation and numerous key aspects of neural development in <italic>chordata</italic>.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title><italic>Xmab21l2 </italic>expression in development</title><p>It is well established that the BMP4 pathway is essential for proper formation of the dorsoventral axis; overexpression of <italic>BMP4 </italic>in <italic>Xenopus </italic>embryos can lead to the formation ventralized embryos, i.e. embryos devoid of axial structures, whereas BMP4 depletion can lead to dorsalized embryos, i.e. embryos exhibiting an expansion of dorsal mesoderm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. At tailbud stages, the expression of <italic>Xmab21l2 </italic>is restricted to the primitive eye field, optic recess, optic cup and retina (excluding the choroid fissure), to the tectum and dorsal neural tube, and to branchial arches (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A&#x02013;E</xref>). The early-onset and sustained expression of the MAB21L2 protein in oocyte-, blastula, gastrula, tailbud and tadpole lysates suggests that <italic>Mab21l2 </italic>is expressed both maternally and zygotically, during and after gastrulation (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1F</xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Expression of Mab21l2 gene and protein in <italic>Xenopus laevis </italic>development. </bold>A) Double whole mount in situ hybridization for <italic>Xmab21l2 </italic>(blue) and <italic>Xkrox20 </italic>(brown).

Preliminary RT-PCR experiments conducted on gastrula lysates injected at the one-cell stage with <italic>BMP4 </italic>mRNA had shown that, as previously reported by others in studies conducted in the nematode, <italic>Xenopus Mab21l2 </italic>expression is not controlled by BMP4 signaling (not shown).</p><p>Prior to addressing the nature of the interaction between <italic>Xmab21l2 </italic>and BMP signaling molecules, we analyzed the effects of isolated <italic>Xmab21l2 </italic>overexpression. Embryos were injected at the one-cell stage with 800 pg <italic>in vitro</italic>-transcribed <italic>Xmab21l2 </italic>alone. We analyzed the phenotype of injected tailbud embryos as well as the expression of dorsal markers at gastrulation. A significant percentage of injected embryos <bold><italic>(48%, N = 200) </italic></bold>featured various degrees of dorsalization/anteriorization (DAI 6&#x02013;8), with a well formed, sometimes enlarged head, a broad cement gland, a short and/or bent axis (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>). We prepared embryos for histological examination by sectioning them along the longitudinal plane, both sagittally and horizontally.

It is well established that the DNA-binding protein SMAD1, once phosphorylated at the plasma membrane by the BMP receptor heterotetramer, assembles with the receptor-independent protein SMAD4, enters the nucleus, establishes interactions with various cofactors, and acts by regulating the transcription of a host of target genes [reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]]. Because vertebrate MAB-21 proteins are mainly or exclusively distributed in the nucleus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>], we investigated the possibility of a molecular interaction between MAB21L2 and SMAD proteins. In order to obtain <italic>in vitro </italic>evidence of this interaction, P19 cells were either treated with BMP4 or left untreated, and subsequently lysed. P19 cell extracts were then incubated with a resin-bound His-ZZ-tagged form of MAB21L2, or with a control His-ZZ-coupled resin. Eluates were analyzed by immunoblotting with a polyclonal anti-SMAD1 antibody. The experiment revealed a clear interaction between synthetic His-ZZ-MAB21L2 and <underline>endogenous</underline> SMAD1 that was absent when P19 lysates were incubated with the control resin (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5A</xref>). Although BMP4 treatment seemed to enhance it considerably, the interaction was not entirely BMP4-dependent, suggesting that conformational changes secondary to receptor-mediated phosphorylation may not be strictly required for SMAD1 to interact with MAB21L2.</p><fig position="float" id="F5"><label>Figure 5</label><caption><p><bold>Mab21l2 interacts with Smad1 <italic>in vitro </italic>and <italic>in vivo. </italic></bold><bold>(A) </bold>Lanes 1, 2: immunoblotting of total lysates from P19 cells, mock- and <italic>Smad1</italic>-transfected, respectively.

Once again, we resorted to affinity chromatography, incubating <italic>in vitro</italic>-translated, <sup>35</sup>S-Met-labeled SMAD1 and SMAD4 with a resin containing His-ZZ-MAB21L2. This experiment suggested that the interaction with SMAD1 is direct, and that MAB21L2 does not assemble with SMAD4 directly but only through SMAD1, indicating that the formation of a SMAD4-MAB21L2 complex is mediated by SMAD1 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5B</xref>). Indirectly, this experiment also showed that MAB21L2 does not obviously compete with SMAD4 to assemble with SMAD1.</p><p>Finally, we investigated whether the <italic>in vitro </italic>interaction observed between MAB21L2 and SMAD1 could be replicated <italic>in vivo</italic>. P19 cells co-transfected with myc-MAB21L2 and flag-SMAD1 were either treated with BMP4 or left untreated.

The embryos were grown until mid-gastrula stage (st. 10.5/11). Both cell- and embryo lysates were subjected to immunoprecipitation, using an anti flag monoclonal antibody, whereas an anti-myc antibody was utilized for immunodetection in Western blotting. Experiments conducted in transfected P19 cells showed that SMAD1 coprecipitates with MAB21L2, and that the interaction is enhanced by activation of BMP signaling, which is required for nuclear localization of receptor-dependent SMADs (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5C</xref>). Likewise, MAB21L2-SMAD1 co-precipitation took place especially, albeit not exclusively, in BMP4-coinjected embryos (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5D</xref>). Interaction of the two proteins in the absence of exogenous BMP4 can likely be explained by the abundance of endogenous BMP2/4 ligands in stage 11 gastrulae.</p></sec><sec><title>When targeted to an heterologous promoter, MAB21L2 acts as a strong transcriptional repressor</title><p>Because <italic>in vivo </italic>MAB21L2 acts as a BMP4 antagonist, and because BMP4 signaling is transduced in the nucleus by SMAD transactivators, we asked whether MAB21L2 has any intrinsic repressor functions. To address this point, we generated fusion transcripts adding the GAL4 DNA binding domain (residues 1&#x02013;147) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>], either to the N- or C-terminus of MAB21L2. For as yet unexplained reasons, the latter fusion protein proved extremely unstable and was discarded. Conversely, the N-terminal fusion protein is stable and was shown to bind DNA by gel-retardation assay (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6A</xref>). Thus, we were able to assess its activity in cotransfection assays, using as a reporter system the GAL4 target promoter (5XUAS) fused to luciferase. Luciferase activity in <italic>Mab21l2</italic>-cotransfected COS7 cells was compared to the baseline reporter activity scored in cells transfected with the GAL4 DBD alone (G-D) or with a transcriptionally inactive GAL4 DBD fusion protein, (GAL4HOXB3NT, G-N) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>].

The same luciferase assay was performed in P19 cells, co-transfected with plasmid DNA, G-D, and G-M, revealing a 12-fold downregulation of 5XUAS-luc in G-M-transfected cells (not shown). This confirmed the evidence of a strong repressor activity of MAB21l2 when targeted to DNA.</p><fig position="float" id="F6"><label>Figure 6</label><caption><p><bold>When targeted to a heterologous promoter, <italic>Mab21l2 </italic>behaves as a strong transcriptional repressor. </bold><bold>(A) </bold>An <italic>in vitro</italic>-translated chimeric protein containing the GAL4 DNA binding domain fused to the N-terminus of MAB21L2 was used in an electrophoretic mobility shift assay.

While epistatic analysis has proposed that <italic>C. elegans mab-21 </italic>undergoes inhibitory regulation by TGF-beta superfamily signals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>], the molecular nature of this regulation remained obscure.

The increasing levels of MAB21L2 protein observed starting at midblastula transition may be required to compensate mesoderm-ventralizing signals triggered by BMP2/4. In the absence of MAB21L2 genes, completion of gastrulation may be hampered, resulting in various abnormalities of dorsoventral polarity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. Results obtained by others have demonstrated that SMAD complexes can be turned into negative regulators of transcription through a physical interaction with transcriptional repressors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. Our results indicate that MAB21L2 possesses a considerable transcriptional repressor activity. However, the antagonistic interactions between MAB21L2 and BMP signaling may not necessarily depend on the formation of transcriptional regulation complexes. Further experiments will be required to characterize the mechanism(s) of transcriptional regulation mediated by MAB21L2. Importantly, the identification of <italic>Mab21l2 </italic>downstream genes will make it possible to investigate <italic>mab-21 </italic>&#x02013; <italic>BMP4 </italic>interactions from the opposite standpoint, i.e. by looking at the modulatory effect of BMP signaling on the expression of <italic>Mab21l2 </italic>targets.</p><p>Although our results are more directly relevant to understanding the functions of <italic>Mab21l2 </italic>in early embryogenesis, the gene is clearly expressed at high levels and in a tightly localized fashion in neurulation and morphogenesis as well, likely contributing to neural tube and eye formation. Indeed, because of redundancy in the mab-21 gene family, many of the early effects of mab-21 gene mutation may be masked, uncovering these genes' roles in later stages of development and postnatal life.</p><p>In late developmental processes, well beyond the end of gastrulation, MAB-21 proteins may prolong their dynamic interaction with BMP signaling transducers. As mentioned, a cell-autonomous requirement for <italic>Mab21l1 </italic>in lens formation has been recently documented in knock-out mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>] that develop otherwise normally in the nervous system. In the same mice, genetic redundancy has hampered the analysis of mab-21 gene function in retinal development. However, antisense studies have shown that inhibition of <italic>mab-21 </italic>leads to disruption of the retinal anlage, where the gene is strongly expressed in a territory overlapping with the <italic>Bmp4 </italic>and <italic>Xvent2 </italic>expression domain. Recent studies have shown that BMP signaling plays a relevant role in guiding morphogenesis along the dorsoventral axis of the chick [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>] and <italic>Xenopus </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>] retina.

Roles exerted by BMP signaling molecules in these territories are starting to emerge, and appear relevant to the induction and patterning of dorsal mesencephalic structures (roof plate) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>], and, more ventrally, to the differentiation of dopaminergic precursors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>].</p><p>Throughout the hindbrain and spinal cord, <italic>Mab21l2 </italic>is expressed mostly in dorsal territories.

BMP signaling molecules are coexpressed with <italic>Mab21l2 </italic>at several of those sites, and their developmental roles have been at least partially addressed: as an example, granule cell specification can be induced by BMP7 overexpression in the dorsal and ventral rhombencephalon [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. BMP7 is homologous to BMP2 and BMP4, and its signal can be transduced by SMAD1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>].

Further work is clearly required to determine if MAB21L2 binds DNA, what its binding specificity is, or if it only exerts its effect in a DNA-binding-independent fashion.
