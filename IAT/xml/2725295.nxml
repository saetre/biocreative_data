It consists of an N-terminal portion of NUP98 fused to the homeodomain of HOXA9 and is believed to act as an aberrant transcription factor that binds DNA through the homeodomain. Here we show that NUP98-HOXA9 can regulate transcription without binding to DNA. In order to determine the relative contributions of the NUP98 and HOXA9 portions to the transforming ability of NUP98-HOXA9, the effects of NUP98-HOXA9 on primary human CD34&#x0002b; cells were dissected and compared to those of wild-type HOXA9. In contrast to previous findings in mouse cells, HOXA9 had only mild effects on the differentiation and proliferation of primary human hematopoietic cells. The ability of NUP98-HOXA9 to disrupt the differentiation of primary human CD34&#x0002b; cells was found to depend primarily on the NUP98 portion, whereas induction of long-term proliferation required both the NUP98 moiety and an intact homeodomain. Using oligonucleotide microarrays in primary human CD34&#x0002b; cells, a group of genes was identified whose dysregulation by NUP98-HOXA9 is attributable primarily to the NUP98 portion. These include <italic>RAP1A</italic>, <italic>HEY1</italic>, and <italic>PTGS2</italic> (<italic>COX-2</italic>). Their functions may reflect the contribution of the NUP98 moiety of NUP98-HOXA9 to leukemic transformation. Taken together, these results suggest that the effects of NUP98-HOXA9 on gene transcription and cell transformation are mediated by at least two distinct mechanisms: one that involves promoter binding through the homeodomain with direct transcriptional activation, and another that depends predominantly on the NUP98 moiety and does not involve direct DNA binding.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="14"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>NUP98-HOXA9 is an oncogenic fusion protein associated with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) that consists of an N-terminal, FG repeat-rich portion of the nucleoporin NUP98 fused to the homeodomain region of HOXA9 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006719-Borrow1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006719-Nakamura1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>.

However, the effects of HOXA9 on the proliferation and differentiation of primary human hematopoietic cells have not been reported.</p><p>Several lines of evidence suggest that NUP98-HOXA9 may have effects over and above those mediated by the homeodomain. For example, in mice, the leukemia induced by NUP98-HOXA9 is preceded by a myeloproliferative phase whereas leukemia caused by overexpression of wild-type HOXA9 is not preceded by myeloproliferation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006719-Kroon1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>; and the <italic>in vitro</italic> effects of NUP98-HOXA9 on the differentiation and proliferation of mouse hematopoietic precursors are more profound than those of HOXA9 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006719-Calvo1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>. In addition, NUP98-HOXA9 modulates the expression of a larger set of genes than HOXA9 in a myeloid cell line <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006719-Ghannam1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>. Finally, while all leukemogenic NUP98 fusions contain an almost identical N-terminal portion of NUP98, most of them lack a homeodomain <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006719-Romana1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>, suggesting that homeodomain-independent mechanisms may contribute to leukemogenesis by NUP98 chimeras.</p><p>In a recent study, a mutation that abolishes DNA binding (N51S) was introduced into the homeodomain of another leukemogenic NUP98 fusion, NUP98-HOXD13, and its effect on the gene expression profile in mouse hematopoietic cells was examined. It was found that the homeodomain mutant was still capable of dysregulating a subset of the genes dysregulated by NUP98-HOXD13 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006719-Palmqvist1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref> indicating that some of the aberrant gene expression is independent of DNA binding by the homeodomain. However, it is not clear whether this homeodomain-independent dysregulation occurs at the transcriptional level and whether it has any functional significance in terms of leukemic transformation. These are among the questions we sought to answer in the current study. We first introduced the N51S mutation into NUP98-HOXA9 and showed that the mutant was capable of regulating transcription in a myeloid cell line without significant binding to DNA. We then compared this mutant to another mutant lacking the NUP98 portion as well as to intact NUP98-HOXA9 and wild-type HOXA9 for their ability to transform primary human CD34&#x0002b; hematopoietic precursors. The results show that most of the effects of NUP98-HOXA9 on differentiation are dependent on the NUP98 portion and are not abolished by the N51S mutation. Gene expression profiling in primary human CD34&#x0002b; cells identified a subset of the NUP98-HOXA9 target genes whose dysregulation requires the NUP98 moiety and appears to be independent of the homeodomain. The possible role of these genes in the transformation of primary human hematopoietic cells by NUP98-HOXA9 is discussed.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Two distinct modes of transcriptional regulation by NUP98-HOXA9</title><p>To determine the role of homeodomain-DNA binding in the regulation of transcription by NUP98-HOXA9, luciferase reporter assays were carried out using the K562 human myeloid cell line.

The resulting mutant, NUP98-HOXA9/N51S, was expressed at a level equivalent to NUP98-HOXA9 in K562 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006719-g002">Fig. 2B</xref>). NUP98-HOXA9/N51S was tested for its effects on transcription from the <italic>KBTBD10</italic> and <italic>PLN</italic> promoters. NUP98-HOXA9/N51S did not transactivate the <italic>KBTBD10</italic> promoter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006719-g003">Fig. 3A</xref>); but surprisingly, it was able to transactivate the <italic>PLN</italic> promoter to the same extent as NUP98-HOXA9 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006719-g003">Fig. 3B</xref>). This suggests that NUP98-HOXA9 transactivates the <italic>PLN</italic> promoter by a mechanism that does not involve direct DNA binding. To confirm this, chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) studies were carried out. First, deletion studies of the <italic>KBTBD10</italic> and <italic>PLN</italic> promoters were used to identify promoter regions responsible for transactivation by NUP98-HOXA9 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006719-g004">Fig. 4A, 4B</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006719-g005">5A</xref>) and PCR primers were chosen for ChIP accordingly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006719-g005">Fig. 5A</xref>). Flag-tagged versions of NUP98-HOXA9 and NUP98-HOXA9/N51S were introduced into K562 cells by nucleofection. Chromatin was immunoprecipitated with anti-Flag antibody and the indicated segments of the <italic>KBTBD10</italic> and <italic>PLN</italic> promoters were amplified by PCR. NUP98-HOXA9 showed association with the <italic>KBTBD10</italic> promoter whereas NUP98-HOXA9/N51S did not show significant binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006719-g005">Fig. 5B</xref>). Neither NUP98-HOXA9 nor NUP98-HOXA9/N51S showed significant binding to the segment of the <italic>PLN</italic> promoter that is transactivated by NUP98-HOXA9 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006719-g005">Fig. 5B</xref>). There may be very weak binding of NUP98-HOXA9 to the segment amplified by the PLN (3) primer set. However, unlike the binding to the <italic>KBTBD10</italic> promoter, this is difficult to distinguish from background and is not affected by the N51S mutation. Therefore it is unlikely to represent direct specific binding of the homeodomain to the promoter, but it could represent a very weak indirect interaction between NUP98-HOXA9 and the <italic>PLN</italic> promoter that is difficult to detect by our ChIP assays. Overall, the ChIP findings and the results of luciferase assays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006719-g003">Fig. 3A and 3B</xref>) show that transactivation of the <italic>KBTBD10</italic> promoter correlates with DNA binding whereas transactivation of the <italic>PLN</italic> promoter does not.</p><fig id="pone-0006719-g002" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0006719.g002</object-id><label>Figure 2</label><caption><title>Expression of the NUP98-HOXA9/N51S mutant in K562 cells.</title><p>(A) Schematic representation of the N51S mutation in the homeodomain of HA-tagged NUP98-HOXA9.

The ability of NUP98-HOXA9/N51S to recapitulate most of the effects of NUP98-HOXA9 suggests that the disruption of hematopoietic differentiation by NUP98-HOXA9 is largely attributable to the NUP98 moiety and does not require DNA binding by the homeodomain. The fact that the isolated HOXA9 moiety (HOXA9&#x00394;N) had no effect on differentiation shows that the NUP98 moiety is necessary for disruption of human hematopoietic differentiation.

One possibility is that the homeodomain would interact with promoters indirectly by dimerizing with another DNA-binding factor. Such indirect binding may be difficult to detect with our ChIP assays and cannot be entirely excluded as a mechanism for the transactivation of the <italic>PLN</italic> promoter. Another possibility is that the homeodomain may disrupt transcription by titrating away transcription factors through dimerization. The remaining 26 probes represent 23 genes that appear to be homeodomain-independent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006719-g011">Fig. 11A</xref>) and their dysregulation requires the NUP98 moiety of NUP98-HOXA9. Based on the functions of the NUP98 moiety, an intriguing possibility is that expression of these genes may be dysregulated by a disruption in nucleocytoplasmic transport. The NUP98 portion of NUP98 fusions contains most or all of its FG repeats, which interact with nuclear transport carriers that mediate the nucleocytoplasmic transport of proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006719-Fontoura1">&#x0005b;54&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006719-Radu1">&#x0005b;55&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006719-Yaseen1">&#x0005b;56&#x0005d;</xref>.

Cytospin preparations of cells harvested from the CFC plates were stained with Giemsa and a 500-cell differential count was performed using an Olympus BX51 microscope (Olympus America, Center Valley, PA, USA). Cells with blast and promyelocyte morphology were counted as primitive; those with myelocyte/metamyelocyte morphology as intermediate myeloid; those with band, segmented neutrophil, monocyte, and macrophage morphology as mature myeloid; those with intermediate hemoglobinization as intermediate erythroid; and those with full hemoglobinization as mature erythroid. Photomicrographs were taken with an Olympus DP71 camera with a 60&#x000d7;oil objective.</p></sec><sec id="s4d"><title>Flow cytometry</title><p>Flow cytometry was performed on a FACScan flow cytometer (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA, USA) upgraded to 5 colors and two lasers, and analyzed using FCS3 Express (De Novo Software, Thornhill, Ontario, Canada) and FlowJO v8.6.3 (Tree Star, Inc., Ashland, OR) software. The antibodies used for these studies were CD11b (phycoerythrin-conjugated clone ICRF44) from eBioscience (San Diego, CA, USA); CD235a (allophycocyanin-conjugated clone GA-R2) from BD (Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA); and CD33 (allophycocyanin-conjugated clone D3HL60.251) and CD45 (phycoerythrin-Cy7-conjugated clone J.33) from Beckman Coulter (Miami, FL, USA).</p></sec><sec id="s4e"><title>Microarray analysis of primary human CD34&#x0002b; cells</title><p>Sorted GFP-positive cells were snap-frozen 3 days after transduction and submitted to the Siteman Cancer Center Laboratory for Clinical Genomics where total RNA was isolated and target preparation and microarray hybridization were performed. Labeled targets were hybridized to Affymetrix HG-U133 Plus 2.0 GeneChip microarrays. Data were merged with the updated gene annotation data for each probe set on the array using Spotfire DecisionSite 9.1.1 for Functional Genomics (Spotfire, Somerville, MA). Probe sets were filtered according to present/absent calls and the sets that were absent across all chips were filtered from the analysis. The fold change of each probe set was calculated by dividing the absolute signal intensity from NUP98-HOXA9, NUP98-HOXA9/N51S, HOXA9, and HOXA9&#x00394;N samples by that of the control sample (vector only). Probes scored as increasing and absent in the numerator, and those scored as decreasing and absent in the denominator were also filtered out. The experiment was performed 2 independent times. Probe sets induced or repressed by 1.74-fold or greater in both experiments were considered differentially expressed. Gene intersection lists were generated using Spotfire DecisionSite 9.1.1 for Functional Genomics. All microarray data reported in the manuscript are described in accordance with MIAME guidelines.</p></sec><sec id="s4f"><title>Luciferase assay</title><p>Cells were transfected by electroporation using a Bio-Rad GenePulser with 10 &#x000b5;g pGL4.11 vector or pGL4.11 driven by the indicated promoters and 20 &#x000b5;g of either empty pTracer-CMV/Bsd vector, or vector expressing HA-tagged NUP98-HOXA9 or NUP98-HOXA9/N51S.
