This 406bp promoter region was dissected into short, overlapping, double-stranded oligonucleotides to facilitate identification of the bound proteins. A variety of sites, for both known and previously undescribed DNA-binding proteins, are occupied in vitro. Some of these factors were investigated in detail. Two forms of nuclear factor I (NFI), which have different recognition site affinities, are present in nuclear extracts from lactating mammary gland and bind to at least 5 sites in this BLG control element. In addition, a factor (milk protein binding factor, MPBF) which is specific to extracts from both mouse and sheep lactating mammary gland binds to 3 BLG promoter sites and may be a milk protein gene transcription factor.</p><sec><title>Images</title><fig id="F1"><graphic xlink:href="nar00103-0239-a" xlink:role="6604"/></fig><fig id="F2"><graphic xlink:href="nar00103-0240-a" xlink:role="6605"/></fig><fig id="F3"><graphic xlink:href="nar00103-0240-b" xlink:role="6605"/></fig><fig id="F4"><graphic xlink:href="nar00103-0241-a" xlink:role="6606"/></fig><fig id="F5"><graphic xlink:href="nar00103-0241-b" xlink:role="6606"/></fig><fig id="F6"><graphic xlink:href="nar00103-0242-a" xlink:role="6607"/></fig></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><supplementary-material content-type="scanned-pages"><graphic xlink:href="nar00103-0238.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="6603"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00103-0239.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="6604"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00103-0240.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="6605"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00103-0241.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="6606"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00103-0242.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="6607"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00103-0243.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="6608"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00103-0244.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="6609"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00103-0245.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="6610"/></supplementary-material></body></article>
