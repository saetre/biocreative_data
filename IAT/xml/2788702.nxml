In diabetes and Alzheimer's disease, pathological progression is accelerated by activation of RAGE. However, how RAGE influences gross behavioral activity patterns in basal condition has not been addressed to date. In search for a functional role of RAGE in normal mice, a series of standard behavioral tests were performed on adult RAGE knockout (KO) mice. We observed a solid increase of home cage activity in RAGE KO. In addition, auditory startle response assessment resulted in a higher sensitivity to auditory signal and increased prepulse inhibition in KO mice. There were no significant differences between KO and wild types in behavioral tests for spatial memory and anxiety, as tested by Morris water maze, classical fear conditioning, and elevated plus maze. Our results raise a possibility that systemic therapeutic treatments to occlude RAGE activation may have adverse effects on general activity levels or sensitivity to auditory stimuli.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="7"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>The receptor for advanced glycation end-products (RAGE) is a multi-ligand receptor that belongs to the immunoglobulin superfamily of cell surface receptors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008309-Neeper1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008309-Schmidt1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>.

RAGE KO mice displayed &#x0223c;30&#x00025; higher activity in darkness on day 1 and persistently higher activity during the seven days of observation. In addition, auditory startle response assessment resulted in a higher sensitivity to auditory signal in KO mice. The higher sensitivity to auditory signal provides an explanation for the increased prepulse inhibition ratio in KO animals and auditory cue-dependent classical fear conditioning. The animals' curiosity or anxiety should be excluded from the subject of the difference, as the open field test and the elevated plus maze test yielded no significantly different scores.</p><p>Our results indicate that deletion of RAGE has minimal effects on the animals' spatial learning ability (as tested with Morris water maze and context-dependent classical fear conditioning). Therefore, it appears that RAGE does not have a critical importance in synaptic plasticity of the hippocampus and the associated areas. In fact, long-term potentiation in the entorhinal cortex has been reported to be not affected in RAGE KO mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008309-Origlia1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>. By contrast, genetic manipulations of S100B, a ligand for RAGE, result in more visible effects on learning and memory. S100B KO mice improve performance in spatial learning and become more sensitive to context-dependent fear conditioning <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008309-Nishiyama1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>, whereas S100B overexpressing transgenic mice have inferior performance in spatial learning <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008309-Gerlai1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>. The behavioral differences between RAGE KO and S100B KO imply that RAGE may not be a crucial receptor of S100B for learning and memory. It is, however, noted that attenuation of kainate-induced gamma oscillations in S100B KO <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008309-Sakatani2">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref> has recently been demonstrated to be dependent on activation of RAGE <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008309-Sakatani1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>, suggesting a role of RAGE in hyperactive brain states. One potential caveat is that the mice used in the current study have been backcrossed eight times to C57BL6, so that the expected percentage of genetic material from the original strain is below 0.4&#x00025;.</p><p>As the KO phenotypes were dependent on presentation of sensory stimulus, RAGE may play an active role in sensory organs or the brain.

The resultant RAGE KO mice were then backcrossed to C57BL/6J (Charles River Japan) for eight generations. Two independent populations of ten mature male RAGE KO mice and ten mature male wild type (WT) RAGE (&#x0002b;/&#x0002b;) mice were used. Littermates and non-littermates were mixed. The first group consisted of mixed yet age-matched population ranging from postnatal eight to eighteen weeks. In the second group, the age was more tightly matched so that the ages of the mice were all eight weeks. Mice were genotyped prior to the behavioral experiments, but the identities of the mice were not exposed to the experimenter during the behavioral experiments. Mice were housed individually before transferring to the behavioral laboratory. The light condition was 12/12 hour light-dark cycle with light phase starting at 8:00 a.m. The temperature and humidity of the laboratory were maintained at 22&#x02013;23&#x000b0;C and 50&#x02013;60&#x00025;, respectively. Food and water were freely available for entire period of the home cage activity measurement and when the mice were housed in their home cage. Large blunt tongs wrapped with silicon rubber were used to handle mice to avoid individual variability in the handling procedure. All of the experiments were conducted in the light phase.</p></sec><sec id="s4b"><title>PCR Genotyping</title><p>Tissue samples from the ear were dissolved in a buffer containing (50 mM KCl, 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.3, 2 mM MgCl2, 0.1 mg/ml gelatin, 0.45&#x00025; NP-40, 0.45&#x00025; Tween-20, 0.5 mg/ml proteinase K) at 55&#x000b0;C for overnight.
