HD, together with 8 other diseases including the Spinocerebellar Ataxias (SCAs), DRPLA and SBMA, is classified as a CAG repeat disease. Expansion of the CAG repeat in exon 1 of the htt gene to greater than 35 repeats results in a disease-causing expanded polyglutamine tract in the Htt protein. Mutant Htt is aggregation-prone, and acquires a toxic gain-of-function (GOF) by interfering with, or disrupting, normal cellular pathways such as the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS), transcriptional regulation, and signaling pathways <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007275-Gil1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>. In HD, medium spiny neurons of the striatum are selectively affected, leading to the clinical features of the disease including chorea, cognitive abnormalities and psychiatric disturbance.</p><p>Researchers have long been aware of the benefits of using <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> to study human disease, particular diseases of the nervous system. The fly is particularly amenable to sophisticated genetic approaches and the ability to temporally and spatially control the expression of transgenes is a powerful advantage of this system. CAG repeat diseases, caused by a toxic GOF, can be modeled in the fly by expression of the mutant protein. <italic>Drosophila</italic> models for SCA 1, SCA 3, MJD, SMBA and DRPLA have been successfully established and mimic various aspects of this group of diseases such as the presence of mutant protein aggregates, progressive neurodegeneration and behavioural abnormalities <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007275-Celotto1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007275-Sang1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007275-Bilen1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007275-Marsh1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>In recent years, RNAi has become a powerful approach to study gene loss-of-function (LOF). The relative ease with which genes can be ablated in insect cells has lead researchers to carry out large-scale and even genome-wide analyses to study the effects of gene LOF on various cellular pathways <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007275-Ramadan1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007275-Clemens1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>. The problem of off-target-effects (OTEs) has raised some concern over previously published results, and highlighted the importance of thorough validation of candidates identified in large scale RNAi screens through a variety of techniques <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007275-Kulkarni1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007275-Ma1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>We have combined a high throughput RNAi screen with <italic>in vivo</italic> candidate validation to identify potential new regulators of mutant human Htt aggregation. Although there are some controversies about polyglutamine aggregate and cellular toxicity, aggregate formation is a main pathological feature and detecting modulators of aggregation may help our understanding of the pathological process of Huntington disease. By establishing an <italic>in vitro</italic> model of HD in <italic>Drosophila</italic> cells stably expressing htt exon 1 fused to EGFP with an expanded polyQ tract (62Q), we screened 7200 dsRNA molecules for their effects on mutant htt aggregation. We identified 404 candidate dsRNAs that could either suppress or enhance aggregation. We carried out secondary and tertiary screening in our cell culture model to select the strongest candidates and investigated these candidates further using <italic>in vivo</italic> models of HD established for this purpose. Transgenic flies were established that express htt exon1 fused to EGFP with either normal length (18Q) or expanded (62Q or 152Q) and either with or without an NLS for nuclear targeting.</p><p>To our knowledge, this is the first <italic>Drosophila</italic> RNAi screen for modifiers of a mutant human aggregating protein. We have identified and thoroughly validated 21 candidate genes in our study using <italic>in vivo</italic> fly models of HD.

Large, cytoplasmic inclusions form upon expression of Nhtt(62Q)EGFP. Scale bar represents 18.75 &#x000b5;m (A). BG2-Nhtt(62Q)EGFP cells were treated with 7200 dsRNAs and the mean number of inclusions/cell detected by ArrayScan&#x000ae; across duplicate treatments were used to calculate the z score for each dsRNA. The mean z score for each dsRNA is represented as a scatter plot (B). Screen reproducibility across two independent treatments is shown (C).</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="pone.0007275.g001"/></fig><p>For large-scale screening, we needed a rapid method to detect the number of intracellular inclusions in the cell. The Cellomics ArrayScan&#x000ae; is able to detect intracellular objects based on a user-defined protocol. We devised a protocol to count the number of EGFP-positive inclusions and also estimate inclusion size based on the number of pixels of EGFP fluorescence for the objects detected in stable BG2- Nhtt(62Q)EGFP cells. We tested the efficacy of RNAi by treating BG2- Nhtt(18Q)EGFP cells with dsRNA against EGFP. Efficient knockdown was achieved within 48 hours of treatment using the bathing method (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0007275.s002">Figure S1A</xref>) and led to the reduction of both EGFP-positive cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0007275.s002">Figure S1B</xref>) and EGFP-positive inclusions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0007275.s002">Figure S1C</xref>) as detected by ArrayScan&#x000ae; in BG2-Nhtt(62Q)EGFP cells. Given our aim to identify candidate molecules that could modify aggregation of a human disease protein using a <italic>Drosophila</italic> cell culture model, we chose to screen the Open Biosystems RNAi library because it is enriched for <italic>Drosophila</italic> orthologues of mammalian proteins. We prepared dsRNA using dsDNA templates provided in the library, as described in <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>. Prior to beginning large-scale screening, we ran a test plate through the treatment protocol to ensure that the dsRNAs made were able to ablate gene expression. We selected the library plate containing dsRNA against diap1, a gene essential for the survival of <italic>Drosophila</italic> cells. Cells treated with diap1 dsRNA had significantly reduced cell viability (22&#x00025; compared with plate average) demonstrating that the method of treatment and quality of dsRNAs was sufficient for screening (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0007275.s002">Figure S1D</xref>). We therefore proceeded to screen the 7200 library dsRNAs (75 96-well plates) in duplicate to identify dsRNAs that could either enhance or suppress Nhtt(62Q)EGFP aggregation using the Cellomics ArrayScan&#x000ae;. Candidates were selected based on their calculated z score, indicating the extent of difference from the plate mean in terms of standard deviations. An outline of our screening approach is shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0007275.s002">Figure S1E</xref>.</p><p>Of the 7200 dsRNAs screened, we identified 404 candidates that modified Nhtt(62Q)EGFP aggregation. Of these, 32 had positive z scores (&#x02265;2) indicating that the dsRNA could enhance aggregation, and 372 candidates had negative z scores (&#x02264;&#x02212;2) resulting from suppression of aggregation by dsRNA treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007275-g001">Figure 1B</xref>). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007275-g001">Figure 1C</xref> shows the screen reproducibility over the two individual treatment assays. Using FlyBase and FLIGHT database batch download options, we automatically retrieved Gene Ontology (GO) terms for each candidate and then manually assigned functional groups based on this information. Interestingly, functional groups represented by aggregate-suppressing dsRNAs were largely distinct from functional groups of aggregate-enhancing dsRNAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007275-g002">Figure 2</xref>). Our full candidate list with z scores, viability scores and functional group categorization is presented as an excel spreadsheet in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0007275.s010">Data S1</xref>.</p><fig id="pone-0007275-g002" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0007275.g002</object-id><label>Figure 2</label><caption><title>Functional categorization of primary screen candidates.</title><p>404 candidates identified through primary RNAi screening were placed into functional groups based on Gene Ontology terms for Biological Process and Molecular Function retrieved from FlyBase and FLIGHT databases.

Using the FLIGHT database to retrieve the RNAi probe sequence for each of our candidates, and then determining the number of predicted OTEs using the DRSC website tool, we were able to correlate our results with the number of OTEs in our candidate list. Transcription factors (TFs) are notoriously sensitive to potential OTEs due the prevalence of trinucleotide repeats in many TF-encoding genes. Not surprisingly, therefore, we found that the category representing &#x02018;Specific Transcription&#x02019; was the most severely reduced when candidates with more than 10 predicted OTEs were excluded (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0007275.s003">Figure S2</xref>). Exclusion of such candidates impacted the aggregate-suppressing candidates most notably, accounting for, in part, the skew in our data. Of note, we found a significant negative correlation between cell viability and the number of predicted OTEs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0007275.s004">Figure S3A</xref>) adding further caution to growing data concerning the problems of gene off-targeting in <italic>Drosophila</italic> RNAi experiments. Furthermore, dsRNAs with many predicted OTEs are overrepresented amongst our list of candidates, with 44&#x00025; having more than 10 potential OTEs compared with 5.7&#x00025; of the entire RNAi library (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0007275.s004">Figure S3B</xref>). It is therefore clear that OTEs contribute to false positive candidates in this library.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Secondary screening in 18Q cells</title><p>To eliminate aggregate-suppressing dsRNAs that reduced the number of aggregates simply by reducing transgene expression in our stable cell line, we treated BG2-Nhtt(18Q)EGFP with dsRNAs identified as candidates in our primary screen. Excepting the different cell line used, treatment conditions were the same as for primary screening and ArrayScan&#x000ae; data for the percentage of EGFP-positive cells and EGFP intensity was obtained. We decided to take a stringent approach to candidate pruning and eliminated candidates that did not reduce the percentage of EGFP-positive cells by more than 10&#x00025; compared to the average for a LacZ control. Treatment with a LacZ dsRNA alone reduced the &#x00025; EGFP-positivity compared to untreated cells. At the time of secondary screening, the problem of off-target effects was not fully known. Since this issue came to light, we discovered that the LacZ control dsRNA used in our secondary screen had one predicted off-target. This potentially resulted in the retention of more candidates following secondary screening because the LacZ control showed some decrease in EGFP positivity. We therefore designed a new LacZ control dsRNA (NewLacZ) for all subsequent tertiary screening and biochemical analyses <italic>in vitro</italic>. We also confirmed that the potential off-target gene (pcx) had some effect on EGFP expression and aggregation (data not shown). We could not distinguish between candidate dsRNAs that reduced the Nhtt(18Q)EGFP fluorescence by enhancing proteolytic pathways or by general transcriptional reduction. Thus, some genuine candidates may have been excluded following secondary screening. Functional groups of enhancer and suppressor dsRNA following OTE pruning and secondary screening are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007275-g002">Figure 2</xref> (lower charts).</p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>Tertiary screening using <italic>de novo</italic> designed RNAi probes</title><p>To further confirm the effect of candidate dsRNAs that passed through previous rounds of screening, we independently designed and synthesized dsRNA probes, spanning a different region of the gene from the library dsRNA. <italic>De novo</italic> probes were designed using the E-RNAi software <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007275-Arziman1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>. Primer pairs were selected for their specificity, and for their ability to target all isoforms of a given gene. The size and integrity of PCR amplicons and synthesized dsRNAs were checked by non-denaturing and denaturing agarose gel electrophoresis respectively (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0007275.s005">Figure S4A</xref>). Details of primer design and synthesis of dsRNA probes can be found in Supporting Methods. In the primary screen, we used a relatively high concentration of dsRNA (100 nM). We treated cells with two concentrations, one estimated to be 108 nM, similar to primary screen treatment concentration, and the other lower concentration 43 nM, slightly above the optimal concentration reported <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007275-Clemens1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>. We initially carried out RT-PCR using Htt primers to confirm that dsRNAs do not affect Htt expression and did not see a noticeable difference in expression level of the Htt transgene (data not shown).</p><p>Tertiary screen candidates were also tested for their effects on the expression level of BG2-Nhtt(18Q)EGFP cells. Based on tertiary screening results, we selected 21 candidates that modified mutant Htt aggregation in the direction consistent with primary screening results and eliminated candidates that drastically altered EGFP fluorescence. These 21 candidates were placed into 3 groups, based on the percentage difference in expression level of normal length htt (18Q). Group 1 candidates differed in 18Q expression by no more than 10&#x00025;, group 2 by no more than 20&#x00025; and group 3 by no more than 30&#x00025; (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0007275-t001">Table 1</xref>).

We have found that heterozygous expression of non-nuclear mutant Htt using the GMR-Gal4 driver does not produce a strong external eye phenotype, compared to a moderate loss of pigmentation phenotype caused by NLS-containing mutant Htt (data not shown).

Carrying an extra UAS transgene does not noticeably alter this phenotype (B). Female flies carrying a UAS-CG1109 RNAi transgene on the X chromosome show a clear suppression of the mutant Htt-induced toxicity phenotype, whereas no clear modification is seen in male flies lacking the UAS-CG1109 RNAi transgene (C). Expression of UAS-CG5537 RNAi on the X chromsome (D), and an autosomal UAS-CG4738 RNAi transgene (E) also suppress the mutant Htt-induced degenerative phenotype, with a rescue of pigmentation in these flies. Note: both males and females carry a copy of the for the UAS-CG5537 RNAi transgene as explained in <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>. Flies carrying a UAS-hiw RNAi transgene showed a slight rough eye phenotype that was also observed when coexpressed with normal Htt (F). Overexpression of Rheb resulted in a drastic enhancement of the Htt phenotype with an increase in black necrotic patches, further loss of pigmentation and a rough eye with bristle disorganization (G). Overexpression of Rheb in flies expressing normal Htt also resulted in a rough eye phenotype with a mild loss of pigmentation. The chaperone molecule, dhdJ1 clearly suppressed Htt-induced loss of pigmentation when overexpressed (H).

Our flies, expressing mutant Htt in the eye, were crossed to candidate RNAi or overexpression (OE) stocks.

Furthermore, we observed a clear decrease in the number of necrotic fly eyes in these progeny (data not shown). Although UAS-Hiw RNAi showed some enhancement of the eye phenotype in the preliminary round of screening, we were unable to obtain consistent results with this candidate. However, a slight rough eye with disruption to eye bristles was observed in a mutant Htt-independent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007275-g004">Figure 4F</xref>).

Following our stringent screening method, our final 3 groups of candidates were assessed biochemically by Western Blot analysis and visually by confocal microscopy.</p><p>Our candidates fell into several functional groups, the most notable being transport molecules, including those involved in nuclear transport, and nucleotide processing including RNA metabolism. Nuclear transport has been reported to be important in mutant Htt pathogenesis, with Htt itself reportedly shuttling between the nucleus and the cytoplasm <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007275-Atwal1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007275-Cornett1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>.

Although we identified many genes through RNAi screening with predicted involvement in the Ubiquitin Proteasome System (UPS), most were aggregation-suppressing. This may be due to the essential role of many of these genes, most of which were eliminated by OTE pruning and secondary screening for reduction of Nhtt(18Q)EGFP, although we cannot exclude the possibility that some eliminated dsRNAs might reduce Nhtt(18Q)EGFP expression by enhancing cellular proteolytic activities. Loss of the ubiquitin ligase highwire consistently resulted in an increase in mutant Htt inclusion number and size in our cell culture model of HD and appeared to enhance the eye degeneration phenotype of mutant Htt, although the high degree of phenotypic variability with the UAS-hiw RNAi lines used made it difficult to reach a sure conclusion on the role of this gene in HD pathogenesis. Furthermore, no significant difference was found in the number or size of inclusions in aged adult brains expressing UAS-hiw RNAi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007275-g005">Figure 5</xref>).</p><p>Our screen was biased towards detecting suppressors due to the high aggregation propensity of our cell line. Investigation of aggregation-enhancing dsRNAs with z scores slightly below our &#x0002b;2SD cut-off (z scores between 1.5 and 2) revealed several UPS dsRNAs of the ubiquitin-ligase class. This is consistent with the role played by the UPS system in targeting mutant Htt for degradation.

The <italic>Drosophila</italic> compound eye has long been utilized to assess potential genetic interactions particularly in the fields of apoptosis and degeneration in part because the eye is sensitive to cell loss and produces a visible phenotype when the highly organized ommatidial structure is disrupted. Furthermore, the eye is not essential for viability, allowing genetic interactions to be investigated in the adult, even with highly toxic gene products. We were able to validate the role of several of our gene candidates using the fly eye as a model system. Expression of UAS-CG4738 RNAi and UAS-CG5537 RNAi transgenes resulted in a noticeable and consistent suppression of the loss of pigmentation phenotype caused by heterozygous expression of Nhtt(48Q)EGFP<sup>NLS</sup> and Nhtt(152Q)EGFP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007275-g004">Figure 4</xref>).

Although the eye is valuable as a toxicity model, the relationship between polyglutamine aggregation and toxicity is not clear in the eye. Overexpression of the heat shock protein 40 homologue, dhdJ1, demonstrates a drastic suppression of ataxin 1-induced toxicity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007275-KazemiEsfarjani1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref> and in our hands, this same transgene resulted in suppression of mutant Htt-induced toxicity. However, suppression of polyglutamine toxicity was independent of a visible change in ataxin-1 aggregation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007275-KazemiEsfarjani1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>. We therefore set out to assess the role of selected candidates in aggregation of mutant Htt in aged adult fly brain. Our aggregation model, expressing one copy of a UAS-Nhtt(93Q)EGFP transgene using the pan-neuronal driver, elav-Gal4, formed visible inclusions in the brain and optic lobes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007275-g005">Figure 5A</xref>). Although all progeny differed in age by no more than 24 hours, there was a high degree of variation in the number and size of visible inclusions. Nevertheless, we found a significant reduction in the number of inclusions and overall inclusion load by expression of UAS-CG4738 RNAi and UAS-CG5537 RNAi. We could not obtain a clear brain aggregation result for CG1109 due to poor brain quality for all progeny from this cross. CG1109 is a novel gene, recently identified in a primary neuronal RNAi screen for genes required for neurogenesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007275-Bai1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>. CG1109 may therefore be essential for neuron function and pan-neuronal expression of an RNAi construct may be toxic.</p><p>We were unable to detect a significant reduction in mutant Htt inclusions in the brain by overexpression of dhdJ1. It is possible that dhdJ1 requires some cofactor for its function as a heat shock protein that may be lacking in elav-positive neurons in the fly brain. However, given that so many studies use the eye for validation of polyglutamine modifiers, it should be noted that perhaps not all such modifiers will prove valid in models for mutant Htt aggregation. Our strongest candidates, CG4738 and CG5537 were validated by two independent RNAi stocks in the eye model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007275-g004">Figure 4</xref> and data not shown).</p><p>Although some corresponding results were observed between suppressor activity in the cellular system and reducing toxicity in eye, the discrepancy is not unexpected. Even in our cellular system, based on the inclusion formation and cell viability, a distinct correlation was not confirmed (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0007275-t001">Table 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0007275.s008">Figure S7</xref>). Previously, drugs have been screened for their effect on polyglutamine aggregate formation using cellular models. One drug inhibited aggregation and suppressed neurodegeration <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007275-Zhang1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007275-Desai1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>. Another compound was reported to promote inclusion formation and prevent the huntingtin-mediated proteasome dysfunction, which is related to cell toxicity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007275-Bodner1">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007275-Jana1">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref>. These results and the existence of heterogeneous aggregate species such as fibrils and oligomers suggest that the decrease of inclusions might correlate to the change of some specific toxic species of aggregates depending on the system used.</p><p>We further examined the functional relationship among mouse homologues of the selected candidates (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0007275.s009">Figure S8</xref>). The main gene group includes nucleotide processing, nucleoporin and signaling. The signaling genes are related to the autophagy system, which could degrade polyglutamine aggregates. The role of other major groups on aggregate formation, such as genes for nucleotide processing and nucleoporin, is unknown. Since the main localization of these gene products is nucleus, their function may be related to the formation of nuclear inclusions. Reduction of the nucleoporin 160 protein (CG4738) consistently rescued Htt-induced toxicity and aggregation in our cell line and <italic>in vivo</italic>. It is feasible, however, that a nucleoporin may act as a docking site for the accumulation and aggregation of mutant Htt. Further work remains to elucidate the role of our candidates in the mammalian system and their mechanism of action.</p><p>In summary, we have carried out a thorough screen for modifiers of mutant human Htt aggregation using new models of HD established in cultured <italic>Drosophila</italic> cells and in the fly.
