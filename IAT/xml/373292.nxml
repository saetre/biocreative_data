Besides their central role in protein biosynthesis, tRNAs have other important functions in the cell, such as targeting proteins for degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh182c1">1</xref>). tRNAs are first transcribed as precursors containing additional 5&#x02032; and 3&#x02032; sequences which have to be removed to yield functional tRNA molecules. Removal of the 5&#x02032; leader sequence by the ubiquitous enzyme RNase P has been studied in detail (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh182c2">2</xref>). In contrast, we know little about the generation of the mature tRNA 3&#x02032; end (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh182c3">3</xref>).</p><p>Maturation of pre-tRNA 3&#x02032; ends in bacteria differs from organism to organism; in <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>, it is a multistep process involving endo- and exonucleases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh182c4">4</xref>), whereas in <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic> the mature tRNA 3&#x02032; end of CCA-less pre-tRNAs is generated by a single endonucleolytic cut, catalysed by RNase Z (E.C. 3.1.26.11) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh182c5">5</xref>). Archaeal tRNA precursors are also processed at the tRNA 3&#x02032; end by an RNase Z activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh182c6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh182c7">7</xref>). Most eukaryotic systems have been reported to employ endonucleases for cleaving pre-tRNAs directly 3&#x02032; to the discriminator, although a few exonucleolytic pathways have also been reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh182c8">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh182c20">20</xref>). Exclusively endonucleolytic processing 3&#x02032; to the discriminator has been observed in eukaryotic organelles (mitochondria and chloroplasts) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh182c21">21</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh182c27">27</xref>). In mammals and fruit flies the mitochondrial DNA is transcribed into only two long primary transcripts (one for each strand) which contain the tRNA genes interspersed between the different mRNA and rRNA genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh182c28">28</xref>). Here tRNA processing is thus also vital for releasing functional mRNAs and rRNAs from the primary transcript, as first suggested for human mitochondria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh182c29">29</xref>).</p><p>In plants, nuclear RNase Z is not only required for tRNA maturation but also for snoRNA maturation, at least where a snoRNA is encoded downstream from a tRNA on a dicistronic locus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh182c30">30</xref>), in which case the snoRNA is released from the primary transcript through endonucleolytic cleavage by RNase Z.</p><p>The recent identification of the first RNase Z protein and gene sequences now allows the identification of orthologous proteins in all three kingdoms: bacteria, archaea and eukarya (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh182c7">7</xref>). These orthologous RNase Z proteins belong to a conserved group of proteins, the ELAC1/ELAC2 group (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh182c31">31</xref>). The shorter ELAC1 proteins (ranging from 250 to 350 amino acids) can be found in representatives of all three kingdoms, whereas the longer ELAC2 proteins (700&#x02013;900 amino acids) are exclusively found in eukaryotic organisms.</p><p>In <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>, the sole RNase Z ortholog is an ELAC2 protein encoded by <italic>JhI-1</italic>, a juvenile hormone (JH) regulated gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh182c32">32</xref>). JH serves a number of important functions in insects, such as regulation of moulting during pre-adult development, and control of reproductive maturation and sexual behaviour in adults (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh182c33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh182c34">34</xref>). At the cellular level, JH is implicated in cell proliferation and differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh182c35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh182c36">36</xref>). The molecular mechanism of JH action is not yet known, and there have been few genes described so far whose expression is directly affected by JH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh182c37">37</xref>). The <italic>JhI-1</italic> gene is rapidly and specifically induced in <italic>Drosophila</italic> cultured cells in the presence of JH. Accumulation of <italic>JhI-1</italic> transcripts requires the continuous presence of hormone, suggesting direct regulation.</p><p>All data published to date concerning the eukaryotic tRNA 3&#x02032; processing enzyme RNase Z have been <italic>in vitro</italic> studies. Here we show for the first time that the biological role of eukaryotic RNase Z is indeed tRNA 3&#x02032; processing and that the <italic>Drosophila JhI-1</italic> locus encodes the mitochondrial and nuclear tRNA 3&#x02032; processing enzyme RNase Z. Furthermore, we find that tRNA 5&#x02032; end processing precedes tRNA 3&#x02032; end processing <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Expression of <italic>Drosophila</italic> RNase Z</title><p>The <italic>D.melanogaster</italic> homolog of <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> RNase Z (accession no.

A second methionine residue is present at position 24 close to the predicted cleavage site of the N-terminal target sequence (position 26), suggesting that the <italic>JhI-1</italic> gene may encode both a nuclear and a mitochondrial form of RNase Z. With 766 amino acids, the protein is almost three times as long as the originally identified RNase Z enzymes from the plant <italic>A.thaliana</italic> and the archaeon <italic>Methanococcus janaschii</italic>, and is thus a representative of the long form of RNase Z enzymes (ELAC2 proteins). Interestingly, the long RNase Z variants are only found in eukaryotic organisms and the relative distribution of ELAC1/ELAC2 proteins varies among eukaryotes. <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> and <italic>D.melanogaster</italic> contain only a single RNase Z protein (an ELAC2 protein), while <italic>Homo sapiens</italic> has one ELAC1 and one ELAC2 and <italic>A.thaliana</italic> encodes two ELAC1 and two ELAC2 proteins. ELAC1 and ELAC2 proteins belong to a single group since the C-terminal part of the ELAC2 proteins shows high sequence similarity to the ELAC1 proteins (including the highly conserved PDE domain (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh182f1">1</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh182c31">31</xref>). While it has been shown that the ELAC1 proteins and the C-terminal parts of the ELAC2 proteins have tRNA 3&#x02032; processing activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh182c7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh182c42">42</xref>), the function of the long N-terminal domain of the ELAC2 proteins is not clear. Long ELAC2 proteins appear to have evolved from duplication of the short ELAC1 proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh182c31">31</xref>). Consistent with this theory, representatives of the ELAC1 proteins &#x0005b;<italic>E.coli</italic> RNase Z (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh182c43">43</xref>) and <italic>A.thaliana</italic> RNase Z (B.Sp&#x000e4;th and A.Marchfelder, unpublished data)&#x0005d; are homodimers, and the yeast ELAC2p N-terminal part (which possesses a slightly altered PDE domain) alone can process tRNAs at their 3&#x02032; ends (B.Sp&#x000e4;th <italic>et al</italic>., in preparation).</p></sec><sec><title>Recombinant fruit fly RNase Z catalyses 3&#x02032; end maturation of nuclear pre-tRNAs</title><p>To analyse whether the <italic>JhI-1</italic> gene indeed codes for a tRNA 3&#x02032; processing endonuclease, we expressed the cDNA in insect Sf9 cells. The resulting recombinant protein has an apparent molecular weight of 92 kDa, somewhat larger than the calculated molecular weight of 83 kDa (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh182f2">2</xref>A). Incubation with <italic>Drosophila</italic> nuclear pre-tRNA<sup>His</sup> shows that the recombinant enzyme indeed cleaves the pre-tRNA to yield two products, the tRNA and the 3&#x02032; trailer (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh182f2">2</xref>B). Both products are the same size as the cleavage products generated with the fruit fly extract (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh182f2">2</xref>B), which cleaves pre-tRNAs directly 3&#x02032; to the discriminator (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh182c20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh182c38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh182c44">44</xref>). Thus recombinant <italic>Drosophila</italic> RNase Z is capable of converting a nuclear pre-tRNA into a 3&#x02032; trailer and a 3&#x02032; mature tRNA ready for CCA addition. Based on the sequence homology and tRNA 3&#x02032; endonucleolytic activity, we conclude that <italic>JhI-1</italic> encodes <italic>Drosophila</italic> RNase Z. We therefore re-designate the <italic>JhI-1</italic> gene as <italic>dRNase Z</italic>, <italic>Drosophila</italic> tRNA 3&#x02032;-processing endonuclease.</p></sec><sec><title>Mitochondrial pre-tRNAs are also cleaved by <italic>Drosophila</italic> RNase Z <italic>in vitro</italic></title><p>The mitochondrial genome of <italic>D.melanogaster</italic> encodes 22 tRNAs which punctuate the mRNA and rRNA genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh182c45">45</xref>), suggesting that the tRNAs must be precisely excised from the long polycistronic bi-directional primary transcripts. Sorting servers predict that the lone <italic>Drosophila</italic> RNase Z is mitochondrially targeted, thus <italic>Drosophila</italic> RNase Z is likely to also be the mitochondrial tRNA 3&#x02032; processing enzyme. To investigate whether mitochondrial tRNAs can be cleaved by <italic>Drosophila</italic> RNase Z, we incubated a mitochondrial pre-tRNA<sup>Ile</sup> with recombinant dRNase Z (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh182f2">2</xref>C). The mitochondrial pre-tRNA is efficiently converted into two products, the tRNA and the 3&#x02032; trailer.</p></sec><sec><title>Targeted disruption of <bold><italic>dRNase Z</italic></bold> expression in S2 cultured cells</title><p>Since the recombinant dRNase Z displayed faithful tRNA 3&#x02032;-end endonucleolytic activity <italic>in vitro</italic>, it was reasonable to investigate whether this enzyme is responsible for tRNA processing <italic>in vivo</italic>. We used RNAi, which in many instances has proven to be an efficient tool for disruption of targeted protein production. RNAi was carried out by transfecting <italic>Drosophila</italic> Schneider S2 (S2) cells with dsRNA corresponding to <italic>dRNase Z</italic> or <italic>JhI-26</italic>. <italic>JhI-26</italic> is an unrelated <italic>Drosophila</italic> gene which, like <italic>dRNase Z,</italic> is expressed in S2 cells at a basal level and can be induced with JH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh182c32">32</xref>). In the current experiment we used <italic>JhI-26</italic> as a mock-transfection control and <italic>rp49</italic> as a loading control. After transfection, cultures were allowed to grow for 1, 2 and 3 days prior to analysis. The efficiency of RNAi-mediated silencing was assessed by northern blot hybridization (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh182f3">3</xref>). At all time points examined, the cells exposed to specific dsRNA fragments showed selective knockdown of the corresponding gene expression. The level of <italic>dRNase Z</italic> mRNA was significantly reduced in RNase Z RNAi cells after 1 day of treatment with dsRNA and the effect was even stronger when cells were exposed to dsRNA for up to 2&#x02013;3 days, illustrating the efficiency of RNAi silencing. The level of <italic>JhI-26</italic> mRNA was similarly reduced in JhI-26/Mock RNAi cells. Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh182f3">3</xref> also shows the specificity of RNAi, since <italic>JhI-26</italic> dsRNA did not reduce <italic>dRNase Z</italic> mRNA levels, and dsRNA corresponding to <italic>dRNase Z</italic> had no effect on <italic>JhI-26</italic> mRNA levels. RNAi can thus efficiently and specifically silence <italic>dRNase Z</italic> expression.</p></sec><sec><title><italic>In vivo</italic> tRNA 3&#x02032; processing is catalysed by dRNase Z</title><p>Next we tested RNAi cells for any defects in the tRNA processing pathway. We examined processing of nuclear encoded tRNA<sup>His</sup> in control and mock-transfected cells versus cells with inhibited <italic>dRNase Z</italic> expression using a probe specific either for mature tRNA<sup>His</sup>, the 5&#x02032; leader or the 3&#x02032; trailer (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh182f4">4</xref>B). The 121 nt long primary transcript of tRNA<sup>His</sup> consists of a 5&#x02032; leader (13 nt), the tRNA<sup>His</sup> (72 nt) and a 3&#x02032; trailer (36 nt) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh182c20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh182c44">44</xref>). As expected, in control and mock-transfected cells, the 5&#x02032;- and 3&#x02032;-specific probes both revealed the 121 nucleotide unprocessed tRNA<sup>His</sup> primary transcript. The dsRNA transfection did not change the pattern of hybridization with the 5&#x02032;-specific probe: all samples displayed only the 121 nt band even after long exposures. In contrast, the 3&#x02032;-specific probe detected an additional smaller RNA in <italic>dRNase Z</italic> RNAi cells, a 108 nt processing intermediate with a mature tRNA 5&#x02032; end and a 36 nt extension at the 3&#x02032; end. Importantly, the tRNA processing arrest was specific for <italic>dRNase Z</italic> RNAi cells: no processing intermediates accumulated in mock-transfected cells. We thus conclude that dRNase Z functions <italic>in vivo</italic> to process tRNA molecules at the 3&#x02032; end.</p><p>Although the intermediate with a 3&#x02032; extension accumulated in <italic>dRNase Z</italic> RNAi cells, the internal probe specific for mature tRNA revealed a 72 nt signal of equal intensity in all samples (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh182f4">4</xref>B), indicating no alteration in the steady-state level of mature tRNA<sup>His</sup>. Three explanations can be offered for this observation: (i) RNAi treatment was not fully effective, (ii) mature tRNA molecules are stable through several cell generations and (iii) as in yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh182c46">46</xref>), there may be a back-up system for the endonucleolytic pathway.</p></sec><sec><title><italic>dRNase Z</italic> gene also encodes the mitochondrial tRNA 3&#x02032; processing enzyme</title><p>The dRNase Z gene may be suggested to encode the mitochondrial tRNA 3&#x02032; processing enzyme for the following reasons. First, there is only a single RNase Z gene in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> genome; second <italic>Drosophila</italic> RNase Z contains a mitochondrial target sequence, and has a second methionine (amino acid 24) which is suspected to be the first methionine of the nuclear form (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh182f1">1</xref>) close to the predicted target sequence cleavage site (amino acid 25), and finally, recombinant dRNase Z is capable of processing <italic>Drosophila</italic> mitochondrial pre-tRNAs <italic>in vitro</italic>. Thus we investigated whether it has the same activity <italic>in vivo</italic>. Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh182f5">5</xref>A shows the mitochondrial tRNA<sup>Ile</sup>&#x02013;tRNA<sup>Met</sup> cluster, which is transcribed as part of a long precursor RNA in which the two tRNAs are separated by a 105 nt spacer. Northern blot hybridization with the 3&#x02032; probe specific for the intergenic spacer revealed a 170 nt band that accumulated to a high level in <italic>dRNase Z</italic> RNAi cells, but not in mock RNAi cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh182f5">5</xref>B). This band corresponds to a tRNA<sup>Ile</sup> processing intermediate with a mature 5&#x02032; end and a 105 nt extension at the 3&#x02032; end. Thus RNase P efficiently produces the mature 5&#x02032; end of tRNA<sup>Ile</sup> and neighbouring tRNA<sup>Met</sup>, while 3&#x02032; end processing of tRNA<sup>Ile</sup> is inhibited by the dRNase Z knock-down. In conformity with this conclusion, in control and mock-transfected cells the 3&#x02032; probe detected a stable 105 nt tRNA<sup>Ile</sup>&#x02013;tRNA<sup>Met</sup> intergenic spacer, whose steady-state level decreased with the increased level of the processing intermediate in <italic>dRNase Z</italic> RNAi cells. As expected, in all samples, the internal tRNA<sup>Ile</sup> probe detected one major band, a 65 nt mature tRNA<sup>Ile</sup>. Two important alterations were observed in the pattern of internal probe hybridization with the <italic>dRNase Z</italic> RNAi samples. First, the intensity of the mature tRNA<sup>Ile</sup> band decreased progressively during 3 days of treatment with <italic>dRNase Z</italic> dsRNA, suggesting that RNAi against dRNase Z has a stronger effect on the processing of tRNAs encoded in mitochondria than in the nucleus. Second, the internal probe detected the same intermediate as the 3&#x02032; probe. The corresponding band is more clearly visible after long exposure, but could not be detected with the internal probe against mature mitochondrial tRNA<sup>Met</sup> (data not shown). Again, this is consistent with our suggestion that the RNase Z knockdown abrogates cleavage at the 3&#x02032; end, leading to the accumulation of tRNA processing intermediates with 3&#x02032; extensions.</p><p>To test whether the mitochondrial arrest of tRNA 3&#x02032; end processing is a general outcome of dRNase Z knockdown, we also examined processing of a second mitochondrial tRNA cluster, tRNA<sup>Tyr</sup>&#x02013;tRNA<sup>Cys</sup> (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh182f6">6</xref>). These two genes are arranged in tandem with a 19 nt spacer and are transcribed as part of a mitochondrial polycistronic transcript analogous to the tRNA<sup>Ile</sup>&#x02013;tRNA<sup>Met</sup> cluster (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh182f5">5</xref>A). With the 3&#x02032; probe against the intergenic spacer, we detected accumulation of an 85 nt processing intermediate in <italic>dRNase Z</italic> RNAi cells, but not in wild-type or mock RNAi cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh182f6">6</xref>), while the internal probe only detected 66 nt mature tRNA<sup>Tyr</sup>. The 85 nt intermediate corresponds to a pre-tRNA<sup>Tyr</sup> with a mature 5&#x02032; end and a 19 nt extension at the 3&#x02032; end. The progressive decrease in intensity of the mature tRNA<sup>Tyr</sup> band over 3 days of treatment with dRNase Z dsRNA was not observed in mock-transfected cells. Thus, we conclude that <italic>Drosophila</italic> RNase Z is required for processing of tRNA molecules encoded in both nucleus and mitochondria <italic>in vivo</italic>. Several tRNA modifying enzymes are known which are encoded by a single gene but routed to different cell compartments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh182c47">47</xref>), and data presented here suggest that this is also the case for <italic>Drosophila</italic> RNase Z.</p></sec><sec><title>Preferred reaction order in which cleavage by RNase P precedes RNase Z processing</title><p>The preferred order of pre-tRNA 5&#x02032; and 3&#x02032; end processing has been examined with various substrates, organelles and organisms, principally <italic>in vitro</italic>, and results often favour first 5&#x02032;, then 3&#x02032; processing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh182c48">48</xref>). The present study favours this order <italic>in vivo</italic>. An 85 nt nuclear pre-tRNA<sup>His</sup> with a 5&#x02032; end leader and no 3&#x02032; end trailer would be expected if 3&#x02032; end processing preceded the RNase P reaction. Failure to detect the predicted 85 nt band in control and mock lanes with the 5&#x02032; probe (even with long exposures; Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh182f4">4</xref>B and data not shown) suggests a preferred pre-tRNA processing reaction order <italic>in vivo</italic> (first RNase P, then RNase Z), in agreement with earlier <italic>in vitro</italic> results with fruit fly culture cell extracts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh182c20">20</xref>). Furthermore, mitochondrial RNase P apparently cleaves efficiently when 3&#x02032; end processing is impaired in RNAi cells (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh182f5">5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh182f6">6</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>tRNA processing and protein biosynthetic capacity</title><p>The <italic>Drosophila</italic> gene encoding RNase Z was first detected by differential display of transcripts whose abundance is substantially elevated in cultured cells in the presence of JH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh182c32">32</xref>). In flies, high levels of <italic>dRNase Z</italic> mRNA were found in adult females and in embryos although it is present at all developmental stages.</p><p>In adult females, we detected a large amount of <italic>dRNase Z</italic> transcripts produced in ovarian nurse cells and later transferred into the nascent oocyte (E.B.Dubrovsky, unpublished data). By the end of oogenesis, the egg accumulates a stockpile of <italic>dRNase Z</italic> mRNA. We suggest that maternally supplied dRNase Z contributes to the translational capacity of the developing embryo. Recent profiling of gene expression at the genomic level showed that more than 88&#x00025; of genes whose expression is modulated during the <italic>Drosophila</italic> life cycle have a first peak of transcript abundance early in development, before the end of embryogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh182c49">49</xref>). At least 40&#x00025; of these transcripts are maternally deposited; they encode proteins that are required for early embryonic events such as the set-up of pattern formation axes and the nuclear division cycles. To accommodate exceptionally high demand for protein synthesis during embryogenesis, the mature egg accumulates components of the translational machinery including the tRNA processing enzyme dRNase Z. Based on this hypothesis, it would be interesting to test the <italic>dRNase Z</italic> gene for a maternal effect.</p></sec><sec><title>Do ELAC2 proteins have multiple functions?</title><p>The <italic>ELAC2</italic> gene in <italic>S.cerevisiae</italic> has been reported to be vital (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh182c31">31</xref>). Since in yeast cells there is a back-up system for the RNase Z-catalysed tRNA 3&#x02032; processing pathway, the nuclear tRNA 3&#x02032; processing function may not be the essential function of the <italic>ELAC2</italic> gene. Yeast cells can become &#x003c1;<sup>0</sup>, thus the mitochondrial tRNA 3&#x02032; processing activity is also not essential. Consequently there could be another function of the yeast <italic>ELAC2</italic> gene, loss of which leads to cell death.</p><p>The human <italic>ELAC2</italic> gene is reportedly connected to the occurrence of prostate cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh182c31">31</xref>).

ELAC2 protein thus probably has an additional role in the cell besides tRNA 3&#x02032; processing, perhaps involving cell cycle regulation.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>SUPPLEMENTARY MATERIAL</title><p>Supplementary Material is available at NAR Online.</p><supplementary-material id="PMC_1" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>[Supplementary Material]</title></caption><media mimetype="text" mime-subtype="html" xlink:href="nar_32_1_255__index.html"/><media xlink:role="associated-file" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="nar_32_1_255__1.pdf"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="display-objects"><title>Figures and Tables</title><fig id="gkh182f1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p> Alignment of ELAC1 and ELAC2 protein sequences.
