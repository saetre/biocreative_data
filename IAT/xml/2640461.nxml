Although suggested by cytological work, <italic>in vivo</italic> links between the structural proteins of the synaptonemal complex and the proteins of the recombination process have not previously been made. The central element of the synaptonemal complex is traversed by DNA at sites of recombination and presents a logical place to look for interactions between these components. There are four known central element proteins, three of which have previously been mutated. Here, we complete the set by creating a null mutation in the <italic>Syce1</italic> gene in mouse. The resulting disruption of synapsis in these animals has allowed us to demonstrate a biochemical interaction between the structural protein SYCE2 and the repair protein RAD51. In normal meiosis, this interaction may be responsible for promoting homologous synapsis from sites of recombination.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><p>Production of sperm and eggs, also known as gametes, requires a reduction in the number of copies of the genome, from the two found in most cells of the body to the single copy found in gametes. This is a complex process, made even more complex because it is coupled with recombination, a process that is an important contributor to genetic diversity. Mammals and many other organisms achieve reduction and recombination through a process called meiosis, which is recognisable by the presence of a distinctive structure&#x02014;the synaptonemal complex&#x02014;that links the chromosomes together and is essential for meiosis to complete. We have made mice that lack SYCE1, a protein component of the synaptonemal complex. In these animals, meiosis is blocked at a particular stage, and this has allowed us to detect co-localisation and interactions&#x02014;likely indirect&#x02014;between enzymes involved in recombination and structural proteins involved in meiosis. This provides a starting point to understand in biochemical detail the protein links between structure and function in meiosis. Mutations or variants in the genes encoding such proteins are likely contributors to variations in fertility and to abnormalities in chromosome number.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="10"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Meiosis is a specialised process in which the replicated diploid genome undergoes two rounds of cell division without an intervening DNA replication. Production of haploid gametes from the diploid germ line is a complex process requiring the accurate separation of the two parental genomes to avoid the aneuploidy which would result from errors. Meiotic recombination imposes the additional requirement that the two genomes be precisely aligned for exchange of genetic information. In organisms from budding yeast to humans a key component of the meiotic cellular machinery used to enforce this is the synaptonemal complex (SC). This is a widely occurring, proteinaceous structure which physically links the pairs of sister chromatids (for review see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000393-Page1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>) and is visualised in the electron microscope as a zipper like structure with two lateral elements (LE) and the central element (CE) in between. Lateral elements are derived from axial elements (AE) that connect sister chromatids after premeiotic DNA replication. To date, numerous protein components of the SC have been defined in a variety of organisms (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000393-Page1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>). They can be classified as components either of the LE/AE or of the CE. In mammals AE proteins include cohesins and coiled coil domain proteins such as SYCP3 and SYCP2 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000393-Schalk1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000393-Pelttari1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>. The CE contains the recently described proteins SYCE1, SYCE2 and TEX12 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000393-Costa1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000393-Hamer1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>. SYCP1 is a key protein, which links AEs to the CE through its central coiled coil domain and by having C and N terminal globular domains anchored in AE and CE respectively <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000393-Meuwissen1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000393-Schmekel1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>. In many organisms the formation of the SC is dependent on double strand breaks (DSBs) which can be processed to crossover or, more frequently, non crossover pathways. The SC may play a role in regulating the non random distribution of crossovers known as interference. However the requirement for and intact SC is sexually dimorphic in mice and it is not required for interference in female meiosis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000393-deBoer1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>In male mice the fully assembled SC is required to complete crossover recombination and genetic exchange. Mutations in axial element components <italic>Sycp2</italic> and <italic>Sycp3</italic> result in failure of SC formation and infertility in the male. Milder meiotic defects in female meiosis result in increased aneuploidy and reduced litter sizes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000393-Kolas1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000393-Yuan1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>. To date mutagenesis of known components of the CE in mouse suggest that an intact CE is required in both sexes. In <italic>Sycp1</italic> null mice synapsis is completely abolished and although the MSH4 foci indicative of intermediate stages of recombination are present neither sex forms the MLH1 foci, which are the cytological markers of crossover, and both sexes are infertile <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000393-deVries1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>. <italic>Syce2</italic> null mice, in which the axial elements align but do not synapse, also do not form MLH1 foci in either sex although again proteins indicative of earlier stages of the recombination process such as RAD51 and MSH4 are present <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000393-BolcunFilas1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>. TEX 12, a central element protein which interacts with SYCE2, has recently been shown to have a similar null phenotype with the absence of crossover recombination in both sexes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000393-Hamer2">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>. Since these proteins are mutually dependent for localisation to and formation of the CE this similarity is not surprising.</p><p>Based on known interactions between SYCP1, SYCE1, SYCE2 and TEX12 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000393.s001">Figure S1</xref>) we have suggested that the assembly of the SC is a multi-step process which is blocked at different stages by the absence of SYCE1 and 2 and probably TEX12 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000393-BolcunFilas1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>. In the presence of SYCE2 and the absence of SYCE1 the prediction is that points of synapsis, as observed in the <italic>Syce2<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> animals, do not occur. Here we report the phenotype of such mutant animals. Importantly this phenotype has suggested interactions between these structural components of the SC and the recombination machinery.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Disruption and Inactivation of the Mouse <italic>Syce1</italic> Gene</title><p>We disrupted the mouse <italic>Syce1</italic> gene by gene targeting in AB2.2 ES cells.

Primary spermatocytes were the most common germ cell type indicating a spermatogenesis arrest at prophase I. Elevated levels of apoptosis were detectable in some tubules by TUNEL staining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000393-g001">Figure 1B, insets</xref>) suggesting that arrested cells are eliminated by this mechanism.

Normally during meiotic prophase I homologous chromosomes are closely juxtaposed and are then physically connected by the SC along the entire length of chromosome axes. Immunostaining for SYCP3, SYCP2 and STAG3 proteins revealed that AEs are formed normally in the absence of SYCE1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000393-g002">Figure 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000393.s003">S3</xref>) and that homologous chromosomes align in close juxtaposition. The sex chromosomes are an exception to this; as in <italic>Sycp1, Tex12 and Syce2</italic> null mutants the pseudoautosomal regions do not pair and a sex body is not formed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000393-g002">Figure 2D, arrows</xref>). Wild-type spermatocytes at pachynema are characterised by the presence of ribbon-like structures seen by staining for SYCP1. These represent fully formed SCs linking homologous chromosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000393-g002">Figure 2A</xref>). In <italic>Syce1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> cells, although AEs are formed and aligned SCs do not assemble between them as indicated by the absence of continuous SYCP1 staining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000393-g002">Figure 2B,D</xref>). Interestingly a weak discontinuous SYCP1 signal was observed associated with AE whether they are closely aligned or not (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000393-g002">Figure 2B, D</xref>). We used immunostaining for SYCE2 and TEX12, two other markers of synapsis that in the wild-type co-localise with SYCP1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000393-g002">Figure 2E</xref>) to further investigate synaptic failure. Although SYCE2 and TEX12 foci co-localise as expected, immunostaining for SYCE2 or TEX12 does not resemble that of the wild-type animals. Instead they were found in intermittent foci between closely aligned AEs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000393-g002">Figure 2F</xref>). This is consistent with the observations that their localisation to the SC is co-dependent and their known interactions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000393.s001">Figure S1</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000393-Hamer1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000393-BolcunFilas1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000393-Hamer2">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>.

A subset of cells shows accumulation of SYCP1 on both AEs without accompanying SYCE2, suggesting that the SYCP1 C-terminal region can bind to AEs in the absence of SYCE1. Additionally in <italic>Syce1/Syce2</italic> double knockout SYCP1 still binds to aligned AEs suggesting that it is the presence of SYCE1 that restricts SYCP1 binding to synapsed axes when all components are present (not shown). <italic>Syce1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> oocytes display very similar defects in chromosome synapsis to males (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000393-g002">Figure 2G&#x02013;H</xref>).

A subset of cells (42&#x00025;, n&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;435) with high number of RAD51 foci (approximately two hundred per nucleus) did not have any SYCE2 staining (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000393.s004">Figure S4</xref>) However, cells with approximately half the number of RAD51 foci, located between aligned AE, showed co-localised staining for SYCE2 (43&#x00025; n&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;435) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000393-g005">Figure 5B</xref>). SYCE2 was almost always accompanied by a RAD51 signal in these cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000393-g005">Figure 5B, lower panel in offset</xref>). To test if this co-localisation reflects a biochemical interaction between SYCE2 and RAD51 we used immunoprecipitation (IP) from wild-type and <italic>Syce1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> testicular extracts. We have immunoprecipitated proteins using both anti-SYCE2 antibody and preimmune serum as a control, and checked for interacting proteins by probing western blot with anti-RAD51 antibodies.

Although we detect SYCE2 and RAD51 in the same complex we can not and do not conclude that this interaction is direct. Our attempts to demonstrate that using an in vitro assay have been inconclusive due to insolubility of proteins when co-overexpressed or to RAD51-GST interactions in pull down reactions. We proceeded to check if SYCE2 also co-localises with MSH4 which appears when chromosomes synapse and which succeeds RAD51 in the recombination nodules.

DNA repair is incomplete, the SC and the sex body are absent, homologous alignments at variable distances of the AEs occur, early (RAD51) and intermediate (MSH4) markers of recombination are present but there is a complete absence of MLH1 marking crossovers. In the testis cells are eliminated by apoptosis and both sexes are infertile. Complete assembly of the SC is co-dependent on the presence of all four proteins (SYCP1, SYCE1, SYCE2 and TEX12) and perhaps on others as yet undiscovered. However the mice null for different CE components are likely blocked in different states of SC assembly and provide tools to dissect this essential process.</p><p>There are distinct features of the <italic>Syce1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> phenotype.

Previously, in our model for synaptonemal complex assembly we suggested that SYCE1 stabilises N-terminal interactions of SYCP1 in the CE and that SYCE2/TEX12 is required for the elongation of the SC. The <italic>Syce1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> phenotype is consistent with this model.</p><p>Given the presence of three out of four CE components and interactions between SYCP1 and SYCE2 we expected some form of CE to be present in <italic>Syce1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> spermatocytes as found in <italic>Syce2<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> and <italic>Tex12<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> spermatocytes.

In a revised model although the three CE proteins (SYCP1, SYCE2 and TEX12) co-localise they do not produce a visible CE in the microscope due to the absence of multiple layers of proteins dependent on SYCE1.

Impaired recombination in mouse mutants lacking the CE points to the possibility that interactions between the structural components of the CE and the recombination machinery occur and are essential for crossover. Prior to synapsis the recombinase RAD51 is recruited to the DSBs and disappears as chromosomes synapse. In mutants that lack the SC RAD51 persists longer and is associated with the AEs.

Although all four CE proteins are needed for complete synapsis, structures suggestive of sites of initiation of synapsis can be seen at both light and electron microscope resolution in the absence of SYCE2 or TEX12 but not in the absence of SYCE1. In the SYCE1 null animals we observe co-localisation of SYCE2 and RAD51 which we suggest occurs in normal mouse meiosis but is obscured by the subsequent rapid assembly of the SC. This concentration of SYCE2 may function to promote SC extension. We can not exclude that TEX12, a SYCE2 binding partner, plays a specific role in its interaction with RAD51. Interestingly, it was shown that in DSB deficient mutants, when breaks are introduced artificially, the number of RAD51 foci representing induced DSB correlate with the extent of synapsis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000393-Tesse1">&#x0005b;49&#x0005d;</xref>.

Our results here suggest that this process may also operate in the reverse direction with repair proteins playing a role in the assembly of structures essential for meiosis and fertility.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Generation and Characterisation of SYCE1-Deficient Mice</title><p>To inactivate the <italic>Syce1</italic> gene, we designed a targeting vector to replace exons 2&#x02013;11 by selection cassette.
