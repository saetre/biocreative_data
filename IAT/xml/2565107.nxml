We have previously described a <italic>SMN trans</italic>-splicing system that significantly elevated full-length SMN protein levels in SMA patient fibroblasts <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003468-Coady1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>. However, initial <italic>in vivo</italic> experiments failed to achieve similar levels of activation (data not shown). Therefore, we initially examined SMN2 trans-splicing with the goal of devising strategies to enhance trans-splicing efficiency <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p><p>In <italic>SMN2 trans</italic>-splicing, there are three potential splicing outcomes: full length (FL), truncated (&#x00394;7) and <italic>trans</italic>-spliced mRNA (TRANS&#x0002a;) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003468-g001">Figure 1A</xref>). Since pre-mRNA splicing is a highly dynamic process, we hypothesized that competition exists between the <italic>trans</italic>-splicing event and the naturally strong <italic>SMN2</italic> exon 8 splice site. Thus, competitive inhibition of the exon 8 splice site would enhance <italic>trans</italic>-splicing efficiency. To address this possibility, two complementary experiments were performed. A previously described slow-polymerase encoding plasmid was co-transfected with the <italic>SMN2</italic> mini-gene and the plasmid expressing the <italic>SMN trans</italic>-splicing RNA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003468-delaMata1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>. Under these experimental conditions, the exon 8 3&#x02032; splice site approximately two kb downstream from exon 7, should not be synthesized as quickly as the natural polymerase, therefore, potentially favoring the <italic>trans</italic>-splicing event. Consistent with the hypothesis, in the presence of the slow transcribing polymerase, <italic>trans</italic>-splicing was substantially increased over the typical level of <italic>trans</italic>-splicing previously observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003468-g001">Figure 1B</xref>). Additionally, a <italic>SMN2</italic> mini-gene was used in a separate experiment in which the intervening intron between <italic>SMN2</italic> exons 7 and 8 was deleted. In the absence of an intact acceptor site at the intron 7/exon 8 junction, <italic>SMN trans</italic>-splicing was again elevated several fold over the standard <italic>SMN2</italic> mini-gene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003468-g001">Figure 1C</xref>). Collectively, these results demonstrate that competitively disabling the downstream splice site can lead to enhanced <italic>trans</italic>-splicing efficiency, either through a biochemical means or by a genetic alteration.</p><fig id="pone-0003468-g001" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0003468.g001</object-id><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>Development of a single plasmid vector enhances <italic>SMN</italic> based <italic>trans</italic>-splicing.</title><p>(A) Proposed ASO-tsRNA mechanism. <italic>SMN2</italic> transcripts alternative splice producing two mRNA products.

Consequently, temporal and spatial constraints on gene expression are retained. As <italic>SMN</italic> expression has previously been shown to be significantly down-regulated from embryogenesis to adulthood, this additional restraint may prove beneficial for long-term exposure to a <italic>SMN trans</italic>-splicing vector. Avenues of research directed to the reduction of tsRNA vector dosage would consequently inhibit the negative effects of off-target <italic>trans</italic>-splicing over greater amounts of time.</p><p>The genetic context of SMA represents an intriguing target for a number of therapeutic strategies, including <italic>trans</italic>-splicing. In the <italic>SMN2</italic> gene, the intrinsic quality of the exon 7 splice acceptor site is reduced due to the C/T transition. Therefore, the competition between <italic>SMN2 cis</italic>-splicing and <italic>trans</italic>-splicing is likely reduced, providing a potential advantage to <italic>trans</italic>-splicing in the <italic>SMN</italic> context compared to other alternatively regulated exons that retain fully functional splice sites. We propose <italic>trans</italic>-splicing is further enhanced relative to cis-splicing with the introduction of an inhibitory ASO. Since the tsRNA annealing domain hybridizes over the target exon, it is logical that this may promote exon 7 skipping. Therefore, the addition of the anti-sense likely blocks this escape pathway and further promotes trans-splicing. Unlike many ASOs that modify splicing, the ASOs used in this context are native RNA structures, not oligonucleotides with modified backbones. Therefore, the affects may be difficult to observe at steady-state levels when used as an ASO alone. However, given that this sequence overlaps the intron 7/exon 8 boundary, it was not surprising that the ASO recapitulated the increase in trans-splicing observed with the slow polymerase and intron 7-deleted construct.</p><p>In general, the field of <italic>trans</italic>-splicing therapeutics can benefit from the discovery of combined ASO-tiling and tsRNAs. ASO-tiling increases the potential of tsRNA by modulating <italic>cis</italic>-splicing signals within the target transcript. Additionally, in a novel application of ASO-In4<sup>11</sup> and tsRNA<sup>EX4</sup> co-delivery targeting a upstream <italic>SMN</italic> intron 3 exon 4 splicing context produced enhancement of basal <italic>trans</italic>-splicing. (Supplemental <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0003468.s002">Figure S2</xref>) Studies here demonstrate the limitations of dual vector delivery in difficult fibroblast transfection conditions. Co-transfection dynamics hinder the potential of ASO/tsRNA pre-mRNA redirection and can be circumvented by sub-cloning of the single vector pMU3. The combination of ASO-tsRNA mechanism and a novel single vector platform produces a potent enhancement of basal <italic>trans</italic>-splicing. In the case of <italic>trans</italic>-splicing RNAs designs such as, 5&#x02032; or 3&#x02032; versions would require examination of beneficial upstream and downstream sequences to tile with ASO RNA.</p><p>The <italic>in vivo</italic> results demonstrate ASO-tsRNA represents a tractable therapeutic yet highlight the transient nature of plasmid transfections. The use of AAV vectors for the delivery of gene therapies would provide a substantial longevity to ASO-tsRNA expression and thus <italic>SMN2</italic> redirection.
