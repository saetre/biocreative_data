These mechanisms underpin trophoblastic invasion and remodelling of maternal tissues, placental angiogenesis, and the modulation of maternal immune responses. Central to these processes is the production by trophoblast of a variety of hormones that are found in abundance in the maternal bloodstream during pregnancy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>].</p><p>The pregnancy-specific glycoproteins (PSG) are the most abundant foetal proteins in the maternal bloodstream in late pregnancy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. They are synthesised in the syncytiotrophoblast of the human placenta and giant cells and spongiotrophoblast in the rodent placenta [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. The PSG family of glycoproteins belongs to the carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) family, which also includes the CEA-related adhesion molecules (CEACAMs). The CEA family is itself part of the immunoglobulin (Ig) superfamily [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. The Ig domain structure of the human and rodent PSGs differs. Containing both V-like Ig domains (N), C2-like Ig domains (A and B) and relatively hydrophilic tails (C), domain arrangements in human PSGs are type I (N-A1-A2-B2-C), type IIa (N-A1-B2-C), type IIb (N-A2-B2-C), type III (N-B2-C) and type IV (A1-B2-C) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. In contrast, rodent PSGs are typically comprised of 3, and in a few cases of 5 or 7 N-domains followed by an A-domain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. In the primate / rodent ancestor, the initial duplication of the CEACAM / PSG primordial gene has been estimated to have occurred about 90 Myr ago [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>], approximately at the time of human-rodent divergence. The most probable PSG ancestor in rodents and primates is a CEACAM15-like molecule based on the organisation of N and A domains. CEACAM15 is not classified as a PSG because comparisons of N and A domain sequence identity clearly delineate members of the CEACAM and PSG subfamilies (Roland Zebhauser, WZ, AM, TM, to be published elsewhere). It has been suggested that human and rodent PSG multigene families evolved independently via further gene duplication and exon shuffling events [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>].</p><p>There are 11 members of the PSG family in humans that are encoded by genes clustered on chromosome 19q13.2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. PSG proteins have a similar domain structure to the CEACAMs, but lack a membrane anchor and are therefore secreted. However, a few variants have been described that are retained within the cell. Conversely, a small number of human and mouse CEACAM variants lack a membrane anchor and are secreted. Membrane-anchored CEACAMs are widely expressed during embryonic development and in adult tissues, and are implicated in carcinogenesis, angiogenesis and regulation of immune functions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. In contrast, PSGs and some CEACAMs are expressed almost exclusively in trophoblasts of the haemochorial placenta of rodents and primates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>].</p><p>The biochemical properties and physiological functions of the PSGs remain to be fully elucidated, although functional experiments and clinical observations are beginning to provide some clues. Low PSG levels in the maternal circulation are associated with threatened abortions, intrauterine growth retardation and foetal hypoxia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. The importance of PSGs for the maintenance of pregnancy is also underlined by the observation that the application of anti-PSG antibodies or vaccination with PSG induces abortion in mice and monkeys, respectively, and reduces the fertility of non-pregnant monkeys [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. The majority of PSG functional studies have focussed on determining whether PSGs are able to modulate the maternal immune system to prevent rejection of the allotypic foetus. Early studies with complex PSG mixtures isolated from placenta indicated an inhibitory effect on phytohaemagglutinin or allogeneically stimulated lymphocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. In further experiments it was shown that human monocytes secreted anti-inflammatory cytokines in response to PSG exposure. Moreover, recombinant mouse PSG18 was found to induce the production of interleukin (IL)-10 in the mouse macrophage cell line RAW 264.7 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. Human PSG1, PSG6 and PSG11 all induced secretion of IL-10, IL-6 and transforming growth factor (TGF)-&#x003b2;1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. Whilst IL-10 and TGF-&#x003b2;1 are anti-inflammatory [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>], IL-6 is usually considered to be a proinflammatory cytokine. However IL-6 does have some well-described anti-inflammatory properties [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. Furthermore, IL-6 has been shown to indirectly promote trophoblast growth by upregulation of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) release by the trophoblast, and induction of granulocyte-macrophage-colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. Further evidence implicating PSGs in immune modulation arises from PSG mediated suppression of T cells in purulent septic complications of abortion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>] and elevated circulating PSG levels are correlated with improved symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. PSG induction of alternative monocyte activation is of particular importance as it implies a PSG-mediated switching of the immune system from a predominantly T<sub>H</sub>1 response to a predominately T<sub>H</sub>2 response which is more compatible with a successful pregnancy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>].</p><p>The only PSG receptor identified to date is the integrin-associated CD9 receptor, which was found to bind the N1 domain of both PSG17 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>] and PSG19 (unpublished data). Additionally, the presence of the conserved tripeptide motif Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD) on a solvent-exposed loop in the N-terminal Ig domain in the majority of human and some lower-primate PSGs implicates a function that involves integrin-related receptors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. Thus it has been speculated that the RGD domain may enable some PSGs to disrupt cell-matrix interactions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. However, no rodent PSG isolated to date possesses an RGD domain. Evidence supporting the hypothesis that the RGD domain may be involved in receptor binding was provided by the discovery that a peptide containing the RGD motif, from human PSG9, bound to a receptor on the surface of a promonocytic cell line [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. In common with integrin interactions, this was dependent on the presence of divalent cations and showed sensitivity to cytoskeletal signalling. However, the expected sizes of the receptor subunits differed from those of known integrins, therefore, the identity of the receptor remains elusive.</p><p>Much current work has focussed on human PSGs due to their possible relevance to disorders of pregnancy. However, the study of rodent PSGs is important because, the evident differences between primate and rodent PSG protein domain structures notwithstanding, there appears to be considerable conservation in terms of expression in trophoblast, independent gene family expansions in mammalian lineages with haemochorial placentation, and postulated immune functions during pregnancy. Moreover, the application of gene targeting and mutagenesis in the mouse is likely to be informative with respect to elucidating the cellular and physiological functions of PSGs. Such experiments will require an accurate genomic map of the mouse <italic>Psg </italic>locus, which we undertook to produce in the work described herein. It is also pertinent to ask whether the independent expansions of <italic>PSG </italic>gene families in different mammalian lineages reflect selection for increased gene dosage or for diversification of function mediated through different protein structures or developmental expression patterns. We therefore undertook to examine and correlate protein domain evolution and expression profiles of the various mouse <italic>Psg </italic>genes to attempt to address this question. Our results suggest that different family members have very different expression levels at different stages of development, which we consider may be supportive of the hypothesis that mouse <italic>Psg </italic>genes may have evolved divergent functions in mammalian pregnancy. However, mutagenesis of individual family members will be necessary to rigorously test this hypothesis.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Identification of novel mouse <italic>Psg </italic>genes</title><p>For comparative studies of the human PSG family it is relatively easy to compare coding sequences (CDS) and peptide sequences because complete sequence information is available. However the data available for mouse PSGs is not complete, making such analyses difficult. Thus, we firstly collated the currently available public data, and we then attempted to identify sequences for PSGs that were not completely resolved in the databases. Full-length cDNA sequences of <italic>Psg17</italic>, <italic>Psg18</italic>, <italic>Psg19</italic>, <italic>Psg21</italic>, <italic>Psg23</italic>, <italic>Psg28 </italic>and <italic>Psg30 </italic>were identified via basic name searches of the RefSeq RNA database. Their identity was then verified by comparison to cDNA fragment sequences, which were obtained during the course of this work and deposited in GenBank [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>], as misnaming of genes is commonplace in the databases. The cDNA sequence of <italic>Psg22 </italic>was then identified via BLAST analysis of the mouse RefSeq RNA database using the GenBank partial sequence referenced in Beauchemin <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]. <italic>Psg31 </italic>was identified by BLAST analysis of the same database using the full-length <italic>Psg30 </italic>sequence and found to be the XM_355864.1 predicted transcript. However, there was a discrepancy between the predicted transcript and the sequences of EST clones CK032208 and CN694284. Comparison of these EST sequences with genomic contig NT_039395.2, using pairwise BLAST analysis, revealed that there had been a duplication of the N1 domain exon. We refer to the two N1 domains of <italic>Psg31 </italic>as N1 and N1* hereafter.</p><p>The gene and full-length cDNA coding sequences of the remaining mouse genes (<italic>Psg20</italic>, <italic>Psg24</italic>, <italic>Psg25, Psg26</italic>, <italic>Psg27 </italic>and <italic>Psg29</italic>) were deduced manually by systematic BLAST analysis of the mouse genome database as described in Methods. None of these predicted cDNAs were observed in the mouse EST database, although all except <italic>Psg20 </italic>were observed in the Trace Archive EST sequences. A novel splice variant of <italic>Psg16 </italic>was also found. BLAST analysis of the mouse High Throughput Genomic Sequences (HTGS) database identified contig AC148976.2, which appears to contain the whole <italic>Psg16 </italic>gene. An alternative exon 1 was discovered upstream of the previously described initiating exon by a pairwise BLAST comparison of this contig with full-length <italic>Psg17 </italic>coding sequence. The use of this alternative exon 1 produced a transcript that encodes a typical PSG polypeptide complete with a predicted secretory-peptide signal sequence and cleavage site. Multiple hits identified from subsequent BLAST analysis of the mouse EST and Trace Archives EST databases provided evidence that this novel splice variant was placentally expressed <italic>in vivo</italic>. In contrast, only one hit was obtained by identical analysis using the coding sequence of the brain-specific transcript described in Chen <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]. This transcript (BC030357) was derived from a retinal cDNA library. The brain-expressed splice variant is generated from an alternative initiation site within exon 2 of the dominant placentally-expressed form of the gene. Alternative promoter usage would explain the brain and placenta-specific expression patterns of these variants of <italic>Psg16</italic>. Unlike the brain-specific variant, the placentally-expressed variant possesses a predicted secretory signal peptide at the N-terminus, like most other <italic>Psg </italic>gene family members.</p><p>The comparison of the brain derived <italic>Psg16 </italic>coding sequence with the genomic sequence (AC148976.2) also revealed differences in the encoding of the A-domain. The placental transcript is predicted to be encoded by 5 exons, as are the majority of mouse <italic>Psg </italic>mRNAs. However, a weak splice donor signal sequence within the fifth exon permits splicing to a strong splice acceptor sequence downstream of the sixth exon, as seen in the brain-expressed transcript. Trace Archive EST data reveals multiple hits to sequences from placental cDNA libraries using the 3' end of the placental <italic>Psg16 </italic>coding sequence as bait. This confirms the existence of our predicted transcript. Conversely, similar analysis using the brain-expressed variant yielded no hits. The sixth exon is present on a separate randomly ordered gene fragment within the AC148976.2 contig.</p><p><italic>Psg-ps1 </italic>was previously considered to be a pseudogene, based on a point deletion at nucleotide position 30, downstream from the canonical <italic>Psg </italic>translational start site [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. However, despite this frame shift, the open reading frame of this unusual <italic>Psg </italic>continues 105 bp upstream of the site of the mutation to an alternative ATG. Inspection of the sequence revealed a Kozak consensus, and BLAST analysis of the public EST and Trace Archive EST databases yielded many mRNA clones that contain this region in addition to downstream exons. Hence, this gene is clearly expressed, and we now propose to rename <italic>Psg-ps1 </italic>as <italic>Psg32 </italic>hereafter. We note that this mutation and amino terminal extension abolishes the canonical PSG secretory signal and peptide cleavage site. We therefore suggest that if <italic>Psg32 </italic>is indeed translated, the resulting protein is retained within the cytoplasm. To determine if the deletion observed in BALB/c mice was also present in other murine strains, we amplified and sequenced a 146 bp fragment by PCR using a set of primers specific for the 5'-untranslated region and the leader peptide of Psg32. The deletion observed in the <italic>Psg32 </italic>cDNA is also present in the genomic DNA of A/J, C57BL6/J, YBR/Ei, and SWR/J inbred mouse strains (data not shown).</p><p>The nomenclature (past and current) and accession numbers of nucleotide sequences of all the murine PSGs are documented in Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>.

From examination of the data in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A(i)</xref> it was not apparent from which progenitor domain the <italic>Psg24 </italic>N5 domain evolved due to lack of confidence in the branch on which it lies. However, using the alignment identities in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B(i)</xref> it can be seen that, although generally poorly conserved, the best match of 51.2% was obtained by alignment with the N2 domain. Therefore, our evolutionary model assumes that the <italic>Psg24 </italic>N5 domain arose from an early duplication of the N2 domain. Also, based on agreement of the data in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A(i)</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B(i)</xref>, the N2 domain duplicated again more recently to yield the N3 domain.

Expansion is predicted to have occurred in 2 or 3 separate events in a common ancestor of <italic>Psg30 </italic>and <italic>Psg31</italic>. In the first instance the progenitor N3-like and N2-like domains were duplicated, either at different points in evolution or at the same time.

As <italic>Psg </italic>genes are expressed predominantly in the placenta, cDNA was prepared from total RNA extracted from mouse placenta at four stages of development between E10.5 and E17.5. <italic>Psg </italic>cDNA sequences were then amplified with PCR primers designed to amplify <italic>Psg16 </italic>&#x02013; <italic>Psg29 </italic>inclusive.

However, after blotting the products onto nylon membranes and hybridising radiolabelled oligonucleotide probes specific for individual <italic>Psg </italic>genes (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref>), we observed significant differences in expression profiles of different genes during development. This method is probably semi-quantitative at best but does give some indication of relative expression levels.

The currently poorly resolved data covering this region in the the Ensembl assembly implies the presence of a gap between <italic>Psg29 </italic>and <italic>Psg32</italic>. However, we determined that the subclusters are fused between <italic>Psg32 </italic>and <italic>Psg30/Psg18</italic>. YAC F10104 (which is non-chimeric) is about 460 kb long and contains only two <italic>Psg </italic>genes which indicates the presence of a non-<italic>Psg </italic>genomic region. We estimate the gap between the subclusters to be approximately 400 kb based on the size of cosmids containing two <italic>Psg </italic>genes (ca. 40 kb).</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>The human <italic>PSG </italic>genomic data in the public databases are relatively complete. For each <italic>PSG </italic>gene, there are annotated RefSeq resources comprising information on genomic structure, transcripts and translation products. The nomenclature is also standardised [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]. Further, there are accurate chromosome 19 locus assignments allowing complete visualisation of the <italic>PSG </italic>locus and surrounding genes. In contrast, a substantial quantity of mouse <italic>Psg </italic>genomic data in the public domain is fragmented, incomplete and somewhat unreliable. We sought to collate the existing genomic data, to present novel data to fill in gaps, and to provide a coherent resource of mouse <italic>Psg </italic>genomic data.</p><p>To determine whether the existing set of mouse <italic>Psg </italic>genes was complete we performed systematic BLAST searches of a variety of public DNA sequence databases. This analysis revealed the existence of a novel expressed <italic>Psg </italic>gene, which we name <italic>Psg31 </italic>in line with the accepted nomenclature convention [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]. <italic>Psg31 </italic>apparently evolved from a duplication of the whole of the <italic>Psg30 </italic>gene followed by a subsequent internal duplication of the N1 domain. We were also able to predict the complete coding sequences of four <italic>Psg </italic>genes for which previously only partial fragments were described. The gene, CDS and protein sequences of these predictions, coupled with a complete reference of all known mouse <italic>Psg </italic>CDS and primary protein sequences are provided in three attached Additional Files.</p><p>Using the full CDS information obtained for the complete set of mouse <italic>Psg </italic>gene sequences, domain structures for all family members were predicted. All of the PSG proteins possess previously described arrangements of Ig-like domains. Except for two members, discussed below, all are predicted to encode N-terminal secretory signal sequences. Our predicted novel splice variant of <italic>Psg16 </italic>has a complete N1 domain and secretory signal peptide sequence. Trace Archive EST database BLAST analysis confirmed that this variant is expressed in the placenta. In contrast, the brain-expressed variant [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>] has only a partial N1 domain and no secretory signal peptide. The previously described <italic>Psg-ps1 </italic>pseudogene [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>] was found to be expressed in the placenta using Trace Archive EST database BLAST analysis and possesses an excellent Kozak sequence at the predicted translational initiation site. This evidence therefore indicates that this gene, which we rename <italic>Psg32</italic>, is not a pseudogene but a <italic>bona fide </italic>expressed <italic>Psg </italic>gene family member. The <italic>Psg32 </italic>transcript may encode a protein that is retained within the cytoplasm. We note that a precedent in the human exists in the form of a non-secreted splice variant of <italic>PSG11 </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>].</p><p><italic>Psg31 </italic>has the unusual N1-N1*-N2-N3-N4-N5-N6-N7-A domain structure. This newly characterised <italic>Psg </italic>gene has evolved from a duplication of the entire <italic>Psg30 </italic>gene followed by an internal duplication of the N1 domain. There may be functional significance associated with the N1 domain duplication. The complex nature of <italic>Psg </italic>gene evolution, including putative gene conversion and recombination events between family members [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>], makes it difficult to analyse their evolution. Despite this, the data generated from ClustalX alignments and NJ trees enabled us to generate trees that allow prediction of the order of events of domain duplications in <italic>Psg24</italic>, <italic>Psg30 </italic>and <italic>Psg31</italic>. We note that the apparent route to domain number expansion differed between <italic>Psg24</italic>, and <italic>Psg30 </italic>and <italic>Psg31</italic>. The extra N-domains of <italic>Psg24 </italic>are derived from two duplications of the N2 domain. However, for <italic>Psg30 </italic>and <italic>Psg31</italic>, independent duplications of each of the N2 and N3 domains were probably followed by a secondary duplication of the daughter domains, possibly as a single event.</p><p>Gene expression data from RT-PCR of placental RNA and EST database analysis revealed considerable differences in the expression levels of different <italic>Psg </italic>genes. In this analysis <italic>Psg21 </italic>and <italic>Psg23 </italic>were the most abundant, consistent with a previous report of abundant <italic>Psg23 </italic>expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>]. Whilst there was generally good agreement between the two methods of expression analysis we cannot determine, based on current data, whether <italic>Psg </italic>gene expression differences reflect selection for divergent functions, or increased gene dosage for enhancement of an existing function, because expression levels were uniformly low for many family members, and there was a general trend of increased expression during gestation. <italic>Psg </italic>transcripts are found from day 6.5 of embryonic development onward in primary trophoblast giant cells, later (from day 10.5) in spongiotrophoblast cells and, to a lesser extent, in a cell population in the deciduas basalis at day 14.5 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>]. At present, it is unclear whether the various <italic>Psg </italic>genes exhibit different cellular expression patterns, which might indicate divergent functions of the various PSGs. There are interesting parallels between the expansion of the <italic>Psg </italic>gene family and similar expansions of other placentally-expressed gene families such as the prolactin and growth hormone families [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>], and the aspartic and cysteine proteases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>]. Such duplications may be a manifestation of parent-offspring conflict or inter-sibling rivalry over maternal investment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>].</p><p>Having collated all known mouse <italic>Psg </italic>gene protein coding sequences and protein domain structures, the mouse <italic>Psg </italic>genomic locus on chromosome 7 remained to be determined to complete a comprehensive resource for the analysis of <italic>Psg </italic>function. The NCBI build 32 composite mouse assembly data revealed that only four <italic>Psg</italic>s had been mapped. Other <italic>Psg</italic>s on contig NT_039395 are currently unordered. We therefore screened cosmid, YAC and BAC libraries, and orientated <italic>Psg</italic>-containing clones to identify, where possible, the order of <italic>Psg </italic>genes within the locus. We were not able to resolve all ambiguities in gene order on our map; however, where public database information is available, our data are in good agreement. We found no clear relationship between gene location and gene expression level suggesting that, within the <italic>Psg </italic>locus, each <italic>Psg </italic>gene is autonomously regulated.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>The evolution and physiological functions of the relatively understudied mouse <italic>Psg </italic>gene family are poorly understood. This is a feature shared with other placentally-expressed, multigene families such as the prolactin and growth hormone genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. In order to provide a comprehensive resource to facilitate functional studies of mouse <italic>Psg </italic>genes, including the generation of mouse mutants with modified <italic>Psg </italic>gene expression profiles, we have collated the entire set of mouse <italic>Psg </italic>genes, their predicted encoded proteins, and their evolutionary histories. The complete CDS data will enable the cloning, over-expression, and gene targeting of individual or multiple mouse <italic>Psg </italic>genes. This will facilitate the elucidation of their function and, by extrapolation, their human homologues, which may be involved in diseases of pregnancy.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Isolation of cosmid, YAC and BAC clones</title><p>Cosmid libraries in pWE15 which were made from liver DNA of BALB/c and C57BL/6 mice were obtained from Dr. Edwin N.
