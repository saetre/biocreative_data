In an attempt to better understand hEST1A function, we have started to dissect the molecular interactions between hEST1A and telomerase. Here, we demonstrate that the interaction between hEST1A and telomerase is mediated by protein&#x02013;RNA and protein&#x02013;protein contacts. We identify a domain within hEST1A that binds the telomerase RNA moiety hTR while full-length hEST1A establishes in addition RNase-resistant and hTR-independent protein&#x02013;protein contacts with the human telomerase reverse transcriptase polypeptide (TERT). Conversely, within hTERT, we identify a hEST1A interaction domain, which comprises hTR-binding activity and RNA-independent hEST1A-binding activity. Purified, recombinant hEST1A binds the telomerase RNA moiety (hTR) with high affinity (apparent overall <italic>K</italic><sub>d</sub> = 25 nM) but low specificity. We propose that hEST1A assembles specifically with telomerase in the context of the hTR&#x02013;hTERT ribonucleoprotein, through the high affinity of hEST1A for hTR and specific protein&#x02013;protein contacts with hTERT.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Human EST1A/SMG6 (below referred to as hEST1A), EST1B/SMG5 and EST1C/SMG7 were identified through their sequence similarity with the <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae Ever Shorter Telomeres 1</italic> (Est1) gene product and the <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> and <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD) factors CeSMG5, CeSMG6 and CeSMG7 and DmSMG5 and DmSMG6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1 B2 B3">1&#x02013;3</xref>). NMD leads to rapid decay of mRNAs that carry premature stop codons. Immunoprecipitation experiments using antibodies raised against hEST1A and hEST1B revealed association of these polypeptides with telomerase activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>). We could not detect association between hEST1C/SMG7 and telomerase in co-immunoprecipitation experiments (Nele Hug and J. Lingner, unpublished data). Telomerase association is particularly evident for hEST1A, which appears to associate with &#x0223c;70% of active telomerase affinity purified from HeLa cell extracts. Consistent with a direct function of hEST1A at telomeres is its detection at telomeres <italic>in vivo</italic> by chromatin immunoprecipitation (Claus Azzalin and J. Lingner, manuscript submitted for publication). Over-expression of hEST1A in the human fibrosarcoma-derived cell line HT1080 induces telomere&#x02013;telomere associations causing chromosome bridges during anaphase and a rapid apoptotic response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>). Telomeric fusions in hEST1A-over-expressing cells may stem from telomere uncapping followed by DNA break repair, reminiscent of the loss of function phenotype of the double strand telomere-binding protein TRF2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>). Thus, we hypothesize that endogenous hEST1A is involved in modulating the telomere structure. Over-expression of full-length hEST1A in kidney 293T cells leads to progressive telomere shortening (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>). This effect could be reversed by co-expression of telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT), suggesting that the shortening depends on modulation of telomerase. Thus, hEST1A may also regulate telomere length. In the yeasts <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> and <italic>Schizosaccharomyces pombe</italic>, the <italic>EST1</italic> genes are required for telomerase-mediated telomere elongation <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>). <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> Est1p recruits telomerase to chromosome 3&#x02032; ends through a direct physical interaction with the telomere end-binding protein Cdc13 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>). It is unknown if the human EST1-proteins play a similar essential role for telomerase activation at chromosome ends.</p><p>The involvement of human EST1A-C/SMG5-7 in NMD has been substantiated in knock-down experiments, which leads to an increase in abundance of NMD-reporter constructs carrying premature stop codons, and of endogenous mRNAs that are regulated by this pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>). Worm SMG5-7 are involved in the PP2A-mediated dephosphorylation of UPF1, a highly conserved 5&#x02032; to 3&#x02032; helicase playing a central role in NMD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>) and genome stability [(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>); (see below)]. SiRNA-mediated depletion of human EST1A-C/SMG5-7 leads to impairment of NMD and accumulation of hyperphosphorylated UPF1, over-expression of hEST1A/SMG6 promotes dephosphorylation of UPF1 and hEST1B/SMG5 and hEST1C/SMG7 are found in complexes with phospho-UPF1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>). Thus, the role of SMG5-7 proteins in the phosphorylation cycle of UPF1 appear to be conserved between worms and humans.</p><p>The above studies suggest that human EST1-polypeptides may have dual functions in telomere maintenance and RNA surveillance pathways. Indeed, an intimate relation between genome and RNA surveillance pathways is also suggested by the findings that the human phosphoinositide 3-kinase-related protein kinase (PIKK) SMG1 is required for optimal activation of p53 upon genotoxic stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>). Also UPF1 is required for genome stability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>). Depletion of UPF1 causes human cells to arrest early in S-phase inducing an ATR-dependent DNA damage response. A fraction of UPF1 associates with chromatin in S-phase and upon &#x003b3;-irradiation, supporting a direct role in genome stability. In contrast, downregulation of the NMD factor UPF2 does not interfere with cell cycle progression and DNA stability, supporting the notion that effects on genome stability are not due to a general loss in NMD and that only some NMD factors play a role in genome stability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>). Towards an attempt to understand the putative roles of hEST1A in telomere/genome stability and RNA surveillance pathways, we identify here functional domains of hEST1A that mediate the interaction with telomerase. We identify a high affinity RNA-binding domain in hEST1A and detect RNA-independent protein&#x02013;protein interactions that mediate assembly with telomerase. We also identify a segment within the N-terminal part of hTERT, which enables association with hEST1A.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Protein expression and purification</title><p>A GST-tag encoding DNA fragment was amplified by PCR from the pGEX-6P1 vector (GE Healthcare) and subcloned in the pFastBac vector (Invitrogen).

Forty-eight hour post-infection, nuclear extracts were prepared as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>) with slight modifications. Infected Hi5 cell pellets harvested from 135 mm plates (1.5 &#x000d7; 10<sup>7</sup> cells before infection) were resuspended in 5.75 ml of cold buffer A (50 mM Tris&#x02013;HCl pH 8.0, 100 mM KCl, 0.1 mM PMSF, 0.1 mM EDTA, 0.1 mM DTT, 0.3% NP40) and kept on ice for 15&#x02013;20 min for cell lysis. After centrifugation for 5 min at 500<italic>g</italic> at 4&#x000b0;C, the nuclei containing pellet was washed three times with 1 ml buffer A, repeating in between the centrifugation step.

The mixture was centrifuged for 5 min with maximal velocity at 4&#x000b0;C. Tween 20 and glycerol were added to final concentrations of 0.2 and 10%, respectively, to the nuclear extract corresponding supernatant. 0.21 ml slurry of glutathione-Sepharose beads (GE Healthcare) were washed with cold 1&#x000d7; PBS and equilibrated with buffer B supplemented with 0.2% Tween 20 and 10% glycerol. The nuclear extract was added to these beads and incubated at 4&#x000b0;C for 1.5 h on a wheel. The flow through was collected upon centrifugation for 1 min at 500<italic>g</italic> at 4&#x000b0;C.

GST&#x02013;hEST1A was eluted from the beads with 0.21 ml of cold GEB buffer (buffer EB containing 20 mM GSH) after incubation at 4&#x000b0;C for 45 min on a wheel. The recovered supernatant was applied to a small disposable filter column (Biorad) to remove the remaining beads. The elution step was repeated two more times for 15 min. Upon purification, the GST&#x02013;hEST1A polypeptide was estimated to be more than 90% pure.

In order to test the ability of hEST1A to bind the telomerase RNA moiety hTR, RNA band shift experiments were carried out (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>). Increasing amounts of GST&#x02013;hEST1A were incubated with [<sup>32</sup>P]-5&#x02032;-end labeled <italic>in vitro</italic> transcribed hTR. Separation of the fractions on non-denaturing polyacrylamide gels indicated formation of slower migrating GST&#x02013;hEST1A&#x02013;hTR complexes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>A). The experimental data for overall hEST1A&#x02013;hTR-binding fitted best a theoretical curve with a <italic>K</italic><sub>d</sub> of 25 nM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>A). The spread-out appearance of the GST&#x02013;hEST1A&#x02013;hTR complexes may be due to conformational flexibility, complex heterogeneity and concomitant binding of several hEST1A polypeptides per hTR molecule (see below). Thus this analysis gives an estimate for the overall <italic>Kd</italic> of hEST1A&#x02013;hTR complexes without distinguishing individual subtypes. Other gel recipes, removal of the GST-tag from hEST1A or the use of hTR fragments did not reduce the heterogeneity. To test binding affinity for different domains of hTR, different fragments of hTR were transcribed <italic>in vitro</italic> and tested for their ability to inhibit the formation of the full-length GST&#x02013;hEST1A&#x02013;hTR complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>B). The &#x00394;-Pseudo fragment had a similar capacity as unlabeled full-length hTR, to compete for the formation of the [<sup>32</sup>P]-labeled full-length GST&#x02013;hEST1A&#x02013;hTR complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>B). However, two other hTR fragments (Pseudo and &#x00394;CR45) also competed well with hTR for hEST1A-binding at slightly higher concentrations. Since the three tested hTR fragments contained distinct non-overlapping domains, this indicated several hEST1A&#x02013;hTR interaction sites. To further address specificity of RNA binding, other non-related RNAs were tested in a competition experiment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>C). This experiment indicated that the affinity of hEST1A for rRNA is similar as for hTR, while tRNA competes only at &#x0223c;20-fold higher concentration, indicating very low affinity of hEST1A for this RNA. Heparin efficiently inhibited hTR binding. <fig id="F2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><p>Recombinant GST&#x02013;hEST1A interacts with hTR with high affinity but low specificity.

The extent of hTR destruction by RNase A treatment was determined by assessing presence of hTR upon Northern hybridization of dotblots with a randomly labeled full-length hTR probe (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>C). Approximately 99% of the hTR signal disappeared in extracts and more than 95% of the signal disappeared in the immunoprecipitates upon RNase A treatment. Immunoprecipitated full-length FLAG-hEST1A co-immunoprecipitated Myc-EID (hTERT-fragment 147&#x02013;311) and this interaction was not alleviated upon RNase A treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>A, compare lanes 5 and 6 on the right panel). Thus, while EID is able to bind hTR it establishes also protein&#x02013;protein contacts with hEST1A.

We show here that hEST1A associates with telomerase through dual interactions with the telomerase RNA moiety and the TERT. The TRID is contained within a 168 amino acid fragment in the N-terminal part of hEST1A, a region that does not contain any recognizable structural motifs or sequence homologies with other proteins in the database. TRID binds to hTR with high overall affinity (25 nM) but low specificity. Distinct non-overlapping fragments of hTR as well as rRNA competed for binding of full-length hTR with similar efficiency while tRNA was a poor ligand for hEST1A. TRID is also distinct from the DNA-binding domain of hEST1A (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>), which resides more N-terminal [amino acids 1&#x02013;208, Lea Harrington's laboratory (Toronto, personal communication)]. Low specificity of RNA binding was also observed <italic>in vitro</italic> with yeast Est1p, which displayed a similar affinity (50 nM) for the yeast telomerase RNA TLC1 and other RNA substrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>). However, <italic>in vivo</italic> a bulged stem of TLC1, which has no obvious counterpart in human telomerase RNA, mediates association with Est1p (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>). Thus, it is conceivable that similarly to yeast Est1p, hEST1A also interacts with a specific hTR structure <italic>in vivo</italic> in the context of the assembled hTR-hTERT complex. This would be analogous to some ribosomal proteins, which achieve RNA sequence-specific binding only in the context of a partially assembled ribonucleoprotein particle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>).</p><p>Consistent with this notion, we also identify protein-mediated interactions between hEST1A and TERT. TRID interacts with EID in a strictly RNA-dependent manner whereas full-length hEST1A remains associated with hTERT or with EID even upon digestion of hTR with RNases, or when expressed in a cell line that lacks hTR. Consistent with our results in cell culture, telomerase RNA-independent association of hEST1A and hTERT was observed in RRL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>). It remains to be determined which domains outside of TRID establish protein-mediated interactions with TERT. Interestingly, the EST1/TPR domain of the hEST1A/SMG6-related SMG7/hEST1C polypeptide has a 14-3-3 fold with a classic phosphoserine-binding pocket (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>). However, other regions of the protein could also be involved.</p><p>We also identified a TERT domain that associates with hEST1A. The EID is comprised between amino acids 147&#x02013;311. EID contains hTR-binding activity and at the same time it establishes RNase-resistant contacts with hEST1A. Previous studies with hTERT have identified two regions responsible for interactions with TR, termed RNA interaction domain (RID) 1 and 2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>). The C-terminal part of RID1 (amino acids 1&#x02013;250), which associates with the hTR template-pseudoknot domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>) overlaps with the N-terminal part of EID (amino acids 147&#x02013;311). A hTERT fragment containing the entire RID1 and EID regions did not pull-down more hTR than EID on its own (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>) suggesting that EID and RID1 contain one and the same RNA-binding domain. However, deletion of residues 1&#x02013;24 in RID1 abolished binding of the template-pseudoknot domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>), suggesting that either the RNA-binding activity in EID is distinct from RID1 or that the 1&#x02013;25&#x00394; RID1-mutant displayed a folding problem that abolished RNA-binding activity. Interestingly, the recently solved structure of a <italic>Tetrahymena</italic> TERT region named TEN, which corresponds to human RID1, shows a positively charged flexible C-terminal tail. This tail, which is present at the N-terminus of EID has been proposed to be involved in telomerase protein&#x02013;RNA interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>). No functions have been assigned before to the C-terminal part of EID. Scanning mutagenesis with short linkers did not identify hTERT-mutants in this region that abolished telomerase function <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>), but protein&#x02013;protein interactions may involve larger surfaces that were not fully inactivated with this approach. Furthermore, hEST1A&#x02013;hTR interactions may partially compensate for the loss of direct hTERT&#x02013;hEST1A contacts.</p><p>The regulation of human telomerase at telomeres and the putative role of hEST1A in this process are poorly understood at the molecular level. The functional analysis of hEST1A has been hampered by its involvement in NMD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>) and essential roles of hEST1A for S-phase progression presumably in conjunction UPF1 ((<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>) and unpublished data). <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> Est1p is thought to mediate telomerase recruitment through its direct interaction with Cdc13p, which binds to the telomeric 3&#x02032; overhang (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>). POT1, the putative human ortholog of Cdc13p inhibits telomerase activity <italic>in vitro</italic> when bound to the 3&#x02032;end of a telomeric oligonucleotide substrate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>). Trials to detect a physical interaction between POT1 and hEST1A have been unsuccessful so far and addition of recombinant hEST1A to <italic>in vitro</italic> assays could also not alleviate the inhibitory effects of POT1 on telomerase activity (our unpublished data). However, telomerase recruitment by <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> Cdc13p and Est1p has also not yet been reproduced <italic>in vitro</italic>. The here reported identification and characterization of functional domains of hEST1A that mediate interaction with telomerase may allow to specifically disrupt these interactions to understand the possible roles of hEST1A in telomere length control and telomere capping.</p></sec><sec><title>SUPPLEMENTARY DATA</title><p>Supplementary Data are available at NAR Online.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material id="PMC_1" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>[Supplementary Data]</title></caption><media mimetype="text" mime-subtype="html" xlink:href="nar_gkm724_index.html"/><media xlink:role="associated-file" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="nar_gkm724_nar-01445-w-2007-File009.tif"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS</title><p>We thank Isabel Kurth for affinity-purified telomerase from insect cells and for technical advice, Claus Azzalin for comments on the manuscript and Lea Harrington for communicating unpublished results.
