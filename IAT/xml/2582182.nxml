In many cases, it appears to play dual roles: first, it is essential for transporting particular organelles to specific locations, and second, once the organelles are appropriately localized, dynein plays a role in anchoring them there. Many of these cargos are transported along microtubules in a bi-directional fashion, involving the activity of a plus-end motor such as a kinesin family member and the activity of the minus-end motion dynein.</p><p>The regulation of this bi-directional transport, or even uni-directional dynein-based motion alone, is not well understood. However, past work has uncovered a role for the protein BicD in facilitating dynein function in a number of systems. In many of these systems, loss of BicD function results in mislocalization of the cargo. Most of these studies have not involved real-time imaging and analysis. Therefore, it has not been clear to what extent the loss of BicD function alters actual transport of the cargo in question, as opposed to what extent it plays an essential role in anchoring the cargo once it is appropriately delivered.</p><p>BicD was originally identified in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, in a mutant screen for dominant maternal-effect proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003763-Mohler1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>. BicD mutant embryos exhibited severe developmental defects including the loss of positional information defining the anterior region of the embryo and thereby giving rise to bicaudal embryos.

Dashed lines indicate an approximate position based on data from mammalian BicD homologs. Regions displayed represent published data and not necessarily minimal binding sites. C: Ovarian BicD levels in heat-shock rescued BicD<sup>null</sup> ovaries are quite low compared to wild-type. Levels seen during repeat daily heat-shocks (t&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;0), and three days post heat shock cessation (t&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;3) are shown in comparison to wild type. Lanes were loaded with equivalent amounts of total lysate. D: Specifically examining ovarian BicD expression in t&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;3 ovaries indicates expressions levels approximately 1&#x00025; of that in wild-type.

E: A comparison of embryonic BicD expression between heat shock rescued embryos whose mothers have been off heat shock for one versus three days. F: The decrease in ovarian levels results in a decrease in embryonic levels: a comparison of BicD levels in embryos from OrR females (left) and BicD<sup>null</sup>/t&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;1 females (right).

This is consistent with the studies of BicD's role in <italic>Drosophila</italic> mRNA transport, where overexpression of BicD leads to increased association of dynein with the mRNA particles <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003763-Bullock2">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>. Thus, one currently favored hypothesis is that BicD is a structural protein required for dynein localization. Tools have not existed to investigate the possibility that it might play important regulatory roles as well.</p><p>Here, we investigate BicD's function within the context of bi-directional lipid droplet based transport. In contrast to other systems where BicD has been studied, the particular strength of the droplets is that it is possible to image them with high temporal and spatial resolution, allowing a careful study of how loss of BicD affects the properties of motion. Further, the possibility of biochemical purifications of droplets means that it is possible to investigate additional aspects of BicD's function. Importantly, while the droplets always move bi-directionally, they undergo developmentally controlled changes in net transport<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003763-Welte1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>. Early in development (nuclear division cycles 11&#x02013;13) the droplets move but with no net transport (&#x0201c;phase I&#x0201d;). Then, in early cycle 14, the droplets move basally (net plus-end transport, &#x0201c;phase II&#x0201d;). Finally, in later cycle 14 there is net minus-end transport (&#x0201c;phase III&#x0201d;). Thus, by studying changes in droplet-bound proteins at different times during development, it is in principle possible to gain insight into how transport is regulated<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003763-Welte2">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>We show that while BicD may help to recruit dynein to the cargo, it is not absolutely essential for at least partial dynein recruitment. Also, its role is more complicated than performing this task alone: during development, the majority of BicD leaves the droplet, but the dynein stays, and this subsequent departure of BicD does not obviously alter dynein function. Our measurements uncover a new role for BicD, in directly or indirectly contributing to plus-end motor activity. Finally, analysis of an intriguing BicD point mutation uncovers a clear ongoing temporally changing regulatory role for BicD.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><p>Because BicD is reported to play a role in either the transport or positioning of multiple organelles, and we have already established that our droplets are moved by dynein <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003763-Gross1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>, we were interested in determining if BicD also played a role in lipid droplet transport. Globally, the distribution of lipid droplets in the embryo can be visualized using the neutral-lipid specific dye, Nile Red (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003763-g002">Fig. 2C</xref>), and also by transmitted light microscopy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003763-g002">Fig. 2A, B</xref>).</p><fig id="pone-0003763-g002" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0003763.g002</object-id><label>Figure 2</label><caption><title>Lowering BicD expression has a net effect on lipid droplet transport.</title><p>A and B: Transmitted light images of developing BicD<sup>null</sup> (t&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;3) embryos indicate proper lipid droplet clearing in phase II (A), but an inability to recloud in phase III (B). C: Prior to Phase 3, during germband extension, the neutral-lipid specific dye Nile Red shows a net position of lipid droplets which is very different between wild-type and BicD<sup>null</sup> embryos. D: During germband extension, DAPI autoflouresence of yolk vesicles does not indicate a significantly different positioning of these cargoes. Dashed lines delineate the embryos edge. E: No gross defects are observed in the MT structure of mutant embryos, as exemplified by the above image of MT immunoflouresence. Both images show microtubules passing from above, between, and below the syncytial nuclei. F: BicD localizes to the layer of lipid droplets which spin up through a sucrose gradient during centrifugation from an initial embryo lysate due to their bouyent density. Equal volumes of extracted sample were loaded per lane of the western. BicD signal can be found in the pellet, the layer immediately above the pellet (-800), and at the surface where lipid droplets coalesce. G: Confocal analysis of whole fixed embryos shows some BicD signal (green) close to droplets (red). Red signal represents the droplets specific marker LSD2. Lipid droplets generally average approximately 500 nm in size. H and I: With less magnification, standard fluorescence microscopy shows significant punctual staining of the cytoplasm in Phase I wild-type embryos (H) but not in Phase I, BicD<sup>null</sup> (t&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;3) embryos (I). Here, green is BicD, and red is the lipid droplet specific protein LSD2. J and K: Phase II DIC images show a clear difference in the number of lipid droplets near the nuclei. Dashed lines specify the position of the nuclei and red arrows are shown indicating the position of several lipid droplets. L: Automated analysis of the number of droplets observed per frame, in phase II, confirms the apparent decrease in droplets seen at the periphery of the embryo in &#x02018;t&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;1&#x02019; and &#x02018;t&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;3&#x02013;4&#x02019; mutant backgrounds.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="pone.0003763.g002"/></fig><p>To investigate whether BicD played a role in droplet motion, we first wanted to decrease the overall amount of embryonic BicD, and determine whether this had any effect on droplet transport. Because the proteins in early embryos are predominantly maternally derived, and the complete loss of BicD is lethal, it has not been possible to generate embryos entirely lacking in BicD. Instead, we used a strategy based on a previously developed heat shock rescue technique to deliver just enough wild-type BicD to rescue otherwise BicD<sup>null</sup> females <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003763-Swan1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>. Upon cessation of heat-shocking, ovarian BicD levels fell quickly. Continued for one hour per day, heat shocks of otherwise null mothers produced significantly less ovarian BicD than did wild-type mothers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003763-g001">Fig. 1C</xref>). Also, by three to four days post heat shock (t&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;3,4), ovarian BicD levels appeared to be slightly less than 1/64<sup>th</sup> wild type levels&#x02013;i.e., approximately 1&#x00025; of wild type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003763-g001">Fig. 1D</xref>). This loss of ovarian BicD resulted in a decrease in embryonic BicD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003763-g001">Fig. 1F</xref>); BicD in t&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;1 embryos was approximately 1.6&#x00025; that in wildtype embros (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003763-g001">Fig. 1G</xref>). Additionally, in the low BicD- embryos, BicD levels continued to decrease as a function of time from heat shock: there is an approximate 6-fold difference between BicD levels at one day post heat shock (t&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;1) and three to four days post heat shock (t&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;3,4) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003763-g001">Fig. 1E</xref>). Thus, in t&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;3,4 embryos, we calculate that BicD levels are &#x0223c;0.267&#x00025; of wild-type, i.e. have been reduced more than 300&#x000d7;.</p><p>Using this technique therefore allowed us to achieve very low&#x02013;and tunable&#x02013;embryonic BicD levels. Examining the droplets in these embryos, we discovered that the loss of BicD had a number of effects. First, even when droplets are developmentally &#x02018;clearing&#x02019; from the embryo's edge (in Phase II), there were many fewer droplets obvious in this peripheral region of the low BicD embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003763-g002">Fig. 2K, L</xref>) as compared to wild-type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003763-g002">Fig. 2J, L</xref>). This could simply reflect a redistribution of droplets to the embryo center (where we are unable to quantify droplet distribution), or could reflects an overall decrease of embryonic droplets present in the embryo in this background. Second, loss of BicD severely altered the global droplet distribution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003763-g002">Fig. 2A&#x02013;C</xref>): droplets cleared in phase II, but failed to re-cloud in phase III.</p><p>To further understand how this altered global distribution of droplets came about, we considered a number of possibilities. The first was that loss of BicD led to an altered microtubule network in the embryos. To test this idea, we used confocal microscopy to visualize the microtubule network in fixed intact embryos. While the microtubules in the mutants appear slightly more disorganized, variation between different embryos is seen in the microtubule organization in both wild-type and mutants, and we observed no gross defects in the microtubules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003763-g002">Fig. 2E</xref>). To further test the viability of the microtubule network, we examined the distribution of another cargo, yolk vesicles, whose distribution was previously shown<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003763-Foe1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref> to depend on intact microtubules. Their distribution was approximately normal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003763-g002">Fig. 2D</xref>). Thus, we hypothesize that the altered lipid droplet distribution was due to either altered droplet transport, or impaired ability to anchor the droplets once they were delivered.</p><sec id="s2a"><title>BicD likely contributes to appropriate droplet transport directly, through a role on the droplets</title><p>Past studies have shown that the N-terminal portion of mammalian BicD can co-precipitate components of both the dynein and dynactin complexes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003763-Hoogenraad1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003763-Hoogenraad2">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>. Also, BicD homologs have been shown to directly bind dynein intermediate chain <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003763-Fumoto1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>, the dynamitin subunit of dynactin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003763-Hoogenraad1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>, and kinesin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003763-Grigoriev1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref> (see also <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003763-g001">Fig. 1B</xref>). This suggests that, for lipid droplets as well, BicD might facilitate appropriate transport via direct interaction with the transport machinery. To test whether BicD might play a direct role in droplet transport, we first investigated whether BicD was indeed present on the droplets. A first analysis involved purifying droplets, by spinning lipids from an embryo lysate through a simple sucrose step gradient. We saw, via western, that BicD signal was found on the lipids spun to the surface and at or near the pellet. However, it was not detectable in the fractions immediately below the surface lipids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003763-g002">Fig. 2F</xref>). This suggested that BicD was not simply everywhere in the gradient. Using the same antibodies for immunoflouresence (in the whole embryo) clearly demonstrated a general lack of BicD signal in the t&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;3 background as compared to wild-type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003763-g002">Fig. 2H, I</xref>). In wild-type embryos strong punctae were observed, which were predominantly lacking in the BicD-low mutant. Some of these punctae were found close to lipid droplets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003763-g002">Fig. 2G</xref>). Subsequent larger volume and higher speed lipid purifications (used our previously developed protocol to purify lipid droplets) confirmed BicD's presence in the droplet fraction. Extensive characterization of the purification protocol <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003763-Cermelli1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref> has established that the lipid droplet fraction does not have large contaminants. The presence of BicD on the droplets is consistent with a direct role in facilitating/regulating transport.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Lowered embryonic BicD levels alter individual droplet motion</title><p>To differentiate between an actual transport problem and simply a problem tethering droplets once they are delivered, we analyzed the motion of droplets with high temporal and spatial resolution. While a global analysis suggested a role for BicD in controlling the Phase III distribution of lipid droplets, altered transport in Phase II could in principle contribute to phenotypes observed in Phase III. We therefore recorded and analyzed droplet motion in both phase II and III. We initially examined motion in Or-R embryos (wild-type, phase II, N&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;9 embryos, n&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;305 droplets tracked; phase IIB, N&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;3 embryos, n&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;143 droplets; phase III, N&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;2 embryos, n&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;45 droplets), t&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;1 embryos (low BicD, phase II, N&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;11 embryos, n&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;52 droplets; phase IIB,N&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;9 embryos, n&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;18 droplets) and t&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;3,4 embryos (BicD&#x0223c;null, phase II, N&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;7 embryos, n&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;19 droplets; phase IIB, N&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;5 embryos, n&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;12 droplets; phase III,N&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;5 embryos, n&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;50 droplets). Comparing wild-type motion to motion in the t&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;3 background, we find that loss of BicD shortened both plus-end and minus-end run in phase II, but only minus-end runs in phase III (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003763-g003">Fig. 3A, B</xref>). While we presume that decreased overall embryonic BicD levels result in decreased droplet-bound BicD levels (consistent with the disappearance of BicD puncta in the low-BicD embryos, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003763-g002">Fig 2</xref>), we cannot directly show this because we cannot purify droplets from the limited number of developing mutant embryos.</p><fig id="pone-0003763-g003" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0003763.g003</object-id><label>Figure 3</label><caption><title>Droplet distribution is altered due to BicD-induced changes in Droplet motion.</title><p>A: BicD contributes to correct minus-end motion.

Chronologically, this phase of transport lasts for &#x0223c;10 minutes, and appears to coincide with the reversal of the net direction of transport. In the t&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;3 (&#x0223c;null) embryos, this phase does not occur: the quantitative parameters of droplet motion in phase II t&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;3 embryos are the same as for phase IIb t&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;3 embryos (t-test, p&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;0.56). Thus, the presence of BicD is somehow required for the regulatory changes involved in control of this set of changes in droplet motion. Intriguingly, in the t&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;1 embryos where there is a small yet significant residual amount of BicD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003763-g001">Fig. 1E</xref>), some form of the Phase II&#x02192;IIb transition occurs, but its form is different: in the t&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;1 embryos, the plus-end run lengths go down instead of up (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003763-g003">Fig. 3</xref>). This is statistically obvious for plus-end runs (t-test, p&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;5.3&#x000d7;10<sup>&#x02212;4</sup>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003763-g003">Fig. 3B</xref>), and there is a hint that this might be true for minus-end motion as well (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003763-g003">Fig. 3A</xref>), although we cannot be certain because the effect in the minus-end direction is small, and within uncertainty (t-test, p&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;0.12). Regardless, the decrease in plus-end run lengths during the phase II to IIb transition of the t&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;1 embryos (t-test, p&#x0003c;0.04), is in the opposite direction from the change seen in wild-type where run-lengths increase (t-test, p&#x0003c;0.04), suggesting that the exact levels of BicD present may play an important role during this transition under normal circumstances in the wild-type. Supporting the hypothesis that plus-end transport may be quite sensitive to BicD levels, we note that in phase II, minus-end motion in the t&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;1 and t&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;3 backgrounds is approximately the same (t-test, p&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;0.56; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003763-g003">Fig. 3A</xref>), but the small amount of additional BicD present in the t&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;1 embryos is enough to significantly improve Phase II plus-end motion above that found in the t&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;3 embryos (t-test, p&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;0.049; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003763-g003">Fig. 3B</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Droplet-bound BicD levels are temporally changing, and regulated</title><p>Since the t&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;1/t&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;3 experiments suggested that BicD levels may be important, we investigated whether droplet-bound BicD levels changed in conjunction with normal developmental changes in droplet motion.

To differentiate between these possibilities, we did temporally controlled collections, as described above with respect to droplet purifications. However, rather than purifying the droplets, we simply looked at overall embryonic levels of BicD. We found (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003763-g004">Fig. 4B</xref>) that embryonic BicD levels are relatively stable during this period, suggesting that the amount of droplet-bound BicD is somehow directly regulated.</p><p>Given the above t&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;1/t&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;3 results, and the observed changes in BicD levels, it seems likely that regulated changes in droplet-bound BicD levels could functionally contribute to the regulation of droplet transport and net directionality. Past studies reported that, when purposely attached to a cargo, an N-terminal fragment of mammalian BicD alone could recruit dynein to a given cargo <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003763-Hoogenraad2">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>. Therefore, one appealing scenario is that droplet-bound BicD tethers dynein to the cargo, and thus droplet-bound BicD levels directly control transport by determining the amount of cargo-bound dynein. Then, regulating droplet-bound BicD levels could be used to regulate droplet-bound dynein levels, and potentially dynein activity. To investigate this possibility, we examined the amount of dynein bound to the droplets using staged lipid droplet purifications. DIC is hard to detect in western blots, so we have significantly more variability than for many other proteins. Nonetheless, we do not generally detect an obvious change in droplet-bound dynein levels as a function of developmental stage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003763-g004">Fig. 4C</xref>), suggesting there are likely not dramatic changes in the amount of dynein bound to the droplets in different developmental phases (though these measurements are not sensitive enough to detect subtle changes). Additionally, wild-type minus-end run lengths are approximately constant between phase I, II, and III <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003763-Welte1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>, although they do increase briefly in the newly discovered phase IIb (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003763-g003">Fig. 3C</xref>). Also, minus-end stalling forces (which reflect the number of engaged motors) have been shown to be higher in phase II than in phase I <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003763-Welte1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>, although droplet-bound BicD is much lower in phase II than in phase I. Since the drastic fall in droplet BicD levels does not clearly coincide with altered minus-end run lengths in wild-type, or in reduced minus-end stalling forces, it seems unlikely that in phases I through III the majority of BicD would be playing an important role in tethering dynein to the cargos.</p><p>To test the idea that BicD may not be absolutely essential for minus-end motility, we compared droplet motion in low (t&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;1) and &#x0223c;null (t&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;3) BicD expression backgrounds. We observed minus-end motion that was statistically similar in the low and extremely low BicD backgrounds, despite the approximate six-fold difference in BicD expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003763-g001">Fig. 1E</xref>). This suggests that by the time we reach t&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;3 BicD levels, we are observing minus-end directed transport on droplets that are functionally null for BicD, consistent with the idea that BicD may not be absolutely required for droplet motion. However, if BicD is important for initial recruitment of dynein, we might expect that the percentage of droplets moving to be decreased. Our automated analysis found that, in phase II, the number of moving droplets per frame was essentially the same between the t&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;1 and t&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;3 backgrounds, but quite reduced relative to the wild-type case (see below). These observations are consistent with a model that there is a basal amount of dynein that makes it to the droplets in a BicD-independent fashion, but that some of the droplet dynein initially is recruited via BicD (during embryogenesis), and that only droplets with dynein are able to transport themselves into the forming embryo. However, other interpretations are also possible (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s3">discussion</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>Mutant analysis to gain insight into BicD's functions</title><p>Given the sudden BicD-dependent change in motion from phase II to IIB, it is possible that BicD has two roles&#x02014;an initial structural one, possibly recruiting dynein as previously discussed by others, and a latter dynamic regulatory role, once the dynein is recruited. To further investigate this idea, and identify possibly separable functions of BicD, we undertook a structure-function study of a number of BicD mutants. We used a genetic strategy, wherein we evaluated whether specific mutations in BicD affected functions important for lipid droplet motion. Experimentally, our goal was to determine which alleles were capable of rescuing an expected reclouding defect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003763-g005">Fig. 5B</xref>) in embryos from female flies expressing very low levels of BicD.

A deletion of the second heptad repeat, from the N-terminus, rescued as well (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003763-g005">Fig. 5D</xref>). A deletion of the third heptad repeat rescued, albeit perhaps not fully (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003763-g005">Fig. 5E</xref>).

Equivalent amounts of total embryo lysate were loaded per lane for each independent comparison (B&#x02013;D). E: In phase II, BicD<sup>PA66</sup> analysis identified a total number of droplets per frame intermediate between the wild-type and the null (&#x02018;t&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;1&#x02019;, &#x02018;t&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;3,4&#x02019;) values.

However, this is unlikely here because BicD<sup>PA66</sup> and BicD<sup>null</sup> (t&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;3) embryos have nearly identical tracking phenotypes in phase II (t-test, p&#x0003e;0.75 for both directions; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003763-g006">Fig. 6H, I</xref>), and confocal images of phase II microtubules in BicD<sup>null</sup> (t&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;3) embryos generally appeared fine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003763-g002">Fig. 2E</xref>). Additionally, the short run lengths in BicD<sup>PA66</sup> phase II embryos transition to long wild-type run lengths of phase IIb within &#x0223c;4 minutes, which would imply a rapidly repaired microtubule array, which seems unlikely. Overall, it seems unlikely that the short run lengths in phase II of BicD<sup>PA66</sup> and the t&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;3 null are attributable to microtubule defects.</p><p>A third possibility is that the failure of the BicD<sup>PA66</sup> allele to rescue motion reflects the impaired localization of BicD<sup>PA66</sup> to the droplet, due to the PA66 point mutation. To investigate this possibility, we considered a number of lines of evidence. First, others' structural studies have suggested that BicD typically attaches to cargos via its C-terminal domain, but our sequencing analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003763-g006">Fig. 6A</xref>) indicated that the location of the point mutation is indeed as expected, in BicD's very N-terminal domain, far from the C-terminal cargo-attachment region. Further, the analysis found no additional mutations (e.g.in the C-terminal portion of the protein) that could account for altered localization. Second, early in development (before phase II, when we analyze motion), BicD may recruit some portion of the Dynein to the droplets. This hypothesis is consistent with past reports, and also with the observation that in phases II and IIb, the number of moving droplets in BicD<sup>null</sup> (t&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;3, 4) was decreased by approximately 10&#x000d7; as compared to wild-type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003763-g006">Fig. 6F</xref>). With this in mind, we looked at the number of droplets moving in the PA66 background, and while it was less than in wild-type, it was roughly 3&#x000d7; to 4&#x000d7; more than in the null (t&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;3, 4) background (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003763-g006">Fig. 6F</xref>). Since the presence of BicD with the PA66 mutation resulted in significantly more moving droplets than for the BicD<sup>null</sup>, it suggests that the PA66 form of the protein still has a reasonable ability to recruit dynein to the droplets, consistent with the hypothesis that BicD<sup>PA66</sup> is indeed able to localize to the droplets (at least early in development). Unfortunately, because they are quite few in number, we cannot use biochemistry (e.g. droplet purifications) on the BicD<sup>PA66</sup> embryos to confirm that the BicD<sup>PA66</sup> protein localizes to the droplets. Further, immunolocalization studies were inconclusive because BicD serves many roles, so we observe punctae both close-to and away from the droplets in both wild-type and BicD<sup>PA66</sup> mutant embryos (not shown). However, from a functional point of view, tracking analysis indicates that droplet motion (and hence BicD<sup>PA66</sup> function) in Phase IIb is similar to wild type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003763-g006">Fig. 6H, I</xref>). This suggests that, at least in phase IIb, BicD is still physically present on the droplet. Similarly, motion continues to be good in phase III BicD<sup>PA66</sup> embryos. In phase III, BicD<sup>PA66</sup> run lengths of both plus and minus direction are noticeably <italic>longer</italic> than wild type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003763-g006">Fig. 6H, I</xref>). Combined, these observations suggest that BicD's ability to possibly initially recruit dynein to the cargo is separate from its latter ability to regulate or alter transport. Rather than suggesting that the A40V mutation of BicD<sup>PA66</sup> simply alters its localization, the data is consistent with the hypothesis that this mutation leaves BicD's initial ability to recruit Dynein partially intact, but alters BicD's function by somehow changing its ability to later regulate motion. Such a hypothesis would be consistent with the point mutation being localized in a portion of the protein previously reported to interact with dynein <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003763-Hoogenraad2">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Discussion</title><p>Past studies have found numerous roles for BicD in contributing to distinct dynein-mediated processes, but the exact mechanism through which BicD contributes to appropriate minus-end transport is not yet well established. However, evidence in a number of systems suggests that BicD may be able to play a role in recruiting dynein to the cargos. These past studies are important, but rely heavily on over-expression studies, and/or expression of truncated forms of the protein, and so leave open the question of whether BicD levels or activity are changed as part of the usual regulatory process. In addition, even accepting that BicD is important as a dynein recruiter, there has been open the question of whether BicD plays any continuing regulatory roles, distinct from making sure that the transport complex is appropriately set up.

However, some dynein recruitment is BicD-independent, because the same number of droplets make it into the embryo in the t&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;1 and t&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;3 embryos (and approximately the same number of droplets are moving in these two backgrounds) as determined from tracking analysis, in spite of the 6&#x000d7; difference in BicD levels, and the fact that in the t&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;3 embryos BicD levels have been reduced &#x0223c;375&#x000d7; relative to the wildtype, so it seems unlikely that there is still enough BicD remaining to be functional. This finding is consistent with past work investigating BicD's role in mRNA transport, which also concluded that BicD was not absolutely essential to recruit dynein <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003763-Bullock2">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>. Although our favored interpretation is that BicD plays a role in dynein recruitment, past work <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003763-Mach1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003763-Suter2">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref> suggested that in ovaries of BicD-mutant mothers, the microtubule cytoskeleton can be impaired, resulting in improper transport of components into the developing embryos. Such disorganization could contribute as well to the apparent decrease in droplets present in the BicD-mutant embryos. Overall, although there are fewer droplets apparently present in the mutant embryos, the percentage of droplets present that actually move is approximately the same for all the genotypes, at &#x0223c;10&#x00025;. We also note that there remains the possibility that some of the apparent decrease in embryonic droplets reflects increased basal droplet localization, to a central area of the embryo where droplet quantitation is difficult.</p><p>Nonetheless, numerous lines of evidence suggest that either a rather small portion of the available BicD tethers the dynein, or that whatever role BicD plays in dynein recruitment occurs in a temporally limited fashion. Loss of almost all the droplet-bound BicD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003763-g004">Fig. 4A</xref>) due to normal developmental regulation does not result in any loss of dynein from the droplets, as judged either by western blot, or stalling forces (we've shown previously<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003763-Mallik1">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003763-Shubeita1">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref> that stalling force is roughly proportional to the number of engaged motors), or mean minus-end travel distances. A limited duration for BicD to help assemble the motor complexes is consistent with previous mRNA studies that suggest that the nature of the complexes moving the mRNA particles is sensitive to BicD levels when the complexes are formed, but not afterward <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003763-Bullock2">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="s3b"><title>BicD contributes to dynamic regulation of droplet motion</title><p>We find that approximately the same number of droplets are moving in both of the very low-BicD backgrounds (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003763-g006">Fig. 6F</xref>), although western blotting of embryos shows that there is &#x0223c;6&#x000d7; more BicD in the t&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;1 background relative to the t&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;3 background. This suggests that at such low levels of BicD, BicD can no longer play a significant role in recruiting dynein to the droplets (if it could, one would expect many more moving droplets in the t&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;1 embryos). Thus, we hypothesize that there is a BicD-independent pathway for some dynein to get on to the droplets. Assuming that this hypothesis is true, i.e. that the levels of BicD present in both the t&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;1 and t&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;3 embryos are indeed too low to facilitate dynein recruitment, the observation that motion is altered between the two suggests that BicD likely has an additional regulatory role, independent of simple dynein recruitment, and that this regulatory role is affected by the amount of BicD present on the cargo. The existence of this dynamic regulatory role is further confirmed by the interesting phenotype of motion in the PA66 background, where the mutant form of the protein allows a dramatic change in droplet motion between phase II and IIb, but the subsequent down-regulation of transport expected between phase IIB and III fails to occur. A model for how the point mutation affects BicD's regulatory role is described below.</p></sec><sec id="s3c"><title>BicD plays a role in kinesin-mediated travel</title><p>In addition to the evidence presented above supporting roles for regulation of minus-end transport, our data shows that loss of BicD function leads to altered plus-end motion, suggesting a new role for BicD: regulating plus-end transport. Our past studies suggest a strong coupling between plus-end and minus-end motion, so one question is whether the observed effects are indirect, and reflect a primary role in minus-end transport, with the altered minus-end transport resulting in plus-end transport. While we cannot be certain, we believe it is more likely that BicD plays a role in direct regulation of plus-end transport. First, recent work found that the middle portion of BicD interacts with kinesin via 2-hybrid <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003763-Grigoriev1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>. When published, the functional significance of the interaction was unknown, but our data supports the hypothesis that it may be important. Our recent work<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003763-Shubeita1">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref>establishes that plus-end droplet motion is driven by kinesin-1, so it is unlikely that the effects of BicD on plus-end motion are simply due to its effects on dynein, although recent work suggests that this may be the case for some mRNA transport<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003763-Vendra1">&#x0005b;25&#x0005d;</xref>. Second, the large phase IIb run length peak is absent in the t&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;3 null, consistent with the hypothesis that BicD can acutely up-regulate both directions of transport. Third, we noted above that plus-end transport appears to have higher dosage sensitivity than minus-end transport to BicD levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003763-g003">Fig. 3A, B</xref>).</p><p>Regardless of the exact mechanism, our studies show that BicD plays an important role in regulating the relative contribution of plus-end versus minus-end motion. Although run lengths are very long in phase III of the PA66 background, a reversal of the net direction of transport is not observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003763-g006">Fig. 6J</xref>). Thus, the mutant analysis indicates that BicD's role in balancing plus-end versus minus-end motion is functionally separable from its role in facilitating overall upregulation of transport, with the resulting long runs in each direction in Phase IIB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003763-g006">Fig. 6H, I</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3d"><title>A model for BicD function, incorporating findings from the PA66 point mutation</title><p>BicD<sup>PA66</sup> is interesting in that the altered protein maintains the ability to up-regulate the high phase IIb run lengths, yet cannot regulate net directionality. If phase IIb run length up-regulation requires BicD, why are run lengths in phase II of the BicD<sup>PA66</sup> background similar to the t&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;3 null? In principle, BicD could be absent from the droplets in phase II and then rapidly accumulate at the onset of phase IIb, but this seems unlikely given that such a recruitment of BicD to the droplets in Phase IIB would go counter to the continued drop in droplet-bound BicD levels which usually occur during development.</p><p>Instead, we hypothesize that during normal wild-type development, BicD's motor regulatory functions can be auto-inhibited by an intramolecular BicD-BicD interaction, but that the PA66 point mutation has altered this interaction. Our model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003763-g007">Fig. 7</xref>) is as follows. First, we hypothesize that BicD can move between two main conformations, a &#x02018;closed&#x02019; conformation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003763-g007">Fig. 7a, left</xref>) and an &#x02018;open&#x02019; conformation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003763-g007">Fig 7a, right</xref>). Such a range of conformations is consistent with past EM studies visualizing BicD <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003763-Stuurman1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref> (however, we do not attempt to differentiate between the possibility that intermediate states could reflect either the modulation of time spent in the completely-open vs completely-closed states, or the possibility that an intermediate conformation could be adopted for a given period of time). Secondly, it has been previously suggested <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003763-Hoogenraad1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003763-Hoogenraad2">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref> that BicD may be capable of self-inactivation by positioning its N- and C-terminal ends near one another. In our case, we propose that when BicD is in its &#x02018;closed&#x02019; state, it cannot regulate/activate either the plus-end or minus-end motors, but that it is maximally able to activate such motors when in an entirely &#x02018;open&#x02019; state. This hypothesis builds on previous observations that fragments of BicD can interact with dynein <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003763-Matanis1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003763-Hoogenraad1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003763-Fumoto1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref> and kinesin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003763-Grigoriev1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>, but that this ability can be absent or minimized in the full-length protein. The functional relevance of such conformational changes are consistent with the observation that while the N-terminus is generally considered the dynein recruiting fragment, there are also dynamitin (dynactin) and dynein intermediate chain (D.I.C.) interacting regions of BicD at the C-terminal portion of BicD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003763-g001">Fig 1B</xref>).</p><fig id="pone-0003763-g007" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0003763.g007</object-id><label>Figure 7</label><caption><title>A proposed model for the proper regulation of BicD and the effect of the PA66 lesion.</title><p>A: Past studies have indicated that BicD has a flexible linker region between its two globular domains (Stuurman <italic>et al.</italic>, 1999) and that an intramolecular interaction of the N- and C-terminal domains might represent a closed/inactive state (A, left) that can open to interact (A, right) with other regulatory components (Hoogenraad <italic>et al.</italic>, 2001). B: Wild-type BicD may regulate its active state by either controlling how frequently it alternates between a completely open/active vs. a completely closed/inactive state or through an ability to take an intermediate conformation. Therefore, intermediate conformations shown for wild-type (B left, B right) are simply intended to suggest that BicD molecules are not locked in one state or the other. Yet, the open stature of BicD shown for phase IIb of wild-type (B, middle) is intended to suggest a relatively open/active state. C: The A40V lesion of BicD<sup>PA66</sup> could affect N- to C-terminal interaction within BicD. BicD<sup>PA66</sup> tracking results could suggest that there is an abrupt change from a closed to an open state sometime near phase IIb, followed by a clear inability down-regulate the open/active state once it has occurred, as seen in phase III (C).</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="pone.0003763.g007"/></fig><p>From our data studying the PA66 mutation, we further hypothesize that the BicD-BicD inhibitory interaction is itself actively regulated during development, and the PA66 mutation alters the regulation of the interaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003763-g007">Fig 7C</xref>). Our model is that during wild type development, with normal BicD function, run-lengths are in part controlled by the amount of time BicD spends in the &#x02018;open&#x02019; configuration&#x02013;or alternatively, how &#x02018;open&#x02019; it is (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003763-g007">Fig. 7B</xref>). Thus, the extremely long runs in phase IIB would reflect BicD being completely &#x02018;open&#x02019;, and both phase II and phase III would reflect slightly more closed forms of BicD&#x02013;or alternatively, BicD spending more time in a &#x02018;closed&#x02019; configuration. Implicit in this model is the hypothesis that plus-end motion is more sensitive to exact BicD levels than minus-end motion: in phase II and III there is a basal level of BicD activity sufficient to achieve a fixed level of minus-end transport, but to really up-regulate minus-end transport requires the &#x02018;completely open&#x02019; conformation found in IIB. In contrast, the moderately higher level of BicD activity in phase II relative to phase III (perhaps due to higher overall levels of the protein present on the droplet) is enough to increase plus-end motion. Such a sensitivity of plus-end motion to exact BicD levels/activity is consistent with the larger response of plus-end motion to the slightly increased BicD levels in t&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;1 vs t&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;3 embryos (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003763-g003">Fig. 3A, B</xref>).</p><p>Interpreting the phenotype of BicD<sup>PA66</sup> within this general framework suggests that the point mutation affects the regulation of the closed versus open states of BicD, but requires that whatever role BicD has in the initial recruitment of dynein (if any) is not severely altered by the mutation (since there are more moving droplets in the BicD<sup>PA66</sup> embryos than in the t&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;1 or t&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;3 embryos). We hypothesize that in contrast to normal Phase II BicD which spends some time partly open, phase II BicD<sup>PA66</sup> is unable to respond to regulatory signals that keep it partly open. It would therefore be locked completely in the &#x02018;closed&#x02019; state, and be unable to properly activate the motors. It thus acts as a &#x02018;null&#x02019; mutant in phase II (i.e. the tracking phenotype is the same as for the t&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;3 background). Then, for phase IIb, the mutant protein responds appropriately to a second regulatory event, that induces maximal opening of BicD in phase IIb. Consequently, the null phenotype disappears, and phase IIb motion is excellent; there is the suggestion that runs may be even longer than wild-type in the PA66 background. Finally, just as the mutant was unable to respond to whatever signal was present in phase II (to keep it partly open), in phase III it is unable to respond to the signal to partly close up, and remains fully open. Functionally, this causes BicD<sup>PA66</sup> phase III run lengths to be quite similar to those of phase IIB, i.e. the expected significant decrease in phase III run lengths fails to occur. In conclusion, we believe that the BicD N-terminus/C-terminus interaction is regulated to control the amount that BicD increases plus-end and minus-end transport, and that this regulation is altered by the A40V mutation.</p><p>Our data shows that BicD function is essential for the ability to regulate bi-directional lipid droplet motion. BicD activity alters both plus-end and minus-end transport, and can play a role in balancing the relative contributions of each to allow regulated net transport. More than simply a physical attachment between dynein and the cargo, BicD plays interesting roles in regulating motion. It is interesting to speculate that BicD could do this by altering or facilitating the interaction of dynactin with dynein and possibly kinesin.
