We have isolated specific cDNA clones of the two complementary keratin subunits from a cDNA library constructed with polyA+RNA of mouse tongue epithelium and present the complete nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequences of the 57kd protein and about 75% of the corresponding data of the 47kd protein. The comparison of the sequence data with those of known epidermal keratin mRNAs coding for the two types of keratin proteins reveals a fundamentally identical and type-specific organization of the mRNAs into both highly conserved and variable domains. In order to avoid cross-reactions with other members of the keratin multigene family, appropriately taylored 35S-labeled cDNA probes comprising the low and non-homologous 3' coding and noncoding domains of the mRNAs were used for in situ hybridization to tissue sections. The localization and distribution of the corresponding transcripts indicates a strongly compartmentalized keratin expression in mouse tongue epithelium.</p><sec><title>Images</title><fig id="F1"><graphic xlink:href="nar00271-0139-a" xlink:role="754"/></fig><fig id="F2"><graphic xlink:href="nar00271-0145-a" xlink:role="760"/></fig></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><supplementary-material content-type="scanned-pages"><graphic xlink:href="nar00271-0136.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="751"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00271-0137.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="752"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00271-0138.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="753"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00271-0139.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="754"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00271-0140.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="755"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00271-0141.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="756"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00271-0142.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="757"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00271-0143.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="758"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00271-0144.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="759"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00271-0145.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="760"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00271-0146.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="761"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00271-0147.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="762"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00271-0148.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="763"/></supplementary-material></body></article>
