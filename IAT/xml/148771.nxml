The diploid was sporulated and the top3 :: kan (R)spores went through four to eight cell divisions before arresting as elongated, predominantly binucleated cells with incompletely segregated chromosomes. This demonstrates that top3 (+)is essential for vegetative growth in fission yeast. The aberrant chromosomal segregation seen in top3 :: kan (R)cells is unlike the 'cut' phenotype seen in mitosis-defective mutants and so we refer to this phenotype as 'torn'. A deletion mutant, rad12-hd ( rad12 is a homolog of Saccharomyces cerevisiae SGS1), partially suppressed the lethality of top3 mutants. A point mutant, rad12-K547I, which presumably eliminates helicase activity, also suppresses the lethality of top3 mutants, demonstrating that the lethality seen in top3 (-)cells is most likely caused by the helicase activity of Rad12. This double mutant grows very slowly and has much lower viability compared to rad12-hd top3 :: kan (R)cells, implying that the helicase activity of Rad12 is not the only cause of top3 (-)lethality. The low viability of rad12 (-) top3 (-)mutants compared with rad12 single mutants suggests that Top3 also functions independently of Rad12.</p></abstract></article-meta></front></article>
