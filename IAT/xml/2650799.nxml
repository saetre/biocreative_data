The molecular mechanisms behind these cancer-related changes in DNA methylation patterns are not well understood. Two questions are particularly important: (i) how are CpG islands protected from methylation in normal cells, and how is this protection compromised in cancer cells, and (ii) how does the genome-wide demethylation in cancer cells occur. The latter question is especially intriguing since so far no DNA demethylase enzyme has been found.</p></sec><sec><title>Methodology/Principal Findings</title><p>Our data show that the absence of ADP-ribose polymers (PARs), caused by ectopic over-expression of poly(ADP-ribose) glycohydrolase (PARG) in L929 mouse fibroblast cells leads to aberrant methylation of the CpG island in the promoter of the <italic>Dnmt1</italic> gene, which in turn shuts down its transcription. The transcriptional silencing of <italic>Dnmt1</italic> may be responsible for the widespread passive hypomethylation of genomic DNA which we detect on the example of pericentromeric repeat sequences. Chromatin immunoprecipitation results show that in normal cells the <italic>Dnmt1</italic> promoter is occupied by poly(ADP-ribosyl)ated Parp1, suggesting that PARylated Parp1 plays a role in protecting the promoter from methylation.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions/Significance</title><p>In conclusion, the genome methylation pattern following PARG over-expression mirrors the pattern characteristic of cancer cells, supporting our idea that the right balance between Parp/Parg activities maintains the DNA methylation patterns in normal cells. The finding that in normal cells Parp1 and ADP-ribose polymers localize on the <italic>Dnmt1</italic> promoter raises the possibility that PARylated Parp1 marks those sequences in the genome that must remain unmethylated and protects them from methylation, thus playing a role in the epigenetic regulation of gene expression.</p></sec></abstract><counts><page-count count="10"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>5-methylcytosine is considered to be the fifth base of DNA as &#x02013; through its non-random distribution along the genome &#x02013; it constitutes part of the epigenetic chromatin modifications that control gene expression patterns. The genome methylation pattern is bimodal: the methylated cytosines are scattered throughout the genome, whereas the unmethylated residues are mainly located within particular regions termed CpG islands (CGIs) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004717-Bird1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004717-Takai1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>.

Although their sequence is enriched in CpG dinucleotides, the best substrates for DNA methyltransferase activity, the CGIs are mainly unmethylated and the associated genes are actively transcribed; transcription is inhibited when these regions undergo methylation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004717-Esteller1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004717-Szyf1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>In cancer cells, there are drastic changes in the DNA methylation patterns: the housekeeping gene promoters become hypermethylated, whereas the genome as a whole undergoes significant hypomethylation events.

A series of different experimental strategies suggests that blockage of poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation, due to competitive inhibition of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerases (PARPs), induces <italic>in vivo</italic> DNA hypermethylation, both on genomic DNA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004717-deCapoa1">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004717-Zardo2">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref> and on particular CGI regions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004717-Zardo3">&#x0005b;25&#x0005d;</xref>.

We have suggested a mechanism in which Parp1 in its automodified (PARylated) form or PARs themselves make Dnmt1 catalytically inactive and, thus, inefficient in DNA methylation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004717-Reale1">&#x0005b;27&#x0005d;</xref>. In this model, modified Parp1, through the high negative charge of bound PARs attracts and hosts Dnmt1, thus preventing its catalytic activity. In fact, we found that Dnmt1 possesses two presumptive PAR-binding domains and shows higher affinity for free polymers than for DNA. Co-immunoprecipitation data indicated that Dnmt1 and Parp1 associate <italic>in vivo</italic> and that the Parp1 present in the complex is in its PARylated form <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004717-Reale1">&#x0005b;27&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>We hypothesize that the right nuclear balance between unmodified and PARylated forms of Parp1 &#x02013; which depends on the correct dynamics of Parp/Parg activities &#x02013; determines the maintenance of DNA methylation patterns <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004717-Caiafa2">&#x0005b;28&#x0005d;</xref>. According to our data, decreased or increased levels of PARylated Parp1 are responsible for diffuse hypermethylation or hypomethylation of DNA, respectively. In the absence of PARylated Parp1, Dnmt1 is free to methylate DNA; conversely, under conditions of persistently high levels of PARylated Parp1, the stable inhibition of Dnmt1 would prevent its methylation-maintenance activity at replicative forks, thus leading to passive DNA hypomethylation of the genome.</p><p>These findings underscore the importance of a rapid reversal of Parp1 automodification since it affects the epigenetic information. They also suggest that the introduction of new methyl groups onto CGIs of housekeeping genes and/or the diffuse genome hypomethylation in cancer cells could also occur through deregulation of Parp or Parg activities.</p><p>In this work, the non-specific effects of inhibitors of Parp activity were excluded by using ectopic over-expression of PARG to deplete cells of PARs. We show that following over-expression of PARG: i) <italic>Dnmt1</italic> expression is down-regulated; ii) the CGI in the promoter of <italic>Dnmt1</italic> loses its protection against methylation and becomes methylated; iii) in normal cells, Parp1 and PARs locate on the <italic>Dnmt1</italic> minimal promoter; iv) the silencing of the <italic>Dnmt1</italic> gene is accompanied by diffuse demethylation of the genome, including the pericentromeric repeat sequences which are methylated in normal cells. These findings suggest that Parp1 occupies the <italic>Dnmt1</italic> promoter and protects its unmethylated state through its automodification activity, i.e. its ability to build poly(ADP-ribose) chains onto itself.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Myc-PARG localizes in the nucleus of transfected L929 mouse fibroblasts and degrades endogenous PARs</title><p>The complete coding region for human PARG was cloned into the Myc-tag expression vector pCS2-MT and the expression of the Myc-PARG protein was evaluated in transfection assays in the mouse fibroblast cell line L929.</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004717-g001">Figure 1A</xref> shows a predominant nuclear localization of Myc-PARG at 48 hours of transient transfection, as evaluated by immunofluorescence analysis.

We have earlier shown that PARs - either protein free or bound to PARylated Parp1 - compete with DNA for binding to Dnmt1; when the enzyme is hosted on the polymers, it can no longer perform its catalytic function on DNA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004717-Reale1">&#x0005b;27&#x0005d;</xref>. Here, we suggest that the CGI in the promoter of <italic>Dnmt1</italic> is protected from methylation by PARylated Parp1 or a PARylated transcriptional factor which attracts Dnmt1 and inhibits its activity. By chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments using anti-PAR and anti-Parp1 antibodies, we showed that the <italic>Dnmt1</italic> promoter region that was methylated following PARG over-expression, contained both Parp1 and PARs in control (non-over-expressing) cells. We can conclude that in normal cells PARylated Parp1 (or a PARylated transcription factor) occupies the <italic>Dnmt1</italic> promoter, maintaining this region unmethylated.</p><p>To establish whether PARylated Parp1 by itself can regulate the promoter region of <italic>Dnmt1</italic> gene, we focused our attention on the transcriptional factor Ctcf. We excluded the involvement of Ctcf in this mechanism as: (i) the <italic>Dnmt1</italic> promoter could not be chromatin immunoprecipitated with anti-Ctcf antibody, and (ii) decreased levels of Ctcf did not affect the level of Dnmt1. We cannot exclude that Parp1 is recruited to the <italic>Dnmt1</italic> promoter by other transcription factors. The predictive Transfac search for transcription factor binding sites within the promoter region amplified by D1 and D2 primers revealed multiple putative binding sites for transcription factors, some of which are known to interact with Parp1. In particular, the promoter region from &#x02212;31 bp to &#x02212;64 bp from the first codon, which is specifically amplified by D1 primers, contains predicted binding sites for p300, SRY, and E2F transcription factors, recognized Parp1 partners <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004717-Hassa1">&#x0005b;42&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004717-SimbulanRosenthal1">&#x0005b;44&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>In the absence of PARs, the molecular mechanism that protects the unmethylated state of the <italic>Dnmt1</italic> promoter is lost, with consequent introduction of new methyl groups onto the promoter CpGs, and silencing of the gene.

The changes in the DNA methylation patterns caused by over-expressing PARG, i.e. by persistently low levels of polymers, mimic the epigenetic changes that occur in cancer, where there is hypermethylation of the CGI promoter regions of tumor suppressor genes and widespread genomic DNA hypomethylation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004717-Jones1">&#x0005b;45&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Experiments with PARG over-expression reveal an additional mechanism responsible for the widespread genomic hypomethylation in cancer cells.

The new mechanism, on the other hand, functions under conditions of polymer levels <italic>too low</italic> to inhibit Dnmt1 activity; in these conditions, new methyl groups are inserted onto the <italic>Dnmt1</italic> promoter, which leads to down-regulation of the gene. Thus, poly(ADP) ribose levels that are either too high or too low lead to the same outcome in terms of the global methylation status of the genome: they both cause widespread genome hypomethylation. These results underscore once again the critical importance of keeping balanced polymer levels, as we have recently argued <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004717-Caiafa2">&#x0005b;28&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Recently, Parp has been implicated in multiple pathways that regulate gene expression, including effects on chromatin structure <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004717-Krishnakumar1">&#x0005b;46&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004717-Rouleau1">&#x0005b;47&#x0005d;</xref> and transcriptional activator and coactivator functions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004717-Kraus1">&#x0005b;48&#x0005d;</xref>.
