The main functional hallmark of these NK-ireg cells is represented by the surface expression/release of HLA-G, a major immunosuppressive molecule. In addition, NK-ireg cells secrete two powerful immuno-regulatory factors: IL-10 and IL-21. Through these factors, NK-ireg cells act as effectors of the down-regulation of the immune response: reconverting mature myeloid DC (mDC) into immature/tolerogenic DC, blocking cytolytic functions on conventional NK cells and inducing HLA-G membrane expression on PB-derived monocytes. The generation of &#x0201c;NK-ireg&#x0201d; cells is obtained, by default, in culture conditions favouring cell-to-cell contacts, and it is strictly dependent on reciprocal trans-presentation of membrane-bound IL-15 forms constitutively and selectively expressed by human CD34<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> PB-HP. Finally, a small subset of NKp46<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> HLA-G<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> IL-10<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> is detected within freshly isolated decidual NK cells, suggesting that these cells could represent an <italic>in vivo</italic> counterpart of the NK-ireg cells.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions/Significance</title><p>In conclusion, NK-ireg cells represent a novel truly differentiated non-cytolytic NK subset with a self-sustainable phenotype (CD56<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> CD16<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> NKp30<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> NKp44<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> NKp46<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> CD94<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> CD69<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> CCR7<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>) generated from specific pSTAT6<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> GATA3<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> precursors. NK-ireg cells could be employed to develop new immuno-suppressive strategies in autoimmune diseases, transplant rejection or graft versus host diseases.

The acquisition of the NKp46 receptor, the most reliable marker for NK cell identification <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002241-Sivori1">&#x0005b;45&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002241-Walzer1">&#x0005b;46&#x0005d;</xref>, indicates that these cells are truly differentiated NK cells with the potential to migrate to secondary lymphoid compartments as suggested by the expression of CCR7 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002241-Marcenaro1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Notably, they displayed a peculiar characteristic represented by the nuclear localization of the Th2 transcription factors pSTAT6 and GATA3 (NKP<sub>SG</sub> cells) and by the production of the Th2 cytokines IL-4 and IL-5. The activation of the Th2 transcription factors and the production of IL-4 and IL-5 seem to be directly controlled by the mb-IL-15, as shown by their inhibition obtained incubating PB-NKP with the soluble IL-15R&#x003b1; chain. The soluble ligand likely acts through an agonistic stimulation of mb-IL-15 activating a reverse signaling mechanism, even though we cannot exclude that the soluble IL-15R&#x003b1; may simply behave as an antagonist interfering on the mb-IL-15 mediated <italic>trans-</italic>presentation process.</p><p>Interestingly, these NKP<sub>SG</sub> cells did not display cytolytic functions neither against K562 cells nor after mAb-mediated triggering of CD16 and NCR receptors. We further investigated their potential to interact with DC. Various evidences of the reciprocal interactions between NK and DC have been accumulated in recent years. The potent cross-talk between these cells may lead to NK cell activation, DC activation or apoptosis, depending on the activation status of the cells, with important functional consequences on both innate and adaptive immune responses <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002241-Zitvogel1">&#x0005b;30&#x0005d;</xref>. Our results highlight new outcomes of NK-DC cross-talk suggesting that NKP<sub>SG</sub> cells could act as a specialized subset able to negatively shape DC maturation inducing the generation of immature/tolerogenic myeloid DC. Indeed, NKP<sub>SG</sub> cells and/or their conditioned supernatants rapidly induced in mDC the down-regulation of HLA-DR, CD25, CD83, the co-stimulatory molecules CD80 and CD86. In addition, they lost the ability to produce IL-12 and to induce naive T cell proliferation. Finally, we observed the induction of important functional markers associated to the tolerogenic function such as the nuclear localization of pSTAT3 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002241-Barton1">&#x0005b;33&#x0005d;</xref> and the expression of membrane-bound TGF-&#x003b2; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002241-Ghiringhelli1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002241-Yang1">&#x0005b;47&#x0005d;</xref> as well as a reversion to an immature DC morphology. These data strongly support the concept that NKP<sub>SG</sub> cells may display powerful regulatory properties causing the conversion of mDC into immature/tolerogenic APC. Indeed, whether DC are stimulatory or tolerogenic apparently rests with whether or not the DC express activated STAT3 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002241-Barton1">&#x0005b;33&#x0005d;</xref>. On the other hand, expression of membrane-bound TGF-&#x003b2; on DC or Treg is responsible for the inhibition of effector functions of T and NK cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002241-Gandhi1">&#x0005b;48&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002241-Ostroukhova1">&#x0005b;49&#x0005d;</xref>. In this context, it is interesting to underline that the supernatant of NKP<sub>SG</sub> cells induces the membrane expression of HLA-G on human PB-derived monocytes that among circulatory mononuclear cells appear to be the predominant physiological source of these immunosuppressive molecules <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002241-LeMaoult2">&#x0005b;37&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002241-Rebmann1">&#x0005b;50&#x0005d;</xref>. Thus, the induction of HLA-G expression on monocytes by NKP<sub>SG</sub> cell supernatants strengthens the potential role of this NK subset in down-regulation of the immune response. On the other hand, NKP<sub>SG</sub> cells exhibited other important regulatory functions as they could inhibit the acquisition of cytotoxicity-associated functions (CD107a surface expression and IFN-&#x003b3; production) in NK cells activated by cross-linking of NCR molecules. Since the supernatant of NKP<sub>SG</sub> cells at different times of their maturation process (2 and 3 weeks-old cultures) could, at least in part, exert the same regulatory effects, we searched for the secretion of tolerogenic factors. In agreements with the expression of Th2 transcription factors, pSTAT6 and GATA3, we showed that NKP<sub>SG</sub> cells produced IL-10 and IL-21. The ability of NK cells to secrete constitutively IL-10 has been recently reported in freshly isolated NK cells from HCV patients but not from healthy donors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002241-DeMaria1">&#x0005b;51&#x0005d;</xref>. Remarkably, the concentrations of IL-10 detected in the supernatants of NKP<sub>SG</sub> cells are in the range of those secreted by activated NK cells from HCV patients <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002241-DeMaria1">&#x0005b;51&#x0005d;</xref>. Therefore IL-10 secretion by NK-ireg cells is biologically relevant, as shown by the fact that its inhibition with specific neutralizing mAbs efficiently decreases the induction of HLA-G on monocytes. On the other hand, the detection on NKP<sub>SG</sub> cells of IL-10 in a membrane-associated form strongly recalls an identical property in human monocytes and could be a new hallmark of the capacity described in human activated NK cells to act as APC <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002241-Spits1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>. In contrast, it was not known that human NK cells can secrete IL-21. Indeed, IL-21 production is considered to be restricted to different subsets of human CD4 Th cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002241-ParrishNovak1">&#x0005b;52&#x0005d;</xref> and to BCG-activated murine NKT cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002241-Harada1">&#x0005b;53&#x0005d;</xref>. Both IL-10 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002241-Barton1">&#x0005b;33&#x0005d;</xref> and IL-21 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002241-Brandt1">&#x0005b;34&#x0005d;</xref> are known to alter DC differentiation, and could therefore interfere on the cross-talk between NK and DC and inhibit functional maturation of DC in efficient APC. Furthermore, IL-21 production could explain the rapid emergence of CD16<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> NKP, that was reported to occur only when IL-21 was added to IL-15 during <italic>in vitro</italic> NK cell maturation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002241-Sivori2">&#x0005b;54&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>IL-10 and IL-21 are likely involved in the tolerogenic property of NKP<sub>SG</sub> cells, but cannot be responsible for the NKP<sub>SG</sub> dependent inhibition of NK cell activation triggered by NCR cross-linking <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002241-Brady1">&#x0005b;35&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002241-Sivori2">&#x0005b;54&#x0005d;</xref>. However, our data show that NKP<sub>SG</sub> cells express at their surface and secrete HLA-G molecules that have been shown to display immuno-regulatory properties interfering with DC maturation and NK activation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002241-LeMaoult2">&#x0005b;37&#x0005d;</xref>. The surface expression and the secretion of HLA-G are restricted to a very limited number of normal tissues in which HLA-G molecules display important immuno-regulatory functions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002241-Hunt1">&#x0005b;55&#x0005d;</xref>. The unusual expression and secretion of HLA-G by NKP<sub>SG</sub> cells is demonstrated with four different approaches: WB, flow cytometry, confocal microscopy and biological assay using four different specific antibodies. The biological importance of HLA-G in the regulatory functions of NKP<sub>SG</sub> cells is shown through its neutralization with specific mAbs. Indeed, this treatment efficiently counteracts the inhibitory effect exerted by NKP<sub>SG</sub> cells on the surface expression of CD107a and IFN&#x003b3; induced by NCR cross-linking on conventional PB-derived NK cells. On the other hand, the combined neutralization of HLA-G with a neutralizing mAb and of IL-21 with the soluble receptor s-IL-21R efficiently counteracts the potential of NKP<sub>SG</sub> cells to induce immature myeloid DC, underlying the complementary tolerogenic properties of both factors.</p><p>In view of these properties, we propose the terminology &#x0201c;NK-ireg&#x0201d; to define this NKP<sub>SG</sub> cells even if they do not express the transcription factor Foxp3 and they cannot inhibit CD3 dependent T cell expansion (data not shown). We propose that NK-ireg cells exert their immuno-regulatory potential acting through the relay of accessory cells such as monocytes and mature myeloid DC that acquire tolerogenic/suppressive properties after contact with NK-ireg cells.</p><p>We cannot exclude that NK-ireg cells could be simply immature NK cells that have not reached a stage in which they can secrete lytic granules and IFN-&#x003b3;. Nevertheless, the fact that they cannot differentiate into conventional cytolytic NK cells following stimulation with IL-12, IL-15 and/or IL-18, associated to the secretion of immuno-regulatory factors (IL-21 and HLA-G) not yet detected in NK cells, and the expression of functional activation markers such as NCR NKp44 and CD69, would rather suggest that NK-ireg represent a novel truly differentiated NK subset with a self-sustainable phenotype generated from specific pSTAT6<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> GATA3<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> progenitors and a distinguishing surface expression of HLA-G molecules.</p><p>Recently, it has been reported the existence in the peripheral blood of a small subset of immature CD3<sup>&#x02212;</sup>CD161<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>CD56<sup>&#x02212;</sup> NK cells secreting Th2 cytokines (NK2) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002241-Loza1">&#x0005b;56&#x0005d;</xref>. However, comparison of this NK subset with NK-ireg cells reveals important differences that render unlikely any hypothesis of a kinship. Indeed in NK2 cells, the absence of CD56 expression seems to represent a characteristic associated to the final steps of their maturation, while NK-ireg cells acquire CD56 expression very early in their differentiation process. In addition, NK2 cells are very sensitive to the cytokine environment which rapidly activates their developmental progression towards the terminal differentiation. In contrast, NK-ireg cells and their progenitors are resistant to exogenous lymphokines and do not modify their phenotype and function. The existence of human NK cells displaying regulatory properties has been already hypothesized but not formally proven <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002241-Zhang1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>. In the present report, we describe the generation <italic>in vitro</italic> of non-cytolytic regulatory NK cells whose differentiation is triggered by a membrane-bound IL-15 constitutively expressed by PB-derived HP but not by BM-derived ones.</p><p>The physiological significance of the NK-ireg would be strengthened by the detection <italic>in vivo</italic> of NK cells displaying similar phenotypic and functional characteristics. Therefore, we focused our investigation to situations where has been reported the presence of NK cells that display regulatory functions and spontaneously secrete IL-10. In mouse and human, precursors of NK cell lineage home to decidualizing uteri where they undergo proliferation, terminal differentiation and then death. Decidual NK (d-NK) cells are a distinct, transient, tissue-specific NK cell subset that during pregnancy increase along the first trimester, then decline and are virtually absent in late pregnancy. The d-NK cells spontaneously secrete IL-10 and are thought to contribute to placental angiogenesis and to play a significant role in the allorecognition mechanisms during pregnancy regulating the maternal tolerance at the foetomaternal interface. Our data show that freshly isolated d-NK cells express a small subset (3&#x02013;4&#x00025;) of NKp46<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> HLA-G<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> CD56<sup>bright</sup> cells that could represent an <italic>in vivo</italic> counterpart of the NK-ireg that we have generated <italic>in vitro.</italic></p><p>Use of immunosupressive drugs for the prevention of allograft rejection is associated with heavy side effects and toxicity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002241-Leichtman1">&#x0005b;57&#x0005d;</xref>. In this context, the use of immuno-regulatory cells such as mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) is viewed as an interesting and promising alternative with decreased side effects <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002241-Pittenger1">&#x0005b;58&#x0005d;</xref>. Since the NK-ireg cells, that we generate <italic>in vitro</italic> from PB-HP, display immuno-regulatory properties similar to those reported in MSC <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002241-Jiang1">&#x0005b;59&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002241-Spaggiari1">&#x0005b;60&#x0005d;</xref>, we propose that this novel NK subset could constitute an additional autologous biotherapic tool to be used combined or in alternative to MSC. On the other hand, it must be stated that obtention and expansion of MSC requires bone marrow biopsies, while NK-ireg cells are derived from peripheral blood of the patient receiving an allograft.</p><p>In conclusion, the <italic>in vitro</italic> generation and expansion of NK-ireg cells could offer interesting perspectives for the development of new immuno-suppressive strategies in autoimmune diseases, transplant rejection or graft versus host disease.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="pone.0002241-Cooper1"><label>1</label><citation
