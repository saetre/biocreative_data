Given its phylogenetic homology with members of the CC chemokine receptor subfamily, orphan serpentine receptor chemokine (CC motif) receptor-like 2 (CCRL2; also known as L-CCR [LPS-inducible C-C chemokine receptor related gene] or Eo1 in mice, and HCR [human chemokine receptor], CRAM-A, CRAM-B, or CKRX [chemokine receptor X] in humans) has been identified as a potential leukocyte chemoattractant receptor. However, CCRL2 possesses an uncharacteristic intracellular loop 2 sequence in place of the DRYLAIV motif generally found in signaling chemokine receptors (QRYLVFL in huCCRL2 and QRYRVSF in mCCRL2), leading us to postulate that it might be an &#x0201c;atypical&#x0201d; silent or nonsignaling receptor. From a phylogenetic standpoint, CCRL2 may be unique, as its orthologues are more divergent in sequence that any other mouse-to-man receptor pair in the chemoattractant G protein&#x02013;coupled receptor (GPCR) subfamily. The sequence identity of mouse and human CCRL2 is only 51%, compared with &#x0223c;80% identity between most other receptor orthologues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">3</xref>).</p><p>mCCRL2 was initially shown to be up-regulated at the RNA level in peritoneal macrophages treated with LPS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">3</xref>). In experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis, a murine model of multiple sclerosis, CCRL2 RNA is expressed in the spinal column early during the onset of disease by astrocytes, microglia, and infiltrating macrophages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">4</xref>). Astrocytes and microglia also up-regulate mCCRL2 in response to LPS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">5</xref>). In a model of ovalbumin-induced airway inflammation, infiltrating lung macrophages express CCRL2 RNA after ovalbumin challenge, whereas the bronchial epithelium is constitutively positive for expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">6</xref>). By mAb staining, huCCRL2 is expressed by circulating human T cells, neutrophils, monocytes, CD34<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> BM precursors, and monocyte-derived macrophages and DCs and is generally up-regulated upon activation of such cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">7</xref>). HuCCRL2 is also expressed on synovial fluid neutrophils (from rheumatoid arthritis patients) and is up-regulated on freshly isolated blood neutrophils treated with LPS or TNF&#x003b1; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">8</xref>). Although there is a study indicating that CCR2 ligands such as CCL2 act as functional ligands for CCRL2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">9</xref>), this finding remains controversial (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">8</xref>; for review see reference <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">10</xref>).</p><p>Several atypical serpentine GPCRs that are homologous to chemoattractant receptors bind to chemoattractants but fail to transduce intracellular signals through heterotrimeric G proteins and/or support cell migration. This functionally defined receptor subfamily is currently thought to be comprised of three members: D6, DARC (Duffy antigen receptor for chemokines), and CCX-CKR (ChemoCentryx chemokine receptor) (for review see references <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">11</xref>). These receptors are also referred to as professional chemokine &#x0201c;interceptors,&#x0201d; a name which reflects their ability to efficiently internalize bound ligand (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">12</xref>). These receptors also lack the consensus DRYLAIV-related sequence present in the second intracellular loop domain of most chemokine receptors, possibly accounting for their inability to transduce classical intracellular signals (the sequence is DKYLEIV in D6, LGHRLGA in DARC, and DRYWAIT in CCX-CKR). Identifying ligands for &#x0201c;silent&#x0201d; or nonsignaling orphan receptors has proven to be particularly challenging because the assays employed in most GPCR ligand screens generally depend on functional responses, such as intracellular calcium mobilization, cell migration, or transcriptional activation.</p><p>D6 is expressed by lymphatic endothelium and by some leukocytes and binds proinflammatory CC chemokines. It is constitutively internalized (independent of chemokine binding) and can rapidly degrade large quantities of chemokines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">13</xref>). DARC is expressed by vascular endothelium and is present on RBCs. It binds mostly proinflammatory chemokines (both CC and CXC types), and its expression on RBCs can buffer levels of circulating chemokines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">15</xref>). DARC-bound chemokines on erythrocytes are not presented or transferred to other chemokine receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">16</xref>). Endothelial cell&#x02013;expressed DARC may be able to transcytose certain chemokines, although this finding is controversial (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">18</xref>). CCX-CKR mRNA is expressed in many tissues, including lymph node, spleen, placenta, kidney, brain, and by leukocytes. It binds the homeostatic chemokines CCL19, CCL21, and CXCL13 and has been shown to be able to degrade large quantities of CCL19 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">19</xref>). Genetic deficiencies in D6 or DARC have been associated with exacerbated or dysregulated inflammatory responses, reflecting the importance of interceptors in dampening chemokine-mediated activities (for review see reference <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">10</xref>).</p><p>We and others identified chemerin as a natural nonchemokine chemoattractant ligand for chemokine-like receptor-1 (CMKLR1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">20</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">22</xref>). CMKLR1 is expressed by circulating human plasmacytoid DC (pDC) but not by circulating or tissue mouse DC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">23</xref>). In contrast, tissue resident macrophages in both humans and mice express CMKLR1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">23</xref>). A recent study by Parolini et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">24</xref>) describes CMKLR1 expression by human NK cells. We and others have demonstrated that activation of chemerin involves proteolytic processing of the carboxyl terminus and removal of inhibitory amino acids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">25</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">27</xref>; for review see reference <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">28</xref>). Various serine proteases of the coagulation, fibrinolytic, and inflammatory cascades can activate chemerin, including plasmin, factor XII, and neutrophil elastase and cathepsin G (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">27</xref>). Mast cell tryptase, released upon antigen-mediated cross-linking of surface IgE/Fc&#x003b5;RI on mast cells, is a particularly potent activator of chemerin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">27</xref>). We have also demonstrated that chemerin circulates at low nanomolar concentrations in plasma in an immature inactive proform (for review see reference <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">28</xref>). We hypothesize that chemerin may serve as a nearly ubiquitous &#x0201c;humor&#x0201d; poised to translate tissue damage or bleeding into rapidly generated attractant fields for specialized CMKLR1-positive cells.</p><p>Mast cells, tissue-dwelling derivatives of circulating mast cell progenitors, are anatomically deployed to host-environment boundaries (such as the skin, airways, and alimentary canal) where they can mediate first-line encounters with pathogens and environmental allergens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">29</xref>). Antigen-mediated cross-linking of surface IgE/Fc&#x003b5;RI triggers mast cell degranulation and the release of preformed proinflammatory mediators stored in the cells' cytoplasmic granules, such as histamine, heparin, and proteases (e.g. tryptases, chymases, and cathepsins), and initiates the synthesis and release of lipid mediators (e.g. prostaglandin D<sub>2</sub> and leukotrienes) and diverse cytokines, chemokines, and growth factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">30</xref>). Localized IgE-mediated mast cell &#x0201c;anaphylactic-type&#x0201d; degranulation can be modeled in vivo by experimental IgE-dependent passive cutaneous anaphylaxis (PCA) in mice.</p><p>In this paper, we generated novel mAbs specific for the orphan GPCR mCCRL2 and demonstrated that freshly isolated mouse peritoneal mast cells selectively express the receptor. mCCRL2 KO mice displayed no overt phenotype and had normal numbers of mast cells in the tissues analyzed. When tested in vitro, BM-derived cultured mast cells (BMCMCs) of mCCRL2 KO mouse origin exhibited responses to IgE and specific antigen-mediated cross-linking of Fc&#x003b5;RI that were statistically indistinguishable from those of WT BMCMCs. In IgE-dependent PCA reactions in vivo, a model of IgE-mediated local anaphylaxis, mast cell&#x02013;expressed CCRL2 was not required for the development of cutaneous inflammatory responses in mice sensitized with a high dose of antigen-specific IgE. However, mast cell&#x02013;expressed CCRL2 was required for the development of optimal cutaneous tissue swelling and leukocyte infiltrates in mice sensitized with a low dose of antigen-specific IgE.</p><p>To investigate the mechanism by which CCRL2 may contribute to inflammation, we sought to identify potential CCRL2 ligands. In experiments based on binding rather than functional output, we identified chemerin as a novel nonsignaling protein ligand for both human and mouse receptors. As opposed to chemokine interceptors that serve as a sink for chemokines upon their ligand-induced internalization, chemerin is not rapidly internalized by CCRL2. Rather, CCRL2 concentrates the chemoattractant and increases local chemerin concentrations available to interact with CMKLR1. We propose that CCRL2 is a novel attractant receptor, serving to focus chemerin localization in vivo and contribute to CMKLR1-mediated processes that, in turn, regulate pathways leading to increased vascular permeability, tissue swelling, and leukocyte recruitment.</p><sec><title>RESULTS</title><sec><title>mCCRL2-specific mAbs selectively stain mouse mast cells</title><p>We generated monoclonal antibodies BZ5B8 and BZ2E3 (IgG<sub>2a</sub>&#x003ba;) with reactivity to the extracellular amino-terminal domain of mCCRL2 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 A</xref>). The antibodies were specific to mCCRL2-hemagglutinin (HA)/L1.2 transfectants, displaying no cross-reactivity with other GPCR/L1.2 transfectants tested (mCMKLR1, huCMKLR1, mCRTH2, huCCRL2, or mCCR10). Reactivity with CXCR1&#x02013;6 and CCR1&#x02013;10 was excluded by lack of staining of blood cell subsets or cultured mouse cells known to express these receptors (Fig. S1, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20080300/DC1">http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20080300/DC1</ext-link>; and not depicted). In agreement with published RNA expression data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">3</xref>), peritoneal macrophages treated with LPS up-regulated mCCRL2 protein expression. Expression of mCCRL2 was also up-regulated in such cells by treatment with TNF&#x003b1;, IFN-&#x003b3;, or poly:IC (Fig. S2 A).</p><fig position="float" id="fig1"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p><bold>Mast cells express mCCRL2.</bold> (A) Generation of anti-mCCRL2 specific mAbs.

It was reported that mCCRL2/HEK293 transfectants respond functionally to CCR2 ligands CCL2, CCL5, CCL7, and CCL8 via intracellular calcium mobilization and transwell chemotaxis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">9</xref>), although this conclusion is controversial (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">8</xref>; for review see reference <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">10</xref>). These chemokines did not induce migration of mCCRL2/L1.2 transfectants in our in vitro transwell chemotaxis assays (Fig. S6, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20080300/DC1">http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20080300/DC1</ext-link>). We also tested a panel of known chemoattractants (CCL11, CCL17, CCL22, CCL25, CCL27, CCL28, CXCL9, and CXCL13), as well as protein extracts from homogenized mouse tissues (lungs, kidney, liver, brain, and spleen), and found that none stimulated mCCRL2-dependent chemotaxis in our in vitro transwell chemotaxis assays (unpublished data). Given the aberrant DRYLAIV motif that is present in mouse and human CCRL2, we and others postulated that mCCRL2 may act as a silent receptor (for review see reference <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">10</xref>), which is capable of binding chemoattractants but incapable of transducing signals via classical second messengers. That hypothesis is consistent with the negative results obtained in our efforts to induce chemotaxis of mCCRL2/L1.2 transfectants in our in vitro transwell chemotaxis assays.</p><p>Although we failed to identify evidence of signaling effects of any of the tested chemoattractants, we were able to identify a high-affinity ligand for the receptor: in independent studies in which we were using our anti-CCRL2 mAbs as controls for staining, we serendipitously discovered that chemerin, a protein ligand for signaling receptor CMKLR1 (for review see reference <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">28</xref>), inhibited the binding of mCCRL2-specific mAbs to mouse peritoneal mast cells. In <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6 A</xref>, we illustrate the potent ability of chemerin to inhibit anti-CCRL2 staining of mouse peritoneal mast cells.

Chemerin binding to CCRL2 was not affected by a variety of other chemoattractants (Fig. S7, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20080300/DC1">http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20080300/DC1</ext-link>), and mCRTH2-HA/L1.2 transfectants did not bind to chemerin (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6 D</xref>), demonstrating specificity for chemerin&#x02013;CCRL2 interactions. Interestingly, we were unable to detect chemerin binding to mCMKLR1-HA/L1.2 transfectants in the immunofluorescence chemerin binding assay (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6 D</xref>). This may reflect inhibition of binding by the C-terminal His<sub>8</sub> tag (which would be analogous to the inhibitory activity of the carboxyl-terminal residues in the chemerin proform) or, potentially, inaccessibility of the His<sub>8</sub> epitope to the detection mAbs when His<sub>8</sub>-tagged chemerin is bound to CMKLR1.</p><p>In radioligand binding studies, the His<sub>8</sub> tag had little effect on the potency of chemerin binding to mCCRL2 (EC<sub>50</sub> &#x0003d; 0.8 nM); however, His<sub>8</sub>-tagged chemerin bound with 10-fold less potency to mCMKLR1 (EC<sub>50</sub> &#x0003d; 26.3 nM; Fig. S8 A, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20080300/DC1">http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20080300/DC1</ext-link>). The bioactive 9-mer carboxyl-terminal chemerin peptide (residues 149&#x02013;157, YFPGQFAFS) was 10-fold less potent (EC<sub>50</sub> &#x0003d; 26.2 nM; see <xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8 A</xref>) than chemerin protein in binding to CMKLR1. In CCRL2 binding, however, the bioactive chemerin peptide was an inefficient competitor (EC<sub>50</sub> could not be determined, Fig. S8 B). Thus, the data indicate distinct binding modes for chemerin and CCRL2 versus chemerin and CMKLR1. The carboxyl-terminal domain of chemerin that is critical for binding to CMKLR1 is relatively uninvolved and unencumbered when chemerin is bound to CCRL2.</p><p>Freshly isolated mouse peritoneal mast cells also bound to chemerin (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6 E</xref>), and there was no obvious preference for binding of the proform versus the active serum form (this was also observed in radioligand binding studies using L1.2 transfectants; not depicted). Moreover, mouse peritoneal mast cells bound both human and mouse chemerin (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6 E</xref>). Finally, peritoneal mast cells from mCCRL2 KO mice did not bind to chemerin, further confirming the role of CCRL2 in the binding of chemerin to such mast cells (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6 E</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>CCRL2 does not support chemerin-driven signal transduction</title><p>Despite high-affinity binding to mCCRL2, chemerin failed to trigger intracellular calcium mobilization in mCCRL2/L1.2 transfectants (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7 A</xref>).

Cell surface mCCRL2-HA and mCMKLR1-HA were stained with primary anti-HA mAb on ice, washed, and then shifted to 37&#x000b0;C for various times to permit receptor internalization. The cells were then stained with a secondary antibody to detect remaining surface anti-HA mAb. At the 15-min time point, neither mCCRL2 nor mCMKLR1 had undergone substantial ligand-independent endocytosis, which is similar to CCX-CKR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">19</xref>) and in contrast to D6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">13</xref>). By 60 min there was a noticeable reduction in staining intensity for both human and mouse receptors, suggesting low-level constitutive endocytosis, receptor turnover, and/or antibody release (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8 B</xref>).</p><p>Given that chemerin does not trigger mCCRL2 internalization, it is unlikely that chemerin itself is internalized in substantial amounts in CCRL2<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> cells (in the absence of CMKLR1). To confirm this directly, we loaded mCCRL2-HA/L1.2 cells with His<sub>8</sub>-tagged serum form chemerin and anti-His<sub>6</sub> PE on ice and then shifted the cells to 37&#x000b0;C to permit internalization. At the indicated time points, the cells were washed with either PBS or a high-salt acid wash buffer that strips bound chemerin from the surface of the cell (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8 C</xref>, zero time point). In contrast to D6 and CCX-CKR, where &#x0003e;70% of cell-associated CCL3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">13</xref>) and 100% of cell-associated CCL19 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">19</xref>) became resistant to acid wash within 5 min, respectively, there was essentially no acid-resistant cell-associated chemerin at the 5-min time point and very little at the 60-min time point (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8 C</xref>). In contrast, there was a time-dependent increase in surface-bound chemerin (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8 C</xref>, PBS wash). Freshly isolated peritoneal mouse mast cells also did not internalize chemerin (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8 D</xref>, acid wash). In contrast to mCCRL2/L1.2 transfectants, however, at the 60-min time point there was a considerable reduction in surface-bound chemerin (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8 D</xref>, PBS wash), suggesting either eventual extracellular degradation or chemerin release. Furthermore, mCCRL2-HA/L1.2 transfectants efficiently bound chemerin from dilute aqueous solutions (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8 E</xref>). Thus, it appears that CCRL2 binds and indeed concentrates chemerin on the cell surface.</p><p>Finally, we wanted to assess whether chemerin sequestered by mCCRL2<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> cells could trigger a response in mCMKLR1<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> cells. We loaded empty vector pcDNA3 or mCCRL2-HA L1.2 cells with chemerin, washed with PBS, added the loaded cells to mCMKLR1/L1.2 responder cells labeled with a calcium-sensitive dye, and assessed intracellular calcium mobilization. Chemerin-loaded mCCRL2-HA/L1.2 cells, but not pcDNA3/L1.2 cells, triggered calcium flux in the responder cells (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8 F</xref>). Thus, CCRL2 can concentrate bioactive chemerin, which then is available for interaction with CMKLR1 on adjacent cells.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>The evolutionary conservation of chemerin binding to CCRL2 despite divergence in overall sequence between mouse and human receptors strongly suggests that the interaction of chemerin with CCRL2 is physiologically important. The lack of substantial chemerin internalization by CCRL2 disqualifies the receptor as a professional chemoattractant interceptor and, instead, implicates it as a physiological mediator for the concentration and presentation of bioactive chemerin. We hypothesize, therefore, that CCRL2 serves a novel role among cell surface chemoattractant receptors, regulating the bioavailability of chemerin in vivo to fine-tune immune responses mediated via the signaling receptor CMKLR1. Chemerin inhibits the binding of mAbs specific to amino-terminal epitopes of mCCRL2, implying that chemerin binds directly to the amino-terminal domain of the receptor. In this regard, it is interesting to note that the first 16 aa of human and mouse CCRL2 share 81% identity, compared with just 17% shared identity in the remaining 24 aa of the amino-terminal domain (Fig. S10, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20080300/DC1">http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20080300/DC1</ext-link>). This short conserved amino-terminal sequence may therefore embody a critical chemerin binding domain. Furthermore, CCRL2 binds to chemerin in an orientation that permits antibody access to the short C-terminal His<sub>8</sub> tag, suggesting that the critical cell-signaling carboxyl terminus of chemerin would also be exposed in the untagged form of the protein. Thus, we hypothesize that CCRL2 (e.g. expressed by mast cells and activated macrophages) binds to chemerin in vivo and presents the cell-signaling carboxyl-terminal domain of the chemoattractant to CMKLR1<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> cells such as macrophages, pDC, and NK cells (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Fig. 9</xref>). In its role as a specialized molecule for concentrating extracellular chemerin, CCRL2 may operate akin to glycosaminoglycans, which are thought to bind, concentrate, and present chemokines to leukocytes and facilitate their chemotaxis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">38</xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="fig9"><label>Figure 9.</label><caption><p><bold>Proposed model of presentation of chemerin by CCRL2 to CMKLR1.</bold> (A) Chemerin binds to CCRL2 leaving the C-terminal peptide sequence free. The carboxyl-terminal domain of chemerin is critical for transducing intracellular signals and interacts directly with CMKLR1. CCRL2 may thus allow direct presentation of bound chemerin to adjacent CMKLR1-expressing cells. (B) Alternatively, CCRL2 may concentrate the ligand for proteolytic processing by activated mast cells or macrophages, enhancing the local production of the active form which could then act as a chemoattractant after release from the cell surface.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="jem2052207f09"></graphic></fig><p>In experimental IgE-dependent PCA, a simple in vivo model of an IgE- and mast cell&#x02013;dependent acute allergic reaction, CCLR2-deficient mice expressed WT levels of tissue swelling when the mice were sensitized with one dose of antigen-specific IgE but exhibited significantly reduced tissue swelling associated with PCA reactions elicited in mice sensitized with one third less antigen-specific IgE. This clearly shows that mast cell expression of CCLR2 is not required for elicitation of IgE-dependent PCA but may substantially enhance reactions elicited under conditions where IgE may be limiting. PCA has been widely used to study factors involved in mast cell responses in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">39</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">40</xref>). In our previous studies, we showed that pro-chemerin is rapidly activated by extracellular serine proteases such as secreted mast cell tryptase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">27</xref>). Thus, the acute nature of the PCA reaction is well suited to highlight possible consequences of rapid chemerin conversion in vivo. CCRL2 expression by tissue mast cells may serve to coat the cells with the proform of chemerin, which would be immediately activated upon mast cell degranulation and tryptase release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">27</xref>).</p><p>The reason why the tissue swelling associated with IgE-dependent PCA reactions in CCRL2 KO mice was less than that observed in WT mice is not yet clear. The largest differences in the tissue swelling responses of the WT versus KO mice (or in the mast cell&#x02013;deficient mice that had been engrafted with WT vs. KO BMCMCs) were at 30 min after i.v. antigen challenge, an interval which is too short to observe substantial recruitment of circulating leukocytes to the site of the reaction. Perhaps mast cell&#x02013;bound and then activated chemerin interacts with CMKLR1<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> macrophages or other mononuclear cells that might be present in normal skin, and such cells in turn have effects that can enhance local vascular permeability. Alternatively, other cell types normally resident in the skin, such as vascular endothelial cells, may respond to locally activated chemerin. The reduced leukocyte numbers present in the dermis 6 h after the elicitation of IgE-dependent PCA reactions in mice whose dermal mast cells lacked CCLR2 indicates that a lack of mast cell CCLR2 also can diminish the longer term consequences of IgE-dependent cutaneous reactions, perhaps by multiple mechanisms (which are yet to be defined). Mast cells themselves are CMKLR1<sup>&#x02212;</sup> (Fig. S11). Notably, the inflammation associated with relatively strong PCA reactions was not substantially affected by the presence of absence of CCRL2, whether on all cells types (Fig. S4A) or only on skin mast cells (Fig. S4, B and C). Thus, whatever contribution mast cell&#x02013;associated CCRL2 makes to the tissue swelling and leukocyte infiltrates associated with PCA responses appears to enhance tissue sensitivity to suboptimal IgE-dependent mast cell activation.</p><p>Treatment of peritoneal macrophages with proinflammatory cytokines (IFN-&#x003b3; and TNF&#x003b1;) or TLR ligands (LPS and poly:IC but not CpG) up-regulates CCRL2 expression (Fig. S2 A) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">3</xref>). We observed synergistic effects on receptor up-regulation when TNF&#x003b1; or IFN-&#x003b3; treatment was combined with LPS. An analysis of transcription factor binding sites revealed an interferon-stimulated response element (ISRE) upstream of the CCRL2 promoter, which is conserved among mammals and may be responsible for the IFN-&#x003b3;&#x02013;mediated regulation of gene expression in macrophages (Fig. S2 B). LPS and IFN-&#x003b3; did not influence CCRL2 expression on similarly treated peritoneal mast cells (unpublished data). The constitutive expression of CCRL2 on freshly isolated mast cells and the regulated expression of CCRL2 on macrophages indicates that there can be cell type&#x02013;specific regulation of CCRL2 gene expression. Furthermore, it is interesting to note that CCRL2 and CMKLR1 on macrophages are reciprocally regulated (e.g., LPS causes down-regulation of CMKLR1 but up-regulation of CCRL2 (Fig. S2 A) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">23</xref>). Our data indicate that at some point before 24 h after activation by TLR ligands or proinflammatory cytokines, macrophages can concurrently express both chemerin receptors CMKLR1 and CCRL2. The functional consequence of this is under investigation.</p><p>CCRL2 may play distinct physiological roles depending on the cellular context of its expression. In a general survey of mouse tissues, mCCRL2 is expressed at the RNA level in the lung, heart, and spleen, with minimal expression in the brain or thymus (Fig. S12, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20080300/DC1">http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20080300/DC1</ext-link>). CCRL2 expression by stromal cells in the lung and heart may serve to maintain a reservoir of chemerin and to buffer tissue levels of the attractant in vivo in the same manner that erythrocyte-expressed atypical chemokine receptor DARC can serve as a buffer to maintain chemokine levels in the blood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">15</xref>). We are currently investigating this hypothesis by comparing chemerin protein levels in blood and tissue extracts from WT and CCRL2 KO mice.</p><p>Transfectant-expressed CCRL2 has been reported to bind CCL2 and CCL5, although this result is controversial (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">9</xref>). CCL2 did not interfere with anti-mCCRL2 mAb staining in our studies. In addition, using either the binding conditions published in this paper for chemerin or those published by Biber et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">9</xref>) for CCL2, we were unable to confirm the binding of biotinylated CCL2 to CCRL2/L1.2 transfectants (unpublished data). However, it is unclear whether the biotinylated CCL2 reagent available to us is useful for identifying cognate receptor expression because we observed similar high background binding of this reagent to T cells in WT and CCR2 KO mice.</p><p>The identification of natural ligands for silent or nonsignaling receptors (such as D6, DARC, and CCX-CKR) has lagged behind the deorphaning of signaling receptors. This is likely because of an intrinsic bias toward GPCR-ligand screening methods that rely on measuring functional responses (e.g., calcium mobilization or chemotaxis), rather than binding, per se, to identify &#x0201c;hits&#x0201d;. Although there are &#x0003e;100 orphan heptahelical GPCR sequences that have been identified via genome sequencing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">41</xref>), the phylogenetic homology of CCRL2 with CC chemokine receptors, and its expression at the RNA level by LPS activated macrophages, suggested that CCRL2 may be a modulator of leukocyte trafficking. Indeed, we show herein that the expression of CCLR2 by mast cells can enhance the numbers of leukocytes in the dermis at sites of IgE-dependent cutaneous inflammation (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 D</xref>). The identification of chemerin as a nonsignaling ligand for CCRL2 introduces a novel functionality for atypical receptors (i.e., concentration and presentation, as we have shown herein for CCRL2, as opposed to internalization/degradation). Our findings expand the possible ligand space for atypical orphan receptors to include chemoattractants beyond the chemokine family and provide a potential link between CCRL2 expression and chemerin-dependent effects on inflammation that are mediated via the cell-signaling chemerin receptor CMKLR1.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec disp-level="3"><title>Antibodies and reagents.</title><p>Anti-mouse CD11b, CD14, CD19, B220, Gr1, and TCR&#x003b2; dye-linked mAb were obtained from eBioscience.

For BMCMC engraftment experiments, BMCMCs were generated from either WT or LCCR KO mice, and 10<sup>6</sup> cells in 40 &#x003bc;l DMEM were injected into the ear skin of mast cell&#x02013;deficient <italic>Kit<sup>W-sh/Wsh</sup></italic> mice. 6&#x02013;8 wk later, the mice were subjected to experimental PCA. After the assay, the mast cells in the ear skin were enumerated in formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded toluidine blue&#x02013;stained sections to evaluate the extent of engraftment. In some experiments, formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded hematoxylin and eosin&#x02013;stained sections were examined to enumerate numbers of leukocytes present in the dermis. In all histological studies, examination of the slides was performed by an observer who was not aware of the identity of individual sections.</p></sec><sec disp-level="3"><title>FITC-induced contact hypersensitivity (CHS).</title><p>FITC-induced CHS was performed as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">34</xref>) with minor modifications.

Cells were incubated in binding buffer (Hanks &#x0002b; 0.5% BSA) for 3 h at 4&#x000b0;C shaking with 1 nM <sup>125</sup>I-chemerin and increasing concentrations of chemerin, His<sub>8</sub>-tagged chemerin, or peptide (9-aa YFPGQFAFS, corresponding to chemerin residues 149&#x02013;157) as competitors. For saturation binding assays, mCCRL2/L1.2 cells were plated at 0.5 &#x000d7; 10<sup>6</sup> cells/well. Nonspecific binding was measured in the presence of 100 nM cold chemerin. Binding was terminated by washing the cells in saline buffer, and bound radioactivity was measured. Data were analyzed using Prism (GraphPad Software, Inc.). Binding data (triplicate or quadruplicate wells) were fitted to one-site binding hyperbola for saturation assays or to a one-site competition curve for competition assays. For direct chemerin binding immunofluorescence assays, mCCRL2-HA, huCCRL2-HA, mCMKLR1-HA, and mCRTH2-HA L1.2 transfectants were incubated for 30 min on ice with 10 nM His<sub>8</sub>-tagged serum form human chemerin and the indicated concentration of untagged chemerin in binding buffer (PBS with 0.5% BSA and 0.02% azide).
