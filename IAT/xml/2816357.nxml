However, its expression by resident microglial cells <italic>in vivo</italic> remains uncertain. In this work, we aimed to elucidate the murine CNS expression of uPAR and uPA as well as that of tissue plasminogen activator and plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 (PAI-1) during insults generating distinct and well-characterized inflammatory responses; acute intracerebral lipopolysaccharide (LPS), acute kainate-induced neurodegeneration, and chronic neurodegeneration induced by prion disease inoculation. All three insults induced marked expression of uPAR at both mRNA and protein level compared to controls (na&#x000ef;ve, saline, or control inoculum-injected). uPAR expression was microglial in all cases. Conversely, uPA transcription and activity was only markedly increased during chronic neurodegeneration. Dissociation of uPA and uPAR levels in acute challenges is suggestive of additional proteolysis-independent roles for uPAR. PAI-1 was most highly expressed upon LPS challenge, whereas tissue plasminogen activator mRNA was constitutively present and less responsive to all insults studied. These data are novel and suggest much wider involvement of the uPAR/uPA system in CNS function and pathology than previously supposed. &#x000a9; 2009 Wiley-Liss, Inc.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>chronic neurodegeneration</kwd><kwd>neuroinflammation</kwd><kwd>plasminogen</kwd><kwd>proteolysis</kwd><kwd>activation</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>The urokinase plasminogen activator (uPA) receptor (uPAR) is a GPI-linked cell-surface protein that is best characterized as a region-specific focus for uPA protease activity at the cell surface. Binding of uPA to uPAR greatly accelerates the cleavage of plasminogen to active plasmin, and the receptor acts to concentrate this activation at discrete membrane locations. This is believed to be a key event in cell adhesion and migration and has been extensively researched in cancer metastases [see (Blasi and Carmeliet,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">2002</xref>) for review]. Monocytes/macrophages are important migratory cells and uPAR has been shown to be expressed by cells of the monocyte lineage (Min et al.,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b47">1992</xref>; Vassalli et al.,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b68">1992</xref>) and to be inducible by cytokines, in particular, transforming growth factor &#x003b2;1 (TGF&#x003b2;1) (Lund et al.,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">1991</xref>). Under normal conditions, uPAR expression is negligible and uPAR knockout mice were initially found to be phenotypically normal but further study revealed that, under challenge, they displayed defective recruitment and migration of neutrophils and lymphocytes (Gyetko et al.,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">2000</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">2004</xref>). Low-level expression of uPAR has been shown in cultured microglial cells, and this expression was increased upon lipopolysaccharide (LPS) stimulation; however, uPAR could not be detected in microglia immediately <italic>ex vivo</italic> (Washington et al.,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b71">1996</xref>). Soluble uPAR (suPAR) is elevated in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of patients with HIV dementia (Cinque et al.,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">2004</xref>), and it seems likely that this release of suPAR into the CSF is directly related to increased central nervous system (CNS) inflammation: uPAR has been described in macrophages/microglia within the CNS in traumatic brain injury, HIV dementia, multiple sclerosis, cerebral malaria, Creutzfeldt&#x02013;Jakob disease (CJD), and Alzheimer's disease (Beschorner et al.,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">2000</xref>; Cinque et al.,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">2004</xref>; Deininger et al.,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">2002</xref>; Fauser et al.,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">2000</xref>; Gveric et al.,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">2001</xref>; Sidenius et al.,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b56">2004</xref>; Walker et al.,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b69">2002</xref>). However, clear direct evidence for resident (i.e. noninfiltrating) microglial expression of uPAR is still lacking, and its expression in different CNS insults has not been studied in any systematic way.</p><p>It has been recognized for some time that tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) is expressed and is constitutively active in the normal CNS (Sappino et al.,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b54">1993</xref>), in which it is proposed to have roles in synaptic plasticity, long-term potentiation, and neuronal migration [see Melchor and Strickland (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b46">2005</xref>) for review]. In addition, tPA activity is decreased in models of Alzheimer's disease, and this is thought to occur through increased expression of PAI-1 (Cacquevel et al.,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">2007</xref>; Melchor et al.,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b45">2003</xref>). Conversely, tPA activity is increased upon intracerebral injection of kainic acid, and this plasmin activity has a key role in the resulting neurotoxicity (Tsirka et al.,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b66">1995</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b65">1997</xref>). Increased tPA activity in models of prion disease have lead to the suggestion that frustrated attempts by plasmin to proteolytically cleave the deposited form of the prion protein result in bystander damage to neuronal elements during this disease (Ellis et al.,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">2002</xref>; Maissen et al.,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b44">2001</xref>). However, studies with tPA&#x02212;/&#x02212; and plasminogen&#x02212;/&#x02212; mice have yielded contradictory results (Salmona et al.,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b53">2005</xref>; Xanthopoulos et al.,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b74">2005</xref>). It is clear that tPA has multiple roles in both physiological and pathological situations in the brain. Conversely, uPA has generally been described as being absent from the normal CNS (Sappino et al.,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b54">1993</xref>). However, uPA is known to be stress responsive and is robustly induced during inflammation (Gabay and Kushner,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">1999</xref>). uPA is expressed in the inflamed CNS in a model of experimental allergic encephalopathy (East et al.,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">2005</xref>) and in cerebral ischemia in rodents and in humans (Rosenberg et al.,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b52">1996</xref>).</p><p>Because it is clear that there is complimentarity and redundancy in the plasmin cascade (Carmeliet et al.,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">1994</xref>), it is important to study, in detail, the expression of constituents of this system <italic>in vivo</italic> in addition to deleting selected genes. We have studied the expression of uPAR and uPA, as well as tPA and PAI-1, in the CNS in a number of insults that generate distinct and well-characterized inflammatory responses: acute nondegenerative inflammation induced by LPS (Andersson et al.,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">1992</xref>), acute neurodegeneration-associated inflammation induced by kainic acid (Andersson et al.,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">1991a</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">b</xref>), and chronic neurodegeneration-associated inflammation induced during prion disease (Betmouni et al.,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">1996</xref>; Cunningham et al.,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">2002</xref>; Walsh et al.,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b70">2001</xref>). Together, these insults generate a range of different innate inflammatory milieu in which uPAR and other components of the plasmin cascade may be expressed in the brain. These different insults induced alterations in the expression/activity of tPA and PAI-1 that were consistent with previous observations, but also revealed novel patterns of uPA and uPAR expression that suggest wider involvement of this system in the CNS than previously supposed.</p></sec><sec><title>EXPERIMENTAL</title><sec><title>Animals and Stereotaxic Surgery</title><p>Female C57BL/6 mice were obtained from Harlan (Bicester, UK), housed in groups of five or six under standard light and temperature regimes, and fed with pelleted food and water <italic>ad libitum</italic>. For LPS challenges, animals were anesthetized with intraperitoneal avertin, positioned in a stereotaxic frame, and injected with 2.5 &#x003bc;g LPS (<italic>Salmonella equine abortus</italic>, Sigma, Poole, UK) in 1 &#x003bc;L, via a pulled glass microcapillary tube (coordinates from bregma: anterior&#x02013;posterior &#x02212;2.0 mm, lateral &#x02212;1.6 mm, and depth &#x02212;1.5 mm). For kainate challenges, 1 nmol of kainic acid (Sigma, Dorset, UK) was injected by exactly the same method as used for LPS. For inoculation with prion disease, animals were anesthetized in the same manner, and 1 &#x003bc;L of a 10% w/v ME7-infected C57BL/6 brain homogenate, made in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), was injected bilaterally into the dorsal hippocampus (same coordinates) via a 10-&#x003bc;L Hamilton syringe. Control animals were injected with a 10% w/v normal brain homogenate (NBH) in PBS, derived from a naive C57BL/6 mouse. In addition, we made saline challenges and collected tissue from naive mice, both young adult and 8&#x02013;9 months (age-matched to late stage ME7 and NBH animals). All procedures were carried out in accordance with UK Home Office license.</p></sec><sec><title>Tissue Preparation</title><p>Animals challenged intracerebrally with LPS were terminally anesthetized at 6, 8, or 72 h post-LPS and examined for evidence of cell infiltration/inflammatory activation, because cytokine expression/microglial activation occurs significantly earlier (6/8 h) than macrophage and neutrophil infiltration (Andersson et al.,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">1992</xref>). Kainate-injected animals were euthanised at 24 h or 72 h post-injection. Neurodegeneration begins synchronously upon kainate challenge but significant macrophage infiltration occurs at 48 h post-kainate (Andersson et al.,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">1991a</xref>) and at 72 h most of the CA1 neurons of the hippocampus show clear morphological signs of nuclear condensation. Animals inoculated with ME7 prion disease were euthanized at 12, 15, 18, 20, and 23 weeks postinoculation for all mRNA studies, with NBH animals taken at 12 and 23 weeks for comparison. For protein expression studies in the ME7 model, this range was narrowed to 13, 18, and 21 weeks postinoculation to reduce animal usage. These times represent points in disease displaying hippocampal synaptic loss, hippocampal neuronal cell soma loss, and terminal disease, respectively (Cunningham et al.,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">2003a</xref>). Tissues were homogenized in PBS with Complete&#x02122; protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche) and centrifuged at 12,000 rpm for 10 min, and the supernatant was harvested (S1, representing soluble proteins).

Two hundred nanograms of total RNA were reverse transcribed in a 10-&#x003bc;L reaction volume. One microliter of the RT reaction (equivalent to 20-ng RNA) was subsequently used for the PCR and performed as previously described (Cunningham et al.,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">2005</xref>). A standard curve was constructed from total RNA isolated from mouse brain tissue after intracerebral challenge with 2.5 &#x003bc;g LPS, which is known to upregulate all target transcripts of interest in this study. This standard curve was constructed using a higher concentration of RNA in the reverse transcriptase reaction than for samples for analysis to ensure that transcription in all animal groups would fall within the range of the standard curve constructed. Serial 1 in five dilutions of the cDNA synthesized from brains of LPS-injected mice were made and a curve plotted of the <italic>C</italic><sub>t</sub> value (the cycle number at which the transcribed gene crosses the threshold of detection) versus the log of the concentration (assigned an arbitrary value since the absolute concentration of cytokine transcripts is not known). Thus, the standard curve generates arbitrary values for concentration.

All biotinylated secondary antibodies were supplied by Vector laboratories (Peterborough, UK) and all staining was visualised using the ABC method using peroxidase as enzyme, 0.015% v/v hydrogen peroxide as substrate and diaminobenzidine as chromagen. Frozen paraformaldehyde-lysine-periodate-fixed brain sections were cut on a cryostat and stored at &#x02212;20&#x000b0;C. On removal from the freezer sections were dried at 37&#x000b0;C for 30 min. Endogenous peroxidase was quenched using methanol containing 1 ml 30% H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> for 20 min.

After 1 h of blocking with MOM blocking diluent and 5 min with MOM working solution, the primary monoclonal antibody BR4.8 (Sidenius, unpublished) was applied at 2 &#x003bc;g/ml and left to incubate in a humidified chamber for 2 h. This antibody was then washed off and sections were washed overnight in PBS-Tween. Biotinylated horse anti-mouse antibody was prepared in MOM diluent and left at room temperature for 30 min.

In contrast, ME7 animals showed a clear and time-dependent increase in expression of uPAR with disease progression, reaching &#x0223c;15-fold elevation compared to NBH animals by 20 weeks postinoculation.

In ME7 animals, by contrast, uPA transcription was markedly induced, by &#x0223c;17-fold by 20 weeks postinoculation. This increase is once again time-dependent, with induction already apparent and statistically significant at 12 weeks (Bonferroni <italic>post hoc</italic><italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.01).

Further homogenates were prepared from kainate-injected hippocampi 24 and 72 h after challenge or 24 h after saline injection. Homogenates from NBH animals (21 weeks) and ME7 animals (13, 18, and 21 weeks) were also prepared. These times are justified in the Experimental section. Homogenates were analyzed by PAGE and Western blotting for uPAR protein levels using an anti-mouse polyclonal antibody, and the results are summarized in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02">2</xref>a. Because of its marked glycosylation, previously observed in mice (Cunningham et al.,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">2003b</xref>) and humans (Roldan et al.,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b51">1990</xref>), uPAR runs as a smear at between 45 and 60 kDa. LPS induced a marked expression of uPAR protein at 8 h postinjection and a dramatic increase by 3 days posttreatment (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02">2</xref>a). A further band at &#x0223c;35 kDa may represent the unglycosylated form of the protein (Roldan et al.,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b51">1990</xref>). Further data (Supp. Info. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. 2</xref>) show that the pattern of uPAR expression/glycosylation is not yet altered 2 h post-LPS, but is altered at 6 h and markedly so at 24 h. Immunoblots with mouse anti-&#x003b2;-actin and with goat anti-rabbit IgG on the same membrane verified that all lanes show approximately equal loading and that the observed bands are a consequence of binding of the rabbit antimurine uPAR antibody. uPAR was expressed at very low levels in saline-treated animals. Kainate-injected animals also showed clear expression of uPAR at 24 h postinjection with respect to saline-treated controls (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02">2</xref>b). This expression appeared to decrease by 3 days. ME7 animals showed a time-dependent increase in uPAR expression, with marked expression by 13 weeks and continued increases at 18 and 21 weeks, respectively (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02">2</xref>c).

The staining levels are very low in saline-injected (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig05">5</xref>a) and NBH-injected control animals (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig05">5</xref>c), but there was nonetheless, labeling of the highly ramified processes of microglial cells in their normal quiescent state (5 o,p). The staining was clearly increased in animals 8-h post-LPS challenge, and this staining revealed microglial cells maintaining a ramified morphology (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig05">5</xref>b). Animals examined 3 days after LPS challenge showed evidence of diffuse extracellular uPAR staining, apparently throughout the parenchyma, consistent with cleavage of GPI-linked uPAR to increase suPAR levels (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig05">5</xref>j). Cleavage and shedding of uPAR is well documented in monocytes (Sidenius et al.,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b57">2000</xref>). In the same manner, uPAR was upregulated 3 days post-KA challenge on microglial cells with shortened processes in the vicinity of the dying neurons of the CA1 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig05">5</xref>e,i,s,t). Furthermore, the contralateral side to KA injection also showed hyper-ramified microglial staining with uPAR expression (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig05">5</xref>d,q,r). ME7 animals also showed clear evidence of microglial uPAR staining (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig05">5</xref>f) with microglia showing upregulation of uPAR throughout the hippocampus and dorsal thalamus, as has been shown previously for other microglial markers in this disease model (Betmouni et al.,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">1996</xref>). Similar to LPS and KA challenges, ME7 animals also showed evidence of diffuse uPAR staining in the parenchyma that was not associated with particular cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig05">5</xref>h) and was increased relative to the very low-parenchymal labeling in NBH-treated animals (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig05">5</xref>c,g).</p><fig id="fig05" position="float"><label>Fig. 5</label><caption><p>Cellular localization of uPAR expression.

Low-level staining of highly ramified microglial processes can be observed in control animals; (a) saline (8 h) and (c) NBH (18 weeks). Increased expression is evident in (b) LPS (8 h) tissue and (d) contralateral to KA challenge, though the morphology remains quite ramified. Marked expression of uPAR is evident in amoeboid microglia ipsilateral to KA challenge (e) and in condensed microglia in ME7-treated animals (f).

F4/80 immunostaining revealed constitutive labeling of ramified microglial cells in NBH and saline-injected animals (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig05">5</xref>k,p), and this morphology was shared by uPAR-positive cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig05">5</xref>o). The levels of expression of the F4/80 antigen and the morphology of macrophages/microglia are altered in LPS, KA, and ME7-injected animals (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig05">5</xref>n,m,l, respectively). This is most obvious ipsilateral to KA challenge, after which the microglial processes become shorter and condensed, and these cells invade the degenerating CA1 neuronal layer (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig05">5</xref>m). This classical activated/amoeboid morphology is clearly shown by both uPAR and F4/80 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig05">5</xref>s,t). Significantly, the hyper-ramified morphology typical of &#x0201c;alert&#x0201d; microglia was also observed on the contralateral side to the kainate challenge and also is displayed by both markers (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig05">5</xref>q,r). Thus, F4/80-staining parallels the cellular staining observed with the anti-uPAR antibody in its morphology and localization after the different challenges. Significantly, uPAR expression is present in resident microglial cells before any infiltration of cells from the bloodstream has taken place (Andersson et al.,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">1992</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>We have shown here that uPAR is expressed by resident microglial cells of the murine brain and that it is significantly upregulated in the brain in response to a number of challenges that provoke an innate immune response. At peak expression, there is considerable shedding of this GPI-linked protein from the cell surface into the brain parenchyma. This is the first clear demonstration, <italic>in vivo</italic>, that resident microglia as well as infiltrating macrophages expresses this protein. In addition, we have shown expression and activity of uPA in the murine brain, particularly during the progression of chronic neurodegeneration caused by the ME7 strain of murine prion disease. There are interesting dissociations between the inductions of uPA and uPAR among the various challenges studied here. Both LPS and kainate-induced neurodegeneration led to very marked inductions of uPAR with minimal effect on uPA expression, whereas chronic neurodegeneration induces uPA and uPAR transcriptional increases of similar magnitude (14&#x02013;20-fold) perhaps indicating divergent roles of protease activity in these models.</p><sec><title>uPAR and uPA Expression in the Brain</title><p>Monocytes/macrophages are known to express uPAR (Min et al.,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b47">1992</xref>; Vassalli et al.,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b68">1992</xref>), and levels of expression are reported to be elevated during endotoxemia and by various cytokines including IL-1&#x003b2;, TNF-&#x003b1;, and TGF&#x003b2;1 (Dekkers et al.,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">2000</xref>; Yue et al.,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b75">2004</xref>). The expression of uPAR and its site-directed focusing of uPA activity play a central role in cell migration and infiltration to sites of inflammation (Gyetko et al.,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">2000</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">2004</xref>). Low-level expression of uPAR has been described in microglial cells <italic>in vitro</italic>, and this expression was increased upon LPS stimulation; however, uPAR could not be detected in microglia immediately <italic>ex vivo</italic> by these authors (Washington et al.,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b71">1996</xref>). There have been reports of brain macrophage/microglial cell surface uPAR expression in HIV dementia, multiple sclerosis, cerebral malaria, traumatic brain injury, CJD, and Alzheimer's disease (Beschorner et al.,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">2000</xref>; Cinque etal.,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">2004</xref>; Deininger et al.,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">2002</xref>; Fauser et al.,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">2000</xref>; Gveric et al.,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">2001</xref>; Sidenius et al.,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b56">2004</xref>; Walker et al.,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b69">2002</xref>). Some of these studies show either double staining with macrophage markers or morphology suggestive of microglial cells. However, most of these studies describe conditions in which macrophages have recently infiltrated the brain. Even in a chronic disease, such as Alzheimer's disease (Walker et al.,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b69">2002</xref>), in which uPAR positive staining is colocalized with CD68-positive macrophages, it is not clear whether these are resident or infiltrating cells, because bone marrow-derived infiltrating macrophages have been reported to be selectively targeted to amyloid plaques in animal models of Alzheimer's disease (Simard et al.,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b58">2006</xref>).</p><p>In this study, we demonstrate that uPAR is expressed in resident microglial cells in the normal brain and in both acute and chronic inflammation. Immunohistochemistry reveals that uPAR is expressed at very low levels in na&#x000ef;ve and saline-treated mice but is significantly upregulated by LPS many hours before cell infiltration occurs, demonstrating that resident microglial cells upregulate this cell surface marker upon stimulation. In light of its role in cell migration, the expression of uPAR by infiltrating macrophages in the brain was readily rationalized. Although the need for local extracellular protease activity is not so obvious for resident cells, recent data demonstrate that microglia continually explore their local microenvironment, and these cells are well known to respond rapidly to transient neural activity suppression by stimulation with potassium chloride (cortical spreading depression: (Gehrmann et al.,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">1993</xref>; Jander et al.,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">2001</xref>) and to show activation in undamaged regions, distal to ischemic lesions (Schroeter et al.,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b55">1999</xref>). In this regard, it is interesting that in our studies even saline challenges produce measurable increases in uPAR gene expression when compared with na&#x000ef;ve animals and that uPAR is robustly expressed in hyper-ramified microglia contralateral to kainate challenges, indicating that even minor disturbances to the brain parenchyma provoke transcriptional, translational, and perhaps structural changes in microglial cells. The interaction of uPA with uPAR may thus contribute to morphological changes and migration toward relatively proximal stimuli.</p><p>It is also possible that uPAR has roles in brain inflammation that are entirely dissociated from the focusing of uPA activity. We show here that uPAR is highly expressed after both kainate and LPS challenges, but that uPA is not significantly upregulated under the same conditions. There is now a large body of evidence to support multiple proteolysis-independent roles for uPAR in cell adhesion, migration, proliferation, and differentiation outside the CNS [reviewed in Blasi and Carmeliet (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">2002</xref>)]. Recent experiments suggest that uPAR has a uPA-independent role in ischemic damage (Nagai et al.,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b49">2008</xref>). A second, key-binding partner of uPAR is the extracellular matrix protein vitronectin (VN). Overexpression of uPAR in HEK-293 cells <italic>in vitro</italic> and subsequent uPAR-VN interaction was shown to induce profound changes in cell morphology, including cell spreading and rearrangement of the actin cytoskeleton and focal adhesion contacts (Madsen et al.,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">2007</xref>). This cell&#x02013;matrix interaction could be postulated to mediate the morphological changes that are observed upon activation of resident microglia, leading to the less-ramified, more-condensed morphology after inflammatory challenges. In addition, VN has been shown to be present in diffuse and dense core plaques in Alzheimer's disease (Akiyama et al.,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1991</xref>), and its interaction with uPAR may also influence microglial activation at the plaque periphery.</p><p>We also observed variation in uPAR glycosylation with different challenges. Levels of uPAR protein expression are most robustly induced after acute LPS challenge, and it is also this condition that leads to the highest level of uPAR glycosylation (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02">2</xref>a). In contrast, uPAR glycosylation is not as marked during the development of prion disease (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02">2</xref>c). Time-dependent changes in uPAR glycosylation levels have previously been observed during monocyte activation, and this has been shown to be correlated with protein&#x02013;protein interactions important in mediating cell adhesion (Mahoney et al.,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b43">2001</xref>). Similar alterations in <italic>N</italic>-glycosylation patterns have recently been reported in a number of inflammatory conditions including sepsis, acute pancreatitis, and systemic lupus erythematosus (Gornik et al.,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">2007</xref>; Hashii et al.,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">2008</xref>), and the significance of different glycosylation patterns in the current data merits further study.</p><p>The high levels of uPAR expression observed in the current study, during CNS inflammation induced by three distinct challenges (chronic neurodegeneration, acute neurotoxicity, and acute non-neurotoxic LPS), can perhaps explain the frequently reported elevations of suPAR in the CSF of patients with HIV dementia and other CNS conditions (Cinque et al.,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">2004</xref>; Garcia-Monco et al.,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">2002</xref>; Sporer et al.,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b60">2005</xref>; Winkler et al.,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b73">2002</xref>). Conversely, neither stroke nor demyelinating diseases such as MS or Guillian&#x02013;Barre syndrome resulted in elevated CSF suPAR despite comprising significant inflammatory components (Garcia-Monco et al.,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">2002</xref>). It seems likely that release of suPAR into the CSF is directly related to increased CNS inflammation as we observed considerable diffuse staining, that was not cell-associated, in the parenchyma in addition to microglial labeling. This would suggest that uPAR is unlikely to have specific diagnostic utility for any particular CNS condition but is likely to be a reliable indicator of current CNS inflammation. It would appear that many types of inflammation result in shedding of suPAR from the microglial cell surface in the brain; however, other factors, currently unknown, may determine uPAR's escape to the CSF. Likewise, findings that cell-surface levels of uPAR are controlled by endocytosis and recycling (Cortese et al.,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">2008</xref>) should be replicated in microglia, although this would be more easily addressed using <italic>in vitro</italic> approaches.</p></sec><sec><title>uPA or tPA?</title><p>Tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) is constitutively active in the rodent brain (Sappino et al.,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b54">1993</xref>) and contributes to the neurotoxicity of kainic acid in rodent studies (Tsirka et al.,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b66">1995</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b65">1997</xref>) and, in this regard, our finding that tPA rather than uPA is upregulated after kainate challenge is consistent with the consensus view of kainate-induced microglial expression of neurotoxic tPA. Nonetheless, there is clear evidence that uPA rather than tPA is the key plasminogen activator in cerebral ischemia in mice, rats, and humans (Cinelli et al.,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">2001</xref>; Hosomi et al.,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">2001</xref>; Rosenberg et al.,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b52">1996</xref>), and it has recently been described as coexpressed with uPA in brains of HIV patients with opportunistic cerebral infections (Nebuloni et al.,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b50">2008</xref>). So, what governs whether either or both plasminogen activators are switched on during inflammation? It is well described that uPA is robustly upregulated by macrophage CSF-1 (Stacey et al.,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b61">1995</xref>), and we have found evidence for increased transcription of CSF-1 in the ME7 prion disease model (unpublished observations). In addition, both tPA and uPA have been described to be differentially regulated in multiple cell types by IL-1&#x003b1;/&#x003b2;, TNF&#x003b1;, TGF&#x003b2;1, and prostaglandin E2 (Allan and Martin,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">1995</xref>; Falcone et al.,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">1993</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">1995</xref>; Gerritsen et al.,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">1993</xref>; So et al.,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b59">1992</xref>; Zhang et al.,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b76">1996</xref>). All these mediators are produced by intracerebral LPS challenges (Boche et al.,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">2003</xref>), but TGF&#x003b2;1 and PGE2 would appear to dominate in ME7-induced prion disease (Cunningham et al.,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">2002</xref>; Minghetti et al.,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b48">2000</xref>). Clearly, the regulation of tPA and uPA in the brain requires considerably more investigation.</p><p>There have been a number of studies published describing a role for plasminogen activation in prion disease, but these studies have been focussed on tPA. Initial studies demonstrated a direct interaction between plasminogen and disease-associated PrP (Fischer et al.,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">2000</xref>; Maissen et al.,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b44">2001</xref>), and subsequent <italic>in vitro</italic> studies suggested that PrP<sup>Sc</sup> specifically activated tPA without effect on uPA (Ellis et al.,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">2002</xref>; Epple et al.,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">2004</xref>). Despite this, there is evidence that tPA cannot degrade PrP<sup>Sc</sup> (Xanthopoulos et al.,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b74">2005</xref>). The role of plasminogen and tPA in prion disease is further clouded by divergent results when plasminogen deficient animals (plg&#x02212;/&#x02212;) were inoculated with prion disease: one study reports a very slight protection of plg&#x02212;/&#x02212; animals (Salmona et al.,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b53">2005</xref>), while the other reports that plasminogen deficiency prompts earlier symptoms and death (Xanthopoulos et al.,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b74">2005</xref>). These studies are both compromised by the adverse phenotype of the plasminogen knockout mouse, which shows poor health, retarded growth, and shortly after inoculation, becomes runted, listless, and cachectic (Salmona et al.,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b53">2005</xref>). With such an adverse phenotype attributing symptoms and/or death to prion disease rather than gene deficiency become problematic, perhaps reflected in the very large variability observed in the studies of Xanthopoulos et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b74">2005</xref>). Our current studies are suggestive of increases in both tPA and uPA, as shown by partial inhibition by both amiloride and tPA, and by the presence of both activities in zymographic analysis. In addition, the increased transcription of uPA is very prominent in this disease model given its very low constitutive expression. Whether uPA synthesis is a response to PrP<sup>Sc</sup> deposition, has a role in microglial migration/phagocytosis in concert with uPAR, or affects some other aspect of neuroprotection/neurodegeneration remains unclear but certainly merits further study.</p></sec><sec><title>The Influence of PAI-1</title><p>In models of Alzheimer's disease, both tPA and uPA have been reported to show increased expression (Tucker et al.,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b67">2000</xref>). However, tPA activity has been shown by <italic>in situ</italic> zymography to be decreased in AD models, and its activity is proposed to be controlled by the substantial increases in PAI-1 (Melchor et al.,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b45">2003</xref>). We also observed PAI-1 elevation in prion disease but despite its probable presence in the soluble assay, we still observe considerable increases in plasmin activation (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig03">3</xref>a). This raises an interesting point about PAI-1 expression. In the current studies, we have observed clear increases in plasmin activity in both ME7- and KA-treated animals, but decreased activity in LPS-treated animals. LPS produced the most marked transcriptional increase in PAI-1, suggesting that PAI-1 expression may be the ultimate determinant of <italic>in vivo</italic> plasmin activity. IL-1&#x003b2;, TNF-&#x003b1;, and TGF&#x003b2;1 have all been shown to induce PAI-1 robustly and to bring about decreased plasminogen activation (Faber-Elman et al.,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">1995</xref>), and it is well known that LPS i.c. challenges induce all these cytokines in the mouse brain (Boche et al.,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">2003</xref>). Because tPA contributes to neuronal death during excitotoxicity and uPA to ischemic and cytokine-induced neurotoxicity (Rosenberg et al.,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b52">1996</xref>; Thornton et al.,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b63">2008</xref>) suppression of these activities during LPS challenges may be one major reason why this robust inflammatory stimulus is not overtly neurotoxic. Likewise, the dominance of tPA/uPA over their inhibitors in prion disease may have a beneficial effect, in clearing PrP<sup>Sc</sup>, or a deleterious effect in causing bystander proteolytic damage. Furthermore, the balance of PAI-1 and tPA/uPA from a neuroanatomical point of view may be key in this regard. Preliminary <italic>in situ</italic> zymography data suggest that both plasminogen activator activities are present in the hippocampus (not shown), but considerably more work is required to clarify this. Nonetheless, specific targeting of uPA and/or PAI-1 may produce interesting effects in the ME7 model of prion disease, irrespective of previous manipulations of tPA.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>A number of clinical studies have shown that uPAR is elevated in the CSF of patients with a variety of CNS degenerative and/or inflammatory diseases. These clinical studies have not been matched by similar basic research efforts to understand the involvement of uPAR in these inflammatory situations. This study suggests that uPAR may be involved in a very wide variety of inflammatory and pathological situations in the brain and systematic studies of its role and that of uPA may contribute significantly to our understanding of many of these conditions and to a greater understanding of microglial biology.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors thank the Company of Biologists for a travel grant awarded to OC and Prof Dylan Edwards for primer and probe sequences for uPA and uPAR.
