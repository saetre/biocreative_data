Rip2<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice infected with <italic>C. pneumoniae</italic> exhibited impaired iNOS expression and NO production, and delayed neutrophil recruitment to the lungs. Levels of IL-6 and IFN-&#x003b3; levels as well as KC and MIP-2 levels in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) were significantly decreased in Rip2<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice compared to wild-type (WT) mice at day 3. Rip2<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice showed significant delay in bacterial clearance from the lungs and developed more severe and chronic lung inflammation that continued even on day 35 and led to increased mortality, whereas WT mice cleared the bacterial load, recovered from acute pneumonia, and survived. Both Nod1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> and Nod2<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice also showed delayed bacterial clearance, suggesting that <italic>C. pneumoniae</italic> is recognized by both of these intracellular receptors. Bone marrow chimera experiments demonstrated that Rip2 in BM-derived cells rather than non-hematopoietic stromal cells played a key role in host responses in the lungs and clearance of <italic>C. pneumoniae</italic>. Furthermore, adoptive transfer of WT macrophages intratracheally was able to rescue the bacterial clearance defect in Rip2<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice. These results demonstrate that in addition to the TLR/MyD88 pathway, the Nod/Rip2 signaling pathway also plays a significant role in intracellular recognition, innate immune host responses, and ultimately has a decisive impact on clearance of <italic>C. pneumoniae</italic> from the lungs and survival of the infectious challenge.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><p><italic>Chlamydophila pneumoniae</italic> (<italic>C. pneumoniae</italic>) is a common intracellular parasite that causes lung infections and contributes to several diseases characterized by chronic inflammation. Toll-like receptors expressed on the cell surface detect <italic>C. pneumoniae</italic> and mount a vigorous defense, but it is not known how the cell defends itself once the pathogen has taken up residence as a parasite. We reasoned that cytosolic pattern recognition receptors called Nods (nucleotide oligomerization domain) that detect microbes that gain entry into the cell might be involved. Using mice genetically deficient in Nod1 and Nod2 or their common downstream adaptor (Rip2), we show that in lung infection, Nod proteins are indeed essential in directing a defense against <italic>C. pneumoniae</italic>. Mice with defective Nod/Rip2-dependent signaling exhibited delayed recruitment of neutrophils, blunted production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, and evidence of defective iNOS expression and NO production. These impaired responses led to delayed clearance of bacteria, intense persistent lung inflammation, and increased mortality. By performing bone marrow transplantation experiments and direct transfer of cells into the lungs of mice, we demonstrated that intact Nod-dependent signaling in bone marrow&#x02013;derived cells was critical in the defense against <italic>C. pneumoniae</italic>. Our results indicate that Nod proteins also play an important role in host defense against <italic>C. pneumoniae</italic>. Coordinated and sequential activation of TLR and Nod signaling pathways may be necessary for an efficient immune response and host defense against <italic>C. pneumoniae</italic>.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="13"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p><italic>Chlamydophila pneumoniae</italic> is a Gram-negative obligate intracellular pathogen that is widely prevalent <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000379-Karvonen1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>, causes respiratory tract diseases such as pneumonia, sinusitis, and bronchitis, contributes to acceleration of atherosclerosis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000379-Campbell1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000379-Gupta1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>, and is associated with development of chronic lung diseases such as asthma <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000379-Hansbro1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref> and other disorders where chronic inflammation is a hallmark feature <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000379-Belland1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000379-Kuo1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>. <italic>C. pneumoniae</italic> infects various cell types such as epithelial cells, monocytes, macrophages, smooth-muscle cells and endothelial cells, and often resides intracellularly for indefinite periods <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000379-Hammerschlag1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p><italic>C. pneumoniae</italic> induces a similar lung pathology in humans and rodents <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000379-Yang1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>.

Delayed neutrophil recruitment in Rip2<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice appears closely linked to lack of sufficient chemokine and cytokine expression compared to infected WT mice. However, by days 5 and 14 post-infection, the percentage of neutrophils in the lungs of Rip2<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice increased and significantly exceeded those in WT mice. Evidently, this delayed early response to the infectious challenge allows the bacteria to gain the upper hand, but despite the significant increase in PMN numbers on days 5 and 14 post-infection, the Rip2<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice showed delayed bacterial clearance from the lungs and increased mortality.
