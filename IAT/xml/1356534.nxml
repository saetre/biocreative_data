Evidence suggests that the Werner syndrome protein (WRN) contributes to the maintenance of genome integrity through its involvement in DNA repair. In particular, biochemical evidence indicates a role for WRN in base excision repair (BER). We have previously reported that WRN helicase activity stimulates DNA polymerase beta (pol &#x003b2;) strand displacement synthesis <italic>in vitro</italic>. In this report we demonstrate that WRN exonuclease activity can act cooperatively with pol &#x003b2;, a polymerase lacking 3&#x02032;&#x02013;5&#x02032; proofreading activity. Furthermore, using small interference RNA technology, we demonstrate that WRN knockdown cells are hypersensitive to the alkylating agent methyl methanesulfonate, which creates DNA damage that is primarily repaired by the BER pathway. In addition, repair assays using whole cell extracts from WRN knockdown cells indicate a defect in long patch (LP) BER. These findings demonstrate that WRN plays a direct role in the repair of methylation-induced DNA damage, and suggest a role for both WRN helicase and exonuclease activities together with pol &#x003b2; during LP BER.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>One of the major theories of aging proposes that the phenotypical changes associated with age are due to the accumulation of oxidatively induced DNA base lesions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>). Base excision repair (BER) is the cellular repair pathway responsible for the removal of these lesions and the restoration of normal DNA bases. BER is divided into two sub-pathways, in which one single nucleotide (SN) or greater than one (long patch (LP)) nucleotide is incorporated during the repair process. The major proteins involved in SN BER include DNA glycosylases, apurinic/apyrimidinic endonuclease 1 (APE1), DNA polymerase &#x003b2; (pol &#x003b2;) and DNA ligase. Notably, pol &#x003b2; lacks 3&#x02032;&#x02013;5&#x02032; proofreading activity, making it susceptible to incorporation errors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>), and mismatched bases have been shown to impede further nucleotide incorporation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>) and the ligation step (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>). LP BER involves several additional proteins, including flap endonuclease 1 (FEN-1) and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase 1 (PARP-1), among others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>).</p><p>Werner syndrome (WS) is a segmental progeroid syndrome in which patients appear much older than their chronological age and display many clinical features resembling those of normal aging. The protein defective in WS (WRN) is a member of the RecQ family of DNA helicases, and possesses 3&#x02032;&#x02013;5&#x02032; exonuclease activity in addition to 3&#x02032;&#x02013;5&#x02032; helicase activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>). Neither the yeast or bacterial RecQ helicases possess exonuclease activity, thus making the dual catalytic activities of WRN quite unique. The N-terminal exonuclease domain of WRN shows homology to the proofreading domain of <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> DNA polymerase I (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>) and WRN has a proposed role as an autonomous proofreading enzyme (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>). Furthermore, WRN is able to degrade DNA substrates containing a 3&#x02032; G:T mismatch (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>).</p><p>We have previously shown that WRN interacts with pol &#x003b2; and stimulates pol &#x003b2; strand displacement DNA synthesis via its helicase activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>). In this report we investigated a role for WRN exonuclease activity on 3&#x02032; mismatches in cooperation with pol &#x003b2; <italic>in vitro</italic> and a cellular role for WRN in BER <italic>in vivo</italic>. We found that WRN exonuclease and helicase activities cooperated with pol &#x003b2; on BER intermediates containing 3&#x02032; mismatched substrates. In addition, using cell lines stably expressing small interfering RNAs (siRNA) against WRN, we found that WRN knockdown (WRN KD) cells display increased sensitivity to the methylating agent methyl methanesulfonate (MMS). Furthermore, extracts from WRN KD cells displayed reduced LP BER. These results demonstrate that WRN participates in BER <italic>in vivo</italic> and likely promotes the efficiency of pol &#x003b2;-mediated BER via its helicase and exonuclease activities.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec sec-type="materials"><title>Materials</title><p>Synthetic oligodeoxyribonucleotides were purchased from Midland Certified Reagent Co.

To further investigate the biochemical mechanism for WRN's role in promoting BER, we next tested for the possible contribution of the WRN exonuclease in pol &#x003b2;-directed BER. Given that pol &#x003b2; lacks proofreading activity, we hypothesized that the WRN exonuclease may cooperate with pol &#x003b2; to correct misincorporated bases. Therefore, using a variety of 3&#x02032; mismatched substrates including purine:purine, purine:pyrimidine and pyrimidine:pyrimidine pairs, we first tested the ability of WRN to excise 3&#x02032; mismatches in the context of a primer/template. The helicase is inactive on this substrate, allowing us to examine the contribution of the WRN exonuclease on pol &#x003b2; DNA synthesis. WRN excised cytosine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, lanes 2 and 3), guanine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, lanes 8 and 9) and adenine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, lanes 11 and 12) when paired opposite guanine, but poorly excised thymine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, lanes 5 and 6). The specific activity of the WRN exonuclease on these 3&#x02032; recessed substrates opposite G was C &#x0003e; A &#x02248; G &#x0003e; T (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref>). On 3&#x02032; recessed substrates containing correctly or mispaired bases opposite cytosine, the WRN exonuclease was active on all four substrates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). In this case, the WRN exonuclease preferred an A:C mispair, with A &#x0003e; G &#x02248; T &#x02248; C (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref>). Given the ability of WRN to efficiently excise 3&#x02032; mismatches, we examined for cooperativity with pol &#x003b2;, since a mismatched primer terminus is a poor substrate for pol &#x003b2; primer extension (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>). WRN excised a G:G mispair, resulting in a predominately 14 nt product (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, left panel, lane 2). We observed limited extension by pol &#x003b2; alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, left panel, lane 3), however, the presence of WRN resulted in a 15-fold increase in the percent of products extended by pol &#x003b2; (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, left panel, lane 4). Similarly, on a recessed substrate containing a 3&#x02032; C:C mispair, WRN was able to excise the mismatch (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, middle panel, lane 2) allowing for incorporation by pol &#x003b2; (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, middle panel, lane 4). WRN increased the percent of extended products 10-fold (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, middle panel, lane 4) compared to pol &#x003b2; alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, middle panel, lane 3). As expected, on a recessed substrate with correctly paired 3&#x02032; termini, pol &#x003b2; extension was similar in the absence or presence of WRN (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, right panel, lanes 3 and 4). These results suggest that the WRN exonuclease has the capability to excise mismatches following misincorporation of nucleotides by pol &#x003b2;.</p><p>Based on our findings that the WRN exonuclease removed several 3&#x02032; mismatches in the context of a recessed DNA substrate, we next wanted to determine whether the WRN helicase could unwind gap substrates containing a 3&#x02032; mismatch. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, WRN was able to displace the downstream oligonucleotide from substrates with either correctly paired nucleotides (lane 2) or G:G (lane 4) and A:G (lane 6) mismatches. The gapped substrates unwound by WRN migrated to the same position as a recessed substrate, which was used as a marker (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, lane 7). Following our observations that WRN unwound from a gap containing a 3&#x02032; mismatch, we next evaluated both exonuclease and helicase activities of WRN on the same substrates, with and without pol &#x003b2;. We found that similar to the recessed substrates, WRN was able to degrade from gapped substrates containing correctly paired 3&#x02032; termini (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, lanes 2 and 4) or A:G mispairs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, lanes 6 and 8). In addition, pol &#x003b2; incorporated predominantly 1 nt (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, lanes 3 and 7). However, the presence of WRN resulted in a stimulation of pol &#x003b2; strand displacement synthesis and longer products (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, lanes 4 and 8). These results demonstrate that both WRN helicase and exonuclease activities can potentially function together on BER strand break intermediates containing correct or mispaired 3&#x02032; termini.</p><p>Based on our <italic>in vitro</italic> data that WRN helicase and exonuclease activities cooperate with pol &#x003b2; on BER intermediates, we next focused on whether WRN participates with pol &#x003b2; <italic>in vivo</italic> during BER. We therefore generated stable cell lines containing either an siRNA targeting WRN mRNA (WRN KD) or an siRNA negative control (WT) with a sequence that has no significant similarity to human genes (see Materials and Methods). We determined by real-time RT&#x02013;PCR that WRN mRNA levels were decreased 3-fold in WRN KD cells compared to WT cells (data not shown). In addition, the WRN KD cells contained undetectable levels of WRN protein compared to WT cells, while levels of actin were similar between the two cell lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). The reduction in WRN levels in the stable cell lines was maintained even after 20 passages (data not shown). Furthermore, while WRN protein levels were significantly reduced in the KD cells, pol &#x003b2; levels were not affected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). To confirm that the WRN KD cells behaved similar to WS cells, we measured cellular survival by colony formation following treatment with mitomycin C (MMC) or camptothecin (CPT). WRN KD cells were more sensitive to both MMC and CPT (data not shown). Similar results were also observed following treatment of WT and WRN KD cells with MMC or CPT and measurement of cellular proliferation using 3-(4,5-dimethyl-2-thiazolyl)-2,5-diphenyl-2H-tetrazolium bromide (MTT, data not shown). These results are consistent with previously published reports demonstrating that cells lacking the WRN protein display increased sensitivity to CPT and DNA cross-linking agents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>) In summary, these results demonstrate that the WRN KD cells have significantly reduced levels of WRN protein, and that knockdown of WRN confers sensitivity to DNA damaging agents similar to that of WS cells.</p><p>As pol &#x003b2;-mediated BER is important for the repair of alkylation-induced DNA base damage, we investigated the influence of WRN on cellular survival in the presence of the methylating agent MMS. MMS is a S<sub>N</sub>2 methylating agent and can generate 7-methylguanine, 3-methyladenine, 1-methyladenine and 3-methylcytosine lesions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>). Following incubation of cells with MMS, and measurement of cellular survival, we found that WRN KD cells were more sensitive to MMS compared to WT cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). The lethal dose at 37% (LD37) for WRN KD cells was 0.68 mM MMS and 1.15 mM MMS for WT cells. Therefore, the down-regulation of WRN resulted in a 1.7-fold increased sensitivity to MMS. We also investigated the sensitivity of WS fibroblasts to MMS. Similar to the results observed with WRN KD cells, we found that WS cells were hypersensitive to MMS compared to normal cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). The LD37 for WS and WT cells was 0.15 and 0.75 mM MMS, respectively. Thus, WS cells displayed a 5-fold higher sensitivity to MMS compared to WT cells. As MMS-mediated DNA damage is repaired, at least in part, by SN BER, these results suggest that WRN plays a role in SN BER. To investigate a role for WRN in LP BER of MMS-induced DNA lesions, we performed survival assays in the presence of MX. MX can react with the aldehydic C1&#x02032; atom of an abasic site rendering it refractory to &#x003b2;-elimination by pol &#x003b2; dRP lyase activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>), thus blocking SN BER. Incubation of WRN KD cells with MMS in the presence of MX resulted in decreased cellular survival compared to WT cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). WRN KD cells were 1.6-fold more sensitive to MMS in the presence of MX compared to WT cells, as determined by the LD37 (0.35 and 0.58 mM MMS for WRN KD and WT cells, respectively). Thus together, these results suggest that WRN is also important for the repair of MMS-induced DNA damage via both the SN and LP pathway of BER.</p><p>To further examine the contribution of WRN in BER, we developed a modified BER assay in which the first nucleotide incorporated was [<sup>32</sup>P]dCMP and the second incorporated by LP BER was a chain terminating ddNMP instead of a normal dNMP. This assay specifically examines pol &#x003b2;-mediated LP BER activity as ddNTPs can be utilized by pol &#x003b2;, but not by the replicative polymerases. In addition, since the substrate is a 35 bp oligonucleotide duplex, contributions by PCNA-dependent polymerases are excluded. Thus, the labeled <italic>in vitro</italic> BER products are the fully repaired and ligated 35mer SN BER product, the 16mer product representing a LP BER intermediate (2 nt incorporated), and the 15mer product (1 nt incorporated) representing either SN or LP BER intermediates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). Since the fate of the 15mer product could eventually be either SN or LP BER, quantification of this product was not included (see below). In the experiment shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>, the BER reaction was conducted with extracts from WT and WRN KD cells and the reaction products were analyzed after a 10 min incubation. The results indicated that the amount of the SN BER product in the WRN KD extract was slightly reduced (1.2-fold) compared with WT extract, and the LP BER (2 ntincorporated) product was reduced 2-fold (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>, compare lanes 1 and 2). A time-course of <italic>in vitro</italic> BER with WT and WRN KD extracts revealed that WRN KD extracts had reduced levels (&#x0223c;2-fold) of the LP BER intermediate (16mer) at each time point examined (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C and D</xref>). The quantitation of LP BER products is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref> and demonstrates a deficiency in LP BER in the WRN KD extracts compared with the WT extracts. While the experiment shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref> represents one of four similar assays, the average fold-decrease in the LP BER product (16mer), as a function of WRN down-regulation, is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>. Thus, our results demonstrate a role for WRN in cell extract-mediated LP BER.</p></sec><sec><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>In this study, we characterized WRN exonuclease activity on 3&#x02032; mismatches in cooperation with pol &#x003b2; and examined a cellular role for WRN in BER. We found that the WRN exonuclease removed 3&#x02032; mismatches in the context of recessed and gapped substrates. In addition, WRN and pol &#x003b2; acted cooperatively on BER intermediates containing 3&#x02032; mismatches. We also demonstrated that a down-regulation of WRN expression resulted in elevated cellular sensitivity to MMS and greatly reduced LP BER <italic>in vitro</italic> using whole cell extract assays. These findings provide further support that WRN participates in pol &#x003b2;-directed repair of DNA damage.</p><p>We have previously demonstrated a physical and functional interaction between WRN and pol &#x003b2; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>). Furthermore, we have recently shown that WRN unwinds several single-strand break BER intermediates, and that this unwinding activity is regulated by the presence of APE1 and pol &#x003b2; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>). As WRN also possesses 3&#x02032;&#x02013;5&#x02032; exonuclease activity, and pol &#x003b2; lacks proofreading activity, we examined in this report for cooperativity between WRN and pol &#x003b2; on 3&#x02032; mismatch-containing substrates. The WRN exonuclease degraded most of the 3&#x02032; mispairs examined, and in doing so, was able to promote incorporation by pol &#x003b2;. Furthermore, both WRN exonuclease and helicase activities operated together, and in cooperation with pol &#x003b2;, to facilitate processing of strand break intermediates. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, the primer strand was degraded by WRN, albeit to a lesser extent, even in the presence of ongoing DNA synthesis by pol &#x003b2;. This may indeed be reflective of an initial 3&#x02032; end processing by exonucleases, such as WRN, on certain DNA lesions <italic>in vivo</italic>, or alternatively, degradation of the 3&#x02032; termini may be limited by the cellular localization of WRN and/or the concentration of WRN relative to pol &#x003b2; at the site of the DNA damage. In a similar fashion, the 5&#x02032; termini may determine whether pol &#x003b2; inserts predominantly 1 nt, or strand displacement synthesis is required to facilitate repair. For example, if the 5&#x02032; dRP is oxidized and refractory to pol &#x003b2; dRP lyase activity, WRN helicase activity could stimulate pol &#x003b2; stand displacement synthesis <italic>in vivo</italic> and promote LP BER. In conclusion, while the WRN exonuclease did not preferentially excise 3&#x02032; mismatches, these findings coupled with our previous results suggest a model whereby the two catalytic activities of WRN may be important and may cooperate during pol &#x003b2;-directed BER.</p><p>As shown here for WRN, APE1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref>) and TREX1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref>) have also been found to excise nucleotides misincorporated by pol &#x003b2;. Thus, these proteins may provide redundant or compensatory editing activities for this error-prone polymerase. Which exonuclease is called upon <italic>in vivo</italic> may be dictated by the intracellular environment, protein&#x02013;protein interactions, DNA sequence, or the nucleotide mismatch. For example, we note that the mismatch least excised by WRN, T:G, is a preferred mismatch of APE1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref>). Cooperativity between WRN and pol &#x003b2; may also be important in certain sequence contexts, such as trinucleotide repeat sequences and guanine-rich regions, which form secondary structures such as hairpins and G4 quadruplexes. Expansion of triplet repeats by pol &#x003b2; has been shown to be due to its limited strand displacement activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref>), and WRN is efficient at catalyzing the unwinding of many alternate DNA structures including Holliday junctions, triple helices and G4 quadruplexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref>). In the event that pol &#x003b2; misincorporates a nucleotide, the WRN exonuclease could excise the mismatch. Thus, WRN may serve to facilitate strand displacement and enhance the fidelity of DNA repair via its combined helicase and exonuclease activities, particularly during LP repair synthesis.</p><p>As the understanding of LP BER is continually emerging, as is the number of proteins involved in this repair pathway, which specific protein or protein complex is called upon <italic>in vivo</italic> will likely be determined by the DNA damaging agent and the specific lesion generated. PARP-1 has been identified as a component of a BER protein complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>) and has been shown to stimulate LP BER in the presence of FEN-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>). In addition, it has recently been shown that FEN-1 stimulates LP BER <italic>in vitro</italic> by creating short 1 nt gap products which are favorable substrates for pol &#x003b2; gap-filling activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref>). WRN physically and functionally interacts with many of the proteins involved in LP BER, including pol &#x003b2;, PARP-1 and FEN-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">36</xref>), and in this report we demonstrate for the first time that extracts down-regulated for WRN protein expression are deficient in LP BER. This also represents the first reported association between a human disorder and a specific deficiency in LP BER.</p><p>We also demonstrate that both WS and WRN KD cells were hypersensitive to MMS. Consistent with our findings in human cells, Imamura <italic>et al</italic>. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">37</xref>) observed that WRN<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> chicken DT40 cells displayed elevated sensitivity to MMS. Furthermore, it was recently shown using antisense oligonucleotides that WRN KD cells were hypersensitive to the methylating agents methyl-lexitropsin and temozolomide compared to isogenic controls (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">38</xref>). Together these results suggest that WRN participates in the repair of methylation-induced DNA damage and thus confers cellular survival. This is most likely through a role of WRN in pol &#x003b2;-mediated BER.</p><p>In support of this conclusion, we found that extracts from WRN KD cells have reduced SN and LP BER activities <italic>in vitro</italic>, which are consistent with the <italic>in vivo</italic> cellular sensitivity assays. The observation that WRN KD cells were more sensitive to MMS in the presence of MX suggests that WRN participates in LP BER. Consistently, we observed a significant decrease in LP BER using WRN KD extracts <italic>in vitro</italic>. The sensitivity of WRN KD cells to MMS alone, compared to isogenic controls, indicates a role for WRN in SN BER. In addition, extracts from WRN KD cells had slightly lower SN BER of a uracil-containing substrate. The observation that the survival studies with MMS alone were more dramatic than the <italic>in vitro</italic> BER results may reflect an additional role for WRN in the processing of stalled replication forks and/or DNA double-strand break (DSB) repair. MMS-induced DNA damage can result in the stalling of replication forks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">40</xref>) and the formation of DSBs, as evidenced by the phosphorylation of histone H2AX (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">42</xref>). In addition, when cells lacking pol &#x003b2; are treated with MMS, unrepaired single-strand breaks are converted to DSBs during S phase, and become substrates for homologous recombination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b43">43</xref>). Thus, if WRN participates in the BER of MMS-induced DNA damage, as suggested by this study, the absence of WRN may lead to increased replication fork arrest and/or DSBs during replication. As WRN has also been shown to participate in DSB repair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b44">44</xref>), the decreased cellular survival of WRN KD cells observed here may also be due in part to WRN's role in DSB repair.</p><p>Recently Szekely <italic>et al</italic>. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b45">45</xref>) reported that the KD of WRN in primary human fibroblasts results in increased DNA damage following oxidative stress, particularly in non-dividing cells. As BER is important for the repair of both oxidation and alkylation-mediated DNA damage, our results presented here are consistent with their findings, and with a specific role for WRN in BER.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors thank Marit Otterlei and Julie Horton for helpful discussions.
