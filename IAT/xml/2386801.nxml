We have mapped an essential regulatory region between -513 to -352 bp which causes a drastic decline of reporter activity. This region contains CdxA, GATA2 and SRY transcription factor binding sites. Individual mutation of these three sites showed increase in reporter activity. Mutation in SRY site (-403/-368) showed maximum increase in reporter activity among these three sites. Therefore, we suggest that SRY like protein may be acting as a strong repressor of SMP30 gene along with CdxA and GATA-2. We also report that mutation of both Sp1 (172/-148 bp) and a C/EBP&#x003b2; (-190/-177 bp) transcription binding site located adjacent to each other on SMP30 gene promoter, causes a significant enhancement in reporter activity than individual mutation, thus may be causing the repression of SMP30 promoter activity.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>These studies provide novel insights into the mechanism that regulate SMP30 gene expression.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>Senescence marker protein-30 (SMP30), a 34 kDa protein, is preferentially expressed in hepatocytes and renal tubular epithelia. SMP30 is unique in that, its expression is maintained at a high level throughout the tissue maturation process, then decreases in an androgen-independent manner during senescent stages in both sexes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Analysis of murine genomic clone revealed that SMP30 is organized into seven exons and six introns spanning approximately 17.5 kb. The full length cDNA fragment (1.6 kb) contains an open reading frame of 897 bp encoding 299 amino acids. Cloned SMP30 promoter is approximately 3 kb in length and up to -1.5 kb of upstream promoter region has been sequenced [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. We have further sequenced upstream region -3001 to -1502 bp, and the sequence is available from the NCBI database under the accession number EU251064. SMP30 knockout mice though are viable and fertile have reduced body weight and life span. SMP30 deficiency in mice causes an accumulation of neural lipids and phospholipids in liver and shortens the life span [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. SMP30 plays an important role in maintaining calcium homeostasis as it blunts down cell death caused by intracellular accumulation of calcium by enhancing plasma membranes calcium pumping activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. It also plays a profound role in rescuing cells from cellular injuries such as apoptosis and hypoxia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. Besides, SMP30 functions as gluconolactonase in L-ascorbic acid biosynthesis, and its knockout mice are prone to scurvy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. Recently, we have also reported the alteration of SMP30 expression in hyperthyroidism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Considering the immense importance of SMP30 in aging and in general physiology of an organism, it is highly essential to understand the mechanism of SMP30 gene expression. Regulation of gene expression at transcriptional level is mediated by the interaction of trans-acting factors with <italic>cis</italic>-acting DNA sequences on the promoter region of the genes. Thus, the cross-talk between trans-acting regulatory factors and <italic>cis</italic>-acting regulatory elements may be important for regulation of SMP30 gene expression. The identification of <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory elements are therefore central and detailed analyses of <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory mechanisms controlling critical transcription factor will be required in order to understand the transcriptional regulation of SMP30 gene. Previously, we reported DNase I footprinting on SMP30 promoter up to -800 bp upstream of the transcription start site and identified eight nuclear factor DNA binding sites in this region excluding -513 to -352 bp [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. The aim of the present study is to characterize and decipher the mechanism of SMP30 gene expression and regulation. In elucidating the mechanism that endow potent and regulated expression of SMP30, detailed characterization of the promoter is highly desirable. To characterize SMP30 promoter we carried out DNA-protein interaction study by DNase I footprinting studies from -800 bp to -2750 bp and electrophoretic mobility shift assay. In this region about twenty eight putative transcription factor binding sites have been identified of which ten transcription factor binding sites were confirmed by competitive EMSA. Further, to access the transcriptional mechanism of SMP30 gene expression and regulation, we have carried out for the first time 5' and 3' serial deletion of SMP30 promoter and subsequently cloned into luciferase reporter vector. Transient transfection and luciferase assay illustrated the region of SMP30 promoter between -128/+157 bp (Luc-6), having significant promoter activity. Progressive deletion study confirmed the presence of a repressor element between -513 bp to -352 bp. DNase I footprinting assay was carried out to chalk out the repressor elements, which revealed the presence of three DNase I protected sites. Analysis of these sequences with TFSEARCH showed the binding of CdxA, GATA2 and SRY transcription factors. Transient transfection of individual site-directed mutated constructs into RAG cells and luciferase assay showed an increase in reporter activity for all the three mutated constructs.</p><p>Since mutation of SRY region (-403/-368) showed maximum reporter activity, we suggest SRY along with CdxA and GATA-2 may be acting as a major negative regulator of this gene. Binding of SRY, GATA-2 and CdxA to their respective sites were confirmed by competitive EMSA. Another interesting feature of SMP30 gene promoter is location of Sp1 and C/EBP&#x003b2; transcription factor binding sites adjacent to each other. Here, we also report that though the presence of these two transcription factor binding sites to minimal promoter region (Luc-5) did not show any significant change in reporter activity as compared to Luc-6, but mutation of both the transcription factor binding site enhanced the reporter activity significantly by 23%. This suggests either direct or indirect interaction between Sp1 and C/EBP&#x003b2; occurs at transcriptional level in presence of other regulatory factor in SMP30 promoter which causes repression in SMP30 gene promoter activity.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Identification of DNase I protected sites on SMP30 promoter</title><p>We have previously identified eight transcription factor binding sites within 0.8 kb mouse SMP30 promoter fragment by DNase I footprinting and EMSA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>].

(EMSA)</title><p>All the DNase I protected sequences were analyzed in transcription factor data base (TFSEARCH, Japan) which revealed binding sites sequence homology to multiple transcription factors. To demonstrate the specificity of transcription factors binding sites to the DNase I protected regions, we carried out EMSA and/or supershift assay. We synthesized oligonucleotides (both strands) corresponding to the protected sites (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref>) and prepared radiolabeled duplexes for EMSA studies. Five DNase I protected sites were identified in the region -1208/-777 bp of which FP 4 and FP 5 have been confirmed by EMSA (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>). To FP 4 site binding of C/EBP&#x003b2; was confirmed by competition with cold C/EBP oligonucleotide and also by C/EBP&#x003b2; antibody shift experiments. Binding of GATA-1 to FP 5 is confirmed by competition experiments. Four DNase I protected sites were detected in the region -1491/-1205 bp. Though TFSEARCH revealed the binding GATA-3, GATA-1, GATA-2 and AML-1a in order of decreasing binding affinity, only AML-1a competed with FP 6 site (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>). Similarly TFSEARCH revealed the binding of Lyf-1 and GATA-1 to FP8, only cold GATA-1 oligonucleotide competed with FP 8 but not Lyf-1 thus confirming the binding of GATA-1 to FP8 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>). Three DNase I protected sites were detected in -2028/-1626 bp region.

To pin point the transcription factor which act as a repressor we prepared site directed mutated constructs for all the three sites. Transient transfection of these mutated constructs was carried out along with wild type Luc 3 (-513/+157) (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F13">13</xref>).

This result revealed SRY, CdxA and GATA-2 as the major repressor elements. To further establish this fact, we did EMSA study using both wild type and mutated oligonucleotide of Luc3-3 site. The wild type Luc3-3 oligonucleotide competed with SRY specific cold oligonucleotide consensus, but mutated 3&#x02013;3 site did not show any binding, thus establishing the binding of SRY to this site (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F14">14</xref>).

Here we report that, presence of these two sites in the minimal promoter region did not cause any significant change in reporter activity (that is, there is no significant change in Luc-5 as compared to Luc-6). But site-directed mutation of both the transcription factor binding site caused a significant increase in reporter activity (~23%) (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5A</xref>). Individual mutation of only Sp1 and C/EBP&#x003b2; did not contribute to any significant change in reporter activity. Mutation of Sp1 site reduced the reporter activity by only 16% and mutation of C/EBP&#x003b2; lead to enhancement of reporter activity by only 14% (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F16">16</xref>).

It is suggested that the transcriptional regulation of a particular gene is a complex process which usually involves interaction between multiple <italic>cis</italic>-acting regulatory elements and their cognate protein factors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. A growing list of transcription factors has been shown to function as either transcriptional activator or repressor in different gene promoter. In this study we analyzed the transcriptional regulation of SMP30 gene by DNase I footprinting, EMSA and functional characterization by transient transfection, reporter assay of 5' and 3' -serially deleted promoter reporter constructs and site-directed mutagenesis. We have earlier reported eight nuclear factor binding sites on SMP30 gene promoter [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. In this report twenty eight new DNase I footprinting sites were identified using rat liver nuclear extract. We also demonstrate that the 5' -flanking regions of SMP30 gene possess a functional promoter when transfected into RAG cells. The results of 5' and 3' -deletion analysis illustrated the region -128/+157 bp possesses significant reporter activity. The presence of a TATA sequence (-29 ATAAAA -25) and a CAAT box (-72 CCAAT -68) were previously reported respective to the transcription start site [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Our results suggest that the TATA and CAAT box located between -128 bp and +157 bp plays an important role in determining the promoter activity and sufficient to drive SMP30 gene expression. 3' &#x02013; deletion from +157 bp to +104 bp resulted in ~28% decrease in basal promoter activity, thus indicating that this region is essential for SMP30 gene expression. An interesting feature of SMP30 promoter is the presence of C/EBP&#x003b2; binding site adjacent to Sp1 binding site. Sp1 is a ubiquitous DNA-binding protein with three zinc finger at its C-terminal that activates the transcription of many cellular and viral genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. SMP30 promoter possess a Sp1 binding site between -172 bp to -148 bp. C/EBP&#x003b2; belongs to CCAAT-enhancer-binding protein family of transcription factors, involved in different cellular response like in control of cellular proliferation, growth and differentiation, metabolism, immune response and many others. C/EBP&#x003b2; binding site spans between -190 bp to -177 bp on SMP30 promoter. This spatial arrangement of C/EBP&#x003b2; and Sp1 is critical as Sp1 is known to recruit C/EBP&#x003b2; to cryptic C/EBP site [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. Presence of these two sites in the minimal promoter region represented as Luc-5 did not show any significant change in luciferase activity as compared to the Luc-6, but mutation of both Sp1 and C/EBP&#x003b2; significantly enhanced the reporter gene activity to about 23%. Thus, it is reasonable to believe that direct or indirect interaction between Sp1 and C/EBP&#x003b2; in presence of some other regulatory factor occurs at transcriptional level in SMP30 promoter which causes a repression in SMP30 promoter activity. Transient transfection of 5' -deletion fragments revealed the presence of a repressor element between -513 to -352 bp, as deletion of this region caused 41% decrease in reporter activity. Our DNase I footprinting study showed three putative transcription factor binding sites within this region (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F12">12</xref>). In order to confirm the potential repressor among these DNase I protected sites, we carried out site directed mutagenesis studies of these three sites and subsequent transfection along with wild type (Luc-3). This result suggested a significant enhancement of reporter activity of Luc 3&#x02013;3 mutated fragment by ~59%, Luc3-2 by 27% and Luc 3&#x02013;1 by 29%. (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F13">13</xref>). TFSEARCH indicated the binding of SRY to wild type site Luc 3&#x02013;3, GATA-2 to Luc 3&#x02013;2 and CdxA to Luc 3&#x02013;1 sequences, which is confirmed by competitive EMSA. Earlier reports depicted the tissue specific expression of SRY in testes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>] where it involve in testes determination and differentiation in mammals. Though expression of SRY in substantia nigra of adult male rodents in tyrosin hydroxylase expressing neurons has also been reported but its expression in liver and kidney is still obscure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. So the identified transcription factors might be SRY like proteins which bind to a similar binding site as SRY. The affinity of SRY for double-stranded DNA varies with DNA sequence and shares a conserved DNA binding domain (HMG-box) NACAAT [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. SRY is reported to bind and negatively regulates the androgen receptor gene promoter [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. We also suggest that GATA-2 and CdxA might be interacting directly or indirectly with SRY to bring about repression of SMP30 gene.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Transcription factors Sp1, C/EBP&#x003b2;, SRY, GATA-2 and CdxA, binding within -513 of SMP30 promoter, have significant role in regulation of SMP30 gene expression.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Preparation of nuclear extract</title><p>Nuclear extract from liver of adult (5 months) male rats (Fisher 344) were prepared as described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>].

The PCR amplification was carried out using step cycles (94&#x000b0;C for 30 s, 62&#x000b0;C for 30 s, 72&#x000b0;C for 30 s) for 35 cycles with a final extension at 72&#x000b0;C for 10 minutes. Then the PCR products were purified using QIAquick Gel Extraction Kit (Qiagen, USA). The serially deleted fragments and pGL3-Basic vector were digested with KpnI and XhoI enzyme (MBI Fermentas). The digested 5' -serially deleted fragments were then ligated into restriction enzyme digested pGL3-Basic vector using DNA ligase (USB, USA). The cloned fragments were then confirmed by vector specific PCR using RV and GL2 primer, and also by sequencing.</p></sec><sec><title>Site-directed mutagenesis</title><p>Five to six bases of the transcription factor core binding site were mutated as shown in the table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T5">5</xref> (bases in small letter represents mutated base). For mutagenesis of transcription factors two sets of PCR were carried out using the following combination of primers: For Sp1: MutSp1 sense/Luc-SMP-XhoI antisense and Luc 5 sense/Mut Sp1 antisense; for C/EBP: Mut C/EBP sense/Luc-SMP-XhoI antisense and Luc 5 sense/Mut C/EBP antisense; for Mut Luc 3&#x02013;1: Mut Luc3-1 sense/Luc-SMP-XhoI antisense and Luc-SMP-3 sense/Mut Luc 3&#x02013;1 antisense; for Mut Luc 3&#x02013;2: Mut Luc 3&#x02013;2 sense/Luc-SMP-XhoI antisense and Luc-3 sense/Mut Luc 3&#x02013;2 antisense; for Mut Luc 3&#x02013;3: Mut Luc 3&#x02013;3 sense/Luc-SMP-XhoI antisense and Luc-SMP-3 sense/Mut Luc 3&#x02013;3 antisense. The PCR amplification was performed using step cycles (94&#x000b0;C for 1 min, 62&#x000b0;C for 30 s, 72&#x000b0;C 30 s) for 35 cycles with a final extension at 72&#x000b0;C for 10 minutes. Both the PCR products were purified using QIAquick Gel Extraction Kit. DNA was eluted using 30 &#x003bc;l of autoclaved deionised water. 5 &#x003bc;l of each PCR product was used as a template for the second round of PCR. For example: for construction of mutant Sp1 site: 5&#x003bc;l each of the PCR product Mut Sp1 sense/Luc-SMP-XhoI antisense and Luc-5 sense/Mut Sp1 antisense was used as template. For construction of mutant Sp1 and mutant C/EBP, Luc-5 and Luc-SMP-XhoI was used as forward and reverse primers. For construction of mutant Luc 3&#x02013;1, Luc 3&#x02013;2 and Luc 3&#x02013;3, Luc-3 and Luc-SMP-XhoI was used as forward and reverse primers. PCR amplification was carried out using the same parameters as mentioned above. Then the PCR products were purified using QIAquick Gel Extraction Kit. The fragments with mutated transcription factor binding sites, having KpnI and XhoI restriction sites and pGL3-Basic vector were digested with KpnI and XhoI enzyme. The fragments were then ligated into restriction enzyme digested pGL3-Basic vector using DNA ligase. The cloned fragments were then confirmed by vector specific PCR using RV and GL2 primer, and the mutation was confirmed by sequencing.</p></sec><sec><title>Transient transfection and luciferase assay</title><p>Transient transfections were carried out using RAG cells (mouse renal adenocarcinoma cell line) as SMP30 is also expressed in kidney. The cells were plated at a density of 2 &#x000d7; 10<sup>5 </sup>cells per well in six well plates, 18 h before transfection. For transient transfection 2 &#x003bc;g of respective reporter plasmid DNA and 0.5 &#x003bc;g of pSV-&#x003b2;-gal control vector (Promega, USA) or 100 ng of pRL-TK control vector were cotransfected into cells using FuGENE reagent (Roche, USA). After 24 h post transfection, the cells were harvested, lysed, centrifuged and the lysate was used for luciferase assay using the luciferase assay system (Promega, USA). The colorimetric &#x003b2;-galactosidase assay was performed using &#x003b2;-Gal assay kit (Invitrogen, USA) and luciferase activity was divided by the &#x003b2;-galactosidase activity to normalize for transfection efficiency. For transfection of mutated constructs Renella was used as an internal control and dual luciferase assay was preformed to measure the luciferase reading as per manufacturer's instruction (Promega, USA). All the transfections were repeated in duplicates in three to five independent experiments. The number of independent experiments is being mentioned in respective figure legends.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Abbreviations</title><p>SMP30: Senescence Marker Protein 30; EMSA: Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay; RLNE: Rat Liver Nuclear Extract.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>PCS and NM conceived the idea, designed and planned the experiments.
