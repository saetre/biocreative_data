Affected individuals prematurely develop many, but not all, of the pathologies associated with old age. The clinical manifestations of WS include atherosclerosis, bilateral ocular cataracts, type II diabetes, hyperlipidemia, gonadal atrophy, osteoporosis and various types of benign and malignant neoplasms, in addition to an aged appearance. WS patients develop these age-related disorders two or three decades earlier than normal subjects and eventually succumb to either cardiovascular disease or cancer at an average age of 45 years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd385c2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd385c3">3</xref>).</p><p>Cells from individuals with WS have a short replicative life span and long S phase compared to cells from age-matched controls (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd385c4">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd385c6">6</xref>). In addition, the senescent phenotype of WS cells differs in selected ways from that of normal cells. WS cells senesce with longer than normal telomeres (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd385c7">7</xref>), and show robust c-fos inducibility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd385c8">8</xref>), which does not occur in normal cells. WS cells undergo chromosome rearrangements with a relatively high frequency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd385c9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd385c10">10</xref>), display elevated rates of homologous recombination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd385c11">11</xref>) and are highly sensitive to the DNA damaging agent 4-nitroquinoline-1-oxide (4NQO) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd385c12">12</xref>). These cellular phenotypes suggest that mutations in the WS locus lead to defects in one or more aspect of DNA metabolism.</p><p>The gene defective in WS, <italic>WRN</italic>, encodes a large protein with a central region that is highly homologous to the <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> RECQ helicase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd385c13">13</xref>). Consistent with this homology, the WRN protein was shown to have DNA helicase activity <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd385c14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd385c15">15</xref>). WRN is now known to belong to a multigene family of RECQ-like helicases, at least three of which (<italic>WRN</italic>, <italic>BLM</italic> and <italic>RECQL4</italic>) are associated with hereditary disorders in humans. Mutations in <italic>BLM</italic> and <italic>RECQL4</italic> lead to phenotypes that differ in several ways from WS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd385c16">16</xref>). The diverse phenotypes caused by defects in different <italic>RECQ</italic>-like genes may be partly due to different expression patterns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd385c17">17</xref>). In addition, each RECQ-like helicase may have a distinct substrate specificity, interact with different regulatory proteins and&#x0002f;or contain other yet uncharacterized functions. This last possibility is supported by the identification of a motif in <italic>WRN</italic>, but not the other <italic>RECQ</italic>-like genes, that is present in many 3&#x02032;&#x02192;5&#x02032; exonucleases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd385c18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd385c19">19</xref>). Recently, we and others showed that WRN is indeed a 3&#x02032;&#x02192;5&#x02032; exonuclease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd385c20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd385c21">21</xref>). Here, we further characterize the WRN exonuclease. We show that both human and mouse WRN (hWRN and mWRN, respectively) are 3&#x02032;&#x02192;5&#x02032; exonucleases with similar substrate specificities. Both proteins prefer double-stranded DNA with a 3&#x02032; recessed end, can degrade DNA from a gap or nick, and efficiently remove a terminal mismatched nucleotide. In addition, we show that WRN forms a trimer <italic>in vitro</italic>, and confirm the finding that WRN interacts with the proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA). These findings suggest that WRN may play a unique role in DNA transactions, distinct from those of the other human RECQ-like proteins.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Materials</title><p>The baculovirus expression vector pFastBacHT, recombinant baculovirus generation kit and Sf9 insect cells were obtained from Gibco BRL (Gaithersburg, MD).

The exonuclease mutant hWRN-N333E84A showed no such activity on either 5&#x02032; or 3&#x02032; labeled substrates. The fastest migrating product in reactions with the 5&#x02032; labeled substrate was due to a small amount of contaminating 5&#x02032;&#x02192;3&#x02032; activity from the insect cells; this product was also observed in reactions using the exonuclease mutant hWRN-N333E84A (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd385f3">3</xref>B), and identically purified proteins from cells infected with a control virus (containing no WRN sequences) (data not shown). These data indicate that both the hWRN and mWRN proteins are 3&#x02032;&#x02192;5&#x02032; exonucleases.</p></sec><sec><title>hWRN and mWRN exonucleases display similar substrate specificities</title><p>The hWRN and mWRN exonucleases were assayed using 18 different substrates (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd385f4">4</xref>). Both exonucleases greatly preferred double-stranded DNA with a 5&#x02032; overhang over blunt-ended DNA, double-stranded DNA with a 3&#x02032; overhang, or single-stranded DNA (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd385f4">4</xref>A and C, substrates 1&#x02013;4). Interestingly, the exonucleases also acted on double-stranded DNA containing a gap or nick (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd385f4">4</xref>A and C, substrates 5&#x02013;8). Both proteins were as active on nicked or gapped substrates as on DNA duplexes with a 5&#x02032; overhang. Introduction of a single mismatch at the 3&#x02032; terminus, or at the 3&#x02032; end of a nick had little effect on hWRN or mWRN exonuclease activities. Both exonucleases efficiently removed one terminal mismatched nucleotide (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd385f4">4</xref>B and D, compare activity on substrates 10 and 11 to that on substrate 9). However, as the number of terminal mismatches increased, activity decreased (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd385f4">4</xref>B and D, substrate 12). When the number of terminal mismatched nucleotides was increased to six, essentially no activity was detected for both the human (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd385f4">4</xref>B, substrate 13) and mouse proteins (data not shown).</p><p>hWRN-N333 displayed no endonuclease activity. When tested on double-stranded DNA with blunt ends or a 3&#x02032; overhang, or single-stranded DNA, it did not cleave at internal sites (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd385f4">4</xref>, substrates 1, 3, 4 and 15). Furthermore, when tested on blunt-ended double-stranded DNA containing one or four internal mismatches, no endonuclease activity was detected (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd385f4">4</xref>, substrates 16 and 17). Similar results were obtained with mWRN-N328 (not shown). Finally, WRN was capable of degrading a DNA&#x02013;RNA hybrid. Both hWRN-N333 and mWRN-N328 degraded the DNA strand of a DNA&#x02013;RNA duplex containing recessed 3&#x02032; and 5&#x02032; ends (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd385f4">4</xref>F). The fastest migrating degradation product in all the lanes, but most evident in those containing the DNA&#x02013;RNA substrate (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd385f4">4</xref>F), is likely due to a contaminating 5&#x02032;&#x02192;3&#x02032; exonuclease, because it is produced independent of the WRN exonuclease (hNE84A mutant lane). This minor contaminant, which we have noted previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd385c20">20</xref>), appears to be much more active on the DNA&#x02013;RNA substrate relative to the other substrates.</p></sec><sec><title>hWRN forms a trimer <italic>in vitro</italic></title><p>To determine the quaternary structure of WRN, we employed gel filtration chromatography of the recombinant proteins. Purified recombinant hWRN-N333 was applied to a Superdex S-200 column. Most of the protein (&#x0003e;90&#x00025;) eluted in a peak corresponding to a molecular mass of 130 kDa (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd385f5">5</xref>, fractions 12 and 13). A small amount (&#x0003c;10&#x00025;) of higher molecular material was present in fractions 12 and 13, but these were absent from the starting material (fraction Ni), and appeared to be generated by the TCA precipitation used to concentrate the fractions. Because the predicted mass of the recombinant hWRN-N333 protein is ~42 kDa, the oligomerization state of the protein appears to be a trimer. A minor fraction of hWRN-N333 eluted in a peak corresponding to a mass of 250 kDa, consistent with a hexameric oligomerization state. We also assessed the oligomerization status of full-length WRN. Recombinant full-length hWRN was applied to a Superose 6 column. Most of the protein eluted in a peak corresponding to a molecular mass of 465 kDa (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd385f6">6</xref>). Because the predicted mass of the recombinant full-length WRN is 165 kDa, the oligomerization state of full-length hWRN also appeared to be a trimer. Thus, the quaternary structure of WRN appears to differ from that of BLM, which was reported to be hexameric (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd385c26">26</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>hWRN interaction with PCNA</title><p>Because WRN may be involved in DNA replication and&#x0002f;or repair (Discussion), we asked whether WRN interacted with proteins known to participate in these processes. In agreement with a recent report (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd385c27">27</xref>), WRN interacted with one such protein, the PCNA (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd385f7">7</xref>). Recombinant GST or a GST&#x02013;PCNA fusion protein was immobilized on glutathione-Sepharose beads, and incubated with lysates from insect cells infected with hWRN- or Mock (control)-expressing baculoviruses. Proteins specifically bound to the beads were released and analyzed by western blotting. WRN bound to GST&#x02013;PCNA, but not GST (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd385f7">7</xref>B). Alternatively, purified recombinant hWRN was incubated with GST&#x02013;PCNA, GST or GST&#x02013;TIN2, a telomere binding protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd385c24">24</xref>) used to demonstrate specificity. Complexes immunoprecipitated by anti-GST were analyzed by western blotting (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd385f7">7</xref>C). WRN was present in complexes containing GST&#x02013;PCNA, but not GST or GST&#x02013;TIN2. Taken together, these data suggest that WRN is capable of interacting with PCNA <italic>in vitro</italic>, at least under these conditions, and that the interaction is direct. Whether and under what circumstances this interaction occurs <italic>in vivo</italic>, is not known at this time. Before we completed a full characterization of this interaction, a report was published showing that WRN interacts with PCNA <italic>in vitro</italic> and in nuclear replication complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd385c27">27</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>WRN belongs to the RECQ helicase family whose members include <italic>E.coli</italic> RECQ, <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> SGS1, and human RECQL, BLM, WRN, RECQL4 and RECQL5. WRN is unique among these helicases in that it is also an exonuclease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd385c18">18</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd385c21">21</xref>). This activity, which hydrolyzes double-stranded DNA with 3&#x02032;&#x02192;5&#x02032; directionality, is located in the N-terminal region of the protein.</p><p>We cloned and expressed the N-terminal region of the mouse WRN protein, and showed that it is also an exonuclease with 3&#x02032;&#x02192;5&#x02032; polarity. The substrate specificity of mWRN was markedly similar to that of hWRN. The only difference we observed between the hWRN and mWRN exonucleases was that the mouse protein appeared to be somewhat less active than the human protein. The N-terminal region of mWRN is 30&#x00025; divergent from the corresponding region of hWRN. This sequence divergence could be responsible for the reduced activity of the mWRN exonuclease. Alternatively, the mWRN exonuclease may have slightly different salt, pH or other requirements for optimal activity. Recently, exonuclease activity with the opposite polarity (5&#x02032;&#x02192;3&#x02032;) was reported for hWRN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd385c28">28</xref>). We (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd385c20">20</xref>) and others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd385c21">21</xref>) have not observed 5&#x02032;&#x02192;3&#x02032; activity intrinsic to WRN. In this study, the N-terminal fragments were purified to &#x0003e;90&#x00025; homogeneity, and both the human and mouse fragments showed 3&#x02032;&#x02192;5&#x02032; exonuclease activity. We introduced a Glu&#x02192;Ala substitution at amino acid 84 in the human fragment. This residue is one of five predicted to be critical for exonuclease activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd385c18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd385c19">19</xref>). The mutation abolished the 3&#x02032;&#x02192;5&#x02032; exonuclease activity of the fragment, as it did in the full-length protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd385c20">20</xref>). An independent point mutation (D82A, Asp&#x02192;Ala at amino acid 82) also inactivated the 3&#x02032;&#x02192;5&#x02032; exonuclease activity of full-length hWRN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd385c20">20</xref>). Thus, biochemical and genetic data indicate that WRN is a 3&#x02032;&#x02192;5&#x02032; exonuclease. Moreover, this activity exists in both the human and mouse proteins.</p><p>Despite slightly different levels of activity, the hWRN and mWRN exonucleases displayed strikingly similar substrate specificities. First, both enzymes preferred a 3&#x02032; recessed terminus. Little or no activity was observed on blunt-ended double-stranded DNA, or a protruding 3&#x02032; strand. Similarly, little activity was observed on single-stranded DNA. Second, both enzymes were capable of removing a terminal mismatched nucleotide as efficiently as they removed a terminal matched nucleotide. However, the efficiency of terminal nucleotide removal decreased dramatically as the number of mismatches increased. The enzyme was barely active on a DNA duplex with three terminal mismatches, and no activity was detected on a duplex with six terminal mismatches. Third, both enzymes were capable of initiating degradation from gapped or nicked double-stranded DNA. Finally, neither the mouse nor human N-terminal fragments displayed endonuclease activity on blunt-ended substrates, suggesting that they are devoid of endonuclease activity. Identical substrate specificities were observed for full-length hWRN (not shown), suggesting that the N-terminal fragments contained all the amino acids needed for exonuclease activity. The substrate preferences of the WRN exonuclease are similar to those of <italic>E.coli</italic> exo III (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd385c29">29</xref>). However, unlike exo III, WRN has no endonuclease activity. One difference between the mWRN and hWRN exonucleases is the degradation pattern of the 5&#x02032; labeled substrates, which could indicate a difference in processivity between the two enzymes.</p><p>We do not as yet know the exact function(s) of the WRN exonuclease (or helicase) <italic>in vivo</italic>. One possibility is that WRN participates in one or more aspect of DNA replication, since abnormalities in S phase initiation or transit have been reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd385c6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd385c30">30</xref>). The efficient removal of a terminal mismatched nucleotide raises the possibility that WRN may provide 3&#x02032;&#x02192;5&#x02032; proofreading activity for DNA polymerases that lack such activity. WS cells are known to be hypermutable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd385c9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd385c10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd385c31">31</xref>), accumulating cytogenetic abnormalities consistent with deletions and rearrangements. However, it is not known whether WS cells also accumulate point mutations. WRN is homologous to FFA-1, a <italic>Xenopus laevis</italic> protein required for replication focus formation during DNA replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd385c32">32</xref>). Finally, the findings that WRN interacts with PCNA, and is associated with a mammalian DNA replication complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd385c27">27</xref>), suggest that WRN may function in DNA replication.</p><p>The WRN exonuclease may also function in DNA repair, since PCNA also functions in DNA repair, and WRN can initiate DNA degradation from a nick. Mismatch repair involves an incision on the damaged DNA strand followed by removal by an exonuclease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd385c33">33</xref>). WRN can potentially fulfill the exonuclease requirement in this process. However, evidence for a deficiency in mismatch repair in WS is limited. Such a deficiency was reported for SV40-transformed WS cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd385c34">34</xref>), but the repair deficiency could not be unambiguously attributed to a defect in WRN. However, WRN may participate in the repair of other types of DNA damage. WS cells are hypersensitive to 4NQO, which leads to elevated rates of chromosome breaks and exchanges (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd385c35">35</xref>). This hypersensitivity suggests that WRN may participate in the repair of such damage. Finally, the homology to RECQ suggests that the WRN exonuclease, together with the WRN or another helicase, may act in a recombinational pathway, which can repair double strand DNA breaks.</p><p>Most helicases characterized to date form either dimers or hexamers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd385c36">36</xref>). For example, <italic>E.coli</italic> UvrD is dimeric (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd385c37">37</xref>) and BLM is hexameric (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd385c26">26</xref>). Interestingly, recombinant hWRN eluted as a trimer in gel filtration assays. The oligomerization state of WRN could be important for its function. The human genome encodes more than 30 helicases, a number that may increase upon complete characterization of the genome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd385c16">16</xref>). Thus far, five are members of the RECQ family, and three of these are associated with hereditary disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd385c13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd385c17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd385c38">38</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd385c40">40</xref>). In addition to WS, defects in BLM cause Bloom&#x02019;s syndrome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd385c41">41</xref>), and defects in RECQL4 cause a subset of Rothmund&#x02013;Thomson syndrome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd385c42">42</xref>). All three syndromes are cancer-prone, but differ markedly in other associated pathophysiology. Differential expression may contribute to the distinct phenotypes caused by defects in these helicases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd385c17">17</xref>). Our finding that hWRN forms trimers, in contrast to the ability of BLM to form hexamers, suggests another level of distinction between these helicases. Although oligomerization of a helicase may not be essential for activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd385c43">43</xref>), oligomeric structure may influence substrate specificity and&#x0002f;or ability to interact with different regulatory proteins, and thus lead to different functions. It is interesting, therefore, that WRN interacts with PCNA, which also forms trimers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd385c44">44</xref>). The trimerization of WRN and PCNA may not be a coincidence. WRN trimers may provide the necessary quaternary structure for interaction with trimeric PCNA. Such an interaction might enhance WRN exonuclease and&#x0002f;or helicase activities, possibilities that remain to be explored in future studies.</p></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="display-objects"><title>Figures and Tables</title><fig id="gkd385f1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p> Amino acid sequence alignment of the N-terminal regions of hWRN and mWRN proteins.
