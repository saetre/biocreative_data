The entire IL-2R beta gene is composed of ten exons spanning about 24.3 kilobases, in which the protein is encoded by the exons 2-10. The cysteine rich extracellular region which displays a significant evolutionary resemblance to other cytokine receptors, as well as growth hormone and prolactin receptors, is encoded primarily by exons 3 and 4, whereas the membrane proximal, cysteine poor domain showing a homology with type III modules of fibronectin is encoded by exon 7. Sequence analysis of the 5'-flanking region revealed the presence of potential binding sites for transcription factors such as Octamer binding factors, AP-1, AP-2 as well as the 'GC-clusters'. At least five potential cap sites were identified by S1 mapping analysis. The 850 bp DNA sequence of the 5'-flanking region exhibited constitutive promoter activity when it was linked upstream of the HSV-tk reporter gene and then transfected into YT cells, a human leukemic cell line. By applying the RFLP linkage analysis, the IL-2R beta gene has been assigned to chromosome 22q12-13.</p><sec><title>Images</title><fig id="F1"><graphic xlink:href="nar00197-0024-a" xlink:role="3700"/></fig><fig id="F2"><graphic xlink:href="nar00197-0025-a" xlink:role="3701"/></fig></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><supplementary-material content-type="scanned-pages"><graphic xlink:href="nar00197-0021.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="3697"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00197-0022.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="3698"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00197-0023.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="3699"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00197-0024.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="3700"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00197-0025.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="3701"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00197-0026.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="3702"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00197-0027.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="3703"/></supplementary-material></body></article>
