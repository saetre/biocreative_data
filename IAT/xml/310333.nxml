These elements frequently possess polypurine/polypyrimidine stretches and are usually associated with altered chromatin structure. We have previously isolated a clone that binds a class of CT-rich promoter elements. We have further characterized this clone, termed the nuclease-sensitive element protein-1, or NSEP-1. NSEP-1 binds both duplex CT elements and the CT-rich strand of these elements in a 'generic' sequence specific manner and has overlapping but distinct single-and double-strand DNA binding domains. The minimal peptide region sufficient for both duplex and single-strand DNA binding includes two regions rich in basic amino acids flanking an RNP-CS-1 like octapeptide motif. Deletion analysis shows that the single-strand DNA binding activity is mediated by the RNP-CS-1 like octapeptide motif and is the key peptide region necessary for single-strand binding. NSEP-1's affinity for CT rich promoter elements with strand asymmetry in addition to its double- and single-strand DNA binding properties suggests that it may be a member of a class of DNA binding proteins that modulate gene expression by their ability to recognize DNA with unusual secondary structure.</p><sec><title>Images</title><fig id="F1"><graphic xlink:href="nar00075-0126-a" xlink:role="112"/></fig><fig id="F2"><graphic xlink:href="nar00075-0127-a" xlink:role="113"/></fig><fig id="F3"><graphic xlink:href="nar00075-0127-b" xlink:role="113"/></fig><fig id="F4"><graphic xlink:href="nar00075-0127-c" xlink:role="113"/></fig><fig id="F5"><graphic xlink:href="nar00075-0128-a" xlink:role="114"/></fig><fig id="F6"><graphic xlink:href="nar00075-0129-a" xlink:role="115"/></fig></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><supplementary-material content-type="scanned-pages"><graphic xlink:href="nar00075-0125.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="111"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00075-0126.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="112"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00075-0127.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="113"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00075-0128.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="114"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00075-0129.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="115"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00075-0130.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="116"/></supplementary-material></body></article>
