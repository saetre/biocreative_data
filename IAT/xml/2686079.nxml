However, HflX-50S interaction is not limited to a specific nucleotide-bound state of the protein, and the presence of any of the nucleotides GTP/GDP/ATP/ADP is sufficient. In this respect, HflX is different from other GTPases. While <italic>E. coli</italic> HflX binds and hydrolyses both ATP and GTP, only the GTP hydrolysis activity is stimulated by 50S binding.

Several of these proteins are well characterized, and are termed molecular switches. They switch from the &#x02018;empty&#x02019; nucleotide free state to an &#x02018;ON&#x02019; state upon GTP binding and a subsequent GTP hydrolysis leads to the GDP bound &#x02018;OFF&#x02019; state <xref rid="bib1 bib2" ref-type="bibr">[1,2]</xref>. Although a similar switching mechanism prevails in a set of 11 universally conserved bacterial GTPases <xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, an understanding of their biological functions is only beginning to emerge.</p><p>Gene products of the <italic>hfl</italic>A operon, including HflX, are thought to play a role in lytic-lysogeny decision of coliphage lambda during phage infection in <italic>Escherichia coli</italic><xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. In a recent work, we negate such a role for HflX, despite its presence in this operon (to be published elsewhere). However, the widespread conservation of the <italic>hflX</italic> gene across species led us to investigate alternative roles for HflX based on the high sequence homology it shares with the members of ODN (Obg, DRG1 and Nog1) family, which have been implicated in ribosome assembly <xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>.</p><p>HflX is one of the 11 conserved bacterial GTPases.

The only exception is Era, which binds the 30S subunit in the nucleotide free state <xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. Also, <italic>E. coli</italic> Obg is the only known protein that interacts with both 30S and 50S subunits <xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. Nog1 and DRG1 are eukaryotic GTPases that participate in 60S assembly <xref rid="bib15 bib16" ref-type="bibr">[15,16]</xref>. However, the biochemical characterization of HflX that shares a high homology with Obg and Nog1 has not been reported until recently.</p><p>In this work, we show that like Obg, DRG1 and Nog1, HflX too interacts with the large ribosomal (50S) subunit. While this manuscript was under preparation, an association between HflX from <italic>Chlamydophila pneumoniae</italic> (cpHflX) and 50S subunits from <italic>E. coli</italic> has been reported <xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. In the present report, however, we demonstrate an interaction between <italic>E. coli</italic> HflX and purified <italic>E. coli</italic> ribosomal subunits. Additionally, we find that this interaction can take place in the presence of GTP as well as in the presence of other nucleotides such as GDP, ATP or ADP. This is in contrast to most ribosome binding GTPases that preferentially associate with 50S/30S only in their GTP bound forms. Furthermore, we find that full length HflX is required for HflX-50S interaction &#x02013; an attribute akin to most ribosome binding GTPases. Interestingly, HflX is not only a GTPase, but it also binds and hydrolyses ATP efficiently (to be published elsewhere). However, 50S binding stimulates only the GTP hydrolysis (albeit moderately), but not ATP hydrolysis.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><p><italic>Cloning, expression and purification of HflX.</italic> Recombinant <italic>E. coli</italic> HflX and deletion constructs &#x00394;N-HflX, &#x00394;C-HflX and HflX-G proteins were cloned, expressed and purified to homogeneity (for details, see <xref rid="app1" ref-type="sec">supplementary material</xref>).

At the outset, ribosome co-sedimentation studies were carried out employing crude ribosomes (consisting of 50S, 30S, 70S and polysomes) and HflX in presence of GMPPNP, a non-hydrolysable GTP analog. This was layered on 18&#x02013;43% sucrose gradient and fractions were collected following ultracentrifugation (see Materials and methods). The presence of various ribosomal subunits in these fractions was assessed based on the rRNA content (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>A).

In order to assess the role of the various domains of HflX in ribosome binding, we created HflX constructs lacking the N-terminal domain (&#x00394;N-HflX), the C-terminal domain (&#x00394;C-HflX) or both (HflX-G). Co-sedimentation experiments show that in all the three truncated proteins, ribosomal interactions were completely abolished (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>B). Addition of nucleotides GTP, GDP, ATP or ADP could not restore the ribosomal interactions (data not shown).

Independent mutational studies have also proposed the involvement of HflX in transposition in <italic>E. coli</italic><xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. In a recent work (to be published elsewhere), we negate the view that HflX functions in the lambda lysis-lysogeny decision or in the transposition of gene sequences. In this work, we propose a ribosome binding role for HflX.</p><p>It was possible to infer a ribosome binding function for HflX, due to &#x0223c;40&#x02013;45% sequence homology between its G domain and that of Obg, DRG1 and Nog1, which bind ribosomal subunits and participate in its biogenesis. While this manuscript was under preparation, association of cpHflX (from <italic>C. pneumonae</italic>) with 50S ribosomal subunits from <italic>E. coli</italic> was reported <xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. In this work, however, we use both HflX and ribosomal subunits from <italic>E. coli</italic>. Our results not only concur with the observations for cpHflX, but also demonstrate that association with 50S requires the presence of a nucleotide. Interestingly, HflX binds and hydrolyses both ATP and GTP, and can associate with 50S in presence of any of the four nucleotides ATP, ADP, GTP or GDP, but not in their absence (i.e., in the apo state) (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>C). Several GTPases have now been shown to bind ribosomal subunits <xref rid="bib7 bib8 bib9 bib10 bib11 bib12 bib13 bib14 bib15 bib16" ref-type="bibr">[7&#x02013;16]</xref> specifically in presence of GTP. The GTP bound state seems to provide an appropriate conformation to promote ribosome binding. Era, however, appears to be the only exception, as it is the apo state that facilitates Era-30S interactions <xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. HflX thus seems to add to the functional diversity of GTPases by associating with 50S in presence of any nucleotide that it binds. In addition, HflX displays a high affinity towards rRNA as indicated by the strong association of the protein with rRNA during purification (data not shown), and a clear association with both 16S and 23S rRNA (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>). Possibly, an arginine rich region (<xref rid="app1" ref-type="sec">Fig. S1, Supplementary material</xref>) in the N-terminal domain could be important for the RNA interaction.</p><p>Sequence analysis reveals that HflX is a three domain protein, of which the N-terminal domain is well conserved among all species and is characterized by the aforesaid glycine rich region (<xref rid="app1" ref-type="sec">Fig. S1, Supplementary material</xref>). We find that all the three domains are required for HflX-ribosome interactions (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>B). However, its homologues from a few species like <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic> or <italic>Sulfolobus solfataricus</italic> lack the C terminal domain. Since &#x00394;C-HflX does not interact with 50S (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>B), it might be that the mode of ribosome binding is different in these homologues.</p><p>Based on the presence of sequence motifs G1&#x02013;G4, HflX is classified as a GTP binding protein, and we find that <italic>E. coli</italic> HflX hydrolyses both ATP and GTP (to be published elsewhere). Unusually, we also find that HflX appears to hydrolyse ATP better than GTP. Interestingly, the competition assays in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>A, reveal that GTP hydrolysis is inhibited by ATP/AMPPNP, even at a GTP:ATP/AMPPNP ratio of 1:1. A large reduction (&#x0223c;80%) is noticed when the ratio is 1:25. However, under similar conditions, we could not observe an inhibitory effect on ATP hydrolysis in presence of GTP/GMPPNP (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>B), although an inhibition may be observed at even higher GTP/GMPPNP concentrations. Based on these findings, it is perhaps reasonable to conclude that both ATP and GTP bind the same site, i.e. the G-domain, and the protein preferentially binds and hydrolyses ATP, over GTP. While the precise roles rendered by ATP and GTP binding/hydrolysis are unclear, cpHflX does not show a similar inhibition of GTP hydrolysis in presence of ATP <xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. This indicates that the function related to ATP binding/hydrolysis may not be common to all HflX homologues.</p><p>An increased GTP hydrolysis upon ribosome association is seen for several ribosome binding GTPases. Although HflX hydrolyses both GTP and ATP, 50S association stimulates GTP hydrolysis (&#x0223c;8-fold), but not ATP hydrolysis (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>). The present data is insufficient to infer a role for HflX in ribosome biogenesis. However, it is tempting to propose the following model for HflX, which may be different from the roles attributed to other GTPases. 50S binds both the GTP and GDP bound states of HflX, and accelerates GTP hydrolysis. This could lead to a conformational change, either in HflX or the 50S, which may be specifically recognized by the other factor(s). In such a scenario, HflX would act as a helper molecule to promote the binding of other factors that play a direct role in ribosome assembly. Obviously, rigorous experimentation would be required to ascertain the involvement of HflX in the process of ribosome assembly. As ATP hydrolysis is not stimulated by 50S, it may be that the conformations attained by HflX when bound to ATP and GTP are different. Further experiments will be required to confirm the ATPase activity <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><label>Appendix A</label><title>Supplementary data</title><p>Supplementary data associated with this article can be found, in the online version, at <ext-link xlink:href="doi:10.1016/j.bbrc.2008.12.072" ext-link-type="uri">doi:10.1016/j.bbrc.2008.12.072</ext-link>.</p></sec><sec id="app1" sec-type="supplementary-material"><label>Appendix A</label><title>Supplementary data</title><p><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="N0x1caed30N0x2d4b050"><caption><title>Supplementary material</title></caption><media xlink:href="mmc1.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf"/></supplementary-material></p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>This work is supported by Wellcome Trust, UK in the form of an International Senior Research Fellowship awarded to BP and the generous support provided by Department of Biotechnology, India.
