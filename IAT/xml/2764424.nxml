Its principal role is in the regulation of epithelial commitment, differentiation and maintenance programs, during embryogenesis and in adult tissues. The <italic>p63</italic> gene has a complex transcriptional pattern, producing two subclasses of N-terminal isoforms (TA and &#x00394;N) which are alternatively spliced at the C-terminus. Here, we report the identification of two new C-terminus p63 variants, we named p63 &#x003b4; and &#x003b5;, that increase from 6 to 10 the number of the p63 isoforms. Expression analysis of all p63 variants demonstrates a tissue/cell-type-specific nature of p63 alternative transcript expression, probably related to their different cellular functions. We demonstrate that the new p63 variants as &#x00394;N isoforms are active as transcription factors as they have nuclear localization and can modulate the expression of p63 target genes. Moreover, we report that, like &#x00394;Np63&#x003b1;, &#x00394;Np63&#x003b4; and &#x003b5; sustain cellular proliferation and that their expression decreases during keratinocyte differentiation, suggesting their involvement in this process. Taken together, our results demonstrate the existence of novel p63 proteins whose expression should be considered in future studies on the roles of p63 in the regulation of cellular functions.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>p63 is a member of a family of transcription factors, also including the tumor suppressor p53 and p73, which show high level identity in their main functional domains: the transactivation domain (TA), the DNA-binding domain (DBD) and the oligomerization domain (OD).</p><p>The human p63 gene, like the p53 and p73 genes, produces multiple protein isoforms as a result of alternative promoter usage and alternative splicing events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>). The promoter upstream of exon 1 generates the class of the TAp63 isoforms containing the TA at the N-terminus, while an alternative promoter in intron 3 leads to the expression of the &#x00394;Np63 isoforms lacking the N-terminal TA domain, although it has been shown that the &#x00394;Np63 isoforms can act as regulators of transcription through different TAs present in the distinct N-terminus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>) and C-terminus regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>). Within each subclass, C-terminal alternative splicing events confer additional complexity. To date, three variants, &#x003b1;, &#x003b2; and &#x003b3;, which incorporate different portions of the C-terminus, have been described. The &#x003b1; proteins are the longest including all terminal exons and containing the C-terminal sterile alpha motif (SAM) domain&#x02014;a protein&#x02013;protein interaction domain, followed by an inhibitory domain (TI), which is able to auto-inhibit the transcriptional activity of the TA subclass isoforms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>). The &#x003b2; variants lack exon 13 and consequently the SAM and the TI domains. The &#x003b3; variants lack the C-terminal exons 11, 12, 13, 14, but incorporate an additional sequence of unknown function from intron 10. Therefore, the p63 gene expresses at least six different p63 isoforms (TAp63 &#x003b1;, &#x003b2;, &#x003b3; and &#x00394;Np63 &#x003b1;, &#x003b2;, &#x003b3;), with a complex array of similarities and differences in their structural domains and transcriptional activities.</p><p>Despite the structural conservation between members of the p53 family, they are not functionally redundant as p53-family transgenic knockout mice develop distinct phenotypes, indicating that each protein has specific biological functions. Several lines of evidence suggest that, while the main role of p53 is related to the inhibition of tumor progression, p73 and p63 appear to be more directly involved in development and differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5 B6 B7">5&#x02013;7</xref>).</p><p>Current data indicate that p63 is an essential mediator of embryonic development. p63<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice have no epidermis and other stratified epithelia and also show striking defects in limb development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>). TA and &#x00394;Np63 isoforms are expressed during distinct stages of embryonic epidermal development. TAp63 isoforms are the first p63 isoforms to be expressed during embryonic development and they are necessary for the commitment to epithelial stratification while simultaneously blocking differentiation program. Therefore, a shift towards &#x00394;Np63 isoforms during later stages would be required to counterbalance the activity of TAp63, thereby allowing cells to respond to terminal differentiation cues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>). In adults, the &#x00394;Np63&#x003b1; isoform is predominantly expressed in the basal layers of stratified epithelial tissues, suggesting that it may contribute to maintain the proliferative potential of basal cells necessary for the epithelial stratification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>). In human p63, germline mutations have been reported in patients with ectodermal dysplasia syndromes, showing varying degrees of craniofacial, limb, skin and hair defects which resemble the phenotype of p63<sup>&#x02013;/&#x02212;</sup> mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>).</p><p>The role of p63 in tumorigenesis is controversial. Initially, p63 was hypothesized to function as oncosuppressor based on its homology to p53. Mutations in the p63 gene are quite rare in human cancers and the gene maps in a region of chromosome 3 frequently amplified in squamous cell carcinoma. In primary head and neck squamous cell tumors and in other squamous epithelial cancers, &#x00394;Np63&#x003b1; is over-expressed and it was suggested that this form is required to maintain a stem cell-like state, allowing continuous proliferation and promoting tumor growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>). Recently, it has been reported that p63<sup>+/&#x02212;</sup> mice show a predisposition towards squamous cell carcinoma and that loss of p63 can cooperate with loss of p53 in tumor development, as dual heterozygous p63<sup>+/&#x02212;</sup> and p53<sup>+/&#x02212;</sup> mice display higher tumor burden and metastasis, compared to p53<sup>+/&#x02212;</sup> mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>). On the contrary, another independent study reported that p63<sup>+/&#x02212;</sup> mice show no evidence of enhanced tumor development and that dual heterozygous p63<sup>+/&#x02212;</sup> and p53<sup>+/&#x02212;</sup> mice display reduced tumor burden compared to p53<sup>+/&#x02212;</sup> mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>).</p><p>In order to investigate the expression of the p63 gene, we have applied a bioinformatics approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>), which detects transcript variants through the multiple alignment of all available transcript and/or EST sequences of a gene to the corresponding genomic sequence. Here we describe the identification of two novel human p63 C-terminal variants, that we have named &#x003b4; and &#x003b5;; we describe the <italic>in vivo</italic> validation of these new p63 variants, and present results regarding their functional characterization.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Bioinformatics</title><p>Novel p63 variants were identified using ASPicDB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>) (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.caspur.it/ASPicDB/index.php">http://www.caspur.it/ASPicDB/index.php</ext-link>), which provided access to reliable annotations of the alternative transcriptional pattern of all human genes.

Analysis of sequences confirmed the presence of these new &#x00394;Np63 transcripts.</p><p>Next, we analyzed expression of &#x00394;Np63 proteins in human keratinocytes and in a human breast carcinoma cell line. Lysates from HaCat and MCF-7 cells were resolved on a 4&#x02013;12% SDS/PAGE gel together with size standard controls for each &#x00394;Np63 isoform (&#x00394;Np63&#x003b1;, &#x003b2;, &#x003b3;, &#x003b4; and &#x003f5;). These standards were prepared by transfecting H1299 cells (which don&#x02019;t express detectable p63 protein) with pcDNA3 vectors expressing the cDNAs of each &#x00394;Np63 isoform. Western analysis was performed using a pan-p63 antibody that recognizes the core DBD of p63. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>, after a long exposure, HaCat and MCF-7 cell lysates revealed two bands corresponding to the &#x00394;Np63&#x003b4; and &#x003f5; isoforms in addition to the known &#x00394;Np63 proteins. Moreover, differential expression of the &#x00394;Np63 isoforms was observed. Indeed, in HaCat cells &#x00394;Np63&#x003b3;, &#x003b4; and &#x003b5; present lower levels of expression than &#x00394;Np63&#x003b2; and in particular &#x00394;Np63&#x003b1;, which is the predominant isoform, while in MCF-7 cells, &#x00394;Np63&#x003b4; seems to be the least expressed p63 isoform. <fig id="F3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><p>Identification of the novel &#x00394;Np63&#x003b4; and &#x003f5; proteins.

For this reason, we used the SYBR Green chemistry, designing specific primer pairs, mapping in the limited different sequence, to distinctly amplify each p63 variant (&#x003b1;, &#x003b2;, &#x003b3;, &#x003b4; and &#x003f5;). In addition, to distinguish between the TA and &#x00394;Np63 transcript subclasses, we designed primer pairs able to amplify only the 5&#x02032; end of TA and &#x00394;N transcripts.</p><p>Total RNA from primary muscle, brain and keratinocyte samples, embryonic kidney 293, breast cancer MCF-7 and HaCat cell lines was analyzed. First, we compared the relative levels of the TA and &#x00394;N p63 transcripts in each sample, using TA transcripts as calibrators (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>A). Among tissues studied, only primary keratinocytes express high levels of &#x00394;N transcripts (&#x0223c;200-fold more than TAs), while muscle and brain show no detectable levels of &#x00394;N transcripts. We could thus consider the TA class as the predominant one in these samples. Among cell lines, HaCat cells exhibit the highest levels of &#x00394;N transcripts (&#x0223c;400-fold more than TAs); in the MCF-7 cells, &#x00394;N transcripts are &#x0223c;2-fold more expressed than TA, while no detectable levels of &#x00394;Np63 mRNAs were observed in 293 cell line. <fig id="F4" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><p>Expression profile of human p63 transcripts in different normal tissues and cell lines.

The profile of the TA and &#x00394;N p63 transcripts in these samples allowed us to associate the expression values obtained for each variant, to either TA or &#x00394;N subclasses. Results obtained, indicated that the new &#x003b4; and &#x003f5; p63 variants are expressed in all samples examined and, overall, all p63 variants show differences in their expression pattern. In fact, among tissues, the &#x003b1; variant is the most expressed in all samples, with the exception of muscle, in which the &#x003b3; variant showed the highest expression level. Interestingly, we found that in muscle, apart from the &#x003b3; and &#x003b1; variants the &#x003f5; variant is the most highly expressed, while &#x003b2; and &#x003b4; variants are almost undetectable. In brain, we found that, after the &#x003b1; variant, the &#x003f5; variant is more highly expressed than the &#x003b3;, &#x003b2; and &#x003b4; variants, the latter being the least expressed in this tissue. Among cell lines, the &#x003b1; variant, is also the most highly expressed in all samples. HaCat cells showed an expression pattern similar to that of primary keratinocytes, with &#x003b3;, &#x003b4; and &#x003b5; variants relatively less expressed than &#x003b1; and &#x003b2; variants. In 293 cells, &#x003f5; and &#x003b4; variants showed a higher expression level than &#x003b2; and &#x003b3; variants, while in MCF-7 cells, after the &#x003b2;, the &#x003b3; and &#x003f5; variants showed higher expression levels than the &#x003b4; variant, in accord with observed protein expression levels (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>).</p><p>Finally, we compared the relative levels of each p63 variant among the tissues and cell lines examined (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>).

Very low levels of all p63 variants are present in brain respect to the other tissues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>A).

Although their products show some common structural and functional features, each protein seems to have specific biological functions. In fact, while p53-deficient mice grow normally but undergo spontaneous tumor development, p73 and p63 knockout mice exhibit severe developmental and differentiation defects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>). A common feature of the three genes is to produce a great variety of isoforms, either derived from the use of an internal cryptic promoter or by alternative splicing, giving rise to a network of proteins whose fine modulation is fundamental in the regulation of biological activities, ranging from development and differentiation to growth arrest and apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>). The p63 gene generates the expression of two subclasses of isoforms, namely, those containing the TA, called TA isoforms, and those lacking this domain, called &#x00394;N isoforms. Moreover, three alternative splicing events have been identified, producing the &#x003b1;, &#x003b2; and &#x003b3;, variants, which incorporate various portions of the C-terminus, for both TA and &#x00394;Np63 isoforms.</p><p>Therefore, until now six different p63 isoforms (TAp63 &#x003b1;, &#x003b2;, &#x003b3; and &#x00394;Np63 &#x003b1;, &#x003b2;, &#x003b3;) have been identified, with a complex array of similarities and differences in their structural domains and transcriptional activities.</p><p>By using the ASPIC algorithm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>), a tool for alternative splicing prediction, based on multiple transcripts and/or EST sequence comparison and alignment against the gene sequence, we identified two new human p63 C-terminus variants, one we named &#x003b4;, deriving from an alternative splicing event between exons 11 and 14, and the other, we defined &#x003b5;, that keeps the 5&#x02032; portion of intron 10, which immediately presents a stop codon. Transcript isoforms homologous to the &#x003b5; and &#x003b4; variants were not detected for p73 gene. The ASPIC algorithm, unlike other alternative splicing prediction methods which perform independent single transcript alignments with the genomic region, carries out an optimized alignment of all the gene-related transcripts with the aim of minimizing the number of predicted splice sites and consequently of the relevant transcript variants. The reliability of the ASPIC algorithm along with the significant number of EST sequences supporting these new p63 variants, prompted us to investigate the presence of these new p63 proteins <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p><p>Here, first we identified these new p63 variants in keratinocytes and MCF-7 cells, indicating that the ASPIC algorithm could be considered to provide valid starting point in the search for transcriptional variants of genes of interest (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figures 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). In keratinocytes, known to express high levels of p63 as &#x00394;N variants, we observed a differential expression of the novel variants with respect to the other known isoforms. In particular, &#x00394;Np63&#x003b4; is highly expressed respect to &#x00394;Np63&#x003b3; and &#x00394;Np63&#x003f5; and, as expected, the &#x00394;N&#x003b1; and &#x003b2; variants are the predominant isoforms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>B).</p><p>We extended the study of the expression of all five p63 variants, by qRT&#x02013;PCR methodology, to different normal human tissues and cell lines in order to determine whether it was tissue-specific (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>). The results confirmed that the p63 variants are differentially expressed, either as TA and &#x00394;N form, in tested samples and that the two new variants, &#x003b4; and &#x003f5;, show interesting expression profiles. In brain, where only the TA class was detected, the &#x003f5; variant is the most expressed after the &#x003b1; variant, and in muscle tissue, the TAp63&#x003f5; transcript shows levels only slightly lower than TAp63&#x003b1;. Among the cell lines analyzed, HaCat cells show a p63 expression profile similar to keratinocytes, while in MCF-7 cells, &#x003f5; variants show similar expression level to &#x003b2; and &#x003b3; variants, while &#x003b4; variants show the lowest expression. Interestingly, in 293 cells, the &#x003f5; and &#x003b4; variants seem to be the predominant variants after &#x003b1;. We also compared the relative levels of each p63 variant among the tissues and cell lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>), showing that &#x003b1;, &#x003b2; and &#x003b4; variants are more expressed in keratinocytes, while &#x003b3; and &#x003f5; variants are present at higher levels in muscle tissue. Very low levels of all p63 variants are present in brain with respect to the other tissues analyzed. Among cell lines, very low expression of all variants were observed in MCF-7 and 293 cells with respect to HaCat cells.</p><p>After demonstrating the <italic>in vivo</italic> expression of the new &#x003b4; and &#x003f5; p63 variants, we have performed initial functional characterization. An indication that, like other isoforms, &#x00394;Np63&#x003b4; and &#x00394;Np63&#x003f5; act as transcription factors, was derived from the study of their cellular localization and transactivation activity. In fact, both &#x00394;Np63&#x003b4; and &#x00394;Np63&#x003f5; show a nuclear localization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>), have significant transactivation activity towards the p63 REs examined (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>) and are able to regulate <italic>in vivo</italic> the expression of &#x00394;Np63 positive and negative target genes although with different efficiency with respect to the other &#x00394;Np63 isoforms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8</xref>A and B). The effect of the ectopic expression of the &#x00394;Np63 isoforms on the expression of the target genes is variable in the two cellular contexts examined, suggesting that other cell-specific transcription factors may participate with &#x00394;Np63 proteins in the regulation of these genes. Moreover, we show that the ectopic expression of the &#x00394;Np63&#x003b4; and &#x003f5; isoforms, like &#x00394;Np63&#x003b1;, increase the cell proliferation rate, while &#x00394;Np63&#x003b2;, &#x00394;Np63&#x003b3; and p53 reduce proliferation rates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8</xref>C). Taken together, these data may suggest that &#x00394;Np63&#x003b4; and &#x003f5; isoforms, as &#x00394;Np63&#x003b1;, could have a role in sustaining cell proliferation as they activate genes involved in cell cycle progression (<italic>fasn</italic> and <italic>ada</italic>) but not the pro-apoptotic gene <italic>bax</italic>.</p><p>The &#x003b4; and &#x003f5; p63 proteins lack one of the two TAs (TA2), which was demonstrated to be required for the transcriptional activity of the &#x00394;N isoforms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>). Overall, our results demonstrate that the &#x00394;N forms of these variants are functionally active, suggesting that the TA (TA1*) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>) present at the N-terminus of all &#x00394;N isoforms contributes significantly to their transcriptional activity.</p><p>Moreover, we studied the expression profile of the new &#x00394;Np63 variants during keratinocyte differentiation. Many studies report a role for p63 in the differentiation of epidermis, a key process by which the epithelial cells acquire their proper morphological and functional properties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>). However, it remains unclear how exactly this takes place. The basal compartment of stratified epithelia is made of cells with high proliferative capacity that replenish the terminally differentiated populations in the more luminal strata. &#x00394;Np63&#x003b1; is the isoform predominantly expressed in this basal compartment while TA isoforms are not detectable. It is suggested that &#x00394;Np63&#x003b1; is required to maintain the proliferative potential of basal cells and to allow the initial induction of keratinocyte differentiation, while it must be downregulated to allow terminal differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>).</p><p>Our results confirm that the differentiation process is associated with lower levels of all &#x00394;Np63 isoforms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Figure 9</xref>) not only &#x00394;Np63&#x003b1;, at both the transcripts and protein levels, although their relative abundance seems to be maintained. Moreover, during differentiation, we observed a reduction of the expression of some known &#x00394;Np63 target genes, consistent with the reduction of the &#x00394;Np63 variants, supporting the hypothesis that all isoforms, including &#x00394;Np63&#x003b4; and &#x00394;Np63&#x003f5;, could, along with &#x00394;Np63&#x003b1;, play a pro-proliferative role in this physiological condition. Further studies to define the signals controlling the balance in the expression of all the p63 isoforms will help to better understand the contribution of p63 to proper epidermal homeostasis.</p><p>Taken together, our results demonstrate the existence of new p63 variants, which are functionally active as transcription factors, increasing to 10 the number of the isoforms that are produced by the p63 gene.</p><p>The implications of this study open interesting avenues for future investigation. In particular, we have demonstrated tissue/cell type-specific expression of p63 alternative transcripts, suggesting possible relationships to their different cellular function. A better understanding of the regulation of expression of all p63 possible variants will thus be essential for meaningful p63 functional studies. Indeed, future studies on p63 function should take into account the possible presence of these new variants in the tissue or cell type examined, which if ignored would provide partial and/or potentially incorrect results.</p><p>Furthermore, the existence of new p63 variants increases the known complexity of the crosstalk among all the p53 family members and of their mutual regulation in the maintenance of the proper cellular growth of epithelial tissues.</p></sec><sec><title>ACCESSION NUMBERS</title><p>GQ202690 and GQ202689.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>SUPPLEMENTARY DATA</title><p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkp674/DC1">Supplementary Data</ext-link> are available at NAR Online.</p><supplementary-material id="PMC_1" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>[Supplementary Data]</title></caption><media mimetype="text" mime-subtype="html" xlink:href="gkp674_index.html"/><media xlink:role="associated-file" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="gkp674_1.pdf"/></supplementary-material></sec><sec><title>FUNDING</title><p>Telethon (grant number GGP06158), Progetto Strategico Regione Puglia and Grant 2008 of the Bari University (ex 60%).
