The dorsal thalamus (DTh) is a pivotal forebrain structure, receiving sensory inputs from the periphery and communicating with the cerebral cortex via thalamocortical (TC) axons. Each thalamic nucleus projects topographically to a unique set of cortical areas (interareal, first-order level of topography), and subsequently, axons emerging within a given thalamic nucleus establish a topographic map of a given sensory modality within each cortical area (intra-areal, second-order level of topography). Numerous anatomical studies have demonstrated that the <italic>interareal</italic> topography of TC projections is organized so that rostromedial thalamic neurons project to more-rostral cortical areas than caudolateral nuclei, which tend to project to more-caudal cortical areas &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060116-b001">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060116-b003">3</xref>&#x0005d;. The developmental mechanisms leading to the initial guidance and topographic sorting of TC axons, first in the ventral telencephalon (VTel) and, ultimately, in the dorsal telencephalon (or cortex), are still poorly understood at the molecular level (reviewed in &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060116-b004">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060116-b005">5</xref>&#x0005d;).</p><p>Previous results suggested that the precise topography characterizing TC projections arises from the progressive sorting of axons by a series of cues present along their pathway rather than by those exclusively present in their final target, the cortex &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060116-b004">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060116-b005">5</xref>&#x0005d;.

These findings suggested a model in which TC axons are guided to their appropriate cortical domain by extracortical cues, i.e., <italic>before</italic> reaching the cortex. Interestingly, at later stages, unidentified cortical cues are able to redirect thalamic axon outgrowth to the appropriate cortical area inside the cortex proper &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060116-b008">8</xref>&#x0005d;, a result also found in heterotopic cortical grafting experiments &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060116-b009">9</xref>&#x0005d;.</p><p>Using a novel in vitro assay (the &#x0201c;whole-mount telencephalic&#x0201d; assay), we have demonstrated that axons originating from different rostrocaudal domains of the DTh respond differentially to topographic cues present in the VTel that guide these axons to specific cortical domains &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060116-b010">10</xref>&#x0005d;.

Using the whole-mount telencephalic assay developed by Seibt et al. &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060116-b010">10</xref>&#x0005d;, a parallel study demonstrated that the graded expression of <italic>ephrin-A5</italic> in the VTel and some of its receptors such as <italic>EphA7</italic> and <italic>EphA4</italic> in the DTh play a role in the topographic sorting of TC axons in the VTel. Interestingly, ephrin-A5&#x02013;EphA4 double-knockout (dKO) mice show a significant and fully penetrant topographic shift of TC projections at the level of the VTel, leading to the misprojection of some thalamic motor axons to aberrantly more-caudal areas such as the primary somatosensory cortex.

However, a contingent of rostral thalamic axons is still projecting to the rostral third of the VTel (arrowheads in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060116-g005">Figure 5</xref>C). The quantification of these cocultures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060116-g005">Figure 5</xref>D) demonstrates that axons originating from the rostral DTh and growing in Netrin-1&#x02013;deficient telencephalon can be subdivided into two subpopulations that are both significantly shifted caudally (two peaks in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060116-g005">Figure 5</xref>D) compared to control cocultures (green arrow in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060116-g005">Figure 5</xref>D).</p><p>Next, we performed whole-mount telencephalic cocultures using axons originating from the caudal part of the DTh (DTC).

Taken together, these results demonstrate that the high-rostral to low-caudal gradient of Netrin-1 expression in the VTel is required for the differential topographic mapping of thalamic axons before they reach the cortex.

One of the drawbacks of this collagen coculture assay is that TC axons are not growing through their &#x0201c;natural&#x0201d; environment, and therefore, axon responsiveness to specific axon guidance cue could be biased because axons do not express the right complement of axon guidance receptors.

Traced axons were superimposed on a reference framework with common origin, and the percentage of pixels in caudal, medial, or rostral 60&#x000b0; radial bin was quantified. When axon density in the sample was too high to identify individual axons, we quantified the percentage of EGFP-pixel distribution in the same way as in single-axon tracing. Thus, the two methods utilize essentially identical quantification analyses, and we combined the results obtained by using these two methods.</p></sec><sec id="s4h"><title>Confocal microscopy.</title><p>Fluorescent immunostaining was observed using a LEICA TCS-SL laser scanning confocal microscope equipped with an Argon laser (488 nm), green helium-neon laser (546 nm), and red helium-neon laser line (633 nm) mounted on an inverted DM-IRE2 microscope equipped with a Marzhauzer X-Y motorized stage allowing large-scale tiling of whole-mount telencephalic cocultures obtained by scanning multiple fields using a long working distance 10&#x000d7; objective followed by an automatic tiling function available from the LEICA confocal software.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pbio-0060116-sg001"><label>Figure S1</label><caption><title>Biotinylated Dextran Amine (BDA) Axon Tracing and Reconstruction of the Topography of Thalamocortical Projections in Embryonic Mouse Brain</title><p>(A) Experimental paradigm underlying BDA anterograde tracing in live mouse embryonic DTh.</p><p>(B&#x02013;D&#x02032;) This method allows the labeling of small numbers of thalamic neurons as visualized on these three confocal micrographs taken of adjacent 100-&#x003bc;m&#x02013;thick vibratome sections of the anterior portion of the thalamus of an E14.5 hemisphere (injection site delineated by red shaded area in &#x0005b;B&#x02032;&#x02013;D&#x02032;&#x0005d;).
