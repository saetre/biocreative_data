Their small number and scattered distribution in the hypothalamus make them particularly difficult to study <italic>in vivo</italic>. The Cre/loxP system is a valuable tool to delete genes in specific cells and tissues. We report the production of two mouse lines that express the CRE bacteriophage recombinase in a GnRH-specific manner. The first line, the GnRH-CRE mouse, contains a transgene in which CRE is under the control of the murine GnRH promoter and targets CRE expression specifically to GnRH neurones in the hypothalamus. The second line, the GnRH-CRETeR mouse, uses the same murine GnRH promoter to target CRE expression to GnRH neurones, but is modified to be constitutively repressed by a tetracycline repressor (TetR) expressed from a downstream tetracycline repressor gene engineered within the transgene. GnRH neurone-specific CRE expression can therefore be induced by treatment with doxycycline which relieves repression by TetR. These GnRH-CRE and GnRH-CRETeR mice can be used to study the function of genes expressed specifically in GnRH neurones. The GnRH-CRETeR mouse can be used to study genes that may have distinct roles in reproductive physiology during the various developmental stages.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>GnRH</kwd><kwd>LHRH</kwd><kwd>CRE recombinase</kwd><kwd>transgenic mouse</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><p>Reproductive function is regulated by the activity of the hypothalamic&#x02013;pituitary&#x02013;gonadal axis. Gonadotrophin-releasing hormone (GnRH) is secreted by GnRH neurone axon terminals at the median eminence and regulates pituitary gonadotrophin synthesis and secretion. GnRH neurone cell bodies are primarily located in the basal forebrain with particular densities of neurones located in the diagonal band of Broca (DBB), the medial septal nuclei and the medial preoptic area (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>).</p><p>Expression of the GnRH gene is anatomically very limited within the central nervous system. It is estimated that as few as 800 neurones express the gene in the mouse brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>). Transgenic animal studies using various reporter genes have demonstrated that cell-specific expression of the mouse GnRH gene in the adult hypothalamus is regulated by the proximal 3446 base pairs of the mouse promoter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>).</p><p>Targeted gene disruption has been an important tool in elucidating the physiological role for a number of genes. However, this process produces animals in which all of the tissues and cells of the body possess the deleted gene. A number of investigators have deleted genes in specific tissue and cell types using the the Cre/<italic>loxP</italic> system. This system uses the targeted expression of the CRE bacteriophage recombinase to recognise consensus <italic>loxP</italic> target sequences that have been inserted into the gene of interest (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>). By crossing a mouse containing a transgene expressing CRE under the control of a cell-specific promoter with a mouse containing a gene flanked by <italic>loxP</italic> elements, an animal in which the desired gene is deleted only in the tissue of interest can be obtained. Site specific recombination using the Cre/LoxP system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>) has been performed by a number of investigators to produce neurone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>), muscle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>), pancreatic &#x003b2;-cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>), kidney (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>) and liver (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>)-specific gene deletions in mice.</p><p>In the present study, we report the development of a transgenic mouse line that expresses the CRE bacterial recombinase in a GnRH neurone-specific manner. Using the 3446 bp mouse GnRH promoter fused to CRE cDNA, mice in which the CRE gene is expressed in GnRH neurones (GnRH-Cre) were produced. These mice are similar to mice produced in other studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>). A transgenic mouse in which the transgene is engineered to be inducible by treatment with doxycycline allowing for temporal regulation of GnRH neurone specific Cre-mediated, conditional gene excision in mice (GnRH-CRETeR) was also developed. This allows for the gene recombination to occur at the desired time during the development of the mouse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>).</p><p>The production of mice containing GnRH neurone specific deletions of genes could prove valuable to our understanding of molecular and cellular elements that regulate GnRH neuronal development and function. The present study provides the initial characterisation of the two mouse lines.</p><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Transgene production</title><p>The GnRH-CRE transgene was produced by using the &#x02212;3446/+28mGnRH promoter fragment (generous gift from Dr Donald DeFranco) cloned into pGEM11Z. A 1.7-kb fragment containing the CRE coding region, an intron derived from the SV40 <italic>t-antigen</italic> gene, and a nuclear localisation signal was extracted from the ACN cassette (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>) by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) with an <italic>Xho</italic>I site added to the 5&#x02032; end and a <italic>Hind</italic>III site added to the 3&#x02032; end. The CRE gene was then inserted into the <italic>Xho</italic>I and <italic>Hind</italic>III sites of &#x02212;3446/+28mGnRH-11Z. <italic>Not</italic>I and <italic>Sal</italic>I were used to linearise the transgene and to remove vector backbone.</p><p>The CRETeR vector was obtained from the laboratory of Dr Fred Wondisford (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>). Briefly, the CRE fragment described above was amplified with <italic>Hind</italic>III ends by PCR and cloned into the <italic>Hind</italic>III restriction enzyme site within the multiple cloning site (MCS) of the pcDNA4/TO vector (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA). The pcDNA4/TO vector contains a CMV promoter, with two Tet operators in the proximal promoter, 5&#x02032; of the MCS. On the 3&#x02032; side of the MCS is a bovine growth hormone polyadenylation sequence. A CMV-TetR cassette from pcDNA6/TO (Invitrogen) was then cloned downstream of CRE generating the CRETeR vector. The CRETeR vector was digested with <italic>Bgl</italic>II to release the CMV promoter, but retain part of the 2X Tet operator in the proximal promoter. The 3446 bp mouse GnRH promoter was amplified from the &#x02212;3446/+28&#x02212;11Z vector by PCR so that a <italic>SgrA</italic>I and a <italic>BamH</italic>I were added to the 5&#x02032; end. The 3&#x02032; end was designed to restore the 2X Tet operator by inserting into the <italic>Bgl</italic>II site with a <italic>BamH</italic>I end. This fragment was released from a shuttle vector by excision with <italic>BamH</italic>I and inserted into the CRETeR vector to produce GnRH-CRETeR. The vector was sequenced for verification and was linearised with <italic>SgrA</italic>I to remove vector backbone.</p></sec><sec><title>Animal production</title><p>The linearised vectors were purified and injected into fertilised oocytes derived from a DC1 mouse to generate transgenic lines. Transgenic mice were identified by PCR and Southern blot analysis. Hybridisation probes were obtained by PCR using the primers (sense, 5&#x02032;-ATGCCCAAGAAGAAGAGGAAGGTG-3&#x02032;; antisense, 5&#x02032;-TCGCGAGCTCGACCGAACAAA-3&#x02032;) and the ACN cassette as a template producing a 1.3-kb fragment. Southern blot analysis was performed as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>).

A 300-bp product will be produced in the presence of the transgene. Seven founder lines were produced for the GnRH-CRE transgene and four were produced for the GnRH-CRETeR transgene. Single founder lines were chosen based on immunohistochemistry and the remaining lines were sacrificed.</p></sec><sec><title>Animal care and treatments</title><p>To induce CRE expression in the GnRH-CRETeR mice, doxycycline (DOX) was administered as a 5-mg pellet that was inserted dorsally with a 10-gauge trochar. The 21-day release doxycycline pellets were obtained from Innovative Research of America (Sarasota, FL, USA). For the examination of CRE expression, animals were sacrificed within 21 days to obtain tissue samples for histology. For the examination of CRE recombinase activity using the reporter mice, animals were sacrificed a minimum of 10 days after DOX capsule implantation. All experiments were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committees at Johns Hopkins Medical Institution, The University of Chicago or at The University of Maryland School of Medicine.</p></sec><sec><title>R26R/GnRH-CRE or GnRH-CRETeR bitransgenic mice</title><p>To assess the anatomical distribution of functional CRE recombinase expression in the GnRH-CRE or GnRH-CRETeR mice they were crossed with the Gt(ROSA)26Sor<sup>tm1Sor</sup> reporter mouse (R26R) developed by Soriano (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>) and obtained from Jackson Laboratories (Bar Harbor, ME, USA). R26R mice were genotyped using three primers, p1, 5&#x02032;-AAAGTCGCTCTGAGTTGTTAT-3&#x02032;, p2, 5&#x02032;-GCGAAGAGTTTGTCCTCAACC-3&#x02032;, p3, 5&#x02032;GGAGCGGGAGAAATGGATATG-3&#x02032;. For the wild-type allele, primers p3 (sense) and p1 (antisense) will produce an approximately 550-bp amplicon. For the R26R allele, primers p2 (sense) and p1 (antisense) produce an approximately 300-bp amplicon.

In some cases, sections were treated with a &#x003b2;-Gal Staining Set (Roche) to assess enzymatic activity. Sections were then stained for GnRH as described for the single label above. The tissue was rinsed and reacted using Tris saline (0.1 <sc>m</sc> solution pH 7.2) and DAB without nickel salts as the chromogen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref>). This procedure provided a brown reaction product. After approximately 15&#x02013;20 min, the tissue was rinsed in the acetate solution or Tris-saline solution, rinsed in KPBS, and then placed into saline. The sections were mounted onto subbed slides, air-dried overnight, dehydrated in alcohols, cleared in xylenes and mounted with Histomount and coverslipped.

Mice from each of these lines were bred for several generations and exhibited normal fertility compared to other mice in our colony, indicating that the expression of CRE in GnRH neurones did not impair reproductive function for the GnRH-CRE mouse line.

CRE, a bacteriophage recombinase, can mediate a synaptic union of two loxP elements located on the same linear DNA complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>). Thus, it has been used to delete the region between properly oriented LoxP sites in a specific gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>). <italic>In vivo</italic> recombination between <italic>loxP</italic> sites occurs with high efficiency if CRE is expressed at a sufficiently high level. For this reason, a number of transgenic mice have been produced in which CRE expression has been placed under the control of a cell- or tissue-specific promoter and used to target gene knockouts to specific cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref>). Systems have also been developed that allow temporal regulation of CRE expression, either by treatment with tetracycline or tamoxifen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">36</xref>). The present study describes the development of two transgenic mouse lines: the GnRH-CRE line that expresses the CRE recombinase under the control of the GnRH promoter; and the GnRH-CRETeR line which expresses CRE in GnRH neurones following induction by tetracycline.</p><p>The GnRH-CRE line was developed by producing mice containing a transgene consisting of the CRE bacteriophage recombinase gene regulated by a 3446-bp fragment of the mouse GnRH promoter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Fig. 1<sc>a</sc></xref>). This promoter region has previously been reported to be sufficient to target expression to GnRH neurones in the brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>). The GnRH-CRE mice express CRE in GnRH neurones in the hypothalamus as assessed by double-label histological analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02">Fig. 2</xref>) while exhibiting virtually undetectable levels of CRE in other cells within the basal hypothalamus or in other tissues examined by western blot analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Fig. 1<sc>b</sc></xref>). In addition, when GnRH-CRE mice are mated with the ROSA-LacZ reporter mice, offspring containing both the CRE transgene and the reporter locus possessed &#x003b2;-galactosidase expression in almost 87% of GnRH neurones, indicating sufficient GnRH neuronal CRE activity to induce recombination within the ROSA locus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig03">Fig. 3</xref>). &#x003b2;-galactosidase expression was observed in a population of neurones in the lateral septum of mice that do not appear to express GnRH (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig03">Fig. 3</xref>). These neurones were also labelled in doxycycline treated mice containing the GnRH-CRETeR transgene and the ROSA-LacZ reporter gene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig04">Fig. 4<sc>b</sc></xref>). This suggests that the GnRH promoter activity in these neurones is ongoing and not due solely to an early developmental expression of GnRH in this population of cells as has been previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref>). These neurones may express a GnRH splice variant that is seen <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">37</xref>) or express GnRH that is not translated, or have a very low level of GnRH protein expression that cannot be detected using available GnRH antibodies. Support for ongoing expression in other populations of neurones comes from mapping studies in human brains in which population of GnRH expressing neurones were identified in the septum and dorsal preoptic area (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">38</xref>). Other groups have reported this population of neurones in the lateral septum expressing GnRH promoter reporter transgenes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref>). The significance of this population to reproductive development and function has yet to be determined. Since nearly all GnRH neurones are expressing CRE, the GnRH-CRE mouse is suitable for the constitutive disruption of genes in GnRH neurones when crossed with mice containing floxed alleles of expressed genes.</p><p>Other studies have produced mouse lines expressing CRE in GnRH neurones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>). The GnRH-iCRE mice produced by Shimshek <italic>et al.</italic> (18, 19) were produced using the same 3446 bp fragment of the murine promoter used to produce the GnRH-CRE mouse, but fused to an improved CRE gene (iCRE). These mice target CRE to GnRH neurones, but examination of CRE activity in reporter mouse studies using the ROSA26 reporter mice showed widespread CRE activity in the lateral septum, and in various other non-GnRH expressing cells located in the lateral hypothalamus, zona incerta, anterior hypothalamus, bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, caudate putamen, paraventricular thalamic nuclei, central amygdaloid nuclei, nucleus accumbens, posterior thalamic nuclei, paraventricular nuclei and the reticular thalamus. The GnRH-CRE/ROSA26 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig03">Fig. 3</xref>) and GnRH-CRETeR/ROSA26 mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig04">Figs 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig05">5</xref>) reported in the present study exhibited far more restricted CRE activity. Although unproven, this may be a function of the modifications made to the CRE gene by Shimshek <italic>et al.</italic> (18, 19) that produced a more robust CRE species that can exert recombinase activity even in cells which have otherwise undetectable GnRH promoter activity.</p><p>The LHRH::CRE transgenic mouse produced by Yoon <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>) was constructed by inserting a CRE recombinase-poly(A) cassette into the first exon of the GnRH gene in a 212-kb BAC genomic fragment. Almost 100% of CRE expressing neurones in these mice expressed GnRH although whether nonbrain tissues were examined was not documented in this manuscript. In crosses with the ROSA26YFP reporter mouse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>), these mice also exhibited CRE activity in the lateral septum and bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, as seen in the GnRH-iCRE mice. Whether there was more widespread CRE recombinase activity in more caudal regions of the brain, as was reported in the GnRH-iCRE mouse, was not addressed. Importantly, the additional flanking regions of the gene present in the BAC transgene used by Yoon <italic>et al.</italic> (21) did not further restrict CRE activity compared to the GnRH-CRE transgene used in the present study, suggesting that the elements required to restrict expression are located in the proximal 3446 bps of the promoter.</p><p>A third mouse was reported as the present study was being written (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>). These mice are reported to express CRE in 97% of GnRH neurones and to exhibit GnRH neurone-specific CRE recombinase activity in 97% of GnRH neurones as assessed in crosses with the ROSA26 reporter mouse. Few additional details were provided about these mice, and it is not clear as to what extent CRE was expressed in other neurones in the brain or in other tissues in the body. In addition, no mention was made of whether there was the CRE recombinase activity observed in non-GnRH neurones as reported by Yoon <italic>et al.</italic> (21), Shimshek <italic>et al.</italic> (18, 19) and ourselves.</p><p>The GnRH-CRETeR transgene was produced by subcloning the 3446-bp mouse GnRH promoter into the CRETeR vector (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>). The proximal region of the promoter is modified to insert two Tet operators, binding sites for the Tet repressor (TetR). In addition, the transgene contains the TetR gene under the regulation of the CMV promoter, ensuring that the TetR protein will always be present to constitutively repress CRE expression. In the presence of tetracycline, or the more stable analogue doxycycline, the repressor is removed from the Tet operators, allowing for GnRH promoter driven expression of the transgene. We produced mice containing this transgene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig04">Fig. 4<sc>a</sc></xref>), the GnRH-CRETeR mouse, and have identified a line that expresses functional CRE protein, as assessed in the ROSA26 reporter mouse, in 88% of GnRH neurones in mice treated with doxycycline (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig04">Figs 4<sc>b,c</sc></xref>). In mice not treated with doxycycline, CRE recombinase activity was not observed in GnRH neurones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig05">Fig. 5</xref>). When induced, the degree of CRE activity is strikingly similar to the expression of CRE in the GnRH-CRE mice, indicating that neither the modifications to the proximal region of the GnRH promoter or differences in transgene insertion site have interfered appreciably with its function.</p><p>In summary, we report two mouse lines that express the CRE recombinase exclusively in GnRH neurones. The GnRH-CRE line expresses CRE solely under the control of the murine GnRH promoter. The second, GnRH-CRETeR, line is an inducible line that expresses CRE in GnRH neurones only following treatment of the mice with doxycycline. By crossing GnRH-CRE or GnRH-CRETeR mice with mice containing a floxed gene, the effects of the loss of the gene in GnRH neurones on the reproductive physiology of the animal can be studied. The GnRH-CRETeR mice would have the added benefit of temporally controlling the GnRH neurone-specific expression of CRE. Therefore, analysis of the role of a specific gene in GnRH neurones can be explored in adult mice without possible confounding developmental effects due to the absence of the gene. Furthermore, mice would be able to serve as their own controls by examining physiology before and after CRE recombinase induction. The availability of these mice will allow investigators to explore, <italic>in vivo</italic>, the importance of a vast array of genes on the central regulation of reproductive function.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>The technical assistance of Lan Su and Yewade Ng is greatly appreciated.
