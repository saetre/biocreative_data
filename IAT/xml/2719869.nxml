Because the obesity-associated SNPs are intronic, it is unclear whether changes in FTO expression or splicing are the cause of obesity or if regulatory elements within intron 1 influence upstream or downstream genes. We tested the idea that FTO itself is involved in obesity. We show that a dominant point mutation in the mouse <italic>Fto</italic> gene results in reduced fat mass, increased energy expenditure, and unchanged physical activity. Exposure to a high-fat diet enhances lean mass and lowers fat mass relative to control mice. Biochemical studies suggest the mutation occurs in a structurally novel domain and modifies FTO function, possibly by altering its dimerisation state. Gene expression profiling revealed increased expression of some fat and carbohydrate metabolism genes and an improved inflammatory profile in white adipose tissue of mutant mice. These data provide direct functional evidence that <italic>FTO</italic> is a causal gene underlying obesity. Compared to the reported mouse FTO knockout, our model more accurately reflects the effect of human <italic>FTO</italic> variants; we observe a heterozygous as well as homozygous phenotype, a smaller difference in weight and adiposity, and our mice do not show perinatal lethality or an age-related reduction in size and length. Our model suggests that a search for human coding mutations in <italic>FTO</italic> may be informative and that inhibition of FTO activity is a possible target for the treatment of morbid obesity.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><p>Geneticists have identified many gene regions that cause human disease by using multiple genetic markers in large populations to find gene regions associated with disease. However, it is often not clear precisely which gene in any given region causes the disease or how the gene exerts its functional effect. For example, a gene variant in the non-coding region of FTO enhances obesity risk, but it is not clear if this is an effect of the FTO gene itself or another gene located nearby. We therefore tested whether FTO regulates body weight in the mouse. We found that a single change (mutation) in the sequence coding for the mouse FTO protein decreases the functional activity of FTO and causes reduced fat mass and body weight. Food intake and activity were normal, but the mutant mice had a higher metabolic rate. In addition, their fat mass was lower than that of normal mice when both were fed a high-fat diet. Our study provides direct evidence that FTO directly affects fat mass and thus is likely to have a role in human obesity. As reduced FTO function decreases body weight in mice, it is worth exploring if pharmaceutical agents that inhibit FTO activity might help reduce human obesity.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="15"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>In genome-wide association studies (GWAS) for type 2 diabetes, a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) within intron 1 of the fat mass and obesity-associated (<italic>FTO</italic>) gene was found to be associated with an increased risk of obesity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000599-Frayling1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000599-Dina1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>.

This is a particular problem when the disease-associated SNP lies within an intron, as is the case for <italic>FTO</italic>. One approach to identifying the function of a gene is to mutate it in a model organism. A mouse possessing a 1.6 Mbp deletion in mouse chromosome 8 that includes <italic>Fto</italic> as well as <italic>Ftm</italic>, <italic>Ft1</italic>, <italic>Irx3</italic>, <italic>Irx5</italic> and <italic>Irx6</italic> has been characterised (<italic>fused toes</italic> or <italic>Ft</italic> mice) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000599-Peters1">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref>.

Recently, a mouse FTO knockout has been described in which exons 2 and 3 of <italic>Fto</italic> are replaced by a neomycin STOP cassette <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000599-Fischer1">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref>. This cassette also deletes part of intron 1 although not the position equivalent to the BMI-associated SNPs in human <italic>FTO</italic>. Homozygous FTO knockout mice were viable but showed significant postnatal death before 4 weeks of age. They also exhibited postnatal growth retardation, a reduction in adipose tissue, a reduction in lean mass, increased energy expenditure, increased sympathetic nervous system activity, relative hyperphagia and reduced spontaneous locomotor activity. Thus this study suggested that <italic>Fto</italic> is directly involved in energy metabolism and body weight regulation.</p><p>However, many human SNPs are likely to result in impaired function rather than total loss of function, and mouse knockouts are not always the most informative because they can result in a non-viable or severely compromised organism.

Physical activity and food intake is unchanged but metabolic rate is increased. We show by gene expression analysis that fat and carbohydrate metabolism are increased in mutant mice and they possess an improved inflammatory profile. On a high-fat diet mutant mice show a lower fat mass than wild-type mice.

We also investigated the oligomerisation state of the proteins in solution using gel filtration chromatography (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000599-g002">Figure 2C</xref>). This revealed that whereas wild-type mFTO and CmFTO exist in both monomeric and dimeric forms, both I367A variants exist, at least predominantly, as monomers. These results suggest that I367 is involved in dimerisation of FTO (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000599-g002">Figure 2C</xref>). It was not possible to analyse mFTO<sup>I367F</sup> or CmFTO<sup>I367F</sup> because of their insoluble nature.</p><p>The secondary structure of the <italic>C</italic>-terminal domain was then investigated using circular dichroism spectroscopy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000599-g002">Figure 2D</xref>). In contrast to the full-length proteins, which contain the DSBH &#x0201c;core&#x0201d; domain of the 2OG oxygenases (comprising 8 &#x003b2;-strands with surrounding loops and &#x003b1;-helices), the <italic>C</italic>-terminal domain proteins are predominantly &#x003b1;-helical (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000599.s004">Figure S4</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000599.s005">Figure S5</xref>). A similar structural difference was observed for hFTO and its <italic>C</italic>-terminal domain (residues 332-end; ChFTO, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000599.s006">Figure S6</xref>). The I367A mutation does not appear to alter the overall secondary structure fold of mFTO proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000599-g002">Figure 2D</xref>), despite preventing dimerisation. This suggests that the I367A proteins are correctly folded, but that isoleucine 367 is involved in dimer formation. Factor Inhibiting Hypoxia Inducible Factor (FIH), a human 2OG-oxygenase involved in the hypoxic response, also exists as a dimer <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000599-Lancaster1">&#x0005b;26&#x0005d;</xref>. For FIH, dimerisation is enabled by a <italic>C</italic>-terminal region. However, sequence comparisons, coupled with structural predictions, suggest that the <italic>C</italic>-terminal region of FTO and FIH will be substantially different, with that of FTO having a more &#x003b1;-helical character.</p><p>Overall, these results reveal that FTO can exist in both monomeric and dimeric forms and that the <italic>C</italic>-terminal domain is involved in dimerisation. The evidence suggests that the I367A (and presumably I367F) mutation disrupts dimerisation and results in a reduction of catalytic activity. In addition to the presumed lower activity of mFTO<sup>I367F</sup>, we cannot exclude the possibility that a reduced stability of mFTO<sup>I367F</sup>, leading to aggregation and/or proteolytic degradation, contributes to the phenotype.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>The Mutant FTO Protein Is Localised to the Nucleus and Expressed at Lower Levels in Mammalian Cells</title><p>To establish if mFTO<sup>I367F</sup> is stable in mammalian cells we transfected Cos-7 and PC12 cell lines with a plasmid encoding <italic>Fto</italic> or <italic>Fto<sup>I367F</sup> N</italic>-terminally tagged with yellow florescent protein (YFP), or with YFP alone. Imaging revealed that like mFTO <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000599-Gerken1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>, mFTO<sup>I367F</sup> localised to the nucleus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000599-g003">Figure 3A</xref> and data not shown). However, fewer YFP-positive cells were observed than when mFTO was transfected, suggesting mFTO<sup>I367F</sup> is expressed at lower levels. This was confirmed by immunoblotting of lysates from cells expressing HA-tagged wild-type or mutant FTO (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000599-g003">Figure 3B</xref>).

However, because heterozygous and homozygous <italic>Fto<sup>I367F</sup></italic> mice exhibited a similar phenotype, it appears that an mFTO<sup>I367F</sup> protein can exert a dominant negative effect on mFTO function, possibly by disrupting the wild-type mFTO subunit by formation of a heterodimeric protein complex (i.e. an antimorphic allele).</p><p>ER stress genes were among those genes whose expression was increased in the liver of 16-week old homozygous <italic>Fto<sup>I367F</sup></italic> mice.

However, the fact that food intake and physical activity of <italic>Fto<sup>I367F</sup></italic> mice are normal indicates their lean phenotype is unlikely to be a consequence of illness or general malaise. In contrast, the I367F mutation produced a marked increase in whole body metabolism, with both O<sub>2</sub> consumption and CO<sub>2</sub> production being stimulated. This argues that the changes in fat mass are produced by differences in metabolism. Interestingly, RER increased from 0.87 to 0.9 during the dark period (when the mice are active). This is consistent with a switch from fat metabolism (RER&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;0.7) towards protein (RER&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;0.9) and/or carbohydrate (RER&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;1.0) metabolism, which most likely reflects the fact that mutant animals have smaller fat depots.</p><p>We found some evidence for alterations in catecholamines and sympathetic nervous system activity that are consistent with an increased metabolic rate. The increased glucagon level of Fto<sup>I367F</sup> mice further supports an increased sympathetic tone (as this stimulates glucagon secretion).</p><p>On either a standard or a high-fat diet, <italic>Fto<sup>I367F</sup></italic> mice exhibited reduced fat mass, unchanged food intake, and increased serum leptin, glucose, glucagon and lipid serum levels compared with wild-type mice. However the lean mass of <italic>Fto<sup>I367F</sup></italic> mice was greater than that of wild-type on a high-fat diet, whereas no differences were observed on a normal diet. Consequently, overall weight was not significantly different between <italic>Fto<sup>I367F</sup></italic> and wild-type mice on a high fat diet. It is striking that that despite the reduction in protein and carbohydrate, the lean mass of <italic>Fto<sup>I367F</sup></italic> mice increases on the high-fat diet. All mice on the high-fat diet have a higher fat mass than on a standard diet, although the <italic>Fto<sup>I367F</sup></italic> mutation affords some protection against increased adiposity.</p><p>Finally, we did not observe any differences in metabolic rate between genotypes given a high-fat diet, suggesting that the increased fat metabolism (particularly in wild-type mice) masks the differences observed on a standard diet. The RERs on the high-fat diet were all reduced, as expected due to the relatively higher fat metabolism. However, the active (night) phase RER was significantly higher in <italic>Fto<sup>I367F</sup></italic> than wild-type mice fed a high-fat (or standard) diet, indicating a switch in substrate use towards carbohydrate.</p><p>How the <italic>Fto<sup>I367F</sup></italic> mutation enhances metabolism requires further study. Nevertheless, it is interesting that other Fe(II) and 2OG oxygenases are involved in fat metabolism <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000599-Vaz1">&#x0005b;34&#x0005d;</xref>. Given that the amount of adipose tissue is significantly reduced in <italic>Fto<sup>I367F</sup></italic> mice, the increased expression of genes involved in lipid metabolism pathways can be interpreted to suggest that fatty acid catabolism dominates in WAT and is the primary cause of reduced WAT levels, and that changes in levels of anabolic genes are a secondary effect. Overall, enhanced fat metabolism in WAT may not contribute to RER as much as in wildtype animals because of the reduced fat mass in <italic>Fto<sup>I367F</sup></italic> mice.</p><p>Gene expression analysis showed a slight increase in carbohydrate metabolic genes in muscle of <italic>Fto<sup>I367F</sup></italic> mice. This might contribute to the phenotype of these mice as they exhibit a higher metabolic rate and higher RER. It is also possible that these changes are secondary to changes in substrate supply to muscle, produced by changes in nutrient storage in WAT and liver. The elevation of fatty acid synthase (<italic>Fasn</italic>) levels suggests that fat synthesis could be enhanced in muscle. However, there was no obvious increase in fat storage in this tissue so this change may be a secondary consequence of a decreased supply of fatty acids to muscle resulting from the lean phenotype.</p><p>A reduction in expression of genes involved in the inflammatory response is consistent with the lean phenotype of the <italic>Fto<sup>I367F</sup></italic> mice and may reflect concomitant reduction of macrophages residing in WAT.

Nevertheless, because a missense point mutation is unlikely to affect the expression of adjacent genes, the phenotype of our mice provides strong support for the idea that FTO function does regulate body weight and further reinforces the evidence from the mouse knockout. By showing that FTO affects whole body metabolism, they provide the basis for further studies designed to elucidate the molecular mechanism of how FTO influences body weight. The observation that impaired FTO function results in a lean phenotype also suggests that inhibition of FTO may be of therapeutic interest in relation to morbid obesity.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>ENU Mutation in Exon 6</title><p>The Harwell ENU-DNA archive (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.har.mrc.ac.uk/services/dna_archive/">http://www.har.mrc.ac.uk/services/dna_archive/</ext-link>) was screened by denaturing high performance liquid chromatography (dHPLC) using a Transgenomic WAVE system <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000599-Quwailid1">&#x0005b;25&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000599-Shimomura1">&#x0005b;35&#x0005d;</xref>.
