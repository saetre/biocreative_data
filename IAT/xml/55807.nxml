It requires the interaction of several proteins and small ribonucleoprotein particles, which all function in concert. These components recognize exon&#x02013;intron boundaries at both 5&#x02032; and 3&#x02032; splice sites and then produce the necessary reactions to ligate the exons involved. Two kinds of splicing are observed in nature. <italic>Cis</italic>-splicing, by which introns from the same pre-mRNA are removed, and <italic>trans</italic>-splicing, in which two pre-mRNAs are processed to produce a mature transcript that contains exons from both precursors. The <italic>trans</italic>-splicing process has been described mostly in trypanosome, nematodes, plant&#x0002f;algal chloroplasts and plant mitochondria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke428c1">1</xref>).</p><p> A family of serine&#x02013;arginine-rich RNA binding proteins, known as SR proteins, plays a critical role in the formation of active spliceosomes. The SR proteins recognize exonic splicing enhancers (ESEs) promoting both constitutive and regulated splicing by bringing the flanking splice sites. <italic>Trans</italic>-splicing efficiency may correlate with the presence of these ESE sequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke428c2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke428c3">3</xref>). <italic>Trans</italic>-splicing <italic>in vitro</italic> only occurs when the 3&#x02032; exon contains ESE sequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke428c4">4</xref>).</p><p> In the course of our research, natural <italic>trans</italic>-splicing was observed in rat carnitine octanoyltransferase (COT) pre-mRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke428c5">5</xref>). This mechanism produces three different transcripts: one produced by <italic>cis</italic>-splicing and two produced by <italic>trans</italic>-splicing, in which exons 2 and 3 are repeated. Western blot analysis of peroxisomal proteins revealed two translated proteins with molecular masses which may correspond to the <italic>cis</italic>-spliced as well as the <italic>trans</italic>-spliced RNAs in which exons 2 and 3 are repeated. Recently, <italic>trans</italic>-splicing corresponding to other genes has been observed in mammals. In some cases, mature mRNAs containing a mixture of exons from different genes have been observed; this transcript heterogeneity may contribute to phenotypic variation in mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke428c6">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke428c12">12</xref>).</p><p> In this report we show that, in contrast to rat, other mammals such as human, mouse, pig, cow and Cos7 cells of monkey do not produce detectable <italic>trans</italic>-splicing of the COT gene. We also show that <italic>trans</italic>-splicing in rat COT is not due to any metabolic, nutritional, hormonal or developmental condition. <italic>Trans</italic>-splicing in rat is attributable in part to the occurrence of an ESE sequence (GAAGAAG). <italic>Trans</italic>-splicing is not found in other mammals, which have a conserved sequence, AAAAAAA, instead. Splicing experiments <italic>in vitro</italic>, in which the rat putative ESE sequence (GAAGAAG) was mutated either to a random sequence or to AAAAAAA, revealed a marked decrease in <italic>trans</italic>-splicing of the COT pre-mRNA. Moreover, when the human COT exon 2 box AAAAAAA was mutated to GAAGAAG <italic>in vitro</italic> a marked increase in <italic>trans</italic>-splicing was observed. <italic>In vivo</italic> experiments also showed that mutation of the GAAGAAG strongly decreased <italic>trans</italic>-splicing. This shows that the evolution from AAAAAAA to GAAGAAG, which does not affect the protein sequence, enabled the rat to produce <italic>trans</italic>-splicing of the COT pre-mRNA.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Rat treatment</title><p>Groups of adult rats, weighing 200&#x02013;250 g (three for each treatment) were fed for 7 days with a fat diet or a diet supplemented with diethylhexylphthalate (DEHP) as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke428c13">13</xref>), or injected i.p. with insulin (40 U&#x0002f;kg body weight) and killed at 30 min.</p></sec><sec><title>Northern blot analysis and RNase H digestion of total RNA</title><p>Total RNA from different samples used was extracted with guanidine isothiocyanate and purified by centrifugation through a CsCl cushion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke428c14">14</xref>).

Construct F was prepared by the megaprimer technique taking construct A as template. Primers for the first amplification were E2.f and MutESE3.r. In the second amplification primer I2.r was used. The constructs G, H, I and J were obtained by PCR amplifications using genomic DNA obtained from human liver. The primers were designed using the human COT cDNA sequence AF168793 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke428c17">17</xref>) and the genomic sequence ACC005045 from the DDBJ&#x0002f;EMBL&#x0002f;GenBank database that contains the human COT genomic sequence. PCR was performed in a total volume of 50 &#x000b5;l with 300 ng of genomic DNA, 1 mM of each primer and <italic>Pfu</italic> polymerase. The conditions for PCR were 94&#x000b0;C for 5 min followed by 30 cycles of 94&#x000b0;C for 45 s, 53&#x000b0;C for 45 s and 72&#x000b0;C for 1 min.

The products of <italic>trans</italic>-splicing were loaded on a denaturing 6&#x00025; polyacrylamide&#x0002f;7 M urea gel. Autoradiographs of the labeled bands in the gels were scanned with a Molecular Dynamics laser densitometer using the internal integration to determine peak areas with the ImageQuant program and also with the PhosphorImager technique. The percentage inhibition was calculated from the values of the integration areas of the bands.</p></sec><sec><title>Preparation of COT minigene constructs, cell culture and transfections</title><p>A minigene containing several regions of the rat COT gene (construct E2E3COT, seen in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke428f8">8</xref>) was created by <italic>Pfu</italic> polymerase (Clontech) PCR amplification of 1 ng from genomic DNA &#x003bb;GA5 clone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke428c5">5</xref>). To amplify different fragments of this minigene, several primers were used. Primers I1.f (5&#x02032;-CATGGGGGTGCTAAATCCACA-3&#x02032;) and I2.r (5&#x02032;-CTACACTAGAAGATTATGAAGATAC-3&#x02032;) amplify a fragment containing 125 nt of the 3&#x02032; region of intron 1 (which contains the branch point), the whole of exon 2 and 25 nt of the 5&#x02032; splice site of intron 2. Primers I2.f (5&#x02032;-GCATTGCAGTTTTCACATTGCC-3&#x02032;) and COT291.r (5&#x02032;-CCAGTTTCTTTTTCCTTTAGCCC-3&#x02032;) amplify a fragment containing 115 nt of the 3&#x02032;&#x000a0;splice site of intron 2 (containing the branch point) and the whole of exon 3. Products were cloned into the <italic>Eco</italic>RV site in plasmid pcDNA3 (Invitrogen) and sequenced. A mutated minigene of E2E3COT (E2E3COT-ESEmut) was obtained by using the site-directed mutagenesis kit from Stratagene. The primers used were COTE2G&#x0002f;A.f (5&#x02032;-CCGTTCCTTCGCTTGAAGAATCACTAAAAAAATACCTTGAGTCAG-3&#x02032;) and COTE2G&#x0002f;A.r (5&#x02032;-CTGACTCAAGGTATTTTTTTAGTGATTCTTCAAGCGAAGGAACGG-3&#x02032;). The introduction of mutations of the E2E3COT-ESEmut minigene was confirmed by sequencing.</p><p> HeLa cells were cultured in Dulbecco&#x02019;s modified Eagle&#x02019;s medium supplemented with 10&#x00025; (v&#x0002f;v) fetal bovine serum, 100&#x000a0;i.u.&#x0002f;ml penicillin and 100 &#x000b5;g&#x0002f;ml streptomycin. The cells were cultured in 65 mm plates. Cells (1.6 &#x000d7; 10<sup>6</sup>) were transiently transfected with 5 &#x000b5;g of either E2E3COT plasmid or E2E3COT-ESEmut plasmid. Plasmid dosage was kept constant by the addition of an appropriate amount of DNA salmon sperm. Plasmid pCMVbGAL (cytomegalovirus promoter &#x003b2;-galactosidase; 3 &#x000b5;g) was included as an internal control in co-transfections. Transfection experiments were performed by the calcium phosphate method as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke428c14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke428c18">18</xref>). After incubation for a further 24 h the cells were collected and RNA was extracted by trizol reagent (Bethesda Research Laboratories). Each series of experiments was performed at least four times and each transfection was performed in triplicate. RNA samples were treated with DNase I to eliminate the plasmidic DNA from transfection as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke428c5">5</xref>). The <italic>cis</italic>- and <italic>trans</italic>-spliced mRNA of rat COT was analyzed by RT&#x02013;PCR.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>RESULTS</title><sec><title>Of the various mammals studied only the rat produced <italic>trans</italic>-splicing</title><p>The occurrence of <italic>trans</italic>-splicing in exons 2 and 3 of the rat COT pre-mRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke428c5">5</xref>) produced two different transcripts, with the following compositions: exon1&#x02013;exon2&#x02013;exon2&#x02013;exon3 etc. and exon1&#x02013;exon2&#x02013;exon3&#x02013;exon2&#x02013;exon3 etc., in addition to the <italic>cis</italic>-spliced transcript (exon1&#x02013;exon2&#x02013;exon3 etc.). This phenomenon was observed both <italic>in vivo</italic> and<italic> in vitro</italic>. We thus attempted to determine: (i) whether <italic>trans</italic>-splicing of the COT gene occurs in other mammals, and (ii) the molecular basis for this phenomenon in the rat.</p><p> We first amplified mRNAs by RT&#x02013;PCR from several mammals, among them human, pig, cow, mouse and Cos cells from monkey (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke428f1">1</xref>). A single band was observed in all cases. This band was obtained whether the primers used were from rat (not shown) or cow. The band of each species was excised from the gel and, after sequencing, it was found to correspond to the <italic>cis</italic>-spliced transcript. The sequences of exon 2 of the COT gene from mouse, Cos7 cells and pig are shown in Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="gke428tb1">1</xref> together with those of human, cow and rat. The amplification of the rat mRNAs, using primers from either cow (not shown) or rat, shows the three-band pattern that corresponds to <italic>cis</italic>- and <italic>trans</italic>-spliced transcripts, as expected.</p></sec><sec><title><italic>Trans</italic>-splicing in rat COT depends on the gene sequence and not on sex, development or metabolic condition</title><p>Once it had been established that only the rat produced <italic>trans</italic>-splicing (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke428f1">1</xref>), we examined whether the <italic>trans</italic>-splicing observed for rat COT could be either tissue-dependent or produced as a result of metabolic alteration, or dependent on sex or development. RT&#x02013;PCR amplification of transcripts from rat liver and intestine gave the three-transcript pattern (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke428f2">2</xref>), which was also observed in other tissues such as testis, kidney, heart and brown adipose tissue (data not shown). We then performed RT amplifications of total RNAs from rats at different developmental stages: fetuses of 20 days, and suckling rats of 1, 9 and 21 days of age. The COT mRNA levels during the suckling period are transcriptionally regulated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke428c19">19</xref>). These developmental studies in liver and intestine also showed the three-band pattern (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke428f2">2</xref>). The variability in the relative proportion of the three transcripts had been observed before (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke428c5">5</xref>), but no explanation has been found. Both male and female adult rats (six animals in each case) also gave three mature transcripts of the COT gene (data not shown). Groups of three rats were treated with insulin or fed with a fat diet, or with a diet supplemented with DEHP, a peroxisomal proliferator, as described in Materials and Methods. These treatments produced small changes in the COT mRNA levels with respect to controls (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke428f3">3</xref>A) except DEHP treatment, which produced a 12-fold increase. Total RNAs were incubated with a specific primer and digested with RNase H (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke428f3">3</xref>B). Once more, the three mature transcripts corresponding to <italic>cis</italic>- and <italic>trans</italic>-splicing were also observed. All these results taken together suggest that <italic>trans</italic>-splicing in rat COT depends on the gene sequence rather than on any metabolic, nutritional, hormonal or developmental condition.</p></sec><sec><title>Identification of possible ESEs in exon 2 which may promote <italic>trans</italic>-splicing in experiments <italic>in vitro</italic></title><p>The occurrence of an ESE sequence in the acceptor exon is necessary for artificial <italic>trans</italic>-splicing to occur (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke428c2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke428c3">3</xref>). Splicing enhancers facilitate the assembly of protein complexes on pre-mRNAs containing a 3&#x02032; splice site, and these complexes are sufficiently stable to interact with 5&#x02032; splice sites located in other RNA molecules. By examination of rat COT exon 2, at least two purine-rich sequences were identified at positions 79 (GAAGAACGAA, named upstream box) and 147 (GAAGAAG, named downstream box) (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="gke428tb1">1</xref>), which are similar to ESE sequences previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke428c20">20</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke428c22">22</xref>).</p><p> To assess the individual roles of the downstream and upstream boxes in <italic>trans</italic>-splicing, different truncated pre-mRNAs were prepared: a wild-type donor pre-mRNA containing only exon 2 and the 5&#x02032; splice site of intron 2 (construct A), and a wild-type acceptor pre-mRNA, containing the branch-point region, the 3&#x02032;&#x000a0;splice site of intron 1 and exon 2 (construct B) (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke428f4">4</xref>). We then separately mutated the upstream and the downstream boxes of the rat exon 2 in construct B. The sequence GAAGAA of the upstream box (construct B) was changed to GTCTAC (construct C), and the sequence GAAGAAG of the downstream box was changed to GCATCTG (construct D).</p><p> Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke428f4">4</xref> shows <italic>trans</italic>-splicing assays with the combination of donor construct A with acceptor constructs B, C and D. The donor pre-mRNA (construct A) was <sup>32</sup>P-labeled during transcription <italic>in vitro</italic> and the unlabeled acceptors were added to the <italic>trans</italic>-splicing reaction. The combination of donor A with acceptor C (random mutated upstream box) produced slight changes in the <italic>trans</italic>-splicing product <italic>in vitro</italic> when compared with the A&#x000d7;B product (lanes 7&#x02013;9 and lanes 3&#x02013;5). However, the <italic>trans</italic>-splicing between donor A and acceptor D (random mutated downstream box) was reduced by 60&#x00025; (compare lanes 11&#x02013;13 with lanes 3&#x02013;5). Mutation of both upstream and downstream boxes did not modify <italic>trans</italic>-splicing when compared with results of the downstream ESE box (data not shown). These results show that the downstream box behaves as an ESE sequence, while the upstream box does not seem to contribute to the process.</p></sec><sec><title>Mutation of downstream rat ESE sequence to the sequence observed in other mammals strongly decreases <italic>trans</italic>-splicing <italic>in vitro</italic></title><p>We first compared the composition of the rat COT exon 2 sequence with the corresponding sequences from those mammals in which <italic>trans</italic>-splicing did not occur (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="gke428tb1">1</xref>). The upstream box in these mammals differed only slightly (0, 1 or 2 nucleotides changed) from that in the rat. In contrast, the downstream box was invariably AAAAAAA, whereas in rat it was GAAGAAG. Taken together, these results emphasize the relevance of the downstream ESE box in <italic>trans</italic>-splicing. We attempted to assess whether the change of GAAGAAG (present in rat exon 2) to AAAAAAA (seen in all the other mammals studied) is responsible for the absence of <italic>trans</italic>-splicing in these species. To this end, three types of experiments were performed. In the first, <italic>in vitro</italic><italic>trans</italic>-splicing was carried out with constructs of rat exon 2 in which the downstream box GAAGAAG was mutated to AAAAAAA, to see whether this mutation decreased <italic>trans</italic>-splicing. In the second sets of experiments, the AAAAAAA box of human exon 2 was mutated to GAAGAAG, to see whether there was a gain of function. The third set of experiments showed that rat COT minigenes transfected in HeLa cells produced <italic>trans</italic>-splicing <italic>in&#x000a0;vivo</italic>, and that mutation of the GAAGAAG box abolished the phenomenon.</p><p> To perform the first experiment two truncated pre-mRNAs were also prepared: construct E, in which the downstream box in rat construct B was mutated to AAAAAAA, and construct F, in which the rat donor construct A was also mutated in the downstream box to AAAAAAA. Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke428f5">5</xref> shows that the <italic>in&#x000a0;vitro</italic> combination of donor F and acceptor E, which reflects what is produced <italic>in vivo</italic> in mammals other than the rat, inhibits <italic>trans</italic>-splicing (50&#x00025;) as compared with the wild-type <italic>trans</italic>-splicing (donor A and acceptor B) (see lanes 8&#x02013;10 and 3&#x02013;5).</p></sec><sec><title>Mutation of human downstream box sequence to the sequence observed in rat strongly increased <italic>trans</italic>-splicing <italic>in vitro</italic></title><p>To analyze the role of the rat COT downstream ESE sequence, four new truncated pre-mRNAs were prepared: a donor human pre-mRNA containing only human exon 2 and the 5&#x02032; splice site of intron 2 (construct G), and an acceptor human pre-mRNA, containing the branch point region, the 3&#x02032; splice site of intron 1 and exon 2 (construct H) (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke428f6">6</xref>). We then mutated the downstream AAAAAAA box of the human exon 2 in constructs G and H so that this human sequence was changed to GAAGAAG (seen in rat) (constructs J and I, respectively). The combination of constructs G and H corresponding to the natural human exon 2 only produced <italic>trans</italic>-splicing when a high amount of acceptor was present (lanes 8&#x02013;11). The combination of mutated human exon 2 as a donor with non-mutated human acceptor exon 2 (J&#x000d7;H) only slightly increased the <italic>trans</italic>-splicing reaction (16&#x00025;) (see lanes 19&#x02013;22). The combination of donor construct G with acceptor I, in which the rat ESE box was present in human exon 2 (lanes 3&#x02013;6), increased <italic>trans</italic>-splicing (60&#x00025;) compared with combination of constructs G&#x000d7;H as in the rat, suggesting that the rat ESE box induces <italic>trans</italic>-splicing when present in the acceptor exon 2. Similar <italic>trans</italic>-splicing was produced when constructs J&#x000d7;I (both containing the mutated GAAGAAG) (lanes 14&#x02013;17) reacted <italic>in&#x000a0;vitro</italic> (60&#x00025;). This gain of function is attributable exclusively to the rat COT exon 2 downstream ESE, which appears to promote <italic>trans</italic>-splicing.</p></sec><sec><title>Relevance of the rat downstream ESE in heterologous <italic>trans</italic>-splicing <italic>in vitro</italic></title><p>To test the relevance of the rat COT exon 2 ESE sequence in heterologous <italic>trans</italic>-splicing, wild-type rat donor COT exon 2 (construct A1) was reacted with human acceptor COT exon 2 (construct H) in the same conditions. No <italic>trans</italic>-splicing product was observed (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke428f7">7</xref>, lanes 1&#x02013;3). When the human acceptor COT exon 2 was mutated in the downstream box AAAAAAA to the rat ESE GAAGAAG (construct I), <italic>trans</italic>-splicing occurred (compare lanes 4&#x02013;6 with 1&#x02013;3). This experiment showed that, on the one hand, rat COT exon 2 as a donor does not by itself produce <italic>trans</italic>-splicing when it reacts with a human acceptor (lacking the ESE box). On the other hand, when the human construct is mutated in the corresponding box AAAAAAA with the rat ESE sequence (GAAGAAG) <italic>trans</italic>-splicing is produced.</p></sec><sec><title>Mutation of rat COT exon 2 ESE sequence to the sequence observed in COT exon 2 from other mammals strongly decreases <italic>trans</italic>-splicing <italic>in vivo</italic></title><p>To test the role of the rat COT exon 2 ESE sequence in <italic>trans</italic>-splicing <italic>in vivo</italic>, HeLa cells were transfected with two rat COT minigenes (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke428f8">8</xref>A). The first of these minigenes contained the rat COT exon 2 ESE sequence (GAAGAAG) intact and the second was identical to the first but the ESE sequence had been mutated to AAAAAAA. After 24 h, total RNA was isolated from transfected cells and RT&#x02013;PCR amplification was performed with specific primers to detect either the formation of <italic>trans</italic>-spliced mRNA (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke428f8">8</xref>B, left) or the simultaneous formation of <italic>cis</italic>- and <italic>trans</italic>-spliced mRNAs (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke428f8">8</xref>B, right).</p><p> Transfected HeLa cells produced a <italic>trans</italic>-spliced band (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke428f8">8</xref>B, wt, left) composed of exon2&#x02013;exon2&#x02013;exon3, which was not produced when the ESE sequence GAAGAAG was mutated to AAAAAAA (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke428f8">8</xref>B, Mut, left). The RT&#x02013;PCR amplified bands using a different set of primers that involve exon 2 and exon 3 show that in addition to <italic>trans</italic>-splicing, <italic>cis</italic>-spliced bands exon2&#x02013;exon3 were also produced. In the conditions of the experiment, <italic>cis</italic>-spliced bands were stronger than <italic>trans</italic>-spliced bands, showing that <italic>cis</italic>-splicing is preferred over <italic>trans</italic>-splicing. When the rat COT ESE sequence was mutated, both the <italic>cis</italic>- and the <italic>trans</italic>-splicing were affected, but while the <italic>cis</italic>-splicing was slightly decreased, <italic>trans</italic>-splicing disappeared (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke428f8">8</xref>B, right). Any of the sets of primers used could amplify endogenous HeLa COT. These experiments show that the splicing produced <italic>in vitro</italic> was also reproduced <italic>in vivo</italic>, and that the ESE sequence GAAGAAG plays a role in <italic>trans</italic>-splicing both <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>, since its mutation to the sequence observed in other mammals decreases <italic>trans</italic>-splicing.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>The occurrence of natural <italic>trans</italic>-splicing in the rat COT pre-mRNAs, producing two different transcripts involving repetition of exons 2 and 3, had been reported previously by our group (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke428c5">5</xref>). The question was then to determine the molecular basis of this phenomenon. One possibility was that metabolic, sexual or developmental factors might be responsible for <italic>trans</italic>-splicing. However, the present study clearly shows that all conditions tested determine the generation of natural <italic>trans</italic>-splicing. These results emphasize that the characteristics of the gene are responsible for such phenomena.</p><p> The occurrence of <italic>in vivo</italic><italic>trans</italic>-splicing in the rat COT gene and its absence in other mammals is surprising. The simplest explanation was that some structural feature was present in the rat COT gene and not present in other mammals. In one type of <italic>trans</italic>-splicing an intron of one pre-mRNA interacts with an intron of a second pre-mRNA, enhancing the recombination of splice sites between two pre-mRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke428c23">23</xref>). This is not the case in the COT pre-mRNA constructs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke428c5">5</xref>), which do not require intronic RNA&#x02013;RNA interactions among substrates. Another explanation is that the COT gene requires specialized elements such as ESEs for <italic>trans</italic>-splicing to occur.</p><p> The examination of exon 2 of the rat COT gene revealed two purine-rich sequences, which may facilitate the <italic>trans</italic>-splicing reaction as ESEs. Accordingly, we independently mutated these two putative ESE sequences and observed the effects on <italic>trans</italic>-splicing<italic> in vitro</italic>. The upstream sequence, which was nearly identical in the COT exon 2 of all mammals sequenced, did not produce any quantitative change in <italic>trans</italic>-splicing after mutation, from which we concluded that, by itself, it was not responsible for the <italic>trans</italic>-splicing observed in the rat.</p><p> Different behavior was observed in downstream rat exon 2 ESE sequence GAAGAAG, which was different from that seen in the rest of the mammals studied, which is invariably AAAAAAA<italic>. </italic>Experiments <italic>in vitro</italic> with the randomly mutated downstream ESE produced a marked decrease in <italic>trans</italic>-splicing (residual capacity 40&#x00025;) with respect to control. These results were confirmed by the mutation of the rat downstream ESE sequence to AAAAAAA. Once more, this mutation decreased <italic>trans</italic>-splicing by 50&#x00025;. From this study it is clear that sequence GAAGAAG in exon 2 of the rat COT gene strongly increases <italic>trans</italic>-splicing.</p><p> The experiments of <italic>trans</italic>-splicing with human COT exon 2 illustrate the relevance of the ESE GAAGAAG sequence in <italic>trans</italic>-splicing. The inclusion of the putative rat downstream ESE sequence, instead of that naturally found in human, restored the ability of human exon 2 to produce <italic>trans</italic>-splicing, since there was a marked increase in <italic>trans</italic>-splicing compared to control. This was confirmed in heterologous <italic>trans</italic>-splicing <italic>in vitro</italic>, in which the inclusion of the rat ESE sequence GAAGAAG instead of the human AAAAAAA sequence induced to human exon 2 to produce <italic>trans</italic>-splicing when interacting with the rat exon 2.</p><p> To confirm these results <italic>in vitro</italic>, a set of experiments was performed <italic>in vivo</italic>. Rat COT minigenes containing regions of intron 1, exon 2, intron 2 and exon 3 produced <italic>trans</italic>-splicing in transfected HeLa cells. These constructs also produced <italic>cis</italic>-spliced products in a much higher amount than <italic>trans</italic>-spliced products. This could be shown because under competitive conditions PCR amplifications showed stronger <italic>cis</italic>-spliced bands. Importantly, mutation in the ESE box abolished <italic>trans</italic>-splicing bands <italic>in vivo</italic>. Moreover, the mutation of the ESE band also decreased <italic>cis</italic>-splicing, although to a lesser extent than <italic>trans</italic>-splicing. This result is not surprising since the influence of ESE boxes on <italic>cis</italic>-splicing is well documented.</p><p> Previous experiments with artificial genes had shown that ESE enhancers activate <italic>trans</italic>-splicing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke428c2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke428c3">3</xref>). Moreover, ESE enhancers are also necessary for many <italic>cis</italic>-splicing reactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke428c20">20</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke428c22">22</xref>), which they trigger by binding to SR proteins, a family of modular splicing factors bearing one or more RNA recognition motifs and an arginine&#x0002f;serine (RS)-rich region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke428c24">24</xref>). Curiously, previous <italic>cis</italic>-splicing experiments showed that if an SR-dependent enhancer is changed either to (AAAAAAGGGGGG)<sub>2</sub> or poly(A) the <italic>cis</italic>-splicing reaction is inhibited (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke428c25">25</xref>). Recently, it was also shown that when another enhancer, activated by SR proteins, from the the human &#x003b2;-globin pre-mRNA, is changed to AAAAAAA, the <italic>cis</italic>-splicing reaction is also inhibited (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke428c21">21</xref>). These observations indicate that the function of SR proteins is compromised if the enhancer sequence is changed to AAAAAAA. From an evolutionary point of view, we can postulate that there was a mutation in the COT gene in rat as a result of which it produced <italic>trans</italic>-splicing and thus generated two peroxisomal proteins. It is important to stress that no change is produced in the encoded protein when GAAGAAG is mutated to AAAAAAA (in both cases the predicted sequence is Leu&#x02013;Lys&#x02013;Lys). Thus, overlapping protein coding in rat and RNA recognition elements to facilitate <italic>trans</italic>-splicing may be co-selected during evolution to acquire the encoding of a new protein with unknown catalytic properties or cellular localization. This is the first report of the occurrence of an ESE box that enhances <italic>trans</italic>-splicing in mammals.</p></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="display-objects"><title>Figures and Tables</title><fig id="gke428f1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p> RT&#x02013;PCR amplification of COT mRNAs in various mammals.
