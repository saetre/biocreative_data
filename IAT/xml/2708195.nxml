Along with isocitrate lyase, which catalyses the aldol cleavage of isocitrate to succinate and glyoxylate, this enzyme constitutes the glyoxylate bypass of the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Apart from replenishing the TCA cycle intermediates (anaplerotic role), the glyoxylate cycle is essential for growth on acetyl CoA (from fatty acids or from acetate) as a sole carbon source by bypassing two decarboxylation steps of the TCA cycle. Therefore, the carbon imported in the glyoxylate cycle as acetyl is not lost as CO<sub>2 </sub>&#x02013; as would happen in the TCA cycle &#x02013; but incorporated into intermediates of the cycle, which are available for anabolism. The net result is the conversion of two molecules acetyl CoA into one molecule of succinate. Because the glyoxylate cycle includes two oxidative steps, it also provides some energy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>].</p><p>Recently, Fischer and Sauer reported that malate synthase is an important component of the phosphoenolpyruvate-glyoxylate cycle in <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>, which functions under conditions of glucose hunger [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. In addition, it serves an anaplerotic role in glycolate oxidation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. In several microorganisms, the glyoxylate bypass is of general importance to microbial pathogenesis. Persistence of <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis </italic>is facilitated by the glyoxylate bypass [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>], whereas this metabolic pathway is required for high virulence of <italic>Candida albicans </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. The ability of these organisms to utilize fatty acids as a carbon and energy source seems crucial to their survival in the infected host. Although it is widely accepted that the glyoxylate cycle operates in bacteria, fungi, some protists, and plants, the claim that the glyoxylate cycle is functionally active in higher animals remains controversial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. In <italic>E. coli </italic>two isoenzymes have been identified: <italic>aceB </italic>encodes the malate synthase A involved in acetate metabolism whereas <italic>glcB </italic>encodes the malate synthase G (MSG) involved in glycolate metabolism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa </italic>is predicted to encode MSG (<italic>glcB </italic>or PA0482 gene) but not type A [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>].</p><p>The expression of <italic>glcB </italic>of <italic>P. aeruginosa </italic>is upregulated during infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>] and the malate synthase activity is implicated in twitching-mediated chemotaxis towards phospholipids and fatty acids [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>].

After one hour preincubation at 55&#x000b0;C, enzymatic activity was approximately halved (53% drop). Higher preincubation temperatures (70&#x000b0;C, 85&#x000b0;C and 99&#x000b0;C) caused complete loss of malate synthase activity (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Influence of pH on the activity and stability of MSG</title><p>The pH optimum of MSG was investigated using standard conditions (an incubation temperature of 37&#x000b0;C). To eliminate a possible influence of the buffering components on the enzymatic activity, a universal buffer containing three different buffering agents (citrate, Tris and borate) was used. The MSG activity is maximal between pH 8 and 9 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3C</xref>). At a pH of 7 and 10, 87 and 85% of the activity is retained, respectively. However, outside this pH range (below pH 7 and above pH 10) the activity decreases fast. Below pH 6 no activity remains (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3C</xref>).</p><p>The pH dependency of MSG stability was determined by preincubation of the enzyme for one hour at a specific pH and subsequently diluting the enzyme 100-fold before assaying the enzymatic activity at pH 7.5. Stability of MSG was maximal after a preincubation at pH 6 and 7 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3D</xref>). When preincubating the enzyme in more basic buffer (pH 8 to pH 11), the stability gradually dropped (at pH 11, still 90% of the activity was retained).

Different combinations of substrate (acetyl CoA and gloxylate) concentrations were assayed, whereas the other conditions remained constant (pH 7.5, 25&#x000b0;C, the amount of MSG). For each combination, the velocities were determined. The MSG-catalyzed reaction generated linear Lineweaver-Burk plots over the concentration range tested. Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5A</xref> shows these plots with respect to glyoxylate at various concentrations of acetyl CoA.

In addition, the deletion mutant shows somewhat reduced growth on rich medium, probably reflecting its anaplerotic role in the TCA cycle and its role in the phosphoenolpyruvate-glyoxylate cycle, as described by Fischer and Sauer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. An efficient and straightforward procedure for the purification of untagged MSG was developed. Removal of the GST tag rules out possible interference of the tag with the enzymatic activity of the enzyme. In addition, the quantity and the purity of the tagless enzyme are suitable for crystallography of <italic>P. aeruginosa </italic>MSG.</p><p>Subsequently, the purified MSG activity was characterized biochemically. The temperature optimum and stability show that the enzyme behaves like a typical mesophylic protein, since these parameters indicate a rapid and irreversible inactivation of MSG. The reduction in thermal stability from 55&#x000b0;C on is in agreement with the steep decline in enzymatic activity at this temperature. After all, instability decreases the amount of functional enzyme. However, reduction in enzymatic activity at 55&#x000b0;C (incubation for 30 minutes, reduction of 74%) is only partially explained by the thermal instability at 55&#x000b0;C (incubation for one hour, reduction of 53%). This suggests that a fraction of the protein is unfolded reversibly &#x02013; and therefore temporarily inactive &#x02013; before either denaturing irreversibly at this temperature or returning to its active state after cooling. The temperature optimum (37.5&#x000b0;C) and the considerable activity at lower temperatures (at 15&#x000b0;C nearly half of the activity remains) are in agreement with the microbial characteristics of <italic>P. aeruginosa </italic>as an opportunistic (human) pathogen and a common water and soil organism, respectively. With only 90% of the activity realized at the cytoplasmic pH, the pH optimum and stability of MSG seem somewhat shifted to a more basic pH range. The stability analysis suggests fast and irreversible denaturation of MSG outside the pH range from 6 to 11. The optimal pH for enzymatic activity (above 85%) was limited to a more narrow pH range (pH 7 to 11). In combination with the slightly reduced stability at pH 9 to 11, these data suggest that the actual pH optimum for the enzymatic activity is shifted somewhat further to a more basic pH compared to the apparent pH optimum (between 8 and 9). Since the enzyme functions intracellularly (at a periplasmic pH between 7.2 and 7.4) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>], the high activity at elevated pH is quite surprising. The reason for this remains to be elucidated, as data from other malate synthases is lacking. Possibly, this pattern can be explained by the catalytic mechanism of MSG and the residues involved. Based on sequence similarity with MSG of <italic>E. coli </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>] and <italic>M. tuberculosis </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>], Asp<sup>631 </sup>functions as a catalytic base, abstracting a proton from the terminal methyl group of acetyl CoA. The resulting negative enolate is stabilized by the positive charge of conserved Arg<sup>340</sup>. Glyoxylate is polarized for nucleophilic attack by the magnesium ion, which is essential for enzymatic activity. After nucleophilic attack of the enolate anion on glyoxylate, the resulting malyl-CoA intermediate is stabilized by Mg<sup>2+ </sup>and Arg<sup>340</sup>. Subsequently, this intermediate is hydrolyzed by a water molecule activated by Glu<sup>274 </sup>and/or Asp<sup>275</sup>. As a result, the products, malate and CoA, are released [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. The theoretical pK<sub>a</sub>'s of the side chains of the catalytic residues (4.1 (Asp), 4.5 (Glu), 12.0 (Arg) in solution at 25&#x000b0;C) suggest that their charge probably remains unaltered over this pH range. However, the pK<sub>a </sub>can vary considerably (more than one pH unit) depending on the local environment of the amino acid side chain in the protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. Alternatively, the charge of residues involved in substrate binding might change over this pH range. Likewise, charge changes of residues crucial to the structural stability of MSG could gravely affect the enzyme's structural stability at a pH outside the range between 6 and 11 and lead to (irreversible) denaturation. Future structural analysis of this MSG might provide more insight in the exact mechanisms involved. The inhibition of malate synthase G by pyruvate is probably competitive in nature, presumably by competition with glyoxylate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>].</p><p>The kinetic parameters of MSG of <italic>P. aeruginosa </italic>are comparable to those of the enzymes of other organisms (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>). Since the extended straight lines in the primary Lineweaver-Burk plot intersect approximately in one unique point, MSG proceeds through a ternary complex, which contains the enzyme in complex with both substrates, as opposed to a substituted enzyme mechanism, in which a group is transferred from the first substrate that leaves the complex before the second substrate binds. This is in agreement with the catalytic mechanism proposed for the <italic>E. coli </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>] and the <italic>M. tuberculosis </italic>MSG [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>] as is the case for most enzymes with two substrates catalyzing a group transfer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>The implication of the glyoxylate bypass in the pathology of various microorganisms makes MSG an attractive new target for antibacterial therapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. What makes them especially appealing is that no genes encoding the enzymes of the glyoxylate bypass have been identified in mammals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. In addition, <italic>P. aeruginosa </italic>was shown to encode only a single malate synthase. The microbial and biochemical characterization of MSG of <italic>P. aeruginosa </italic>are an important step towards the development of antibacterials targeting this enzyme to combat antibiotic resistant <italic>P. aeruginosa </italic>infections. Future studies of the inhibition kinetics of pyruvate in combination with the elucidation of the crystal structure of MSG in complex with substrates, products and natural inhibitors will be instrumental to develop novel inhibition strategies.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Construction of the <italic>glcB </italic>deletion mutant</title><p>The construction of the deletion mutant was described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. Drops (2 &#x003bc;l) of a tenfold dilution series of an overnight culture of wildtype <italic>P. aeruginosa </italic>or the <italic>glcB </italic>deletion mutant were spotted on LB medium and M9 minimal medium. M9 minimal medium was composed of 11.28 g/l M9 salts (Difco Laboratories, Detroit, MI, USA), 2 mM MgSO<sub>4 </sub>(Acros Organics, Geel, Belgium), 0.1 mM CaCl<sub>2 </sub>(Sigma-Aldrich), 0.5% w/v of acetate (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany) as the sole carbon source, and 1.5% w/v of agar (Lab<sup>M</sup>).</p></sec><sec><title>Recombinant production of MSG in <italic>E. coli</italic></title><p>The 2,175 bp open reading frame (ORF) encoding malate synthase G was PCR amplified (GoTaq DNA polymerase, 2.5 units, Promega, Madison, WI, USA) using the <italic>P. aeruginosa </italic>PAO1 genome as template and inserted in the multiple cloning site of pGEX-6P-1 (GE Healthcare, Little Chalfont, UK). DNA sequence analysis confirmed the sequence of the inserted ORF and the reading-frame fusion with the coding sequence of N-terminal GST tag. The MSG and the GST tag are separated by the recognition sequence (LEVLFQGP) of the Prescission&#x02122; protease (GE Healthcare). <italic>E. coli </italic>BL21 cells containing the pGEX-6P-1-<italic>glcB </italic>construct were grown in 2xTY to an optical density (at 600 nm) of 0.6 and induced overnight at 16&#x000b0;C using 0.1 mM Isopropyl &#x003b2;-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG).</p><p>In a first step, the recombinant protein was purified from cleared lysates on an &#x00394;kta FPLC (GE Healthcare) using a 5 ml GSTrap HP column (GE Healthcare) as described by the manufacturer. For proteolytic removal of the GST tag, elution was performed with 50 units of Prescission&#x02122; protease (GE Healthcare) after overnight on column incubation with the protease at 4&#x000b0;C. The next day, the released MSG was eluted (50 mM Tris.HCl, pH 7.5). Prior to the second purification step using anion exchange chromatography (AEC), the eluate resulting from the Prescission&#x02122; protease-based release from the GSTrap HP column was dialyzed against a triethanolamine buffer (20 mM pH 7.5). The sample was loaded on Q sepharose Fast Flow column (15 &#x000d7; 160 mm, GE Healthcare). After washing the column (200 ml at 2 ml/min), the proteins were eluted using a linear gradient of 0 to 0.5 M NaCl in 150 minutes (1 ml/min) and collected in 2 ml fractions. The purified fractions were pooled and dialyzed against a buffer compatible with the malate synthase activity assays (100 mM Tris.HCl, 5 mM MgCl<sub>2 </sub>at a pH of 7.5).</p></sec><sec><title>MSG activity assays</title><p>The temperature and pH optimum and stability, as well as the inhibition by pyruvate, were performed with an endpoint assay which measures the amount of CoA. The amount of free thiol groups of CoA was determined using 5, 5'-dithiobis-(2-nitrobenzoic acid) or DTNB (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA)[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. The absorption at 415 nm was measured in a microplate reader (Microplate reader model 680, Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA, USA). DTNB was added to a final concentration of 2 mM. Addition of DTNB to the mixture arrests the reaction, probably due to reaction of the DTNB with the free thiol groups of cysteine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. The standard reaction mixture contains 280 ng MSG, 100 mM Tris.HCl, 5 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 2 mM glyoxylate (Sigma-Aldrich), 1 mM acetyl CoA (AppliChem GmbH, Darmstadt, Germany). Unless stated otherwise, the reactions were incubated for 30 min at pH 7.5. To identify the pH optimum, reactions were buffered using a universal buffer spanning a pH range from 2 to 12 (30 mM citrate, 30 mM Tris, 30 mM borate). All experiments were conducted in triplicate. The error bars correspond to one standard deviation.</p><p>To determine the kinetic parameters of MSG, the reaction was followed over time by measuring the absorption of the acetyl thioester bond at 232 nm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. The assays were performed in transparent microplates (Greiner, Frickenhausen, Germany), incubated at 25&#x000b0;C and measured with a TECAN Infinite<sup>&#x000ae; </sup>M200 (TECAN, Zurich, Switzerland). Each reaction contained 10 &#x003bc;g of enzyme.
