Nearly all studied WRKY factors appear to have a stereotypic binding preference to one DNA element termed the W-box. How specificity for certain promoters is accomplished therefore remains completely unknown. In this study, we tested five distinct Arabidopsis WRKY transcription factor subfamily members for their DNA binding selectivity towards variants of the W-box embedded in neighboring DNA sequences. These studies revealed for the first time differences in their binding site preferences, which are partly dependent on additional adjacent DNA sequences outside of the TTGACY-core motif. A consensus WRKY binding site derived from these studies was used for in&#x000a0;silico analysis to identify potential target genes within the Arabidopsis genome. Furthermore, we show that even subtle amino acid substitutions within the DNA binding region of <italic>At</italic>WRKY11 strongly impinge on its binding activity. Additionally, all five factors were found localized exclusively to the plant cell nucleus and to be capable of trans-activating expression of a reporter gene construct in&#x000a0;vivo.</p><sec><title>Electronic supplementary material</title><p>The online version of this article (doi:10.1007/s11103-008-9353-1) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Arabidopsis promoters</kwd><kwd>Nuclear localization</kwd><kwd>Transactivation</kwd><kwd>W-box element</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-wrap><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2008</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-wrap></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p>Transcription factors act in concert with other components of the transcriptional machinery to modulate the expression of target genes in a temporal and spatial manner. In general, they do so by binding to short defined nucleotide motifs (<italic>cis</italic>-elements) within the regulatory regions of genes that are under their control. Different classes of transcription factors have characteristic DNA-binding domains that discriminate between distinct <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory elements at target sites within the genome. Our studies have been focused on a family of zinc-finger type transcription factors, designated WRKY. WRKY factors comprise a large family of DNA-binding proteins found in all plants (Eulgem and Somssich <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">2007</xref>). Although not completely restricted to the plant kingdom, this family has expanded enormously in higher plants whereas they appear to have been lost in yeast and animal lineages (&#x000dc;lker and Somssich <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">2004</xref>). WRKY proteins have been implicated in the regulation of developmental processes such as trichome and seed development and leaf senescence (Hinderhofer and Zentgraf <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">2001</xref>; Johnson et&#x000a0;al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">2002</xref>; Luo et&#x000a0;al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">2005</xref>), but their major functions appear to be in helping the plant to cope with various abiotic and biotic stresses (&#x000dc;lker and Somssich <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">2004</xref>; Journot-Catalino et&#x000a0;al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">2006</xref>; Li et&#x000a0;al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">2006</xref>; Wang et&#x000a0;al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">2006</xref>; Xu et&#x000a0;al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">2006</xref>; Zheng et&#x000a0;al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">2006</xref>; Shen et&#x000a0;al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">2007</xref>).</p><p>All WRKY proteins contain a 60 amino acid long peptide region, termed the WRKY domain, which constitutes their DNA binding regions. Apart from the invariant name-giving amino acid residues W R K and Y, this domain also contains conserved cysteine and histidine residues that bind one zinc atom and form a finger-like structure. Both the WRKY residues as well as the zinc finger motif are required for proper DNA binding of the protein (Maeo et&#x000a0;al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">2001</xref>). Based on the number of WRKY domains and the pattern of the zinc-finger motif, WRKY factors have been classified into three major groups (Eulgem et&#x000a0;al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">2000</xref>). The number of family members in higher plants can range from 74 in Arabidopsis, 98 to 102 in rice or even more in other species such as tobacco (&#x000dc;lker and Somssich <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">2004</xref>; Ross et&#x000a0;al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">2007</xref>).</p><p>Gel-shift experiments, random binding site selection, DNA-ligand binding screens, yeast one-hybrid studies and cotransfection assays performed with different plant WRKY proteins have illustrated that the <italic>cis</italic>-element 5&#x02032;-TTGAC-C/T-3&#x02032;, termed the W-box, represents the minimal consensus required for specific DNA binding (de Pater et&#x000a0;al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">1996</xref>; Rushton et&#x000a0;al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">1996</xref>; Wang et&#x000a0;al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">1998</xref>; Chen and Chen <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">2000</xref>; Cormack et&#x000a0;al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">2002</xref>). Only in the case of the barley WRKY factor SUSIBA2 and the tobacco NtWRKY12 have additional DNA binding sites been identified, although SUSIBA2 also shows strong in&#x000a0;vitro binding to the W-box motif (Sun et&#x000a0;al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">2003</xref>; van Verk et&#x000a0;al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">2008</xref>). Considering the size of the WRKY family within a given species and the apparent stereotypic binding preference of these proteins to the W-box, it is difficult to foresee how specificity for certain promoters is accomplished. A certain level of specificity may be conferred by additional nucleotide sequences flanking W-box elements with respective gene promoters. Furthermore, various WRKY subgroup family members within a single plant species may also differ somewhat in their DNA binding requirements. Both of these aspects have not yet been directly addressed for WRKY transcription factors. Finally, the involvement of WRKY factors in diverse higher-order nucleoprotein complexes can also be assumed and may in fact be the major criteria in determining promoter selectivity and transcriptional output.</p><p>In this study, we selected five Arabidopsis WRKY transcription factors representing the three major groups of WRKY proteins including three from the largest, namely group II. These factors were analyzed with respect to their in&#x000a0;vitro binding capabilities to various W-box variants and promoter sequences containing W-box motifs. This analysis already revealed clear as yet not observed binding site preferences between certain representatives. Furthermore, we show that all studied WRKY factors are localized exclusively to the nucleus and that all have in&#x000a0;vivo transactivation capabilities.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Recombinant fusion proteins</title><p>The <italic>At</italic>WRKY cDNA fragments were obtained with specific Gateway-primers in RT-PCR reactions and cloned in-frame into the modified bacterial expression vector pGEX2T (Pharmacia) or into the vector pQE30a (Qiagen) and verified by sequencing.

However, no systematic study has been reported testing whether members of the different WRKY subgroups within a single plant species all show similar DNA binding requirements. Thus, we choose five selected subgroup representatives of the <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic><italic>WRKY</italic> gene family for qualitative DNA binding studies. These members represent the WRKY groups I (WRKY26; At5g07100), IIb (WRKY6; At1g62300), IIc (WRKY43; At2g46130), IId (WRKY11; At4g31550) and III (WRKY38; At5g22570) (Eulgem et&#x000a0;al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">2000</xref>). Full-length cDNAs for all representatives served as templates for expression in <italic>E.&#x000a0;coli</italic> and total soluble protein extracts derived from these bacteria were directly used for further analysis. Initially, we encountered several problems attempting to express a large set of WRKY proteins (both as GST fusions or epitope tagged variants) in <italic>E.&#x000a0;coli</italic>. Often, their expression proved detrimental for bacterial growth. Since WRKY factors are zinc-finger proteins, their expression may in some way negatively influence zinc homeostasis. Exogenous addition of zinc however did not relieve this problem. In several instances bacterial growth was not significantly influenced but the specific WRKY proteins were found exclusively in inclusion bodies. No attempts were made to purify the proteins from this source since previous work in our laboratory has shown that during the denaturation and subsequent renaturation steps misfolding of these proteins often occurs resulting on loss of W-box binding ability. Affinity purification of epitope-tagged WRKY proteins under mild condition also proved problematic. Thus, only those five WRKY members were taken into consideration for further analyses for which sufficient protein was present in the total soluble bacterial protein extracts. As controls for all experiments, protein extracts derived from identically treated bacteria harboring only the appropriate empty expression vector cassette were always included. In no case did these control extracts result in detectable sequence-specific binding to the tested DNA sequences (data not shown).</p><p>In the first set of experiments, we synthesized an oligonucleotide (1&#x000d7;W2; 5&#x02032;-TTATTCAGCCATCAAAAG<underline>TTGACC</underline>AATAAT-3&#x02032;) identical in sequence to the region of the parsley <italic>PR1-1</italic> promoter containing one W-box (W2; Rushton et&#x000a0;al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">1996</xref>). The W2 element was previously shown to mediate strong elicitor-dependent gene activation and to be bound specifically by WRKY factors (Rushton et&#x000a0;al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">1996</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">2002)</xref>. In addition, several variants of this oligonucleotide were synthesized containing single or double nucleotide base exchanges within or directly adjacent to the W2 box (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>a). The various double stranded oligomers were radioactively labeled, incubated with the different bacterial protein extracts, and specific DNA binding by the respective WRKY factors detected by electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSA; Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>b). Surprisingly, two discrete binding site preferences could be observed with the five WRKY representatives used (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>b). In the case of WRKY6 and WRKY11, clear binding was detected with the two known functional W-box variants TTGACC (1&#x000d7;W2) and TTGACT (m2), whereas no specific binding was seen with oligomers containing mutations within this W-box consensus (m1, m18, m19, m3 to m7). The binding of these two factors was similarly influenced negatively by mutations of the guanosine residue directly 5&#x02032; adjacent of the W-box motif (m8, m9, m14 and m15). For both factors, base exchanges 3&#x02032; of the element did not seem to affect binding of both factors (m10 to m12, m16, m17). However, in the case of m16 and m17 we cannot completely rule out that simultaneous exchanges at the 5&#x02032; ends may have compensated for the base exchanges at the 3&#x02032; ends of these elements. Identical binding properties were observed using the entire WRKY11 protein or only the 98 amino acid long region harboring the WRKY domain that mediates DNA binding (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>b, WRKY11-CTD). In contrast, WRKY26, WRKY38 and WRKY43 showed common binding characteristics that clearly differed from those observed for WRKY6 and WRKY11. All three proteins bound the TTGACC element (1&#x000d7;W2) but showed no binding to the other functional W-box variant TTGACT (m2). Exchange of the first 5&#x02032; base within the element from T to G or A actually enhanced binding (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>b; m6, m7). Lower but clearly detectable binding was still observed with other single base substitutions (m1, m18 and m5). Importantly, mutations of the G residue directly 5&#x02032; adjacent of the W-box element had a clear positive effect on binding (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>b; m13 to m15). Since the levels of bacterially expressed individual WRKY factors varied significantly as determined by western blots (data not shown), binding strength comparisons between the factors were not made. Rather, only qualitative differences were scored. Still, we can conclude that the five tested WRKY proteins fall into two distinct groups (WRKY6 and 11 on the one hand, and WRKY26, 38 and 43 on the other) showing different DNA sequence requirements for binding. Furthermore, the presence of a W-box element in a DNA region alone is not sufficient for WRKY factor binding, but can be influenced by additional sequences in its neighborhood. By 5&#x02032; and 3&#x02032; deletions of the original 1&#x000d7;W2 oligomer we determined that 4&#x000a0;bp proximal to and 3&#x000a0;bp distal of the W-box motif are required for efficient WRKY factor binding, but that the orientation of the element within the sequence does not influence binding (data not shown). <fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig.&#x000a0;1</label><caption><p>Binding site preferences of different Arabidopsis WRKY subgroup representatives to W-box variants.

For this, four promoters were selected derived from the <italic>SIRK/FRK1</italic> (At2g19190), <italic>CMPG1</italic> (At3g02840), <italic>4CL4</italic> (At3g21230) and <italic>WRKY11</italic> loci. The <italic>SIRK/FRK1</italic>gene encodes a receptor kinase whose expression is up-regulated during leaf senescence and upon pathogen challenge (Asai et&#x000a0;al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">2002</xref>; Robatzek and Somssich <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">2002</xref>). Its promoter contains numerous W-box motifs and several WRKY factors have been implicated in its regulation. <italic>CMPG1</italic> represents an immediate-early pathogen-responsive gene coding for a U-box protein that is required for efficient activation of defense mechanisms in tobacco and tomato (Gonzalez-Lamothe et&#x000a0;al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">2006</xref>). The W-box-containing region was shown to mediate this response (Heise et&#x000a0;al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">2002</xref>). <italic>4CL4</italic> codes for a 4-coumarate:CoA ligase, a key enzyme in general phenylpropanoid metabolism with unusual catalytic properties (Hamberger and Hahlbrock <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">2004</xref>). The occurrence of three TATA-proximal W-box elements is an absolute singularity among all known <italic>4CL</italic> gene promoters.</p><p>WRKY11 and WRKY26 were chosen as representatives of the two distinct binding type factors for further gel shift studies. Oligomers spanning defined W-box containing regions of the selected promoters were synthesized (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>a) and used as probes. Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>b shows the results of these experiments. For the majority of cases, the outcome of the interaction was predictable based on the information gained from Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>b. For example the two W-box elements present in the &#x02212;731 to &#x02212;705 region of <italic>AtSIRK</italic> promoter (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>a, 1) were expected to both be bound by WRKY11 and thus yield two retarded complexes (one site occupied or both sites) in EMSA (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>b, lane 1). Similar results are observed for the &#x02212;47 to &#x02212;31 <italic>AtSIRK</italic> promoter region probe (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>, lane 4). In contrast, little binding is seen with the two other analyzed regions (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>, lanes 2 and 3). Both of these regions contain one inverted W-box core and one W-box motif in a sequence environment detrimental for WRKY11 binding (compare to Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>, m4, m13 and m15). WRKY11 binds to all other promoter regions analyzed with the exception of the <italic>At4CL</italic>-W2 (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>, lane 10). In <italic>At4CL</italic>-W2, the TTGACC sequence is directly preceded by an A residue shown to have a negative effect on binding (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>, m14). In the case of WRKY26, clear binding was only observed with the <italic>AtSIRK</italic> promoter probe 3. This was anticipated (see Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>, m15). Formation of the retarded complexes depicted in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref> could be competed away by an excess of the corresponding non-labeled probes (data not shown). One must note however, that not all observed interactions could be predicted based on our limited studies, indicating that additional neighboring nucleotide requirements are needed for proper WRKY factor binding. Nevertheless, these data again illustrate that WRKY proteins do have selective binding preferences to certain W-box motifs embedded within different promoter sequences. <fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig.&#x000a0;2</label><caption><p>Binding of WRKY factors to W-box containing promoter sequences.

As a starting point we generated a dimer (2&#x000d7;W2s24) of the 1&#x000d7;W2 oligomer, which was bound by all five WRKY factors (Figs.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>b and <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>a). 2&#x000d7;W2s24 contains two W-box motifs separated by 24&#x000a0;bp. Four additional derivatives of the dimer were synthesized differing in the number of base pairs between the two W-box elements (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>a). Gel shift assays revealed that all double-stranded 2&#x000d7;W2s24 derivatives were bound by the WRKY proteins (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>b). Interestingly however, with the exception of WRKY26, all WRKY factors mainly bind to only one of the two potential W-box sites within the DNA oligomer. Simultaneous binding to both sites, yielding an additional more slower migrating shifted protein-DNA complex in the gel, occurs to only a limited extent except for WRKY26. Using only the WRKY11 DNA binding domain (WRKY11 CTD; Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>b) in such experiments yields stronger signals for the higher molecular weight complex indicating the size restrictions may partly limit simultaneous binding to both sites. This is further supported by the fact that this larger retarded complex is no longer observed when the W-box motifs are separated by only a single base pair (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>b, 2&#x000d7;W2s1). That the formation of both retarded complexes is dependent on W-box specific binding was demonstrated by competition experiments using either an excess of non-labeled 2&#x000d7;W2s24 or a variant (2&#x000d7;W2m, Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>a) in which both W-box motifs were altered from TTGACC to TacACC. As illustrated for WRKY11-CTD, both complexes are competed away by an excess of the wildtype sequence, whereas this is not the case using 2&#x000d7;W2m (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>c).

Furthermore, they and others have shown that despite high sequence identity between the two WRKY domains of group I WRKY factors, only the C-terminal WRKY domain (CTD) actually contributes significantly to DNA binding (de Pater et&#x000a0;al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">1996</xref>; Eulgem et&#x000a0;al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">1999</xref>; Maeo et&#x000a0;al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">2001</xref>).</p><p>We expressed variants of the CTD domain of Arabidopsis WRKY11 in <italic>E.&#x000a0;coli</italic> and used these bacterial extracts for EMSA to define additional amino acid residues within the WRKY domain important for DNA binding. <italic>At</italic>WRKY11-CTD showed identical binding characteristics towards W-box containing sequences as the full-length WRKY11 protein (compare Figs.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>b) but yielded higher and consistent amounts of recombinant protein. Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>a shows the peptide sequence of the <italic>At</italic>WRKY11 WRKY domain (<italic>At</italic>WRKY11-CTD) and the various, mostly single amino acid substitutions that were generated within this domain. Exchange of selective amino acid positions was based on a pile up comparison between all Arabidopsis WRKY domains and in particular, considering differences observed between the N-terminal and C-terminal domains of group I members. The bacterially expressed recombinant proteins all carried a 6&#x000d7;His- or Strep-tag for detection and quantification on western blots, which verified that all proteins were produced (data not shown). As expected, amino acid exchanges within the WRKY motif itself dramatically affected binding to all W-box containing DNA sequences (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>, m1, m3, m4 and m5) consistent with previous reports (Maeo et&#x000a0;al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">2001</xref>; Duan et&#x000a0;al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">2007</xref>). Similarly, a C to G substitution, potentially disrupting the zinc-finger motif (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>a, m2), also strongly affected DNA binding, but did not completely abolish it (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>b, m2). Using the <italic>AtSIRKp</italic>W11/12 promoter region containing two W-boxes as labeled probe, all additional WRKY11-CTD substitution variants were tested via EMSA (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>c). In most cases, single amino acid alterations negatively affected DNA binding. Only in three instances was binding capability unaffected (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>c, m7, m16 and m17). For the variants m8 and m17, in which the same glycine residue was substituted by either a serine or a histidine, only the G to H exchange, resulting in a substitution of an uncharged polar amino acid to a basic charged one, had an effect. It is important to note however, that for the majority of variants, we choose to exchange amino acids sharing similar properties. For example, in the variants m7, m10, m12, and m18, arginine was substituted by lysine or vice versa (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>a). Still, such substitutions often profoundly affected DNA binding ability, suggesting that many amino acid residues within the WRKY domain are critical for proper binding function. Interestingly, one substitution (D to E; Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>c, m6) outside of the WRKY domain also strongly influenced W-box binding. This is in accordance with results from tobacco demonstrating that deletion of 4 residues just N-terminal to the WRKY domain of <italic>Nt</italic>WRKY9 completely abolished DNA binding (Maeo et&#x000a0;al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">2001</xref>) and with data from Babu et&#x000a0;al.

Since individual WRKY factors have been shown to function as activators or repressors of transcription (Robatzek and Somssich <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">2002</xref>; Zhang et&#x000a0;al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">2004</xref>) but also to lack such activity (Hara et&#x000a0;al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">2000</xref>), we tested the ability of the Arabidopsis WRKY subgroup members to activate W-box-dependent transcription of a reporter gene <italic>in vivo</italic>. We first fused the <italic>gfp</italic> reporter gene in frame C-terminal to the respective full-length WRKY cDNAs. Expression of these constructs was driven by the strong constitutive 35S CaMV promoter. In transient transfections using epidermal onion cells, detection of GFP fluorescence confirmed that the WRKY-GFP fusion proteins were synthesized and demonstrated nuclear localization of the respective products (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>a). The same constructs were then used as effectors together with a GUS reporter construct driven by the &#x02212;928&#x000a0;bp <italic>AtSIRK</italic> promoter (Robatzek and Somssich <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">2002</xref>) for co-bombardment assays using green 4-week-old Arabidopsis leaves. As shown in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>b, all WRKY fusion proteins, with the exception of WRKY11, were able to activate the reporter gene, demonstrating transactivation capabilities of these transcription factors. WRKY6 (positive control) was previously shown to activate the <italic>AtSIRK</italic> promoter (Robatzek and Somssich <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">2002</xref>). The fact that WRKY11 does not activate the reporter gene despite its ability to bind to the <italic>AtSIRK</italic> promoter in&#x000a0;vitro (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>) suggested a possible lack of transactivation capabilities. However, in similar experiments in which the GUS reporter gene was driven by the 4&#x000d7;W2 box synthetic promoter (Rushton et&#x000a0;al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">2002</xref>), the same WRKY11 construct clearly activated the reporter (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>b, <italic>4xW2</italic>::GUS) as did all other tested WRKY constructs (data not shown). Activation by WRKY11 was also observed using the 1&#x000d7;W2m11 sequence (see Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>a) to drive reporter gene expression, but not when the 1&#x000d7;W2m13 sequence or a mutated version of the W2 sequence (<italic>4xW2mut</italic>::GUS) were used (data not shown).

Moreover, these nucleotides partly determine the type of WRKY factor that will be recruited. <italic>At</italic>WRKY6 and <italic>At</italic>WRKY11 bind well to W-boxes that have a G residue directly 5&#x02032; adjacent to the element, whereas <italic>At</italic>WRKY 26, 38 and 43 bind to the same motif if this residue is a T, C or A. This is the first time that such discriminatory WRKY factor binding to W-boxes has been observed. Sequences carrying the hexamer, C<italic>TGAC</italic>C, were not bound by any of the five WRKY representatives tested, indicating that a minimal W-box element should rather be defined as, 5&#x02032;-T<underline>TGAC</underline>C/T-3&#x02032;. The sequence motif T<italic>TGAC</italic>A has previously been referred to as a W-box-like motif (Maleck et&#x000a0;al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">2000</xref>; Kankainen and Holm <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">2004</xref>; Navarro et&#x000a0;al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">2004</xref>). However, neither our data nor earlier work (de Pater et&#x000a0;al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">1996</xref> #3286) lends support to this assumption. In addition, our findings imply that the hexamers T<underline>TGAC</underline>C and T<underline>TGAC</underline>T are not functionally identical with respect to WRKY factor binding. This observation is supported by previous studies demonstrating that the affinity of Arabidopsis ZAP1 (=<italic>At</italic>WRKY1) to the TTGACC motif is four-fold higher than to TTGACT (de Pater et&#x000a0;al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">1996</xref>). By using DNA regions derived from different gene promoters we were able to show that the sequence environment into which W-box elements are embedded can significantly influence protein binding. This influence cannot always be explained merely by differences in the immediately adjacent neighboring bases, indicating that additional, as of yet ill-defined parameters, also play a role. Nevertheless, based on our results, we derived at two consensus sequences that currently best define good WRKY factor binding sites (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>).</p><p>In several cases closely adjacent W-box elements have been observed in various gene promoters (Eulgem et&#x000a0;al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">1999</xref>; Yang et&#x000a0;al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">1999</xref>; Yu et&#x000a0;al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">2001</xref>; Chen and Chen <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">2002</xref>; Mar&#x000e8; et&#x000a0;al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">2004</xref>; Zhang et&#x000a0;al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">2004</xref>). In case of <italic>PcWRKY1</italic>, the presence of these multiple sites appears to have a synergistic effect on transcription (Eulgem et&#x000a0;al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">1999</xref>). On the other hand, the barley <italic>Hv</italic>-WRKY38 factor actually requires two closely adjacent W-boxes for efficient DNA binding (Mar&#x000e8; et&#x000a0;al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">2004</xref>). Scanning the entire Arabidopsis genome for two W-box elements from 0 to 30 nucleotides apart revealed that there is a statistically significant enrichment of such dimers within promoter regions. However, although certain distances appear to be favored, the biological importance of this observation remains to be tested. Some WRKY family members do contain leucine zippers capable of forming homo- and hetero-dimers (Cormack et&#x000a0;al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">2002</xref>; Robatzek and Somssich <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">2002</xref>; Xu et&#x000a0;al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">2006</xref>; Shen et&#x000a0;al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">2007</xref>) but the majority do not and very likely bind as monomers to W-box elements. Our data are in agreement with this and indicate that no synergistic binding effects are observed for the tested WRKY factors in the presence of two closely adjacent W-box elements (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). These results are further substantiated by recent surface plasmon resonance and NMR studies demonstrating that <italic>At</italic>WRKY4-CTD binds to the W-box element with a stoichiometry of 1:1 (Yamasaki et&#x000a0;al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">2005</xref>) and by high-resolution crystal structure of <italic>At</italic>WRKY1-CTD (Duan et&#x000a0;al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">2007</xref>). One should note however, that some WRKY factors can influence expression of specific genes without directly contacting DNA. Recently, the rice WRKY factor <italic>Os</italic>WRKY51, although failing to bind itself, was shown to enhance specific binding of <italic>Os</italic>WRKY71 to the <italic>Amy32b</italic> gene promoter thereby synergistically suppressing gibberellic acid-inducibility of a tested reporter gene (Xie et&#x000a0;al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">2006</xref>).</p><p>Another important finding is that Arabidopsis members of all three major WRKY groups show W-box specific binding both in&#x000a0;vitro and in&#x000a0;vivo. No subgroup specific differences were observed although this may have been expected based on the fact that group III WRKY proteins very likely utilize different basic amino acid residues within their DNA binding domains for contacting DNA phosphate groups compared to the other two groups (Yamasaki et&#x000a0;al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">2005</xref>). These results are in accord with in&#x000a0;silico data implying that the lineage-specific expansion of the WRKY domains in Arabidopsis has diversified primarily in terms of their expression patterns rather than in their target DNA-binding sites (Babu et&#x000a0;al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2006</xref>). All tested Arabidopsis WRKY factors localized to the nucleus, which is fully consistent with previous studies on different plant WRKY factors with the exception of <italic>At</italic>WRKY46 whose localization appears to be restricted to the nucleolus (Koroleva et&#x000a0;al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">2005</xref>).</p><p>Using an alanine scanning approach to analyze the C-terminal domain of tobacco <italic>Nt</italic>WRKY-9, Maeo et&#x000a0;al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">2001</xref>) and a site directed mutagenesis approach for the <italic>At</italic>WRKY1-CTD (Duan et&#x000a0;al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">2007</xref>) revealed that not all amino acid residues within the highly conserved WRKYGQK peptide stretch of the DNA binding domain are absolutely essential for W-box binding. The substitutions R&#x02192;A and R&#x02192;E, Y&#x02192;F, G&#x02192;A, Q&#x02192;A and Q&#x02192;K still enabled binding to the DNA element in EMSA, albeit at lower efficiencies. One apparent discrepancy between our results and those from Maeo et&#x000a0;al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">2001</xref>) relate to the substitution of a critical cysteine involved in forming the zinc finger. Whereas this substitution completely abolished W-box binding of <italic>Nt</italic>WRKY-9 (Maeo et&#x000a0;al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">2001</xref>), this was not completely the case for <italic>At</italic>WRKY11-CTD (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>). One plausible explanation for this difference is that no additional neighboring cysteine or histidine residues are present in the <italic>Nt</italic>WRKY-9 protein, while two additional histidine residues are present in <italic>At</italic>WRKY11-CTD, which may partly allow such a finger to form.</p><p>Our analysis, that included substitutions at other conserved amino acid positions within the WRKY domain of <italic>At</italic>WRKY11, suggest that in most cases even significantly conservative exchanges perturbed efficient binding to the W-box (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>). This hints towards a need for a rather stringent conformational structure for high affinity binding that is also supported by the studies of Duan et&#x000a0;al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">2007</xref>). Consistent with this assumption is the fact that an Arabidopsis mutant encoding an <italic>At</italic>WRKY52 protein having a single amino acid insertion within the WRKY domain could no longer bind a W-box element (Noutoshi et&#x000a0;al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">2005</xref>). It is also partly substantiated by protein structure prediction programs and by the NMR solution structure of the C-terminal <italic>At</italic>WRKY4 DNA demonstrating that this region consists of four &#x003b2;-strands forming a compact antiparallel &#x003b2;-sheet (Yamasaki et&#x000a0;al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">2005</xref>) with many of the introduced substitutions that negatively affect binding located within the &#x003b2;-sheet strands in WRKY11 CTD (for example m10&#x02013;m15 and m18 in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>a). Two of the three substitutions that did not affect WRKY11 CTD binding are outside of the predicted &#x003b2;-strand structural elements (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>b, m7 and m16). A structural model predicts that the &#x003b2;-strand containing the WRKYGQK motif makes contact with a 6&#x000a0;bp DNA region, consistent with the length of the W-box, in the major DNA groove (Yamasaki et&#x000a0;al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">2005</xref>; Duan et&#x000a0;al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">2007</xref>). Verification of this model however, awaits a structural determination of the WRKY protein complexed with its DNA binding site.</p><p>The high-resolution crystal structure of <italic>At</italic>WRKY1-C revealed an additional &#x003b2;-strand N-terminal to the WRKY domain that was missing in the NMR <italic>At</italic>WRKY4-C model (Yamasaki et&#x000a0;al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">2005</xref>; Duan et&#x000a0;al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">2007</xref>). Within the loop between this and the adjacent &#x003b2;-strand containing the WRKYGQK motif, a pivotal residue, D308, was identified that forms a well-defined salt bridge with a lysine residue and extensive H-bonds with two additional amino acids. All these residues are conserved among the WRKY proteins and may be important in stabilizing this domain structure (Duan et&#x000a0;al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">2007</xref>). These stabilizing requirement may explain why the D to E substitution in <italic>At</italic>WRKY11 significantly affected binding of the protein to DNA (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>c, m6).</p><p>The co-bombardment assays indicate that all tested WRKY factors has intrinsic transactivation capabilities in&#x000a0;vivo (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>). However, as illustrated by <italic>At</italic>WRKY11, W-box binding alone is not sufficient for this function. Very likely promoter architecture as well as additional associated factors will in part determine distinct transcriptional outputs. <italic>At</italic>WRKY11 along with its closely related family members <italic>At</italic>WRKY7 and <italic>At</italic>WRKY17, have been demonstrated to act as negative regulators of defense gene expression in&#x000a0;vivo (Journot-Catalino et&#x000a0;al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">2006</xref>; Kim et&#x000a0;al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">2006</xref>). Thus, similar to what has been observed for <italic>At</italic>WRKY6 (Robatzek and Somssich <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">2002</xref>), these factors may possess dual functionalities dependent on promoter context. No role has as yet been identified for the other here studied factors, <italic>At</italic>WRKY26, 38 and 43.</p><p>It is evident that our studies cannot fully explain the discrete binding site selectivity of the large set of WRKY factors to their in&#x000a0;vivo target sites. Still, as a starting point, our analysis provides important information on what actually constitutes a W-box-like element within regulatory sequences that can be predicted to be bound by certain WRKY family members. These studies therefore should help to improve whole genome in&#x000a0;silico analyses regarding WRKY protein-DNA interactions.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Electronic supplementary material</title><supplementary-material id="N0x1d02c70N0x2cb86b8" content-type="local-data"><p>Below is the link to the electronic supplementary material. </p><media xlink:href="11103_2008_9353_MOESM1_ESM.doc" id="MO7" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="msword"><caption><p>(DOC 66 kb)</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="N0x1d02c70N0x2cb8790" content-type="local-data"><media xlink:href="11103_2008_9353_MOESM2_ESM.doc" id="MO8" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="msword"><caption><p>(DOC 42 kb)</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank Dr. Aifen Zhou for providing the WRKY6-GFP and WRKY11-GFP expression constructs, and Dr. Janna Br&#x000fc;mmer for providing the WRKY26-GFP construct.
