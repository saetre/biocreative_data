Here, we report histone H3-tail lysine methylation profiles of several <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> genes in correlation with their transcriptional activity and the input of the epigenetic factor ARABIDOPSIS HOMOLOG OF TRITHORAX (ATX1) at <italic>ATX1</italic>-regulated loci. By chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays, we compared modification patterns of a constitutively expressed housekeeping gene, of a tissue-specific gene, and among genes that differed in degrees of transcriptional activity. Our results suggest that the di-methylated isoform of histone H3-lysine4 (m<sup>2</sup>K4/H3) provide a general mark for gene-related sequences distinguishing them from non-transcribed regions. Lys-4 (K4/H3), lys-9 (K9/H3) and lys-27 (K27/H3) nucleosome methylation patterns of plant genes may be gene-, tissue- or development-regulated. Absence of nucleosomes from the <italic>LTP</italic>-promotor was not sufficient to provoke robust transcription in mutant <italic>atx1</italic>-leaf chromatin, suggesting that the mechanism repositioning nucleosomes at transition to flowering functioned independently of ATX1.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Histone-tail modifications provide &#x02018;tags&#x02019; that are &#x02018;read&#x02019; by factors recognizing the modified residue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>). The mechanism constitutes a &#x02018;code&#x02019; that may instruct gene activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>). Different biological systems have evolved specific ways of implementing and translating the code suggesting that the histone-tail &#x02018;language&#x02019; is taxon (species) specific (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>). For example, di-methylated K4/H3 (m<sup>2</sup>K4/H3) modification is genome-wide in yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>) while in metazoa, m<sup>2</sup>K4/H3 is concentrated around genes largely overlapping with tri-methylated (m<sup>3</sup>K4/H3) modifications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>). Methylation at K4/H3 (mK4/H3) is linked with both active and non-active genes in <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>, dependent on whether two- or three-of the lysine-NH<sub>2</sub>-groups are methylated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>). Eukaryotes may use specific &#x02018;dialects&#x02019; of the epigenetic language (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>) making deciphering a challenge.</p><p>Because of the totipotency of plant cells, plants have developed epigenetic mechanisms that are related, but not identical, with those of animals or yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>). Plants have a unique histone deacetylase (HDAC) family, a unique plant chromodomain DNA-methyltransferase (CMT) family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>), may have acetylated and methylated histone residues other than in known chromatins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>), and might &#x02018;read&#x02019; information encoded in the modifications in a different way. For example, the <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> gene <italic>LHP1</italic>, although structurally similar to the animal <italic>HP1</italic> gene, does not function in heterochromatin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>). There is no homolog of <italic>Polycomb</italic> in the <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> genome and the K27/H3 modification is read in a plant-specific way: m<sup>2</sup>K27/H3 needs to be present simultaneously with m<sup>2</sup>K9/H3 in order to keep the <italic>SUP</italic> and <italic>FWA</italic> genes inactive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>). Methylated K9/H3 and K27/H3 were also found at the silenced <italic>FLC</italic> locus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>).</p><p>Less is known about histone-tail methylations associated with plant gene activation. Available data indicate the presence of m<sup>2</sup>K4/H3 at one plant locus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>) and provide evidence that <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> euchromatin, in general, is enriched in m<sup>2</sup>K4/H3, while heterochromatin is depleted in m<sup>2</sup>K9/H3 but enriched in m<sup>2</sup>K4/H3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>). Whether the tri-methylated version of K4/H3 (m<sup>3</sup>K4/H3) is associated with gene activation in plants, whether di- and tri-mK4/H3 co-localize at plant genes as in animals, or whether their distribution is analogous to that in yeast, is still unknown. A recent study reported interesting correlations between methylation and acetylation of several lysines of histone H3 isoforms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>). However, it is still unknown whether methylation of K4/H3 influences (cross-talks with) methylations at K9/H3 or K27/H3 at active or non-active gene loci.</p><p>Earlier, we have shown that loss-of-ATX1 function had pleiotropic effects in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> and that the mRNA levels of several flower homeotic genes were decreased in <italic>atx1</italic> mutant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>). Recombinant ATX1-SET-domain peptides displayed weak K4/H3 methyltransferase activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>) suggesting that lowered expression might be due to loss-of-methylated K4/H3. The highly selective ATX1 effect upon some, but not all, homeotic genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>) and microarray data (unpublished data) suggested that ATX1 was not involved in a genome-wide methylation of K4/H3. Here, we have determined that ATX1 is involved in the methylation of only a fraction of the overall histone H3-K4-residues. Nucleosomal methylation profiles were established at two ATX1-regulated loci: the ATX1- activated gene, <italic>LTP</italic>, and the ATX1-downregulated gene, <italic>XET</italic>. Their methylated profiles were compared with those of genes not regulated by ATX1, <italic>SUP</italic> and <italic>ACT7</italic>. In order to &#x02018;read&#x02019; the H3-tail methylation code, we examined genes when expressed at low, moderate or high levels. To determine whether m<sup>2</sup>H3/K4 and m<sup>3</sup>H3/K4 co-localized at the start of transcription or throughout the gene sequence, we examined regions 5&#x02032;-upstream (including the promotor) and downstream gene-coding (G)-regions; finally, we asked whether a gene transcribed in a tissue-specific manner would be similarly &#x02018;tagged&#x02019; as an ubiquitously expressed housekeeping gene. To be able to correlate transcriptional activity with the methylation profile, we tested non-transcribed intergenic regions flanking a gene in activated and in silent states. We found that although di- and tri-methylated K4/H3 was often associated with transcriptionally active genes, mere presence of the tags did not necessarily define, or was not sufficient to induce, gene expression. Di-methylated K4/H3 was found on nucleosomes of all tested gene sequences, independent of whether the gene was active or not. It was also found in various combinations with m<sup>3</sup>K4/H3, m<sup>2</sup>K9/H3 and m<sup>2</sup>K27/H3. Absence of m<sup>2</sup>K4/H3 from intergenic regions suggested that this modification could be a general mark that distinguishes genes from non-transcribed sequences. Unlike patterns reported in animals or yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>), m<sup>3</sup>K4/H3 always co-localized with m<sup>2</sup>K4/H3 at both the 5&#x02032; end and downstream gene regions. We also found that the absent m<sup>3</sup>K4/H3 did not necessarily correlate with low expression, that specific regulators (activators and repressors) affect transcription independently of H3-tail methylations, and that transcribing states might be labeled by different combinations of methylation tags at the promotor, in the gene-coding regions, or in both, in a gene-, tissue- and development-specific mode.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><p><bold>ChIP Assays</bold> were performed following the established protocols (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>) with modifications. Four-week-old <italic>Arabidopsis atx1</italic> and wild-type plants were harvested after grown on soil. Two grams each of flowers, leaves and stems were immersed at room temperature in buffer A [0.4 M sucrose, 10 mM Tris&#x02013;HCl (pH 8), 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF) and 1% formaldehyde] and kept under vacuum for 10 min. The cross-linking reaction was stopped by adding glycine to a final concentration of 100 mM, and by placing the tissue under vacuum for additional 5 min. The tissue was then washed with sterile de-ionized water, and frozen in liquid nitrogen. Frozen tissue was ground to a fine powder and re-suspended in 20 ml of cold nuclei isolation buffer [NIB; 15 mM PIPES (pH 6.8), 5 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 60 mM KCl, 0.25 M sucrose, 15 mM NaCl, 1 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 0.9% Triton X-100, 1 mM PMSF, 2 &#x000b5;g/ml pepstatin and 2 &#x000b5;g/ml aprotinin] as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>). The slurry was filtered through four layers of cheesecloth and the filtrate was centrifuged at 10&#x02009;000 <italic>g</italic> for 20 min on a Sorvall SA-600 rotor. The pellet (nuclei) was re-suspended in 3 ml lysis buffer [50 mM HEPES (pH 7.5), 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 1 mM PMSF, 10 mM Na butyrate, 1 &#x000b5;g/ml aprotinin and 1 &#x000b5;g/ml pepstatin A) and the DNA was sheared by sonication to &#x0223c;1000 bp fragments. To pellet debris, the sample was centrifuged for 10 min at 13&#x02009;000 r.p.m. (Sorvall SA-600 rotor), the supernatant (sonicated chromatin) was collected and used further.</p><p>Before immunoprecipitation experiments, calibration curves were constructed to determine the optimal amounts of chromatin to be used in each experiment and to ensure equivalent amounts of starting material. Serially diluted chromatin samples were used to define the point when detectable bands would be amplified from tested chromatin templates (immunoprecipitated with each of the four anti-methyl antibodies) while controls (mock ChIP-ed chromatin templates) would be below concentrations capable of amplifying visible bands. Titration assays were carried out for each immunoprecipitation experiment as follows: 50 &#x000b5;l, 100 &#x000b5;l, 200 &#x000b5;l and 300 &#x000b5;l aliquots of the supernatants adjusted to 500 &#x000b5;l with lysis buffer were pre-cleared with 60 &#x000b5;l salmon sperm (SS) DNA/Protein-A agarose (Upstate) for 50 min at 4&#x000b0;C and centrifuged. Supernatant was incubated with 60 &#x000b5;l SS DNA/Protein-A agarose without antibodies for 2 h at 4&#x000b0;C as negative control fractions (described below). An aliquot (50 &#x000b5;l) of sonicated chromatin diluted 10-fold in lysis buffer, contained the following amounts of DNA: 10.13 &#x000b5;g for <italic>atx1</italic> flowers, 6.6 &#x000b5;g for <italic>atx1</italic> leaves, 5.25 &#x000b5;g for <italic>atx1</italic> stems, 7.7 &#x000b5;g for wild-type flowers, 7.5 &#x000b5;g for wild-type leaves, and 7.2 &#x000b5;g for wild-type stems.</p><p>For the immunoprecipitation experiments, aliquoted samples were pre-cleared, as described above, and the supernatant fraction was incubated with 5 &#x000b5;l of the respective antibody (Upstate): anti-dimethyl-Histone H3 [Lys-9], product #07&#x02013;441, anti-dimethyl-Histone H3 [Lys-4] #07&#x02013;030, anti-trimethyl-Histone [Lys-4] #07&#x02013;473, anti-dimethyl-Histone H3 [Lys-27] #07&#x02013;322 and anti-Histone H3 #06&#x02013;755. After overnight incubation with rotation at 4&#x000b0;C, 60 &#x000b5;l SS DNA/Protein-A agarose were added and incubation was continued for 2 h at 4&#x000b0;C. The agarose beads were then washed for 4 min at 4&#x000b0;C, with 1 ml of each of the following: low salt wash buffer, high salt wash buffer (Upstate), LNDET [0.25 M LiCl, 1% NP40, 1% deoxycholate, 1 mM EDTA and 10 mM Tris (pH 8)]; finally, beads were washed three times with 1 ml TE buffer [10 mM Tris&#x02013;HCl (pH 8) and 1 mM EDTA]. Immuno-complexes were eluted from the beads after two washings with 250 &#x000b5;l of freshly prepared elution buffer (1% SDS and 0.1 M NaHCO<sub>3</sub>) and were incubated at room temperature for 15 min with rotation. The eluates were combined with 20 &#x000b5;l of 5 M NaCl, and crosslinks were broken by incubation at 65&#x000b0;C for 5&#x02013;6 h. Residual protein was degraded by incubation with 20 &#x000b5;g of Prot K, incubated at 45&#x000b0;C for 1 h, followed by phenol extraction and ethanol precipitation. The DNA was re-suspended in 20 &#x000b5;l sterile distilled water.</p><p>Antibodies specific against ATX1 were raised in rabbits (CoCalico) and ChIP experiments were performed following a similar protocol.</p><p>An aliquot (50 &#x000b5;l) of the initial sonicated chromatin solution was treated to reverse the crosslinks and was used as a template for input samples. Titration assays with a series of diluted mock treated samples were performed with each set of primers used in the study to ensure that comparable amounts were used as templates in the PCR. Each immunoprecipitation experiment was independently performed at least three times. All PCR were done in 25 &#x000b5;l: 5 min at 95&#x000b0;C, followed by 35 cycles of 95&#x000b0;C for 30 s, 56&#x000b0;C for 30 sec, 72&#x000b0;C for 2 min and 72&#x000b0;C for 5 min.

Di-(m<sup>2</sup>K4/H3) and tri-(m<sup>3</sup>K4/H3) methylated levels were measured and compared in histones isolated from <italic>atx1</italic> and from wild-type plants. The amount of loaded histone H3 in each sample was determined from western blots using antibodies specific against non-methylated H3. Signals from bands obtained with methylation specific antibodies were normalized against the respective histone H3 amounts (measured as signal-intensities of western-blot bands obtained with anti-histone H3-antibodies). This approach allowed us to evaluate even small variations in the methylation levels of overall K4/H3. Data from six independent measurements consistently indicated that histone H3 from the <italic>atx1</italic> mutants displayed lower K4 methylation (6&#x02013;8% of m<sup>2</sup>K4/H3 and &#x0223c;15% of less m<sup>3</sup>K4/H3) than histone H3 from wild-type. Apparently, other methyltransferases contribute for the genome-wide K4/H3-modifications in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>.</p></sec><sec><title>Histone H3-tail methylation of the <italic>LTP</italic> gene up-regulated by ATX1</title><p>The <italic>LTP</italic> gene, a member of an antimicrobial peptide family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>), was highly expressed in wild-type vegetative tissues (leaves and stems), to a lesser degree in flowers, but was significantly downregulated in all tested <italic>atx1</italic> mutant chromatins. The results indicated that ATX1 positively controlled <italic>LTP</italic> expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>). To examine how repression by ATX1-loss-of function would influence <italic>LTP</italic> methylation profiles, we performed ChIP analyses with chromatins of three different tissues isolated from wild-type and from <italic>atx1</italic> plants.</p><p>In wild-type flower chromatin (moderately expressing <italic>LTP</italic>), we documented presence of all four methylated modifications (m<sup>2</sup>K9/H3, m<sup>2</sup>K27/H3, m<sup>2</sup>K4/H3 and m<sup>3</sup>K4/H3) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2c</xref>). In the highly expressing leaf and stem chromatins, the patterns were different: the nucleosomes from the (G)-region retained the m<sup>2</sup>H3/K4 and m<sup>3</sup>H3/K4-tags but the m<sup>2</sup>K9/H3 and m<sup>2</sup>K27/H3 bands were not present. Given the results from other chromatin experiments, the association of active genes with methylated K4/H3 (in di- and tri- isoforms) were not unexpected. However, the observation that moderately transcribed genes associated with multiple methylated lysines of the histone H3-tails is novel. Similar patterns were displayed by other genes (see below), suggesting that these might be general &#x02018;tags&#x02019; for &#x02018;moderately&#x02019;-expressing states in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>.</p><p>In <italic>atx1</italic> mutants, lack of m<sup>3</sup>H3/K4 on nucleosomes from both 5&#x02032; end and (G)- sequences, correlated with lowered <italic>LTP</italic> expression in <italic>atx1</italic> chromatins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a and c</xref>; see also <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3d</xref>). Absence of m<sup>3</sup>H3/K4 bands clearly implicated ATX1 in the methylation of <italic>LTP</italic> nucleosomes but presence of m<sup>2</sup>H3/K4 on some <italic>atx1</italic> nucleosomes suggested that ATX1 was not involved in di-methylating K4/H3 at <italic>LTP</italic>.</p></sec><sec><title>The <italic>LTP</italic>-promotor region in actively expressing leaf chromatin is depleted of nucleosomes</title><p>Most striking was the disappearance of all methylation signals from the 5&#x02032;-<italic>LTP</italic> nucleosomes in highly expressing leaf and stem chromatins. This was an <italic>LTP</italic>-specific feature because another gene, <italic>XET</italic>, displayed clear methylation bands at its 5&#x02032;-sequence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3c</xref>).

The results indicated that the 5&#x02032;-<italic>LTP</italic> sequence was devoid of nucleosomes in leaf chromatin but that it was associated with nucleosomes in flower chromatin. Absence of nucleosomes from the leaf <italic>LTP</italic>-promotor was a gene-specific feature, because the 5&#x02032;-region of a different gene, <italic>XET</italic>, was successfully recovered from the same leaf chromatin preparation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2d</xref>).</p><p>These conclusions were independently confirmed by micrococcal nuclease (MNase)-digestion experiments. Increased nuclease sensitivity at the 5&#x02032;-<italic>LTP</italic> region displayed by leaf, but not flower chromatin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2e</xref>) correlated with the higher transcribed state of <italic>LTP</italic> in leaves than in flowers. The relative resistance of the <italic>XET</italic> promotor region to MN-digestion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2e</xref>) pointed to gene-specific differences in the structure of the two promotors. Collectively, the results reinforced the idea that chromatin structure of the 5&#x02032;-<italic>LTP</italic> region was gene- and tissue-specific.</p><p>Interestingly, although <italic>LTP</italic> was poorly expressed in <italic>atx1</italic>-leaf and stem chromatins, the respective promotor regions were devoid of nucleosomes similar to the structures observed in the wild-type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2c</xref>, and data not shown). This suggested that removal of nucleosomes was not sufficient to provoke robust transcription and that the mechanism positioning the nucleosomes at the <italic>LTP</italic>-promotor was not ATX1-dependent.</p></sec><sec><title>Histone H3-tail methylation profile of a gene downregulated by ATX1</title><p>Microarray analyses (unpublished data) revealed that about one-half of the 1600 genes with altered expression in <italic>atx1</italic> background were significantly up-regulated, suggesting that ATX1 was repressing these genes in the wild-type. It was a puzzling observation because trithorax factors and H3/K4 methylation, in general, are associated with activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>). Thus, we were interested to find out how ATX1-related silencing would be reflected in the H3-methylation profiles. The <italic>XET</italic> gene, a putative xyloglucosyl transferase, was expressed at comparable levels in wild-type flowers, leaves and stems (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a</xref>). In <italic>atx1</italic> background, <italic>XET</italic> showed unexpectedly diverse patterns: almost silent in <italic>atx1</italic> leaves and flowers but overexpressed &#x0223c;9.5-fold in the <italic>atx1</italic> stems. This result provided the opportunity to study methylation profiles at different degrees of <italic>XET</italic>-transcriptional activity and an involvement of ATX1 in its regulation.</p><p>The nucleosomes from the 5&#x02032;-<italic>XET</italic> region in moderately expressing wild-type flower, leaf and stem chromatins carried all four H3-tail lysine methylations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3c</xref>), similar to the patterns observed with the moderately expressed <italic>LTP</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2c</xref>). However, the methylation profiles of <italic>XET</italic> (G)-nucleosomes were not the same in leaf, flower and stem chromatins illustrating tissue-specific variations of lysine methylations &#x02018;encoded&#x02019; at the same locus.</p></sec><sec><title>A role of ATX1 in the control of <italic>XET</italic> and <italic>LTP</italic> genes</title><p>An unexpected result from the ChIP analyses was low, sometimes absent, m<sup>3</sup>K4/H3 signal from nucleosomes in <italic>XET</italic>-expressing chromatins (wild-type leaves and stems). Particularly striking was the absence of m<sup>3</sup>K4/H3 from (G)-nucleosomes in <italic>atx1</italic> stems overexpressing <italic>XET</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3c</xref>). On the other hand, m<sup>3</sup>K4/H3 bands were present in low-expressing <italic>atx1</italic> flower and leaf chromatins. The results suggested that an m<sup>3</sup>H3/K4 tag was not a requirement, or a predictor, of <italic>XET</italic> activity and that a methylase different from ATX1 was engaged in methylating <italic>XET</italic>-nucleosomes. Despite this result, however, repression of <italic>XET</italic> in <italic>atx1</italic> flowers and leaves, as well as its de-repression in <italic>atx1</italic> stems, clearly implicated ATX1 in the regulation of <italic>XET</italic>. We hypothesized that ATX1 did not interact directly with <italic>XET</italic>-nucleosomes but that it exercised its effect indirectly, i.e. through an activator (in flowers and leaves) or a repressor (in stems).</p><p>To test whether ATX1 targeted the 5&#x02032;-<italic>XET</italic>-nucleosomes directly, we performed ChIP assays with anti-ATX1 specific antibodies. Neither leaf nor flower chromatins provided a template for the amplification of the 5&#x02032;-<italic>XET</italic> region after immunoprecipitation with anti-ATX1 antibodies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3d</xref>). As a control, we used 5&#x02032;-<italic>LTP</italic>-specific primers and the same chromatin preparations to amplify the <italic>LTP</italic>-promotor region. The expected <italic>LTP</italic> band was recovered from flower, but not from leaf chromatin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3d</xref>). The results were interpreted as ATX1 not being bound to 5&#x02032;-<italic>XET</italic>-nucleosomes in either flower or leaf chromatins and as ATX1 being associated with 5&#x02032;-<italic>LTP</italic> nucleosomes in flower, but not in leaf chromatin. The latter conclusion agreed with earlier results showing a lack of nucleosomes in the <italic>LTP</italic>-promotor region in leaves.</p></sec><sec><title>Histone H3-tail methylation patterns of tissue-specific and of ubiquitously expressed genes not regulated by ATX1</title><p>To compare modification patterns of a gene activated in a tissue-specific manner with a ubiquitously expressed housekeeping gene, we investigated <italic>SUPERMAN</italic> (<italic>SUP</italic>) and <italic>ACTIN7</italic> (<italic>ACT</italic>) genes. The <italic>SUP</italic> gene is expressed in both wild-type and <italic>atx1</italic> flowers but not leaves; the <italic>ACT</italic> gene shows comparably high expression in leaves and flowers unchanged by ATX1-loss-of function (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4a</xref>). Clearly, neither <italic>SUP</italic> nor <italic>ACT</italic> was controlled by ATX1. When transcriptionally silent, <italic>SUP</italic> carried m<sup>2</sup>K9/H3 and m<sup>2</sup>K27/H3 on both 5&#x02032; end and (G)-nucleosomes; upon activation in flower chromatin, m<sup>2</sup>K9/H3 levels decreased while the methylation at K27/H3 did not change significantly. This result agreed with an earlier report that the simultaneous presence of both m<sup>2</sup>K9/H3 and m<sup>2</sup>K27/H3 was needed to keep the <italic>SUP</italic> gene silent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>). However, presence of m<sup>2</sup>K4/H3, regardless of whether <italic>SUP</italic> was active or silent, was unusual. Tri-methylated K4/H3 was found in association only with the active <italic>SUP</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4c</xref>). Because ATX1 did not regulate <italic>SUP</italic>, it is evident that a different methylase modified <italic>SUP</italic> histones. At the <italic>SUP</italic> locus, m<sup>2</sup>K4/H3 co-existed with m<sup>2</sup>K9/H3 and m<sup>2</sup>K27/H3 but m<sup>3</sup>K4/H3 was found only with m<sup>2</sup>K4/H3 and m<sup>2</sup>K27/H3.</p><p>To correlate transcriptional activity with methylation profile, we analyzed the distribution of methylated residues on nucleosomes from non-transcribed intergenic regions flanking <italic>SUP</italic>. We wished to determine whether/how changes associated with transcriptional activation of <italic>SUP</italic> (i.e. disappearance of m<sup>2</sup>K9/H3 and concomitant appearance of m<sup>3</sup>K4/H3) would correlate with the methylation patterns of nucleosomes from adjacent upstream and downstream sequences. ChIP analysis of flower and leaf chromatins showed that nucleosomes from the flanking intergenic regions carried only m<sup>2</sup>K9/H3 and m<sup>2</sup>K27/H3 tags (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4d</xref>) regardless of whether <italic>SUP</italic> was active or not. Notably methylations were absent at K4/H3 of intergenic nucleosomes suggesting that K4 methylation might label only histones from transcribed regions.</p><p>In the actively transcribed housekeeping gene, <italic>ACT</italic>, we detected methylations only at K4 of histone H3-tails, while neither K9/H3 nor K27/H3 were modified. Apparently, different combinations of methylation tags label active states of a tissue-specific gene and of a housekeeping gene. The patterns remained unchanged in <italic>atx1</italic> background supporting non-involvement of ATX1 in <italic>ACT</italic> regulation.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>ATX1 is involved in methylating histone H3- lysine 4 of only a fraction of <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> nucleosomes. ATX1-loss-of function affected &#x0223c;15% of the overall tri- and &#x0003e;10% of the di-methylations suggesting that it is not responsible for overall K4/H3 methylations. Clearly, other plant methyltransferases are involved in genome-wide K4/H3 modification. The presence of multiple <italic>Trithorax</italic> and <italic>Trithorax-related</italic> genes in the <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> genome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref>), as well as the highly selective ATX1-effects upon some, but not all, homeotic genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>) are in agreement with this idea. Plant Trithorax factors may target specific nucleosomes, attesting further to the complexity of the plant code.</p><p>To reveal correlations between methylation profiles and the degree of transcriptional activity, we investigated genes in different expression states. These included a gene with tissue-specific expression activated by ATX1 (<italic>LTP</italic>) and a gene with comparable transcription levels in different wild-type tissues but altering expression in a tissue-specific mode in the absence of ATX1 (<italic>XET</italic>). Their methylation patterns were compared with patterns of genes not controlled by ATX1&#x02014;a tissue-specific gene (<italic>SUP</italic>) and a housekeeping gene (<italic>ACT7</italic>).</p><p>A common feature displayed by the highly expressed genes, <italic>ACT</italic> and <italic>LTP</italic> (in leaves and stems) was that both carried only K4/H3 tags. Another actively transcribed gene, however, (<italic>SUP</italic> in flower chromatin), in addition to carrying the two K4-tags (m<sup>2</sup>K4/H3 and m<sup>3</sup>K4/H3) also carried m<sup>2</sup>K27/H3. It was surprising that highly active states of gene expression did not always correlate with high levels of m<sup>3</sup>K4/H3, as seen with overexpressed <italic>XET</italic> in <italic>atx1</italic>-stem chromatin and with the 5&#x02032;-<italic>LTP</italic> in wild-type stems and leaves. Presence of m<sup>3</sup>H3/K4 did not necessarily associate with augmented expression, as shown by <italic>XET</italic> in <italic>atx1</italic> flower and leaf chromatins. Thus, presence of an m<sup>3</sup>H3/K4 tag was not a general requirement or predictor of gene activity in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>.</p><p>Moderately and low-expressed genes could be labeled by all four modifications as well as by various combinations of &#x02018;silencing&#x02019; (m<sup>2</sup>K27/H3 or m<sup>2</sup>K9/H3) and &#x02018;activating&#x02019; (m<sup>2</sup>K4/H3 or m<sup>3</sup>K4/H3) tags (<italic>LTP</italic> in flowers, <italic>XET</italic> in wild-type flowers, leaves and stems). A combination of several lysine methylations might represent a general mode of &#x02018;tagging&#x02019; plant genes when transcribed below their full potential. Inactive/low expression states usually lack m<sup>3</sup>K4/H3 but carry m<sup>2</sup>K4/H3 (i.e. <italic>SUP</italic> in leaves, <italic>LTP</italic> in <italic>atx1</italic> flowers and leaves). However, absence of m<sup>3</sup>K4/H3 did not necessarily define low expression (<italic>XET</italic> in <italic>atx1</italic> stems) neither did presence of m<sup>2</sup>K4/H3 and m<sup>3</sup>K4/H3 cause activation of the silenced <italic>XET</italic> in <italic>atx1</italic>-leaf and flower chromatins.</p><p>A gene expressed in a tissue-specific manner and a constantly expressed (house keeping) gene displayed different methylation patterns: the active housekeeping gene carried only K4/H3-methylation, while various combinations of methylation were associated with the active and silent states of <italic>SUP</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4c and f</xref>).</p><p>Presence of di-methylated K4/H3 in all tested gene loci and its absence from non-transcribed intergenic space, suggested that m<sup>2</sup>K4/H3 could provide a general mark for gene-related sequences distinguishing them from non-transcribed regions. m<sup>2</sup>K4/H3 was found in various combinations with other H3-tail lysine methylations, independent of whether pertinent genes were actively transcribed or not. In active genes, m<sup>2</sup>K4/H3 usually co-localized with m<sup>3</sup>K4/H3 at both the 5&#x02032;- and the downstream regions. Thereby, the distribution of the K4/H3 methylations of the tested <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> genes was unlike the pattern reported in yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>) or the clustering found at transcription start sites of animal genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>).</p><p>ATX1 may act as both an activator and a repressor of <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> genes. For a clue how this might be achieved at the molecular level, we compared the profiles of ATX1-activated (<italic>LTP</italic>) and repressed (<italic>XET</italic>) genes in <italic>atx1</italic> mutants. Absence of m<sup>3</sup>K4/H3 labels and decreased transcription of <italic>LTP</italic> correlated with loss-of ATX1 function (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). In contrast, the methylation profiles associated with active and inactive states of <italic>XET</italic> in <italic>atx1</italic> mutants differed from those displayed by <italic>LTP</italic>. Histones from low-expressing <italic>atx1</italic> flower and leaf chromatins carried di- and tri-methylated K4/H3. The results suggested that a different methylase was involved at the <italic>XET</italic> locus and that the presence of &#x02018;activating&#x02019; labels was not sufficient to stimulate gene expression.</p><p>The observation that overexpressed <italic>XET</italic> in <italic>atx1</italic>-stem chromatin displayed low levels of m<sup>3</sup>K4/H3 was very unusual. It suggested that factors other than histone H3-methylases were dominant for the control of <italic>XET</italic>. However, the effect of ATX1-loss-of function upon <italic>XET</italic> expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a</xref>) clearly implicated ATX1 in its regulation. Most likely, this is achieved through an indirect mechanism, e.g. by activating a specific <italic>XET</italic>-repressor in wild-type stems. Results from ChIP experiments with anti-ATX1 antibodies also agreed that ATX1 might be indirectly involved in the control of <italic>XET</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3d</xref>).</p><p>It is plausible that a stem-specific <italic>XET</italic>-repressor is related to factors influencing K9/H3 and K27/H3 methylations because these modifications were lower in <italic>atx1</italic>, than in wild-type, stems. However, it seems unlikely that low m<sup>2</sup>K27/H3 and m<sup>2</sup>K9/H3 levels were the main factors defining high <italic>XET</italic> expression: e.g. wild-type leaf and flower (G)-nucleosomes also displayed low, or absent, m<sup>2</sup>K27/H3 and m<sup>2</sup>K9/H3 tags, yet <italic>XET</italic> expression was about a magnitude lower than in <italic>atx1</italic> stems. On the other hand, presence of m<sup>2</sup>H3/K4 and m<sup>3</sup>H3/K4 in <italic>atx1</italic> flower and leaf chromatins was not sufficient to drive-up expression to levels comparable with the wild-type. Clearly, H3-lysine methylations were not a primary cause for the low <italic>XET</italic> expression in <italic>atx1</italic>-leaf and flower chromatins, or for the high expression in <italic>atx1</italic> stems. Tissue-specific regulators may affect expression independent of H3-tail methylation profiles. A plausible possibility is that loss-of-ATX1 function has deactivated tissue-specific regulators of <italic>XET</italic> transcription, an activator in leaves and flowers and a repressor in stems.</p><p>ChIP assays with antibodies against non-modified histone H3 revealed that the 5&#x02032;-<italic>LTP</italic> region was devoid of nucleosomes in actively transcribed leaf chromatin but that it was associated with nucleosomes in flower chromatin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2d</xref>). The absence of methylation bands and the increased nuclease sensitivity at the 5&#x02032;-<italic>LTP</italic> region in highly expressing leaf and stem chromatins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2c and e</xref>) provided independent support to this conclusion. Lack of nucleosomes from the leaf <italic>LTP</italic>-promotor was a gene-specific feature (compare with the 5&#x02032;-region of <italic>XET</italic>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2d and e</xref>). The nucleosomes were repositioned at the <italic>LTP</italic>-promotor with the transition to flowering concomitant with lowered transcriptional activity. The results indicated that the chromatin structure at the <italic>LTP</italic>-promotor was gene, tissue and development-stage-specific.</p><p>Interestingly, <italic>LTP</italic> was poorly expressed in <italic>atx1</italic>-leaf and stem chromatins although the respective 5&#x02032;-regions were similarly devoid of nucleosomes as the wild-type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2c</xref>, and data not shown). This fact demonstrated that removal of nucleosomes was not sufficient to provoke robust transcription and that the nucleosome-positioning mechanism at the <italic>LTP</italic> locus functioned independently of ATX1. In contrast with the reported role of methylated K4/H3 for nucleosomes positioning in yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref>), this result illustrated, once again, that plants might &#x02018;decode&#x02019; and implement histone H3-tail methylation information in a plant-specific way.</p><p>Collectively, our results demonstrated that the methylation patterns of lysine residues 4, 9 and 27 of histone H3-tails could not serve as general indicators, or predictors, for the state of expression activity in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>. Transcriptionally active genes may be labeled by different combinations of methylation tags at the promotor, in the gene-coding region, or in both. The resulting patterns are much more complex than currently acknowledged and might be developmentally regulated, gene- and tissue-specific. It remains to be established whether histone H3-tail lysine methylation modifications precede or trail established transcriptionally active states.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors are indebted to T.
