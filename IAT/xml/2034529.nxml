These processes are delicately balanced to ensure the maintenance of normal epithelial function. During wound healing, these processes must be reprogrammed in coordination to achieve a rapid re-epithelialization. Basonuclin (Bnc1) is a cell-type-specific transcription factor expressed mainly in the proliferative keratinocytes of stratified epithelium (e.g., corneal epithelium, epidermis and esophageal epithelium) and the gametogenic cells in testis and ovary. Our previous work suggested that basonuclin could regulate transcription of ribosomal RNA genes (rDNA) and genes involved in chromatin structure, transcription regulation, cell-cell junction/communication, ion-channels and intracelllular transportation. However, basonuclin's role in keratinocytes has not been demonstrated in vivo. Here we show that basonuclin-null mutation disrupts corneal epithelium homeostasis and delays wound healing by impairing cell proliferation. In basonuclin-null cornea epithelium, RNA polymerase I (Pol I) transcription is perturbed. This perturbation is unique because it affects transcripts from a subset of rDNA. Basonuclin-null mutation also perturbs RNA polymerase II (Pol II) transcripts from genes encoding chromatin structure proteins histone 3 and HMG2, transcription factor Gli2, gap-junction protein connexin 43 and adheren E-cadherin. In most cases, a concerted change in mRNA and protein level is observed. However, for E-cadherin, despite a notable increase in its mRNA level, its protein level was reduced. In conclusion, our study establishes basonuclin as a regulator of corneal epithelium homeostasis and maintenance. Basonuclin likely coordinates functions of a subset of ribosomal RNA genes (rDNA) and a group of protein coding genes in cellular processes critical for the regulation of cell proliferation.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="12"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>The adult mouse cornea is comprised of three tissue layers: a surface of stratified epithelium, a collagenous stroma underneath and an inner endothelium. The corneal epithelium is a self-renewing tissue, whose maintenance requires continuous cell proliferation throughout life. In addition to its light refraction function, corneal epithelium also serves as a protective barrier to the external environment. This barrier function makes corneal epithelium susceptible to a variety of mechanical and chemical injuries. Conceivably, a corneal epithelium that can rapidly repair wounds would convey selective advantages to animals, whose survival relies on vision.</p><p>Two cellular processes are essential for corneal epithelium maintenance and wound repair: cell proliferation and cell adhesion. In normal renewing, corneal epithelium stratification (thickness) is maintained by a balance between cell proliferation at the basal layer and cell shedding at the surface. This life-long continuous upward cell flux is driven by the corneal epithelium stem cells resided in the limbus region <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001087-Cotsarelis1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001087-Sun1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>. Accompanying the surface-ward cell migration is a differentiation process, which involves, among other things, remodeling of cell-cell junction and communication (e.g., formation of tight junctions, gap junctions and ion channels in the suprabasal wing cells) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001087-Sugrue1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001087-Danjo1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>. In wound healing, however, these processes are modified in order to achieve a rapid re-epithelialization <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001087-Lu1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>. In the commonly used wound healing model (i.e., epithelial debridement at central cornea), the healing process is divided into three sequential and partially overlapping steps: cell migration reduces and eventually covers the wound surface, cell proliferation provides cells to rebuild the tissue and tissue remodeling to restore the stratified epithelium <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001087-Danjo1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001087-Chen1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001087-Saika2">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Basonuclin (Bnc1) is a zinc finger protein with highly restricted tissue/cell distribution <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001087-Tseng2">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001087-Tseng3">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>. It is present in abundance in only two types of cells: basal keratinocytes of stratified epithelium (e.g., corneal epithelium and epidermis), and the reproductive germ cells of testis and ovary (i.e., oocytes and spermatogenic cells) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001087-Tseng4">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001087-Green1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>. In mouse corneal epithelium, basonuclin expression is restricted to the basal keratinocytes in the central cornea; it is not detected in the limbal region, suggesting its absence in the multi-potent stem cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001087-Tseng5">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>. Basonuclin protein appears in the corneal basal keratinocyte at post-natal day 4, first in a few cells and then spread to the entire basal cell population on day 20 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001087-Tseng5">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>. Thus, in early neonatal period, basonuclin expression coincides with active cellular proliferation, which peaks at day 10 prior to eye opening <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001087-Zieske1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>. This expression pattern and the basal-cell location of basonuclin strongly suggested its role in cell proliferation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001087-Tseng3">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001087-Tseng5">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Basonuclin is a transcription factor with multiple functions. Biochemically, DNase I footprinting showed that basonuclin interacted with ribosomal RNA gene (rDNA) promoter at three highly conserved binding sites in human and mouse <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001087-Iuchi1">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001087-Zhang1">&#x0005b;25&#x0005d;</xref>. Consistent with this interaction, basonuclin remained at the rDNA loci during mitosis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001087-Tseng6">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref>, a typical behavior of transcription factors for Pol I, which is solely responsible for transcribing rDNA. Furthermore, basonuclin zinc fingers were shown to act as a dominant-negative agent to inhibit Pol I transcription in mouse oocytes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001087-Tian1">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref>. These observations strongly suggest that basonuclin plays a role in Pol I transcription regulation. Basonuclin is unique among the known regulators of Pol I transcription in that its expression is cell-type-specific and it functions in regulating a subset of rDNA. Such a novel ability was first hinted in our study of basonuclin-deficient oocytes. Run-on assays showed that in basonuclin-deficient oocytes, the number of Pol I transcription foci was reduced by &#x0223c;25&#x00025;, and the transcriptional activity of the remaining foci, as judged by BrU incorporation, was not changed <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001087-Ma1">&#x0005b;26&#x0005d;</xref>. Similarly, we showed in HaCaT cells, a transformed human keratinocyte line, that basonuclin interacted with rDNA promoters that differed from those bound with UBF, a ubiquitous Pol I transcription regulator <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001087-Zhang1">&#x0005b;25&#x0005d;</xref>. These observations support the notion that basonuclin regulates a subset of rDNA and lead us to search for rDNA variants that are regulated cell-type-specifically. As a result, we isolated seven rDNA variants (v-rDNAs) and showed, for the first time, that they were regulated differentially in different tissues (Tseng et al. submitted).</p><p>Another major difference of basonuclin and a dedicated Pol I transcription factor (e.g., UBF) is that basonuclin is also abundant in nucleoplasm and can interact with Pol II promoters. Indeed, a recent bioinformatic study detected basonuclin binding sites in the promoter regions of more than 20 genes, which belong to pathways involved in chromatin structure, transcription, cell-cell adhesion/communication, ion-channels and intracellular protein transportation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001087-Wang1">&#x0005b;27&#x0005d;</xref>. The dual function of basonuclin to regulate two groups of genes, (i.e., Pol I- and Pol II-transcribed) suggests that it coordinates the function of these genes. Thus, basonuclin is likely a coactivator-like regulator. The concept of coactivator is that a regulator can mobilize multiple pathways to achieve a cellular function <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001087-OMalley1">&#x0005b;28&#x0005d;</xref>. The coactivators were initially thought to function as adaptors for transcription factors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001087-Naar1">&#x0005b;29&#x0005d;</xref>, but their actions have now expanded to chromatin modification and remodeling, transcription initiation, elongation, RNA splicing and protein degradation. The range of target pathways of coactivators has also increased to encompass cell development, proliferation, energy-expenditure and carbohydrate- metabolism <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001087-Picard1">&#x0005b;30&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001087-Louet1">&#x0005b;32&#x0005d;</xref>. These coactivators are therefore coordinators of multiple cellular pathways.</p><p>Despite these advances in understanding basonuclin function, its requirement in keratinocyte function has not been studied in vivo. Here we report the construction of a basonuclin-null mouse and characterization of basonuclin-null corneal epithelium. We show that basonuclin-null mutation impairs keratinocyte proliferation. We present in vivo evidence supporting the notion that basonuclin regulates transcription of a subset of rDNA and a selective group of protein-coding genes. We propose that basonuclin is a critical regulator for corneal epithelium homeostasis.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Construction of Bnc1-null mouse</title><p>We designed a basonuclin conditional-null allele, in which Exon 4 was targeted for deletion in the presence of Cre recombinase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001087-g001"><bold>Fig. 1</bold></xref>).

A significant delay in re-epithelialization, however, was observed in basonuclin-null epithelium at 40 and 72 hours post wounding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001087-g003"><bold>Fig. 3A</bold></xref>). At 40 hours, the wound area in basonuclin-null cornea was three times that of the control (three mice per genotype, or n&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;3, p&#x0003c;0.05), and at 72 hours, nearly six times (n&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;3, p&#x0003c;0.01) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001087-g003"><bold>Fig. 3A</bold></xref>), indicating a slower healing in the mutant at the later stage of re-epithelialization. Epithelium re-epithelialization was usually completed in two phases: first, cell migration reduced the wounded area and then cell proliferation regenerated the epithelium. The significant delay in the latter stage of wound healing suggested a defective cell proliferation. We assessed cell proliferation during wound healing by BrdU labeling, which detected cells in the S phase of the cell cycle. During the first six hours after wounding, the numbers of BrdU labeled cells in the control and basonuclin-null mice were similar to their pre-wounding value (0 hours), indicating cell proliferation had not been activated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001087-g003"><bold>Fig. 3B</bold></xref>). At 12 hours post-wounding, the number of BrdU-positive cells began to increase in the control, but not in basonuclin-null epithelium (n&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;3, p&#x0003c;0.01). A significant increase in BrdU incorporation was seen in basonuclin-null cells at 24 hours. The number of BrdU-positive cells was, however, still below that in the control (n&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;3, p&#x0003c;0.01). These data suggested that there was a delay in the onset of cell proliferation in basonuclin-null epithelium, which was consistent with the delay in the later stage of re-epithelialization in basonuclin-null cornea. Thus, basonuclin-null mutation impaired cell proliferation of corneal keratinocytes, which could account for both the thinning as well as the delayed wound healing of corneal epithelium.</p><fig id="pone-0001087-g003" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0001087.g003</object-id><label>Figure 3</label><caption><title>Wound healing is delayed in basonuclin-null corneal epithelium.</title><p>A, the upper panel shows representative images of the control (&#x0002b;/&#x0002b;) and basonuclin-null (&#x02212;/&#x02212;) eyes at different time points pre- and post-wounding.

Previously, based on basonuclin's basal location in the stratified epithelium and its presence in every stage of the cell cycle, including G0, we proposed that basonuclin played a role in keratinocyte proliferation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001087-Tseng3">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001087-Green1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>. Our study presented here confirms basonuclin's role in keratinocyte proliferation; it also suggests that basonuclin plays a role in the regulatory mechanism of cellular proliferation, but not the cell division process itself. This conclusion is deduced from the observation that basonuclin-null mutation does not affect neonatal corneal keratinocyte proliferation. During the formation of corneal epithelium in neonatal mouse (P1 to P14), corneal keratinocytes proliferate at a very high rate, and basonuclin expression is seen at the beginning of this proliferation period (i.e., around P3&#x02013;P4) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001087-Tseng5">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>. The coincidence of basonuclin's appearance and the rapid keratinocyte proliferation led us to postulate that basonuclin played a role in the high rate cell proliferation during corneal epithelium development. We were baffled, however, by the persistent high level basonuclin expression through out the adulthood after developmentally related proliferation had subsided post-eye-opening. Our study of basonuclin-null corneal epithelium provides a satisfactory resolution to this dilemma; basonuclin is required for the homeostasis but not development of corneal epithelium. In the basonuclin-null mouse, the neonatal development of this epithelium is not retarded, suggesting that basonuclin is not critically required in this process. Furthermore, this observation suggests that the defect of basonuclin-null mutation is not in the cell division mechanism. Cell proliferation is down-regulated after eye-opening around P14 in mouse, and is maintained at a low level during the rest of the life span <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001087-Zieske1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001087-Tseng5">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>. Our study suggests that basonuclin is required for maintaining an optimal level of cell proliferation necessary for corneal epithelium homeostasis, because we observed both a reduction in cell number and the proliferative (Ki67-positive) cells in the basonuclin-null corneal epithelium. An additional defect of basonuclin-null keratinocytes was revealed in the wound-healing process. In this case, the timing of the on-set of cellular proliferation is delayed, which suggest a signaling defect in mobilizing keratinocytes to respond the wound. The notion of a signaling defect is consistent with our hypothesis that basonuclin is a coordinator of multiple pathways. The slower mobilization of cellular proliferation therefore is likely due to the lack of coordination of various pathways participating in the mobilization process. Another logical conclusion is that the signaling (or coordination) mechanism controlling cell proliferation in neonatal corneal epithelium development differs from that functioning in adulthood for the homeostasis of this tissue.</p><p>The clear corneal phenotype of basonuclin (Bnc1)-null mutation suggests that it and basonuclin-2 (Bnc2), the second member of the basonuclin family, have non-overlapping functions.

Our current model systems (Bnc1-null and Bnc1-deficiency) are not suitable for addressing the issue of overlapping functions of the two proteins. The answer to this question awaits the development of a Bnc2-null mutation and the generation of a Bnc1-Bnc2 double null mutant.</p><p>Several previous reports and our study suggest cell proliferation is a major process in maintaining corneal thickness. The thinner corneal epithelium in basonuclin-null mouse is similar to the phenotype of several recently described mouse models (i.e., null mutants of Pax6, KLF4, AP2-alpha and HMGN1). The thinning of corneal epithelium suggests that homeostasis is perturbed by these null mutations. However, the causes of this perturbation appear quite different. For example, in adult SEY(&#x0002b;/&#x02212;), a heterozygotes of Pax6-null <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001087-Davis1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>, the thinning of cornea epithelium is likely due to a compromised cell adhesion, which results in large gaps between epithelial cells and a change in desmosomal junctions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001087-Davis1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>. In another example, the conditional null mutation of Kr&#x000fc;ppel-like transcription factor-4 (KLF4) reduces the corneal epithelium to only three to four cell layers by causing excessive sloughing <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001087-Swamynathan1">&#x0005b;45&#x0005d;</xref>. The third example concerns the conditional deletion of AP-2alpha (Le-AP-2alpha), which leads to a variable thickness of corneal epithelium (2 to 10 cell layers), and a thinner and discontinuous basement membrane <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001087-Dwivedi1">&#x0005b;39&#x0005d;</xref>. The null mutation of HMGN1, a member of the high-mobility group (HMG) proteins, gives rise to corneal epithelium thinning, which appears to be the consequence of an impaired keratinocyte differentiation program <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001087-Birger1">&#x0005b;38&#x0005d;</xref>. Notably, in the aforementioned four null mutants (i.e., SEY (&#x0002b;/&#x02212;), KLF4-null, Le-AP-2alpha-null and HMGN1), an up-regulation of proliferation in corneal epithelia is invariably observed, suggesting the existence of a feedback loop that regulates corneal thickness <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001087-Davis1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001087-Dwivedi1">&#x0005b;39&#x0005d;</xref>. When corneal epithelium becomes thinner due to deficiency in cell adhesion or other causes, cell proliferation is increased to compensate. Our analysis of basonuclin-null corneal epithelium provides the first evidence from another angle (i.e., down-regulation of cell proliferation) to support this model. Based on this analysis, we propose that under normal homeostasis, cell proliferation is constantly adjusted to counterbalance occasional perturbation in corneal thickness (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001087-g007"><bold>Fig. 7</bold></xref>). This proposal implies a monitoring mechanism of corneal homeostasis and a feedback mechanism to tune cell proliferation rate according to corneal thickness. A regulatory role of basonuclin in fine-tuning cell proliferation is consistent with basonuclin's location in basal keratinocytes of stratified epithelium.</p><fig id="pone-0001087-g007" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0001087.g007</object-id><label>Figure 7</label><caption><title>A model of maintenance of corneal epithelial homeostasis.</title><p>The model asserts that cell proliferation and cell adhesion are major processes and E-cadherin a molecular regulator in maintaining corneal epithelium homeostasis. The model also proposes a regulatory feedback loop in controlling corneal epithelial thickness. Any perturbation (e.g., thinning) in corneal thickness would be counterbalanced by adjustment in the rate of cell proliferation. The model is based on previous reports on null mutations of Pax6, KFL4, AP2alpha, HMGN1 and this work (Bnc1) (See text for the description).</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="pone.0001087.g007"/></fig><p>Although the molecular nature of such mechanisms remains to be elucidated, the aforementioned studies suggest a central role of E-cadherin in maintaining the homeostasis of corneal epithelium. The histological and cell biological manifestations of the aforementioned null-mutations are different, some affecting cell adhesion, and others cell differentiation or cell proliferation, suggesting they impair distinctive aspects of corneal epithelium homeostasis. Remarkably, they all perturb the expression of E-cadherin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001087-Davis1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001087-Birger1">&#x0005b;38&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001087-Dwivedi1">&#x0005b;39&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001087-Swamynathan1">&#x0005b;45&#x0005d;</xref>(this work), suggesting this protein is at the pivotal point of regulation of corneal epithelial homeostasis. E-cadherin is indeed capable of influencing both cell adhesion and nuclear events and other pathways through its interaction with beta-catenin and EphA2 receptor tyrosine kinase <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001087-Orsulic1">&#x0005b;46&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001087-Behrens1">&#x0005b;49&#x0005d;</xref>. E-cadherin/beta-catenin complex is also regulated by tyrosine phosphorylation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001087-Behrens1">&#x0005b;49&#x0005d;</xref> and is a target of Wnt signaling pathway <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001087-Yook1">&#x0005b;50&#x0005d;</xref>. The convergence of a wide range of interactions on E-cadherin is consistent with a role of a sensor and information integrator in intercellular and intracellular events (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001087-g007"><bold>Fig. 7</bold></xref>). A perplexing observation is that in most cases, a down-regulation of E-cadherin function leads to an increase in proliferation, but we found that basonuclin-null mutation resulted in a down-regulation of E-cadherin and a decrease in proliferation.</p><p>Although there is a strong correlation of E-cadherin function perturbation and the thinning of corneal epithelium, the underlying molecular alterations of these null-mutations (i.e., Pax6, KLF4, AP-2alpha, HMGN1 and Bnc1), which lead to changes in E-cadherin function, are likely different. In a sense, basonuclin is unique because none of the other aforementioned null-mutations has been shown to regulate rDNA transcription. In our examination of the v-rDNA expression profile in corneal epithelium, we made two novel findings. First, we established the v-rDNA expression profile in corneal keratinocytes. We found that v-rDNA VII, whose transcript was absent in most of the tissues (Tseng et al., submitted), was expressed in cornea keratinocytes. Second, we identified the v-rDNA perturbed by basonuclin-null mutation (v-rDNA I, II and VI). These findings support the notion that cell-type-specific regulation of rDNA relates to the differential usage of a subset of rDNA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001087-Zhang1">&#x0005b;25&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001087-Tseng7">&#x0005b;51&#x0005d;</xref>. However, currently it is not understood why v-rDNAs are expressed differentially in various tissues, or whether these v-rDNAs encode different ribosomal RNA (rRNA). The lack of knowledge in this area precludes an understanding of why basonuclin can regulate both Pol I and Pol II transcription and why it regulates a subset of rDNA. Nevertheless, our data strongly suggest that basonuclin-null mutation impairs the expression of E-cadherin. Our results show that the amount of E-cadherin protein was reduced in basonuclin-null corneal epithelium but its mRNA level was increased. It can be argued that the decrease in the amount of E-cadherin protein is not due to an impairment of transcription and basonuclin-null keratinocytes are capable of increasing production of E-cadherin mRNA, probably in an attempt to compensate for the reduced protein level. The defect thus appears to be post-transcriptional and likely translational, because of basonuclin's role in rRNA synthesis and ribosomal biogenesis. The implication of this interpretation is that basonuclin-null mutation affects E-cadherin translation selectively, because we did not detect contradictory changes in mRNA and protein levels in other genes (e.g., Gli2, HMG2 and Cx43). Therefore, the mechanism, by which basonuclin-null mutation perturbs E-cadherin expression, warrants future investigation.</p><p>In summary, we describe the construction of the first basonuclin-null mouse model and the characterization of its corneal epithelium. Basonuclin-null mutation impairs regulation of corneal keratinocyte proliferation, which leads to perturbation in epithelium thickness and delay in wound re-epithelialization. Our data is consistent with the notion that basonuclin regulates pathways requiring both Pol I and II transcription. Importantly, our result confirms that basonuclin regulates a subset of rDNA, and suggests the identity of basonuclin's target v-rDNA. Based on reports by others and this study, we propose a regulatory feedback loop in maintaining corneal epithelium thickness, and that basonuclin and E-cadherin are important regulators in corneal epithelium homeostasis (thickness).</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Generation of basonuclin-null mutant mice</title><p>The exon' 4 of the basonuclin gene, which encodes the critical zinc fingers and the nuclear localization signal, was targeted for excision by the Cre recombinase.
