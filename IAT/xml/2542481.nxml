Although WAVE2 mediates integrin affinity maturation by recruiting vinculin and talin to the immunological synapse in an Arp2/3-dependent manner, the mechanism by which it regulates integrin clustering is unclear. We show that the Abl tyrosine kinase associates with the WAVE2 complex and TCR ligation induces WAVE2-dependent membrane recruitment of Abl. Furthermore, we show that WAVE2 regulates TCR-mediated activation of the integrin regulatory guanosine triphosphatase Rap1 via the recruitment and activation of the CrkL&#x02013;C3G exchange complex. Moreover, we demonstrate that although Abl does not regulate the recruitment of CrkL&#x02013;C3G into the membrane, it does affect the tyrosine phosphorylation of C3G, which is required for its guanine nucleotide exchange factor activity toward Rap1. This signaling node regulates not only TCR-stimulated integrin clustering but also affinity maturation. These findings identify a previously unknown mechanism by which the WAVE2 complex regulates TCR signaling to Rap1 and integrin activation.</p></abstract></article-meta><notes><fn-group><fn><p>Abbreviations used in this paper: APC, antigen-presenting cell; GBD, GTPase binding domain; GEF, guanine nucleotide exchange factor; IL-2, interleukin-2; IS, immunological synapse; SMAC, supramolecular activation complex; TCR, T cell receptor.</p></fn></fn-group></notes></front><body><sec><title>Introduction</title><p>Stimulation of the T cell receptor (TCR) by peptide&#x02013;major histocompatibility complex on an antigen-presenting cell (APC) triggers the activation of biochemical signaling pathways that not only lead to changes in gene transcription but also cytoskeletal reorganization resulting in the formation of the immunological synapse (IS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Billadeau et al., 2007</xref>). Through a process known as &#x0201c;inside-out&#x0201d; signaling, the activation of intracellular signaling proteins in response to TCR ligation ultimately results in the regulation of cell surface integrins (clustering and affinity maturation) required for the stable interaction between the T cell and APC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kinashi, 2005</xref>). The resulting characteristic structure of the IS contains signaling proteins in the center of the supramolecular activation complex (SMAC), whereas integrins and integrin scaffolding proteins such as talin are found in the peripheral SMAC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Anton van der Merwe et al., 2000</xref>).</p><p>Integrins are heterodimeric cell surface receptors that are responsible for cell adhesion during several biological processes or, in the case of T cells, conjugation to an APC or target cell. Among the different integrins expressed by T cells, LFA-1 (&#x003b1;<sub>L</sub>&#x003b2;<sub>2</sub>) has been shown to be critical for conjugate formation and binds to its ligand ICAM-1 found on APCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dustin and Springer, 1989</xref>). In addition, VLA-4 (&#x003b1;<sub>4</sub>&#x003b2;<sub>1</sub>) also functions in T cell activation by binding to VCAM-1 and the extracellular matrix protein fibronectin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Mobley et al., 1994</xref>), functioning as a costimulatory molecule (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Shimizu et al., 1990</xref>), and also localizes to the peripheral SMAC of the IS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Mittelbrunn et al., 2004</xref>) where it might interact with CD14 on the APC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Humphries and Humphries, 2007</xref>). The regulation of integrins can occur as a result of clustering of individual subunits on the cell surface, thereby increasing avidity, or by changes in the conformation of the integrin itself, thereby increasing affinity. Although TCR engagement leads to changes in both integrin affinity and avidity, the molecular mechanisms that control these individual processes remain largely unknown.</p><p>Recent studies have suggested that Rap1, a member of the Ras family of small GTPases, is a critical regulator of integrin activation in response to stimulation of both the TCR and chemokine receptors. In fact, both expression of a constitutively active form of Rap1 using a transgenic mouse model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Sebzda et al., 2002</xref>) and the creation of a Rap1A knockout mouse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Duchniewicz et al., 2006</xref>) have demonstrated the importance of this protein in regulating immune cell adhesion. Several effectors of Rap1 (RAPL, PKD, and RIAM) have been described and each appears to be required for appropriate integrin clustering to occur in response to receptor stimulation, whereas integrin affinity, when examined, was largely unaffected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Katagiri et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Medeiros et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Menasche et al., 2007</xref>). Despite the fact that Rap1 is a key regulator of integrin activation, neither the signaling pathways used by the TCR to activate Rap1 nor the specific guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) that activate Rap1 have been completely elucidated.</p><p>The Abl family of tyrosine kinases has been implicated in regulating cell shape and motility through the regulation of F-actin dynamics in several cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hernandez et al., 2004</xref>). In fact, PDGF stimulation of fibroblasts results in increased Abl kinase activity, as well as Abl-dependent F-actin&#x02013;mediated membrane ruffling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Plattner et al., 1999</xref>). Abl kinases can potentially regulate F-actin cytoskeletal changes through an association with the Abi (Abl-interactor) proteins, which interact directly with Arp2/3 (actin-related protein 2/3) regulatory WAVE proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Innocenti et al., 2004</xref>). More recently, it has been shown that T cells deficient for both Abl kinases (Abl and Arg) show profound defects in development, proliferation, and cytokine production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gu et al., 2007</xref>). Although this study and others have demonstrated the importance of these proteins in regulating cellular function, the mechanisms by which Abl controls actin-dependent processes in both immune and nonimmune cells remain obscure.</p><p>It has been previously shown that TCR-stimulated changes in integrin avidity and affinity are dependent on the cytoskeletal regulatory protein WAVE2 and the Arp2/3 complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Nolz et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gomez et al., 2007</xref>). It was subsequently found that the integrin scaffolding protein vinculin is also involved in TCR-mediated integrin activation and regulates integrin affinity maturation through an association with WAVE2&#x02013;Arp2/3 complex and recruitment of talin to the &#x003b2;-chain of the integrin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Nolz et al., 2007</xref>). In contrast to WAVE2-depleted T cells, which fail to accumulate F-actin or integrins at the IS, vinculin-depleted T cells accumulate F-actin and integrins, thus suggesting that WAVE2 regulates both aspects of integrin regulation, whereas other proteins, such as Rap1 effectors and vinculin, are responsible for regulating either affinity or avidity in response to TCR engagement.</p><p>Because of the involvement of WAVE2 and Rap1 in regulating integrin avidity, we sought to determine whether WAVE2 contributed to TCR-mediated activation of Rap1. Our data demonstrate that the WAVE2 complex is required for TCR-mediated Rap1 activation. We show that the tyrosine kinase Abl is associated with the WAVE2 complex in T cells and that WAVE2 is involved in the TCR-stimulated plasma membrane recruitment of the tyrosine kinase Abl and the CrkL&#x02013;C3G complex, leading to the activation of Rap1. Overall, these data demonstrate that the WAVE2 complex participates in the localization of key regulators of Rap1, leading to integrin clustering and affinity maturation during T cell activation.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>WAVE2 is involved in TCR- and PMA-mediated adhesion to fibronectin and ICAM-1 in normal human T cells</title><p>We have previously shown that WAVE2 is involved in TCR-stimulated changes in both integrin affinity and avidity in Jurkat T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Nolz et al., 2007</xref>). To determine if WAVE2 participated in adhesion in nontransformed primary human T cells, siRNA duplexes against WAVE2 were transfected into purified human CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells, and the amount of suppression was determined by immunoblot. In agreement with previously published data, suppression of WAVE2 results in decreased protein levels of other WAVE complex members, including Abi-1 and 2, HEM-1, and PIR121 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 A</xref>). Because protein levels of the WAVE2 complex could be adequately decreased using this method, we next analyzed these cells for VLA-4&#x02013;mediated adhesion to fibronectin in response to TCR stimulation. Stimulated T cells transfected with control siRNA showed limited basal binding to fibronectin but adhered readily to fibronectin in response to TCR stimulation, although not to wells containing only BSA (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1, B and C</xref>). However, cells in which WAVE2 had been suppressed were much less efficient at adhering to fibronectin at all concentrations tested (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1, B and C</xref>, left).</p><fig position="float" id="fig1"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p><bold>WAVE2 is required for TCR-mediated adhesion to both fibronectin and ICAM-1 in primary human CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells.</bold> (A) Purified human CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells were transfected with either control siRNA (siControl) or siRNA against WAVE2 (siWAVE2).

Therefore, we next tested whether normal human T cells required WAVE2 for adhesion to ICAM-1 in response to TCR ligation. Similar to the results obtained with adhesion to fibronectin, WAVE2-suppressed T cells also demonstrated an overall reduction in adhesion to ICAM-1 in response to TCR stimulation (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1, B and C</xref>, right). Collectively, these data confirm the results obtained in Jurkat T cells, where WAVE2 is involved in TCR-mediated integrin activation leading to adhesion through both &#x003b2;<sub>1</sub> and &#x003b2;<sub>2</sub> integrins.</p></sec><sec><title>WAVE2 regulates TCR-mediated activation of Rap1</title><p>Rap1 is a small GTPase of the Ras family, and numerous studies have demonstrated the importance of this protein in regulating TCR-mediated integrin clustering and affinity maturation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bos, 2005</xref>). We have previously shown that WAVE2 regulates the clustering of integrins and the recruitment of talin and vinculin to the IS leading to high-affinity integrin binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Nolz et al., 2007</xref>). Thus, the WAVE2 complex may be involved in Rap1 activation leading to integrin clustering at the IS. We used shRNA against WAVE2 in the Jurkat T cell line and assessed Rap1 activation using a GST-tagged RalGDS GTPase binding domain (GBD). TCR-stimulated Jurkat T cells activated Rap1 rapidly, peaked at &#x0223c;1 min after stimulation, and returned to background levels by 5 min (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 A</xref>). In contrast, WAVE2-suppressed cells were less effective at activating Rap1 in response to TCR stimulation when compared with the control cells (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 A</xref>). Similarly, suppression of WAVE2 using siRNA in both human CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> and CD8<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells resulted in attenuated Rap1 activation downstream of the TCR (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2, B and C</xref>). The residual TCR-stimulated Rap1 activation seen in WAVE2-depleted cells may be caused by other TCR-regulated signaling pathways coupling to Rap1 activation or to incomplete suppression of WAVE2.</p><fig position="float" id="fig2"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><p><bold>WAVE2 is required for TCR-mediated Rap1 activation.</bold> (A) Jurkat T cells were transfected with either control vector or WAVE2 suppression vector and allowed to recover for 72 h.

Cytochalasin D and latrunculin B are two actin-destabilizing toxins that prevent actin polymerization through different mechanisms. Treatment of purified human CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells with either of these actin-destabilizing drugs resulted in impaired Rap1 activation in response to TCR stimulation (Fig. S1 A, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200801121/DC1">http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200801121/DC1</ext-link>). We had previously shown that WAVE2-dependent actin dynamics were required to recruit vinculin to the IS. We therefore examined whether vinculin suppression would affect TCR-stimulated Rap1 activation. In contrast to suppression of WAVE2 or pharmacological inhibition of actin dynamics, suppression of vinculin did not affect Rap1 activation after TCR ligation (Fig. S1 B). Thus, although actin dynamics (either WAVE2-dependent or -independent) are required for TCR-mediated Rap1 activation to occur, it is not mediated through vinculin.</p><p>Several downstream effectors of GTP-Rap1 have been identified that are required for the activation of inside-out signaling pathways leading to integrin activation. The nonconventional PKC isoform PKD (aka, PKC&#x003bc;) binds to activated Rap1 through a noncanonical interaction within the pleckstrin homology domain of the protein, and both activated Rap1 and PKD localize to the cell membrane after receptor stimulation (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2, D and E</xref>). The interaction between PKD and activated Rap1 is also required for integrin clustering to occur in response to both TCR and PMA stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Medeiros et al., 2005</xref>). We therefore determined whether WAVE2 suppression affected the recruitment of Rap1 or PKD to the cell membrane after cellular activation. Indeed, localization of Rap1 and PKD into the cell membrane is diminished after stimulation with either anti-CD3 or PMA in WAVE2-suppressed T cells (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2, D and E</xref>). In addition to PKD, GTP-Rap1 also associates with RapL, which will, in turn, form a complex with the kinase Mst1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Katagiri et al., 2006</xref>), leading to its phosphorylation and activation, an event which is required for integrin clustering. Using an antibody that detects phosphorylation of Mst1 on threonine 183 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Katagiri et al., 2006</xref>), phosphorylated Mst1 could be detected in purified human CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells after CD3 stimulation. However, WAVE2-suppressed CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells fail to efficiently activate Mst1 in response to TCR stimulation (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 F</xref>). Collectively, these data demonstrate that the WAVE2 complex is an essential component of signaling pathways initiated by the TCR, resulting in the plasma membrane localization and activation of Rap1 and its downstream effectors.</p></sec><sec><title>TCR-mediated activation of Rap1 is dependent on the adaptor CrkL and the GEF C3G</title><p>The GEF C3G can associate with the adaptor protein CrkL, and this CrkL&#x02013;C3G complex has been implicated in regulating Rap1 activation in both BCR-ABL&#x02013;transformed chronic myelogenous leukemia cells and other cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Sattler and Salgia, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Arai et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Ichiba et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Sakakibara et al., 2002</xref>). Additionally, it has been proposed that this complex of proteins is involved in T cell adhesion because T cells lacking either c-Cbl or Cbl-b, two negative regulators of CrkL&#x02013;C3G signaling, have increased adhesion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Shao et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Zhang et al., 2003</xref>). However, it is unclear whether this complex regulates TCR-stimulated Rap1 activation. To determine whether C3G was required for Rap1 activation to occur in response to TCR stimulation, two different shRNAs against C3G were used in Jurkat T cells. Suppression of C3G dramatically impaired Rap1 activation (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 A</xref>) and adhesion to fibronectin (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 B</xref>) in response to TCR stimulation. Furthermore, suppression of CrkL using siRNA in human CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells led to a defect in Rap1 activation (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 C</xref>). Finally, suppression of CrkL in purified human CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells impairs TCR-dependent adhesion to both fibronectin (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 D</xref>) and ICAM-1 (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 E</xref>).

CrkL is phosphorylated on Y207 by the Abl tyrosine kinase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">de Jong et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Zipfel et al., 2004</xref>). We therefore assessed whether WAVE2 suppression affected the phosphorylation of CrkL on Y207. Indeed, in response to TCR stimulation, CrkL is phosphorylated on Y207, and this phosphorylation was diminished in WAVE2-suppressed T cells (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5 B</xref>), suggesting the possibility that CrkL was not getting effectively recruited in WAVE2-suppressed cells. Interestingly, the effect of WAVE2 on CrkL phosphorylation appears to be independent of its ability to bind the Arp2/3 complex because reexpression of a &#x00394;VCA version of WAVE2, as well as the wild-type version, are both sufficient to restore CrkL phosphorylation in WAVE2-suppressed T cells (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5 C</xref>). Moreover, suppression of Arp2/3 in Jurkat T cells does not affect Y207 phosphorylation of CrkL in response to TCR stimulation (JCN and DDB; unpublished data). In agreement with this finding, treatment of T cells with the actin depolymerizing agents cytochalasin D or latrunculin B, which abrogates Rap1 activation after TCR ligation, has no affect on TCR-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of CrkL (Fig. S1 C). These data suggest that although WAVE2 is required for CrkL phosphorylation in response to TCR engagement, it does so in an F-actin&#x02013;independent manner.</p><p>It has been proposed that phosphorylation of CrkL on Y207 inhibits its localization through an autoinhibitory mechanism, where the SH2 domain of the protein binds with high affinity to a phosphorylated tyrosine between the amino- and carboxy-terminal SH3 domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Feller et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Rosen et al., 1995</xref>), thereby preventing the association with other binding partners and decreasing CrkL-mediated signaling. In fact, expression of an Y207F CrkL point mutant resulted in enhanced basal adhesion to fibronectin as compared with control and wild-type CrkL-expressing Jurkat T cells (Fig. S2, B and C). We therefore next determined which domains of CrkL were required for its phosphorylation and regulation of Rap1 after TCR ligation. Although wild-type CrkL underwent tyrosine phosphorylation, mutation of the critical residue within the SH2 domain (R39A) prevented TCR-stimulated phosphorylation of CrkL, whereas mutation of either SH3 domain had no effect (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5 D</xref>). In addition, we found that the CrkL SH2 domain and N-terminal SH3 domain (which binds to C3G) are involved in regulating Rap1 activation downstream of the TCR (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5 E</xref>). Collectively, these results suggest that the WAVE2 complex is involved in the recruitment of CrkL (via its SH2 domain) for optimal TCR-stimulated Rap1 activation (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6 C</xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="fig6"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><p><bold>The Abl tyrosine kinase interacts with and is localized to the membrane by the WAVE2 complex.</bold> (A) Purified human T cells were stimulated with anti-CD3.

To determine if C3G phosphorylation was affected by WAVE2 suppression, C3G protein was purified from cellular lysate using a GST N-terminal SH3 domain of CrkL (CrkL SH3-N; Fig. S2 D). Using this method, tyrosine phosphorylated C3G could be detected in TCR-stimulated cells, but this phosphorylation was diminished in WAVE2-suppressed Jurkat T cells (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5 F</xref>). In addition, C3G, although required for Rap1 activation, is not required for phosphorylation of CrkL on Y207 (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5 G</xref>). These data are consistent with the observation that although the N-terminal SH3 domain of CrkL is not required for TCR-stimulated phosphorylation of CrkL, it is required for Rap1 activation.</p></sec><sec><title>The WAVE2 complex regulates Abl tyrosine kinase membrane recruitment</title><p>Abl tyrosine kinases have been implicated in regulating both cytoskeletal dynamics and cellular adhesion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Woodring et al., 2003</xref>). In addition, WAVE2 is constitutively linked to the adaptor protein Abi-1 or Abi-2, which were identified as Abl kinase-interacting proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Dai and Pendergast, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Shi et al., 1995</xref>). We therefore asked whether Abl is associated with the WAVE2 complex in T cells. Indeed, using two different antibodies against WAVE2, we found that Abl can be coimmunoprecipitated with the WAVE2 complex from human CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells (Fig. S3 A, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200801121/DC1">http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200801121/DC1</ext-link>). In addition, the SH3 domains of both Abi-1 and Abi-2 interact with Abl independently of the rest of the WAVE2 complex, whereas the SH3 domain of IRSp53, which binds the proline-rich region of WAVE2 directly, precipitates the entire WAVE2 complex, including Abl (Fig. S3 A). Additionally, Abl coimmunoprecipitates with WAVE2 from stimulated human CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells throughout TCR stimulation (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6 A</xref>). Using an in vitro kinase assay, cytoplasmic Abl kinase activity does not appear to change in response to TCR stimulation (Fig. S4, A and B), but there is an increase in Abl kinase activity from the membrane fraction of TCR-stimulated cells (Fig. S4, C and D). Collectively, these data suggest that Abl is associated with the WAVE2 complex and that TCR stimulation results in Abl membrane recruitment where it can then phosphorylate its target substrates.</p><p>The defect of CrkL phosphorylation on Y207 in WAVE2-suppressed T cells suggested to us that Abl might not be properly recruited to its substrates without the WAVE2 complex. To test this, we first examined Abl cellular localization in T cell&#x02013;Nalm 6 B cell conjugates formed with control and WAVE2-suppressed cells. Although Abl is efficiently recruited to the IS in control transfected T cells stimulated with SEE, Abl recruitment is diminished in T cells suppressed for WAVE2 (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6 B</xref>). To validate these results biochemically, membrane and cytosolic fractions from both control and WAVE2-suppressed Jurkat T cells were analyzed after TCR stimulation. Indeed, stimulation with anti-CD3 resulted in an increase in the amount of both WAVE2 and Abl in the membrane fraction of control cells but not in WAVE2-suppressed cells (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6 C</xref>). In fact, there appears to be more Abl in the cytoplasm of TCR-stimulated WAVE2-suppressed cells (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6 C</xref>). Interestingly, reprobing of these membranes indicates that WAVE2 suppression not only affects Abl membrane recruitment but also affects the recruitment of CrkL and C3G into the membrane fraction. Collectively, these data indicate that the WAVE2 complex is involved in the localization of Abl and the CrkL&#x02013;C3G complex into the plasma membrane after TCR ligation.</p></sec><sec><title>Abl tyrosine kinase regulates TCR-stimulated Rap1 activation</title><p>The finding that Abl localization is defective in WAVE2-suppressed cells indicated that Abl kinase activity might be involved in regulating signaling pathways leading to the activation of Rap1. To test this hypothesis, we initially treated human CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells with increasing concentrations of the Abl tyrosine kinase inhibitor Imatinib (Gleevec, STI-571) and assessed TCR-stimulated Rap1 activation and adhesion. Indeed, concentrations of Imatinib that sufficiently blocked phosphorylation of CrkL (5 and 10 &#x003bc;M) also resulted in impaired TCR-stimulated Rap1 activation and adhesion (Fig. S5, A&#x02013;C). Because of the possibility that Imatinib could have off-target effects and/or inhibit the Abl-related kinase Arg, we decided to specifically target Abl using RNAi to directly examine the role of Abl in TCR-stimulated Rap1 activation and adhesion. Consistent with the Imatinib experiment, siRNA-mediated depletion of Abl from primary CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells resulted in diminished TCR-stimulated Rap1 activation (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7 A</xref>) and Mst1 phosphorylation (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7 B</xref>) but had no effect on upstream signaling components such as phosphorylation of PLC&#x003b3;1 (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7 C</xref>) or stability of the WAVE2 complex (Fig. S3 B). However, similar to the phenotype of CrkL-, C3G-, and WAVE2-suppressed T cells, suppression of Abl in either Jurkat T cells (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7 D</xref>) or primary CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7 E</xref>) resulted in impaired TCR-mediated adhesion to fibronectin and in the ability to bind soluble VCAM-1-Fc in response to both TCR and PMA stimulation (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7 F</xref>).

It has been previously demonstrated that Src can phosphorylate Y504 within C3G to regulate its GEF activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Ichiba et al., 1999</xref>). We therefore examined whether Abl might be involved in the phosphorylation of C3G. Using an in vitro kinase assay, we found that although purified Abl kinase can readily phosphorylate a GST fusion protein containing CrkL Y207, it had limited ability to phosphorylate a GST fusion protein containing the fragment of C3G containing Y504 (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8 C</xref>).

However, when examining the phosphorylation of C3G in cells, we found that suppression of Abl resulted in diminished TCR-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of C3G (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8 D</xref>).

However, the signaling pathways initiated by the TCR that result in Rap1 activation remain relatively obscure. Our data demonstrate that the WAVE2 complex is an essential component of the TCR-stimulated signaling pathway, leading to activation of both Rap1 and its downstream effectors. Furthermore, our data suggest that WAVE2 regulates Rap1 activation through an Abl kinase-dependent mechanism that results in recruitment and activation of the CrkL&#x02013;C3G exchange complex.</p><p>The data presented here are intriguing when combined with our earlier work showing that vinculin and talin are recruited to the IS via the VCA domain of WAVE2 and the Arp2/3 complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Nolz et al., 2007</xref>). In terms of kinetics, our data suggests that Rap1 activation occurs during the early stages of cytoskeletal rearrangement when initial lamellipodial protrusion occurs. Because many effectors of Rap1 regulate both integrin avidity (e.g., Mst1) and affinity (e.g., RapL; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Katagiri et al., 2003</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">2006</xref>), WAVE2-dependent activation of Rap1 may help integrins localize to areas in the cell where de novo actin polymerization is occurring. Finally, as the IS begins to mature, the integrin scaffolding proteins vinculin and talin are then recruited to the WAVE2&#x02013;Arp2/3 complex to generate the high-affinity state of the recently recruited integrins by binding both the &#x003b2; chain of the integrin and the actin cytoskeleton.</p><p>Surprisingly, suppression of WAVE2, Abl, CrkL, or C3G results in impaired TCR-mediated increases in both integrin affinity and avidity. To date, the described effectors of Rap1 appear to play a more important role in integrin localization rather than changing the conformation of the integrin required for increasing affinity. However, it has been suggested that Rap1 may act through RIAM to assist in talin binding to the integrin &#x003b2; chain, leading to its high-affinity state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Han et al., 2006</xref>). In addition, suppression of Rap1 in T cells results in impaired integrin affinity in response to chemokine stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Parmo-Cabanas et al., 2007</xref>). Collectively, these data argue that Rap1 is important for both aspects of integrin regulation, even though certain Rap1 effectors probably regulate distinct steps of the process.</p><p>Although our data indicate that the activation of the CrkL&#x02013;C3G complex requires WAVE2, the involvement of other adaptors is still probable. In fact, many proteins that associate with the SH2 domain of CrkL are phosphorylated in response to TCR stimulation, including Cbl (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Donovan et al., 1994</xref>) and CasL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kanda et al., 1997</xref>). In addition, chronic myelogenous leukemia cells, which express the BCR-ABL fusion protein, exhibit increases in CrkL, C3G, and CasL phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Salgia et al., 1996</xref>). This is accompanied by both increased phosphorylation of several focal adhesion proteins and altered cellular adhesion. Therefore, it is likely that TCR stimulation causes Abl to activate the CrkL&#x02013;C3G exchange complex, possibly though CasL, leading to Rap1 activation and adhesion.</p><p>WAVE2 has also been suggested to link to the BCR-ABL fusion protein through the adaptor Abi-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Li et al., 2007</xref>). That study indicates that recruitment of Abi and WAVE2 required direct interaction with BCR-ABL. This interaction resulted in F-actin accumulation, recruitment of several focal adhesion proteins including vinculin and talin, and overall increased adhesion to fibronectin mediated by &#x003b2;<sub>1</sub> integrins. In fact, it has been shown that Abl phosphorylation of WAVE2 regulates its ability to polymerize actin via Arp2/3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Leng et al., 2005</xref>). Consistent with this observation, it was recently shown that Abl is involved in the recruitment of WAVE2 and polymerization of F-actin at the IS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Huang et al., 2008</xref>). Our biochemical and microscopy data run contrary to this observation, instead suggesting that WAVE2 recruits Abl into the membrane in response to TCR ligation. Additionally, we find F-actin accumulation at the cell&#x02013;bead contact site in Abl-suppressed cells. These inconsistencies could be caused by the differences in the experimental approach. Indeed, when examining T cell&#x02013;B cell interactions, diminished adhesion in Abl-depleted cells might affect F-actin accumulation and, subsequently, WAVE2 localization.</p><p>Despite observing a significant affect on CrkL phosphorylation in Abl-suppressed cells and T cells treated with Imatinib, we fail to identify a defect in TCR-mediated tyrosine phosphorylation of PLC&#x003b3;1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Zipfel et al., 2004</xref>). This suggests that in this system, Abl does not function to coordinate proximal TCR signaling events, such as ZAP-70 phosphorylation and formation of the LAT signalosome, but, rather, Abl appears to work in concert with the WAVE2 complex to coordinate cytoskeletal dynamics and integrin activation. Yet, we cannot rule out the possibility that expression of the Abl-related protein Arg could be linking TCR-proximal signaling to PLC-&#x003b3;1, while not being able to couple TCR signaling to CrkL phosphorylation, Rap1 activation, or integrin activation. Additionally, the level of suppression we attain with RNAi might be insufficient to affect TCR proximal signaling but does affect pathways leading to integrin activation. However, we do find that suppression of Abl or treatment with Imatinib does have an impact on IL-2 gene transcription. Future studies aimed at identifying mechanisms of WAVE2-independent Abl activity during T cell activation will help define the diverse functions of this tyrosine kinase.</p><p>In conclusion, the data presented here characterizes a previously unidentified function of the WAVE2 complex during T cell activation. Importantly, WAVE2 not only regulates integrin activation through Arp2/3-mediated actin polymerization and recruitment of integrins, talin, and vinculin but also mediates activation of Rap1 leading to integrin clustering and affinity maturation. In addition, this study suggests that the WAVE2 complex regulates Abl and CrkL&#x02013;C3G recruitment into the plasma membrane, leading to Rap1 activation and integrin-mediated adhesion. It will be of interest to determine whether the ubiquitously expressed WAVE2 or its closely related homologues WAVE1 and WAVE3 use a similar pathway to regulate integrin activation in other cell types after receptor stimulation.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Reagents and antibodies</title><p>Unless otherwise stated, all chemicals were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich.

Fixed cells were quenched with 50 mM NH<sub>4</sub>Cl and permeabilized in 0.2% Triton X-100. Blocking and antibody incubations were performed in blocking buffer (PBS, 0.05% saponin, and 0.25% fish skin gelatin). Slides were labeled with purified anti-CrkL, anti-&#x003b2;<sub>1</sub> integrin antibody (clone P5D2; Millipore), or anti-Abl (clone 8E9; BD Biosciences), followed by goat anti&#x02013;mouse TRITC, goat anti&#x02013;rabbit FITC (Invitrogen), or goat anti&#x02013;rabbit Cy5 (Invitrogen). In some cases, conjugates were stained for polymerized F-actin using rhodamine-conjugated phalloidin (Invitrogen). Coverslips were mounted in Mowiol 4&#x02013;88 (HOECHST; Celanese) containing 10% 1,4-diazobicyclo [2.2.2] octane. Fixed conjugates were examined at room temperature on a microscope (Axiovert 200; Carl Zeiss, Inc.) with a digital camera (AxioCam HRC; Carl Zeiss, Inc.) using a 40&#x000d7;/0.75 NA objective or a scanning confocal microscope (LSM 510; Carl Zeiss, Inc.) using a 63&#x000d7;/1.2 NA water-immersion objective. Images were captured with either the AxioVision or LSM software packages (Carl Zeiss, Inc.). Figure construction of images was performed in Photoshop and Canvas (ACD Systems). 100 conjugates were scored per condition, and cells were scored as positive if the T cell had bound a single bead or Nalm 6 B cell and demonstrated accumulation of integrin, F-actin, or protein at the contact area as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Nolz et al., 2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">2007</xref>).

Fibronectin or ICAM-1Fc (R&#x00026;D Systems) was diluted in sterile PBS, and wells were coated overnight at 4&#x000b0;C. Wells were then washed once with PBS, blocked with 2.5% BSA in PBS for 2 h at 37&#x000b0;C, and washed once more in PBS. Either Jurkat T cells or purified human CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells were stained with 5 &#x003bc;M calcein AM (Invitrogen) for 30 min in serum-free media and washed twice with PBS. For anti-CD3 stimulation in purified human CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells, cells were stained on ice with 5 &#x003bc;g/ml OKT3 for 15 min before addition to the coated wells. Cells were added to wells (10<sup>5</sup> for Jurkat and 2.5 &#x000d7; 10<sup>5</sup> for purified CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>) containing media alone (unstimulated), 5 &#x003bc;g/ml OKT3 (anti-CD3 for Jurkat), 1:50 dilution of goat anti&#x02013;mouse (anti-CD3 for purified human T cells prestained with OKT3), or PMA (10 ng/ml for Jurkat and 50 ng/ml for purified human T cells) in 100 &#x003bc;l of media total. The 96-well plate containing cells was then placed on ice for 30 min, followed by a 15-min incubation at 37&#x000b0;C. After incubation, the cellular input was measured using a fluorescent plate reader (MDS Analytical Technologies) using an excitation of 495 nm and emission of 517 nm. Plates were then subsequently washed with PBS and adhesion was continually monitored using the aforementioned excitations and emissions. Typically, data for adhesion to ICAM-1Fc was optimal at two to three washes with PBS and adhesion to fibronectin was optimal at five to six washes with PBS. All adhesion experiments were performed in triplicate and the SD is shown.</p></sec><sec><title>Soluble VCAM-1-Fc binding</title><p>Procedure was performed as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chan et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Woodside et al., 2006</xref>).

After stimulation, supernatants were collected, and IL-2 secretion was determined with a sandwich ELISA kit (assay sensitivity 4 pg/ml; eBioscience) according to the manufacturer's protocol. In brief, a 96-well plate was coated with polyclonal anti&#x02013;human IL-2 Antibody. After blocking, supernatants were diluted 1:4 and added to the wells overnight at 4&#x000b0;C. IL-2 was detected by incubation wells with biotinylated anti-human IL-2 antibody followed by HRP-Avidin. Color was developed using trimethylbenzidine substrate, and reaction was terminated with H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>. OD was measured at 450 nm and corrected at 570 nm on a plate reader (SpectraMax M2; MDS Analytical Technologies). IL-2 concentration was determined extrapolating OD values from the samples to a standard curve made using recombinant human IL-2 provided by the manufacturer.</p></sec><sec><title>Online supplemental material</title><p>Fig. S1 shows that inhibition of F-actin polymerization affects Rap1 activation but not CrkL phosphorylation.
