The CD originates within the mine, whereas the PAHs are components of occupational and avocational exposures such as diesel engine exhaust and cigarette smoke. The CD exposure can cause coal workers&#x02019; pneumoconiosis, a disease of coal miners characterized by the aggregation of dust-laden macrophages near the respiratory bronchioles to form structures known as macules. Inflammation is a consistent feature of the pulmonary response to respirable CD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8-ehp0114-001367">Ghanem et al. 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19-ehp0114-001367">Rom et al. 1987</xref>). Although chronic inflammation is increasingly believed to play a role in carcinogenesis in many tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17-ehp0114-001367">Marx 2004</xref>), the role of particle-induced inflammation in pulmonary carcinogenesis, the influence of particle-induced inflammation on the metabolism of PAHs and other known carcinogens, and the histopathologic alterations produced by combined exposure to CD and PAHs remain incompletely investigated.</p><p>PAHs are metabolized to reactive intermediates by cytochrome P450 1 (CYP1) gene products. Recently, our laboratory has demonstrated that respirable CD inhibits PAH-induced CYP1A1 activity in the lung of rats. The down-regulation of CYP1A1 induction was associated with inflammation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8-ehp0114-001367">Ghanem et al. 2004</xref>). This information suggests that CD may modify the metabolism of PAHs in the lung. However, molecular changes that are associated with CD exposure and resulting pulmonary inflammation and down-regulation of CYP1A1 induction have not yet been identified. In an experimental model of another pneumoconiosis, silicosis, caspase inhibition with resulting apoptosis down-regulation reduces silica-induced inflammation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2-ehp0114-001367">Borges et al. 2002</xref>). Caspases play an important role in both the intrinsic and extrinsic apoptotic pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6-ehp0114-001367">Droin and Green 2004</xref>), making their inhibition an elegant tool for investigating the overall role of caspase-dependent apoptosis in the pneumoconioses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2-ehp0114-001367">Borges et al. 2002</xref>). Because apoptosis is believed to play an essential role in the inflammation associated with one pneumoconiosis, acute silicosis, and because inflammation increased as CYP1A1 activity decreased in the rat model of coal workers&#x02019; pneumoconiosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8-ehp0114-001367">Ghanem et al. 2004</xref>), we investigated the hypothesis that apoptosis plays a critical role in lung injury and down-regulation of CYP1A1 induction in mixed exposures to CD and the model PAH &#x003b2;-naphthoflavone (BNF).</p><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec><title>Animals</title><p>Male Sprague-Dawley rats [Hla(SD)CVF] were purchased from Hilltop Labs (Scottdale, PA) and kept in a barrier animal facility approved by the Association for Assessment and Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care International.

Rats were housed in ventilated shoebox cages on autoclaved hardwood (Beta-Chip; Northeastern Products Inc., Warrensburg, NY) and cellulose bedding (ALPHA-dri; Shepherd Specialty Papers, Watertown, TN) in filtered, ventilated cage racks (Thoren Caging System Inc., Hazleton, PA). Rats were acclimatized for 1 week before experiments. The animals were treated humanely and with regard for alleviation of suffering. The experimental protocol was reviewed and approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Experimental design</title><p>We conducted two separate experiments as part of this study. The first experiment was a 2-week CD dose&#x02013;response experiment, in which we randomized 40 male Sprague-Dawley rats (220&#x02013;270 g body weight at time of exposure) into five groups (eight rats per group) using a JavaScript random-number&#x02013;generating program (Research Randomizer; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21-ehp0114-001367">Urbaniak and Plous 2003</xref>). We intratracheally (IT) instilled 0.0, 2.5, 10.0, 20.0, or 40.0 mg/rat CD suspended in sterile saline to model CD exposures of coal miners as revealed in autopsy studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5-ehp0114-001367">Douglas et al. 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12-ehp0114-001367">Kuempel et al. 2001</xref>). Eleven days later, we intraperitoneally (IP) injected the classic CYP1A1 inducer BNF (50 mg/kg) in all rats to model the PAH-exposed lung. Two weeks after CD exposure, rats were euthanized by an overdose of sodium pentobarbital. This experiment determined the relationship between CD exposure and expression of the apoptosis mediator Bax. This study also localized Bax expression relative to the expression of CYP1A1 and cytokeratin 8/18, an alveolar type II cell marker.</p><p>The second experiment was designed to inhibit apoptosis in rats exposed to CD and BNF. In this experiment, we randomized 24 male Sprague-Dawley rats (67&#x02013;93 g body weight at time of exposure) into four groups (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t1-ehp0114-001367">Table 1</xref>). We instilled each rat IT with either CD (40 mg/rat) suspended in 0.3 mL saline or saline alone (controls). To inhibit apoptosis, we injected the rats IP with the caspase inhibitor Q-VD-OPH [quinoline-Val-Asp(OMe)-CH<sub>2</sub>-OPH; 15 mg/kg] dissolved in the vehicle [dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO)] or the vehicle alone (controls) on the day of CD exposure. We injected 10 mg/kg Q-VD-OPH on days 5, 9, 10, 11, 12, and 13 postexposure to maintain caspase inhibition, whereas controls received injections of the vehicle. Eleven days after CD exposure, we induced CYP1A1 in all rats by IP injection of BNF (50 mg/kg) in corn oil. This allowed us to determine if apoptosis was etiologically associated with lung changes seen in CD-exposed rats, including <italic>a</italic>) suppression of CYP1A1 activity and CYP1A1 tissue expression, <italic>b</italic>) suppression of CYP2B1 activity, and <italic>c</italic>) histopathologic alterations in lung tissue.

For example, in an autopsy study, the actual measured dust burden (mean &#x000b1; SD) in the lung of nonsmoking coal miners was 16.4 &#x000b1; 8.5 g (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12-ehp0114-001367">Kuempel et al. 2001</xref>). However, most epidemiologic studies indicate no increased risk of lung cancer in coal miners (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13-ehp0114-001367">Kuempel et al. 1995</xref>). A potential difficulty in interpreting the human lung cancer epidemiology studies of CD is the potential confounding from exposure to tobacco, a known lung carcinogen that contains abundant PAHs. This is extremely important in coal miners because in studies where smoking status is known, most coal miners are smokers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22-ehp0114-001367">Vallyathan et al. 1985</xref>). In addition, diesel engine exhaust and other sources of PAHs are present within coal mines. In our study, we have confirmed our previous finding that in mixed exposures to CD and PAHs, CD appears to modify PAH metabolism by inhibiting CYP1A1 induction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8-ehp0114-001367">Ghanem et al. 2004</xref>). In the present study, we also found that CD, like many other agents that cause chronic pulmonary inflammation and fibrosis, increases pulmonary apoptosis and increases expression of the pro-apoptotic mediator Bax. Previous studies suggest that apoptosis plays a role in the pathogenesis of a diverse group of fibrosing lung diseases, including diffuse alveolar damage, idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15-ehp0114-001367">Kuwano et al. 1999</xref>), and silicosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2-ehp0114-001367">Borges et al. 2002</xref>).</p><p>In this study, we demonstrate for the first time that <italic>in vivo</italic> treatment with the pan-caspase inhibitor Q-VD-OPH significantly decreases apoptosis and Bax expression in the lung. Because caspases are mediators of apoptosis, decreased apoptosis is an expected result of caspase inhibition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4-ehp0114-001367">Caserta et al. 2003</xref>). Although somewhat unexpected, caspase inhibition of Bax expression in our study suggests that caspases play a role in Bax expression in this model. Importantly, immunohistochemical detection of Bax expression in lung correlates well with apoptosis and the expression of other apoptosis mediators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14-ehp0114-001367">Kuwano et al. 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18-ehp0114-001367">Plataki et al. 2005</xref>). However, the relationship between increased Bax expression in tissue sections and Bax activation has not been investigated thoroughly.</p><p>CD-associated histopathologic alterations, such as alveolitis and alveolar epithelial cell hypertrophy and hyperplasia, were unaffected by caspase inhibition and decreased apoptosis. Other pan-caspase inhibitors, such as <italic>N</italic>-benzyloxy-carbonyl-Val-Ala-Asp-(<italic>O</italic>-methyl)-fluoromethyl ketone and BOC-Asp(<italic>O</italic>-methyl)-fluoromethyl ketone, have been reported to reduce neutrophil accumulation in the lungs of silicotic mice by 50% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2-ehp0114-001367">Borges et al. 2002</xref>). However, in the present study, the principally histiocytic inflammatory reaction in the lungs of CD-exposed rats was not significantly suppressed by the injection of Q-VD-OPH. Because the histopathologic changes associated with silica exposure involve more neutrophils and are more proliferative than CD-induced pulmonary injury (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9-ehp0114-001367">Green 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11-ehp0114-001367">Kuempel et al. 2003</xref>), these morphologic differences may influence the ability to attenuate silicotic injury through apoptosis inhibition. It may also be that the role of apoptosis in CD- and PAH-induced lung injury is similar to the role of apoptosis in oxygen toxicity, where apoptosis contributes to cell death but caspase inhibition does not significantly alter alveolar damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1-ehp0114-001367">Barazzone et al. 1998</xref>). Alternatively, Bax expression and apoptosis in the CD- and PAH-exposed lung may be involved in resolution of lung injury, as has been suggested in the lipopolysaccharide-exposed lung (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24-ehp0114-001367">Wang et al. 2002</xref>).</p><p>The present study clearly indicates that apoptosis is not a major contributor to early morphologic injury in the CD- and PAH-exposed rat lung. Changes in cellular mediators or signaling cascades that produce Bax activation and increase apoptosis may have a role in CYP down-regulation. Potential candidates would include mediators of particle-induced inflammation including p53, nitric oxide, nuclear factor-&#x003ba;B (NF-&#x003ba;B), and/or initiators of alveolar epithelial proliferation. Indeed, <italic>in vitro</italic> studies indicate down-regulation of CYP1A1 induction by tumor necrosis factor &#x003b1; and activated NF-&#x003ba;B (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20-ehp0114-001367">Tian et al. 2003</xref>).</p><p>In summary, our findings indicate that, in mixed exposures to CD and PAHs, CD modifies important processes associated with the pulmonary response to xenobiotics, notably down-regulating xenobiotic metabolism and increasing apoptosis. However, our findings do not support the hypothesis that apoptosis plays a critical role in early lung injury and the down-regulation of CYP1A1 induction in mixed exposures to CD and PAHs. Therefore, suppression of CYP2B1 and inducible CYP1A1 following CD and PAH exposure is associated with, but not caused by, up-regulation of Bax expression and apoptosis of alveolar cells.</p></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="display-objects"><title>Figures and Tables</title><fig id="f1-ehp0114-001367" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Quantification (mean &#x000b1; SE) of Bax expression in the proximal alveolar region with increasing CD exposure in BNF-exposed rats.
