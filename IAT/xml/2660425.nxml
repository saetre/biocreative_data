Here, however, we show that macrophage-specific Arg1 functions as an inhibitor of inflammation and fibrosis following infection with the Th2-inducing pathogen <italic>Schistosoma mansoni</italic>. Although susceptibility to infection was not affected by the conditional deletion of <italic>Arg1</italic> in macrophages, <italic>Arg1</italic><sup>&#x02212;/flox</sup><italic>;LysMcre</italic> mice died at an accelerated rate. The mortality was not due to acute Th1/NOS2-mediated hepatotoxicity or endotoxemia. Instead, granulomatous inflammation, liver fibrosis, and portal hypertension increased in infected <italic>Arg1</italic><sup>&#x02212;/flox</sup><italic>;LysMcre</italic> mice. Similar findings were obtained with <italic>Arg1</italic><sup>flox/flox</sup><italic>;Tie2cre</italic> mice, which delete <italic>Arg1</italic> in all macrophage populations. Production of Th2 cytokines increased in the infected <italic>Arg1</italic><sup>&#x02212;/flox</sup><italic>;LysMcre</italic> mice, and unlike alternatively activated wild-type macrophages, <italic>Arg1</italic><sup>&#x02212;/flox</sup><italic>;LysMcre</italic> macrophages failed to inhibit T cell proliferation <italic>in vitro</italic>, providing an underlying mechanism for the exacerbated Th2 pathology. The suppressive activity of Arg1-expressing macrophages was independent of IL-10 and TGF-&#x003b2;1. However, when exogenous L-arginine was provided, T cell proliferation was restored, suggesting that Arg1-expressing macrophages deplete arginine, which is required to sustain CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cell responses. These data identify Arg1 as the essential suppressive mediator of alternatively activated macrophages (AAM) and demonstrate that Arg1-expressing macrophages function as suppressors rather than inducers of Th2-dependent inflammation and fibrosis.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><p>While the function of NOS2 in Th1-type immunity has been investigated extensively, the role of Arg1 in the regulation of Th2-type responses is unclear. Previously, we showed that proline production in AAMs is regulated by Arg1 activity. Because proline is essential for collagen synthesis in myofibroblasts, numerous studies have suggested that Arg1-expressing AAMs regulate wound healing and fibrosis. The development of fibrosis in schistosomiasis is dependent on Th2 cytokines, and mice deficient in IL-4/IL-13 fail to upregulate Arg1. Nevertheless, although Arg1 expression is associated with Th2-dependent fibrosis, the contribution of macrophage-specific Arg1 to the pathogenesis of fibrosis in schistosomiasis was unknown. The studies conducted here with two different strains of mice deficient in macrophage-associated Arg1 demonstrate unequivocally that Arg1-expressing macrophages exhibit both anti-inflammatory and anti-fibrotic activity during Th2-driven inflammatory responses. In schistosomiasis, fibrosis, portal hypertension, and variceal bleeding are the primary pathological changes that characterize the severe hepatosplenic form of the disease in humans. It is widely believed that people who fail to adequately activate immune suppressive mechanisms when chronically infected with <italic>S. mansoni</italic> are the individuals who ultimately develop severe disease. Our data identify Arg1-expressing macrophages as critical mediators of immune downmodulation in chronic schistosomiasis.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="15"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Arginase 1 (Arg1) is a cytosolic enzyme constitutively expressed in the liver where it functions in nitrogen elimination by catalyzing arginine hydrolysis to urea and ornithine <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000371-Gordon1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000371-Wynn1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>.

The results from our studies demonstrate that IL-4/IL-13-activated macrophages potently inhibit T cell proliferation.

Instead of promoting Th2 disease, our data suggest that macrophage-specific Arg1 contributes to the resolution of schistosomiasis by inhibiting CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cell effector function. It is also possible that the increased collagen deposition in the knockout mice results from changes in competition for L-arginine by the cytosolic and mitochondrial arginase isoforms. The net arginine-to-proline conversion could be higher in Arg1 null macrophages than in WT macrophages because of differential subcellular compartmentation of ornithine-metabolizing enzymes, which function downstream of the arginases. For example, the cytosolic Arg1 in WT macrophages may compete for substrate with the mitochondrial Arg2, thus diverting ornithine preferentially to a different metabolic fate than ornithine produced by Arg2 within mitochondria. Consequently, the metabolic fate of ornithine in Arg1 null macrophages could be shifted dramatically from the fate observed in WT macrophages. Finally, it is also possible that Arg1-expressing macrophages are simply competing with fibroblasts for L-arginine and in the absence of macrophage-specific Arg1, more substrate is available to activated myofibroblasts, resulting in increased collagen production. Indeed, all three of these mechanisms could be contributing the exacerbated fibrosis observed in the infected macrophage-specific Arg1 null mice.</p><p>Recently, we showed that Arg1-expressing macrophages also regulate type-1 responses <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000371-ElKasmi1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>.

Therefore, although macrophage Arg1 expression is more commonly associated with AAMs found in helminth infections and allergic reactions, we discovered that CAMs also produce Arg1. The combined results from both studies suggest that macrophage-derived Arg1 exhibits important but distinct regulatory activities during Th1 and Th2-type immune responses. During Th1 responses, CAM-derived Arg1 antagonizes NOS2 activity, which promotes infection by intracellular pathogens, while in Th2 responses Arg1-expressing AAMs contribute to the resolution of chronic Th2-driven inflammation and fibrosis by functioning as suppressor cells.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s4"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Ethics statement</title><p>All animal work was conducted according to relevant national and international guidelines.</p></sec><sec id="s4b"><title>Mice, parasite infections</title><p>The generation of control Arg1<sup>flox/flox</sup>, C57BL/6 <italic>Arg1</italic><sup>&#x02212;/flox</sup><italic>;LysMcre</italic> , and BALB/c and C57BL/6 <italic>Arg1</italic><sup>flox/flox</sup><italic>;Tie2cre</italic> mice have been described <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000371-ElKasmi1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>.

Lysates were transferred into a 96 well PCR plate and incubated with 10mM MnCl<sub>2</sub> and 50mM Tris HCl (pH 7.5) for 10 min at 55&#x000b0;C. 25ul of lysate was removed and added to 25 &#x000b5;l 1M arginine (pH 9.7) in a new PCR plate and incubated for 1&#x02013;2 hours at 37&#x000b0;C. 5 &#x000b5;l of each sample was added in duplicate to a 96 well ELISA plate along with 5 &#x000b5;l of each standard, diluted in same assay conditions, starting at 100 mg/dL. Urea determination reagent from BioAssay Systems Quantichrome Urea Assay Kit (Bioassay Systems, Hayward, CA) was used according to the manufacturer's protocol. The concentration of nitrite in supernatants of thioglycollate elicited macrophages was determined spectrophotometrically using Griess reagent. Macrophages were plated at 5&#x000d7;10<sup>5</sup> per well in 96 well tissue culture plates and stimulated with combinations of IL-4 (20ng/mL), IL-13 (20ng/mL), IL-21 (20ng/mL), IFN-&#x003b3; (100units/mL), and LPS (100ng/mL). Supernatants were collected after 24 hours, mixed 1/1 with Griess reagent, and absorbance measured at 543 nm using a SpectraMax 190 (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA). The nitrite concentration was determined using sodium nitrite 22 as a standard.</p></sec><sec id="s4g"><title>RNA isolation and purification and real time polymerase chain reaction</title><p>Thioglycollate elicited macrophages were lysed with Buffer RLT (Qiagen Sciences, Valencia, CA), containing 2-mercaptoethanol, and spun through Qiashredder tubes (Qiagen Sciences, Valencia, CA). Total RNA was extracted using the RNeasy Mini Kit from Qiagen (Qiagen Sciences, Valencia, CA). Individual sample RNA (0.1 &#x000b5;g) was reverse-transcribed using Superscript II (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) and a mixture of oligo (dT) and random primers. Real- time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was performed on an ABI Prism 7900 sequence detection system (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). Relative quantities of mRNA for several genes was determined using SYBR Green PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) and by the comparative threshold cycle method as described by Applied Biosystems for the ABI Prism 7700/7900 sequence detection systems. In this method, mRNAs for each sample were normalized to hypoxanthine guanine phosphoribosyl transferase (HPRT) mRNA amounts and then expressed as a relative increase or decrease compared with uninfected controls.

Slides from weeks 9, 12, and 22 post infection were analyzed for collagen content via second harmonic emission. Second harmonic emission was generated using a Spectra Physics MaiTai HP laser tuned to 810nm (Spectra Physics Corp., CA, USA). Image acquisition was performed on a Leica SP2 confocal microscope (Leica Microsystems, Exton, PA USA) using a 20&#x000d7; oil immersion objective NA 0.70, and a dry condenser, NA. 0.9. The forward propagating signal was detected using the transmitted light detector. To isolate the SHG signal et405/20 and SP700nd8 filters were inserted in the light path between the condenser and detector. (Chroma Technologies Corporation, Rockingham, VT). The SHG intensity was detected without polarization selection.
