We have identified that <italic>LMO2</italic>, a LIM-domain containing transcriptional factor, specifically interacts with <italic>hBex2</italic> but not with mouse <italic>Bex1</italic> and <italic>Bex2</italic>. The interaction was confirmed both by pull-down with GST-<italic>hBex2</italic> and by coimmunoprecipitation assays <italic>in vivo</italic>. Using electrophoretic mobility shift assay, we have demonstrated the physical interaction of <italic>hBex2</italic> and <italic>LMO2</italic> as part of a DNA-binding protein complex. We have also shown that <italic>hBex2</italic> can enhance the transcriptional activity of <italic>LMO2 in vivo</italic>. Furthermore, using mammalian two-hybrid analysis, we have identified a neuronal bHLH protein, <italic>NSCL2</italic>, as a novel binding partner for <italic>LMO2</italic>. We then showed that <italic>LMO2</italic> could up-regulate <italic>NSCL2</italic>-dependent transcriptional activity, and <italic>hBex2</italic> augmented this effect. Thus, <italic>hBex2</italic> may act as a specific regulator during embryonic development by modulating the transcriptional activity of a novel E-box sequence-binding complex that contains <italic>hBex2</italic>, <italic>LMO2</italic>, <italic>NSCL2</italic> and <italic>LDB1</italic>.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Interactions among transcriptional factors provide molecular mechanisms for the highly regulated temporal and spatial gene expression during embryonic development. Importantly, unveiling the function of a novel gene often relies on identifying its interactions with proteins of known function. We have identified a group of genes specifically expressed in human fetal brains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>) including human <italic>Bex2</italic> (previously reported as human <italic>Bex1</italic>), a previously reported brain-expressed, X-linked protein of unknown function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>). The <italic>Bex</italic> gene family is composed of at least six members: <italic>Bex1/Rex3/EG2RVC/NADE4, Bex2</italic>, <italic>Bex3</italic>/<italic>NADE</italic>/<italic>HGR74</italic> and three new <italic>Bexs</italic>, <italic>Bex4/5/6</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>). Two additional <italic>Bex</italic> orthologs, <italic>NADE2</italic> and <italic>NADE3</italic>, were reported to be only expressed in human (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>). Recently, the nomenclature for human <italic>Bex1</italic> and <italic>Bex2</italic> was revised since the previously designated human <italic>Bex1</italic> has higher sequence identity with mouse <italic>Bex2</italic> than with mouse <italic>Bex1</italic> (74 and 68% identity, respectively) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>). With this revision in the nomenclature, the localization of <italic>Bex1&#x02013;4</italic> on the X chromosome from three species&#x02014;human, rat and mouse&#x02014;matches within the cluster (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>). It has been shown that mouse <italic>Bex1</italic> is transiently expressed during early development at the 2&#x02013;8 cell stage, and then again expressed at the blastocyst stage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>). Murine <italic>Bex1</italic> has also been suggested to play a role in neural development. For example, the expression of <italic>Bex1</italic> was suppressed in F9 cells and PC12 cells upon retinoic acid or NGF treatment, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>). Rat <italic>Bex1</italic> was reported as one of the most commonly identified genes in a subtractive screen for ventral mesencephalic genes expressed at E10 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>). Additionally, the high expression profile of <italic>Bex1/2</italic> in the adult brain supports a role of both proteins in the neural activity in mature neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>). However, the molecular mechanisms by which Bex proteins are involved in neurodevelopment remain elusive. Interestingly, both <italic>Bex1</italic> and <italic>Bex2</italic> were recently identified as binding partners for olfactory marker protein (OMP), a soluble protein possibly involved in olfactory signal transduction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>). Despite its interaction with OMP, <italic>Bex2</italic>'s broader expression in the brain other than that restricted for OMP suggests that it may have a broader functional role in the brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>). Moreover, <italic>mBex3</italic>, which has a relatively weaker sequence similarity with <italic>Bex1/2</italic>, was observed to interact with p75NTR in inducing apoptotic cell death (NADE) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>). Thus, the <italic>Bex</italic> family may play a dual role at the transcriptional and cytoplasmic signaling levels during embryonic development.</p><p>To determine the molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying the function of human <italic>Bex2</italic> (previously named <italic>Bex1</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>), we have used a yeast two-hybrid system to screen for interacting proteins of <italic>hBex2</italic>, and identified <italic>LMO2</italic> as a binding protein. <italic>LMO2</italic>, a member of the LIM-only class proteins and formerly named rhombotin-2 (<italic>rbtn-2</italic> or <italic>Ttg-2</italic>), has been extensively reported to play a role in hematopoietic stem cell differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>). The <italic>Drosophila</italic> homolog of <italic>LMO</italic>, <italic>dLMO</italic>, was also indicated in an evolutionarily conserved mechanism involved in patterning appendages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>). Interestingly, recent evidence indicates that <italic>dLMO</italic> controls the responsiveness of PDF-expressing ventral lateral neurons (principle circadian pacemaker cells) to cocaine, which in turn regulate the behavioral sensitivity of the flies to the drug (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>). Furthermore, one of its distant relatives, <italic>LMO4</italic>, has been suggested to play a role in neurogenesis and neurodegenerative disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>). As a highly expressed protein in the brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>), <italic>LMO2</italic> has been reported to be expressed in the hippocampus during development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>). This expression is up-regulated during seizure-induced responses, suggesting a role in neuronal regeneration after epileptic pathogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>).</p><p>We next examined whether <italic>NSCL2</italic>, a neuronal form of Class II bHLH protein SCL, can interact with <italic>LMO2</italic>. It has been reported that <italic>LMO2</italic> may interact with <italic>NSCL1</italic> as an adaptor in addition to other transcription factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>). However, this interaction failed to show direct regulation of transcriptional activity in a previous report (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>). Here we have shown the functional interaction between <italic>LMO2</italic> and NSCL2, suggesting the existence of a novel complex that is composed of <italic>hBex2</italic>, <italic>LMO2, NSCL2</italic> and <italic>LDB1</italic>. The unveiling of this complex may help to understand the molecular mechanisms by which <italic>hBex2</italic> plays a role in transcriptional regulation in the brain during neurodevelopment.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>cDNA plasmid construction</title><p>The full-length cDNAs for <italic>hBex1, hBex2, hBex3(NADE), mBex1, mBex2, mBex3</italic> and various deletion mutants of <italic>hBex2</italic> used in the yeast two-hybrid assay were cloned in frame with the GAL4 DNA-binding domain into vector pAS2-1 (BD_Clontech, CA).

Using the full-length <italic>hBex2</italic> as bait, we screened &#x0223c;1 &#x000d7; 10<sup>7</sup> transformants and acquired &#x0223c;59 His and &#x003b2;-galactosidase positive yeast colonies. Following cDNA plasmid extraction and sequencing analysis, we chose to focus on a candidate cDNA clone corresponding to the complete coding sequence of <italic>LMO2</italic>, a LIM containing a transcriptional regulator involved in neurogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>). The interaction between two proteins was further verified by retransformation into yeast strain SFY-526 to exclude the possibility of a false positive as a result of self-activation.</p><p>To determine the specificity of the interaction between <italic>LMO2</italic> and <italic>hBex2</italic> in the yeast two-hybrid system, we tested whether <italic>LMO2</italic> could interact with other members of the <italic>Bex</italic> family, including <italic>hBex3, mBex1, mBex2</italic> and <italic>mBex3</italic>. For a positive control, we also used the TAX protein of human T-cell leukemia virus type1 because of its self-association (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref>) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>). Among the five <italic>Bex</italic> homolog genes tested in the yeast Gal4-BD construct, only <italic>hBex2</italic> interacted with <italic>LMO2</italic> (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>). More specifically, although it shares 74% amino acid sequence identity with <italic>hBex2</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>), <italic>mBex2</italic> failed to show its interaction with <italic>LMO2</italic> in our assay. Similarly, <italic>mBex1</italic> also showed no interaction with <italic>LMO2</italic> although it also shares high sequence identity (68%) with <italic>hBex2</italic>. Thus, the interaction of human <italic>Bex2</italic> and <italic>LMO2</italic> might be a human species-specific event.</p><p>To identify the binding domain within <italic>hBex2</italic> responsible for interaction between <italic>hBex2</italic> and <italic>LMO2</italic>, we generated several deletion and chimeric <italic>hBex2</italic> mutants for yeast two-hybrid analysis. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, members of the <italic>Bex</italic> family share sequence similarity mainly in the middle (58% identity) and C-terminal (95% identity) regions. Indicated by the yeast two-hybrid assay, the N-terminal region with relatively lower sequence similarity between <italic>hBex2</italic> and <italic>mBex1</italic> (1&#x02013;26 amino acid sequence, 48% identity) was not required for binding to <italic>LMO2</italic>, nor was the C-terminal region (88&#x02013;125), which shares high sequence homology among <italic>Bex</italic> family members (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). In contrast, all constructs containing the middle region of <italic>hBex2</italic> (26&#x02013;88) expressed strong interaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). However, the middle-region fragment alone does not bind to <italic>LMO2</italic>, suggesting that the sequence itself is insufficient for the binding.

Coimmunoprecipitation of <italic>hBex2</italic> and <italic>LMO2</italic> from these extracts using anti-<italic>hBex2</italic> Ab indicates that their interaction may occur during development (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Nuclear colocalization of <italic>hBex2</italic> and <italic>LMO2</italic></title><p><italic>LMO2</italic> is localized to the nucleus to play a role in transcriptional regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>). The interaction of <italic>hBex2</italic> with <italic>LMO2</italic> suggests their subcellular colocalization in the nucleus. Consistent with this prediction, evidence suggests that <italic>hBex2</italic>'s nuclear export sequence (NES) may be insufficient for transporting the protein out of the nucleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>). However, it has been suggested that <italic>hBex2</italic> has a cytoplasmic localization pattern when it is overexpressed in HEK293 cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>). To clarify this issue, we examined the subcellular localization of both endogenous and overexpressed <italic>hBex2</italic> and <italic>LMO2</italic> in cell lines. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, the endogenous <italic>Bex2</italic> and <italic>LMO2</italic> were primarily colocalized in the nuclei of human neuroblastoma M17 cells by double immunofluorescent staining. Similarly, the heterogeneously expressed FLAG-<italic>hBex2</italic> and dsRed-<italic>LMO2</italic> were also colocalized in the nuclei of transient transfected HeLa cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). The nuclear localization of either protein does not seem to be facilitated by the overexpression of their binding partners (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title><italic>hBex2</italic> increases the transcriptional activity of <italic>LMO2</italic></title><p>Previous studies have suggested that <italic>LMO2</italic> can form a DNA-binding complex mediated by the E-box sequence within Class II bHLH transcription factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref>). We speculated that <italic>hBex2</italic> might be involved in the complex formation and play a role in transcriptional regulation. To test this hypothesis, we performed EMSAs using a polyclonal antiserum against <italic>LMO2</italic> and <italic>hBex2</italic>. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>, we found that anti-<italic>hBex2</italic> antibody could generate a super-shift band similar to that seen in the lane with anti-<italic>LMO2</italic> antibody. These data indicate that <italic>hBex2</italic> participates in the formation of a <italic>LMO2</italic>/E-box complex without interfering in the interaction of <italic>LMO2</italic> with other members of the complex that bind to the E-box motif. Furthermore, when the recombinant <italic>hBex2</italic> was used in the assay, it clearly blocked the shift in a concentration-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>), supporting the specificity of the antibodies for the interactions.</p><p>The transcriptional regulation activity of <italic>LMO2</italic> has been detected by using reporter genes containing either the E-box motif (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref>) or Gal4-binding sequences in which <italic>LMO2</italic> was a fusion protein with Gal4-BD domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref>). In order to examine whether the interaction between <italic>LMO2</italic> and <italic>hBex2</italic> affects the transcriptional activity of <italic>LMO2</italic>, we performed the luciferase reporter gene assay using the Gal4 system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref>). cDNA plasmids for <italic>GFP-hBex2</italic> and Gal4-BD-<italic>LMO2</italic> were cotransfected into Cos-7 cells together with a plasmid for luciferase reporter gene driven by Gal4-binding enhancer. <italic>GFP-hBex2</italic> alone had no effect on the luciferase activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>, column 3), while <italic>LMO2</italic> activated the expression of the reporter gene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>, column 4). When <italic>hBex2</italic> and <italic>LMO2</italic> were coexpressed, the luciferase activity was significantly increased compared with that in <italic>LMO2</italic> expression alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>, column 6). The <italic>hBex2</italic>-mediated up-regulation of GAL4-BD-<italic>LMO2</italic>-dependent luciferase activity also correlates with the amount of <italic>hBex2</italic> cDNA used in transfection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title><italic>LMO2</italic> interacts with <italic>NSCL1</italic> and <italic>NSCL2</italic></title><p>To further elucidate the mechanisms by which <italic>hBex2</italic> regulates <italic>LMO2</italic> function at the transcriptional level, we examined the interaction of <italic>LMO2</italic> with class II bHLH proteins during the formation of a DNA-binding complex. There are two class II bHLH proteins, SCL (also known as TAL-1) and <italic>NSCL1</italic>, which are known to interact with <italic>LMO2</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref>). Interestingly, <italic>LMO2</italic> interacts with the brain specific <italic>SCL</italic> homologue <italic>NSCL1</italic>, but showed no effect on their transcriptional activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>). To test whether <italic>LMO2</italic> interacts with <italic>NSCL2</italic>, a <italic>NSCL1</italic> homolog with high sequence similarity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref>) that regulates its transcriptional function, we performed a mammalian two-hybrid assay. Both pGAL4-BD-<italic>LMO2</italic> and pV16-NSCL2 fusion proteins were expressed in HeLa cells to examine their interaction as indicated by luciferase activity. As a control, pPM3-<italic>LMO2</italic> and pVP16-<italic>NSCL1</italic> were coexpressed and were found to induce luciferase activity, consistent with the previous report of their interaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>, column 5). Coexpression of GAL4-BD-<italic>LMO2</italic> and VP16-<italic>NSCL2</italic> significantly activated transcription of the reporter gene. This indicates that <italic>NSCL2</italic> is also a binding partner for <italic>LMO2</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>, column 6). To test if <italic>NSCL2</italic> is part of the complex of <italic>hBex2</italic> and <italic>LMO2 in vivo</italic>, we performed coimmunoprecipitation with human fetal brain tissue. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A&#x02013;C</xref>, <italic>NSCL2</italic> was coexpressed and coimmunoprecipitated with <italic>hBex2</italic> and <italic>LMO2</italic> in human fetal brain extracts.</p></sec><sec><title><italic>hBex2</italic> influences the transcriptional activity of <italic>LMO2</italic> and <italic>NSCL2</italic></title><p>To further explore the physiological relevance of the interaction between <italic>LMO2</italic> and <italic>NSCL2</italic>, and the potential regulatory role of <italic>hBex2</italic> on the <italic>LMO2</italic>&#x02013;<italic>NSCL2</italic> complex, we generated a reporter construct containing three tandem repeated E-boxes adjacent to the firefly luciferase gene. In the absence of <italic>NSCL2</italic>, neither <italic>LMO2</italic> alone, nor the coexpression of <italic>hBex2</italic> and <italic>LMO2</italic>, had any effect on the basal luciferase activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>, columns 3&#x02013;4). <italic>NSCL2</italic>, but not <italic>NSCL1</italic>, was able to activate transcription of the reporter gene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>, columns 5 and 8), consistent with the previous report that <italic>NSCL1</italic> was a relatively weak transcriptional activator (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>). It has been reported that the enhancement or repression of class II bHLH proteins on transcriptional activity depends on both the target genes and the cellular context (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref>). Furthermore, <italic>LMO2</italic> was able to up-regulate <italic>NSCL2</italic>'s transcriptional activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>, column 10), but had no effect on <italic>NSCL1</italic> (column 6). Importantly, coexpression of <italic>hBex2</italic> augmented <italic>LMO2</italic>'s effect on <italic>NSCL2</italic> (column 11). In contrast, expression of <italic>hBex2</italic> alone (data not shown) or together with <italic>LMO2</italic> did not affect <italic>NSCL1</italic>-dependent transcription (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>, column 7). This result suggests that the ability of <italic>hBex2</italic> to up-regulate the transcriptional activity of <italic>NSCL2</italic> may be mediated by <italic>LMO2</italic> within the complex.</p></sec><sec><title><italic>hBex2</italic> complex contains NL1/CLIM2/LDB1</title><p><italic>LDB1</italic> is an important cofactor that is involved in the assembly of multiprotein complexes through interacting with the LIM-domain (hence <italic>LDB1</italic>&#x02014;LIM domain-binding protein 1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">36</xref>). To examine if <italic>LDB1</italic> is part of the <italic>hBex2</italic> complex <italic>in vivo</italic>, we again performed coimmunoprecipitation with human fetal brain tissue. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A and B</xref>, both <italic>LDB1</italic> and <italic>hBex2</italic> were coexpressed in human fetal brain extracts and coimmunoprecipitated by either anti-<italic>hBex2</italic> or anti-<italic>LDB1</italic> antibody. Furthermore, we used antibodies to <italic>LDB1</italic> and <italic>hBex2</italic> for immunoprecipitation and confirmed that both <italic>LMO2</italic> and <italic>NSCL2</italic> are part of the complex now composed of at least <italic>hBex2</italic>, <italic>LMO2, NSCL2</italic> and <italic>LDB1</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8C and D</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>In this report, we have presented evidence supporting the notion that human <italic>Bex2</italic> (previously named human <italic>Bex1</italic>) can specifically bind to <italic>LMO2</italic> and regulate the transcriptional activity of the E-box sequence-binding complex containing <italic>LMO2, NSCL2</italic> and <italic>LDB1</italic>. Using a yeast two-hybrid system, we first identified <italic>LMO2</italic> as a binding partner of <italic>hBex2</italic>. The interaction was characterized by both protein&#x02013;protein interaction <italic>in vitro</italic> and nuclear colocalization. Deletion mutation analysis revealed that the interaction is a human <italic>Bex2</italic> specific regulatory mechanism. Immunoprecipitation experiments with human fetal brain tissue further showed the interactions among the three proteins. Using EMSA and luciferase activity assay, we have demonstrated that <italic>hBex2</italic> can physically interact with <italic>LMO2</italic> and enhances its transcriptional activity through the formation of an E-box-binding complex. We further examined the interaction of <italic>LMO2</italic> with the neuronal bHLH protein, <italic>NSCL2</italic>, and first showed that <italic>NSCL2</italic> serves as functional binding partner for <italic>LMO2</italic>. Our work also suggests that <italic>hBex2</italic> is able to augment the transcriptional activity of the target gene upon expression of all three proteins <italic>in vitro</italic>. Thus, <italic>hBex2</italic> may act as a transcriptional regulator to modulate the activity of <italic>LMO2</italic> and <italic>NSCL2</italic>, which play an important role in embryonic development.</p><sec><title>Functional interaction between <italic>hBex2</italic> and <italic>LMO2</italic></title><p>The interaction of <italic>hBex2</italic> with LIM domain-only protein, <italic>LMO2</italic>, was demonstrated in four independent assays: yeast two-hybrid analysis, <italic>in vitro</italic> affinity chromatography, nuclear colocalization and immunoprecipitation <italic>in vivo</italic>. As a &#x02018;bridge molecule&#x02019;, <italic>LMO2</italic> plays a role in transcriptional regulation through its interaction with other proteins as a DNA-binding complex. There are two possible consequences of a direct interaction between <italic>hBex2</italic> and <italic>LMO2</italic>. One is that <italic>hBex2</italic> inhibits <italic>LMO2</italic> from binding to other proteins. The second is that <italic>hBex2</italic> facilitates the formation of an LMO2-containing protein complex. Our EMSA experiment supports the latter possibility (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). Furthermore, <italic>hBex2</italic> up-regulates transcriptional activity of <italic>LMO2</italic> through protein&#x02013;protein interaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). Our work has further unveiled a novel binding partner for LMO2, NSCL2. <italic>hBex2</italic> augmented <italic>NSCL2</italic>-dependent transcriptional activity, presumably through interacting with <italic>LMO2</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). <italic>LMO2</italic> contains two transactive domains in both the N- and C-terminus as well as two repressive LIM domains. The mechanisms by which <italic>hBex2</italic> up-regulates <italic>LMO2</italic> transcriptional activity may be a result of inhibiting the transcriptional activity of the complex through blocking both repressive LIM domains of <italic>LMO2</italic>, although our attempt in mapping the binding domain within <italic>LMO2</italic> did not yield any conclusive information (data not shown).</p></sec><sec><title>Relevance of the novel <italic>LMO2</italic> complex in neuronal function</title><p>Studies on the interaction between <italic>LMO2</italic> and <italic>SCL</italic> in hematopoiesis has implicated a functional role of bHLH proteins in the LIM-modulation system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">37</xref>). Since both <italic>hBex2</italic> and <italic>LMO2</italic> are expressed in areas of the brain where <italic>SCL</italic> is not detected, <italic>NSCL1</italic> and <italic>NSCL2</italic> became natural candidate bHLH proteins to examine their participation in the binding complex for the E-box motif (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">39</xref>). We have shown that <italic>LMO2</italic> does not affect <italic>NSCL1</italic>-dependent transcription, consistent with a previous finding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>). However, we cannot exclude a potential regulatory role of NSCL1 in an <italic>LMO2</italic> complex. The interaction between <italic>LMO2</italic> and <italic>NSCL2</italic> reported here suggests a neuronal-specific regulatory mechanism mediated by <italic>LMO2</italic> and its binding partners. Furthermore, our work and that of others also provide evidence indicating a potential role for <italic>hBex2</italic> complex in neurodevelopment. This evidence includes the high expression of <italic>hBex2, LMO2</italic> and <italic>NSCL2</italic> in brain; fetal brain tissue-derived yeast two-hybrid system used for detecting their interaction; and demonstration of interaction <italic>in vivo</italic> with human fetal brain tissue. However, further investigation should be performed to determine whether these proteins are colocalized in the same region or are differentiating neurons in embryonic brain tissue.</p></sec><sec><title>Nuclear translocation of <italic>hBex2</italic> and its function</title><p>Consistent with bioinformatics predictions and physiological function, our study suggests that <italic>hBex2</italic> is localized to the nucleus in order to play a role in transcriptional regulation. Interestingly, previous work has suggested that members of <italic>Bex</italic> family may differ in their translocation between the cytoplasm and nucleus. For example, the interaction between <italic>Bex</italic> and OMP may induce the nuclear localization of <italic>Bex</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>). The overexpression of human Bex2 in HEK293 cells has shown a cytoplasmic localization pattern (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>). The discrepancy between our work and this reported result may be due to the use of different cell lines. Future work on subcellular localization of <italic>hBex2</italic> in neuronal tissue would be helpful to clarify this issue. In the case of <italic>hBex3</italic> or NADE, it is predominantly distributed in the cytoplasm for its role in the P75NTR signaling pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>). It has been suggested that the protein translocation of <italic>Bex3</italic> from the nucleus to the cytosol is required for this function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>). This translocation is determined by a NES motif, although mechanisms of regulating the subcellular trafficking remain elusive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>).</p><p>Finally, our study supports a working model in which <italic>hBex2</italic> regulates the transcriptional activity of oligomeric DNA-binding complex containing <italic>LMO2</italic> and <italic>NSCL2</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>). We suggest that human <italic>Bex2</italic> binds to <italic>LMO2</italic> as part of the oligomeric complex that binds to the E-box motif-containing sequence. This interaction may regulate the transcriptional activity of <italic>LMO2</italic> through its binding to <italic>NSCL2</italic> within the DNA-binding complex. The stoichiometry of the complex is unknown, but the E-box-binding modules of the oligomeric complex are provided by at least one <italic>NSCL2</italic> molecule. Another half of an E-motif-binding protein could be either <italic>NSCL2</italic> or another closely related bHLH protein. Therefore, the complex containing <italic>hBex2, LMO2, NSCL2</italic> and <italic>LDB1</italic> will be formed at the E-box site to regulate specific gene expression.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank Ms. Lesley Colgan for critical review of this manuscript.
