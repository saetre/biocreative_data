Mutations in the <italic>APC</italic> gene are somatically derived and prevalent in more than 80% of sporadic cases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. A minority of colorectal cancers is inherited. In familial adenomatosis polyposis (FAP), one allele is inactivated in germline, and the other one somatically [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. In hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer (HNPCC) tumor progression is evoked by an inherited deficiency in one of the DNA mismatch repair genes, and a somatic mutation in the <italic>APC</italic> gene is often a result of an increased mutation rate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. The APC protein normally binds to &#x003b2;-catenin in the cytoplasm and this leads to a rapid degradation of free &#x003b2;-catenin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. Inactivation of the <italic>APC</italic> gene results in a reduced degradation of &#x003b2;-catenin. &#x003b2;-catenin then accumulates in the nucleus, gets attached to Tcf-4/Lef, a transcription factor activating Wnt target genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. &#x003b2;-catenin has also been suggested to activate the <italic>WISP-1</italic> gene, a member of the connective tissue growth factor family, signaling oncogenic events downstream [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>].</p><p>Collagen is the major component of the interstitial extracellular matrix (ECM). ECM is known to play an active role in numerous biological processes such as cell morphogenesis, proliferation, migration, differentiation, apoptosis as well as carcinogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. In a previous study we found that colonic mucosa stromal cells in the majority of colorectal cancers expressed <italic>COL11A1</italic>, while <italic>COL11A1</italic> was expressed only rarely in normal colon mucosa [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. <italic>COL11A1</italic> expression was also found in sporadic adenomas although the difference between normal and adenoma samples was not statistically significant (12). However, only a limited number of polyps were available for study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>].</p><p>A mutation in the <italic>APC</italic> gene constitutes an important event in colorectal carcinogenesis. The Wnt pathway has been suggested to regulate events also in connective tissue, such as activation of the <italic>WISP-1</italic> gene. We therefore hypothesized that also the up regulation of <italic>COL11A1</italic> could be a consequence of an activated Wnt pathway. The hypothesis fits well with the extra-colonic manifestations in FAP, such as skeleton- eye- and mesenteric (desmoids) fibromatosis, which could result from an over-expression of collagens [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. It is also striking that an inactivating mutation in the <italic>COL11A1</italic> gene involves the same organs, since affected individuals with Stickler's syndrome show skeleton and ophthalmic manifestations, such as osteochondrodysplasia, and retinal detachment and blindness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>].</p><p>In this study we investigated the possible up regulation of <italic>COL11A1</italic> in FAP and sporadic colorectal cancer using tissue samples from one FAP patient and patients with sporadic colorectal carcinomas.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Tumors</title><p>Twenty-six normal tissue samples from a FAP patient were collected from ceacum, ascending, transverse, and descending colon as well as rectum.

Total RNA (2 &#x003bc;g) was reverse transcribed in a total of 40 &#x003bc;l reaction mix, with the following conditions: 5 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 50 mM KCL, 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.3, 1 mM dNTP's, 1 U RNase inhibitor (Perkin Elmer), 2.5 U MuLV Reverse transcriptase (Perkin Elmer). PCR reaction volume was 25 &#x003bc;l containing 250 ng of each primer, 250 nM of dNTP's, and 2.5 U of ampliTaq (Gibco, Life Technologies). cDNA was diluted 1:2.5 in water and 10 &#x003bc;l was used for all samples and controls.

Thermocycler (PTC 225, Mj Research) was used with an initial denaturation step of 94&#x000b0;C for 5 min, followed by cycles of 94&#x000b0;C for 45 s, 59&#x000b0;C for 30 s, 72&#x000b0;C for 30 s, and a final elongation step of 72&#x000b0;C for 5 min. The PCR products were amplified 25, 30, and 36 cycles for linear range and separated on a 1.5% agarose gel containing ethidium bromide, experiments were repeated three times using the optimal cycle number. Each experiment was accompanied by amplification of GAPDH as a control and the intensities of the cDNA bands for the PCR product were normalized to the GAPDH band intensities. The intensity of the bands was estimated with the Image Gauge V3.41 software (Fuji Film Science).</p></sec><sec><title>Sequencing</title><p>The germline mutation in exon 15 of the FAP patient was determined using Big Dye kit sequencing on an ABI sequencer (Perkin Elmer).</p></sec><sec><title>Protein truncation test (PTT)</title><p>A 1.3 kb fragment of the <italic>APC</italic> exon 15 was amplified using the apcT7-modified primer 15eT7(5'GGA TCC TAA TAC GAC TCA CTA TAG GAA CAG ACC ACC ATG CTT AAA TAT TCA GAT GAG CAG TTG AA 3') and the antisens primer apcl5;3 (5'GAG CCT CAT CTG TAC TTC TGC 3') [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. Approximately 200 ng genomic DNA and 350 ng of each PCR primer were dispensed in a 50 &#x003bc;l PCR reaction buffer (200 &#x003bc;M dNTPs, 1.5 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub> and 2 U Taq polymerase).

Protein truncation test (PTT) was performed according to the manufactures instructions (Promega). Incorporation of <sup>35</sup>S-Metionin (Amersham) was used to detect the translation products after electrophoretic separation on a 5% SDS-polyacrylamid gel.

It was a deletion of 4 base pairs at nt 4043 in exon 15, codon 1347, confirming the diagnosis of FAP in the patient. Twenty-six samples from normal colon tissue and 14 polyps from the FAP patient were tested for <italic>COL11A1</italic> expression and inactivating mutations of the <italic>APC</italic> gene. RNA extracted from fresh frozen samples from the resected colon in the FAP patient were then studied using a semi-quantitative RT-PCR. Grossly normal biopsies from caecum, ascending, transverse, descending colon, and rectum, as well as polyps from ascending and descending colon, and rectum, were analyzed. Using a three fold reproduced RT-PCR experiment (examples shown in figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>), it was shown that polyps expressed <italic>COL11A1</italic> to a statistically significantly higher level than normal tissue samples (p = 0.001) (figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2a</xref>). The relative lack of RNA made it possible only to make one northern blot experiment using a small number of samples. It was not possible to confirm the results in this experiment, since no signal for <italic>COL11A1</italic> was obtained for normal tissues or polyps. The FAP adenomas showed a similar level of expression as the sporadic adenomas in our previous study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. A comparison of the levels of <italic>COL11A1</italic> expression between FAP adenomas and sporadic colonic carcinomas was demonstrated in a RT-PCR experiment where FAP adenomas and sporadic colorectal tumors were run at the same time (figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2b</xref>). The cancers expressed the RNA to a much higher degree than adenomas. In our previous study, <italic>COL11A1</italic> and <italic>COL5A2</italic> were co-expressed in sporadic colorectal cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. We therefore tested whether <italic>COL5A2</italic> expression was also associated with <italic>COL11A1</italic> in FAP adenomas. However, no expression of <italic>COL5A2</italic> was found in FAP normal cells or FAP adenomas (examples shown in figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). Normal FAP tissue where cells have one APC-allele mutated in germline did not express <italic>COL11A1,</italic> why we hypothesized that a complete inactivation of the wild-type allele by a second mutation was necessary for the up-regulation of <italic>COL11A1.</italic> The 14 FAP adenomas were therefore studied for inactivating second mutations of the wild-type allele by mutation screening using protein truncation test (PTT) and loss of heterozygosity (LOH) studies. All polyps tested had mutations and/or LOH of the wild type allele (figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3a</xref>). Thus, all FAP samples gave evidence for an inactivated wild-type allele. This supports the idea that all polyps were established through an inactivation of the <italic>APC</italic> gene on both alleles, which triggered the adenoma formation and maybe also the up-regulation of <italic>COL11A1</italic> in FAP.</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Example on RT-PCR comparing expression of <italic>GAPDH</italic> (C), <italic>COL11A1</italic> (&#x003b1;1(11)), <italic>COL5A2</italic> (&#x003b1;2(5)) in normal (N), and polyp tissues (P) from one FAP patient.

Mutations of the <italic>APC</italic> gene were searched for by using the protein truncation test (PTT) of exon 15, known to contain the majority of mutations in the so-called mutation cluster region (MCR) (figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3b</xref>). In total 22 of 37 (59%) tumors had a truncated mutation in exon 15. There was no correlation between <italic>COL11A1</italic> expression and a truncating mutation in exon 15 of the <italic>APC</italic> gene. However, the pathway can be activated by other mutations outside exon 15, by mutations not detected by our method, by mutations in other Wnt related genes or even epigenetic alterations. Therefore, we hypothesized that COL11A1 might be up-regulated in a similar fashion as and together with WISP-1. Using the expression of <italic>WISP-1</italic> as an estimate of APC/&#x003b2;-catenin activation, a study was undertaken to find out if <italic>COL11A1</italic> expression correlated with the expression of <italic>WISP-1</italic> in the sporadic colorectal tumor samples. There was a statistically significant up-regulation of <italic>WISP-1</italic> in sporadic carcinomas compared to the expression in normal tissue (p &#x0003c; 0.002).

This supports the hypothesis that the <italic>APC/&#x003b2;-catenin</italic> pathway could influence <italic>COL11A1</italic> expression in FAP. Not all sporadic colorectal carcinomas expressed <italic>COL11A1</italic> in our previous study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. There was no association between an exon 15 truncating <italic>APC</italic> mutation and the expression of <italic>COL11A1</italic> in the 37 sporadic colorectal tumors in this study. In FAP there are frequent examples of an inactivation of both APC-alleles in tumors, while in attenuated APC and sporadic colorectal cancer this is not equally frequent [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. Still, the <italic>APC/&#x003b2;-catenin</italic> pathway is supposed to be involved in the vast majority of sporadic tumors, why we next used the expression of <italic>WISP-1</italic> as an estimate of <italic>APC/&#x003b2;-catenin</italic> pathway activation in the sporadic tumors. <italic>WISP-1</italic> is a member of the connective tissue growth factor family, shown to be over-expressed in 80% of colonic adenocarcinomas.

However, some sporadic tumors with a truncating mutation in exon 15 did not show an up-regulation of the <italic>COL11A1,</italic> and there must be some explanation for that. One possible explanation could be the RT-PCR technique used, or that RNA for some samples could have been degraded for these particular genes even though RNA was not degraded for control genes.

In the case of <italic>WISP-1,</italic> a model has been proposed where epithelial cells express <italic>WISP-1</italic> to activate the Wnt pathway in stromal cells, which answer with secreting <italic>WISP-1,</italic> which in turn stimulates growth. A paracrine and then an autocrine production of <italic>WISP-1</italic> might efficiently stimulate epithelial cells to continue unregulated proliferation and eventual tumor formation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. There may be a similar way for how the <italic>APC</italic> mutation in epithelial cells can induce a reaction in surrounding stromal fibroblasts in sporadic colorectal cancer.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>The results from this study suggest that the up-regulation of COL11A1 in early adenomas in FAP and in sporadic colorectal carcinomas is associated with an activated <italic>APC/&#x003b2;-catenin</italic> pathway. The expression of <italic>COL11A1</italic> could directly contribute to tumorigenesis in fibroblasts in FAP and explain osteomas and desmoids, or indirectly to polyp-formation and tumor progression in sporadic colorectal cancer.</p></sec><sec><title>Pre-publication history</title><p>The pre-publication history for this paper can be accessed here:</p><p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri"
