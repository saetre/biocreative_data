Mutations in the PS1 and PS2 genes that cause autosomal-dominant early-onset Alzheimer's disease (AD) disrupt several cellular pathways, including altered &#x003b3;-secretase&#x02013;mediated cleavage of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) to form amyloid &#x003b2; (A&#x003b2;) peptides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Duff et al., 1996</xref>) and disruption of intracellular Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> homeostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">LaFerla, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Demuro et al., 2005</xref>). Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> signaling disruptions manifest as enhanced filling of ER Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> stores (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Leissring et al., 1999b</xref>), attenuation of capacitive Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> entry stores (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Leissring et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Yoo et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Smith et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Herms et al., 2003</xref>), and by exaggerated liberation of Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> from the ER by the second messenger inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP<sub>3</sub>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Leissring et al., 1999b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Yoo et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Smith et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Stutzmann et al., 2004</xref>). Given that mutations in presenilin disrupt intracellular Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> signaling, we set out to determine whether presenilins may serve a physiological role in intracellular Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> homeostasis.</p><p>In support of a role in Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> homeostasis, overexpression of wild-type PS1 or PS2 in <italic>Xenopus laevis</italic> oocytes causes enhanced IP<sub>3</sub>-mediated Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> release, an effect that is exacerbated by mutations in both genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Leissring et al., 1999b</xref>). However, it remains unclear whether the exaggerated IP<sub>3</sub>-evoked responses result from modulation of the IP<sub>3</sub> signaling pathway, such as sensitization of IP<sub>3</sub> receptors by presenilins, or as a consequence of overfilling of ER stores. Recently, the presenilins have been reported to be able to form ER leak channels, and it has been reported that mutations in the presenilins disrupt this function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Tu et al., 2006</xref>). However, it is unclear how leak channel formation could account for the numerous reports of wild-type presenilin overexpression increasing IP<sub>3</sub>-mediated calcium release.</p><p>Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> pumps, along with Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> release channels, are the key components of Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> regulatory systems in neuronal and nonneuronal cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Berridge et al., 2000</xref>). The sarco ER Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>-ATPase (SERCA) pumps have the highest affinity for Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> removal from the cytosol and, together with plasma membrane Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>-ATPases and transporters, determine the resting cytosolic Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> concentration. Three differentially expressed genes encode at least five isoforms of the SERCA pump. SERCA1a and -1b are expressed in skeletal muscle, whereas SERCA2a is expressed in cardiac muscle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aubier and Viires, 1998</xref>). SERCA2b, which has a C-terminal extension, is ubiquitously expressed in smooth muscle tissues and nonmuscle tissues including neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Baba-Aissa et al., 1998</xref>). SERCA3 has limited expression in various nonmuscle tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Baba-Aissa et al., 1998</xref>).</p><p>Given that overfilled ER Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> stores are one consequence of most PS1 mutations, we hypothesized that presenilin may regulate SERCA pump activity. In this paper, we used both gain-of-function and loss-of-function genetic approaches to show that presenilins are required for proper functioning of SERCA activity in both mammalian cell lines and <italic>X. laevis</italic> oocytes. Notably, we find that presenilins physically associate with SERCA, and modulation of SERCA function via genetic or pharmacological means results in altered A&#x003b2; production. Furthermore, SERCA2b knockdown mimics the Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> dynamics seen in presenilin-null cells. Collectively, these results suggest that presenilins regulate and are necessary for normal functioning of the SERCA2b pump, most likely through a direct protein&#x02013;protein interaction, and that SERCA activity itself impacts A&#x003b2; generation.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Elevated cytosolic Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> levels and attenuated ER Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> stores in presenilin-null cells</title><p>We previously showed that presenilin mutations lead to enhanced filling of ER Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> stores (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Leissring et al., 1999a</xref>,b). To further explore the role of endogenous presenilin in intracellular Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> signaling, we investigated ER Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> stores in immortalized mouse embryonic fibroblast (MEF) cells from presenilin double-knockout (PSDKO) mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Herreman et al., 1999</xref>). Cytosolic Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> signals were recorded in Fura-2-AM&#x02013;loaded cells before and during stimulation with 1 &#x003bc;M thapsigargin, a potent irreversible inhibitor of the SERCA pump (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Lytton et al., 1991</xref>).</p><p>PSDKO fibroblasts displayed elevated resting cytosolic Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> levels compared with control cells (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1, A and B</xref>). Application of thapsigargin in the bath perfusion promoted a transient rise of cytosolic [Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>] signal as a consequence of constitutively active Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> leakage from the ER, providing a signal proportional to the amount of Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> sequestered in the ER, although it does not take into account differences in Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> efflux across the plasma membrane. PSDKO fibroblasts showed reduced responses to thapsigargin as compared with control fibroblasts (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 B</xref>). These results are consistent with diminished SERCA activity, as it is this ER Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> pump which helps to maintain low cytosolic resting Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> level by actively pumping Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> from the cytosol into the ER stores, thereby regulating the Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> levels between the two compartments.</p><fig position="float" id="fig1"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p><bold>Elevated cytosolic Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> and reduced ER Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> stores in presenilin-null cell line.</bold> (A) Changes in cytosolic Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> evoked by thapsigargin in control fibroblasts (control; <italic>n</italic> &#x0003d; 48 cells) and fibroblasts from PSDKO (<italic>n</italic> &#x0003d; 57 cells), PS1KO (<italic>n</italic> &#x0003d; 48), and PS2KO (<italic>n</italic> &#x0003d; 56) mice. ER Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> stores were released into the cytosol by application of 1 &#x003bc;M thapsigargin, a specific blocker of SERCA activity, with 0 mM Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> in the bathing solution. Basal cytosolic Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> levels were elevated (&#x0223c;70 nM) in the PSDKO and PS2KO fibroblasts compared with controls and PS1KO cells (&#x0223c;50 nM; P &#x0003c; 0.05), whereas the peak Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> signals after application of thapsigargin were substantially reduced in PSDKO and PS2KO fibroblasts.

No significant differences were apparent in either basal cytosolic Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> levels or the peak response after application of 1 &#x003bc;M thapsigargin.

Basal cytosolic Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> levels were elevated in the PS2KO cells at comparable levels to those observed in the PSDKO fibroblasts. Likewise, the PS2KO cells also showed diminished responses after treatment with thapsigargin. In contrast, the PS1KO cells showed small or no changes in basal Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> levels but did show diminished thapsigargin-mediated responses (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1, A and B</xref>). Therefore, although both PS1 and 2 appear to regulate intracellular Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> homeostasis, it appears to be PS2 that plays a larger role in maintaining low cytosolic Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> levels and appropriate filling of ER Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> stores. We next looked at ionomycin-evoked calcium release in control and PSDKO cells (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 C</xref>). Ionomycin is an ionophore that causes the release of Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> from most intracellular stores. Application of 1 &#x003bc;M ionomycin in the absence of extracellular Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> evoked smaller rises and areas under the curve (9,425 vs. 7,394 fluorescent units) from the PSDKO cells compared with the controls.</p><p>The presenilins are an integral part of the &#x003b3;-secretase complex that is responsible for cleavage of the C99 fragment of APP to form A&#x003b2; and the APP intracellular domain (AICD). Cells lacking presenilins do not have &#x003b3;-secretase activity and consequently produce no A&#x003b2; or AICD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Zhang et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Hass and Yankner, 2005</xref>). Because the absence of the AICD region of APP has been shown to cause deficits in Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> release from ER stores (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Leissring et al., 2002</xref>), we sought to determine whether the Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> dyshomeostasis in PSDKO cells could be attributed to lack of AICD production rather than to the absence of presenilins themselves. For this purpose, PSDKO fibroblasts were transfected with the AICD (C57) fragment and compared with control pseudo-cDNA (pcDNA)&#x02013;transfected PSDKO fibroblasts. However, even after 48 h of incubation to allow expression of AICD (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 D</xref>), control and AICD-expressing PSDKO fibroblasts showed no significant differences in basal or thapsigargin-evoked Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> levels. Given that overexpression of AICD into PSDKO cells did not recover either basal or thapsigargin-evoked Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> levels, we then overexpressed PS1, PS2, or both together in PSDKO cells. Overexpression of either PS1, PS2, or both together rescued both the basal and thapsigargin-evoked Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> levels to the same degree (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2, A and B</xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="fig2"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><p><bold>Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> deficits in presenilin-null fibroblasts are not caused by reduced SERCA2b expression.</bold> (A) Changes in cytosolic Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> evoked by thapsigargin in PSDKO fibroblasts transfected 48 h earlier with pcDNA (<italic>n</italic> &#x0003d; 25 cells), PS1 (<italic>n</italic> &#x0003d; 40 cells), PS2 (<italic>n</italic> &#x0003d; 48 cells), or both PS1 and 2 (<italic>n</italic> &#x0003d; 47 cells), with 0 mM Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> in the bathing solution. Basal cytosolic Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> levels were reduced (&#x0223c;20 nM) in the presenilin-transfected fibroblasts compared with controls, whereas the peak Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> signals after application of thapsigargin were significantly increased in presenilin-transfected fibroblasts.

Surprisingly, we found that SERCA2b steady-state levels, the isoform of SERCA found in brain neurons, were elevated, rather than diminished, in the PSDKO fibroblasts (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2, C and E</xref>), suggesting that SERCA activity was impaired in the absence of presenilins and that the cells attempt to compensate by increasing SERCA expression. The presence of either PS1 or 2 is sufficient to prevent this increase in SERCA2b steady-state levels as shown in PS1KO and PS2KO cell lines (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2, D and E</xref>). Given our hypothesis that SERCA activity was impaired in the absence of presenilin, we attempted to mimic the Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> phenotype seen in PSDKO cells via siRNA knockdown of SERCA2b in CHO cells. Knockdown of SERCA2b levels resulted in elevated basal Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> levels, and a marked decrease in thapsigargin evoked Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> release (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 F</xref>). This phenotype was remarkably similar to that seen in the PSDKO cell line, giving further credence to presenilin regulation of SERCA function. It should be noted that it is unlikely that changes in SERCA function directly modulate basal cytosolic Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> levels but that they probably do so through changes in other Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> influx pathways such as store-operated Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> entry.</p></sec><sec><title>PS1 and PS2 mimic SERCA2b-accelerated cytosolic Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> clearance</title><p>Based on these data from presenilin-null cell lines, we moved to a more regulatable system to directly establish whether presenilins modulate SERCA pump activity. We used the <italic>X. laevis</italic> oocyte expression system to monitor the clearance of Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> ions from the cytosol after a transient influx across the plasma membrane. For this purpose, oocytes were induced to express the Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>-permeable nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) that served as a &#x0201c;Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> switch,&#x0201d; allowing precisely controlled cytosolic Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> transients to be evoked by pulsing the membrane potential to strongly negative voltages to increase the electrochemical driving force for Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> entry. Oocytes were loaded with the Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>-sensitive dye Oregon Green BAPTA 1 and were voltage-clamped at a holding potential of 0 mV to minimize Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> influx. In the presence of 100&#x02013;500 nM acetylcholine, a brief (300 ms) hyperpolarizing pulse to &#x02212;150 mV produced a transient Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> fluorescence signal because of Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> influx through open nicotinic channels. The decay rate of the fluorescence signals after termination of the voltage pulse was then used to quantify the rate of Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> sequestration from the cytosol.

Moreover, given that presenilins are integral for the production of A&#x003b2;, we investigated whether SERCA function influenced A&#x003b2; production. To address this issue, we used pharmacological and gain-of-function and loss-of-function genetic approaches. First, we considered the consequences of overexpressing SERCA2b in CHO cells stably expressing APP. After 48 h, we found that higher SERCA2b levels caused a marked increase in A&#x003b2;40 production (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8 A</xref>).

These pathological disruptions in Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> signaling suggest that the presenilins may play a physiological role in cellular Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> regulation, although this has not been firmly established or characterized. In this paper, we examined the role of wild-type presenilins on Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> regulation in a mammalian cell system by using genetic knockout models and also in <italic>X. laevis</italic> oocytes through protein overexpression. Our results indicate that the presenilins regulate the activity of the SERCA pump and are necessary for its proper functioning. Indeed, siRNA knockdown of SERCA leads to a phenotype resembling presenilin-null cells (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 A</xref> vs. <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 F</xref>), including elevated basal Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> levels (also seen in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Zhang et al. [2006]</xref>) and diminished thapsigargin-mediated Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> release. Altered cytosolic Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> levels probably arise because of changes in other Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> influx pathways as a result of SERCA down-regulation, as it is unlikely that SERCA directly controls basal cytosolic Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>. However, both of these phenotypes in presenilin-null cells are rescued by overexpression of presenilin (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 A</xref>). Although interpretation of our functional data in cell lines is dependent on Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> rises evoked by thapsigargin, which has pitfalls associated with it, the data obtained in oocytes confirm presenilin as a positive modulator of SERCA function. Overexpression of presenilins accelerates the clearance of a known quantity of Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> from the cytosol with similar dynamics to SERCA overexpression. Crucially, accelerated Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> clearance with presenilin overexpression is prevented by pharmacological inhibition of SERCA, providing direct functional evidence for an interaction between presenilin and SERCA. Supporting a physiological role for the presenilins, a recent study suggested that they can form Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> leak channels in the ER (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Tu et al., 2006</xref>) and are an integral part of intracellular Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> homeostasis via passive leak from the ER stores. The prospect of presenilins forming ER leak channels is, however, at odds with the observation that overexpression of presenilins leads to enhanced IP<sub>3</sub>-mediated Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Leissring et al., 1999a</xref>,b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Smith et al., 2002</xref>). Wild-type presenilin should increase passive leak from the ER stores, resulting in diminished IP<sub>3</sub>-mediated Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> release, whereas the opposite actually occurs, with FAD-linked presenilin mutations augmenting IP<sub>3</sub>-mediated Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> release even further (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Leissring et al., 1999a</xref>,b). This paradox suggests that presenilins also have an impact on Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> homeostasis through other means, which should be sufficient to explain how wild-type presenilin overexpression enhances IP<sub>3</sub>-mediated responses, whereas presenilin knockout cells have reduced IP<sub>3</sub>-mediated responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Leissring et al., 2002</xref>). Presenilin regulating SERCA function is consistent with both of these observations, as we have shown in both mammalian cell lines and <italic>X. laevis</italic> oocyte expression systems, with overexpression of SERCA resulting in enhanced IP<sub>3</sub>-mediated Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> release mimicking the phenotype seen with overexpression of presenilin (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>). Combining this with our data, it appears that presenilins contribute to both the active filling of the ER stores and the passive emptying and helps explain why mutations in these proteins have such widespread effects on global Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> signaling.</p><p>As both presenilin and SERCA have activities that can be modulated by several proteins as well as by one another, this presents an interesting question: if presenilins regulate SERCA function, then can SERCA also regulate &#x003b3;-secretase activity? Several studies have illustrated how modulating Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> influx can modulate production of the A&#x003b2; peptide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Querfurth and Selkoe, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Pierrot et al., 2004</xref>), as well as increasing intracellular store release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Querfurth et al., 1997</xref>). Indeed, any regimen that affects intracellular Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> will invariably alter the activity of SERCA, as it is itself modulated by cytosolic and ER Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> concentration as models have shown (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Yano et al., 2004</xref>). In this paper, we demonstrate through both pharmacological and genetic means that modulation of SERCA2b function results in altered A&#x003b2; production with decreased SERCA function leading to decreased A&#x003b2; and increased SERCA function leading to increased A&#x003b2;. Therefore, it seems possible that SERCA activity plays a modulatory role in &#x003b3;-secretase function or at least in APP processing leading to further generation of the A&#x003b2; peptide. Curiously, it has been reported that either stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Pierrot et al., 2004</xref>) or inhibition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Yoo et al., 2000</xref>) of capacitative Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> entrance (CCE) leads to increased production of A&#x003b2;<sub>42</sub>. Our results show that thapsigargin treatment, which depletes ER stores, diminishes A&#x003b2; production, yet depletion of ER stores leads to increased Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> influx via CCE. This suggests that depleting ER stores of Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> has a stronger effect on preventing A&#x003b2; production than CCE activation has on inhibiting it.</p><p>Numerous proteins, such as calsenilin, ryanodine receptor, and calmyrin (for review see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chen and Schubert, 2002</xref>), have been shown to interact with and bind the presenilins as well as the known components of the &#x003b3;-secretase complex (nicastrin, PEN2, and Aph1), making the presenilins part of a very large multiprotein complex with multiple functions. Our results suggest that the interaction between SERCA and presenilin is an additional, but very important, interaction that serves to regulate sequestration of calcium into the ER stores, making presenilin a key component of cellular calcium homeostasis. A puzzling aspect is how mutations in the presenilins that modulate &#x003b3;-secretase activity could cause the increases in intracellular Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> signaling reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Leissring et al., 1999a</xref>,b). Conversely, inhibitors of &#x003b3;-secretase, which bind to the active site of presenilin in the &#x003b3;-secretase complex, completely diminish ER Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Leissring et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Kasri et al., 2006</xref>). Mutations in presenilin have been reported to disrupt the formation of ER leak channels, thereby preventing passive Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> leak, which then leads to store overfilling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Tu et al., 2006</xref>) and, hence, exaggerated IP<sub>3</sub>-mediated release. Whether these same mutations also affect presenilins' modulation of SERCA function remains to be seen, but many of these FAD-linked mutations are associated with an increase, or at least change, in &#x003b3;-secretase activity, making the prospect plausible. Indeed, we have shown here that the FAD-linked PS1 mutation M146V does show enhanced clearance of cytosolic Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> compared with wild-type PS1. The requirement of SERCA activity to have presenilins present may provide problems for drugs that inhibit the actions of the &#x003b3;-secretase complex to therapeutically reduced A&#x003b2; levels in AD. Such drugs have already been shown to abolish ER Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> release in cell cultures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Leissring et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Kasri et al., 2006</xref>) but their chronic in vivo use has yet to be documented. Certainly, reducing or abolishing ER Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> release in neurons will have massive implications on memory and behavior, which suggests that BACE may be a more prudent drug target to reduce A&#x003b2; in AD.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Cell culture and calcium imaging</title><p>MEFs (Bart de Strooper, Katholieke Universiteit Leuven, Leuven, Netherlands) and CHO cells were maintained with DME and 10% FBS.

Fluorescence signals were monitored from a 40 &#x000d7; 40-&#x003bc;m region within the animal hemisphere of the oocyte and are expressed as a ratio (&#x00394;F/F<sub>o</sub>) of the mean change in fluorescence (&#x00394;F) relative to the resting fluorescence before stimulation (F<sub>o</sub>) using MetaMorph software (MDS Analytical Technologies). Mean values of F<sub>o</sub> were obtained by averaging over several frame before stimulation.</p><p>Experiments measuring Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> liberation in response to photolysis of caged IP<sub>3</sub> (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>) were performed using a linescan confocal microscope (IX-70 inverted microscope with a 40&#x000d7; oil-immersion fluor objective lens, using a 488-nm beam from a 100-mW argon laser [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Callamaras and Parker, 1999</xref>]) to image fluorescence signals evoked by flashes of UV light (340&#x02013;400 nm) from a mercury arc lamp, illuminating a disc of 100-&#x003bc;m diameter surrounding the 50-&#x003bc;m scan line in the animal hemisphere of the oocyte.</p></sec><sec><title>Protein immunoblotting</title><p>Protein extracts were prepared from cells using M-per (Thermo Fisher Scientific) extraction buffer and Complete Mini Protease Inhibitor Tablets (Roche). Protein concentrations were determined by the Bradford method. Equal amounts of protein (10 &#x003bc;g) were separated by SDS/PAGE on a 4&#x02013;12% Bis/Tris gel (Invitrogen), transferred to PDVF membranes, blocked for 1 h in 5% vol/vol nonfat milk in Tris-buffered saline, pH 7.5, supplemented with 0.2% Tween 20, and incubated overnight at 4&#x000b0;C with primary antibody. Antibodies and dilutions used in this study include &#x003b1;-SERCA2b (1:20,000; F. Wuytack, Katholieke Universiteit Leuven, Leuven, Netherlands), CTF20 (1:5,000; EMD), and &#x003b1;-Actin (1:10,000; Sigma-Aldrich).
