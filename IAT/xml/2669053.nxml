For most of their energy needs, normal cells rely on a process called respiration, which consumes oxygen and glucose to make energy-storing molecules of adenosine triphosphate (ATP). But cancer cells typically depend more on glycolysis, the anaerobic breakdown of glucose into ATP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Warburg had identified a particular metabolic pathway in carcinomas characterized by the anaerobic degradation of glucose even in the presence of oxygen (known as the Warburg effect) 80 years ago [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Although the molecular basis for the altered glucose metabolism has not been identified yet, widespread clinical use of positron-emission tomography (PET) has confirmed that there exists enhanced glucose degradation in tumors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. At the annual meeting (2006) of American Association of Cancer Research, Gottlieb launched a lecture with this provocative claim: "I believe I'm working on the seventh element, which is bioenergetics."</p><p>Tumor cells need large energy and nucleic acids to proliferate and grow. The pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) is an important pathway in glucose metabolism. Transketolase is a crucial enzyme in the nonoxidative pathway of the PPP. It plays a crucial role in nucleic acid ribose synthesis utilizing glucose carbons in tumor cells. Boros[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>] found that more than 85% of ribose recovered from nucleic acids of certain tumor cells is generated directly or indirectly from the nonoxidative pathway of the PPP. Three human transketolase genes have been recognized: they are transketolase(TKT), transketolase-like gene 1 (TKTL1) and transketolase-like gene 2 (TKTL2). Langbein[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>] found that TKTL1 mRNA and protein are specifically over-expressed in tumors, whereas TKT and TKTL2 expression are not upregulated. Staiger[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>] found that the upregulation of TKTL1 is a common phenomenon in gastric cancer and cancer of the gastroesophageal junction leading to an enhanced, oxygen-independent glucose usage which might contribute to a more aggressive tumor growth.</p><p>Uterine cervix cancer is a common tumor in women. Diffusion and metastasis play an important role in unfavourable prognosis of uterine cervix cancer. We knew little about the mechanism of invasion and metastasis in uterine cervix. Kohrenhagen[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>] found that TKTL1 plays an important role in the progression of cervical neoplasia. But, the relative contributions of TKTL1 gene to energy metabolism and cell proliferation in uterine cervix cancer have not been investigated. In the present study, the relationship between transketolase-like gene 1 and transketolase activity or cell proliferation was investigated in uterine cervix cancer. These results indicate that TKTL1 gene influences cell proliferation by regulating total transketolase activity in human uterine cervix cancer cells.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Reagent and Instrument</title><p>DMEM, Lipofectamine&#x02122; 2000 and Trizol were obtained from Invitrogen Co (Carlsbad, CA, USA); Keratinocyte serum-free medium (KER &#x02013; SFM) were obtained from GIBCO (New York, USA).

HeLa cells were cultured in DMEM, Endl/E6E7 cells were cultured in KER-SFM medium supplemented with 10%FCS at 37&#x000b0;C with 5% CO<sub>2</sub>.</p></sec><sec><title>Plasmid construction</title><p>The candidate siRNA sequence specific for human TKTL1 mRNA was selected and designed by using online tools from Genesil Biotechnology Company. The selected candidate siRNA sequences were also checked to avoid any possible match with other genes or polymorphism of the target gene by Blast search. Three siRNA targeting human TKTL1 mRNA (National Center for Biotechnology Information access number: BC025382) and one scrambled siRNA (used for a negative control) with the following sequences were used: TKTL1 siRNA no.1, GCAGTCAGATCCAGAGAAT; TKTL1 siRNA no.2, GTTGGCATGCAAAGCCAAT; TKTL1 siRNA no.3 CAACAGAGTCGTTGTGCTG; negative TKTL1 siRNA control, GACTTCATAAGGCGCATGC. All siRNA sequences were synthesized by Wuhan Genesil Biotechnology Company, Wuhan, China. Synthetic sense and antisense oligonucleotides constitute the template for generating RNA composed of two identical 19-nt sequence motifs in an inverted orientation, separated by a 9-bp (TTCAAGACA) spacer to form a double strand hairpin of siRNA. Two micrograms of both oligonucleotide were annealed for 3 minutes at 94&#x000b0;C, for 30 minutes at 37&#x000b0;C, and for 10 minutes at 65&#x000b0;C, then ligated into 2 &#x003bc;g of pEGFP-C1-U6 plasmid (containing kanamycin resistance gene; the mouse U6 RNA Polymerase III promoter; enhanced green fluorescence protein clone) linearized with BamHI and HindIII. These constructs were cloned to competent <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>, according to the manufacture's instructions (Invitrogen). The sequences of the insert was confirmed by automated sequencing and by analyzing the fragments generated from digestion with BamHI. The resultant plasmids containing siRNA sequences 1, 2, 3 and negative control sequences were named pSih TKTL1-1, pSih TKTL1-2, pSih TKTL1-3 and pNC, respectively.</p></sec><sec><title>Transfection</title><p>HeLa Cells and End1/E6E7 cells were stably transfected with three TKTL1 siRNA and a negative control siRNA in presence of Lipofectamine 2000 on 6-well plates according to the manufacturer's instruction, respectively. Transfected cells were selected for neomycin resistance in DMEM containing G418 for 4 weeks. Surviving colonies were isolated and expanded. These cells were harvested and TKTL1 mRNA levels were analyzed by real-time PCR at 96 h after cultured. Of the three plasmids tested, only one gave rise to over 80% inhibition of TKTL1. We select the plasmid named pSih TKTL1 to transfect HeLa Cells or End1/E6E7 cells in the posterior experiment. The negative control siRNA plasmid (without the shRNA coding DNA) did not show any significant level of TKTL1 reduction.</p></sec><sec><title>RT-PCR</title><p>Total RNA was extracted from above-mentioned cells by using Trizol reagent according to the manufacturer's instructions. ReverTraAce-&#x003b1;-&#x02122; reverse transcription kit was used for reverse transcription following instruction manual. Real-time analysis was carried out on a Light Cycler Real-Time PCR Instrument by using SYBR Green I dye according to the manufacturer's protocol. Reactions were performed in a 25 &#x003bc;L volume. Real-time PCR was conducted by using the following parameters: denaturing at 94&#x000b0;C for 3 min, 40 cycles at 94&#x000b0;C for 5 s and at 57&#x000b0;C for 5 s. &#x003b2;-actin gene was used as an internal control and each assay included standard samples in duplicates. Data analysis was carried out by using LightCycler Data Analysis Software. In addition, PCR products were gel-separated to confirm the bands of the expected size. Basically, quantitative values are obtained from the threshold cycle number at which the increase in the signal associated with an exponential growth of PCR products starts to be detected. Final results, expressed as N-fold differences in target gene expression relative to the reference gene GAPDH, termed 'Ntarget', were determined as follows:</p><p><disp-formula>Ntarget = 2<sup>(delta Ct sample - delta Ct reference gene)</sup>.</disp-formula></p><p>Where delta Ct values of the sample and reference were determined by subtracting the average Ct value of the test gene from the average Ct value of the &#x003b2;-actin gene. The sequence of primer for three known human transketolase genes and &#x003b2;-actin were from reference.4. &#x003b2;-actin gene was amplified as internal control. The sequences of primers for TKT, TKTL1, TKTL2 were obtained by referring to Coy <italic>et al </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. The sequences of primers for &#x003b2;-actin gene: 5'-GTG CGT GAC ATT AAG GAG-3'(sense), 5'-CTA AGT CAT AGT CCG CCT-3'(antisense) were designed by using Primer Premier 5.0 software package.

For most of their energy needs, malignant cells typically depend on glycolysis mainly, the anaerobic breakdown of glucose into ATP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Malignant cells characteristically exhibit an increased reliance on anaerobic metabolism of glucose to lactic acid even in the presence of abundant oxygen had been described by Warburg 80 years ago [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. But, this theory was gradually discredited. Latter Following the development of bioenergetics, recent studies demonstrated that energy metabolism in malignant cells is significantly enhanced compared to those in the normal cells, especially glycometabolism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. The malignant cells maintain ATP production by increasing glucose flux because anaerobic metabolism of glucose to lactic acid is substantially less efficient than oxidation to CO<sub>2 </sub>and H<sub>2</sub>O. PET imaging has demonstrated a direct correlation between tumor aggressiveness and the rate of glucose consumption [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. It is now widely applied to human cancers because the vast majority of primary and metastatic tumors demonstrate substantially increased glucose uptake compared with normal tissue. The majority of nucleic acids for tumor cells growth are generated directly or indirectly from the nonoxidative pathway of the PPP. Transketolase is a crucial enzyme in the nonoxidative pathway of the PPP. It has been presumed that transketolase activity possibly plays an important role in the tumor cell proliferation. Boros [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>] found that the PPP was directly involved in degradation of glucose and played a crucial role in nucleic acid ribose synthesis utilising glucose carbons in tumor cells. Coy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>] indicated that tumor cells which upregulate transketolase enzyme reactions can use glucose as an energy source through nonoxidative generation of ATP. Using metabolic control analysis methods and oxythiamine, Comin-Anduix [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>] demonstrated that transketolase enzyme reactions determine cell proliferation in the Ehrlich's ascites tumor model.</p><p>Ttransketolase gene family remember include transketolase(TKT), transketolase-like gene 1 (TKTL1) and transketolase-like gene 2 (TKTL2). The relative contributions of transketolase gene family to energy metabolism and proliferation of uterine cervix cancer cell have not been investigated. In the present study, the total transketolase activity was measured in the HeLa cells and End1/E6E7 cells. We found that the total transketolase activity was significantly increased in the HeLa cells compare to End1/E6E7 cells. In order to estimate whether TKTL1 play an important role in the total transketolase activity in the HeLa cells and End1/E6E7 cells, the relative expression level of each member of the transketlase gene family was determined by real-time PCR in HeLa and End1/E6E7 cells. We found that there was no significant difference in the expression level of TKT and TKTL2 gene between the HeLa and End1/E6E7 cells, the expression level of the TKTL1 gene was high in the HeLa cells compared to End1/E6E7 cells. After transfected siRNA TKTL1 construct, the total transketolase activity was significantly decreased in the HeLa cells. However, there was no significant difference existed in total transketolase activity in the End1/E6E7 cells after transfected siRNA TKTL1 construct. These results demonstrated that TKTL1 play a key role in the total transketolase activity in the HeLa cells, yet not so in the End1/E6E7 cells. In order to explore the effect of TKTL1 on cell proliferation of cervix cancer cell, we transfected the HeLa cells and End1/E6E7 cells with siRNA TKTL1 construct. Our results demonstrated that the proliferation of HeLa cells was significantly inhibited, and the cells were blocked in G<sub>0</sub>/G<sub>1 </sub>stage. Whereas, there was no significant change in cell proliferation and cell cycle in the End1/E6E7 cells. So, we think that strong TKTL1 expression was correlated to fast proliferation of cervix cancer cells. Lanbein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>] found that strong TKTL1 protein expression was correlated to invasive colon and urothelial tumours and to poor patient outcome. Staiger [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>] demonstrated that TKTL1 upregulation is a common phenomenon in gastric cancer and cancer of the gastroesophageal junction. F&#x000f6;ldi indicated that TKTL1 expression in 86% of breast cancer specimens with 45% showing high expression levels. Langbein[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>] demonstrated that Transketolase was more elevated in metastasizing renal cell cancer and TKTL1 protein was significantly overexpressed in progressing renal cell cancer. Our previous study revealed that TKTL1 play an important role in cell proliferation of colon cancer, hepatoma and nasopharyngeal carcinoma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. These results indicated that TKTL1 could be seen as a potential target for novel anti-transketolase cancer therapies.</p><p>In a word, TKTL1 plays an important role in total transketolase activity and proliferation of tumor cells in uterine cervix cancer. After the expression of TKTL1 was silenced, the proliferation of uterine cervix cancer cells was significantly inhibited; there was no significant change in normal cervical epithelial cells. We think that the most effective way to inhibit tumor proliferation should be to block the generation of energy or nucleic acids for tumor growth. So, we believe TKTL1 gene might become a novel hot spot of study in anticancer therapy.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>HC carried out the cell proliferation assay and drafted the manuscript.
