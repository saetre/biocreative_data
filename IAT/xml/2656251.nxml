Two isoforms have been identified: hematopoietic- and lipocalin-type PGDS (H-PGDS and L-PGDS, respectively). The aims of this study were to investigate the expressions of H-PGDS and L-PGDS in cartilage from healthy donors and from patients with osteoarthritis (OA) and to characterize their regulation by interleukin-1-beta (IL-1&#x003b2;) in cultured OA chondrocytes.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p>The expressions of H-PGDS and L-PGDS mRNA and protein in cartilage were analyzed by real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and immunohistochemistry, respectively.

Treatment of chondrocytes with IL-1&#x003b2; upregulated L-PGDS mRNA and protein expressions as well as PGD<sub>2 </sub>production in a dose- and time-dependent manner.

In contrast, an inhibitor of the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK/MAPK) (PD98059) demonstrated no significant influence.

These data suggest that L-PGDS might have an important role in the pathophysiology of OA.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Introduction</title><p>Osteoarthritis (OA) is the most common joint disorder and is a leading cause of disability throughout the world [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. It can cause pain, stiffness, swelling, and loss of function in the joints. Pathologically, OA is characterized by progressive degeneration of articular cartilage, synovial inflammation, and subchondral bone remodeling. These processes are thought to be largely mediated through excess production of proinflammatory and catabolic mediators. Among these mediators, interleukin-1-beta (IL-1&#x003b2;) has been demonstrated to be predominantly involved in the initiation and progression of the disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. One mechanism through which IL-1&#x003b2; exerts its effects is by inducing connective tissue cells, including chondrocytes, to produce matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), aggrecanases, reactive oxygen species, and prostaglandins (PGs) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>].</p><p>The biosynthesis of PGs involves multiple enzymatically regulated reactions. The process is initiated through the release of arachidonic acid (AA) from the cell membrane by phospholipases. Subsequently, AA is converted to an intermediate substrate PGH<sub>2 </sub>by the actions of cyclooxygenase (COX). Two distinct isoforms have been identified: COX-1 is constitutively expressed, whereas COX-2 is induced by various stimuli such as proinflammatory cytokines and growth factors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. Once formed by COX-1 or COX-2, the unstable PGH<sub>2 </sub>intermediate is metabolized by specific PG synthase enzymes to generate the classical bioactive PGs, including PGE<sub>2</sub>, PGD<sub>2</sub>, PGF<sub>2</sub>&#x003b1;, PGI<sub>2</sub>, and thromboxane [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>].</p><p>There is a growing body of evidence suggesting that PGD<sub>2 </sub>may have protective effects in OA and possibly other chronic articular diseases. For instance, treatment with PGD<sub>2 </sub>enhances the expression of the cartilage-specific matrix components collagen type II and aggrecan [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>] and prevents chondrocyte apoptosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. In addition, we have recently shown that PGD<sub>2 </sub>inhibits the induction of MMP-1 and MMP-13, which play an important role in cartilage damage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. Thus, PGD<sub>2 </sub>can mediate its chondroprotective effects not only through chondrogenesis enhancement, but also through inhibition of catabolic events. PGD<sub>2 </sub>was also shown to exhibit anti-inflammatory properties. Indeed, increased levels of PGD<sub>2 </sub>are observed during the resolution phase of inflammation and the inflammation is exacerbated by COX inhibitors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. The anti-inflammatory role of PGD<sub>2 </sub>is supported by studies using PGD<sub>2 </sub>synthase-deficient and transgenic mice. The knockout animals show impaired resolution of inflammation, and transgenic animals have little detectable inflammation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. In addition, retroviral delivery of PGD<sub>2 </sub>synthase suppresses inflammatory responses in a murine air-pouch model of monosodium urate monohydrate crystal-induced inflammation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Some effects of PGD<sub>2 </sub>can be mediated by its dehydration end product, 15d-PGJ<sub>2 </sub>(15-deoxy-delta12,14-PGJ<sub>2</sub>), which has been shown to exhibit potent anti-inflammatory and anticatabolic properties [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. PGD<sub>2 </sub>exerts its effects principally by binding and activating two plasma membrane receptors, the D prostanoid receptor (DP) 1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>] and chemoattractant-receptor-like molecule expressed on Th2 cells (CRTH2), also known as DP2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. The effects of the PGD<sub>2 </sub>metabolite 15d-PGJ<sub>2 </sub>are mediated through mechanisms independent of and dependent on nuclear peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma (PPAR&#x003b3;) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>].</p><p>The biosynthesis of PGD<sub>2 </sub>from its precursor PGH<sub>2 </sub>is catalyzed by two PGD synthases (PGDSs): one is gluthatione-independent, the lipocaline-type PGDS (L-PGDS), and the other is glutathione-requiring, the hematopoietic PGDS (H-PGDS) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. L-PGDS (also called &#x003b2;-trace) is expressed abundantly in the central nervous system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>], the heart [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>], the retina [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>], and the genital organs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. H-PGDS is expressed mainly in mast cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>], megakaryocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>], and T-helper 2 lymphocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. So far, little is known about the expression and regulation of L-PGDS and H-PGDS in cartilage. To better understand the role of PGD<sub>2 </sub>in the joint, we investigated the expressions of H-PGDS and L-PGDS in healthy and OA cartilage. Moreover, we explored the effect of IL-1&#x003b2;, a key cytokine in the pathogenesis of OA, on L-PGDS expression in cultured chondrocytes.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Reagents</title><p>Recombinant human IL-1&#x003b2; was obtained from Genzyme (Cambridge, MA, USA).

To ensure that only healthy tissue was used, cartilage specimens were thoroughly examined both macroscopically and microscopically. OA cartilage and synovial fluids were obtained from patients undergoing total knee replacement (n = 32, mean &#x000b1; SD age of 67 &#x000b1; 16 years). All OA patients were diagnosed on criteria developed by the American College of Rheumatology Diagnostic Subcommittee for OA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. At the time of surgery, the patients had symptomatic disease requiring medical treatment in the form of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs or selective COX-2 inhibitors. Patients who had received intra-articular injections of steroids were excluded. The Clinical Research Ethics Committee of Notre-Dame Hospital (Montreal, QC, Canada) approved the study protocol and the informed consent form.</p><p>Chondrocytes were released from cartilage by sequential enzymatic digestion as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. Briefly, this consisted of 2 mg/mL pronase for 1 hour followed by 1 mg/mL collagenase for 6 hours (type IV; Sigma-Aldrich Canada) at 37&#x000b0;C in DMEM and antibiotics (100 U/mL penicillin and 100 &#x003bc;g/mL streptomycin). The digested tissue was briefly centrifuged and the pellet was washed. The isolated chondrocytes were seeded at high density in tissue culture flasks and cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated FCS. At confluence, the chondrocytes were detached, seeded at high density, and allowed to grow in DMEM, supplemented as above. The culture medium was changed every second day, and 24 hours before the experiment, the cells were incubated in fresh medium containing 0.5% FCS. Only first-passaged chondrocytes were used.</p></sec><sec><title>RNA extraction and reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction</title><p>Total RNA from homogenized cartilage or stimulated chondrocytes was isolated using the TRIzol<sup>&#x000ae; </sup>reagent (Invitrogen) in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions. To remove contaminating DNA, isolated RNA was treated with RNase-free DNase I (Ambion, Inc., Austin, TX, USA). The RNA was quantitated using the RiboGreen RNA quantitation kit (Molecular Probes, Inc., now part of Invitrogen Corporation, Carlsbad, CA, USA), dissolved in diethylpyrocarbonate (DEPC)-treated H<sub>2</sub>O, and stored at -80&#x000b0;C until use. One microgram of total RNA was reverse-transcribed using Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (RT) (Fermentas, Burlington, ON, Canada), as detailed in the manufacturer's guidelines. One fiftieth of the RT reaction was analyzed by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) as described below. The following primers were used: L-PGDS [GeneBank: <ext-link ext-link-type="gen" xlink:href="NM000954">NM000954</ext-link>], sense 5'-AACCAGTGTGAGACCCGAAC-3', antisense 5'-AGGCGGTGAATTTCTCCTTT-3'; H-PGDS [GeneBank: <ext-link ext-link-type="gen" xlink:href="NM014485">NM014485</ext-link>], sense 5'-CCCCATTTTGGAAGTTGATG-3', antisense 5'-TGAGGCGCATTATACGTGAG-3; and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) [GeneBank: <ext-link ext-link-type="gen" xlink:href="NM002046">NM002046</ext-link>], sense 5'-CAGAACATCATCCCTGCCTCT-3', antisense 5'-GCTTGACAAAGTGGTCGTTGAG-3'.</p><p>Quantitative PCR analysis was performed in a total volume of 50 &#x003bc;L containing template DNA, 200 nM of sense and antisense primers, 25 &#x003bc;L of SYBR<sup>&#x000ae; </sup>Green master mix (Qiagen, Mississauga, ON, Canada), and uracil-<italic>N</italic>-glycosylase (UNG) (0.5 units; Epicentre Biotechnologies, Madison, WI, USA). After incubation at 50&#x000b0;C for 2 minutes (UNG reaction) and at 95&#x000b0;C for 10 minutes (UNG inactivation and activation of the AmpliTaq Gold enzyme; Qiagen), the mixtures were subjected to 40 amplification cycles (15 seconds at 95&#x000b0;C for denaturation and 1 minute for annealing and extension at 60&#x000b0;C). Incorporation of SYBR<sup>&#x000ae; </sup>Green dye into PCR products was monitored in real time using a GeneAmp 5700 Sequence detection system (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA), allowing the determination of the threshold cycle (C<sub>T</sub>) at which exponential amplification of PCR products begins. After PCR, dissociation curves were generated with one peak, indicating the specificity of the amplification. A C<sub>T </sub>value was obtained from each amplification curve using the software provided by the manufacturer (Applied Biosystems).</p><p>Relative amounts of mRNA in healthy and OA cartilage were determined using the standard curve method. Serial dilutions of internal standards (plasmids containing cDNA of target genes) were included in each PCR run, and standard curves for the target gene and for <italic>GAPDH </italic>were generated by linear regression using log (C<sub>T</sub>) versus log (cDNA relative dilution). The C<sub>T </sub>values were then converted to number of molecules. Relative mRNA expression in cultured chondrocytes was determined using the &#x00394;&#x00394;C<sub>T </sub>method, as detailed in the guidelines of the manufacturer (Applied Biosystems). A &#x00394;C<sub>T </sub>value was first calculated by subtracting the C<sub>T </sub>value for the housekeeping gene <italic>GAPDH </italic>from the C<sub>T </sub>value for each sample. A &#x00394;&#x00394;C<sub>T </sub>value was then calculated by subtracting the &#x00394;C<sub>T </sub>value of the control (unstimulated cells) from the &#x00394;C<sub>T </sub>value of each treatment. Fold changes compared with the control were then determined by raising 2 to the -&#x00394;&#x00394;C<sub>T </sub>power. Each PCR generated only the expected specific amplicon as shown by the melting-temperature profiles of the final product and by gel electrophoresis of test PCRs. Each PCR was performed in triplicate on two separate occasions for each independent experiment.</p></sec><sec><title>Immunohistochemistry</title><p>Cartilage specimens were processed for immunohistochemistry as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. The specimens were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde and embedded in paraffin. Sections (5 &#x003bc;m) of paraffin-embedded specimens were deparaffinized in toluene and were dehydrated in a graded series of ethanol. The specimens were then preincubated with chondroitinase ABC (0.25 U/mL in phosphate-buffered saline [PBS] pH 8.0) for 60 minutes at 37&#x000b0;C, followed by a 30-minute incubation with Triton X-100 (0.3%) at room temperature. Slides were then washed in PBS followed by 2% hydrogen peroxide/methanol for 15 minutes. They were further incubated for 60 minutes with 2% healthy serum (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA, USA) and overlaid with primary antibody for 18 hours at 4&#x000b0;C in a humidified chamber. The antibody was a rabbit polyclonal anti-human L-PGDS (United States Biological Inc., Swampscott, MA, USA), used at 10 &#x003bc;g/mL. Each slide was washed three times in PBS pH 7.4 and stained using the avidin-biotin complex method (Vectastain ABC kit; Vector Laboratories). The colour was developed with 3,3'-diaminobenzidine (DAB) (Vector Laboratories) containing hydrogen peroxide. The slides were counterstained with eosin. The specificity of staining was evaluated by using antibody that had been preadsorbed (1 hour at 37&#x000b0;C) with a 20-fold molar excess of recombinant human L-PGDS (Cayman Chemical Company) and by substituting the primary antibody with nonimmune rabbit IgG (Chemicon International, Temecula, CA, USA), used at the same concentration as the primary antibody. The evaluation of positive-staining chondrocytes was performed using our previously published method [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. For each specimen, six microscopic fields were examined under &#x000d7; 40 magnification. The total number of chondrocytes and the number of chondrocytes staining positive were evaluated, and the results were expressed as the percentage of chondrocytes staining positive (cell score).</p></sec><sec><title>Western blot analysis</title><p>Chondrocytes were lysed in ice-cold lysis buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 2 mM EDTA [ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid], 1 mM PMSF [phenylmethylsulphonyl fluoride], 10 &#x003bc;g/mL each of aprotinin, leupeptin, and pepstatin, 1% NP-40, 1 mM Na<sub>3</sub>VO<sub>4</sub>, and 1 mM NaF). Lysates were sonicated on ice and centrifuged at 12,000 revolutions per minute for 15 minutes.

Twenty micrograms of total cell lysate was subjected to SDS-PAGE and electrotransferred to a nitrocellulose membrane (Bio-Rad Laboratories). After blocking in 20 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5 containing 150 mM NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20, and 5% (wt/vol) nonfat dry milk, blots were incubated overnight at 4&#x000b0;C with the primary antibody and washed with a Tris buffer (Tris-buffered saline pH 7.5 with 0.1% Tween 20). The blots were then incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (Pierce), washed again, incubated with SuperSignal Ultra Chemiluminescent reagent (Pierce), and, finally, exposed to Kodak X-Omat film (Eastman Kodak Company, Rochester, NY, USA). Bands on the films were scanned using the imaging system Chemilmager 4000 (Alpha Innotech Corporation, San Leandro, CA, USA), and the intensity of the L-PGDS bands was normalized by dividing them by the intensity of the &#x003b2;-actin band of the corresponding sample.</p></sec><sec><title>11&#x003b2;-PGF<sub>2</sub>&#x003b1; and PGD<sub>2 </sub>assays</title><p>The levels of 11&#x003b2;-PGF2&#x003b1; in hyaluronidase-treated synovial fluids and of PGD<sub>2 </sub>in chondrocyte supernatants were determined using competitive enzyme immunoassays from Cayman Chemical Company.

The proinflammatory cytokine IL-1&#x003b2; upregulated, whereas PGD<sub>2 </sub>downregulated, the expression of L-PGDS in cultured chondrocytes. These findings suggest that L-PGDS may be implicated in the pathogenesis of OA.</p><p>In healthy cartilage, L-PGDS immunostaining was located in only a few cells in the superficial and middle zones. By contrast, in OA cartilage, the cell score was significantly higher, particularly in cartilage areas showing significant damage (fibrillation). Given the anti-inflammatory and anticatabolic roles of PGD<sub>2</sub>, it is reasonable to speculate that the upregulation of L-PGDS may act as a sort of chondroprotective mechanism. Increased expression of L-PGDS was described in other diseases such as atherosclerosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>], multiple sclerosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>], diabetes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>] essential hypertension [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>], and Tay-Sachs and Sandhoff diseases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>]. Thus, L-PGDS expression is upregulated in many pathologies.</p><p>The enhanced expression of L-PGDS in the superficial and middle zones of cartilage could potentially be due to the increased level of the proinflammatory cytokine IL-1&#x003b2; in these zones. Indeed, IL-1&#x003b2;, which plays pivotal roles in the initiation and progression of OA, has been shown to accumulate in these zones [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>]. To prove this hypothesis, we performed cell culture experiments. Our results revealed that exposure to IL-1&#x003b2; led to a time- and concentration-dependent upregulation of L-PGDS expression and PGD<sub>2 </sub>production. The upregulation of L-PGDS expression by IL-1&#x003b2; was blocked by CHX, suggesting that this effect of IL-1&#x003b2; requires <italic>de novo </italic>protein synthesis and would be consistent with an indirect stimulatory mechanism.</p><p>The delayed induction of L-PGDS by IL-1&#x003b2; in chondrocytes is consistent with the recently reported anti-inflammatory and anticatabolic properties of PGD<sub>2</sub>. Indeed, the production of PGD<sub>2 </sub>is markedly elevated during the resolution of inflammation in carrageenan-induced pleurisy in rats, and exogenous PGD<sub>2 </sub>significantly reduces neutrophil levels in the inflammatory exudates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. Enhanced production of PGD<sub>2 </sub>was also described during the resolution phase of the wound-healing process [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>]. Cipollone and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>] examined the expression of L-PGDS in atherosclerotic arteries and found lower expression of L-PGDS and higher expression of microsomal prostaglandin E synthase-1 (mPGES-1) in symptomatic plaques and found higher expression of L-PGDS and lower expression of mPGES-1 in asymptomatic ones. This suggests that the balance between PGD<sub>2 </sub>and PGE<sub>2 </sub>contributes to the pathology of atherosclerosis and that a shift toward PGD<sub>2 </sub>synthesis may have an anti-inflammatory role. This is supported by the observation that increased biosynthesis of PGD<sub>2 </sub>is associated with reduced production of PGE<sub>2 </sub>in several <italic>in vitro </italic>studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>]. Recently, two separate studies demonstrated anti-inflammatory properties of PGD<sub>2 </sub>in an air-pouch model of inflammation induced by monosodium urate monohydrate crystals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>]. Moreover, H-PGDS knockout mice fail to resolve a delayed-type hypersensitivity reaction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. In addition to its anti-inflammatory effects, PGD<sub>2 </sub>was shown to induce the expression of collagen type II and aggrecan [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>], to prevent apoptosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>], and to inhibit the induction of MMP-1 and MMP-13 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>] in chondrocytes. Together, these data and those from the present study favour the hypothesis that the upregulation of L-PGDS expression in chondrocytes may be part of a negative feedback control of inflammatory and catabolic responses activated by IL-1&#x003b2; in the joint.</p><p>The production of PGD<sub>2 </sub>by chondrocytes is of particular interest since PGD<sub>2 </sub>is readily converted to 15d-PGJ<sub>2</sub>, a potent antiarthritic agent [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. 15dPGJ<sub>2 </sub>downregulates the expression of a number of inflammatory and catabolic mediators involved in the pathogenesis of OA, including IL-1&#x003b2;, tumour necrosis factor-alpha, inducible nitric-oxide synthase, and MMPs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. Moreover, many <italic>in vivo </italic>studies support a protective effect of 15d-PGJ<sub>2 </sub>and other PPAR&#x003b3; ligands in experimental animal models of OA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">53</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">54</xref>]. Thus, the increased expression of L-PGDS can lead to the production of a PPAR&#x003b3; ligand in the joint. In contrast to classical PGs, which induce their effects through binding to cell surface G protein-coupled receptors, 15d-PGJ<sub>2 </sub>induces most of its effects through the nuclear receptor PPAR&#x003b3;. We have previously shown that PPAR&#x003b3; expression is reduced in OA cartilage and that IL-1&#x003b2; downregulates its expression in chondrocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>], which may interfere with the protective effect of the PGD<sub>2 </sub>metabolite 15d-PGJ<sub>2</sub>. Therefore, the increased expression of L-PGDS observed in our study may represent a compensatory mechanism to counter the reduced expression of PPAR&#x003b3; in OA and to limit local inflammatory and catabolic responses. Also, it should be noted that 15d-PGJ<sub>2 </sub>can induce many of its effects independently of PPAR&#x003b3; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. In addition, PGD<sub>2 </sub>can directly exert protective effects in OA before being metabolized into 15d-PGJ<sub>2</sub>. Indeed, we have recently demonstrated that human chondrocytes express functional DP1 and CRTH-2 and that PGD<sub>2 </sub>downregulates MMP-1 and MMP-13 expressions through activation of the DP1 pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>].</p><p>To elucidate the mechanisms by which IL-1&#x003b2; upregulates L-PGDS expression, we evaluated the roles played by downstream signalling cascades using specific pharmacological inhibitors. We found that JNK and p38 MAPK inhibitors blocked IL-1&#x003b2;-induced L-PGDS upregulation, whereas an inhibitor of the ERK MAPK was without effect. We also found that NF-&#x003ba;B blockade caused a significant decrease in IL-1&#x003b2;-induced upregulation of L-PGDS protein expression. These findings support the hypothesis that the JNK and p38 MAPKs as well as the NF-&#x003ba;B pathways are involved in the upregulation of L-PGDS expression by IL-1&#x003b2;. Our results are concordant with previous reports that implicate activation of MAPKs (JNK and p38) and NF-&#x003ba;B in the upregulation of L-PGDS in leptomeningel cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B55">55</xref>], endothelial cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B56">56</xref>], and macrophages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B57">57</xref>]. The activation of JNK and p38 MAPK and of NF-&#x003ba;B pathways in chondrocytes has been shown to cause activation of their downstream transcription factors, including activation protein-1 (AP-1) and NF-&#x003ba;B [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. Interestingly, the promoter region of the human L-PGDS contains binding sites for NF-&#x003ba;B and AP-1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B55">55</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B56">56</xref>]. Therefore, one could speculate that upregulation of L-PGDS expression by IL-1&#x003b2; could be mediated by AP-1 and NF-&#x003ba;B. Our results also demonstrate that the Notch signalling pathway positively contributes to IL-1&#x003b2;-induced L-PGDS expression in chondrocytes because DAPT, a Notch signalling inhibitor, blocked this process. These findings contrast with previous data showing that the Notch pathway downregulates L-PGDS expression in the brain-derived TE671 cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]. The reasons for these discrepancies are presently unclear but are most likely due to cell-type differences or to differences in experimental conditions.</p><p>We also found that PGD<sub>2 </sub>inhibits IL-1&#x003b2;-induced L-PGDS expression. These results suggest that PGD<sub>2 </sub>may exert a negative feedback mechanism to downregulate L-PGDS expression and activity. Given that the levels of L-PGDS are elevated in OA cartilage and that IL-1&#x003b2; upregulated its expression in chondrocytes, it is possible that the IL-1&#x003b2; effect prevails over that of PGD<sub>2 </sub><italic>in vivo </italic>during advanced stages of the disease. Indeed, the OA cartilage specimens used in this study were from donors with long-established OA. Further studies are clearly warranted to determine the expression profile of L-PGDS over the course of OA in animal models of the disease.</p><p>The concentrations of PGD<sub>2 </sub>used to suppress IL-1&#x003b2;-induced L-PGDS expression are likely to be much higher than those produced in synovial fluids. However, it should be noted that, like other eicosanoids, PGD<sub>2 </sub>functions as an autocrine and paracrine molecule and can readily reach pharmacological levels in the microenvironment of cells that produce it.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Our study has demonstrated for the first time that L-PGDS is upregulated in OA cartilage. The proinflammatory cytokine IL-1&#x003b2; may be responsible for this upregulation via a mechanism that seems to involve the activation of the JNK and p38 MAPK and NF-&#x003ba;B signalling pathways.
