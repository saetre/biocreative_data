These new cells are born in the subventricular zone and migrate to the OB via the rostral migratory stream (RMS). To examine the role of the prokineticin receptor 2 (Prokr2) in neurogenesis, we created a Prokr2 null mouse, and report a decrease in the volume of its OB and also a decrease in the number of bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU)-positive cells. There is disrupted architecture of the OB, with the glomerular layer containing terminal dUTP nick-end labeling (TUNEL) -positive nuclei and also a decrease in tyrosine hydroxylase-positive neurons in this layer. In addition, there are increased numbers of doublecortin-positive neuroblasts in the RMS and increased PSA-NCAM (polysialylated form of the neural cell adhesion molecule) -positive neuronal progenitors around the olfactory ventricle, indicating their detachment from homotypic chains is compromised. Finally, in support of this, Prokr2-deficient cells expanded <italic>in vitro</italic> as neurospheres are incapable of migrating towards a source of recombinant human prokineticin 2 (PROK2). Together, these findings suggest an important role for Prokr2 in OB neurogenesis.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>neural progenitor</kwd><kwd>olfactory bulb</kwd><kwd>prokineticin receptor 2</kwd><kwd>rostral migratory stream</kwd><kwd>subventricular zone</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Introduction</title><p>It is well established that there are two main areas where neurogenesis occurs in the adult mammalian brain, the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus and the olfactory bulb (OB; for reviews, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">Gould <italic>et al</italic>., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">Alvarez-Buylla &#x00026; Garcia-Verdugo, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">Watts <italic>et al</italic>., 2005</xref>).

This study has directly addressed the importance of Prokr2 signalling in this process, by generating a null mutation. One of the most striking effects in the CNS of the Prokr2 null mice was a marked decrease in the size of the OB, as has been previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">Matsumoto <italic>et al</italic>., 2006</xref>). In addition, the layering of the OB was abnormal, the six well-described layers: nerve, glomerular, external plexiform, mitral, internal plexiform and granular were not all present. In fact, the glomerular, mitral and internal plexiform layers were all anatomically indiscernible. In addition to distorted morphology, there is also a significant decrease in the A16 group of dopamine neurons in Prokr2 null mice, as evidenced by a significant reduction in TH-positive neurons in the periglomerular layer. Indeed, it has previously been shown that TH is not expressed on these cells until they reach their final destination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">McLean &#x00026; Shipley, 1988</xref>). Interestingly, the location of another population of calbindin-positive interneurons, that are preferentially found in the GL, with a smaller proportion in the granule cell layer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">Hwang <italic>et al</italic>., 2002</xref>) was distorted in the Prokr2 null mice. In these mice the neurons appeared relatively immature and were found throughout the OB and not concentrated in the GL as in their wild-type littermates. Therefore, their reduced numbers may be due to fewer reaching their final destination, combined with evidence of TUNEL-positive apoptotic nuclei in the vicinity of this distorted layer. It is plausible that both phenomena contribute to a reduction in these interneurons in this region. Indeed, Prok2 has been shown to protect cells derived from the corpus luteum against apoptotic cell death due to serum starvation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">Kisliouk <italic>et al</italic>., 2005</xref>).</p><p>A marked deficiency in OB development has previously been reported in the Prokr2 null mice as early as E16.5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">Matsumoto <italic>et al</italic>., 2006</xref>) and P1 (M.A.C., unpublished observations), suggesting that Prokr2 is critical for the normal development of the OB. It is of interest that in <italic>Prok2</italic> knockout mice asymmetric OB malformation was reported in approximately 50% of the mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">Ng <italic>et al</italic>., 2005</xref>), whereas we and others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">Matsumoto <italic>et al</italic>., 2006</xref>) found symmetrical OB malformation in all of our Prokr2 null mice. Moreover, the degree of organization in the OB of Prok2 null mice appears to vary with the mitral cell layers being discernable in some but absent from other OB lobes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">Ng <italic>et al</italic>., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">Zhang <italic>et al</italic>., 2007</xref>) These observations suggest that the Prokr2 null OB phenotype is more extensive than that for its ligand Prok2 and confirms the critical role of this receptor for OB neurogenesis. In contrast, the more organized structures of the OB in Prok2 nulls suggest that loss of the ligand can be partially compensated by alternative mechanisms. However, the lack of <italic>Prok1</italic> mRNA expression detected in the OB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">Cheng <italic>et al</italic>., 2006</xref>) raises doubt over whether it can functionally substitute for Prok2 in the null mutant.</p><p>Tbrain-1 (Tbr-1) and the lysophosphatidic acid receptor (LpA1) null mutant phenotypes, although mechanistically different, do share some of the features of defective OB with the Prokr2 phenotype described here. Null mutants for the Brachyuri homologue <italic>Tbr</italic>-<italic>1</italic> are deficient in OB mitral and tufted cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">Bulfone <italic>et al</italic>., 1998</xref>), whereas the <italic>LpA1</italic> null mice exhibit a probable deficit in neuronal progenitor proliferation and a partially penetrant reduction in OB wall thickness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">Contos <italic>et al</italic>., 2000</xref>). It is of interest that null mutants for <italic>Tbr-1</italic> and <italic>LpA1</italic> with deformed OB are deficient in suckling ability contributing to postnatal lethality. Similarly, the Prok2 and Prokr2 nulls exhibit partial penetrant lethality that might be caused by olfactory deficits compromising suckling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">Li <italic>et al</italic>., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">Matsumoto <italic>et al</italic>., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">Prosser <italic>et al</italic>., 2007</xref>). However, even in C57BL/6 backcrossed mice where the penetrance of postnatal lethality is almost complete, Prokr2 null mice do have milk in their stomachs. This suggests that olfactory impairment of suckling ability is unlikely to be the critical factor in Prokr2 null postnatal lethality.</p><p>Cell division in the SVZ is responsible for new neurons being added to the granular and the periglomerular layers of the OB. These cells migrate through the RMS, where the majority disperse throughout the granule layer and a small percentage develop into interneurons in the periglomerular layer. However, in the Prokr2 null mice the volume of the OB is approximately fourfold less than wild-type littermates, and the cell numbers reaching the OB are reduced by about threefold. This is not due to a decrease in cell division in the SVZ as no deficiency was noted in Prokr2 nulls. Instead it is their migration that is compromised as they are being retained within the RMS and fail to migrate from there out into the granular layer of the OB. This results in a deficit in differentiated granule cells and is likely to be responsible for the marked reduction in the size of the OB and its distorted architecture. This would suggest that the lack of Prokr2 might abolish Prok2 signalling, which acts as a detachment signal for chain migrating progenitors arriving from the RMS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">Ng <italic>et al</italic>., 2005</xref>). Further support for this comes from the increased accumulation and tighter clustering of PSA-NCAM-positive neuronal progenitors around the olfactory ventricle of Prokr2 null mice relative to wild-type controls. In addition, DCX-positive neuronal progenitors accumulated in the RMS, representing a higher percentage of cells than in wild-type littermates. The evidence we present here that Prokr2 activation is essential for the migration and differentiation of neuronal progenitors is similar to the OB phenotype of Mash1 null mutants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">Murray <italic>et al</italic>., 2003</xref>). Interestingly, it has recently been reported that the expression of Mash1 and neurogenin1 (Ngn1) overlap with Prok2 in several neuronal populations of the OB, and that Prok2 is decreased by 70% in Ngn1 null mice at P0 and 50% in Mash1 null mice at E16.5 compared with their respective wild-type littermates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">Zhang <italic>et al</italic>., 2007</xref>). In addition, both of these basic-helix-loop-helix transcription factors are proposed to regulate Prok2 expression, and ChiP assays have shown binding to the Prok2 promoter E-box motifs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">Zhang <italic>et al</italic>., 2007</xref>). This would suggest that Prok2 may mediate a functional role for both Mash1 and Ngn1 in OB neurogenesis.</p><p>Quantitative evidence for the critical role of Prokr2 and the lack of redundancy in the prokineticin receptors in mediating chemoattraction by prokineticins was provided by transwell migration experiments where SVZ cells from Prokr2 null mice demonstrated insignificant PROK2-dependent migration relative to wild-type explants in the absence of chemoattractant. This supports the morphological examination of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">Matsumoto <italic>et al</italic>. (2006)</xref> showing that exclusively Prokr2 and not Prokr1 knockouts display an OB phenotype.</p><p>The phenotypes of <italic>Prokr2</italic> and <italic>Prok2</italic> knockout mice model aspects of human Kallman syndrome (KS), a partially penetrant genetic disease that causes OB deformity and consequently anosomia and hypogonadism with associated sterility and failure to reach puberty (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">Ng <italic>et al</italic>., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">Matsumoto <italic>et al</italic>., 2006</xref>). It is likely that the reproductive disorders are caused primarily by the absence of neurons producing gonadotrophin-releasing hormone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">Schwanzel-Fukuda <italic>et al</italic>., 1989</xref>), as is the case in the Prokr2 null mouse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">Matsumoto <italic>et al</italic>., 2006</xref>). Approximately 20% of KS cases are caused by loss of function mutations in either the X-linked <italic>KAL1</italic> gene, that encodes anosmin-1, or the fibroblast growth factor receptor 1 gene (<italic>FGFR1</italic>), responsible for an autosomal dominant form of the disease. It was recently established that mutations within <italic>PROK2</italic> (heterozygous) and <italic>PROKR2</italic>(homozygous, heterozygous or compound heterozygous) are present within 10% of a cohort of patients with KS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">Dode <italic>et al</italic>., 2006</xref>). Thus, a deficiency in PROKR2 signalling is a likely cause of KS in some patients. The presence of heterozygous mutations within the <italic>PROKR2</italic> and <italic>PROK2</italic> genes of patients with KS suggests that either partial PROKR2 signalling impairment is sufficient to cause the KS on its own or that inheritance of the disorder is dependent upon mutations in additional genes involved in the same, or convergent, signalling pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">Dode <italic>et al</italic>., 2006</xref>).</p><p>In conclusion, we show that normal functioning of Prokr2 is necessary for the migration of homotypic chains of neuroblasts through the RMS and their detachment prior to their arrival at their final destination in either the granule or GL of the OB. Through this mechanism this G-protein-coupled receptor is crucial for establishment of the normal layered structure and ongoing neurogenesis of the OB.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank E.
