Matrix metalloproteinases play an essential role in degrading and remodeling the ECM. In this study, we tried to show the presence and correlation of promatrix metalloproteinase-3 (proMMP-3) (the inactive form of metalloproteinase-3) levels in coal workers' pneumoconiosis (CWP) with different categories. The study population consisted of 44 coal miners with CWP (pos CWP). Coal miners without CWP (neg CWP, n = 24) and non-underground personnel (controls, n = 17) were taken as controls. All coal miners were stable and had no systemic infection or disease. Standard posterio-anterior chest radiographs and pulmonary function tests were performed to exclude any diseases other than CWP. Serum proMMP-3 was analysed using the sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay according to the manufacturer's instructions (The Binding Site, Birmingham, UK). Mean proMMP-3 values of the all three groups were compared and a significant statistical difference obtained (p &#x0003c; 0.001). In addition, a statistically significant difference was found between categories of the disease and proMMP-3 values (p &#x0003c; 0.05). The effects of age, exposure duration and cigarette smoking on proMMP-3 values in coal miners with CWP were investigated. There were no correlations between age, smoking and proMMP-3 values. However, a positive correlation was found between exposure duration and proMMP-3 values (r = 0.447, p = 0.008). In conclusion, proMMP-3 (prostromelysin 1) may play an essential role in degrading and remodeling the ECM in workers with pneumoconiosis. ProMMP-3 may also reflect the stage of pneumoconiosis disease.</p></abstract></article-meta></front></article>
