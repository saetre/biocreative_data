We have designed a new strain of <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> (JE28) by an in-frame fusion of a nucleotide sequence encoding a hexa-histidine affinity tag at the 3&#x02032;-end of the single copy <italic>rplL</italic> gene (encoding the ribosomal protein L12) at the chromosomal site of the wild-type strain MG1655. As a result, JE28 produces a homogeneous population of ribosomes (His)<sub>6</sub>-tagged at the C-termini of all four L12 proteins. Furthermore, we have developed a single-step, high-throughput method for purification of tetra-(His)<sub>6</sub>-tagged 70S ribosomes from this strain using affinity chromatography. These ribosomes, when compared with the conventionally purified ones in sucrose gradient centrifugation, 2D-gel, dipeptide formation and a full-length protein synthesis assay showed higher yield and activity. We further describe how this method can be adapted for purification of ribosomal subunits and mutant ribosomes. These methodologies could, in principle, also be used to purify any functional multimeric complex from the bacterial cell.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>The ribosome, comprising at least 50 proteins and three RNAs (5S, 16S and 23S), is the largest macromolecular assembly of the bacterial cell. Recent breakthroughs in the structural studies with bacterial ribosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1 B2 B3">1&#x02013;3</xref>), have shifted the major emphasis of the ribosome field towards further elucidation of the structure&#x02013;function relationships. At the same time there is a growing interest in the cell-free system reconstituted from the components of the cellular transcription&#x02013;translation machinery for the custom synthesis and window labeling of proteins and peptides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>), which has ribosome as the major component. Most of these studies rely on the purification of active ribosomes from the bacterial cells, more specifically from <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>, which is most widely used for the basic research on bacterial protein synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>), visualization of ribosomal complexes by cryo-EM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>) and for reconstituted <italic>in vitro</italic> translation systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3 B4 B5">3&#x02013;5</xref>). Conventional method of <italic>E. coli</italic> ribosome purification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>) involves several steps of ultracentrifugation and/or column chromatography, and is therefore quite expensive in terms of time, effort, equipment and reagents. A simple, high-throughput method for purification of functional ribosome from <italic>E. coli</italic> is therefore in demand.</p><p>Affinity-tag-based purification method has revolutionized the protein purification field. Naturally, attempts have been made to purify bacterial, plant and yeast ribosomes using affinity tags (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10 B11 B12 B13 B14 B15">10&#x02013;15</xref>). Two of these methods employed streptavidin-binding aptamer tag (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>) and MS2 coat protein-binding tag (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>) respectively, fused with the rRNA operon on a plasmid. Both of these methods were designed mainly for the purification of <italic>E. coli</italic> ribosome-bearing mutations in the rRNAs. The other methods involved fusion of either Flag-(His)<sub>6</sub> tag (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>) or S-peptide tag (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>) to some ribosomal protein from <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> and <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> respectively, over-expressed from a plasmid. Since all of these methods employ plasmid based over-expression of a ribosomal component fused with the affinity tag the success of these methods depends on the level of over-expression and also on the efficiency of assembly of the over-expressed tagged component onto the ribosome. The yield of the tagged ribosomes in these cases varies from 4% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>) to 40% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>). Another standing problem of these systems is that the tagged protein or the RNA component, over-expressed from the plasmids, is usually produced in huge excess over the ribosomes, thus demanding additional purification steps for their separation. Therefore, a more efficient and high-yield system for affinity-tag-based purification of the active bacterial ribosomes was somewhat lacking and needed to be developed. Also, from the perspective of the bacterial physiology the presence of the normal ribosomes together with the tagged ones made the impact of the tag insertion upon <italic>in vivo</italic> translation and growth rate unclear.</p><p>As a solution to the above-mentioned limitations we have constructed a novel <italic>E. coli</italic> strain JE28, in which a (His)<sub>6</sub>-tag has been inserted at the C-terminus of the ribosomal protein L12 engineering directly on the chromosome, using lambda (&#x003bb;) Red recombineering (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>). Since L12 is present in four copies on the large subunit of <italic>E. coli</italic> ribosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>), all ribosomes of JE28 are homogeneously tetra-(His)<sub>6</sub>-tagged. Next, we developed a single-step, affinity chromatography-based, fast and easy method for the purification of the tetra-(His)<sub>6</sub>-tagged ribosomes from this strain, which is essentially identical to the purification of any His-tagged protein. This method can be easily modified for the purification of ribosomal subunits and any mutant <italic>E. coli</italic> ribosome. The JE28 ribosomes purified in this method are characterized and compared with the wild-type ribosomes purified in the conventional way.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Preparation of linear DNA cassette for <italic>&#x003bb;</italic> Red recombineering</title><p>Standard PCR conditions were used to amplify the kanamycin-resistant cassette (<italic>kan</italic>) using pET-24b plasmid (Novagen) as a template and two specially designed primers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>a).

When compared with MG1655, JE28 showed essentially the same growth rate in liquid culture (LB) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>); presence of kanamycin (50 &#x000b5;g/ml) in the medium did not have any effect on it (data not shown). Two important conclusions can be drawn from this result. (i) The targeted insertion at the chromosomal site of the <italic>rplL</italic> gene is stable and does not affect the expression of the genes located downstream on the <italic>rplJL-rpoBC</italic> operon (e.g. <italic>rpoB</italic> coding for RNA polymerase beta, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>b). (ii) The (His)<sub>6</sub>-tags inserted on the C-termini of the L12 proteins have no negative effect on the function of the protein L12 and hence on the ribosomes <italic>in vivo</italic>. This has been tested later <italic>in vitro</italic>. <fig id="F2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><p>Comparison of the growth rates.

The C-terminus of the L12 protein was chosen for this purpose for several reasons. First, L12 is the only ribosomal protein present in multiple copies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>). In <italic>E. coli</italic>, there are four copies of L12 proteins on the 50S subunit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>). Therefore the chromosomal insertion of the nucleotide sequence encoding (His)<sub>6</sub>-tag in the 3&#x02032;-end of the <italic>rplL</italic> gene resulted in four (His)<sub>6</sub>-tags on the JE28 ribosomes, which ensured its stable, specific and strong binding to the affinity matrix (Ni<sup>2+</sup>&#x02013;sepharose pre-packed HisTrap<sup>TM</sup>HP column, GE Healthcare), resulting in very high yield of the ribosomes with high purity. In fact, similar fusion of (His)<sub>6</sub>-tag with three other single copy ribosomal proteins L30, S2 and S3 were also successful, but none of those could yield ribosome of comparable quantity or purity using the same methodology.</p><p>The other reason for the choice of this site for the insertion was mainly structural. The protein L12, consists of three distinguishable domains; namely (i) N-terminal domain (NTD), involved in L12-dimer formation which binds to the C-terminus helix of the L10 protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>), (ii) a globular C-terminal domain (CTD), highly conserved and exposed out of the ribosome, engaged in interactions with the translational factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31 B32 B33">31&#x02013;33</xref>) and (iii) a flexible hinge region connecting these two domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>). Two dimers of the L12 proteins constitute a finger like protrusion from the 50S subunit called the ribosomal &#x02018;stalk&#x02019; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>). Since the C-terminal domains of L12 dimers are in exposed conformation they provide very suitable sites for affinity-tag fusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>), a feature essential for easy accessibility of the affinity tags to the matrix. Moreover, a recent NMR-study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>) has identified the factor-binding site on the L12 CTD, which is not the absolute end of the C-terminus. Therefore the fusion of a small (His)<sub>6</sub>-tag in that site did not interfere with the L12 and hence ribosome function in the &#x02018;stalk&#x02019;&#x02013;factor interactions.</p></sec><sec><title>Affinity purification of tetra-(His)<sub>6</sub>-tagged ribosome from <italic>E. coli</italic> JE28</title><p>A novel method for the purification of tetra-(His)<sub>6</sub>-tagged ribosomes from <italic>E. coli</italic> JE28 is developed using affinity chromatography (see Materials and methods section for details). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>a describes the elution profile of the tetra-(His)<sub>6</sub>-tagged ribosome from the HisTrap<sup>TM</sup>HP column (GE healthcare).

Although the tetra-(His)<sub>6</sub>-tagged ribosomes eluted from the HisTrap<sup>TM</sup>HP column by 150 mM imidazole solution was found to be intact and active, histidine solution was tried as an alternative eluting reagent. When eluted with 100 mM Histidine the ribosome peak was somewhat broader than the imidazole-eluted peak and the yield was about 20% less (data not shown). It is also noteworthy that the rather expensive HisTrap<sup>TM</sup>HP column could not be reused after one time elution with histidine without recharging with Ni<sup>2+</sup>, but for imidazole elution the same column could be used several times.</p></sec><sec><title>Sucrose gradient analysis of the affinity-purified ribosome from <italic>E. coli</italic> JE28</title><p>The JE28 ribosomes purified by the affinity method were subjected to sucrose density-gradient centrifugation analysis together with those purified in the untracentrifugation method (see Materials and methods section).

The exact reason for this difference is not clear, but it resulted in a higher yield of 70S. It is possible that the much faster (1&#x02013;2 h) affinity-purification method with fewer steps offers a relatively gentle treatment to 70S causing less disruption and dissociation of the loosely-coupled subunits, compared to the conventional method, which consumes much longer time (3&#x02013;4 days), and involves several ultracentrifugation steps (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>). Alternatively, it is also possible that during incubation and column-run in the high-Mg<sup>2+</sup> buffer (10 mM), free 30S subunits associated with the 50S subunits fixed with the column matrix to form whole 70S.</p></sec><sec><title>2D-gel analysis of the affinity-purified ribosomes from <italic>E. coli</italic> JE28</title><p>The tetra-(His)<sub>6</sub>-tagged JE28 70S ribosomes purified on a HisTrap<sup>TM</sup>HP column were characterized in a 2D-gel (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>a).

It is worth mentioning that L12 appears as two connected spots on 2D-gel due to its L7 variant, which is the N-terminal acetylated form of L12. There is one additional protein-spot visible in the 2D-gel with JE28 ribosomes. This can be a truncated ribosomal protein.

This method is quite cost effective both in terms of time and reagents, compared to other methods of ribosome purification and therefore can be employed for commercial purposes as well. Since the His-tagged ribosomes from JE28 are highly active in translation they will be useful in analytical functional assays as well as in cell-free protein synthesis systems. A future goal is to develop a continuous-flow cell-free system where His-tagged 50S subunits from JE28 will be fixed on a solid matrix and 30S subunits with all other components will be recycled for continuous production of custom proteins and peptides.</p><p>The tetra-(His)<sub>6</sub>-tagged ribosomes can be used to isolate functional translation complexes bound with translation factors for structural studies by cryo-EM or X-ray crystallography. It is also useful for the purification of <italic>E. coli</italic> ribosomes carrying mutations in essential rRNA or r-protein genes, which usually degrade fast and is therefore difficult to obtain in the conventional method. The affinity tag with the drug marker can be moved from JE28 to the mutant <italic>E. coli</italic> by generalized transduction with bacteriophage P1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>) and then the mutant ribosomes can be purified by affinity chromatography.</p><p>Finally, we propose a general use of this affinity-tag-based purification method. In principle, it can be employed for purification of any macromolecular complex from <italic>E. coli</italic> and other bacteria. In the first step, the sequence encoding an affinity tag is to be inserted at the chromosomal location of a regular component of the complex, preferably well-exposed on the surface and present in multiple copies. Furthermore, this chromosomally fused tag can be used for isolating macromolecular complexes using the simple affinity purification method.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>FUNDING</title><p>This work was supported by research grants from G&#x000f6;ran Gustafsson Stiftelse, LEO Foundation, and Swedish Research Council (Vetenskapsr&#x000e5;det) [621-2006-4530 and 349-2006-267] to S.S., and Vetenskapsr&#x000e5;det grant to S.D.
