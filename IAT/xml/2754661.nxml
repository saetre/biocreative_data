This dynamic nature allows quick adaptation of transcription to changing conditions. However, it is unknown to what extent this dynamic transcription organization holds for postmitotic cells embedded in mammalian tissue. To allow analysis of transcription initiation dynamics directly into living mammalian tissues, we created a knock-in mouse model expressing fluorescently tagged TFIIH. Surprisingly and in contrast to what has been observed in cultured and proliferating cells, postmitotic murine cells embedded in their tissue exhibit a strong and long-lasting transcription-dependent immobilization of TFIIH. This immobilization is both differentiation driven and development dependent. Furthermore, although very statically bound, TFIIH can be remobilized to respond to new transcriptional needs. This divergent spatiotemporal transcriptional organization in different cells of the soma revisits the generally accepted highly dynamic concept of the kinetic framework of transcription and shows how basic processes, such as transcription, can be organized in a fundamentally different fashion in intact organisms as previously deduced from in vitro studies.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><p>The accepted model of eukaryotic mRNA production is that transcription factors spend most of their time diffusing throughout the cell nucleus, encountering gene promoters (their substrate) in a random fashion and binding to them for a very short time. A similar modus operandi has been accepted as a paradigm for interactions within most of the chromatin-associated enzymatic processes (transcription, replication, DNA damage response). However, it is not known whether such behavior is indeed a common characteristic for all cells in the organism. To answer this question, we generated a knock-in mouse that expresses in all cells a fluorescently tagged transcription factor (TFIIH) that functions in both transcription initiation and DNA repair. This new tool, when combined with quantitative imaging techniques, allowed us to monitor the mobility of this transcription factor in virtually all living tissues. In this study, we show that, in contrast to the aforementioned paradigm, in highly differentiated postmitotic cells such as neurons, hepatocytes, and cardiac myocytes, TFIIH is effectively immobilized on the chromatin during transcription, whereas in proliferative cells, TFIIH has the same dynamic behavior as in cultured cells. Our study also points out that results obtained from in vitro or cultured cell systems cannot always be directly extrapolated to the whole organism. More importantly, this raises a question for researchers in the transcription field: why do some cells opt for a dynamic framework for transcription, whereas others exhibit a static one?</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="15"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Basal transcription/repair factor IIH (TFIIH) is a ten-subunit complex <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000220-GigliaMari1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>, essential for both RNA polymerase I and II (RNAP1 and 2) transcription initiation and nucleotide excision repair (NER) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000220-Egly1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>.

To further prove that the transcriptional engagement of TFIIH causes its high immobilization in neurons, we modulated transcription by inducing a cold shock (4&#x000b0;C or 27&#x000b0;C).

To determine that moderate cold shock would indeed inhibit RNAP1 transcription, we measured the amount of pre-rRNA 45S in cold shock&#x02013;treated cells and tissues (organotypic brain cultures). Surprisingly, cold shock did not alter the amount of 45S, either in cultured cells or in organotypic cortex slices (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000220.s009">Figure S9B</xref>). The absence of a reduction of the steady-state-levels of 45S rRNA by either a severe (4&#x000b0;C) or a mild (27&#x000b0;C) cold shock is likely explained by the fact that cold shock also interferes with pre-rRNA maturation or degradation.

In contrast, RNAP1 transcription inhibition induced by actinomycin D (0.1 &#x000b5;g/ml) led to a clear reduction of the amount of pre-rRNA in cultured cells.

Using carefully designed targeted integration of the live-cell marker YFP at the Xpb locus (expressing the TFIIH subunit XPB), we obtained expression of functional YFP-tagged XPB protein under control of the endogenous promoter (guaranteeing physiological expression); we now find evidence for a fundamentally different scenario for the organization of basic transcription initiation in some cell types in the organism. Postmitotic cells (neurons, myocytes, and hepatocytes, etc.) appear to apply a largely static organization of transcription initiation with components being stably bound to chromatin that otherwise in other cell types (fibroblasts, chondrocytes, and keratinocytes, etc.) exchange constantly in a highly dynamic manner. In postmitotic cells, TFIIH is bound to promoters with a much longer residence time than in proliferative cells. A possible explanation for this static behavior is that in these postmitotic terminally differentiated cells, a large part of the transcription program is dedicated to a specific subset of genes defining cellular specialty and housekeeping functions, without the need to continuously switch to transcribed genes that are involved in proliferation (cell cycle, replication, and mitosis, etc.). It is possible that regular replication of the genome in proliferating (cultured) cells and tissues causes a continuous resetting of the transcription regulation machinery after each round of cell division and, in parallel, would involve a more open and accessible chromatin conformation.</p><p>It is generally accepted that differentiation requires and causes a resetting of the transcriptional program by activating and down-regulating specific genes in response to internal and external stimuli, thereby utilizing lineage-specific transcription activators and/or repressors. However, here, we have identified a novel concept of differentiation-dependent spatio-temporal organization of transcription initiation. This concept implies that transcription initiation factors, such as TFIIH, will be bound to promoters much longer in certain cell types than in others (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000220-g006">Figure 6</xref>). Previously, differences in dynamic associations of lineage-specific transcriptional activators <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000220-LaricchiaRobbio1">&#x0005b;50&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000220-Ficz1">&#x0005b;51&#x0005d;</xref> and elongation factors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000220-Yao1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000220-Yao3">&#x0005b;52&#x0005d;</xref> have been linked to activation of transcription. However, the herein described dynamic association of the basal initiation factor TFIIH in neurons, hepatocytes, and myocytes is likely not linked to a higher level of transcription than in, for example, keratinocytes, fibroblasts, or ES cells. We propose a model that the observed low mobility of TFIIH in highly differentiated postmitotic cells is derived form the establishment of a differentiation- and lineage-specific transcriptional program. However, slow mobility of TFIIH is not a general differentiation-dependent phenomenon because in, e.g., fibroblasts, chondrocytes, and keratinocytes, although differentiated, a much higher mobility of TFIIH is present. This observation excludes that this phenomenon is caused by a general change in mobility of histones during ES differentiation, as was previously described <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000220-Meshorer1">&#x0005b;53&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><fig id="pbio-1000220-g006" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pbio.1000220.g006</object-id><label>Figure 6</label><caption><title>Schematic model of TFIIH switch in mobility during differentiation.</title><p>Schematic illustration of the nucleus of a proliferative (left) and a postmitotic (right) cell.

Thus remarkably, the static involvement of TFIIH in transcription initiation does not interfere with the flexibility of cells to change the nuclear organization in response to changing conditions. It is of interest to know how multifunctional factors such as TFIIH are still able to switch from one functional role to another and to relocate to other activity sites despite their virtually immobile nature. Further analysis is required to identify which subroute of NER (global genome NER, transcription-coupled NER, or differentiation-associated repair &#x0005b;DAR&#x0005d; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000220-Nouspikel1">&#x0005b;54&#x0005d;</xref>) is employed to repair genomic injuries in differentiated cells or whether lesions in permanently inactive sequences are repaired at all. The strategy outlined here has allowed us to address how transcription is organized in fully differentiated tissues or organs and during differentiation and development. Insights into these processes at the level of an intact organism are also relevant for a better understanding of the molecular basis of cancer and aging-related pathology.
