Mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) phosphatase (MKP)-1 is the major member of MKPs that dephosphorylates and inactivates MAPK. Here we provide the evidence that MKP-1 was negatively bridging between NF-&#x003ba;B-mediated prosurvival pathway and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK)-mediated proapoptotic response. MKP-1 was induced by &#x003b3;-radiation and repressed radiation-induced pro-apoptotic status. NF-&#x003ba;B RelA/p50 heterodimer was recruited to MKP-1 gene promoter to induce MKP-1 transcription. Deletion of the NF-&#x003ba;B-binding site or inactivation of NF-&#x003ba;B by its small interfering RNA significantly decreased the radiation-induced MKP-1 promoter activity. In addition, MKP-1-deficient mouse embryonic fibroblasts exhibited a prolonged activation of JNK but not p38 or extracellular signal-regulated kinase subfamilies of MAPKs. The prolonged activation of JNK was not induced by treatment with tumor necrosis factor &#x003b1; or interleukin-6, and inactivation of JNK but not p38 or ERK abolished radiation-induced proapoptotic status, indicating that JNK is specifically inhibited by radiation-induced MKP-1. Three MKP-1 wild type human tumor cell lines treated with MKP-1 small interfering RNA showed an increased proapoptotic response that can be rescued by overexpression of wild type mouse MKP-1. Together, these results suggest that MKP-1 is a NF-&#x003ba;B-mediated prosurvival effector in attenuating JNK-mediated pro-apoptotic response; NF-&#x003ba;B/MKP-1-mediated negative JNK regulation represents a potential therapeutic target for adjusting cell radiosensitivity.</p></abstract></article-meta><notes><fn-group><fn id="fn1"><label>*</label><p>This work was supported, in whole or in part, by <grant-sponsor>National Institutes of Health</grant-sponsor> Grant <grant-num>RO1 101990</grant-num> (to J.

The efficacy of this treatment may be severely compromised because of radiation-induced radioresistance with adaptive anti-apoptotic response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref>). Radiation can activate various cellular signal pathways, including MAPKs<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3">2</xref> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref>) and NF-&#x003ba;B pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref>). The interaction between these two pathways have been identified in cells under different stresses, such as treatment of TNF&#x003b1; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref>). However, the mechanism balancing the MAPK-mediated pro-apoptotic and NF-&#x003ba;B-mediated anti-apoptotic pathways in response to radiation remains unclear.</p><p>MAPKs are major signaling transduction molecules in apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref>). In mammals, MAPKs consist of three subfamilies: c-Jun NH<sub>2</sub>-terminal kinases (JNKs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref>), extracellular signal-related kinases (ERKs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref>), and p38 kinases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref>). Although &#x003b3;-radiation can activate JNKs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref>), ERK (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref>), and p38 kinases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref>), it is not clear which subfamily of MAPKs plays a specific role in regulation of the &#x003b3;-radiation-induced pro-apoptotic response. It is generally believed that phosphorylation and dephosphorylation cause activation and inactivation of MAPKs, respectively. Activation of MAPKs can be executed by their upstream dual specific MAPK kinases, which phosphorylate both threonine and tyrosine residues of the T<italic>X</italic>Y motif (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref>). Inactivation of MAPKs is accomplished through dephosphorylation of the two same residues of the T<italic>X</italic>Y motif by MKPs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref>).</p><p>MKPs belong to a family of dual specificity protein phosphatases with 13 members with a function of dephosphorylation of both phosphothreonine and phosphotyrosine residues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref>). MKP-1, as the first defined member of MKPs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">18</xref>), can be rapidly induced in mammalian cells in response to an array of stress stimuli, including oxidative stress and heat shock (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">19</xref>), UV light (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">20</xref>), and DNA-damaging anti-cancer drugs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref22">22</xref>) through transcriptional (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref24">24</xref>) and post-transcriptional mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref26">26</xref>). MKP-1 induction protects cells from stress-induced apoptosis predominantly through negative regulation of MAPK activities.</p><p>The heterodimeric transcription factor NF-&#x003ba;B inhibits cellular apoptotic response and promotes survival in response to radiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref27">27</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref29">29</xref>). In mammals, there are five Rel/NF-&#x003ba;B proteins: RelA (p65), RelB, c-Rel, NF-&#x003ba;B1 (p50 and its precursor p105), and NF-&#x003ba;B2 (p52 and its precursor p100) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref31">31</xref>). In resting cells, NF-&#x003ba;B is retained in the cytoplasm in an inactive form by a tight association with its I&#x003ba;B. Activation of RelA/p50 requires IKK&#x003b2;-dependent degradation of I&#x003ba;Bs, which liberates the RelA&#x000b7;p50 complex from I&#x003ba;Bs and subsequently leads its translocation into the nucleus. The IKK complex contains two catalytic subunits, IKK&#x003b1; and IKK&#x003b2;, and two regulatory subunits, IKK&#x003b3; and ELKS. The classical manner for NF-&#x003ba;B activation mainly depends on the IKK&#x003b2; subunit activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref33">33</xref>). However, it is unknown whether MKP-1 is a target of NF-&#x003ba;Bto mediate pro-survival signaling upon the genotoxic stress with &#x003b3;-radiation.</p><p>Although all of MAPKs, MKP-1, and NF-&#x003ba;B have been implicated in regulation of apoptotic and anti-apoptotic response in DNA-damaging response, their connections in signaling &#x003b3;-radiation-induced apoptosis remain elusive. Here we demonstrate that MKP-1 is the target gene of NF-&#x003ba;B upon &#x003b3;-radiation. MKP-1 activation through NF-&#x003ba;B is specifically required for inhibition of JNK-associated pro-apoptotic response to decrease cell death. Thus, our data reveal a novel anti-apoptosis mechanism by which the NF-&#x003ba;B and MKP-1 pathways cross-talk in response to &#x003b3;-radiation treatment.</p><sec sec-type="methods"><title>EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES</title><p><italic>Cell Lines, Cell Culture, and Treatments</italic>&#x02014;<italic>MKP-1</italic><sup>-/-</sup> (<italic>MKP-1</italic> knock-out) MEFs and paired <italic>MKP-1</italic> wild type (WT) MEFs were kindly provided by Robert Z.

To confirm that MKP-1 negatively mediates the radiation-induced apoptotic response, we measured apoptosis in WT and MKP-1<sup>-/-</sup> MEFs by sorting SubG1 DNA content with flow cytometry analysis and clonogenic radiosensitivity of WT and MKP-1<sup>-/-</sup> MEFs.

Our data showed that although radiation significantly decreased &#x00394;&#x003a8;<sub>m</sub> in both WT and MKP-1<sup>-/-</sup> MEFs, the reduction of &#x00394;&#x003a8;<sub>m</sub> was more profound in MKP-1<sup>-/-</sup> MEFs (75%) than WT MEFs (50%). Importantly, when MKP-1 was reconstituted to MKP-1<sup>-/-</sup> MEFs (MKP-1<sup>-/-</sup>/MKP-1), the &#x00394;&#x003a8;<sub>m</sub> was restored to a level similar to WT MEFs (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1<italic>F</italic></xref>). These results strongly indicate that the loss of MKP-1 function increases the cell radiosensitivity caused by enhanced apoptosis.</p><p><italic>MKP-1 Expression Was Induced by Radiation</italic>&#x02014;To test whether MKP-1 is activated by radiation in normal cells, we measured MKP-1 expression levels in WT MEFs irradiated with 10 Gy of &#x003b3;-rays. The MKP-1 mRNA levels were increased as early as 1 h after radiation and reached the maximum at 4 h post-radiation (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2<italic>A</italic></xref>). Consistent with the radiation-induced MKP-1 mRNA, a substantial amount of MKP-1 protein was also induced by radiation (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2<italic>B</italic></xref>). In contrast, no MKP-1 was induced by radiation in MKP-1<sup>-/-</sup> MEFs, confirming the deficiency of MKP-1 in MKP-1<sup>-/-</sup> cells (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2<italic>B</italic></xref>). These results clearly indicate the inducibility of MKP-1 gene expression under the stress of ionizing radiation. We then studied whether radiation induces MKP-1 expression because of transactivation of MKP-1 gene promoter. We thus constructed and tested mouse MKP-1 promoter luciferase reporter activity. Strikingly, radiation significantly activated the MKP-1 promoter with a similar pattern of time point and level to the induction of MKP-1 mRNA (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2<italic>C</italic></xref>).</p><p>We further studied whether radiation also up-regulates MKP-1 expression in human cells. Similarly to the data obtained from mouse cells, both MKP-1 mRNA and protein levels were significantly induced by radiation in immortalized normal human keratinocytes (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2, <italic>D</italic> and <italic>E</italic></xref>). In addition, we constructed and tested human MKP-1 promoter activity that was also enhanced with a similar pattern as mouse cells by radiation (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2<italic>F</italic></xref>). These results suggest that radiation-induced MKP-1 expression is a common feature in mammalian cells, and MKP-1 may function to increase cell survival by inhibition of apoptosis.</p><p><italic>NF-&#x003ba;B Was Required for Radiation-induced MKP-1 Gene Expression</italic>&#x02014;Because NF-&#x003ba;B is a well documented transcription factor signaling radiation response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref39">39</xref>), we studied whether NF-&#x003ba;B is responsible for radiation-induced MKP-1 expression. Using TFSEARCH program (version 1.3), we found a NF-&#x003ba;B consensus sequence (-1210/-1200) located in the MKP-1 promoter. We next generated a construct with a deletion of the NF-&#x003ba;B-binding site (pGL3-E-MKP-1-&#x00394;NF-&#x003ba;B) (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3<italic>A</italic></xref>) and tested the MKP-1 promoter activity.

As shown in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3<italic>E</italic></xref>, the MKP-1 promoter region (-1362/-1125) encompassing the NF-&#x003ba;B-binding site (-1210/-1200) was clearly immunoprecipitated in radiation-treated HK18 cells with both anti-p65 and p50 antibodies. In contrast, same ChIP setting did not detect the binding by an anti-c-Rel antibody, neither by species-matched and nor by isotype-matched control antibodies. The failure of binding to the MKP-1 promoter region for c-Rel was not due to inefficient ChIP analysis, because all three NF-&#x003ba;B subunits antibodies were immunoprecipitated with a I&#x003ba;B&#x003b1; promoter region, which was included as a positive control. In addition, control fragments of an upstream sequence on the MKP-1 promoter region (-2100/-1800) and the promoter region of GAPDH were not immunoprecipitated. Therefore the highly selective binding of the NF-&#x003ba;B p65/p50 heterodimer to the MKP-1 promoter suggests that a classical IKK&#x003b2;-dependent NF-&#x003ba;B activation regulates radiation-induced MKP-1 activation. These results demonstrate that NF-&#x003ba;Bis specifically recruited to the MKP-1 promoter to stimulate MKP-1 gene expression and thus confirms a new NF-&#x003ba;B target gene in radiation response.</p><p><italic>MKP-1 Selectively Inhibited Radiation-induced Activation of JNK</italic>&#x02014;Because MAPKs are involved in signaling apoptosis and can be inhibited by MKP-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref>), we investigated whether MAPKs are inactivated by MKP-1 upon radiation by measurement of phosphorylation JNK, p38, and ERK in WT and MKP-1<sup>-/-</sup> MEFs with or without radiation. In <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4<italic>A</italic></xref>, phosphorylation of all three subfamilies of MAPKs was increased to the similar extent between WT and MKP-1<sup>-/-</sup> MEFs at 4 h post-radiation, and phosphorylation of p38 and ERK gradually decreased afterward. In contrast, the increased JNK phosphorylation was maintained at elevated levels in MKP-1<sup>-/-</sup> MEFs at 8 and 12 h post-radiation compared with MKP-1 WT cells at the same time points. Thus, although radiation is able to activate all three MAPKs, the deficiency of MKP-1 appears specifically to contribute to prolonged activation of JNK in MKP-1<sup>-/-</sup> cells. Therefore, it is possible that radiation-induced MKP-1 inhibits JNK-mediated apoptosis by inactivation of JNK.</p><p>It is well documented that ionizing radiation induces cellular redox (oxidation/reduction) alterations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref40">40</xref>) that may drastically affect MKP-1 function. MKP-1 belongs to protein-tyrosine phosphatases containing the protein-tyrosine phosphatase signature motif. A key feature of this motif is that the catalytic cysteine is highly sensitive to oxidation because of its low p<italic>K<sub>a</sub></italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref41">41</xref>). To insights of MKP-1 induction, we asked whether basal levels of MKP-1 without radiation could inactivate JNK by CHX to block <italic>de novo</italic> synthesis of MKP-1. As shown in <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4<italic>B</italic></xref>, CHX only marginally activated JNK in WT MEFs at 12 h after CHX treatment, consistent with previously reported results (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref42">42</xref>). In contrast, CHX treatment induced a substantially high level of JNK activity in MKP-1<sup>-/-</sup> cells that reached a maximum at 4 h and remained elevated 12 h after CHX treatment. These results indicate that under basal conditions without radiation treatment, the presence of MKP-1 can attenuate CHX-induced JNK activation as observed in WT MEFs. To further determine whether the increased JNK activity at 12 h post-CHX treatment in WT MEFs was due to degradation of MKP-1, we treated WT MEFs with protease inhibitor MG115 followed by CHX to estimate the MKP-1 degradation rate. The half-life of MKP-1 protein in WT MEFs was &#x0223c;6 h (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4<italic>C</italic></xref>), suggesting that the increased JNK activation after CHX treatment is related to MKP-1 protein degradation.</p><p><fig position="float" id="fig3"><label>FIGURE 3.</label><caption><p><bold>NF-&#x003ba;B was required for radiation-induced MKP-1 expression.</bold><italic>A</italic>, diagrammatic depictions of human MKP-1 luciferase reporter (<italic>left panel</italic>) and deletion of the NF-&#x003ba;B-binding site (pGL3-E-MKP-1-&#x00394;NF-&#x003ba;B) (<italic>right panel</italic>). <italic>B</italic>, HK-18 cells transfected with pGL3-E-MKP-1, pGL3-E-MKP-1-&#x00394;NF-&#x003ba;B, or pGL3-E together with pRL-TK were irradiated with 10 Gy of &#x003b3;-ray or treated with H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> (400 &#x003bc;<sc>m</sc>, as a control).

To determine whether MKP-1 is an effective target to enhance radiation-induced apoptosis, we designed and tested MKP-1 siRNA on enhancement of radiation-induced proapoptotic response in three human cancer cell lines (lung cancer A549 cells, breast cancer MCF-7 cells, and MDA-MB-231 cells, all of which are MKP-1 wild type; data not shown). Radiation significantly increased MKP-1 mRNA and protein levels in all three cancer cell lines (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7, <italic>A</italic> and <italic>B</italic></xref>), and MKP-1 siRNA significantly reduced the radiation-induced MKP-1 expression (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7<italic>C</italic></xref>). The caspase 3/7 activity, an index of proapoptotic response, was significantly increased in tumor cells transfected with MKP-1 siRNA, indicating that reduced MKP-1 expression is correlated with radiation-induced apoptosis (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7<italic>D</italic></xref>).</p><p><italic>MKP-1</italic> homologous genes are significantly conserved in evolution; the degree of sequence similarity between MKP-1 proteins of mouse and human is 98%.

Therefore, to further confirm specificity of the effect of MKP-1 inhibition by siRNA on radiation-induced apoptosis in three human tumor cells, we co-transfected human MKP-1 siRNA with mouse MKP-1 (pcDNA3-MKP-1).

Our results demonstrate that radiation-induced MKP-1 expression is regulated by NF-&#x003ba;B causing the attenuation of JNK-mediated pro-apoptotic response. The negative regulation of JNK activity by NF-&#x003ba;B-regulated MKP-1 expression represents a potential therapeutic target to adjust cell radiosensitivity.</p><p><italic>MKP-1 Bridged Negative Cross-talk between NF-&#x003ba;B and JNK Pathways</italic>&#x02014;The fate of an irradiated cell is believed to depend on a balance of anti-apoptotic and pro-apoptotic pathways induced by different genotoxic conditions including ionizing radiation. Both anti-apoptotic NF-&#x003ba;B and pro-apoptotic JNK pathways are sensitive to the oxidative stress and are well documented to play essential roles in regulation of radiation-induced anti- and pro-apoptotic responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref44">44</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref45">45</xref>). NF-&#x003ba;B is a well defined stress-sensitive heterodimeric transcription factor that is able to inhibit apoptosis and promote cell survival in response to a variety of genotoxic stress including &#x003b3;-radiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref46">46</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref47">47</xref>). After long being speculated, the exact cross-talk between radiation-induced prosurvival NF-&#x003ba;B pathway and pro-apoptotic JNK pathway remains elusive. The results of the present study provide evidence indicating that MKP-1 is a new effector gene for NF-&#x003ba;B-regulated anti-apoptotic response (Figs. <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref> and <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). NF-&#x003ba;B-mediated MKP-1 activation directly accounts for negative regulation of JNK activation and inhibition of the JNK-mediated pro-apoptotic status.</p><p><fig position="float" id="fig6"><label>FIGURE 6.</label><caption><p><bold>Inhibition of JNK, but not p38 and ERK, inhibited radiation-induced &#x00394;&#x003a8;<sub>m</sub> decrease.</bold> WT and MKP-1<sup>-/-</sup> MEFs were treated with or without JNK inhibitor SP600125 (2 &#x003bc;<sc>m</sc>), ERK inhibitor U0126 (20 &#x003bc;<sc>m</sc>), p38 inhibitor SB202190 (1 &#x003bc;<sc>m</sc>), or Me<sub>2</sub>SO (solvent negative control) for 60 min followed by radiation with 0 or 10 Gy of &#x003b3;-ray.

An interesting finding of the current study is that JNK was specifically targeted by radiation-induced MKP-1. Although MKP-1 is shown to be able to inactivate three MAPKs, its substrate selectivity varies because of the nature of different stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref48">48</xref>). We found that radiation with 10 Gy of &#x003b3;-ray indeed activated all three members of MAPKs in both WT and MKP-1<sup>-/-</sup> cells, but only JNK exhibited a prolonged activation in MKP-1<sup>-/-</sup> cells (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4<italic>A</italic></xref>). This prolonged JNK activation was not detected by the treatment of TNF&#x003b1; and IL-6 (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>), suggesting that JNK is the preferred substrate of MKP-1 upon &#x003b3;-radiation. Because both TNF&#x003b1; and IL-6 are well known inducers for NF-&#x003ba;B activation, which is required to up-regulate MKP-1, the exact mechanisms underlying the specifically targeting of MAPKs by MKP-1 between radiation and other stimulations remain to be elucidated.</p><p><fig position="float" id="fig7"><label>FIGURE 7.</label><caption><p><bold>Inhibition of MKP-1 enhanced radiation-induced apoptosis in tumor cells.</bold> MKP-1 mRNA (<italic>A</italic>) or MKP-1 protein (<italic>B</italic>) was measured by real time PCR or immunoblotting in three MKP-1 wild type human tumor cell lines (MCF-7, MDA-MB231, and A549) at indicated times after radiation with 10 Gy of &#x003b3;-ray. <italic>C</italic>, tumor cells were transfected with the human MKP-1 siRNA (50 n<sc>m</sc>) and scrambled siRNA as described under &#x0201c;Experimental Procedures&#x0201d; for 48 h, and MKP-1 inhibition was detected by immunoblotting (siRNA control = cells without transfection). <italic>D</italic>, caspase 3/7 activity was analyzed in tumor cells at 24 h post-radiation with 10 Gy of &#x003b3;-ray following transfection with scrambled or MKP-1 siRNA (50 n<sc>m</sc>) or transfection with MKP-1 siRNA (50 n<sc>m</sc>) together with overexpressing MKP-1 by transfection with pcDNA3-MKP-1 for 48 h (means &#x000b1; S.E.; <italic>n</italic> = 3).</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="zbc0330844830007"></graphic></fig></p><p>The capability of basal level MKP-1 to inactivate JNK varies with different types of cellular stimuli. Interestingly, our results suggested that the basal level of MKP-1 did not significantly suppress the radiation-induced JNK activation (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4<italic>D</italic></xref>), whereas it almost totally blocked CHX-induced JNK activation (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4<italic>B</italic></xref>). These results together with the reported data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref49">49</xref>) suggest that inactivation of JNK by basal level MKP-1 depends on the distinct nature of stimulus. The low levels of basal MKP-1 protein could be oxidized by reactive oxygen species generated during &#x003b3;-radiation, which, could result in a dysfunction in the basal MKP-1 function for JNK inhibition. In contrast, this dysfunction of MKP-1 was not detected in CHX-treated cells as reported by others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref39">39</xref>). In addition, we found that both MKP-1 induction and MKP-1-mediated attenuation of JNK activation were independent from caspase pathway (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4<italic>E</italic></xref>). Thus, induction of <italic>de novo</italic> MKP-1 protein synthesis appears to be a specific event required for inhibiting the JNK-mediated apoptosis by radiation.</p><p><italic>MKP-1 Induction Was Correlated Negatively with JNK Inactivation upon</italic> &#x003b3;<italic>-Radiation</italic>&#x02014;Our data showed a direct link between MKP-1 induction and inhibition of JNK-mediated pro-apoptosis (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>). In agreement with the prolonged JNK activation in MKP-1 null cells, an elevated apoptosis was induced in MKP-1 null but not in WT MEFs, indicating that prolonged activation of JNK is due to the loss of MKP-1. In addition, blockade of JNK activity by its inhibitor or siRNA abrogated the enhanced apoptosis in MKP-1<sup>-/-</sup> cells, suggesting that the elevated apoptosis induced by &#x003b3;-radiation in MKP-1<sup>-/-</sup> cells is dependent on the JNK activation. Although the JNK inhibitor SP600125 may affect other kinases at high concentrations, it has been broadly used for inactivating JNK (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref48">48</xref>) as a powerful JNK inhibitor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref50">50</xref>). Thus, an acute response of MKP-1 induction is specifically required for inhibiting JNK-mediated pro-apoptosis by radiation.</p><p><italic>Inhibition of MKP-1 Sensitized Radiation-induced Proapoptotic Status in Tumor Cells</italic>&#x02014;Previous reports indicate that activation of MKP-1 can cause resistance to chemotherapy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref35">35</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref51">51</xref>). MKP-1<sup>-/-</sup> cells showed higher sensitivity to &#x003b3;-radiation-induced cell death and lower level of clonogenic survival (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>), and inhibition of MKP-1 by siRNA enhanced radiation-induced proapoptotic status with enhanced caspase 3 and 7 activity in MKP-1 wild type human cancer cell lines (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref>). These results further highlight a crucial function of MKP-1 in signaling radiation-induced adaptive resistance. In addition, our study revealed a previously unrecognized function of MKP-1 as a key effector protein of NF-&#x003ba;B-mediated pro-survival pathway. Abrogating NF-&#x003ba;B activity has been extensively studied for enhancing anti-cancer therapy, and identification of specific NF-&#x003ba;B effectors is essential for new drug development. The present study indicates that MKP-1 has a therapeutic potential for sensitization of tumor cells to radiotherapy.</p><p>We conclude that &#x003b3;-irradiation-induced MKP-1 plays an anti-apoptosis function via the inhibition of JNK-mediated proapoptosis.
