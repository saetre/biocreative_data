The nucleotide sequences of aspA and its flanking regions were determined. The aspA gene encodes a protein with a molecular weight of 52,224 consisted of 477 amino acid residues. The amino acid sequence of the protein predicted from the nucleotide sequence was consistent with those of the NH2- and COOH-terminal regions and also with the amino acid composition of the purified aspartase determined previously. Potential promoter and terminator sequences for aspA were also found in the determined sequence.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><supplementary-material content-type="scanned-pages"><graphic xlink:href="nar00300-0247.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="2063"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00300-0248.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="2064"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00300-0249.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="2065"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00300-0250.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="2066"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00300-0251.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="2067"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00300-0252.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="2068"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00300-0253.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="2069"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00300-0254.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="2070"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00300-0255.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="2071"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00300-0256.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="2072"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00300-0257.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="2073"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00300-0258.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="2074"/></supplementary-material></body></article>
