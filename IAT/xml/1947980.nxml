Axon pathfinding in many systems is heavily dependent upon genetically programmed expression of guidance factors and their receptors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Recent studies have indicated that dendrite target selection and aspects of synapse specificity can also be precisely genetically programmed in flies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>] and vertebrates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. For example, wiring specificity in the adult <italic>Drosophila </italic>olfactory system is achieved during pupal development before the onset of olfactory receptor expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. Olfactory receptor neurons (ORNs) project their axons to glomeruli in the antennal lobe (AL), where they synapse with the dendrites of projection neurons (PNs) (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1a</xref>; reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]). PNs target their dendrites to single glomeruli and send their axons to stereotypic locations in the mushroom body (MB) and lateral horn (LH) according to their glomerular class [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. Most PNs are derived from three neuroblast lineages, anterodorsal (adPNs), lateral (lPNs) and ventral (vPNs). adPNs and lPNs innervate intercalating but non-overlapping sets of glomeruli, suggesting lineage-specific control of targeting. Additionally, adPNs are specified by birth order, suggesting that instructive information within a lineage determines wiring patterns [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Indeed, PN dendritic patterning precedes ORN axon patterning: by the time pioneering ORN axons arrive at the developing AL, PN dendrites have already formed a coarse map by virtue of their specific dendritic targeting [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>].</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>The <italic>Drosophila </italic>olfactory system, the <italic>lola </italic>gene, and Lola expression. <bold>(a) </bold>Schematic representation of the <italic>Drosophila </italic>antennal lobe. Olfactory receptor neuron (ORN) axons project to stereotyped glomeruli in the antennal lobe (AL).

These studies suggest a model in which PN dendrites first target to a rough region of the AL based on molecular gradients and then are further refined by dendro-dendritic and dendro-axonal interactions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. The expression of these and additional cell-surface proteins are likely controlled by a transcriptional code that acts to uniquely specify the wiring aptitude of individual PNs[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. Studies of several transcription factors (TFs) support the existence of a transcriptional hierarchy in PNs. Some factors, such as the LIM cofactor Chip, appear to affect wiring in all PN classes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. Other TFs show lineage specific restriction in expression and regulatory effects. For example, the LIM-homeodomain TF Islet is required for proper targeting of a subset of adPNs and lPNs, while the homeodomain TF Cut is required in only a subset of lPNs and all vPNs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. As another example, POU-domain TFs Acj6 and Drifter have restricted expression patterns in adPN and lPN lineages, respectively, and control wiring specificity in their respective lineages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. A recently identified BTB-Zn-finger TF, Chinmo, regulates birth order-dependent wiring of adPNs. Loss of <italic>chinmo </italic>results in adPNs born in early larval life acquiring the targeting specificity of late-born PNs within the same lineage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. There are also TFs that appear to affect targeting of a single PN type. For example, the LIM-homeodomain TF Lim1 is necessary for proper targeting of a single vPN to the DA1 glomerulus, and is regulated by Cut. The Zn-finger TF Squeeze appears to be necessary for the innervation of a single lPN glomerulus, DM5 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. All these studies support a model where the targeting specificity of a particular PN is regulated by a unique complement of TFs, and additional members of the TF code remain to be identified.</p><p>The gene <italic>longitudinals lacking </italic>(<italic>lola</italic>) encodes a molecularly diverse BTB-Zn-finger TF with at least 20 unique protein isoforms (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1b</xref>). Each isoform is formed by combining a set of common BTB-containing amino-terminal exons to unique Zn-finger-containing carboxy-terminal exons via <italic>trans</italic>- and/or <italic>cis</italic>-pre-mRNA splicing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. The BTB (Broad complex, Tramtrack, Bric &#x000e0; brac) domain, also referred to as the POZ (poxvirus and Zn-finger) domain, is a common domain likely involved in protein-protein interactions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. Most <italic>lola </italic>isoforms have one or more unique Zn-fingers of either the C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>2 </sub>type that binds DNA, or the unusual C<sub>2</sub>HC class that binds nucleosomes, non-histone proteins, RNA and DNA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. At least some Lola isoforms bind DNA directly [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. Interestingly, three Lola isoforms lack Zn-fingers and theoretically could be involved in heteromeric regulatory interactions with other Lola isoforms, as Lola was found to bind itself in yeast-two-hybrid interactions and co-immunoprecipitation experiments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. Lola also likely interacts with other proteins such as chromosomal kinase JIL-1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>].</p><p>Lola was initially identified as a factor that regulates axon guidance in the embryonic central nervous system longitudinal tracks, and is reported to function in a wide array of other cellular processes. <italic>lola </italic>mutants exhibit defects in the extension of embryonic longitudinal axons and midline crossing, orientation of lateral chordotonal neurons, and ISN<sub>b </sub>axon growth and elaboration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. Mutation of Lola isoforms K or L is sufficient to inactivate a specific subset of <italic>lola </italic>functions in ISN<sub>b </sub>neurons, suggesting that different Lola isoforms may have unique functions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. <italic>lola </italic>was recently identified to disrupt ORN axonal innervation of the AL in an overexpression screen [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. <italic>lola </italic>may exert its effect through transcriptional regulation of cell-surface molecules, and has been reported to genetically interact with <italic>Notch</italic>, <italic>slit</italic>, and <italic>robo </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. <italic>lola </italic>may have a more general regulatory role as a polycomb group (PcG) factor affecting cell proliferation via the Notch pathway and regulating wing development through a genetic interaction with <italic>cut </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>].</p><p>In this study, we show that <italic>lola </italic>plays an essential role in PN identity and wiring specificity. <italic>lola </italic>appears to be a general factor that affects wiring of both axons and dendrites in all three lineages of PNs. Overexpression of <italic>UAS-lola T </italic>and <italic>UAS-lola L</italic>, but not <italic>UAS-lola A</italic>, results in wiring defects. Additionally, expression of single <italic>lola </italic>isoforms is insufficient to rescue the <italic>lola </italic>null phenotype and often causes additional defects specific to the isoforms expressed, suggesting the importance of Lola molecular diversity in regulating PN wiring specificity. Indeed most <italic>lola </italic>isoforms are expressed in PNs but at different levels. Finally, consistent with previous findings of transcriptional regulation and potential PcG function, we find that <italic>lola </italic>likely regulates <italic>lim1</italic>and several Gal4 enhancer trap lines in PNs. We suggest that <italic>lola </italic>regulates PN wiring through transcriptional regulation of downstream targets involved in defining neuronal identity and targeting specificity.</p></sec><sec><title>Results and discussion</title><p>We investigated the function of <italic>lola </italic>in wiring specificity of olfactory PNs by using the MARCM (mosaic analysis with a repressible cell marker) system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. PNs send dendrites to specific glomeruli in the AL [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>] and axons to the MB and LH in highly stereotyped patterns [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>] (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1a</xref>), allowing us to examine <italic>lola </italic>function in both dendrites and axons.</p><sec><title>Lola is expressed in projection neurons and neuroblasts</title><p>Using a specific antibody raised against the domain common to all Lola isoforms (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1b</xref>), we found that Lola is expressed in all cells in the AL region at all stages of development from larva to adult (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1c&#x02013;g</xref>). These include expression in post-mitotic cells such as PNs, but also in neuroblasts, which we can identify by their size during larval development (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1c</xref>). Antibody specificity was confirmed by loss of Lola staining in neuroblast and single-cell MARCM clones homozygous for a <italic>lola </italic>null allele (<italic>ore76</italic>, which introduces an early stop codon in the BTB domain of all Lola isoforms (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1b</xref>), hereafter referred to as <italic>lola</italic><sup>-/-</sup>) in adult (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1h,i</xref>) and in early pupa (data not shown). Note that Lola staining can be used to identify all mutant cells in a MARCM clone that are not necessarily labeled by <italic>UAS-mCD8::GFP </italic>because Lola is expressed ubiquitously throughout the brain, while Gal4 enhancer traps often have a more limited domain of expression (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1h</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title><italic>lola </italic>mutant projection neurons have dendrite wiring defects</title><p>Since Lola is expressed in PNs during AL development, and mutant clones effectively eliminate Lola protein during the period of dendritic targeting, we proceeded to analyze the phenotype of <italic>lola</italic><sup>-/- </sup>PN MARCM clones.

PNs from adPN and lPN lineages target their dendrites to stereotypical, intercalating but non-overlapping sets of glomeruli [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>] (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2a1,a2,c1</xref>). In general, phenotypes of <italic>lola</italic><sup>-/- </sup>adPNs and lPNs can be classified into two main categories: a loss of targeting to normal target glomeruli and a gain of targeting to off-target (ectopically targeted) glomeruli (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2b1,b2</xref>). However, the phenotypes are highly variable between brains and there are few consistent 'shifts' where one off-target glomerulus is innervated in place of a normal target. The phenotypes also have variable penetrance, with innervation of both normal and ectopic targets ranging from partial to full innervation from brain to brain. Specifically, <italic>lola</italic><sup>-/- </sup>adPNs often invade DA1, DL3 and VA4, which are normal lPN targets. Likewise, mutant lPNs often innervate VA1d, VA1lm, DM6, D, DC2 and VM7, which are normal adPN targets (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2c2</xref>). <italic>lola</italic><sup>-/- </sup>dendrites also appear more diffuse in general, and often 'wander' through the lobe, wrapping around, but not actually innervating, glomeruli. Additionally, <italic>lola</italic><sup>-/- </sup>dendrites are frequently not restricted to the AL and innervate regions of the suboesophageal ganglion (SOG; Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2b1,b3,c2</xref>). Wild-type vPNs strongly innervate DA1 and VA1lm, and one vPN (pan-AL PN) innervates the entire AL (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2a3</xref>). <italic>lola</italic><sup>-/- </sup>vPNs show a strong loss of AL restriction and nearly 37% show ectopic dendritic extensions to the SOG (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2b3,c2</xref>). Additionally, DA1 targeting in ventral clones is almost completely lost (6% versus 82% in wild type) and VA1lm targeting is reduced nearly 30% (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2c2</xref>). We also analyzed an independent <italic>lola</italic><sup><italic>ore</italic>5<italic>D</italic>2 </sup>allele of <italic>lola</italic>, which is predicted to be strongly hypomorphic due to a P-element insertion in the <italic>lola </italic>promoter (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1b</xref>). <italic>lola</italic><sup><italic>ore</italic>5<italic>D</italic>2 </sup>clones display many of the phenotypes observed in the <italic>ore76 </italic>null allele (see additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>), indicating that the phenotypes we observed are caused by loss of <italic>lola</italic>.</p><p>Given that Lola is ubiquitously expressed, dendritic defects in neuroblast clones can be attributed to its requirement in the neuroblast or post-mitotic cells or both; furthermore, one cannot determine cell autonomy with certainty. We therefore examined single cell clones that target to the DL1 glomerulus to test whether <italic>lola </italic>has a cell-autonomous and post-mitotic function. We found that nearly 80% of <italic>lola</italic><sup>-/- </sup>DL1 single cell clones show targeting defects (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2b4,c2</xref>) and 23% completely fail to innervate DL1. Another 54% innervate DL1 (though often weakly or partially) and have additional extensions either wandering between glomeruli or, more frequently, innervating glomeruli anterior to DL1 in the AL (see Table S1 in additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S2">2</xref>). Using the pan-Lola antibody, we can verify there are no unlabeled clones in the vicinity of the AL and be certain we are looking at cell-autonomous effects. At least in the DL1 PN, therefore, <italic>lola </italic>appears to have post-mitotic, cell intrinsic effects on dendritic targeting.</p><p>To extend higher resolution phenotypic analysis to other PN classes, we examined adPN and lPN neuroblast clones using Gal4-Mz19, which labels a small subset of GH146-positive neurons that project to DA1, VA1d and DC3 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. Interestingly, dendritic targeting of <italic>lola</italic><sup>-/- </sup>DA1 and VA1d PNs exhibit phenotypes with much less severity and penetrance than other <italic>lola</italic><sup>-/- </sup>PNs. Normal target glomeruli were almost always strongly targeted, and defects mainly consisted of additional dendritic extensions into the AL (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2b5,6</xref>). Consistent with this, we find that DA1 (innervated by lPNs) and VA1d (innervated by adPNs) are two of the most 'stable' glomeruli and show little phenotype in GH146 mutant neuroblast clones (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2c2</xref>). These two glomeruli are also often ectopically innervated by <italic>lola</italic><sup>-/- </sup>PNs from the opposite lineage (that is, DA1 is ectopically targeted by <italic>lola</italic><sup>-/- </sup>adPNs while VA1d is ectopically targeted by <italic>lola</italic><sup>-/- </sup>lPNs).

A smaller percentage of <italic>lola</italic><sup>-/- </sup>clones (15% adPNs and 7% PNs) showed medium or severe axon defects (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3d</xref>). Hypomorphic clones (<italic>ore5D2</italic>) show similar, but mostly mild, targeting defects (see Table S2 in additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S2">2</xref>).</p><p>Axons of vPNs are the most severely affected: nearly 100% of clones exhibit defects in both <italic>lola</italic><sup>-/- </sup>and hypomorphic (<italic>ore5D2</italic>) alleles (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3b3,d</xref>; see Table S2 and S4 in additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S2">2</xref>). Often ventral axons show several defects in the same brain. Seventy-nine percent of <italic>lola</italic><sup>-/- </sup>clones show ectopic branching defects (often extensions from the LH towards the SOG or an increase in branches along the medial extension). Thirty-four percent of clones show misrouting defects; most often a single axon defasciculates from the bundle and projects directly to the medial-central region of the LH instead of the ventral region (compare Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3a3</xref> to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3b3</xref>). Nine percent of null clones and 47% of hypomorph clones show clear axonal targeting to the SOG (this may be higher in the null but it can be difficult to distinguish between axon and dendrite mistargeting unless clear defasciculation from the main axon bundle is visible). We observe that all PN axons exit the AL in a single bundle, but then some axons defasciculate and project ventrally to the SOG (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3c</xref>). It is interesting to note that axons misguided to the SOG typically project to similar locations in the SOG, suggesting they may be responding to some cues in this region.</p><p>More than 50% of DL1 single cell clones show axon defects (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3b4,d</xref>, see Table S3 in additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S2">2</xref>), suggesting that Lola acts cell-autonomously in axon targeting. Twenty-six percent of DL1 <italic>lola</italic><sup>-/- </sup>axons have ectopic branches, often with additional branches in the LH region (see Table S2 in additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S2">2</xref>). Fifteen percent of clones fail to extend branches into the MB (see Table S2 in additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S2">2</xref>). Some DL1 axons clearly bifurcate just prior to entering the MB. It is interesting to note that many DL1 clones that fail to target the DL1 glomerulus have relatively normal axonal projections. A severe dendrite phenotype does not predict the most severe axon phenotypes (or vice versa), suggesting that these two processes are separable, in agreement with recent observations of independence between axon and dendrite targeting [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>].

Given that <italic>lola </italic>encodes 20 alternatively spliced isoforms, several scenarios may account for <italic>lola </italic>function (see additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S3">3</xref>). In scenario I, different isoforms may be expressed in different neuroblast lineages and thereby specify their lineage-specific wiring analogous to POU transcription factors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. In scenario II, individual PNs may express a unique isoform or combination of isoforms independent of lineage to specify PN identity. In scenario III, all cells may express most or all <italic>lola </italic>isoforms.</p><p>To distinguish between these possibilities, we performed RNA <italic>in situ </italic>hybridization with probes against 16 of the 20 <italic>lola </italic>isoforms at 0 h after puparium formation (APF), a developmental time when PNs start to elaborate dendrites in the AL [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. We first verified our <italic>in situ </italic>protocol by using probes against <italic>drifter </italic>(<italic>dfr</italic>), a TF that has previously been shown to be expressed in GH146 labeled lPNs but not adPNs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. As expected, we found that signal from anti-sense probe against <italic>dfr </italic>mRNA coincides with green fluorescent protein (GFP)-labeled lPNs but not adPNs (see additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S3">3</xref>). A sense control probe shows little signal coinciding with the GFP-positive cell bodies (see additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S3">3</xref>). We then performed <italic>in situ </italic>analysis with <italic>lola </italic>probes. A probe to the <italic>lola </italic>common region shows expression throughout the brain (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4a1,a3</xref>) compared with sense control (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4a2</xref>), consistent with our Lola antibody staining results. For individual isoform mRNAs, we detect signal in the region of the AL for all <italic>lola </italic>isoforms tested, as well as other brain regions. Some isoforms have narrower domains of expression, such as isoforms N (see additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S3">3</xref>) and T (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4d1,d3</xref>), which have much stronger signal in the central brain and weaker staining in the optic lobe. Other isoforms appear to be expressed more uniformly throughout the region of the AL (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>; see additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S3">3</xref>). It should be noted that several isoforms have more punctate signal that co-localizes with the nucleus (see additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S3">3</xref>f, k, r), perhaps indicative of pre-mRNA. Another caveat is that mRNA production may not translate to protein expression, as recently shown by the wide mRNA but narrow protein expression domains of <italic>nerfin </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>].

Phenotypes often include a large increase in wandering dendrites in the AL and some degree of loss of targeting and ectopic targeting. Often dendrites appear to be largely restricted to one region of the AL such as dorsal or lateral, and have wandering dendrites through this region in many glomeruli, but fail to innervate normal targets or extend any dendrites into other regions of the AL (see Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S5">5</xref>c, e, f). <italic>UAS-lola T </italic>expression also results in a decrease in the number of labeled PNs, in part likely due to cytotoxicity based on the observation of clones with very punctate GFP staining patterns indicative of cell and process degeneration, although we were unable to reliably stain brain tissues for activated caspase-3 (V Trunova and E Giniger, unpublished data). Due to the difficulty in quantifying phenotypes in adPN and lPN neuroblast clones because of the magnitude and variability, we focused our analysis on vPN neuroblast clones and single-cell DL1 clones.</p><p>vPN neuroblast clones in animals raised at 25&#x000b0;C show no defects when overexpressing <italic>lola A </italic>(Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5b1</xref>) and weak phenotypes when overexpressing <italic>lola L </italic>(Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5c1</xref>), but vPNs are strongly affected by <italic>lola T </italic>overexpression (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5e1,f1</xref>).

The DL1 dendrites targeted correctly with <italic>lola L </italic>overexpression, but frequently showed a large increase in dendritic mass outside of DL1, wandering throughout the AL (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5c2,h</xref>). In axons, overexpression of <italic>lola L </italic>often resulted in an increase in branching in MB and LH regions (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5c3,i</xref>). In the LH, these additional branches resulted in a loss of the stereotypic 'L' projection and a failure of branches to fully extend into normal target areas. <italic>lola T </italic>overexpression resulted in variable DL1 phenotypes, ranging from a complete loss of DL1 innervation and targeting to other regions of the AL to DL1 targeting with dendritic extensions outside of the DL1 glomerular region (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5e2,f2,h</xref>). <italic>lola T </italic>overexpression also affected axon targeting, most often resulting in a high degree of ectopic branching, axon bifurcation and incorrect LH innervation patterns (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5e3,f3,i</xref>). It is interesting to note that isoforms L and T are normally expressed at low levels based on RT-PCR results, while isoform A is expressed roughly 10-fold higher (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4e</xref>).

In neuroblast clones we observed a qualitative increase of phenotypic severity in both dendritic and axonal targeting with increasing temperature (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5d,e,f</xref>). This dosage sensitivity can be quantified with the DL1 dendritic phenotypes (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5h</xref>). Flies raised at 18&#x000b0;C have few dendritic phenotypes, while at 25&#x000b0;C and 29&#x000b0;C dendrites mistarget and have ectopic innervations and axons have additional branches and bifurcations (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5h,i</xref>; see Table S1 in additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S2">2</xref>).

Post-mitotic expression of a single isoform is not sufficient to rescue the <italic>lola </italic>phenotype, and indeed is more disruptive to a cell than simple loss of <italic>lola</italic>. This does not, however, rule out an additional function of Lola in the neuroblast. Lastly, some aspects of Lola function are likely mediated through the BTB domain alone, as additive phenotypes can be caused by expressing isoforms with or without Zn-fingers.</p></sec><sec><title>Evidence that <italic>lola</italic> regulates cell identity and transcription</title><p>The dendritic and axonal phenotypes in <italic>lola</italic><sup>-/-</sup>clones we described so far could be caused by the action of Lola on PN targeting directly (for instance, by regulating the expression of cell surface receptors), or Lola could regulate PN identity with axonal and dendritic mistargeting as a secondary consequence. Although these models are not mutually exclusive, we provide some evidence in <italic>lola</italic><sup>-/-</sup>MARCM clones using several Gal4 lines, including Mz19, GH146 and NP3529, to support the second hypothesis.</p><p>MARCM with several mutant alleles suggests that <italic>lola </italic>regulates the expression of Gal4-Mz19. Ten percent of <italic>lola</italic><sup><italic>ore</italic>5<italic>D</italic>2 </sup>(<italic>lola </italic>hypomorph) and <italic>lola</italic><sup>-/- </sup>clones show a 30% to 50% increase in the number of labeled PNs and targeted glomeruli (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7a2,a3</xref>; MARCM control Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2a5,a6</xref>). Strikingly, we observed (in 64% of all adPN clones) that <italic>lola L</italic><sup>-/-</sup>(<italic>lola</italic><sup><italic>ore</italic>119</sup>) clones frequently target the DL1 glomerulus (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7a5</xref>), which is normally targeted by GH146 positive, but never Mz19 positive, PNs. As our heat-shock timing in these experiments should not result in any Mz19 single cell clones (they are born later) but coincides exclusively with the birth of the DL1 PN [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>], the simplest interpretation is that Mz19 is now misexpressed in DL1 PNs. This would suggest that <italic>lola </italic>normally represses Mz19 expression in DL1 PNs. As additional evidence that <italic>lola </italic>regulates gene expression, 25% of clones of both <italic>lola</italic><sup>-/- </sup>and <italic>lola L</italic><sup>-/-</sup>visualized by Gal4-Mz19 appear to label local interneurons (LNs), an additional cell-type that innervates a large number of glomeruli in the AL and lacks axonal projections out of the AL region (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7a4,a6</xref>). The similarity of isoform L specific phenotypes to phenotypes in other <italic>lola </italic>alleles suggests that <italic>lola</italic><sup>ore119 </sup>phenotypes in PNs might be caused by the disruption in isoform L instead of a second site mutation on the same chromosomal arm. Thus, it appears that in the absence of Lola (particularly the Lola L isoform), Gal4-Mz19 is ectopically expressed in neuronal types that normally do not express this Gal4 enhancer trap line.</p><fig position="float" id="F7"><label>Figure 7</label><caption><p>Evidence that <italic>lola </italic>regulates expression of Gal4 drivers and Lim1. <bold>(a) </bold>Gal4-Mz19 mislabeling analysis.

In <italic>lola</italic><sup>-/- </sup>mutant cells, Lim1 expression is lost (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7e1,e2</xref>).

However, Cut expression is not altered in <italic>lola</italic><sup>-/-</sup>clones, and Lola expression is not altered in <italic>cut</italic><sup>-/-</sup>clones (data not shown), suggesting these TFs coordinately regulate Lim1 expression through parallel pathways. Intriguingly, PNs mutant for <italic>lola</italic>, <italic>lim1 </italic>or <italic>cut </italic>all fail to target DA1, suggesting that <italic>cut </italic>and <italic>lola </italic>may be necessary for regulation of other TFs as well as wiring.

Here we have characterized an additional TF, Lola, as necessary for proper AL wiring specificity of both PN dendrites and axons. <italic>lola</italic><sup>-/- </sup>mutant clones show a wide variety of wiring phenotypes, including a loss of targeting to correct glomeruli, innervation of ectopic targets, a loss of lineage restriction in dendritic projections, a loss of AL boundary restriction, and an increase in wandering projections and ectopic branch formation. Additionally, <italic>lola </italic>appears normally to repress the expression of multiple Gal4 drivers in certain cell-types and positively regulate <italic>lim1 </italic>in vPNs. These data suggest that <italic>lola </italic>regulates multiple developmental processes, including identity as well as wiring specificity of PNs, consistent with its expression in neuroblasts and post-mitotic neurons. In fact, the wide variety of phenotypes observed in <italic>lola </italic>mutants may be a general characteristic of genes involved in multiple developmental processes, as similar phenotypes are observed in mutants of general TF complex cofactors, such as <italic>chip </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>], or are known chromatin regulatory genes (D Berdnik and LL, unpublished data). This is the first report linking roles for <italic>lola </italic>in both fate and wiring specificity in the same cell-type, suggesting that PNs have a tightly linked relationship between targeting specificity and cell identity.</p><p><italic>lola </italic>is a highly complex genetic locus and encodes at least 20 different splice isoforms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. Although Lola is expressed throughout development, quantitative RT-PCR reveals that individual isoforms have different levels of expression. The diversity of <italic>lola </italic>isoform expression in PNs also appears important, as expression of a single <italic>UAS</italic>-<italic>lola </italic>transgene fails to rescue null mutant phenotypes and often results in even more severe phenotypes that are specific to the expressed <italic>lola </italic>isoform. We tested available isoform-specific <italic>lola </italic>alleles, and found that an isoform L (but not K) mutant has mild targeting defects. The difficulties of generating other isoform-specific alleles in this locus, coupled with the strong gain-of-function effect of expressing transgenes of a single isoform, made it difficult for us to investigate further isoform-specific functions of <italic>lola </italic>in PN development. However, taken together with previous reports [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>], our results support the notion that different isoforms may have unique functions in PNs in addition to embryonic motor neurons.</p><p>Several lines of evidence suggest that Lola can regulate chromatin structure. Loss of function (LOF) mutations in <italic>lola </italic>enhance the Pc/+ phenotype and result in a significant increase in the number of sex-combs on the second leg, as do other known PcG factors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. This reported PcG interaction, in addition to direct binding of the chromosomal kinase JIL-1 and the presence of the nucleosome binding C<sub>2</sub>HC class Zn-finger [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>], suggests that at least some Lola isoforms may be part of chromatin regulatory complexes. Additionally, at least one Lola isoform has been shown to bind directly to DNA and regulate expression of the <italic>copia </italic>retrotransposon [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. Many chromatin regulators are integral components in pathways of cell fate specification. Neuronal cell fate is closely linked with dendritic and axonal targeting, particularly in PNs where cell identities based on birth order are manifested as wiring choices and target specification [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. This link between targeting and cell identity has been suggested in the MB, where mutation of the chromatin modifier <italic>polyhomeotic </italic>causes MB neurons to randomly express certain <italic>Hox </italic>genes that are normally suppressed and to display a wide variety of axon targeting defects that are neither a complete targeting fate switch nor consistent between individuals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. This is reminiscent of the <italic>lola </italic>phenotype in PNs, suggesting that <italic>lola </italic>might function in a similar manner.</p><p><italic>lola </italic>may additionally play a more direct role in targeting. <italic>lola </italic>mutants affect some glomeruli more severely than others and have post-mitotic functions in DL1 dendritic targeting, suggesting that there is a differential requirement for, or sensitivity to, the loss of <italic>lola </italic>between individual PNs. <italic>lola </italic>also has specific targeting phenotypes in the embryonic central and peripheral nervous systems, as mutations in <italic>lola </italic>seem to disrupt axon guidance and extension of the Ap<sup>+</sup>, VUM, and ISN<sub>b </sub>neurons without affecting the numbers or differentiation of these neuronal subtypes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. Taken together, this evidence suggests that <italic>lola </italic>may participate both in fate determination and, more directly, in wiring specificity. If the processes of fate determination and wiring specificity are separable, one might expect a factor that controls wiring to directly regulate the expression of genes that function in targeting, such as cell surface receptors, while a factor that controls cell fate should affect the expression of 'fate' markers that subsequently disrupt downstream expression of the components of the wiring machinery in an indirect fashion. Future identification of direct targets of <italic>lola </italic>regulation will be informative and necessary to understand the exact mechanism of <italic>lola </italic>function in PNs.</p><p>The idea that TFs can differentially control fate specification and wiring specificity is consistent with the model of a hierarchical TF code that determines wiring specificity. It is interesting to consider the possibility that some TFs may be used at multiple points during identity and wiring specification. In neuron sub-type specification in the ventral nerve cord, the TF <italic>collier </italic>specifies the precursors of the Ap neuron subset, but must be turned-off in three of the four Ap cells as subsequent participation of <italic>collier </italic>in a multi-protein complex later in development defines a unique sub-type of Ap neurons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. During development of the peripheral nervous system, <italic>cut </italic>specifies sensory neuron identity and is required again later in development at different levels in subpopulations of dendritic arborization neurons to specify subclass arborization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. Similarly, in vPN development, the TF Cut is necessary in the neuroblast for generation of the correct number of vPNs and postmitotically for specific targeting of the VA1lm glomerulus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. Temporal regulation and multi-functionality of TFs are possible mechanisms to limit the required number of genes in a TF code while still uniquely specifying cell identity. Lola is a potential candidate for a TF that may function in this way, both specifying cell identity and playing more specific roles later in development in regulating wiring specificity.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Fly stocks and reagents</title><p>MARCM stocks used were as previously published [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>].
