The neuroendocrine system appears to be highly conserved between mammals and teleosts, as evidenced by shared programs found for pituitary development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>] and the spatial patterns and functional roles of hypothalamic neuropeptides [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. In teleosts, much of the neuroendocrine system becomes functional between 48 and 72 hours post-fertilization (hpf), when the embryo hatches from its chorion and becomes fully exposed to an external environment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. By 5 days post-fertilization (dpf) this newly hatched embryo has developed into a free-swimming larva that must respond and adapt to external and internal cues. Thus, this embryo-to-larva transition (3 to 5 dpf) is a distinct developmental stage, somewhat analogous to mammalian birth when the newborn integrates sensory input and initiates regulated-secretion to maintain homeostasis.</p><p>While the demand for neuroendocrine signaling and regulated neuropeptide secretion increases dramatically when a newborn is exposed to an external environment, cell-specific transcriptional programs appear to initiate much earlier [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. Indeed, birthdating experiments in rodents show that hypothalamic neurons originate from the third ventricular neuroepithelium beginning at embryonic day (E)12 and are largely differentiated by E16 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>], as judged by expression and translation of cell type-specific neuropeptide transcripts and protein, respectively. That the onset of hypothalamic transcriptional programs predates function is perhaps best illustrated by the ontogeny of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) neurons (also known as luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH) neurons). In both mammals and zebrafish this subpopulation of neurons migrates from the olfactory placode into the hypothalamus and eventually orchestrates germ cell maturation at the onset of sexual maturity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. However, during embryonic development and prior to their migration, immature GnRH neurons express their signature neuropeptide [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. These and other studies suggest that the neuroendocrine system develops early in the fetus and remains primed to secrete neuropeptides at later time points [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>].</p><p>To identify genes that might be critical for hypothalamic development during this embryo-to-larva transition, we re-screened mutant 5 dpf zebrafish larvae that fail to undergo visually mediated background adaptation (VBA) for disruption in neuropeptide transcription. VBA is a well characterized neuroendocrine reflex that occurs in fish, reptiles, and amphibians (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]). When placed on a dark, light-absorbing background, pituitary melanotropes release &#x003b1;-melanocyte-stimulating hormone; this neuropeptide mediates dispersion of black pigment granules in dermal melanophores and causes a darkening of skin color in fish. Conversely, when placed on a light background, a drop in &#x003b1;-melanocyte-stimulating hormone levels results in the aggregation of melanin and a loss of this 'dark' phenotype or an overall blanching. Because &#x003b1;-melanocyte-stimulating hormone is directly regulated by hypothalamic inputs, we reasoned that critical developmental neuroendocrine genes might be discovered in VBA-mutant zebrafish [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>] with altered <italic>proopiomelanocortin </italic>(<italic>pomc</italic>) expression.</p><p>From our screen, one mutant line showed a complete and specific loss of <italic>pomc </italic>expression in the presumptive arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus. To our surprise, this mutated gene was identified as <italic>N-ethylmaleimide sensitive factor </italic>(<italic>nsf</italic>, <italic>SEC18</italic>), which is an ATPase and functions in membrane fusion events as well as acting as a structural chaperone (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]). These functional roles of NSF are important for regulated secretion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>] and for intracellular trafficking [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. Our analysis of <italic>nsf </italic>mutant zebrafish led us to examine how hypothalamic developmental programs respond to a major secretory defect. We report that <italic>nsf</italic>-deficient hypothalamic neurons exhibit a marked accumulation of neuropeptide proteins with a corresponding stage-dependent loss of mRNA, suggesting that neuropeptide stores in the cytoplasm feedback to regulate transcriptional programs in the nucleus.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Loss of hypothalamic <italic>pomc </italic>expression in <italic>nsf </italic>mutant zebrafish</title><p>To identify genes critical to neurosecretory cell function, we screened a collection of 50 VBA-deficient zebrafish mutants for disrupted <italic>pomc </italic>expression. These mutants have been described previously in a forward genetic screen employing the chemical mutagen ethyl-nitroso urea [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. Five mutants with a range of hypothalamic defects were identified in our screen, one of which (<italic>s364</italic>) is reported here. <italic>s364 </italic>mutant zebrafish display a dark appearance on light background and lack an inflated swim bladder (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>). Additionally, mutant zebrafish have a listless startle response, become paralyzed, and eventually die by 8 dpf (data not shown). The mutation was mapped to chromosome 3 of the zebrafish genome using polymorphic microsatellite markers (HB, unpublished data). This position matched that of the highly conserved AAA ATPase <italic>nsf</italic>, for which two alleles (<italic>st25 </italic>and <italic>st53</italic>) have been identified previously in an unrelated screen [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>].

Loss of hypothalamic markers in these secretory-defective zebrafish was stage-dependent as evidenced by the normal expression observed at earlier developmental time points (24 hpf; data not shown) and just prior to hatching (48 hpf; Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>). A time course through the embryo-to-larva transition revealed that expression of these hypothalamic markers begins to decrease at 4 dpf, and is completely absent by 5 dpf in <italic>nsf</italic><sup><italic>st</italic>53 </sup>zebrafish (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B, C</xref>; Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref> Figure S1).

In fact, TUNEL (terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase-mediated dUTP nick end labeling) staining on sections (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B</xref>) and whole-mounted (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref> Figure S3B) <italic>nsf</italic><sup><italic>st</italic>53 </sup>zebrafish fixed at 12 h intervals between 48 hpf through 5.5 dpf failed to reveal hypothalamic cell death at all time points.

Indeed, expression patterns of all assayed neuropeptides and transcription factors were indistinguishable in wild-type and <italic>nsf</italic><sup><italic>st</italic>53 </sup>zebrafish, beginning as early as 24 hpf; a similar phenotype was also noted in the <italic>nsf</italic><sup>s364 </sup>allele (data not shown). This is surprising considering the general role of NSF in membrane fusion and its ubiquitous expression throughout development, and given that <italic>Drosophila dNSF1 </italic>mutants exhibit impaired neurogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>]. It is possible that normal hypothalamic development in <italic>nsf</italic><sup><italic>st</italic>53 </sup>may result from compensation by <italic>nsfb</italic>, maternally deposited <italic>nsf </italic>transcripts or residual activity of NSF encoded by the <italic>nsf</italic><sup><italic>st</italic>53 </sup>allele. Clearly, at least some functional NSF is required for survival as evidenced by the fact that co-injection of <italic>nsf</italic>-MO and <italic>nsfb</italic>-MO into <italic>nsf</italic><sup><italic>st</italic>53 </sup>embryos was lethal (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref> Table S1).

Thus, we speculate that increased physiological demand and secretion of neuropeptide cargo during the embryo-to-larva transition accounts for this late-stage loss of neuroendocrine transcripts in <italic>nsf </italic>mutants.</p><p>The neuroendocrine phenotype exhibited by the <italic>nsf</italic><sup><italic>st</italic>53 </sup>zebrafish is partially mimicked in <italic>munc18-1 </italic>mutant mice, which exhibit a selective and stage-dependent (E18) decrease primarily in neuropeptide transcript expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>].

The authors of this study posited that transcripts encoding 'consumables' such as secreted products are selectively downregulated in the <italic>munc18-1 </italic>synaptically silenced neurons. Although neuropeptide protein levels and localization were not assessed in their study, our findings predict that neuropeptides would accumulate in <italic>munc18-1 </italic>hypothalami. We can now extend their hypothesis by suggesting that unspent neuropeptide consumables feed back to silence neuroendocrine transcriptional programs, as shown in our model figure (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8</xref>).</p><p>Our study is now the second to identify <italic>nsf </italic>as essential in a specific neuronal cell-type program using a forward genetic screen in zebrafish. Previously, Talbot and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>] unexpectedly found <italic>nsf </italic>to be essential for organization of myelinated axons, with mutant zebrafish exhibiting decreased myelin basic protein expression and altered sodium channel clustering. Here, we find that this ubiquitous protein is also essential for maintenance of neuroendocrine transcriptional programs. These distinct phenotypes illustrate how different neuronal populations adjust to deficits in membrane fusion and intracellular trafficking. We suggest that hypothalamic neurons mount a stage-dependent adaptive response to this major secretory defect by silencing transcriptional programs. For other neuronal cell types, loss of <italic>nsf </italic>results in vastly different cellular responses. Indeed, we observed prominent cell death in many sensory organs, including photoreceptors, olfactory sensory neurons, and mechanosensory cells in <italic>nsf </italic>mutants. By contrast, no measurable cell death was observed in <italic>nsf </italic>mutant hypothalami as evidenced by the normal gross organization of the <italic>nsf</italic><sup><italic>st</italic>53 </sup>hypothalamus, normal HuC/D staining, which marks early neuronal differentiation, and normal staining with the SV2 pan-neuronal vesicle marker. Targeted knockdown of <italic>nsf </italic>or <italic>nsfb </italic>in the mutant background also ruled out that survival of hypothalamic cells in <italic>nsf</italic><sup><italic>st</italic>53 </sup>was due to compensation by the duplicate gene <italic>nsfb </italic>and/or maternally deposited <italic>nsf </italic>mRNA. Taken together, hypothalamic neurons, unlike other neuronal populations, are able to survive and maintain normal cellular integrity in the face of this major secretory deficit.</p><p>The phenotypes observed in <italic>nsf</italic><sup><italic>st</italic>53 </sup>hypothalamic neurons, including the complete loss of neuroendocrine transcripts and the accumulation of ER-like membranes, are reminiscent of, but different from, other well-described secretory feedback signaling pathways.

Here, we have yet to identify the precise molecular nature of the feedback signal; whether these signals arise from the buildup of ER-like membranes, from accumulation of neuropeptides in the cytoplasm, or from the inability to secrete neuropeptides at the plasma membrane remains to be determined. The build up of ER-like membrane in the cytoplasm of <italic>nsf </italic>hypothalamic neurons suggests that neuropeptidergic cells are responsive to a loss of secretion and not a general trafficking defect. Indeed, we can mimic this phenotype with a transient block on secretion in wild-type animals with botox injections.
