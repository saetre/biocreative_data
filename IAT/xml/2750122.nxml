Despite recent advances in therapy, the development of therapy-resistant breast cancer cells is a major cause of death. Initial or acquired resistance to endocrine therapy or to trastuzumab (Herceptin) is seen in a majority of patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. These difficulties provide a powerful incentive for further molecular dissection of the processes involved in breast cancer development and therapy.</p><p>Cellular self-destruction through the active gene-dependent process of apoptosis is fundamental to breast epithelial cell physiology. Oestrogen is critical to homeostasis in breast tissue, and high concentrations stimulate cell proliferation and suppress cell death (for example [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]). In healthy breast tissue, lowering of oestrogen concentrations both removes the proliferative stimulus and alleviates the suppression of cell death, resulting in apoptosis. The physiological balance between proliferation and cell death breaks down during the development of breast cancer, and the failure of breast cancer cells to engage the apoptosis programme is crucial for oncogenesis, as is the case for other cancers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>].</p><p>Induction of apoptosis is also critical to the success of breast cancer therapy. Oestrogen blockade by anti-oestrogens lifts the suppression of apoptosis in oestrogen receptor-positive cells, resulting in the elimination of susceptible cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. Many other anticancer therapies act not by direct destruction of the cancer cell, but by producing intracellular damage to which the cell responds through self-destruction by apoptosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. Failure of apoptosis produces drug-resistant cancer cells that can give rise to clinical relapse [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>].</p><p>The central importance of apoptosis in the development and therapy of breast cancer has stimulated many investigations aimed at improving understanding of the process at the molecular level. Such an understanding is essential to provide the rational basis for targeting the molecules that play critical roles in the control of cell death and survival in order to develop novel and effective therapies. Functional expression cloning provides a powerful and proven strategy for the direct identification of molecules controlling cell death through their effects on cell survival. This strategy has successfully identified many genes that play important roles in controlling the cell fate in both healthy tissue and cancers, and has highlighted important mechanisms controlling cancer cell death that had escaped detection by other methods (for example [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]). One gene identified directly through its control of cell death and survival by two independent laboratories is Finkel&#x02013;Biskis&#x02013;Reilly murine sarcoma virus-associated ubiquitously expressed gene (<italic>Fau</italic>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. The Finkel&#x02013;Biskis&#x02013;Reilly murine sarcoma oncogenic virus contains a sequence antisense to <italic>Fau </italic>that increases the tumorigenicity of the virus, suggesting that Fau can act as a tumour suppressor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. Fau induces apoptosis in several cell types and is required for T-cell apoptosis induced by DNA-damaging agents such as UV radiation and cisplatin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. Serial analysis of gene expression has indicated that <italic>Fau </italic>is downregulated early in breast cancer development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>].</p><p>The molecular mechanism of action of Fau involves the transfer of its ubiquitin-like FUBI domain to cellular target proteins as a post-translational modification analogous to other ubiquitin-like modifications, such as SUMO [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. One prominent target for FUBI modification is Bcl-G (Bcl2L14 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]), a member of the Bcl-2 family of apoptosis-controlling proteins that frequently plays an important role in cancer development and therapy (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]). This observation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>] immediately suggests a potential mechanism for the control of apoptosis by Fau; that is, through regulation of the effects of Bcl-G.</p><p>Further attention has been focused on Bcl-G because of its identification [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>] as an important target for maternal embryonic leucine zipper kinase (MELK). MELK is a recently identified protein kinase and candidate oncoprotein that is upregulated in several types of cancer, including breast cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>], and is associated with resistance to apoptosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. Once again, the modification of Bcl-G (in this case by phosphorylation) provides an attractive mechanism of action for the observed pro-survival effects of MELK [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>].</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Breast cancer cell culture</title><p>The human breast cancer cell line T-47D was maintained in MEM (M5650; Sigma, Gillingham, Dorset, UK) supplemented with 5% heat-inactivated FCS, 2 mM <sc>L</sc>-glutamine, 10 &#x003bc;g/ml insulin and 50 &#x003bc;g/ml gentamycin.

For <italic>Fau </italic>knockdown, two different siRNAs were employed, termed FAU1 and FAU2 (Ambion siRNA ID 46005 and ID 10907; target exons 2/3 and 3/4, respectively).

In these experiments, negative control siRNA was used at 30 nM (control for single knockdowns) and at 60 nM (control for combined knockdowns). In all experiments, cells were incubated with siRNAs for 120 hours. For evaluation of transfection efficiency, parallel transfections were conducted with Cy3-labelled siRNA prepared using the Silencer siRNA labelling kit (Ambion), according to the supplied protocol. The proportion of cells exhibiting fluorescence was determined by microscopy 24 hours post transfection. Transfection efficiencies were routinely 80% to 85%.</p></sec><sec><title>UV irradiation and determination of cell viability and apoptosis</title><p>A hand-held UVG-54 lamp (UVP Ltd, Cambridge, UK) was used for irradiation. Radiation from the lamp was routinely measured using a Blak-Ray UV (shortwave) intensity meter (model J-225; UVP Ltd., Cambridge, UK). Trypsinized cells were resuspended at 10<sup>5 </sup>cells/ml medium and were exposed to UVC light in plastic petri dishes with the lids removed for 20/30 seconds at a distance of 25 cm (40/60 J/m<sup>2</sup>) or were mock-irradiated. Immediately after UV exposure, cells were centrifuged and resuspended in the same volume of fresh medium.</p><p>For determination of their colony-forming ability (clonogenic assays), cells (20 &#x003bc;l UVC-irradiated; 5 &#x003bc;l mock-irradiated) were added to 1.5 ml maintenance medium supplemented with 10% (v/v) cell-conditioned medium (prepared from log phase cells) and plated in six-well plates. After 3 weeks of incubation, colonies were stained with crystal violet and were counted. Data are expressed as colonies per 100,000 cells plated.</p><p>For determination of short-term cell viability and apoptosis, cells were plated in 12-well plates (8 &#x000d7; 10<sup>4 </sup>cells/well) in maintenance medium, incubated for 48 hours, and then trypsinized. Cell viability was determined by the nigrosin blue dye exclusion analysis. Apoptosis was determined by fluorescence microscopy; by assessment of either nuclear morphology or caspase activation. For the former assay, cells were stained with acridine orange (25 &#x003bc;g/ml), and the proportion of cells containing condensed or fragmented chromatin was scored. For the latter assay, the CaspaTag&#x02122; Fluorescein Caspase Activity Kit (Chemicon, Chandler's Ford, Hampshire, UK) was used, according to the manufacturer's instructions.</p></sec><sec><title>Real-time RT-PCR</title><p>For cell culture samples, total RNA was isolated using TRIZOL reagent (Invitrogen, Paisley, UK). For clinical samples, paired tumour and adjacent normal breast epithelial tissues were collected from a total of 21 female patients with ductal breast cancer, rapidly frozen and stored at -140&#x000b0;C. All samples were examined histologically, and samples grossly contaminated with adipocytes, or with noncancerous tissue in the case of tumour samples, were excluded from the study. Total RNA was isolated using 1.4 M guanidine thiocyanate/0.5% sodium dodecyl sulphate/25 mM ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid/50 mM Tris&#x02013;Cl (pH 7.5) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. For all samples, isolated RNA was treated with RQ1 RNase-free DNase (Promega, Southampton, Hampshire, UK), and was reverse transcribed using random hexamer priming and SuperScript II Reverse Transcriptase (Invitrogen), according to the supplied protocols. Real-time PCR was conducted using the Sensimix (dT) DNA kit (Quantace, Finchley, London, UK) and Taq Man Gene Expression Assays (assay codes Hs00609872_g1 for Fau, Hs00373302_m1 for Bcl-G, Hs00207681_m1 for MELK, Hs00167441_m1 for ALAS1, and Hs99999901_m1 for 18S; Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA), as recommended by the manufacturers, and was run on an ABI Prism Sequence Detection System model 7000 (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA).</p><p>A standard curve, comprising cDNA prepared from the T-47D parental cell line, was included with each run to allow relative quantitation. Assays usually contained 0.1 to 30 ng standard (approximately threefold serial dilutions) or 5 ng sample cDNA in a final volume of 25 &#x003bc;l. For quantitation of Bcl-G, however, the sample and standard input were increased to 40 ng and 0.6 to 200 ng cDNA, respectively. For each assay, a standard curve of threshold cycle value versus log input standard cDNA was constructed by linear regression, and the equation of the line was used to calculate input amounts of samples from their respective threshold cycle values. Data were expressed relative to an endogenous control gene (Bcl-G sample values were first corrected for increased sample input). ALAS1 was used as the endogenous control gene, since the ALAS1/18S rRNA ratio is similar in breast ductal carcinoma and normal tissue, as described elsewhere [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Data are presented as the mean and standard error of the mean, and statistical significance was determined either by a paired Student's <italic>t </italic>test or by one-way analysis of variance with Bonferroni's multiple comparison test for <italic>post-hoc </italic>analysis of selected groups, as specified in each case, depending upon the number of groups to be compared.

RNA integrity and genomic DNA contamination were analysed using an Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies, Palo Alto, CA, USA). Total RNA was biotin-labelled using the Illumina TotalPrep RNA Amplification kit (Ambion) following the manufacturer's instructions. Biotin-labelled cRNA (1.5 &#x003bc;g) was used for each hybridization on Sentrix Human-6 BeadChips (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA) in accordance with manufacturer's protocol. Illumina gene expression data containing 47,293 features were processed and summarized in the Illumina BeadStudio software. Analyses of the probe level data were performed using the <italic>beadarray </italic>Bioconductor package (Illumina Cambridge, Saffron Walden, Essex, UK).

We therefore analysed the relationship between <italic>MELK </italic>expression levels and breast cancer patient survival in the same cohort of 99 patients used for the study on Fau expression (above). Higher <italic>MELK </italic>expression shows a strong correlation with poor survival in breast cancer patients (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3b</xref>), supporting the suggestion that <italic>MELK </italic>expression is indeed an important factor in the clinical progression of breast cancer.</p><fig position="float" id="F3"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p>Increased MELK transcript levels in breast cancer are associated with poor patient survival. <bold>(a) </bold>RNA was isolated from tumour and adjacent normal tissue (n = 11 patients), was reverse transcribed, and <italic>MELK </italic>and <italic>ALAS1 </italic>transcript levels were determined using Taqman assays and real-time PCR using a relative standard curve protocol (cDNA from T-47D cells as standard).

We therefore used RNA interference to downregulate both <italic>Fau </italic>and <italic>Bcl-G </italic>in breast cancer cells, in order to determine whether they act in the same pathway in these cells. Downregulation of either <italic>Fau </italic>or <italic>Bcl-G </italic>independently had a significant inhibitory effect on UV-induced apoptosis, confirming the importance of both of these molecules in the induction of apoptosis (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>). This effect was clearly demonstrated both by reductions in the proportion of cells staining for active caspases and by increases in the proportion of viable cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4b</xref>). Both graphs also show that the simultaneous downregulation of both Bcl-G and Fau does not produce any additive protection. This is again consistent with both of these genes acting in the same pathway; that is, with the apoptosis-controlling effects of Fau being mediated by Bcl-G.</p><fig position="float" id="F4"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><p><bold>siRNA-mediated knockdown of <italic>Fau </italic>and <italic>Bcl-G </italic>expression attenuates UV-induced apoptosis in breast cancer cells</bold>. siRNA-mediated knockdown of <italic>Fau </italic>and <italic>Bcl-G </italic>expression, either alone or in combination, attenuates UV-induced apoptosis of T-47D breast cancer cells.

Real-time RT-PCR analysis of <italic>Bcl-G </italic>expression in breast cancer samples and matched normal samples indicated that <italic>Bcl-G </italic>expression was indeed reduced in breast cancer samples (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4c</xref>). Analysis of the relationship between <italic>Bcl-G </italic>expression levels and breast cancer patient survival in the cohort of breast cancer patients examined for Fau and MELK (above), however, did not indicate any significant correlation (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4d</xref>). This suggests that the regulation of Bcl-G activity by post-translational modification is more important than the <italic>Bcl-G </italic>expression level itself in determining breast cancer patient survival.</p><p>A notable combination of clinical studies and observations on breast cancer cells <italic>in vitro </italic>converge on the functionally connected Fau, Bcl-G and MELK molecules, and indicate that they are of considerable importance in breast cancer progression. This makes them attractive candidates for use in prognosis, risk prediction and targeted prevention, as for other breast cancer susceptibility genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. <italic>In vitro </italic>studies from our own laboratory (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref> above) and other laboratories [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>] demonstrate that changes in the expression levels of these genes affect breast cancer cell susceptibility to apoptosis, indicating that the cancer-associated changes in gene expression observed are of functional as well as diagnostic importance, and suggesting several targets for cancer therapies. As a protein kinase, MELK is a particularly suitable target for drug therapy, given the mounting successes from specifically inhibiting other kinases in cancer therapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. In addition, the interaction of BH3-only Bcl-2-related proteins such as Bcl-G with other members of the Bcl-2 family is a crucial stage in the induction of apoptosis and can be mimicked with small molecular weight candidate drug molecules [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>], emphasizing the clinical importance of the investigation of these interactions for breast cancer treatment.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>The functionally inter-connected proteins Fau, Bcl-G and MELK play critical roles in the control of apoptosis that are central to breast cancer development and therapy. Reduced expression of candidate tumour suppressor <italic>Fau </italic>in breast cancer cells is associated with poor patient survival. Increased expression of candidate oncogene <italic>MELK </italic>is also associated with poor prognosis. Both Fau and MELK act, at least in part, through covalent modification of apoptosis controller Bcl-G.</p></sec><sec><title>Abbreviations</title><p>Fau: Finkel&#x02013;Biskis&#x02013;Reilly murine sarcoma virus-associated ubiquitously expressed gene; FCS: foetal calf serum; FUBI: Fau ubiquitin-like domain; MELK: maternal embryonic leucine zipper kinase; MEM: minimal essential Eagle's medium; PCR: polymerase chain reaction; RT: reverse transcriptase; siRNA: small interfering RNA.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>MRP performed the <italic>in vitro </italic>studies and statistical analyses, and drafted the manuscript.
