Upon Wingless&#x0002f;Wnt signalling, <bold>&#x003b2;</bold>-catenin translocates to the nucleus, interacts with Tcf (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke263c1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke263c3">3</xref>) and thus activates transcription of target genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke263c4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke263c5">5</xref>). Tcf factors also interact with members of the Groucho (Grg&#x0002f;TLE) family of transcriptional co-repressors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke263c6">6</xref>). We have now tested all known mammalian Groucho family members for their ability to interact specifically with individual Tcf&#x0002f;Lef family members. Transcriptional activation by any Tcf could be repressed by Grg-1, Grg-2&#x0002f;TLE-2, Grg-3 and Grg-4 in a reporter assay. Specific interactions between Tcf and Grg proteins may be achieved <italic>in vivo</italic> by tissue- or cell type-limited expression. To address this, we determined the expression of all Tcf and Grg&#x0002f;TLE family members in a panel of cell lines. Within any cell line, several Tcfs and TLEs are co-expressed. Thus, redundancy in Tcf&#x0002f;Grg interactions appears to be the rule. The &#x02018;long&#x02019; Groucho family members containing five domains are repressors of Tcf-mediated transactivation, whereas Grg-5, which only contains the first two domains, acts as a de-repressor. As previously shown for <italic>Drosophila</italic> Groucho, we show that long Grg proteins interact with histone deacetylase-1. Although Grg-5 contains the GP homology domain that mediates HDAC binding in long Grg proteins, Grg-5 fails to bind this co-repressor, explaining how it can de-repress transcription.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Recent studies have demonstrated that members of the Tcf&#x0002f;Lef family of HMG box transcription factors are important downstream effectors of the Wnt&#x0002f;Wingless signalling cascade in mammalian, <italic>Xenopus</italic>, <italic>Drosophila</italic> and <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke263c7">7</xref>). In the absence of a Wnt signal, &#x003b2;-catenin associates with Axin, APC and GSK-3&#x003b2; in the cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke263c8">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke263c10">10</xref>). In this complex, &#x003b2;-catenin is phosphorylated by GSK-3&#x003b2;, resulting in ubiquitous degradation of &#x003b2;-catenin by the proteasome pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke263c11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke263c12">12</xref>). Wnt signalling results in inhibition of GSK-3&#x003b2;, leading to the accumulation of &#x003b2;-catenin in the cytoplasm and its translocation to the nucleus. Association of &#x003b2;-catenin with Tcf in the nucleus leads to the formation of a bipartite transcription factor activating target gene expression, such as the genes encoding cyclin D1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke263c5">5</xref>), Tcf-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke263c13">13</xref>) and PPAR&#x003b4; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke263c14">14</xref>).</p><p> Experiments in <italic>Drosophila</italic> and <italic>Xenopus</italic> indicated that Tcf molecules could also function as transcriptional repressors in the absence of a Wnt&#x0002f;Wingless signal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke263c15">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke263c18">18</xref>). Several recent studies have proposed a molecular basis for this phenomenon. Tcf can associate with a number of different transcriptional co-repressors. Binding of Tcf with CBP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke263c19">19</xref>) or CtBP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke263c20">20</xref>) can lead to repression of the Wnt&#x0002f;Wingless response. We and others have shown that the co-repressor Groucho and its vertebrate homologues can bind to Tcf. The association of Tcf and Groucho results in repression of Tcf targets both in the context of synthetic promoters and of endogenous genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke263c6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke263c21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke263c22">22</xref>).</p><p> The vertebrate Tcf family of transcription factors consists of four members: Tcf-1, Lef-1, Tcf-3 and Tcf-4 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke263f1">1</xref>A). Studies have indicated that Tcf-1 is preferentially expressed in cells of the T cell lineage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke263c23">23</xref>). Inactivation of the Tcf-1 gene by homologous recombination results in mice with a block in T cell development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke263c24">24</xref>). Lef-1 is expressed in pre-B and T cells in adult mice, and mainly in the neural crest, mesencephalon, tooth germs and whisker follicles during embryogenesis. Lef-1-deficient mice die shortly after birth and lack teeth, mammary glands, whiskers and hair, but show no defects in lymphoid cell populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke263c25">25</xref>). T cell development in mice lacking both Tcf-1 and Lef-1 is completely arrested and impaired at an earlier stage than in mice lacking only Tcf-1, revealing that Tcf-1 and Lef-1 are partially redundant in the regulation of T cell development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke263c26">26</xref>). Tcf-3 is expressed in stomach epithelium, hair follicles and keratinocytes of the skin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke263c28">28</xref>). Tcf-4 expression occurs much later in embryogenesis than Tcf-1, Lef-1 or Tcf-3 and is most highly expressed in the midbrain and in intestinal and mammary epithelium. Tcf-4 exhibits a highly restricted expression pattern in the epithelium of the developing gut (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke263c27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke263c28">28</xref>). Continued Tcf-4 expression at this site is essential for the maintenance of the progenitor compartment of gut epithelium, as indicated in Tcf-4-deficient mice by the abnormal development of their small intestines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke263c29">29</xref>). Constitutively active Tcf-4&#x02013;&#x003b2;-catenin complexes are found in the nuclei of colon carcinoma cells with mutations in APC or &#x003b2;-catenin (30). Presumably this results in the uncontrolled activation of Tcf target genes, which by implication transforms colon epithelial cells and initiates polyp formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke263c31">31</xref>).</p><p><italic> Drosophila</italic> Groucho is the founding member of a conserved family of transcriptional co-repressors. Other members of this family are found in diverse organisms, from <italic>C.elegans</italic> to vertebrates. The murine and human genomes harbour four full-length homologues of Groucho, as well as a gene that encodes a truncated Groucho protein. The human Groucho homologues are termed TLE-1, -2, -3 and -4 (for transducin-like enhancer of split) and the truncated variant hAES (for amino-terminal enhancer of split). The mouse Groucho family consists of the Groucho-related genes, <italic>Grg-1</italic>, <italic>-2</italic>, <italic>-3</italic><italic>and</italic><italic>-4</italic> and the <italic>Grg-5</italic> gene encoding a shorter variant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke263c32">32</xref>). The Grg&#x0002f;TLE proteins are highly similar to <italic>Drosophila</italic> Groucho in their domain structure. They contain five protein domains: an N-terminal Q (glutamine-rich) domain, followed by a GP (glycine&#x0002f;proline-rich) domain, a CCN domain (containing putative casein kinase II&#x0002f;cdc2 phosphorylation sites and nuclear localisation signal), an SP (serine&#x0002f;proline-rich) domain and four WD40 repeats (protein interaction domain) (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke263f1">1</xref>B). Of these, the Q and WD40 domain sequences are most highly conserved. <italic>Grg-5</italic> and <italic>hAES</italic> encode only the two N-terminal domains of these proteins, the Q and GP domains. Groucho-related proteins have been described to tetramerise through a leucine zipper-like structure in the N-terminal Q domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke263c33">33</xref>).</p><p> Groucho proteins function as co-repressors for specific subsets of DNA-binding transcription factors, including the Hairy-related proteins, Runt domain proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke263c35">35</xref>), Engrailed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke263c34">34</xref>), Dorsal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke263c46">46</xref>), Pax-5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke263c36">36</xref>), NK-3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke263c37">37</xref>), NK-4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke263c38">38</xref>), NF-&#x003ba;B (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke263c38">38</xref>) and HNF3&#x003b2; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke263c39">39</xref>). For some of these transcription factors, the domain that interacts with Groucho is mapped to a short peptide motif. Hairy-related bHLH transcription factors are involved in diverse developmental processes such as sex determination, segmentation, neurogenesis and myogenesis in the fly. The C-terminal WRPW motif of these bHLH transcription factors binds to the SP domain of Groucho, although the WD40 domain may also be involved (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke263c34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke263c40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke263c41">41</xref>). Runt domain proteins like <italic>Drosophila</italic> Runt and human AML1 associate with Groucho proteins through a related motif, VWPRY (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke263c35">35</xref>). Another conserved Groucho interaction motif is found in a number of transcription factors such as Engrailed and Goosecoid, which associate with Groucho through their eh1&#x0002f;GEH domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke263c34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke263c42">42</xref>). Engrailed has been shown to interact with the WD40 domain of Groucho (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke263c43">43</xref>). Some of these transcription factors have been described only to repress transcription dependent on Groucho for their activity, such as Hairy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke263c40">40</xref>), HES (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke263c44">44</xref>) and Blimp-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke263c45">45</xref>). Others, like Tcf (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke263c6">6</xref>), Runt (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke263c35">35</xref>) and Dorsal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke263c46">46</xref>), are activators and convert to repressors upon association with Groucho-related proteins.</p><p> The <italic>Drosophila</italic> histone deacetylase Rpd3 has been shown to interact with Groucho (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke263c47">47</xref>). Recruitment of Rpd3 to the promotor of target genes will result in modulation of the local chromatin structure. Histone deacetylases remove acetyl groups from lysine residues in the N-terminal tails of core histones. By mechanisms that are not yet fully understood, this appears to result in a more compact chromatin structure that is associated with a repressed transcriptional state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke263c48">48</xref>).</p><p> The current study characterises the Tcf&#x0002f;Groucho interaction in more detail. We describe the (co-)expression of individual Tcf and Grg&#x0002f;TLE family members in a panel of cell lines. In addition, we have mapped the Tcf interaction domain of Grg proteins and analysed whether there is specificity in the interaction between individual Tcf and TLE family members. Deletion analysis of <italic>Xenopus</italic> Grg-4 (XGrg-4) showed that only the first two domains, Q and GP, are sufficient to repress Tcf-mediated transcriptional activation. However, Grg-5, which contains the same, highly conserved domains, functions as a de-repressor. To determine the basis of the opposing functions of the truncated XGrg-4-QGP and XGrg-5 we examined their relative ability to interact with the human homologue of RPD3 (HDAC-1).</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Transfections and luciferase assays</title><p>IIAI.6 B cells (2.5 &#x000d7; 10<sup>6</sup>) were transfected by electroporation with various combinations of a luciferase reporter plasmid containing three optimal Tcf sites upstream of the minimal HSV-TK promoter (1 &#x000b5;g of pTKTOP) or its negative control vector containing mutated Tcf sites (pTKFOP) in combination with the following plasmids: an internal transfection control (50 ng of pRNL-TK; Promega); <italic>Tcf</italic> expression vectors (2 &#x000b5;g); <italic>Grg</italic> expression plasmids (0.5 or 5.0 &#x000b5;g); &#x003b2;<italic>-</italic>catenin expression plasmid (5.0 &#x000b5;g).

Grg proteins can also tetramerise through their Q domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke263c33">33</xref>). We used the yeast two-hybrid assay to more precisely map the domain of Grg that interacts with Tcf versus the domain that is responsible for multimerization with other Grg molecules (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke263f2">2</xref>). Constructs expressing different parts of Grg-5 were fused to the Gal-4 activation domain and their interaction with Tcf-1 (4-359) and Grg-5 (1-197) fused to the Gal-4 DNA binding domain was determined. The results shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke263f2">2</xref> imply that the Tcf interaction domain resides in the first 106 amino acids of Grg-5. All other deletion constructs of Grg-5 failed to interact with Tcf. Our data indicate this N-terminal region also contains the Grg interaction domain, in accordance with the domain previously described to mediate tetramerisation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke263c33">33</xref>). Further truncation of this region probably prevents proper folding of the tetramerisation domain and thereby results in loss of the interaction with both Grg and Tcf.</p></sec><sec><title>Repression of TCF-mediated transcription by Groucho-related genes</title><p>To further investigate the issue of specificity in the interaction between different Tcf family members and Grg proteins, we used the previously established &#x003b2;-catenin&#x02013;Tcf reporter gene assay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke263c1">1</xref>). In this assay co-transfection of Tcf and &#x003b2;-catenin results in transactivation of a luciferase reporter gene, which we previously demonstrated could be repressed by introduction of Groucho (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke263c6">6</xref>).

For <italic>Tcf-3</italic> we used the <italic>Xenopus</italic> homologue (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke263f3">3</xref>C) because human <italic>Tcf-3</italic> proved difficult to express (data not shown). Identical transfections were carried out using a reporter with mutated Tcf sites. A <italic>Renilla </italic>luciferase vector was also transfected to correct for transfection efficiency. &#x0005b;Note that the B cell line used for these assays expresses moderate levels of both <italic>Grg-1</italic> and <italic>Grg-4</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke263c6">6</xref>)&#x0005d;. These experiments show that all different Grg proteins can repress transcriptional activation mediated by all Tcf family members. Grg-1 and Grg-4 appear to be more potent repressors than Grg-3 and TLE-2. In this assay, the Tcf proteins show differences in transactivation capacity: <italic>hTcf-1</italic> and <italic>Lef-1</italic> transactivate more strongly than <italic>XTcf-3</italic> and <italic>hTcf-4</italic>, but for all Tcf family members repression is observed upon co-transfection with the different Groucho homologues.</p></sec><sec><title>Expression of the different Tcf and TLE family members in a panel of cell lines</title><p>We examined whether there was any specificity in the interaction between Tcf and TLE proteins based on their expression pattern in a panel of cell lines. Two B cell lines (Reh and Raji) and two T cell lines (Cem and Jurkat) were tested, as well as a number of colon carcinoma cell lines (HCT116, LS174, HT29, DLD-1, SW480, SW620 and RKO) and two mammary carcinoma cell lines (T47D and SKBR3). In colon carcinoma cell lines the Wnt signalling cascade is constitutively activated. In all but one (RKO) of these colon carcinoma cell lines, mutations in either APC or &#x003b2;-catenin have been identified. Absence of TLE expression in the RKO cell line could potentially account for activation of the pathway in this cell line.</p><p> RNA was isolated from the above cell lines and first strand cDNA was prepared by RT. This cDNA was used as a template in PCR to assay for the expression of the different Tcf and TLE family members (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke263f4">4</xref>). As a negative control, reverse transcriptase was omitted from the RT reaction. PCR for the different Tcf and Grg family members was carried out. A GAPDH PCR served as an internal control for the quality of the prepared cDNA. The PCR products were designed to be of different sizes to distinguish between the different family members. A product of each PCR was sequenced to confirm the identity of the amplified product and to exclude any cross-reactivity between family members (data not shown).</p><p> Expression of <italic>hTCF-1</italic> was detected in all cell lines tested except in the B cell lines. In the cell lines where <italic>hTCF-1</italic> is expressed, a very faint band was also observed running more slowly in the gel. This corresponds to a splice variant of <italic>Tcf-1</italic> containing an extra exon, as described earlier (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke263c41">41</xref>). <italic>hLEF-1</italic> expression was found in Reh, CEM, Jurkat, 293T, LS174T, DLD-1, SW480, SW620, RKO and T47D. It was known previously to be expressed in pre-B and T cells and several other cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke263c25">25</xref>), but apparently it is not expressed in all colon or mammary carcinoma cell lines. The two different products present in most <italic>hLEF-1</italic>-expressing cell lines correspond to the presence of two different splice variants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke263c50">50</xref>), as was confirmed by sequencing (data not shown). <italic>hTCF-3</italic> expression was restricted to Jurkat, 293T, some colon carcinoma cell lines (HCT116, DLD-1, SW480 and SW620) and both mammary carcinoma cell lines T47D and SKBR3. For this family member, a more restricted expression pattern was expected since <italic>hTCF-3</italic> is mainly expressed during early embryogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke263c28">28</xref>). <italic>hTCF-4</italic> is expressed ubiquitously in all cell lines tested.</p><p> The expression of the Groucho family members also showed a relatively broad pattern. Within the panel of cell lines, only the expression pattern of <italic>hTLE-2</italic> was restricted, being expressed only in Reh, Jurkat, HCT-116, RKO, T47D and SKBR-3. For<italic> hAES</italic>, <italic>hTLE-1</italic>, <italic>hTLE-3</italic> and <italic>hTLE-4</italic>, a broad expression pattern was observed. <italic>hAES</italic> is expressed in all cell lines tested but at a low level in Raji, 293T and T47D. <italic>hTLE-1</italic> is only absent in Raji and SW620 cell lines. <italic>hTLE-4</italic> is present in all cell lines of this panel with the exception of HCT116 and LS174T. <italic>hTLE-3</italic> is present in all cell lines in this panel. Corresponding with this broad TLE expression in cell lines, it has been shown that the TLE proteins are also broadly expressed in adult tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke263c51">51</xref>).</p><p> These data show that a number of diverse cell lines all express multiple Tcf and TLE family members. This indicates that the pattern of expression does not contribute to a possible specificity of interaction between Tcf and TLE molecules. It does imply, however, that two or more Groucho repressor proteins are normally available for a tight control over the Tcf transcriptional activation pathway, since deregulation of this pathway can result in tumourigenesis, as has been shown for colon carcinoma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke263c31">31</xref>) and melanoma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke263c52">52</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Domains of Grg required for repression of Tcf-mediated transactivation and dependency on HDAC interaction</title><p>Deletion constructs of XGrg-4 were tested for their ability to repress Tcf-mediated transcriptional activation (data not shown). The minimal construct of <italic>Xenopus</italic> Grg-4 (XGrg-4) required for repression consists of only the first two N-terminal domains. This truncation of XGrg-4, consisting of amino acids 1&#x02013;197, encodes the Q domain, involved in tetramerisation and interaction with Tcf, and the GP domain, essential for interaction with the histone deacetylase-1, HDAC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke263c53">53</xref>). This construct is highly homologous to Grg-5, which is comprised of only the Q and GP domains, but functions as a de-repressor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke263c6">6</xref>) (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke263f5">5</xref>A). In Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke263f5">5</xref>B, an alignment of the GP domains of mGrg-1, mGrg-3, XGrg-4 and mGrg-5 is depicted, showing the high homology between these proteins. The amino acids unique for Grg-5 are indicated in bold.</p><p> Cells were transfected with the Tcf reporter construct (TK-TOP), XTcf-3 and different amounts of Armadillo (the <italic>Drosophila</italic> homologue of &#x003b2;-catenin). XGrg-4-QGP consistently repressed transcription, while Grg-5 enhanced the Armadillo-mediated transactivation (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke263f5">5</xref>C).</p><p> The GP domains of proteins of the Groucho family are highly conserved, and this domain is involved in interaction with HDAC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke263c53">53</xref>). The subtle differences between the GP domain of the long Groucho homologues and the GP domain of the shorter variants like Grg-5 are possibly responsible for these antagonistic functions (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke263f5">5</xref>B). To address this, the interaction of HDAC with XGrg-4-QGP and mGrg-5 was studied in immunoprecipitation experiments (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke263f6">6</xref>). Flag-HDAC-1 construct was co-transfected with the Myc-tagged Grg constructs of mGrg-5 and the truncated XGrg-4-QGP. Cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-Myc antibody and protein A&#x02013;G beads. The presence of HDAC was assayed on an immunoblot using the Flag antibody. Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke263f6">6</xref>A shows that precipitation of Myc-tagged Grg-5 and XGrg-4-QGP results in co-precipitation of HDAC with XGrg-4-QGP (lane 3) but not with Grg-5 (lane 4), although HDAC expression in the lysate of the cells co-transfected with mGrg-5 and HDAC-1 is apparent (lane 5). Lanes 6 and 7 show that the two Myc-tagged Grg constructs were immunoprecipitated with similar affinity. Similar results are obtained when Flag-tagged HDAC is immunoprecipitated and the presence of mGrg-5 and XGrg-4 QGP is assayed (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke263f6">6</xref>B). Precipitation of Flag-tagged HDAC co-precipitates XGrg-4-QGP but not Grg-5 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke263f6">6</xref>B, lanes 3 and 4, respectively). Association of HDAC with full-length Grg-3 was also observed (data not shown).</p><p> These data show that the long, repressive vertebrate Groucho homologues readily associate with HDAC-1, as was described previously in the fly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke263c53">53</xref>). The de-repressor Grg-5, however, does not bind HDAC, explaining why Grg-5 does not function as a repressor.</p><p> Grg-5 may function to fine-tune the repression mediated by Groucho family members. In one possible model, Grg-5 would associate with long repressive Grg proteins and thereby decrease the amount of HDAC that is tethered to the template, reducing the level of repression. Alternatively, Grg-5 could bind directly to a subclass of transcription factors interacting with the first two domains of Groucho and prevent long Grg family members associating with such factors, abrogating repression entirely (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke263f7">7</xref>). The precise activation status of a given transcription factor interacting with Groucho proteins <italic>in vivo</italic> would be partially determined by the mutual antagonism between long and short forms, the balance of which could be influenced by protein expression levels, subcellular distribution or post-translational modifications of Groucho proteins.</p><p> We find no specificity in the interactions between the different members of the Tcf and Groucho families. Every cell line tested expresses several TLE and Tcf family members. Furthermore, reporter assays reveal that any long Grg can repress any given Tcf, suggesting that all partners are capable of interacting <italic>in vivo</italic>. The abundance of Groucho molecules and the redundancy with which they interact with Tcf proteins probably highlights the requirement to silence target gene expression adequately, in order to prevent unrestrained cell growth and&#x0002f;or aberrant differentiation, hallmarks of cancer cells. It still remains a possibility that some specificity is achieved by other means not identified in this study. For example, TLE phosphorylation may influence their repressive activity, since Cdc2 and casein kinase II consensus sites are found in the Grg&#x0002f;TLE sequences and it has previously been shown that the TLE phosphorylation pattern changes during differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke263c54">54</xref>).</p><p> The mechanism of Groucho-mediated repression remained unclear until recently, when it was shown that Groucho functionally interacts with the histone deacetylase Rpd3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke263c53">53</xref>). Recruitment of Rpd3 to a target promoter would result in modification of local chromatin structure and, consequently, the formation of a more compact chromatin structure, associated with a repressed transcriptional state. This is likely the main mechanism through which Groucho-related proteins exert their function, although other data indicate that an additional mechanism of repression may exist. When different Grg constructs are tethered to a Gal4 DNA binding domain, domains capable of mediating repression are also found outside the GP domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke263c40">40</xref>) Moreover, when Groucho-mediated repression is assayed in the presence of the HDAC inhibitor trichostatin A, some residual repression activity remains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke263c53">53</xref>). When the histone deacetylase RPD3 in <italic>Drosophila</italic> is mutated, only mild defects are observed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke263c55">55</xref>). All these studies suggest that HDAC is an important, but not the sole, mediator of transcriptional repression. Further study of the mechanism of Groucho-mediated repression will address these subjects in the future.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="display-objects"><title>Figures and Tables</title><fig id="gke263f1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p> Domain structure of (<bold>A</bold>) Tcf and (<bold>B</bold>) Grg constructs.
