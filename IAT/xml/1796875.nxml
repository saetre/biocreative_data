Perhaps the best-studied systems for the establishment of neuronal phenotypes in vertebrates are the primary input (sensory) and output (motor) pathways of the peripheral sensory ganglia, spinal cord, and brainstem. In these areas, several key transcriptional regulators have been identified, many of which are members of the basic-helix-loop-helix (bHLH) and homeodomain transcription factor classes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>].</p><p>The peripheral sensory nervous system is organized anatomically according to the nature of the external information reported to the central nervous system (CNS). The sensory modalities of pain, touch, temperature and proprioception are transduced by sensory neurons innervating the skin and musculoskeletal structures, and are referred to as general somatic sensation. Peripheral sensory neurons also convey the senses of taste and hearing, and visceral sensation, which reports the state of the internal organs. At spinal levels, general somatic sensation is conveyed by the dorsal root or spinal ganglia (DRG), while in the anterior head and face, these sensory modalities are mediated by the trigeminal ganglion (TG).</p><p>Surprisingly, in spite of the similar functions of the DRG and TG, these ganglia have rather different embryological origins. The DRG are formed entirely from spinal neural crest. In contrast, the TG is formed in part from the ophthalmic and maxillo-mandibular placodes originating in the surface ectoderm, as well as cranial neural crest cells derived from rhombomere 2, which migrate and condense to form the ganglion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. The trigeminal system also includes a population of sensory neurons that reside outside the anatomical ganglion, the mesencephalic trigeminal (mesV), the exact origin of which is still somewhat controversial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. The developmental mechanisms that lead to the differentiation of functionally similar populations of neurons from these different embryological sources are not well understood.</p><p>Transcriptional regulators of sensory development may be broadly divided into early factors that are essential for neurogenesis, pan-sensory factors that begin to be expressed around the time of cell-cycle exit, and late factors that characterize specific sensory subtypes. In mice, the proneural bHLH factors Ngn1 and Ngn2 are expressed transiently from embryonic day 8.5 in cranial sensory precursors and have been shown to have a crucial role in neurogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. Around the time of ganglion condensation and cell cycle exit, beginning at E9.5&#x02013;10.5, nearly all sensory neurons at both spinal and cranial levels co-express the homeodomain transcription factors Brn3a and Islet1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Later in development, factors associated with the development of specific sensory subtypes include the runt family factors Runx1 and Runx3, the variant homeodomain protein Prrxl1/DRG11, and the Ets family member Etv1/Er81 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>].</p><p>Studies of Brn3a knockout mice have shown that this factor is required for correct axon growth, target innervation, and survival of TG and DRG neurons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. Microarray studies of the developing TG of Brn3a null mice have shown that Brn3a is required for a complex program of sensory gene expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. In the present study, we examine the role of Brn3a in sensory neurogenesis at truncal and cranial levels. In normal mice, the developing DRG and TG have very similar patterns of global gene expression. The loss of Brn3a expression in the developing DRG leads to marked changes in the expression of specific neurotransmitters, receptors, developmental regulators, mediators of signal transduction, and transcription factors. Many of these changes are conserved between the TG and DRG of Brn3a knockout mice, but certain transcripts are markedly increased only in the cranial ganglia. The promoter regions of these normally silent but differentially regulated genes are hyperacetylated only in the TG, which may indicate a latent state of 'expressability' that can differ between spinal and cranial levels. Thus, a key developmental role of Brn3a may be to repress potential differences in gene expression between developing DRG and TG neurons, and thus promote the generation of functionally similar populations of neurons from different embryological sources.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Global gene expression is highly conserved in sensory neurons from different axial levels</title><p>To begin to compare the molecular program of sensory neuron development at spinal and cranial levels, we performed global analysis of gene expression in the developing DRG and TG. E13.5 was chosen for this comparison because, at this stage, most of the neurons of the DRG and TG have exited the cell cycle and have begun to express definitive markers of neurogenesis. Because sensory neurons have conserved functions at spinal and cranial levels, we hypothesized that the global pattern of gene expression in the DRG would be much more similar to the TG than to other neural tissues. Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref> illustrates a comparison of gene expression in the DRG to a replicate analysis from the same tissue, to the TG, and to the embryonic neocortex. These results show a high degree of overall similarity in gene expression between the sensory ganglia from different axial levels, and confirm that there is much greater divergence between the patterns of gene expression in the DRG and the developing cerebral cortex.</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Analysis of global gene expression in embryonic neural tissue.

Greater expression in the DRG: confirmation of selected results by in situ hybridization and immunofluorescence appears in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">additional file 1</xref>. Differential expression of Ramp2 could not be confirmed by ISH. Different levels of Zic1 and follistatin appear to be due to high expression in the spinal cord adjacent to the DRG, rather than the DRG itself. Sostdc1 and EDNRB showed increased DRG expression by ISH but in a pattern more characteristic of glial than neuronal expression, with signal concentrated in nerve roots. The expression of RGS4 in the developing sensory ganglia has been previously described [43], and its higher expression in the DRG at E13.5 appears to be due to the dynamic developmental regulation of this gene, rather than a persisting difference in expression between the DRG and TG. Greater expression in the TG: <italic>in situ </italic>hybridization confirmed some changes (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">additional file 1</xref>). However, Mfap4 was widely expressed in embryonic tissues. Socs3 ISH exhibited relatively greater expression in the TG, but overall expression levels were low. Differential expression of the supressor of cytokine signaling Socs3 in the TG and DRG has previously been noted [44].</p></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap><p>Aside from the Hox factors, the transcript with the greatest relative expression in the DRG was Etv1, an Ets-family transcription factor expressed in 1a muscle spindle afferents [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. Immunofluorescence for Etv1 expression in the E13.5 DRG confirmed expression in sensory neurons of large and intermediate size, whilst expression was entirely absent in the TG at this stage (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2a, b</xref>). In contrast, expression of Runx3, an earlier and more general marker of proprioceptive neurons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>], was noted in both the DRG and TG at E13.5 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2c, d</xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="F2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p>Selective expression of proprioceptor markers in the DRG and trigeminal system.

In the DRG, one population of Etv1-expressing neurons displayed large soma and nuclei consistent with 1a proprioceptors. However, in the TG nearly all of the Etv1-expressing neurons were of intermediate size, and large Etv1-positive neurons consistent with 1a proprioceptors were rare. In both the DRG and the TG, this intermediate-sized and later-developing population of Etv1-expressing sensory neurons could be further distinguished from the 1a proprioceptors by the co-expression of Islet2 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2e, f</xref>).</p><p>One distinguishing feature of the TG is that a subset of neurons that are functionally part of the trigeminal system, the mesV, is located within the CNS.

Among mediators of neurotransmission, multiple glutamate receptors (Gria3, Gria4, Grik1), a GABA transporter (Slc6a1), a serotonin receptor (Htr3a) and the neuropeptide somatostatin are increased, while a GABA receptor (Gabra2) and neuropeptides with specific sensory roles (Galanin, Adcyap1/PACAP) are decreased. Also reduced is latexin, a secreted carboxypepidase inhibitor with a role in nociception [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>].</p><p>Profound changes were also observed in genes that encode known or potential mediators of sensory neurogenesis, and axon growth or guidance. Increased transcripts in this class included the cell adhesion molecule Chl1, which has a known role in the growth of cortical dendrites [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>], and Nel-like 2, an epidermal growth factor (EGF)-repeat containing factor with a previously demonstrated role in sensory development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. Increased expression was also noted for several molecules with known or likely roles in axon guidance, including Disabled1, Sema3c, Sema3d, f-spondin, Cadherin22, Protocadherin 8, Protocadherin 17, Dcc, and NetrinG1. Decreased expression was noted for advillin, an actin binding protein that is a known mediator of sensory neurite outgrowth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>], as well as Ncam2 and Eph receptor A7. These changes suggest that the profound defects observed in the sensory axons of Brn3a null mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>] result from the derangement of a coordinated program of expression of mediators of axon growth and guidance, rather than from a single molecular lesion.</p><p>Loss of Brn3a also resulted in significant changes in the expression of other transcription factors. Notably, deletion of Brn3a effectively resulted in a triple-knockout of the Pou4 homeodomain class, because Pou4f2 (Brn3b) expression is nearly eliminated, and Pou4f3 (Brn3c) expression is greatly reduced in Brn3a knockout ganglia. Marked decreases were also observed in specific markers of sensory neuron subclasses, including Prrxl1/DRG11, Runx1 and Runx3. In contrast, specific bHLH genes, including those encoding NeuroD1, NeuroD6, Msc, and Nhlh2, were increased, and, perhaps consistent with this, the inhibitory bHLH factor Id1, which can act to oppose the action of neurogenic bHLH genes, was decreased. The significance of some of these changes in the hierarchy of gene regulation in developing sensory neurons is discussed below.</p><p>Loss of Brn3a expression resulted in increased expression of essentially all of the anterior <italic>HoxA</italic>, <italic>HoxB </italic>and <italic>HoxC </italic>genes, and the changes reached statistical significance (<italic>p </italic>&#x0003c; 0.005 or <italic>p </italic>&#x0003e; 0.995, Materials and Methods) for seven genes in this group (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>).

However, results from the more advanced microarray used in the present study (Affymetrix 430) cannot be compared directly to the prior TG data derived from an older array (Affymetrix U74v2). To make such a comparison, we performed an additional analysis of these E13.5 DRG samples with the U74v2 array. We also updated the interpretation of the results for the TG U74v2 dataset using annotations from Build 34 of the mouse genome. This analysis confirmed that the DRG and TG of E13.5 Brn3a knockout mice have many conserved changes in gene expression (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S3">additional file 3</xref>). Transcripts increased in both the DRG and TG of Brn3a knockout mice include the bHLH transcription factors musculin and NeuroD1, the neurotransmitters/receptors somatostatin, CCK-receptor A, 5HT-receptor 3A, and GABA-transporter 1, and the growth factor FIGF/VEGF-D.

The most profound differences were observed for a set of genes markedly increased in the TG of Brn3a knockout embryos, and unchanged in the DRG (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>). These differentially regulated genes include those encoding the transcription factors Tcfap2b (Ap2&#x003b2;), NeuroD4 (Math3) and Gata3, the calcium binding protein Calb2 (calretinin) and the small GTP-binding protein Rab3b. These results led us to consider possible mechanisms for cell-specific target gene regulation by Brn3a in these two closely related neural tissues.</p><fig position="float" id="F6"><label>Figure 6</label><caption><p>Trigeminal-specific targets of Brn3a regulation. <bold>(a) </bold>TG data from a previously published data set [20]. <bold>(b) </bold>DRG data from the present study.

However, with the exception of the Hox factors, the very similar gene expression profiles of the DRG and TG do not suggest many candidates for distinct Brn3a partners in these neurons. In addition, the loss of Brn3a effectively eliminates expression of all Pou4 class factors in both the DRG and TG, making selective redundancy unlikely.</p><p>One approach to understanding the cell-specific effects of the loss of Brn3a expression is suggested by recent work in which we have demonstrated a correlation between Brn3a binding to its target sites <italic>in vivo </italic>and H3-acetylation in the vicinity of the potential binding sites [[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>] in press]. Given these results, one potential mechanism for the differential regulation of target genes by Brn3a might be distinct modifications of chromatin at the target gene loci in the DRG and TG, which could modulate the effects of Brn3a or downstream regulatory factors. To examine this question for the differentially regulated loci Tcfap2b, NeuroD4 and Gata3, we used chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) to profile histone H3 acetylation in wild-type E13.5 DRG and TG (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>). We also examined the Msc locus as an example of a gene that shows similarly increased expression in the DRG and TG of Brn3a knockout mice. ChIP assays of the promoter regions of three constitutively expressed genes, <italic>Gapdh</italic>, <italic>Mapt </italic>(tau), and <italic>Eno2 </italic>(neuron specific enolase), were used as positive controls, and the results were normalized to negative control assays from the promoter region of the <italic>Alb1 </italic>(albumin) gene, which is not expressed in the nervous system. Because the genomic sequences that regulate these genes in the sensory ganglia have not been defined, we surveyed histone acetylation across these loci using multiple oligonucleotide pairs spaced at 500 to 1,000 base-pair (bp) intervals from approximately -10 kb to +15 kb relative to the start of transcription, using quantitative real-time PCR ('locus-ChIP') ["locus-ChIP", [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>] in press].</p><fig position="float" id="F7"><label>Figure 7</label><caption><p>Acetyl-histone H3 profiling of Brn3a target gene loci.

As expected, the positive control promoters were highly acetylated, and the negative control, <italic>Alb1</italic>, was deacetylated in both the DRG and TG. Thus, the state of H3-acetylation in wild-type ganglia appears to be correlated both with basal expression and also with a state of latent potential expression that can be induced in Brn3a null ganglia.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>Numerous transcription factors have been shown to play key roles in the differentiation of brainstem, spinal, and spinal sensory neurons, yet, for the most part, the programs of gene expression regulated by these factors remain unknown. A layer of complexity is added to the analysis of the downstream targets of these factors by the fact that their expression patterns are often very complex, and may include diverse classes of neurons and non-neuronal cell types with no obvious common characteristics. Brn3a, for example, is expressed in a majority of differentiating peripheral sensory neurons, and also in specific neurons of the spinal cord, olivo-cerebellar system, midbrain, diencephalon and retina. The LIM-domain transcription factor Islet1 is co-expressed with Brn3a in the sensory system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>], but in the CNS it is expressed primarily in motor neurons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>], and also has important roles in the development of the heart [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>] and pancreatic islet cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. A fundamental unanswered question is whether these factors, and many others with expression patterns of similar complexity, regulate the same downstream targets in different neuronal types, and in neurons versus non-neuronal cells.</p><p>To better understand the molecular pathways of sensory development, we initiated the present study by examining global gene expression in the brachial-level DRG and TG at E13.5. At this stage, when essentially all sensory neurons have exited the cell cycle and markers of sensory subtypes are beginning to be expressed, the gene expression patterns of the DRG and TG are quite similar. Some transcripts exhibit quantitative differences between the ganglia, which may represent relative differences in cellular composition or the timetable of development, but very few transcripts are uniquely expressed in either the DRG or TG. Most prominent among the few transcripts restricted to a particular axial level are those encoded by the <italic>Hox </italic>genes and Etv1, which at this stage are expressed only in the DRG. The restriction of the Hox transcripts (with the exception of HoxD1) to spinal levels is expected based on the well characterized axial expression pattern of these genes. Etv1 expression is restricted to the DRG at E13.5 because the first neurons to express this marker, the large proprioceptive neurons innervating muscle spindles, develop within the DRG at spinal levels but at cranial levels are largely sequestered in the mesV. Etv1-expressing neurons that develop in the TG by E16.5 are distinguished by smaller size and the co-expression of Islet2, and appear to represent a distinct subset of sensory neurons.</p><p>Global analysis of gene expression in Brn3a knockout and wild-type DRG demonstrates that Brn3a regulates, directly or indirectly, an extensive program of gene expression. Advances in microarray technology and in the annotation of the mouse genome have allowed us to significantly expand the number of identified Brn3a targets from a prior study of the TG [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. A large number of the downstream targets of Brn3a in the DRG have known roles in neurogenesis or neural function, and include components of axons and synapses, neurotransmitters and their receptors, mediators of intracellular signaling, and transcription factors. Because the regulatory sequences of many of these genes have not been described, in many cases it is not possible to distinguish direct regulatory targets from secondary or compensatory effects. However, in recent studies we have used locus-ChIP to demonstrate that Brn3a is a direct repressor of NeuroD1 and NeuroD4 in the embryonic TG [[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>] in press], as well as a negative modulator of its own expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>].</p><p>Most Brn3a target genes are conserved between sensory neurons at cranial and spinal levels. However, a subset of genes with the most increased expression in the TG do not change expression in the Brn3a knockout DRG, and are generally undetectable in the E13.5 DRG of animals of any genotype. These differentially regulated transcripts include the transcription factors Tcfap2b, Gata3 and NeuroD4, the calcium binding protein calbindin2 (calretinin), and the small GTP-binding protein Rab3b, implicated in synaptic vesicle release [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. Because there are normally few transcripts that distinguish the TG from the DRG at this stage of development, the gene expression patterns of the DRG and TG are significantly more different in Brn3a knockout ganglia than in the wild type. This suggests that one important role for Brn3a is to suppress potential differences in gene expression between the spinal and cranial ganglia, mediating a process of 'convergent development' in which functionally similar populations of neurons are generated from different embryological sources.</p><p>The state of histone H3 acetylation of Brn3a target gene loci offers some insight into the underlying mechanism of the differential regulation of these targets at spinal and cranial levels. Normally, H3 acetylation is associated with the regulatory sequences in the promoters of actively transcribed genes. Consistent with this, we have previously shown that the promoter region of <italic>Pou4f1 </italic>itself is highly acetylated in the TG, and the promoters of genes that are silent in the sensory ganglia regardless of Brn3a genotype are deacetylated [[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>] in press]. In wild-type DRG and TG, the differentially regulated genes <italic>NeuroD4 </italic>and <italic>Tcfap2b </italic>are nearly silent, yet these gene loci can be distinguished in trigeminal neurons by increased H3 acetylation over a region encompassing the transcription start site. The <italic>Msc </italic>gene is also normally silent, but it exhibits increased expression at both cranial and spinal levels in Brn3a null mice, and is accordingly H3 acetylated in both the DRG and TG. Thus, in the case of these genes with increased expression in the Brn3a knockout, H3 acetylation appears to reveal a latent state of potential expression, which is normally repressed by Brn3a or its downstream effectors, and de-repressed in Brn3a knockout ganglia.</p><p>The failure of DRG neurons to increase <italic>NeuroD4 </italic>and <italic>Tcfap2b </italic>expression in Brn3a knockout ganglia suggests that a redundant mechanism of repression exists for these genes at spinal but not cranial levels. The action of such a repressor may be reflected in the low levels of histone acetylation at these loci in the DRG. Because the most prominent distinguishing feature of sensory gene expression at spinal levels is the expression of multiple <italic>Hox </italic>genes, these factors are candidate mediators of this selective repression of <italic>NeuroD4 </italic>and <italic>Tcfap2b </italic>in the DRG. Transcriptional repressor functions have been described for the <italic>Hox </italic>genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>], and there is evidence that Hox proteins can directly block the activity of the widely expressed histone acetyltransferase CBP-p300 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. <italic>Hox </italic>gene repression of a subset of Brn3a target gene loci could be an active process at E13.5, or <italic>Hox </italic>gene expression at earlier developmental stages could produce persisting modifications of chromatin, reflected in the deacetylation of these loci observed here, resulting in reduced transcription even when direct repression by <italic>Hox </italic>genes is no longer active.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Matings, embryos, and RNA isolation for array analysis</title><p>To generate tissue for microarray analysis, timed matings of Brn3a heterozygote animals were performed, and the embryos were harvested at E13.5.
