The plasmid was cloned at the BamH1 site of pAT153 into Escherichia coli and the recombinant plasmid was designated pCTL1. A detailed restriction endonuclease map of pCTL1 was constructed. A fragment of the chlamydial plasmid was shown to function as a promoter in E. coli when placed upstream of the lacZ gene. The entire plasmid was sequenced by the chain termination method. Open reading frames were identified from the resulting consensus sequence together with a candidate for the plasmid origin of replication consisting of four perfect tandem repeats of a 22bp sequence, an A:T rich sequence and an open reading frame which could generate a 34.8kdal product. The predicted polypeptide products of the open reading frames were compared by computer with all reported protein sequences. Homology of the predicted polypeptide product of an open reading frame to the E. coli dnaB protein and the analogous product of gene 12 of bacteriophage P22 is described.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><supplementary-material content-type="scanned-pages"><graphic xlink:href="nar00152-0450.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="4053"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00152-0451.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="4054"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00152-0452.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="4055"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00152-0453.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="4056"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00152-0454.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="4057"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00152-0455.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="4058"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00152-0456.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="4059"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00152-0457.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="4060"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00152-0458.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="4061"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00152-0459.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="4062"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00152-0460.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="4063"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00152-0461.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="4064"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00152-0462.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="4065"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00152-0463.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="4066"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00152-0464.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="4067"/></supplementary-material></body></article>
