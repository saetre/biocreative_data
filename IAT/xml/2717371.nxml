In this study we investigated the integration of the <italic>Drosophila</italic> BMP and Wingless/GSK3 signaling pathways via phosphorylations of the transcription factor Mad. Wingless was found to regulate the phosphorylation of Mad by GSK3 in vivo. In epistatic experiments, the effects of Wingless on wing disc molecular markers (<italic>senseless</italic>, <italic>distalless</italic> and <italic>vestigial</italic>) were suppressed by depletion of Mad with RNAi. Wingless overexpression phenotypes, such as formation of ectopic wing margins, were induced by Mad GSK3 phosphorylation-resistant mutant protein. Unexpectedly, we found that Mad phosphorylation by GSK3 and MAPK occurred in segmental patterns. Mad depletion or overexpression produced Wingless-like embryonic segmentation phenotypes. In <italic>Xenopus</italic> embryos, segmental border formation was disrupted by Smad8 depletion. The results show that Mad is required for Wingless signaling and for the integration of gradients of positional information.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="16"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Cells in the embryo are subjected to a multitude of growth factor signals that must be integrated to generate particular cell differentiation decisions.

We suggest this is because Mad also has Dpp-independent functions.

For whole embryo samples, embryos on agar plates were covered with Halocarbon 700 oil 4&#x02013;6 hrs after egg laying. This treatment makes the embryos transparent (after approximately 10 min in oil) and allows one to distinguish live and dead embryos. 50 embryos per sample were picked from grape plates, transferred into lysis buffer, supplied by the Absolutely RNA Miniprep Kit (Stratagene), and immediately frozen on dry ice to break the chorion. For extraction of total RNA, the samples were thawed and homogenized in 0.1 ml ground glass homogenizers until no intact embryos were visible, before proceeding with cDNA synthesis. Quantitative RT-PCR was performed using the Mx3000P machine (Stratagene), and the Brilliant SYBR Green QPCR Master Mix (Stratagene).
