Initially, Shp2 was found to have a role in growth factor signaling, downstream of growth factor receptors and upstream of MAP kinase signaling. Zhang et al. &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030225-b016">16</xref>&#x0005d; demonstrated that Shp2 controls phosphorylation and activation of Src family kinases (SFKs), in that SFK activity is reduced in the absence of Shp2, due to hyperphosphorylation of the inhibitory phosphorylation site. Two SFKs, Fyn and Yes, have a role in vertebrate convergence and extension (CE) cell movements during gastrulation &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030225-b017">17</xref>&#x0005d;.

Morpholino (MO)-mediated Fyn/Yes knockdown in zebrafish embryos phenocopies Silberblick/Wnt11 and Pipetail/Wnt5 morphants both morphologically and molecularly. Although Fyn and Yes act in a synergistic manner with Wnt5 and Wnt11, they do not function in a linear pathway; instead, they operate in parallel, converging downstream on the small GTPase RhoA. Given the role of Fyn and Yes in gastrulation cell movements, the function of Shp2 as an indirect activator of SFKs, and evidence from <italic>Xenopus</italic> and mouse that Shp2 may have a role in gastrulation cell movements, we hypothesized that Shp2 is involved in CE cell movements during gastrulation.</p><p>Here, we show that MO-mediated knockdown of Shp2 in zebrafish embryos resulted in defective CE cell movements during gastrulation, but not cell specification. Genetic epistasis analyses indicated that Shp2 acts through Fyn and Yes, upstream of the small GTPase RhoA. Expression of mutant NS- or LS-Shp2 in zebrafish embryos resulted in overlapping phenotypes, in that normal gastrulation was impaired without affecting cell specification. Specifically, we found that NS-Shp2 induced CE cell movement defects. Moreover, craniofacial and cardiac development were also impaired. The NS- and LS-Shp2s did not act synergistically upon coinjection, which is consistent with the two mutants acting in the same signaling pathway with opposing effects. The defects resulting from expression of mutant Shp2s correspond to symptoms in human NS/LS patients. The notion that defective Shp2 signaling induced cell movement defects as early as gastrulation is important and may have implications for the monitoring and diagnosis of NS and LS.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results/Discussion</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Shp2 Knockdown Induced Defects in CE during Gastrulation</title><p>Zebrafish Shp2 (Ensembl database ENSDARG00000020334, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ensembl.org">http://www.ensembl.org</ext-link>) is highly homologous to human and mouse Shp2 (91.2&#x00025; and 90.3&#x00025; protein sequence identity, respectively) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030225-g001">Figure 1</xref>A).
