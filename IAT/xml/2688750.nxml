These data suggest that membrane raft organization is modified in CC erythrocytes. In addition, the average zeta potential (a measure of surface electrochemical potential) of CC erythrocytes was &#x02248;2 mV lower than that of AA erythrocytes, indicating that substantial rearrangements occur in the membrane matrix of CC erythrocytes.

Thus, hemichromes and hemichrome-induced processes may modify the architecture of erythrocyte membranes. Since these processes occur at greater levels in homozygous CC erythrocytes, they have the potential to produce marked changes in the two-dimensional membrane matrix of these cells, which could alter their membrane fluidity and impede the lateral diffusion or mobility of their membrane components <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005828-Kusumi1">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref>. Compared to AA erythrocytes, we hypothesized that CC erythrocytes have marked differences in their membrane lipid profile, two-dimensional membrane matrix, and macroscopic biophysical and electrochemical properties. To test these hypotheses, we compared the membrane lipid and raft <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005828-Simons1">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref> composition of erythrocytes obtained from AA and CC individuals using HPLC-based analyses of extracted erythrocyte lipids and immunoblot analyses of detergent-solubilized membrane fractions. We also employed an electrophoretic mobility assay to measure the net membrane potential, known as zeta potential (ZP), of individual AA and CC erythrocytes to determine whether any differences in their membrane matrices might be associated with alterations in their whole-cell physiology.</p><p>Rafts (or membrane microdomains) are putative membrane entities that are proposed to have important physiological functions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005828-London1">&#x0005b;25&#x0005d;</xref>, such as signal transduction <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005828-Suzuki1">&#x0005b;26&#x0005d;</xref>, and their molecular composition can be determined by analyzing detergent-resistant membrane (DRM) fractions.

While the structure of rafts and their contribution to the physical properties of live cell membranes continue to be clarified, analyses of DRM fractions are useful in comparing AA and CC erythrocyte membranes for differences in lipid packing conditions and lateral protein distributions.</p><p>Significant modifications of rafts, together with membrane-associated hemichromes and plasma protein aggregates <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005828-Brittain1">&#x0005b;28&#x0005d;</xref>, would be predicted to change the whole-cell net charge of CC erythrocytes. This can be determined by comparing ZP measurements of AA and CC erythrocytes. The ZP of a cell is a measure of the electrochemical potential of its membrane, as determined by the amount and sign of associated ions. Among numerous charge-bearing molecules in the erythrocyte membrane, sialic acid contributes substantially to the high net negative charge on the surface of erythrocyte membranes, and removal of sialic acid by neuraminidase treatment results in erythrocyte aggregation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005828-Jan1">&#x0005b;29&#x0005d;</xref>.

ZP is thus a useful parameter to study the impact of membrane modifications on the net charge and adhesive properties of cell surfaces.</p><p>Employing these chemical and biophysical methods, we found that CC erythrocytes show characteristic alterations in both nanoscopic and macroscopic membrane properties that may affect intrinsic protein distributions and/or functions as well as intercellular interactions.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Erythrocytes</title><p>Erythrocyte acquisition, preparation and hemoglobin phenotype determination were described previously <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005828-Fairhurst1">&#x0005b;31&#x0005d;</xref>.

Compared to AA erythrocyte membranes, we detected lesser amounts of band 3 dimers in CC erythrocyte membranes. These reductions in band 3 signal were observed in both in DRM and bottom fractions. It is possible that band 3 in CC erythrocyte membranes is more tightly clustered and thus relatively more resistant to detergent extraction. The distribution patterns of CD47 and band 3 in sucrose gradients are essentially identical in AA and CC erythrocyte samples, likely due to known interactions between these two proteins. This suggests that the more extensive band 3 clustering in CC erythrocytes may produce highly packed conditions for CD47, thereby reducing its detergent extractability as well.</p></sec><sec id="s4c"><title>Change in repulsive force by zeta potential reduction in CC erythrocytes</title><p>We demonstrated that changes in the molecular profile and lateral organization of membrane molecules can alter charge distributions of the entire membrane. Treatment of normal AA erythrocytes with NaNO<sub>2</sub> generated levels of membrane-bound hemichromes and ZP shifts that were comparable to those of CC erythrocytes, suggesting that hemichrome deposition may play a key role in remodeling CC erythrocyte membranes. The ZP difference between CC erythrocytes and NaNO<sub>2</sub>&#x02013;treated AA erythrocytes is approximately 0.4 mV (2 mV <italic>vs.</italic> 1.6 mV, respectively). The larger ZP difference in CC erythrocytes may reflect the association of plasma proteins with CC erythrocyte membranes. These differences in ZP may also relate to the processes by which hemichromes are formed in these two cell types. In CC erythrocytes, hemichrome formation is a continuous process that occurs <italic>in vivo</italic> throughout the erythrocyte life-span. In contrast, hemichrome formation in chemically-oxidized AA erythrocytes <italic>in vitro</italic> occurs more rapidly. Also, the properties and membrane-altering effects of hemichromes may depend on whether they contain HbA or HbC.</p><p>We observed that negatively-charged PS was externalized at higher levels in a subset of CC erythrocytes. While these negative charges may not be sufficient to change the net charge of the erythrocyte surface, they may influence the membrane distributions of other charge-bearing molecules. Our results suggest that modified membrane microdomains contribute net positive charges that counteract increased negative charges derived from externalized PS on CC erythrocytes. In any case, decreases in ZP suggest that the repulsive forces between NaNO<sub>2</sub>-treated AA erythrocytes, CC erythrocytes, or other negatively charged cells are reduced. This may promote the interaction of CC erythrocytes with splenic macrophages that remove them from the circulation. This process may also occur with senescent AA erythrocytes as we observed reductions in ZP in older AA erythrocytes fractionated by ultracentrifugation. The bottom 25&#x00025; fraction containing older erythrocytes displayed &#x02248;1.2 mV more positive ZP than the top 25&#x00025; fraction containing younger erythrocytes (not shown). Additional studies will be required to determine how the binding of hemichromes and plasma proteins to the inner membrane of CC erythrocytes contribute to the observed ZP alterations of these cells.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank Drs.
