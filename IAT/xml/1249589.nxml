Chronic treatment of male hpg mice with estradiol induces FSH synthesis and secretion, and causes testicular maturation and qualitatively normal spermatogenesis. As estradiol negative feedback normally inhibits FSH production in the male, this study tested whether this paradoxical response to estradiol in the male hpg mouse might be due to inadequate masculinisation or incomplete defeminization in the neonatal period. Previous studies have demonstrated that treatment of hpg mice with testosterone propionate in the immediate neonatal period is necessary to allow full reproductive behaviors to be expressed following suitable endocrine stimulation at adult ages.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p>Hpg mice were treated with 100 &#x003bc;g testosterone propionate or vehicle on postnatal day 2. At 35 days of age, subgroups of these mice were treated with silastic implants containing estradiol or cholesterol. Reproductive behavior was scored in tests with steroid-primed female mice, then testicular development was assessed histologically, and measures of pituitary FSH content made at 85 days of age.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The neonatal testosterone propionate treatment successfully defeminized female litter mates, as revealed by impaired vaginal opening and deficiencies in lordosis behavior, and it allowed appropriate male reproductive behavior to be expressed in a proportion of the hpg males when tested at an adult age. However, neonatal androgen supplementation did not block or even reduce the subsequent actions of estradiol in increasing pituitary FSH content, nor did it affect the ability of estradiol to induce qualitatively normal spermatogenesis.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>The ability of the hpg male to show a "female" neuroendocrine response to estradiol is not a result of inadequate androgenization during neonatal development, and thus the actions of estradiol revealed in this rodent model are not an artefact of incomplete sexual differentiation, but reflect a physiological role of estradiol occurring during a specific early temporal window of male reproductive development.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Introduction</title><p>Although estradiol has classically been considered a female hormone, recent data from man shows that it plays important physiological roles in the male. For example, estradiol deficiency or resistance results in lack of bone epiphyseal fusion, delayed skeletal maturation and low sperm viability [[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>] for review]. These effects can be reproduced in rodent models so that the underlying mechanisms of estrogen action can be investigated. For example, male mice in which estrogen receptor (ER) &#x003b1; has been knocked out become progressively infertile [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>], and likewise, if production of estradiol is prevented by knockout of the cyp19 aromatase gene, then such mice show impaired spermatogenesis, reduced spermatid numbers and infertility [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>].</p><p>We have used the hypogonadal (<italic>hpg</italic>) mouse to study the actions of estradiol in male reproduction. Such mice are unable to produce gonadotrophin releasing hormone (GnRH) due to a truncation in the GnRH gene, and therefore show a profound hypogonadotrophic hypogonadism [[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>] for review]. Surprisingly, treatment of <italic>hpg </italic>males with low levels of estradiol stimulates spermatogenesis, as evident by an increase in testis weight and the presence of elongated spermatids in the seminiferous tubules of the testis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. This induction of spermatogenesis is accompanied by increases in pituitary FSH content and in circulating FSH concentrations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. FSH is an important component of the spermatogenic process; lack of the FSH &#x003b2; subunit or receptor in genetically-modified mice results in decreased testis size and reduced sperm quality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. Conversely, treatment of <italic>hpg </italic>mice with recombinant human FSH has been shown to increase testis size and the number of spermatogonia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>].</p><p>In male mammals, estradiol normally provides a negative feedback signal which inhibits FSH synthesis and secretion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Thus, the increase in FSH production in response to estradiol in <italic>hpg </italic>mice ("positive feedback") might be considered to be a "female" neuroendocrine response. One possibility is that the phenomenon of estradiol-induced FSH production in male <italic>hpg </italic>mice is due to inadequate masculinization or incomplete defeminization of the neonate due to the lack of androgen exposure in the early postnatal period. Appropriate pre- and postnatal testosterone concentrations are known to be necessary for complete masculinization in rodents. Before postnatal day 5, serum testosterone is higher in male mice compared to females [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>] and this difference is believed to be important for defeminization of males. Mice and other rodents have a critical period of neural sexual differentiation before postnatal day 10. Experimental studies have demonstrated that administration of testosterone to female mice in early postnatal life suppresses sexual receptivity and increases aggression at later ages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. Conversely, neonatal castration of male mice results in a lack of normal male aggressive behavior in adulthood; which is not restored with later testosterone treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Hence early androgen exposure serves to differentiate the subsequent propensity to display aggressive behavior and sexual receptivity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>], and sensitizes appropriate neural elements to androgens encountered in later life [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>].</p><p>There is clear evidence that <italic>hpg </italic>mice are not adequately masculinized in the neonatal period. <italic>Hpg </italic>males will show appropriate <italic>physiological </italic>reproductive development when treated in adulthood with either grafts of fetal hypothalamic tissue releasing GnRH or with appropriate gonadotropins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>], but importantly such <italic>hpg </italic>males do not show appropriate reproductive <italic>behavior </italic>despite the induction of steroidogenesis and spermatogenesis. However, if <italic>hpg </italic>mice are also treated with exogenous androgens on postnatal day 2, and then the reproductive axis is activated by grafts or gonadotropins, they subsequently display mounting, intromission and ejaculation, and can sire litters in later life [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. Therefore, the aim of this study was to test the hypothesis that the ability of estradiol to increase in FSH production in male <italic>hpg </italic>mice is due to the lack of defeminization or masculinization resulting from low testosterone exposure of <italic>hpg </italic>male mice during the early postnatal period.</p><p>The experimental approach was to administer testosterone propionate to neonatal male <italic>hpg </italic>mice. We predicted that if the ability to respond to estradiol is a consequence of an inadequate postnatal androgen environment in <italic>hpg </italic>mice, then neonatal treatment with testosterone propionate should block the ability of subsequent estradiol treatment to produce a rise in pituitary FSH and to induce spermatogenesis.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Animals</title><p>All animal procedures were approved by the University of Nottingham Local Ethical Review Committee and carried out in accordance with the Animals Scientific Procedures Act (UK) 1986 (project licence PPL 40/2372).

One testis was placed in Bouin's fixative and the other was placed on ice and frozen at -20&#x000b0;C. The fixed testes were processed into paraffin blocks and 5 &#x003bc;m sections were stained with haematoxylin-eosin for histological analysis. For measurement of testis testosterone content, the frozen testis was sonicated in 1 ml PBS (3 &#x000d7; 10 seconds) and the homogenate extracted twice with 4 ml of diethyl-ether. The supernatant was left to evaporate overnight in a fume hood at 25&#x000b0;C, and samples were reconstituted in 1 ml PBS.

This paradoxical stimulatory action of estradiol in the male is in agreement with our previous studies in the <italic>hpg </italic>mouse [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>] and confirms the robustness of the response. Secondly, and more importantly, androgenization of <italic>hpg </italic>males with testosterone propionate in the neonatal period did not affect the subsequent ability of estradiol to activate the reproductive axis in such mice.</p><p>Since the estradiol-induced rise in pituitary FSH was not abolished by neonatal androgenization of <italic>hpg </italic>male mice, the possibility arises that the current neonatal androgenization protocol was ineffective in the induction of masculinization of the <italic>hpg </italic>males. However, we followed carefully a well-established dosing protocol previously demonstrated to be effective in male <italic>hpg </italic>mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>], and our other experimental observations suggest the androgenization protocol was at least partly successful. The neonatal testosterone propionate injections were certainly effective in defeminizing the female litter mates of the <italic>hpg </italic>males. First, vaginal opening usually occurs around postnatal day 35 in female mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>], yet the vast majority of our androgenized females (97%) failed to show full vaginal opening by 70 days of age. Second, a significant proportion (36%) of androgen-treated females displayed aggressive behavior when paired with stud male mice, consistent with previous studies demonstrating that increased aggression is a consequence of neonatal androgenization in female mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Third, the uterine weights from the females that were treated with testosterone propionate in the neonatal period were significantly greater than those from the vehicle-treated females, also consistent with previous studies demonstrating that androgenized female mice have heavier uteri [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. The observation that vaginal opening and uterine weight were affected in almost all neonatally-androgenized females whereas a lower proportion displayed abnormal female behavior may indicate that a higher androgen threshold must be reached to affect sexual behavior than to disrupt the endocrine control of the female reproductive tract.</p><p>There was also evidence of masculinization of behavior in some of the <italic>hpg </italic>males: two of the six <italic>hpg </italic>males treated neonatally with testosterone propionate and then with estradiol in later life displayed mounting and intromission when paired with sexually receptive female mice. Such behaviors did not occur in the <italic>hpg </italic>mice treated with vehicle in the neonatal period, consistent with the previously hypothesised crucial role of early androgen exposure in mice for masculinizing the brain and the sexually dimorphic spinal nucleus of the bulbocavernosus and its target perineal muscles, which are involved in the control of penile copulatory reflexes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. The failure of the other four neonatally-androgenized mice to display copulatory behaviors is most likely to relate to the limiting endocrine milieu at the time of the behavioural tests. Previous studies of the role of neonatal androgens in regulating male reproductive behavior in <italic>hpg </italic>mice relied upon additional treatment with testosterone propionate in adult life to permit such behaviors to be expressed in an appropriate context [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. In the current experiment, levels of intratesticular androgens were found to be low even after estradiol treatment, and our previous studies have likewise failed to detect rises in circulating androgen concentrations after estradiol treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Thus, the prevailing androgen milieu is very likely to be inadequate for most mice to be primed to display mounting, intromission and ejaculation.</p><p>In view of the evidence of successful androgenization in at least some of the <italic>hpg </italic>males and female siblings, our interpretation of the current studies is that the increase pituitary FSH content in male <italic>hpg </italic>mice in response to estradiol is <italic>not </italic>a failure of early masculinization or defeminization. An alternative explanation may be that the positive FSH response of gonadotrophs to estradiol in "adult" male <italic>hpg </italic>mice may be due to the immaturity of the pituitary gland reflecting the lack of pituitary exposure to GnRH in such mice. A recent study of the expression of the pituitary melatonin receptor 1 (MT1) gene provides good evidence that the pituitary gland in <italic>hpg </italic>mice is arrested at an immature stage of development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. In normally developing mice exposed to increasing amounts of GnRH, there is a decline in MT1 expression in the pituitary gland, but in <italic>hpg </italic>mice which are not exposed to GnRH, this decline does not occur [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. Developmental changes in gonadotroph secretory profiles have been described for rats [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>] and rhesus monkeys [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>], so it might be hypothesized that ability of estradiol to increase synthesis and secretion of FSH (but not LH, 7) in <italic>hpg </italic>mice is a reflection of an action of estradiol that is physiologically relevant during early postnatal development in mammals. Indeed, stimulatory actions of estradiol on testis function have been demonstrated in several other rodent models where pituitary development is still immature, and provide some evidence that estradiol exerts its stimulatory effects via an interaction with FSH. For example, treatment of rats with estradiol in the second postnatal week of life stimulates germ cell mitosis increasing the abundance of type A spermatogonia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. Correspondingly, treatment of neonatal rats with diethylstilbestrol induces small increases in circulating FSH and advances the initiation of spermatogenesis at puberty [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. However, these effects of estradiol may not be exclusively via action on pituitary gonadotrophs producing FSH, because in a similar experimental paradigm in neonatal rats, estradiol treatment also enhances the actions of FSH within the seminiferous tubule on pre-meiotic differentiation, resulting in increased abundance of pachytene spermatocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Treatment of male <italic>hpg </italic>mice with physiological levels of estradiol promotes production of FSH in the pituitary gland and induces spermatogenesis. We hypothesized that this paradoxical response to estradiol might be the result of inadequate masculinisation or incomplete defeminization of the <italic>hpg </italic>male, but this seems unlikely since treatment of neonatal <italic>hpg </italic>mice with testosterone propionate does not abolish these effects of estradiol. The stimulatory responses to estradiol revealed in <italic>hpg </italic>mice at an adult age probably mimic physiological actions of estradiol in early male development when pituitary maturation is incomplete.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>MON, HB, JBK and FJPE all participated in the experimental design, MON, HB and FJPE carried out the experimental procedures, MON
