MATERIALS AND METHODS: Ten patients with silicosis, and 10 healthy controls were studied. Non-adherent cells were separated and analysed by cytometry for the expression of Fas antigen, FasL, and the co-expression of Fas/FasL. By double staining, we studied the FasL expression on CD4, CD8, CD56 and CD45RO-positive cells. DNA fragmentation was investigated by the terminal deoxy(d) UTP nick end labelling (TUNEL) method. RESULTS: We have found Fas and FasL expression in silicosis patients to be significantly higher than those in healthy controls. Interestingly, 6-18% of lymphocytes from silicosis patients co-expressed Fas and FasL. In silicosis patients, FasL was highly expressed on CD4+, CD56+ and CD45RO+ bronchoalveolar lavage cells. Fas antigen expressing cells showed DNA fragmentation characteristic for apoptosis. CONCLUSION: FasL was significantly expressed on cytotoxic effector and memory cells. The Fas/FasL system is implicated in the inflammatory process observed in silicosis patients.</p></abstract></article-meta></front></article>
