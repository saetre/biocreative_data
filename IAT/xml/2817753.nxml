Marfan's syndrome and congenital contractural arachnodactyly (CCA) result from dominant mutations in the genes <italic>FBN1</italic> and <italic>FBN2</italic> respectively. Patients with both conditions often present with specific muscle atrophy or weakness, yet this has not been reported in the mouse models. In the case of <italic>Fbn1</italic>, this is due to perinatal lethality of the homozygous null mice making measurements of strength difficult. In the case of <italic>Fbn2</italic>, four different mutant alleles have been described in the mouse and in all cases syndactyly was reported as the defining phenotypic feature of homozygotes.</p></sec><sec><title>Methodology/Principal Findings</title><p>As part of a large-scale N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea (ENU) mutagenesis screen, we identified a mouse mutant, Mariusz, which exhibited muscle weakness along with hindlimb syndactyly. We identified an amber nonsense mutation in <italic>Fbn2</italic> in this mouse mutant. Examination of a previously characterised <italic>Fbn2</italic>-null mutant, <italic>Fbn2<sup>fp</sup></italic>, identified a similar muscle weakness phenotype. The two <italic>Fbn2</italic> mutant alleles complement each other confirming that the weakness is the result of a lack of Fbn2 activity. Skeletal muscle from mutants proved to be abnormal with higher than average numbers of fibres with centrally placed nuclei, an indicator that there are some regenerating muscle fibres. Physiological tests indicated that the mutant muscle produces significantly less maximal force, possibly as a result of the muscles being relatively smaller in Mariusz mice.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>These findings indicate that Fbn2 is involved in integrity of structures required for strength in limb movement. As human patients with mutations in the fibrillin genes <italic>FBN1</italic> and <italic>FBN2</italic> often present with muscle weakness and atrophy as a symptom, <italic>Fbn2</italic>-null mice will be a useful model for examining this aspect of the disease process further.</p></sec></abstract><counts><page-count count="10"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Inherited neuromuscular disorders have a significant impact on health and cause a wide variety of symptoms such as muscle weakness, cardiomyopathy and/or mental retardation. Their severity also varies significantly from being mild with little or no symptoms (e.g. some cases of myotonic dystrophy) to severe where life expectancy is shortened (e.g. Duchenne muscular dystrophy). The primary tissue affected with each disorder ranges from the nerves connecting the brain and spine to the muscles (e.g. spinal muscular atrophy), the muscles themselves (e.g. Duchenne muscular dystrophy) and the neuromuscular junctions (e.g. myasthenia gravis).</p><p>In contrast to neuromuscular disorders connective tissue disorders primarily affect the skin, cardiovascular system, skeleton and eyes. Two such connective tissue disorders are Marfan's syndrome and Congenital Contractural Arachnodactyly (CCA), which are caused by dominant mutations in the fibrillin-1 (<italic>FBN1</italic>) and fibrillin-2 (<italic>FBN2</italic>) genes respectively <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009137-Dietz1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009137-Putnam1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>. Fibrillins are large cysteine-rich glycoproteins found the extracellular matrix of extensive tissues such as the lung, skin and blood vessels. Fibrillins assemble into microfibrils that then become networks providing structural support for the formation of elastic fibres. These scaffolds of microfibrils also act as targets for growth factors controlling differentiation and morphogenesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009137-Ramirez1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>. Not surprisingly, mutations in the fibrillin proteins can have serious consequences. For example patients with Marfan's syndrome are usually very tall, and can have one or more of the following symptoms: long thin limbs, stretchy skin, hypermobile joints, arachnodactyly, coloboma of the iris, scoliosis, learning disabilities, aneurysms and hypotonia, to name a few <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009137-Dean1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>. Patients with CCA, on the other hand, whilst having some of the skeletal features in common with Marfan's syndrome, have a crumpled appearance of the ear helix and congenital contractures, and do not typically have the ocular and cardiovascular complications seen with Marfan's syndrome <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009137-Viljoen1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>. Of particular relevance to the study described here is that both diseases affect the skeletal muscle seen as hypotonia in Marfan's syndrome and hypoplasia in CCA.</p><p>Mouse null mutants have been generated for both the <italic>Fbn1</italic> and <italic>Fbn2</italic> genes and they prove to be imperfect models of the diseases. <italic>Fbn1</italic>-null mutants do display the vascular abnormalities that have been associated with Marfan's syndrome but they do not appear to manifest most other symptoms seen in humans with the condition <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009137-Pereira1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>, while reported <italic>Fbn2</italic>-null mutants do not fully recapitulate the CCA phenotype <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009137-ArteagaSolis1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009137-Browning1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>ENU mutagenesis is a valuable tool for uncovering mutations that affect muscle development and function. Herein, we report the identification of a mutant, Mariusz, in a recessive ENU mutagenesis screen. Homozygous Mariusz mice suffer from a profound muscle weakness and fusion of hind paw digits. We have identified that Mariusz mice carry a nonsense mutation in the <italic>Fbn2</italic> gene. This mutant is an important model for studying the pathogenic mechanisms underlying muscle weakness and identifies a phenotype, hitherto undiscovered, that appears to result from the absence of Fbn2 protein.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>The Identification of the Mariusz Mutant</title><p>We carried out a mutagenesis screen to identify mouse mutants that might possess muscular defects on the basis of exhibiting reduced grip strength. ENU-mutagenized BALB/c males were crossed with wild type C3H/HeH females. A female and male G<sub>1</sub> offspring of two separate ENU-treated males were intercrossed to maximize the number of mutations being carried in the G<sub>2</sub> offspring. To generate homozygosity for mutations, G<sub>2</sub> mice were backcrossed to one of the G<sub>1</sub> parents to generate G<sub>3</sub> offspring that were then screened. G<sub>3</sub> offspring were examined for grip strength in both forelimbs alone, and forelimbs and hindlimbs together. One G<sub>3</sub> pedigree (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0009137-g001">Figure 1A</xref>) contained mice with very low grip strength (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0009137-g001">Figure 1B</xref>). This phenotype was inherited in an autosomal recessive fashion with complete penetrance in both sexes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0009137-g001">Figure 1A</xref>).

The paws of Mariusz mice were not closed but instead remained in an open position with the digits extended (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0009137-g001">Figure 1C</xref>). Although this might account for their poor performance in this test, the overall defect in muscular strength is more profound and involved more than an inability to grip. This was exemplified by suspending the mice by the tail. Whereas wild type mice are able to extend their hindlimbs for a long period of time as they struggle, Mariusz mice could extend their hindlimbs only briefly before they closed against their body, a so-called &#x02018;clasping&#x02019; phenotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0009137-g001">Figure 1D</xref>). This phenotype does not require any ability to grip.

Indeed, the loss of strength is so acute that mice could be accurately and simply phenotyped for low muscular strength without any specialized equipment, merely by holding the mice by the tail and assessing their ability to struggle or grip a cage lid.</p><p>Concomitant with the low grip strength we noted that the mice exhibited hindlimb paw syndactyly of two or more adjacent toes. Both phenotypes - fused digits and weak muscular strength - are fully penetrant in mutants but there is some variability between Mariusz mice for the type of syndactyly. It was most commonly observed as four toes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0009137-g002">Figure 2A</xref>, <italic>Mz/Mz</italic> #1), though less commonly as four toes with two of the toes fused (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0009137-g002">Figure 2A</xref>, <italic>Mz/Mz</italic> #2), four toes with one of the toes skewed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0009137-g002">Figure 2A</xref>, <italic>Mz/Mz</italic> #3), or occasionally, even a mixture of two digit phenotypes in the hindlimbs of a single mouse (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0009137-g002">Figure 2A</xref>, <italic>Mz/Mz</italic> #4). The phenotype was the result of a combination of hard and soft tissue fusion. Alcian Blue/Alizarin Red staining and X-rays of hindlimbs showed that digit fusion sometimes resulted from the soft tissue fusing but leaving the phalanges unfused (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0009137-g002">Figure 2B</xref>, Mz/Mz #1) or was the result of fusion of two, or even three, distinct distal phalanx bones and the intervening soft tissue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0009137-g002">Figure 2B</xref>, Mz/Mz #2; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0009137-g002">Figure 2C</xref>).</p><fig id="pone-0009137-g002" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0009137.g002</object-id><label>Figure 2</label><caption><title>The digit fusion phenotype of the Mariusz mutant.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Examples of different fusion phenotypes observed - four toes (#1), four toes with two toes fused (#2), four toes with skewed digit (#3), mixture of two digit phenotypes in a single mouse (#4).

This is because, firstly, weak grip strength is observed in the forelimbs alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0009137-g001">Figure 1B</xref>) although there are no observable digit abnormalities in the forelimb paws. Also, as detailed above, the mice exhibit a startling generalized muscle weakness that did not require the ability to grip. There was 100&#x00025; concordance for low grip strength and hindlimb digit fusion in abnormal mice from this line and heterozygotes showed no abnormal phenotype (data not shown). This suggested that the two defects might be the result of a single mutation.</p><p>Some other phenotypic abnormalities were noted in Mariusz mice. They performed poorly in the MoRAG test for measuring grasping and retrieval of food pellets <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009137-Tucci1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0009137-g002">Figure 2D</xref>). The low score in grasping mimics the results seen in the grip strength test. The poor score in retrieval (where successful retrieval is scored if the mouse brings the food toward the mouth) might indicate a distinct abnormality in motor function. Mariusz mice also exhibited slower growth rates than their littermate controls and were, as a result, smaller (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0009137-g002">Figure 2E</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Positional Cloning of the Mariusz Mutation</title><p>The Mariusz mutation was generated on a BALB/cAnNCrl genetic background, and then crossed to C3H/HeH. A total of 13 G<sub>3</sub> C3H/HeH x BALB/cAnNCrl mice with the Mariusz phenotype were examined with a panel of 53 markers spanning the entire genome at regular intervals that are polymorphic between these two strains. The strongest linkage signal (LOD score&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;3.3) was observed on chromosome 18 at a marker located around 62 Mb. Fine mapping was achieved by backcrossing Mariusz mice to C3H/HeH, C3H/HeN and, finally, to C57BL/6J mice and examining mice with the Mariusz phenotype (low grip strength and fused toes) with a panel of polymorphic markers spanning the region. Genotyping of 310 mice derived from intercrossing Mariusz heterozygotes identified 7 informative recombinants that narrowed the mutation-containing region to a maximum of 2.5 Mb (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0009137-g003">Figure 3A</xref>). At this stage we were unable to find any further polymorphic markers in this region that differentiated between BALB/cAnNCrl and either C3H or C57BL/6J. According to the Ensembl database, eighteen predicted or known genes were located within this region at the time of sequencing.

Although we cannot confirm that the <italic>Fbn2<sup>tm1Rmz</sup></italic>, <italic>Fbn2<sup>fp-2J</sup></italic> and <italic>Fbn2<sup>fp-3J</sup></italic> alleles also result in a homozygous phenotype of reduced strength, we feel it is highly likely given the likely effects of these mutant alleles on the Fbn2 protein and the similar digit fusion phenotype. As Fbn1 along with Fbn2, contributes to myofibrils, it would be worthwhile generating mice with a conditional null <italic>Fbn1</italic> allele so that their muscular phenotype could be examined.</p><p>Physiological tests on the muscle indicate that the myofibre structure is not altered in Fbn2-null mice (as their was no difference in peak isometric stress). The muscle itself generated less force, probably due its relatively smaller size in <italic>Fbn2</italic>-null mice. However, the loss of muscular strength in <italic>Fbn2</italic>-null mice is more extreme than the reduction in the maximum force produced by the muscle itself, suggesting an extra-muscular involvement. Our finding that the muscle itself shows signs of degeneration/regeneration suggests that some of the myofibres of <italic>Fbn2</italic>-null mice are in a regenerative phase. However, there was no gross inflammation and the level of regeneration can probably not account for the drastic reduction in the strength of these mice. A reduced level of collagen cross-linking has been identified in the tendons of <italic>Fbn2</italic>-null mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009137-Boregowda1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>. As this provides structural integrity to the tendons, the mechanical properties of the tendon, such as the maximal tensile strength, might be altered as a result. However, a reduced maximum tensile strength would make them more susceptible to rupture, and there is no evidence of this.</p><p>We propose that there is a significant alteration in a structure or structures external to the muscle that account for some of the loss of strength. One possibility is that it lies within the nervous system. In preliminary investigations, dorsal horn motor neuron counts appeared normal (data not shown). Given that many structures could potentially be affected, further analysis for any neuropathology would be worthwhile.</p><p>Why has this muscle weakness phenotype been missed in the original description of the <italic>Fbn2<sup>fp</sup></italic>/<italic>Fbn2<sup>fp</sup></italic> homozygotes? In a blind test of several experienced animal technicians at three separate institutes we provided with the Mariusz mice, although all were able to identify the syndactyly phenotype quickly, none identified the grip strength/clasping phenotype by mere handling alone. Once they were made aware of the phenotype they were easily able to identify mutant <italic>Fbn2</italic>-null mice with reduced strength based on either testing the ability of the mouse to struggle when held by the tail or testing the ability of the mouse to grip the wire grating on a standard cage lid. Thus the phenotype, although easy to discern without specialized equipment, required a rigorous phenotyping assay to enable the initial identification.</p><p>Our report herein emphasizes an additional value of ENU mutagenesis screens. Even if the mutation is of a known gene for which a similarly acting mutation has already been identified, it can still uncover hitherto unidentified phenotypes associated with mutant alleles.

The loss of strength is at least partly the result of relatively smaller muscles in <italic>Fbn2</italic>-null mice, but extra-muscular effects account for a significant proportion of the strength loss.
