Stat3 and c-Myc TFs are essential for maintaining mouse ES cell self-renewal. c-Myc, together with Oct4, Sox2, and Klf4, is a reprogramming factor. While previous studies have investigated core transcriptional circuitry in ES cells, other TF pathways that promote ES cell pluripotency have yet to be investigated. Therefore, to further understand ES cell transcriptional networks, we used genome-wide chromatin immunoprecipitation and microarray analysis (ChIP-chip) to map Stat3 and c-Myc binding targets in ES cells. Our results show that Stat3 and c-Myc occupy a significant number of genes whose expression is highly enriched in ES cells. By comparing Stat3 and c-Myc target genes with gene expression data from undifferentiated ES cells and embryoid bodies (EBs), we found that Stat3 binds active and inactive genes in ES cells, while c-Myc binds predominantly active genes. Moreover, the transcriptional states of Stat3 and c-Myc targets are correlated with co-occupancy of pluripotency-related TFs, polycomb group proteins, and active and repressive histone modifications. We also provide evidence that Stat3 targets are differentially expressed in ES cells following removal of LIF, where culture of ES cells in the absence of LIF resulted in downregulation of Stat3 target genes enriched in ES cells, and upregulation of lineage specific Stat3 target genes. Altogether, we reveal transcriptional targets of two key pluripotency-related genes in ES cells &#x02013; Stat3 and c-Myc, thus providing further insight into the ES cell transcriptional network.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="14"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Pluripotent embryonic stem (ES) cells, derived from mammalian preimplantation embryos, can be cultured indefinitely <italic>in vitro</italic> and have the ability to differentiate into all somatic and germ cell lineages <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003932-Martin1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003932-Evans1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>. ES cell pluripotency can be maintained in the presence of extrinsic signals such as leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) in addition to fetal calf serum (FCS).

While these studies demonstrate that Stat3 is essential for ES cell pluripotency, downstream targets of LIF/Jak/Stat3 signaling have not been fully identified.</p><p>Although LIF-signaling is sufficient to maintain ES cell pluripotency in serum conditions, LIF is insufficient to maintain ES cell pluripotency in serum-free conditions. Additional factors present in serum contribute to maintenance of pluripotency.

Evaluating transcription factor pathways involved in acquiring and maintaining a pluripotent state is critical in understanding mechanisms that contribute to pluripotency, acquiring a pluripotent state, and lineage specific differentiation. Thus, identification of Stat3 and c-Myc targets will lend further insight into transcriptional networks that govern ES cells pluripotency.</p><p>Recently, numerous genome-wide studies have evaluated promoter binding of core pluripotency genes Oct4, Sox2, and Nanog <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003932-Boyer1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003932-Loh1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>, in addition to transcription factors such as Klf proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003932-Jiang1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>, Tcf3 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003932-Cole1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>, and other ES cell enriched genes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003932-Chen1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003932-Kim1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>.

Continued efforts to build upon knowledge of ES cell transcriptional networks will strengthen our understanding of ES cell pluripotency.

Interestingly, Stat3 and c-Myc bind many ES cell enriched genes. By comparing Stat3 and c-Myc target genes with gene expression data from undifferentiated ES cells and differentiated embryoid bodies (EBs), we found that Stat3 binds both active and inactive genes in ES cells, while c-Myc binds predominantly active genes. Moreover, Stat3 and c-Myc co-occupancy with pluripotency-related genes and regions of active histone modifications is correlated with target gene activity, while Stat3 co-occupancy with polycomb repressive complex proteins (PcG), or regions with repressive bivalent histone modifications (H3K4/27me3) is correlated with target gene inactivity in ES cells. Our results also reveal that Stat3 targets are differentially expressed in ES cells in the absence of LIF.

ES cells were harvested using 0.25&#x00025; trypsin (Invitrogen) to dissociate cells, centrifuged in 10&#x00025; FCS DMEM medium to inactivate trypsin, and pelleted. To remove feeder cells, ES cells were plated in gelatin-coated dishes in ES cell media without iMEFs, and incubated at 37&#x000b0;C with 5&#x00025; CO<sub>2</sub> for 20&#x02013;30 minutes. After 20&#x02013;30 minutes, the medium was aspirated gently and cells were pelleted. Total RNA was extracted from ES cells cultured with or without LIF using an RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) and DNase treated using Turbo DNA-free (Ambion) for 30 minutes at 37&#x000b0;C. Reverse transcription was performed using a Superscript III kit with random hexamer primers (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA).

The polyclonal AcH3 (acetyl-histone-H3, #06-599) and rabbit IgG (PP64B) antibody were obtained from Upstate. 1&#x000d7;10<sup>8</sup> mouse R1 ES cells (feeder-free) were harvested and chemically crosslinked with 1&#x00025; formaldehyde (Sigma) for 20 hours at 4&#x000b0;C. Fixation was quenched by addition of 1/20 volume 2.5 M glycine for 5 minutes at room temperature. Cells were pelleted at 4&#x000b0;C (500 g), washed with ice-cold 1&#x000d7; PBS, washed twice with lysis buffer (10 mM Tris-HCL, 10 mM NaCl, 3 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 0.5&#x00025; GEPAL, 1 mM fresh PMSF), pelleted, and flash frozen in liquid nitrogen. Pellets were resuspended in pre-IP dilution buffer (10 mM Tris-HCL, 10 mM NaCl, 3 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 1 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 4&#x00025; GEPAL, 1 mM PMSF), 60 &#x000b5;L PMSF, and additional components (100 mM PMSF, 25&#x000d7; protease inhibitor, 20&#x00025; SDS, 5 M NaCl, H<sub>2</sub>O). Cells were sonicated using a Branson Sonifier 450D at 50&#x00025; amplitude, with 12&#x000d7;1 minutes pulses, followed by 1 minute rests in ice water. Sonicated fragments ranged in size from 200&#x02013;1000 bp. Post sonication, samples were centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 10 minutes at 4&#x000b0;C, aliquoted, and flash frozen in liquid nitrogen. Sonicated cell extracts equivalent to 2&#x000d7;10<sup>6</sup> cells were used in subsequent immunoprecipitations. Samples were pre-cleared with protein G Dynabeads (Dynal) in 1000 &#x000b5;L dilution buffer (0.01&#x00025; SDS, 1.1&#x00025; Triton X-100, 1.2 mM EDTA, 16.7 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.1), 167 mM NaCl, 5 &#x000b5;L Upstate protease inhibitor cocktail II). Cell extracts were incubated with 1 &#x000b5;g antibody overnight at 4&#x000b0;C. Chromatin-antibody complexes were isolated with 100 &#x000b5;L protein G Dynabeads, and washed one time with low salt buffer (0.1&#x00025; SDS, 1&#x00025; Triton X-100, 2 mM EDTA, 20 mM Tris-HCl, 150 mM NaCl), one time with high salt buffer (same as low salt with 500 mM NaCl), one time with LiCl wash buffer (0.25 M LiCl, 1&#x00025; IGEPAL-CA630, 1&#x00025; deoxycholic acid, 1 mM EDTA, 10 mM Tris), and twice with TE. Protein/DNA complexes were eluted from the beads in 10 &#x000b5;L 20&#x00025; SDS, 20 &#x000b5;L 1 M NaHCO<sub>3</sub>, and 170 &#x000b5;L H<sub>2</sub>O at 65&#x000b0;C with occasional vortexing. Crosslinking was reversed by addition of 8 &#x000b5;L 5 M NaCl and incubation overnight at 65&#x000b0;C. Extracts were then treated with RNase A and proteinase K, and DNA was purified using an Upstate EZ ChIP kit. 5 &#x000b5;g purified DNA (Stat3-chip, c-Myc-chip, AcH3-chip, and Input) was amplified using a GenomePlex&#x000ae; Whole Genome Amplification (WGA) Kit (Sigma), DNase treated, and labeled with a GeneChip&#x000ae; WT Double-Stranded DNA Terminal Labeling Kit. Labeled DNA was hybridized to Affymetrix mouse promoter 1.0R tiling arrays for 16 hours at 45&#x000b0;C in an Affymetrix GeneChip&#x000ae; Hybridization Oven 640, washed using a GeneChip&#x000ae; Fluidics Station 450, and scanned with a GeneChip&#x000ae; Scanner 7G at EMD SRI. Immunoprecipitated (Stat3, c-Myc, and AcH3) and non-immune (rIgG) control sample biological triplicates were used for ChIP-chip analysis. Mouse promoter 1.0R DNA tiling arrays contain 4.6 million 25-mer oligonucleotide probes covering a distance of -6kb to &#x0002b;2.5kb relative to the transcriptional start site for 28,000 mouse promoter regions annotated from ENSEMBL genes, RefSeq mRNAs (NCBI GenBank&#x000ae;), and complete-CDS mRNAs (NCBI GenBank&#x000ae;). These tiling arrays provide a resolution of 35 bp with 10 bp gaps between probes.</p></sec><sec id="s4d"><title>Peak detection and gene annotation</title><p>Quantile normalization, including probe intensity computation and log2 adjustment was applied to Affymetrix tiling array data (Stat3, c-Myc, and Input) using CisGenome (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.biostat.jhsph.edu/~hji/cisgenome/">http://www.biostat.jhsph.edu/&#x002dc;hji/cisgenome/</ext-link>).

MA statistics was applied to analyze the tiling array data <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003932-Ji1">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref>. Post filtering included discarding peaks if the total length was less than 100 bp or there were less than 3 continuous probes passing the cutoff. Peak post filtering also included merging two adjacent peaks if the gap between the two peaks was less than 300 bp and the there were less than 5 probes that did not pass the cutoff between the two peaks. FDR statistics (left tail) were also estimated. TileMap utilizes a two-step approach for analyzing DNA binding regions. First, a hierarchical empirical Bayes model is used to compute a test-statistic for each probe <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003932-Ji1">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref>. Second, probe test-statistics in a genomic region are used to determine significance of hybridization. Enrichment peaks were annotated with the closest gene and defined by the distance upstream to the TSS and the distance downstream of the TES. Build 36 of the mouse genome was used in these analyses.</p></sec><sec id="s4e"><title>Confirmation of ChIP-chip binding regions using Q-PCR</title><p>Primers were designed for Stat3 and c-Myc ES cell ChIP-enriched genomic DNA regions using Primer 3 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://frodo.wi.mit.edu/">http://frodo.wi.mit.edu/</ext-link>).
