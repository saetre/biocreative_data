To search for anabolic drug targets for osteoporosis therapy, it is crucial to understand the biology of bone forming cells, osteoblasts, in terms of their proliferation, differentiation, and function. Here we found that protein palmitoylation participates in signaling pathways that control osterix expression and osteoblast differentiation. Mouse calvarial osteoblasts express most of the 24 palmitoyl transferases, with some being up-regulated during differentiation. Inhibition of protein palmitoylation, with a substrate-analog inhibitor, diminished osteoblast differentiation and mineralization, but not proliferation or survival. The decrease in differentiation capacity is associated with a reduction in osterix, but not Runx2 or Atf4. Inhibition of palmitoyl transferases had little effect in <italic>p53<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> osteoblasts that show accelerated differentiation due to overexpression of osterix, suggesting that osterix, at least partially, mediated the effect of inhibition of palmitoyl transferases on osteoblast differentiation. BMPs are the major driving force of osteoblast differentiation in the differentiation assays. We found that inhibition of palmitoyl transferases also compromised BMP2-induced osteoblast differentiation through down-regulating osterix induction. However, palmitoyl transferases inhibitor did not inhibit Smad1/5/8 activation. Instead, it compromised the activation of p38 MAPK, which are known positive regulators of osterix expression and differentiation. These results indicate that protein palmitoylation plays an important role in BMP-induced MAPK activation, osterix expression, and osteoblast differentiation.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="9"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Bone is a dynamic organ and is constantly remodeled. New bones are formed by osteoblasts to replace the old ones, which are resorbed by osteoclasts. A fine balance between bone formation and bone resorption is needed to maintain an optimal bone mass <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004135-Krane1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004135-Manolagas1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>. Indeed, there exist multiple coupling mechanisms between osteoblasts and osteoclasts <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004135-Martin1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>. For example, osteoblasts can synthesize and secrete cytokines such as M-CSF and RANKL to promote osteoclastogenesis from hematopoietic stem cells of the bone marrow. On the other hand, bone resorption releases TGF&#x003b2; and BMPs that are trapped in the bone matrix, facilitating osteoblast migration, differentiation and function <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004135-Canalis1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>. Disruption of the balance between bone resorption and formation usually leads to osteosclerosis or osteoporosis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004135-Manolagas1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>. Osteoporosis affects one out of every two women and one out of every four men over age 50, and is regarded as a major public health threat. While there are some anti-resorption drugs in clinical use, such as SERMs and bisphosphonates, there is a lack of anabolic drugs. To date, parathyroid hormone (and teriparatide) and strontium ranelate are the only available anabolic drugs in clinical use <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004135-Zaidi1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004135-Goltzman1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>. Increasing efforts are being made to search for more efficient anabolic drugs with lesser adverse effects.</p><p>Osteoblasts are derived from bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) under the influence of growth factors such as BMPs and Wnts <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004135-Manolagas1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004135-Harada1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>. The two transcription factors that are relatively specific to osteoblast, Runx2 and osterix (Osx), play essential roles in osteoblast differentiation from MSC <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004135-Karsenty1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004135-Yang1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>. Deletion of either one by gene targeting leads to the loss of mature osteoblasts and lack of calcified bones <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004135-Rodan1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004135-Nakashima1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>. On the other hand, ectopic expression of Runx2 or Osx enhances osteoblast differentiation and mineralization <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004135-Nakashima1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004135-Ducy1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>. Moreover, there is evidence to support the notion that the levels of Osx determine the differentiation status of osteoblasts <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004135-Kaback1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004135-Wang1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>. Given the importance of Osx in osteoblast differentiation and function, it is important to study the regulation of Osx expression. Recent studies show that Osx can be induced by Notch, BMPs, and TNF and its expression is further controlled by posttranslational regulation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004135-Celil1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004135-Engin1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>. The induction of Osx is believed to mediate the effect of BMPs on osteoblast differentiation. BMPs can transactivate Osx through both the canonical BMP-Smad1/5/8 pathway and the non-canonical BMP-MAPK pathway <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004135-Celil1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004135-Wang2">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Protein function is affected by its expression level, localization, interaction with other proteins, and its posttranslational modifications. Recent studies indicate that many proteins can be modified by palmitoylation on cysteine residues by a family of proteins that contain a unique <italic>zf</italic>-DHHC domain. At least 24 members have been identified in mammalian genome <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004135-Fukata1">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref>. This modification regulates protein localization, trafficking, and stability <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004135-Smotrys1">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004135-Resh1">&#x0005b;25&#x0005d;</xref>. To understand the importance of protein palmitoylation in osteoblast biology, we analyzed the expression of the 24 palmitoyl acyltransferases (PATs) by RT-PCR and found some of them were up-regulated when osteoblasts started to differentiate. More importantly, we found that inhibition of protein palmitoylation with a substrate analog inhibitor impeded osteoblast differentiation and function, which are mediated by altered expression of Osx through the p38 MAPK pathway. This study also suggests that palmitoylation modifies proteins downstream of BMPR and upstream of p38 MAPK and this modification might regulate other cellular events that involve this pathway.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Expression of palmitoyl transferases during osteoblast differentiation</title><p>Protein palmitoylation plays an important role in regulating localization, trafficking, and degradation of a protein, and its interaction with other proteins. To learn whether protein palmitoylation is involved in osteoblast function, we first analyzed the expression of the 24 potential PATs in calvarial osteoblasts at different stages of differentiation by RT-PCR (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0004135-t001">Table 1</xref> for primer sequences). It was found that 20 out of 24 PATs can be detected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004135-g001">Fig. 1A&#x02013;C</xref>). More interestingly, DHHC1, 2, 6, 7, 15, 23, 25 were up-regulated in differentiating osteoblasts compared to non-differentiated cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004135-g001">Fig. 1B</xref>), suggesting that these PATs might play an active role in this process. On the other hand, DHHC9, 12, 13, 18 were slightly down-regulated compared to non-differentiated osteoblasts, while DHHC4, 5, 8, 14, 16, 17, 19, 20, and 24 showed no alteration at the mRNA levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004135-g001">Fig. 1A and 1C</xref>). DHHC3, 11, 21, 22 were undetectable, suggesting that their expression in osteoblasts could be very low. Note that DHHC10 does not exist.

In addition some proteins are palmitoylated in osteoblasts and the modification can be inhibited by the substrate analog inhibitor, 2BP. It was also found that inhibition of PATs with the inhibitor impeded osteoblast differentiation and function, evidenced by a decrease in the expression of ALP, osteocalcin, Osx, and in bone nodule formation. Moreover, this inhibitor also compromised BMP2-induced osteoblast differentiation. However, treatment of the cells with the same concentration of palmitic acid did not show such effects. In addition, inhibition of PATs showed little effect on osteoblast proliferation and survival under differentiation assay conditions. These results suggest that protein palmitoylation plays an important role in osteoblast differentiation.</p><p>How does protein palmitoylation regulate osteoblast differentiation? Our results suggest that Osx might mediate this effect. Firstly, treatment with PAT inhibitor down-regulated Osx expression, not Runx2 or Atf4. Secondly, BMP2-induced osteoblast differentiation was also hindered by the PAT inhibitor and this was accompanied by a decrease in the expression of Osx, but not Runx2. Thirdly, when Osx could not be repressed in <italic>p53<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> osteoblasts, which showed enhanced differentiation due to elevated Osx expression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004135-Wang1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>, osteoblast differentiation was refractory to the inhibitory effect of the PAT inhibitor. Thus it appears that protein palmitoylation is required for the basal expression of Osx and the induction of Osx by BMP2. These results also support the notion that Osx might be a critical transcription factor that integrates many cues to control osteoblast differentiation. For example, c-Abl, p53, Atm, and p38 MAPK are all involved in osteoblast differentiation and they all regulate the expression of Osx, but not Runx2 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004135-Wang1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004135-Wang2">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004135-Li2">&#x0005b;33&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004135-Rasheed1">&#x0005b;34&#x0005d;</xref>. One explanation for the difference between Runx2 and Osx could be that Runx2 induction by BMPs is usually transient and modest, whereas Osx induction can be long lasting and robust (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004135-g004">Fig. 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004135-g006">6</xref>).</p><p>BMPs are synthesized and secreted by osteoblasts and are the main driving force of <italic>in vitro</italic> differentiation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004135-Wang2">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>. The observation that PAT inhibitor compromised Osx induction by BMP2 suggests that protein palmitoylation might be involved in signaling pathways activated by BMPs. However, PAT inhibitor did not show a marked effect on the canonical BMP-Smad signaling. Instead, it compromised MAPK activation at the basal level and in the presence of BMP2. One possibility is that components of the non-canonical pathway such as Tak1, Tab1/2, Xiap, MAPKKs, are palmitoylated <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004135-Mishina1">&#x0005b;35&#x0005d;</xref>. Another possibility is that BMPRs are palmitoylated and their palmitoylation differentially regulates the Smad pathway and the MAPK pathway. Indeed, we found that BMPRI and II could be palmitoylated. We are currently mapping the palmitoylation sites and studying their role in regulating BMPs triggered Smad and MAPK pathways (Leong et al, unpublished results). Further studies are needed to determine how protein palmitoylation affects MAPK activation through BMP receptors. This is because BMP-Smad signaling and MAPK activation can be complex: i) MAPKs are regulated by many cues including growth factors that are present in the culture medium, and some types of stress; ii) BMPs have been reported to either activate or inhibit MAPKs, depending on the cell type and context <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004135-Wang2">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004135-ZuzarteLuis1">&#x0005b;36&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004135-Qi1">&#x0005b;37&#x0005d;</xref>; iii) BMPs are known to require cooperation with other signaling pathways to control the expression of target genes due to the nature of Smad binding elements (only 4 bp) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004135-Massague1">&#x0005b;38&#x0005d;</xref>; iv) a crosstalk exists between BMP-Smad signaling and MAPK <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004135-Massague1">&#x0005b;38&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004135-Pera1">&#x0005b;39&#x0005d;</xref>. Thus it is important that caution be exercised in interpreting these results. Nevertheless, this study provides a new dimension in p38 MAPK activation and osteoblast differentiation. Future study will focus on identifying the palmitoylation target and studying the function of the palmitoylation in regulating Osx expression and osteoblast differentiation.</p><p>In summary, this is the first study to show that protein palmitoylation plays an important role in osteoblast differentiation and function. It seems that the potential palmitoylation substrates might regulate the MAPK pathway, especially p38 MAPK, to regulate Osx expression and osteoblast differentiation. Given the importance of BMPs activated signaling pathways in bone remodeling and cancer development, it is worth the effort to further study how protein palmitoylation affects these signaling events.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Isolation, culture and treatment of calvarial osteoblasts</title><p>To prepare primary osteoblasts, calvaria were excised from 4&#x02013;5 newborn pups (<italic>p53<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> and wild type on a 129/Sv background), washed in PBS and digested in MEM alpha medium containing 0.1&#x00025; collagenase type V &#x00026; 0.05&#x00025; trypsin-EDTA for 15 min at 37<sup>o</sup>C five times.

A palmitate analog inhibitor, 2-bromohexadecanoic acid (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany) was dissolved in 100&#x00025; ethanol at a stock concentration of 100 mM and added to cells at the respective concentrations with ethanol as the control.</p></sec><sec id="s4b"><title>Alkaline phosphatase (ALP) staining and quantitation</title><p>Calvarial cells were seeded on 12-well plate at a density of 1.5&#x000d7;10<sup>5</sup> cells in differentiation medium (growth medium supplemented with 50 &#x000b5;g/ml ascorbic acid and 10 mM &#x003b2;-glycerophosphate) and incubated at 37&#x000b0;C for 4 or 7 days. For ALP staining, the differentiation medium was removed and the cells were fixed with fixative solution &#x0005b;60&#x00025; v/v acetone and 0.8&#x00025; v/v citrate concentrate (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO)&#x0005d; for 30 seconds before rinsing with deionized water for 45 seconds. For the biochemical assay, cell layer was rinsed twice with Tris buffered saline &#x0005b;20 mM Tris in 0.9&#x00025; NaCl, pH 7.4&#x0005d; before harvesting in 500 &#x000b5;l of 50 mM Tris, pH 7.4 buffer. The cell suspension was sonicated for 20 seconds. The ALP activity was assayed in 221 assay buffer &#x0005b;0.1 M 221 buffer (Sigma-Aldrich), 10 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, pH 10.3&#x0005d; with 10 mM p-nitrophenylphosphate (Sigma-Aldrich) as the substrate. The reaction was stopped upon the addition of 0.3 N NaOH and the absorbance was read at 405 nm. The enzyme activity was then normalized with the protein concentration.</p></sec><sec id="s4c"><title>Bone nodule formation</title><p>Calvarial cells were seeded as for ALP staining but were incubated for 14 and 21 days. Cells were rinsed twice with Tris buffered saline and followed by fixing with 4&#x00025; formalin for 5 to 10 minutes. The fixed cells were then rinsed twice with ddH<sub>2</sub>O. Mineral deposition was stained with 5&#x00025; silver nitrate and exposed under UV until desired intensity was achieved before washing with ddH<sub>2</sub>O.</p></sec><sec id="s4d"><title>RNA isolation and Quantitative RT-PCR</title><p>Total RNA was extracted from cells after rinsing twice with ice-cold PBS and purified with TRIzol&#x000ae; reagent (Invitrogen) according to manufacturer's protocol. cDNAs were synthesized from 1 &#x000b5;g of total RNA using Reverse-It&#x02122; RTase Blend (Abgene, Epsom, UK) with Oligo(dT)<sub>15</sub>. The detection and quantification of target mRNA was performed with semiquantitative RT-PCR. The primer sequences for the respective genes are shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0004135-t001">Table 1</xref>. The amplification for each mRNA was performed in the linear range for RT-PCR by optimizing the template concentration and limiting the amplification cycles to below 30 to ensure exponential amplification.</p></sec><sec id="s4e"><title>Western blot analysis</title><p>The cells were rinsed twice with ice-cold PBS and harvested by scraping in 80 &#x000b5;l RIPA buffer &#x0005b;50 mM Tris, pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 1&#x00025; (v/v) NP-40, 0.5&#x00025; (w/v) NaDOC, 0.1&#x00025; SDS, 1 &#x000b5;g/ml aprotinin, 1 &#x000b5;g/ml leupeptin, 1 &#x000b5;g/ml pepstatin, 2 mM PMSF, 2 mM NaF, 4 mM Na<sub>3</sub>VO<sub>4</sub>&#x0005d;, followed by rocking at 4&#x000b0;C for 30 minutes. The cell lysates were then clarified by centrifugation at 12,000 g for 10 minutes. The proteins were quantified using DC protein assay (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA). 60 &#x000b5;g proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE and then electrophoretically transferred to PVDF membrane. The membrane was blocked with 5&#x00025; non-fat milk for an hour and probed with the respective primary antibodies overnight at 4&#x000b0;C. After incubation, the membrane was washed thrice with TBST for 10 minutes each and probed with respective secondary antibodies for an hour. Finally, the membrane was washed thrice with TBST and target proteins were detected using ECL kit (GE Healthcare, Buckinghamshire, UK). The primary antibodies used for analysis were anti-Erk1/2, phospho-Erk1/2, p38 MAPK, phospho-p38 MAPK, p53, phospho-Smad1/5/8 (Cell Signaling, Danvers, MA), anti-Smad1 (Millipore, Billerica, MA), anti-&#x003b2;-actin (Sigma-Aldrich).</p></sec><sec id="s4f"><title>Protein labeling with <sup>3</sup>&#x0005b;H&#x0005d;-palmitic acid</title><p>Calvarial cells were pretreated with 100 &#x000b5;M 2-BP for 4 hours before the treatment with 50 &#x000b5;Ci &#x0005b;9, 10-<sup>3</sup>H(N)&#x0005d;-palmitic acid (Perkin Elmer, Waltham, MA) for 24 hours.
