In order to further characterize this event, we developed a mouse model restricting LacZ to thymic stromal cotransporter (TSCOT)-expressing thymic stromal cells (TDLacZ). The thymus of this mouse contains approximately 4,300 TSCOT<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> cells, each expressing several thousand molecules of the LacZ antigen. TSCOT<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> cells express the cortical marker CDR1, CD40, CD80, CD54, and major histocompatibility complex class II (MHCII). When examining endogenous responses directed against LacZ, we observed significant tolerance. This was evidenced in a diverse T cell repertoire as measured by both a CD4 T cell proliferation assay and an antigen-specific antibody isotype analysis. This tolerance process was at least partially independent of <italic>Autoimmune Regulatory Element</italic> gene expression. When TDLacZ mice were crossed to a novel CD4 T cell receptor (TCR) transgenic reactive against LacZ (BgII), there was a complete deletion of double-positive thymocytes. Fetal thymic reaggregate culture of CD45- and UEA-depleted thymic stromal cells from TDLacZ and sorted TCR-bearing thymocytes excluded the possibility of cross presentation by thymic dendritic cells and medullary epithelial cells for the deletion. Overall, these results demonstrate that the introduction of a neoantigen into TSCOT-expressing cells can efficiently establish complete tolerance and suggest a possible application for the deletion of antigen-specific T cells by antigen introduction into TSCOT<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> cells.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><sec id="st1"><title/><p>T cells play critical roles in the immune response. While developing in the thymus (from whence T cells and their precursors, thymocytes, derive their name), thymocytes are selected for the ability to recognize harmful antigen (positive selection), while those that respond to antigens present in their own body are eliminated (negative selection). Dogma holds that the thymus is divided into different functional compartments to ensure that these contrasting selection processes occur efficiently: the cortex is thought to be responsible for positive selection and the medulla for negative selection. In this study, we made use of a novel transgenic mouse (carrying a LacZ marker in a small fraction of cells in the cortex) to test whether the cortex is really excluded from negative selection. We were able to show that the introduced LacZ &#x0201c;antigen&#x0201d; present only in the cortical cells leads them to eliminate any LacZ-reactive T cells from the immune repertoire and leads to tolerance of the LacZ &#x0201c;antigen&#x0201d; by the body's immune system. This process is highly efficient, such that a relatively tiny number of antigen molecules present in a small fraction of the cells in the thymic cortex can singularly perform proofreading of all developing thymocytes.</p></sec></abstract><abstract abstract-type="toc"><p>A new study shows that antigen-specific negative selection of developing thymocytes is a property of thymic cortical epithelial cells, challenging the view that this process requires contact with specialized antigen-presenting cells found in the thymic medulla.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="12"/></counts><custom-meta-wrap><custom-meta><meta-name>citation</meta-name><meta-value>Ahn S, Lee G, Yang SJ, Lee D, Lee S, et al.

In the periphery, organ-specific tolerance can be established by various other mechanisms, including anergy &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060191-b003">3</xref>&#x0005d;, ignorance &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060191-b004">4</xref>&#x0005d;, and regulatory T cells &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060191-b005">5</xref>&#x0005d;.

For a diverse T cell repertoire, this negative selection process occurs primarily in the thymic medullary compartment (reviewed in &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060191-b007">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060191-b008">8</xref>&#x0005d;). The major player among the hematopoietic cells is the dendritic cell (DC), which possesses a highly efficient antigen presentation capability. In addition, it is widely accepted that thymic medullary epithelial cells (mTEC) that express low levels of tissue-specific peripheral antigens in a promiscuous/ectopic fashion &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060191-b009">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060191-b010">10</xref>&#x0005d; can also initiate clonal deletion. Discovery of the <italic>AIRE</italic> gene and its expression in mTEC has led to an understanding of its critical regulatory role in the removal of autoreactive T cells, particularly against tissue-specific antigens expressed in the endocrine system (reviewed in &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060191-b011">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060191-b012">12</xref>&#x0005d;). However, AIRE is also expressed in non-mTEC, including thymic DC &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060191-b013">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060191-b014">14</xref>&#x0005d; and in cortical thymic epithelial cells (cTEC) from Rag-2&#x02013;deficient thymus &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060191-b015">15</xref>&#x0005d;. Furthermore, the cross-presentation pathway can participate in the CD4 and CD8 tolerance for the membrane-bound antigens &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060191-b016">16</xref>&#x0005d;. Therefore, the natures of cell types responsible for the tolerance induction still remain unsettled.</p><p>The role of cortical epithelium in tolerance induction has been controversial (reviewed in &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060191-b017">17</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060191-b020">20</xref>&#x0005d;). Several experiments using thymus transplantation have clearly indicated that thymic epithelium exhibits toleragenic function &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060191-b021">21</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060191-b024">24</xref>&#x0005d;. In contrast, experiments using transgenic mice with targeting of major histocompatibility complex class II (MHCII) &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060191-b025">25</xref>&#x0005d; or MHCI &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060191-b026">26</xref>&#x0005d; molecules to the thymic cortical compartment (and the skin) using a fortuitous keratin 14 promoter led to the conclusion that cTEC are not capable of inducing tolerance. Such results have given rise to the idea that the thymic microenvironment is compartmentalized, with positive selection taking place in the cortex and negative selection in the medulla. If this is a true dogma, there will be autoimmune responses to the antigens specifically expressed in the cortical epithelial cells. However, when other antigens were targeted into cTEC using the same promoter, incomplete but significant tolerance to the specific antigens was observed &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060191-b027">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060191-b028">28</xref>&#x0005d;. In the case of a circulating antigen (C5), all types of thymic APC, including the cTEC, could effect efficient negative selection in vitro &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060191-b029">29</xref>&#x0005d;. Finally, the question of the role of circulating peripheral DC in the induction of thymic tolerance has also been raised &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060191-b030">30</xref>&#x0005d; and tested true &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060191-b031">31</xref>&#x0005d;.</p><p>Experiments regarding the ability of cTEC to efficiently present antigens have also been controversial. In early studies, the death of cortical thymocytes upon activation by antibody or peptides was interpreted as resulting from antigen presentation by the cortical stromal cells &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060191-b032">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060191-b033">33</xref>&#x0005d;. In addition, a study with purified thymic APC suggested that cTEC were able to present antigens to a self-reactive hybridoma, with an efficiency comparable to that of thymic DC &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060191-b034">34</xref>&#x0005d;. However, later studies indicated that a cell line with cTEC properties was inefficient in processing antigens both in vitro and in vivo &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060191-b035">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060191-b036">36</xref>&#x0005d;. In contrast, Volkmann and his colleagues, using enriched stromal cell preparations from adult thymus, demonstrated that cTEC are able to present soluble antigens as efficiently as DC or mTEC in reaggregate cultures. In many, if not all, of the above studies, however, difficulties in interpretation still persist, in particular, because of a lack of sufficient understanding about the nature of the defined cTEC subpopulation under study, as well as the purity of the cells expressing the specific antigens that were used in the assays. More recently, Gray and colleagues reported that well-defined, purified cTEC, as well as mTEC, express costimulatory molecules and can stimulate naive T cells as much as thymic dendritic cells do in vitro &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060191-b037">37</xref>&#x0005d;. Therefore, we felt it was necessary to re-evaluate the role of the cTEC subpopulation in central tolerance induction using a different model system, one perhaps better suited to more directly answering the question of whether subpopulation of cTEC can present endogenous antigens and whether this can lead to deletion of thymocytes.</p><p>Previously, in an effort to separate thymic epithelial cell (TEC) components, we introduced a new marker (Ly110), designated thymic stromal cotransporter (TSCOT), which is expressed in a specific TEC subpopulation. TSCOT is a putative 12-transmembrane protein, located mainly in the thymic cortex &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060191-b038">38</xref>&#x0005d;. TSCOT is not expressed in any other tissues, as detected by quantitative reverse-transcription PCR (RT-PCR) &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060191-b039">39</xref>&#x0005d;. It is also not expressed in thymocytes &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060191-b038">38</xref>&#x0005d;. TSCOT<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> thymic stromal cells are all MHCII<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> and CDR1<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>/6C3<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>, well-defined cortical epithelial markers &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060191-b040">40</xref>&#x0005d;, with observable variations in levels during different developmental stages &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060191-b041">41</xref>&#x0005d;. In this study, we introduce a new mouse model system called TSCOT delta LacZ (TDLacZ) that expresses a &#x003b2;-galactosidase (&#x003b2;-gal) in the TEC subpopulation. This model system constitutes a new tool for the study of TEC development and function. First, we were able to follow TSCOT-expressing TEC by &#x003b2;-gal activity assays or antibody staining and flow cytometry using an anti-TSCOT monoclonal antibody (mAb) &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060191-b041">41</xref>&#x0005d;. LacZ enzymatic activity could also be assayed for the location of cells with a high degree of sensitivity, in both sections and the whole organism, and expression could be assessed in a quantitative manner. Second, because the protein is generated by an endogenous promoter, this system is designed to express normal doses of neoself-antigen relative to other competing cellular proteins. This is in contrast to some previous systems for the targeting of cortical expression, in which MHC molecules were displayed at unusually low levels &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060191-b019">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060191-b026">26</xref>&#x0005d;. Third, the absence of the TSCOT promoter activity in peripheral tissues precludes the involvement of recirculating DCs, which might deliver peripheral antigens to the thymus, and present them ectopically.</p><p>By targeting LacZ protein as a neoantigen within the TSCOT-expressing thymic epithelium, we were able to demonstrate that TSCOT<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>CDR1<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> TEC alone, without any help from the mTEC or DC, is able to establish deletional tolerance in an AIRE-independent manner with a surprisingly high degree of efficiency.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>A TDLacZ Mouse Model for TEC Subpopulation-Specific Antigen Expression</title><p>We established a new system by knocking-in the <italic>LacZ</italic> gene into the TSCOT locus between two BamHI sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060191-g001">Figure 1</xref>A).

The small difference in the fraction of stromal cell populations was within the experimental variations. There was also no difference detected in the profiles between hetero- and homozygote littermates of the various ages (unpublished data). The N-terminal portion including transmembrane spans 1&#x02013;4 of the protein still remained expressed on the cell surface, as detected by flow cytometry (unpublished data). The only apparent difference was for the total thymocyte yield at 6 wk of age, which was slightly lower in about one-third of the TDLacZ homozygotes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060191-g001">Figure 1</xref>D). However, we failed to detect any reproducible differences in the profiles of thymocyte population except the individual variation. In addition, an analysis of 6-mo-old mice also showed no significant differences detected in the recovery of thymocytes and major profiles of CD25, CD44, CD4, and CD8 (unpublished data). When 5CC7 T cell receptor (TCR) Tg mouse was bred with TDL, no significant differences for the thymocyte populations were found in selecting or nonselecting background (F. Flomerfelt, unpublished data).</p><p>When &#x003b2;-gal activity was assessed in TDLacZ mice at embryonic day 11 (E11), the time at which thymus organogenesis is initiated, LacZ was already expressed in the two separated thymic rudiments, but it was not expressed in the wild-type littermates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060191-g001">Figure 1</xref>F). This expression was not detected in any other organs. At E16, when the thymus harbors mostly developing double-negative (DN) and double-positive (DP) cells, thymic expression of LacZ also was very clear (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060191-g001">Figure 1</xref>G). In addition, endogenous &#x003b2;-gal activity appeared in the TDLacZ intestine at E16, as in the wild-type control (unpublished data). &#x003b2;-gal activity in thymus samples from newborn TDLacZ pups showed a gene dose dependency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060191-g001">Figure 1</xref>H).</p><p>We next located the LacZ-expressing cells in thymic sections. At the newborn stage, anti-LacZ antibody staining revealed the expression mostly in the thymic cortex as expected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060191-g002">Figure 2</xref>A). When the thymus had fully matured (8 wk of age), LacZ activity was also detected in the cortex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060191-g002">Figure 2</xref>B).

After careful examination, we occasionally found LacZ staining extends to corticomedullary junction (unpublished data and see later).

However, there are cases in which LacZ activity staining extends to the corticomedullary junction of mature TDLacZ thymus and TSCOT marker also stains uncharacterized minor population of cells (unpublished data). A part of these minor populations could be developing transitional TEC, but this possibility requires further detailed study with an improved technology that can handle an extremely small number of cells. Nonetheless, it is clear that TSCOT<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> cells are not part of conventional medullary cells.

Our current findings using a specific TSCOT promoter corroborate the notion that cTEC participate in the establishment of CD4 central tolerance in a highly efficient manner. There is no evidence for autoreactivity to specific antigens presented by the TSCOT<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> cells. Instead, we found clear tolerance to LacZ antigen. Therefore, the TSCOT<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> TEC niche of the cTEC subpopulation is not excluded from the tolerance induction so that it may avoid autoreactivity against its own cell.</p></sec><sec id="s3b"><title>The Mechanism of Tolerance Induction by the TSCOT<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> TEC Subset</title><p>Taking advantage of sensitive enzymatic activity, our estimate for LacZ under the control of the TSCOT promoter is about 6,000 (the average of two measurements) molecules per TSCOT<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> TEC in homozygote thymus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060191-g003">Figure 3</xref>).

Previous accurate estimates &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060191-b056">56</xref>&#x0005d; have suggested that recognition of only three to four peptide/MHC complexes by an immature thymocyte was sufficient to generate a negative selection event in transgenic mouse. Therefore, it remains a challenging question as to how such a high efficiency is achieved. The number of cTEC in the adult thymus is far less than that of mTEC &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060191-b043">43</xref>&#x0005d;. The total number of TSCOT<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> TEC, estimated from a large pool of adult thymuses, was only on the order of several thousand per thymus. In order to screen all of the developing thymocytes for potential autoreactivity, the frequency of cell encounters between cTEC presenting the specific antigen and thymocytes would have to be optimized, even considering the average 3-d period in which DP thymocytes remain in the cortex &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060191-b057">57</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060191-b058">58</xref>&#x0005d;.

In contrast, in our anti-LacZ TCR Tg &#x000d7; TDLacZ model, it is evident that deletion is the dominant mechanism (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060191-g007">Figure 7</xref>).

However, DP thymocytes included in the RTOC were also deleted, arguing that cTEC-induced tolerance involves the specific deletion rather than the arrest at premature developmental stage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060191-g008">Figure 8</xref>B).</p><p>In the TDLacZ thymus, cortical epithelium expressing a specific antigen was able to tolerize quite thoroughly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060191-g007">Figures 7</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060191-g008">8</xref>). This was somewhat surprising if thymic epithelial cells are poor presenters of antigen as concluded earlier on the poor expression of costimulatory molecules in cTEC &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060191-b063">63</xref>&#x0005d;. However, we clearly show that TSCOT<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> cTEC express high levels of MHCII, CD54, CD40, and CD80. Surface CD40 and CD80 proteins in particular are expressed at surprising levels that are even higher than those of mTEC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060191-g006">Figure 6</xref>). According to the RT-PCR result from the purified cells, CD40, CD80, and CD86 message levels are slightly higher in mTEC than cTEC (&#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060191-b037">37</xref>&#x0005d; and unpublished data). Among cTEC, TSCOT<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> cells are the ones expressing more costimulatory molecules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060191-g006">Figures 6</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0060191-sg001">S1</xref>). Therefore, molecules on the TSCOT<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>cTEC can provide the environment for the highly efficient deletional tolerance of TCR bearing early thymocytes <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0060191-sg002">Figure S2</xref>) through a unique TSCOT<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> cTEC antigen presentation process. As seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060191-g007">figure 7</xref>C, massive apoptosis events in DN TCR transgenic cells in the presence of the LacZ antigen-bearing cTEC are also consistent with the deletional tolerance.</p><p>In order to determine the molecular mechanism underlying the induction of tolerance, we determined whether or not AIRE was involved. It has been fairly well established that AIRE is involved in mTEC-mediated tolerance induction by facilitating the expression of peripheral antigens in normal and genetically modified animals &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060191-b012">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060191-b064">64</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060191-b065">65</xref>&#x0005d;. As a result of the introduction of one copy of the LacZ gene into AIRE-deficient animals, the LacZ-specific CD4 proliferative response was significantly reduced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060191-g005">Figure 5</xref>). Since AIRE expression was, mostly, assumed to be absent in the normal CDR1<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> cTEC (except Rag1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup>), it is not surprising that AIRE was not directly involved in TSCOT<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> TEC-induced tolerance. Instead, it may suggest that the AIRE-independent tolerance pathway exists in the TSCOT<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> TEC. However, there was still the question of whether tolerance was induced by AIRE-expressing DC or mTEC, via a cross-presentation. The results obtained with RTOC using thymocytes from LacZ-specific TCR transgenic mice and purified CD45<sup>&#x02212;</sup>UEA-1<sup>&#x02212;</sup>CDR1<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> cells from 2-dGuo&#x02013;treated FTOC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060191-g007">Figure 7</xref>) show that neither DC nor mTEC are necessary for tolerance induction in vitro. The direct involvement of TSCOT<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> TEC in deletional tolerance constitutes strong evidence for the capacity of direct antigen presentation &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060191-b029">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060191-b032">32</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060191-b036">36</xref>&#x0005d;.

The quantitative aspects discussed above seem insufficient to explain negative selection by a simple affinity/avidity model for cTEC.

Thus, if a self-peptide was presented at sufficiently high concentrations to display multiple complexes in the same aggregate at any one time, these MHCII aggregates could potentially generate high-avidity signaling leading to thymocyte death. If so, then cortical epithelium could function directly in both negative and positive selection. In line with this notion, it has been shown that a single cTEC line can mediate both positive and negative selection &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060191-b068">68</xref>&#x0005d;.

This would hinder an avidity-based mechanism from operating as there would be no multimeric presentation. Although such monomeric presentation might be adequate for positive selection, it seems that it would be inadequate for negative selection. This raises the possibility that other mechanisms might exist for increasing the antigen density on cTEC.
