The extrinsic pathway responds to extracellular signals through death receptors at the plasma membrane (e.g., Fas and TNF-R1), whereas the intrinsic pathway is activated by intracellular stress. The intrinsic apoptotic cascade involves the release of apoptogenic factors (including cytochrome <italic>c</italic> and second mitochondria-derived activator of caspases [Smac]/Diablo) from mitochondria to the cytosol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Wang, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">van Loo et al., 2002</xref>). The release of apoptogenic factors requires permeabilization of the mitochondrial outer membrane, a process regulated by the Bcl-2 family of proteins, which comprises both proapoptotic (e.g., Bax, Bak, and Bid), and antiapoptotic (e.g., Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL) members (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">van Loo et al., 2002</xref>). As for extrinsically induced apoptosis, this can take the course of either one of two pathways depending on cell type. In type I cells, binding of the Fas death receptor induces the &#x0201c;death-inducing signaling complex&#x0201d; (DISC) on the plasma membrane and activates a large amount of the initiator protease, caspase-8, which then cleaves and activates the executioner protease caspase-3. However, in type II cells, caspase-8 activation at the plasma membrane is limited, and the apoptotic signal relies on amplification from the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Scaffidi et al., 1998</xref>). Thus, in type II cells, after the activation of Fas at the plasma membrane, the extrinsic apoptotic pathway converges with the intrinsic one: caspase-8 cleaves Bid to its active form tBid, which induces mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization and release of apoptogenic factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Li et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Luo et al., 1998</xref>).</p><p>Cardiolipin (CL), a phospholipid of the mitochondrial membrane, participates in several mitochondria-dependent apoptotic steps (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Gonzalvez and Gottlieb, 2007</xref>), including the proapoptotic function of Bcl-2 proteins. CL can serve as a &#x0201c;docking site&#x0201d; for tBid on the mitochondrial membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Lutter et al., 2000</xref>) and is required for Bax activation and mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kuwana et al., 2002</xref>). By anchoring cytochrome <italic>c</italic> to the mitochondrial inner membrane, CL both facilitates the electron transport chain and encumbers cytochrome <italic>c</italic> release during apoptosis, which indicates that the complete release of cytochrome <italic>c</italic> requires the disruption of its interactions with CL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Shidoji et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Ott et al., 2002</xref>). This is further supported by the fact that CL peroxidation, catalyzed by cytochrome <italic>c</italic>, is required for cytochrome <italic>c</italic> release from mitochondria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Kagan et al., 2005</xref>).</p><p>Despite the growing body of evidence implicating CL in apoptosis, the mechanism remains unresolved. To address the role of CL in apoptosis in a cellular system, Barth syndrome&#x02013;derived lymphoblastoid cells and Barth syndrome&#x02013;like cells were used. Barth syndrome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Barth et al., 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Kelley et al., 1991</xref>) is the only known human genetic disorder where alterations in CL metabolism are its primary cause (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Hauff and Hatch, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Gonzalvez and Gottlieb, 2007</xref>). Barth syndrome is caused by mutations in <italic>tafazzin</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bione et al., 1996</xref>), which encodes a transacylase that directs CL maturation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Xu et al., 2006</xref>). After synthesis in mitochondria, CL is actively remodeled by tafazzin to generate its mature acyl form. CL contains four acyl chains. During CL maturation, phospholipase A removes one saturated acyl chain to generate monolyso-CL (MLCL) while tafazzin replaces it with an unsaturated acyl chain taken from phosphatidylcholine (PC), a process repeated until remodeling is complete (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Xu et al., 2006</xref>). Therefore, in Barth syndrome, mature CL levels are low, whereas the levels of MLCL are high (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Valianpour et al., 2005</xref>), making it a unique model for studying the role of mature CL in apoptosis in intact cells.</p><p>In this study, we show that CL is required for the type II extrinsic apoptotic pathway. In particular, CL is fundamental for the formation of an apoptotic signaling platform on the mitochondrial outer membrane supporting the recruitment, oligomerization, and processing of caspase-8. This step is critical for the release of apoptogenic factors from the mitochondrial intermembrane space. We show that unlike the type I response to Fas signaling, where caspase-8 is activated on the plasma membrane's DISC, in the type II response, caspase-8 relocates to the mitochondrial outer membrane, where its accumulation and activation relies on CL.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Barth syndrome&#x02013;derived lymphoblastoid cells resist induction of the extrinsic apoptotic pathway</title><p>Lymphoblastoid cells derived from Barth syndrome patients were used to study the role of CL in apoptosis. These cells were isolated from two unrelated patients and were immortalized ex vivo using Epstein-Barr virus infection. Both cell lines, termed DB105.2 and DB105.3, carry an inactive mutant form of <italic>tafazzin</italic>. Analysis of the CL levels in the lymphoblastoid cells showed low CL and high MLCL in the tafazzin-deficient lymphoblastoid cell lines when compared with the two control lymphoblastoid cell lines DB037 and DB015 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 A</xref> and not depicted). Moreover, the acyl chains of the different CL species in Barth syndrome&#x02013;derived cells were less unsaturated, as determined by mass spectrometrical analysis, which showed a shift to higher m/z values within each cluster of CLs. In response to intrinsic death stimuli, such as etoposide or cisplatin, both control and Barth syndrome lymphoblastoid cells underwent cell death to the same extent as measured by propidium iodide (PI) exclusion (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 B</xref>). However, when treated with TNF-&#x003b1; or with anti-Fas antibody, a dramatic decrease in cell death was observed in the CL-deficient Barth syndrome&#x02013;derived lymphoblastoid cells (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 C</xref>), which prompted focus on the role of CL in Fas-mediated apoptosis. FACS demonstrated that cell surface-exposed Fas levels were unaltered in CL-deficient cells (Fig. S1, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200803129/DC1">http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200803129/DC1</ext-link>). However, measurement of Annexin V binding to PI-negative cells (which is indicative of early apoptotic cells) showed a clear reduction in the response of Barth syndrome&#x02013;derived lymphoblastoid cells to anti-Fas antibody compared with control cells (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 D</xref>). These results indicate that CL-deficient lymphoblastoid cells are defective in the pathway that links the death receptor with the core apoptotic machinery.</p><fig position="float" id="fig1"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p><bold>Barth syndrome&#x02013;derived lymphoblastoid cells are resistant to Fas-induced apoptosis.</bold> (A) CL and MLCL profile of control (DB037) and Barth syndrome&#x02013;derived (DB105.2) lymphoblastoid cells as determined by HPLC-MS. CL-i.s. and PG-i.s. are internal standards of known amounts of tetramyristoyl-CL and dimyristoyl-phosphatidylglycerol, respectively. The observed CL clusters (I&#x02013;VI) are: I &#x0003d; 64 carbon atoms (likely 4 &#x000d7; 16); II &#x0003d; 66 carbon atoms; III &#x0003d; 68 carbon atoms; IV &#x0003d; 70 carbon atoms; V &#x0003d; 72 carbon atoms (likely 4 &#x000d7; 18); and VI &#x0003d; 74 carbon atoms.

This step, although dispensable in type I cells, is crucial for apoptosis of type II cells. It is of note that activated human lymphocytes present a type II response to Fas-mediated cell death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Zhang et al., 1996</xref>). To elucidate the involvement of CL in the type II cascade, HeLa cells were used because HeLa cells in which Bid was knocked down with Bid-specific siRNA showed a decrease in Fas-mediated cell death (Fig. S2, A and B, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200803129/DC1">http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200803129/DC1</ext-link>) and reduced caspase-3&#x02013;like activity (DEVDase), which indicates decreased apoptosome activity (Fig. S2 C). Moreover, Bcl-xL overexpression protected these cells from Fas-induced apoptosis (Fig. S2 D), further confirming that HeLa cells have a type II response to extrinsic apoptotic signals and that a Bcl-2&#x02013;regulated, mitochondria-dependent step is required in these cells.</p><p>To generate a model for Barth syndrome, RNA interference was used to knock down tafazzin. Short hairpin RNA (shRNA)-encoding plasmids were constructed using either a <italic>tafazzin</italic>-specific sequence or a nonspecific shRNA control. HeLa cells were stably transfected, and cell clones (shTaz1, shTaz2, shCont1, and shCont2) were isolated. Quantitative PCR analysis showed that in shTaz1 and shTaz2 cells, the endogenous <italic>tafazzin</italic> RNA levels were reduced significantly (Fig. S3, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200803129/DC1">http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200803129/DC1</ext-link>). A corresponding Western blot for endogenous tafazzin confirmed efficient knockdown of the protein (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 A</xref>). Finally, the CL pattern of the tafazzin knockdown cells resembled that of Barth syndrome&#x02013;derived lymphoblastoid cells (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 B</xref>). Although the increase in MLCL is modest compared with Barth syndrome lymphoblastoid cells, a significant and comparable decrease in CL is evident in shTaz1 and shTaz2 cells with a dramatic loss of the major peaks of each cluster of CL species, which indicates severely defective maturation of CL (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 B</xref>). Moreover, like Barth syndrome patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Vreken et al., 2000</xref>), lack of <italic>tafazzin</italic> in HeLa cells has no effect on other major phospholipids (Fig. S4).</p><fig position="float" id="fig2"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><p><bold>Tafazzin-deficient HeLa cells display low CL levels and are resistant to Fas-induced apoptosis.</bold> (A) Cells were stably transfected with either control shRNA-encoding plasmid (shCont1 and 2) or with <italic>tafazzin</italic>-targeting shRNA (shTaz1 and 2). Western blot analysis of endogenous tafazzin protein was used to confirm efficient knockdown of the protein. The shTaz1R clone was generated by reintroducing shRNA-resistant cDNA of tafazzin into shTaz1 cells. (B) The CL and MLCL profile of shCont1, shTaz1, shTaz2, and shTaz1R cells was analyzed as in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 A</xref>. (C) Cell death analysis of the control, tafazzin-deficient, and revertant clone (shTaz1R) was performed 48 h after treatment with anti-Fas antibody. (D) DEVDase (caspase-3&#x02013;like) activity of the indicated cells was performed 8 h after anti-Fas antibody treatment. Error bars represent &#x000b1; standard deviation.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="jcb1830681f02"></graphic></fig><p>Similar to Barth syndrome lymphoblastoid cells, tafazzin knockdown HeLa cells were highly resistant to anti-Fas antibody-induced apoptosis (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 C</xref>), and after Fas activation, they showed reduced DEVDase activity (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 D</xref>). It is worth mentioning that, unlike Barth syndrome lymphoblastoid cells, tafazzin-knockdown HeLa cells were partially resistant to high doses of cisplatin or etoposide (unpublished data). This resistance to intrinsic cell death may be caused by the inactive p53 pathway of HeLa cells, and indicates that in these cells, an alternative, CL-dependent apoptotic pathway (potentially via an extrinsic loop) may be needed for efficient apoptosis induced by chemotherapeutic agents. To confirm that the Fas resistance is not caused by an off-target effect of the shRNA, silent mutations were introduced into the cDNA of human <italic>tafazzin</italic>, and shTaz1 cells were transfected with this mutant to generate a revertant clone (shTaz1R). shTaz1R cells expressed tafazzin to a level comparable to the endogenous protein (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 A</xref>), and CL levels were comparable to those of control cells (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 B</xref>). Importantly, shTaz1R cells were highly sensitive to Fas-induced apoptosis (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 C</xref>). Collectively, these data indicated that tafazzin is required for efficient Fas-induced apoptosis.</p><p>To confirm that loss of mature CL and not the loss of tafazzin itself is the cause of apoptosis resistance in tafazzin-deficient cells, tafazzin was transiently knocked down for 48 h using siRNA oligonucleotides. HeLa cells were transfected with a plasmid encoding a GFP-tafazzin fusion protein and with either nonspecific or <italic>tafazzin</italic>-targeting siRNAs. The GFP-tafazzin protein colocalized with the mitochondria-specific fluorescent dye tetramethyl rhodamine ethyl ester (TMRE), confirming its location in the mitochondria, and was efficiently knocked down in cells transfected with <italic>tafazzin</italic>-specific siRNA (Fig. S5 A, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200803129/DC1">http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200803129/DC1</ext-link>). The efficiency of the tafazzin-targeting siRNA was further verified by Western blot analysis (Fig. S5 B). However, under these conditions, the CL pattern was unaltered in these cells, likely because of the low turnover of the lipids in these cells (Fig. S5 C). It was previously shown that, in the liver, the half-life of CL is the longest of all mitochondrial phospholipids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Landriscina et al., 1976</xref>). Importantly, transient depletion of tafazzin (without affecting the CL level) in HeLa cells did not modify the sensitivity of these cells to Fas-induced apoptosis (Fig. S5 D), ruling out a CL-independent role for tafazzin in the apoptotic process.</p></sec><sec><title>Cytochrome <italic>c</italic> release is impaired in Fas-induced CL-deficient cells</title><p>To understand the role of CL in Fas-induced apoptosis, the known steps of this pathway were investigated in tafazzin-knockdown cells. Caspase-3, which in type II cells requires cytochrome <italic>c</italic> release and apoptosome formation for its activation, showed a marked decrease in both autocleavage and cleavage of its substrate poly-ADP ribose polymerase (PARP; <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 A</xref>). Next, the Fas-induced release of cytochrome <italic>c</italic> and Smac/Diablo from mitochondria of tafazzin-knockdown cells was analyzed by immunostaining. It is worth mentioning that the levels of cytochrome <italic>c</italic> within the mitochondria were unaltered in untreated cells regardless of the CL status (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figs. 3 B</xref> and <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4 C</xref>). Although in many control cells (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 B and C</xref>, white arrows), cytochrome <italic>c</italic> and Smac/Diablo appeared in the cytosol after Fas activation, both proteins were retained in the mitochondria in all CL-deficient cells (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3, B and C</xref>). Western blot analysis of cytosolic fractions confirmed a block in cytochrome <italic>c</italic> release from the mitochondria of tafazzin-knockdown cells after Fas activation (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 D</xref>). Therefore, the apoptotic block in CL-deficient cells is caused by defects in mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization or upstream events.</p><fig position="float" id="fig3"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><p><bold>Tafazzin-deficient cells are defective in cytochrome <italic>c</italic> and Smac/Diablo release from mitochondria and in the activation of caspase-3 after Fas activation.</bold> (A) Caspase-3 activity of control (shCont1) and tafazzin-deficient HeLa cells (shTaz2) was monitored in untreated, anti-Fas antibody-treated for 14 h (Fas), and anti-Fas antibody&#x02013; and DEVD-fmk&#x02013;treated cells (FasDEVD).

In agreement with the results observed in cells, the response of CL-deficient mitochondria to tBid was comparable to control mitochondria (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4, B and C</xref>). Moreover, tBid incorporated into mitochondria (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 C</xref>) and induced Bak oligomerization (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4, D and E</xref>) to the same extent in both tafazzin-deficient and control cells. The explanation for these surprising observations could be that the less-mature CL in tafazzin-deficient cells is sufficient for tBid interaction with mitochondria. Indeed, it has been previously demonstrated that tBid can efficiently interact with MLCL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Esposti et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Liu et al., 2005</xref>).

Because of technical difficulties in immunodetecting tBid in total cell extracts, changes in the levels of full-length Bid rather than of tBid were initially measured. Fas activation decreased the levels of full-length Bid in control but not in CL-deficient cells, which indicates a block in Bid processing (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5, A and B</xref>). To detect tBid directly, mitochondria from control and tafazzin-knockdown HeLa cells were isolated before and after Fas activation. As expected, tBid was clearly detected on mitochondria of Fas-activated control cells, whereas on mitochondria of tafazzin-knockdown cells, tBid formation was markedly reduced (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5 C</xref>). Because Bid is cleaved by caspase-8 after Fas activation, it seemed likely that in tafazzin-deficient cells, Bid was not processed because of the inactivity of caspase-8. Therefore IETDase (caspase-8&#x02013;like) activity was monitored in lymphoblastoid and HeLa cells, and was indeed found to be diminished in tafazzin-deficient cells (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5, D and E</xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="fig5"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><p><bold>Caspase-8 activity is abrogated in tafazzin-deficient cells.</bold> (A) Control lymphoblastoid cells (DB037, lanes 1 and 3; DB015, lanes 2 and 4) and Barth syndrome&#x02013;derived lymphoblastoid cells (DB105.2, lanes 5 and 7; DB105.3, lanes 6 and 8) were either untreated or treated with anti-Fas antibody (Fas) for 14 h.

Upon homodimerization, procaspase-8 (p55) is first cleaved between its two active subunits, p10 and p18, to generate the p43/p10 heterodimer (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6 A</xref>). Then, cleavage of p43 between the death effector domain (DED) and the p18 subunit produces the fully active p18&#x02013;p10 form. To follow caspase-8 processing in the different cell lines, immunospecific antibodies against the autocleavage products of caspase-8 were used. As can be seen in <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6 (B and C)</xref>, caspase-8 autocleavage products are notably low in both Barth syndrome&#x02013;derived lymphoblastoid cells (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6 B</xref>, compare lanes 2 and 5) and tafazzin knockdown HeLa cells (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6 C</xref>, compare lanes 2 and 3 with 6 and 7).

To this end, control lymphoblastoid cells were treated with anti-Fas antibody in the presence of the effector-caspase inhibitor DEVD-fmk. No change in the early processing of procaspase-8 to its product p43 was observed (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6 B</xref>, top, compare lanes 2 and 3). However, DEVD-fmk significantly blocked the processing of p43 into its fully mature p18&#x02013;p10 form (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6 B</xref>, middle, compare lanes 2 and 3). Similar results were obtained in control HeLa cells (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6 C</xref>; compare lanes 2 and 3 with lane 4). Interestingly, a block in p18 but not in p43 formation was also observed in Fas-activated cells treated with the pan-caspase inhibitor zVAD-fmk (unpublished data). These results indicate that a caspase-dependent amplification loop is not required for early processing of caspase-8 to p43 and also show that the first cleaving step of caspase-8, induced by its dimerization, is not inhibited by zVAD-fmk. To bypass the use of pharmacological inhibition of caspases, MCF7 cells, which carry an inactive mutant form of caspase-3, were analyzed. MCF7 cells do not express Fas and therefore did not respond to anti-Fas antibody, but when treated with TNF-&#x003b1;, even though they were protected from cell death, formation of p43 but not of p18 was clearly observed (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6 E</xref>). In addition, similar results were obtained in HeLa cells in which mitochondria-dependent apoptosis upstream of caspase-3 activity was blocked by overexpression of Bcl-xL (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6 F</xref>). Put together, these results indicate that although caspase-3 amplification (downstream to the mitochondria) is required for full activation of caspase-8, it is not required for the early stage of caspase-8 processing. Because in CL-deficient cells the block in caspase-8 activation is seen in the initial processing of procaspase-8 into p43 (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6, B and C</xref>), the CL-dependent apoptotic step is most likely independent of caspase-3 and lies either at or upstream of the mitochondrial steps of apoptosis.</p><p>It was previously found that caspase-8 interacts with mitochondria under both physiological (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Stegh et al., 2000</xref>) and apoptotic conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Stegh et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chandra et al., 2004</xref>). Seeing that a mitochondrial lipid affected caspase-8 activity in type II apoptotic signaling, we investigated whether CL is required for caspase-8 interaction and activation on the mitochondria. Cytosolic and mitochondrial fractions of control, tafazzin-deficient lymphoblastoid and HeLa cells were isolated before and after Fas activation and analyzed for caspase-8 levels. Although after Fas-activation, mitochondria of control cells displayed cleaved caspase-8 products, including p43 and p18 (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7, A and B</xref>, lane 6), on mitochondria of CL-deficient cells, these products were significantly reduced (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7, A and B</xref>, compare lanes 6 and 8). The activity of caspase-8 on isolated mitochondria was measured using benzyloxycarbonyl-Leu-Glu-Thr-Asp (zLETD)-aminoluciferin as a substrate. LETDase activity was much higher in mitochondria isolated from Fas-activated control HeLa cells compared with the tafazzin-deficient HeLa cells (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7 C</xref>), which indicates a defect in caspase-8 processing in tafazzin-deficient mitochondria. This suggests that mitochondria are a required location for full activity of caspase-8. Importantly, the p43 and p18 mitochondria-associated products, and to a lesser extent procaspase-8 or the DED domain, were resistant to alkaline wash (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7 D</xref>). This indicates the strong insertion of the p18-exposed isoforms of caspase-8 into the mitochondrial membrane. To determine if caspase-8 completely inserts into the mitochondria, mitochondria were isolated from HeLa cells that had been transiently transfected with the partially active caspase-8 mutant C360S fused to GFP in the presence of zVAD-fmk (for more details on this mutant, see <xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8 C</xref>). The isolated mitochondria were incubated with increasing concentrations of trypsin. The data indicated that C360S-GFP and p43-C360S were sensitive to trypsin treatment (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7 E</xref>) and suggested that caspase-8 is only partially inserted into the mitochondrial outer membrane, where it mostly faces the cytosol.</p><fig position="float" id="fig7"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><p><bold>Caspase-8 translocation to the mitochondria is blocked in CL-deficient cells.</bold> (A) Control (DB015) and Barth syndrome&#x02013;derived (DB105.2) lymphoblastoid cells were either left untreated or treated with anti-Fas antibody for 24 h.

CL accumulates at the contact sites between the inner and outer mitochondrial membranes, where it facilitates tBid translocation to the mitochondria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ardail et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hovius et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Simbeni et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lutter et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Kim et al., 2004</xref>). One possibility was that the enzyme translocates to the mitochondria together with its known substrate, Bid. However, in Bid knockdown cells, caspase-8 translocation to the mitochondria after Fas activation was unaffected (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7 F</xref>). Caspase-8 interaction with the mitochondria may be mediated by other proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Stegh et al., 2002</xref>). However, as was described for tBid, it is plausible that in addition to formation of protein&#x02013;protein interactions, caspase-8 also interacts directly with the CL, where CL facilitates and strengthens the protein&#x02013;membrane association. To test this possibility, liposomes containing the lipid composition of the mitochondrial contact sites were incubated with in vitro&#x02013;translated caspase-8. Liposomes in which CL was replaced with PC and phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) were used to investigate the exclusive requirement for CL in caspase-8 binding. Analysis of the precipitated liposomes showed no significant changes in p55 pro&#x02013;caspase-8 interaction with CL-containing as compared with CL-deficient liposomes (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7 G</xref>). These results are in line with the results observed in isolated mitochondria (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7 B</xref>). However, as with mitochondria, the levels of p43 autoprocessed form were significantly reduced in CL-deficient as compared with CL-containing liposomes (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7 G</xref>). Importantly, there is a significant enrichment of the p43-processed form of caspase-8 in CL-containing liposomes as compared with the input (in vitro&#x02013;translated p55). This may be either due to the activation by proximity of pro&#x02013;caspase-8 on the liposome or because of the fact that once cleaved in the buffer, p43 has an increased affinity to the membrane. The stability of the interaction between in vitro translated caspase-8 and CL-containing liposomes was assessed after washing the precipitated liposomes in 0.1 M Na<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub>, pH 11.5, or in 1 M NaCl. A small fraction of caspase-8 was extractable, but the majority remained associated with the liposomes (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7 H</xref>). Altogether, these results suggested a stable insertion of caspase-8 into the liposomes, which are mediated by hydrophobic interactions with CL. This however, does not rule out the possibilities that electrostatic interactions with CL and/or protein&#x02013;protein interactions also facilitate caspase-8 interaction with the mitochondria.</p><p>Importantly, after Fas activation in both tafazzin-knockdown and control cells, the cytosolic procaspase-8 was fully cleaved into its early mature form (p43; <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7 B</xref>, lanes 2 and 4). This indicates that in the cytosol, the initiating process of caspase-8 cleavage (on the DISC) is unaffected in tafazzin-knockdown cells, and that the major defects in these cells lie in the steps of docking and activation of caspase-8 on the mitochondria. In type II cells, the activation of caspase-8 on the DISC is limited, hence the need for a mitochondria-mediated amplification step. To test whether loss of CL hinders only the mitochondria-dependent (but not mitochondria-independent) apoptotic steps, a caspase-8&#x02013;GFP fusion protein was transiently expressed in HeLa cells. This fusion protein can oligomerize and self-activate in the cytosol in the absence of Fas signaling, inducing a type I&#x02013;like response (unpublished data). When overexpressed in HeLa cells, caspase-8&#x02013;GFP induced cell death, which could not be blocked by Bcl-xL (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8, A and B</xref>). Because the tafazzin-knockdown cells are GFP positive (see Materials and methods for details), cell death after caspase-8&#x02013;GFP transfection was assessed in these cells by PARP cleavage, an indicator for caspase-3 activation. As can be seen in <xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8 B</xref>, overexpressing caspase-8&#x02013;GFP induced comparable cell death in both control and tafazzin knockdown cells. These results indicate that like Bcl-xL overexpression, tafazzin knockdown provides protection from the mitochondria-dependent but not from the mitochondria-independent apoptotic steps.</p><fig position="float" id="fig8"><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><p><bold>Caspase-8 C360S colocalizes with tBid on the mitochondria.</bold> (A) Parental or Bcl-xL&#x02013;overexpressing HeLa cells were transfected with either empty vector (EGFPN1) or with a plasmid encoding the caspase-8&#x02013;GFP fusion protein.

When transfected into HeLa cells, the C360S-GFP was partially processed into p43 but not into p18 (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8 C</xref>). As discussed earlier, this autoprocessing can occur even in the presence of zVAD-fmk, which in the following experiment was used to prevent cell death and further processing of the mutated enzyme by other caspases (as part of the amplification loop). To investigate whether the exogenous caspase-8 fusion protein translocates into the mitochondria in a CL-dependent manner, shContl and shTaz2 were transiently transfected with C360S&#x02013;m-Cherry (a fusion protein of monomeric red fluorescent protein and the C360S point mutant). This was done to avoid using green fluorescence in these GFP-positive cells. Under these conditions, when shCont1 cells were transfected with C360S&#x02013;m-Cherry, the vast majority of transfected cells (&#x0003e;70%) showed mitochondrial localization of the fusion protein (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8 D</xref>, top). Mitochondria were visualized in this experiment by immunostaining for TOM20. It is important to indicate that even after autoprocessing, the C-terminally tagged m-Cherry, which is fused to the cleaved p10, would colocalize with p43 on the mitochondria as a heterodimer. In contrast, when the C360S&#x02013;m-Cherry mutant was expressed in tafazzin knockdown cells, the majority of cells showed a diffused cytosolic pattern (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8 D</xref>, bottom). The BH3-only protein tBid has been shown to interact exclusively with liposomes that contain CL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Lutter et al., 2000</xref>), and electron tomogram studies showed that tBid interacts with the contact sites of mitochondrial membranes, an area rich in CL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lutter et al., 2001</xref>). Colocalization between tBid and caspase-8 would therefore suggest that caspase-8 also localizes to CL-enriched domains of the mitochondria. Control HeLa cells were cotransfected with tBid-GFP and C360S&#x02013;m-Cherry in the presence of zVAD-fmk and imaged by confocal microscopy. Colocalization was observed between tBid and caspase-8 (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8 E</xref>). These results provide further support for the observation that caspase-8 interaction with the mitochondria is CL dependent, and suggest that, like tBid, caspase-8 also localizes to CL-rich domains on the mitochondrial contact sites.</p><p>Finally, it was investigated whether caspase-8 translocation to the mitochondria is required for its activation. As mentioned before, initiator caspases are activated via induced proximity, and it seemed possible that after its insertion into the CL-enriched mitochondrial membrane, caspase-8 dimerizes and autoprocesses to become activated. Therefore, caspase-8 oligomerization on the mitochondrial membrane after Fas activation was examined. Isolated mitochondria from Fas-activated shCont1 cells were treated with the cross-linker <italic>Bis</italic>-maleimidohexane (BMH). p43 monomers were noted in control (DMSO) lanes but were absent in the BMH-treated lanes. However, higher molecular weight oligomers were present in the BMH-treated mitochondria lanes (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Fig. 9</xref>). In particular, &#x0223c;53-kD and &#x0223c;80-kD forms were observed, which indicates that upon mitochondrial translocation, caspase-8 forms a p43/p10 homo-heterodimer (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Fig. 9</xref>). This tetrameric form of caspase-8 is known to be active (though not to its full capacity) and can explain the caspase-8 activity observed on isolated mitochondria (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7 C</xref>). However, this form may be an intermediate on its way to be processed to form the p18&#x02013;p10 fully active complex. The fate of this caspase-8 form is still unclear and is under investigation. Interestingly, however, higher molecular weight forms were also observed, indicating that caspase-8 may further oligomerize on the mitochondria or that it is associated with other mitochondrial proteins. It is of note that once cleaved from p43, the DED domain (p26) on its own is no longer affected by the cross-linker and is probably released from the oligomer when caspase-8 is further processed to its fully active p18&#x02013;p10 form. To summarize: the localization, oligomerization, and cleavage of caspase-8 on the mitochondria after Fas activation, and the deficits in these processes in CL-deficient cells, strongly indicates that CL provides an activating platform for caspase-8 on the mitochondria after Fas stimulation.</p><fig position="float" id="fig9"><label>Figure 9.</label><caption><p><bold>Caspase-8 oligomerizes on the mitochondrial outer membrane.</bold> Control HeLa cells (shCont1) were either left untreated or treated with anti-Fas antibody for 14 h, and mitochondria were isolated in the presence (BMH) or absence (DMSO) of a protein cross-linker.

In this work, the role of CL was investigated using novel cell models of Barth syndrome patient-derived cells and tafazzin knockdown HeLa cells, which contain significantly reduced amounts of mature CL. These CL-deprived cells are resistant to Fas-induced apoptosis. However, their mitochondria are fully capable of undergoing the steps required for apoptosis in response to tBid, such as Bak oligomerization and mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization. This prompted investigation of the impaired apoptotic process, focusing on the pathway connecting Fas to the mitochondria, and revealing that the major block is at the level of caspase-8 activation. We propose that CL is required for the processing of caspase-8 on mitochondria, and that the interaction with CL is crucial for caspase-8 activation in type II cells.</p><p>The activation of initiator caspases requires an activating platform that enables their association with each other. Such triggering complexes include the DISC for caspase-8 and -10 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kischkel et al., 1995</xref>), the apoptosome for caspase-9 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Zou et al., 1999</xref>), the PIDDosome for caspase-2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Tinel and Tschopp, 2004</xref>), and the inflammasome for caspase 1 and 5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Martinon et al., 2002</xref>). In this work, CL was identified as a potential new mitochondria-associated triggering platform required for caspase-8 translocation, oligomerization, and activation after Fas signaling in type II cells. Our data show that once the first cleavage of procaspase-8 occurs, the p43/p10 heteromer product inserts into the mitochondrial membrane, where it further oligomerizes and may potentially undergo cleavage to form a mitochondria-associated p18&#x02013;p10 active complex. Though CL is mostly found in the mitochondrial inner membrane, several works have demonstrated an enrichment of CL in the contact sites between the inner and the outer mitochondrial membranes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ardail et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hovius et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Simbeni et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lutter et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Kim et al., 2004</xref>). At the contact sites, CL mediates the binding of tBid to the mitochondrial outer membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lutter et al., 2001</xref>). Therefore, it is likely that caspase-8 binding to the mitochondria is regulated in a similar way. It remains to be determined whether other proteins, such as BAR and FLASH, which were shown to mediate caspase-8 translocation to the mitochondria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Zhang et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Milovic-Holm et al., 2007</xref>), play an auxiliary role in these processes.</p><p>In this paper, the role of CL in apoptosis was studied in cells after Fas activation. However, caspase-8 also operates in response to other death signals. Caspase-8 prevents metastasis formation from primary tumors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Stupack et al., 2006</xref>). It will be interesting to learn whether mitochondria in general and CL in particular are required for activating caspase-8 under these conditions, and whether CL levels are altered during advanced tumor development. A decrease in tafazzin expression levels has been reported in B cell lymphoma and breast carcinoma, which suggests that tafazzin loss may contribute to tumor progression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Wilson et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kobayashi et al., 2003</xref>). To date, Barth syndrome has not been associated with apoptotic defects or cancers. However, most cells in vivo are type I, and the mitochondrial amplification steps are only required in cells in which the DISC has been compromised, as is the case in many epithelial cancer cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Shell et al., 2007</xref>). In addition, the early mortality age of Barth syndrome patients may explain the absence of increased cancer incidents. Importantly, however, Barth syndrome is often characterized by a developmental defect of noncompaction of the left ventricular myocardium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bleyl et al., 1997</xref>), and a similar defect was observed in mice deficient in caspase-8 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Varfolomeev et al., 1998</xref>). Therefore, it is possible that the developmental abnormalities associated with Barth syndrome are due, at least partially, to inactivation of caspase-8. The role of mitochondria-associated caspase-8 in several in vivo processes should be further investigated.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Plasmids and expression vectors</title><p>To generate the pEGFP/Taz expression vector, human <italic>tafazzin</italic> cDNA was amplified by PCR and inserted, in-frame, into the HindIII and SalI sites of pEGFPN1.
