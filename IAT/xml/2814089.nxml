In the present study, we investigated the expression and roles of ILK in human intestinal epithelial cells (IECs) in vivo and in vitro. Herein, we report that ILK and its scaffold-function interacting partners, PINCH-1, &#x003b1;-parvin, and &#x003b2;-parvin, are expressed according to a decreasing gradient from the bottom of the crypt (proliferative/undifferentiated) compartment to the tip of the villus (non-proliferative/differentiated) compartment, closely following the expression pattern of the ECM/basement membrane component fibronectin. The siRNA knockdown of ILK in human IECs caused a loss of PINCH-1, &#x003b1;-parvin, and &#x003b2;-parvin expression, along with a significant decrease in cell proliferation via a loss of cyclin D1 and an increase in p27 and hypophosphorylated pRb expression levels. ILK knockdown severely affected cell spreading, migration, and restitution abilities, which were shown to be directly related to a decrease in fibronectin deposition. All ILK knockdown-induced defects were rescued with exogenously deposited fibronectin. Altogether, our results indicate that ILK performs crucial roles in the control of human intestinal cell and crypt&#x02013;villus axis homeostasis&#x02014;especially with regard to basement membrane fibronectin deposition&#x02014;as well as cell proliferation, spreading, and migration.

Physiol. 222: 387&#x02013;400, 2010. &#x000a9; 2009 Wiley-Liss, Inc.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><p>The integrin-linked kinase (ILK) is typically located in integrin-mediated adhesion complexes formed within the context of extracellular matrix (ECM)&#x02013;cell interactions (Vouret-Craviari et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b62">2004</xref>; McDonald et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">2008</xref>). Although its Ser/Thr kinase activity is engaged upon integrin binding, ILK also functions as a scaffolding protein which mediates linkage of integrins to the actin cytoskeleton (Sepulveda and Wu, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b52">2006</xref>; McDonald et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">2008</xref>). To this effect, ILK not only directly associates with the &#x003b2;1 integrin subunit but recruits the scaffold-interacting partners PINCH (-1 or -2), as well as one member of the parvin family (&#x003b1;-, &#x003b2;-, or &#x003b3;-parvin) in order to constitute a PINCH&#x02013;ILK&#x02013;parvin (PIP) complex (Legate et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">2006</xref>; Sepulveda and Wu, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b52">2006</xref>; McDonald et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">2008</xref>). In addition to creating a physical link between integrins and the actin cytoskeleton, distinct PIP complexes can recruit additional cytoskeletal scaffolding and signaling molecules, such as Nck2, paxillin, &#x003b1;-PIX, and &#x003b1;-actinin (Legate et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">2006</xref>; Sepulveda and Wu, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b52">2006</xref>; McDonald et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">2008</xref>). Interactions of PIP complexes with specific additional partners either directly or indirectly activate key elements of various signaling pathways such as Akt and members of the Rho GTPase family, thus implicating ILK in various cell adhesion-mediated processes such as spreading, migration, survival, and proliferation (Legate et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">2006</xref>; Sepulveda and Wu, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b52">2006</xref>; McDonald et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">2008</xref>).</p><p>The human intestinal epithelium is an elegant biological model for the study of the coordinated cell processes involved in tissue homeostasis. Its rapid, continuous renewal consists of spatially separated proliferative/undifferentiated and non-proliferative/differentiated epithelial cell populations located, respectively, in the crypts and the villi (Pageot et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b44">2000</xref>; Crosnier et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">2006</xref>). The dynamic renewal of the intestinal epithelium is essentially characterized by intestinal epithelial cell (IEC) production and maturation in the crypts, migration out of the crypts onto the base of the villi and, thereafter, further migration of differentiated cells to the tip of the villi where they are shed by ano&#x000ef;kis (Crosnier et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">2006</xref>). In humans, functionality of the crypt&#x02013;villus axis is already fully established by mid-gestation (18&#x02013;20 weeks) (Teller and Beaulieu, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b56">2001</xref>; Crosnier et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">2006</xref>). As with all epithelia, the intestinal epithelium interacts with a basement membrane (BM). The intestinal BM directs several cell processes that are critical to the homeostasis of the intestinal epithelium, such as proliferation, migration, differentiation, and survival (Beaulieu, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">1997</xref>; Simon-Assmann et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b54">1998</xref>; Teller and Beaulieu, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b56">2001</xref>). Some ECM components, such as type IV collagen and the laminins, are exclusive to BMs (Laurie et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">1982</xref>; Simon-Assmann et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b53">1986</xref>; Beaulieu and Vachon, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">1994</xref>; Beaulieu, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">1997</xref>). In the intestine, these molecules are differentially expressed along the crypt&#x02013;villus axis and are consequently believed to perform distinct roles in IEC processes (Simon-Assmann et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b53">1986</xref>; Beaulieu, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">1997</xref>). Another major component of ECMs and BMs is fibronectin, a key player in the establishment and maintenance of tissue morphology and in wound healing (Simon-Assmann et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b53">1986</xref>; Ruoslahti, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b51">1988</xref>; Mao and Schwarzbauer, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">2005</xref>; Zhang et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b68">2006</xref>). In the human intestine, fibronectin is strongly expressed in the BM underlying the crypt compartment, decreasing gradually towards the tip of the villus (Quaroni et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b49">1978</xref>; Simon-Assmann et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b53">1986</xref>; Beaulieu et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">1991</xref>). Fibronectin is produced, secreted, and deposited by intestinal cells of both epithelial and mesenchymal origins (Quaroni et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b49">1978</xref>; Laurie et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">1982</xref>; Vachon et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b61">1995</xref>) and has been shown to contribute to many cell functions in cells of different origins (Ruoslahti, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b51">1988</xref>; Mao and Schwarzbauer, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">2005</xref>). The successful deposition of fibronectin into the BM relies upon its recognition by specific integrin receptors, which mediate its unfolding in a process known as fibrillogenesis (Mao and Schwarzbauer, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">2005</xref>). This process exposes specific structural domains within fibronectin which then mediate the formation of the insoluble fibronectin fibrils required for their deposition (Mao and Schwarzbauer, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">2005</xref>). Incidentally, fibronectin deposition is characterized by the formation of specialized ECM&#x02013;cell contact structures called fibrillar adhesion points, which are generated through an organized interplay between integrins, cytosolic proteins, and actin cytoskeleton (Mao and Schwarzbauer, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">2005</xref>). While some reports have implicated ILK in the deposition of fibronectin (Wu et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b65">1998</xref>; Guo and Wu, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">2002</xref>; Vouret-Craviari et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b62">2004</xref>; Assi et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2008</xref>), and although ILK and PIP complexes are found within fibrillar adhesion points (Guo et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">2001</xref>; Vouret-Craviari et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b62">2004</xref>), the question remains open as to their roles in fibronectin BM deposition in the human intestine. Similarly, the specific role of ILK in adhesion-mediated cell processes remains to be fully understood in human IECs.</p><p>In the present study, we investigated the expression and roles of ILK in human IECs in vivo and in vitro. Herein, we report that the crypt&#x02013;villus axis expression patterns of ILK, PINCH-1, &#x003b1;-parvin, and &#x003b2;-parvin all follow the BM distribution of fibronectin, that is, being largely predominant in proliferative/undifferentiated crypt IECs. Using an siRNA approach to knockdown ILK, we demonstrated a role for ILK in the maintenance of PIP complexes, as well as in the deposition of fibronectin by IECs, subsequently directly affecting their spreading, migration, and cell-cycle progression. The introduction of an exogenous fibronectin matrix rescued the ILK knockdown phenotype, further emphasizing the importance of ILK in the organization of the intestinal crypt&#x02013;villus BM, as well as providing a functional basis for its significant roles in human IEC cell processes.</p><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec><title>Materials</title><p>Mouse primary antibodies used were directed against: ILK (Western blot (WB): 1/1,000) (clone 3/ILK, BD Transduction Laboratories, Franklin Lakes, NJ), PINCH (WB: 1/1,000, immunofluorescence (IF): 1/50, co-immunoprecipitation (Co-IP): 2&#x02009;&#x000b5;g/100&#x02009;mm dish) (clone 49/PINCH, BD Transduction Laboratories), &#x003b2;-actin (WB: 1/75,000) (clone C4, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA), FAK (WB: 1/1,000) (clone 77, BD Transduction Laboratories), fibronectin (WB: 1/500, IF: 1/50) (HFN 7.1, Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank, Iowa City, IA), vinculin (IF: 1/500) (clone 7F9, Chemicon International, Temecula, CA), pRB (WB: 1/1,000) (clone G3-245, BD Pharmingen, San Diego, CA), V5 tag (IF: 1/500) (Invitrogen, Eugene, OR), &#x003b1;-parvin (WB: 1/10, IF: 1/2; 3B5; generous gift from C.

The HIEC line Caco-2/15, a stable clone of the parental Caco-2 cell line (ATCC, Manassas, VA), has been fully characterized in previous studies (Beaulieu and Quaroni, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">1991</xref>; Pageot et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b44">2000</xref>). Caco-2/15 cells undergo a full enterocytic differentiation process that takes place spontaneously upon reaching confluence (0 days post-confluence; PC) and which is gradually completed by 25&#x02013;30 days PC. Differentiated Caco-2/15 cells exhibit all the morphological and functional characteristics of mature enterocytes including their transcriptome (Pageot et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b44">2000</xref>; Tremblay et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b58">2006</xref>).

In the functional ileum, ILK was found to be localized at the basal plasma membrane of the intestinal epithelium along the entire length of the crypt&#x02013;villus axis, but in a clear expression gradient with stronger ILK staining in the crypt compartment than in the villus (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">1</xref>A). Components of the PIP complex, namely PINCH-1 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">1</xref>B), &#x003b1;-parvin (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">1</xref>C), and &#x003b2;-parvin (data not shown) were also found to be expressed in association with the basal plasma membrane of the intestinal epithelium, and all displayed highly similar patterns of decreasing expression along the crypt&#x02013;villus axis as observed for ILK. The antibody used to detect PINCH recognizes both PINCH-1 and PINCH-2; however, it has been shown elsewhere that PINCH-2 is not expressed in the intestinal epithelium and mesenchymal cells (Braun et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">2003</xref>). Epithelial localization for ILK was confirmed by co-detection of ILK with a BM component, the laminin &#x003b2;1&#x003b3;1-chain, allowing for a clear discrimination between the epithelial and underlying mesenchymal populations of the crypt&#x02013;villus axis (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">1</xref>E&#x02013;E&#x02033;).

Transient transfection of increasing concentrations (10, 25, and 100&#x02009;&#x000b5;M) of an siRNA targeted against the human ILK mRNA (siILK) in HIEC cells resulted in a significant decrease in ILK protein expression (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig04">4</xref>A), in sharp contrast with a control siRNA (siCNS) and a transfection control (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig04">4</xref>A). ILK knockdown did not alter the expression levels of focal adhesion kinase, FAK (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig04">4</xref>A), nor did it activate the OAS interferon response gene (data not shown) suggesting that the ILK knockdown was efficient and specific. Further time-course experiments showed that the siRNA knockdown of ILK was maintained over a period of at least 8 days post-transfection in both HIEC and Caco-2/15 cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig04">4</xref>B). Since it has been proposed that PINCH and parvins form obligate complexes with ILK in order to avoid proteasome degradation (Fukuda et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">2003a</xref>), we evaluated the impact of ILK knockdown on the expression of these components in HIEC and Caco-2/15 cells. In siILK cells a drastic loss of PINCH-1, &#x003b1;-parvin, and &#x003b2;-parvin expression resulted from the knockdown of ILK (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig04">4</xref>C). Furthermore, as observed during the Caco-2/15 differentiation process (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02">2</xref>A), &#x003b2;-parvin(s) is the only &#x003b2;-parvin isoform negatively affected by the reduction of ILK levels (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig04">4</xref>C), suggesting that contrary to &#x003b2;-parvin(l), &#x003b2;-parvin(s) most likely depends on P1IP complex formation to maintain its presence in differentiating IECs. Therefore, these data indicate that the specific knockdown of ILK in human IECs led to a severe disruption of the P1IP complex in these cells. <fig id="fig04" position="float"><label>Fig. 4</label><caption><p>siRNA inhibition of ILK expression in IEC cells.

This prompted us to investigate whether the knockdown of ILK impacted on the actual deposition of fibronectin in human IECs. We monitored the capacity of siILK versus siCNS HIEC cells to form an insoluble fibronectin matrix with the available soluble fibronectin in culture media by isolating deposited ECM fractions from these cultures.

Taken together, these results demonstrate that the knockdown of ILK in human IECs impacted negatively on both the synthesis and the deposition of fibronectin.</p><p>Since fibronectin deposition is affected by ILK knockdown in IECs we verified whether the expression levels of the fibronectin integrin receptors &#x003b1;5&#x003b2;1 and &#x003b1;V-containing integrins were affected. WB analyses of the &#x003b1;5 and &#x003b1;V subunit protein levels in HIEC cells showed equal amounts of the &#x003b1;5 and &#x003b1;V integrin subunits between siILK- and siCNS-treated cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig05">5</xref>E). This result indicates that ILK knockdown did not affect integrin fibronectin receptor expression.</p></sec><sec><title>ILK knockdown decreases spreading, migration, and restitution of human IECs</title><p>Considering that P1IP complex components are associated with focal adhesion points in our cell model, and that the knockdown of ILK resulted not only in a decrease of fibronectin ECM deposition but also in a severe disruption of the P1IP complex, we determined whether ILK knockdown likewise affected the spreading ability and migration capacity of human crypt IECs. siILK- and siCNS-treated HIEC cells were seeded onto glass coverslips and the formation of focal adhesion points by in situ indirect IF staining for vinculin was followed over time. At 4&#x02009;h post-seeding, both siILK and siCNS cells showed similar rates of adhesion although siILK cells appeared to be less spread than control cells, as visualized by the peripheral localization of vinculin (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig06">6</xref>A). After 18&#x02009;h, siCNS cells were found to have spread considerably, as evidenced by the extensive display of elongated punctuate patterns of vinculin localization (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig06">6</xref>A) typical of mature focal adhesion points (Geiger et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">2001</xref>). In sharp contrast, siILK cells remained rounded and largely displayed the peripheral dot-like vinculin localization pattern (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig06">6</xref>A) typical of the immature focal adhesion points called focal complexes (Geiger et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">2001</xref>). Hence, these results showed that ILK was not essential for the initial attachment of human crypt IECs but was nonetheless crucial for their subsequent spreading and formation of mature focal adhesion points. <fig id="fig06" position="float"><label>Fig. 6</label><caption><p>Knockdown of ILK expression inhibits HIEC cell spreading and migration and Caco-2/15 monolayer restitution.

These data indicate that ILK performs a key role in human crypt IEC migration.</p><p>A second type of migration found in the polarized intestinal epithelium is restitution, which consists of the resealing of superficial wounds by epithelial sheet movement. The restitution process is a complex phenomenon which does not involve proliferation but requires that the differentiated epithelial cells flatten, spread, and migrate in order to close the wound (Mammen and Matthews, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">2003</xref>). Since restitution has already been shown to be, at least in part, modulated by the ECM (Zhang et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b68">2006</xref>) we examined the effect of ILK depletion on Caco-2/15 restitution ability. Results showed that wound closure in newly formed siILK-treated Caco-2/15 cell monolayers was significantly less (62.7&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;3.0% of the original wound area size) than closure of the wound area in siCNS-treated Caco-2/15 control cells (74.5&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;3.4%) over the same time period (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig06">6</xref>C). These data point to a role for ILK in the human villus IEC restitution mechanism.</p></sec><sec><title>ILK knockdown leads to decreased proliferation of human IECs</title><p>Since both ILK and fibronectin have independently been reported to be involved in the control of cell proliferation (Danen and Yamada, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">2001</xref>; McDonald et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">2008</xref>), we tested whether knockdown of ILK could also negatively impact human IEC proliferation. To this effect, cell proliferation assays (BrdU incorporation) of siILK and siCNS cells cultured on plastic dishes were performed. As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig07">7</xref>A, the proliferation index of ILK knockdown HIEC and Caco-2/15 cells was found to be significantly reduced compared to controls. Parallel WB analyses were performed on the normal HIEC cells in order to confirm that this decrease in proliferation was consequent to a deregulation of cell-cycle progression regulatory elements. Indeed, siILK-treated HIEC cells showed sharp increases in the levels of hypophosphorylated pRb and of the cell-cycle inhibitor p27, accompanied by the loss of cyclin D1 levels (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig07">7</xref>B). Levels of expression of the cell-cycle inhibitor p21 remained constant. Therefore, these results indicate that ILK performs crucial functions in the modulation of key regulatory elements of cell-cycle progression of human crypt IECs, thus constituting a molecular basis for ILK's role in stimulating the proliferation of these cells. <fig id="fig07" position="float"><label>Fig. 7</label><caption><p>Knockdown of ILK expression inhibits HIEC cell proliferation.

Knockdown of ILK in Caco-2/15 cells significantly reduced the proliferation index in cells grown on plastic (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig07">7</xref>A) whereas it was restored when these cells were plated on fibronectin (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig07">7</xref>A).

We first performed cell aggregate assays with HIEC cells, which allow for the simultaneous analysis of cell spreading and migration capabilities (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig08">8</xref>A). We also carried out restitution assays with and without fibronectin on Caco-2/15 cell monolayers (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig08">8</xref>B). When on plastic alone, siILK-treated cells exhibited significantly lower spreading/migration and restitution capacities than control siCNS-treated cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig08">8</xref>A,B), as expected from our previous results above. The presence of exogenous fibronectin successfully reversed the spreading/migration and restitution reductions observed in siILK cells. Exogenous fibronectin had no net effect on control siCNS cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig08">8</xref>A,B). In order to confirm that the previous exogenous fibronectin functional rescue of siILK-treated HIEC does not result from a possible salvage of some P1IP members, we next investigated the individual levels each P1IP member in these cells. WB analyses showed no significant rescue of PINCH-1 nor &#x003b1;-parvin in ILK knocked down HIEC by fibronectin (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig08">8</xref>C).

Herein, we report that the expression patterns of ILK, PINCH-1, &#x003b1;-parvin, and &#x003b2;-parvin along the crypt&#x02013;villus axis decreased as a function of enterocytic differentiation and followed the BM distribution of fibronectin, that is, being largely predominant in human proliferative/undifferentiated crypt IECs. In these cells, ILK, PINCH-1, &#x003b1;-parvin, and &#x003b2;-parvin were closely associated with focal adhesion points. The siRNA knockdown of ILK in human IECs caused a severe disruption of P1IP complexes along with a significant decrease in cell proliferation (decrease of cyclin D1, increase in p27 and hypophosphorylated pRb), as well as spreading (persistence of immature focal adhesion points) migration and restitution capabilities. The ILK knockdown-induced defects in spreading, migration, restitution, and proliferation were directly related to a concomitant decrease in fibronectin synthesis and ECM deposition and were reversed with exogenously deposited fibronectin. Hence, ILK performs these key roles in human IECs, most likely as part of a P1IP complex.</p><p>A primary function of ILK is to mediate the formation of PIP complexes in a variety of tissues, where the exact PINCH/parvin composition, and consequently their specific roles in cell processes, may be cell and tissue context-dependent (Legate et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">2006</xref>; Sepulveda and Wu, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b52">2006</xref>; McDonald et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">2008</xref>). Our findings not only further support the concept of an absolute requirement of the scaffolding function of ILK for the formation and maintenance of active PIP complexes at focal adhesion points but additionally reveal that the levels of the PIP complex may change depending on the state of differentiation within the same given cell type. Indeed, our results showed that proliferative/undifferentiated crypt IECs express high levels of P1IP complex components whereas non-proliferative/differentiated villus IECs express low levels. Our results also suggest that &#x003b1;-parvin and &#x003b2;-parvin(s) have exclusive roles in the context of the PIP complexes in IECs since &#x003b1;-parvin and &#x003b2;-parvin(s), but not &#x003b2;-parvin(l), follow the decline in PINCH-1 and ILK protein levels in differentiating Caco-2/15, as well as in siILK-treated HIEC and Caco-2/15 cells. Consequently, further investigation will be required to fully comprehend the precise roles of the distinct PIP complexes in human IECs.</p><p>A key finding in the present study was the demonstration of a direct relationship in human small intestinal cells between the functional expression of ILK and the capacity for fibronectin synthesis and functional matrix deposition. The overexpression of ILK has previously been shown to increase fibronectin ECM deposition in rat IECs (Wu et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b65">1998</xref>) and the intestine-specific knockout of ILK in mice, as well as the siRNA knockdown of ILK in SW480 colon cancer cells, were recently shown to result in the decrease of fibronectin mRNA and protein expression levels (Assi et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2008</xref>). Hence, our findings not only corroborate the observations from these previous studies, but furthermore show, for the first time, an implication of the P1IP complex&#x02014;and not just ILK&#x02014;in the process of fibronectin synthesis and functional BM deposition in human IECs. Interestingly, expression levels of P1IP members show a decreasing gradient in differentiating Caco-2/15 cells which correlates with the decreasing gradient of fibronectin expression in these cells previously reported by ourselves (Vachon et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b61">1995</xref>), as well as with our observations in the small intestinal epithelium and BM shown herein. The fibronectin gene promoter contains several response elements (Alonso et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1996</xref>; Gradl et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">1999</xref>) that have been shown in other cell systems to be potentially regulated by ILK-mediated signaling (Legate et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">2006</xref>; McDonald et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">2008</xref>), thus providing a molecular basis for the relationship between the loss of ILK (and the P1IP complex) and the consequent reduction in fibronectin mRNA transcription. However, this alone cannot account for the observed reduction in fibronectin deposition, since knockdown of ILK did not affect the net amount of fibronectin found in the culture medium. Such apparently contrasting observations are likely the result of the different soluble fibronectin deposition abilities between control and ILK-treated cells. A previous study in rat IECs reported that overexpression of ILK prompted the co-localization of the fibronectin integrin receptor, &#x003b1;5&#x003b2;1, with the focal adhesion point component vinculin (Wu et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b65">1998</xref>). This observation is consistent with the established requirement of fibronectin integrin receptors for fibrillogenesis and ECM deposition (Mao and Schwarzbauer, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">2005</xref>). Our findings show that the expression levels of fibronectin receptors are unaffected by the loss of ILK, suggesting that these receptors remain physically available for binding. However, this does not exclude that a scaffolding, and/or a signaling, defect constitutes the driving cause for the observed decrease in fibronectin deposition. Indeed, there is a requirement for actin cytoskeletal tension, generated at focal adhesion points by stress fibers, in enabling fibrillogenesis (Baneyx et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">2002</xref>; Yoneda et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b66">2007</xref>). Our finding that the knockdown of ILK results in IECs forming immature focal adhesion points suggests that the loss of ILK (and consequently the P1IP complex) greatly reduces the actin cytoskeletal tension so necessary for fibrillogenesis&#x02014;and consequently impacts negatively on the deposition of fibronectin. Alternatively, various signaling molecules such as PI3-K, Src, and MEK/Erk have also been shown to regulate the deposition of fibronectin in various cell types (Hughes et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">1997</xref>; Brenner et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">2000</xref>; Wierzbicka-Patynowski and Schwarzbauer, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b63">2002</xref>). Since these can be regulated by ILK and PIP complexes (Delcommenne et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">1998</xref>; Fukuda et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">2003b</xref>; Kim et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">2008</xref>), their deregulation may also in part explain the reduction of fibronectin deposition that is consequent to a knockdown of ILK. Further studies will be required to gain a better understanding of the molecular basis of the functions of PIP complexes in fibronectin synthesis and ECM deposition, as well as to firmly establish whether the kinase activity of ILK, its scaffolding function, or both, are required in this process. In this respect, a previous study in rat IECs reported the requirement for the integrity of the ILK kinase domain in the up-regulation of fibronectin deposition, following overexpression of ILK (Wu et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b65">1998</xref>).</p><p>Another key finding in the present study is the demonstration of a direct relationship in human crypt IECs between the functional expression of ILK and the capacity for fibronectin matrix deposition, which then regulates spreading, migration, and cell-cycle progression. Fibronectin is well recognized as a key component in the regulation of various cell processes (Wierzbicka-Patynowski and Schwarzbauer, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b64">2003</xref>). Its predominant deposition in the BM underlying the crypts correlates with the presence of actively proliferating and migrating IECs in this intestinal epithelial compartment (Pageot et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b44">2000</xref>). These findings, together with our observation that the differentiation process of siILK-treated Caco-2/15 cells is in no way altered, support previous reports that fibronectin does not affect enterocytic differentiation (Kedinger et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">1987</xref>; Hahn, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">1988</xref>; Hahn et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">1990</xref>), but rather stimulates IEC spreading, migration, and proliferation (Goke et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">1996</xref>; Kuwada and Li, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">2000</xref>; Hagerman et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">2006</xref>; Zhang et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b68">2006</xref>; Assi et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2008</xref>). It is therefore not surprising that the ILK knockdown-induced deficiency of fibronectin deposition in human crypt IECs was concomitantly accompanied by deficiencies in their spreading, migratory, and proliferative capacities (this study). Furthermore, our results also support a role for a fibronectin/ILK-dependent mechanism in the restitution ability of villus IECs. As we reported herein and elsewhere, mature (non-proliferating/differentiated) villus IECs express low levels of P1IP complex members (this work), as well as low levels of fibronectin (this work) (Vachon and Beaulieu, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b59">1992</xref>) compared to their proliferative/undifferentiated crypt counterparts. However, differentiated enterocytes need to dedifferentiate in order to initiate and complete the restitution process (Basson, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">2001</xref>). Considering that fibronectin has already been shown to promote intestinal restitution (Zhang et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b68">2006</xref>), it can therefore be expected that dedifferentiated cells present at the wound borders may &#x0201c;re-express&#x0201d; increased levels of P1IP complexes and fibronectin during the restitution process. These data, coupled with our additional observation that exogenously deposited fibronectin rescued the ILK knockdown phenotype, clearly demonstrated a critical regulatory role for ILK and fibronectin in the maintenance of human intestinal crypt&#x02013;villus axis homeostasis.</p><p>Although ILK and PIP complexes have been implicated in various cell processes such as spreading and migration (Sepulveda and Wu, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b52">2006</xref>; McDonald et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">2008</xref>), their roles in these processes in IECs have remained poorly understood. We have shown that the loss of ILK (and the P1IP complex) in human crypt IECs not only resulted in defects in the formation/assembly of mature focal adhesion points but also led to significant defects in spreading and migration. However, other focal adhesion components, such as FAK and vinculin, which have been previously shown to be sufficient for spreading and migration (Panetti, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b45">2002</xref>; Ziegler et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b69">2006</xref>), remained unaffected by the knockdown of ILK. This would explain why exogenously deposited fibronectin fully rescued the ILK knockdown phenotype with regard to spreading and migration. In turn, this would also explain why the loss of ILK and of the P1IP complex significantly reduced spreading and migration in human crypt IECs, without managing to fully abrogate these processes. Indeed, while fibronectin is a principal activator of IEC spreading and migration, it is not the only intestinal BM component to exhibit this ability (Goke et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">1996</xref>; Beaulieu, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">1997</xref>; Teller and Beaulieu, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b56">2001</xref>). In any event, much remains to be understood of the molecular contributions of ILK and P1IP complexes in their fibronectin-dependent regulation of spreading and migration in human crypt IECs.</p><p>Although proliferation is adhesion dependent in normal cells (Moschos et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">2007</xref>), various elements of this process are distinct to those which mediate spreading and migration (Lock et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">2008</xref>). While ILK and PIP complexes have been implicated in the regulation of cell proliferation (Sepulveda and Wu, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b52">2006</xref>; McDonald et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">2008</xref>), their roles in this process in IECs remain to be understood. For instance, whereas a role for ILK in intestinal tumorigenesis is becoming increasingly established (Bravou et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">2006</xref>; Assi et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2008</xref>), it has only recently been reported in mice that ILK is implicated in the stimulation of normal IEC proliferation and in the maintenance of crypt size (Assi et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2008</xref>). In the present study, we have shown that ILK and the P1IP complex are predominantly expressed by human crypt IECs in vivo and in vitro and follow the BM deposition pattern of fibronectin along the crypt&#x02013;villus axis. To this effect, exogenously deposited fibronectin fully restored proliferation in ILK knockdown human crypt IECs. In addition to &#x003b1;5&#x003b2;1, proliferative/undifferentiated (crypt) IECs may also use the integrins &#x003b1;V&#x003b2;3 and/or &#x003b1;V&#x003b2;5 as fibronectin receptors (Zhang et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b67">2003</xref>). The integrin receptor &#x003b1;5&#x003b2;1 engages and activates ILK-mediated signaling upon binding fibronectin (Gopalakrishna et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">2000</xref>; Vouret-Craviari et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b62">2004</xref>; Camacho-Leal et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">2007</xref>). Furthermore, fibronectin has been previously reported to stimulate ILK activity in rat IECs (Delcommenne et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">1998</xref>), whereas the overexpression of ILK in these same cells increased the expression of cyclin D1 (Radeva et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b50">1997</xref>). Previous work has reported that ILK (and PIP complexes) can contribute to the activation of signaling pathways that are implicated in the regulation of cell proliferation, such as Src, Akt, GSK-3, and MEK/Erk (Legate et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">2006</xref>; Naska et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">2006</xref>; Kim et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">2008</xref>). The loss of ILK (and of the P1IP complex) in human IECs resulted in a gross deregulation of key regulatory elements of cell-cycle progression (namely pRb, p27, and cyclin D1). Taken together these observations not only strongly support a major role for ILK (and the P1IP complex) in the fibronectin-mediated driving of human crypt IEC proliferation but also begin to provide a molecular basis for such a role. However, those same proliferation-regulating pathways that are susceptible to being activated by ILK and PIP complexes following binding to fibronectin can likewise be engaged by the signaling of various other ECM/BM components and their receptors, as well as by growth factor receptors. It is therefore possible that ILK-deficient IECs are unable to unfold and organize exogenous fibronectin into a fibril matrix, and as a result affect the organization of the ECM/BM itself (Sottile and Hocking, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b55">2002</xref>). Consequently, this may explain why exogenously deposited fibronectin fully restored proliferation in ILK knockdown human crypt IECs, yet at the same time failed to further enhance proliferation in these same cells, to levels observed in ILK-expressing/control cells. In turn, this would also explain why the loss of ILK and of the P1IP complex significantly reduced proliferation in human crypt IECs but did not manage to fully abrogate the process. Therefore, additional studies will be required in order to further identify the signaling basis which underlies the role of ILK in the regulation of cell-cycle progression in human crypt IECs.</p><p>In conclusion, this study has provided evidence that ILK, and by extension the P1IP complex, performs crucial functions in the control of critical adhesion-mediated cell processes that are required for human intestinal crypt and villus cell homeostasis&#x02014;namely fibronectin synthesis and BM deposition, as well as cell spreading, migration, restitution, and proliferation. In addition to the present findings, further investigation of these fibronectin-driven, ILK-mediated IEC processes should provide greater knowledge of the complexities involved in the maintenance, renewal, and healing of the human intestinal epithelium&#x02014;both under normal physiological conditions and within the context of physiopathologies such as inflammatory bowel disease and cancer.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>We would like to thank Dr. S.
