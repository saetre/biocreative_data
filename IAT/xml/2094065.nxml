The latter factor contains four RNA recognition motifs followed by a C-terminal region composed of a linker and a PABC domain. We show here that yeast mutants lacking the C-terminal domains of Pab1 display specific synthetic interactions with mutants in the 5&#x02032;-3&#x02032; mRNA decay pathway. Moreover, these mutations impair mRNA decay <italic>in vivo</italic> without significantly affecting mRNA export or translation. Inhibition of mRNA decay occurs through slowed deadenylation. <italic>In vitro</italic> analyses demonstrate that removal of the Pab1 linker domain directly interferes with the ability of the Pop2&#x02013;Ccr4 complex to deadenylate the Pab1-bound poly(A). Binding assays demonstrate that this results from a modulation of poly(A) packaging by the Pab1 linker region. Overall, our results demonstrate a direct involvement of Pab1 in mRNA decay and reveal the modular nature of this factor, with different domains affecting various cellular processes. These data suggest new models involving the modulation of poly(A) packaging by Pab1 to control mRNA decay.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Nuclearly encoded mRNAs of eukaryotes contain two constant distinctive features: a cap at their 5&#x02032; end and a poly(A) sequence at their 3&#x02032; end (except for histone mRNAs that are not polyadenylated in some species). These characteristic modifications provide cells with specific marks demonstrating the integrity of the corresponding mRNAs. Both the 5&#x02032; cap and poly(A) tails have been implicated in several processes including mRNA processing, mRNA nuclear export, translation and mRNA stability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1 B2 B3">1&#x02013;3</xref>). Through these actions, the mRNA cap and poly(A) tail enhance strongly gene expression and contribute to its regulation. This situation contrasts significantly with the one observed in prokaryotes where RNA polyadenylation has been shown to activate mRNA turnover (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>). Interestingly, a similar mechanism targeting aberrant transcripts or processing intermediates towards decay through the addition of a poly(A) tail, has recently also been observed in the nucleus of eukaryotes, thereby expanding the function of eukaryotic polyadenylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5 B6 B7 B8">5&#x02013;8</xref>). Eukaryotic mRNA caps and poly(A) tails protect the flanking mRNA body from exonuclease attacks. This is particularly true for the 5&#x02032; cap, which can only be removed by a dedicated decapping enzyme (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>). However, these modifications mediate their effects mostly through interactions with specific binding factors. Henceforth, nuclear and cytoplasmic cap binding factors have been identified and shown to participate in RNA processing and transport and to play a key role in translation initiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>). Similarly, nuclear and cytoplasmic poly(A)-binding proteins (PABPs) have been described. The abundant cytoplasmic PABP was shown to contribute to translation and mRNA stability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>). It is thus not surprising that genetic deletion of the gene encoding the yeast PABP, <italic>PAB1</italic>, leads to cell death. Sequence analysis demonstrated that Pab1 and its homologues are composed of four RNA recognition motifs (RRM), followed by a linker region (L) and a C-terminal PABC domain (C) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>). Interestingly, the essential portion of Pab1 resides in the RRM region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>). Structural analyses have demonstrated that the RRM domains directly and specifically contact the associated RNA molecule (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>). The RRM region also interacts with the eIF4G translation initiation factor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>). Thus, its essential nature may be explained by a role in translation initiation. The structures of the C-terminal yeast and human PABC domains have also been determined (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>). This domain participates in protein&#x02013;protein interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>) including the association with the translation termination factor eRF3 in yeast as well as ataxin-2 and some PABP-interacting proteins (PAIP) in higher eukaryotes. The eRF3-PABP interaction was proposed to be involved in translation termination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>), but no biological evidence supporting this model has been reported.</p><p>Pab1 has also been implicated in the control of mRNA stability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>). RNA degradation contributes to the fine-tuning of cellular transcript levels as well as to the elimination of accidentally damaged or aberrant mRNAs that could impact on the cell function. These degradation processes are mediated by a variety of enzymes and mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>). Two conserved pathways have been implicated in the degradation of functional mRNAs. Both pathways are initiated by the removal of the mRNA poly(A) tail and this deadenylation step is most often rate limiting for the decay process. Deadenylated mRNA bodies get degraded either in the 5&#x02032;-3&#x02032; direction by the Xrn1 exonuclease after removal of the 5&#x02032; cap by the Dcp1&#x02013;Dcp2 decapping complex or in the 3&#x02032;-5&#x02032; direction by a multi-subunit exonuclease complex named exosome. These various exonucleases and decapping enzymes are also involved in the degradation of faulty mRNAs containing a premature stop codon, lacking a stop codon or inducing ribosome stalling. However, a main difference with the degradation of functional mRNAs is that the decay of these messages usually bypasses the initial deadenylation step, at least in yeast.</p><p>As deadenylation is rate limiting for the decay of functional mRNAs, it is a main target for the regulation of this process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>). Poly(A) degradation is carried out by deadenylases that show an exonucleolytic activity with a strong preference for poly(A) sequences. In yeast, the major cytoplasmic deadenylase is constituted by the Pop2&#x02013;Ccr4 complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>). This complex is conserved in human and <italic>Drosophila</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>). Interestingly, both subunits of this complex display nuclease activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>). Moreover, the heterodimeric Pop2&#x02013;Ccr4 deadenylase forms a variety of larger complexes by associating with Not and Caf factors, which also affect deadenylation of some mRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>). A second deadenylase identified in yeast is composed of the Pan2 and Pan3 subunits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>). However, its inactivation in yeast results neither in a strong growth phenotype nor in a strong block of deadenylation. It was suggested that the PAN deadenylase was primarily involved in the initial shortening of poly(A) tails of newly made mRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>), a possibility supported by the analysis of its mammalian homologue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>). Finally, a third deadenylase was identified in vertebrate cells, PARN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>). This protein, which shows a limited evolutionary conservation and is mainly located in the nucleoplasm, was not found to affect mRNA turnover in cultured mammalian cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>) but affected deadenylation during meiotic maturation in <italic>Xenopus</italic>. In addition to deadenylases, some factors affecting the deadenylation process have been identified. These include RNA-binding proteins such as the members of the Smaug and PUF protein families that control mRNA decay through deadenylation and directly affect the recruitment of the Pop2&#x02013;Ccr4 deadenylase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30 B31 B32 B33">30&#x02013;33</xref>). Similarly, the eRF3 translation termination factor was proposed to affect the deadenylation process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>).</p><p>The location of Pab1 on poly(A) tails suggests that it may influence deadenylation and mRNA stability. Consistently, it appears to stimulate the activity of PAN and to inhibit the activity of purified Ccr4 <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>). Moreover, Pab1 was proposed to participate in the recognition of premature stop codon in the non-sense-mediated decay (NMD) pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>). The linker and PABC domains of Pab1 were also shown to interact with the Pan3 subunit of the PAN deadenylase, suggesting a direct role in deadenylation control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>). Finally, tethering experiments have suggested that only the recruitment of Pab1 at the 3&#x02032; terminus of the associated mRNA, but not its binding to poly(A) tails, is required for mRNA stabilization; possibly not by affecting deadenylation but rather through slowed decapping (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>).</p><p>We have investigated whether specific domains of Pab1 are specifically implicated in the control of mRNA decay <italic>in vivo</italic>. We show that the deletion of the carboxy-terminal region of Pab1 stabilizes reporter mRNAs <italic>in vivo</italic> by impairing deadenylation, without affecting mRNA export or translation. This conclusion is also supported by the observation that a deletion of the linker region of Pab1 increases its ability to inhibit the Pop2&#x02013;Ccr4 deadenylase <italic>in vitro</italic>. These results indicate that Pab1 is directly involved in the mRNA decay process and reveal the modular nature of this protein with specific regions involved in various cellular functions. They further suggest that the carboxy-terminal domains of Pab1 may be implicated in the control of mRNA stability by regulating the poly(A) packaging, and thus the deadenylation through interactions with <italic>trans</italic>-acting factors.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIAL AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Yeast strains and growth conditions</title><p>Yeast cells were grown in standard media at 30&#x000b0;C, except otherwise indicated.

As a control, a second sample from the 0 time point was treated in addition with a synthetic oligo(dT) to reveal the position of the fully deadenylated species. To estimate the deadenylation rate, signals emanating from species harboring different size of poly(A) (from fully adenylated to completely deadenylated) were measured using PhosphorImager (GE Health Care) by dividing the area in 100 cells of identical size using a column grid. These data were used to calculate, by integration, weighted averages of the poly(A) size at each time point.

Thus, we decided to investigate the <italic>in vivo</italic> role of the C-terminal region of yeast Pab1. Phylogenetic conservation and structural data indicate that it can be subdivided into two domains, a linker region (L) and a C-terminal PABC domain (C) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>A). Thus, we generated mutant strains lacking either the PABC domain (represented as &#x00394;C), the linker region (&#x00394;L) or both (&#x00394;L&#x00394;C) at the genomic <italic>PAB1</italic> locus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>A). Consistent with previous analyses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>), these mutants are viable, however, deletion of the linker alone or in combination with the PABC domain generated a temperature-sensitive phenotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>B) while the PABC deletion did not induce a significant growth phenotype. The growth defects of the &#x00394;L and &#x00394;L&#x00394;C mutants could result either from a specific function of these regions or indirectly from an altered Pab1 level. Indeed, C-terminal deletions might have destabilized the protein. However, western blot analysis of Pab1 levels demonstrated comparable accumulation of this factor in the various genetic backgrounds (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>C). These results reveal an important role of the Pab1 C-terminal region for its activity. To establish a potential link between these domains and mRNA decay, we next combined the &#x00394;L&#x00394;C deletion with mutations in various mRNA decay factors. Construction of double mutants carrying the &#x00394;L&#x00394;C mutation and a <italic>pop2</italic> (or <italic>ccr4</italic>) deletion by crosses and dissection revealed a synthetic lethal phenotype (data not shown). Moreover, when combined with a thermosensitive mutation of the yeast decapping factor Dcp1 the &#x00394;L&#x00394;C mutant generated a synthetic phenotype since it was, unlike the single mutants, unable to grow at 30&#x000b0;C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>D). In contrast, the &#x00394;L&#x00394;C mutant did not exacerbate the thermosensitive phenotype of a <italic>dis3</italic> mutant (data not shown, Dis3 is the catalytic subunit of the exosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>)). These observations globally supported a role for the Pab1 C-terminal region in mRNA decay and suggested further a preponderant involvement in the main 5&#x02032;-3&#x02032; mRNA decay pathway. <fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p>Pab1 Carboxy-terminal deletion mutants and their phenotypes.

We observed that the ratios of protein produced to the level of the cognate mRNA were comparable for all strains at each time point (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>). This result suggests that there is neither a detectable delay in mRNA export to the cytoplasm nor a significant nuclear accumulation of mRNA in the mutant cells compared to the wild-type. Furthermore, the similar protein-to-mRNA ratios indicate that the translation rate per mRNA molecule is also equivalent in the various strains.

To test this possibility, we analyzed the length of the poly(A) tail of the <italic>PGK1pG</italic> reporter mRNA during a transcriptional chase experiment.

Moreover, the size of these mRNAs decreased more slowly in the mutant strain indicating a reduced deadenylation rate.

This value agrees relatively well with the 2.0&#x02013;2.3-fold longer half-life of the reporter mRNAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>).

On the one hand, Pab1 could interact directly with Pop2&#x02013;Ccr4, thereby modulating their activity. On the other hand, Pab1 could affect deadenylation by controlling poly(A) packaging, and thus substrate access by Pop2&#x02013;Ccr4. The former possibility appears unlikely because Pab1 has not been reported as a Ccr4 or Pop2 interacting partner and we have not been able to detect Pab1 above background level in Pop2-TAP purifications or in co-immunoprecipitation assays (data not shown). Thus, we tested whether the deletion of the C-terminal domains of Pab1 was affecting its interaction with poly(A). As a sensitive measure of Pab1 affinity for poly(A), we assayed its dissociation from a polyadenylated RNA. Complexes were formed by incubating a radioactively labeled polyadenylated substrate with an excess of Pab1. At time zero, a 140-fold excess of unlabeled poly(A) was added, preventing the detection of complexes resulting from the reassociation of Pab1 with RNA once it has dissociated from the labeled substrate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>, lane 1). The dissociation of Pab1 was monitored by analyzing the complexes remaining on native gels at various time-points after unlabeled poly(A) addition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>, lanes 2&#x02013;25). This revealed that the dissociation of wild-type Pab1 occurred in a stepwise manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>, lanes 2&#x02013;7). Taking into account the number of adenines covered by the yeast Pab1 [25 nt/protein monomer, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>)] and the size of the poly(A) of the substrate RNA (48 adenines), a maximum of two Pab1 molecules are expected to bind to the substrate poly(A) tail while additional subunits could bind non-specifically to the 153 residue-long mRNA body. The Pab1&#x00394;C protein presented a dissociation pattern similar to the wild-type factor (lanes 8&#x02013;13). Remarkably, for the Pab1&#x00394;L and Pab1&#x00394;L&#x00394;C proteins a different dissociation pattern was observed (lanes 14&#x02013;19 and 20&#x02013;25). In these cases, a rapid initial dissociation of Pab1 bound non-specifically to the mRNA body was followed by the slow release of the two remaining Pab1 molecules in a single step. (Note that only trace amount of the complex containing a single Pab1 molecule could be detected, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>, lane 21 and compare with <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>B. The same RNA and electrophoresis conditions were used in these two experiments and the relative mobility of the complexes are identical) The absence of the band corresponding to a single bound Pab1 molecule when the Pab1&#x00394;L or Pab1&#x00394;L&#x00394;C versions are used suggests an altered dissociation from the poly(A) tails of the versions lacking the linker region. These data support the idea that mRNA stabilization induced by Pab1 truncations results from a different interaction of truncated Pab1 with poly(A). This different mode of binding may cause a different packaging of poly(A) tails and/or a slower cooperative release of Pab1, thus affecting deadenylase access. <fig id="F7" position="float"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><p>The absence of the linker domain affects Pab1 dissociation from Poly(A) tails.

Our data reveal the specific involvement of Pab1 C-terminal domains in the mRNA decay process and uncover the modular nature of the Pab1 factor. Importantly, Pab1 C-terminal domains appear to modulate specifically its interaction with poly(A) and thus the deadenylation step during the mRNA decay.</p><p>Previous analyses had already established the existence of several functional features in the poly(A) binding protein. Thus, the N-terminal RRM region has been implicated in poly(A) binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B55">55</xref>), interaction with the eIF4G translation initiation factor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B56">56</xref>) and association with nucleocytoplasmic transport factors Xpo1 and Kap108 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>). In fact, only a short segment of this region, overlapping RRM4, is essential to provide Pab1 function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>). These pleiotropic functions of the poly(A) binding protein could suggest that the effect of its C-terminal truncation on mRNA stability reported here could be indirect. This is particularly true in the case of translation as its inhibition (e.g. through the use of inhibitors or mutants) strongly affects mRNA stability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B57">57</xref>) and it has been proposed that mRNA stabilization by Pab1 requires ongoing translation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>). However, our data are inconsistent with a role for translation in the mRNA stabilization promoted by Pab1 C-terminal truncation. Indeed, we did not detect a significant effect of these mutants on translation, and <italic>in vivo</italic> mRNA stabilization by truncated Pab1 could be reproduced <italic>in vitro</italic> using purified deadenylase, thus bypassing the need for any translation event. Similarly, the C-terminal deletions did not prevent nuclear mRNA export, consistent with the fact that this region has not been implicated in Pab1 nucleocytoplasmic shuttling. Altogether, it is thus unlikely that the mRNA stabilization that we observe arises from an indirect effect of Pab1 on another cellular process. Therefore, contrasting with previous conclusions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>), our <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic> data demonstrate that Pab1 is directly implicated in mRNA decay. Moreover, our results reveal a specific involvement of the Pab1 C-terminus in this process.</p><p>Which are the targets of the C-terminal region of Pab1 that affect mRNA decay? Our data demonstrate that Pab1 mutants impair mRNA deadenylation. This effect could be mediated <italic>in vivo</italic> by a Pab1 partner associating directly with its C-terminal region such as Pbp1, eRF3 and/or Pan3. Pbp1 binds to the Pab1 linker region but has been shown to control proper poly(A) tail synthesis rather than decay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B58">58</xref>). The eRF3 interacts with Pab1 through its C-terminal PABC domain. However, the function of this conserved interaction in mRNA decay remains unclear (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>). The eRF3 has been reported to affect mRNA decay by altering deadenylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>) but there is no evidence supporting that this occurs through an interaction with Pab1. Moreover, we could not duplicate these original results (data not shown), possibly owing to strain differences. Because Pab1 stimulates Pan2 and interacts directly with Pan3 through its C-terminal region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>), an alternative interpretation could be that removal of the corresponding Pab1 domain inhibits deadenylation by preventing Pan2 action. Several observations argue against this interpretation. First, Pan2 is only responsible for a minor deadenylase activity in yeast implicated in the initial step of mRNA deadenylation and its deletion does not stabilize the reporters analyzed here as strongly as Pab1 truncations [data not shown, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B59">59</xref>)]. Moreover, Pab1 truncation stabilized mRNAs even in a <italic>PAN2</italic> deletion background (data not shown), arguing that these processes occur through independent pathways. Finally, our observation that the deletion of the Pab1 C-terminal region enhances its inhibitory activity towards purified Pop2&#x02013;Ccr4 deadenylase <italic>in vitro</italic> suggests that Pab1 effects occur directly through this enzyme. This interpretation is consistent with the observation that Pop2&#x02013;Ccr4 is the major yeast deadenylase, and thus essential for the normal decay of the reporters we assayed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>).</p><p>Two possible mechanisms explaining how Pab1 affects Pop2&#x02013;Ccr4 could be envisaged. A first possibility was that the Pab1 C-terminal region interacted directly or indirectly with Pop2&#x02013;Ccr4, stimulating its activity, e.g. by increasing its local concentration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>). However, this situation is unlikely as a physical interaction between Pab1 and the Pop2&#x02013;Ccr4 deadenylase was neither reported nor detected. Thus, we favor the possibility that truncations of the Pab1 C-terminal domains alter poly(A) packaging and/or Pab1 release, and thus prevent an efficient access of the Pop2&#x02013;Ccr4 deadenylase. This is consistent with the stronger inhibition of Pop2&#x02013;Ccr4 activity by the truncated Pab1 in a reconstituted <italic>in vitro</italic> system and the evidence for an altered mode of dissociation from poly(A) for these mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>). Further evidence for an altered mode of binding of the truncated Pab1 can be seen upon close examination of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>B. Indeed, lane 18 reveals a lower level of RNA bound by monomeric Pab1&#x00394;L&#x00394;C compared to the wild-type Pab1 (lane 3). This argues again for increased cooperativity in binding that is consistent with the absence of monomeric complex during dissociation. Interestingly, the C-terminal region of <italic>Xenopus</italic> PABP has been implicated in its cooperative binding to poly(A) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B60">60</xref>). A similar property was reported for the mammalian protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B61">61</xref>). While these results are not directly comparable to those obtained in yeast (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>), they support the idea that the C-terminal domains of Pab1 affect poly(A) binding and may thus restrict substrate access. It is noteworthy, however, that assay of the <italic>Lac</italic>Z reporter indicated that translation was not affected by the Pab1 truncation. As translation initiation is a critical step for gene expression, the limited growth phenotype of the Pab1 truncation mutants support also this conclusion. These observations suggest again that the truncations of Pab1 did not affect its capacity to load onto poly(A) (a step required for translation initiation) but rather the mode of poly(A) packaging or Pab1 release.</p><p>In any case, it is noteworthy that the Pab1 C-terminal truncation increases the inhibition of Pop2&#x02013;Ccr4. This indicates that the repression mediated by wild-type Pab1 is not maximal and suggests that deadenylation may be regulated positively or negatively by interacting <italic>trans</italic>-acting factors. It is interesting that deletion of the linker domain produces a stronger phenotype than deletion of the PABC domain in each of the assays performed. This may suggest that the linker domain directly affects the mRNA decay process while the PABC domain may only have a regulatory function. Alternatively, the PABC domain may only affect indirectly mRNA decay by influencing (sterically) access to the linker region.</p><p>Overall, our work reveals a direct involvement of Pab1 in mRNA decay. This effect involves inhibition of the Pop2&#x02013;Ccr4 deadenylase by the absence of the Pab1 C-terminal region, particularly the linker domain. Our observations confirm the pleiotropic function of the poly(A)-binding protein that appears to be a highly modular factor implicated in translation, nucleocytoplasmic transport and mRNA decay. Pab1 could thus be a central target to coordinate these processes in eukaryotic cells. Particularly, given the preponderant role of deadenylation on mRNA decay control, and the variety of known interactions involving the carboxy-terminal region of Pab1, we can easily imagine how these interactions may regulate deadenylation, and thus the mRNA decay process, e.g. by stabilizing or destabilizing Pab1 at the poly(A) tails. Further, work should allow the identification of such putative regulators and contribute to elucidate how the cells select mRNAs to be degraded in given conditions.</p></sec><sec><title>SUPPLEMENTARY DATA</title><p>Supplementary Data are available at NAR Online.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material id="PMC_1" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>[Supplementary Material]</title></caption><media mimetype="text" mime-subtype="html" xlink:href="nar_gkm452_index.html"/><media xlink:role="associated-file" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="msword" xlink:href="nar_gkm452_nar-00756-r-2007-File009.doc"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS</title><p>We thank our group members for help and advice, in particular A.
