Immunoblotting using the anti-phosphotyrosine (PY) antibody indicated the phosphorylation of &#x003b2;1 integrin at least at tyrosine in both cells. Dephosphorylation of &#x003b2;1 integrin from HBE cells by protein tyrosine phosphatase (PTP), but not by protein serine/threonine phosphatase (PP), caused dissociation of actin from &#x003b2;1 integrin, although dephosphorylation of it from MCF-7 cells by either PTP or PP caused association of the two proteins. In MCF-7 cells &#x003b2;1 integrin coprecipitated doublet of proteins having the Ca<sup>2+</sup>/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase (CaMK) II activity that was susceptible to KN-62, a specific inhibitor of CaMKII.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>The results suggest that &#x003b2;1 integrin is tyrosine phosphorylated and links with actin <italic>via</italic> &#x003b1;-actinin in HBE cells but prevented from linking with actin in MCF-7 cells by phosphorylation at both tyrosine and serine/threonine of &#x003b2;1 integrin which forms a complex with &#x003b1;-actinin and CaMKII. Thus the linkage formation of &#x003b2;1 integrin with actin may be differentially regulated by its tyrosine and serine/threonine phosphorylation in normal HBE cells and breast cancer MCF-7 cells.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>The integrin family of surface receptors play a critical role in many cellular processes that include cell adhesion, cell spreading, and growth signaling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Integrins interact extracellularly with the substratum such as collagens at specific sites called focal adhesions and intracellularly with many actin-binding proteins such as &#x003b1;-actinin, talin, and vinculin, thereby linking these proteins with the actin cytoskeleton. Links between cell surface receptor &#x003b2; integrins and the actin cytoskeleton are though to be established in more than one way. Integrin binds to talin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>], which also binds to vinculin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>], which in turn binds to &#x003b1;-actinin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>], which then binds to actin. This constitutes a three-protein link between integrin and actin. In addition, talin can also bind actin directly [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>], so that talin may form a direct one-protein link between integrin and actin. Similarly, the actin-binding protein &#x003b1;-actinin binds to the &#x003b2;1 integrin subunit [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. While many isoforms of &#x003b2;1 integrin have been reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>], a short cytoplasmic domain of 47 amino acids of &#x003b2;1 integrin isoform A contains the three putative domains with the highest affinity for &#x003b1;-actinin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. In addition, several amino acids and motifs within the cytoplasmic domain of the &#x003b2; subunit, which are potential phosphorylation sites, have been implicated in the integrin function. The &#x003b2;1 subunit contains a Val-Thr-Thr sequence and these two threonines appear to be important for adhesion of fibroblast cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>], and adhesion and invasion of lymphoid cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. However, the relevance of phosphorylation of these amino acids within the cytoplasmic domain of &#x003b2;1 integrin in its function remains largely unclear.</p><p>Human breast cancer MCF-7 cells have many cellular properties characteristic to malignantly transformed cells; such as an enhanced growth ability in soft agar and poor cell adhesion to the substatum compared to their normal counterpart HBE cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. Poor cell adhesion of MCF-7 cells to the substratum is thought to be mainly caused by a low level of &#x003b2;1 integrin expression on the cell surface [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. This observation gave a clue to further understanding the relevance of &#x003b2;1 integrin function to cell adhesion, cell spreading, and anchorage-independent growth in cancerous cells. In this study, we examined why only a small population of &#x003b2;1 integrin present in MCF-7 cells is expressed on the cell surface compared to HBE cells, both of which adhere to collagen type IV. Immunoprecipitation and Western blot analysis revealed that intracellular linkage between &#x003b2;1 integrin and actin formed in HBE cells was lost in MCF-7 cells. The relevance of phosphorylation of &#x003b2;1 integrin to its linkage forming ability with actin was also examined in this study using PTP and PP.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>The absence of coprecipitation of actin with &#x003b2;1 integrin in MCF-7 cells</title><p>To determine whether expression of &#x003b2;1 integrin on the cell surface requires its intracellular interaction with the actin cytoskeleton, &#x003b2;1 integrin was immunoprecipitated with the anti-&#x003b2;1 integrin antibody or control IgG from HBE or MCF-7 cells which adhered to collagen IV.

This suggests that both HBE and MCF-7 cells express the same wild-type &#x003b2;1 integrin and that the loss of linkage between &#x003b2;1 integrin and actin may not be due to the structural difference in the cytoplasmic domain of &#x003b2;1 integrin in MCF-7 cells from that in HBE cells.</p><p>The relevance of phosphorylation of the &#x003b2; subunit of integrin at threonine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>] or tyrosine residue [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>] to the integrin functions that include cell adhesion and invasion has been documented. Therefore we next examined the phosphorylation state of &#x003b2;1 integrin and its relation to the linkage formation with actin. Metabolic labeling of cells with [<sup>32</sup>P]orthophosphoric acid and Western blotting using the anti-PY antibody indicated that &#x003b2;1 integrin, but not &#x003b1;-actinin, in either HBE or MCF-7 cells was phosphorylated at least on a tyrosine residue and that there was no apparent difference in the phosphorylation state of &#x003b2;1 integrin between two cells. Therefore, the susceptibility of the linkage forming ability of &#x003b2;1 integrin with actin to PTP or PP was examined. Effects of the PTP treatment of the &#x003b2;1 immunoprecipitates from HBE and MCF-7 cells were contradictory; that is, coprecipitation of actin with &#x003b2;1 integrin from HBE cells was lost, while that of two proteins from MCF-7 cells was induced after incubation of the PTP-treated immunoprecipitates with the supernatant of the immunoprecipitates or with exogenous human platelet actin. As the reactivity of anti-PY antibody with &#x003b2;1 integrin from either HBE or MCF-7 cells was lost by PTP and exogenous actin coprecipitated with PTP-treated &#x003b2;1 integrin from MCF-7 cells, alterations in coprecipitation of actin with &#x003b2;1 integrin may be due to tyrosine dephosphorylation of &#x003b2;1 integrin and not other proteins involved in the immunoprecipitates or the supernatant of the immunoprecipitates. In addition, the result suggests that tyrosine phosphorylation is necessary for &#x003b2;1 integrin to link with actin in HBE cells but inhibitory for it in MCF-7 cells. Contrary to this, treatment of the &#x003b2;1 integrin immunoprecipitates with PP2A<sub>1</sub> did not result in any alteration in coprecipitation of actin with &#x003b2;1 integrin from HBE cells but caused coprecipitation of the two proteins from MCF-7 cells. As PP2A<sub>1</sub> did not affect tyrosine phosphorylation of &#x003b2;1 integrin from either HBE or MCF-7 cells and exogenous actin became coprecipitated with PP2A<sub>1</sub>-treated &#x003b2;1 integrin from MCF-7 cells as endogenous actin in the supernatant, the results suggested that PP2A<sub>1</sub>-induced coprecipitation of &#x003b2;1 integrin from MCF-7 cells with actin may be due to serine/threonine dephosphorylation of &#x003b2;1 integrin rather than other cellular proteins and that the ability of &#x003b2;1 integrin to link with actin in MCF-7 cells may be prevented by its serine/threonine phosphorylation. While it appears that phosphorylation at either tyrosine or serine/threonine is necessary for &#x003b2;1 integrin to link with actin and phosphorylation at both tyrosine and serine/threonine prevents &#x003b2;1 integrin from linking with actin, the linkage formation of &#x003b2;1 integrin with the actin cytoskeleton may be differentially regulated in MCF-7 cells as compared to HBE cells by tyrosine or serine/threonine phosphorylation of &#x003b2;1 integrin.</p><p>Finally we examined whether some protein kinases associate with &#x003b2;1 integrin in MCF-7 cells, using antibodies to several serine/threonine protein kinases. Among these, the anti-CaMKII antibody reacted with doublet of proteins with molecular mass of around 56 kDa which coprecipitated with &#x003b2;1 integrin from MCF-7 cells but not from HBE cells. As the antibody to CaMKII did not react with any protein in the control IgG precipitates from MCF-7 cells, association of the doublet of proteins with &#x003b2;1 integrin may be specific. The results demonstrating that the &#x003b2;1 integrin immunoprecipitates from MCF-7 cells had the kinase activity for a specific substrate peptide, Autocamtide II, under the conditions where calmodulin and inhibitor peptides of PKA and PKC were present and that this kinase activity was completely inhibited by 10 &#x003bc;M KN-62, a specific inhibitor of CaMKII [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>], suggest that the doublet of proteins which associate with &#x003b2;1 integrin in MCF-7 cells may be CaMKII isoforms. Even though the reason for an elevated level of the kinase activity of the &#x003b2;1 immunoprecipitates from HBE cells by KN-62 is unknown at present, it is possible to assume that some unidentified protein kinases which are responsive to KN-62 may associate with &#x003b2;1 integrin in HBE cells. Coprecipitation of CaMKII with &#x003b2;1 integrin in MCF-7 cells does not imply their direct association. As direct association between CaMKII and &#x003b1;-actinin has been reported by yeast two-hybrid and biochemical assays [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>], CaMKII in MCF-7 cells may bind to &#x003b1;-actinin, which may also bind to &#x003b2;1 integrin, forming a ternary complex with &#x003b1;-actinin and &#x003b2;1 integrin. Whether serine/threonine phosphorylation of &#x003b2;1 integrin in MCF-7 cells is regulated by the &#x003b2;1 integrin-associated CaMKII, or whether loss of intracellular linkage between &#x003b2;1 integrin and the actin cytoskeleton causes the reduced cell surface expression of &#x003b2;1 integrin, are areas for further investigation.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Intracellular linkage of &#x003b2;1 integrin with the actin cytoskeleton <italic>via</italic> &#x003b1;-actinin was formed in HBE cells which adhered to type IV collagen. However, this linkage was lost in adherent MCF-7 cells. The present results suggest that tyrosine phosphorylation may be required for &#x003b2;1 integrin to link with actin in HBE cells, but phosphorylation of &#x003b2;1 integrin at both tyrosine and serine/threonine residues in MCF-7 cells may cause dissociation of actin from it. Thus the linkage formation of &#x003b2;1 integrin with the actin cytoskeleton may be differentially regulated by its tyrosine and serine/threonine phosphorylation in normal HBE cells and breast cancer MCF-7 cells.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Cell culture and replating on collagen type IV</title><p>HBE cells obtained form Clonetics were maintained in serum-free defined medium MCDB 170 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>] supplemented with 10 ng/ml EGF, 1.4 &#x003bc;M hydrocortisone, 5 &#x003bc;g/ml insulin, 0.1 mM ethanolamine, 0.1 mM phosphoethanolamine, and 25 &#x003bc;M prostaglandin E2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>] at 37&#x000b0; C in a humidified atmosphere of 95% air and 5% CO<sub>2</sub>.
