Patients present clinical symptoms of dry eyes and dry mouth. The exocrinopathy may occur alone (primary SS) or in association with another autoimmune disorder (secondary SS) such as rheumatoid arthritis or systemic lupus erythematosus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Inflammatory reactions in the lacrimal and salivary glands with lymphoid neogenesis, and specifically germinal center formation, are reported in SS patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>].</p><p>The lymphotoxins (LT&#x003b1; and LT&#x003b2;) and LIGHT (a cytokine homologous to LTs that shows inducible expression and competes with herpes simplex virus glycoprotein D for herpes virus mediator [HVEM], a receptor induced on T cells) and their receptors are part of the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) superfamily. LT&#x003b1; exists in both secreted and membrane-bound forms. The membrane-bound form is a complex of LT&#x003b1; and LT&#x003b2; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>], forming in humans a predominant LT&#x003b1;<sub>1</sub>&#x003b2;<sub>2 </sub>heteromer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. This ligand binds the LT&#x003b2; receptor (LT&#x003b2;R) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>] along with LIGHT [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. For a detailed review of LT and LIGHT signaling, see [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>].</p><p>The LT&#x003b2;R signaling pathway is important in the development of organized lymphoid structures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. In the differentiated tissue, the LT&#x003b2;R signaling pathway is involved in the control of expression of chemokines and adhesion molecules that aid in the movement of lymphocytes and in their compartmentalization into T- and B-cell zones, high endothelial venule (HEV) development, and follicular dendritic cell (FDC) network formation and in the positioning and numbers of dendritic cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. This signaling pathway is also crucial in lymphoid neogenesis at sites of inflammation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. Lymphoid neogenesis is reported in human chronic inflammatory diseases (including SS) and associated mouse models (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]).</p><p>The efficacy of LT&#x003b2;R pathway blockade (that is, the blocking of activation of LT&#x003b2;R by either of its ligands via the pharmacological inhibitor LT&#x003b2;R-immunoglobulin fusion protein [LT&#x003b2;R-Ig]) has been studied in many murine disease models (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]), and a human version was used in rheumatoid arthritis clinical trials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>].</p><p>In non-obese diabetic (NOD) mice, treatment with LT&#x003b2;R-Ig prevented insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM) and reversed insulitis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. In addition, soluble LT&#x003b2;R-Ig transgene expression on the NOD background blocked diabetes development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. In addition to spontaneously developing IDDM, the NOD mouse spontaneously develops lymphocytic infiltrates in the exocrine glands, with associated glandular dysfunction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. Although the <italic>Idd3 </italic>and <italic>Idd5 </italic>susceptibility loci for diabetes have a role in the development of sialadenitis, the IDDM and sialadenitis are two independent autoimmune events [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>].</p><p>The aim of the present study was to analyze the effects of LT/LIGHT axis blockade by the pharmacological inhibitor LT&#x003b2;R-Ig on SS-like salivary gland disease in female NOD mice, introducing the inhibitor prior to the development of the SS-like disease. The study confirmed that blocking the LT&#x003b2;R pathway results in ablation of the lymphoid organization in the NOD salivary glands, leading to an improvement in salivary gland function.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Animals and treatment protocols</title><p>Female NOD/LtJ mice were purchased from The Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME, USA) and maintained in accordance with standard animal housing and welfare guidelines.

In summary, eight mice that were not treated (NT) were euthanized at 9 weeks (NT9 group) and formed the baseline of the experiment. Beginning at 9 weeks of age, groups of eight mice were given weekly intraperitoneal injections of 100 &#x003bc;g of either LT&#x003b2;R-Ig (murine receptor fused to mouse IgG1, which has been described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]) or mouse monoclonal IgG1 (MOPC 21) for 3, 7, and 10 weeks. Mice were then euthanized 1 week after the last injection (that is, at 12, 16, or 19 weeks). The LT&#x003b2;R-Ig-treated mice are subsequently referred to as LT12, LT16, and LT19 and the MOPC 21-treated ones as MO12, MO16, and MO19, respectively.

We used the blood glucose levels as an in-house control to determine the efficacy of LT&#x003b2;R-Ig treatment. Both the number of injections and the type of treatment (either LT&#x003b2;R-Ig or MOPC 21) played a role in determining the glucose levels, as shown by the significant interaction effect (<italic>P </italic>&#x0003c; 0.001). This finding was underscored by the low glucose levels at 16 weeks in the LT16 group compared with age-matched controls, and at 19 weeks, the LT19 group glucose levels were not only lower than those of the LT16 group, but also significantly different from those of age-matched controls (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1b</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>LT&#x003b2;R-Ig treatment inhibits submandibular gland inflammation</title><p>Submandibular salivary glands were examined for inflammation. The ratio index and focus score were used to determine the level of inflammation and the two methods showed a strong correlation (<italic>r </italic>= 0.807, n = 75, <italic>P </italic>&#x0003c; 0.001). LT&#x003b2;R-Ig-treated groups had reduced levels of inflammation as they aged and also the lowest inflammation levels compared with the controls at the different ages at which the mice were examined (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1c, d</xref>). Collectively, the levels of inflammation increased as the NOD mice aged, with the oldest (19-week-old) untreated mice (NT19) recording the highest inflammation in the study (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1c, d</xref>). In marked contrast to MOPC 21-treated and untreated mice, the inflammation levels (focus score and ratio index) in LT&#x003b2;R-Ig-treated mice never differed significantly from levels of healthy 9-week-old pre-disease mice. The inflammation levels of the LT19 group were significantly different from those of the NT19 group, but the comparison between LT19 and MO19 was not significant (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1c, d</xref>). However, the main effect of treatment (comparing all LT&#x003b2;R-Ig-treated mice with all MOPC 21-treated groups using two-way between-groups ANOVA) was significant for both ratio index (<italic>P </italic>= 0.005) and focus score (<italic>P </italic>= 0.007).</p><p>After establishing that inflammation was indeed inhibited, we were interested in determining the specific components affected by the treatment and in establishing a time line for disease development.

The loss of FDC networks on blocking the LT&#x003b2;R pathway in adult mice has been described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>], but the present study is the first to report that LT&#x003b2;R-Ig treatment results in FDC network loss in the salivary glands. FDC networks constitutively release a substantial amount of CXCL13 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>], although there are other sources of CXCL13, such as macrophages, dendritic cells, and primed follicular helper T cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. CXCL13 recruits B cells and follicular helper T cells to the B-cell zones. Immunohistochemistry disclosed that both LT&#x003b2;R-Ig-treated mice and controls expressed CXCL13 at the protein level in the salivary glands. There was, however, a depletion of B-cell zones by 19 weeks (LT19 group). This was probably attributable to the reduction in the amount of CXCL13, as indicated by the reduction in CXCL13 mRNA expression levels in the LT19 group compared with controls. The complete loss of FDC networks following LT&#x003b2;R-Ig treatment may also have contributed to the lack of B-cell zones in the LT19 group.</p><p>There was also an all-out loss of HEVs in the salivary glands in the LT16 and LT19 groups. HEVs exhibit specific address signals that are recognized by circulating lymphocytes. PNAd is one such signal (antigen) that was first defined by reactivity with monoclonal antibody MECA-79 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. L-selectin on the circulating lymphocytes binds carbohydrate epitopes of PNAd, facilitating homing of these na&#x000ef;ve lymphocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]. Previous studies have reported a prominent role for the LT&#x003b2;R pathway in maintaining the HEV structures in a functional state in lymph nodes of adult mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>] and in sites of lymphoid neogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]. The LT&#x003b2;R pathway is also important in <italic>de novo </italic>lymphangiogenesis in sites of lymphoid neogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>].</p><p>Although the mRNA expression levels of CCL19 were not significantly reduced in the LT&#x003b2;R-Ig-treated mice, there was a complete loss of CCL19 protein in the salivary gland infiltrates of LT&#x003b2;R-Ig-treated mice. CCL19 and CCL21 are necessary for the transmigration of na&#x000ef;ve T cells and central memory T cells across the HEVs and in the formation of T-cell zones [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>]. Therefore, the combination of ablation of FDC networks, loss of HEVs, and reduced chemokine expression would ultimately result in a reduced influx of B and T cells to the salivary glands. This may explain the reduced B- and T-cell zones in the LT&#x003b2;R-Ig-treated mice.</p><p>Another interesting observation was the different response to LT&#x003b2;R-Ig treatment by the salivary gland lesion and the draining lymph nodes. There is no consensus as to which of these sites drives the immune response or whether there is a contribution from both [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Our findings indicate that the LT&#x003b2;R-Ig treatment had a more profound effect on the microarchitecture of the salivary gland lymphoid tissue than on that of the lymph node.</p><p>Our findings also suggest that the salivary gland lesion has a prominent role in SS-like disease, as partial saliva flow restoration occurs in association with the phenotypic changes in the salivary gland. The ectopic lymphoid tissue has a prominent role in several diseases/conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. In the NOD mouse, pancreatic lymphoid neogenesis could initiate and sustain the progression of IDDM in the absence of draining lymph nodes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>]. Interestingly, it has been proposed that LT&#x003b2;R-Ig treatment would result in a quiescent state of the lymph nodes, draining the sites of inflammation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. This is partly supported by the present study, showing microarchitectural differences between LT&#x003b2;R-Ig-treated mice and control lymph nodes. However, the lymph node microarchitectural changes in our experimental setup are unlike the grossly disturbed primary or secondary organ development observed in mice deficient in components of the LT&#x003b2;R pathway.</p><p>The present study was based on the hypothesis that LT&#x003b2;R-Ig treatment would preserve the integrity of the salivary gland by preventing development and progression of inflammation and lymphoid neogenesis, thus preventing the occurrence of salivary gland dysfunction. Our results, however, show that LT&#x003b2;R-Ig treatment may reverse pathological events that have already occurred in the salivary gland. This possibility is underscored by the finding of HEVs in the salivary glands of 12-week-old mice given three LT&#x003b2;R-Ig injections (although in only one mouse) but loss of HEVs in 16-week-old and 19-week-old mice treated with LT&#x003b2;R-Ig. Earlier analyses in mice suggested that a period of at least 2 weeks of LT&#x003b2;R-Ig treatment was required to downmodulate HEVs and therefore any early HEVs could still be present at week 12 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. Also, the saliva flow rate appeared to fall (comparing LT12 and LT16 groups) but recovered in the LT19 group, indicating that the salivary gland dysfunction may have been prevented or reversed.</p><p>The dichotomous distribution of saliva flow rates in NOD mice has been described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>]. The same study also used saliva proteins to describe the efficacy of intervention agents in SS-like disease of NOD mice. In our study, the striking similarity in the cytokine profiles of the pre-disease NT9 group and the LT19 group may indicate a restoration of the pre-disease quality of saliva in the LT19 group. However, analysis of pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines in saliva from untreated mice across different ages disclosed no obvious trend indicative of progressive disease status. However, 16 weeks may mark a time of potentially heightened cytokine production and activity in the NOD mouse.</p><p>Accelerated clearance of immunoglobulin-based agents is commonly observed in many rodent autoimmune disease models, and our finding of a reduction in the serum levels of LT&#x003b2;R-Ig as the mice age also points to a possible increased clearance of the fusion protein in these older NOD mice. It is postulated that, had the high levels of LT&#x003b2;R-Ig observed in 12-week-old mice been sustained throughout the experiment, the protective/reversal effects of LT&#x003b2;R-Ig would have been more pronounced.</p><p>There are severe technical limitations to finding proper controls for fusion proteins when faced with the need to use high-level dosing in autoimmune disease models to maintain coverage.

It is hoped that our results will contribute to the development of appropriate methods for treatment of human SS.</p></sec><sec><title>Abbreviations</title><p>ANOVA: analysis of variance; BSA: bovine serum albumin; CCL: C-C chemokine ligand; CXCL: C-X-C chemokine ligand; FDC: follicular dendritic cell; HEV: high endothelial venule; IDDM: insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus; IL: interleukin; LIGHT: a cytokine homologous to lymphotoxins that shows inducible expression and competes with herpes simplex virus glycoprotein D for herpes virus mediator (HVEM), a receptor induced on T cells; LT: lymphotoxin; LT&#x003b2;R: lymphotoxin-beta receptor; LT&#x003b2;R-Ig: lymphotoxin-beta receptor-immunoglobulin fusion protein; MOPC 21: mouse monoclonal IgG1; NOD: non-obese diabetic; NT: not treated; PBS: phosphate-buffered saline; PNAd: peripheral (lymph) node addressin; QPCR: quantitative polymerase chain reaction; SS: Sj&#x000f6;gren syndrome; TNF: tumor necrosis factor.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>JLB and AP are employees of Biogen Idec.
