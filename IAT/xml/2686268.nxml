In these cell types, HIV-1 entry is mediated by the binding of envelope glycoproteins (gp120 and gp41, Env) to the receptor CD4 and a coreceptor, principally CCR5 or CXCR4, depending on the viral strain (R5 or X4, respectively). Uninfected CD4 T cells undergo X4 Env-mediated autophagy, leading to their apoptosis, a mechanism now recognized as central to immunodeficiency.</p></sec><sec><title>Methodology/Principal Findings</title><p>We demonstrate here that autophagy and cell death are also induced in the uninfected CD4 T cells by HIV-1 R5 Env, while autophagy is inhibited in productively X4 or R5-infected CD4 T cells. In contrast, uninfected macrophages, a preserved cell population during HIV-1 infection, do not undergo X4 or R5 Env-mediated autophagy. Autophagosomes, however, are present in macrophages exposed to infectious HIV-1 particles, independently of coreceptor use. Interestingly, we observed two populations of autophagic cells: one highly autophagic and the other weakly autophagic. Surprisingly, viruses could be detected in the weakly autophagic cells but not in the highly autophagic cells. In addition, we show that the triggering of autophagy in macrophages is necessary for viral replication but addition of Bafilomycin A1, which blocks the final stages of autophagy, strongly increases productive infection.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions/Significance</title><p>Taken together, our data suggest that autophagy plays a complex, but essential, role in HIV pathology by regulating both viral replication and the fate of the target cells.</p></sec></abstract><counts><page-count count="11"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>HIV-1 can infect and replicate in both CD4 T cells and macrophages, however, only CD4 T lymphocytes are depleted during HIV-1 infection. This indicates that several aspects of the virus-host relationship are different between CD4 T cells and macrophages <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005787-Wahl1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>. Whatever the cell type, HIV-1 entry is mediated by the binding of envelope glycoproteins (gp120 and gp41, Env) to the receptor CD4 and a coreceptor, principally CCR5 or CXCR4. gp120 interacts initially with CD4 and then with the coreceptor. This leads to gp41 insertion into the target membrane and membrane fusion. Coreceptor use is correlated, at least in part, with the different phases of the disease. R5 strains, which use CCR5 for entry, are responsible for the primary infection while X4 strains, which use CXCR4, emerge later in the course of infection and are associated with a severe depletion of CD4 T cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005787-Scarlatti1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>. Infection by both cell-free viruses and by cell-to-cell contact between infected and uninfected cells, involving the formation of virological synapses, leads to the spread of HIV.

This process is characterized by the formation of double membrane vacuoles, named autophagosomes, which engulf cytoplasmic material. Following maturation, autophagosomes fuse with lysosomes to digest the sequestered material <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005787-Xie1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>.

In addition, some controversy still exists about the cytopathic effects of X4 and R5 HIV-1 strains. The emergence of X4 strains in HIV-1-infected patients correlates with a rapid progression to AIDS. Differences in the distribution of CCR5 and CXCR4 on the CD4 T cells, however, may also explain these results. Indeed, CCR5 is expressed on 5 to 25&#x00025; of peripheral blood CD4 T cells while CXCR4 is expressed on nearly all peripheral blood CD4 T cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005787-Grivel1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005787-Schweighardt1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005787-Blanco2">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005787-Berkowitz1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>We have already demonstrated that autophagy is an important mechanism involved in the demise of uninfected bystander CD4 T cells, via CXCR4. It remains to be established, however, whether the same is true when the CCR5 coreceptor is used. In addition, macrophages, that express both CXCR4 and CCR5, are also infected by HIV-1, but are not depleted.</p><p>We, therefore, analyzed autophagy in CD4 T cells and macrophages, the two main target cells of HIV-1, during infection with either X4 or R5 strains. We first established that Env triggers autophagy and cell death in uninfected CD4 T cells, whatever the coreceptor use. In contrast, uninfected macrophages, a cell population known to be resistant to cell depletion in patients, do not undergo X4 or R5 Env-mediated autophagy and cell death. Furthermore, during HIV-1 productive infection, we demonstrate that autophagy is repressed in CD4 T cells but induced and regulated in macrophages. Autophagy is thus differentially used and controlled in HIV-1-infected cells, and consequently may govern the course of the disease.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Cellular coculture models to analyze Env-mediated autophagy of uninfected cells</title><p>We have used cellular models that involve cell-to-cell contact, as this is known to be important in HIV-1 pathogenesis.

Autophagy is triggered in these cells when they are cocultured with Env-expressing HEK.293 effector cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005787-g002">Figure 2</xref>). When MOLT-4 cells were cocultured with the HEK.293 cells transfected with X4 NL4-3 or R5 NL4-Ad8 DNA constructs that produce infectious virions, two target cell populations were observed: a population of highly autophagic cells, that did not present detectable budding virions at the cell surface by TEM, and a non autophagic population that was productively infected (cells with budding virions) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005787-g004">Figure 4A</xref>).

It is worth noting that the weakly autophagic cells contained very small autophagosomes. Furthermore, these cells harboured large numbers of empty vesicles.

In all cases, released virions were infectious (data not shown).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Discussion</title><p>The major factor involved in the development of AIDS is the depletion of uninfected, bystander CD4 T cells, while the population of macrophages remains unaffected. Both of these cell types can be productively infected by HIV-1, however there are major differences in the features of this infection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005787-Cassol1">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005787-Verani1">&#x0005b;25&#x0005d;</xref>. Firstly, CD4 T cells must be activated before they can be productively infected, a process that includes cell division, while productive infection can be established in macrophages even though they are not dividing. Secondly, following HIV infection, gene expression is differentially modulated, contributing to both greater survival of macrophages and facilitation of HIV-1 replication. Thirdly, in contrast to CD4 T cells, macrophages are more prone to R5 infection than X4 infection. Fourthly, viral assembly events may also differ. Indeed, although it is clear that it occurs at the plasma membrane in CD4 T cells, in macrophages, there is still some debate. HIV-1 budding has recently been shown to take place at the plasma membrane, even if many data indicate that it buds into, and accumulates in, endocytic compartments, named multivesicular bodies (MVB) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005787-Wahl1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005787-Marsh1">&#x0005b;26&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005787-Carter1">&#x0005b;27&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005787-Gousset1">&#x0005b;28&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005787-Jouvenet1">&#x0005b;29&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005787-Jouve1">&#x0005b;30&#x0005d;</xref>. Furthermore, although they are both immune cells, their functions are highly different, and thus, they have different strategies in regulating the innate and/or adaptative responses against pathogens. In particular, macrophages are able to capture and digest microbes, as well as to present antigenic peptides <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005787-Carter1">&#x0005b;27&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>A lot of recent data indicates that autophagy is a fundamental antiviral mechanism <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005787-Schmid1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005787-Orvedahl1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005787-Espert2">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>. Almost nothing is currently known, however, concerning the global role of autophagy in HIV-1 pathogenesis. We have demonstrated that autophagy is directly responsible for the destruction of uninfected CD4 T cells during HIV-1 infection by X4 strains <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005787-Espert1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref> whereas autophagy is inhibited in X4 HIV-1-infected CD4 T cells and U937 cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005787-Zhou1">&#x0005b;31&#x0005d;</xref>. In addition, a recent functional genomic screen in TZM-bl cells has shown that members of the two protein-conjugation pathways involved in autophagy: Atg7, Atg8, Atg12 and Atg16L2 are critical regulators of HIV infection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005787-Brass1">&#x0005b;32&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>We demonstrate here that Env from both R5 and X4 strains triggers autophagy and cell death in uninfected CD4 T cells. This result is consistent with the fact that, during acute infection, HIV-1 destroys a large number of CCR5 CD4 memory T lymphocytes in the intestinal mucosa through cytopathic and apoptotic mechanisms <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005787-Li1">&#x0005b;33&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005787-Mattapallil1">&#x0005b;34&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005787-Mehandru1">&#x0005b;35&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>In contrast to CD4 T cells, however, uninfected macrophages do not undergo Env-mediated autophagy, whatever the coreceptor used, indicating that autophagy triggered by Env is a cell-type dependent process. This discrepancy raises unsolved questions about the mechanism that leads to Env-mediated autophagy and how it is regulated in a cell type-dependent manner. The fusogenic function of gp41 is known to be responsible for the induction of autophagy in CD4 T cells after contact with infected cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005787-Denizot1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>. However, this event also occurs in uninfected macrophages cocultured with HIV-1-infected cells. One hypothesis to explain this discrepancy is that gp41-induced perturbations, triggered at the membrane of both macrophages and CD4 T cells, could be either different or differentially regulated. Indeed, additional macrophage-specific membrane interactions exist following Env binding to receptor/coreceptor, including annexin II, p21 and &#x003b1;-v-integrin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005787-Wahl1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005787-Bosch1">&#x0005b;36&#x0005d;</xref>. HIV-1 can also enter macrophages by endocytosis or after interaction with innate immune receptors such as macrophage mannose receptor <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005787-Trujillo1">&#x0005b;37&#x0005d;</xref>. Furthermore, recent data demonstrate that ceramides, that are known inducers of autophagy, play an important role in membrane protein reorganization <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005787-Chiantia1">&#x0005b;38&#x0005d;</xref>, a phenomenon that is necessary for HIV-1 entry into cells.</p><p>A second hypothesis is that gp120 binding to CD4 and the coreceptor, steps that precede gp41 insertion into the target membrane, transduces signals that counteract Env-mediated autophagy in a cell-type dependent manner. We also cannot exclude a role of the secretion of chemokines and/or cytokines in regulating gp41-induced autophagy. Further investigation is needed to answer this point. Importantly, our data also demonstrate that autophagy is regulated by HIV-1. In CD4 T cells productively infected by either X4 or R5 strains, autophagy is totally inhibited. These results are in accordance with those obtained by Zhou and Spector who have demonstrated that Beclin 1 and LC3-II are decreased in X4-infected CD4 T cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005787-Zhou1">&#x0005b;31&#x0005d;</xref>. Since autophagy induced by Env in the uninfected CD4 T cells leads to cell death, this result also suggests that HIV-1 is capable of counteracting Env-mediated apoptosis in infected CD4 T cells by inhibiting autophagy, thus allowing viral replication to occur. In the monocyte/macrophage cell lineage (from monocytes to differentiated macrophages), autophagy plays a more complex role. On one hand, autophagy is triggered in these cells following X4 or R5 HIV-1 infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005787-g005">Figure 5</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005787-g006">Figure 6</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005787-g007">Figure 7</xref>) and blockade of this process by 3-MA dramatically decreases the p24 levels, strongly suggesting that autophagy is required for viral replication in monocytes/macrophages. On the other hand, autophagy triggered in X4 and R5-infected MDM reduces HIV-1 infection. Indeed, addition of BafA1, a compound that inhibits the acidification of lysosomes and endosomes, and thus, at a later stage, lysosomal degradation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005787-Klionsky1">&#x0005b;39&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005787-Yamamoto1">&#x0005b;40&#x0005d;</xref>, increases HIV-1 production. This result is correlated with the observation that no virion is visible by TEM in either highly autophagic or non autophagic cells from the monocyte/macrophage cell lineage, while weakly autophagic cells contain intact virions. These results are however in contradiction with data from Zhou and Spector <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005787-Zhou1">&#x0005b;31&#x0005d;</xref> showing autophagy to be decreased in the promonocytic cell line U937 after HIV-1 infection. Thus, HIV-1 is able to usurp the autophagic machinery in MDM, most probably to support viral replication, as already described for other viruses <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005787-Espert2">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005787-Lee1">&#x0005b;41&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005787-Miller1">&#x0005b;42&#x0005d;</xref>. However, autophagy also plays a major role in limiting viral replication and is not totally controlled by HIV-1-infected MDM since blockade of the lysosomal degradation step increases viral production. Interestingly, both X4 and R5 strains trigger autophagy in HIV-1-infected MDM, but the percentage of weakly <italic>versus</italic> highly autophagic cells depends on the strain. Indeed, X4-infected MDM are mainly highly autophagic, with more than 10 autophagosomes per cell section, and thus are less infected than R5-infected MDM that are essentially weakly autophagic (less than 10 autophagosomes per cell section). This is consistent with the physiopathology of HIV-1 infection since R5 strains are more infectious than X4 strains in MDM. This suggests that the regulation of autophagy is one of the mechanisms explaining the course of infection.</p><p>One hypothesis could be that HIV-1 is still an emerging viral pathogen that is not yet totally adapted to replicate in its different host cells <italic>i.e.</italic> it has not &#x0201c;achieved&#x0201d; the control of autophagy in both infected and uninfected cells, essentially macrophages and CD4 T lymphocytes, respectively. We do not currently know how autophagy is controlled by the cell and/or by the virus and no data have yet brought clear responses concerning the differential susceptibilities of HIV-1 target cells to X4 and R5 HIV-1 infection. However, to the best of our knowledge, these findings represent the first example of a differential cell-type control of autophagy that governs both viral replication and the fate of uninfected cells.</p><p>In conclusion, our data strongly suggest that autophagy is responsible for HIV-1 pathogenesis, providing new insights into therapeutic strategies for the future.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Effector cell lines expressing Env</title><p>The HEK.X4 Env cell line, used in previous studies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005787-Roggero1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005787-Espert1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>, is a HEK.293 cell line stably transfected with the T-tropic HIV-1 defective pBRU&#x00394;gag construct. 2 &#x000b5;M Methotrexate was used as selection marker.
