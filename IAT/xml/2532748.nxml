A transcriptional co-repressor complex containing LSD1&#x02013;CoREST&#x02013;HDAC1 (termed LCH hereafter for simplicity) represses transcription by coordinately removing histone modifications associated with transcriptional activation. RE1-silencing transcription factor (REST) recruits LCH to the promoters of neuron-specific genes, thereby silencing their transcription in non-neuronal tissues. ZNF198 is a member of a family of MYM-type zinc finger proteins that associate with LCH. Here, we show that ZNF198-like proteins are required for the repression of E-cadherin (a gene known to be repressed by LSD1), but not REST-responsive genes. ZNF198 binds preferentially to the intact LCH ternary complex, but not its individual subunits. ZNF198- and REST-binding to the LCH complex are mutually exclusive. ZNF198 associates with chromatin independently of LCH. Furthermore, modification of HDAC1 by small ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO) <italic>in vitro</italic> weakens its interaction with CoREST whereas sumoylation of HDAC1 stimulates its binding to ZNF198. Finally, we mapped the LCH- and HDAC1&#x02013;SUMO-binding domains of ZNF198 to tandem repeats of MYM-type zinc fingers. Therefore, our results suggest that ZNF198, through its multiple protein-protein interaction interfaces, helps to maintain the intact LCH complex on specific, non-REST-responsive promoters and may also prevent SUMO-dependent dissociation of HDAC1.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="12"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>The ordered assembly of genomic DNA into a proteinacious substance&#x02014;chromatin&#x02014;allows for high-order regulation of DNA-templated processes, such as transcription, replication, and DNA repair.

A fraction of the abundant class I HDACs, HDAC1 and HDAC2, associate with LSD1&#x02013;CoREST, forming an <underline>L</underline>SD1&#x02013;<underline>C</underline>oREST&#x02013;<underline>H</underline>DAC1/2 (LCH) core ternary complex <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003255-Humphrey1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003255-Hakimi1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>.

For example, RE1-silencing transcription factor (REST), which is a Kr&#x000fc;ppel-like zinc finger-containing protein, binds directly to CoREST and recruits the LCH complex to neuron-specific gene promoters that contain RE1 elements, thus repressing the expression of neuron-specific genes in non-neuronal tissues <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003255-Andres1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003255-Ballas1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>.

We show that depletion of ZNF198, ZNF261, and ZNF262 by RNA interference (RNAi) in HeLa cells causes derepression of E-cadherin, a known target of LSD1. By contrast, ZNF198-like proteins are not required for the transcriptional repression of several REST-responsive genes that are repressed by LSD1. Consistent with this finding, ZNF198 selectively binds to the LSD1&#x02013;CoREST&#x02013;HDAC1 ternary complex and binding of ZNF198 to LCH prevents its interaction with REST. Similar to dWoc, ZNF198 associates with chromatin. Depletion of ZNF198-like proteins weakens the association of LCH with chromatin. Furthermore, sumoylation of HDAC1 decreases its affinity toward CoREST, but enhances its binding to ZNF198. Finally, the tandem repeats of MYM-type zinc fingers of ZNF198 mediate its binding to both LCH and sumoylated HDAC1. Collectively, our results suggest that, unlike the Kr&#x000fc;ppel-like zinc fingers which bind to DNA, the MYM-type zinc fingers of ZNF198-like proteins mediate multiple protein-protein interactions, maintains the integrity of the LCH complex at non-REST-responsive promoters, and may antagonize SUMO-dependent disassembly of the LCH complex.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>ZNF198 associates with LSD1, CoREST, and HDACs in human cells</title><p>The MYM-type zinc fingers have the CX<sub>2</sub>CX<sub>19&#x02013;24</sub>&#x0005b;F/Y&#x0005d;CX<sub>3</sub>CX<sub>3</sub>&#x0005b;F/Y&#x0005d; (X is any residue) consensus motif <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003255-Reiter1">&#x0005b;28&#x0005d;</xref>.

However, the tandem zinc fingers of REST are Kr&#x000fc;ppel-like zinc fingers that mediate sequence-specific DNA-binding to RE1-elements in promoters <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003255-Schoenherr1">&#x0005b;50&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003255-Chong1">&#x0005b;51&#x0005d;</xref>. Structure comparison reveals that the MYM-type zinc fingers in ZNF198 have a fold that is distinct from that of the Kr&#x000fc;ppel-like zinc fingers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003255-g007">Figure 7<italic>C</italic></xref>). In particular, the long &#x003b1;-helix that mediates DNA binding in Kr&#x000fc;ppel-like zinc fingers <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003255-Pavletich1">&#x0005b;52&#x0005d;</xref> is much shorter in the MYM-type zinc fingers. Therefore, the MYM-type zinc fingers are unlikely to bind to DNA in a manner similar to the Kr&#x000fc;ppel-like zinc fingers. In fact, a search using the Dali server (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/dali">http://www.ebi.ac.uk/dali</ext-link>) revealed that the fold of MYM-type zinc fingers is most related to that of the LIM (<underline>L</underline>in11, <underline>I</underline>sl-1 &#x00026; <underline>M</underline>ec-3) domain. LIM domains are also often found in tandem repeats and mediate protein-protein interactions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003255-Kadrmas1">&#x0005b;53&#x0005d;</xref>. The structural similarity between the MYM and LIM domains further supports a role for MYM-type zinc fingers in mediating protein-protein interactions.</p><p>In conclusion, we have revealed a functional requirement of ZNF198-like proteins in transcriptional repression of LSD1-repressed genes that are not REST-responsive. Our results further suggest the following model to explain the mechanism by which ZNF198 promotes the functions of LSD1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003255-g008">Figure 8</xref>). In this model, ZNF198 binds to chromatin and recruits the LSD1&#x02013;CoREST&#x02013;HDAC1 ternary complex to chromatin. The MYM-type zinc fingers of ZNF198 mediate its interactions with the LCH complex and with sumoylated HDAC1. Through its ability to engage in multiple protein-protein interactions, ZNF198 stabilizes the LCH complex on chromatin and possibly prevents the dissociation of HDAC1 from the complex that is triggered by HDAC1 sumoylation.</p><fig id="pone-0003255-g008" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0003255.g008</object-id><label>Figure 8</label><caption><title>Proposed mechanisms by which ZNF198 regulates the LSD1&#x02013;CoREST&#x02013;HDAC1 complex.</title><p>See <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s3">DISCUSSION</xref> for details.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="pone.0003255.g008"/></fig></sec></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Protein expression and purification</title><p>SUMO-related constructs and protein purification were described previously <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003255-Gocke1">&#x0005b;33&#x0005d;</xref>.
