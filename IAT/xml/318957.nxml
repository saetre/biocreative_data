The recombinant clones were screened by differential hybridisation with 32P-cDNA probes synthesized from vitamin D replete and deficient chick intestinal mRNA. Two clones had outstanding affinity with the +D probe. Hybrid-arrested and hybrid-selected translation systems showed that both clones hybridised to mRNA coding for immunoprecipitable CaBP. The mRNA for CaBP has a 100 bp G,C rich sequence before a 786 bp coding region followed by 1250 nucleotides 3' untranslated region. Nucleotides coding for the Ca-binding sites show a high degree of homology for Ca-binding sites in chick calmodulin and rat intestinal CaBP. The amino acid sequence specified by the longest open reading frame contains five Ca-binding sites but is too large for the native CaBP; post-translational modification must therefore occur.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><supplementary-material content-type="scanned-pages"><graphic xlink:href="nar00318-0207.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="8867"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00318-0208.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="8868"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00318-0209.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="8869"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00318-0210.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="8870"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00318-0211.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="8871"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00318-0212.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="8872"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00318-0213.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="8873"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00318-0214.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="8874"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00318-0215.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="8875"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00318-0216.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="8876"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00318-0217.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="8877"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00318-0218.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="8878"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00318-0219.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="8879"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00318-0220.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="8880"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00318-0221.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="8881"/></supplementary-material></body></article>
