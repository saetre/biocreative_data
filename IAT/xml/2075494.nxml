There are 170 million people worldwide infected with HCV, representing a significant public health problem. Only a small fraction of individuals develop immunity and clear virus infection naturally. The majority of people exposed to HCV slowly develop into chronic infection. Long-standing chronic inflammation in the liver due to the virus infection leads to liver cirrhosis and carcinoma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. Infection with HCV is the leading cause of liver transplantation in the United States [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. Standard therapy for chronic HCV infection is a combination of IFN-&#x003b1; and ribavirin, but the majority of chronic hepatitis C patients cannot clear their infection with this regimen. Patients infected with genotype 1 HCV in the United States are frequently resistant to IFN-&#x003b1; and ribavirin treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. The reason why some chronic hepatitis C patients do not respond to interferon therapy is unknown.</p><p>The HCV belongs to the family <italic>Flaviviridae</italic>. There are six different genotypes of HCV distributed worldwide with more than 50 subtypes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. There is 30% sequences variation among each genotype, 15% among sub-types and 1&#x02013;5% among quasisspecies. The organization of HCV RNA genome among all genotypes is similar. It begins with a 5'untranslated region (UTR), long-open reading frame and a 3' UTR region [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. The HCV genome encodes a large polyprotein of 3000 amino acids, which is processed into structural and non-structural protein in the infected cells by viral and cellular proteases. Some reports demonstrate that certain genotypes of HCV respond better to interferon therapy compared than others. For an example, 80% of chronic hepatitis C patients infected with genotype 2 and 3 can clear the virus infection, while only 50% in patients infected with genotype 1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>] show a sustained virological response. This clinical observation suggests the involvement of viral factors in response to interferon therapy. A number of molecular studies have been performed with results suggesting that some of the HCV structural and/or non-structural viral proteins block the interferon induced antiviral pathways [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. The molecular basis of HCV resistance to interferon has focused on NS5A and E2 protein action on the interferon induced protein kinase R [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. Recent studies also suggest that the HCV protease (NS3/NS4A) can block the production of endogenous of IFN-beta [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. Most of the studies of IFN resistance have focused on virus-related factors, and little attention has been paid to host factors. The underlying mechanisms of interferon resistance against chronic hepatitis C are not yet clear. The HCV RNA replicon systems have now proved to be a suitable model to study the host-virus interaction. Understanding how viral and host factors influence interferon sensitivity is important as it may lead to the development of alternative strategies to improve the success rate of interferon based antiviral therapy.</p><p>Interferons are a family of cytokines that play a very important role in innate immunity and protect humans from infections with number of viruses and intracellular organisms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. The interferon system is activated during viral infection of a host cell, thus inhibiting virus replication during the host innate immune response. There are two types of interferon. Type I interferon includes IFN-&#x003b1; and interferon beta (IFN-&#x003b2;) and Type II interferon includes interferon gamma (IFN-&#x003b3;). Since endogenous interferon produced by the infected cell is not sufficient to eliminate the infection, exogenous recombinant human IFN-&#x003b1; has been therefore used to treat chronic hepatitis C. The cloning and sequencing of functional cDNAs for each interferon has made it possible to use this cytokine as a potential antiviral to treat number of virus infections [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. The antiviral action of interferon is initiated when IFN-&#x003b1; binds the receptor. Interferon binding to the cell surface receptors activates the intracellular signaling pathways, which involve Janus kinase (JAK1), tyrosine kinase 2 (TYK2) and signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT1 and STAT2) proteins. The JAKs phosphorylate STAT proteins that either homo-or heterodimerize and translocate to the nucleus thus inducing the expression of the IFN-stimulated genes (ISG). The phosphorylated STAT1 and STAT2 combine with IRF-9 (interferon regulatory factor 9) to form a trimeric ISGF-3 complex. This complex enters the nucleus and binds to a consensus DNA sequence [GAAAN(N)GAAA] called the interferon stimulated response element (ISRE) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. This regulatory sequence is present upstream of most IFN-&#x003b1; and IFN-&#x003b2; responsive genes. These cascades of molecular signaling are essential for stimulation of interferon mediated gene transcription. Previous studies in our laboratory suggest that activation of interferon stimulated responsive element (IFN-promoter) is critical in a successful antiviral response against hepatitis C. This activation of interferon induced gene activation via JAK-STAT pathways varies among different Huh-7 clones [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>].</p><p>This study was initiated to define the significance of IFN-promoter activation in different replicon cell lines with respect to the antiviral action of IFN-&#x003b1;2b. We found that replicon cell lines with a low-level induction of interferon promoter frequently develop resistance to IFN-&#x003b1;. In this report, we have developed several stable replicon cell lines in which replication of HCV is totally resistant to IFN-&#x003b1;. The role of viral and cellular factors in the mechanisms of IFN-resistance was examined. We showed here that the altered expression of proteins in the Jak-Stat signaling pathway of replicon cells block IFN-induced gene activation and cause interferon resistance.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Isolation of interferon resistant HCV replicon cell lines</title><p>Previously, we reported data suggesting that activation of this ISRE-promoter is important for a successful antiviral action of IFN-&#x003b1; in replicon cells (37). It was observed that the level of expression of luciferase from IRES promoter by interferon varies among HCV replicon cell clones. To understand the significance of this observation, we performed the present study to determine whether the differences in the level of ISRE-promoter (IFN-promoter) activation among different replicon cells are related to interferon sensitivity. Three different replicon cell lines showing lower ISRE promoter activation (Con-15, Con-17 and Con-24) and three replicon cell line with higher ISRE promoter activation (5&#x02013;15, 9&#x02013;13 and KR) were treated with IFN-&#x003b1;2b (10&#x02013;1000 IU/ml) and cultured in the medium containing G-418 (1 mg/ml). All six replicon cell lines used in our experiments have been prepared using prototype Con1 sub-genomic replicon HCV RNA (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>). The HCV replicon is a dicistronic chimeric RNA which contains the gene encoding for neomycin phosphotransferase (conferring resistance to G-418) downstream of the HCV IRES. The second cistron in the same RNA contains encephalomyocarditis virus IRES sequences for efficient translation of HCV non-structural proteins and this chimeric RNA terminates with the HCV 3'UTR. This sub-genomic RNA replicates at a high level in Huh-7 cells and cell colonies develop that are resistant to G-418. The ability of HCV sub-genomic RNA to replicate and form G-418 cell colonies in the presence and absence of IFN-&#x003b1; was examined. IFN-&#x003b1; efficiently inhibited HCV RNA replication in three replicon cell lines with higher activation of ISRE promoter and there were no viable cell colonies are formed. However, antiviral action of interferon against HCV was partially effective in the cell line having lower activation of ISRE promoter since many visible clones were found (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). The cell clones that survived interferon treatment grew well in the presence of interferon alpha. Individual clones were picked and nine different stable cell lines from each low inducer replicon [Con-15 (15/1, 15/2, 15/3), Con-17 (17/1, 17/2, 17/3) and Con-24 (24/1, 24/2, 24/3)] were prepared. The nine different replicon cell lines were maintained in the presence of IFN-&#x003b1;2b (1000 IU/ml) for prolonged periods to make sure that they are truly resistant to interferon.</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Diagram of the sub-genomic replicon and reporter plasmid constructs used in the experiments</bold>.

All nine replicon cell lines were cultured in a medium containing 1 mg/ml of G-418 in the presence of cyclosporine-A or IFN-&#x003b1;. Their ability to form G-418 cell colonies was measured in 100-mm tissue culture dishes. Results shown in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>, indicate that all resistant replicon cell lines grew in the presence of IFN-&#x003b1; but not in the presence of Cyclosporine-A. It is known that Cyclosporine-A inhibit HCV RNA replication in Huh-7 cells by a different mechanism independent of Jak-Stat pathway. There is one report documenting that replication efficiency depends upon cell proliferation. To examine the possibility that interferon resistance phenotype seen in the replicon cells is due to certain growth advantage as compared to sensitive cells, growth rate of nine different replicon cells were over one week was compared to sensitive cell lines. No significant differences in cell growth were observed between nine different resistant cell lines and five different sensitive cell lines.</p><fig position="float" id="F3"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p><bold>Three panels showing HCV replication and protein expression in IFN resistant replicon cell lines</bold>.

IFN treatment abolished NS3 protein expression in sensitive cells (S-5/15). No inhibition was seen in any of these three resistant cell lines (R-Con-15, R-Con-17 and R-Con-24).</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1743-422X-4-89-3"/></fig><p>To make sure that intracellular HCV RNA levels are steadily maintained in the interferon treated cells, total RNA was isolated from each replicon cell line and subjected to RPA assay using probe targeted to the 5' UTR. Results of this experiment (Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref>) indicated that the 296 nucleotides protected band was detectable in all resistant cell lines. There were no differences in the HCV RNA levels between cells that were treated with or without interferon. Intracellular HCV RNA levels in the nine different replicon cells were examined by RPA assay after Cyclosporine-A treatment. The level of HCV protein expression was compared between sensitive and resistant replicon cells after interferon treatment by immunocytochemical staining using a monoclonal antibody to NS3 protein. Results of this experiment are shown in (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3C</xref>) indicating all resistant cells maintain high levels of viral protein expression after interferon treatment.</p></sec><sec><title>Interferon resistant replicons showed reduced IFN-signaling</title><p>We reasoned there might be two possibilities that could contribute to the IFN-resistant phenotypes in the cell culture models. First possibility is that sustained expression of viral proteins directly block Jak-Stat signaling and make cells insensitive to interferon. The second possibility is that there may be a defect at the level of intracellular signaling of interferon in these replicons. We have showed earlier that IFN-&#x003b1; successfully inhibits translation and replication of full-length as well as sub-genomic HCV RNA in Huh-7 cells suggesting that viral protein expression did not inhibit interferon action. To clarify the role of cellular contribution in the mechanism of IFN-resistance, HCV replication was eliminated from each cell line by treatment with Cyclosporine-A. The success of Cyclosporine-A treatment and absence of HCV RNA in these cured cells was confirmed by RPA and immunostaining for HCV NS3 protein. Cured cell lines were prepared from each resistant replicon and cultured in regular growth medium without G-418. Interferon signaling pathway in cured replicon cells was examined using a construct pISRE-luciferase reporter plasmid (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>) in a transient transfection assay. Results obtained from those experiments suggested that luciferase activity in all the nine different replicon cells were significantly low as compared to the interferon sensitive cell lines (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>). The differences in the results of luciferase expression from the ISRE promoter between IFN-sensitive and IFN-resistant cells are found to be statistically significant (p &#x0003c; 0.05).</p><fig position="float" id="F4"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><p><bold>IFN signaling in established replicon cell lines</bold>.

Interferon first binds to cell surface receptor that leads to activation of down stream Jak-Stat signaling and activation of antiviral genes. First we determined whether the interferon resistant phenotypes in these cells is due lack of expression of functional interferon receptors on the cell surface. To test this possibility, we performed a binding assay using <sup>125</sup>I-labeled interferon and nine different cured resistant cell lines. The binding assay results were compared with a cured interferon sensitive cell line to see the differences (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>).

The receptor binding studies were also confirmed by examining expression of interferon receptors using protein lysates by western blot analysis (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>).

Equal amounts of protein extracts were examined for the expression of Jak-1, Tyk-2, Stat1, Stat 2 and Stat3 by Western blot analysis. The expression of unphosphorylated IFNAR1, Jak-1, Tyk2, Stat1, Stat2 and Stat3 protein between IFN-sensitive and IFN-resistant cells is shown in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7A</xref>. The results of this experiment revealed that all resistant replicon cell lines we developed have reduced expression of Tyk2 as compared to the sensitive replicon cells. In some resistant replicons expression of Jak-1 was also reduced. There were no differences in the expression of Stat 1 and Stat 2 proteins between sensitive and resistant cells.</p><p>Interferon treatment leads to tyrosine phosphorylation of Stat 1 and Stat 2 protein followed by heterodimerization of Stat1 and Stat 1. This dimer then enters the nucleus to drive the transcription of antiviral genes. Therefore, phosporylation status of Stat1 and Stat 2 proteins between IFN-sensitive and resistant replicon cells was examined using phosphorylation specific commercially available antibodies (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7B</xref>). It was observed that phosphorylation of Stat1 and Stat2 was strongly inhibited in all interferon resistant replicons as compared to the IFN-sensitive replicon. The differences seen in our analysis is not due to the differences in the amount of proteins loaded into the gel since beta-actin levels are found to be similar.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>Interferon alpha in combination with ribavirin is the standard treatment for patients with chronic hepatitis C virus infection. This therapy can eliminate virus infection in approximately 80% of patients infected with genotype 2 or 3, and 50% in patients infected with genotype 1. The reason why many patients infected with genotype 1 virus fail to eradicate the virus is not clear. The mechanisms of the resistance may be multifactorial. Several molecular studies have been performed indicating that the viral factor plays a role in the persistent hepatitis C virus infection and interferon resistance. Results of these studies indicate that full-length as well as individual proteins of HCV (NS5A, Core, NS3 and E2) block interferon action. Among all the viral proteins studied the NS5A protein of HCV has been proposed to be crucial for determining interferon sensitivity. Chronic hepatitis C patients showing amino acid substitution in the IFN-sensitivity determining region (2209&#x02013;2248) of NS5A was found to have a good response to interferon therapy. The role of ISDR mutation and mechanisms of interferon resistance is not yet conclusive. In contrast, clinical observations have suggested that host factors may also play roles in IFN response [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>].</p><p>In this report, we used hepatic cell lines replicating sub-genomic RNA since they represent similar to chronically infected liver cells. Different laboratories including our own have used the replicon based cell lines to test interferon action against HCV replication. Results of all these studies now suggest that interferon can successfully inhibit replication of HCV sub-genomic RNA. Interferon treatment activates a cascade of signal transduction pathways through its cell surface receptors that stimulate synthesis of numerous antiviral genes. This signaling cascade involves cell surface receptors, Janus kinase (Jak-1) and tyrosine kinase 2 (Tyk-2) and signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT1 and STAT2) proteins. The Jak-1 and Tyk-2 phosphorylate the STAT proteins which either homo-or heterodimerizes and then translocates to the nucleus and then binds to a consensus DNA sequence called the interferon stimulated response element (ISRE). This regulatory sequence is present upstream of most IFN-&#x003b1; and IFN-&#x003b2; responsive genes. These cascades of molecular signaling are essential for the stimulation of interferon mediated gene transcription. To support this notion we previously showed that interferon alpha treatment activates the ISRE promoter driven transcription of luciferase gene by transient transfection experiments and the pathways that leading to IFN-promoter activation also varies among different replicon cell lines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>].</p><p>To understand the significance of IFN-promoter activation and interferon resistance in replicon cell lines, we treated high and low inducer replicon cell lines with IFN-&#x003b1;2b for a prolonged period of time with varied amount of IFN starting from 10 IU to 1000 IU/ml. It was found that cells that show a low level of IFN-promoter activation could not eliminate HCV replication in all cells since some Huh-7 clones develop resistance to interferon. Using this approach, we developed interferon resistant cell lines by treating low inducer replicon cells with alpha interferons. We showed clearly that all these resistant replicons have sustained viral replication that cannot be inhibited by alpha interferon. The intracellular HCV RNA levels and protein levels did not alter after interferon treatment. We clarified that viral factors do not contribute to the acquisition of IFN-resistance in these replicon cells since the cured cells prepared from each replicon still show reduced IFN signaling. Interferon signaling in the cured cells was determined using a luciferase based reporter assay. It was determined that there were no differences in the level of IFN-promoter activation in all resistant cell lines with or without HCV replication. Based on these evidences the role of virus contribution to the mechanisms of IFN-resistance in replicons was excluded. Expression of GFP from HCV IRES was examined between sensitive and resistant in the presence of interferon and found that HCV IRES translation is not inhibited in resistant Huh-7 cells. These results indicated that interferon resistant phenotypes associated in our replicon cell line might be due to a specific defect in the IFN-signaling pathways.</p><p>To identify the defect that is responsible for reduced interferon signaling in these replicon cells, expression of Jak-Stat proteins of interferon was examined. Interferon signaling occurs through a series of protein-protein interactions that initiate through a cell surface receptor expression. We examined the expression of interferon receptor expression by Western blot analysis as well as by using receptor-binding assay. All the nine resistant cell lines bind to iodinated IFN-&#x003b1;. It was determined that the nature of the defect is not due to the lack of expression of functional receptors on the cell surface. We then examined the expression of the down-stream signaling protein of the Jak-Stat pathway between IFN-sensitive and resistant replicons. An equal amount of protein lysates were first tested for beta actin levels to exclude the possibility that differences are not due to a lack of adequate amounts of protein in the extracts. It was found that all resistant Huh-7 cells have reduced expression of Tyk2. Reduced expression of Jak-1 was also observed in some resistant Huh-7 cells. The levels of Stat1 and Stat2 expression was found be similar between resistant and sensitive replicons. The phosphorylation of Stat1 and Stat2 proteins were found to be strongly inhibited in all replicon cell lines. Taken together our results suggest that the lack of phophoryated STAT may be due to the reduced expression of Jak-1 and Tyk2 in resistant replicons. Our data suggests that the defect in Jak-Stat signaling can contribute to the interferon resistant phenotypes.</p><p>While these studies are in progress, there are other laboratories also reported the development IFN-resistant replicon cell lines. Studies by Sumpter et al [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>] suggest that a mutated replicon upon high passage develops resistance to interferon. This suppression was due to a reduced activation of IFN-stimulated gene expression and blockage at the viral IRES translation. Namba et al [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>] developed an IFN-resistant replicon by prolonged treatment with low doses of IFN-&#x003b1;. These investigators have examined the genetic alteration associated with the interferon resistance. They found amino acid substitution in the NS4B and several amino acid substitutions in the NS5A regions suggesting that mutation in the viral sequence are involved in the IFN-resistance. Subsequent studies by the same group by Naka et al [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>] reported that interferon resistance in the replicon cells caused by functional disruption of type I interferon receptor gene (IFNAR1 and IFNAR2c). Another study by Zhu et al [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>] suggested that mutation in the viral sequence is not responsible for interferon resistance rather interferon resistance is due to a defect in the Stat 3 activation. In this report the authors did not notice any differences in the Stat1 and Stat2 phosphorylation. Our results suggest that a specific defect in the expression of components in the Jak-Stat pathways leads to defective Stat1 and Stat 2 phosphorylation. Because of these defects, replicon cells are unable to transmit signal to the nucleus and unable to induce antiviral gene expression by interferon. The underlying mechanisms of reduced expression of Tyk2 and Jak1 proteins in these resistant cell clones are under investigation. We propose that examining the intracellular interferon signaling pathways using IFN-sensitive and resistant hepatocytes from chronically infected humans may provide critical information regarding the mechanisms of interferon resistance in the chronic hepatitis C.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Replicon Cells</title><p>Human hepatoma cell line Huh-7 cells were obtained from the laboratory of James Wilson, Wistar Institute of Human Gene Therapy, Pensylvania, grown in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Medium (D-MEM), supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), non-essential amino acids and sodium pyruvate.

HCV positive strand RNA was detected by a ribonuclease protection assay using an antisense riboprobe targeted to the highly conserved 5' UTR region. These results were directly compared with interferon sensitive cell lines.

The cells were permeabilized by treatment with 0.05% saponin for 10 minutes at room temperature. Blocking was performed with 5% normal goat serum (Sigma Chemical Company, St. Louis, MO) diluted in minimum essential medium for 30 minutes at room temperature. Blocking for endogenous biotin-avidin was performed using a commercially available kit (Avidin/Biotin Blocking Kit, Vector Laboratories Inc., Burlingame, CA).
