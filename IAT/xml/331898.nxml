The enzyme activity has been detected in a wide variety of organisms ranging from bacteria to nonplacental mammals. However, the evidence for photoreactivation in placental mammals, including humans, is controversial. As a first step to identify the presence and activity of the gene in mammalian species, we isolated a cDNA clone of this gene from a marsupial, the South American opossum Monodelphis domestica. Photolyase activity was expressed in Escherichia coli from the cDNA which is predicted to encode a polypeptide of 470 amino acid residues. The deduced amino acid sequence of this protein is strikingly similar to those of photolyases from two metazoans; the opossum photolyase shares 59% and 63% sequence identity with the Drosophila melanogaster and goldfish Carassius auratus enzymes, respectively. However, no closely related nucleotide sequence was detected in higher mammals and a homologous transcript was undetectable in a number of human tissues. These results strongly suggest that humans, as well as other placental mammals, lack the photolyase gene.</p><sec><title>Images</title><fig id="F1"><graphic xlink:href="nar00044-0114-a" xlink:role="4122"/></fig><fig id="F2"><graphic xlink:href="nar00044-0115-a" xlink:role="4123"/></fig><fig id="F3"><graphic xlink:href="nar00044-0115-b" xlink:role="4123"/></fig></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><supplementary-material content-type="scanned-pages"><graphic xlink:href="nar00044-0111.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="4119"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00044-0112.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="4120"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00044-0113.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="4121"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00044-0114.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="4122"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00044-0115.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="4123"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00044-0116.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="4124"/></supplementary-material></body></article>
