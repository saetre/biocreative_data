Frequently, PI is diagnosed as part of a larger clinical presentation in cystic fibrosis or Shwachman&#x02013;Diamond syndrome. In this study, a mouse model for isolated exocrine PI was identified in a mouse line generated by a transgene insertion. The trait is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern, and homozygous animals are growth retarded, have abnormal immunity, and have reduced life span. Mice with the disease locus, named <italic>peque&#x000f1;o (pq),</italic> exhibit progressive apoptosis of pancreatic acinar cells with severe exocrine acinar cell loss by 8 wk of age, while the islets and ductal tissue persist. The mutation in <italic>pq/pq</italic> mice results from a random transgene insertion. Molecular characterization of the transgene insertion site by fluorescent in situ hybridization and genomic deletion mapping identified an approximately 210-kb deletion on Chromosome 3, deleting two genes. One of these genes, <italic>Serpini2,</italic> encodes a protein that is a member of the serpin family of protease inhibitors. Reintroduction of only the <italic>Serpini2</italic> gene by bacterial artificial chromosome transgenic complementation corrected the acinar cell defect as well as body weight and immune phenotypes, showing that deletion of <italic>Serpini2</italic> causes the peque&#x000f1;o phenotype. Dietary supplementation of pancreatic enzymes also corrected body size, body weight, and immunodeficiency, and increased the life span of <italic>Serpini2</italic>-deficient mice, despite continued acinar cell loss. To our knowledge, this study describes the first characterized genetic animal model for isolated PI. Genetic complementation of the transgene insertion mutant demonstrates that <italic>Serpini2</italic> deficiency directly results in the acinar cell apoptosis, malabsorption, and malnutrition observed in <italic>pq/pq</italic> mice. The rescue of growth retardation, immunodeficiency, and mortality by either <italic>Serpini2</italic> bacterial artificial chromosome transgenic expression or by pancreatic enzyme supplementation demonstrates that these phenotypes are secondary to malnutrition in <italic>pq/pq</italic> mice.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="synopsis"><sec id="st1"><title>Synopsis</title><p>Pancreatic insufficiency is defined by the inability to digest and absorb nutrients due to the loss of pancreatic enzyme function or loss of the acinar cells that produce the enzymes. In this manuscript the authors have described a mouse model of pancreatic insufficiency characterized by the specific loss of pancreatic acinar cells. This specific acinar cell loss results in mice that are unable to digest and absorb nutrients from the diet, stunting the animal's growth and giving rise to immunological anomalies. The authors have identified a serendipitous transgene insertion/deletion encompassing the mouse <italic>Serpini2</italic> gene locus as the source of the phenotypes observed. Reintroduction of the <italic>Serpini2</italic> gene, a member of the serpin family of serine cysteine protease inhibitors, by bacterial artificial chromosome complementation corrects the pancreatic and immunological phenotypes of the disorder, confirming <italic>Serpini2</italic> as the responsible gene. Reintroduction of pancreatic enzymes through diet supplementation is also capable of correcting the reduction in size and weight, reduction in viability, and immunological deficiencies, indicating that these phenotypes are secondary to malnutrition alone.

However, in approximately 5&#x00025; of the transgenic lines produced, an insertional mutation at the genomic integration locus also occurs &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0010038-b01">1</xref>&#x0005d;. Often the insertion of the transgene is accompanied by a loss of surrounding genomic sequences and, dependent on the location of nearby coding and regulatory sequences, will produce an observable phenotype. We have been able to take advantage of such a transgene insertion/deletion event to identify and characterize a mouse model of pancreatic insufficiency (PI).</p><p>PI or a lack of pancreatic enzymes can lead to malabsorption due to an inability to digest and absorb nutrients. The most common genetic disorder that exhibits PI is cystic fibrosis (CF), as 95&#x00025; of patients with CF have pancreatic acinar cell loss, with fatty cell replacement and interstitial fibrosis &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0010038-b02">2</xref>&#x0005d;. A second example of a syndrome that involves PI is the Shwachman&#x02013;Diamond syndrome (SDS). Patients present with PI due to pancreatic acinar cell loss, but also have clinical manifestations of short stature, neutropenia, pancytopenia and predisposition to acute myelogenous leukemia &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0010038-b03">3</xref>&#x0005d;.</p><p>Animal models of acute PI have been created by inducing pancreatic acinar cell apoptosis, either by administration of the synthetic cholecystokinin analog caerulein &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0010038-b04">4</xref>&#x0005d; or by physical blockage of the pancreas by ductal ligation &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0010038-b05">5</xref>&#x0005d;. However, defined genetic animal models of PI have been lacking. Only recently has a genetic model for an inbred CF mouse been described that recapitulates pancreas involvement of the disorder; however, this animal also manifests other features of CF &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0010038-b06">6</xref>&#x0005d;.</p><p>In this paper we describe a new mouse model for exocrine PI that arose serendipitously in a line of mice carrying a transgene insertion. This insertion event resulted in a genomic deletion of the gene encoding the protease inhibitor SERPINI2/ PANCPIN. The mutant allele, termed <italic>peque&#x000f1;o</italic> (which is the Spanish word for &#x0201c;small&#x0201d;), is characterized by severe exocrine acinar cell loss at 8 wk of age, while islets and ductal tissue are spared. The disorder is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern, and untreated homozygotes are malnourished, with a body weight one-third smaller than control littermates. Secondary to the malnutrition, these animals also have compromised immunity and a reduced life span. Administration of pancreatic enzyme diet supplementation is sufficient to reverse the effects of malnutrition in <italic>pq/pq</italic> animals, counteracting the growth defects, decreased viability, and immunodeficiency.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Identification and Pathology of the Peque&#x000f1;o Mouse Line</title><p>In offspring of a p3pTVA-B line of transgenic mice that were bred to homozygosity, we observed runted mice with a reduced viability phenotype that we called peque&#x000f1;o (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0010038-g001">Figure 1</xref>A). Line p3pTVA-B was one of five independent transgenic mouse lines generated using the <italic>Pax3</italic> promoter to drive expression of the avian retroviral receptor <italic>tv-a</italic> &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0010038-b07">7</xref>&#x0005d;. The four other lines generated did not produce the peque&#x000f1;o phenotype, suggesting that it was the site of transgene insertion that caused the phenotype. Analyses of 34 progeny resulting from the intercross of two obligate heterozygous mice demonstrated that 24 transgenic offspring (71&#x00025;) were produced, in line with the expected Mendelian ratio. Six of the transgene-positive mice (6/34, 17.6&#x00025;) were significantly smaller at weaning, suggesting that they were homozygous for a recessive mutation. Fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) analyses of metaphase spreads from three peque&#x000f1;o animals using the p3pTVA construct as a probe were performed. All three mice were homozygous for the transgene insertion on mouse Chromosome 3 (data not shown). We concluded that the peque&#x000f1;o phenotype is due to a homozygous mutation <italic>(pq/pq)</italic> that is linked to the transgene insertion and that the phenotype is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern, as the heterozygotes had no apparent manifestations.</p><p>The <italic>pq/pq</italic> mice were on average one-third the weight of wild-type littermates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0010038-g001">Figure 1</xref>B) and produced a gray-colored stool. Pathological assessment at 8 wk of age revealed that the spleen and thymus were dramatically reduced in size and the pancreas was abnormal by histological analyses of affected animals when compared to unaffected littermates. Gross skeletal abnormalities were not visible by X-ray or skeletal preparation (data not shown). The thymus of homozygous mutants (<italic>n &#x0003d;</italic> 6) were about 4-fold smaller than wild-type littermates (<italic>n &#x0003d;</italic> 6) (2.90&#x00025; versus 11.44&#x00025; thymus/brain weight; <italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 2.5 &#x000d7; 10<sup>&#x02212;5</sup>). Similar results were observed for the spleen (4.05&#x00025; versus 16.7&#x00025; spleen/brain weight; <italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 9.7 <italic>&#x000d7;</italic> 10<sup>&#x02212;7</sup>). Histological examination of the endocrine pancreas for <italic>pq/pq</italic> mice revealed that islets and ductal tissue appeared normal. Analysis of the exocrine pancreas showed a striking loss of acinar cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0010038-g001">Figure 1</xref>). Histological evaluation of the pancreas of younger animals at 1 wk of age showed abnormal acinar cells that contained fewer zymogen granules (ZGs) than those of littermate controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0010038-g001">Figure 1</xref>G and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0010038-g001">1</xref>H). However, by 3 wk of age <italic>pq/pq</italic> animals had only about one-half the number of the pancreatic acinar cells when compared to wild-type, despite the normal appearance of ductal and endocrine islet cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0010038-g001">Figure 1</xref>F). This observation indicated that extensive acinar cell loss was occurring between 1 and 3 wk of age in <italic>pq/pq</italic> animals.</p><p>Further analyses of the pancreas from 1-wk-old <italic>pq/pq</italic> animals by electron microscopy revealed a reduction in size and number of dense ZGs in the cytoplasm of the <italic>pq/pq</italic> acinar cells and a lack of dense material within the ductal network (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0010038-g002">Figure 2</xref>). In contrast, the pancreas of wild-type littermates contained many ZGs, and electron-dense material representing large quantities of enzymes is found in the pancreatic ducts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0010038-g002">Figure 2</xref>A). Additionally, many <italic>pq/pq</italic> acinar cells were found to exhibit hallmark features of cells undergoing apoptosis. These acinar cells were smaller than adjacent cells and contained compact cytoplasmic organelles, condensed nuclear chromatin, and concentrically whirled bodies of rough endoplasmic reticulum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0010038-g002">Figure 2</xref>B&#x02013;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0010038-g002">2</xref>D). In addition, these acinar cells were observed being phagocytosed by neighboring epithelial cells while some were sloughed directly into the ductal lumina (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0010038-g002">Figure 2</xref>B&#x02013;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0010038-g002">2</xref>D) &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0010038-b08">8</xref>&#x0005d;. As a second independent method of assessing apoptosis, pancreatic tissue was analyzed for DNA fragmentation using terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase biotin&#x02013;dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) staining. Pancreas sections from two animals in each group (wild-type and <italic>pq/pq</italic>) were counted for TUNEL staining in 12 independent, randomly selected fields (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0010038-g002">Figure 2</xref>E and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0010038-g002">2</xref>F). The number of TUNEL-positive cells for <italic>pq/pq</italic> animals (mean counts of 7.2 and 4.9 cells per field) was significantly increased when compared to that of the wild-type (0.33 and 0.25 cells per field). Analyses of the four pair-wise comparisons were statistically significant (<italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.01). Taken together, these results are consistent with apoptosis as the major cause of acinar cell loss.</p><p>To test the hypothesis that growth failure is caused by PI, <italic>pq/pq</italic> animals were treated with a dietary supplementation of pancreatic enzymes in addition to a normal diet and assessed for correction of the malnutrition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0010038-g003">Figure 3</xref>). Animals supplemented with a pancreatic enzyme diet were monitored for size, weight, and viability. Treated <italic>pq/pq</italic> mice gained both weight and length when compared with untreated <italic>pq/pq</italic> animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0010038-g003">Figure 3</xref>A and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0010038-g003">3</xref>B). As expected, the enzyme supplement did not correct the acinar cell deficiency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0010038-g003">Figure 3</xref>G). We conclude that the PI alone was responsible for the growth retardation in <italic>pq/pq</italic> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0010038-g003">Figure 3</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Identification of the Gene Responsible for the Peque&#x000f1;o Phenotype</title><p>To refine the location of the transgene insertion site in peque&#x000f1;o mice, the p3pTVA transgene was hybridized to heterozygous <italic>pq/&#x0002b;</italic> chromosome spreads in combination with bacterial artificial chromosomes (BACs) spanning Chromosome 3 using multicolor FISH. BACs spanning 52,290,000&#x02013;85,000,000 bp of Chromosome 3 were identified with NCBI Map Viewer (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/mapview/">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/mapview/</ext-link>) mouse build 31, and obtained from Children's Hospital Oakland Research Institute (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.chori.org/bacpac">http://www.chori.org/bacpac</ext-link>). This analysis showed that the BAC clones RP23-388I15 and RP23-296I12 flanked the p3pTVA transgene insertion and mapped the insertion to a 2.3-MB region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0010038-g004">Figure 4</xref>). This region contained four genes of known function and several putative genes represented by expressed sequence tags and/or gene prediction algorithms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0010038-g004">Figure 4</xref>B). One candidate gene in the region, <italic>Serpini2,</italic> a serpin protein family member, is predicted to be a serine-cysteine protease inhibitor.

PCR analysis established that the transgene insertion caused in an approximately 210-kb genomic deletion at the locus, which included the entire <italic>Serpini2</italic> gene and continued distally to include several 3&#x02032; exons of Ensembl-predicted novel gene transcript sequences ENSMUST00000062199.1 (E-62199.1) and ENSMUST00000038943.1 (E-38943.1) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0010038-g004">Figure 4</xref>B). The size and location of the deletion established the possibility that the peque&#x000f1;o phenotype could be a recessively inherited contiguous gene syndrome.</p><p>We reasoned that the restricted expression of the <italic>Serpini2</italic> gene in pancreas and adipose tissue as well as its proposed function as a serine protease inhibitor suggested that deletion of the <italic>Serpini2</italic> locus alone caused the peque&#x000f1;o phenotype. An alternative explanation was that deletion of the two Ensemble-predicted transcript sequences E-62199.1 and E-38943.1 contributed to the phenotype. Sequence analysis of the predicted exons for E-62199.1/E-38943.1 suggested they are a single gene and an ortholog of the human locus Unigene cluster Hs.376728. The human gene sequence and predicted mouse gene sequences are identical in exon&#x02013;intron structure and are 75&#x00025; identical at the amino acid level. The <italic>peque&#x000f1;o</italic> deletion includes the entire <italic>Serpini2</italic> gene locus and exons 14 to 17 of E-62199.1/E-38943.1, leaving the first three exons intact.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>BAC Transgene Complementation Cross Rescues Peque&#x000f1;o Acinar Cell Defect</title><p>In order to dissect the role of <italic>Serpini2</italic> and rule out the predicted genes as candidates for peque&#x000f1;o, we produced a BAC transgenic line, 150E1, to perform <italic>Serpini2</italic> complementation crosses with peque&#x000f1;o mice. BAC RP23-150E1 was selected using the University of California at Santa Cruz February 2003 browser because it contained the entire intact <italic>Serpini2</italic> gene and 71 kb of the upstream promoter region, but not a functional E-62199.1/E-38943.1 gene.

In particular, the increase in the percentage of single-positive CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> and CD8<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> cells argues that the cells exhibit no defects in selection and can progress to the most mature stages of thymic development. These results suggested that thymic development was not blocked per se, but that there was reduced cell input or viability at multiple stages.</p><p>We also observed a defect in B cell development.

In contrast, <italic>pq/pq</italic> mice had fewer pro- and pre-B cells (B220<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>IgM<sup>&#x02212;</sup>), and expression of IgM on immature cells was lower, particularly at day 28 (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0010038-g005">Figure 5</xref>B). Within the B220<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>sIgM<sup>&#x02212;</sup> fractions, the most immature pro-B cell fractions, fractions A&#x02013;C, are further defined by expression of CD43 (B220<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>IgM<sup>&#x02212;</sup>CD43<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>) and differing expression of CD24 &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0010038-b13">13</xref>&#x0005d;. Fraction A is CD24<sup>&#x02212;</sup> and contains cells that first appear to be committed to the B cell lineage (pre-pro-B cells). Fractions B (early pro-B cells) and C (late pro-B cells) now express CD24 and initiate rearrangement at the IgH locus (B220<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>IgM<sup>&#x02212;</sup>CD43<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>CD24<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>). Compared to wild-type, <italic>pq/pq</italic> pre-B cells manifested a higher percentage of B220<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>IgM<sup>&#x02212;</sup>CD43<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> cells, indicative of a partial block in B cell development prior to the pre-B cell stage. This block was more apparent as the mice aged (compare day 28 to day 21, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0010038-g005">Figure 5</xref>B). Moreover, within the CD43<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> fraction, <italic>pq/pq</italic> pro-B cells expressed lower levels of CD24, demonstrating that this block occurred between the pre-proB and early pro-B cell stage. Similarly, in the spleen, reduced numbers of the most immature population of B cells (IgM<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>IgD<sup>&#x02212;</sup>) were observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0010038-g005">Figure 5</xref>C), arguing that there was reduced production of B cells in the bone marrow.</p></sec><sec id="s2e"><title>Pancreatic Diet Supplementation and BAC Transgene Rescues Immune System Defects</title><p>To determine whether the PI and subsequent malnourished state alone were contributing to the impaired immune system or whether there was an intrinsic defect in <italic>pq/pq</italic> lymphocytes due to the lack of SERPINI2, we sought to determine how the <italic>pq/pq</italic> mice would respond to dietetic supplementation with pancreatic enzymes in contrast to <italic>BAC&#x0002b;</italic>; <italic>pq/pq</italic> and <italic>pq/pq</italic> untreated animals. The pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy restored immune cell numbers in the <italic>pq/pq</italic> mice, suggesting immune system defects were secondary to malnutrition. Similarly, BAC&#x0002b;; <italic>pq/pq</italic> transgenic mice were also able to complement immune system defects. At 4 wk of age, enzyme supplementation resulted in a partial rescue, while animals with the BAC transgene were indistinguishable from wild-type animals with respect to cellularity of the spleen, thymus, and bone marrow and the numbers of mature T and B cells within the spleen (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0010038-g006">Figure 6</xref>A). Moreover, both the diet supplementation and the BAC transgene insertion complemented bone marrow differentiation defects. <italic>pq/pq</italic> mice with either pancreatic enzyme diet supplementation or the BAC transgene had an increased B220<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>IgM<sup>&#x02212;</sup> fraction and normalized development of IgM<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> immature B cells and the percentage of early progenitor B cells, as defined by CD43 and CD24, when compared to <italic>pq/pq</italic> animals without either enzyme supplementation or BAC transgene introduction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0010038-g006">Figure 6</xref>C).

Thus, the immune defects in <italic>pq/pq</italic> mice appear to be the in large part secondary to pancreatic exocrine deficiency, which leads to malnourishment caused by malabsorption.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Discussion</title><p>We have identified a mutant with PI caused by a deletion of the protease inhibitor <italic>Serpini2</italic>. This phenotype (peque&#x000f1;o) is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern and is to our knowledge the first published mouse mutant to genetically model PI. The mutation, caused by a transgene insertion, led to an approximately 210-kb genomic deletion that completely removes the <italic>Serpini2</italic> gene and a portion of the predicted gene E-62199.1/E-38943.1. Reintroduction of the <italic>Serpini2</italic> gene alone by BAC complementation corrected the acinar cell defect and improved immune function, demonstrating that deletion of the <italic>Serpini2</italic> gene is the primary genetic cause of the peque&#x000f1;o mouse phenotype.</p><p><italic>Serpini2</italic> was initially identified and implicated as a potential tumor suppressor gene because it was downregulated in pancreatic cancer cell lines when compared to normal pancreas &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0010038-b09">9</xref>&#x0005d;. <italic>Serpini2</italic> is also known as <italic>MEPI,</italic> a gene expressed in normal breast myoepithelial cells, but not in malignant breast carcinoma cells &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0010038-b14">14</xref>&#x0005d;.

Female <italic>pq/pq</italic> mice that had been maintained on a pancreatic enzyme diet supplementation were able to rear litters of 8&#x02013;10 pups with no difficulty. It is possible that loss of expression in mammary tissue does not affect mice mammary gland function. Alternatively, there is the potential that another serpin family member may be compensating for the loss of <italic>Serpini2</italic> activity, as has previously been observed for loss of <italic>Serpinb6</italic> function resulting in upregulation of <italic>Serpinb1</italic> expression &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0010038-b15">15</xref>&#x0005d;.</p><p>SERPINI2 is a member of the serpin superfamily of proteins that have been implicated in a variety of functions including blood coagulation, angiogenesis, inflammation, and programmed cell death &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0010038-b16">16</xref>&#x0005d;. In humans, 33 serpins have been identified &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0010038-b17">17</xref>&#x0005d;. These proteins are further subdivided into two classes, inhibitory and non-inhibitory. The former group, which includes SERPINI2, is characterized by conformational structure changes that allow for formation of covalent acyl-enzyme intermediates with the proteins' target protease, and thus have been termed &#x0201c;suicide substrates&#x0201d; &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0010038-b18">18</xref>&#x0005d;. The target substrates for SERPINI2 are unknown.</p><p>Further insight into the cellular location and function of SERPINI2 has come from work with the rat homolog, ZG-46p. SERPINI2/ZG-46p has been characterized in the pancreas, located predominately in the Golgi and in ZGs &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0010038-b19">19</xref>&#x0005d;, and was isolated from ZG membranes &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0010038-b20">20</xref>&#x0005d;. ZGs in the acinar cells contain inactive proenzyme precursors for digestive enzymes including trypsin, amylase, chymotrypsin, and carboxypeptidase. Normal acinar cells produce large quantities of granules that are transported from the trans-Golgi network to the luminal side of the acinar cell and are then secreted to the ductal lumen upon hormonal and neural signaling mechanisms. The contents of the ZGs are transported via ducts to the duodenum (pp. 429&#x02013;430 of &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0010038-b21">21</xref>&#x0005d;), where these enzymes are required for proper digestion and absorption of food.</p><p>Given the subcellular location of SERPINI2 in the Golgi and ZGs, in addition to the predicted gene function as a serine protease inhibitor, we hypothesize that SERPINI2 may play a role in regulating the level of inactive zymogen precursors. The importance of tight regulation of active protease levels by protease inhibitors in the exocrine pancreas is well documented. This regulation is demonstrated by considering mutations in two genes that are mutated in human hereditary pancreatitis: the cationic trypsinogen gene <italic>PRSS1</italic> and <italic>serine protease inhibitor Kazal type 1 (SPINK1)</italic>. For a small number of individuals with chronic PI, mutations in either gene have been shown to alter this balance and lead to autodigestion of tissue with inflammation &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0010038-b22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0010038-b23">23</xref>&#x0005d;. However, genetic animal models for these two genes are lacking.</p><p>It is also important to note that differences in the severity of pancreatitis may be regulated by the type of cellular response to the inflammation, whether apoptosis or necrosis. In several models of PI, acinar cell apoptosis causes a less severe pancreatitis phenotype &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0010038-b24">24</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0010038-b26">26</xref>&#x0005d;, in contrast to the more severe pancreatitis that has been documented with acinar cell necrosis &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0010038-b25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0010038-b27">27</xref>&#x0005d;. It is interesting to speculate that other less severe alleles than the null allele present in the <italic>peque&#x000f1;o</italic> mouse model may not have severe apoptosis and may demonstrate a pancreatitis phenotype similar to that observed in patients with <italic>SPINK1</italic> mutations.</p><p>Alternatively, SERPINI2 may function to allow proper sorting and/or transport of ZGs from the Golgi to the ductal lumen of the acinar cell. This hypothesis is consistent with the observations made of the acinar cells of 1-wk-old <italic>pq/pq</italic> mice that have yet to undergo apoptosis. In these acinar cells there is a dramatic loss of ZGs present in the cell and the ZGs appear smaller in size than those in wild-type and heterozygous littermates. Further analysis is required to differentiate these potential modes of action for SERPINI2.</p><p>It is clear that malnutrition is the primary cause of the observed <italic>peque&#x000f1;o</italic> phenotypes. The inability of <italic>pq/pq</italic> mice to adequately digest and absorb food from a young age adversely affects growth and immune system function. A large body of evidence argues that malnutrition, stress-induced hormones, and corticosteroids can adversely affect immune cell numbers and survival &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0010038-b28">28</xref>&#x0005d;.

Although the defects we observed here do not completely correlate with those associated with increased steroid exposure in mice, most studies of steroid exposure have examined short-term glucocorticoid exposure &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0010038-b30">30</xref>&#x0005d;.

Similar long-term studies have not examined B cell numbers or function. While we cannot rule out a direct effect of SERPINI2 on lymphocytes, the improvement of immune function by pancreatic diet supplementation strongly suggests that these defects are secondary to malnutrition, which could result in increased stress hormone and steroid production, decreased leptin levels, and/or a lack of nutrients.</p><p>It is interesting that growth retardation, PI, and immunodeficiency are present in both the <italic>peque&#x000f1;o</italic> mouse and the human disorder SDS.
