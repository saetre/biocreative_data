To express hHtt103Q and hAtx1-82Q, we used 2 different Gal4 drivers, gcm-Gal4 and repo-Gal4. Gcm-Gal4 is known to be a neuroglioblast/glioblast-specific driver whose effect is limited to development. Repo-Gal4 is known to be a pan-glial driver and the expression starts at glioblasts and continues after terminal differentiation. Gcm-Gal4-induced hHtt103Q was more toxic than repo-Gal4-induced hHtt103Q from the aspects of development, locomotive activity and survival of flies. When hAtx1-82Q was expressed by gcm- or repo-Gal4 driver, no fly became adult. Interestingly, the head and brain sizes were markedly reduced in a part of pupae expressing hAtx1-82Q under the control of gcm-Gal4, and these pupae showed extreme destruction of the brain structure. The other pupae expressing hAtx1-82Q also showed brain shrinkage and abnormal connections of neurons. These results suggested that expression of polyQ proteins in neuroglioblasts provided a remarkable effect on the developmental and adult brains, and that glial cell lineage expression of hAtx1-82Q was more toxic than that of hHtt103Q in our assays.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion/Significance</title><p>All these studies suggested that the non-cell autonomous effect of glial cells might be a common pathology shared by multiple neurodegenerative disorders.

The two pathologies might be generally shared in neurodegeneration.</p></sec></abstract><counts><page-count count="10"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Effects of glial expression of mutant proteins (or non-cell autonomous effects) on the pathology have been suggested in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and in spinocerebellar ataxia type 7 (SCA7). Primary mouse spinal motor neurons expressing mutant superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1) do not provoke motor neuron degeneration, whereas when motor neurons were generated from embryonic stem cells (ESCs), co-culture with primary glial cells from transgenic mice expressing mutant SOD1 induces neurodegenerative changes of co-cultured neurons <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004262-DiGiorgio1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004262-Nagai1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>. Furthermore, conditioned media by astrocytes but not fibroblasts, microglias, or cortical neurons induces cell death of motor neurons, suggesting soluble factor(s) mediate the non-cell autonomous effect. These effects <italic>in vitro</italic> were confirmed also <italic>in vivo</italic>. Selective Cre-mediated gene excision of mutant SOD1 in astrocytes improved the survival of SOD1 expressing mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004262-Yamanaka1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>, while mutant SOD1 expression in cell types other than motor neurons and oligodendrocytes seem to accelerate the onset of motor neuron disease phenotype <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004262-Yamanaka2">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>. Specifically in the case of mutant SOD1 transgenic mice, secreted mutant SOD1 protein from reactive astrocytes might be a mediator of the glial toxicity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004262-Urushitani1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>In polyglutamine (polyQ) diseases, the La Spada group reported that mutant ataxin-7 in Bergmann glias induces ataxia and neurodegeneration of Purkinje cells in mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004262-Custer1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>. The Orr group also reported that embryonic expression of human ataxin-1 (hAtx1), the causative gene product of SCA1, which interacts with retinoic acid orphan receptor alpha (ROR-&#x003b1;) and disturbs Purkinje cell development, affects the pathology in adulthood <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004262-Serra1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>. It indicates that the mutant gene expression and its interaction with mediator molecules during development are critical factors for the SCA1 pathology. All these studies suggested that the non-cell autonomous effect of glial cells might be a common pathology shared by multiple neurodegenerative disorders.</p><p>In this study, to test this hypothesis of non-cell autonomous effects by glial cells as well as by stem/progenitor cells, we generated and analyzed phenotypes of Drosophila models expressing human mutant Htt or Atx1 in the glial cell lineage at different stages of differentiation. In both cases, severe phenotypes are observed in development, locomotive activity and survival of flies. Morphological analyses of these flies revealed severe degeneration of neurons in the brain. These results further support the concept that glial cells expressing mutant proteins provides a non-cell autonomous effect on neurons. In addition, the fly models would be available for analyzing molecular pathologies and developing novel therapeutics against the non-cell autonomous polyQ pathology.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Generation of fly models expressing mutant polyQ proteins in glial cell lineage</title><p>We used two Gal4 drivers, <italic>repo-Gal4</italic> and <italic>gcm-Gal4</italic> to express polyglutamine proteins in glial lineage cells.

Glial cell lineage expression of mutant polyQ proteins by the two drivers evoked profound effects on development, survival, behavior and pathology. Although the severities and the patterns of pathological/behavioral changes were different, both mutant hHtt and hAtx1 induced remarkable outcomes either through stem/progenitor cell-specific or glial cell-specific expression. These results basically support the hypothesis that developmental and non-cell autonomous (glial) effects are shared in multiple neurodegenerative disorders.</p><p>Previously, two groups performed homologous studies. Kretzschmar and colleagues expressed ataxin-3 in Drosophila neurons and glias using APPL-Gal4 and M1B-Gal4 (a Gal4-insertion in the repo gene), respectively <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004262-Lievens1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>. They beautifully showed ataxin-3 aggregation in neurons and glial cells, as well as vacuolar changes of glial cells. The Birman's group analyzed effects of repo-Gal4-driven expression of Htt93Q on behaviors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004262-Kretzschmar1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>. They nicely showed life span decrease and locomotor defects. However, these analyses were limited to a single gene. Both studies did not employ two drivers conducting glial cell lineage expression at different developmental stages. Therefore, our study added novel insights to the polyQ pathologies, including developmental effects of mutant polyQ proteins expressed in glial cell lineage stem cells and distinct effects of huntingtin and ataxin-1.</p><p>Gilal cell-specific expression of mutant hHtt by the <italic>repo</italic> driver leads to the lifespan shortening and the abnormal motor activities (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004262-g002">Fig. 2A, B</xref>). Neurons, in addition to glial cells, were affected morphologically in those flies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004262-g003">Fig. 3B</xref>). Similarly, remarkable effects on neuronal functions and developmental defects, including neuronal loss in the retina and optic lobes, were induced by <italic>repo</italic>-driven exression of mutant hAtx1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004262-g006">Fig. 6B</xref>). Thus, expression of the two mutant polyQ proteins in glial cells definitely induces a kind of non-cell autonomous effect on neurons.</p><p>Meanwhile, <italic>gcm</italic>-driven expression of mutant proteins in stem/progenitor cells of glial cell lineage induced more profound effects. In the case of hHtt, <italic>gcm</italic>-driven expression, either in neuroglioblasts or gliobalsts, before L1 stage during development (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004262-g001">Fig. 1</xref>) permitted development to pupae and adult flies although the number of adult flies was reduced (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0004262-t001">Table 1</xref>). The adult flies survived developmental stress have short lifespan (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004262-g002">Fig. 2A</xref>), suggesting that impairment of stem/progenitor cells induces certain delayed effect(s) on the nervous tissue. Our result is consistent with the findings by the other group that hAtx1 interaction with ROR-&#x003b1; induced delayed effect in the model mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004262-Serra1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>The two disease genes driven by the same driver induced different effects. Mutant hAtx1 expression did not permit development to adult flies in either driver (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004262-g004">Fig. 4A</xref>). The severities of phenotypes by <italic>repo</italic> and <italic>gcm</italic> drivers were almost similar. On the other hand, mutant hHtt expression driven by <italic>repo</italic> and <italic>gcm</italic> drivers permitted development to adult flies. The survival of adult flies was shorter in <italic>gcm</italic>-driven expression than in <italic>repo</italic>-driven expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004262-g002">Fig. 2A</xref>).</p><p>The discrepancy in phenotypic severities between hHtt and hAtx1 might come from a higher conservation of Atx1 and its interacting molecules in Drosophila. Drosophila Htt is remarkably different from human Htt, while Atx1 possesses 44&#x00025; of homology in the AXH domain between Drosophila and human <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004262-Tsuda1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>. The AXH domain mediates neurotoxicity of hAtx1 through interaction with Gfi-1/Senseless, which is conserved in human and Drosophila <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004262-Tsuda1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>. Capicua, a critical interacting molecule to hAtx1 that mediates physiological functions of hAtx1 through binding to phosphorylated Ser776 proximal to the AXH domain <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004262-Lam1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004262-Lim1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>, is also highly conserved between human and Drosophila. Therefore, not only gain of abnormal function but also loss of physiological function might be conserved in Drosophila models similarly to human SCA1 pathology. Another possibility is that exon-1 of mutant hHtt was expressed in our flies. The partial molecule might be less toxic than the full-length hAtx1. On the other hand, as our fly models are expressing the partial molecule, loss of physiological function of hHtt <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004262-Busch1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref> is not highly plausible in our case.</p><p>Diversity in the phenotypes of the <italic>gcm</italic>-driven hAtx1 expressing flies is an open question. As the neuronal pathways are relatively preserved in the mild cases of <italic>gcm; hAtx1-82Q</italic> flies and survivors show relatively normal glial cells without mutant hAtx1, we might be able to assume that the stem/progenitor cell survival against mutant hAtx1 is stochastically regulated by a certain gene. As the ratio between severe and mild cases was nearly 1&#x02236;1, such a single gene might regulate the phenotype diversity in <italic>gcm; hAtx1-82Q</italic> flies. It would be interesting to identify the gene through genetic screening. Although we mainly analyzed adult flies in the case of mutant hHtt expression, the birth rate of the hHtt expressers with the <italic>gcm-Gal4</italic> driver was remarkably lower than that with the <italic>repo-Gal4</italic> driver (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0004262-t001">Table 1</xref>), suggesting that embryonic death also occurs in mutant hHtt expression. Identification of such a modifier gene might provide us some hints for therapeutics development.</p><p>In conclusion, our fly models expressing mutant hHtt and hAtx1 in glial cells or glial lineage stem/progenitor cells have extended the non-cell autonomous pathology hypothesis as well as the developmental effect hypothesis to multiple polyQ diseases. The two pathologies might be generally shared in neurodegeneration.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Fly stocks and rearing conditions</title><p>All flies were raised on a corn-meal medium without propionic acid and were maintained at 25&#x000b0;C and 60&#x00025; humidity under a 12&#x02236;12 hr light-dark cycle. pUAST-hHtt 103Q plasmid was generated by subcloning human <italic>HD</italic> exon 1 cDNA digested from pTL1HA3-HD90Q <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004262-Sittler1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref> with EcoRI and NotI, into pUAST vector.
