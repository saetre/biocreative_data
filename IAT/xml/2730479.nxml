Intracellular replication of <italic>Salmonella</italic> is mediated by bacterial effectors translocated on to the cytoplasmic face of the SCV membrane by a type III secretion system. Some of these effectors manipulate the host endocytic pathway, resulting in the formation in epithelial cells of tubules enriched in late endosomal markers, known as <italic>Salmonella</italic>-induced filaments (SIFs). However, much less is known about possible interference of <italic>Salmonella</italic> with the secretory pathway. Here, a small-interference RNA screen revealed that secretory carrier membrane proteins (SCAMPs) 2 and 3 contribute to the maintenance of SCVs in the Golgi region of HeLa cells. This is likely to reflect a function of SCAMPs in vacuolar membrane dynamics. Moreover, SCAMP3, which accumulates on the <italic>trans</italic>-Golgi network in uninfected cells, marked tubules induced by <italic>Salmonella</italic> effectors that overlapped with SIFs but which also comprised distinct tubules lacking late endosomal proteins. We propose that SCAMP3 tubules reflect a manipulation of specific post-Golgi trafficking that might allow <italic>Salmonella</italic> to acquire nutrients and membrane, or to control host immune responses.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Introduction</title><p><italic>Salmonella enterica</italic> serovar Typhimurium (<italic>S.</italic> Typhimurium) causes gastroenteritis in humans and is commonly used to study the molecular and cellular basis of <italic>Salmonella</italic> virulence. <italic>S. enterica</italic> invades and replicates within many host cell types. Intracellular bacteria multiply in a membrane-bounded compartment, the <italic>Salmonella</italic>-containing vacuole (SCV). Intravacuolar replication of <italic>Salmonella</italic> requires several virulence proteins, in particular those encoded by the <italic>Salmonella</italic> pathogenicity island (SPI)-2 type III secretion system (T3SS). The SPI-2 T3SS translocates over 20 effector proteins into the vacuolar membrane and host cell cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">Haraga <italic>et al</italic>., 2008</xref>).</p><p>Like other vacuolated pathogens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">Brumell and Scidmore, 2007</xref>), the capacity of <italic>Salmonella</italic> to survive and multiply intracellularly is dependent on interactions with host cell vesicular trafficking pathways. For years, <italic>Salmonella</italic> has been regarded as a paradigm of a pathogen that interacts selectively with the host endocytic system. Numerous studies using an epithelial cell infection model have described SCV maturation in terms of sequential interactions with the endocytic pathway and the physical displacement of bacterial vacuoles towards the microtubule-organizing center (MTOC) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">Steele-Mortimer, 2008</xref>). The mature SCV is enriched in late endocytic proteins, such as LAMP1, which accumulate on the vacuolar membrane during intracellular growth of the bacteria. In epithelial cells, a striking feature of the interaction between <italic>S.</italic> Typhimurium and late endocytic compartments is the appearance of long tubules, known as <italic>Salmonella</italic>-induced filaments (SIFs), which contain a variety of late endosomal markers, including lysosomal glycoproteins such as LAMPs, vacuolar vATPase (vATPase), Niemann-Pick C1 protein and lysobisphosphatidic acid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">Garcia-del Portillo <italic>et al</italic>., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">Drecktrah <italic>et al</italic>., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">Rajashekar <italic>et al</italic>., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">Steele-Mortimer, 2008</xref>). SIFs appear 4&#x02013;5 h after bacterial uptake, concomitant with the onset of bacterial replication and of SPI-2 activity, and several SPI-2 effectors are involved in their formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">Ramsden <italic>et al</italic>., 2007a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">Haraga <italic>et al</italic>., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">Steele-Mortimer, 2008</xref>).</p><p>In recent years, it has been suggested that SCVs might also interact with the host secretory pathway. This is because in epithelial cells the majority of vacuoles containing wild-type (wt) <italic>S.</italic> Typhimurium are maintained at the MTOC-Golgi region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34 b30">Salcedo and Holden, 2003, Ramsden <italic>et al</italic>., 2007b</xref>), and disruption of the Golgi network with brefeldin A (BFA) inhibits the intracellular growth of the bacteria in HeLa cells and in macrophages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">Salcedo and Holden, 2003</xref>). SCV positioning is dependent on the SPI-2 effectors SifA, SseF and SseG, and has been correlated with the intracellular replication of <italic>Salmonella</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">Salcedo and Holden, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">Boucrot <italic>et al</italic>., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">Abrahams <italic>et al</italic>., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">Deiwick <italic>et al</italic>., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">Ramsden <italic>et al</italic>., 2007b</xref>). In further support of the idea that SCVs might interact with the secretory pathway, experiments using the vesicular stomatitis virus glycoprotein (VSVG) or fluorescently labelled C5-ceramide indicated that transport from the Golgi to the plasma membrane is affected by SPI-2 effectors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">Kuhle <italic>et al</italic>., 2006</xref>). However, vesicles containing these markers did not appear to fuse significantly with SCVs or with SIFs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">Kuhle <italic>et al</italic>., 2006</xref>).</p><p><italic>Salmonella</italic> effectors might determine SCV positioning by controlling cytoskeleton-based motors, or by tethering of SCVs to Golgi-associated molecules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">Boucrot <italic>et al</italic>., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">Abrahams <italic>et al</italic>., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">Henry <italic>et al</italic>., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">Ramsden <italic>et al</italic>., 2007b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">Wasylnka <italic>et al</italic>., 2008</xref>), but the exact mechanism is unclear. To identify host cell protein(s) that regulate SCV positioning, we undertook a small-interference RNA (siRNA) screen of proteins with functions related to the secretory pathway. We found that depletion of secretory carrier membrane proteins (SCAMPs) 2 and 3 caused the scattering of SCVs throughout the cell, and this could be suppressed by inhibiting the microtubule centrifugal motor, kinesin-1. Further experiments revealed that SCAMP3, which mainly localizes to the <italic>trans</italic>-Golgi network (TGN) of uninfected cells, is a major component of the tubular network induced by SPI-2 effectors that includes SIFs and also novel <italic>Salmonella</italic>-induced tubules lacking late endosomal markers. This establishes that SIFs contain both endosomal and secretory pathway-derived molecules, and that SCVs interact with post-Golgi trafficking pathways. The work also highlights a function of SCAMP3 in the intracellular transport of membranes.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>SCAMPs 2 and 3 contribute to the positioning of SCVs in HeLa cells</title><p>A siRNA screen in HeLa cells suggested that SCAMPs might control positioning of SCVs in the Golgi region (data not shown).

SCAMPs 1&#x02013;4 are ubiquitously expressed in the vast majority of mammalian cells and SCAMP5 is mainly expressed in neuronal cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">Fernandez-Chacon and Sudhof, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">Singleton <italic>et al</italic>., 1997</xref>).</p><p>We analysed if SCAMPs 1&#x02013;4 influence positioning of SCVs. HeLa cells were individually transfected with either a non-targeting control siRNA or pools (SC1p, SC2p, SC3p, SC4p), each containing four different siRNAs for each SCAMP; these pools efficiently depleted the cellular levels of the SCAMPs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Fig. 1A</xref>). SCAMP-depleted cells were then infected with wt <italic>S.</italic> Typhimurium constitutively expressing the green fluorescent protein (GFP). The cells were fixed 14 h post invasion (p.i.), immunolabelled for the Golgi with an anti-giantin antibody, and analysed for the presence of a bacterial microcolony within the Golgi region (see <italic>Experimental procedures</italic>). Knock-down of SCAMP2 or SCAMP3, but not of SCAMP1 or SCAMP4, resulted in a significant decrease in the frequency with which SCVs became clustered and centrally located (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Fig. 1B and C</xref>). Next, we identified the single siRNAs within SC2p and SC3p that resulted in the more pronounced reduction in the cellular levels of SCAMPs 2 and 3 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1A</xref>). Depletion of SCAMP2 or SCAMP3 with these single siRNAs (SC2#1 and SC3#1) essentially recapitulated the effect observed using the pools of siRNAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Fig. 1</xref>), but the SCV positioning defect observed after knock-down of SCAMP2 was not statistically significant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Fig. 1C</xref>). However, we could further confirm that depletion of SCAMP2 or SCAMP3 affected SCV positioning by using additional single siRNAs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1</xref>). Depletion of SCAMP2 did not affect the cellular levels of SCAMP3, or vice-versa (data not shown).</p><fig id="fig01" position="float"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Depletion of SCAMPs affects SCV positioning.

Both SCAMPs, and in particular SCAMP3, colocalized extensively with a TGN marker, TGN46 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02">Fig. 2A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S3</xref>). No significant alteration in the cellular distribution of SCAMP2 was observed at 6, 8, 10 h, or at 14 h following infection by <italic>Salmonella</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02">Fig. 2A</xref> and data not shown). However, infection with wt <italic>S.</italic> Typhimurium caused the frequent appearance of distinct structures marked by SCAMP3 that often extended to the periphery of the cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02">Fig. 2</xref>). As SCAMPs are integral membrane proteins we concluded that these structures are tubules. SCAMP3 tubules were observed from 6 h p.i. and their frequency of appearance increased dramatically until 10 h p.i., but only slightly thereafter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02">Fig. 2B and C</xref>). The SCAMP3 tubules that appeared at 6&#x02013;8 h p.i. were typically thinner than those observed at later times (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02">Fig. 2B</xref>).

Therefore, SCAMP3-marked tubules that did not contain detectable levels of LAMP1, LAMP2, CD63 or vATPase could be readily identified in many infected cells at 14 h p.i. (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig03">Figs 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig04">4</xref>). Furthermore, SCAMP3 was also present in SIFs labelled with those late endocytic proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig03">Figs 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig04">4</xref>). SCAMP3 tubules could also be distinguished from LAMP1-labelled SIFs at 8, 10 and 12 h p.i. (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S4</xref>). However, at 8 and 10 h p.i. the majority of tubular SCAMP3 colocalized with LAMP1 on SIFs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S4</xref>). We refer to the <underline><italic>S</italic></underline><italic>almonella-</italic><underline>i</underline>nduced <underline>S</underline>CAMP3 <underline>t</underline>ubules lacking late endosomal markers as SISTs, and propose that tubules containing late endosomal markers with or without SCAMP3 continue to be referred to as SIFs.

A functional SPI-2 T3SS was essential for the appearance of SCAMP3 tubules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig07">Fig. 7A and B</xref>). We then investigated whether SPI-2 effectors involved in SIF formation and, more generally, in modulation of host cell membrane trafficking are required for SCAMP3 tubulation.

Because PipB2 binds the centrifugal microtubule motor kinesin-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">Henry <italic>et al</italic>., 2006</xref>), we determined if inhibition of kinesin-1 function would affect the formation of SCAMP3 tubules. HeLa cells were transfected with a DNA construct expressing GFP fused to the tetratricopeptide repeats (TPR) of the mouse kinesin light chain 2 (KLC2), a cargo-binding domain that, when overexpressed, has been shown to inhibit kinesin-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">Rietdorf <italic>et al</italic>., 2001</xref>), or with a plasmid expressing GFP alone.

These results indicate that SCAMP3 re-distributes from the SCV membrane into SCAMP3 tubules via kinesin-1 activity, and that other centrifugal motors are involved.</p><p>The results described above suggested that, in the absence of SCAMP3, kinesin-1-driven outward trafficking of tubules from the SCV might be impaired and this could result in a centrifugal force exerted on vacuoles containing wt bacteria, which could lead to their relocation to the periphery of infected cells. To test this hypothesis, we attempted to suppress the effect of the depletion of SCAMPs 2 and 3 on SCV positioning by inhibiting kinesin-1 function on the bacterial vacuoles. Overexpression of the TPR domain did suppress the SCV positioning phenotype displayed by cells depleted of SCAMPs 2 and 3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig08">Fig. 8D</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S7B</xref>), and SCVs containing <italic>pipB2</italic> mutant bacteria were more resistant than wt vacuoles to depletion of the SCAMPs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig08">Fig. 8E</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S7C</xref>).

In this work, we show that the dynamic tubular network extending from the SCV in epithelial-derived cells also includes SCAMP3 and is much more extensive than previously thought, in that a significant proportion of tubules lack endosomal markers and are enriched in SCAMP3 (SISTs). As a major portion of SCAMP3 accumulates on the TGN at steady state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">Castle and Castle, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02">Fig. 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S3</xref>) and SCAMP3 tubulation is severely inhibited in the presence of BFA, we conclude that the <italic>Salmonella</italic>-induced tubular network is not only of endosomal origin but also results from interactions between SPI-2 effectors and the TGN or associated post-Golgi compartments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig09">Fig. 9A</xref>).</p><fig id="fig09" position="float"><label>Fig. 9</label><caption><p>Model for the origins of SIFs/SISTs and for the function of SCAMP3 on the SCV. A. SPI-2 effectors mediate the formation of an extensive structures extending from the SCV that includes SIFs and SISTs in HeLa cells. SIFs were known to be decorated with proteins normally found in late endosomes (LEs), such as LAMP1, but the majority of SIFs also contains SCAMP3 (which concentrates on the TGN in uninfected cells). SISTs are marked by SCAMP3 and do not contain detectable levels of endosomal proteins. The appearance of SIFs with no SCAMP3 is rare. SPI-2 effectors, such as SseF, are present in both SIFs and SISTs. Therefore, SPI-2 effectors mediate the interaction between <italic>Salmonella</italic> and both the endocytic pathway and post-Golgi trafficking in HeLa cells, and this is reflected in the formation of SIFs and SISTs respectively. B. In the presence of SCAMP2 and SCAMP3 (control siRNA cells), PipB2-mediated kinesin-1 recruitment to sites of vesicle or tubule formation only occurs when a SCAMP-dependent microdomain allowing membrane fission and transport has been formed. In these conditions, SCVs remain essentially static while centrifugal transport of membranes occurs. SCAMP3 is constantly being incorporated into newly formed vesicles and tubules, resulting in the appearance of SCAMP3 tubules and eventually of SISTs. When SCAMPs are depleted (SC2+SC3 siRNA cells), the process of vesicle or tubule formation is affected such that kinesin-1 is recruited to sites of the vacuolar membrane that are not proficient for vesicle/tubule formation (spatial defect), or when such sites have not been formed yet (temporal defect). In these conditions, outward membrane trafficking still occurs, but the kinesin-1 centrifugal force is sensed by the SCVs, which then relocate from the Golgi region of the cell.

Vesicles containing VSVG (a marker of the constitutive secretory pathway) are re-directed by SPI-2 effectors to accumulate in the vicinity of SCVs, but no clear evidence of fusion was detected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">Kuhle <italic>et al</italic>., 2006</xref>). SCAMPs do not colocalize with VSVG-containing secretory vesicles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">Castle and Castle, 2005</xref>), and SCAMP3 can be clearly detected on SCVs in living cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig05">Fig. 5</xref>). Therefore, considered together, the data indicate that <italic>Salmonella</italic> specifically intercepts and recruits membrane from a TGN-derived SCAMP3-containing pathway. This could be explained by direct or indirect mechanisms: SCAMP3-containing vesicles might be directly recruited from the TGN, or <italic>Salmonella</italic> could first re-direct SCAMP3 vesicles to late endosomes and then recruit SCAMP3 while interacting with those compartments. In both scenarios, TGN-derived membranes could fuse with the vacuolar membrane and/or with SCV-derived tubules.</p><p>The simultaneous appearance in the same cells of SIFs containing SCAMP3, of SISTs and, more rarely, of SIFs with no detectable SCAMP3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig03">Figs 3, 4 and 5C</xref>, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S5</xref>) shows that <italic>Salmonella</italic> sorts and mixes different membrane components, resulting in the appearance of these different tubules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig09">Fig. 9A</xref>). It is noteworthy that SISTs are clear at 14 h p.i. but more difficult to detect at 8 h p.i. It is conceivable that over time, components of the secretory pathway within SIFs differentiate from endosomal tubules, resulting in the appearance of SISTs. It is also possible that SISTs might form independently at later time points. Therefore, it is unclear whether sorting occurs at the level of the SCV membrane or in tubules. In fixed cells, SISTs often appeared fragmented rather than as continuous tubules. This suggests that, as proposed for SIFs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">Drecktrah <italic>et al</italic>., 2008</xref>), they are not preserved intact following fixation. Another possibility is that SCAMP3 and LAMP1 cluster independently in tubules and these represent intermediates in the membrane sorting process. Understanding the physiological significance and the mechanisms by which <italic>Salmonella</italic> mediates host cell membrane sorting is a major challenge of future research.</p><p>Remarkably, SCAMP3 tubulation and SIF formation require the same repertoire of SPI-2 T3SS effectors: PipB2, SifA, SopD2, SseF and SseG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">Haraga <italic>et al</italic>., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig07">Fig. 7B</xref>). These effectors presumably comprise part of a common machinery underlying the process of SCV tubulation, regardless of the cellular origin of the membrane. Following its translocation across the SCV membrane, PipB2 binds directly to kinesin-1 and promotes its recruitment to the bacterial vacuoles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">Henry <italic>et al</italic>., 2006</xref>). However, because of the action of SifA, kinesin-1 does not appear to be present on SCVs containing wt bacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">Boucrot <italic>et al</italic>., 2005</xref>). SifA, anchored to the cytoplasmic face of the vacuolar membrane following isoprenoid modification of its C-terminus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">Boucrot <italic>et al</italic>., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">Reinicke <italic>et al</italic>., 2005</xref>), binds to the PH domain of its host cell target SKIP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">Boucrot <italic>et al</italic>., 2005</xref>), possibly displacing Rab9 in the process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">Jackson <italic>et al</italic>., 2008</xref>). SifA-SKIP is then proposed to redirect kinesin-1 to generate SIFs that emanate from the SCV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">Boucrot <italic>et al</italic>., 2005</xref>). Presumably this mechanism also underlies the formation of SCAMP3 tubules. However, inhibition of kinesin-1 only partially inhibits the formation of SCAMP3 tubules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig08">Fig. 8C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S7A</xref>), indicating that other, as yet unknown, centrifugal motor(s) must be involved. The molecular functions of SopD2, SseF and SseG are not understood.</p><p>Different studies indicate that SCAMP isoforms associate with trafficking stations and certain vesicular carriers in post-Golgi recycling pathways and in the cell surface recycling system, but not in the constitutive secretory pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">Castle and Castle, 2005</xref>). They are integral membrane proteins with cytoplasmic exposed N- and C- terminal regions; these might contain localization signals that determine their associations with specific pathways. Collectively, SCAMPs have been proposed to contribute to organizing membrane budding and fission sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">Castle and Castle, 2005</xref>). How then might SCAMPs 2 and 3 be involved in centrifugal trafficking of membranes from the SCV and be required for juxtanuclear positioning of bacterial vacuoles in HeLa cells SCAMPs 2 and 3 were not detected in coimmune precipitates with epitope-tagged versions of PipB2, SifA, SopD2, SseF or SseG, following the delivery of these effectors into the host cell by the SPI-2 T3SS (data not shown). Therefore, direct interaction with any of these SPI-2 effectors seems unlikely. Also, depletion of SCAMPs 2 and 3 did not noticeably affect the morphology of the Golgi network or the abundance of TGN proteins (data not shown). However, vesicle assembly must be synchronized with the recruitment of molecular motors driving transport on cytoskeletal tracks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">Hehnly and Stamnes, 2007</xref>), and as mentioned above SCAMPs might organize membrane microdomains in such a way that they become a platform for sorting and budding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">Castle and Castle, 2005</xref>). It is therefore conceivable that the action of SCAMP3 and SCAMP2 coordinates the formation of budding sites on the SCV with PipB2-mediated recruitment of kinesin-1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig09">Fig. 9B</xref>). In the absence of the SCAMPs, formation of these sites would be defective and the PipB2-kinesin-SifA-SKIP cascade could exert its effect directly on SCVs, leading to their peripheral relocation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig09">Fig. 9B</xref>). Depletion of SCAMPs 2 and 3 did not result in a noticeable accumulation of kinesin-1 on the SCV (data not shown), and did not inhibit SIF formation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S2</xref>). Therefore, in the absence of the SCAMPs, outward trafficking of membranes from the SCV still occurs and relocation of the bacterial vacuoles probably results from a more subtle effect of kinesin-1 on the SCV. This would be consistent with the model, in which SCV positioning is determined by a balanced activity of cytoskeleton-based motors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">Ramsden <italic>et al</italic>., 2007a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">Wasylnka <italic>et al</italic>., 2008</xref>). The positioning defect of SCVs in cells depleted of SCAMPs 2 and 3 was suppressed by inhibition of kinesin-1 activity, suggesting that these two SCAMPs might function together on SCVs. Although SCAMP2 was not detected on SISTs or SIFs, it might be present on the SCV membrane or associated tubules, but at low levels.</p><p>Previous studies indicated that the inability of SCVs to localize to the Golgi region correlates with a deficiency in the intracellular replication of <italic>S.</italic> Typhimurium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">Salcedo and Holden, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">Deiwick <italic>et al</italic>., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">Kuhle <italic>et al</italic>., 2006</xref>). However, depletion of SCAMPs 2 and 3 did not noticeably inhibit the intracellular replication of <italic>Salmonella</italic> (data not shown). Therefore, our data suggest that SCV localization to a juxtanuclear position is not essential for intracellular proliferation of <italic>Salmonella</italic>. Several intracellular pathogens have been shown to manipulate the host cell secretory pathway. Notably, <italic>Legionella pneumophila</italic>, <italic>Brucella</italic> spp., <italic>Toxoplasma gondii</italic> and several viruses interact with the endoplasmic reticulum to establish a protective and replicative niche and to manipulate host immune responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">Roy <italic>et al</italic>., 2006</xref>). Much less is known about the interaction between intracellular pathogens and post-Golgi trafficking. In addition to <italic>Salmonella</italic>, the only well-studied examples are <italic>Chlamydia trachomatis</italic> and <italic>Chlamydophila pneumoniae</italic>. Chlamydial vacuoles intercept a subset of Golgi-derived exocytic vesicles containing sphingomyelin and cholesterol, which are redirected to the chlamydial inclusion and are important for intracellular replication of the bacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">Valdivia, 2008</xref>). The physiological significance of SCV tubulation is unknown. Nevertheless, <italic>S.</italic> Typhimurium strains deficient for each effector involved in the formation of SIFs and SCAMP3 tubules are attenuated in virulence in a mouse model of typhoid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">Hensel <italic>et al</italic>., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">Beuz&#x000f3;n <italic>et al</italic>., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">Brumell <italic>et al</italic>., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">Knodler <italic>et al</italic>., 2003</xref>). Therefore, it seems likely that the molecular mechanisms underlying the formation of these tubules are important for <italic>Salmonella</italic> virulence. It is plausible that interactions between <italic>Salmonella</italic> and SCAMP3 membranes could satisfy membrane or nutritional requirements. Another intriguing possibility is that the displacement of TGN-derived membranes into SCAMP3 tubules reflects an interference with host immune responses that involve trafficking to the plasma membrane, such as antigen presentation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">Halici <italic>et al</italic>., 2008</xref>). Further work on the biogenesis and function of SCAMP3 tubules, and more specifically of SISTs, will improve our understanding of the intracellular biology of <italic>Salmonella.</italic> Furthermore, these studies may also help to shed light on the endogenous functions of SCAMPs, and their possible involvement in microtubule motor recruitment.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Experimental procedures</title><sec><title>Bacterial strains, plasmids and DNA oligonucleotides</title><p>This work was done using wt <italic>S.</italic> Typhimurium NCTC 12023 (identical to ATCC 14208s) and its isogenic mutant derivatives.

If no microcolony was detected, the cell was considered negative for Golgi association.

Only infected cells showing a centrally located microcolony with approximately 15&#x02013;25 fluorescent bacteria were considered. It was not possible to always fulfill this criterion when analysing cells infected with <italic>ssaV</italic> and <italic>sifA</italic> mutant <italic>S.</italic> Typhimurium, but cells infected with these bacteria did not show SCAMP3 tubules at all. We used LSCM to distinguish between SCAMP3-labelled tubules and LAMP1-marked SIFs, or between SCAMP3 tubules and SseF-HA tubules. Cells showing SCAMP3 tubules were first identified by looking in a channel that only allowed the visualization of SCAMP3 labelling; it was then evaluated whether the SCAMP3 tubules were distinct from SIFs or SseF-HA tubules. An infected cell was considered positive for the accumulation of SCAMP3 on the bacterial microcolony if all fluorescent bacteria within the microcolony appeared surrounded by SCAMP3 labelling.</p><p>At least 50 infected cells were scored blind in each experiment, and all experiments were repeated at least three times.
