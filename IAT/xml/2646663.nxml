Two forms of PurL have been characterized, large and small. Large PurL, present in most Gram-negative bacteria and eukaryotes, consists of a single polypeptide chain and contains three major domains: the N-terminal domain, the FGAM synthetase domain, and the glutaminase domain, with a putative ammonia channel located between the active sites of the latter two. Small PurL, present in Gram-positive bacteria and archaea, is structurally homologous to the FGAM synthetase domain of large PurL, and forms a complex with two additional gene products, PurQ and PurS. The structure of the PurS dimer is homologous with the N-terminal domain of large PurL, while PurQ, whose structure has not been reported, contains the glutaminase activity. In <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic>, the formation of the PurLQS complex is dependent on glutamine and ADP and has been demonstrated by size-exclusion chromatography. In this work, a structure of the PurLQS complex from <italic>Thermotoga maritima</italic> is described revealing a 2:1:1 stoichiometry of PurS:Q:L, respectively. The conformational changes observed in TmPurL upon complex formation elucidate the mechanism of metabolite-mediated recruitment of PurQ and PurS. The flexibility of the PurS dimer is proposed to play a role in the activation of the complex and the formation of the ammonia channel. A potential path for the ammonia channel is identified.</p></abstract><contract-sponsor>National Institutes of Health, United States</contract-sponsor><custom-meta-wrap><custom-meta><meta-name>document-id-old-9</meta-name><meta-value>bi800329p</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>document-id-new-14</meta-name><meta-value>bi-2008-00329p</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-wrap></article-meta></front><body><p>Since the structural characterization of tryptophan synthase twenty years ago, many examples of multidomain enzymes containing multiple active sites spatially separated from each other have been reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref>). According to the working hypothesis, this organization improves catalytic efficiency and enables channeling of unstable intermediates, and the active sites of such enzymes communicate and thereby affect each other&#x02019;s catalytic activity. An analogous strategy is thought to be utilized by macromolecular assemblies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref>). However, mechanisms by which these communications occur between either separate domains or proteins and characteristics of the channels within the multidomain enzymes or protein complexes remain to be fully characterized; additionally for macromolecular assemblies, the mechanisms of complex formation require investigation.</p><p>One group of enzymes with multiple spatially separated active sites are glutamine amidotransferases, which are responsible for various amination reactions where ammonia is generated in one active site and channeled to another containing the acceptor molecule (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref>). Formylglycinamide ribonucleotide amidotransferase (FGAR-AT<xref rid="fn3" ref-type="fn">1</xref>) is part of the purine biosynthetic pathway and catalyzes the synthesis of formyl glycinamidine ribonucleotide (FGAM) from FGAR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref>). FGAR-AT, also known by its gene product name PurL, utilizes an ATP molecule for the activation of the FGAR amide moiety producing ADP and phosphate. The ammonia source in the reaction is a glutamine, which is converted to a glutamate (Scheme <xref rid="sch1" ref-type="scheme">1</xref>). <fn id="fn3"><label>1</label><p>Abbreviations: FGAR, formylglycinamide ribonucleotide; FGAM, formylglycinamidine ribonucleotide; FGAR-AT, formylglycinamide ribonucleotide amidotransferase; Tm, <italic>Thermotoga maritima</italic>; Bs, <italic>Bacillus subtilis;</italic> St, <italic>Salmonella typhimurium;</italic> MWCO, molecular weight cutoff; HEPES, 4-(2-hydroxyethyl)-1-piperazineethanesulfonic acid; MPD, 2-methyl-2,4-pentanediol; TEV, tobacco etch virus; DDMP, difference distance matrix plot; rmsd, root-mean-square deviation; PEP, phosphoenol pyruvate; PK, pyruvate kinase.</p></fn></p><fig id="sch1" position="float"><label>Scheme 1</label><graphic xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="bi-2008-00329p_0002" id="gs1" position="float"/></fig><p>Two forms of PurL have been observed, known as large and small PurL. The large PurL is found in Gram-negative bacteria and eukaryotes. It consists of a single polypeptide chain 140 kDa in size. The structure of a large PurL from <italic>Salmonella typhimurium</italic> (StPurL) is known, and the domain organization of this protein has been described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref>). StPurL contains three major domains, the N-terminal domain, the FGAM synthetase domain, and the C-terminal glutaminase domain. The active site of the glutaminase domain is 45 &#x000c5; away from the FGAM synthetase domain, and like all amidotransferases, it is believed that an ammonia channel connects the two active sites. Two paths for the ammonia channel have been proposed based on the StPurL structure.</p><p>Small PurL, found in Gram-positive and archaeal organisms, consists of a 60&#x02212;80 kDa peptide chain, and is homologous to the FGAM synthetase domain of large PurL. Six structures of a small PurL from <italic>Thermotoga maritima</italic> have been described: that of the native enzyme (PDB entry <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="pdb" xlink:href="1VK3"/>) and in complex with FGAR (PDB entry <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="pdb" xlink:href="2HS3"/>), ATP (PDB entry <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="pdb" xlink:href="2HS0"/>), AMPPCP (PDB entry <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="pdb" xlink:href="2HRY"/>), ADP (PDB entry <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="pdb" xlink:href="2HRU"/>), and FGAR and AMPPCP together (PDB entry <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="pdb" xlink:href="2HS4"/>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref>). Small PurL requires two additional gene products, PurQ and PurS, for glutamine-dependent activity. PurQ, 25 kDa in size, whose structure has not yet been reported, is the glutaminase responsible for the generation of ammonia. PurS has a mass of 10 kDa, and four structures of PurS from different organisms are available (PDB entries <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="pdb" xlink:href="1TWJ"/>, <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="pdb" xlink:href="2CUW"/>, <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="pdb" xlink:href="1VQ3"/>, <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="pdb" xlink:href="1GTD"/>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref>). These structures reveal the structural homology of the PurS dimer to the N-terminal domain of StPurL; nevertheless, the function of this protein remains to be elucidated.</p><p>PurL, PurQ and PurS must form a complex in order to generate FGAM with glutamine; however, the overall quaternary structure of the proteins in the complex requires confirmation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref>). In <italic>Bacillus subtilis,</italic> it was found that ADP and glutamine are necessary for the complex formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref>). Both large and small PurLs have one active site and one auxiliary site related by 2-fold pseudosymmetry, and in large PurLs, exemplified by the StPurL structure, the auxiliary site contains a structural (Mg<sup>2+</sup>)<sub>3</sub>-ADP molecule (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref>). Consequently, it is the auxiliary site that is hypothesized to be important for the formation of the complex in small PurLs. However, the identity of the nucleotide binding in the auxiliary site and the mechanism by which it acts is unclear. In <italic>B. subtilis</italic> PurLQS, ADP was shown to be important, while the <italic>T. maritima</italic> PurL crystal structure contained a Mg<sup>2+</sup>-ATP molecule bound in the auxiliary site and TmPurL was shown to bind ATP in solution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref>).</p><p>While the mechanism of ammonia production in the glutaminase domain is well-understood based on studies of homologous enzymes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref>), less is known about FGAM synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">19</xref>). A sequential or a partially compulsory order mechanism for substrate binding has been reported for the FGAR-AT in various organisms, with Gln binding first followed by Mg-ATP and FGAR. However, the order by which the reaction proceeds or whether FGAR reacts with ATP or ammonia first is unclear, as is the order of product release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">19</xref>). The glutaminase activity has been shown to increase upon complex formation, yet the mechanism of this activation is unknown (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref>). The catalytic coupling between the active sites of PurQ and PurL as well as the role of PurS in this event requires further investigation. Although several structures of enzymes containing ammonia channels are known, no general properties for channels have yet been deduced based on these structures due to a large variability in their composition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref>). The characteristics of the channel in PurLQS and the role of PurS in its formation are yet to be described.</p><p>In order to further characterize the FGAR-AT system and investigate the nature of protein interactions in the complex, coupling between the two active sites, and the formation and composition of the ammonia channel, a crystallographic study of PurLQS from <italic>T. maritima</italic> was undertaken. Comparisons of the TmPurLQS complex with the uncomplexed TmPurL and TmPurS as well as the StPurL structure resulted in observations of protein movements, attributed to the complex formation. These observations allowed for the description of a possible mechanism of communication between proteins within the complex and favored one of the two previously proposed ammonia channels.</p><sec sec-type="methods" id="sec2"><title>Experimental Procedures</title><sec id="sec2.1"><title>Cloning of PurL, PurQ, and PurS from T. maritima</title><p>TmPurL and TmPurS genes were cloned by the Cornell Protein Characterization and Production Facility from genomic DNA using standard PCR procedures.

The first set of PCR products was used as template for another round of thermocycling with primers designed to add attB sites to the ends of the PCR products and insert a tobacco etch virus (TEV) protease recognition site at the N-terminus of the encoded protein. The resulting PCR products were purified and used in BP recombination reactions with the Invitrogen vector pDONR221 following the manufacturer&#x02019;s instructions. Correct clones were identified by PCR screening followed by sequencing. The correct clones were used in LR recombination reactions with the plasmid pDESTF1, which is a Gateway adapted vector based on the pET-system from Novagen.

The typical yield was 5 g of cells per 1 L of culture.</p><p>The three proteins were purified following the same procedure at 4 &#x000b0;C. The cell pellet (5 g) was resuspended in 30 mL of lysis buffer, 100 mM Na<sub>2</sub>HPO<sub>4</sub> (pH 8.0) and 300 mM NaCl. The cells were lysed via three passes through a French pressure cell press (SIM AMINCO Spectronic Instruments). The cell debris was removed via centrifugation at 35000<italic>g</italic> for 30 min. The cleared cell lysate was loaded at 1 mL/min onto a 2 mL Ni-NTA affinity agarose column (Qiagen) equilibrated with the lysis buffer. After the lysate was loaded, the column was washed with 100 mL of wash buffer, which consisted of the lysis buffer and 10 mM imidazole. The protein was eluted with an elution buffer, which was the lysis buffer with addition of 250 mM imidazole (pH 8.0). The protein elution was monitored by measuring protein concentration via Coomassie Plus Protein Assay Reagent (Pierce).</p><p>To remove the N-terminal polyhistidine tag, TmPurQ was incubated with thrombin, while TmPurS was incubated with TEV protease. The tag was not removed from TmPurL. Thrombin (10 U; BD Biosciences) was used per 1 mg of TmPurQ. The mixture was incubated in dialysis tubing (Pierce) with a 10 kDa molecular weight cutoff (MWCO) (Millipore) for 12 h at 4 &#x000b0;C in a buffer that was 50 mM Tris (pH 8.5), 300 mM NaCl, 2 mM dithiothreitol, 2 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 2 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, and 2% glycerol. The digestion of TmPurS in thrombin digestion buffer with TEV protease was also performed via dialysis at 4 &#x000b0;C for 36 h. TEV protease was provided by the Cornell Protein Production Facility.

After reconstitution of the tagged TmPurLQS complex, glutamine-dependent FGAM synthesis could be observed with a specific activity of 0.016 &#x003bc;mol/min/mg at 37 &#x000b0;C. The presence of protease recognition sites in the polyhistidine tags afforded the opportunity to remove the tags and prepare wild type TmPurQ and TmPurS, while the preparation of wild type TmPurL has been previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref>). After tag removal, the activity of the reconstituted, wild type TmPurLQS complex rose to 0.031 &#x003bc;mol/min/mg at 37 &#x000b0;C. This activity is substantially lower than that observed for either StPurL (4.4 &#x003bc;mol/min/mg) or <italic>B. subtilis</italic> PurLQS (BsPurLQS) (1.3 &#x003bc;mol/min/mg) under similar conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref26">26</xref>). In addition, this activity is lower than the NH<sub>3</sub>-dependent activity of TmPurL at 37 &#x000b0;C (0.3 &#x003bc;mol/min/mg) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref>). This suggests that the thermophilic complex may not be functioning optimally at 37 &#x000b0;C and a more detailed kinetic analysis is warranted at a physiologically relevant temperature.</p><p>Interestingly, if the assay buffer was depleted of ADP by the addition of PK/PEP, the activity of the reconstituted complex remained the same (0.038 &#x003bc;mol/min/mg). This suggests that if ADP is required for complex formation as observed for BsPurLQS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref>), ADP could be generated from ATP by TmPurLQS and/or the complex is more efficient at scavenging ADP than PK/PEP. Alternatively, ADP and ATP could be functionally equivalent for complex formation for TmPurLQS. These observations are noteworthy in light of the structural description of the TmPurL auxiliary site discussed below.</p><p>For crystallization, the tagged TmPurL was used; however, it was necessary to remove the tags from TmPurS and TmPurQ, as they interfered with crystal growth. Moreover, it was necessary to preform the complex in the presence of glutamine and ADP/ATP, followed by isolation via size-exclusion chromatography. The formation of the complex was evident from the TmPurLQS elution profile, which had a shorter retention time than TmPurL by itself. Based on a standard molecular mass calibration curve for the given column, the complex eluted at a volume consistent with an 80 kDa apparent molecular mass. Previous studies of PurS from various organisms have shown that this protein is unlikely to exist as a monomer eliminating the possibility of a 1:1:1 complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref>). Therefore our observation is indicative of a (2 TmPurS):(1 TmPurQ):(1 TmPurL) stoichiometry (predicted 109 kDa) and rules out a 4:2:2 complex (218 kDa, <xref rid="si1" ref-type="notes">Supplemental Figure 1, Supporting Information</xref>). Under these conditions, complex formation was not complete as evident from the elution chromatogram and SDS gel analysis. Isolation of the complex prior to crystallization to remove uncomplexed proteins proved essential to determination of the structure.</p></sec><sec id="sec3.2"><title>Quality Assessment of the Final Model</title><p>The final model contains three proteins complexed together, TmPurL, TmPurQ, and a dimer of TmPurS.

In the complex structure, the TmPurQ active site is occupied by a glutamyl thioester intermediate covalently bound to Cys86 (Figure <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>C). N4 of the His186 imidazole ring, most likely protonated, is positioned to transfer the proton to the Cys86 sulfur upon hydrolysis of the thioester moiety. In turn, the N2 of His186 forms a hydrogen bond with the side chain of Glu188. These three residues form the catalytic triad and are strictly conserved among all PurQs. Moreover, comparison with other triad glutaminases whose structures have been reported reveals structural conservation in the orientation and geometry as well as in the hydrogen bonding network of the triad residues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref28">28</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref30">30</xref>).

While structures at this resolution are often prone to large errors and possible misinterpretation, TmPurLQS represents a favorable case. The structures of TmPurL and TmPurS were available at higher resolution and many homologous triad glutaminase structures are available, thus making both the backbone and side chains of the initial model more reliable. In addition the asymmetric unit contains three complete complexes, allowing for NCS map averaging during model building and NCS restraints during refinement. The effect of tight NCS restraints are reflected in only a 4% difference in the <italic>R</italic>-factor and <italic>R</italic>-free. Finally, tight geometrical constraints were maintained throughout the refinement process. As a result the 3.5 &#x000c5; structure of TmPurLQS is accurate enough to infer hydrogen bonds for most regions of the structure.</p></sec><sec id="sec4.2"><title>Comparison of the Organization of the TmPurLQS Complex with StPurL</title><p>The protein organization in the TmPurLQS complex is very similar to the domain organization in StPurL. The overall root-mean-square deviation (rmsd) for the C&#x003b1; carbon backbone for the two structures is 2.8 &#x000c5;<sup>2</sup>. StPurL is larger than TmPurLQS with a surface area of 41,000 &#x000c5;<sup>2</sup>, compared to 34,300 &#x000c5;<sup>2</sup> for the complex. The domains of StPurL bury about 10% of the surface area of all three domains, while for TmPurLQS, 9% is buried. In StPurL, the FGAM synthetase domain forms larger interfaces with the glutaminase and the N-terminal domains, burying 4,700 &#x000c5;<sup>2</sup> and 1,900 &#x000c5;<sup>2</sup>, respectively, compared to 2,800 &#x000c5;<sup>2</sup> and 1,400 &#x000c5;<sup>2</sup> for TmPurLQS. However, the interface between the glutaminase domain and the N-terminal domain of StPurL buries 1,800 &#x000c5;<sup>2</sup>, which is comparable to the TmPurQ/S interface (2,000 &#x000c5;<sup>2</sup>).</p></sec><sec id="sec4.3"><title>Comparison of TmPurQ with the Glutaminase Domain of StPurL</title><p>The glutaminase domain of StPurL shares 35% sequence identity with TmPurQ.

The difference between the two structures consists of three alpha helices, &#x003b1;29, &#x003b1;31, &#x003b1;35, and two loops, present in the glutaminase domain of StPurL, and absent in TmPurQ. Of these structural elements, helix &#x003b1;31 is involved in the interaction with the FGAM synthetase domain.

The FGAM synthetase domain of StPurL is a highly decorated version of TmPurL, with the core remaining the same (Figure <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>C). The half of the molecule that includes the A1-B1 subdomains and the active site is more conserved structurally. The differences in this half are found in the A1 subdomain and include three elongated loops with pairs of &#x003b2;-strands: &#x003b2;6-&#x003b2;7, &#x003b2;9-&#x003b2;10, &#x003b2;14-&#x003b2;15.

A structural superposition of the uncomplexed TmPurS and the complexed TmPurS reveals no significant conformational changes, with an rmsd of 0.7 &#x000c5;<sup>2</sup>. In order to look for more subtle changes, a difference distance matrix plot (DDMP) was produced using the DDMP program (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref31">31</xref>) from the Center for Structural Biology at Yale University, New Haven, CT. This comparison reveals that there are two structural changes associated with the complexed PurS (Figure <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>A). First is a movement of a loop between &#x003b1;1 and &#x003b2;2 present in both monomers. Motion of up to 2 &#x000c5; is characteristic of this region and most pronounced for residues Asn35, Lys37, and Lys38. The hydrogen-bonding pattern remains the same as in the uncomplexed structure, with the bonds being slightly longer to account for the motion. The second movement is substantial only for monomer 2 of TmPurS, which interacts with TmPurQ. Two helices &#x003b1;1 and &#x003b1;2 form a more open conformation in this monomer; the residues within the helices shift further apart, with the distance between equivalent points increasing by 1.5&#x02212;1.7 &#x000c5;, and the overall angle being 5&#x000b0; more obtuse than in the uncomplexed structure. Although the helices are not part of the complex interface, the loops associated with both are part of the interface. Considering the low resolution of the complex, a cautious interpretation of the movement is that the complexed TmPurS is possibly less concave, as if adhering to the other two proteins to provide tighter interactions within the complex.</p><fig id="fig5" position="float"><label>Figure 5</label><caption><p>Conformational changes of TmPurS.

However, the dimer of TmPurS is structurally similar to this domain with an rmsd of 2.4 &#x000c5; (Figure <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>B). The N-terminal domain lacks one strand that corresponds to &#x003b2;3 of monomer 2 in TmPurS and adopts a less concave shape than TmPurS. Since the interactions between the domains in StPurL are more extensive than those between the proteins in TmPurLQS, the concavity of the PurS structure (or the N-terminal domain in large PurL) could well be related to the tightness of the interactions within the complex, with least concave being the tightest. This observation is consistent with the fact that the structure of TmPurS alone is the most concave of the three, as there are no domain interactions present. The concavity of the PurS dimer within the TmPurLQS complex, where the protein interfaces are weaker than for the corresponding domains of StPurL, falls between that of PurS alone and the PurS-like N-terminal domain of StPurL. Finally, StPurL has the tightest interfaces, and hence the least concave shape of the PurS-like N-terminal domains.</p><p>While no systematic movement of TmPurL and TmPurQ is observed upon the superposition of the complex with StPurL, TmPurS shows a change in orientation. TmPurS undergoes a rocking motion of 5&#x000b0;; helices &#x003b1;1 of monomer 2 and &#x003b1;2 of monomer 1 shift toward TmPurL, while &#x003b1;1 of monomer 1 and &#x003b1;2 monomer 2 shift away from TmPurL (Figure <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>C). This motion points to the flexibility of the complex and the ability of PurS to assume different orientations with respect to PurQ and PurL.</p></sec><sec id="sec4.6"><title>Motions of TmPurL, Active Site</title><p>TmPurL from the TmPurLQS complex was compared with the six published TmPurL structures. The superpositions with these structures reveal three loop regions with a difference in C&#x003b1; carbon positions greater than 5 &#x000c5;; two of these regions are located in the active site and the third in the auxiliary site (Figure <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>A). The flexible loop between &#x003b1;3 and &#x003b2;1 (residues 44&#x02212;60), which caps the nucleotide in the active site, shows large variation, as expected in the absence of the substrates. The loop between &#x003b1;7 and &#x003b1;8 of subdomain A2, residues 203&#x02212;209, is part of the region that becomes ordered upon FGAR binding. This loop moves closer to the active site in the FGAR bound structures with Gln208 forming a hydrogen bond to the formyl moiety of FGAR, while in the complex structure the loop is shifted away by approximately 3.5 &#x000c5; and forms interactions with TmPurS (Figure <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>B). In the complex, the carbonyl moiety of Thr203 from TmPurL is positioned to form a hydrogen bond with the side chain of Arg13 from TmPurS, and the carbonyl moiety of Lys204 from TmPurL is near the side chain of Asn15 from TmPurS. These two regions represent the largest deviation in the conformation of this loop. TmPurL structures with no FGAR or PurS bound also show a shift toward the active site; however the shift is approximately half the distance of that when FGAR is present.</p><fig id="fig6" position="float"><label>Figure 6</label><caption><p>Conformational changes in TmPurL.

This region forms a part of the auxiliary nucleotide binding site (Figure <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>A). Of all available TmPurL structures, the conformation of this loop in the TmPurLQS complex is most similar to the structure with an ATP molecule bound in the auxiliary site. The binding mode of the ATP molecule itself is almost identical to the ADP (or possible ATP) binding in the TmPurLQS complex. The similarity in the protein conformation is due to a shift involving residues 360&#x02212;366, observed in both structures upon nucleotide binding, which occurs to avoid steric clashes of the nucleotide with Ala366 (Figure <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>C). The rest of the loop is missing in the ATP-bound structure and adopts a more flattened conformation in structures with unoccupied auxiliary sites, exemplified by the TmPurL&#x02212;FGAR structure in Figure <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>C, while in the TmPurLQS complex this loop is more elongated. This motion is necessary in order to avoid close contacts with the TmPurQ loop between &#x003b2;5 and &#x003b2;6, residues 103&#x02212;116.</p><p>In TmPurL, a small helical segment consisting of residues 367&#x02212;373 is present in all structures and retains the same hydrogen-bonding pattern; however, its orientation is different. In the uncomplexed structures, the backbone carbonyl of Phe370 forms hydrogen bonds with Gln372, Tyr373, and His375; in the complexed structure, the hydrogen bonds with Tyr373 and Gln372 appear to be maintained, but not with His375. The shift in the helical fragment and the loop that follows is as large as 8 &#x000c5;, and the hydrogen-bonding network that follows Phe370 is completely different for complexed versus uncomplexed structures.</p><p>The main interactions that appear to be formed or broken at the PurL/Q interface upon the complex formation are listed. The main chain carbonyl of Glu371 appears to form a hydrogen bond with the amide of Asp374 in the uncomplexed TmPurL, and with the amide of Cys112 of TmPurQ in the complexed TmPurL structure. The hydroxyl of Tyr373 interacts with Asp116 in the unbound TmPurL, and with Asp107 in the bound TmPurL. The side chain of Asp374 does not have a hydrogen-bonding partner in the uncomplexed TmPurL, and appears to hydrogen bond to Arg189 of TmPurQ in the complex. This salt bridge is structurally conserved in StPurL. His375 interacts with Asn127 and Thr133 in unbound TmPurL, and with Tyr373 and Thr381 in the bound TmPurL. The carbonyl moiety of Thr379 in complexed TmPurL, which forms a hydrogen bond with the main chain amide of Arg393, is responsible for the shift of residues 390&#x02212;395, located in a loop, closer to the long linker region. None of the linker residues in the uncomplexed TmPurL interact with this loop. Starting with residue Val382, the loop adopts the same orientation in both structures, although the shift of 2 &#x000c5; is still present and slowly diminishes by residue 389.</p><p>The location of the long linker region, which is able to obtain multiple conformations, between the auxiliary site of PurL and the TmPurL/Q interface suggests the importance of the auxiliary site in the recruitment of PurQ in the complex formation. A likely scenario is that the binding of the nucleotide in the auxiliary site triggers and stabilizes the necessary conformation of the loop. Since the loop is in the center of the PurL/Q interface and makes up a third of the protein&#x02212;protein interactions, this conformation is likely crucial for recognition and docking of PurQ.</p><p>Comparison of TmPurLQS and StPurL structures reveals that the nucleotide in the auxiliary site is bound in a similar binding pocket maintaining a similar orientation in both (Figure <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>D). Unlike the uncomplexed TmPurL structures, in StPurL the loop corresponding to residues 360&#x02212;390 adopts the same conformation as that in the TmPurLQS complex, confirming the importance of this particular loop conformation for the complex formation. The &#x003b1;17 helix of StPurL has been proposed to be important for the communication between the subdomains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref>). While this helix is missing in the TmPurL structure, its C-terminus is located in the beginning of the long B1-A2 linker region, where some of the most significant conformational changes take place upon complex formation, supporting the possibility of its role in domain communication.</p><p>The auxiliary nucleotide in StPurL is bound very tightly and cannot be removed without denaturing the protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref>). One interesting question is how the nucleotide becomes inserted into the auxiliary site. The region corresponding to &#x003b1;17 is unlikely to be the entry point of the nucleotide to the auxiliary site due to its rigidity. The entry of the nucleotide is likely to be in the region related to the active site ATP by the pseudo 2-fold axis. In StPurL, this cavity entrance is blocked by a loop insertion of residues 668&#x02212;677, which interacts with helix &#x003b1;24 (&#x003b1;17 of TmPurL), and further blocked off by the glutaminase domain, making the nucleotide structural in StPurL and likely inserted during protein folding. In TmPurL, however, this helix is adjacent to and interacts intimately with the large flexible loop of 360&#x02212;390; thus, unless TmPurQ is bound to TmPurL, and the large loop is rigid, the nucleotide can easily diffuse in and out of the auxiliary site, supporting a mechanism where binding of the nucleotide in the auxiliary site triggers conformational changes in a large flexible region and is then followed by recruitment of TmPurQ.</p><p>While the secondary structure of the auxiliary site is conserved between TmPurL and StPurL, there is very little conservation in the primary structure. Of the 25 residues involved in the interaction with the nucleotide, four are structurally conserved: Glu425, Gly136, Ser549, and Arg139 (Glu718, Gly387, Ser886, Arg390 in StPurL). All but Gly136 are involved in coordination of the phosphate tail. The similarity between the two sites is mostly in the ribose being bound via main chain atoms and the hydrophobic pocket for the adenine base being conserved functionally. It remains unclear whether the auxiliary nucleotide binding in TmPurLQS complex has any additional function other than structural facilitation of complex formation via ordering of the 360&#x02212;390 loop region, and whether or not ATP and ADP are functionally equivalent for this purpose, given that the enzyme activity is not inhibited by the presence of PK/PEP, as was previously observed for BsPurLQS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="sec4.8"><title>Motions of TmPurL, Concerted Subdomain Movements</title><p>To observe more subtle differences in the TmPurL structures, DDMPs were produced and reveal the differences with a minimum of 1 &#x000c5; and a maximum of 5 &#x000c5; shift. Most similar to the complexed TmPurLQS structure is the TmPurL&#x02212;ATP/ATP structure (<xref rid="si1" ref-type="notes">Supplemental Figure 4A, Supporting Information</xref>). No significant systematic movement occurs within each of the four individual subdomains of TmPurL, except for small movements of the loop regions between &#x003b2;8 and &#x003b1;11 (subdomain B1) and between &#x003b2;15 and &#x003b2;16 (subdomain A2), probably due to general loop flexibility. Little change is also seen upon comparison with the TmPurL/ADP structure, suggesting that binding of the nucleotides in the active and auxiliary sites does not affect the overall subdomain conformation.</p><p>Unliganded TmPurL shows some variation when compared to the TmPurLSQ complex. While there are no significant shifts within the two halves of the molecule (A1 does not move with respect to B1, and A2 does not move with respect to B2), they show small systematic movement with respect to each other. A2 subdomain appears to shift away from the active site half of the molecule, while B2 appears to shift closer. These movements, which are not uniform and appear in patches of residues, become even more pronounced upon comparison with the two FGAR bound structures (<xref rid="si1" ref-type="notes">Supplemental Figure 4B</xref>). The patches mainly comprise loop regions, and there are three such patches in A2 and four in B2. Three of the regions are part of the TmPurL/Q interface. The linker between A2 and B2 (residues 502&#x02212;513), and the turn between &#x003b1;17 and &#x003b2;19 (residues 561&#x02212;566) from B2 subdomain move uniformly closer to the A1-B1 half of the molecule (Figure <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>E). Residues 110&#x02212;132 of A1, also part of the TmPurL/TmPurQ interface, shift uniformly closer to the B2 subdomain. In summary, the A1-B1 half of the molecule shows less movement than the A2-B2 half, with the tendency of the auxiliary cleft to become narrower upon FGAR binding.</p><p>These subtle subdomain shifts indicate the possibility of communication between the active and auxiliary sites. FGAR could act as the trigger for complex activation, securing PurS as described above and causing shifts in the auxiliary site as indicated by the subtle subdomain movements. The auxiliary site, which interacts with PurQ, would in turn propagate the signal to the PurQ/L interface, securing this part of the complex and triggering glutaminase activity.</p></sec><sec id="sec4.9"><title>Ammonia Channel</title><p>Two possibilities for an ammonia channel have been proposed for StPurL. Upon examination of the TmPurLQS complex structure, similar possibilities are revealed (Figure <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>A); however, only one channel shows a high degree of conservation. For both channels, ammonia would leave the TmPurQ active site at the same exit point that consists of the two phenylalanines, 51 and 110. Ammonia could then pass through to either side of helices &#x003b1;5 and &#x003b1;6 of subdomain A1.

Channel B on the other hand contains structurally conserved residues: Gly54, Glu55 from TmPurQ, and Ala85, Thr86, Gly87, Gly89, Gly90, Pro212, and Gln282 from TmPurL. Moreover, all of these residues except Ala85 are strictly conserved based on the sequence alignments of large and small PurLs. The substitutions that are found in this channel are either conservative, such as Tyr125 changed to a Phe in StPurL, or for a less bulky residue, such as Gly210 changed to an Asp in StPurL. While Tyr125 or Phe are strictly conserved among all PurL sequences, this is not the case for Gly210. This residue is conserved among small PurLs, but Asp found in StPurL is not conserved among large PurLs. The location of channel B at the interface of the three proteins, and near the regulatory loop, 200&#x02212;210, as well as its structural conservation, all suggest that this is the more likely path for the ammonia.</p></sec><sec id="sec4.10"><title>Summary of the Mechanistic Implications for the Complex Formation</title><p>From the comparisons presented above, the following mechanism for the complex formation and catalytic activation can be envisioned. The PurL structure is flexible, with conformational changes observed on various levels, subtle shifts in subdomains, and large movements in secondary structural elements. Both the active and the auxiliary site cavities appear to play a role in the complex assembly. The loop of the empty active site recruits PurS by swinging out into the solvent, while binding of a nucleotide in the auxiliary site makes the docking of PurQ possible. Even though a crystal structure of isolated PurQ in the absence of glutamine has not yet been obtained, it is likely, based on our observations by size-exclusion chromatography in both BsPurLQS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref>) and TmPurLQS, that a PurQ&#x02212;glutamine or PurQ&#x02212;glutamylthioester complex is important for this docking interaction. Catalytic activation of the complex occurs during FGAR binding. It secures and possibly activates PurQ by triggering the narrowing of the auxiliary cleft with a bound nucleotide, and pulls PurS closer over the active site via ordering of the remainder of the active site loop. The rocking and bending motions observed for TmPurS show that it contains the flexibility necessary for such facilitation of the PurL&#x02212;PurQ interactions. The proposed ammonia channel is located at the interface of the TmPurL active site loop and TmPurS. Hence, PurS could also facilitate the formation of the ammonia channel in the presence of FGAR and the coupling of catalysis between the two active sites. While the purpose of this mechanism is to propose a possible course of events in protein&#x02212;protein interactions and complex formation on atomic level, further studies are necessary for its confirmation.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgement</title><p>We thank Leslie Kinsland for assistance in the preparation of the manuscript.
