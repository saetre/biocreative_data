It consists of the <underline>c</underline>almodulin binding peptide, six <underline>h</underline>istidine residues, and three copies of the <underline>h</underline>emagglutinin epitope. This &#x02018;CHH&#x02019; MAFT tag allows two or three consecutive purification steps, giving high purity. Active Clb2&#x02013;Cdc28 kinase complex was purified from yeast cells after inserting the CHH tag into Clb2. Associated proteins were identified using mass spectrometry.

This in turn means that the members of protein complexes can be identified by mass spectrometry even when only very tiny amounts of the complex are available. The rate-limiting step is generally purification of the complex. Often, one or more member proteins of a complex are known, and the problem is to identify the associated proteins. In such cases it is sometimes possible to attach an affinity tag to the known protein and use this tag to purify the complex.</p><p> Use of affinity tags has several advantages over classical purification procedures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gne024c1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gne024c6">6</xref>). A well-chosen tag can allow a very high degree of purification in a single step, often using mild conditions that preserve the complex and its biological activity. Perhaps even more importantly, the conditions for purification are generally more dependent on the affinity tag than on the protein to which it is attached. Thus, purification methods can be standardized, allowing many different proteins or complexes to be purified by essentially identical methods. In this way, high throughput can be achieved.</p><p> However, no single tag allows purification to homogeneity. To circumvent this problem, Rigaut <italic>et al</italic>. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gne024c7">7</xref>) recently developed the &#x02018;tandem affinity purification&#x02019; tag, or TAP tag, containing the calmodulin binding peptide (CBP) and the IgG binding domains of protein A. The inclusion of two affinity tags allows two consecutive affinity purification steps, thus achieving much higher purification than could be achieved by a single tag. We have independently developed the same idea. In our case, the tag contains (i) the calmodulin binding peptide for purification on calmodulin resin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gne024c8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gne024c9">9</xref>); (ii) six consecutive histidine residues (6&#x000d7; His) for purification on nickel resin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gne024c10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gne024c11">11</xref>); and (iii) three copies of hemagglutinin (3&#x000d7; HA) tag for immunoprecipitation with commercially available monoclonal antibody 12CA5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gne024c12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gne024c13">13</xref>). Since the basis of each purification is different, the final degree of purification may be very high. We call this general strategy &#x02018;multiple affinity purification&#x02019;, or MAFT, and this particular version of a MAFT tag we have named the CHH tag (<underline>c</underline>almodulin, <underline>h</underline>istidine, <underline>h</underline>emagglutinin).</p><p> We have developed two versions of CHH cassette, pSH6 and pSH26. pSH6 contains CHH tag on a <italic>Not</italic>I fragment that can be inserted at the C- or N-terminus of any protein. Another CHH cassette, pSH26, contains the <italic>URA3</italic> gene flanked by direct repeats of CHH tags. This allows a CHH tag to be inserted into any yeast gene of interest with the help of PCR and <italic>in vivo</italic> recombination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gne024c14">14</xref>).</p><p> Here we demonstrate the use of the CHH tag to purify the Clb2&#x02013;Cdc28 protein kinase complex from <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>. Two consecutive steps of affinity purification produced an extremely pure preparation of Clb2&#x02013;Cdc28 protein kinase complex with associated proteins. The kinase was highly active. The associated proteins could be identified by mass spectrometry.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Construction of the CHH (CBP-HIS6-HA3) tag</title><p>Oligonucleotides and plasmids used are listed in Tables <xref ref-type="table" rid="gne024tb1">1</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="gne024tb2">2</xref>. The CHH MAFT tag was generated by using crossover PCR to combine two independent PCR products: CBP-HIS6 and HIS6-HA3. Oligonucleotides PrS2 and PrS3 were designed to amplify the CBP-HIS6 domain of the pSH2 plasmid generating a 152 bp fragment. To generate HIS6-HA3, a triple HA epitope in plasmid pSH4 was amplified using oligonucleotides PrS1 and PrS4, generating a 209 bp fragment. The PCR fragments generated above had 119 bp of overlapping sequence, so crossover PCR was used to generate the CHH MAFT tag by mixing the gel purified 152 and 209 bp PCR fragments with oligonucleotides PrS1 and PrS4, followed by amplification. The resulting 242 bp band was gel-purified, quantified, cloned (see below) and sequenced in its entirety. The structure and sequence of the CHH tag is shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gne024f1">1</xref>.</p></sec><sec><title>Construction of GAL-CLB2-CHH and GAL-CDC28K40R (pSH16)</title><p>Plasmid pSH6 (GAL-CLB2-CBP-HIS6-HA3) was constructed starting with pSH4 (pGAL-CLB2) which contains a <italic>Not</italic>I site in the appropriate reading frame just before the stop codon of <italic>CLB2</italic>. pSH4 was digested with <italic>Not</italic>I, and mixed with the purified 242 bp PCR product containing the CHH tag (see above), which had likewise been digested with <italic>Not</italic>I. Ligation generated plasmid pSH6 (GAL-CLB2-CBP-HIS6-HA3). Because a <italic>Bgl</italic>II site had been engineered into oligonucleotide PrS4, the orientation of the insert was determined by digestion with <italic>Bgl</italic>II. Subsequently, the entire CHH tag was sequenced.</p><p> Plasmid pSH16 (GAL-CDC28 K40R) was constructed by using three plasmids; pSH13 (pGBDU2CDC28K40R), pSH14 (YEP213-CDC28) and pMR438. Oligonucleotide PrS11, consisting of a <italic>Bam</italic>HI site and 24 bases of CDC28 starting from the ATG, was designed to amplify the 5&#x02032;-region of CDC28K40R on plasmid pSH13 (previously cut with <italic>Eco</italic>RI and <italic>Pst</italic>I) using one-sided PCR. The 3&#x02032;-region of CDC28, including its transcription terminator, was amplified by performing one-sided PCR on <italic>Hin</italic>dIII, <italic>Xba</italic>I-cut pSH14 using oligonucleotide PrS10. One-sided PCR products generated above had overlapping sequences, and crossover PCR was done by mixing both PCR products and oligonucleotides PrS10 and PrS11, to generate a CDC28 K40R construct flanked by <italic>Bam</italic>HI sites. The resulting 1.3 kb PCR product was gel-purified, quantified, digested with <italic>Bam</italic>HI and cloned into the <italic>Bam</italic>HI site of pMR438 to generate pSH16 (GAL-CDC28-K40R). The orientation of CDC28-K40R was determined by sequencing the entire CDC28-K40R fragment using PrS9 and PrS10 oligonucleotides.</p></sec><sec><title>Construction of pSH26</title><p>To generate a vector for PCR epitope tagging of genes in yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gne024c14">14</xref>), we cloned the CHH tag on either side of the <italic>URA3</italic> marker in a yeast integrating vector. Oligonucleotides PrS2 and PrS7 were used to amplify a 261 bp fragment containing the CHH tag on plasmid pSH6. This PCR fragment was cut with <italic>Sac</italic>I and <italic>Spe</italic>I and ligated to a similarly-cut pSH22 plasmid. Subsequently, the plasmid generated from this ligation, pSH23 was cut with <italic>Eco</italic>RI and <italic>Xho</italic>I and ligated to a similarly-cut PCR fragment generated above to create plasmid pSH26. Finally, both of the cloned CHH tags were sequenced using oligonucleotides PrS5 and PrS6.</p></sec><sec><title>Strains and culture conditions</title><p>Yeast strains YSH16 (untagged GAL-CLB2; WT CDC28), YSH19 (GAL-CLB2-CHH; WT CDC28) and YSH24 (GAL-CLB2-CHH CDC28 GAL-cdc28-K40R) used in this study were prepared by transforming plasmids (pSH5, pSH6 and pSH6&#x0002b;pSH16, respectively) into a <italic>S.cerevisiae</italic> diploid strain W303 (<italic>MAT</italic>a&#x0002f;<italic>MAT</italic>&#x003b1;), which is homozygous for <italic>ade2-1 trp1-1 leu2-3,112 his3-11,15 ura3-1 can1-100</italic> and is &#x0005b;<italic>psi</italic><italic><sup>&#x0002b;</sup></italic>&#x0005d; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gne024c15">15</xref>). CLB2 (tagged or untagged) and kinase-dead cdc28-K40R were expressed from the GAL promoter. Standard conditions were used for culturing and manipulating yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gne024c16">16</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Affinity chromatography and immunoprecipitation</title><p>Yeast were grown in YEP (yeast extract peptone) media containing 2&#x00025; raffinose w&#x0002f;v as carbon source, at 30&#x000b0;C to 2.0 &#x000d7; 10<sup>7</sup> cells&#x0002f;ml. Galactose (1&#x00025; final) was added to each culture and cells were grown for an additional 90 min. Cells were harvested by centrifugation at 4&#x000b0;C, washed in ice-cold water, and resuspended in a volume of lysis buffer (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="gne024tb3">3</xref>) equal to the volume of the cell pellet. Cells were lysed at 4&#x000b0;C with acid-washed glass beads and a Mini Bead-beater (Biospec Products). Resulting cell extracts were centrifuged at 14 000 r.p.m. in a microcentrifuge at 4&#x000b0;C. Protein concentrations, as determined by the Bradford assay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gne024c17">17</xref>), ranged from 3.0 to 6.5 mg&#x0002f;ml. Prior to use, calmodulin affinity resin (Stratagene) or Ni-NTA resin (Qiagen) was washed four times with six bed-volumes of lysis buffer (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="gne024tb3">3</xref>). Between washes, resin was collected using a 2 min centrifugation at 1000 r.p.m. at 4&#x000b0;C. Protein extract with protein concentrations ranging from 3.0 to 6.0 mg&#x0002f;ml was mixed with one-twentieth volume of pre-equilibrated affinity resin (see above). (For example, from 6 l of culture, we typically obtained 20 ml of extract with a protein concentration of &#x0223c;4.5 mg&#x0002f;ml, which was then mixed with 1 ml of resin.) The suspension was rocked at 4&#x000b0;C for 2 h. Unbound material was then removed by washing the affinity resin four times with a volume of lysis buffer (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="gne024tb3">3</xref>) equal to six bed-volumes of the resin, with pulse-spins between each wash followed by the removal of the supernatant. This unbound material is referred to as &#x02018;flow-through&#x02019;. Proteins were eluted from the affinity resin by eluting six times, each time with two bed-volumes of elution buffer (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="gne024tb3">3</xref>), containing 2 mM EGTA (for calmodulin resin) or 250 mM imidazole (for Ni-NTA resin). (For example, for a 6 l culture, 1 ml of resin was eluted six times, with 2 ml each time, yielding a total of 12 ml.) Eluted fractions containing partially purified Clb2&#x02013;Cdc28 complex were pooled, and passed through an empty Bio-Spin chromatography column (Bio-Rad) to filter out residual resin beads. This filtered eluate was subjected to immunoprecipitation, for which we used monoclonal antibody 12CA5 covalently coupled to Immunopure protein A&#x02013;Sepharose beads (Pierce) (see below). Typically, immunoprecipitation was carried out by mixing 10 ml of partially purified Clb2&#x02013;Cdc28 complex from the affinity resin with 100 &#x000b5;l of protein A&#x02013;Sepharose beads crosslinked to 12CA5. The suspension was rocked at 4&#x000b0;C for 2 h. Precipitated immune complex was washed four times with cold immunoprecipitation buffer (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="gne024tb3">3</xref>). Resulting immunocomplexes containing purified Clb2&#x02013;Cdc28 complex on protein A beads were stored at &#x02013;70&#x000b0;C.</p></sec><sec><title>Crosslinking of 12CA5 monoclonal antibody to protein A&#x02013;Sepharose beads</title><p>Crosslinking was adapted from the method described by Harlow and Lane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gne024c18">18</xref>). One milliliter of immunopure protein A&#x02013;Sepharose beads (50&#x00025; slurry) was washed three times in PBS (136 mM NaCl, 2.7 mM KCl, 10 mM Na<sub>2</sub>HPO<sub>4</sub>, 2 mM KH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub> pH 7.4), then resuspended in 10 ml PBS. To this, 1 ml (6&#x02013;10 mg protein) of ascites fluid from the 12CA5 cell line was added, and the suspension was incubated at room temperature for 1 h with gentle rocking. A percentage of the suspension (0.1&#x00025;, 11 &#x000b5;l) was saved for later analysis. Beads were harvested by gentle centrifugation (3000 <italic>g</italic>, 5 min), and 11 &#x000b5;l of the supernatant was saved for later analysis. Beads were washed twice with 5 ml (10 vol) of 0.2 M sodium borate pH 9. Washed beads were resuspended in 5 ml (10 vol) of 0.2 M sodium borate pH 9, and 0.1&#x00025; (5.5 &#x000b5;l) of the suspension was saved for later analysis. The monoclonal antibody bound to the protein A beads was then covalently coupled to the beads by the addition of the crosslinking agent dimethyl suberimidate (DMS) to a final concentration of 20 mM. The suspension was incubated for 30 min at room temperature with gentle rocking. A percentage of the suspension (0.1&#x00025;, 5.5 &#x000b5;l) was saved for later analysis. The crosslinking reaction was quenched by washing the beads once with 5 ml of 0.2 M ethanolamine pH 8, and then incubating for 2 h at room temperature in 5 ml of 0.2&#x000a0;M ethanolamine pH 8, with gentle mixing. Beads were washed in PBS, and finally resuspended in 0.5 ml of PBS with 0.01&#x00025; merthiolate to preserve sterility.</p><p> To check the efficiency of antibody binding and coupling, the volume of each fraction was adjusted to 12 ml with PBS, an equal volume of 2&#x000d7; sample buffer was added, and then samples were boiled for 2 min and loaded on an SDS&#x02013;10&#x00025; polyacrylamide gel. Samples before crosslinking showed abundant free IgG, while the sample after crosslinking showed little or no free IgG.</p></sec><sec><title>Protein kinase assay using synthetic peptides</title><p>Protein kinase activity was assayed by incorporation of &#x0005b;&#x003b3;-<sup>32</sup>P&#x0005d;ATP in a synthetic peptide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gne024c19">19</xref>). The experimental 14 amino acid synthetic peptide (RRRAQNATPNKAAG) used in this study had one consensus Cdc28 phosphorylation site (TPNK), while the control peptide (RRRAQNAAPNKAAG) was identical except for the substitution of alanine for the phosphorylatable threonine at position 8. A typical kinase reaction mixture, in a total volume of 20 &#x000b5;l, contained 2&#x000d7; kinase reaction buffer (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="gne024tb3">3</xref>), 1 &#x000b5;Ci &#x0005b;&#x003b3;-<sup>32</sup>P&#x0005d;ATP, 5 &#x000b5;M ATP, 0.5 mg&#x0002f;ml BSA, 1.5&#x000a0;mM experimental or control peptide and the protein kinase. The reaction was carried out by incubating the contents at 30&#x000b0;C for 15 min. Aliquots (15 &#x000b5;l) of supernatant from each kinase reaction sample was pipetted onto 2 cm squares of P81 Whatman paper. The squares were dried at room temperature for 10 min, then washed three times with 75 mM orthophosphoric acid to remove any unbound &#x0005b;&#x003b3;-<sup>32</sup>P&#x0005d;ATP. Squares were dried at room temperature and counted for radioactivity in scintillation vials containing 10 ml organic scintillation fluid using an LKB 1209 Rackbeta Liquid Scintillation Counter.</p></sec><sec><title>Immunoblot analysis</title><p>Immunoblot analysis was carried out as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gne024c20">20</xref>). Samples containing Clb2&#x02013;Cdc28 complex were mixed with an equal volume of 2&#x000d7; protein sample buffer for SDS&#x02013;PAGE. Samples were heated to boiling for 2 min then loaded on 10&#x00025; SDS&#x02013;polyacrylamide gels. Proteins were transferred to Hybond<sup>TM</sup> ECL<sup>TM</sup> (Amersham) membrane using a semi-dry transfer apparatus. Proteins were visualized by staining with Ponceau S (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gne024c18">18</xref>). The membrane blot was blocked using 5&#x00025; non-fat dry milk in a buffer containing 20 mM Tris&#x02013;HCl pH&#x000a0;7.5, 150 mM NaCl and 0.1&#x00025; Tween-20. For detection of proteins tagged with 3&#x000d7; HA, blots were incubated with 12CA5 monoclonal antibody ascites fluid at a dilution of 1&#x0002f;5000 followed by secondary HRP-conjugated anti-mouse antibody (Amersham) at a dilution of 1&#x0002f;10 000. For detection of Cdc28, a rabbit polyclonal generated against the N-terminal 12 amino acids of Cdc28 was used (B.Futcher, unpublished results). For detection of Sic1, a rabbit polyclonal antibody generated against full-length recombinant Sic1 was used (M.Tyers, personal communication). HRP-linked donkey anti-rabbit antibody (Amersham) was used as a secondary antibody at a dilution of 1&#x0002f;10 000 for the detection of Cdc28 and Sic1. An enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) detection system (Amersham) was used for protein visualization according to the manufacturer&#x02019;s instructions.</p></sec><sec><title>Tandem mass spectrometry</title><p>For the identification of proteins associated with the tandem affinity purified Clb2&#x02013;Cdc28 complex, samples were prepared from a 12 l culture of yeast, and Clb2&#x02013;Cdc28 was purified using a calmodulin resin followed by immunoprecipitation with 12CA5 as described above. Proteins were separated by 10&#x00025; SDS&#x02013;PAGE and visualized by silver staining (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gne024c21">21</xref>). Silver-stained bands were excised and in-gel digested with trypsin following the procedure of Shevchenko <italic>et al</italic>. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gne024c22">22</xref>).

First, they each allow reasonable purification in good yield of tagged proteins. Second, elution of tagged proteins from the affinity resin occurs under mild conditions, which would allow many protein complexes to remain intact. Third, they are both relatively small, which makes them easier to work with at the DNA level, and may lessen their impact on the function of the tagged protein. In addition, we chose the 3&#x000d7; HA peptide because it is an excellent epitope tag: the 12CA5 monoclonal antibody recognizes it with high affinity and avidity; it works well in both western blotting and immunoprecipitation; and 12CA5 and other antibodies recognizing 3&#x000d7;&#x000a0;HA are commercially available.</p></sec><sec><title>Tagging of Clb2</title><p>We chose to test the CHH tag using the non-abundant yeast mitotic cyclin Clb2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gne024c24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gne024c25">25</xref>). Clb2 forms a complex with and activates the cyclin-dependent kinase Cdc28 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gne024c26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gne024c27">27</xref>). The Clb2&#x02013;Cdc28 protein kinase activity can be assayed <italic>in vitro </italic>using a variety of substrates, which typically bear the consensus phosphorylation site S&#x0002f;T-P-X-K&#x0002f;R, where X is any amino acid. The Clb2&#x02013;Cdc28 complex is known to associate with several other proteins such as Sic1 and Cks1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gne024c28">28</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gne024c30">30</xref>). Thus, this test system allows us to ask whether enzymatic activity and protein complexes survive the purification procedure. For these experiments, the <italic>CLB2</italic> gene was over-expressed from the <italic>GAL</italic> promoter, which in this case gives &#x0223c;10-fold over-expression. Even with over-expression, however, Clb2 remains an extremely non-abundant protein.</p><p> The relevant <italic>in vivo</italic> substrates of Clb2&#x02013;Cdc28 are largely unknown. These substrates are amongst the most interesting proteins that might co-purify with the Clb2&#x02013;Cdc28 complex. Unfortunately, the association of substrates with this protein kinase complex may well be weak and transient, and so unlikely to survive purification. In an effort to stabilize the interaction between the kinase complex and its substrates, we created a mutant form of the Cdc28 kinase, Cdc28-K40R, which lacks a lysine crucial for enzymatic activity and so cannot phosphorylate proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gne024c31">31</xref>). The interactions of Cdc28-K40R with the normal substrates of Cdc28 might be somewhat stabilized, since enzyme&#x02013;substrate interactions are typically stronger than enzyme&#x02013;product interactions. In a two-hybrid assay, the Cdc28-K40R protein interacts more strongly than wild-type Cdc28 with certain putative substrates (G.Sherlock and B.Futcher, unpublished results). Some (but not all) of our purifications of Clb2-CHH used a strain that also over-expressed Cdc28-K40R, with the idea that substrates might remain associated with the Clb2-CHH&#x0002f;Cdc28-K40R complex.</p></sec><sec><title>Purification of Clb2&#x02013;Cdc28 complexes</title><p>Cells containing tagged or untagged Clb2 were grown, induced with galactose and lyzed.

Proteins were then separated by PAGE, and visualized by silver staining. Both the nickel and the calmodulin resin gave a large purification, in the sense that only a small fraction of the protein applied was retained on the resin, but nevertheless many different proteins were retained, and Clb2 constituted only a tiny fraction of the eluate (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gne024f2">2</xref>). Similarly, immunoprecipitation with 12CA5 as the only purification step greatly enriches for Clb2, but leaves many contaminating proteins (data not shown).</p><p> However, when protein purified on the calmodulin resin was then subjected to immunoprecipitation as a second purification step, a striking purification was obtained (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gne024f2">2</xref>B, lanes 3 and 4). Nearly all of the contaminating yeast proteins were removed, and a 56 kDa band corresponding to Clb2 was one of the strongest bands on the gel. Another strong band migrating at &#x0223c;34 kDa proved to be Cdc28 (see below), which is expected to co-purify with Clb2 in stoichiometric quantities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gne024c32">32</xref>).</p><p> Similar results were obtained using the nickel resin followed by immunoprecipitation (data not shown), although our impression is that the nickel&#x0002f;12CA5 combination is somewhat less effective than the calmodulin&#x0002f;12CA5 combination.</p><p> Sequential purifications with the nickel resin and the calmodulin resin were also attempted. Unfortunately, there is an incompatibility between the buffer requirements for the two resins: the elution buffer for the calmodulin resin is incompatible with binding to the nickel resin, and vice versa. Our attempts at buffer exchange were disappointing, in that there was a significant loss of yield at the buffer exchange step, at least for small-scale purifications. Buffer exchange was not attempted for any large-scale purification.</p><p> Western analysis of protein purified by calmodulin&#x0002f;12CA5 showed that the prominent 56 kDa band of Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gne024f2">2</xref>B is Clb2, and that the prominent 34 kDa band is Cdc28 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gne024f3">3</xref>). Furthermore, western analysis showed that Sic1, another protein expected to co-purify with Clb2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gne024c28">28</xref>), was also present (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gne024f3">3</xref>). Sic1 is sub-stoichiometric, so it is not visible by silver staining in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gne024f2">2</xref>, but it is visible by silver staining in similarly purified material when a larger amount of protein is loaded on the gel (see below). Note that the relative intensities of the bands seen by western analysis do not indicate the relative abundance of each protein, because the antibodies used to detect the three proteins are quite different.</p><p> Protein kinase assays with a synthetic peptide substrate showed that the purified Clb2&#x02013;Cdc28 complexes retained kinase activity (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gne024f4">4</xref>). The protein kinase assay suggests that the immunoprecipitation step is quite efficient, since the activity remaining after precipitation is &#x0223c;60&#x00025; of the activity before precipitation.</p></sec><sec><title>Identification of co-purifying proteins by tandem mass spectrometry</title><p>The usefulness of the CHH tag for identification of members of a protein complex was tested. Twelve liter cultures of cells carrying untagged Clb2 (control) or Clb2-CHH or Clb2-CHH in a <italic>CDC28 GAL-cdc28K40R</italic> strain were grown, induced with galactose, and lyzed. Tagged Clb2 was purified first on calmodulin resin, and then immunoprecipitated using 12CA5. Proteins in the immunoprecipitates were resolved using SDS&#x02013;10&#x00025; PAGE and visualized by silver staining (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gne024f5">5</xref>). Very little yeast protein was present in the untagged control (lane 1), while several bands, including the previously identified Clb2 and Cdc28 bands, were prominent in the Clb2-CHH lane (lane&#x000a0;2). Several bands were more prominent when Clb2-CHH was purified from the <italic>cdc28K40R</italic> strain than when purified from the <italic>CDC28</italic> strain (compare lane 3 with lane 2), suggesting that the corresponding proteins might enjoy a tighter association with the kinase-dead version of Cdc28 than with the wild-type protein.</p><p> A total of 23 protein bands were excised (from lane 3, Fig.&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="gne024f5">5</xref>). The gel slices were treated with trypsin to digest proteins, and the fragments were analyzed by tandem mass spectrometry. Using the SEQUEST algorithm, acquired fragmentation spectra of peptides were correlated with predicted amino acid sequences from the standard <italic>S.cerevisiae</italic> open reading frames (ORFs). In this way, the proteins present in each of bands 1&#x02013;23 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gne024f5">5</xref>) were identified (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="gne024tb4">4</xref>).</p><p> These proteins included six different forms of Clb2 itself. Some of these might be proteolytic fragments, while others might be differently phosphorylated forms. In addition, there were three proteins known or strongly suspected to be associated with Clb2. These were Cdc28, the protein kinase catalytic subunit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gne024c27">27</xref>); Sic1, a protein known to bind and inhibit Clb&#x02013;Cdc28 complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gne024c28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gne024c33">33</xref>); and Cks1, a protein of somewhat uncertain function, but widely conserved and known to associate with cyclin&#x02013;CDK complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gne024c30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gne024c34">34</xref>). These are the only three proteins known to bind tightly to Clb2 (or the Clb2&#x02013;Cdc28 complex) in fairly large amounts.</p><p> Neglecting trypsin (a contaminant from the digestion procedure), and neglecting Psa1, Ubp3 and Ycr030c, which were identified by only a single peptide and whose presence is therefore somewhat uncertain, there were eight other proteins found. These were Sup35, Yil105c, Yll054c, Ded1, Dbp1, Tef1, Ssa1 and Ssb1. The significance of these proteins is unknown (but see below). Five of the eight (Sup35, Ded1, Dbp1, Tef1 and Ssb1) are abundant proteins involved in protein synthesis. There is no apparent connection between these proteins and Clb2, and yet it is not clear why they would be present as non-specific contaminants, since they are not present in the untagged control, and many other equally or more-abundant proteins involved in protein synthesis are not present.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>The MAFT strategy worked very well. A non-abundant complex was purified to near homogeneity. Purification on a scale sufficient for mass spectrometry required only 12 l of cell culture, and the purification was completed within 1 day. The kinase activity of the complex was preserved, and at least three genuine Clb2-associated proteins co-purified with Clb2-CHH. It is likely that exactly the same purification method will be similarly successful with many other proteins and protein complexes.</p><p> The broad strategy of MAFT can be implemented in many different ways. Seraphin and co-workers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gne024c7">7</xref>) have developed a multiple affinity tag called the TAP tag, while here, we have developed the CHH tag. In our studies, we did an initial purification with either a calmodulin or a nickel resin, and then a second purification by immunoprecipitation. A disadvantage of these particular protocols is that the final purified material is associated with antibody and protein A beads, rather than being in solution (though incubation with a quadruple HA peptide can elute up to 50&#x00025; of the bound material, data not shown). We had hoped to purify proteins using the calmodulin resin and the nickel resin in sequence, yielding a soluble product. Unfortunately, the buffers used to elute material from the calmodulin resin are incompatible with binding to the nickel resin, and vice versa. Consecutive purifications using these two resins should be possible if buffer is exchanged between steps, but this introduces extra complexity and loss of yield. It is likely that additional MAFT cassettes can be designed incorporating other tags that can be used consecutively and immediately, and that will yield a soluble product.</p><p> We did not measure the yield of Clb2, though it seemed good compared to other methods. Our experience with immunoprecipitation of a wide variety of tagged proteins suggests that an important factor in determining yield will be the accessibility of the tag on the protein of interest. In cases where yield is unacceptably low, it may be beneficial to move the tag to the other end of the protein.</p><p> There is an abundance of evidence showing that Cdc28, Sic1 and Cks1 are strongly associated with Clb2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gne024c27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gne024c28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gne024c30">30</xref>), and indeed we found all three of these proteins. There is some evidence for association of Swi4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gne024c35">35</xref>) and Nap1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gne024c36">36</xref>), but we found neither of these. Swi4 is itself a non-abundant protein, and perhaps would be found in a larger-scale purification. Nap1 has a mass of 48 kDa, and migrates in a region of the gel containing contaminants from the IgG heavy chain. We did not examine any fragments from this region of the gel by mass spectrometry, and so would not have seen Nap1 even if it were present. Finally, there are four proteins suggested to associate with Clb2 by two-hybrid analysis (but by no other evidence) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gne024c37">37</xref>), but we found none of these. Thus, out of a total of nine proteins where there is at least a trace of evidence for direct association with Clb2, we found three, but these are the three for which evidence of association is most compelling.</p><p> We also found eight proteins for which there was no previous evidence of association with Clb2; at present, we do not know whether any of these are truly associated, or whether they are simply co-purifying. These proteins were found in a strain over-expressing a mutant form of Cdc28 which is defective in ATP binding. Conceivably the lack of ATP leads to a folding defect, and this somehow promotes association with chaperones. With regard to Sup35 and Yil105c, the host yeast strain used for production of Clb2 was W303. This strain is &#x0005b;<italic>psi</italic><italic><sup>&#x0002b;</sup></italic>&#x0005d; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gne024c15">15</xref>), meaning that it contains the prion (aggregated) form of Sup35 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gne024c38">38</xref>). Remarkably, YIL105c (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gne024c37">37</xref>) contains a region near its N-terminus resembling the glutamine-rich prion region of Sup35. Possibly, the presence of one prion in this strain has induced aggregation in Yil105c, and the aggregation of these two proteins has somehow allowed them to co-purify with Clb2.</p><p> A large hydrophobic face of the cyclin makes contact with the cyclin-dependent kinase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gne024c39">39</xref>). What is the state of this hydrophobic face after the cyclin has folded, but before it has paired with its CDK partner? It would not be surprising if chaperones were temporarily associated with the hydrophobic face of the cyclin. Indeed, the Ssa &#x02018;chaperones&#x02019; are required for the folding of proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gne024c40">40</xref>) and, furthermore, the chaperone-like protein Cdc37 is already known to be involved in forming the cyclin&#x02013;CDK complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gne024c41">41</xref>), and two other proteins involved in protein folding are somehow needed for cyclin&#x02013;CDK function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gne024c42">42</xref>). Possibly, the chaperone Ssa1 is also involved; it would be an appropriate molecule for protecting the hydrophobic face of Clb2 until a complex with Cdc28 could be formed. This could be the reason Ssa1 (and possibly also Ssb1) was found associated with Clb2. In this context, it is interesting that there is an allele of <italic>SSA1</italic>, <italic>ssa1-134</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gne024c43">43</xref>), which has a mutant phenotype reminiscent of the phenotypes of multiple <italic>clb</italic> mutants.</p><p> We purified Clb2 from a strain expressing a K40R mutation of Cdc28, in the hope that substrates might more stably associate with this inactive kinase complex. Although several proteins did seem more abundant in the complex isolated from the <italic>cdc28K40R</italic> strain, only one of these, Yll054c, has any resemblance to a candidate substrate. Yll054c is an uncharacterized protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gne024c44">44</xref>), but it resembles a zinc-finger transcription factor, and it has several possible SP and TP sites which could be phosphorylated by Cdc28 (though none of the sites has the full CDK consensus). Nevertheless, this strategy might still be successful if purification were carried out on a larger scale.</p></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="display-objects"><title>Figures and Tables</title><fig id="gne024f1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p> The structure (<bold>A</bold>) and sequence (<bold>B</bold>) of TAP tag (CHH) consisting of calmodulin binding peptide (CBP), six histidine residues (HIS6), and three copies of the hemagglutinin epitope (HA3), flanked by <italic>Not</italic>I sites.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="gne02401"/></fig><fig id="gne024f2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p> TAP of Clb2&#x02013;Cdc28 complex.
