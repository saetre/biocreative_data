In the skin, Langerhans cells (LCs) in the epidermis form a network for surveillance for antigens. LCs are known to express Langerin, a C-type lectin which contributes to formation of Birbeck granules <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005619-Stoitzner1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005619-Valladeau1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>. Besides the LCs, normal skin contains another type of DCs in the dermis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005619-Lenz1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>. In the initiation phase of immune responses in the skin, both the LCs and dermal DCs (DDCs) are thought to migrate into the skin-draining lymph nodes (LNs) to present antigens to T cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005619-Randolph1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005619-Itano1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>. However, functional and phenotypic differences between LCs and DDCs are still controversial.</p><p>In spite of their clear definition of DDCs based on their localization in the skin, there is no straightforward way to detect DDCs in murine LNs due to the lack of DDC-specific marker, making it complicated to correctly understand their roles in immune responses in comparison to LCs. In LNs, at least five different subsets of DCs have been identified in mice based on their surface markers, two of which are restricted to the skin-draining and mesenteric LNs, and are therefore thought to correspond to LCs or DDCs in the skin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005619-Anjuere1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005619-Kamath1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>. In these previous studies, however, difference between LCs and DDCs in the skin-draining LNs was ambiguous because the distinction was based on the differential intensity of markers such as CD8&#x003b1;, CD11b, and CD205 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005619-Henri1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Contact hypersensitivity (CHS) is one of the well-characterized immune responses in the skin.

The availability of MGL2 as a marker for a DDC subset enabled us to directly address whether MGL2<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> DDCs were sufficient in the induction of CHS by adoptive transfer experiments. FITC<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> MGL2<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> DDCs were isolated from the draining LNs of FITC-painted mice at day 1, and 7.5&#x000d7;10<sup>4</sup> cells were transferred into the footpad of a naive recipient (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005619-g006">Figure 6</xref>). Six days later, the recall responses in the recipients were elicited with FITC on the dorsal ear skin. Twenty-four hours after FITC painting, a significant ear swelling in the recipient of the MGL2<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> DDCs was observed to a similar extent to the mice painted with FITC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005619-g007">Figure 7A</xref>).

As an additional control, FITC<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>MGL2<sup>&#x02212;</sup>DDCs isolated from the day 4 draining LNs were tested. This time point was chosen because LC migration was reported to peak around day 4 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005619-Kissenpfennig2">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005619-Allan1">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref>, though we could not exactly address whether these transferred cells were LCs due to low Langerin expression on the cell surfaces preventing us from sorting experiments. When 5.0&#x000d7;10<sup>4</sup> cells were transferred, FITC<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>MGL2<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>DDCs isolated from the day 4 draining LNs were able to induce CHS upon re-stimulation, whereas FITC<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>MGL2<sup>&#x02212;</sup>DCs, putatively LCs, were not (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005619-g007">Figure 7B</xref>). Although one could argue that the difference in CHS-inducing capacity between these two populations were due to difference in the efficiency of FITC incorporation and not to Ag-presentation and/or migration capability, the results shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005619-g007">Figure 7</xref> strongly suggest that MGL2<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>DDCs are potent inducers of CHS.

In addition, because of similarity between LCs and DDCs, differential expression of a particular marker between these two subsets was debatable.

Second, MGL2<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> cells in LNs showed a typical phenotype of interstitial DCs as reported previously <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005619-Itano1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005619-Anjuere1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005619-Ruedl1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005619-Henri1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>.

In addition, judging from the immunohistochemistry and flow cytometric analyses of LNs, MGL2<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> DDCs were a distinct population from Langerin<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> LCs. The absence of Ly6G expression and the FITC-loading capacity after CHS sensitization suggested that MGL2<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> DDCs were also a distinct population from inflammatory monocyte-derived DCs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005619-Randolph2">&#x0005b;37&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005619-Qu1">&#x0005b;39&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005619-Tacke1">&#x0005b;40&#x0005d;</xref>.

These results suggest that MGL2<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> DDCs but not LCs initiate adaptive immune responses to antigens invading the skin.</p><p>In addition to the kinetics of the migration of MGL2<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> DDCs from the dermis to the LNs, the unique localization of MGL2<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> DDCs within the LNs supports our hypothesis that MGL2<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> DDCs are the predominant APCs in CHS. As reported previously <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005619-Kissenpfennig2">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>, the FITC<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>MGL2<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> DDCs were segregated from the LCs in the LNs 24 h after sensitization. Moreover, even in the steady state, MGL2<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> DDCs were also physically and temporally separated from the LCs and accumulated in the outer T cell cortex, especially in the CR. This localization of MGL2<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> DDCs was found to be highly unique among other DCs such as CD11c<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> DC, CD205<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> DCs and Langerin<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> LCs, all of which were distributed throughout the T cell cortex <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005619-Stoitzner1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005619-WitmerPack1">&#x0005b;52&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005619-Lindquist1">&#x0005b;53&#x0005d;</xref>. Two possibilities could explain the distinct migration and distribution patterns of these DCs in the LNs. First, LCs migrate directly into the deep T cell cortex through different lymphatics from the ones that MGL2<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> DDCs migrate through. The other possibility is that these two migrants share the same lymphatic routes to the LNs but are differently distributed within the LNs. The former possibility is not likely because many HEVs were surrounded by MGL2<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> DDCs at their follicular sides and by the LCs at their cortical sides in naive LNs. It was likely that these DCs once migrated to the same areas in the CR, and only LCs migrated further into the deep T cell cortex while MGL2<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> DDCs remained in the CR. The common route to the CR might be under the regulation of the chemokine receptor CCR7 because both CD11c<sup>int</sup> CD40<sup>hi</sup> DCs (population II in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005619-g004">Figure 4A</xref>) and CD11c<sup>hi</sup> CD40<sup>hi</sup> DCs (population III: MGL2<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> DDCs) seemed to be reduced in the CCR7-deficient mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005619-Ohl1">&#x0005b;35&#x0005d;</xref> and also because CCR7 ligands might be concentrated on the CR stroma <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005619-Katakai1">&#x0005b;41&#x0005d;</xref>.
