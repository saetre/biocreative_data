The importance of Fc-receptor (FcR) subunits in malaria immunity has been studied in animals with FcR deletions. Although informative, these gene-deficient mouse models may not always mimic the human immune condition, due to differences in FcR biology and an apparent lack of true homologues &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030072-b005">5</xref>&#x0005d;. Studies examining the role of FcR in immunity to parasites have made use of FcR&#x003b3;-chain knockout mice &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030072-b010">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030072-b011">11</xref>&#x0005d;. The &#x003b3;-chain, a subunit common to Fc&#x003b3;RI, Fc&#x003b3;RIIIa, Fc&#x0025b;RI, and Fc&#x003b1;RI, is required for efficient cell surface expression and signal transduction. Consequently, FcR&#x003b3;<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice are unable to elicit phagocytosis or Ab-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity reactions through these receptors. Two recent studies with rodent malarias in the FcR&#x003b3;<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> have proved controversial, with one study showing a crucial role for FcR-mediated Ab-dependent phagocytosis in host resistance to blood-stage <named-content content-type="genus-species">Plasmodium berghei</named-content> XAT infection &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030072-b010">10</xref>&#x0005d;, and another study with <named-content content-type="genus-species">Plasmodium yoelii</named-content> concluding that the protective effects of Ab probably arise through FcR-independent mechanisms &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030072-b011">11</xref>&#x0005d;. However, these studies ignore two important possibilities. Firstly, there might be other, as yet unidentified, FcR involved in the observed response, and secondly, the &#x003b1;-chain of many FcR may associate with other signaling proteins other than the common &#x003b3;-chain. With this in mind, it is interesting to note that mouse IgG3-opsonized <named-content content-type="genus-species">Cryptococcus neoformans</named-content> can still be phagocytosed by macrophages from FcR&#x003b3;<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030072-b012">12</xref>&#x0005d;. This effect is probably mediated via an undefined FcR without requiring &#x003b3;-chain for function because, of the known FcR, only murine Fc&#x003b3;RI binds mouse IgG3, as demonstrated by transfection studies &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030072-b013">13</xref>&#x0005d;. Secondly, FcR&#x003b3;-chain-deficient mice were found to express partially functional Fc&#x003b3;RI in more recent mouse knockouts &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030072-b014">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030072-b015">15</xref>&#x0005d;.

Intriguingly, panning against whole merozoites in which MSP1 processing had been allowed to proceed, gave almost identical patterns recognizing MSP1<sub>19</sub> and MSP1<sub>42</sub> to that seen when libraries were panned on recombinant proteins. Additionally, the close sequence similarity between scFvs obtained by panning with either processed merozoites or recombinant MSP1<sub>19</sub> suggests that natural antibody responses to the merozoite after secondary processing are directed more toward MSP1<sub>19</sub> than any other antigen remaining on the merozoite surface.</p><p>Twenty individual MSP1<sub>19</sub>-binding scFv clones selected on the basis of their binding to MSP1<sub>19</sub>-GST by ELISA, their variety of restriction fragment patterns on BstNI digestion, and their ability to inhibit the binding of anti&#x02013;<named-content content-type="genus-species">P. falciparum</named-content> MSP1<sub>19</sub> monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) 12.8 and 12.10 in competition ELISAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030072-g001">Figure 1</xref>F) were sequenced. mAb 12.8 and 12.10 have been shown to inhibit erythrocyte invasion in vitro by <named-content content-type="genus-species">P. falciparum</named-content> merozoites &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030072-b021">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030072-b022">22</xref>&#x0005d;.

Of these, only one amino acid substitution (Cys<sup>28</sup>&#x02192;Trp) completely ablated binding by both JS1 and JS2. Cys<sup>28</sup> forms a disulfide bond with Cys<sup>12</sup>, the mutation of which (Cys<sup>12</sup>&#x02192;Ile) had no affect on binding by JS1 or JS2 but did completely prevent binding by the mAbs 12.10 and 12.8. Six further mutants had intermediate effects on binding by JS1 and JS2, with (Arg<sup>20</sup>&#x02192;Glu) and (Asn<sup>33</sup>&#x02192;Ile) being particularly prominent since no binding by SPR analysis was seen when these mutant proteins were passed over JS1 or JS2 at identical concentrations to wild-type protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030072-g006">Figure 6</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="ppat-0030072-t001">Table 1</xref>). Three further substitutions at Lys<sup>40</sup>, Lys<sup>29</sup>, and Asn<sup>39</sup> only had minor affects on binding.

JS2 was equally effective at controlling malaria at the higher Ab dose of 1.5 mg/animal but was unable to prevent the development of parasitemia at lower doses (&#x02264;0.75 mg/animal) suggesting that subtle differences in affinity or fine-specificity can ultimately impact significantly on in vivo efficacy (unpublished data).

Importantly, the inability of human IgG1 to protect in nontransgenic mice indicates that mere blocking of MSP1<sub>19</sub> function by some form of steric hindrance or interference with MSP1<sub>19</sub> processing is insufficient to bring about protection, and that the presence of the Fc region is crucial, since this allows the recruitment of Fc&#x003b3;RI-mediated parasite clearance. In contrast to mAb 12.10 and 12.8, neither JS1 nor JS2 could inhibit MSP1 processing in vitro (unpublished data), suggesting that their efficacy in vivo is wholly dependent on Fc-mediated pathways. It will be informative to determine if subcloning the V genes onto alternative Fc scaffolds, such as IgG3 and IgA, which having larger Fc regions and greater flexibility to the IgG1 created here, would confer processing inhibitory activity. Interestingly, the JS1 and JS2 antibodies would be classified as blocking antibodies that favor erythrocyte invasion using an in vitro assay, but here the in vivo assay shows that they are important in parasite destruction.</p><p>Since intact 12.10 and 12.8 can inhibit MSP1 processing and invasion of erythrocytes in in vitro assays and Fabs and F(ab&#x02032;)<sub>2</sub> cannot, it is likely that the Fc portion of the antibody contributes in some way to this process. The Fc is of significant size (50 kDa) and is attached to the rest of the antibody via a flexible hinge that allows much wagging and flexibility in this region. Indeed the flexibility of the Fc is known to make an important contribution to function; therefore, it is not inconceivable that it may interfere with invasion by some form of steric hindrance of the merozoite. An alternative explanation not requiring FcR-bearing effector cells, is that complement plays a role in this process since only an intact antibody can activate the complement cascade and this occurs through the Fc-region, while explaining the lack of effect with Fabs or F(ab&#x02032;<sub>2</sub>). However, inhibition of invasion assays are done with heat-inactivated serum or in the presence of Albumax in the place of serum, suggesting that complement does not play a role, at least in vitro.</p><p>These unique Abs allowed us to show a specific mechanism of action in vivo, in experiments using mice transgenic for human Fc&#x003b3;RI. Such in vivo experiments are not possible in humans with <named-content content-type="genus-species">P. falciparum</named-content> malaria. Hence, recombinant human Abs engineered as described will be useful in correlating particular epitopes on MSP1<sub>19</sub> with protective immunity, as an aid to vaccine design, and will form the bases of effective in vivo assays prior to clinical trials in humans. Until now, work on human malaria parasites has made use of polyclonal Abs purified from immune sera in neutralization tests in vitro &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030072-b018">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030072-b019">19</xref>&#x0005d;. These antibody-dependent cellular inhibition experiments are technically demanding and far from optimal since sera contain a mixture of Abs, some with inappropriate specificities (such as blocking Abs) and the potential to trigger inhibitory FcR through intracellular immunoreceptor tyrosine inhibition motif signaling. The recombinant antibodies described herein are of a defined class and specificity and offer reproducible standards for such assays in an in vivo system, a model that has hitherto not been possible. The <named-content content-type="genus-species">P. berghei</named-content> mouse transgenic combination is a good model for <named-content content-type="genus-species">P. falciparum</named-content> in humans since mouse IgG2a binds with similar affinity to human monocytes as human IgG1, indicating that the transgenic receptor would be fully occupied with mouse IgG2a in vivo and accurately reflecting the situation in humans with IgG1 &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030072-b028">28</xref>&#x0005d;.

Fc&#x003b3;RI expression in these transgenic mice is limited to cells of the myeloid lineage, including monocytes and dendritic cells and can be upregulated by several cytokines including IL-10 and IFN-&#x003b3;, both of which are implicated in immunity to malaria &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030072-b029">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030072-b030">30</xref>&#x0005d;.

From a therapeutic bioavailability standpoint triggering Fc&#x003b3;RII may not be ideal. This is because both IgG1 and IgG3 can bind Fc&#x003b3;Rs on cells that do not directly kill parasites, including platelets, B cells, endothelial cells, and even placental tissue, resulting in the triggering of inhibitory Fc&#x003b3;RII receptors &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030072-b004">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030072-b005">5</xref>&#x0005d;.

Unfortunately, this study used pooled immune serum and whole parasites, and the contribution of individual IgG subclasses and the antigens driving Fc&#x003b3;RIIb signaling could not be investigated. The epitope-specific reagents described in this study would allow these questions to be answered for fully human antibodies. For example, we are in the process of mutating our anti-MSP1<sub>19</sub> human IgG1s to make more potent antimalarial antibodies by changing residues in the Fc that optimize binding to the activatory receptors, including Fc&#x003b3;RI, at the expense of binding to the Fc&#x003b3;RIIb inhibitory receptor &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030072-b033">33</xref>&#x0005d;.</p><p>Merozoite killing can also be mediated by neutrophils &#x0005b;present study and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030072-b024">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030072-b034">34</xref>&#x0005d;.
