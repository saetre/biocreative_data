Taurine is an abundant component of meat and fish-based foods and has been used as an oral supplement in the treatment of disorders such as cystic fibrosis and hypertension. The purpose of this investigation was to identity the relative contributions of the solute transporters involved in taurine uptake across the luminal membrane of human enterocytes. Distinct transport characteristics were revealed following expression of the candidate solute transporters in <italic>Xenopus laevis</italic> oocytes: PAT1 (SLC36A1) is a H<sup>+</sup>-coupled, pH-dependent, Na<sup>+</sup>- and Cl<sup>&#x02212;</sup>-independent, low-affinity, high-capacity transporter for taurine and &#x003b2;-alanine; TauT (SLC6A6) is a Na<sup>+</sup>- and Cl<sup>&#x02212;</sup>-dependent, high-affinity, low-capacity transporter of taurine and &#x003b2;-alanine; ATB<sup>0,+</sup> (SLC6A14) is a Na<sup>+</sup>- and Cl<sup>&#x02212;</sup>-dependent, high-affinity, low-capacity transporter which accepts &#x003b2;-alanine but not taurine. Taurine uptake across the brush-border membrane of human intestinal Caco-2 cell monolayers showed characteristics of both PAT1- and TauT-mediated transport. Under physiological conditions, Cl<sup>&#x02212;</sup>-dependent TauT-mediated uptake predominates at low taurine concentrations, whereas at higher concentrations typical of diet, Cl<sup>&#x02212;</sup>-independent PAT1-mediated uptake is the major absorptive mechanism. Real-time PCR analysis of human duodenal and ileal biopsy samples demonstrates that PAT1, TauT and ATB<sup>0,+</sup> mRNA are expressed in each tissue but to varying degrees. In conclusion, this study is the first to demonstrate both taurine uptake via PAT1 and functional coexpression of PAT1 and TauT at the apical membrane of the human intestinal epithelium. PAT1 may be responsible for bulk taurine uptake during a meal whereas TauT may be important for taurine supply to the intestinal epithelium and for taurine capture between meals.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><p>Taurine is the most abundant free amino acid in the human body. It has a ubiquitous distribution and accounts for approximately 0.1% of total body weight (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">Huxtable, 1992</xref>). The important functions of taurine are too numerous to examine here but are described in detail in a number of reviews (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">Hayes, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">Huxtable, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">Sturman, 1993</xref>). In short, taurine has many fundamental biological roles such as bile acid conjugation, antioxidation, osmoregulation, membrane stabilization and modulation of Ca<sup>2+</sup> signalling, and is essential for cardiovascular function, and development and function of muscle, the retina and the central nervous system. Endogenous taurine is synthesized mainly in the liver and brain but is freely available for utilization from carnivorous and omnivorous diets due to its abundant expression in animal tissues. Indeed, taurine is an essential amino acid in some carnivores (e.g. cats) where, following domestication, a taurine-deficient diet is associated with retinal degeneration, cardiomyopathy, high pregnancy failure, low neonate survival rate and stunted growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">Hayes, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">Sturman, 1993</xref>). In man, taurine is considered conditionally essential as it is essential during development and is subsequently found at high concentrations in breast milk, for example 0.4 m<sc>m</sc> in human, 0.8 m<sc>m</sc> in mouse, 2.8 m<sc>m</sc> in cats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">Sturman, 1993</xref>). It is recommended that synthetic infant feeds are supplemented with taurine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">Sturman, 1993</xref>). However, dietary taurine may also be essential in adults under pathophysiological conditions where surgery, trauma, critical illness and long-term total parenteral nutrition (in both adults and children) are associated with decreased taurine levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">Laidlaw &#x00026; Kopple, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">Paauw &#x00026; Davis, 1990</xref>). The importance of dietary taurine in pathophysiological conditions is emphasized by its successful use as an oral supplement in various clinical disorders including cystic fibrosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">Darling <italic>et al.</italic> 1985</xref>), diabetes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">Franconi <italic>et al.</italic> 1995</xref>) and hypertension (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">Militante &#x00026; Lombardini, 2002</xref>).</p><p>There are two intestinal transport mechanisms that mediate taurine movement across the brush-border membrane of the mammalian small intestine. Over recent years, the focus of investigation of intestinal taurine transport has been the high-affinity, low-capacity Na<sup>+</sup>- and Cl<sup>&#x02212;</sup>-dependent transporter TauT (SLC6A6). cDNAs for the TauT carrier have been isolated from a number of species and tissues including MDCK (canine) cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b48">Uchida <italic>et al.</italic> 1992</xref>), rat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">Smith <italic>et al.</italic> 1992</xref>), mouse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">Liu <italic>et al.</italic> 1992</xref>) and human (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">Ramamoorthy <italic>et al.</italic> 1994</xref>). The cloned transporter has identical functional characteristics to the Na<sup>+</sup>- and Cl<sup>&#x02212;</sup>-dependent transport system for the &#x003b2; amino acids taurine and &#x003b2;-alanine characterized using brush-border membrane vesicles (BBMVs) from rat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">Barnard <italic>et al.</italic> 1988</xref>) and rabbit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">Miyamoto <italic>et al.</italic> 1989</xref>) small intestine. This transport system has been named variously as the &#x003b2; amino acid carrier or taurine transporter and has also been characterized in the intact intestinal epithelium using either flat sheets of intestine from rabbit, guinea pig and rat small intestine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">Munck &#x00026; Munck, 1992</xref>, <sc>1</sc>994), or monolayers of the human intestinal epithelial cell line Caco-2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">Brandsch <italic>et al.</italic> 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">Satsu <italic>et al.</italic> 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">Roig-P&#x000e9;rez <italic>et al.</italic> 2005</xref>). Comprehensive investigations of taurine and &#x003b2;-alanine transport demonstrate that this high-affinity, very low-capacity carrier is the only transport mechanism for taurine uptake in the rabbit and guinea pig small intestine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">Munck &#x00026; Munck, 1992</xref>, <sc>1</sc>994).</p><p>Earlier reports of intestinal taurine transport, using intact sheets of rat small intestine, suggested that the major absorptive mechanism for taurine was a low-affinity transporter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">Munck, 1977</xref>, <sc>1</sc>983). Munck and colleagues identified that this taurine uptake in rat small intestine was via the partially Na<sup>+</sup>-dependent, but Cl<sup>&#x02212;</sup>-independent, imino acid carrier, a low-affinity transport system with a broad substrate specificity which is absent from guinea pig and rabbit small intestine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">Munck &#x00026; Munck, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">Munck <italic>et al.</italic> 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">Anderson <italic>et al.</italic> 2004</xref>). Over the same period, a low-affinity H<sup>+</sup>-coupled transporter of a broad range of amino acids was identified at the brush-border membrane of human intestinal Caco-2 cell monolayers and named system PAT, for proton-coupled amino acid transporter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b45">Thwaites <italic>et al.</italic> 1993</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b46">1995</xref>). cDNA clones for system PAT have been isolated from rat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">Sagn&#x000e9;<italic>et al.</italic> 2001</xref>), mouse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">Boll <italic>et al.</italic> 2002</xref>) and human (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">Chen <italic>et al.</italic> 2003</xref>). This system PAT-related carrier is now known as PAT1 and is the first of four members of solute carrier family 36 (SLC36A1). Recent studies have shown that the rat imino acid carrier and system PAT represent the same transport system and that the partial Na<sup>+</sup> dependence of the imino acid carrier observed in rat small intestine is due to a functional coupling between the H<sup>+</sup>-coupled transporter PAT1 and the Na<sup>+</sup>/H<sup>+</sup> exchanger NHE3 (SLC9A3) such that the driving force (the H<sup>+</sup>-electrochemical gradient) for PAT1-mediated amino acid movement is maintained during absorption via NHE3-mediated H<sup>+</sup> efflux (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b46">Thwaites <italic>et al.</italic> 1995</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b44">1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b43">Thwaites &#x00026; Anderson, 2007</xref>). Perhaps the earliest evidence for &#x003b2; amino acid transport via this low-affinity transporter were the demonstrations of &#x003b2;-alanine absorption in rat small intestine <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">Schofield &#x00026; Lewis, 1947</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">Randall &#x00026; Evered, 1964</xref>) that were both pH dependent (uptake being stimulated as luminal pH was decreased) and active (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">Thompson <italic>et al.</italic> 1970</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">De la No&#x000fc;e <italic>et al.</italic> 1971</xref>). PAT1 has been immunolocalized to the brush-border membrane of human intestinal Caco-2 cell monolayers, and both human and rat small intestine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">Chen <italic>et al.</italic> 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">Anderson <italic>et al.</italic> 2004</xref>). Thus, in some species (e.g. human and rat) an alternative to the well-characterized high-affinity, low-capacity TauT transport system is expressed at the luminal surface of the small intestinal epithelium and this alternative carrier may be important in intestinal absorption when taurine is present at high concentrations such as those found in meat and fish-based foods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">Laidlaw <italic>et al.</italic> 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">Huxtable, 1992</xref>).</p><p>The objectives of this study were threefold: to determine whether the two taurine transporters, PAT1 and TauT, are coexpressed functionally in the same membrane surface; to estimate the relative contribution of each to taurine transport across the brush-border surface of confluent monolayers of the human intestinal epithelial cell line Caco-2; to identify the tissue distribution of &#x003b2; amino acid transporters in the human intestine which will aid in predicting the likely role of each transporter (PAT1 (SLC36A1), TauT (SLC6A6) and ATB<sup>0,+</sup> (SLC6A14)) in absorptive transport along the length of the human intestine.

Firstly, the affinity for taurine differs by a 1000-fold (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02">Fig. 2</xref>) so that even at concentrations below the <italic>K</italic><sub>m</sub> for PAT1, taurine transport via TauT will be saturated. Secondly, PAT1 functions as a H<sup>+</sup>-coupled, pH-dependent, Na<sup>+</sup>- and Cl<sup>&#x02212;</sup>-independent transporter whereas TauT is a Na<sup>+</sup>- and Cl<sup>&#x02212;</sup>-coupled transport system (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig03">Fig. 3</xref>). Thirdly, TauT is highly selective for &#x003b2; amino acids whereas PAT1 accepts &#x003b2; amino acids and other amino acids (e.g. proline and MeAIB) with similar affinity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig04">Fig. 4</xref>). The question arises as to which of these transporters mediates taurine uptake across the luminal surface of the human small intestine. Therefore, the next stage in this investigation was to exploit the distinctive characteristics of these two transporters to identify whether or not PAT1 and TauT are functionally coexpressed at the brush-border membrane of intact monolayers of the human intestinal epithelial cell line Caco-2 and to identify the relative contribution of these two transport systems to taurine uptake. The results in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig05">Fig. 5</xref> demonstrate that both PAT1 and TauT can mediate taurine uptake across the apical membrane of human intestinal Caco-2 cell monolayers if measured under conditions that favour transport via each individual transport system. [<sup>3</sup>H]Taurine uptake was first measured under conditions that will favour transport via the low-affinity H<sup>+</sup>-coupled, Na<sup>+</sup>-independent, PAT1 (pH 5.5, Na<sup>+</sup>-free solutions, high taurine concentration of 100 &#x003bc;<sc>m</sc>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig05">Fig. 5<italic>A</italic> and <italic>B</italic></xref>). Under these conditions, where Na<sup>+</sup>-dependent TauT will not function, [<sup>3</sup>H]taurine uptake has all the characteristics of PAT1 being increased as luminal pH is reduced from pH 7.4 to 5.5, and being inhibited by &#x003b2;-alanine and proline (both 10 m<sc>m</sc>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig05">Fig. 5<italic>A</italic></xref>). This pH-dependent, Na<sup>+</sup>-independent, taurine uptake across the apical membrane of Caco-2 cell monolayers is saturable with similar affinity (<italic>K</italic><sub>m</sub> 10.1 &#x000b1; 1.2 m<sc>m</sc>, <italic>V</italic><sub>max</sub> 47 200 &#x000b1; 2300 pmol cm<sup>&#x02212;2</sup> (15 min)<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig05">Fig. 5<italic>B</italic></xref>) to that observed using PAT1-expressing oocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02">Fig. 2<italic>A</italic></xref>).

Under these conditions (0.1 &#x003bc;<sc>m</sc> taurine, apical pH 7.4), where PAT1 function will be minimal, [<sup>3</sup>H]taurine uptake has all the characteristics of TauT, transport being abolished in the absence of Na<sup>+</sup> and Cl<sup>&#x02212;</sup>, and being selectively inhibited by &#x003b2;-alanine (500 &#x003bc;<sc>m</sc>, <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001) but not proline (500 &#x003bc;<sc>m</sc>, <italic>P</italic> &#x0003e; 0.05, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig05">Fig. 5<italic>C</italic></xref>).

In addition, we provide the first demonstration that both PAT1 and TauT are functionally coexpressed at the brush-border membrane of intact monolayers of the human intestinal epithelial cell line Caco-2. It is also evident that the relative contribution of each transport system to total intestinal taurine transport will vary depending upon local conditions including taurine concentration and the ionic composition (Na<sup>+</sup>, Cl<sup>&#x02212;</sup> and H<sup>+</sup>) of the solution bathing the mucosal surface of the enterocyte. Under physiological conditions (apical pH 6.5, NaCl-containing solutions), both transporters will mediate taurine uptake across the brush-border membrane with TauT being the dominant transporter at low extracellular taurine concentrations whereas PAT1 will mediate the bulk of taurine uptake at concentrations above 10 &#x003bc;<sc>m</sc> (which is around the <italic>K</italic><sub>m</sub> of TauT for taurine) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig06">Fig. 6</xref>).

In contrast to the observations in rat small intestine, there is no evidence for a PAT1 component of taurine uptake in rabbit or guinea pig small intestine where taurine uptake appears to be mediated solely by TauT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">Munck &#x00026; Munck, 1992</xref>, <sc>1</sc>994). Thus, there are clear species differences in the complement of amino acid transport systems expressed at the luminal surface of the small intestinal epithelium. This species variability is also evident for ATB<sup>0,+</sup>. We were unable to detect ATB<sup>0,+</sup> function in human intestinal Caco-2 cell monolayers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig07">Fig. 7</xref>). A previous report (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">Hu &#x00026; Borchardt, 1992</xref>) has suggested that ATB<sup>0,+</sup> may be responsible for Na<sup>+</sup>-dependent phenylalanine uptake in Caco-2 cells but the low affinity (<italic>K</italic><sub>m</sub> 2.7 m<sc>m</sc>) and poor inhibition by 10 m<sc>m</sc> lysine (a concentration 100-fold greater than the <italic>K</italic><sub>m</sub> for lysine; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">Sloan &#x00026; Mager, 1999</xref>) reported suggest that ATB<sup>0,+</sup> is not involved. In contrast to the lack of ATB<sup>0,+</sup> in Caco-2 cells, ATB<sup>0,+</sup> is the predominant transport system for &#x003b2;-alanine in some other intestinal tissues, for instance, rabbit ileum (whereas it plays only a minor role in the rabbit jejunum; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">Munck &#x00026; Munck, 1992</xref>). Although ATB<sup>0,+</sup> is generally considered to be primarily located in the distal small intestine and colon in many species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">Munck &#x00026; Munck, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">Hatanaka <italic>et al.</italic> 2002</xref>) we found a higher expression of ATB<sup>0,+</sup> (albeit at the mRNA level) in the duodenum than ileum in both the human tissue panel and human biopsy samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig08">Fig. 8</xref>). Therefore, although ATB<sup>0,+</sup> will not be involved in taurine absorption, it may play a role in transport of both nutrients and orally active drugs in proximal and distal regions of the human small intestine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">Nakanishi <italic>et al.</italic> 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">Hatanaka <italic>et al.</italic> 2002</xref>).</p><p>The variation in the expression of the taurine transporters, particularly PAT1, in the small intestine of different species most likely represents adaptation to dietary availability of taurine. The relative requirement for dietary taurine <italic>versus</italic> endogenous synthesis, in any particular animal or species, will vary with age, environment and physiological state but will generally reflect the relative magnitudes of synthetic capacity (cysteinesulfinate decarboxylase) and demand (due to catabolism, biliary secretion and renal excretion). In man, one of the major sinks for whole body taurine content is in the conjugation of bile acids in the liver. Interestingly, strong parallels can be made between the relative dependence of certain species on dietary taurine and their ability to utilize taurine in bile acid conjugation. A progressive dependence upon dietary taurine has been observed in the series: guinea pig, rat, monkey, human and cat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">Huxtable, 1992</xref>). Most vertebrates conjugate bile acids exclusively to taurine although some placental animals have adapted to use glycine wholly or partially (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b49">Vessey, 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">Huxtable, 1992</xref>). Cats conjugate taurine to bile acids but have minimal capacity for taurine synthesis making them reliant on diet (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">Hayes, 1988</xref>). This may represent an adaptation to maximize use of the abundant taurine in carnivorous diets which negates the requirement for energy expenditure on taurine synthesis. Humans conjugate bile acids to either taurine or glycine with the ratio varying during development and in response to changes in dietary taurine but not dietary glycine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">Garbutt <italic>et al.</italic> 1971</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">Sturman, 1993</xref>). Interestingly, PAT1 can also transport glycine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b46">Thwaites <italic>et al.</italic> 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">Chen <italic>et al.</italic> 2003</xref>). However, compared to many other species, humans have a low capacity for taurine synthesis and are still relatively dependent upon dietary sources (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">Laidlaw &#x00026; Kopple, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">Huxtable, 1992</xref>). Rats conjugate bile acids exclusively to taurine but, unlike cats, have significant synthetic capacity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b51">Worden &#x00026; Stipanuk, 1985</xref>) to generate endogenous taurine. In contrast, herbivores such as the guinea pig and rabbit, whose diet is essentially devoid of taurine, conjugate bile acids exclusively to glycine, presumably reflecting an adaptive response to the relative taurine deficiency in the liver (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b49">Vessey, 1978</xref>). Thus, it appears that the relative dependence upon dietary (as opposed to endogenous) taurine may reflect, at least in part, the use of taurine as the conjugate in bile acid synthesis. As a result, it seems likely that the relative capacities of the small intestine of different species will have adapted to, firstly, maximize taurine absorption from diet and, secondly, ensure the efficient reabsorption of taurine following deconjugation of bile salts (e.g. taurocholate) from the intestinal lumen. In human and rat intestine, where a requirement for luminal taurine uptake either from dietary or biliary sources might be expected, there are two taurine transport systems at the small intestinal luminal surface: PAT1, a low-affinity, high-capacity transporter; and TauT, a high-affinity, very low-capacity transporter. In contrast, in certain herbivorous mammals (guinea pig and rabbit) with a diet essentially devoid of taurine and which do not conjugate bile acids to taurine, the low-affinity (PAT1-like) transporter for taurine seems to have been lost and uptake across the small intestinal brush-border membrane can be accounted for by a TauT-like transporter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">Miyamoto <italic>et al.</italic> 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">Munck &#x00026; Munck, 1992</xref>, <sc>1</sc>994).</p><p>In conclusion, we have identified the key functional characterictics of taurine transport via PAT1 and TauT that will allow discrimination between these two carriers in intestine and other tissues. Interpretation of data using commercial multiple tissue panels is limited. However, the relative contributions of PAT1 and TauT to taurine uptake across the Caco-2 cell monolayers, plus relative estimates of PAT1 and TauT transcript expression by real-time PCR in human duodenal and ileal mucosal samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig08">Fig. 8</xref>), as well as Caco-2 cells, support a role for both transporters in taurine absorption. The high-capacity PAT1 transporter may be responsible for the bulk of taurine uptake during a high-taurine meal whereas the low-capacity TauT transporter may be more important for either supplying taurine to the intestinal epithelium (e.g. as an osmolyte) or for capturing taurine released between meals (e.g. from sloughed cells) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b43">Thwaites &#x00026; Anderson, 2007</xref>). The expression of both transporters in the distal intestine indicates that both could play a role in reabsorption of taurine deconjugated from bile acids by bacteria in distal parts of the lumen. How the relative expression levels of the two transporters vary spatially (e.g. along the crypt&#x02013;villus axis), developmentally and in response to changes in diet, hormonal levels or pharmacological regimes, requires further investigation.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank Mrs Lisa Burdis for excellent technical assistance.
