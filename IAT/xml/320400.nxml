This genome (MIARN) displays features common to other IAP retroviral-like genomes. Long terminal repeats (LTRs) are approximately 430 base pairs (bp) in length and show typical retroviral U3-R-U5 organisation, though the R-region, at 120 bp, is much larger than the average IAP. This difference probably arose by the amplification of a pyrimidine-rich sequence, by a slippage-mispairing mechanism. Flanking the 5' LTR is a sequence complementary to a phenylalanine tRNA, strongly conserved in all rodent IAP genomes and probably required to prime the initiation of (-) strand synthesis. Flanking the 3' LTR, is a purine-rich sequence probably required for (+) strand synthesis. The tRNA binding site (TBS) is flanked by six tandem copies of a sequence homologous to the TBS. The relationship of the MIARN element to other IAP genomes and the significance of its association with the highly expressed Ren-2 is discussed.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><supplementary-material content-type="scanned-pages"><graphic xlink:href="nar00340-0295.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="8579"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00340-0296.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="8580"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00340-0297.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="8581"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00340-0298.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="8582"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00340-0299.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="8583"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00340-0300.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="8584"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00340-0301.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="8585"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00340-0302.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="8586"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00340-0303.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="8587"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00340-0304.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="8588"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00340-0305.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="8589"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00340-0306.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="8590"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00340-0307.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="8591"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00340-0308.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="8592"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00340-0309.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="8593"/></supplementary-material></body></article>
