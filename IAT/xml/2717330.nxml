Several studies have shown that oxidative stress plays a key role in initiation as well as amplification of inflammation in airways. However, still there are no good anti-oxidant strategies available for therapeutic intervention in asthma pathogenesis. Most recent studies suggest that polyol pathway enzyme, aldose reductase (AR), contributes to the pathogenesis of oxidative stress&#x02013;induced inflammation by affecting the NF-&#x003ba;B-dependent expression of cytokines and chemokines and therefore inhibitors of AR could be anti-inflammatory. Since inhibitors of AR have already gone through phase-III clinical studies for diabetic complications and found to be safe, our hypothesis is that AR inhibitors could be novel therapeutic drugs for the prevention and treatment of asthma. Hence, we investigated the efficacy of AR inhibition in the prevention of allergic responses to a common natural airborne allergen, ragweed pollen that leads to airway inflammation and hyper-responsiveness in a murine model of asthma.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and Findings</title><p>Primary Human Small Airway Epithelial Cells (SAEC) were used to investigate the in vitro effects of AR inhibition on ragweed pollen extract (RWE)-induced cytotoxic and inflammatory signals. Our results indicate that inhibition of AR prevents RWE -induced apoptotic cell death as measured by annexin-v staining, increase in the activation of NF-&#x003ba;B and expression of inflammatory markers such as inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), cycloxygenase (COX)-2, Prostaglandin (PG) E<sub>2</sub>, IL-6 and IL-8. Further, BALB/c mice were sensitized with endotoxin-free RWE in the absence and presence of AR inhibitor and followed by evaluation of perivascular and peribronchial inflammation, mucin production, eosinophils infiltration and airway hyperresponsiveness. Our results indicate that inhibition of AR prevents airway inflammation and production of inflammatory cytokines, accumulation of eosinophils in airways and sub-epithelial regions, mucin production in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and airway hyperresponsiveness in mice.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>These results suggest that airway inflammation due to allergic response to RWE, which subsequently activates oxidative stress-induced expression of inflammatory cytokines via NF-&#x003ba;B-dependent mechanism, could be prevented by AR inhibitors. Therefore, inhibition of AR could have clinical implications, especially for the treatment of airway inflammation, a major cause of asthma pathogenesis.</p></sec></abstract><counts><page-count count="13"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>There has been a significantly increased prevalence of asthma over the last few decades, specifically in developing countries <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006535-Pearce1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>.

Cellular oxidative stress plays a fundamental role in inflammation through the activation of stress kinases such as MAPKs, which comprise a large family of protein kinases including ERK1 (p44<sup>MAPK</sup>)/ERK2 (p42<sup>MAPK</sup>) and JNK, which activate redox-sensitive transcription factors such as NF-&#x003ba;B and AP-1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006535-Wang1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>. The transcription factors bind to DNA and transcribe inflammatory proteins such as cytokines, chemokines, iNOS and COX-2.</p><p>Our recent studies have shown that ROS-induced NF-&#x003ba;B activation is mediated by aldose reductase-catalyzed products of lipid aldehyde-glutathione conjugates <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006535-Ramana1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006535-Ramana2">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>.

Most importantly, we have shown that AR-catalyzed reduced product of lipid aldehyde-glutathione conjugates such as glutathionyl-1,4-dihydroxynonane (GS-DHN) mediates NF-&#x003ba;B activation indicating that the inhibition of this enzyme could prevent inflammatory responses <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006535-Ramana2">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>.

For such use a careful examination of the effect of AR inhibition in clinically relevant animal models is mandatory. We have used short ragweed (<italic>Ambrosia artemisiifolia</italic>) pollen extract, one of the most abundant aeroallergen that causes severe seasonal allergic symptoms in the United States, Canada and Europe, to elicit allergic responses via induction of oxidative stress that mimics airway inflammation in humans <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006535-King1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006535-Bacsi1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>. In the present study, we investigated whether treatment with AR inhibitors could prevent alterations in the cytokine and chemokine levels in a cellular model using human SAEC and a clinically relevant mice model which mimics allergic airway inflammatory conditions in humans.

Zopolrestat alone did not affect the basal NF-&#x003ba;B activity in the SAEC. To further confirm NF-&#x003ba;B activation by RWE, we used NF-&#x003ba;B-dependent secretory alkaline phosphatase (SEAP) reporter assay and found that RWE significantly (&#x0003e;3-fold) induced NF-&#x003ba;B-dependent SEAP activation in SAEC and AR inhibitor, zopolrestat, caused &#x0003e;60&#x00025; inhibition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006535-g004">Fig. 4(II) B</xref>).

These results indicate that inhibition of AR that blocks the reduction of glutathione-lipid aldehyde conjugate could be a novel approach to prevent inflammation.</p><p>Antioxidants and ROS scavengers such as ascorbic acid, N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC), and superoxide dismutase (SOD) have been shown to be effective in controlling ROS-mediated airway inflammation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006535-Kirkham1">&#x0005b;48&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006535-Dharajiya1">&#x0005b;49&#x0005d;</xref>.

These evidences suggest that quenching ROS or blocking its effect on airway epithelial cells could be a potential strategy to prevent inflammation and tissue injury during allergic asthma. We observed that in SAEC, AR inhibition significantly prevents ROS formation by RWE challenge and thereby prevents ROS-induced cytotoxicity, including cellular apoptosis. These results suggest that AR inhibition could successfully attenuate the effect of ROS as well as ROS formation in SAEC.</p><p>Increased levels of inflammatory markers including cytokines such as interleukins (IL-6), chemokines such as IL-8 and other inflammatory mediators such as PGE<sub>2</sub> by airway epithelial cells are the hallmarks of inflammatory response in allergic asthma <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006535-Yamashita1">&#x0005b;54&#x0005d;</xref>. Primarily, these inflammatory markers are released by airway epithelial cells in response to allergens in order to remove and dispose off the allergens by recruiting immune cells. However, excessive allergen exposure causes an overwhelming response by epithelial cells resulting in increased ROS formation leading to activation of redox-sensitive transcription factors such as NF-&#x003ba;B and AP-1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006535-Pourazar1">&#x0005b;36&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006535-Pantano1">&#x0005b;42&#x0005d;</xref> which transcribe various inflammatory markers that cause cytotoxicity and damage to airway resulting in the pathogenesis of allergic asthma.

In view of limitations and side effects of present day anti-inflammatory medication to treat allergic disorders, it is imperative to search for a pharmacological agent with minimal side effects. The evidences presented in this report indicate that AR inhibitors could be a novel approach to control the allergen-induced inflammation in the airway epithelial cells. In summary, we have presented the evidence that AR mediates the respiratory inflammatory response during ragweed pollen-induced allergic asthma and have provided a novel concept that inhibition of AR could be a therapeutic approach in the treatment of allergic airway inflammation.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Reagents</title><p>Small airway epithelial basal medium (SABM), and small airway epithelial growth media (SAGM&#x02122;) bulletkit; and one Reagentpack&#x02122; containing Trypsin 0.025&#x00025;/EDTA 0.01&#x00025;, Trypsin neutralizing solution and HEPES buffered saline solution were purchaged from Cambrex Bio Sciences Walkersvillle, Inc.
