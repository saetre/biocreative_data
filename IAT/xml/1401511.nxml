The main regulatory mechanism that controls the <italic>HXK2</italic> gene expression in yeast is mediated by the Rgt1 and Med8 transcription factors, which repress <italic>HXK2</italic> expression in low-glucose containing media. In this study, we show that the repression activity of Rgt1 is regulated by Snf1 and Tpk3 protein kinases. Binding of Rgt1 to the <italic>HXK2</italic> promoter requires Rgt1 phosphorylation by Snf1 or by an Snf1-dependent protein kinase. Conversely, Rgt1 hyperphosphorylation by the Tpk3 or by a Tpk3-dependent protein kinase dissociates Rgt1 from the repressor complex. Two-hybrid and chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments indicate that an Snf1-dependent interaction between Rgt1 and Med8 in the repressor complex is also essential for Rgt1 repression. The repression of <italic>HXK2</italic> transcription by Rgt1 likely occurs through the formation of a DNA loop in the <italic>HXK2</italic> locus, spanning the promoter and coding regions. These results suggest that a novel silent-chromatin loop is responsible for Rgt1-dependent transcriptional regulation of the <italic>HXK2</italic> gene.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>The <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> glucose signalling pathway is controlled by a series of transcription factors and auxiliary proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>). Among them, hexokinase 2 (Hxk2) is an important repressor in this pathway. Beyond its classic metabolic role in initiating glucose metabolism, Hxk2 plays an important role in controlling the expression of several genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>). The <italic>HXK2</italic> gene is highly expressed during growth in high-glucose and is sparsely expressed in low-glucose media (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>). However, little is known about the molecular mechanisms that control the pattern of Hxk2 expression. In this study, we investigated whether Rgt1 regulates <italic>HXK2</italic> gene expression during glucose metabolism under high- and low-glucose growth condition.</p><p>Recently, Rgt1 and Med8 have been identified as two essential factors involved in the repression of the <italic>HXK2</italic> gene in low-glucose medium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>). The Med8 protein binds constitutively to the downstream regulatory sequence (DRS) of the <italic>HXK2</italic> gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>). Rgt1 binds to the RGT1 element of the <italic>HXK2</italic> promoter in a carbon source-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>). Additionally, the phosphorylation state of Rgt1 has been shown to be important during transcriptional regulation of <italic>HXT1</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>). Therefore, we postulated that glucose may shift the transcriptional activity of Rgt1 towards <italic>HXK2</italic> expression by inducing changes in the phosphorylation state of the Rgt1 protein.</p><p>It is known that in <italic>S.cerevisiae</italic>, the cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) is activated by extracellular glucose and inactivated during glucose deprivation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>). Structurally, the PKA holoenzyme is a heterotetramer composed of two regulatory subunits (Bcy1) and two catalytic subunits of three possible isoforms (Tpk1, Tpk2, Tpk3). These three catalytic subunits of PKA can have redundant functions in processes such as glycogen storage. However, these catalytic isoforms are not redundant in all cases. For example, Tpk2 is responsible for processes such as pseudohyphal growth, regulation of genes involved in trehalose degradation and iron uptake (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>). Tpk1 is required for derepression of branched chain amino acid biosynthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>) and Tpk3 is specifically involved in the regulation of mitochondrial enzymatic content during growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>). The subcellular localization of PKA is regulated by glucose. Indeed PKA holoenzymes in glucose-grown cells are localized to the nucleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>). Since Rgt1 is always located in the nucleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>), both PKA and Rgt1 localize to the same subcellular compartment during high glucose growth conditions. To elucidate the effects of PKA on Rgt1 during high glucose growth, we investigated each Tpk subunit in this process. Here, we show that Tpk3 is responsible for Rgt1 hyperphosphorylation during Rgt1 release from the <italic>HXK2</italic> promoter.</p><p>Since the lack of phosphorylation abolishes the ability of Rgt1 to repress <italic>HXT1</italic> transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>), we postulated that the absence of Rgt1 phosphorylation may affect <italic>HXK2</italic> repression. In order to elucidate this mechanism, we investigated the effect of Snf1 kinase activity on Rgt1-dependent repression of <italic>HXK2</italic>. The subcellular distribution of Snf1 is also affected by glucose levels. However, unlike PKA, Snf1 kinase is directed to the nucleus in low glucose conditions in a Gal83-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>). Therefore, both Snf1 and Rgt1 are located in the same subcellular compartment during low-glucose growth conditions. In this study, we show that the yeast protein kinase Snf1 is involved in the modification of Rgt1 required for <italic>HXK2</italic> gene repression.</p><p>Finally, given previous data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>), and data derived from our current <italic>in vivo</italic> studies, we propose a model to explain how low-glucose levels can repress the <italic>HXK2</italic> gene expression in yeast cells.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Yeast strains and growth media</title><p>The <italic>S.cerevisiae</italic> strains used in these experiments are listed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref> and are isogenic to the wild-type strain W303-1A, DBY1315 or BY4742.

The sequences of primers for PCR were as follows: for the <italic>HXK2</italic> promoter region containing the RGT1 element, OL7, 5&#x02032;-ACTACGAGTTTTCTGAACCTCC-3&#x02032; and OL8, 5&#x02032;-TAATTTCGTGGATCTCGAATC-3&#x02032; and for the <italic>HXK2</italic> gene region containing the MED8 element, OL9, 5&#x02032;-GGAATTGATGCAACAAATTGAG-3&#x02032;; and OL10, 5&#x02032;-GATTGAGTGGTGTCAAAGGTAC-3&#x02032;.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>RESULTS</title><sec><title>Glucose-regulated phosphorylation of Rgt1 <italic>in vivo</italic></title><p>Previous results have indicated that in cells grown in low glucose, Rgt1 is dephosphorylated and binds to several <italic>HXTs</italic> regulatory promoter regions. Conversely, high glucose-induced phosphorylation of Rgt1 inhibits its DNA-binding activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>). To determine whether the binding of Rgt1 to the RGT1 regulatory element within the <italic>HXK2</italic> promoter entails dephosphorylation of Rgt1, we examined the phosphorylation state of Rgt1 <italic>in vivo</italic> during growth in high and low glucose (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). For this purpose, we prepared extracts from mutant <italic>rgt1&#x00394;</italic> transformed cells with the HA-Rgt1 construct grown in the presence of high or low glucose. The extracts were analysed by western blot using a monoclonal HA antibody. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref> (lane 1), Rgt1 from high-glucose grown cells display a slight shift in molecular weight when compared with Rgt1 from low-glucose grown cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, lane 4). To confirm that this decreased mobility is due to phosphorylation, we treated protein extracts from high-glucose grown cells expressing HA-Rgt1 with &#x003bb;-phosphatase in the presence or absence of phosphatase inhibitors. The modified form of Rgt1 disappeared after treatment with &#x003bb;-phosphatase but remained in the presence of phosphatase inhibitors. This indicated that the modification was due to phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, lanes 2 and 3). Interestingly, Rgt1 in extracts from cells grown in the presence of low-glucose was also sensitive to &#x003bb;-phosphatase, indicating that Rgt1 is also phosphorylated in low glucose (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, lanes 5 and 6). Thus, the Rgt1 appeared to exist in three different phosphorylation states as resolved by its SDS&#x02013;PAGE mobility: (i) a hyperphosphorylated state during growth in high glucose, (ii) an additional phosphorylated state during growth in low glucose medium, and (iii) a dephosphorylated state when the protein extracts were treated with &#x003bb;-phosphatase.</p><p>Rgt1 hyperphosphorylation occurred rapidly (30 min) when the cells were shifted from low to high glucose medium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, lanes 2 and 5). Furthermore, this hyperphosphorylation was reversible when cells were reintroduced into low glucose media. During this event, the modified hyperphosphorylated form of Rgt1 rapidly disappeared (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, lanes 6 and 7).</p><p>These results indicated that Rgt1 undergoes hyperphosphorylation in response to high-glucose in accordance with previous results (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>). Our results also indicated that the basal phosphorylation state of Rgt1 is present in cells grown in low-glucose medium. The dephosphorylated state of Rgt1 was only detected after &#x003bb;-phosphatase treatment of cell extracts and is likely not of significant physiological relevance.</p></sec><sec><title>Tpk3 and Snf1 protein kinases regulate the Rgt1 phosphorylation state</title><p>In cells grown in high glucose, PKA and Rgt1 proteins are localized to the nucleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>) and PKA activity is stimulated by extracellular glucose. Thus, PKA is an intriguing candidate kinase that can directly hyperphosphorylate Rgt1. To determine whether PKA is responsible for Rgt1 modification, we used the double-disruption mutant strains of <italic>tpk1 tpk2 (tpk12); tpk1 tpk3 (tpk13) and tpk2 tpk3 (tpk23</italic>), each lacking two of the three possible catalytic subunits of PKA. The utilization of these double-mutant strains avoids redundant functions of the catalytic subunits of PKA. Rgt1 hyperphosphorylation was detected in <italic>tpk12</italic> cells grown in high-glucose medium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, lane 3), but it did not take place in the <italic>tpk13</italic> and <italic>tpk23</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, lanes 4 and 5). This suggests that PKA complexes containing the Tpk3 subunit is directly or indirectly responsible for this Rgt1 modification (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). To further confirm that the Tpk3 catalytic subunit of PKA is involved in Rgt1 hyperphosphorylation, we also used a <italic>tpk3&#x00394;</italic> single-mutant strain. Rgt1 hyperphosphorylation was not detected in <italic>tpk3&#x00394;</italic> mutant cells grown in high-glucose medium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, lane 9) indicating that Tpk3 is responsible for Rgt1 hyperphosphorylation.</p><p>Interestingly, the observed phosphorylation of Rgt1 under conditions of low-glucose growth was abolished in the <italic>snf1</italic> mutant strain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, lane 4). Furthermore, this phosphorylation was induced in <italic>reg1</italic> mutants lacking the regulatory subunit of the Reg1-Glc7 protein phosphatase complex under conditions of high glucose (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>, lane 3). Since the Snf1 protein kinase is highly active in <italic>reg1</italic> mutant cells during high-glucose growth, this suggests an essential role of Snf1 in the phosphorylation of Rgt1 under conditions of glucose limitation. Taken together, these results suggest that Rgt1 phosphorylation, in response to glucose limitation, is dependent on Snf1 protein kinase activity, and Rgt1 hyperphosphorylation, in response to high-glucose levels, is Tpk3-dependent.</p></sec><sec><title>Snf1-dependent phosphorylation of Rgt1 promotes DNA binding to the <italic>HXK2</italic> promoter and Tpk3-dependent hyperphosphorylation of Rgt1 promotes DNA release from the <italic>HXK2</italic> promoter</title><p>Previous reports have demonstrated that Rgt1 binds to the RGT1-binding site in the <italic>HXK2</italic> promoter during low-glucose conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>). As shown above, in low glucose medium, Rgt1 is phosphorylated by the Snf1 protein kinase or by an Snf1-dependent kinase. Consequently, we investigated whether the phosphorylation state of Rgt1 determines the ability of this protein to bind to its target in the <italic>HXK2</italic> promoter both <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic>. To test this hypothesis, we used ChIP and gel electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSAs). Our results showed that in cells grown in low glucose medium, Rgt1 was recruited to the <italic>HXK2</italic> promoter in the three <italic>tpk</italic> mutant strains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>, a, lanes 2&#x02013;4). Conversely, in high glucose medium, Rgt1 binding to the <italic>HXK2</italic> promoter was abolished in the <italic>tpk12</italic> mutant, but not in <italic>tpk13</italic> and <italic>tpk23</italic> mutant cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>, b, lanes 2-4). From these results, we propose that Tpk3 protein kinase activity is necessary for <italic>in vivo</italic> Rgt1 release from the <italic>HXK2</italic> promoter. In the <italic>snf1</italic> mutant strain, Rgt1 was recruited to the <italic>HXK2</italic> promoter in the presence of high glucose, but no binding to the <italic>HXK2</italic> promoter was detected in low-glucose medium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>, b and a, lane 5). This result suggests a direct correlation between <italic>in vivo</italic> Snf1-dependent phosphorylation of Rgt1, and its binding activity to the <italic>HXK2</italic> promoter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>, a, lane 5). The binding of Rgt1 to the <italic>HXK2</italic> promoter in <italic>snf1</italic> mutant cells grown in the presence of high glucose (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>, b, lane 5) is not completely understood. One possible explanation could be that partial Rgt1 phosphorylation by an unknown protein kinase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, lane 2) could allow Rgt1 binding to the <italic>HXK2</italic> promoter during high-glucose growth. No DNA amplification was observed when we used cells with untagged Rgt1. This result demonstrates that the observed signals are dependent on the HA-tagged protein.</p><p>Next, we determined whether the presence or absence of Snf1 and Tpk3 proteins could induce differential band shifting with nuclear extracts prepared from wild-type and <italic>snf1&#x00394;</italic>, <italic>tpk12&#x00394; and tpk23&#x00394;</italic> mutant strains. To accomplish this, we used the RGT1 element of the <italic>HXK2</italic> promoter in EMSAs. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>, we observed a retarded DNA&#x02013;protein complex (CI) with nuclear extracts from wild-type cells grown in low-glucose medium, but not in high-glucose grown cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>, lanes 8 and 9). The CI complex was also detected by using nuclear extracts from both <italic>tpk</italic> mutant cells grown in low-glucose medium, and nuclear extracts from <italic>tpk23</italic> mutant cells grown in high-glucose medium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>, lanes 5&#x02013;7). However, the CI complex was not formed with extracts from <italic>snf1&#x00394;</italic> mutant cells grown in low-glucose medium, or the <italic>tpk12</italic> mutant cells grown in high-glucose medium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>, lanes 3 and 4). The specificity of this binding was demonstrated by competition assays with non-labelled oligonucleotides (data not shown). Together, these results suggest the involvement of Snf1 protein kinase in the control of Rgt1-binding activity to the <italic>HXK2</italic> promoter. The Tpk3 protein kinase activity is also necessary for Rgt1 release from the <italic>HXK2</italic> promoter in cells grown in the presence of high-glucose.</p></sec><sec><title>Snf1 protein kinase regulates <italic>HXK2</italic> gene expression</title><p>To gain more insight into the relationship between the Rgt1 phosphorylation state, its DNA-binding activity, and <italic>HXK2</italic> gene expression, we used <italic>snf1&#x00394;</italic> and <italic>tpk3&#x00394;</italic> mutant strains transformed with a single copy of the yeast reporter plasmid YIp357/HXK2<sub>+404</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref>) integrated at the <italic>URA3</italic> locus. Since the <italic>HXK2</italic> promoter drives glucose-regulated expression of the reporter gene, we measured &#x003b2;-galactosidase activity in the presence of high and low levels of glucose. We found that, in low glucose-grown cells, <italic>lacZ</italic> expression increased 12-fold in <italic>snf1</italic> mutant cells with respect to the basal level detected in wild-type cells grown in low-glucose medium. The deletion of the <italic>TPK3</italic> gene did not affect &#x003b2;-galactosidase activity. Conversely, in high glucose-grown cells, <italic>SNF1</italic> and <italic>TPK3</italic> gene deletions did not affect expression of the reporter gene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). Thus, from these experiments, a clear relationship between Snf1-dependent phosphorylation state of Rgt1 and <italic>HXK2</italic> gene expression can be deduced. Surprisingly, the absence of Tpk3 protein did not induce <italic>HXK2</italic> gene repression in high glucose grown cells.</p></sec><sec><title>Rgt1 interacts with Med8 and Hxk2 in a glucose-dependent manner</title><p>As we have demonstrated previously, Rgt1 and Med8 form part of a DNA&#x02013;protein complex that interacts with the RGT1 and DRS regulatory elements of the <italic>HXK2</italic> gene promoter, respectively. Although, Rgt1 only binds to DNA in a glucose-dependent manner, both Med8 and Rgt1 functions are required to repress <italic>HXK2</italic> expression in low-glucose medium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>). However, a direct or indirect interaction between Rgt1 and Med8 proteins has not yet been demonstrated. Furthermore, Hxk2 is involved in a positive feedback loop that serves to amplify its own expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>), and in the presence of high-glucose, the Med8 protein interacts with Hxk2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>). Thus, it was plausible to postulate that Hxk2 could be directly or indirectly involved in the control of Rgt1 repression of the <italic>HXK2</italic> gene. To test this hypothesis, we examined potential interactions of Rgt1 with Med8 and Hxk2 by yeast two-hybrid assays. The pGBKT7/RGT1 plasmid (Materials and Methods) was introduced together with a plasmid expressing a fusion of the Gal4 activation domain with Med8, or one with Hxk2 into an appropriate reporter strain. The interaction was monitored in low- and high-glucose conditions by determining &#x003b2;-galactosidase expression levels.</p><p>As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>, full-length Rgt1 did not interact with Med8 in the presence of high glucose. However, a strong interaction occurred within 5 min after shifting the cells from medium containing high glucose to low glucose. On the other hand, full-length Rgt1 interacts with Hxk2 in the presence of high glucose, but does not interact at low glucose concentrations.</p><p>To identify the domains of Hxk2 that are important for interaction with Rgt1, sub-fragments of Hxk2 were similarly tested for its interaction with Rgt1. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>, Hxk2-416, Hxk2-136 and Hxk2-87 proteins were not able to interact with full-length Rgt1 in the presence of high glucose. These results indicate that the interacting domain of Hxk2 might include a motif in its C-terminal region that is essential in this function. An alternative possibility is that the deletions introduced a structural modification, preventing the interaction, despite the presence of the interacting motif. The lack of interaction cannot be attributed to lack of expression, as the GAD-Hxk2-416, Hxk2-136 and Hxk2-87 fusion proteins were detected by western blotting using anti-Hxk2 antibody (data not shown).</p><p>The interaction between Rgt1 and Hxk2 was confirmed by immunoprecipitation assays in cells expressing HA-Rgt1 and Hxk2. Cell extracts were immunoprecipitated with the antibodies indicated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>. The resulting immunoprecipitates were assayed for the presence of Rgt1 by immunoblot analysis with anti-HA antibodies. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>, a signal for Rgt1 was observed only with samples immunoprecipitated with an anti-Hxk2 antibody (lane 3). In control reactions, no signals were obtained when the experiment was done without any antibodies, the anti-Pho4 antibody, or extracts from the <italic>hxk2&#x00394;</italic> mutant strain (lanes 1, 2 and 4). Thus, this interaction is dependent on the production of HA-tagged Rgt1 and Hxk2. Since some unknown proteins in the extract could mediate the interaction between Hxk2 and Rgt1, we tested for the direct interaction between Rgt1 with Hxk2 using pull-down assays. We used purified Hxk2 protein and a bacterially produced GST-Rgt1 fusion protein. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref> (lane 2), strong and specific retention was detected with the sample containing the purified GST-Rgt1 fusion protein. No signal was detected when purified GST was used in the experiment (lane 3). To confirm the Rgt1&#x02013;Med8 interaction, we performed GST pull-down experiments with crude protein extracts and a purified GST-Rgt1 fusion protein. The extracts were obtained from yeast cells grown in SE (low-glucose) media with selection for plasmid maintenance. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>, a clear retention of Med8 protein was observed for the samples containing GST-Rgt1, and in crude extracts from the wild-type yeast strain W303-1A expressing a Med8 HA-tagged protein (lane 3). When a control with GST protein in the reaction mixture was used, no signal was observed (lane 2).</p></sec><sec><title>Snf1 protein kinase modulates Rgt1 interaction with Med8 and Hxk2</title><p>Our yeast two-hybrid data indicated that Rgt1 interacts with Med8 and Hxk2 in a glucose-dependent manner.

Because the dephosphorylated form of Rgt1 was detected in the <italic>&#x00394;snf1</italic> cells grown in low-glucose medium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>), its failure to interact with Med8 could be a consequence of the different phosphorylation states the two proteins.

However, a strong interaction occurred within 5 min after shifting the cells from medium containing high glucose to low glucose medium. On the other hand, full-length Rgt1 interacted with Hxk2 in the presence of high glucose, but did not interact in low glucose concentration. As shown above, identical results were obtained with the wild-type strain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). Our data suggest that Rgt1 interaction with Med8 and Hxk2 does not require its Tpk3-dependent phosphorylation.</p></sec><sec><title>Rgt1 and Med8 forms loops in the <italic>HXK2</italic> gene regulatory region via protein&#x02013;protein interactions</title><p>Once we identified the <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic> interaction of Rgt1 with Med8, and demonstrated that Snf1-dependent phosphorylation of Rgt1 regulates the binding activity between both proteins, a logical question to ask was whether <italic>in vivo</italic> binding of Rgt1 and Med8 affects DNA secondary structure. This may include modifications such as looping, which could bring the Rgt1 and Med8 distal-binding sites into close proximity. To address this issue, we used a formaldehyde crosslinking-immunoprecipitation assay (ChIP) with cells grown in low-glucose containing medium.</p><p>The results indicate that our chromatin sonication protocol breaks the DNA between the Med8 and Rgt1-binding sites, because no amplification was detected by using primer pair 7+10 for PCR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref>, lane 6). Interestingly, significant levels of the upstream <italic>HXK2</italic> regulatory region containing the Rgt1-binding site were found when DNA&#x02013;protein complexes were immunoprecipitated with the anti-Med8 antibody (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref>, lane 7).

This co-immunoprecipitation of the DNA containing the MED8 element with anti-Rgt1 antibody, and the DNA containing the RGT1 element with anti-Med8 antibody, can only be explained if Rgt1 and Med8 proteins interact during the formaldehyde crosslinking step of the ChIP experiment.</p><p>However, no amplification was detected by using primer pair 7+10 for PCR in both anti-Med8 and anti-Rgt1 antibody for immunoprecipitations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref>, lane 9).

This control experiment suggests that the observed signals are HA-Rgt1 or HA-Med8 dependent.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>These studies were undertaken to address the mechanisms of transcriptional control of the <italic>HXK2</italic> gene. Hxk2 is the protein that initiates the intracellular metabolism of glucose by phosphorylation at C6, but Hxk2 also plays a vital role in glucose repression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>). A cellular fraction of this protein has a glucose-regulated nuclear localization and operates by interacting with Mig1 to generate a repressor complex in the nucleus of <italic>S.cerevisiae</italic> during growth in glucose (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>). Similarly, recent studies in mammalian hepatic cells suggest that glucokinase (GK), the type IV isoenzyme of hexokinase (HKIV), has the capacity to enter the nucleus where it is essential to control the activity of transcriptional factors like ChREBP and SREBP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">38</xref>). All these factors participate, by direct binding to DNA, and regulate the transcription of several genes involved in glucose metabolism and lipogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">39</xref>). An increasing amount of biochemical and genetic evidence points to the possibility that Hxk2 and HKIV could function through similar mechanisms in glucose signalling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">40</xref>). Thus, experiments to elucidate the transcriptional control of the <italic>HXK2</italic> gene are of maximal significance.</p><p>In this paper, we present a molecular analysis of Rgt1, a transcriptional regulator which together with the Med8 protein, regulates the <italic>HXK2</italic> gene expression in a glucose dependent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>). The correlation between the Rgt1 phosphorylation state, DNA-binding activity to the <italic>HXT1 cis</italic>-acting elements, and <italic>HXT1</italic> gene transcription is well established (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">41</xref>). However, the impact of Rgt1 on the <italic>HXK2</italic> transcription has never been assessed properly. Here, we show through western analyses in different media and by using several null-mutant strains that Snf1 and Tpk3 protein kinases couple glucose levels to Rgt1 phosphorylation state. This affects the DNA-binding activity of Rgt1 and regulates the transcription of the <italic>HXK2</italic> gene through its protein&#x02013;protein interacting activity. The results presented here suggest that the Snf1 protein kinase is involved directly or indirectly in the activation function of Rgt1 as a repressor. Deletion of the <italic>SNF1</italic> gene results in a dephosphorylated Rgt1 protein with neither DNA-binding activity nor <italic>HXK2</italic> repression in low-glucose medium. Moreover, in <italic>reg1</italic> mutants lacking the regulatory subunit of the Reg1&#x02013;Glc7 protein phosphatase complex and possessing constitutive Snf1 protein kinase activity Rgt1 phosphorylation is induced during glucose growth. These observations reaffirm previous observations on the regulation of <italic>HXTs</italic> genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">41</xref>) and implicate the Rgt1 mechanism to <italic>HXK2</italic> transcriptional regulation. Our results also suggest that the Tpk3 catalytic subunit of cAMP-dependent protein kinase is essential for Rgt1 release from the <italic>HXK2</italic> promoter. Deletion of the <italic>TPK3</italic> gene results in a loss of hyperphosphorylated Rgt1 and an increase of DNA binding activity in the presence of high-glucose.</p><p><italic>HXK2</italic> transcriptional repression is dependent on the binding of Rgt1 and Med8 to their target DNA elements within the <italic>HXK2</italic> promoter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>). Interestingly, the data presented here suggests that an interaction between Rgt1 and Med8 is also essential for the repression of Rgt1 function. This idea is supported by the following findings: (i) deletion of <italic>SNF1</italic> gene prevents Rgt1 binding to the <italic>HXK2</italic> promoter in yeast cells growing in low-glucose medium and activates <italic>HXK2</italic> gene expression, (ii) deletion of <italic>SNF1</italic> gene prevents Rgt1 interaction with Med8 in low-glucose growing cells, (iii) deletion of the <italic>TPK3</italic> gene prevents Rgt1 release from the <italic>HXK2</italic> promoter in yeast cells growing in high-glucose medium, but does not affect <italic>HXK2</italic> gene expression, (iv) Rgt1 does not interact with Med8 in the presence of high-glucose, and (v) proper <italic>HXK2</italic> repression only occurs in low-glucose, when Rgt1 is bound to the <italic>HXK2</italic> promoter and the interaction between Rgt1 and Med8 takes place.</p><p>Our results also demonstrate that Rgt1 interacts directly with Hxk2 and Med8 in a glucose-dependent manner, and that the C-terminal domain of the Hxk2 protein is required for the Hxk2&#x02013;Rgt1 interaction. Since the C-terminal domain of the Hxk2 protein is also necessary for Med8 interaction in the presence of high glucose (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>), a possible competition between the Med8 and Rgt1 proteins for Hxk2 binding could be established during growth on high glucose. However, an alternative possibility is that the Hxk2 C-terminal deletions have introduced structural modifications, preventing the interaction between Hxk2 and Rgt1 proteins despite the presence of the interacting motif.</p><p>The data presented above raises the issue about the influence of Snf1 and Tpk3-dependent phosphorylation of Rgt1 in its interaction with Med8 and Hxk2. Our results show that regulation of Rgt1 interaction with Med8 through Snf1-mediated phosphorylation is a key molecular switch that controls <italic>HXK2</italic> repression. In cells grown in low glucose, the RGT1 element of the <italic>HXK2</italic> promoter is occupied by the phosphorylated Rgt1, which interacts with Med8. This Rgt1 phosphorylation is important both for DNA and protein interaction. Under high-glucose conditions, Rgt1 is hyperphosphorylated in a Tpk3-dependent manner. Thus, Tpk3-mediated hyperphosphorylation of Rgt1 is a prerequisite for DNA release, but is not necessary to induce Rgt1 interaction with Hxk2.</p><p>A simplified diagram of how nutritional signals converge on Rgt1 through the Snf1 and Tpk3 protein kinases, according to our results, is presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>. The glucose-regulated interaction of Rgt1 with Med8 and Hxk2 was proposed. This creates specific structures at the <italic>HXK2</italic> promoter that would accommodate differences in the spacing of regulatory DNA elements and influence chromatin structure. Chromatin looping as a result of remote sequences being brought close together might be involved in gene activation or repression by the binding of components of the basal transcription machinery. This would facilitate or make difficult the formation of active transcriptional complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">42</xref>). In fact, chromatin looping was detected recently in mammalian loci for &#x003b2;-globin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b43">43</xref>), the Igf2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b44">44</xref>) and Dlx5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b45">45</xref>). Our results suggest that <italic>HXK2</italic> regulation results from the formation of a loop in the DNA that includes the promoter and the coding region of the <italic>HXK2</italic> gene between the Rgt1 and Med8 binding sites.</p><p>The interaction between Rgt1 and Med8 provides a new mechanism for modulating the transcriptional response of the <italic>HXK2</italic> promoter to low glucose. We propose that this mechanism acts in concert with Snf1 or an Snf1-dependent protein kinase to initiate Rgt1 binding to the <italic>HXK2</italic> promoter in low glucose. Conversely, the Tpk3 catalytic subunit of PKA initiates Rgt1 release from the <italic>HXK2</italic> promoter in high-glucose conditions.</p><p>These results suggest that <italic>HXK2</italic> transcription is repressed by the state of the chromatin over the promoter. The chromatin barrier over the <italic>HXK2</italic> promoter could be released by binding the hyperphosphorylated Rgt1 to the Hxk2 nuclear protein. This Rgt1 sequestering results in the observed activation of the <italic>HXK2</italic> expression, as it would make the promoter accessible to the RNA II polymerase complex, as well as to other mediator factors. Thus, our model also explains how Hxk2 is involved in a positive-feedback loop that serves to amplify its own expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>).</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>We are very grateful to J.
