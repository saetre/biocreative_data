Enzymatic activities of TS:C43A and TS:C210A mutant proteins were nearly identical to wild-type TS, while TS:C180A and TS:C199A mutants expressed &#x0003e;80&#x00025; of wild-type enzyme activity. In contrast, TS:C195A was completely inactive. Mutant proteins, TS:C195A, TS:C199A and TS:C210A, retained RNA binding activity to nearly the same degree as wild-type human TS. RNA binding activity of TS:C43A was reduced by 30&#x00025; when compared to wild-type TS, while TS:C180A was completely devoid of RNA binding activity. <italic>In vitro</italic> translation studies confirmed that mutant proteins TS:C43A, TS:C195A, TS:C199A and TS:C210A, significantly repressed human TS mRNA translation, while TS:C180A was unable to do so. To confirm the <italic>in vivo</italic> significance of the cysteine sulfhydryl residue, mutant proteins TS:C180A and TS:C195A were each expressed in human colon cancer HCT-C18:TS(&#x02013;) cells that expressed a functionally inactive TS. A recombinant luciferase reporter gene under the control of a TS-response element was co-transfected into these same cells, and luciferase activity increased in the presence of the TS:C195A mutant TS protein to a level similar to that observed upon expression of wild-type TS protein. In contrast, luciferase activity remained unchanged in cells expressing the TS:C180A mutant protein. Taken together, these findings identify Cys-180 as a critical residue for the <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> translational regulatory effects of human TS.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Thymidylate synthase (TS) is a folate-dependent enzyme that catalyzes the reductive methylation of 2&#x02032;-deoxyuridine-5&#x02032;-monophosphate (dUMP) by the reduced folate 5, 10-methylenetetrahydrofolate (CH<sub>2</sub>FH<sub>4</sub>) to yield thymidine-5&#x02032;-monophosphate (dTMP, thymidylate) and dihydrofolate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg678c1">1</xref>). Once synthesized, dTMP is phosphorylated within the cell by two successive enzymatic steps to dTTP, an essential precursor for DNA biosynthesis and DNA repair. Because this enzymatic reaction provides the sole intracellular <italic>de novo</italic> source of dTMP, TS is a critical therapeutic target in cancer chemotherapy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg678c2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg678c3">3</xref>).</p><p>In addition to its role in enzyme catalysis, TS also functions as an RNA binding protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg678c4">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg678c8">8</xref>). Specifically, translation of human TS mRNA is negatively regulated by direct binding of TS to two different <italic>cis</italic>-acting elements on its cognate mRNA. The first element is a 30-nt sequence contained within the 5&#x02032;-untranslated region (UTR) and includes the translational start site in a stable stem&#x02013;loop structure. The second binding site is a 70-nt sequence in the protein-coding region corresponding to nucleotides 480&#x02013;550 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg678c9">9</xref>). <italic>In vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> studies have shown that each site can function independently of one another. However, both elements are required for the complete translational autoregulatory effects of TS.</p><p>There is growing evidence that the RNA binding activity of TS is affected by its state of ligand occupancy. When TS is ligand-free, maximal RNA binding activity is maintained, resulting in translational repression of TS mRNA. However, when TS is bound by either of its physiologic substrates, dUMP or CH<sub>2</sub>FH<sub>4</sub>, bound by the 5-FU metabolite FdUMP, or bound by an antifolate analog such as raltitrexed (ZD1694), RNA binding activity is markedly reduced. The net effect of ligand binding is abrogation of translational repression, resulting in synthesis of new TS protein.</p><p>Previous studies have shown that sulfhydryl group modification of TS significantly decreases enzymatic activity and its ability to form a stable ternary complex with the reduced folate CH<sub>2</sub>THF and FdUMP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg678c10">10</xref>). Earlier work from our own laboratory showed that the redox state of the protein was a critical determinant of RNA binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg678c11">11</xref>). In the presence of reducing agents, such as 2-mercaptoethanol and&#x0002f;or dithiothreitol, the RNA binding activity of TS was significantly enhanced. In contrast, treatment with the oxidizing agent diamide or N-ethylmaleimide, significantly inhibited RNA binding activity. These studies suggested that the interaction between TS protein and its target TS mRNA was mediated by a reversible sulfhydryl switch mechanism and required the presence of at least one free sulfhydryl group.</p><p>In the present report, we investigated the role of the cysteine amino acid residues on the RNA binding activity of TS. For these studies, we used site-directed mutagenesis to express and purify mutant proteins corresponding to each cysteine moiety as well as RNA gel shift and <italic>in vitro</italic> translation assays to determine the RNA binding activity of these mutant proteins. The results presented herein demonstrate that Cys-180 of human TS plays a critical role in mediating RNA recognition.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Cell culture</title><p>The human colon cancer HCT-C18 cell has been previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg678c12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg678c13">13</xref>) and was a kind gift of Dr Sondra Berger.

Wild-type and mutant TS proteins were then expressed and purified to homogeneity. We first determined whether mutation of any one of the cysteine residues resulted in loss of catalytic activity, using the well-characterized TS catalytic assay. As seen in Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="gkg678tb1">1</xref>, mutant proteins TS:C43A and TS:C210A expressed completely intact enzymatic activity when compared to wild-type TS protein. TS:C180A and TS:C199A mutants expressed &#x0003e;80&#x00025; of wild-type enzyme activity. In contrast, TS:C195A was catalytically inactive. These studies confirmed that the cysteine amino acid residue at position 195, which resides in the nucleotide-binding domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg678c20">20</xref>), is essential for TS catalytic activity.</p><p>We next performed a series of RNA gel-mobility shift experiments to determine the effect of the respective C&#x02192;A mutations on RNA binding activity. RNA binding experiments confirmed that three of the mutant proteins, TS:C43A (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg678f2">2</xref>, lane 3), TS:C195A (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg678f2">2</xref>, lane 5) and TS:C210A (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg678f2">2</xref>, lane 6), interacted with human TS mRNA probe to the same degree as wild-type TS (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg678f2">2</xref>, lane 2). The binding activity of TS:C199A was reduced by nearly 30&#x00025; when compared with wild-type TS (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg678f2">2</xref>, lane 6). Of note, the RNA binding activity of the TS:C180A protein was completely abrogated (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg678f2">2</xref>, lane 4).</p><p>The binding affinities of wild-type and mutant TS proteins, as measured by the apparent dissociation constants (<italic>K</italic><sub>d</sub>), were then determined using the well-established Scatchard analysis. As seen in Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="gkg678tb2">2</xref>, mutant proteins TS:C43A (<italic>K</italic><sub>d</sub>, 2.8 nM), TS:C195A (<italic>K</italic><sub>d</sub>, 3.0 nM) and TS:C210A (<italic>K</italic><sub>d</sub>, 2.9 nM) bound to TS mRNA with an affinity nearly identical to that of wild-type TS (<italic>K</italic><sub>d</sub>, 2.9 nM). The TS:C199A mutant protein displayed partially decreased RNA binding affinity by &#x0223c;30&#x00025; when compared to wild-type TS (<italic>K</italic><sub>d</sub>, 4.3 nM). In contrast, the binding affinity of TS:C180A was dramatically reduced by &#x0003e;100-fold (<italic>K</italic><sub>d</sub>, &#x0003e; 300 nM).</p><p>To begin to determine the functional consequences of mutations of the cysteine residues, we employed a rabbit reticulocyte lysate <italic>in vitro</italic> translation system to investigate their effects on the translational repressive activity of TS. When human TS mRNA was incubated in the lysate reaction mixture, the corresponding <italic>in vitro</italic> translation products were observed at 37 kDa for TS (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg678f3">3</xref>, lane 1). In the presence of exogenous wild-type TS, dose-dependent inhibition of TS mRNA translation was observed (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg678f3">3</xref>, wild-type TS). The same level of translational repression was also observed when human TS mRNA was incubated with mutant proteins, TS:C43A, TS:C195A, TS:C199A and TS:C210A (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg678f3">3</xref>). In contrast, the translational inhibitory effect was nearly completely abrogated when TS:C180A was included in the rabbit lysate reaction (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg678f3">3</xref>). These studies suggest that Cys-180 is required to maintain the translational repressive effects of TS protein <italic>in vitro</italic>.</p><p>We next investigated the potential <italic>in vivo</italic> biological significance of the cysteine residue. For this series of experiments, we used human colon cancer HCT-C18 cells which express a functionally inactive TS and the p644&#x0002f;TS:N25 luciferase reporter construct. In previously published studies, we had used an <italic>in vitro</italic> RNA selection method in which a completely degenerate, linear RNA pool of 25 nt was incubated with human recombinant TS protein. The TS:N25 sequence was isolated after 10 rounds of selection and amplification, and <italic>in vitro</italic> RNA binding studies revealed that this selected sequence bound human recombinant TS protein with nearly 20-fold higher affinity than native, wild-type TS RNA sequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg678c18">18</xref>). The cDNA sequence corresponding to TS:N25 RNA was then cloned onto the upstream of luciferase gene to yield the heterologous luciferase reporter plasmid, p644&#x0002f;TS:N25. <italic>In vivo</italic> transfection experiments confirmed that the TS:N25 sequence functioned as a positive enhancer element in that luciferase activity was significantly increased by nearly 3-fold in human colon cancer HCT-C18-TS(&#x0002b;) cells which overexpress human TS, but not in HCT-C18 cells, which express a functionally inactive TS. RNase protection assays revealed that the significant changes in luciferase activity was not associated with corresponding changes in luciferase mRNA levels. These findings suggested that the biological effects of the selected TS:N25 sequence were mediated at the translational level.</p><p>In the present study, we co-transfected HCT-C18 cells with either parent luciferase plasmid p644 or the p644&#x0002f;TS:N25 heterologous plasmid along with a plasmid expressing either wild-type TS &#x0005b;pcDNA3.1(&#x0002b;):His-TS&#x0005d; or plasmids expressing mutant TS:C180A &#x0005b;pcDNA3.1(&#x0002b;):His-TS&#x0002f;C180A&#x0005d; or TS: C195A TS proteins &#x0005b;pcDNA3.1(&#x0002b;):His-TS&#x0002f;C195A&#x0005d;. As seen in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg678f4">4</xref>, luciferase activity was increased by nearly 2.5-fold in cells expressing either wild-type TS or TS:C195A mutant protein. In contrast, luciferase activity remained unchanged in cells expressing the TS:C180A mutant TS protein following transfection with p644&#x0002f;TS:N25 when compared to transfection with p644.</p></sec><sec><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>In the present study, we performed a series of experiments to identify the amino acid residues on human TS protein that are required for RNA recognition. For this work, we used a site-directed mutagenesis strategy to express and purify mutant TS proteins. In this initial series of experiments, we focused our efforts on expressing mutant proteins with mutations at the critical cysteine residues, of which there are five located at amino acid residues 43, 180, 195, 199 and 210. The rationale for focusing on these particular residues was based on earlier work from our laboratory that demonstrated that the redox state of the protein was a critical determinant of RNA binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg678c11">11</xref>). In the presence of a reducing environment with either 2-ME or DTT, the RNA binding activity of human TS was significantly enhanced. However, treatment of human TS with either of the oxidizing agents diamide or N-ethylmaleimide, significantly repressed RNA binding activity. These studies suggested that the interaction between TS protein and its target TS mRNA was mediated by a reversible sulfhydryl switch mechanism and involved at least one cysteine amino acid residue. However, this initial work was unable to identify the specific cysteine residue responsible for this effect.</p><p>Our findings demonstrate that mutations at cysteine residues 43, 195, 199 and 210 do not impair the RNA binding activity of TS nor do these mutations appear to significantly alter the translational repressive effects of the protein. In contrast, the TS:C180A mutant protein, which retains nearly complete catalytic activity when compared to wild-type TS, is completely devoid of RNA binding activity and is unable to inhibit TS mRNA translation. The fact that a catalytically active TS, such as TS:C180A, has lost RNA binding function and that a catalytically inactive TS, such as TS:C195A, is able to maintain RNA binding activity provides additional evidence that the functions of RNA binding and enzyme catalysis are not mediated by the same domain(s) on the TS protein. To provide further support for the biological effects of this specific mutation, <italic>in vivo</italic> transfection experiments were performed. As seen in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg678f4">4</xref>, transient transfection experiments using a reporter luciferase construct, under the control of an enhancer TS-response element, revealed a marked increase in luciferase activity in cells expressing wild-type TS or TS:C195A mutant protein. In contrast, luciferase activity remained unchanged in cells expressing the TS:C180A mutant TS protein. Taken together, these findings highlight the critical role of Cys-180 in mediating the translational regulatory function of human TS <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p><p>Several studies have focused on characterizing the molecular elements that mediate the interaction between RNA binding proteins and their target RNA. The R17 bacteriophage coat protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg678c21">21</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg678c23">23</xref>), aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg678c24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg678c25">25</xref>) and iron-responsive factor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg678c26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg678c27">27</xref>) represent three well-characterized RNA binding proteins. In each instance, a free cysteine sulfhydryl group(s) on the RNA binding protein forms a covalent Michael adduct with the C-6 position on the corresponding uracil ring of the target RNA. In the present case, it is clear that the sulfhydryl residue at Cys-180 is critical for RNA binding. However, the precise mechanism by which this specific amino acid moiety mediates its effects on RNA binding remains unclear. There are, at least, three potential mechanisms by which it might be exerting its effects. First, the cysteine sulfhydryl may form a direct Michael adduct with the C-6 position of a uracil ring on TS mRNA. Second, occupation of the cysteine residue may result in altered RNA binding through a steric hindrance mechanism. Finally, this cysteine may be critical in maintaining TS in a certain conformational structure that then allows the actual domain on the protein to be readily accessible for RNA binding.</p><p>Previous work from this laboratory revealed that <italic>E.coli</italic> TS proteins with point mutations in the nucleotide-binding domain were able to retain their RNA binding function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg678c11">11</xref>). The only mutant protein that lost RNA binding activity was the one at Cys-146 (C146S). Of note, for the <italic>E.coli</italic> species this represents the active site cysteine residue. In contrast, RNA binding activity was completely abrogated in mutant proteins with point mutations in the folate-binding region of <italic>E.coli</italic> TS, including the C50F mutant protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg678c11">11</xref>). These initial studies suggested that the active site cysteine sulfyhydryl and the folate-binding domain may play an important role in the RNA binding activity of <italic>E.coli</italic> TS. Our findings with the human TS species differ somewhat from those obtained with the <italic>E.coli</italic> protein, in that a mutation at the active site cysteine of human TS did not impair the ability of the mutant protein to interact with its own cognate TS mRNA. In addition, a mutation in the cysteine residue of human TS at position 43, which is located in the folate-binding pocket, did not alter RNA binding function. The crystal structures of <italic>E.coli</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg678c28">28</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg678c30">30</xref>) and human TS have been resolved (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg678c31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg678c32">32</xref>), and the evidence, to date, suggests that the structures of these two species of TS may indeed be different. Taken together, our RNA binding studies would suggest that the main effect of the cysteine sulfhydryl residue is on maintaining the TS protein in a proper conformation that then allows for RNA binding to occur. However, to more directly address this issue, studies are underway in our laboratory to resolve the crystal structure of the human TS protein&#x02013;human TS mRNA complex.</p><p>Further studies are needed to more carefully elucidate the key molecular elements underlying the translational autoregulation of TS and the interaction between TS protein and its target mRNA. Our laboratory is presently dissecting the critical <italic>cis</italic>-elements on TS mRNA that are required for <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> RNA recognition. Studies are also in progress to determine the precise intracellular localization of the TS RNP complex in intact human colon cancer cells. Such work may help to further elucidate the biological significance of this particular RNP complex. In addition, mutant proteins with point mutations in the folate- and nucleotide-binding domain of human TS are being evaluated to determine their relative RNA binding activity. These studies should provide further insights as to the critical domain(s) on human TS that are required for the process of RNA binding. However, the work presented herein provides additional insights into the determinants that mediate the TS translational autoregulation. Finally, as the process of translational autoregulation is becoming an increasingly recognized mechanism for the control of gene expression, these studies may provide new insights that can be applied to the regulation of other critical cellular genes.</p></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="display-objects"><title>Figures and Tables</title><fig id="gkg678f1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p> Schematic diagram of expression plasmids of wild-type and mutant TS proteins.
