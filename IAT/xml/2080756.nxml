To identify the transcriptional response that is specific to DNA damage, we have modulated the first two enzymes in the base excision repair (BER) pathway generating yeast strains with varied levels of the repair intermediates, abasic sites or strand breaks. We show that the number of abasic sites is significantly increased when the 3-methyladenine DNA glycosylase (Mag): AP endonuclease (Apn1) ratio is increased and that spontaneous frame shift mutation is considerably elevated when either Mag, or Mag plus Apn1, expression is elevated. Expression profiling identified 633 ORFs with differential expression associated with BER modulation. Analysis of transcriptional networks associated with the accumulation of DNA repair intermediates identifies an enrichment for numerous biological processes. Moreover, most of the BER-activated transcriptional response was independent of the classical yeast environmental stress response (ESR). This study highlights that DNA damage in the form of abasic sites or strand breaks resulting from BER modulation is a trigger for substantial genome-wide change and that this response is largely ESR-independent. Taken together, these results suggest that a branch point exists in the current model for DNA damage-signaled transcription in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="9"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Previously, we have shown that yeast exposed to alkylating agents initiate a broad gene expression response modulating a staggering 30&#x00025; of the yeast genome, i.e. up to 2000 genes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001252-Jelinsky1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001252-Jelinsky2">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>. Upon exposure to exogenous alkylation damage, yeast respond by modulating a host of biological processes that includes, as expected, DNA repair and cell cycle checkpoint pathways, but also includes the following: (i) activation of protein degradation machinery, (ii) increased lipid metabolism, (iii) increased RNA processing and (iv) decreased protein synthesis (ribosomal biosynthesis) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001252-Jelinsky1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001252-Jelinsky2">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>. That numerous biological processes are modulated when yeast are exposed to alkylating agents likely reflects the fact that in addition to damaging DNA, these so-called &#x0201c;DNA damaging&#x0201d; agents also damage proteins, lipids and RNA. In addition, the expression of a core set of &#x0223c;900 genes changes under a variety of stressful conditions, including DNA damage, and is termed the environmental stress response (ESR) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001252-Gasch1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>. Here, we set out to identify the transcriptional response that is specifically caused by damage to DNA and not to other cellular molecules; instead of introducing damage with reactive electrophilic agents (e.g. an alkylating agent) we generated DNA damage by imbalancing the base excision repair (BER) pathway such that abasic sites or gaps and nicks accumulate in the genome during the processing of repairing endogenous DNA damage.</p><p>In its simplest form, the first two steps of the BER pathway are represented by a DNA glycosylase and an AP endonuclease. DNA glycosylases can recognize damaged bases and remove them via cleavage of the <italic>N</italic>-glycosidic bond to initiate BER. In <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> there are at least five distinct DNA glycosylases, namely Ung, Nth1, Nth2, Ogg1, and Mag, that collectively recognize damaged bases and process them to generate abasic sites. The abasic site is substrate for AP endonucleases that carry out the next step in BER. <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> has two distinct AP endonucleases, the major enzyme Apn1 and a damage-inducible enzyme, Apn2 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001252-Boiteux1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>. Apn1 and Apn2 cleave abasic sites 5&#x02032; to the site of base loss, generating a single strand break. The abasic sugar residue is removed by deoxyribophophodiesterase, the gap is filled by DNA polymerase and the remaining nick sealed by DNA ligase.</p><p>Across phylogeny, the regulation of enzymes involved in the first two steps of BER has been noted at the level of transcription. In <italic>E. coli</italic>, yeast, mouse and human cells, treatments with xenobiotics can induce the transcription of BER genes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001252-Cooper1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001252-Samson2">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>. The induced expression of such DNA repair pathways has long been thought to confer protection against both the killing and mutagenic effects of DNA damage <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001252-Friedberg1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>. However, it is now apparent that in some circumstances increased expression of DNA repair genes may actually lead to the accumulation of mutations. In fact, our previous studies demonstrated the generation of a strong mutator phenotype in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> and <italic>E. coli</italic> by imbalanced base excision repair <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001252-Glassner1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001252-Xiao1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>. Specifically, it was shown that Mag expression in yeast produces up to a 300-fold increase in the spontaneous base substitution mutation rate when Mag levels are high relative to Apn1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001252-Glassner1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>. It was suggested that such a dramatic increase in spontaneous mutation rate is due to the fact that Mag excises normal DNA bases, in addition to endogenously damaged bases, producing mutagenic AP sites that can be further processed into mutations by the <italic>Rev1/Rev3/Rev7</italic> lesion bypass polymerases <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001252-Glassner1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001252-Xiao1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001252-Memisoglu1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>In these studies, we explore how imbalanced BER affects the persistence of AP sites and frameshift mutations in yeast and how the accumulation of BER intermediates is linked to a DNA damage specific transcriptional response. We show that Mag expression in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> produces a 2- to 5-fold increase in AP sites, depending on the Mag:Apn1 ratio, an effect that mirrors the changes in spontaneous base substitution mutation rates in the same strains of yeast <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001252-Glassner1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>. This finding confirms the hypothesis that increased Mag:Apn1 ratios lead to an increased steady state level of mutagenic AP sites. Furthermore, frameshift mutations are elevated when Mag:Apn1 ratios are high and these mutations are reduced with increased expression of Apn1. These studies also show that in response to the DNA damage of accumulated BER repair intermediates, yeast respond by modulating the expression of &#x0223c;600 ORFs that are integrated into transcriptional networks encoding DNA replication/metabolism, protein transport, energy metabolism and ribosomal biosynthesis machinery. Surprisingly, this BER-modulated transcriptional response is largely independent of the environmental stress response (ESR), suggesting that a branch point exists in the current model for DNA damage signaled transcription.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Imbalance in the first two steps in BER leads to accumulation of AP sites</title><p>In this study, the first two enzymes in the BER pathway, Mag and Apn1, were modulated such that the BER intermediates, abasic sites or strand breaks, accumulate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001252-g001">Fig. 1</xref>).

As an alternative to introducing damage with reactive electrophilic agents (e.g. an alkylating agent), we generated DNA damage by imbalancing the base excision repair (BER) pathway such that abasic sites or gaps and nicks accumulate in the genome during the process of repairing endogenous DNA damage. Five yeast strains with altered expression levels of Apn1 and Mag were analyzed for the persistence of AP sites. Mag expression in the wild type host increased the steady-state level of genomic AP sites by &#x0223c;2.5 fold. As expected, when Mag was expressed in the &#x00394;<italic>apn1</italic> strain, AP sites were further elevated to &#x0223c;5-fold that in wild type, whereas coexpression of Apn1 with Mag in the &#x00394;<italic>apn1</italic> strain resulted in a dramatic decrease in the steady state level of AP sites. These results complement our findings for single base substitution mutation rates in the same strains of yeast where an increase in Mag: Apn1 ratio leads to the generation of a strong mutator phenotype in yeast <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001252-Glassner1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>. It was found that spontaneous mutations were increased several hundred fold when Mag expression was relatively high and Apn1 relatively low <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001252-Glassner1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001252-Xiao1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>. Intriguingly, while Mag expression in AP endonuclease-deficient yeast led to a nearly 300-fold increase in spontaneous mutation rate, here we observed only a 5-fold increase in steady state levels of AP sites. However, unlike the current experiments with logarithmically growing cells, spontaneous mutation rates were determined in stationary phase cells over a period of 14 days <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001252-Glassner1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001252-Xiao1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>. Since stationary phase yeast cells are known to exhibit significantly higher levels of oxidant production <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001252-Aguilaniu1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>, the difference in experimental conditions might account for this apparent divergence. Indeed, when AP sites were measured in 7 day old stationary phase cells, a further &#x0003e;10-fold increase in AP sites was detected in wild type and Mag expressing strains (data not shown). We further examined the BER modulated yeast strains for another type of spontaneous-induced damage, that of frame shift mutations. Similar to our results with spontaneous base substitution rates <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001252-Glassner1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001252-Xiao1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>, we find that Apn1 expression does not affect frame shift mutation rates. Mag expression, however, caused a dramatic increase in frame shift mutation rate when compared to the Apn1-deficient strain.</p><p>To determine the impact of the accumulation of DNA repair intermediates on gene expression, the five yeast strains with altered expression of BER repair enzymes were analyzed for differential gene expression. A total of 633 ORFs were identified with statistically significant changes in at least one condition compared to wild type yeast. The extent of change across the yeast genome in response to modulated BER expression was quite varied across the five experiments, with yeast expressing Mag (WT/p<italic>MAG</italic>) showing the most transcriptional change. It is noteworthy that even without exposure to any exogenous DNA damaging agents there is considerable gene expression change.</p><p>The genome-wide impact of the accumulation of DNA repair intermediates was compared to our previous results of gene expression changes in yeast upon exposure to an alkylating agent, namely methyl methanesulfonate (MMS) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001252-Jelinsky1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>. It was a surprise to find the expression patterns of the five yeast strains with modulated levels of BER were strikingly different from the expression patterns of yeast exposed to MMS. These differences in the expression patterns of the BER modulated yeast strains and yeast exposed to MMS may, in part, represent the difference between responses to an acute influx of damage, as for MMS, rather than a chronic exposure to damage, as would be generated by BER modulation.</p><p>To classify the biological processes and pathways that were affected by BER intermediate accumulation, the gene products of the transcripts that were modulated by BER intermediates, were overlayed on a functional yeast network <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001252-Lee1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>. A large interacting networks of proteins was identified that contained five transcriptionally enriched subnetworks. These subnetworks are encoded entirely by genes that are transcriptionally modulated by BER intermediate accumulation. These subnetworks are enriched for numerous biological processes including: protein biosynthesis, protein-mitochondrial targeting, energy pathways, chromatin assembly/disassembly, amino acid biosynthesis and DNA replication/metabolism. Three of these biological processes that are modulated by BER intermediate accumulation are transcriptionally activated; these are amino acid biosynthesis, DNA replication/metabolism, and energy pathways. The protein biosynthesis and protein-mitochondrial targeting processes are down regulated by BER intermediate accumulation.</p><p>The panel of biological processes that in this study are modulated by BER intermediate accumulation is strikingly absent of a number of cellular processes previously shown to be modulated in yeast exposed to the alkylating agent MMS <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001252-Jelinsky1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001252-Jelinsky2">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>. Notably missing from the list of biological processes modulated by endogenous DNA damage are (i) the 26S proteasome, (ii) lipid metabolism machinery, and (iii) RNA processing machinery. That these processes are modulated when yeast strains are exposed to exogenously generated alkylation damage likely represents the non-specific nature of the damage (e.g. damage to proteins, lipids and RNA) induced by alkylating agents.</p><p>To date, the proposed model of DNA damage-induced transcriptional response in yeast suggests that DNA damage signals for the modulation of &#x0223c;900 genes classified as the environmental stress response (ESR), but also the modulation of &#x0223c;50 cell cycle associated genes, and 9 genes termed the &#x0201c;DNA damage signature&#x0201d; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001252-Gasch2">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>. In addition to their response to DNA damaging agents, the ESR genes in yeast are also responsive to a host of changes in environmental conditions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001252-Gasch1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>. We set out to determine whether or not the transcriptional networks that were activated by the accumulation of BER intermediates were largely comprised of the ESR, as would be predicted by the current model of DNA damage-induced transcriptional response. The statistical enrichment of ESR genes was calculated for each of the subnetworks, as well as for the entire list of ORFs modulated by BER intermediate accumulation in the yeast strains. Surprisingly, the enrichment of the ESR in the set of 633 ORFs was not statistically significant. Furthermore, only one of the five subnetworks was significantly enriched for genes that belong to the ESR. All of the other subnetworks that were activated by the accumulation of BER intermediates were statistically ESR-independent.</p><sec id="s3a"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Our results show that imbalancing the BER pathway leads to an accumulation of repair intermediates, such as AP sites, and stimulates the induction of frame shift mutations. Furthermore, we show that the induction of DNA repair intermediates, even in the absence of an exogenous damaging agent, causes a profound change in gene expression <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>. This DNA damage-specific expression pattern of &#x0223c;600 ORFs varies markedly from the expression pattern produced by exogenous exposure to the alkyating agent MMS. The biological processes modulated by the presence of DNA repair intermediates include protein synthesis, protein targeting, amino acid biosynthesis, and chromatin assembly. Notably lacking from the biological processes modulated by DNA repair intermediates is that of the protein degradation machinery (e.g. 26S proteasome) which is robustly induced upon exposure to exogenous DNA damaging agents; this suggests that the trigger for upregulating the proteasome emanates from damaged molecules other than DNA, most likely from damaged proteins. The DNA damage-triggered transcripts encode molecular networks that are comprised of proteins involved, not surprisingly, in DNA replication/metabolism, but also in numerous other biological processes but that the triggered responses is largely ESR-independent. As the DNA damage-specific response to BER intermediates is largely ESR independent, these data suggest that a branch point in the current model of DNA damage-induced transcriptional signaling exists. This study highlights that DNA damage, specifically, is the trigger for the modulation of transcripts that encode proteins with broad biological functions.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Strains and plasmids</title><p><xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0001252-t001">Table 1</xref> lists the strains used in this study.
