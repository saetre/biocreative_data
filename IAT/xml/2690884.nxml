To investigate IR-induced tumour radio-resistance, a radiosensitive human squamous cell carcinoma tumour, SCC61, was passed and irradiated in vivo. Radioresistant tumours were selected and a tumour cell line, nu61, was isolated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">Khodarev et al. 2004</xref>). Analysis of the differences in gene expression between cells from differentially selected tumours demonstrated up-regulation of the genes in the Signal Transducer and Activator of Transcription 1 (Stat1) signalling pathway in radioresistant nu61 tumours compared with radiosensitive SCC61 tumours. Recently we and others reported that IR up-regulates Stat1 and a Stat1-dependent pathway in vitro and in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">Amundson et al. 2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">Khodarev et al. 2007</xref>) and tumour cells resistant to radiation are also resistant to interferon. These results suggested cross&#x02013;talk between pathways induced by interferons (IFN) and IR. We hypothesised that the development of resistance to the constitutively expressed Stat1 pathway in tumour cells is associated with suppression of the Stat1-dependent apoptotic pathways or/and clonal selection of the cells resistant to Stat1-dependent apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">Khodarev et al. 2007</xref>). Next, taking into account that the Stat1 pathway, at least in the context of IFN-signalling, leads to the induction of multiple cytokines, we hypothesised that some Stat1-dependent, pro-survival genes might encode soluble factors secreted by the Stat1 over-expressing cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">Khodarev et al. 2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">Brown et al. 2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">Lehrnbecher et al. 2008</xref>). Here we report that indeed apoptotic response in nu61 is impaired resulting in suppression of caspases 3, 7, 8 and 9. This impaired response leads to the resistance not only to IFNs and IR but also to death ligands of tumour necrosis factor alpha receptor (TNFR) superfamily. We also report that nu61 differentially express interleukin-6, interleukin-8 and soluble receptor of interleukin 6 (IL6, IL8 and sIL6R) and this expression is Stat1-dependent. Formation of IL6-IL8-dependent autocrine loops plays a role in nu61 resistance to IR and cytotoxic cytokines. Combined suppression of IL6 and IL8 signalling by neutralising antibodies led to sensitisation of nu61 to genotoxic stress. These data suggest IL6 and IL8 as potential targets for tumour radiosensitisation.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Cell lines</title><p>SCC61 and nu61 were cultured in Dulbecco modified Eagle's Media (DMEM-F12) (Invitrogen, CA, USA) supplemented with 20% fetal bovine serum, 2 mM L-glutamine, 100 U/ml penicillin/streptomycin.

In the current experiments we directly compared in vitro clonogenic survival of SCC61 and nu61. It has been shown previously that the parental SCC61 has very low clonogenic ability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">Quiet et al. 1991</xref>). We therefore used a relatively low range of doses (between 0 and 5 Gy). As is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, the major difference between the two cell lines was observed between 0 and 2 Gy as a pronounced shoulder in nu61. We used a biphasic model described in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">Hall 1988</xref>) and previously used by us for correlation of tumour radioresistance in vitro and in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b51">Weichselbaum and Beckett 1987</xref>). We found that between 2 and 5 Gy, D<sub>0</sub> values for SCC61 and nu61 were 0.66+/&#x02212;0.03 and 0.60+/&#x02212;0.07, respectively (mean &#x000b1; SE, <italic>p</italic> &#x0003e; 0.05).

We used PI staining at 48 h as an index of total cell death, and measured apoptosis by flow cytometry for detection of cells that express the proximal caspase-3 as described in <italic>Methods</italic>. All experiments were repeated at least three times, and representative data are shown. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, ionising radiation (6 Gy) induced 26.2% (23.3 &#x000b1; 8.3%) PI positive cells in SCC61 and 13.3% (10.33 &#x000b1; 3.4%) PI positive cells in nu61. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref> shows the same trend for the post-IR accumulation of caspase-3-positive cells in SCC61 and nu61 (see <italic>Methods</italic>). 29.6% (27.5 &#x000b1; 2.9%) of caspase-3-positive cells accumulated in SCC61 48 hours post-IR and only 10.3% (9.8 &#x000b1; 1.5%) in nu61 (<italic>p</italic> = 0.005).

Pretreatment of both cell lines with the caspase-inhibitor Z-Val-Ala-Asp (OCH<sub>3</sub>)-fluoromethylketone (Z-VAD-FMK) abolished apoptotic response to both IR and IFN&#x003b3; (data not shown). We concluded from these experiments that interferon and radiation-induced cell death can be accounted for by activation of caspase-3-mediated apoptosis, and the decrease in the apoptotic response, at least in part, accounts for the suppressed sensitivity to IFN and IR in nu61 relative to SCC61.</p></sec><sec><title>Resistance to IR and interferons correlates with the resistance to death ligands</title><p>We next tested the hypothesis that resistance to genotoxic stress and interferons correlates with the resistance to death ligands of TNFR superfamily. We studied the cytotoxic effects of TNF&#x003b1;, CH11 (FAS-activating antibody) and TRAIL (TNF-related apoptosis inducing ligand) in nu61 and SCC61 cells. As is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, each ligand, as well as irradiation and IFN&#x003b3;, led to significant apoptotic death in SCC61 compared to nu61 (significance was estimated by <italic>t</italic>-test with cut-off value of <italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05). Both proximal caspases (CASP8 and CASP9) were activated in SCC61 compared with nu61, indicating that both intrinsic and extrinsic pathways of apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">Kim 2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">Fulda and Debatin 2006</xref>) are functional in the parental SCC61 cell line, but are suppressed in nu61. Effector caspases 3/7 were also suppressed in nu61 compared to SCC61 confirming that the cell death detected in our experiments is connected with apoptosis. Similar data were detected in flow cytometry experiments (data not shown). These data show that overall cell death induced by the TNFR family ligands, IFN&#x003b3; and IR was mediated by apoptosis in both cell lines and the resistance of nu61 to IR, IFNs and the TNFR family ligands is due to the suppression of apoptotic caspases 3, 8 and 9.</p><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p>Proximal and effector caspases activation is suppressed in nu61 compared to SCC61 in response to genotoxic stress and death ligands of the TNF superfamily.

Out of 35 cytokines tested we found that, IL8 and soluble IL6 receptor (sIL6R) were differentially produced by nu61 relative to SCC61 (data not shown). To investigate the relative expression of IL6, IL8 and sIL6R in nu61 and SCC61 we used ELISA (see <italic>Methods</italic>). Since we were interested in the potential relationships between Stat1 expression and the expression of IL6, IL8 and sIL6R, we used stable Stat1 knock-downs and CV-transfected cell lines of SCC61 and nu61. We showed previously that stable Stat1 knock-down by retroviral-based shRNA led to 2.5-fold suppression of Stat1 protein in NKD relative to N1L4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">Khodarev et al. 2007</xref>). Furthermore we demonstrated that this knock-down leads to significant 1.9-fold radiosensitisation of N1L4 in vivo. These data indicated that some prosurvival/radioprotective pathways may operate down-stream from Stat1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">Khodarev et al. 2007</xref>). We therefore suggested that IL6-IL8 signalling may participate in these pathways. First we compared production of IL6, IL8 and sIL6R by N1L4 relative to S1L4 (control cell lines, see <italic>Methods</italic>). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A&#x02013;C</xref> shows that all three ligands were expressed in N1L4 at the higher levels compared to S1L4. For IL6 at the basal level the differences between S1L4 and N1L4 were highly significant (6.9-fold increase in N1L4; <italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.00001). For IL8 there was a 4.1-fold increase with significance <italic>p</italic> = 0.0007. For sIL6R N1L4 media was enriched by this ligand 2.4-fold compared to S1L4 with <italic>p</italic> = 0.00057. Taken together, these data show that the nu61 phenotype is associated with increased production of IL6, IL8 and sIL6R compared to the parental SCC61 cell line.</p><fig id="fig5" position="float"><label>Figure 5</label><caption><p>Production of IL6 (panel A), IL8 (panel B) and sIL6R (panel C) by CV-transfected nu61 and SCC61 and cells with stable Stat1 knock-down.

Each cell line was plated in three independent wells. 48 hours conditioned media was collected and used for estimation of concentrations of IIL6, IL8 and sIL6R using ELISA kits (R &#x00026; D Systems, Minneapolis, MN, USA). See text for explanations. Error bars=SE.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="trab85-421-f5"/></fig><p>Next we compared differences in the production of IL6, IL8 and sIL6R in control cell lines (S1L4 and N1L4) and the corresponding Stat1 knock-downs (SKD and NKD, see <italic>Methods</italic>). Basal IL-6 production in SKD was decreased compared to the S1L4 1.97-fold (<italic>p</italic> = 0.0004; see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). For NKD/N1L4 suppression of IL6 production was 1.3-fold with <italic>p</italic> = 0.01 (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). This suggests that IL-6 production is Stat1-dependent in both cell lines. For basal IL-8 production we did not detect any trends in SCC61, perhaps due to the low sub-threshold expression of this cytokine, but in nu61, we detected significant suppression of IL-8 production in NKD relative to N1L4 (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). NIL4 produced 8785.7 &#x000b1; 695.8 pg/ml of IL-8, while NKD produced only 6811.6 &#x000b1; 114 pg/ml. The difference was significant with <italic>p</italic> = 0.046. These data suggest that at least in N1L4 IL8 production is also associated with Stat1 expression, as is IL6 production (see above).</p><p>Finally we examined the effects of IR on the expression of IL6, IL8 and sIL6R. As is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>, IL6 demonstrates clear up-regulation post IR both in SIL4 and N1L4. For S1L4 on the basal level the concentration of IL6 was equal to 78.1 + 2.92 pg/ml. 48 hours post-IR concentration increased to 220.1 &#x000b1; 8.28 pg/ml. This indicates a 2.8-fold induction with significance <italic>p</italic> = 7.95E-05. In N1L4 the basal concentration of IL6 was equal to 488.1 &#x000b1; 20.1 pg/ml. 48 hours post IR the concentration increased to 972.1 &#x000b1; 42.3 pg/ml (1.99-fold induction; <italic>p</italic> = 0.00046). These data demonstrate that IL6 production is induced by IR in both SIL4 and N1L4 cell lines. Interestingly, together with IR-induced up-regulation of IL6 in S1L4, we also detected IR-induced up-regulation of sIL6R (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). The basal concentration of sIL6R in S1L4 was 97.5+/&#x02212;2.93 pg/ml. 48 hours post IR it increased to 126.5+/&#x02212;8.4 pg/ml. The fold-induction was relatively modest (1.3-fold) but statistically significant (<italic>p</italic> = 0.0297). Contrary to these observations, in N1L4 irradiation shows a trend towards the suppression of sIL6R production (0.82-fold), but without significance (<italic>p</italic> = 0.1932). In other words, in S1L4, IR led to the up-regulation of both IL6 and sIL6R, while in N1L4, IR significantly induced only IL6 production, but not sIL6R. These data are consistent with recent observations that shedding of IL6 receptor is connected with activation of apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">Chalaris et al. 2007</xref>). Sensitivity of SCC61 to apoptosis (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3</xref>) is also consistent with these data.</p><p>The data described in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> led to three important conclusions. First, N1L4 overexpress IL6, IL8 and sIL6R on the basal level compared to the parental cell line S1L4. Pro-survival and anti-apoptotic signalling connected with these cytokines may at least in part explain the resistance of nu61 to apoptosis compared to SCC61. Second, comparing wild type (wt) and Stat1 KD variants of both cell lines we found that both IL6 and IL8 production are dependent on Stat1. To our knowledge this is the first observation that in SCC61/nu61 cell lines Stat1 expression is associated with production of IL6 and IL8. Third, we found that IL6/sIL6R system is clearly radioinducible in SCC61 (see <italic>Discussion</italic>).</p></sec><sec><title>Inactivation of IL6 and IL8 sensitises cells to genotoxic stress and IFN&#x003b3; in nu61</title><p>To define the role of IL6 and IL8 in nu61 survival we used neutralising antibodies to IL-8 and to IL-6 alone and in combination. Cells were treated with neutralising antibodies (N-Ab) as described in the <italic>Methods</italic>. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>, neither antibody alone affected survival of nu61 after treatment with IFN&#x003b3; alone or in combination with IR (see <italic>Methods</italic>). However, the combination of both antibodies led to a 2-fold suppression of nu61 viability after treatment with IFN&#x003b3; and a 1.9-fold suppression after combined treatment with IR and IFN&#x003b3;. The significance of these observations was confirmed by t-test with <italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>).

We showed that radioresistance of nu61 is associated with the constitutive up-regulation of the Stat1 pathway and Stat1-dependent, IFN-stimulated genes (ISG) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">Khodarev et al. 2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">2007</xref>). We also showed that IR can directly activate the Stat1 pathway and that selection of parental interferon/radiosensitive tumours-SCC61 against in-terferons leads to the selection of clones that are cross-resistant to IR and IFN and over-express genes in the Stat1 pathway. At the same time Stat1 knockdown leads to radiosensitisation of nu61 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">Khodarev et al. 2007</xref>). These observations suggested that constitutive over-expression of the Stat1 pathway leads to combined resistance to IFN and IR, and is associated with Stat1-dependent pro-survival signalling. However, the mechanisms of this cross-resistance and pro-survival signalling remained elusive.</p><p>Cytotoxicity following Stat1 activation by interferon stimulation is mediated by apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">Samuel 1991</xref>). We therefore hypothesised that nu61 resistance to genotoxic stress is mediated, at least in part by resistance to apoptosis induction. Activation of the apoptosis-associated caspases is the most common hallmark of apoptotic cell death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">Eckelman et al. 2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b55">Youle and Strasser 2008</xref>). Using various approaches for the measurement of caspases 3, 7, 8 and 9 we found that they were suppressed in nu61 relative to the SCC61. These data indicate impaired apoptotic response in nu61. This indicates that nu61 resistance to genotoxic stress is located down-stream from Stat1, contrary to the few reported cases of up-stream resistance to IFN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">Kaplan et al. 1998</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">Muller et al. 2005</xref>). Interestingly, according to clonogenic assay, in the region of the initial slope (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>) the number of clonogenic cells in nu61 exceeds that in SCC61 by approximately two-fold. This is the inverse of the proportion of caspase-3 positive apoptotic cells in the short-term assay (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). This suggests that decreased apoptosis in nu61 may be connected with increased proportion of apoptosis-resistant clonogenic cells in nu61 population, which is consistent with our results about increased production of growth/proliferation-stimulating cytokines in nu61 (see below).</p><p>We further suggested that suppression of apoptotic cell death in nu61 might lead to the increased resistance of this cell line and corresponding tumours to the death ligands of the TNFR superfamily, which mostly operate through induction of apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b49">Varfolomeev et al. 2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">Dai et al. 2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">Baritaki et al. 2007</xref>). Indeed, our results show that in addition to IR and IFN resistance, nu61 relative to SCC61 is also resistant to TNF&#x003b1;, TRAIL and FAS. All of these ligands are known to be involved in the control of tumour growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b53">Weichselbaum et al. 2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">Han et al. 2008</xref>). It is possible that the selection of radioresistant tumour clones induced by fractionated irradiation is associated with suppression of apoptotic pathways activated by different pro-inflammatory cytokines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">Dunn et al. 2005</xref>).</p><p>Our previous data also indicated that in nu61 the functions of Stat1 are connected with pro-survival and radio/chemo-protective signalling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">Khodarev et al. 2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b52">Weichselbaum et al. 2008</xref>). We should note that these observations are contradictory to traditional understanding of Stat1 as tumour suppressor gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b43">Samuel 2001</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">Levy and Darnell 2002</xref>). However, currently several laboratories have confirmed the association of Stat1 with an aggressive chemo-/radio-resistant and oncogenic phenotype.</p><p>It has been shown that Stat1 can control essential pro-survival genes, such as Myeloid Cell Leukemia 1 (MCL-1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b47">Timofeeva et al. 2006</xref>), Interferon-Induci-ble Transmembrane Protein 1 (IFITM1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">Kita et al. 2003</xref>) and multi-drug resistance Major Vault Protein MVP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b44">Steiner et al. 2006</xref>). Constitutive over-expression of Stat1 and Stat1-dependent genes is associated with protection of tumour cells from genotoxic stress following treatment with fludarabine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">Friedberg et al. 2004</xref>), doxorubicin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b46">Thomas et al. 2004</xref>), cis-platinum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">Roberts et al. 2005</xref>) and the combination of ionising radiation and doxorubicin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">Rickardson et al. 2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">Fryknas et al. 2007</xref>). Most recently it was demonstrated that suppression of Stat1 leads to radiosensitisation in renal cell carcinoma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">Hui et al. 2009</xref>), which is consistent with our previous observations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">Khodarev et al. 2007</xref>). In the current report we provide a partial mechanistic explanation for such a &#x02018;reversed&#x02019; Stat1-dependent phenotype that is connected with alterations in apoptosis. Another part of an explanation may be connected with secretion of Stat1-dependent pro-survival factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">Adams and Cory 2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b45">Tan and Coussens 2007</xref>). To test this hypothesis we established co-cultures of nu61 and SCC61 (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>) and found that nu61 secretes factors which partially rescue SCC61 from cell death. We identified these factors as IL8, IL6 and the soluble receptor of IL6 (sIL6R), which were differentially secreted by nu61 compared to SCC61 (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). IL6 and IL8 signalling are recognised as important factors of tumourogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">Bachelor and Bowden 2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">Hodge et al. 2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">Nicolini et al. 2006</xref>) and may be associated with the Stat1 pathway through glycoprotein 130 (gp130), CCAAT/enhancer binding protein beta (C/EBP beta) and direct interaction of Stat1 with IL8 promoter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">Ernst and Jenkins 2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b54">Yamaoka et al. 2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">Hu and Nicholas 2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">Galdiero et al. 2006</xref>). Our experiments show that expression of IL6 and IL8 is directly suppressed by Stat1 knock-down (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). These experiments suggest that expression of these cytokines is controlled by Stat1, but additional experiments are needed to decode these relationships.</p><p>Of specific interest are our observations about sIL6R. This receptor does not individually activate down-stream signalling. Upon binding with IL6 it further binds to the ubiquitous receptor gp130, and activates Stat1/Stat3 pathways and pro-survival Ras and Akt pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">Ernst and Jenkins 2004</xref>). These processes called &#x02018;trans-signalling&#x02019; and solubilisation (shedding) of sIL6R are associated with activation of apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">Chalaris et al. 2007</xref>). These data are consistent with our observations presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> and suggest that nu61 cells may not only promote their own growth and survival but also form pro-survival paracrine loops, at least in part involving IL8/IL6/sIL6R network.</p><p>Our experiments show that this phenotype can be reversed with neutralising antibodies to IL6 and IL8 (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). These results provide compelling evidence that IL6-IL8 signalling is associated with resistant phenotype of nu61.</p><p>Based on our results we hypothesise that Stat1, IL6/sIL6R&#x003b1; and IL8 form an interdependent network associated with increased survival of nu61. The parental tumour clone (SCC61) is subjected to negative pressure from irradiation and/or the tumour microenvironment which produce multiple factors able to activate the Stat1 pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">Nishigaki et al. 2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">Buess et al. 2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">Andersen et al. 2008</xref>). Importantly, our data suggest that IR-induced up-regulation of IL6 in parental SCC61 tumour cells might be one of the initial events in the activation of the Stat1 pathway (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). This activation leads to the elimination of the majority of the tumour cells, sensitive to Stat1-delivered cytotoxicity but also induces the selection of &#x02018;nu61-like&#x02019; clones, which are resistant to irradiation and the stromal death ligands due to suppression of Stat1-dependent apoptotic pathways. The ability of these cells to secrete pro-survival ligands promotes growth and the transformation of surrounding less aggressive tumour or pre-malignant clones. This selection leads to the formation of tumour clones with aggressive properties and combined resistance to IR, chemotherapy and cytotoxic cytokines.</p><p>Our previous and current data suggest that targeting Stat1, IL6 and IL8 may enhance the therapeutic ratio for treatment of Stat1 over-expressing tumours.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>This work was supported by NIH grants PO1-CA71933 (R.R.W. and B.R), RO1-CA113662 and R01 CA111423 (R.R.W).
