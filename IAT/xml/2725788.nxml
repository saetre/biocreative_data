However, some HERVs display high transcription in physiological conditions. In particular, ERVWE1, ERVFRDE1 and ERV3, three proviruses of distinct families, are highly transcribed in placenta and produce envelope proteins associated with placenta development. As silencing of repeated elements is thought to occur mainly by DNA methylation, we compared the methylation of ERVWE1 and related HERVs to appreciate whether HERV methylation relies upon the family, the integration site, the tissue, the long terminal repeat (LTR) function or the associated gene function. CpG methylation of HERV-W LTRs in placenta-associated tissues was heterogeneous but a joint epigenetic control was found for ERVWE1 5&#x02032;LTR and its juxtaposed enhancer, a mammalian apparent LTR retrotransposon. Additionally, ERVWE1, ERVFRDE1 and ERV3 5&#x02032;LTRs were all essentially hypomethylated in cytotrophoblasts during pregnancy, but showed distinct and stage-dependent methylation profiles. In non-cytotrophoblastic cells, they also exhibited different methylation profiles, compatible with their respective transcriptional activities. Comparative analyses of transcriptional activity and LTR methylation in cell lines further sustained a role for methylation in the control of functional LTRs. These results suggest that HERV methylation might not be family related but copy-specific, and related to the LTR function and the tissue. In particular, ERVWE1 and ERV3 could be developmentally epigenetically regulated HERVs.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>HERV</kwd><kwd>LTR</kwd><kwd>methylation</kwd><kwd>syncytins</kwd><kwd>placenta</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><label>1.</label><title>Introduction</title><p>Human endogenous retroviruses (HERVs) are constitutive elements of the human genome.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DSP011C1">1</xref></sup> Now transmitted exclusively in a Mendelian way, they derived through infectious retrovirus integration in the germ-line DNA and transmission to the offspring, millions of years ago. Different waves of retroviral endogenization and expansion by retrotranspositional events (copying mechanism) led to the formation of at least 31 phylogenic multicopy families of HERVs, corresponding to over 400 000 HERV copies, dispersed throughout the genome.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DSP011C2">2</xref></sup> Because of the accumulation of mutations, the contemporary HERV families consist of collections of heterogeneous HERV elements, ranging from full-length proviruses [gag, pol and env gene sequences flanked at each extremity by a long terminal repeat (LTR)] to isolated LTRs derived from inter-LTR recombination events.</p><p>Some families or family members of HERVs are naturally expressed in particular physiological contexts and display physiological functions. This is not only the case in several LTRs active as alternative promoters of cellular genes in placenta<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DSP011C3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DSP011C4">4</xref></sup> but also in proviruses driving the expression of their own retroviral protein, e.g. ERVWE1, ERVFRDE1 and ERV3, three phylogenically unrelated proviruses highly active in the placenta. ERVWE1 belongs to the HERV-W family and contains gag and pol pseudogenes but its envelope gene ORF has been preserved (for review see Gimenez and Mallet<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DSP011C5">5</xref></sup>). This domesticated envelope, dubbed Syncytin-1, was demonstrated to be involved in trophoblast fusion occurring during placental development<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DSP011C6">6</xref></sup> and was also recently proposed to exert anti-apoptotic function<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DSP011C7">7</xref></sup> and to induce proliferation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DSP011C8">8</xref></sup> The ERVFRDE1 provirus from the HERV-FRD family<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DSP011C9">9</xref></sup> and the ERV3/envR provirus from the ERV3/HERV-R family<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DSP011C10">10</xref></sup> also code for functional envelope proteins that probably play a role in placental development, i.e. Syncytin-2 and ERV3 Env, respectively.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DSP011C9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DSP011C11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DSP011C12">12</xref></sup> Syncytin-2, which is fusogenic<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DSP011C9">9</xref></sup> and immunosuppressive,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DSP011C13">13</xref></sup> appears strictly expressed in placenta.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DSP011C11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DSP011C14">14</xref></sup> In contrast, ERV3 Env, which inhibits cell proliferation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DSP011C15">15</xref></sup> and exhibits immunosuppressive properties,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DSP011C13">13</xref></sup> is transcribed at various levels in almost all investigated tissues.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DSP011C11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DSP011C16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DSP011C17">17</xref></sup> Except for these few examples of localized physiological activities, HERV elements appear essentially silent in somatic cells.</p><p>HERV silencing is thought to be the result of the methylation of the LTRs (5&#x02032; LTR, 3&#x02032; LTR or solo LTR), which, as for infectious retroviruses, contain the regulatory elements and, in particular, the retroviral promoter in the LTR U3-subregion. This epigenetic process, which occurs in mammals on cytosines of 5&#x02032;CpG dinucleotides, has the property to block the regulatory function of the targeted sequence.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DSP011C18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DSP011C19">19</xref></sup> It is believed to have evolved primarily as a defense mechanism against the possible deleterious effects of retroelements and repeated sequences.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DSP011C20">20</xref></sup> Indeed, whole genome methylation studies showed that repeated elements, including HERVs, are globally methylated in normal somatic cells.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DSP011C21">21</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DSP011C23">23</xref></sup> Methylation-mediated repression of HERV LTRs activity was illustrated <italic>in vitro</italic> by methylation assays on functional HERV-K 5&#x02032;LTRs.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DSP011C24">24</xref></sup> Conversely, demethylation-mediated derepression of copies from the HERV-K (HML-2) and HERV-E families was illustrated in cell culture by the use of the demethylating agent 5&#x02032;-aza-deoxycytidine.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DSP011C25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DSP011C26">26</xref></sup><italic>In vivo</italic> HERV transcripts have been detected in numerous pathological situations and predominantly in autoimmune/inflammatory diseases<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DSP011C26">26</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DSP011C30">30</xref></sup> and tumoral contexts.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DSP011C31">31</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DSP011C34">34</xref></sup> Methylation deregulations are strongly associated with tumors,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DSP011C22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DSP011C23">23</xref></sup> and interestingly, tumoral transcriptional reactivations of HERVs have been associated with LTRs hypomethylation for some contexts when compared with normal tissues. This is the case of one HERV-H copy in gastrointestinal cancers,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DSP011C35">35</xref></sup> several HERV- K members in urothelial carcinomas<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DSP011C36">36</xref></sup> and human primary testicular tumors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DSP011C25">25</xref></sup> and the HERV-W family in ovarian carcinomas.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DSP011C37">37</xref></sup></p><p>Thus, the impact of DNA methylation in the control of HERV elements seems obvious. However, HERV methylation status in physiological conditions has been less considered. HERV-E LTRs acting as alternative promoters of cellular genes in placenta were shown to be unmethylated in this tissue, but hypermethylated in blood where they do not exert promoter function.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DSP011C38">38</xref></sup> Likewise, the expression of the domesticated ERVWE1 locus has been correlated with hypomethylation of its 5&#x02032;LTR in placenta in comparison with other tissues.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DSP011C39">39</xref></sup> Thus, HERV activity in physiological context seems related to a lack of methylation. The HERV-W family contains &#x0223c;80 full-length proviruses with flanking LTRs, 200 retrosequences with incomplete LTRs and 400 solitary LTRs.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DSP011C40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DSP011C41">41</xref></sup> However, in contrast to ovarian carcinoma, expression of HERV-W family in placenta mainly results from the activity of the ERVWE1 locus.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DSP011C42">42</xref></sup> The high and specific placental expression of ERVWE1 has been attributed to the co-optation of its own retroviral promoter, localized in the 5&#x02032; LTR, with an LTR retrotransposon of MaLR (mammalian apparent LTR retrotransposon) type, acting as a trophoblast-specific enhancer (TSE).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DSP011C43">43</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DSP011C46">46</xref></sup> Still neither the methylation status of this enhancer LTR nor the methylation status of family related LTRs is known. Similarly, the methylation status of other proviruses producing envelope proteins, like ERVFRDE1 and ERV3, are unknown.</p><p>Generally, the features determining HERV methylation status are unknown. In addition, it remains poorly understood whether methylation not only can repress but also regulate HERV activity. Here, we asked whether ERVWE1 5&#x02032;LTR methylation is related to the HERV family, the LTR role, the LTR-surrounding genomic context, the tissue or the implication of its envelope gene in a physiological process. For this purpose, we investigated and compared the methylation profiles of ERVWE1 5&#x02032;LTR with ERVWE1 MaLR LTR enhancer, different HERV-W LTRs and the 5&#x02032;LTRs from HERVs probably involved in placenta development and maintenance. Whether transcriptional activity and methylation were correlated was further addressed using model cell lines.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="methods"><label>2.</label><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s2a"><label>2.1.</label><title>Biological samples</title><p>Placental tissues from the first trimester legally induced abortions (8&#x02013;12 weeks of gestation) were obtained from the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology at the Broussais, Saint Vincent de Paul and Cochin Hospitals. Second trimester placental tissues were collected at the time of termination of pregnancy at 15 and 25 weeks of gestation (in weeks of amenorrhea) in trisomy 21-affected pregnancies. Fetal Down syndrome was diagnosed by karyotyping of amniotic fluid cells. The indication of amniocentesis was the maternal age. Term placentas were obtained after elective cesarean section from healthy mothers near term with uncomplicated pregnancies. With written informed consent of the pregnant woman, the following samples were collected at term: a fragment of the placenta, umbilical cord fetal blood and maternal blood. The placenta biopsy sample was collected at a depth of 1 cm and at a distance of 8 cm from the edge of the placenta, with the maternal side facing upward. The use of these biological samples was approved by local ethical committee. Villous cytotrophoblastic cells were isolated by sequential enzymatic digestion of chorionic villi from the first trimester, second trimester and term placenta and purified on a discontinuous percoll gradient, as described previously.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DSP011C47">47</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DSP011C49">49</xref></sup> These cells were positively stained for cytokeratin 7 at 95%, indicating the cytotrophoblastic origin of the cells.

First-round PCR was accomplished in a 50 &#x000b5;L mixture containing 3 &#x000b5;L of modified DNA, 0.66 &#x000b5;M of each primer, 1 mM of each dNTP, 1 U of DyNAzyme polymerase (Fynnzyme), 1&#x000d7; Mg-free DyNAzyme buffer (Fynnzyme) and 1.5 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub> (Fynnzyme).

PCR fragments were gel-extracted, cloned and sequenced using plasmid forward and reverse primers. To determine CpG methylation, and cytosine conversion rate, the sequence of each clone was aligned and compared with the in silico modified reference sequence (with all cytosines converted into thymines independently of their context). CpG positions were located and the methylation status at each CpG site observed. To prevent false-positive interpretation, only sequences with more than 95% of converted bases (all cytosines out of CpG context) were taken in analyses. Independence of the sequences was determined based either on their within-sample unique methylation pattern and/or on unique non-conversion of cytosines out of CpG context.

On the contrary, some other CpG sites were found constitutively methylated (e.g. the first CpG of HW_4[5&#x02032;LTR], the last CpG of ERVWE1[3&#x02032;LTR] and the last two CpGs of HW_12[solo LTR]).</p><p>Interestingly in this tissue, the CpG site located at the end of the ERVWE1[5&#x02032;LTR] ER binding site and conserved in ERVWE1[3&#x02032;LTR] and HW_4[5&#x02032;LTR] was not methylated in approximately the same proportion of clones in both LTRs (e.g. in 7 out of 10 clones and 9 out of 10 clones, respectively). Likewise, the CpG located before the TATA box, conserved in ERVWE1[3&#x02032;LTR] and HW_12[solo LTR], was not methylated in 4 out of 10 clones and 4 out of 12 clones. However, other conserved CpGs did not have the same pro-rata of methylation default (e.g. the CpG at the U3/R border was not methylated in 2 out of 10 clones of ERVWE1[3&#x02032;LTR] and 7 out of 10 of HW_4[5&#x02032;LTR] and none of HW_12[solo LTR]), indicating that the ER binding site and TATA-box-associated CpGs might have particular methylation-targeting features.</p><p>These results demonstrate that LTRs from the same phylogenetic lineage can be unequally methylated within the same cellular type, suggesting that methylation establishment on HERV sequences might not be family dependent.</p></sec><sec id="s3a3"><label>3.1.3.</label><title>Methylation of ERVWE1 LTRs and associated MaLR LTR suggests a regional control</title><p>By definition, ERVWE1[5&#x02032;LTR] and ERVWE1[3&#x02032;LTR] belong to the same proviral unit, but appeared differentially methylated in villous placenta.

In fetal cord blood cells on the contrary, the global methylation level of ERVFRDE1[5&#x02032;LTR] was only 25.3%. This was due to a quasi-systematic but exclusive methylation on the CpGs neighboring the TATA box. This accurate methylation pattern was conserved in maternal blood cells, although an occasional methylation of the second CpG site slightly increased the methylation level up to 30.2%.

Thus, in the first trimester placenta, the MaLR[LTR]&#x02013;ERVWE1[5&#x02032;LTR] was not methylated at all (placenta 1.1 Fig.&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="DSP011F4">4</xref>B). Among the two second trimester samples derived from T-21 placentas, placenta 2.1 also showed no methylation at all (not shown), whereas placenta 2.2 presented one fully methylated clone out of 12 (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="DSP011F4">4</xref>B). In contrast, in all the three CT samples derived from term placenta, the bimodal methylation pattern was clearly observed though with a significant sample-to-sample variation in the proportion of the two methylation patterns. More precisely, the number of methylated clones was 1 out of 12 in placenta 3.1 (not illustrated), 5 out of 12 in placenta 3.2 (not illustrated) and 6 out of 14 in placenta 3.3 (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="DSP011F4">4</xref>B), respectively. In short, the global amount of methylated CpGs in the MaLR[LTR]&#x02013;ERVWE1[5&#x02032;LTR] region varied from 0% in the first trimester placenta to 33.3% at term (as observed in the term placental villi sample). The absence of stability in the bimodal repartition of molecules methylation throughout gestation argues against the proposed imprinting hypothesis.

Hence, in the U3 region, 29.2% of the CpGs were methylated in the first trimester, 18.2% in the second trimester and 25.4% at term. Still, as in ERVWE1, ERV3[5&#x02032;LTR] methylation pattern did change. However, these changes were not progressive but more drastically linked to the gestation stage, and differences were more particularly obvious between the first and the second trimester. Indeed and interestingly, ERV3[5&#x02032;LTR] methylation profile in the first trimester was very similar to the one observed for ERVFRDE1[5&#x02032;LTR] in blood, i.e. precisely and systematically associated with the TATA box.

ERV3 expression in placenta along gestation has been described sparsely. However, under the same hypothesis as proposed above for ERVFRDE1, this methylation pattern could correlate with the faint or absent ERV3 env expression in the first trimester highly proliferative CTs.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DSP011C63">63</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DSP011C64">64</xref></sup> In the second trimester CT sample, we could observe lower methylation of these CpGs leading to an unmethylated U3 region in 5 of the 11 sequences. In contrast, a new methylation occurred on the first CpG downstream from the LTR on all clones, which was never methylated in the first trimester. Finally, three methylation patterns were observed in term CTs, which were similar to those of the term villous placenta sample. Thus, over the 15 clones analyzed, 8 were completely unmethylated in the U3 area, whereas the others were methylated along the whole U3 region or only on the first and last CpGs.

Yet, this permissive methylation is compatible with the induction of ERV3 <italic>env</italic> upon U937 stimulation with differentiating agents such as retinoic acid.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DSP011C65">65</xref></sup> In contrast, in 85HG66, BeWo and to a lesser extent in OVCAR-3, we observed a high expression level of the <italic>env</italic> region, but meanwhile a strong methylation level of ERV3[5&#x02032;LTR]. Analysis of ERV3 <italic>env</italic> containing mRNA using the USCS genome browser (<uri xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="http://genome.ucsc.edu/cgi-bin/hgTracks">http://genome.ucsc.edu/cgi-bin/hgTracks</uri>, chr7:64088622&#x02013;64104466) suggests the existence of an alternative initiation site in addition to the published initiation site in the ERV3[5&#x02032;LTR].<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DSP011C12">12</xref></sup> The mRNA AK295189, which has 99.8% identity with the genomic sequence, notably supports this. It encompasses the full-length ERV3 env region, but not the retroviral sequence ahead, and starts about 7240 bp upstream from the ERV3[5&#x02032;LTR] transcription start site. It is thus conceivable that in the cell lines 85HG66, BeWo and possibly in OVCAR-3, the observed transcription is related to such an alternate mRNA form. Alternatively although uncommon, we cannot exclude that the ERV3 promoter contains methylation-dependent transcription factor binding sites, as recently described for Epstein&#x02013;Barr virus.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DSP011C66">66</xref></sup></p><p>ERVWE1 is the only known HERV with a juxtaposed enhancer. This TSE is part of a MaLR LTR, and interestingly, all the MaLR CpG sites are located within the TSE. We were thus interested to know the extent to which methylation of the TSE could influence ERVWE1 transcriptional activity. Progressively 5&#x02032;deleted MaLR[LTR]&#x02013;ERVWE1[5&#x02032;LTR] reporter constructs (simplified &#x02018;TSE-U3&#x02019;, &#x02018;U3 full-length&#x02019; and &#x02018;U3 minimal&#x02019; promoters, see Fig.&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="DSP011F6">6</xref>A) were gradually methylated, transfected in BeWo cell and analyzed for luciferase activity (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="DSP011F6">6</xref>B). The TSE-U3 promoter activity was the maximal among the three promoter constructs in unmethylated state, but dropped dramatically when methylated. Thus, after 30 min of methylation (incomplete methylation), we observed a 5.4-fold decrease in comparison with only 3- and 1.8-fold for the U3 full-length and minimal promoters. Still, in this state, the TSE-U3 promoter activity remained the highest with 18.4% of the maximal activity, compared with only 10% for the TSE-deleted construct. Further increase in the methylation time to complete methylation reduced the activities to about the same level, i.e. 12.5% for TSE-U3 promoter, 8.5% for the full-length U3 promoter and 7.6% for the minimal U3 promoter. In line with the observed conjoint methylation status of the MaLR[LTR] and ERVWE1[5&#x02032;LTR], these results underline the importance of the total absence of methylated CpGs on both LTRs to obtain maximal transcription and, conversely the need of a concomitant methylation of both LTRs for an efficient repression.</p><fig id="DSP011F6" position="float"><label>Figure&#x000a0;6</label><caption><p>Effect of CpG methylation on MaLR[LTR]&#x02013;ERVWE1[5&#x02032;LTR] promoter strength.

On the basis of restriction profiles with BstUI enzyme -SAM controls were, as expected, not methylated, and methylation level did not evolve anymore after 60 min indicating a similar methylation at 60 and 240 min. Plasmid methylated during 30 and 240 min and -SAM controls were transfected in BeWo b30 choriocarcinoma cells, which contain all the necessary factors for MaLR[LTR]&#x02013;ERVWE1[5&#x02032;LTR] promoter activity. Firefly luciferase activities were normalized to the activity of the co-transfected pRL-TK Renilla luciferase plasmids. The mean and standard deviation from at least three independent experiments are shown and expressed as a percentage of the maximal activity. Promoter activity of the vector backbone represents &#x0003c;0.3% of the larger TSE-U3 construct and &#x0003c;1.3% of the U3 minimal promoter construct (not shown).</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="dsp01106"/></fig></sec></sec><sec id="s4"><label>4.</label><title>Conclusions</title><p>Our analyses provide evidence that methylation status of ERVWE1 and other HERV-W LTRs are not related to a family/phylogenetically related process, nor are they systematically correlated with the integration surrounding area. However, they support both tissue- and locus-specific methylation processes for functional LTRs. Still, methylation status seems to differ in relation to the promoter/enhancer role of the LTR or its use as polyadenylation signal. In addition, our results suggest that methylation of HERV LTRs could be involved in the modulation of their activity. Thus, this could be achieved in several ways, through an enhancer/promoter epigenetic co-regulation (e.g. MaLR[LTR] and ERVWE1[5&#x02032;LTR]) or through a variation in cell proportion with unmethylated LTR (e.g. ERVWE1[5&#x02032;LTR] in CTs) or else, by targeting preferential CpG sites such as CpGs closed to the TATA box (e.g. ERVFRDE1[5&#x02032;LTR] in PBL, ERV3[5&#x02032;LTR] in first trimester CTs). Thus, the selective and temporal unmethylation of ERVWE1[5&#x02032;LTR] in placenta during the first trimester may allow Syncytin-1-mediated cell differentiation/fusion.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DSP011C6">6</xref></sup> In contrast, increased methylation at term may limit Syncytin-1 production and consequent cell fusion or putative anti-apoptotic protection<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DSP011C7">7</xref></sup> in accordance with CT limited fusion and higher apoptosis rate. Syncytin-1 transcriptional alterations observed in placental pathologies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DSP011C59">59</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DSP011C60">60</xref></sup> could similarly be associated with a temporally deregulated methylation of ERVWE1. Likewise, local methylation of the ERV3 promoter during the first trimester may limit ERV3 Env production and consequent inhibition of early CT proliferation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DSP011C15">15</xref></sup> In contrast, hypomethylation of ERV3 promoter in the second trimester or term placenta and in fetal blood cells may allow ERV3 Env expression and consequently, contribute to immunosuppression.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DSP011C13">13</xref></sup> So, apparently convergent tropism and redundant functions, such as fusion for Syncytin-1 (ERVWE1) and Syncytin-2 (ERVFRDE1) or immunosuppression for Synctin-2 and ERV3-Env, do not strictly match with similar methylation regulation. Sequence determinants and mechanisms involved in LTR methylation need to be further investigated to better understand HERV regulations and deregulations associated with pathologies.</p></sec><sec id="s5"><title>Funding</title><p>JG and CM are supported by a doctoral fellowship from bioMerieux.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>JG performed most of the experimental work and wrote the manuscript; CM participated in molecular studies on LTR methylation; GO, J-PP and KR participated in the molecular studies on transcriptional activities; VT, PG and J-LF carried out placental and blood collection, and the isolation of trophoblastic and fibroblastic cells.
