A conserved stress response in eukaryotes involves endonucleolytic cleavage of transfer RNAs (tRNAs). The mechanism and significance of such tRNA cleavage is unknown. We show that in yeast, tRNAs are cleaved by the RNase T2 family member Rny1p, which is released from the vacuole into the cytosol during oxidative stress. Rny1p modulates yeast cell survival during oxidative stress independently of its catalytic ability. This suggests that upon release to the cytosol, Rny1p promotes cell death by direct interactions with downstream components. Thus, detection of Rny1p, and possibly its orthologues, in the cytosol may be a conserved mechanism for assessing cellular damage and determining cell survival, analogous to the role of cytochrome <italic>c</italic> as a marker for mitochondrial damage.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p>Stress conditions stimulate a variety of responses in eukaryotic cells, ranging from stress neutralization to cell death. Recent studies have described a novel aspect of stress responses in eukaryotic cells wherein cytosolic tRNAs are separated into half molecules by cleavage in the anticodon loop. Such tRNA cleavage has been observed during amino acid starvation in <italic>Tetrahymena thermophila</italic> and <italic>Aspergillus fumigatus</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Lee and Collins, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Jochl et al., 2008</xref>), during development in the bacterium <italic>Streptomyces coelicolor</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Haiser et al., 2008</xref>), and in human, plant, and yeast systems during oxidative stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Thompson et al., 2008</xref>; see Yamasaki et al. on p. <related-article related-article-type="article-reference" vol="185" page="35" id="d32e132" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="19332886" ext-link-type="pubmed">35</related-article> of this issue). Moreover, large-scale small RNA sequencing studies have identified cleaved tRNAs in human cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Kawaji et al., 2008</xref>). Interestingly, tRNA fragments are also observed in the urine and sera of cancer patients, with levels correlated with the tumor burden (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Waalkes et al., 1975</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Borek et al., 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Speer et al., 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Tamura et al., 1987</xref>). An unresolved issue is the mechanism and significance of stress-induced tRNA cleavage.</p><p>We demonstrate that cytosolic RNAs in yeast are cleaved during oxidative stress by release of the endonuclease RNase in Yeast 1 (Rny1p) from the vacuole into the cytosol. Rny1p also modulates cell survival during oxidative stress, but this effect is independent of its catalytic ability. These observations argue that release of Rny1p from the vacuole both promotes tRNA cleavage and separately activates a downstream pathway that promotes cell death. This is analogous to the classical example of cytochrome <italic>c</italic> release from mitochondria promoting apoptosis, and may be a general principle of how cells sense damage to membrane-bound compartments. Strikingly, the human orthologue of Rny1p, RNASET2, is a tumor suppressor that functions in a manner independent of its catalytic activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Acquati et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Smirnoff et al., 2006</xref>), which suggests that a similar control circuit occurs in mammalian cells and impacts on tumor progression.</p></sec><sec><title>Results and discussion</title><sec><title>The endonuclease Rny1p is responsible for tRNA cleavage</title><p>To identify the endonuclease responsible for tRNA cleavage, we screened several mutant yeast strains lacking predicted endonucleases for their effect on tRNA cleavage during H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> exposure or entry into stationary phase, when tRNA fragments are easily detected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Thompson et al., 2008</xref>). Only strains lacking <italic>RNY1</italic>, which is a member of the RNaseT2 family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">MacIntosh et al., 2001</xref>), failed to produce tRNA fragments during oxidative stress, entry into stationary phase, or other stress conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1, A and B</xref>; and not depicted). tRNA fragment production in the <italic>rny1&#x00394;</italic> strain can be rescued by providing <italic>RNY1</italic> on a plasmid, and is increased when <italic>RNY1</italic> is overexpressed from the <italic>GAL</italic> promoter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 C</xref>). Rny1p is likely to directly cleave tRNAs, as expression of a catalytically inactive version (<italic>rny1-ci</italic>), with two key histidine residues in the active site replaced by phenylalanines (H87F and H160F; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Deshpande and Shankar, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Acquati et al., 2005</xref>), fails to restore tRNA fragment production in an <italic>rny1&#x00394;</italic> strain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 D</xref>). These observations argue that Rny1p is the nuclease cleaving tRNAs in yeast.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p><bold>Rny1p is the endonuclease responsible for yeast tRNA cleavage.</bold> (A) 5&#x02032; tRNA-His(GTG) probe. tRNA cleavage in WT yeast during stationary phase entry.

Therefore, we asked whether loss of Rny1p also affects rRNA fragment levels during oxidative stress, using a probe against the 3&#x02032; end of the 25S rRNA that corresponds to a common rRNA cleavage product (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1, E and F</xref>, arrows; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Thompson et al., 2008</xref>). We observed that the <italic>rny1&#x00394;</italic> strain did have fewer rRNA fragments overall, but rRNA fragments were still observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1, E and F</xref>). This demonstrates that Rny1p can affect rRNA fragment production, but that there are likely to be additional nucleases that can act on rRNA during oxidative stress. That Rny1p is able to cleave other RNAs in addition to tRNAs is consistent with work showing that T2 RNases have broad specificity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Deshpande and Shankar, 2002</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Rny1p does not act in trans</title><p>Rny1p contains a putative N-terminal signal peptide for entry into the secretory pathway and is thought to be a secreted protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">MacIntosh et al., 2001</xref>), but it also accumulates in yeast vacuoles (see the following paragraph). This partitioning of Rny1p away from the cytosol raised the possibilities that tRNA cleavage was either an artifact of cell lysis, with extracellular or vacuolar Rny1p interacting with tRNAs released from the cytoplasm during lysis, or that Rny1p could be transferred between cells. To test these possibilities, we cocultured two yeast strains: an <italic>rny1&#x00394;</italic> strain expressing a <italic>Dictyostelium discoideum</italic> tRNA (referred to as tRNA-GluD; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Shaheen and Hopper, 2005</xref>), and a wild-type (WT) strain lacking tRNA-GluD. We observed that tRNA-GluD is not cleaved by Rny1p provided in trans, although when tRNA-GluD is expressed in a WT strain, tRNA-GluD fragments are clearly visible (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 G</xref>). This demonstrates that Rny1p-mediated tRNA cleavage only occurs within cells expressing Rny1p and is not an artifact of cell lysis.</p></sec><sec><title>Vacuolar release of Rny1p correlates with tRNA cleavage</title><p>An unresolved issue was how cytoplasmic tRNAs and secreted or vacuolar localized Rny1p might interact. One possibility was that tRNAs enter the vacuole during stress conditions, possibly via autophagy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Scherz-Shouval and Elazar, 2007</xref>). However, tRNA fragment production is identical in autophagy-deficient and WT yeast strains (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200811119/DC1">Fig. S1</ext-link>). A second possibility was that oxidative stress induces release of Rny1p from the vacuole into the cytoplasm. To address this issue, we localized a GFP-tagged version of Rny1p before and during oxidative stress.</p><p>In the absence of oxidative stress, Rny1p was primarily concentrated in the vacuole, as assessed by colocalization with the vacuolar luminal dye 7-amino-4-chloromethylcoumarin (CMAC; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 A</xref>). Smaller puncta of Rny1p are also observed, which may be vesicles involved in Rny1p biogenesis, as expected for a protein with a secretion peptide. After H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> exposure, the level of Rny1p in the vacuole is reduced, which suggests that Rny1p is delocalized from the vacuole during stress. Vacuolar exit does not appear to be the result of stress-induced lysis or breakdown of the vacuole, as the luminal CMAC dye is retained in vacuoles during oxidative stress (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 A</xref>). Moreover, by Western blot analysis, the amount of Rny1p does not appreciably decline after exposure to oxidative stress, which argues that loss of the vacuolar signal is not caused by degradation of Rny1 protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 B</xref>). The strongly fluorescent puncta observed after H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> treatment do not represent a novel cytosolic location for Rny1p, as they colocalize with mitochondria, and are present even in control strains without a GFP-tagged protein (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200811119/DC1">Fig. S2 A</ext-link>), which suggests mitochondrial autofluorescence, possibly from oxidized flavoproteins (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Foster et al., 2006</xref>). Therefore, after oxidative stress, our results suggest that Rny1p is distributed in the cytosol, which provides a mechanism by which Rny1p could access tRNAs and rRNAs for cleavage.</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><p><bold>Rny1p localization before and during oxidative stress.</bold> (A) Localization of Rny1p-GFP during log phase and after a 20-min exposure to 3 mM H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>.

We observed that all three of these vacuolar proteins are concentrated in vacuoles during log-phase growth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 C</xref> and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200811119/DC1">Fig. S3, A and B</ext-link>). During oxidative stress conditions, these proteins, like Rny1p, decline in concentration in the vacuole and increase in the cytosol (as assessed away from the mitochondrial background), although their overall levels do not significantly decline during oxidative stress (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 B</xref> and Fig. S3 C). These observations indicate that during oxidative stress, multiple proteins are released from the vacuole, presumably because of damage to, or increased permeability of, the vacuolar membrane. Moreover, this release of proteins from the vacuole is likely to be conserved, as previous studies have indicated that human lysosomal proteins are released during oxidative stress (for review see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Guicciardi et al., 2004</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Rny1p promotes cell death</title><p>Because oxidative stress can promote apoptosis and also resulted in high levels of tRNA cleavage, we hypothesized that Rny1p and/or tRNA cleavage might contribute to cell death.

We observed that strains overexpressing <italic>RNY1</italic> show reduced viability as cells enter stationary phase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 A</xref>). Additionally, yeast overexpressing <italic>RNY1</italic> are hypersensitive to oxidative stress from H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> exposure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 B</xref>).

However, the ability of RNASET2 to complement an <italic>rny1&#x00394;</italic> strain suggests that RNASET2 may have some role in tRNA cleavage in mammalian cells.</p></sec><sec><title>Rny1p and yeast apoptosis</title><p>WT and <italic>rny1&#x00394;</italic> cells showed similar viability during entry into stationary phase and after H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> treatment (unpublished data), which suggests that the role of Rny1p in cell death is not limiting under these conditions. However, if Rny1p plays a significant, but nonlimiting, role in promoting cell death, then the loss of Rny1p might be expected to suppress mutations that predispose yeast cells to premature apoptosis. The yeast protein Bir1 is an apoptotic inhibitor, and the <italic>bir1&#x00394;</italic> strain shows both increased cell death in response to stress and a growth defect due to premature cell death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Walter et al., 2006</xref>).

Moreover, overexpression of <italic>RNY1</italic> exacerbates the sensitivity of <italic>bir1&#x00394;</italic> yeast to oxidative stress (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 E</xref>). In similar fashion, overexpression of <italic>RNY1</italic> also increases the sensitivity of <italic>yap1&#x00394;</italic> yeast to oxidative stress (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 F</xref>), Yap1p being a key factor in the response to oxidative stress in yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Ikner and Shiozaki, 2005</xref>).

Previous work has shown that additional expression of <italic>RNASET2</italic>, or addition of recombinant RNASET2 protein, inhibits colony formation and metastasis of tumor cell lines, though in a manner independent of the catalytic activity of RNASET2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Acquati et al., 2001</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Smirnoff et al., 2006</xref>). This suggested two possible overlapping mechanisms by which Rny1p could influence cell fate. In one, release of Rny1p from the vacuole increases tRNA cleavage, resulting in an inhibition of cellular function, either by the reduction of critical RNA levels or by the tRNA fragments themselves having an inhibitory function. Alternatively, in a manner similar to release of cytochrome <italic>c</italic> from the mitochondria triggering apoptosis (for review see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Eisenberg et al., 2007</xref>), movement of Rny1p out of the vacuole could inhibit cellular function in a manner independent of its nuclease activity, possibly as part of a mechanism to sense vacuolar damage.</p><p>To distinguish between these possibilities, we generated a catalytically inactive form of Rny1p (rny1p-ci) by replacing two highly conserved residues in the catalytic core. Similar mutations in other RNase T2 family members inactivate the enzyme (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Deshpande and Shankar, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Acquati et al., 2005</xref>). Overexpression of <italic>rny1-ci</italic> does not rescue tRNA fragment production in an <italic>rny1&#x00394;</italic> mutant strain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 D</xref>), which demonstrates that these mutations inhibit the nuclease activity of Rny1p. However, rny1-ci protein is expressed at levels similar to WT Rny1p (both expressed from the <italic>GAL</italic> promoter), localizes to the vacuole during mid-log phase growth, and is released during oxidative stress (Fig. S2, B and C). Thus, rny1p-ci behaves similarly to WT Rny1p but is unable to cleave RNAs.</p><p>Examination of the phenotype of cells expressing <italic>rny1-ci</italic> led to two important observations.

This circuit has the following key features (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5</xref>). First, oxidative stress prompts relocalization of Rny1p, as well as other vacuolar proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Mason et al., 2005</xref>), from the vacuole to the cytosol (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2</xref>). Second, the presence of Rny1p in the cytosol allows tRNA cleavage, as well as cleavage of rRNA and potentially some mRNAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1</xref>). Third, Rny1p reduces cell growth independently of its nuclease activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4</xref>), presumably by affecting signaling pathways. Note that the accumulation of an organellar component in the cytosol inhibiting growth is analogous to cytochrome <italic>c</italic> release from the mitochondria promoting apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Eisenberg et al., 2007</xref>). Thus, the cellular response to stress involves parallel pathways for sensing cellular damage to membrane-bound compartments, the summation of which determines whether cells grow or commit to cell death.</p><fig id="fig5" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><p><bold>Organellar release of proteins involved in stress responses.</bold> This model compares the cytochrome <italic>c</italic>&#x02013;apoptosis pathway to how release of Rny1p from the vacuole might affect cell death after stress or damage.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="JCB_200811119_GS_Fig5"/></fig><p>Evidence suggests that a related pathway is conserved in mammalian cells. First, endonucleolytic cleavage of tRNAs in response to oxidative stress is observed in mammalian cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Thompson et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Yamasaki et al., 2009</xref>). Second, overexpression of the human <italic>RNY1</italic> orthologue <italic>RNASET2</italic> both complements an <italic>rny1&#x00394;</italic> strain with regard to tRNA cleavage and also reduces yeast viability after stress (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figs. 1 H</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3 C</xref>). Third, expression of <italic>RNASET2</italic> has been shown to affect cell growth in mammalian cells and to reduce the metastatic potential of tumor cell lines both in vivo and in vitro, independent of its nuclease activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Acquati et al., 2001</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Smirnoff et al., 2006</xref>). Finally, release of lysosomal proteins into the cytosol during oxidative stress has been observed in mammalian cells and is thought to promote entry of cells into apoptosis (for review see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Guicciardi et al., 2004</xref>). However, the observations that angiogenin cleaves tRNAs during oxidative stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Fu et al., 2009</xref>) and that tRNA fragments may have an additional role in inhibiting translation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Yamasaki et al., 2009</xref>) suggest that the mammalian process may be more complex. One possibility is that mammalian cells have evolved separate mechanisms to inhibit cell growth, using RNASET2, and to cleave tRNAs and alter translation, performed by angiogenin.</p><p>Vacuole/lysosome homeostasis appears to affect cells and tumor progression in a manner consistent with our observations. For example, we have observed that in a yeast strain defective in vacuolar pH maintenance, Rny1p-GFP is not concentrated in vacuoles, and tRNA cleavage is increased (unpublished data). Moreover, lysosomal proton pumps are up-regulated in several human cancers, which contributes to the tendency of tumor microenvironments to acidity (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Fais et al., 2007</xref>). Finally, proton pump inhibitors have proven effective in inducing apoptosis in human tumor cells both in vitro and ex vivo by a mechanism involving increased permeability of the lysosomal membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">De Milito et al., 2007</xref>). These observations, and the effect of RNASET2 on tumor progression, suggest that release of Rny1p or its orthologues in response to oxidative stress is not only a conserved process, but one that may modulate tumor progression in humans.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="Materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Yeast strains and growth conditions</title><p>Strains used in this study are listed in <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200811119/DC1">Table S1</ext-link>.
