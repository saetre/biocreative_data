To isolate factors binding to U5RE, we screened a cDNA expression library by south-western blotting with a U5RE probe. Screening 2 x10(6) clones gave a positive clone with a 3.8 kb insert encoding a novel 671 residue polypeptide, named HTLV-I U5RE binding protein 1 (HUB1), with five zinc finger domains and a Kr&#x000fc;ppel-associated box like domain; HUB1 may be related to a repressor belonging to the Kr&#x000fc;ppel type zinc finger protein. A 4.0 kb mRNA for HUB1 is ubiquitously expressed among all human tissues tested. HUB1 recognizes the TCCACCCC sequence as a core motif and exerts a strong repressive effect on HTLV-I LTR-mediated expression. A new repressive domain, named HUB1 repressive (HUR) domain, was identified, rather than the Kr&#x000fc;ppel-associated box like domain. The N-terminal region upstream of HUR domain seemed to be also indispensable to the repression. Thus, we propose that HUB1 is a new type repressor and plays an important role in the HTLV-I U5-mediated repression.</p></abstract></article-meta></front></article>
