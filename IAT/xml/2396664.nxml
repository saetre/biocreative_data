Due to the specialized sinusoids, inflammatory processes in the liver are thought to differ from those in other organs. It has been suggested that SECs of the normal liver &#x02013; in contrast to capillary endothelial cells &#x02013; only express a restricted set of adhesion molecules [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>].</p><p>PECAM-1 is known to be expressed on the surface of endothelial cells, circulating platelets, monocytes, granulocytes and some subsets of T-lymphocytes. PECAM-1 has been proposed as one of the main players in transendothelial migration of neutrophils, monocytes, and natural killer cells in both in vivo and in vitro models, since by the use of antibodies directed against PECAM-1, transmigration and inflammation could be significantly reduced [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. However, the pathomechanisms involving PECAM-1 are still a matter of debate, since in a PECAM-1-knock-out-mouse model, transmigration of inflammatory cells and inflammatory damage were almost unchanged [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>].</p><p>In our previous studies, we have demonstrated that PECAM-1 is expressed in SECs and MNPs of the rat liver. Furthermore, we have shown that the PECAM-1 expression in SECs and MNPs is decreased after CCl<sub>4</sub>-treatment in vivo before inflammatory phagocytes accumulate in the pericentral area of rat livers and following IFN-&#x003b1;-treatment of cultured SECs and MNPs in vitro. In contrast, ICAM-1-gene expression is upregulated early after CCl<sub>4 </sub>administration, reaching a maximum after 24 h. Thereafter, ICAM-1 is decreasingly expressed in SECs, reaching the control level of the value at 0 h after 48&#x02013;72 h. In MNPs ICAM-1 is maximally expressed 6 h after CCl<sub>4 </sub>administration and thereafter expression declines to control levels 72 h after CCl<sub>4 </sub>administration. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>].</p><p>Since we have seen that there is a down-regulation of PECAM-1 in the rat liver after the administration of CCl<sub>4</sub>, in this study we aimed to identify further cytokines that are responsible for the down-regulation of PECAM-1 on SECs and on transmigrating mononuclear phagocytes (MNPs), but also to identify cytokines that allow the reversal of this effect on both cell types.</p><p>A pivotal role in pathomechanisms of liver injury has been assigned to IFN-&#x003b3; next to IFN-&#x003b1; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>] and it has been demonstrated that IFN-&#x003b3; can induce IFN-&#x003b1; expression in MNPs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. TGF-&#x003b2; is a known pleiotropic cytokine with profibrogenic and anti-inflammatory capacities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. In this study we measured the concentration of IFN-&#x003b3; and TGF-&#x003b2; in the rat liver at different time points after CCl<sub>4</sub>-administration paying particular attention to the early time points. Furthermore we tested the modulation of PECAM-1 and ICAM-1-expression in SECs and MNPs following IFN-&#x003b3;-treatment in vitro and in vivo. We also studied the effect of TGF-&#x003b2; on PECAM-1 expression in isolated SECs and MNPs. Whereas IFN-&#x003b3; reduces PECAM-1 expression in parallel with the increase of ICAM-1 expression, TGF-&#x003b2; up-regulates both molecules and is also able to counteract the down-regulating effect of IFN-&#x003b3; on PECAM-1 expression in vitro.</p><p>These data strongly suggest an early down-regulation of PECAM-1 in parallel to an ICAM-1 up-regulation as a possible important mechanism for the adhesion and transmigration of inflammatory cells. However, further in vitro and in vivo studies are required to confirm this hypothesis. The TGF-&#x003b2; induced PECAM-1 up-regulation may be of importance during the recovery phase.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>PECAM-1-immunoreactivity in livers from normal rats and from rats treated with CCl<sub>4</sub>: Comparison to ED1-, and ICAM-1-immunoreactivity</title><p>Immunostaining of sections from a normal rat liver using a monoclonal antibody against rat PECAM-1 revealed positivity along the sinusoids in a similar pattern to ICAM-1 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>), suggesting PECAM-1 positivity of SECs. Staining of sequential sections by antibodies against PECAM-1 and against markers of MNPs (ED1) suggests that the positivity along the sinusoids of the normal rat liver is also partly due to MNPs (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Indirect immunodetection of PECAM-1, ICAM-1, and ED1 in sections of normal rat or acutely damaged livers (48 h after a single CCl<sub>4</sub>-administration).</bold> Sections of normal rat liver tissue (a, c, e) or acutely damaged rat liver tissue (b, d, f) were stained with a monoclonal antibody directed against rat PECAM-1 (a, b), ICAM-1 (c, d), ED1 (e, f), followed by the APAAP immunodetection (Original magnification &#x000d7; 250).

The possibility that some PECAM-1 positive cells are myofibroblasts (MFB), activated HSCs (hepatic stellate cells), or liver myofibroblasts deriving from cells different from quiescent HSCs can be excluded since isolation of these cell types at different time points after CCl<sub>4 </sub>administration and primary cultures of HSC or liver myofibroblasts from normal rat livers never showed any PECAM-1-gene expression (data not shown).</p><p>At 48 h after a single dose of CCl<sub>4 </sub>there were significant numbers of ICAM-1 and ED1 positive cells within the necrotic pericentral areas (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>).

Since we aimed to identify cytokines responsible for the modulation of PECAM-1 and ICAM-1 in vivo, we measured the concentrations of IFN-&#x003b3; and TGF-&#x003b2; protein in liver homogenates after a single CCl<sub>4</sub>-administration using EIA or Elisa. Compared to the livers of untreated controls (time point 0 h), there was an early steep increment in IFN-&#x003b3; expression with a maximum 9 h after CCl<sub>4 </sub>administration, reaching a level of 46 pg per mg of liver wet weight. At 24 h after CCl<sub>4 </sub>administration the IFN-&#x003b3; concentration peaked at the level of the control livers. At 96 h after CCl<sub>4 </sub>administration the IFN-&#x003b3; expression returned to the level seen in the livers of untreated rats. (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). TGF-&#x003b2; expression only slightly increased during the first 12 h after CCl<sub>4</sub>-administration. However it increased significantly thereafter with a maximum after 72 h, reaching a level of 67 pg per mg of liver wet weight and returned to the level seen in the livers of untreated rats after 96 h (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="F2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p><bold>(A) Expression of TNF-&#x003b1;, IFN-&#x003b3;, and TNF-&#x003b2; during acute liver damage (CCl<sub>4</sub>-model). </bold>Livers taken at different time points after a single administration of CCl<sub>4 </sub>were homogenized and used with a human-TNF-&#x003b1; and human-TNF-&#x003b2; EIA-kit or rat-IFN-&#x003b3; ELISA-kit.

In order to investigate at which time points after CCl<sub>4</sub>-administration TGF-&#x003b2; induces intracellular signaling in SECs we performed Western Blot analysis of p-SMAD2/3. Whereas TGF-&#x003b2; expression is increased between 24 h and 72 h after CCl<sub>4</sub>-administration, p-SMAD2/3 is decreased in SECs isolated 24 h&#x02013;48 h after CCl<sub>4</sub>-administration.

In this study, we show that in CCl<sub>4</sub>-treated rat livers there is an early rise of levels of IFN-&#x003b3; and &#x02013; during the recovery phase &#x02013; an increase of TGF-&#x003b2;-protein level. Similar observations for TGF-&#x003b2; levels after induced liver damage have also been reported by others [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. However especially measurements of the early time points are missing in the literature. This might be the reason for reports of a decrease of IFN-&#x003b3; after inducing liver damage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. In vitro studies indicated that IFN-&#x003b3;-treatment induced a decrease of PECAM-1-gene-expression in parallel with an increase in ICAM-1-gene-expression. Furthermore, TGF-&#x003b2;-treatment resulted in an increase of PECAM-1-expression in SECs and MNPs. TGF-&#x003b2; &#x02013; also inhibited the effect of IFN-&#x003b3; treatment. However, the temporal course of the cytokine expression in vivo after administration of the damaging noxae does not perfectly match the temporal course of changes in the expression of PECAM-1 or ICAM-1. This has two major causes. Firstly, in vivo, many intercellular contacts and additional cytokines have an impact on PECAM-1 and ICAM-1 expression on SECs and MNPs e.g. IFN-&#x003b1; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>] which shows a similar expression profile compared to IFN-&#x003b3;. Secondly, local differences in the concentration of the cytokines can lead to increased levels of the cytokines around SECs or MNPs when levels in the total liver are already decreased. The observation that IFN-&#x003b3; or TGF-&#x003b2; signalling as measured by p-STAT1 or p-SMAD2/3 is delayed and can be observed when the levels of IFN-&#x003b3; or TGF-&#x003b2; are already decreasing supports this thesis.</p><p>The in vitro effect of IFN-&#x003b3; could be confirmed in vivo, since the administration of IFN-&#x003b3; (0,4 &#x003bc;g per mg liver wet weight, which is comparable to the concentration used for the in vitro treatment (0.01 to 0.1 &#x003bc;g/ml of IFN-&#x003b3;)), together with CCl<sub>4 </sub>further decreased the PECAM-1 transcript level and also further increased the number of ED1-positive cells in the liver at 12 h after the administration of CCl<sub>4 </sub>compared to the single CCl<sub>4 </sub>administration to the animals. In contrast, in IFN-&#x003b3;<sup>-/- </sup>mice the lack of IFN-&#x003b3; may be responsible for the missing early decrease of PECAM-1 and the reduced increase of ICAM-1.</p><p>To study the involvement of cell adhesion molecules during inflammation and tissue damage in vivo several approaches have been used. It has been difficult to block inflammation using reagents directed against single molecules. Several studies, however, revealed that the transmigration of monocytes and of neutrophils could be inhibited using antibodies against PECAM-1 in vitro [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>], and in vivo, as the administration of antibodies against PECAM-1 or the administration of the soluble domain 1 of PECAM-1 blocked the accumulation of leukocytes in different models of inflammation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. In PECAM-1-knock-out-mice, however, only a slowing of inflammatory cells transmigrating through the basement membrane was observed. This slowing had no effect on the total number of transmigrated cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>].</p><p>In vivo data showing a reduced PECAM-1 expression in inflammatory cells have been interpreted as if PECAM-1 down-regulation were a consequence of the transmigration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. Our results demonstrate that in vitro and in vivo treatment with IFN-&#x003b3; down-regulates the expression of PECAM-1 in liver cells at an early time point. The in vitro studies reveal a decreased PECAM-1-expression on SECs and on MNPs. These data support the hypothesis that PECAM-1 has to be down-regulated to facilitate transmigration. A confirmation of this hypothesis could be seen in a model of abdominal aortic transplantation. The transmigration of MNPs was unexpectedly enhanced when aortic allografts from PECAM-1 knock-out-mice were transplanted compared to transplanted allografts from wild type mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. The authors suggested that this phenomenon might be due to the fact that PECAM-1 is concentrated at interendothelial junctions and is thereby important for the structural stability of the endothelial barrier. In PECAM-1 deficient grafts this endothelial stability could be reduced during the inflammatory episode after transplantation making it easier for macrophages to transmigrate through the endothelium.</p><p>Another relevant finding of the in vivo experiments is the increase of TGF-&#x003b2; concentration in the liver during the recovery phase after CCl<sub>4</sub>-administration, when IFN-&#x003b3; &#x02013; and IFN-&#x003b1; concentration have already been decreased. TGF-&#x003b2; is a pleiotropic cytokine with profibrogenic and anti-inflammatory capacities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. The data presented in this study show that in cultured SECs and MNPs, TGF-&#x003b2; increases PECAM-1-expression. Furthermore, TGF-&#x003b2; inhibited the effect of IFN-&#x003b3; on the PECAM-1 transcript level. Although an up-regulation of PECAM-1-gene-expression by TGF-&#x003b2;-treatment has been observed using a human macrophage cell line (U937 cells) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>], this is the first report showing similar effects on endothelial cells and on tissue macrophages. These data indicate a different modulation of PECAM-1 by IFN-&#x003b3; and TGF-&#x003b2; in SECs and MNPs. Under normal conditions SECs are an efficient barrier against corpusculate matter. Early production of IFN-&#x003b3; after administration of toxic agents could not only induce an increase of ICAM-1 expression, but also a decreased PECAM-1 expression, which is essential for the tight adhesion and for the transmigration of inflammatory cells into the parenchyma. During liver repair cytokines such as TGF-&#x003b2; may be effective in reestablishing the endothelial barrier.</p><p>Whereas IFN-&#x003b3; has previously been shown to exert antifibrotic effects in man and mice by abrogating TGF-&#x003b2; signalling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>], inducing an acute liver damage in IFN-&#x003b3; knockout mice revealed that the degree of damage was reduced and delayed when compared to control mice. This suggests that, least in the early time points after administration of a damaging noxae, IFN-&#x003b3; is involved in an increase of liver damage without antagonizing TGF-&#x003b2;. From these data, blockage of IFN-&#x003b3; signalling in the early time points after liver damage, thereby inhibiting downregulation of PECAM, could be a valuable tool in the treatment of patients during the early phases of liver damage.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Animals</title><p>Male Wistar rats (8 weeks old) (Charles River, Sulzberg, Germany), female C57BL/6 mice and B6.129S7-Ifngtm1Ts (IFN-&#x003b3;-deficient) mice (The Jackson Laboratory, Bar Harbor, ME) received humane care and were kept according to the institution's and the National Institutes' of Health guidelines.</p></sec><sec><title>Reagents</title><p>Human recombinant IFN-&#x003b3; was purchased from R&#x00026;D systems (Wiesbaden, FRG).
