The choice of the integration site is a crucial intermediate of the virus life cycle. The chromatin context determines the efficiency of viral transcription and is involved in the establishment of post-integrative latency that is the major obstacle to HIV-1 eradication with current antiviral therapies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. In addition, insertion of a provirus in the human genome can cause several adverse effects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. For example, insertion of the retrovirus close to a proto-oncogene may induce transformation of the cell. Gene therapy approaches suffer most from these effects and recently it has been demonstrated that the activation of an oncogene caused transformation in several children treated with a therapeutic retroviral vector [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. In principle, insertion of an ectopic transcription unit within a gene may also result either in disruption of exonic sequences, introduction of alternative splicing or transcriptional interference. Clearly, these negative effects would increase in importance relative to the increasing unbalance of the endogenous gene expression between alleles.</p><p>Integration site selection by retroviruses is not sequence-specific but also not random. HIV-1 favors integration within active transcription units [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. Additional features are the requirement of host factors such as the lens epithelium-derived growth factor LEDGF/p75 for efficient targeting of active transcription units [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>] and a DNA substrate wrapped around nucleosomes. Indeed, integration of HIV-1 is linked to nucleosomal markers of active transcription (H3/H4 acetylation, H3K4 methylation) and negatively correlated with inhibitory modifications (H3K27 trimethylation and DNA CpG methylation) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Subtle differences in the integration site choice exist among retroviruses. Murine leukemia virus (MLV) integrates within highly active promoters at &#x000b1; 5 kb from the transcription start sites [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. HIV-1 instead, although also favoring active genes, does not show a preference for promoter-proximal integration. Rather, the virus inserts throughout the transcriptional unit with a bias towards intronic sequences: this is the likely result of the greater size of introns compared to exons within a gene [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>].</p><p>A crucial aspect of HIV-1 pathogenesis is the control of provirus transcription. In particular the ability of the virus to maintain a reservoir of transcriptionally silent proviruses in resting memory T cells for long periods of time. Multiple mechanisms have been postulated to concur in these processes. Host factors, for example, may be limiting the activity of the Tat transactivator. Tat interacts with a <italic>cis</italic>-acting RNA element (trans-activation-responsive region; TAR) present at the 5' end of each viral transcript [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. Through this interaction, the protein activates HIV-1 transcription by promoting the assembly of transcriptionally active complexes at the LTR through multiple protein-RNA and protein-protein interactions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Tat interacts with the core RNA polymerase II [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>], the TATA-binding protein associated factor (TAFII) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>], TFIIH [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>], cyclin-dependent protein kinase 7 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>], SP1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>], nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>], several histone acetyltransferases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>] and cyclin T1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. On the other hand, the chromatin context at the site of integration should determine whether the provirus is transcriptionally active, poised for activation or inactive [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. Early studies showed that latency involved integration into regions of heterochromatin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. More recent systematic genome-wide analysis of the chromosomal features negatively associated to HIV-1 transcription revealed that low levels of LTR-driven expression correlated with integration in gene deserts and in centromeric heterochromatin, but also in highly expressed cellular genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. Furthermore, HIV-1 has been found in intronic regions of actively transcribed genes in resting memory CD4+ cells derived from patient on highly active antiretroviral treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. The paradox of HIV-1 integration in active genes while being transcriptionally silent requires molecular investigation of the phenomenon. Unfortunately most cellular models of HIV-1 post-integrative latency harbor the provirus outside of transcribed genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. In this work a cell-line that carries a single repressed provirus integrated within the active transcription unit of the <italic>HMBOX1 </italic>gene has been generated. Tat-mediated induction of provirus transcription resulted in the inhibition of <italic>HMBOX1 </italic>expression. However, this effect could be ascribed to Tat expression and not to activation of the viral LTR. Indeed, a subset of activated cells showed bi-allelic expression of <italic>HMBOX1 </italic>together with expression of the provirus within one of the alleles. These results are discussed in light both of HIV-1 pathogenesis and of the potential use of lentiviral vectors for gene therapy applications.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Generation and characterization of a cell line carrying a stably integrated lentiviral vector</title><p>The HIV-Intro-MS2 &#x000d7; 24-ECFPskl-IRES-TK lentiviral vector (for simplicity: HIV-Intro) has been engineered to contain the elements required for RNA production: the 5' LTR, the major splice donor (SD1), the packaging signal &#x003a8;, the RRE, the splice acceptor A7 and the 3' LTR that drives 3'-end formation (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). The construct carries also an array of 24 repeats of the MS2 phage coat protein within the intron, to increase specific detection of nascent mRNA, a reporter of gene expression (ECFP) fused to the peroxisome localization signal Ser-Lys-Leu (skl) and the selectable marker thymidine kinase (TK) of herpes simplex type 1.</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Genomic organization of the HMBOX1 gene and of the HIV-intro construct in HOS_A4 cells</bold>.

As expected from previous studies showing transcribed nascent RNA by MS2-tagging [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>], bright yellow spots appeared within the nucleus. Each spot corresponds to several plasmids clustered together that express viral RNA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. As expected, Tat was found at transcription sites because it binds the 5'-end of each transcript. The reporter of gene expression ECFPskl was found in the cytoplasm. When a plasmid expressing a DsRed-tagged Rev was co-transfected together with Tat (without tag), the unspliced RNA was found in the cytoplasm, consistent with its Rev-mediated export (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>, bottom panels). These results are mirrored by the behavior in RT-PCR using a set of primers that distinguish pre-mRNA from spliced RNA. As shown in figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>, basal transcription is up-regulated by Tat with a higher proportion of spliced over unspliced RNA. Co-transfection of a plasmid encoding pEYFP-MS2nls does not affect the splicing reaction, ruling out perturbation of the system by such a strong RNA binding protein. Expression of Rev instead increased the proportion of unspliced RNA, consistent with its role in RRE-containing RNA stabilization and export.</p><fig position="float" id="F2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p><bold>A) HeLa cells were cotransfected with pHIV-Intro, pEYFP-MS2nls and either mDsRed tagged Tat (top) or Tat and mDsRed tagged Rev (bottom). </bold>Yellow spots in the nucleus correspond to nascent RNA from transfected plasmids.

To confirm that these where sites of HIV-Intro transcription we incubated the cells with inhibitors such as Actinomicin D, &#x003b1;-Amanitin or Flavopiridol. As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2C</xref>, a rapid decrease of the number of transcription spots was observed with all three inhibitors. Hence, RNA-dependent accumulation of RNA at these sites was dependent on RNAPII activity.</p><p>Next a strategy was designed to express the HIV-Intro construct from a single chromatinized location in a Tat-inducible way. Osteosarcoma HOS_143b cells, that are negative for thymidine kinase activity (TK-), were transduced with the HIV-Intro vector pseudotyped with the VSV-G envelope. To select for clones that carry an inducible integrated provirus, cells that constitutively expressed high levels of HSV-TK were selected against by treatment with 50 &#x003bc;g/ml ganciclovir. Surviving cells, that were either non-transduced, or transduced but with a low level of TK expression, were treated with GST-Tat and briefly selected for inducible HSV-TK expression in hypoxanthine, aminopterin and thymidine (HAT) medium. Clonal populations were obtained by limiting dilutions and colonies were visually scored for low basal level of ECFP expression in the cytoplasm and to be highly inducible by GST-Tat by fluorescence microscopy. The HOS_A4 cell clone showed a robust and homogenous induction of ECFPskl in the cytoplasm upon treatment with GST-Tat (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>). These cells were transfected with plasmids encoding EYFP-MS2nls and Tat-mDsRed. As shown in figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3C</xref>, HOS_A4 showed ECFPskl in the cytoplasm and presented one single bright yellow spot in the nucleus compatible with a single site of HIV-Intro transcription that co-localized with Tat-mDsRed. Immuonfluorescence with antisera against Cyclin T1, the P-TEFb component recruited directly by Tat on the viral RNA, or RNAPII demonstrated enrichment of such factors at these sites (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3D</xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="F3"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p><bold>A) Generation of HOS_A4 cells by transduction with HIV-Intro and selection as described in the text.</bold> Tat induction induced the expression of ECFPskl in the cytoplasm.

Indeed, analysis by southern blotting (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref>) and cloning of the integration sites by inverse PCR revealed that the provirus lay within the <italic>HMBOX1 </italic>(homeobox containing 1) cellular gene.</p></sec><sec><title>Allele-specific expression of <italic>HMBOX1 </italic>following HIV-Intro-MS2 &#x000d7; 24-ECFPskl-IRES-TK transactivation</title><p>Human <italic>HMBOX1 </italic>is composed of 11 exons, spanning about 160 kb within chromosome 8 p21.1 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). <italic>HMBOX1 </italic>is believed to encode for a transcription factor involved in the transcriptional regulation of key eukaryotic developmental processes. <italic>HMBOX1 </italic>is widely expressed in pancreas and the expression of this gene can also be detected in pallium, hippocampus and hypothalamus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. In HOS_A4 cells the HIV-Intro lentiviral vector integrated within the second giant intron of <italic>HMBOX1 </italic>(Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). In order to assess expression of <italic>HMBOX1 </italic>in HOS cells RT-PCR was performed with primers specific for Exon3 or encompassing Exon2/Exon3 junction (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A</xref>). Both parental HOS 143b and HOS_A4 expressed <italic>HMBOX1 </italic>at similar levels. However, this assay was neither quantitative nor specific for the <italic>HMBOX1 </italic>allele carrying the integrated vector. A similar approach was also employed for the HIV-Intro transcript.

As shown in the diagram of Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>, RT-PCR primers were designed to detect also <italic>HMBOX1 </italic>transcripts containing HIV sequences upstream of the viral transcription start site. RNA from HOS_A4 cells was reverse-transcribed and the resulting cDNA was amplified with two primers that share the HIV_RT primer. HIV_UP5 amplifies only HIV-Intro sequences produced as a result of transcription of <italic>HMBOX1 </italic>reading through the HIV-Intro genome that is inserted into the gene. Because the forward primer is located upstream of the transcription start site and the reverse primer is located downstream of the LTR, only RNA species initiating upstream of the HIV-1 transcription start site could be amplified. HIV_START instead is able to amplify any HIV-Intro transcript that has initiated at the viral start site. To prevent amplification from HIV-1 DNA, isolated RNA was treated with DNase before RT-PCR. In addition, control reactions from which RT was omitted were included in each experiment and were invariably negative. A positive control of HIV transactivation involved a set of primers for the HIV-1 spliced RNA product (primers HIV_nuc and HIV_spliced). PCR amplification was conducted in the presence of the dye CyberGreen for relative quantification of PCR products. Transfection of Tat induced HIV-1 transcripts several folds with both primer sets detecting HIV-1 transcripts (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4C</xref> and Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4D</xref>). This result is perfectly in line with the well-known Tat-transactivation of the viral LTR and with RT PCR data shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B</xref>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. Allele-specific detection of <italic>HMBOX1 </italic>RNA instead showed a marked decrease in response to Tat (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4E</xref>). This result would be explained by negative interference with the expression of <italic>HMBOX1 </italic>due to activation of a strong promoter embedded within the gene. However, when the analysis was conducted on two primer sets specific for the <italic>HMBOX1 </italic>gene both in HOS_A4 and the parental HOS_143b we realized that expression of <italic>HMBOX1 </italic>was affected by the presence of Tat <italic>per se </italic>and not by the activation of the viral LTR (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4F</xref> and Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4G</xref>). This effect was not a general effect on transcription since the <italic>GAPDH </italic>gene was not affected (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4H</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Single-cell analysis of <italic>HMBOX1 </italic>and HIV-1 expression</title><p>Ensemble-averaged analysis such as RT-PCR that relies on the evaluation of a number of cells does not allow distinction between expression of each <italic>HMBOX1 </italic>allele. In fact, although we analyzed allele-specific expression of the allele carrying the provirus, still we don't know whether <italic>HMBOX1 </italic>expression was balanced between alleles or not.</p><p>In order to evaluate the simultaneous expression of both <italic>HMBOX1 </italic>alleles and of the integrated provirus, transcripts were detected by quantitative fluorescent <italic>in situ </italic>RNA hybridization (FISH). The amount of RNA on the transcription spot is determined by the rate of transcription and the rate of RNA processing. At steady state it could be derived from the intensity of the fluorescence signal compared with the intensity of the signal from a known reference as described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. For this purpose for each probe and each acquisition we prepared a calibration curve spotting different amounts of probe on a coverslip in a constant volume. The probes were acquired and deconvoluted using the same conditions used for the samples (see Methods). The z-projection sum of all planes was averaged and this value represent the signal emitted by each amount of probe. Therefore, the number of probes for each voxel (a volume pixel in a three-dimensional image) could be calculated for each point of the calibration curve. In the case of HIV-Intro transcripts, the number of RNAs on the transcription spot in the presence of Tat was calculated to be 17 &#x000b1; 4.</p><p><italic>HMBOX1 </italic>expression was low and could not be detected by a single probe. Therefore a mixture of eight oligonucleotides, distributed in the first and fourth exon and in the second intron before and after the integration (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>), were designed to detect the nascent unprocessed RNA transcripts of <italic>HMBOX1 </italic>(Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>). As shown in figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5A</xref>, in parental HOS-143b two spots of equal intensity were clearly visible in 37.2% of nuclei indicating that the <italic>HMBOX1 </italic>gene is expressed from both alleles, but only in a fraction of the asynchronous population of cells. This is not surprising since there is ample variation of the number of alleles/nucleus detected by this method, depending on how robust is gene expression and how efficient is the processing of the RNA; both contribute to the level of RNA at the site of transcription at steady state [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. It is however unlikely that detection was lowered by scarce accessibility of the probe to the RNA since positive cells showed invariably two alleles of equal intensity, where in the case of technical problems there would be a higher proportion of single-allele expressing cells.

Consistently with what has been observed with RT PCR analysis, the number of Tat-transfected nuclei showing expression of the two <italic>HMBOX1 </italic>loci decreased (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6A</xref>). This difference was significant in both cell lines (p value = 1.34 &#x000d7; 10<sup>-23 </sup>for HOS_143b and p value = 2.63 &#x000d7; 10<sup>-4 </sup>for HOS_A4). Interestingly, in those cells where both spots were detected, the number of RNAs and the ratio of the <italic>HMBOX1 </italic>alleles were not affected (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6B</xref> and Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6C</xref>). HIV transcripts instead were present in most (93%) of Tat-EGFP transfected cells, consistent with transactivation of the viral LTR in the clonal population (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>). Interestingly, most cells that express the vector do not show expression of <italic>HMBOX1 </italic>in both alleles, indicating that the effect on the expression of <italic>HMBOX1 </italic>was dependent on the expression of Tat and not on the transactivation of the provirus. Even more strikingly, in 11% of Tat-EGFP transfected nuclei both <italic>HMBOX1 </italic>alleles and the proviral transcript were active (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>). In this subset of cells the ratio between <italic>HMBOX1 </italic>alleles was also close to 1 and the intensity of the proviral signal comparable to that of cells where there was no <italic>HMBOX1 </italic>expression. In fact, as shown in figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6D</xref>, transcription of HIV-1 was not significantly affected by allele-specific <italic>HMBOX1 </italic>transcription (p value = 0.91). Hence, there are conditions where intragenic transcription of HIV-1 can occur in the presence of transcription of the host gene.</p><fig position="float" id="F7"><label>Figure 7</label><caption><p><bold>FISH for <italic>HMBOX1 </italic>and HIV-Intro RNA on HOS_A4 cells after transfection of Tat-EGFP</bold>.

Chromatin control of provirus gene expression has been postulated to be a major determinant of post-integration latency that is the cause of failure to eradicate HIV-1 infection by current antiretroviral regimens [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. In addition, development of lentiviral vectors for gene therapy requires that endogenous genes shouldn't be affected by the integration event. However, recent evidence suggests that down-modulation of HIV-1 expression occurs also within active genes, in the absence of a repressive chromatin context. A cell line harboring a Tat-inducible HIV-1 vector integrated within the <italic>HMBOX1 </italic>endogenous gene has been engineered in this work. This allowed the detailed investigation of the reciprocal influence of HIV-1 and <italic>HMBOX1 </italic>expression both with or without Tat induction.</p><p>As a result of the double selection procedure, HOS_A4 showed a basal level of HIV-1 RNA by RT PCR that could be assigned to <italic>HMBOX1 </italic>read-through transcription across the silent HIV-1 provirus since neither RNA was evident in FISH (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5C</xref>) nor ECFPskl could be detected in the cytoplasm (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>). Tat overexpression, while increasing HIV-1 expression as expected, also reduced the level of expression of <italic>HMBOX1 </italic>in both alleles. Besides its essential role in <italic>trans-</italic>activating HIV-1 transcription, Tat is known to regulate key host cell functions, primarily at the level of transcription. For example, Tat down-regulates MHC class II by preventing the interaction of cyclin T1 with the class II transactivator CIITA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. It is conceivable that Tat, being able to interact with a variety of host factors required for HIV transactivation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>], at the same time pulls these factors away from specific host genes, altering transcription from these promoters. Genome-wide expression profiling indeed revealed that Tat overexpression resulted in down-modulation of many cellular genes, possibly through targeting of general factors such as the SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex and the p300 acetyltransferase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>]. Hence, <italic>HMBOX1 </italic>adds to the list of genes being down modulated by Tat overexpression. It is possible that during the establishment of the HOS_A4 cell line there has been a positive selection of integration loci where Tat induced repression of transcription. If expression of the endogenous gene interferes in <italic>cis </italic>with the expression of the provirus, the net result of Tat induction would have been of increased LTR-driven expression due also in part to the decrease of <italic>HMBOX1 </italic>expression. However, the number of HIV-1 nascent RNAs in Tat-transfected HOS_A4 cells that were negative for <italic>HMBOX1 </italic>expression was similar to the number of those where instead <italic>HMBOX1 </italic>was active (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6D</xref>).</p><p>Another important finding of this work was that in some cells expression of the endogenous <italic>HMBOX1 </italic>gene and of the provirus coexisted at the same transcription site. This finding could not be anticipated since it was believed that transcriptional interference should have occurred. Transcriptional interference is the suppressive influence of one transcriptional process directly and in <italic>cis</italic>, on a second transcriptional process [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>]. Several combinations of the disposition of the two transcription units produce different effects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>]. For example, two promoters firing in opposite orientation would end up in collision of the two converging transcription elongation complexes. In HOS_A4 cells instead, the two promoters elongate in the same direction allowing a possible transcriptional interference through occlusion of the downstream promoter. In such model transcription from the upstream <italic>HMBOX1 </italic>promoter should transiently preclude the occupation by RNAPII and/or associated transcription factors of the downstream LTR promoter. Alternatively, the LTR could pose a roadblock to the progress of the transcription-elongation complex firing from the <italic>HMBOX1 </italic>promoter resulting in its inhibition of expression from one allele.</p><p>The observation that in the absence of Tat transcription both <italic>HMBOX1 </italic>alleles were equally expressed while expression from the viral LTR remained undetectable might indicate that transcription elongation of RNAPII across the <italic>HMBOX1 </italic>gene occluded the viral LTR. The situation changed dramatically in the presence of Tat. Transcription from the viral LTR is switched on as shown in RT PCR as well as demonstrated by the appearance of the viral transcript in RNA FISH. As discussed previously, Tat repressed <italic>HMBOX1 </italic>expression while allowing provirus transcription. However, in a subset of cells, expression of both genes coexisted. Recent data also analyzed HIV proviral gene expression from within a cellular gene [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>]. Work by Peterlin's group showed transcriptional interference occurring from elongating polymerase firing from the host gene [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>], whereas work from Silicano's laboratory showed that elongating polymerase from the host gene could enhance HIV transcription when orientated in the same direction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>]. It is difficult to compare directly these data with those presented here since different cell lines and host cell genes were studied. However the findings presented in this work show an alternative situation that will require further analysis to understand the molecular basis of the phenomenon.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>In this work HIV-1 gene expression was studied from within the endogenous gene <italic>HMBOX1</italic>. Transcriptional Tat-transactivation of the viral LTR resulted in up-regulation of HIV-1 transcription while it repressed HMBOX1 gene expression in both alleles, independent of vector integration. Hence, it could be proposed that HIV-1 genome insertion in genes repressed by Tat could be an advantage for the virus allowing its transactivation from a low-transcribing endogenous gene. It has also been observed that both HIV-1 and <italic>HMBOX1 </italic>gene expression may occur at the same genomic location in the same cell, allowing speculation on the lack mutual interference between transcription units.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Plasmids and cells</title><p>Plasmid pHIV-Intro was derived from the plasmid pEV731 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>] by cloning 24 MS2 repeats into the NotI restriction site.
