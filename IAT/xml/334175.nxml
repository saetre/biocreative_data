Alternatively the active promoter is bound by a transcription initiation complex. We have characterized and purified a protein Adf-2 that binds specifically to this direct repeat motif 5'TCTCAGTGCA3', present at +8 and -202 of the distal RNA start site. DNase I footprinting, methylation interference, and UV-crosslinking analyses showed that both direct repeats interact in vitro with a nuclear protein of approximately 120 kilodaltons (kDa). We purified Adf-2 through multiple rounds of sequence-specific DNA affinity chromatography. Southwestern analysis showed that the purified 120 KDa polypeptide binds the Adf-2 motif efficiently as a monomer or homomultimer. In vivo titrations of Adf-2 activity with the Adf-2 motif by transient co-transfection competitions in different Drosophila cell lines suggested that Adf-2 is a cell-specific repressor. Adf-2 has been detected ubiquitously in vitro, but is functional in vivo as a sequence-specific DNA binding protein and repressor only in the cells that have the inactive distal promoter. We discuss the possibility that an activation process is required for Adf-2 protein to bind DNA and function in vivo.</p><sec><title>Images</title><fig id="F1"><graphic xlink:href="nar00228-0096-a" xlink:role="4483"/></fig><fig id="F2"><graphic xlink:href="nar00228-0097-a" xlink:role="4484"/></fig><fig id="F3"><graphic xlink:href="nar00228-0097-b" xlink:role="4484"/></fig><fig id="F4"><graphic xlink:href="nar00228-0098-a" xlink:role="4485"/></fig><fig id="F5"><graphic xlink:href="nar00228-0098-b" xlink:role="4485"/></fig><fig id="F6"><graphic xlink:href="nar00228-0100-a" xlink:role="4487"/></fig></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><supplementary-material content-type="scanned-pages"><graphic xlink:href="nar00228-0094.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="4481"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00228-0095.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="4482"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00228-0096.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="4483"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00228-0097.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="4484"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00228-0098.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="4485"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00228-0099.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="4486"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00228-0100.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="4487"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00228-0101.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="4488"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00228-0102.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="4489"/></supplementary-material></body></article>
