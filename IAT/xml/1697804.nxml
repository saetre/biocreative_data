In <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae </italic>Rad23, Ddi1 and Dsk2 are the three UBL-UBA proteins, which are hypothesized to shuttle ubiquitinated substrates to the proteasome for degradation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>] due to their ability to interact with the proteasome through their UBL domains [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>] as well as with ubiquitin and polyubiquitinated substrates through their UBA domains [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. Consistent with the shuttling hypothesis, downregulation of human <italic>RAD23 </italic>(hHR23) using siRNA induces accumulation of p53 which is known to be continuously degraded by the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. In addition, yeast Rad23 is sufficient for docking of ubiquitin conjugates to proteasomes isolated from a strain carrying a mutation in the ubiquitin-interacting-motif (UIM) of the proteasome subunit Rpn10 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>], which is thought to act as a receptor that binds ubiquitinated substrates. Furthermore, proteasomes isolated from a <italic>rad23&#x00394;dsk2&#x00394; </italic>strain are defective in their association with endogenous ubiquitin conjugates and this defect is stronger than the one observed in <italic>rpn10 </italic>mutants that are unable to bind ubiquitin, suggesting that the UBL-UBA proteins are more active than Rpn10 in delivery of ubiquitinated substrates to the proteasome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>].</p><p>Interestingly, none of the UBL-UBA proteins are essential for viability. Single deletion of <italic>RAD23 </italic>or <italic>DSK2 </italic>induces partial stabilization of a model degradation-substrate whereas the <italic>rad23&#x00394;dsk2&#x00394; </italic>double deletion completely stabilizes the substrate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>] and accumulates endogenous polyubiquitinated proteins at high temperatures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>], suggesting that Rad23 and Dsk2 function redundantly in ubiquitin-mediated protein degradation. In addition to these genetic interactions, UBL-UBA proteins have been shown to physically interact, forming both homodimers and heterodimers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. Dsk2 and Rad23 homodimerization occurs through their UBL and/or UBA domains [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>], whereas Ddi1 homodimerization requires neither of these domains [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. Although, in vivo, heterodimerization of UBL-UBA proteins is likely to also occur via bridging molecules [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>], direct interactions between the UBL and UBA domains promoting heterodimer formation have been demonstrated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. Rad23 homo and heterodimerization of UBL-UBA family members has been suggested to play a role in regulating their interactions with other components of the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway and to lead to the formation of multimeric complexes with polyubiquitin chains [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. Such interactions could increase the targeting efficiency of ubiquitinated substrates for degradation.</p><p>One of the cellular processes that relies on ubiquitin-proteasome dependent proteolysis is cell cycle progression. Cell division is a complex process; it requires that a series of steps are fulfilled in a specific and unidirectional order. When cell cycle regulation fails genetic instability and aneuploidy often arise, which are hallmarks of and might initiate cancers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. A long list of cell cycle regulators are known to be degraded by the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Several pieces of evidence suggest a role for UBL-UBA containing proteins in cell cycle control. In budding yeast, overexpression of Dsk2 is toxic, inducing accumulation of ubiquitinated substrates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>] and arresting the cells in mitosis with abnormal nuclear position and short bipolar spindles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. Ddi1 is involved in the degradation of an SCF component, the F-box protein Ufo1, involved in the G1/S transition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>], as well as one of its targets the Ho endonuclease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. Overexpression of <italic>DDI1 </italic>or <italic>RAD23 </italic>suppresses the temperature sensitive phenotype of a <italic>PDS1 </italic>mutant allele (<italic>pds1&#x02013;128</italic>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. Combined deletion of the <italic>RAD23 </italic>and <italic>DDI1 </italic>C-terminal UBAs, but not the single deletions, results in premature loss of cohesion and spindle elongation in the presence of hydroxyurea (HU), which is known to activate the S-phase checkpoint [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. In addition, the <italic>dsk2&#x00394;rad23&#x00394; </italic>double deletion, but not the single deletions, is reported to be defective in Spindle Pole Body (SPB) duplication at high temperature, inducing the formation of monopolar spindles and subsequently arresting the cells in mitosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. These results suggest redundant roles for the UBL-UBA proteins in cell cycle events.</p><p>Here we demonstrate that deleting <italic>RAD23 </italic>in combination with either <italic>DDI1 </italic>or <italic>DSK2 </italic>induces cell cycle delays in the G2/M-phase and anaphase at high temperatures, indicating that <italic>DDI1 </italic>and <italic>DSK2 </italic>are redundant with <italic>RAD23</italic>. In addition, we provide evidence that <italic>DDI1 </italic>and <italic>DSK2 </italic>are not functionally redundant and therefore that <italic>RAD23 </italic>has at least two cell cycle-related functions. This hypothesis is supported by the synthetic effect observed in the triple deletion, confirming that <italic>RAD23-DDI1 </italic>redundancy is different from that of <italic>RAD23-DSK2 </italic>(i.e. the triple deletion shows an additive phenotype). Surprisingly however, the arrest is not due to failure in SPB duplication.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title><italic>RAD23</italic>, <italic>DDI1 </italic>and <italic>DSK2 </italic>have partially redundant roles in cell cycle progression</title><p>Possible roles for Rad23 and Ddi1 in the cell cycle have been suggested by their ability to rescue the temperature sensitivity of <italic>pds1&#x02013;128 </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>], while Rad23 and Dsk2 have been reported to have roles in SPB duplication and Dsk2 overexpression leads to mitotic arrest [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. To test whether the three yeast UBL-UBA proteins have a redundant role in cell cycle progression we took a genetic approach, obtaining strains deleted for each one of the UBL-UBA genes (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>) as well as all the double deletion combinations and the triple deletion, and asked whether any redundancy in terms of functions in cell cycle progression could be observed.</p><table-wrap position="float" id="T1"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Yeast strains used in this study</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><tbody><tr><td align="right">1167</td><td align="left"><italic>MATalpha pds1&#x02013;128</italic></td></tr><tr><td align="right">1494</td><td align="left"><italic>pds1&#x02013;128 GAL-ddi1&#x00394;UBA [HIS]</italic></td></tr><tr><td align="right">1493</td><td align="left"><italic>pds1&#x02013;128 GAL-DDI1 [HIS]</italic></td></tr><tr><td align="right">1671</td><td align="left"><italic>MATa bar1&#x00394; GFP:TUB1::uRA3 ARG4</italic></td></tr><tr><td align="right">2073</td><td align="left"><italic>MATalpha pds1&#x02013;128 GAL-ddi1-A407L</italic></td></tr><tr><td align="right">2074</td><td align="left"><italic>MATalpha pds1&#x02013;128 GAL-ddi1-L426A</italic></td></tr><tr><td align="right">L153</td><td align="left"><italic>MATalpha pds1&#x02013;128 arg 4 GAL:ddi1&#x00394;184&#x02013;285</italic></td></tr><tr><td align="right">L156</td><td align="left"><italic>MATalpha pds1&#x02013;128 arg 4 GAL:ddi1&#x00394;184&#x02013;285</italic></td></tr><tr><td align="right">L150</td><td align="left"><italic>MATalpha pds1&#x02013;128 arg 4 GAL:DDI1 [LEU]</italic></td></tr><tr><td align="right">L169</td><td align="left"><italic>MATa bar1&#x00394; spc42:GFP [TRP]</italic></td></tr><tr><td align="right">L182</td><td align="left"><italic>MATa bar1&#x00394; dsk2::KAN spc42:GFP [TRP]</italic></td></tr><tr><td align="right">L185</td><td align="left"><italic>MATa bar1&#x00394; rad23::KAN dsk2::KAN SPC42:GFP [TRP]</italic></td></tr><tr><td align="right">L187</td><td align="left"><italic>MATa bar1&#x00394; ddi1::KAN dsk2::KAN SPC42:GFP [TRP]</italic></td></tr><tr><td align="right">L194</td><td align="left"><italic>MATa bar1&#x00394; rad23::KAN SPC42:GFP [TRP]</italic></td></tr><tr><td align="right">L196</td><td align="left"><italic>MATa bar1&#x00394; ddi1::KAN rad23::KAN SPC42:GFP [TRP]</italic></td></tr><tr><td align="right">L201</td><td align="left"><italic>MATa bar1&#x00394; ddi1::KAN rad23::KAN dsk2::KAN TUB1:GFP [URA]</italic></td></tr><tr><td align="right">L218</td><td align="left"><italic>MATa bar1&#x00394; ddi1::KAN dsk2::KAN rad23::KAN SPC42:GFP [TRP]</italic></td></tr><tr><td align="right">L221</td><td align="left"><italic>MATa bar1&#x00394; ddi1::KAN SPC42:GFP [TRP]</italic></td></tr><tr><td align="right">L263</td><td align="left"><italic>MATa bar1&#x00394; ddi1::KAN dsk2::KAN TUB1:GFP::URA3 RAD23&#x00394;UBA2-MYC [TRP] SPC42:GFP [TRP]</italic></td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><p>Although none of the single deletions have temperature sensitive phenotypes, the <italic>rad23&#x00394;dsk2&#x00394; </italic>double deletion has been reported to accumulate ubiquitinated substrates at 37&#x000b0;C [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>], as well as have a temperature sensitivity phenotype at 35&#x000b0;C [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. Partially consistent with these results, we observed that <italic>rad23&#x00394;</italic>, <italic>ddi1&#x00394; </italic>or <italic>dsk2&#x00394; </italic>singly deleted strains as well as <italic>rad23&#x00394;ddi1&#x00394; </italic>and <italic>ddi1&#x00394;dsk2&#x00394; </italic>doubles were not temperature sensitive. Surprisingly, the <italic>rad23&#x00394;dsk2&#x00394; </italic>double deletion was also alive at 37&#x000b0;C. In contrast, the <italic>rad23&#x00394;dsk2&#x00394;ddi1&#x00394; </italic>triple deletion was temperature sensitive at 37&#x000b0;C, suggesting the existence of redundant roles for Ddi1, Dsk2 and Rad23 at high temperatures.</p><p>Next we asked whether these proteins were involved in cell cycle progression. Briefly, all the combinations of single, double and the triple deletions were incubated in YEPD overnight at 30&#x000b0;C, diluted the next morning and incubated at 37&#x000b0;C. Cell cycle progression was evaluated by scoring the proportions of the different cell morphologies: unbudded cells (G1, yellow), cells with small to medium buds (S phase, blue) and dumbbells (G2/M, red) (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>, upper panel). Samples were also taken for FACScan analysis of DNA content (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>, lower panel). Interestingly both <italic>rad23&#x00394;dsk2&#x00394; </italic>and <italic>rad23&#x00394;ddi1&#x00394; </italic>showed a slight accumulation of cells in G2/M, but the accumulation observed in the <italic>rad23&#x00394;ddi1&#x00394;dsk2&#x00394; </italic>triple deletion reached ~70% after 6 hours at the non-permissive temperature (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). On the other hand, cell cycle distribution in the <italic>ddi1&#x00394;dsk2&#x00394; </italic>double deletion was not different from those of the single deletions. These results suggest that <italic>RAD23 </italic>is redundant with <italic>DDI1 </italic>and <italic>DSK2 </italic>but that <italic>DDI1 </italic>and <italic>DSK2 </italic>do not share a common functional role needed for timely cell cycle progression. Furthermore, these data suggest a synthetic effect, that is, <italic>RAD23 </italic>redundancy with <italic>DDI1 </italic>is different than that of <italic>RAD23 </italic>with <italic>DSK2 </italic>and the effect seen in the triple deletion is the result of both defects combined (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Deletion of <italic>DDI1</italic>, <italic>DSK2 </italic>and <italic>RAD23 </italic>has a synthetic effect on cell cycle progression at high temperatures</bold>. (A) Cells were grown to mid-log phase in liquid YEPD at 30&#x000b0;C then shifted to 37&#x000b0;C for 0, 4 and 6 hrs. Cell cycle distribution was determined by bud morphology: cells in G1 are unbudded (yellow), S-phase cells with small buds (blue) and G2/M cells with large buds (red). Large buds (dumbbells) are defined as cells where the bud is as big as the mother cell. In parallel, samples were taken for FACScan analysis of DNA content (lower panel).</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1747-1028-1-28-1"/></fig></sec><sec><title>The c-terminal UBA domain of Rad23 is necessary for its cell cycle functions</title><p>Although both UBA domains of Rad23 have been shown to bind ubiquitin both in yeast [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>] and in humans (hHR23A) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>], there is a specific requirement for its c-terminal UBA domain (UBA2) in mediating cell cycle arrest after binding to the HIV-1 Vpr protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. Therefore we tested whether UBA2 is required for the cell cycle function of Rad23 by examining cell cycle progression in a strain in which the sole UBL-UBA protein is <italic>rad23&#x00394;UBA2 </italic>(Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). A recent study suggested that the C-terminal UBA domain of Rad23 acts as a stabilization domain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>], preventing proteasome-dependent degradation of RAd23. It was therefore important to determine if <italic>rad23&#x00394;UBA2 </italic>was stable in our strains. As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>, the protein levels of <italic>rad23&#x00394;UBA2 </italic>and Rad23 were identical, whether these genes were expressed from their endogenous promoters or exogenously from the <italic>GAL1 </italic>promoter. This was also the case when we compared the protein levels of Ddi1 and <italic>ddi1&#x00394;UBA </italic>(Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>). After confirming that the wild type and mutant proteins were present in identical amounts in our strains, we spotted serial dilutions of the corresponding strains onto rich medium and grew at a range of temperatures for several days (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>). A partial recovery of the temperature sensitivity of the <italic>rad23&#x00394;ddi1&#x00394;dsk2&#x00394; </italic>triple deletion strain was observed after introducing <italic>rad23&#x00394;UBA2</italic>, but full recovery was observed only when the full-length <italic>RAD23 </italic>gene was introduced (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>). These data suggest that, although both UBA-motifs can interact with ubiquitin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>], full Rad23 activity requires both UBA domains.</p><fig position="float" id="F2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p><bold>Cell cycle arrest in cells lacking <italic>DDI1</italic>, <italic>DSK2 </italic>and the c-terminal UBA (UBA2) domain of Rad23</bold>.

After release from a G1 arrest induced by alpha-factor treatment at the non-permissive temperature of 37&#x000b0;C, re-entry into the cell cycle and budding occurred with the same kinetics in these strains and in a wild type control. G2/M accumulation (red line) in the wild type strain peaked at 120 minutes and decreased to 28% 140 minutes after release as the cells entered the next cell cycle. Initiation of a second cell cycle was also indicated by the presence of a second wave of small-budded cells (blue line) appearing at 130 minutes. In contrast, the triple deletion strain entered G2/M with the same kinetics as wild type, but remained there even after 140 minutes (75% in G2/M).

This finding suggests that <italic>rad23&#x00394;UBA2 </italic>partially alleviates the delay and confirms that complete function of Rad23 requires the full-length protein and that the internal UBA domain (UBA1) can only partially alleviate the G2/M delay.</p></sec><sec><title>G2/M arrest is not due to a failure in SPB duplication</title><p>Since defects in SPB duplication leading to G2/M arrest have been reported for strains lacking <italic>RAD23 </italic>and <italic>DSK2 </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>], we asked if there is a SPB duplication defect in the triple deletion strain.

Wild type or <italic>rad23&#x00394;ddi1&#x00394;dsk2&#x00394; </italic>triple deletion strains expressing <italic>SPC42:GFP </italic>were arrested in G1 using alpha-factor and released into fresh medium at the restrictive temperature.

Surprisingly, the triple deletion strain separated SPBs normally (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A&#x02013;C</xref>). The kinetics of SPB separation in the triple deletion were indistinguishable from that of the wild type strain (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3D</xref>), except that the triple deleted cells arrested as large budded cells with two SPBs (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3E,D</xref>). In the wild type strain, SPB separation initiated at ~40 minutes after release from G1 at the restrictive temperature (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3C</xref>, yellow line) and peaked at ~80 minutes. In accordance, the population of cells with a single SPB signal (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3C</xref>, blue line) was depleted within the same timeframe. After 100 minutes a second wave of cells with a single SPB signal peaked, followed by a second wave of SPB separation as cells enter another cell cycle. A mixed population of unbudded cells with single SPB signals and re-budded cells with newly separated SPBs could be observed 110 minutes after the alpha-factor release (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>, arrow head), consistent with cells entering the next cell cycle. <italic>ddi1&#x00394;dsk2&#x00394;rad23&#x00394; </italic>cells separated their SPBs with the same kinetics as wild type cells, but then delayed or arrested with large buds and two SPBs (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3C</xref>, red line).

Arrest in G2 or anaphase could have been due to defects in spindle assembly. Therefore, to further explore these results and examine in more detail the dynamics of spindle assembly in the triple deletion, we constructed strains harboring a <italic>TUB1:GFP </italic>gene (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>). In agreement with the results observed in the <italic>SPC42:GFP </italic>strains, wild type cells and <italic>ddi1&#x00394;dsk2&#x00394;rad23&#x00394; </italic>cells assembled their spindles with the same timing, relative to bud emergence (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3F</xref>).</p><p>In a final series of experiments, we performed time courses in which cells were released from a nocodazole arrest at the restrictive temperature of 37&#x000b0;C (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3G</xref>). The percentage of wild type cells with G2-SPBs (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3G</xref>, top panel, blue line) began to decrease by 20 minutes after release from nocodazole and cells with G2-SPBs were completely depleted (i.e. the cells had undergone anaphase) 90 minutes after the release. In contrast, the triple deleted cells showed a delay in anaphase onset, as judged by the distance between the SPBs, and ~30% remained in G2 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3G</xref>, top panel, green line) at the time wild type G2-cells had been completely depleted. Similar data were obtained in strains expressing <italic>TUB1-GFP</italic>. Within about 10 minutes after release of the nocodazole block, almost all large budded cells had assembled G2 spindles (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3G</xref>, lower panel). Wild type cells initiated spindle elongation ~20 minutes after release from nocodazole and by 40 minutes most of the cells had completed anaphase (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3G</xref>, lower panel, blue line). In contrast, some <italic>ddi1&#x00394;dsk2&#x00394;rad23&#x00394; </italic>cells remained in G2, as judged by their short (1&#x02013;4 &#x003bc;M) spindles, even 90 minutes after the release (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3G</xref>, lower panel, green line). Together, these results suggest <italic>ddi1&#x00394;dsk2&#x00394;rad23&#x00394; </italic>cells delay cell cycle progression at two distinct points when grown at high temperatures: a fraction of the triple deleted cells delay before anaphase with duplicated SPBs but short spindles, whereas other cells delay in a mid-anaphase or late-anaphase state with partly-elongated or fully-elongated spindles. This suggests that combined deletion of <italic>RAD23</italic>, <italic>DDI1 </italic>and <italic>DSK2 </italic>affects spindle dynamics and cell cycle progression, but not SPB duplication.</p></sec><sec><title>Ddi1 homodimerization is necessary for <italic>pds1&#x02013;128 </italic>rescue</title><p>In addition to their abilities to bind ubiquitin and the proteasome, Dsk2, Ddi1 and Rad23 share the ability to form homodimers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. The importance of dimerization for the function of these proteins is not known however. Dsk2 and Rad23 homodimerization involves their UBL and/or UBA domains [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>], which makes it difficult to obtain mutants that disrupt homodimerization but remain capable of binding to ubiquitin and the proteasome. Ddi1, on the other hand does not require either the UBA or the UBL domains for homodimerization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. Therefore we tested whether homodimerization is important for the role of Ddi1 in one specific cell cycle related event; stabilization of Pds1&#x02013;128.

We investigated this possibility by removing all three UBL-UBA proteins to find that they are essential for viability and cell cycle progression at high temperatures. Interestingly, these analyses did not provide evidence for a functional overlap between Ddi1 and Dsk2, but rather indicate that Rad23 has redundant functions with each of Ddi1 and Dsk2. A strain deleted for all three of these genes exhibited a synthetic effect, suggesting that <italic>RAD23 </italic>has at least two independent roles that are required for viability at high temperatures; one of them shared with <italic>DDI1 </italic>and the other one with <italic>DSK2</italic>. Interestingly, these redundancies do not seem to be a product of evolutionary divergence of duplicated genes, since neither <italic>RAD23, DSK2 </italic>or <italic>DDI1 </italic>are elements in the duplication blocks that have been described to have arisen after the yeast genome duplication event. Furthermore, they lie next to elements from different duplication blocks: block 28 for <italic>RAD23</italic>, block 46 for <italic>DSK2 </italic>and block 13 for <italic>DDI1 </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>], which further suggests that they are functionally related, but not evolutionarily related.</p><p>Since these proteins have been shown to be involved in cell cycle related phenomena [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>], we examined cell cycle progression at the restrictive temperature and found that <italic>ddi1&#x00394;dsk2&#x00394;rad23&#x00394; </italic>cells arrest or delay in G2/M and anaphase. Surprisingly, the arrest observed in the triple deletion was not due to a failure in SPB duplication. We were also not able to observe SPB duplication defects in the <italic>rad23&#x00394;dsk2&#x00394; </italic>double deletion strains at 37&#x000b0;C (data not shown), as had been previously reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. We currently do not know the reason for this contradictory result, but it could be due to differences in the genetic background between the BF264-<italic>15Daub </italic>(this study) and S288c strains [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>].</p><p>Interestingly, when we examined the kinetics of spindle elongation (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>) we found that the arrest observed in the triple deletion strain was not homogeneous. There were two distinct populations: cells that arrested with G2-like spindles and had a single nucleus, and cells that arrested with partly or fully elongated spindles and divided nuclei. One possibility is that the <italic>ddi1&#x00394;dsk2&#x00394;rad23&#x00394; </italic>cells progressively accumulate ubiquitinated substrates that somehow interfere with degradation of other cell cycle regulatory proteins. The existence of two arrest points might therefore be a reflection of two cell cycle stages at which proteasome function is required: some of the mutant cells may have accumulated enough substrates to enforce arrest at the earlier time point whereas other cells might be able to reach the latter cell cycle stage. However, the specific reasons why subpopulations of the triple deleted cells arrest at the earlier or later time point remain to be determined.</p><p>The ability of UBL-UBA proteins to both hetero and homodimerize, as well as to bind to polyubiquitin in tandem [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>] suggests the possibility that UBL-UBA dimerization regulates binding of these proteins to ubiquitinated substrates, possibly by bringing more than one UBL-UBA protein in close proximity to the ubiquitin chain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. Ddi1 is the only UBL-UBA protein in which homodimerization does not involve the UBL or UBA domains, allowing the study of the role of dimerization without affecting its interaction with ubiquitin or the proteasome. We have shown that disruption of Ddi1 homodimerization affects Ddi1's ability to rescue the <italic>pds1&#x02013;128 </italic>temperature sensitivity, suggesting that Ddi1 homodimerization is necessary for its role in Pds1&#x02013;128 stabilization. Ddi1 dimerization does not involve the cystein residues at positions 276 and 300 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A</xref>, blue) since a C276S C300S double mutant is still able to interact with wild type Ddi1 (data not shown). Interestingly, it has been suggested that Pds1&#x02013;128 stabilization by Ddi1 might be due to de-ubiquitination of Pds1&#x02013;128 through the aspartyl-protease domain of Ddi1 (underlined in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A</xref>)[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]. Our results suggest that this could be possible. First, the <italic>ddi1&#x00394;184&#x02013;285 </italic>allele lacks half of the aspartyl-protease domain. Second, the aspartyl protease domain requires dimerization to become active, and the <italic>ddi1&#x00394;184&#x02013;285 </italic>allele does not dimerize, suggesting that the predicted Ddi1 aspartyl-protease activity is not functional in <italic>ddi1&#x00394;184&#x02013;285 </italic>and could hypothetically be involved in <italic>pds1&#x02013;128 </italic>rescue.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Redundancy of function among the budding yeast UBL-UBA proteins can be predicted based on their common abilities to bind ubiquitin and the proteasome.
