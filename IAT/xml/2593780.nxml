Comparative genomics and structural analyses suggest that they are co-orthologs of the human IGFBP-2 gene. Biochemical assays show that both zebrafish <italic>igfbp-2a</italic> and <italic>-2b</italic> encode secreted proteins that bind IGFs. These two genes exhibit distinct spatiotemporal expression patterns. During embryogenesis, IGFBP-2a mRNA is initially detected in the lens, then in the brain boundary vasculature, and subsequently becomes highly expressed in the liver. In the adult stage, liver has the highest levels of IGFBP-2a mRNA, followed by the brain. Low levels of IGFBP-2a mRNA were detected in muscle and in the gonad in male adults only. IGFBP-2b mRNA is detected initially in all tissues at low levels, but later becomes abundant in the liver. In adult males, IGFBP-2b mRNA is only detected in the liver. In adult females, it is also found in the gut, kidney, ovary, and muscle. To gain insights into how the IGFBP-2 genes may have evolved through partitioning of ancestral functions, functional and mechanistic studies were carried out. Expression of zebrafish IGFBP-2a and -2b caused significant decreases in the growth and developmental rates and their effects are comparable to that of human IGFBP-2. IGFBP-2 mutants with altered IGF binding-, RGD-, and heparin-binding sites were generated and their actions examined. While mutating the RGD and heparin binding sites had little effect, altering the IGF binding site abolished its biological activity.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions/Significance</title><p>These results suggest that IGFBP-2 is a conserved regulatory protein and it inhibits growth and development primarily by binding to and inhibiting IGF actions <italic>in vivo</italic>.

In extracellular fluids, these peptides are bound to and regulated by a family of IGF binding proteins (IGFBPs) and IGFBP related proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003926-Hwa1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003926-Clemmons1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003926-Honegger1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>. Most IGFBPs are present in circulation, where they act to prolong the half-life of circulating IGFs. IGFBPs are also expressed in many peripheral tissues and are present in various biological fluids. In these local environments, IGFBPs regulate the availability of IGFs to the cell surface IGF receptors, thereby regulating the net biological activity of the IGF signaling pathway. Indeed, studies using a wide variety of mammalian cell culture systems have shown that IGFBPs have the ability to inhibit and/or potentiate the biological actions of IGFs, and some IGFBPs even exhibit ligand-independent biological activities <italic>in vitro</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003926-Clemmons1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003926-Firth1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003926-Duan1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>There are six distinct IGFBPs, designated as IGFBP-1 to -6, and each is coded by a single copy gene in humans and other mammals <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003926-Clemmons1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003926-Firth1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>. These IGFBPs all contain a highly conserved N-terminal domain, a conserved C-terminal domain, and a variable central linker (L) domain. The N-domain contains 12 conserved cysteine residues. C-domains have six conserved cysteine residues. These cysteine residues form intra-domain disulfide bonds <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003926-Forbes1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003926-Neumann1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref> and help to shape the globular structure of the N- and C-domains. The divergent L-domain often contains sites for post-translational regulation, including glycosylation, phosphorylation, and proteolysis. Despite similar domain arrangements, each IGFBP has distinct structural features. For example, IGFBP-2 has an arginine-glycine-glutamate (RGD) sequence in its C-domain and a heparin binding domain/motif (HBD) in its L domain. Comparative studies have shown that the gene, protein primary structure, and biological actions of IGFBPs are conserved in non-mammalian vertebrates <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003926-Wood1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>. In agreement with these structural features, both IGF- dependent and independent actions of IGFBP-2 has been reported in various mammalian culture systems, and RGD and/or heparin binding motifs have been implicated in the IGF-independent actions on cell growth and migration <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003926-Schutt1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>. Ubiquitous expression of IGFBP-2 transgenes results in growth inhibition in mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003926-Hoeflich1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003926-Hoeflich2">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>. Although IGFBP-2 is the most abundantly expressed IGFBP in fetal tissues, the IGFBP-2 knockout mice were viable and fertile, and their prenatal and postnatal body weights were similar to those of their wild-type litter mates <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003926-Wood2">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>. However, these mice had reduced spleen and enlarged liver.

Targeted knockdown of zebrafish IGFBP-2a by antisense morpholino (MO) resulted in delayed development, reduced body growth, and disruptions to cardiovascular development <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003926-Wood3">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Many teleost fish, including zebrafish, experienced an additional genome wide duplication event <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003926-Taylor1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003926-Postlethwait1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>. Since then, while many of the duplicated genes have been lost, a substantial percentage of the duplicates have been retained. As a result, fish often have two co-orthologs in contrast to a single copy gene in humans and other mammals. One such co-orthologous pair is the zebrafish <italic>igf-1r</italic> genes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003926-Maures1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003926-Schlueter1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>. The retention of a particular pair of genes provided the unique opportunity to gain insights into the impact of evolution in reshaping genes and their roles in physiology. In this study, we have identified two IGFBP-2 genes in the zebrafish, medaka, fugu, tetraodon, and the stickleback genomes using a comparative genomics approach. Our molecular and functional analysis on the two zebrafish IGFBP-2 genes suggests that they have undergone subfunctionalization partitioning by evolving distinct gene expression patterns, while their protein functionality remains largely unchanged. Furthermore, taking advantage of the amenability of the zebrafish model, we investigated the relative contributions of the IGF binding domain, RGD, and HBD in IGFBP-2 actions <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Zebrafish and other teleost fish have two IGFBP-2 genes</title><p>In addition to the previously reported IGFBP-2 gene <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003926-Duan3">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>, we identified another IGFBP-2 like gene (ENSDARP00000019643) by searching the zebrafish genome. Using 5&#x02032;- and 3&#x02032;-RACE, its full-length cDNA was determined (EF507265). The encoded protein has a putative signal peptide of 17 amino acids (aa) and a mature protein of 248 aa with a predicted molecular mass of 29.7 kDa. Structural analysis suggests that there are 12 cysteine residues in its N-terminal domain (residues 1&#x02013;79) and 6 cysteine residues in its C-terminal domain (residues 152&#x02013;231) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003926-g001">Fig. 1A</xref>). A typical IGFBP motif is present in the N-domain and there is a thyroglobulin-1 motif in the C-domain. Among various members of the IGFBP family, the new IGFBP shares higher identities with IGFBP-2 than with other known IGFBPs. The overall sequence identities of this protein with the six human IGFBPs are 33&#x00025; (IGFBP-1), 44&#x00025; (IGFBP-2), 32&#x00025; (IGFBP-3), 37&#x00025; (IGFBP-4), 33&#x00025; (IGFBP-5), and 30&#x00025; (IGFBP-6). Its identities with the known zebrafish IGFBPs are 33&#x00025; (IGFBP-1), 62&#x00025; (IGFBP-2), 29&#x00025; (IGFBP-3), and 31&#x00025; (IGFBP-5), respectively. Human and other vertebrate IGFBP-2s contain an Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD) sequence in the C-terminal domain <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003926-Hwa1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003926-Clemmons1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>. An RGD motif is also present in the zebrafish IGFBP at a.a.position 226 to 228. The putative heparin binding motif (PKKXRP) located in the central domain in all the known mammalian IGFBP-2 is absent in the zebrafish protein. Phylogenetic analysis using full-length amino acid sequences of known vertebrate IGFBPs grouped the newly identified IGFBP into the IGFBP-2 clade (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003926-g001">Fig. 1B</xref>), indicating that it is a co-ortholog of human IGFBP-2.

The conclusion that there are two IGFBP-2 genes in these teleost genomes is supported by phylogenetic and detailed structural data. Fish IGFBP-2a and -2b share much higher identities with human IGFBP-2 than with other human IGFBPs. All known vertebrate IGFBP-2s contain an RGD sequence in the C-terminal domain<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003926-Clemmons1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>. An RGD motif is also present in the zebrafish IGFBP-2a and -2b. Phylogenetic analyses grouped the newly identified genes into the IGFBP-2 clade. The strongest evidence came from the conserved synteny analysis. In humans, IGFBP-2 and -5 genes are located next to each other on the same chromosome in a tail-to-tail orientation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003926-Hwa1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>. In this study, we found that <italic>igfbp-2a</italic> and <italic>igfbp-5a</italic> are neighboring genes located on LG6 in a tail-to-tail orientation, resembling the situation of human IGFBP-2 and -5 genes localized on chromosome 2. If <italic>igfbp-2a</italic> and <italic>igfbp-5a</italic> arose by a chromosomal duplication event, one would expect that <italic>igfbp-2b</italic> should also be located next to another <italic>igfbp-5b</italic> gene. Indeed, our analysis shows that <italic>igfbp-2b</italic> and <italic>igfbp-5b</italic> genes are neighboring genes on LG9. In addition to these IGFBP genes, we were able to identify other orthologous genes between zebrafish LG9 and human Chr.2. This conserved synteny strongly argues that zebrafish <italic>igfbp-2a</italic> and <italic>igfbp-2b</italic> are co-orthologs of the human IGFBP-2 gene.</p><p>The fact that there are also two IGFBP-2 genes in the medaka, fugu, tetraodon, and the stickleback implies that the origin of this gene duplication is ancient, likely before the divergence of ray-fin fish and tetrapods. This notion is also supported by the phylogenetic analysis data and is in good agreement with the notion that a genome duplication event occurred in the teleost lineage &#x0223c;350 million years ago, prior to the beginning of the teleost radiation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003926-Taylor1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003926-Postlethwait1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003926-Amores1">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref>. While the majority of duplicated genes have been lost since the genome duplication event in the teleost lineage, a substantial percentage of the duplicates have been retained. When the putative zebrafish orthologs of 74 human genes on chromosome 17 were examined, Postlethwait et al. found that 15 (20&#x00025;) are present as duplicate genes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003926-Postlethwait2">&#x0005b;25&#x0005d;</xref>. Like the mammals, the IGF signaling systems in teleosts are composed of IGF ligands, receptors, and IGFBPs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003926-Wood1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003926-Duan2">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>. It has been shown previously that zebrafish contain two <italic>igf-1r</italic> genes and two insulin receptor genes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003926-Maures1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>. Recent studies suggest that there are two <italic>igf-1</italic> genes and two <italic>igf-2</italic> genes in zebrafish (our unpublished data). Additionally, there is also evidence indicating that zebrafish have two <italic>igfbp-1</italic> genes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003926-Kamei1">&#x0005b;26&#x0005d;</xref>. In this study, we have shown that there are two <italic>igfbp-2</italic> and two <italic>igfbp-5</italic> genes in zebrafish. Therefore, it appears that all major components in the fish IGF signaling pathway are retained as duplicates. This high rate of gene retention in genes belonging to the IGF signaling pathway in the ray-fin fish is interesting. Unlike mammals, most teleosts do not reach a static adult size but continue to grow indeterminantly well beyond puberty. Given its central importance in growth regulation, it is possible that the retention of many duplicates of major players in the IGF signaling system may play an important role in the continuous growth pattern of the teleost.</p><p>The retention of two functional igfbp-2 genes in zebrafish also provided a unique opportunity to gain insights into how the IGFBP genes may have evolved through partitioning of ancestral functions. Subfunction partitioning can involve protein structural changes and has important functional and evolutionary consequences <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003926-Postlethwait1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>. Taking advantage of the zebrafish model, we examined the spatial and temporal expression patterns and biological activities of the duplicated <italic>igfbp-2</italic> genes. Analysis of expression patterns for zebrafish <italic>igfbp-2a</italic> and <italic>igfbp-2b</italic> clearly reveal spatial and temporal subfunction partitioning. While zebrafish <italic>igfbp-2b</italic> is expressed throughout the entire early developmental stages in a ubiquitous fashion, <italic>igfbp-2a</italic> mRNA is not detected until 10 hpf in a highly tissue specific and dynamic manner. In the adult stage, these two duplicates are expressed in overlapping yet distinct tissues. While both <italic>igfbp-2a</italic> and <italic>-2b</italic> are highly expressed in the liver in both the adult male and female fish, only IGFBP-2a mRNA was detected in the brain. There appears to be a sexual dimorphism in their expression patterns. IGFBP-2a mRNA was also detected in the muscle and gonad in the male at low levels but not the female adult fish. In contrast, IGFBP-2b mRNA was detected in the gut, kidney, ovary, and muscle in adult female fish only. These gender specific expression patterns are interesting in light of the recent findings that male mice had 66&#x00025; higher circulating IGFBP-2 levels compared with females <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003926-DeMambro1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>. While the duplicated zebrafish IGFBP-2 genes exhibit clear temporal and spatial partitioning in their expression, our previous and current biochemical analysis suggest that the duplicated <italic>igfbp-2</italic> genes have similar biological properties. Both zebrafish IGFBP-2a and -b are secreted proteins that are capable of IGF binding. Furthermore, overexpression of zebrafish IGFBP-2a and -2b in zebrafish embryos had nearly identical phenotypes, i.e., they caused a similar decrease in the growth and developmental rates. These data suggest that the duplicated <italic>igfbp-2</italic> genes encode two functionally equivalent proteins but have evolved distinct spatial and temporal expression patterns.</p><p>A number of <italic>in vivo</italic> studies using transgenic mice have shown that IGFBP-2 has a predominantly inhibitory effect on IGF actions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003926-Firth1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>. Our functional analysis using transgenic zebrafish suggests that the inhibitory action of IGFBP-2 is conserved across species. When overexpressed in developing zebrafish embryos, human IGFBP-2 had a growth inhibitory effect similar to that of zebrafish IGFBP-2. While the inhibitory effect of IGFBP-2 can be explained by its competition for IGF binding with the IGF-1R based on biochemical and cell culture studies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003926-Clemmons1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003926-Firth1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003926-Duan1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>, <italic>in vivo</italic> evidence supporting this theory is still scarce. In this study, we have tested this model using transgenic zebrafish embryos. Our data shows that mutation of the major IGF binding site of human IGFBP-2 completely abolished its biological activity in this <italic>in vivo</italic> animal model. These results have provided direct evidence that IGFBP-2 is a conserved regulatory protein and it acts primarily by binding to and inhibiting IGF actions during early development <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p><p>IGF-independent actions of IGFBP-2 have been documented in cultured mammalian cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003926-Clemmons1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003926-Firth1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>. It has been suggested that an RGD motif in human IGFBP-2 may be partially responsible for its cell surface association. The RGD motif in human IGFBP-2 has been reported to be involved in binding to integrin and this interaction is important for IGFBP-2-induced SNB19 glioma cell migration <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003926-Wang1">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref>. Since all known vertebrate IGFBP-2s, including the zebrafish IGFBP-2b reported in this study, have an RGD motif in their C-domains, we tested the possible role of RGD in mediating any biological actions of IGFBP-2 in transgenic zebrafish <italic>in vivo</italic>. We discovered that mutation of the RGD motif in human IGFBP-2 did not cause any notable changes in the growth inhibitory effects of IGFBP-2 in this animal model. This is consistent with the report by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003926-Hoeflich2">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>, which showed that overexpression of an RGE IGFBP-2 mutant did not affect IGFBP-2 cell surface association in transgenic mice.</p><p>In addition to the RGD motif, human IGFBP-2 possesses a putative heparin-binding motif (HBD). Recent studies have suggested that the association of IGFBP-2 with the cell surface or the extracellular matrix is due to its ability to bind to proteoglycans <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003926-Russo1">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref>, but the relative contributions of the HBD <italic>in vivo</italic> is unknown. Taking advantage of the zebrafish model and the fact that the biological action of human IGFBP-2 is conserved, we investigated the role of the HBD <italic>in vivo</italic>. Our results have shown that transgenic zebrafish overexpressing the HBDm were essentially indistinguishable from those overexpressing native human IGFBP-2, indicating that the mutation of the HBD does not alter the growth inhibitory action of IGFBP-2. This conclusion is further supported by the fact that the two zebrafish IGFBP-2s had similar biological effects even though the HBD motif is not present in these proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003926-Pozios1">&#x0005b;27&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>In conclusion, we have shown that there are two functional IGFBP-2 genes in zebrafish and other teleosts, which likely resulted from a genome wide duplication event before the beginning of the teleost radiation. Both zebrafish <italic>igfbp-2a</italic> and <italic>-2b</italic> encode secreted proteins that bind IGFs. Gene expression and functional analysis suggest that the two fish IGFBP-2 genes have undergone subfunctionalization partitioning by evolving distinct gene expression patterns, while their protein functionality remains largely unchanged. We further show that IGFBP-2 is a conserved regulatory protein and it inhibits embryo growth and development primarily by binding to IGF and inhibiting its actions <italic>in vivo</italic>.
