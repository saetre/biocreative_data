A number of environmental and epidemiologic risk factors for developing IA have been identified. However, genetic factors that affect risk for developing IA have not been clearly identified. We report that host genetic differences influence outcome following establishment of pulmonary aspergillosis in an exogenously immune suppressed mouse model. Computational haplotype-based genetic analysis indicated that genetic variation within the biologically plausible positional candidate gene plasminogen (<italic>Plg</italic>; Gene ID 18855) correlated with murine outcome. There was a single nonsynonymous coding change (<italic>Gly110Ser</italic>) where the minor allele was found in all of the susceptible strains, but not in the resistant strains. A nonsynonymous single nucleotide polymorphism (<italic>Asp472Asn</italic>) was also identified in the human homolog (<italic>PLG</italic>; Gene ID 5340). An association study within a cohort of 236 allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) recipients revealed that alleles at this SNP significantly affected the risk of developing IA after HSCT.

While exogenous immune suppression is the greatest risk factor for infection acquisition, polymorphic variation in key immune effector genes likely contributes to disease susceptibility as well. We hypothesized that susceptibility to invasive aspergillosis was, in part, due to host genetic variation. By screening strains of inbred mice, we demonstrated differential susceptibility to invasive aspergillosis. Using the Roche Mouse single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) Database, we localized an area on murine chromosome 17 as a putative &#x0201c;quantitative trait locus&#x0201d; governing disease susceptibility. Within this interval, the gene encoding plasminogen (<italic>Plg</italic>) was found to have a coding change SNP in murine strains that were highly susceptible to disease. Many micro-organisms are recognized to hijack the plasminogen to be more prevalent in human hematopoietic stem cell transplant recipients who developed IA as compared to those who did not. Thus, we demonstrated a genetic basis for increased susceptibility to IA in both a murine model and human cohort, and implicated the fibrinolytic system in the pathogenesis of this disease.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="12"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Invasive infection with <italic>Aspergillus fumigatus</italic> (AF) is a common and life-threatening infection among severely immunocompromised individuals. Despite aggressive surveillance and prophylaxis, the incidence of invasive aspergillosis (IA) in hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) recipients remains approximately 10&#x00025;, and the three month mortality following infection approaches 30&#x00025; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000101-Herbrecht1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000101-Marr1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>. AF infection leads to a potentially hemorrhagic bronchopneumonia, with angio-invasion and tissue destruction. Several factors have been shown to affect risk for developing IA in allogeneic HSCT recipients. These include immunosuppresion required for HSCT, graft-vs-host-disease, and corticosteroid use<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000101-Marr1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>. However, despite having similar risk profiles, only a subset of at-risk individuals will develop IA. Since most of the identified risk factors for IA affect the immune system of the recipient, we hypothesize that genetic variation within key innate or adaptive immune response genes could influence susceptibility to or outcome of this invasive fungal infection.</p><p>The susceptibility of different inbred murine strains for developing IA after immunosuppression was analyzed to determine if genetic factors affect susceptibility to aspergillosis. Haplotype-based computational genetic analysis of this survival data identified <italic>PLG</italic> as a candidate susceptibility gene.

The strain-specific survival patterns were then evaluated over a 14 day period. This immunosuppressive regimen disrupts macrophage and neutrophil-mediated defense against inhaled conidia. In control experiments, no significant mortality was observed in the nine different immunosuppressed strains of mice that were not exposed to AF. However, the immunosuppressive regimen caused significant mortality in the DBA/2 strain. Therefore, subsequent analyses were performed with and without the data from this strain. Since the immunosuppressive regimen was initiated 3 days prior, all strains were rendered neutropenic at time of exposure to AF. The neutropenia extended through day 7 with neutrophil recovery by day 10 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000101.s004">Table S1</xref>). Quantitative PCR (qPCR) measurements performed on lung tissue harvested 24 hours after AF exposure indicated that the inbred strains were exposed to equivalent amounts of AF and had an equivalent pulmonary burden of <italic>A. fumigatus</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000101.s004">Table S1</xref>). Thus, the inbred strains received the same immunosuppressive regimen, experienced identical periods of neutropenia, and received the same pulmonary fungal inoculum.</p><p>Despite this, the inbred strains exhibited significant and reproducible differences in survival after exposure to AF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000101-g001">Figure 1A</xref>). The &#x0201c;susceptible&#x0201d; inbred strains (A/J and C3H/HeJ) exhibited 100&#x00025; mortality by day 6. The DBA/2J strain also experienced 100&#x00025; mortality by day 6; however the survival curves for immune suppressed unexposed DBA/2J mice were not significantly different from the mice that were exposed to AF (data not shown). The &#x0201c;intermediate&#x0201d; strains (MRL/MPJ and NZW/LacJ) also experienced 100&#x00025; mortality; however the majority of deaths in these strains occurred between days 5 and 10. Five strains exhibited a &#x0201c;resistant&#x0201d; pattern of survival: (AKR/J, C57/Bl6J, 129/SvJ, Balb/CJ, and Balb/CByJ); they had between 30&#x02013;60&#x00025; survival at the end of the 14 day observation period (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000101-g001">Figure 1B</xref>). The survival patterns were reproducible on repeated experimental trials. Histological evaluation of the lungs of moribund mice revealed <italic>Aspergillus</italic> hyphae and foci of pneumonitis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000101-g001">Figure 1C, D</xref>). Overt histologic differences between moribund mice from each strain were not noted, however histologic sections from surviving mice noted resolving pneumonia (data not shown). The amount of AF in the lung 48 hours after infection was also measured by qPCR. At 48 hours, the fungal burden in the sensitive strains (median conidial equivalents 4.7 log cells/gram lung tissue; range 3.8&#x02013;5.0) was significantly greater (p&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;0.02) than in the resistant strains (median conidial equivalents 3.7 log cells/gram lung tissue; range 2.7&#x02013;5.3) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000101.s004">Table S1</xref>). Despite having the same level of immunosuppression and initial exposure to AF, the inbred strains exhibited significant differences in fungal burden and survival after AF exposure. These findings suggest that genetic factors affect the control of fungal burden, and survival in immune suppressed mice after AF exposure. Notably, C3H/HeJ mice are known to have defective TLR-4 signalling <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000101-Poltorak1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>.

One pair was excluded due to having a second stem cell transplant and one was excluded due to missing data.</p></fn></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap><p>To perform the human genetic study, we first had to characterize the pattern of genetic variation in the human plasminogen gene. To do this, all exons and the promoter region of <italic>PLG</italic> were sequenced in 20 HSCT donor-recipient pairs (40 DNA samples from 20 stem cell donors and 20 stem cell recipients). Although 4 SNPs causing an amino acid change were identified, only one of these SNPs had a minor allele frequency above 1&#x00025;. Therefore, our analysis focused upon SNP rs4252125 (Asp472Asn), which had a minor allele frequency (Asn472) of 25&#x00025;. This non-conservative (neutral to acidic amino acid) substitution occurs in a loop region that connects the 4th and 5<sup>th</sup> kringle domains of plasminogen. This loop region can form highly variable structures based on the surrounding environment. Similar to the murine polymorphism, this amino acid change could have a significant functional impact through altering the alignment of kringle domains or ligand binding.</p><p>The genotype at Asp472Asn for the remainder of the HSCT cohort was then determined. Genotype was interpreted in a blinded manner, such that the two independent persons analyzing genotype data were unaware of each subject's status as a case or control. Analysis of these data indicated that HSCT recipients that were homozygous or heterozygous for Asn472 (AA or AG genotype) were at a significantly increased risk of developing IA after transplant. The Asn472 allele was present with greater frequency in HSCT recipients who developed IA (47/83; 56&#x00025;) as compared to those who did not (62/147; 42&#x00025;). Importantly, the genotype-specific risk for developing IA was not constant over time after transplant. Risk for development of IA following HSCT is bimodal, with peak risk periods occurring during the pre-engraftment phase (&#x0003c;day 40) and a second peak during the post-engraftment phase, during days 40&#x02013;100 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000101-Marr1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>. To allow for possible violations of the proportional hazards assumption, the genotypic hazard ratios were evaluated during 3 distinct time periods post HSCT: days 0&#x02013;40, days 40&#x02013;100 and days 100&#x02013;365. There was a constant and substantial elevation in the genotype-specific hazard ratio for IA among recipients who carried at least one &#x0201c;Asn&#x0201d; allele (AA or AG genotype) between 40&#x02013;365 days following HSCT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000101-g003">Figure 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen-1000101-t002">Table 2</xref>). Perhaps due to a low number of cases of IA occurring during days 0&#x02013;40 or to the confounding effects of known strong risk factors pre-engraftment (e.g. neutropenia), an association between <italic>PLG</italic> genotype and IA was not observed during the first 40 days after transplant. For follow-up after day 40, the recipient plasminogen genotype remained a significant risk factor for IA susceptibility (p&#x0003c;0.0005) when a multivariate analysis was used to simultaneously account for effects of other factors that were significant in univariate analysis (HLA matching status, source of stem cells, and underlying malignancy). In addition, there was an apparent gene-dosage effect: homozygous AsnAsn individuals were at a 5.6-fold increased risk of developing IA, while heterozygous individuals had a 3.0 fold increased risk, relative to AspAsp individuals. A majority (96&#x00025;) of subjects received fluconazole prophylaxis (no anti-<italic>Aspergillus</italic> activity), with the remainder receiving itraconazole, which does possess anti-<italic>Aspergillus</italic> activity (4&#x00025;). Type of prophylaxis did not differ significantly between cases and controls. Inclusion of prophylaxis in the risk model revealed that the type of prophylaxis was not predictive of acquiring invasive aspergillosis, nor did the results related to genotype change with adjustment for type of prophylaxis. Notably, donor polymorphism status was not associated with development of aspergillosis. This served as an important negative control; plasminogen is synthesized hepatically, and thus, the donor plasminogen genotype should not associate with disease acquisition.</p><fig id="pgen-1000101-g003" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pgen.1000101.g003</object-id><label>Figure 3</label><caption><title>Kaplan-Meier curve demonstrating elevated risk of developing IA in HSCT recipients with AA or AG genotype, using GG as the reference genotype.</title><p>The data represent 59 HSCT recipients who developed IA between days 40&#x02013;365 following transplantation and 135 HSCT recipients who survived &#x0003e;40 days following HSCT and did not develop IA (HR genotype AA 5.56, 95&#x00025; CI 1.88, 16.48; HR genotype AG 3.00 95&#x00025; CI 1.46, 6.14; p&#x0003c;0.0005).

Although an interaction between plasminogen and AF has not been previously described, plasminogen does bind to other fungal pathogens <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000101-Fox1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000101-Jong1">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref>. Therefore, immunofluorescence microscopy and flow cytometric analysis were used to determine if plasminogen bound to AF. Immunofluorescence microscopy demonstrated that FITC-labeled murine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000101-g005">Figure 5C, D</xref>) bound to both swollen AF conidia and hyphae in a dose dependent manner. Neither murine nor human plasminogen bound resting conidia (data not shown). The dose-dependent binding of plasminogen to AF was confirmed and further quantified by flow cytometry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000101-g005">Figure 5A</xref>). Furthermore, specificity of the interaction was tested using pre-incubation of swollen conidia with unlabeled plasminogen. This pre-incubation inhibited the binding of the labeled plasminogen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000101-g005">Figure 5A</xref>). Human plasminogen bound to swollen conidia and hyphae (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000101-g005">Figure 5B</xref>), and demonstrated similar specificity as murine plasminogen, with inhibition of binding by pre-incubation with unlabeled human plasminogen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000101-g005">Figure 5B</xref>). FITC-labeled bovine serum albumin (BSA) bound to AF conidia to a lesser degree than labeled plasminogen, and pre-incubation of AF conidia with 0.1&#x00025; BSA did not inhibit binding of labeled plasminogen (data not shown), highlighting the specificity of the plasminogen-AF interaction. These observations indicate that both infectious forms of AF can directly bind plasminogen, which supports the possibility that the plasminogen system plays an important role in the pathogenesis of IA. This also suggests a plausible mechanism by which the polymorphisms could alter susceptibility to invasive aspergillosis. A polymorphism that enhances plasminogen binding to the pathogen will increase plasminogen activation on the pathogen surface, which could facilitate pathogen entry and pathogen-induced tissue damage <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000101-Coleman1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><fig id="pgen-1000101-g004" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pgen.1000101.g004</object-id><label>Figure 4</label><caption><title>Ribbon diagrams of the combined kringle 4 (K4) and kringle 5 (K5) domains of human plasminogen.</title><p>(A) Ribbon diagram showing Asp472 and the relationship to a major lysine binding site (LBS) on kringle 4.

This association is also supported by functional in vitro studies demonstrating that plasminogen binds to AF. To our knowledge, this is the first attempt to identify genetic polymorphisms affecting risk of IA using a multi-species genetic mapping approach, with a murine model system targeting a polymorphic susceptibility gene which is then assessed in a well-defined human cohort. This approach, unlike a pure candidate gene approach, allowed evaluation of a gene that would be unlikely to be selected a priori for evaluation. While clinical applications of this finding will require further prospective evaluation, the finding can serve as a proof-of-principle paradigm for this staged approach to identifying host genetic polymorphisms that can affect outcome in immune compromised patients. Identification of a genetic polymorphism that influences infectious outcome after HSCT has important implications for pre and post transplant care, and may also have implications for the management of other immune-compromised patients. For example, genetic testing could identify high risk individuals who may benefit from use of broad-spectrum antifungal agents or enhanced monitoring for infection. While plasminogen polymorphisms are associated with development of invasive aspergillosis in HSCT recipients, it remains to be determined whether this allelic variant affects the risk of developing invasive aspergillosis after chronic corticosteroid use, semi-invasive aspergillosis or allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis.</p><p>Additionally, these findings implicate the fibrinolytic pathway as an important mediator of fungal infection. The fibrinolytic pathway is increasingly recognized in infectious disease pathogenesis, and this is the first report to link plasminogen with a filamentous fungus. Several mechanisms may explain how genetic changes affecting the function of plasminogen and the fibrinolytic system could influence host susceptibility to IA. IA is characterized by hemorrhage and tissue destruction, which are mediated by the plasminogen system. As previously demonstrated for streptococcal infection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000101-Sun1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>, AF-induced plasminogen activation could trigger plasminogen-mediated destruction of extracellular matrix components, which in turn enhances tissue invasiveness of the pathogen. Genetic differences that alter the coagulative function of plasminogen may also influence disease pathogenesis by promoting pulmonary hemorrhage and infarction. Immobilization of plasminogen on the pathogen surface allows for easier activation of this zymogen<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000101-Boyle1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>. This brings the activated enzyme into close contact with key substrates in the basement membrane, which increases the virulence of bacteria <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000101-Bower1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000101-SandersonSmith1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000101-Ge1">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref> and other fungi <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000101-Crowe1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000101-Fox1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000101-Jong1">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref>. Since AF adheres to components in the extracellular matrix and basement membrane <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000101-Bouchara1">&#x0005b;25&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000101-Tronchin1">&#x0005b;26&#x0005d;</xref>, its ability to bind plasminogen could be an important virulence mechanism. Since plasminogen plays an important role is inflammation and host defense, this provides another potential mechanism for the plasminogen system to affect the pathogenesis of IA. Plasminogen is a direct chemotaxin and is an activator of monocytes, and has recently been shown to prevent monocyte apoptosis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000101-Mitchell1">&#x0005b;27&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000101-Weide1">&#x0005b;30&#x0005d;</xref>.

Since monocytes/macrophages are critical for host defense, genetic variation in plasminogen could cause subtle differences in immune function that may also affect outcome after exposure to AF in severely immune compromised hosts.</p><p>Although death rates following infection tended to be reduced among carriers of the same genotypes that conferred increased risk, this finding may well be due to chance, as it was not statistically significant (p&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;0.07). However, puzzling the finding, if this proves statistically significant in another population, it is of profound importance since it dissociates risk from acquisition of disease from survival. Clinical outcome following development of IA hinges not only on immune recovery to limit fungal related pulmonary hemorrhage and tissue infarction, but also on control of an over-exuberant inflammatory response as the immune system recovers. Thus, some of those who develop IA despite carrying the protective AspAsp genotype may respond differently to infection than those carrying the AsnAsn genotype. An additional possibility is that carriers of the AsnAsn genotype who develop IA tend to have a more evident phenotype and consequently are either more readily diagnosed or are diagnosed at an earlier stage of disease. Thus carriers would have elevated risk of diagnosis but would present with a more clinically manageable form of IA.</p><p>Human association studies in smaller independent HSCT cohorts have implicated Toll-like receptor 1 and 6 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000101-Kesh1">&#x0005b;31&#x0005d;</xref> and IL-10 receptor <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000101-Seo1">&#x0005b;32&#x0005d;</xref> polymorphisms as risk factors for development of invasive aspergillosis, While the published human association studies target viable candidate genes based on the prior literature, they are hampered by small size (n&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;22 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000101-Kesh1">&#x0005b;31&#x0005d;</xref> and n&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;9, including 4 cases of &#x0201c;possible&#x0201d; IA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000101-Seo1">&#x0005b;32&#x0005d;</xref>).

This analysis identifies haplotype blocks in which the haplotypic strain grouping within a block correlates with the distribution of phenotypic data among the inbred strains analyzed.

Haplotype-based computational genetic analysis was used to analyze the area under the survival curve to identify genetic factors affecting survival after AF exposure among the inbred strains. The area under the survival curve (AUC) after AF exposure was analyzed for 9 inbred strains. There were several haplotype blocks that had a strong correlation with survival curve AUC with P value less than 0.01, including the block containing Plg. However, Plg remained a top biologically plausible candidate. Red blocks indicate haplotypes for the &#x0201c;resistant&#x0201d; strains (Balb/CJ, Balb/CbyJ, C57Bl/6J, AKR/J and 129/SvJ) and the &#x0201c;intermediate&#x0201d; strain NZW/LacJ, and the blue blocks indiciate &#x0201c;susceptible&#x0201d; strains (C3H/HeJ and A/J) and the &#x0201c;intermediate&#x0201d; strain MRL/MpJ.</p><p>(0.19 MB PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pgen.1000101.s002.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pgen.1000101.s003"><label>Figure S3</label><caption><p>Ribbon diagrams of (A) human (C) murine (E) murine (Gly6Ser) plasminogen kringle-1 structures.

Gly6 (and Ser6 in the mutated structure) are shown as space filling models on the ribbon diagram. Also shown are Asp55 and Asp57 (above Gly6), the key lysine binding residues in kringle-1. Corresponding electrostatic potential surfaces are shown in (B) for human K-1, (D) for murine, and (F) for murine (Gly6Ser) structures. Notably, the negativity of the electrostatic potential surface is enhanced in the variant plasminogen, thus possibly increasing the affinity of lysine binding.
