The present study investigated the effects of inhibiting or stabilizing hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-1&#x003b1; by 2-methoxyestradiol or dimethyloxaloylglycine on the progression of osteoarthritis in murine knee joints.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p>2-Methoxyestradiol was injected six times over a period of 2 weeks into the left knee joint of Balb/C mice. Joints were assessed by histochemical and immunohistochemical methods, 3 weeks and 12 weeks following the first injection. Dimethyloxaloylglycine, an inhibitor of HIF-degrading prolyl-hydroxylases, was injected into the left knee joints of STR/ORT mice once a week over the entire period of 12 weeks. Right knee joints that received a saline solution served as controls. In addition, the effects of dimethyloxaloylglycine on HIF-1 target gene expression and on collagen metabolism were analyzed <italic>in vitro</italic>.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Injection of 2-methoxyestradiol led to osteoarthritic changes in the treated knee joints of Balb/C mice. The first signs of osteophyte formation were observed in the knee joints after 3 weeks, followed by progressive destruction of the articular cartilage at 12 weeks that was not, however, accompanied by inflammatory reactions. Injection of dimethyloxaloylglycine could not prevent severe osteoarthritis that spontaneously developed in the knee joints of STR/ORT mice. In chondrocyte cultures, administration of dimethyloxaloylglycine resulted in an upregulation of Sox9 expression. Such a stimulatory effect was not observed, however, for the expression of type II collagen, which might be the indirect consequence of intracellular collagen retention observed by immunofluorescence or of increased expression of IL-1&#x003b2; and IL-6.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>Induction of osteoarthritis by 2-methoxyestradiol demonstrates the importance of HIF-1 in maintaining the integrity of hypoxic articular cartilage. Stabilization of HIF-1 by dimethyloxaloylglycine, however, was not of therapeutic value, since this nonselective prolyl-hydroxylase inhibitor also interferes with proper collagen metabolism and induces the expression of catabolic cytokines</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Introduction</title><p>Articular cartilage is a unique connective tissue that physiologically lacks blood vessels. This lack of vessels inevitably coincides with a significantly reduced oxygen level within the tissue, which requires well-adapted mechanisms to ensure survival of the resident cells. The transcription factor hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-1 represents one important element in maintaining proper cellular functions under such hypoxic conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. As for chondrocytes, HIF-1 is also of great importance by promoting the synthesis of relevant extracellular matrix components [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. This synthesis may, at least partly, be mediated by transactivation of Sox9, a key transcription factor for many cartilage-specific genes involving metabolism and chondrogenic differentiation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>].</p><p>The importance of HIF-1 for the formation and maintenance of cartilage tissue has been demonstrated in conditional knockout mice in which deletion of its oxygen-sensitive subunit HIF-1&#x003b1; severely interfered with proper skeletal development and led to massive cell death within the center of the forming cartilaginous elements [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. On the contrary, another study in mice with conditional inactivation of the von Hippel&#x02013;Lindau protein demonstrated that the resulting stabilization of HIF-1&#x003b1; by inhibiting its degradation increased the deposition of extracellular cartilage matrix in the growth plate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>].</p><p>The regulation of HIF-1 activity is complex. Under normoxic conditions, HIF-1&#x003b1; is degraded rapidly. In the presence of molecular oxygen, two prolyl residues within the oxygen-dependent degradation domain of the HIF-1&#x003b1; protein are hydroxylated by HIF-specific oxygen-dependent prolyl-hydroxylases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. This conversion allows capture by the von Hippel&#x02013;Lindau protein complex followed by ubiquitinylation and rapid degradation by the proteasome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. The synthesis of HIF-1&#x003b1; can be activated by a variety of factors, including reactive oxygen species, glucose metabolites, and a number of growth factors or cytokines involving the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase or extracellular signal-regulated kinase/mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>].</p><p>In osteoarthritic cartilage, the protein levels of HIF-1 are significantly increased and its activity correlates to the severity of degenerative cartilage changes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. According to the biological functions of HIF-1, it may be assumed that HIF-1 exerts a compensatory protective role in the disease process rather than promoting the progression of the disease.</p><p>To further prove this hypothesis, we established two animal models. The first model served to investigate whether inhibition of HIF by 2-methoxyestradiol (2ME2) promotes or initiates osteoarthritis (OA) in the murine knee joint. In contrast to conditional knockout mice, the chemical inhibition allows one to investigate the effects in adult joints in an otherwise healthy organism, and therefore seems better suited referring to studies on OA. Although the exact mechanism of HIF inhibition by 2ME2 has still to be defined, 2ME2 has been shown to reliably decrease the levels of HIF-1&#x003b1; protein in chondrocytes and a number of other cell types &#x02013; and as a consequence also decreases the expression of a number of HIF-1 target genes including phosphoglycerate kinase 1 (PGK1), vascular endothelial growth factor A, and glucose transporter type 1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>].</p><p>The second animal model was used to investigate whether stabilization of HIF-1&#x003b1; by dimethyloxaloylglycine (DMOG) prevents or delays degenerative changes in STR/ORT mice. DMOG is known to efficiently inhibit prolyl-hydroxylases that mediate the oxygen-dependent degradation of HIF [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. STR/ORT mice served as an OA model since this strain spontaneously develops degenerative changes in the knee joints [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>].</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Cell isolation and culture</title><p>Primary human chondrocytes were isolated from knee cartilage of six patients undergoing total knee replacement for OA as described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. All of the samples were obtained after the patients gave their informed consent. Our institutional ethics committee approved the study protocol.</p><p>To minimize the effect of chondrocyte dedifferentiation, only first-passage chondrocytes were used in the present study. After digestion, cells were plated at a cell density of 100,000 cells/cm<sup>2 </sup>in 24-well plates for RNA isolation or in Flexi-Perm culture chambers (Greiner Bio-One, Solingen, Germany) for immunohistochemistry.</p><p>First, the cells were cultured under normoxic conditions (21% oxygen) for 3 days in DMEM containing 10% FCS, 2 mM glutamine and 50 U/ml streptomycin/penicillin at 37&#x000b0;C. For gene expression analyses, confluent cells were subsequently treated with different concentrations of DMOG ranging from 0.1 to 1 mM or with 2ME2 in concentrations of 100 or 200 &#x003bc;M, and were cultured either under normoxic (21% oxygen) or hypoxic conditions (1% oxygen) for 24 hours before harvesting. Since 2ME2 is dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), a portion of the cells was exposed to 1% DMSO alone, which served as an additional control. For hypoxic conditions, the chondrocytes were kept in a sealed incubator (Binder GmbH, Tuttlingen, Germany), and flushed with gas mixture containing 1% oxygen, 5% carbon dioxide and balanced with 94% N<sub>2 </sub>in a humidified atmosphere. For immunohistochemistry, the cells were treated with 1 mM DMOG and were cultured under normoxic conditions for 5 days.</p></sec><sec><title>Animal experiments</title><p>The present study investigated the effect of 2ME2 on female Balb/C mice (Charles River, Sulzfeld, Germany) and the effect of DMOG on female STR/ORT mice (Harlan Winkelmann, Borchen, Germany). The animals were fed a standard laboratory diet <italic>ad libitum </italic>and were allowed to move freely in their cages at any time. For all procedures, the mice were anesthetized by inhalation with 1.5 l/min isofluran (Baxter, Unterschlei&#x000df;heim, Germany) and 1.5 l/min oxygen.</p><p>In 14-week-old Balb/C-mice (n = 32), 2ME2 (20 &#x003bc;l) at concentrations of 10 &#x003bc;M (group 1, n = 16) or 100 &#x003bc;M (group 2, n = 16) was carefully injected with a 27G needle into the knee joints through the patella tendon into the intercondylar notch region to avoid contact with the articular surface. The treatment was repeated every other day for a total of six injections during the course of the first 2 weeks of the experiment. The animals received no further treatment for the remaining 1 week or 10 weeks, respectively. A control solution (20 &#x003bc;l) was injected into the right knee joints of all Balb/C mice at the same time. Since 2ME2 was dissolved in a 1% DMSO saline solution, the control solution (0.9% NaCl) was also supplemented with 1% DMSO. Preliminary experiments <italic>in vitro </italic>excluded any toxic effects of 1% DMSO. The mice were killed either after 3 weeks (n = 8 per group) or 12 weeks (n = 8 per group) by cervical dislocation.</p><p>In 8-week-old STR/ORT mice (n = 8), 20 &#x003bc;l of a 1 mM DMOG solution were injected into the left knee joints once per week throughout the whole period of 12 weeks. DMOG was dissolved in 0.9% NaCl. As a control, 20 &#x003bc;l saline solution was injected into the right knee joints at the same time. The STR/ORT mice were sacrificed after 12 weeks.</p><p>All knee joints were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 12 hours and were decalcified in 0.5 M ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid/2% paraformaldehyde for 2 weeks.

In control joints of both mouse strains, HIF-1&#x003b1; could clearly be detected in most articular chondrocytes throughout all layers (Balb/C, Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4i</xref>; STR/ORT, data not shown). The distribution pattern of HIF-1&#x003b1;-staining correlated with the staining for hypoxic cells with the Hydroxyprobe&#x02122; method (Chemicon). There was a distinct reduction of HIF-1&#x003b1;-positive cells at 3 weeks in joints that received 2ME2 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4j</xref>). At 12 weeks, the number of HIF-positive cells recovered and was comparable with control joints (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4k</xref>).

Immunohistochemical staining for type II collagen differed from DMOG-treated joints to control joints. In the latter, type II collagen was distributed homogeneously throughout the extracellular matrix apart from some irregularities due to degenerative changes (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6a</xref>). DMOG-treated joints, however, were characterized by an intracellularly and pericellularly pronounced staining pattern for type II collagen, particularly in the superficial half of the articular cartilage layer (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6b</xref>). Similar observations were made in primary chondrocyte monolayer cultures employing immunofluorescence staining for type II collagen. As expected, nontreated chondrocytes typically secreted type II collagen to form an extracellular network (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6c</xref>). On the contrary, addition of DMOG to the cultures leads to strong intracellular signals in the form of vesicle-like structures with virtually no or drastically reduced deposition of type II collagen in the extracellular space (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6d</xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="F6"><label>Figure 6</label><caption><p>Biological effects of dimethyloxaloylglycine.

Furthermore, the influences on the expression of Col1A2 and Col2A1 genes, which encode the structural elements for type I and type II collagen fibrils, were determined. DMOG significantly increased the expression of PGK1 in a dose-dependent manner (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6e</xref>). This effect was more pronounced under normoxic conditions that are characterized by a physiologically lower activity of HIF-1. This supports the fact that the stabilization of HIF-1&#x003b1; by DMOG also increases its transactivating activity and thus secondarily increases the expression of HIF target genes. The expression of Sox9, a recently identified HIF target gene, was also stimulated in a dose-dependent manner by DMOG, both under normoxic and hypoxic culture conditions (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6f</xref>).</p><p>Different results were observed, however, for the expression of Col1A2 and Col2A1.

The highest concentration of DMOG (1 mM) even led to a measurable, although not significant, decrease in Col2A1 expression, both under normoxia and hypoxia (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6g</xref>).

The functional inhibition of HIF-1 coincided with increased apoptosis of articular chondrocytes and led to degenerative changes in murine knee joints. The study therefore supports the results of Schipani and colleagues obtained from conditional HIF-knockout mice in which cell death in the center of cartilaginous elements of the developing skeleton was observed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Further studies confirmed that its subunit, HIF-1&#x003b1;, plays an important role in chondrogenesis and joint formation &#x02013; and HIF-1&#x003b1; was recently shown to activate the promotor of SOX9, which is a key regulator of chondrocyte differentiation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>].</p><p>The naturally occurring derivate of estradiol, 2ME2, is considered a substance with anti-tumorigenic properties and is also accepted as a HIF inhibitor. Although its exact mechanism of action is not yet known, the HIF-1-inhibiting properties of 2ME2 have been suggested to be linked to a microtubule depolymerizing effect [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. 2ME2 is a substance currently investigated in clinical trials for the treatment of tumors, and its systemic application was shown to be well tolerated with no relevant negative side effects in oxygenated organs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. <italic>In vitro </italic>studies also confirm that 2ME2 in moderate concentrations has no direct toxic effects on slow-dividing nontumor cells but does lead to a reliable inhibition of HIF-1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>].</p><p>The present study has shown for the first time that repeated intraarticular administration of 2ME2 decreased the number and the intensity of HIF-1&#x003b1;-positive cells. The relevance of tissue hypoxia even in thin murine articular cartilage was demonstrated by the Hydroxyprobe&#x02122; (Chemicon) method, which detected hypoxic cells in deep and superficial layers of avascular cartilage and mensical tissue. This observation indicates the relevance of the transcription factor HIF-1 even in relatively thin murine articular cartilage. One can therefore conclude that 2ME2-exposed cells were no longer able to adapt to a hypoxic environment, resulting in impaired cell functions and cell death &#x02013; which is presumably the primary pathomechanism for the degeneration of the cartilage tissue in this model. Of course, one has to consider that the molecular mechanism of cartilage degeneration induced by 2ME2 differs to some extent from the pathogenesis of primary OA, in which apoptotic cell death is supposed to play an inferior role [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. Nevertheless, the morphological changes strikingly resembled those of osteoarthritic lesions. The lack of synovial inflammation and the absent induction of inflammatory cytokines suggest that cartilage destruction by 2ME2 does not depend on inflammatory reactions, but rather on an impact on the chondrocyte function itself.</p><p>The second objective of the present work was to investigate whether stabilization of HIF-1 could prevent the initiation or progression of murine OA in STR/ORT mice, which belong to a family of mouse strains that develop spontaneously degenerative changes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. In preceding <italic>in vitro </italic>experiments, DMOG was shown to effectively stabilize HIF-1 by inhibiting its degradation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>].</p><p>Despite the stimulatory effects on SOX9 expression <italic>in vitro</italic>, the repeated intra-articular injection of DMOG did not prevent the progression of OA in the knee joints of STR/ORT mice. Neither osteophyte formation nor the score for destruction of the articular cartilage differed between DMOG-treated joints and control joints. Degeneration of the articular cartilage and osteophyte formation were present in all knee compartments. Consistent with previous reports, cartilage degeneration was most prominent in the medial compartment. This phenomenon might be a consequence of mechanical overloading due to the varus deformity of the hind limbs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>].</p><p>The following three reasons may account for the failure of DMOG to have a beneficial effect. Firstly, endogenous HIF-1 levels may be sufficient in articular chondrocytes, and were even shown to be elevated in OA cartilage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. The data of the present study show that articular chondrocytes strictly depend on sufficient HIF-1 activity to ensure their cellular survival within the hypoxic matrix. Other studies on other cell types, however, describe a contradictory role of HIF-1&#x003b1; in modulating cell viability and apoptosis, which may depend on multitude factors including the cell type or the physico-chemical environment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. The physiological function of HIF-1&#x003b1; may therefore depend on a well-balanced activity, and surplus levels may not necessarily have further protective effects on the cells or even induce proapoptotic or other detrimental events that could not be detected by the TUNEL method used in the present study.</p><p>Secondly, DMOG represents rather a nonselective inhibitor of prolyl-hydroxylases. To our knowledge, agents that selectively inhibit the HIF-degrading prolyl-hydroxylase have not so far been established. DMOG not only inhibits the HIF prolyl-hydroxylase, but also interferes with collagen prolyl-hydroxylases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. The latter are involved in post-transcriptional processing of collagen fibers and formation of the triple helices. The hydroxylation of proline residues is essential for the formation of intramolecular hydrogen bonds and contributes to the stability of the triple-helical conformation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. The intracellular accumulation of type II collagen observed by immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence can therefore be ascribed to impaired collagen processing, which is known to interfere with proper secretion of fibrillar collagens [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. As a consequence, retention and accumulation of collagen molecules may act via a negative feedback loop on their gene expression. Downregulation of the collagen gene expression was more prominent for Col1A2 than for Col2A1. Two mechanisms may counteract specifically the expression of Col2A1. The described putative suppressive effect by intracellular collagen retention may at least partly be neutralized by a stimulatory effect via increased SOX9 expression, which is known to function as an enhancer for Col2A1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>].</p><p>Thirdly, HIF-1&#x003b1; not only mediates prochondrogenic effects (for example, by enhanced SOX9 expression), but is also involved in catabolic events. HIF-1&#x003b1; was recently shown to be essential for myeloid cell-mediated inflammation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]. Elevation of HIF-1&#x003b1; levels by DMOG increased the expression of the catabolic cytokines IL-1&#x003b2; and IL-6. IL-1&#x003b2; has recently been shown to be a HIF-1-target gene since its promotor region carries multiple HIF-1-binding sites resulting in an enhanced expression under hypoxia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]. Although moderate doses of IL-1&#x003b2; also support anabolic effects on cartilage metabolism to some degree [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>], it is well proven that this cytokine generally mediates catabolic events by canonical pathways and, therefore, may also account for the negative effect on collagen expression in the present study.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>The data from the present work underline the requirement of adequate levels of HIF-1 for the viability of chondrocytes and for the maintenance of the integrity of hypoxic articular cartilage. One has to consider, however, that surplus levels of HIF-1&#x003b1; may also exert catabolic effects &#x02013; for example, by inducing the cytokines IL-1&#x003b2; and IL-6. HIF-1&#x003b1; may thus exert a paradoxical role in cartilage. On the one hand, HIF-1&#x003b1; ensures energy supply and survival of chondrocytes exposed to a hypoxic environment. Furthermore, HIF-1&#x003b1; stimulates the expression of a number of cartilage-specific genes. On the other hand, HIF-1&#x003b1; also promotes catabolic pathways and may also trigger proapoptotic events. In view of the data of the present study and the data from the literature, HIF-1&#x003b1; may be considered an important element in balancing anabolism and catabolism as well as cellular protection and cell death in cartilage and many other tissues. In this context, the question still remains open if elevated HIF-1&#x003b1; levels in OA exert a compensatory protective role or trigger the disease process.</p><p>In view of the detrimental side effect of DMOG on collagen metabolism due to its lack of specificity, one cannot currently rule out that more specific agents might nevertheless have beneficial effects. The future development of strictly selective inhibitors of HIF-degrading prolyl-hydroxylases therefore seems worthwhile, since stabilization of HIF may be of potential therapeutic value at least for cartilage repair approaches by supporting chondrogenic differentiation (for example, via stimulating expression of SOX9).</p></sec><sec><title>Abbreviations</title><p>BSA: bovine serum albumin; Col1A2: type I collagen &#x003b1;<sub>2</sub>-chain; Col2A1: type II collagen &#x003b1;<sub>1</sub>-chain; DMEM: Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; DMOG: dimethyloxaloylglycine; DMSO: dimethyl sulfoxide; FCS: fetal calf serum; FITC: Fluorescein isothiocyanate; H&#x00026;E: hematoxylin and eosin; HIF: hypoxia-inducible factor; IL: interleukin; 2ME2: 2-methoxyestradiol; OA: osteoarthritis; PBS: phosphate-buffered saline; PCR: polymerase chain reaction; PGK1: phosphoglycerate kinase 1; RT: reverse transcription; TNF: tumor necrosis factor; TUNEL: terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP-biotin nick end labeling.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>KG carried out the study design, the acquisition of data, the analysis and interpretation of data and drafted the manuscript.
