There is increasing evidence to claim that these proteins as transporters are involved in a variety of physiological functions. These functions include the regulation of immune responses, modulation of cell growth and metabolism, transportation of iron and prostaglandin synthesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Human NGAL (neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin) and its mouse analogue lipocalin 2 (also referred to as siderocalin, Ngal, 24p3, uterocalin, or neu-related lipocalin) are members of the lipocalin family of small secreted proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. These proteins are up-regulated in a number of pathological conditions, including cancers, and may function as transporters of essential factors. Mouse lipocalin 2 was originally cloned from mouse kidney cells infected with polyoma virus-40 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Yang <italic>et al</italic>. found lipocalin 2 could bind to iron and then deliver it to the cell through a process requiring endocytosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. Subsequently, lipocalin 2 cell-surface receptor 24p3R was identified [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. Moreover, lipocalin 2 was induced by lipopolysaccharide [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>], basic fibroblast growth factor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>], tumor necrosis factor &#x003b1; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>] and retinoic acid [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. Until now, growing evidence suggests that lipocalin 2 plays an important role in innate immune response, cell apoptosis and tumor development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>].</p><p>In human, elevated levels of lipocalin 2 expression have been reported in various cancers including ovarian cancer, pancreatic cancer, lung cancer, colon cancer and breast cancer, indicating there is a strong association between lipocalin 2 and the malignance of cancer cells and that metastasis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. It was found that NGAL/lipocalin 2 was overexpressed in the progression of malignant transformation from human immortalized esophageal epithelial cell line SHEE to esophageal carcinoma cell line SHEEC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. Moderate to strong expression of NGAL/lipocalin 2 was observed in epithelial ovarian cancer cell lines SKOV3 and OVCA433 while no expression of NGAL/lipocalin 2 was evident in normal IOSE29 and mesenchyme-like OVHS1, PEO.36 and HEY cell lines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. A study of Fernandez <italic>et al</italic>. demonstrated that in MCF-7 human breast cancer cells lipocalin 2 could enhance tumor growth and metastasis by protecting matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) from degradation and increasing angiogenesis. And, the MMP-9/lipocalin 2 complexes were detected in 90% of urine samples obtained from breast cancer patients, but not in those from healthy controls [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. Besides that, cell lines derived from highly metastatic breast cancer, such as MDA-MB-231, expressed and secreted higher amounts of NGAL/lipocalin 2 than cell lines derived from benign, organ defined breast cancers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>].</p><p>Mouse lipocalin 2 is overexpressed in oncogene-mediated cell transformation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. Under normal conditions, expression of lipocalin 2 is restricted to breast [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]; however, increased lipocalin 2 levels have been reported in breast cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. Although lipocalin 2 have been demonstrated to correlate with breast cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>], the roles of lipocalin 2 in breast cancer formation and metastasis have not been clearly shown. In this study, we overexpressed lipocalin 2 in 4T1 mouse mammary tumor cells, and investigated the effects and molecular mechanisms of lipocalin 2 on breast tumor malignant properties.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Cells and cell culture</title><p>4T1 is mouse mammary tumor cell line [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>], which was kindly provided by Dr. Fred R.

Moreover, another report also indicated that lipocalin 2 was possibly involved in invasion of tumor cells by regulating activity of MMP-9 and MMP-2, but was not apparently related with division and proliferation of tumor cells in SHEEC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. These studies suggested that lipocalin 2 expression wasn't related with cancer proliferation.</p><p>The process of tumor metastasis is a multistage event involving local invasion and destruction of intercellular matrix, intravasation into blood vessels, lymphatics or other channels of transport, survival in the circulation, extravasation out of the vessels in the secondary site and growth in the new location [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. In our study, although the effects of lipocalin 2 on proliferation and anchorage-independent growth of 4T1 cells were not significant, our results from cell migration and invasion analysis indicated that cell mobility was significantly higher in the LCN2 cells than Mock cells, denoting an aggressive phenotype in tumor cells. Because increased malignant cell motility has been associated with enhanced metastatic potential in animal as well as human tumors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>], we further did an experiment <italic>in vivo</italic>. As we predicted, the results revealed that lipocalin 2 overexpression enhanced the metastasis of 4T1 cells in BALB/c mice. This enhancement suggested that lipocalin 2 might provide some advantage to the cancer cells growing in the complex cellular environment of the host tissues. Although the precise nature of this advantage remains to be determined, previous studies have argued to suggest that lipocalin 2 may modulate the interactions with immune system. For example, it has been demonstrated that lipocalin 2 synthesis is highly induced in epithelial cells in both inflammatory and neoplastic colorectal diseases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. Lipocalin 2 may also bind other lipophilic mediators of inflammatory responses and extracellular matrix-degrading proteinases, which jointly cause invasion and aggravation. Our results suggested that lipocalin 2 was a key modulator for breast cancer cells metastasis.</p><p>The previous report indicated that lipocalin 2 could diminish migration and invasion of 4T1-Ras-transformed mesenchymal tumor cell line [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. And a study by Venkatesha <italic>et al</italic>. demonstrated that lipocalin 2 could antagonize the proangiogenic action of Ras-transformed cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. These results indicated that lipocalin 2 was an epithelial inducer in Ras malignancy and a suppressor of metastasis. In contrast, our results showed that lipocalin 2 promoted lung metastasis in non-Ras-induced 4T1 cells. Therefore, the effect of lipocalin 2 on tumor metastasis depended on the tumor-type specificity. It was necessary to define the roles and molecular mechanisms of lipocalin 2 in given cancer metastasis. To gain a better understanding of these metastasis effects, the molecular mechanisms by which lipocalin 2 affected cell migration and invasion should be studied. The previous study reported that the Ras-MAPK and the PI3K/Akt pathways were critical for the maintenance of EMT (epithelial to mesenchymal transition) in 4T1-Ras cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. It also demonstrated that lipocalin 2 inhibited Ras-mediated invasion/migration by up-regulating E-cadherin through an inhibition of MAPK signaling. But our study found that overexpression of lipocalin 2 could not affect the MAPK pathway. It is generally accepted that the PI3K/Akt axis promotes tumorigenesis by increasing the survival capacity of cancer cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. However, Gu <italic>et al</italic>. demonstrated the PI3K/Akt pathway had no effect on anchorage-independent growth of 4T1 cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. Here, we also found the colony forming abilities of both Mock cells and LCN2 cells were unaffected by inhibition of the PI3K/Akt pathway, indicating this reduction of Akt activity caused by lipocalin 2 had no effect on survival of 4T1 cells. Besides that, some recently published evidence indicated that Akt could block breast cancer cell migration and invasion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. In this study, we found that the overexpression of lipocalin 2 increased migration and invasion of non-Ras-induced 4T1 cells and inhibited the PI3K/Akt pathway in non-Ras-induced 4T1 cells. Altogether, lipocalin 2 is associated with breast cancer cells migration and invasion occurred, at least partly, through the PI3K/Akt pathway, although further studies will be necessary to confirm this finding.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>This study demonstrated that lipocalin 2 overexpression could increase cell migration, invasion, and lung metastasis in 4T1 murine breast cancer cells. The molecular mechanism underlying the lipocalin 2-mediated migration and invasion was found to be inhibition of the PI3K/Akt pathway. To our knowledge, this report is the first to elucidate the involvement of lipocalin 2 and mechanisms by which it influences the malignant properties of breast cancer cells.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>HS participated in designing the study, conducted cell line transfection, immunoblotting analysis, cell and animal experiments, and drafted the manuscript.
