However, mechanisms involved in various functions of PHB are not fully explored yet. Here we report for the first time that PHB interacts with <italic>O</italic>-linked &#x003b2;-<italic>N</italic>-acetylglucosamine transferase (<italic>O</italic>-GlcNAc transferase, OGT) and is <italic>O</italic>-GlcNAc modified; and also undergoes tyrosine phosphorylation in response to insulin. Tyrosine 114 (Tyr114) and tyrosine 259 (Tyr259) in PHB are in the close proximity of potential <italic>O</italic>-GlcNAc sites serine 121 (Ser121) and threonine 258 (Thr258) respectively. Substitution of Tyr114 and Tyr259 residues in PHB with phenylalanine by site-directed mutagenesis results in reduced tyrosine phosphorylation as well as reduced <italic>O</italic>-GlcNAc modification of PHB. Surprisingly, this also resulted in enhanced tyrosine phosphorylation and activity of OGT. This is attributed to the presence of similar tyrosine motifs in PHB and OGT. Substitution of Ser121 and Thr258 with alanine and isoleucine respectively resulted in attenuation of <italic>O</italic>-GlcNAc modification and increased tyrosine phosphorylation of PHB suggesting an association between these two dynamic modifications. Sequence analysis of <italic>O</italic>-GlcNAc modified proteins having known <italic>O</italic>-GlcNAc modification site(s) or known tyrosine phosphorylation site(s) revealed a strong potential association between these two posttranslational modifications in various proteins. We speculate that <italic>O</italic>-GlcNAc modification and tyrosine phosphorylation of PHB play an important role in tyrosine kinase signaling pathways including insulin, growth factors and immune receptors signaling. In addition, we propose that <italic>O</italic>-GlcNAc modification and tyrosine phosphorylation is a novel previously unidentified binary switch which may provide new mechanistic insights into cell signaling pathways and is open for direct experimental examination.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="10"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p><underline>P</underline>ro<underline>h</underline>i<underline>b</underline>itin (PHB, also known as PHB1) and its homologue PHB2 are evolutionarily conserved proteins and have been shown to be involved in cell cycle progression, cell differentiation, gene transcription and mitochondrial functions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004586-Mishra1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>.

In co-immunoprecipitation assays, we found that both PHB and OGT co-immunoprecipitated with each other in response to insulin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004586-g001">Fig. 1A</xref>). A very weak signal was observed in the absence of insulin. This is further confirmed by <italic>in situ</italic> co-localization of PHB and OGT using confocal microscopy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004586-g001">Fig. 1B</xref>). This prompted us to examine whether PHB is subjected to modification by OGT. Cell lysates prepared from three different cell lines were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and processed for immunoblotting using monoclonal anti-<italic>O</italic>-GlcNAc antibody. Multiple <italic>O</italic>-GlcNAc modified protein bands were observed around expected &#x0223c;30 kDa PHB band. To confirm whether one of them is PHB, membranes were stripped and reprobed with anti-PHB antibody. Indeed one of the <italic>O</italic>-GlcNAc modified band exactly coincided with PHB band in overlay suggesting that PHB undergoes <italic>O</italic>-GlcNAc modification (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004586-g001">Fig. 1C</xref>). Recombinant His-PHB was also detected by anti-<italic>O</italic>-GlcNAc antibody.

Cells were transfected with wild type and PHB mutant vectors. After insulin treatment, PHB was immunoprecipitated and subsequently analyzed with gel electrophoresis and immunoblotting. An attenuation of tyrosine phosphorylation and <italic>O</italic>-GlcNAc modification was observed in Tyr114Phe and Tyr259Phe PHB mutants in comparison to wild type PHB in response to insulin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004586-g002">Fig. 2C</xref>) suggesting that Tyr114 and Tyr259 in PHB undergo phosphorylation in response to insulin and phosphorylation at these tyrosine residues facilitates <italic>O</italic>-GlcNAc modification of PHB. While substitution of Ser121 and Thr258 in PHB with alanine and isoleucine respectively resulted in reduced <italic>O</italic>-GlcNAc modification and increased tyrosine phosphorylation of PHB in response to insulin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004586-g002">Fig. 2D</xref>) suggesting that <italic>O</italic>-GlcNAc modification attenuates tyrosine phosphorylation of PHB. No difference was observed in the absence of insulin (data not shown). Surprisingly a significant up regulation of <italic>O</italic>-GlcNAc modification of some proteins in the molecular weight range of &#x0223c;50&#x02013;100 kDa was also observed in response to insulin in cells transfected with Tyr114Phe and Tyr259Phe PHB mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004586-g003">Fig. 3A</xref>). Next we sought to know whether OGT itself is <italic>O</italic>-GlcNAc modified in cells transfected with tyrosine PHB mutants. To determine this, OGT was immunoprecipitated from untreated and insulin treated cells transfected with PHB tyrosine mutants and analyzed by immunoblotting using anti-<italic>O</italic>-GlcNAc antibody. An enhanced <italic>O</italic>-GlcNAc modification of OGT was observed in cells transfected with PHB mutants in comparison to wild type PHB in response to insulin only (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004586-g003">Fig. 3B</xref>). To gain further insight into the mechanism involved, PHB sequence was analyzed with pBLAST search for any potential homology with OGT family members. Interestingly two OGT family members (UDP-<italic>N</italic>-acetyl-alpha-D-galactosamine: polypeptide <italic>N</italic>-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase 13 (Accession no. XP_515839.1) and &#x003b2;-1,4-<italic>N</italic>-acetyl-galactosaminyl transferase 2 (Accession no. XP_548187.2) were identified with significant homology with PHB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004586-g004">Fig. 4A</xref>). Although it was very tempting to jump to the conclusion that PHB may have <italic>O</italic>-GlcNAc activity, however in both proteins PHB homologous region was not in the catalytic domain of these two enzymes indicating that it is unlikely that PHB has OGT activity. We speculate that these homologous regions in PHB and OGT family members are targeted by or interact with similar set of proteins and may have regulatory functions. In addition, homologous tyrosine motifs were also found between human OGT and central part of PHB containing Tyr114 and neighboring <italic>O</italic>-GlcNAc site that is Ser121; as well as between <italic>Oryza</italic> OGT and C-terminus part of PHB containing Tyr259 and neighboring <italic>O</italic>-GlcNAc site that is Thr258 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004586-g004">Fig. 4A</xref>). Subsequently we narrowed down our search to limit it to phospho tyrosine motifs in PHB and OGT family members. Interestingly pBLAST search for phospho tyrosine motifs in PHB limited to similar motifs in OGT family members revealed that tyrosine motifs in PHB containing Tyr114 and Tyr259 are very similar to tyrosine motifs present in various members of OGT family members (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004586-g004">Fig. 4</xref>) suggesting that they may be targeted by similar tyrosine kinases and upon phosphorylation may interact with similar proteins. Recently OGT has been reported to interact with insulin receptor and insulin receptor induced tyrosine phosphorylation of OGT enhances OGT activity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004586-Whelan1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>. Therefore, we examined the tyrosine phosphorylation levels of OGT in cells co-transfected with OGT and PHB vectors in response to insulin. An increase in tyrosine phosphorylation of OGT was found with no change in OGT protein levels in cells transfected with PHB mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004586-g003">Fig. 3C</xref>). To ascertain whether increased <italic>O</italic>-GlcNAc modification of some proteins in the case of PHB mutants (Ty114Phe and Tyr259Phe) is due to increased OGT activity, <italic>in vitro O</italic>-GlcNAc assays were performed using immunoprecipitated OGT from insulin treated cells co-transfected with OGT and wild type PHB or tyrosine (Tyr114 and Tyr259) mutant-PHB.

The acetyl groups improve cell-permeability of the azido-sugars and are removed by non-specific carboxyl esterases before sugars are incorporated into biosynthetic pathway.</p><p>Prediction of potential <italic>O</italic>-GlcNAc modification sites in PHB on the basis of known <italic>O</italic>-GlcNAc sites in several other proteins (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0004586.s001">Table S1</xref>) identified Ser101 (Proline at &#x0002b;3 position), Ser121 (Proline at &#x02212;1 position) and Thr258 (Proline at &#x0002b;3 position) as potential <italic>O</italic>-GlcNAc modification sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004586-g004">Fig. 4A</xref>). Interestingly, out of four tyrosine residues present in PHB, one of them (Tyr259) is adjacent to Thr258 within <italic>O</italic>-GlcNAc motif (<sup>258</sup><bold>TY</bold>LP<sup>261</sup>) and second (Tyr114) is flanked by two other potential <italic>O</italic>-GlcNAc modification sites i.e. Ser101 (<sup>101</sup><bold>S</bold>QLP<sup>104</sup>) and Ser121 (<sup>120</sup>P<bold>S</bold>ITT<sup>124</sup>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004586-g004">Fig. 4A</xref>). <italic>O</italic>-GlcNAc modification of biotinylated peptide spanning potential <italic>O</italic>-GlcNAc modification sites by OGT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004586-g002">Fig. 2A</xref>) suggested that it could be <italic>O</italic>-GlcNAc sites <italic>in vivo</italic> too. Subsequently this is confirmed by site-directed mutagenesis and immunoblotting. Recently PHB homologue PHB2 was identified as <italic>O</italic>-GlcNAc modified protein in stress granules and it has been shown that <italic>O</italic>-GlcNAc modification is required for aggregation of untranslated mRNA into stress granules <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004586-Ohn1">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref>. Out of two <italic>O</italic>-GlcNAc modification sites we have identified in PHB, Ser121 is conserved in PHB2 and corresponding residue in PHB2 is Ser135. Interestingly neighboring tyrosine residue (Tyr114) in PHB is also conserved in PHB2 and corresponding residue in PHB2 is Tyr128. Tyr128 in PHB2 has been identified as phosphorylation site during phospho-tyrosine profiling in cancer cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004586-Rush1">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref>. It would be interesting to know whether <italic>O</italic>-GlcNAc modification in PHB2 occurs at Ser135. It is possible that <italic>O</italic>-GlcNAc modification and tyrosine phosphorylation in PHB2 interact in the same way as in PHB.</p><p>In another study, PHB has been identified as a substrate for Akt however exact phosphorylation site remains to be determined <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004586-Han1">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref>. Akt phosphorylates many proteins at serine/threonine residues that lie in Arg&#x02013;Xaa&#x02013;Arg&#x02013;Xaa&#x02013;Xaa&#x02013;Ser/Thr motifs (where Xaa is any amino acid) and this motif is crucial for the specificity of Akt <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004586-Cohen1">&#x0005b;25&#x0005d;</xref>. Analysis of PHB protein sequence reveals one potential motif <sup>254</sup>RSRNI<underline>T</underline><sup>258</sup> (R-x-R-x-x-S/T) for Akt. Interestingly Tyr259 in PHB is present at tandem position from Akt motif and Thr258 <italic>O</italic>-GlcNAc site is part of Akt consensus motif (R-x-R-x-x-S/T). This would imply that Thr258 may be subjected to <italic>O</italic>-GlcNAc modification or phosphorylation under different conditions and phosphorylation status of adjacent tyrosine residue (Tyr259) may play a regulatory role in this process.</p><p>Because PHB (as well as few other insulin signaling intermediates such as IRS, Akt, GLUT4 etc) undergoes both <italic>O</italic>-GlcNAc modification and tyrosine phosphorylation and these modification sites are either adjacent or in the close proximity to each other we hypothesize that <italic>O</italic>-GlcNAc modification and tyrosine phosphorylation may be a previously unidentified novel binary switch. This would imply that these modifications may interact and regulate each other under different conditions, provide read-out for different interacting partners, attribute multiple functions to the same protein and may play an important role in cell signaling cascades (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004586-g005">Fig. 5</xref>). Using biotinylated peptides spanning potential <italic>O</italic>-GlcNAc modification and tyrosine phosphorylation sites we showed that they indeed affect each other (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004586-g002">Fig. 2B</xref>). This is further confirmed <italic>in vivo</italic> by substituting tyrosine phosphorylation and <italic>O</italic>-GlcNAc modification sites by site-directed mutagenesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004586-g002">Fig. 2C&#x02013;D</xref>). In addition, an up regulation of <italic>O</italic>-GlcNAc modification of some proteins was observed in the absence of tyrosine phosphorylation sites in PHB in response to insulin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004586-g002">Fig. 2</xref>). Because PHB and OGT both interacts with insulin receptor, undergoes tyrosine phosphorylation and contain similar tyrosine motifs it is possible that they may be part of a protein complex which may also include kinases and phosphatases, and under such condition loss of a competitive tyrosine phosphorylation sites in PHB may affect tyrosine phosphorylation and activity of OGT. Indeed this is exactly what we found in our case and is consistent with recent report by Whelan <italic>et al</italic> (2008). However, both OGT and PHB contain similar phospho tyrosine motifs therefore recruitment and subsequent modulation by other phospho tyrosine binding (PTB) domain containing proteins cannot be ruled out and warrant further investigation.</p><fig id="pone-0004586-g005" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0004586.g005</object-id><label>Figure 5</label><caption><title><italic>O</italic>-GlcNAc modification and tyrosine phosphorylation binary switch.</title><p>Schematic diagram showing <italic>O</italic>-GlcNAc modifications at serine/threonine residues and tyrosine phosphorylation at neighboring tyrosine residues can potentially regulate each other in a binary fashion and subsequently may regulate interaction with different partners or attribute multiple functions to proteins (O - serine/threonine, Y &#x02013; tyrosine, G - <italic>O</italic>-GlcNAc, P &#x02013; phosphorylation, TK - tyrosine kinase, Pase - phosphatase, OGT - <italic>O</italic>-GlcNAc transferase, ONase - <italic>O</italic>-GlcNAcase).</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="pone.0004586.g005"/></fig><p>Using two stringent selection criteria (as discussed above) a number of proteins were identified with potential tyrosine phosphorylation sites in the proximity of known <italic>O</italic>-GlcNAc sites or <italic>vice versa</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0004586.s001">Table S1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0004586.s002">S2</xref>).
