However, regulation of <italic>WUS</italic> expression by auxin during somatic embryogenesis is poorly understood. Here, we show that expression of several regulatory genes important in zygotic embryogenesis were up-regulated during somatic embryogenesis of Arabidopsis. Interestingly, <italic>WUS</italic> expression was induced within the embryonic callus at a time when somatic embryos could not be identified morphologically or molecularly. Correct<italic>WUS</italic> expression, regulated by a defined critical level of exogenous auxin, is essential for somatic embryo induction. Furthermore, it was found that auxin gradients were established in specific regions that could then give rise to somatic embryos. The establishment of auxin gradients was correlated with the induced <italic>WUS</italic> expression. Moreover, the auxin gradients appear to activate PIN1 polar localization within the embryonic callus. Polarized PIN1 is probably responsible for the observed polar auxin transport and auxin accumulation in the SAM and somatic embryo.

Somatic embryos of carrot were induced from single cells isolated from cultured callus, and this induction requires hormones or plant growth regulators.</p><p>The most critical event in embryo development appears to be the formation of the meristem (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">Meinke, 1991</xref>). Stem cells within the meristem enable plants to grow and produce new organs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">Scheres, 2007</xref>), and their identity and proliferation are maintained in part by signals that these cells receive from the local environment. In the shoot apical meristem (SAM) of Arabidopsis, <italic>WUSCHEL</italic> (<italic>WUS</italic>) is a critical regulator, and encodes a homeodomain protein that is required for stem cell formation and maintenance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">Laux <italic>et al.</italic>, 1996</xref>). In <italic>wus</italic> mutants, plants are unable to maintain a pool of undifferentiated stem cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">Laux <italic>et al.</italic>, 1996</xref>). <italic>WUS</italic> expression is confined to a small group of cells within the central zone, referred to as the SAM organizing center or stem cell niche, which is located immediately below the apical layer of active stem cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">Mayer <italic>et al.</italic>, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">Schoof <italic>et al.</italic>, 2000</xref>). WUS activity results in signaling to the overlaying stem cells, inducing <italic>CLAVATA3</italic> (<italic>CLV3</italic>) and its secreted protein, CLV3, which is thought to act as the ligand for the CLV1/CLV2 receptor complex that limits the area of <italic>WUS</italic> expression in the underlying organizing center. The CLV3/WUS negative feedback loop ensures homeostasis of the SAM by regulating the number of stem cells present in the central zone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">Fletcher <italic>et al.</italic>, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">Brand <italic>et al.</italic>, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">Schoof <italic>et al.</italic>, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">Rojo <italic>et al.</italic>, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">Lenhard and Laux, 2003</xref>). During zygotic embryogenesis, <italic>WUS</italic> is initially expressed in the 16-cell pro-embryo, preceding meristem development within the region that gives rise to stem cells and the embryonic shoot (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">Mayer <italic>et al.</italic>, 1998</xref>).</p><p>Genetic analysis has indicated that polar auxin transport operates not only in inflorescence development but also in embryogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">Okada <italic>et al.</italic>, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">Liu <italic>et al.</italic>, 1993</xref>). Treatment of early globular to heart-shaped stage embryos of Indian mustard (<italic>Brassica juncea</italic>) with polar auxin transport inhibitors resulted in an abnormal partial fusion of cotyledons. <italic>PIN-FORMED</italic> (<italic>PIN</italic>) genes encode transmembrane proteins that are involved in auxin transport in Arabidopsis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">Wi&#x0015b;niewska <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>). PIN1, a component of auxin efflux carriers, is required for the initiation and maintenance of an auxin gradient in plant tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">Friml <italic>et al.</italic>, 2003</xref>). During early embryogenesis, it was shown that efflux-dependent auxin gradients play an important role in apical&#x02013;basal axis establishment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">Friml <italic>et al.</italic>, 2003</xref>).</p><p>The capacity for somatic embryogenesis was examined in <italic>leafy cotyledon</italic> (<italic>lec</italic>) mutants of Arabidopsis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">Gaj <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>). The <italic>lec</italic> mutants are strongly impaired in terms of their embryonic response, and <italic>LEC</italic> genes probably function downstream in auxin-induced somatic embryogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">Stone <italic>et al.</italic>, 2001</xref>). Although the zygotic embryo originates from the zygote within the embryo sac, and the somatic embryo can be derived from either a single cell or be of multi-cellular origin depending on the culture conditions, both types of embryo progress through similar developmental stages from the globular stage to the torpedo stage, and share many morphological features during this development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">Meinke, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">Zimmerman, 1993</xref>).</p><p>Stem cells must be formed within the SAM during somatic embryogenesis. The <italic>WUS</italic> gene, acting as a transcriptional regulator, is critical for the regulation of stem cell fate in plants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">Mayer <italic>et al.</italic>, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">Gallois <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>). Although hormones are required for shoot regeneration from callus, somatic embryogenesis can be induced from callus by the removal of auxins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">Zimmerman, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">Gordon <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>). Thus, in this study, we address the question of how auxin regulates <italic>WUS</italic> expression during somatic embryogenesis. We show that auxin gradients are established in specific regions of embryonic callus, and that <italic>WUS</italic> induction is correlated with these auxin gradients. Establishment of these auxin gradients appeared to initiate the polar localization of PIN1 that is responsible for re-establishment of auxin gradients during SAM and somatic embryo formation. Our results suggest that establishment of auxin gradients and the polar distribution of PIN1 are critical for regulation of <italic>WUS</italic> expression during somatic embryogenesis.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Genes associated with SAM formation and zygotic embryogenesis are expressed during somatic embryogenesis</title><p>Previously, it was shown that Arabidopsis somatic embryos were induced by auxin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">Ikeda-Iwai <italic>et al.</italic>, 2002</xref>). To establish a highly reproducible somatic embryogenesis system, we improved the culture medium for primary somatic embryo induction. Several green primary somatic embryos (PSEs) could be induced from explants cultured on medium containing 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D) and casein hydrolysate after 10 days. The PSEs were then cultured in liquid medium containing 2,4-D (embryonic callus-inducing medium, ECIM) for 14 days, and disc-like embryonic calli were formed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Figure 1a,e</xref>). To induce secondary somatic embryos (SSEs), embryonic calli were transferred to 2,4-D-free liquid medium (somatic embryo-inducing medium, SEIM) for 8 days. At 2 days after transfer to SEIM, many protuberances were produced on the edges of the embryonic callus on the inside surface, suggesting that somatic pro-embryos might be now detectable morphologically (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Figure 1b,f</xref>). By comparison with the stages of zygotic embryo development as defined by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">Meinke (1991)</xref>, it is likely that these somatic pro-embryos could be considered equivalent to the globular stage of developmental potential, although the formation of distinct cell layers was not observed in these somatic pro-embryos (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Figures 1i</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02">2f&#x02013;l</xref>). At 4 days, cotyledon primordia emerged from the tops of somatic pro-embryos, whose morphology corresponds to that of the heart-stage zygotic embryo, and an SAM formed within the somatic embryo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Figure 1c,g</xref>). At 8 days, a large number of SSEs with two distinct cotyledons, a SAM, a hypocotyl and a radicle were obtained from the embryonic callus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Figure 1d</xref>). These SSEs had the capacity to grow into adult plants when cultured on solid medium. In addition to the comparatively normal morphology of somatic embryos, a small fraction (approximately 10%) of somatic embryos showed abnormal morphology. Each callus could produce a mean of 42 &#x000b1; 10 embryos. Thus, the system of the secondary somatic embryogenesis was used for further investigations.</p><fig id="fig01" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Morphogenesis of Arabidopsis somatic embryos.

In Arabidopsis, the zygotic embryos at the globular and heart stages comprise obviously identifiable layers and regions, reflecting zygotic embryo patterns established at these stages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">Meinke, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">Weigel and J&#x000fc;rgens, 2002</xref>). The <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana MERISTEM LAYER 1</italic> (<italic>AtML1</italic>) gene is expressed in the protoderm from the 16-cell pro-embryo to the heart-stage embryo, and, later, only in the L1 layer of the SAM. This unusual pattern of expression suggests that this gene plays a regulatory role in meristem organization, perhaps by specifying the surface layer of the SAM early in zygotic embryogenesis, or later by directing the differentiation of L1-derived cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">Lu <italic>et al.</italic>, 1996</xref>). In contrast, it is likely that the protoderm can be identified in cells of the somatic embryo after the heart stage of embryo development (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02">Figure 2i,m</xref>), suggesting that the different patterns of protoderm formation between zygotic embryogenesis and somatic embryogenesis may be regulated by <italic>AtLM1</italic> expression.</p><p>The first shoot meristem marker, i.e. <italic>WUS</italic>, is initiated in only four inner cells of the 16-cell zygotic pro-embryo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">Weigel and J&#x000fc;rgens, 2002</xref>), whereas in somatic embryogenesis <italic>WUS</italic> was activated in a group of cells (more than four) after transfer of embryonic callus to SEIM, and its induction was essential for somatic embryogenesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02">Figure 2e,f</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref>). These cells containing <italic>WUS</italic> transcripts did not show any regular pattern or arrangement. Another important finding is that more <italic>WUS</italic> transcripts were detectable at 24 h than at 16 h after induction, but the somatic pro-embryo could not be identified morphologically or molecularly until later, indicating that <italic>WUS</italic> induction occurs earlier in somatic embryogenesis than in zygotic embryogenesis.</p><p>During early somatic embryogenesis, auxin is transported to an apical cell, and the newly established auxin gradient is responsible for the subsequent formation of apical embryo structures. Next an auxin gradient is established in basal cells of the globular embryo. PIN1 is involved in polar auxin transport in both the apical and basal root poles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">Friml <italic>et al.</italic>, 2003</xref>). Following <italic>WUS</italic> induction during somatic embryogenesis, auxin accumulation occurred first in apical cells of the pro-embryo and later in cotyledon primordia, and finally in the radicle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig05">Figures 5e,f</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig06">6c,d</xref>). PIN1 localization indicated polar auxin transport to apical cells of the pro-embryo and apical cells of the cotyledon primordia. The early events shared between somatic embryogenesis and zygotic embryogenesis are different in several respects, not only morphologically but also molecularly. Specific characteristics of somatic embryogenesis might be due to the origin of the somatic embryo from embryonic callus, whereas the zygotic embryo is derived from a highly differentiated and polarized single-cell zygote wholly contained within the embryo sac.</p></sec><sec><title>Established auxin gradients are correlated with induced WUS expression</title><p>The presence of auxin is required for somatic embryo induction. In carrot cell cultures, induction of somatic embryos occurred after culture with exogenous auxin and its removal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">Schiavone and Cooke, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">Zimmerman, 1993</xref>). In Arabidopsis, exogenous auxin is also a prerequisite for somatic embryo induction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">Ikeda-Iwai <italic>et al.</italic>, 2002</xref>). In addition, previous studies have shown PIN2 polarity changes in response to gravity stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">Friml <italic>et al.</italic>, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">Abas <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>), which could be considered a type of auxin removal. We hypothesize that removal of auxin from the culture medium may be a stress factor that causes polar auxin distribution in specific regions that produce somatic embryos. Following auxin removal from the culture medium, auxin gradients were established in some edge regions of embryonic callus at around 24 h, indicating that removal of auxin induced the establishment of auxin gradients in these regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig05">Figure 5a&#x02013;c</xref>). Induced <italic>WUS</italic> transcripts were first detectable in these regions in areas of low auxin levels, and around areas of higher auxin levels. In support of these results, it has been reported previously that the shoot meristem in Arabidopisis is initiated in areas of low auxin concentration during shoot regeneration from callus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">Gordon <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>). In this study, following <italic>WUS</italic> induction, auxin gradients were re-established in the SAM region and then in the cotyledon primordia, implying that establishment of auxin gradients within callus and pro-embryo tissues plays an important role in SAM formation and somatic embryo development. Additionally, the <italic>tir1</italic> mutants generated severely abnormal somatic embryo phenotypes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11b</xref>), suggesting that auxin signaling mediated by <italic>TIR1</italic> is required for somatic embryogenesis.</p></sec><sec><title>Auxin gradients are involved in PIN1 localization</title><p>The direction of auxin flow is determined by the asymmetric cellular localization of auxin efflux carriers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">Raven, 1975</xref>). In this study, the establishment of auxin gradients in embryonic callus was coincident with the marked polar distribution of PIN1, which was observed in edge regions of embryonic callus at 16 and 24 h (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig05">Figures 5a&#x02013;c</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig07">7a&#x02013;c</xref>). This is consistent with a model indicating that auxin mediates PIN localization through a positive feedback mechanism to maintain the polarized localization of PINs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">Gao <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>). Following <italic>WUS</italic> induction in areas of low auxin and around areas of high auxin, PIN1 localization was observed in a group of apical cells that are localized directly above the <italic>WUS</italic> expression domain at around 36 h (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig05">Figures 5c,d</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig07">7d,g</xref>). It is likely that auxin was transported from areas of high concentration areas to areas of low concentration, with polar transport mediated by PIN proteins. This polar auxin transport resulted in re-establishment of auxin gradients in the SAM and somatic pro-embryo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig05">Figure 5c&#x02013;e</xref>). This mechanism is supported by the fact that treatment of embryonic calli with NPA caused accumulation of higher levels of auxin in smaller localized regions of embryonic calli than in untreated calli at 24 h after induction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig05">Figures 5c</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig08">8d</xref>). Previously, it has been shown that PIN1 is required for the initiation and maintenance of auxin gradients within plant tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">Friml <italic>et al.</italic>, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">Heisler <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>). Thus, establishment of auxin gradients is a self-polarizing signal that may activate the polar localization of PINs, such as PIN1, within callus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">Gao <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>), and then the polarized PIN1 proteins cause localized auxin accumulation in the SAM and pro-embryo following <italic>WUS</italic> induction.</p><p>During shoot regeneration, the mean number of shoots in the <italic>pin1&#x02013;4</italic> mutant decreased to approximately 20% of that in wild-type (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">Gordon <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>).

Moreover, in cultured tissues containing antisense <italic>PIN1</italic> cDNA, transcription of several genes was decreased after induction compared with control tissues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref>). Experiments using the auxin transport inhibitor NPA found that its use did not result in any induction of <italic>WUS</italic> expression and somatic embryogenesis. In conclusion, PIN1 mediation of polar auxin transport is essential for formation of the stem cell organizing center, SAM formation, and somatic embryogenesis.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Experimental procedures</title><sec><title>Plant materials</title><p>Arabidopsis plants used in this study were of the Columbia ecotype.
