These proteins can be divided into four classes as typified by their <italic>Drosophila</italic> members E(Z), TRX, ASH1 and SU(VAR)3-9. Homologs of all four classes have been identified in yeast and mammals, but not in plants. A BLASTP screening of the <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> genome identified 37 genes: three <italic>E(z)</italic> homologs, five <italic>trx</italic> homologs, four <italic>ash1</italic> homologs and 15 genes similar to <italic>Su(var)3-9</italic>. Seven genes were assigned as <italic>trx</italic>-related and three as <italic>ash1</italic>-related. Only four genes have been described previously. Our classification is based on the characteristics of the SET domains, cysteine-rich regions and additional conserved domains, including a novel YGD domain. RT&#x02013;PCR analysis, cDNA cloning and matching ESTs show that at least 29 of the genes are active in diverse tissues. The high number of SET domain genes, possibly involved in epigenetic control of gene activity during plant development, can partly be&#x000a0;explained by extensive genome duplication in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>. Additionally, the lack of introns in the coding region of eight <italic>SU(VAR)3-9</italic> class genes indicates evolution of new genes by retrotransposition. The identification of putative nuclear localization signals and AT-hooks in many of the proteins supports an anticipated nuclear localization, which was demonstrated for selected proteins.</p></abstract></article-meta><notes id="N0x985e618.0x8cae220" notes-type="data_link"><p>DDBJ&#x0002f;EMBL&#x0002f;GenBank accession nos<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> To whom correspondence should be addressed.

Chromatin silencing mechanisms are involved in X chromosome inactivation, genomic imprinting, developmental control of homeotic genes, silencing of mating type loci in yeast and heterochromatin-induced gene silencing, known as position-effect variegation (PEV), in <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke577c1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke577c3">3</xref>). In addition, segregation of chromosomes during cell division and telomere and centromere function is dependent on the correct higher order chromatin structure (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke577c4">4</xref>).</p><p> An understanding of the mechanisms governing modulation of chromatin structure is emerging from the identification of genes encoding proteins forming chromatin complexes. In <italic>Drosophila</italic>, the polycomb group (<italic>PcG</italic>) of genes maintains a repressive state, while the trithorax group (<italic>trxG</italic>) of genes preserves the activity of homeotic genes in appropriate segments throughout development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke577c5">5</xref>). About 120 loci have been identified in which mutations enhance, <italic>E(var)</italic>, or suppress, <italic>Su(var)</italic>, PEV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke577c6">6</xref>).</p><p> Chromatin-modulating proteins are thought to be involved in multimeric protein&#x02013;protein interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke577c7">7</xref>) and contain characteristic amino acid motifs, e.g. a chromo domain, PHD finger or SET domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke577c5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke577c8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke577c9">9</xref>). The SET domain, a 130&#x02013;160 amino acid motif, is found in proteins that are members of PcG, trxG and SU(VAR) and was named after the genes <italic>Su(var)3-9</italic>, <italic>Enhancer of zeste</italic> &#x0005b;<italic>E(z)</italic>&#x0005d; and <italic>trithorax</italic> (<italic>trx</italic>).</p><p> Homologs of these three genes have been identified in yeast and mammals (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke577c5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke577c10">10</xref>). The first plant genes identified encoding SET domain proteins were <italic>E(Z)</italic> homologs. The <italic>CURLY LEAF</italic> (<italic>CLF</italic>) gene of the model plant <italic>Arabidopsis</italic><italic>thaliana</italic> is involved in the control of leaf and flower morphology and flowering time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke577c11">11</xref>). <italic>MEDEA</italic> (<italic>MEA</italic>), alternatively called <italic>FERTILIZATION INDEPENDENT SEED DEVELOPMENT 1</italic> (<italic>FIS1</italic>), is an inhibitor of endosperm development in the absence of fertilization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke577c12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke577c13">13</xref>) and is also implicated in imprinting of paternal genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke577c12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke577c14">14</xref>). The CLF and MEA proteins, as well as the two mouse and human homologs of E(Z) share similar amino acid compositions over the length of the proteins and are particularly similar in a cysteine-rich region and the SET domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke577c15">15</xref>). The involvement in chromatin-dependent gene regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke577c15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke577c16">16</xref>), the influences on PEV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke577c17">17</xref>) and decondensation of chromatin structure in some <italic>E(z)</italic> mutants, indicate that E(Z) class proteins play a major role in maintaining the integrity of chromosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke577c18">18</xref>).</p><p> The protein encoded by <italic>Su(var)3-9</italic> and its yeast (CLR4), human (SUV39H1) and mouse (Suv39h1) homologs, presumably have a key function in heterochromatin packaging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke577c4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke577c8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke577c19">19</xref>). The human and mouse SUVAR39 and CLR4 and the human G9a proteins have been shown to selectively transfer a methyl group to histone 3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke577c20">20</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke577c22">22</xref>). Mutations in the SET domain abolish methyltransferase activity. In addition to the SET domain, these proteins have a conserved chromo domain in the N-terminal part and a cysteine-rich region adjacent to the SET domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke577c4">4</xref>).</p><p> The <italic>Drosophila</italic> TRX protein and its human and mouse homologs (ALL-1&#x0002f;All-1, also called MLL or HRX) share high similarity in the C-terminal SET domain and in the central part of the protein, where PHD fingers and an extended PHD finger (ePHD) are found (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke577c23">23</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke577c25">25</xref>). These fingers have unique Cys-His-Cys patterns similar to zinc fingers and may be involved in protein&#x02013;protein interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke577c25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke577c26">26</xref>). Recently, two <italic>Arabidopsis</italic><italic>trx</italic> homologs, <italic>ATX1</italic> and <italic>ATX2</italic>, were identified and a new domain associated with SET in trithorax (DAST) class of proteins was described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke577c27">27</xref>). A fourth <italic>Drosophila</italic> SET domain gene, <italic>absent, small or homeotic discs 1</italic> (<italic>ash1</italic>), can also be classified as a <italic>trxG</italic> gene, and its encoded protein contains a PHD finger. This is also the case for the human homolog huASH1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke577c28">28</xref>). The SET domain of the ASH1 class proteins is not localized in the C-terminus, but rather in the middle part of the protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke577c10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke577c28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke577c29">29</xref>).</p><p> The four classes of SET domain genes are evolutionarily conserved in the animal kingdom and they play important functions in epigenetic control of gene expression and chromatin packaging. Studies of (trans)gene silencing have given a clear indication of the importance of epigenetic control of gene expression in plants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke577c30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke577c31">31</xref>). Given the presence of <italic>E(z)</italic> class genes in plants, we expected that SET domain genes of the other classes would also be present. Since the complete sequence of the <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> genome is available (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke577c32">32</xref>), we chose to take a bioinformatics approach to identify such genes. In the present paper we show that <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> has more than 30 such genes and that they can be grouped into four distinct classes, based on the characteristics of the SET domains and cysteine-rich regions of E(Z), TRX, ASH1 and SU(VAR)3-9 and other associated domains. Our characterization of the expression patterns of these genes by RT&#x02013;PCR indicates a wide, but spatially and temporally differential, distribution of their transcripts during plant development. At least 29 of the putative genes are expressed. Nuclear localization was demonstrated for selected proteins. The high number of genes and their diverse expression patterns may reflect a high complexity of epigenetic control of gene activity during plant development.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Bioinformatics tools</title><p>Database searches were performed using BLASTP and TBLASTX (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http:&#x0002f;&#x0002f;www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov&#x0002f;BLAST&#x0002f;">http:&#x0002f;&#x0002f;www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov&#x0002f;BLAST&#x0002f;</ext-link>).

In some cases, alignments indicated that exons had been overlooked in the annotations (see Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="gke577tb1">1</xref> and text below). These putative exons were added to the predicted proteins when confirmed by the alignments. Predicted exon&#x02013;intron borders were checked against sequences of cDNAs, RT&#x02013;PCR products or ESTs when available (see below and Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="gke577tb1">1</xref>).</p><p> The majority of the putative <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> SET domain proteins could easily be fitted into the alignment. However, seven putative proteins contained only parts of the 130&#x02013;160 amino acid long domain (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke577f1">1</xref>). In addition, two domains (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke577f1">1</xref>, ATXR5 and ATXR6) diverged substantially from all the others. A tree based on the alignment of 28 <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> SET domains and 12 such domains of proteins from other species was constructed by the neighbor joining method, using ClustalX (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke577f2">2</xref>). Bootstrap values &#x0003e;60&#x00025; are shown.</p><p> Three <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> proteins, MEDEA, CLF and EZA1, group together with <italic>Drosophila</italic> E(Z), its human counterpart EZH2 and <italic>C.elegans</italic> MES-2. The tree gives very good support (99.9&#x00025;) for recognition of the E(Z)-like proteins of all species included, as a distinct group. The E(Z) group of <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> encompass two genes which are already known. The <italic>MEDEA</italic> gene is involved in inhibition of endosperm development in the absence of fertilization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke577c12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke577c13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke577c14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke577c37">37</xref>). Mutations in the <italic>CLF</italic> gene result in altered leaf morphology and also homeotic alterations in flower development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke577c11">11</xref>). The last member in this group is EZA1, for which the mRNA has been cloned (AAD09108).</p><p> The tree also gives solid support (93.9&#x00025;) for the grouping of five <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> proteins in a separate class together with TRX of <italic>Drosophila</italic> and its human (HRX) and yeast (SET1) homologs (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke577f2">2</xref>). Two of the genes encoding proteins of this class were recently described as <italic>ARABIDOPSIS</italic><italic>TRITHORAX 1</italic> and <italic>2</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke577c27">27</xref>). The additional genes we have identified were therefore named <italic>ATX3</italic>, <italic>ATX4</italic> and <italic>ATX5</italic> (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="gke577tb1">1</xref> and Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke577f1">1</xref>). We could also align the SET domain of one <underline>A</underline>RABIDOPSIS <underline>T</underline>RITHORA<underline>X</underline>-<underline>R</underline>ELATED protein (ATXR7) which showed less overall similarity with the ATX proteins (see below). The SET domain of this protein is most similar to that of SET1.</p><p> Putative <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> proteins with SET domains more similar to the <italic>Drosophila</italic> ASH1 and SU(VAR)3-9 proteins were also identified (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke577f2">2</xref>). Four proteins that group most closely together with ASH1 and its yeast homolog SET2 have the SET domain placed in the central region, as do other ASH1 class proteins. The genes encoding them were consequently named <italic>ASH1</italic><italic>HOMOLOG 1</italic> to <italic>ASH1</italic><italic>HOMOLOG 4</italic> (<italic>ASHH1</italic>&#x02013;<italic>ASHH4</italic>; Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="gke577tb1">1</xref> and Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke577f1">1</xref>). A fifth protein has the SET domain at the C-terminus and was therefore named <underline>ASH</underline>1-<underline>R</underline>ELATED (ASHR3; Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke577f1">1</xref>) (For ASHR1 and ASHR2 see below).</p><p> The remaining <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> SET domains are most closely related to SU(VAR)3-9 and its human (SUV39H) and <italic>S.pombe</italic> (CLR4) homologs. We have called 10 of the encoding genes <italic>SU(VAR)3-9 HOMOLOGS</italic> (<italic>SUVH1</italic>&#x02013;<italic>SUVH10</italic>; Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="gke577tb1">1</xref> and Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke577f1">1</xref>). The SUVH proteins are clustered in the tree and have a common additional domain (see below). There are high bootstrap values for branches within this group, SUVH1, SUVH3, SUVH7 and SUVH8 (99.6&#x00025;); SUVH5 and SUVH6 (89.3&#x00025;); and SUVH2 and SUVH9 (100&#x00025;). <italic>SUVH10</italic> seems to be a copy of the <italic>SUVH</italic> class that has suffered an internal deletion that removed a part of the region encoding the SET domain.</p><p> The proteins encoded by the remaining <italic>SU(VAR)3-9-RELATED</italic> (<italic>SUVR1</italic>&#x02013;<italic>SUVR5</italic>) genes are more diverse, with a separate branch for SUVR1, SUVR2 and SUVR4. The SET domains of these three proteins are most similar to that of the human G9a protein (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke577f2">2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke577f3">3</xref>). SUVR4 seems most closely related to SUVR1 and appears to have been generated after a deletion resulting in the removal of nearly 290 amino acids, but leaving the C-terminus, including the SET domain and surrounding cysteine-rich regions, intact.</p><p> The relationship between the putative proteins with truncated or deviating SET domains and the <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> SET domain classes were analyzed separately. Six were most similar to the domain of the ATX group and the putative encoding genes were therefore called <italic>ATXR1</italic>&#x02013;<italic>ATXR6</italic> (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="gke577tb1">1</xref> and Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke577f1">1</xref>). Two proteins have a truncated domain most equal to the ASHH group and the putative genes were named <italic>ASHR1</italic> and <italic>ASHR2</italic> (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="gke577tb1">1</xref> and Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke577f1">1</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Distinct cysteine-rich domains are present in the four classes of AtSET proteins</title><p>After assignment of the identified proteins to different classes based on their SET domains, characteristics of the other parts of the proteins were investigated by comparison to the homologs of other species and searches in the conserved domain databases Smart, Pfam-A and Profile prosite.</p><p> In addition to distinct differences in the amino acid sequence of the SET domain, the four classes of proteins have other significant characteristics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke577c10">10</xref>; Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke577f3">3</xref>). Proteins of the E(Z) class have a region with 16&#x02013;18 cysteine residues spaced in a given pattern in front of the C-terminal SET domain. Proteins of the SU(VAR)3-9 class have a SET domain-associated cysteine-rich region (SAC) with seven to eight cysteines in certain positions in front of the SET domain (N-SAC) and three C-terminal cysteines in the pattern CXC(X)<sub>4</sub>C (C-SAC) after the SET domain. The C-SAC is also found in TRX class proteins, which lack a cysteine-rich region N-terminal to the SET domain. ASH1 class proteins have, in contrast to the other three classes, the SET domain centrally placed. Their SET domains are preceded by a cysteine-rich region and followed by the C-SAC pattern. The number and spacing of the cysteine residues in the N-terminal cysteine region differ from that of the E(Z) C-rich region and also from the N-SAC.</p><p> The similarities between the E(Z), MEA and CLF proteins have been recognized previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke577c11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke577c12">12</xref>). In addition to the SET domain, these proteins have a C-rich stretch and the so-called domain II in common with the E(Z) proteins of other organisms (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke577f1">1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke577f3">3</xref>). The C-rich region is also present in the protein encoded by <italic>EZA1</italic> (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke577f1">1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke577f3">3</xref>).</p><p> All the ATX proteins have a complete C-SAC motif, while the ATXR proteins lack at least one of the C-terminal cysteines (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke577f1">1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke577f3">3</xref>). All four ASHH proteins have the C-SAC motif and the cysteine-rich domain conforming to ASH1 class proteins (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke577f1">1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke577f3">3</xref>). The ASHR proteins lack the C-rich regions with the exception of the C-SAC motif of ASHR3 (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke577f1">1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke577f3">3</xref>).</p><p> A complete SAC domain is present in 10 SUVH and SUVR proteins (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke577f1">1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke577f3">3</xref>). Truncated N-SAC regions are present in SUVR3, SUVR5 and SUVH10, while SUVH2 and SUVH9 only have one C-terminal cysteine residue.</p></sec><sec><title>A novel domain called the YDG domain is present in SUVH proteins</title><p>Alignments of the N-terminal part of the SUVH proteins and the use of domain-finder programs revealed that these 10 proteins contain a conserved domain also found in non-SET proteins containing a RING finger motif (in mammals and <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>) or an HNH nuclease motif (in the bacteria <italic>Deinococcus</italic><italic>radiodurans</italic>) (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke577f4">4</xref>A). We have chosen to call the 150&#x02013;170 amino acid long region the YDG domain because of a characteristic YDG motif. Further characteristics of the domain are the conservation of up to 13 evenly spaced glycine residues and a VRV(I&#x0002f;V)RG motif (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke577f4">4</xref>A).</p></sec><sec><title>PWWP domains, PHD fingers and extended PHD fingers are found in ATX proteins</title><p>In all the ATX proteins the PWWP motif, first identified in the human protein WHSC1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke577c38">38</xref>), was found (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke577f4">4</xref>C). WHSC1 is most closely related to the ASH1 class of SET domain proteins, but we did not identify this domain in any of the <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> ASHH or ASHR proteins. The PWWP domain is present in a diverse groups of nuclear proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke577c38">38</xref>) and typically has conserved PWWP residues. The first proline residue is present in three of the five ATX proteins, but none of them contain the first of the two tryptophans. The most conserved motifs are GD&#x003a6;&#x003a6;WXK (where &#x003a6; are hydrophobic residues), WPA&#x003a6;&#x003a6;&#x003a6;D and VXFFG (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke577f4">4</xref>C).</p><p> In four of the five ATX proteins, as well as in ATXR5 and ATXR6, we identified amino acid motifs similar to the PHD finger (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke577f1">1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke577f4">4</xref>B) found in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> and mammalian TRX&#x0002f;HXR proteins and a number of other nuclear proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke577c26">26</xref>). The characteristic C<sub>4</sub>-H-C<sub>3</sub> pattern is present once or twice in the <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> proteins. In the ATX proteins the PHD fingers are situated about midway between the PWWP motif and the SET domain.</p><p> Finally, the ePHD motif (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke577c25">25</xref>) was found in all the ATX proteins, positioned just after the PHD finger (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke577f4">4</xref>D). The second half of this motif resembles a PHD finger (compare conserved cysteine and histidine residues).</p><p> The DAST motif recently identified in ATX1, ATX2, TRX and HRX (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke577c27">27</xref>) was not found in the other ATX proteins.</p></sec><sec><title>Putative nuclear localization signals and AT-hooks are found in many AtSET proteins</title><p>The domain-finder programs recognized putative bipartite nuclear localization signals (NLSs; see Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke577f1">1</xref>) in MEA and CLF, but not in EZA1. Among the ATX and ATXR proteins one or two such NLSs were identified in all proteins but four (ATX1, ATX4, ATXR2 and ATXR4). This signal was also found in three proteins of the ASH groups (ASHH2, ASHH4 and ASHR3) and three proteins in the SUV groups (SUVH6, SUVH4 and SUVR1). We cannot exclude the possibility that other types of NLSs are present in the other proteins.</p><p> Putative AT-hooks, which mediate protein binding to the minor groove of AT-rich tracts in DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke577c39">39</xref>), were identified in three of the SUVH proteins, in ASHH1 and in ATXR7 (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke577f1">1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke577f4">4</xref>E). This motif has a characteristic GRP core.</p></sec><sec><title>Pairs of <italic>AtSET</italic> genes are found in large genomic duplications</title><p>The chromosomal positions of the 37 putative genes encoding SET domains are spread over all five <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> chromosomes (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="gke577tb1">1</xref>). The MIPS Interactive Redundancy Viewer was used to investigate whether any of these genes were positioned in duplicated regions of the genome. Five likely gene pairs were found: <italic>MEA</italic> and <italic>EZA1</italic> seem to be part of a large duplication between chromosomes I and IV; <italic>ATX1</italic> and <italic>ATX2</italic> belong to a duplication between chromosomes I and II; <italic>ATX4</italic> and <italic>ATX5</italic> are found in a duplication on chromosomes IV and V; <italic>ASHH3</italic> and <italic>ASHH4</italic> are found in a duplication on chromosomes II and III; and <italic>SUVH3</italic> and <italic>SUVH7</italic> are found in a duplication on different regions on chromosome I (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="gke577tb1">1</xref>). In addition, <italic>SUVR1</italic> is in an area on chromosome I that shares duplicated regions with the area on chromosome V where <italic>SUVR2</italic> is positioned.</p><p> In all cases, members of gene pairs belonged to the same class of SET domain genes. The encoded proteins were compared pair-wise and could be aligned along their total lengths (data not shown). The positions of annotated exons and introns in gene pairs were also very similar. Twelve introns of 16 were in identical positions in <italic>MEA</italic>&#x0002f;<italic>EZA1</italic>, 20 of 23 in <italic>ATX1</italic>&#x0002f;<italic>ATX2</italic>, all 20 introns in <italic>ATX4</italic>&#x0002f;<italic>ATX5</italic> and eight of the 11 and 10 introns in <italic>ASHH3</italic> and <italic>ASHH4</italic>, respectively.</p></sec><sec><title>The majority of SUVH group ORFs are intronless</title><p>The number of annotated introns in all the <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> proteins and their positions in the SET domain were compared. In the majority, numerous introns are present and up to five were found within the SET domain (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="gke577tb1">1</xref>). In the <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> E(Z) class genes the positions of these introns are conserved. However, intron positions differ from those in the E(Z) proteins of other species (data not shown). For the other classes, identical intron positions are only found between closely related pairs of genes (cf. above).</p><p> In contrast to the majority of genes, <italic>ATXR1</italic> and <italic>SUVR3</italic> contain one intron only, which for <italic>SUVR3</italic> is found in the SET domain-encoded region. Among the 10 <italic>SUVH</italic> genes all but <italic>SUVH4</italic> have intronless ORFs (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="gke577tb1">1</xref>). In contrast, the <italic>SUVH4</italic> gene contains 13 introns.</p></sec><sec><title>The <italic>AtSET</italic> genes are active</title><p>For each of the putative <italic>AtSET</italic> genes different databases were examined for the presence of matching ESTs and cDNA sequences (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="gke577tb1">1</xref>). As mentioned above, the cDNAs from the genes in the <italic>E(z)</italic> class and recently also two <italic>ATX</italic> genes have been cloned by others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke577c11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke577c12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke577c27">27</xref>). RT&#x02013;PCR and cDNA cloning were used to verify expression of additional <italic>AtSET</italic> genes. cDNAs for <italic>SUVH1</italic> and <italic>SUVH5</italic> (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke577f5">5</xref>A), and <italic>SUVH7</italic> and <italic>SUVH9</italic> (not shown) confirmed these genes as being intronless and showed that an annotated intron in the genomic region corresponding to <italic>SUVH7</italic> (F2H15.1) is not spliced out. This results in an ORF encoding a protein containing the C-SAC motif but is shorter (693 amino acids) than the annotated gene (954 amino acids).</p><p> For <italic>SUVH2</italic>, 5&#x02032;-RACE and RT&#x02013;PCR showed no intron in the leader sequence and the putative ORF, but an intron of 83 bp in the trailer of the transcript (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke577f5">5</xref>A). <italic>SUVH3</italic> has matching ESTs (AA728521, AI998299 and T04123) which together with RT&#x02013;PCR could be extended to an almost complete cDNA containing the expected intronless ORF. However, in the leader sequence of the <italic>SUVH3</italic> gene there are two introns of 464 and of 111 bp (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke577f5">5</xref>A).</p><p> The <italic>SUVH4</italic> transcript, identified from two &#x003bb;ZAP cDNA clones and by RT&#x02013;PCR, consists of 2.1 kb and sequencing confirmed the presence of 13 introns (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke577f5">5</xref>A). Expression of <italic>SUVH1</italic>, <italic>SUVH2</italic>, <italic>SUVH3</italic>, <italic>SUVH5</italic> and <italic>SUVH6</italic> is supported by the presence of matching ESTs in the databases generated from rosette leaves, roots and&#x0002f;or developing seeds (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="gke577tb2">2</xref>). Expression of five <italic>SUVH</italic> genes was detected by RT&#x02013;PCR in seeds, roots, leaves, stems, flowers and&#x0002f;or siliques (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke577f5">5</xref>A and Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="gke577tb2">2</xref>). Only <italic>SUVH1</italic> seems to be expressed in roots. We did not succeed in RT&#x02013;PCR amplification of <italic>SUVH8</italic> and <italic>SUVH10</italic> in any tissues tested. Analysis of the DNA sequence upstream of the annotated <italic>SUVH10</italic> gene indicates that this is a gene that has been inactivated by mutations. The database protein sequence of SUVH10 (T6P5.10) starts just inside the YDG domain (see Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke577f4">4</xref>A). However, this domain would be completely contained in SUVH10 if 1 nt was inserted 33 nt before the start codon. This would lengthen the putative ORF of about 279 nt (including a full YDG domain).</p><p> Primers designed to investigate whether <italic>SUVR1</italic>, <italic>SUVR2</italic>, <italic>SUVR3</italic> and <italic>SUV4</italic> were expressed, successfully amplified RT&#x02013;PCR products that were shorter than their genomic counterparts due to the presence of introns (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke577f5">5</xref>B). Expression of <italic>SUVR3</italic> is further confirmed by corresponding ESTs. An additional intron in the C-terminal part of the <italic>SUVR2</italic> gene changes the amino acids between the C-SAC and the stop codon, as compared to the annotated protein sequence (MRH10.10). Sequence analysis of <italic>SUVR4</italic> revealed the omission of an exon in the C-terminal region of the annotated protein (T27C4.2). This exon contains the C-SAC motif and renders the protein 477 amino acids long, not 424 as annotated. Two sets of <italic>SUVR5</italic> primers were designed, but none of these produced any RT&#x02013;PCR product. This putative gene is annotated either as one large gene (see Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke577f1">1</xref>) or three separate genes of which one contains only the SET domain (see Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="gke577tb1">1</xref>).</p><p> In the ATX group, ESTs matching four genes have been cloned from developing seeds and aerial organs (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="gke577tb2">2</xref>). EST sequences are also found which correspond to the four <italic>ATXR</italic> genes with truncated SET domains (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="gke577tb1">1</xref>). These are from inflorescences and aerial organs (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="gke577tb2">2</xref>). Expression of the <italic>ATX1</italic>, <italic>ATX2</italic>, <italic>ATX3</italic>, <italic>ATX4</italic>, <italic>ATX5</italic> and <italic>ATXR7</italic> genes was confirmed by amplification of their central parts by RT&#x02013;PCR using mRNA from different organs (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke577f5">5</xref>B and Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="gke577tb2">2</xref>). Our RT&#x02013;PCR products and RACE verified that the annotations of ATX1 and ATX2 are not in agreement with the cDNA sequences, as noted recently (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke577c27">27</xref>). In the EMBL database, the region encoding the <italic>ATX1</italic> transcript is annotated as three separate genes (T9H9.15, T9H9.16 and T9H9.17). The <italic>ATX2</italic> gene (T20M3.10) is annotated with two additional exons at the C-terminus, resulting in an amino acid extension after the C-SAC which would not agree with the notion that TRX class proteins have the C-SAC at their C-terminus. For ATX3, sequence analyses revealed the presence of a GWG motif at the beginning of the SET domain, seven additional amino acids in the ePHD domain and an exon encoding 25 amino acids in the SET domain, in contrast to the annotated protein (F15G16.130). Two exons missing in <italic>ATX4</italic> were revealed by comparison to the matching EST AV524242. The annotated ATX4 protein (T13J8.20) terminates just after the NHSC motif in the SET domain. The additional two exons (T13J8.30) extend the C-terminal end of the protein so as to give a complete SET domain and C-SAC.</p><p> ESTs matching <italic>ASHH1</italic>, <italic>ASHH2</italic> and <italic>ASHH3</italic> have been found in developing seeds (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="gke577tb2">2</xref>).

We have used RT&#x02013;PCR to gain a first overview of the expression patterns of the novel SET domain genes analyzed. This method does not allow a quantitative comparison of expression levels between tissues, but demonstrates that each of the 20 active genes tested is expressed in more than one tissue, that all are expressed in floral buds and the majority in flowers and seeds (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke577f5">5</xref> and Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="gke577tb2">2</xref>). For only a few genes were RT&#x02013;PCR products generated from roots. A confirmation of this general expression pattern is that the matching ESTs were derived from cDNA libraries made from inflorescences, developing seeds and aerial organs (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="gke577tb2">2</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>The AtSET proteins can be assigned to evolutionarily conserved classes</title><p>We have investigated the relationship between the AtSET proteins and their homologs in other organisms. The tree based on alignment of SET domains (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke577f2">2</xref>) indicates that these genes fall into the four classes which were previously recognized in <italic>Drosophila</italic>. In <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> we found three <italic>E(z) </italic>class genes, five <italic>trx</italic> homologs, four <italic>ash1</italic> homologs and 15 genes similar to <italic>Su(var)3-9</italic>. In addition, seven genes have been assigned as <italic>trx</italic>-related and three as <italic>ash1</italic>-related (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke577f1">1</xref>).</p><p> The significant similarity between the SET domain proteins of <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> and their counterparts in other organisms is evident not only from the SET domains but also from the upstream cysteine-rich regions in the E(Z), ASH1 and SU(VAR) classes (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke577f3">3</xref>). The C-SAC is found downstream of the SET domain in all ATX, ASHH, SUVH and SUVR proteins, as in their animal and yeast counterparts, with the exceptions of SUVH2 and SUVH9 (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke577f2">2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke577f3">3</xref>).</p><p> The classification is further substantiated by the internal class similarities in the N-terminal parts of the <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> proteins, notably the common domain II in the E(Z) proteins, the PHD fingers and PWWP and ePHD motifs in the ATX proteins, and the YGD domain in the SUVH proteins, (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke577f2">2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke577f4">4</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Two different mechanisms may have contributed to the high number of SET domain genes in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic></title><p>Analyses of sequenced genomes have shown that <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> in general has more gene families with many members compared to other organisms. In <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, 37.4&#x00025; of the gene families have more than five members (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke577c32">32</xref>). It is assumed that <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> had a tetraploid ancestor and that segments have been lost gradually, resulting in the present day genome where duplicated regions encompass 60&#x00025; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke577c32">32</xref>).</p><p> We found five pairs of SET domain genes localized in five different large genomic duplications (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="gke577tb1">1</xref>). The members of the duplicated pairs are highly similar along their whole lengths and the majority of the introns and their positions are conserved. The members of the two ATX pairs and the ASHH pair group closely together when aligning SET domains of all the AtSET proteins (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke577f2">2</xref>). Although <italic>EZA1</italic> and <italic>MEA</italic> reside in duplicated regions, judged from amino acid similarity EZA1 is more closely related to CLF than to MEA. Therefore, <italic>CLF</italic> is likely to be a more recent duplication of <italic>EZA1</italic>. Likewise, <italic>SUVH3</italic> and <italic>SUVH7</italic> may represent a pair of a large duplication from which new genes have been generated, since SUVH3 seems more closely related to SUVH1 and SUVH7 is more closely related to SUVH8 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke577f2">2</xref>). It is remarkable that the significant nucleotide sequence similarity between <italic>SUVH7</italic> and <italic>SUVH8</italic> continues upstream and downstream of the coding regions of both ORFs. This homology also exceeds the 23 nt long poly(A) stretch which is found 73 bp downstream of the stop codon of the <italic>SUVH8</italic> ORF. The hypothesis that <italic>SUVR1</italic> and <italic>SUVR2</italic> have arisen from a duplication event is likewise substantiated by the presence of highly similar ORFs upstream of both genes. The multiplicity of <italic>AtSET</italic> genes is not necessarily surprising, since gene duplications occur at a relatively high rate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke577c40">40</xref>), especially in angiosperms (see for instance <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke577c41">41</xref>).</p><p> The majority of the <italic>AtSET</italic> genes contain a large number of introns, both in the SET domain itself and the rest of the gene (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="gke577tb1">1</xref>). In sharp contrast, all the <italic>SUVH</italic> genes are intronless in their coding regions, except for <italic>SUVH4</italic>. This suggests at least one retrotransposition event of an <italic>SUVH4</italic>-like gene transcript during evolution of the <italic>SUVH</italic> gene group. A promoter must accidentally have been recruited or evolved 5&#x02032; of this retrotransposition(s). Interestingly, introns are found in the transcribed but non-coding regions of the <italic>SUVH2</italic> and <italic>SUVH3</italic> genes, as is evident from the different sizes of the RT&#x02013;PCR and genomic fragments generated by the same primers (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke577f5">5</xref>A). The intron-containing UTRs of <italic>SUVH2</italic> and <italic>SUVH3</italic> may stem from the insertion point rather that from the reverse transcribed mRNA. Another possibility could be that these introns have evolved or have been inserted after generation of the new genes.</p><p> In mammals many cases of intronless processed genes have been reported, including the human splicing factor gene Srp46 (which was generated by retrotranspositon from the PR264&#x0002f;SC35 splicing factor gene; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke577c42">42</xref>), several genes encoding proteins with RING and C (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke577c3">3</xref>) zinc finger motifs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke577c43">43</xref>), the gene for the testes-specific poly(A) polymerase mPAPT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke577c44">44</xref>), the HMGN4 protein encoding gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke577c45">45</xref>), two 1-Cys peroxiredoxin encoding genes of mouse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke577c46">46</xref>), the mouse <italic>U2af1-rs1</italic> gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke577c47">47</xref>) and the genes for the RBM12 and &#x003b1;CP-1 RNA-binding proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke577c48">48</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke577c49">49</xref>). The human &#x003b1;<italic>CP-1</italic> gene was generated by retrotransposition of a fully processed &#x003b1;<italic>CP-2</italic> mRNA before mammalian radiation. Stringent structural conservation and ubiquitous tissue expression of &#x003b1;<italic>CP-1</italic> indicates its rapid recruitment to a distinct cellular function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke577c49">49</xref>). Retrotransposition has also been reported for glycerol kinase-related genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke577c50">50</xref>). The human glycerol kinase gene family consists of an X-linked locus and several X-linked and autosomal intronless genes. The intronless genes comprise both functional genes and pseudogenes. Similarly, the mammalian CDYL gene transcript has been reverse transcribed and inserted into the simian Y chromosome, resulting, after amplification, in the two testis-specifically expressed CDY1 and CDY2 genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke577c51">51</xref>). It could also be shown that some of the expressed 5S rRNA genes in the mouse and rat were derived from retrotransposition of 5S rRNA transcripts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke577c52">52</xref>).</p><p> All these examples demonstrate that functional processed genes can occasionally be generated from retrotransposed fully processed mRNA transcripts and that these processed genes can take on a non-redundant essential functional role. The indications of genomic duplications of <italic>SUVH</italic> genes discussed above suggest a similar route of evolution: for these genes one or a few retrotransposition events were followed by conventional duplication. Comparison of gene number and order in related species, e.g. <italic>Brassica napus</italic>, may reveal how and when the <italic>SUVH</italic> genes evolved.</p></sec><sec><title>AtSET proteins can be found in the nucleus</title><p>SET domain proteins of other species have a nuclear localization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke577c4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke577c10">10</xref>). The human homolog to ASH1, huASH1, has in addition been localized to tight junctions between cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke577c28">28</xref>). The amino acid sequences of the AtSET proteins give some indications of nuclear localization. First, sequences with significant similarity to bipartite NLSs were found in 16 putative proteins (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke577f1">1</xref>). Secondly, AT-hooks, which promote protein binding to the minor groove of AT-rich tracts of DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke577c53">53</xref>), were found in five proteins.</p><p> Using protein&#x02013;marker fusion constructs, we have investigated the localization of one protein (CLF) with three putative NLSs, two (SUVH1 and SUVH2) without recognizable bipartite NLSs and one with an AT-hook (SUVH3). For all four proteins, as well as <italic>Drosophila</italic> SU(VAR)3-9, nuclear localization was demonstrated (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke577f6">6</xref>). Clearly, the absence of a bipartite NLS, as recognized by the protein domain databases, is not a strong prediction for non-nuclear localization. In addition to bipartite NLSs, single and multiple continuous as well as double and multiple bipartite NLSs have been recognized in plants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke577c54">54</xref>).</p><p><italic> E(z)</italic> is required continuously through development in order to maintain homeotic gene repression in <italic>Drosophila</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke577c55">55</xref>). MEA is suggested to be involved in the repression of one or more seed development genes and in maintenance of the repressed state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke577c13">13</xref>). Similarly, the <italic>CLF</italic> gene is required to repress expression of <italic>AGAMOUS</italic> in hypocotyls, cotyledons, leaves and inflorescence stems and petals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke577c11">11</xref>). The demonstrated nuclear localization of CLF would be a prerequisite for direct involvement in repression of gene expression.</p></sec><sec><title>Domains in ATX and ASHH proteins are possibly involved in protein&#x02013;protein interactions</title><p>The <italic>trx</italic> and <italic>ash1</italic> genes of <italic>Drosophila</italic> are involved in the transcriptional memory mechanisms that maintain homeotic gene activity in appropriate segments throughout development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke577c5">5</xref>). The ATX proteins share a PHD finger and the ePHD with TRX and HRX. However, in the latter proteins the ePHD motif is separated from the classical PHD fingers. The position of the ePHD adjacent to a PHD finger is more similar to the situation in the HRX partner genes AF10, AF17 and CBP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke577c25">25</xref>). The amino acid sequences of their ePHDs have extensive similarity to those of the ATX proteins. The ePHD of AF10 has the ability to mediate oligomerization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke577c25">25</xref>).</p><p> The SET domains of TRX and ASH1 have been shown to self-associate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke577c56">56</xref>). In both cases mutation of the GXG residues (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke577f3">3</xref>, positions 149&#x02013;151) to VXV resulted in abolition of self-association. The two G residues are conserved in all ASHH proteins. The second of these G residues is conserved in all ATX but ATX3, while the first is not conserved in ATX3 and ATX5, nor in SET1 of yeast, which is known to not self-associate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke577c56">56</xref>). The conserved arginine in the R&#x003a6;INHSC motif (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke577f3">3</xref>, positions 229&#x02013;235) is replaced by a histidine in ATX1 and ATX2. Other positions necessary for self-association are all conserved in the ATX and ASHH1 homologs (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke577f3">3</xref>). In TRX these amino acids are also needed for interaction with SNR1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke577c56">56</xref>), a constituent of the SWI&#x02013;SNF complex, which acts to remodel chromatin and thereby activate transcription. The conservation of these amino acids indicates the capability of the <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> proteins for similar interactions. The SNR1 interaction of TRX is not shared with ASH1, E(Z) and SU(VAR)3-9 class proteins.</p></sec><sec><title>The SUVH and SUVR SET domains are similar to such domains conferring histone 3 methyltransferase activity</title><p>The SET domain of yeast CLR4, the mammalian SU(VAR)3-9 homologs and human G9a protein have H3-specific histone methyltransferase (HMTase) activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke577c20">20</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke577c22">22</xref>). Such activity has not been demonstrated for E(Z) and TRX, which lack the C-SAC and N-SAC domain, respectively. There are marked differences between the conserved sequences of the SET domains of the four classes (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke577f3">3</xref>, positions 198&#x02013;337). Mutational analyses of the mammalian SU(VAR)3-9 homolog proteins demonstrated that the H&#x003a6;&#x003a6;NHSC (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke577f3">3</xref>, positions 229&#x02013;235) and GEELTFDY (positions 269&#x02013;276) motifs were crucial for HMTase activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke577c20">20</xref>). The cysteine residue in the NHSC motif is not conserved in the E(Z) class proteins (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke577f3">3</xref>). In this respect, two of the SUVH proteins (SUVH2 and SUVH9) also deviate. Furthermore, these two proteins lack two of three cysteines in the C-SAC, in contrast to the other SUVH and SUVR proteins. While mutation of H233 or C235 abolished HMTase activity, the activity increased when H229 was changed to arginine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke577c20">20</xref>). Interestingly, all the <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> SUVH and SUVR proteins have an arginine in this position.</p><p> While the amino acid sequences of the SET domain and the SAC regions of the SUVH and SUVR proteins are similar to proteins with H3-specific HMTase activity, the <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> proteins lack an N-terminal chromo domain present in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> and mammalian homologs. In other organisms the YDG motif present in all the SUVH proteins is found in proteins in combination with different domains connected with an irreversible enzymatic activity &#x0005b;SET domain, histone methylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke577c20">20</xref>); RING domain, ubiquitination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke577c57">57</xref>); HNH domain, non-specific endonuclease reaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke577c58">58</xref>)&#x0005d;. Thus, the YDG domain may be a target binding domain of functional similarity to the chromo domain (specific binding on methylated histone H3; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke577c59">59</xref>) or the bromo domain (specific binding on acetylated histone H4; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke577c60">60</xref>), which are alternatively found in SET domain or RING finger proteins, respectively.</p><p> In <italic>Drosophila</italic>, SU(VAR)3-9 is involved in the establishment of heterochromatin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke577c8">8</xref>). About one third of the genome of the fruit fly is heterochromatin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke577c61">61</xref>). In contrast, the <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> genome has only heterochromatic regions around the centromeres and two chromomeres, which are prerequisites for chromosome condensation on chromosomes 4 and 5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke577c32">32</xref>). In mammals, the SU(VAR) homologs are associated with the constitutive heterochromatin of the centromeres and play a role in chromosome segregation and mitotic progression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke577c62">62</xref>). The YDG domain and the presence of AT-hooks in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> SUVH proteins suggest that these proteins are not necessarily associated with heterochomatin.</p></sec><sec><title>What are the biological functions of AtSET proteins?</title><p>SET domain proteins have been implicated in developmental processes in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, mammals and <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>. It is therefore reasonable to postulate that many of the newly discovered SET domain proteins in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> also serve functions in development. The high numbers of such proteins in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, compared to other organisms, seems to be a result of extensive duplications in the genome and occasional retrotransposition events. The high numbers may also reflect the differences between animal and plant development: during a plants life, meristems go through transitions to allow inflorescences to develop and, thereafter, flowers with reproductive organs to form. In animals, however, cells giving rise to somatic and reproductive organs segregate early in development. It is interesting to note that our expression analysis showed that all tested genes were expressed in buds and the majority in flowers and seeds, organs where important developmental processes take place. One possibility is that the AtSET proteins have different functions in the same cells. Alternatively, the different paralogs are committed to related functions in different cells and tissues.</p><p> We suggest that epigenetic control of gene programs is needed to maintain meristem and organ identity during the different stages of plant development and to aid developmental transitions in response to genetic programs and environmental influences. The four classes of SET domain genes may play crucial roles in such control.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="display-objects"><title>Figures and Tables</title><fig id="gke577f1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p> Structure of <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> SET domain proteins.
