Focusing on the fifth variable region (V5; nt 2065-2244) of the 28S rRNA gene, we find that sequence differences between rRNA genes of a single individual are characterized by differences in number of repeats of simple sequences at four specific sites. These data support and extend previous findings which show similar V5 sequence variation in rRNA genes from a group of individuals. We performed experiments to determine if there is differential gene expression within the rRNA multigene family. From the analysis of data of six variant V5 probes protected from RNase digestion by rRNAs isolated from different tissues of the individual, we conclude that each variant rRNA is present in a similar proportion in these tissues, whereas the actual contributions of variants differ, their relative proportion is maintained from tissue to tissue in an individual. We favor the explanation of a gene dosage effect over that of a regulated gene effect to account for this pattern of rRNA gene expression. In addition, computer generated secondary structure models of each V5 clone structure predict the same three helix structure with the regions of sequence variation contained in one stem-loop structure.</p></abstract></article-meta></front></article>
