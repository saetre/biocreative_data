Although Id2 is well known to prevent differentiation and promote cell-cycle progression and tumorigenesis, the molecular events that regulate Id2 activity remain to be investigated. Here, we identified that Four-and-a-half LIM-only protein 2 (FHL2) is a novel functional repressor of Id2. Moreover, we demonstrated that FHL2 can directly interact with all members of the Id family (Id1&#x02013;4) via an N-terminal loop&#x02013;helix structure conserved in Id proteins. FHL2 antagonizes the inhibitory effect of Id proteins on basic helix&#x02013;loop&#x02013;helix protein E47-mediated transcription, which was abrogated by the deletion mutation of Ids that disrupted their interaction with FHL2. We also showed a competitive nature between FHL2 and E47 for binding Id2, whereby FHL2 prevents the formation of the Id2&#x02013;E47 heterodimer, thus releasing E47 to DNA and restoring its transcriptional activity. FHL2 expression was remarkably up-regulated during retinoic acid-induced differentiation of neuroblastoma cells, during which the expression of Id2 was opposite to that. Ectopic FHL2 expression in neuroblastoma cells markedly reduces the transcriptional and cell-cycle promoting functions of Id2. Altogether, these results indicate that FHL2 is an important repressor of the oncogenic activity of Id2 in neuroblastoma cells.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Inhibitor of differentiation (Id) proteins are key regulators in a wide range of developmental and cellular processes by regulating transcriptional networks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>). Id proteins themselves do not bind to DNA because of lack of a DNA-binding domain, but they preferentially bind to ubiquitously expressed basic helix&#x02013;loop&#x02013;helix (bHLH) factor E proteins (E47, E2&#x02013;2 and HEB) and sequester them from tissue-specific bHLH proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>). The E transcription factor engaged by Id proteins is no longer able to bind to an E-box DNA target sequence and activate transcription. The factors affecting the balance of the Id/bHLH activity are expected to be critical to the whole cellular equilibrium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5 B6 B7">5&#x02013;7</xref>).</p><p>So far, four individual Id genes, Id1&#x02013;4, have been identified in mammals. All members of the Id protein family share a similar structure consisting of a highly conserved HLH domain. Among them, Id2 has been extensively studied in several cell types and in animal models and found to be not only an inhibitor of differentiation but also a positive regulator of cell proliferation and oncogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>). Aberrant elevation of Id2, typically activated by oncoproteins such as Myc and Ews&#x02013;Fli1, was frequently observed in tumors from the central and peripheral nervous system (9&#x02013;12). The aberrant accumulation of Id2 contributes to uncontrolled proliferation and neoangiogenesis, two hallmarks of neural cancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>).</p><p>Similar to the regulation of other transcription factors, Id protein activity has been previously reported to be controlled by additional Id partners that are unrelated to transcription factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>). These studies have largely focused on Id2. Among the partners is the retinoblastoma tumor suppressor protein Rb. Rb binds to and antagonizes Id2 from binding to transcription factors, thus releasing bHLH protein-mediated transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>). Recently, cytoplasmic proteins such as enigma homolog (ENH), polycystin-2 (PC2) and interferon-induced protein p204 were reported to bind to Id2 and sequestrate it into cytoplasm, thus preventing the access of Id2 to its nuclear partners (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16 B17 B18">16&#x02013;18</xref>). Loss of the cytoplasmic adaptor ENH was suggested to boost Id2 activity in aggressive neuroblastomas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>). In view of the oncogenic activity of Id2, proteins that prevent Id2 from binding to bHLH factors may be potential tumor suppressors.</p><p>Four-and-a-half-LIM-only protein 2 (FHL2) is the best-studied member of the FHL family, which is expressed in several human adult tissues, including the brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>). FHL2 has no DNA-binding activity but can regulate multiple cell signaling pathways by interacting with various transcription factors known to be involved in development and tumorigenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>). The function of FHL2 in cancer is particularly intriguing, because it may act as an oncoprotein or as a tumor suppressor in a tissue-dependent fashion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>). The dual nature of FHL2 is reflected by the finding that it functions as activator or repressor of its interacting transcription factors depending on the cell type. So far, the FHL2 function in neuroblastoma cells is still unclear.</p><p>Mediation of the interaction of almost all recognized partners with Id2 is considered to be through its HLH domain. An exception is APC/C<sup>CDH1</sup>, which interacts with Id2 through the D-box domain of Id2 and mediates ubiquitin-dependent proteasomal degradation of Id2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>). We supposed that Id2/bHLH activity may also be regulated by proteins interacting with Id2 via the non-HLH region. We used the HLH-deleted and D-box-mutated human Id2 as bait protein in a yeast two-hybrid system to identify novel Id2 interactors. FHL2 was identified to physically interact with Id proteins through an N-terminal conservation region. FHL2, whose expression increased during retinoic acid (RA)-induced differentiation of neuroblastoma cells, competitively prevented Ids from binding to E47 and thus largely restored E47-mediated transcription. Finally, we proposed an anti-proliferation function of FHL2 in neural cells by showing that FHL2 can inactivate the transcriptional and cell-cycle-promoting functions of Id2 in neuroblastoma cells.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Plasmids and siRNA</title><p>The plasmids including pcDNA3&#x02013;Id2&#x02013;DBM containing the complete coding sequence of the full-length human Id2 with a D-box mutation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>), 5xE-box-<italic>Luc</italic> reporter and pcDNA3-E47 were kindly provided by Dr Iavarone (Columbia University Medical Center, New York).

The full-length FHL2 was pulled down by GST&#x02013;Id3-N but not by GST&#x02013;Id3-C and GST alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>C). Next, we further showed that the full-length FHL2 could be pulled downed by the Id2 (1&#x02013;28 aa) and Id3 (1&#x02013;32 aa) mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>C), which suggests that the N-terminal region of Ids is sufficient for FHL2 interaction. We noted a relatively conserved region within the N termini of Ids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>D, left panel) that formed a conserved small loop&#x02013;helix structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>D, middle panel), so we generated mutant Id proteins (Id1&#x02013;4) with this conserved region deleted (Id1-del to Id4-del), and then performed pulldown assays. Surprisingly, FHL2 could no longer be pulled down by any of these Id mutants; however, the bHLH transcriptional factor E47 could be pulled down by Id2-del (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>D, right panel). These results indicated that the residues in the N-terminal region of Ids are indispensable for FHL2 binding. We postulated that the deletion of residues in the N-terminal region of Ids may cause a gross conformational change of Ids that disrupts the binding of FHL2 but not E47.</p><p>To more thoroughly characterize the FHL2&#x02013;Id interaction, we analyzed a series of <sup>35</sup>S-labeled FHL2 domain deletions for interaction with GST&#x02013;Id2. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>E, the full-length FHL2, FHL2&#x00394;C1, FHL2&#x00394;N1 and FHL2&#x00394;N2, but not FHL2&#x00394;C2 and FHL2&#x00394;N3, were pulled down by GST&#x02013;Id2, which demonstrates that both the second and the third LIM domain in FHL2 are required for the FHL2&#x02013;Id2 interaction.</p><p>To confirm that FHL2 can interact with Id2 in cells, we transiently transfected COS-7 cells with Flag-FHL2, Myc-Id2, or a combination of Flag-FHL2 and Myc-Id2. Cell lysates were first precipitated with a Flag antibody, then underwent immunoblotting analysis with an anti-Myc tag or Id2 antibody. An intense band corresponding to Myc-Id2 was detected only in immunoprecipitates containing Flag-FHL2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>F). The presence of Id2 in the FHL2-containing immune complexes is specific, because an irrelevant GAL4&#x02013;DBD antibody failed to immunoprecipitate Id2. A reciprocal coimmunoprecipitation experiment with use of an anti-Myc antibody also revealed the presence of Flag-FHL2 in the immune complexes containing Myc-Id2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>F). Next, we cotransfected Flag-FHL2 and Myc-Id2-del or Myc-Id2-&#x003b4;HLH into COS-7 cells for CoIP assays. As demonstrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>G, Flag-FHL2/Myc-Id2&#x02013;&#x003b4;HLH but not Flag-FHL2/Myc-Id2-del could be reciprocally coimmunoprecipitated by use of anti-Flag and/or anti-Myc antibodies. These results confirmed that the N-terminal loop&#x02013;helix structure in Id2 but not the HLH domain is required for the FHL2&#x02013;Id2 interaction in the cell system.</p></sec><sec><title>FHL2 antagonizes the inhibition of E-box-mediated transcription by Ids, but not by Id-dels</title><p>To explore the possible functional significance of the observed FHL2-Id2 interaction, we performed luciferase reporter assays with five multimerized E-boxes driving the expression of luciferase (5xE-box-<italic>Luc</italic>). Transfection of MCF-7 cells with reporter alone or reporter plus FHL2 expression vector revealed background luciferase activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>A, lane 1 and 2). Cotransfection of E-box-<italic>Luc</italic> plus E47 significantly activated the system in cells (lane 3). Given that E47/Id2 heterodimers lose the ability to bind to the E-box, Id2 cotransfection resulted in a significant repression of the E47-activated luciferase activity (lane 5); however, this repression was markedly antagonized by FHL2 in a dose-dependent manner (lanes 6&#x02013;8). FHL2 slightly increased E47 activation of the reporter (lane 4), which might be due to FHL2 inhibition of the endogenous Id activities. Similar results were obtained in 293T and SH-SY5Y cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>B and C), which suggests that the inhibitory effect of FHL2 on Id2 activity in this assay is independent of other tissue-specific cofactors. To further confirm whether this repression was mediated by the direct interaction of FHL2 and Id2, we used the Id2-del expression vector, a 9-aa deleted (from 15 to 23 aa) Id2 mutant that cannot interact with FHL2 <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>D and G, for luciferase assays. As expected, Id2-del also significantly inhibited E47-mediated reporter activity as did the wild-type Id2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>D, lane 3); however, unlike Id2 repression, Id2-del repression was not antagonized by FHL2. Furthermore, we also observed that FHL2 significantly overcame the inhibition of E47-mediated transcription by Id1, Id3 and Id4 in MCF-7 cells, but this inhibitory effect was abrogated in Id1-del, Id3-del and Id4-del mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>E). Taken together, these data strongly indicate that FHL2 can potently repress Id activities by directly associating with them, thus restoring the transcription programme driven by E47.

Id2 present in both Flag and E47 antibody immunoprecipitates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>A, panels V and VIII) and reciprocal experiment results demonstrated E47 and FHL2 detected in Myc antibody immunoprecipitates (panels I and II). These results further confirmed the interaction of Id2 with FHL2 or E47.

The specific E47-DNA band was not affected by adding either an IVT-empty vector or IVT-FHL2 proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>C, lanes 2 and 3).

To do so, we used human neuroblastoma SK&#x02013;N&#x02013;SH and SH&#x02013;SY5Y cells, in which the function of the Id2&#x02013;E47 transcriptome in cell proliferation and differentiation has been well studied (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>).

We tested the dynamic expression of FHL2 during retinoic acid (RA)-induced differentiation of these cells. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>A, FHL2 expression was very weak and even negligible in both SK&#x02013;N&#x02013;SH and SH&#x02013;SY5Y cells. However, treatment with RA (1 &#x003bc;M) induced a progressive and remarkable elevation of both FHL2 mRNA and protein levels. In accordance with previous reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>), RA administration led to a marked inhibition of Id2 gene expression. In RA-untreated SH&#x02013;SY5Y cells, the endogenous interaction of FHL2 and Id2 could not be detected by CoIP assays but could be detected in SH&#x02013;SY5Y cells with 6 h RA treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>B). The opposite expression style and interaction of FHL2 and Id2 during cell differentiation induced by RA suggested an antagonistic role of FHL2 for Id2 activity. <fig id="F5" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><p>The reverse expression and functional interaction of FHL2 and Id2 was induced by retinoic acid (RA) in human neuroblastoma cells.

Therefore, we investigated whether FHL2 inhibits cell proliferation and opposes Id2-mediated entry into the S phase. FHL2 transfection markedly inhibited the colony formation of both SK&#x02013;N&#x02013;SH and SH&#x02013;SY5Y cells, whereas Id2 or Id2-del transfection promoted colony formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>A). These results clearly demonstrate the opposite effect of FHL2 and Id2 on cell proliferation. Next, SK&#x02013;N&#x02013;SH and SH&#x02013;SY5Y cells were cotransfected with FHL2 and Id2 in the presence of a GFP expression plasmid, and the rate of DNA synthesis was measured by incorporation of BrdU in GFP-positive cells. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>B, ectopic FHL2 strongly inhibited S phase entry and abrogated Id2-stimulated DNA synthesis. To confirm whether this effect resulted from the direct interaction of FHL2 and Id2, we transiently transfected Id2-del or Id2-del plus FHL2 into SH&#x02013;SY5Y cells and performed BrdU incorporation assays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>C). Although the significant promotion of S phase entry was observed in both Id2-del and wild-type Id2 cells, the promotional effect in Id2-del cells was not abolished by FHL2 as for wild-type Id2. Next, we performed BrdU incorporation assays in FHL2-siRNA-transfected SH&#x02013;SY5Y cells. Not unexpectedly, transfection of FHL2-specific siRNA slightly but not significantly promoted the S-phase entry because of the very weak and even negligible expression level of FHL2 in SH&#x02013;SY5Y cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>D). Similarly, FHL2-siRNA transduction did not significantly promote the S-phase entry of SK&#x02013;N&#x02013;SH cells (data not shown). Altogether, these data suggest that the ectopic or RA-induced expression of FHL2 can effectively inhibit cell-cycle progression of neuroblastoma cells by antagonizing Id2 activity. <fig id="F6" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><p>Ectopic expression of FHL2 significantly inhibited proliferation of human neuroblastoma cells by suppressing Id2-promoted S phase entry.

Similar to a previous report (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>), E47 effectively induced the accumulation of p57<sup>Kip2</sup> in cells, and this effect was abolished by Id2. Ectopic expression of FHL2 reversed the repressive effect of Id2 and partially restored E47-induced p57<sup>Kip2</sup> up-regulation. Finally, to further validate whether the induction of E47 target genes by FHL2 is directly linked to the FHL2&#x02013;Id2 association, we performed qPCR for p57<sup>Kip2</sup> in SK&#x02013;N&#x02013;SH cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>C).

Although the molecular mechanism involved in this process has been well dissected, additional regulators should work in concert with Ids in view of the spatio-temporal variation of Id-controlled gene expression. In this study, the LIM-only protein FHL2, a well-known cofactor or adaptor of several transcription factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>), was identified as a novel Id2 interactor. In addition, the interaction of FHL2 with three other members of the Id protein family (Id1, Id3 and Id4) was demonstrated in GST-pulldown <italic>in vitro</italic> assays. We further show that FHL2 blocks Id&#x02013;E47 coupling by a competitive binding mechanism, which subsequently represses the inhibitory effect of Ids on E47-mediated transcription. Finally, the FHL2 regulation of the E47&#x02013;Id2 transcriptome was extended to the proliferation of the neuroblastma cells. These findings underscore an important function of FHL2 in regulating the Id2 signaling pathway.</p><p>The LIM domain-containing proteins can function as adaptors or scaffolds to support the assembly of multimeric protein complexes and can operate as competitors, autoinhibitors and localizers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>). As a member of the LIM protein family, FHL2 has been shown to associate with several transcriptional factors or signaling transducers such as AR, CBP/p300, &#x003b2;-catenin, FOXO1, AP1 and TRAF6, to regulate signal transduction and gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>). In most cases, FHL2 protein appears to participate in functional complexes to modulate the tissue-specific activity of activators or repressors. One possible explanation for the dual role of FHL2 in a transcription or regulating signaling pathway might be that FHL2 acts to stabilize the functional complexes as a type of bridging factor. This explanation was supported by the fact, like that the formation of a ternary complex by FHL2, CBP/p300, and &#x003b2;-catenin could synergistically activate AR-mediated transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>), and that FHL2 interacts with titin, a protein that plays a crucial role as organizer of the sarcomere, and functions as an adaptor molecule that links the metabolic enzymes MM-creatine kinase, adenylate cyclase and phosphofructokinase to titin, thereby helping to recruit metabolic enzymes needed for energy provision during muscle contraction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>). In dramatic contrast, we observed that FHL2 acts as a competitor of E47 for Id2 binding and subsequently allows E47 to recruit to its target DNA and execute its transcriptional activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>). Although different epitopes of Id2 are required for FHL2 and E47 binding, the binding site for FHL2 or E47 of Id2 may be masked by a conformational change of Id2 when it is occupied by FHL2 or E47. In addition, Id2 may not provide enough surface space to simultaneously interact with multiple proteins; after all, Id2 is only 18 kDa. Indeed, such competitive binding is also observed for other FHL2-interacting molecules. For example, the cytoplasmic domain of TRAF6, which is formed by few amino acid numbers, can provide a binding surface for only FHL2 or RANK. As a consequence, FHL2 antagonizes the RANK&#x02013;TRAF6 interaction and blunts the RANK&#x02013;TRAF6 signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>).</p><p>Emerging evidence has linked FHL2 to cell-cycle progression. However, the function of FHL2 in cell proliferation is particularly intriguing, because it may exert a positive or negative effect on cell-cycle-regulated processes in a tissue-dependent fashion. This dual nature of FHL2 can be explained by the finding that FHL2 can function as a repressor or activator of transcriptional activity depending on the cell type. For example, FHL2 promoted SKI-induced proliferation of UCD-Mel-N melanoma cells and enhanced proliferation of MDA-MB-231 human breast cancer cells by regulating cell-cycle-dependent p21 expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>). Loss of FHL2 downregulated the expression of cyclin D1 and greatly reduced the proliferative capacity of mouse embryo fibroblasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>). In contrast, FHL2 antagonized the proliferation of differentiated myoblasts by downregulating cyclin D1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>) and suppressed liver cancer cell growth through a TGF &#x003b2;-like pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>). In this study, we demonstrated an antagonistic effect of FHL2 on Id2-driven proliferation of neuroblastoma cell types. The <italic>p57<sup>Kip2</sup>, IGF2</italic> and <italic>H19</italic> genes, belonging to the human chromosome 11p15.5-imprinted cluster, which have crucial functions in differentiation, the cell cycle and oncogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46 B47 B48">46&#x02013;48</xref>), are within the small group of E47&#x02013;Id2 targets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>). In accordance with a previous report (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>), we also demonstrated that the expression of these genes was strongly induced by E47 and inhibited by Id2. Among them, p57<sup>Kip2</sup> is one of the three members of the Cip/Kip family of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors and a well-known cell-cycle regulator (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>), the induction of which is essential for E47-mediated inhibition of the cell cycle in neuroblastoma cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>). Ectopic expression of FHL2 in neuroblastoma cells strongly induced the expression of <italic>p57<sup>Kip2</sup>, IGF2</italic> and <italic>H19</italic> genes by regulating the Id2&#x02013;E47 transcriptome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>). Given the oncogenic activity of Id2 in tumors from the nervous system, our data suggest that FHL2 possesses a tumor suppressor function in these cell types.</p><p>Id family proteins were implicated in the control of differentiation in organisms from fly to human (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>). There is general agreement with the notion that differentiation of a variety of cell types requires elimination of the Id function. Thus, the functional inhibitors of Id proteins might possess the potential to facilitate cell differentiation. Here, we demonstrated a reverse expression relation between Id2 and its functional repressor FHL2 in differentiated neuroblastoma cells induced by RA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>). In addition, independent evidences suggested a diverse role of FHL2 and Id proteins during the differentiation process of myoblasts and osteoblasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>). These limited data implied that a refined regulation mechanism of Id function by FHL2 is required during the processes of development and cellular differentiation.</p><p>In the past decade, numerous reports demonstrated the aberrant accumulation of Id proteins in solid tumors and Ids facilitating tumorigenesis by repressing cell differentiation, stimulating cell proliferation and promoting tumor neoangiogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5 B6 B7 B8 B9">5&#x02013;9</xref>). As a functional suppressor of Id2, FHL2 is frequently deregulated, which includes being overexpressed and down-regulated in various types of tumors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>). The most common mechanism selected by tumor cells to activate Id2 function is to elevate the expression of Id2 gene. In this study, we demonstrated that the expression of FHL2 is very weak and even negligible in human neuroblastoma cells. Based on our findings, we suggest that tumor cells may target another level in Id biology regulation. The fact that RA induced the reverse expression of Id2 and its functional repressor FHL2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>) indicated that FHL2 may be an important stalker against Id2 protein activity in neuroblastoma cells. Loss of FHL2 will release the oncogenic activity of Id2 and may contribute to tumor progression. Testing the ratio of FHL2 to Id2 expression in human neuroblastoma cells might be beneficial to differentiate different clinopathological stages.</p><p>In conclusion, these findings provide definite evidence for FHL2&#x02013;Id2 interaction and its corresponding functional effect. The functional activity of FHL2 acting as an repressor of the oncogenic activity of Id2 in neuroblastoma cells suggests that loss of FHL2 may be involved in tumorigenesis and progression of the nervous system.</p></sec><sec><title>FUNDING</title><p>National Natural Science Foundation of China (grant 30870507); Ministry of Science and Technology of China (2005CB522603 and 2005CB522400).
