Among the many oncogenes and tumor suppressors, cell-cell junction associated proteins, such as &#x003b2;-catenin and adenomatous polyposis coli (APC), contribute to cancer development by disrupting the E-cadherin based cell-cell junction, as well as interfering with cell proliferation, altering karyotype, and reducing apoptosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>].</p><p>&#x003b4;-Catenin, or NPRAP (<underline>n</underline>eural <underline>p</underline>lakophilin <underline>r</underline>elated <underline>a</underline>rmadillo <underline>p</underline>rotein)/Neurojungin, is an adhesive junction associated protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>], which was initially identified as a neural specific protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. &#x003b4;-Catenin belongs to the p120<sup>ctn </sup>subgroup in the armadillo/&#x003b2;-catenin superfamily [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. While &#x003b2;-catenin and p120<sup>ctn </sup>are ubiquitously expressed in the body, &#x003b4;-catenin distribution is principally restricted to the brain in healthy individuals. However, it has become increasingly clear that &#x003b4;-catenin is expressed in a variety of cancers of peripheral tissues, including breast, prostate, and esophageal tumors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. Recently, we showed that &#x003b4;-catenin is upregulated in over 80% of prostatic adenocarcinomas, and its expression is correlated with increasing Gleason scores [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. An increased expression of &#x003b4;-catenin is accompanied by reduced E-cadherin and p120<sup>ctn </sup>in primary prostatic adenocarcinomas, and the forced overexpression of &#x003b4;-catenin in cultured prostate cancer cells can induce the redistribution of E-cadherin and p120<sup>ctn </sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. While it is established that cell-cell junction proteins, such as E-cadherin, &#x003b2;-catenin, APC, and p120<sup>ctn</sup>, are involved in cell adhesion and motility as well as cancer cell growth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>], it is not clear whether &#x003b4;-catenin overexpression exerts any effects on prostate cancer cells.</p><p>In this study, we tested the hypothesis that &#x003b4;-catenin plays a direct role in prostate cancer cell growth by altering gene profiles of cell cycle regulation and cell survival. We demonstrated, for the first time, that &#x003b4;-catenin overexpression promotes anchorage-independent prostate cancer cell growth and tumor xenografts in nude mice. We determined that the ability of &#x003b4;-catenin overexpression to promote prostate tumor xenograft growth is dependent on the amino- (NH<sub>2</sub>) and carboxyl- (COOH) terminal sequences flanking the armadillo repeat domains. In addition, quantitative RT<sup>2 </sup>Profiler&#x02122; PCR arrays revealed a wide range of gene alterations involved in cell cycle and survival regulation. These findings support the notion that at least one consequence of an increased &#x003b4;-catenin expression in prostate cancer development is the alteration of cell cycle and survival gene profiles, thereby promoting tumor progression.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>&#x003b4;-Catenin overexpression promotes prostate cancer cell growth in culture</title><p>Our previous studies showed that &#x003b4;-catenin expression is very weak in normal prostatic glandular epithelial cells but is remarkably increased in prostatic adenocarcinoma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. Screening for prostate cancer cell lines overexpressing &#x003b4;-catenin, we found that &#x003b4;-catenin expression was moderately increased in CWR22Rv-1 and PC-3 cells when compared to non-cancer prostate epithelial cells PZ-HPV-7 but remained very low in LNCaP and DU145 cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. Therefore, CWR22Rv-1, derived from a recurrent human prostate cancer xenograft [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>], and PC-3 cells, derived from a bone metastasis of prostatic adenocarcinoma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>], were chosen to test the hypothesis that the increase or decrease in &#x003b4;-catenin expression affect prostate cancer cell growth, respectively.</p><p>We transfected &#x003b4;-<italic>catenin </italic>cDNA with EGFP fusion into CWR22Rv-1 cells (Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>). The stable cell lines were established by G418 selection followed by cell sorting to enrich for GFP emitting cell populations. This method allowed for the establishment of cell culture that contained almost 100% &#x003b4;-catenin overexpressing cells. While vector transfected cells showed clear monolayer cell morphology (Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A, a</xref>), &#x003b4;-catenin overexpressing cells tended to form clusters (Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A, d</xref>). This result was reminiscent of the disruption of cell monolayer morphology in MDCK kidney epithelial cells overexpressing &#x003b4;-catenin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Vector transfected cells, with GFP as the transfection marker uniformly distributed in the cells (Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A, b</xref>; see insert), displayed E-cadherin at the cell-cell junction (Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A, c</xref>; see insert). However, &#x003b4;-catenin overexpression at the cell-cell junction (Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A, e</xref>; see insert) showed disrupted E-cadherin distribution (Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A, f</xref>; see insert).</p><p>A number of studies showed that disrupted cell-cell junction can alter cell growth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>].

Compared to vector transfected cells, &#x003b4;-catenin overexpression led to changes in a number of genes in these pathways. Notably, cell cycle regulatory genes such as cyclin D1 (CCND1) and cdc34 (CDC34), activation of which promotes G1 to S transition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>], showed more than a 2-fold increase (Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5A</xref>). Bcl2L1 (BCL2L1), the long isoform of Bcl2 involved in anti-apoptotic activation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>], increased by 3.84 fold. CSF2 (colony stimulating factor 2)/GM-CSF (granulate-macrophage colony stimulating factor), involved in tumor metastasis to the bone [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>], showed a 3.34-fold increase (Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5A</xref>). ITGA7 (integrin &#x003b1;7) increased by 6.15 fold whereas other cell adhesion and matrix genes such as COL16A1 (collagen 16), ITGB3 (integrin &#x003b2;3), MMP14, MMP15 and CTGF (connective tissue growth factor), each showed increases over 2 fold. One unique biochemical property within prostate epithelial cells is their dependence on glycolysis for energy production. HK2 (Hexokinase 2), involved in the increased rate of glycolysis seen in rapidly growing cancer cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>], was increased 2.2-fold (Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5A</xref>).

For example, while the total expression level of histone-H3 was similar in both vector and &#x003b4;-catenin transfected cells (Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5C</xref>), histone-H3 phosphorylation was clearly elevated in &#x003b4;-catenin overexpressing cells when compared to control cells, which supports the immunofluorescent light microscopic observations of increased mitotic activity in &#x003b4;-catenin overexpressing cells (Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B</xref>). Although Erk1/2 expression did not show any changes, the expression of survivin, a member of the inhibitor-of-apoptosis family known to be overexpressed by cancer cells, was increased in &#x003b4;-catenin overexpressing CWR22Rv-1 cells when compared to control cells (Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5C</xref>). Cell cycle inhibitor p21<sup>Cip1 </sup>is a downstream effector of p53 mediated cell cycle interruption [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. However, p21<sup>Cip1 </sup>expression in &#x003b4;-catenin overexpressing cells was reduced when compared to vector transfected cells (Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5C</xref>). These results indicated that the effects of &#x003b4;-catenin on cell viability could also be due to reduced cell death, in addition to an increased mitotic activity.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>&#x003b2;-Catenin/armadillo superfamily proteins are expressed in cells of all major tissue types including epithelial cells. They play important roles in cancer with some of its members as oncogenes while others act as tumor suppressors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. &#x003b4;-Catenin (gene designation as <italic>CTNND2</italic>), however, is a unique member of the family because it is primarily expressed in the central nervous system of normal individuals. However, &#x003b4;-catenin is now well established as being overexpressed in prostate cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>].</p><p>The frequently increased expression of the neuronal protein &#x003b4;-catenin in peripheral prostate cancer tissue raised important questions such as what mechanisms are in place in cancer to result in a high level of &#x003b4;-catenin expression. &#x003b4;-<italic>Catenin </italic>gene amplification was observed in cervical cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>] and bladder cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. Transcription factor Pax6 was found to play an important role for regulation of &#x003b4;-catenin expression in developing eye and central nervous system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. Recently, we showed that the ectopic overexpression of E2F1 and Pax6 positively upregulates &#x003b4;-catenin expression in prostate cancer cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. Furthermore, increased translation efficiency by somatic mutations in the 5'-untranslated region of &#x003b4;-<italic>catenin </italic>was observed in prostate cancer patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>], further supporting the hypothesis that cancer cells implement multiple mechanisms to upregulate &#x003b4;-catenin expression to advance tumor progression. In this study, we provided the first evidence that &#x003b4;-catenin is capable of promoting the expansion of prostate cancer cells, altering gene profiles of prostate cancer cell cycle regulation and survival.</p><p>Regarding cell proliferation and colonization, earlier studies evaluating MDCK cells transfected with &#x003b4;-catenin showed that there were no significant differences between MDCK cells expressing &#x003b4;-catenin and control cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Interestingly, ectopic expression of &#x003b4;-catenin in NIH3T3 fibroblast cells inhibited cell division and induced cellular processes with branches [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. However, &#x003b4;-catenin overexpression in pheochromocytoma (PC12) cells increased cell proliferation and promoted neurite outgrowth when treated with nerve growth factor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. These studies, in addition to our current findings, suggest that &#x003b4;-catenin effects on cell growth are context dependent. It is possible that preneoplastic cells may not tolerate high levels of stable &#x003b4;-catenin expression, such as in MDCK cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>], NIH3T3 cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>], and mammary epithelial cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. We have also failed to develop stable cell lines using PZ-HPV-7 (non-cancer human prostate epithelial origin) and NL20 (non-cancer human lung epithelial origin) cells (Zeng and Lu, unpublished data). However, in tumor cells, such as PC12, CWR22Rv-1, PC-3 and NCI-H1299, stable cell lines with &#x003b4;-catenin overexpression were not only successfully produced, but also showed increased cell viability, suggesting that &#x003b4;-catenin does not transform normal cells but promotes cancer cell expansion.</p><p>The armadillo repeating units reveal the most significant homology among &#x003b2;-catenin superfamily proteins, while the sequences flanking the armadillo domain are quite variable [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. This feature is consistent with the hypothesis that sequences outside the armadillo domains play important regulatory roles to characterize each different member. &#x003b4;-Catenin interacts with classical cadherins through the armadillo domains, and the NH<sub>2</sub>- or COOH-terminal sequences on their own do not localize to cell-cell junctions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. In addition, the deletion of COOH-terminal 207 amino acids abolished the &#x003b4;-catenin mediated process extension in NIH3T3 cells and compromised the roles of &#x003b4;-catenin in promoting dendrite outgrowth in neurons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. Removing the NH<sub>2</sub>-terminal 280 amino acids also remarkably altered the effects of &#x003b4;-catenin on 3T3 cell morphology [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. In our present study, we showed that while the full-length &#x003b4;-catenin promoted prostate cancer cell colony formation in soft agar and tumor xenograft growth in nude mice, &#x003b4;-catenin with the deletion of either NH<sub>2</sub>-terminal 280 amino acids or COOH-terminal 207 amino acids lost its ability to promote tumor development. These studies underscore the importance of these sequences outside the armadillo domain to the functions of &#x003b4;-catenin in cancer.</p><p>Gene profiling can provide initial indications of what may be the potential molecular pathways that &#x003b4;-catenin employs to contribute to tumor progression. We identified a number of genes that displayed changes in expression when &#x003b4;-catenin is overexpressed in prostate cancer cells. Several of these genes, such as cyclin D1, cdc34, Bcl2L1, and HK2, are especially interesting. Both cyclin D1 and cdc34 are involved in G1 to S transition, and Bcl2L1 is a long isoform of Bcl2 which protects cells from undergoing apoptosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. HK2 phosphorylates glucose to produce glucose-6-phosphate, thus committing glucose to the glycolytic pathway. Expression of HK2 has been indicated in rapidly growing cancer cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. Nevertheless, we still do not know how an increased &#x003b4;-catenin expression affects these pathways in prostate cancer development. Our future studies will dissect the signaling events to determine the mechanisms by which &#x003b4;-catenin employs to promote prostate cancer cell growth and tumor progression.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>This study is the first to demonstrate the effects of &#x003b4;-catenin overexpression in prostate cancer cells. We show that these effects rely on the &#x003b4;-catenin domains outside armadillo repeating sequences, providing future direction for investigating the molecular basis of &#x003b4;-catenin mediated prostate cancer development. Our studies suggest that an increased expression of &#x003b4;-catenin in human prostate cancer permits the alteration of cell cycle and survival gene profiles, which may advance tumor progression.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec sec-type="materials"><title>Materials</title><p>Mouse anti-&#x003b4;-catenin and p21<sup>Cip1 </sup>were from BD Biosciences (Palo Alto, CA).
