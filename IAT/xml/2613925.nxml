Other factors might thus importantly contribute in increasing infection by HTLV-I. Galectin-1 is a galactoside-binding lectin which is secreted by activated T lymphocytes. Several functions have been attributed to this protein including its capacity to increase cell-to-cell adhesion. Based on previous studies, we postulated that this protein could also accentuate HTLV-I infection.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Herein, we demonstrate that galectin-1 expression and release are higher in HTLV-I-infected T cells in comparison to uninfected T cells. Furthermore, galectin-1 expression was activated in various cell lines expressing the wild type viral Tax protein while this induction was minimal upon expression of NF-&#x003ba;B activation-defective TaxM22. Cotransfection of these Tax expression vectors with galectin-1 promoter-driven luciferase constructs confirmed that Tax upregulated galectin-1 promoter activity. However, a NF-&#x003ba;B-independent mechanism was strongly favoured in this induction of galectin-1 expression as no activation of the promoter was apparent in Jurkat cells treated with known NF-&#x003ba;B activators. Using HTLV-I envelope pseudotyped HIV-1 virions, galectin-1 was shown to increase infectivity. In addition, a co-culture assay with HTLV-I-infected cells also indicated an increase in cell fusion upon addition of galectin-1. This effect was not mediated by factors present in the supernatant of the HTLV-I-infected cells.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>These data suggest that HTLV-I Tax increases galectin-1 expression and that this modulation could play an important role in HTLV-I infection by stabilizing both cell-to-cell and virus-cell interactions.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>Human T-cell Leukemia Virus type I (HTLV-I) is the etiological agent of adult T cell leukemia (ATL) and HTLV-I-associated myelopathy/tropical spastic paraparesis (HAM/TSP) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. It has been estimated that 20 million individuals are infected worldwide [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. The <italic>in vivo </italic>target cells are mature CD4+CD45RO T lymphocytes and CD8+ T lymphocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>], although other cell types have been suggested to be potential target including lung epithelial cells, as recently demonstrated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. HTLV-I is transmitted between individuals by the transfer of infected lymphocytes and is thought to require repeated contacts as only one out of 1 &#x000d7; 10<sup>5 </sup>to 1 &#x000d7; 10<sup>6 </sup>viruses is infectious [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. During viral transmission, a contact is established between an uninfected and an infected T cell by the interaction of the gp46 viral protein with its cellular receptor subsequently followed by the polarization of the infected cell cytoskeleton at the site of cell-to-cell contact and the accumulation of viruses at the cell junction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. GLUT-1 has been reported to be part of this receptor and to be involved in the first step of viral entry, although its exact role is still ill-defined [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. Although the cellular ICAM-1 protein has been established as a potential inducer of microtubule reorganization, the viral Tax protein has also been shown to be active in this process [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>].</p><p>Tax is the viral transactivator of HTLV-I allowing transcription through the three Tax-responsive elements (TRE1) present in the U3 region of the Long Terminal Repeat (LTR) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. This viral protein also promotes transcription of many cellular genes. To activate transcription, Tax does not bind directly to the different cellular and viral promoters but forms complexes with transcription factors, such as the cAMP Response Element Binding transcription factor (CREB). In uninfected cells, CREB phosphorylation leads to its interaction with CBP (CREB-binding protein) and the recruitment of the transcriptional machinery to CRE elements. In HTLV-I infected cells, Tax binds simultaneously to CBP and CREB and recruits the complex to viral TRE1 allowing constitutive LTR-dependent transcription [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. Several studies have also provided detailed analysis on the mechanism of Tax-mediated activation of NF-&#x003ba;B by its association to IKK and upstream kinases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. Modulation of cellular genes by Tax has been extensively studied and has been shown to involve various transcription factors. In a previous study, using high-density gene arrays, 763 genes were shown to have differential gene expression profiles in HTLV-I-transformed and immortalized cell lines compared to peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. One of the genes from which the expression was upregulated corresponded to the mammalian soluble &#x003b2;-galactoside-binding lectin, galectin-1 (LGALS1).</p><p>Galectins are a phylogenetically conserved family of proteins, present from invertebrates to mammals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. This family is constituted of at least 14 different galectins, most of which have an affinity for &#x003b2;-galactoside containing glycoconjugates, such as lactosamine residues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. The galectin family is further subdivided into three subfamilies: the prototype, the tandem repeat and the chimera groups [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. Galectin-1 is a member of the prototype subfamily. While galectin-1 is primarily synthesized as a monomer that has one carbohydrate recognition domain (CRD), it also forms a dimer, which thus has the capacity to bind to two different &#x003b2;-galactoside-containing ligands. Galectin-1 is present in the cytoplasm of many cell types but can also be secreted [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. Indeed, although nascent galectin-1 does not contain any signal sequence or hydrophobic domain necessary for usage of the secretory pathway, it has been well established that certain type of cells, such as activated T cells and thymus epithelial cells, secrete this lectin through a leaderless secretion pathway without compromising membrane integrity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. The expression of the galectin-1 gene is modulated during cellular differentiation and transformation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. Its expression is controlled by DNA methylation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>], known to restrict the access of transcription factors to binding sites [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. The +1/+30 region of the galectin-1 gene is well preserved between different species [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>] and the upstream (-57/-31) and downstream elements (+10/+57) of the initiation site account for the majority of the basal promoter activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. However, little information is available on the transcription factor(s) involved in the modulation of the expression of this gene.</p><p>Being a dimer, galectin-1 could mediate cell-cell or cell-pathogen interactions. Indeed, our recent report suggests that galectin-1 stabilizes HIV-1 binding to its target, activating CD4+ T lymphocytes and therefore promoting HIV-1 infectivity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. Since an early report has suggested that HTLV-I-infected cells express galectin-1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>] and HTLV-I infection requires cell-cell contact for several cell types, we investigated the pattern of expression of galectin-1 in infected cells and its possible impact on HTLV-I transmission. Our data show that Tax significantly induces transcription from the galectin-1 promoter in an NF-&#x003ba;B-, SRF- and CREB-independent manner. In fact, cell lines chronically infected by HTLV-I release more galectin-1 when compared to non-infected T cell lines. Furthermore, soluble galectin-1 increases HTLV-I cellular infection by HTLV-I gp46-pseudotyped HIV-1 virions. In addition, our data suggest that soluble galectin-1 enhances HTLV-I-mediated cell fusion between chronically infected cells and uninfected cells.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Cell culture and reagents</title><p>The following HTLV-I-infected cell lines were used in this study: C8166-45 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>], C91-PL [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>], MJ [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>], MT2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>] and S1T [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>].

Supernatants were then filtered through a 0.22 &#x003bc;m-pore-size filter to remove cells and cellular debris. Viral preparations were stored at -85&#x000b0;C until needed. Virus particles were titrated through the use of a sandwich ELISA specific for the HIV-1 p24 capsid protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B55">55</xref>]. Pseudotyped virions were subsequently used in infection experiments of Jurkat and PBMCs. Cells were initially incubated with various concentrations of galectin-1 (ranging from 0 to 4 &#x003bc;M) for 30 minutes in the absence or presence of 50 mM lactose and then infected with luciferase-encoding HTLV-I env-pseudotyped viruses (10 ng of p24 per 1 &#x000d7; 10<sup>5 </sup>cells) for 48 hours at 37&#x000b0;C before lysis.

In order to determine whether galectin-1 expression is indeed altered in HTLV-I-infected cells, RT-PCR experiments were performed to compare the level of galectin-1 gene expression between non infected human T cells and HTLV-I-infected human T cells. Sequence-specific primers were derived from two different exons to insure that amplified products were derived from cDNA and not contaminating genomic DNA. As presented in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>, results showed that galectin-1 was expressed in all HTLV-I-infected cell lines studied in contrast to non-infected T cell lines in which galectin-1 mRNA expression was either undetectable or slightly expressed.

Galectin-1 expression was then analyzed by RT-PCR. As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>, transfection of the K30 proviral DNA led to an induction in the expression of galectin-1. In addition, comparable induced levels of galectin-1 mRNA were observed in 293T cells expressing wild-type Tax and both Tax mutants defective for CREB and SRF activation (Tax 703 and Tax &#x00394;3). In contrast, cells that were transfected with the Tax M22 (deficient in NF-&#x003ba;B activation) expression vector did not demonstrate a significant difference in galectin-1 mRNA levels when compared to cells transfected with the control vector (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>). As RT-PCR experiments further show that cells expressed similar levels of Tax, this difference in upregulation of galectin-1 mRNA level was not due to differences in the expression level of the different Tax proteins in transfected 293T cells. In order to confirm these results, RNA from 293T cells transfected with the various Tax expression vectors were quantitatively analysed for galectin-1 expression by real-time RT-PCR.

Two fragments of 0.5 kbp and 1.2 kbp containing the transcription initiation site deduced from sequence homology with the mouse galectin-1 gene were derived from the human galectin-1 promoter region. Both fragments were cloned upstream of the luciferase reporter gene of the pGL3-Basic vector. Before determining the effect of Tax on these constructs, the Tax M22 expression vector was first tested in the context of Jurkat cells to see if it was specifically deficient in activating NF-&#x003ba;B (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>). These results indeed confirmed previous studies in Jurkat cells: Tax M22 was only defective in activating NF-&#x003ba;B unlike Tax 703, which was comparable to wild-type Tax for NF-&#x003ba;B activation but greatly affected in its capacity to activate both SRF and CREB (the latter being tested with the HTLV-I LTR-driven reporter construct mainly responsive to CREB activation). As Tax M22 was behaving as expected in the Jurkat T cell line, the two galectin-1 promoter constructs were next cotransfected with Tax WT or Tax M22 expression vectors along with pActin-LacZ into CEM-T4, Jurkat E6.1 and SupT1 T cell lines and promoter activity was then evaluated by luciferase activity after normalisation (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B, C</xref>). When compared to cells transfected with the control vector, the 0.5 kb galectin-1 promoter construct demonstrated an increase of 10- to 15-fold following expression of Tax WT while Tax M22 expression led to a modest 2 to 4-fold induction (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref>). For the 1.2 kb galectin-1 promoter construct, expression of TaxWT led to a 10- to 35-fold increase in promoter activity compared to 2 to 6 fold activation when the TaxM22 expression vector was transfected (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3C</xref>). These results suggested that the viral protein Tax upregulates transcription from the galectin-1 promoter region, which likely accounts for the observed increase in galectin-1 mRNA levels in both HTLV-I-infected cells and cells transfected with the Tax expression vector.</p><fig position="float" id="F3"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p><bold>Activation of the galectin-1 promoter by Tax expression in transfected T cell lines</bold>. <bold>A</bold>.

The use of HTLV-I gp46-pseudotyped virions that can express luciferase allows us to detect a single round of infection and although different from wild-type HTLV-I virions, it should be representative of the type of interactions and fusogenic activities of gp46 occurring on the surface of HTLV-I virions upon infection.

Lactose, an inhibitor of galectin-1, inhibited this galectin-1-promoting effect on HTLV-I infectivity, suggesting that the carbohydrate binding activity of this protein is involved in this increase.

This cell line model provided another useful system to assess the gp46-mediated fusion and was thus used to further confirm the results obtained with the gp46-pseudotyped virions. Our results had previously strongly suggested that this induction of luciferase activity could not be attributed to HTLV-I infection following cell-to-cell contact, but was rather involving cytoplasmic exchange likely mediated by the fusogenic capacity of gp46. Briefly, Jurkat E6.1 cells were transfected with pHTLV-Luc containing the HTLV-I LTR upstream of the luciferase gene and were subsequently co-cultured with the HTLV-I-infected cell line, C91-PL. Cytoplasmic exchange can then be estimated by assessing luciferase activity as Tax present in infected C91-PL cells should, upon cellular fusion, activate HTLV-I LTR activity in transfected Jurkat cells. This assay was thus tested in the presence of different amounts of galectin-1 (0&#x02013;4 &#x003bc;M) for 24 hours, after which luciferase activity was measured. A dose-dependent (and statistically significant at 4 &#x003bc;M; F = 4.192, p = 0.0466) increase in luciferase activity mediated by galectin-1 was noted (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6A</xref>). Again, this induction was lactose-sensitive. Of note, a small but non-significant effect of lactose was apparent in co-cultured cells which were not treated with galectin-1, suggesting a possible impact of endogenous galectin-1 in cell fusion affecting luciferase activity. As a control, supernatant from C91-PL cells incubated in the presence of transfected Jurkat cells did not lead to any significant increase in luciferase activity either in the absence or presence of galectin-1, thereby ruling out the effect of extracellular factors acting on HTLV-I LTR activity (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6B</xref>). In addition, although we cannot rule out a contribution in this signal from infection events by HTLV-I particles on Jurkat cells, which would similarly induce luciferase expression, previous experiments have suggested that the first 24-hour time course preferentially involves HTLV-I-driven syncytium formation in the modulation of luciferase assay [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B58">58</xref>].</p><fig position="float" id="F6"><label>Figure 6</label><caption><p><bold>Soluble galectin-1 increases the extent of HTLV-I LTR activation in co-culture assay</bold>.

Several studies have been conducted on the implication of adhesion molecules incorporated by retroviruses (especially for HIV-1) and their positive impact on viral replication [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B59">59</xref>]. Similar studies have revealed that cell surface adhesion molecules could affect the infection and syncytium formation related to HTLV-I [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B60">60</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B63">63</xref>]. In addition, certain studies have also indicated that soluble factors were also possible modulators of the HTLV-I infection process [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B64">64</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B65">65</xref>]. Galectins are a family of proteins involved in cell adhesion but few studies have been conducted on their possible involvement in viral infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B66">66</xref>]. In the present study, we have focused on galectin-1, mainly because of its capacity to mediate cell-to-cell contact but also because this protein is expressed by activated T cells and cells from lymphoid tissue, a major site of infection by HTLV-I.</p><p>In this study, we have demonstrated that galectin-1 is more strongly expressed and secreted in chronically HTLV-I-infected T cell lines compared to uninfected T cells. These results agree with the study of Pise-Masison and colleagues, which showed through DNA microarray experiments that galectin-1 gene expression is upregulated in HTLV-I-transformed and immortalized cell lines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. Furthermore, we have demonstrated that the viral Tax protein could be involved in the upregulation of galectin-1 expression. Generally, Tax directly activates gene transcription by the activation of CREB, NF-&#x003ba;B and/or SRF transcription factor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B67">67</xref>]. Using Tax mutants and known NF-&#x003ba;B activators, we have shown that CREB, SRF and NF-&#x003ba;B are not involved in Tax-induced galectin-1 expression. This was surprising given that the Tax mutant TaxM22, which is deficient for the activation of NF-&#x003ba;B, was less efficient in activating galectin-1 expression when compared to wild-type Tax. However, no typical NF-&#x003ba;B binding consensus sequences have been identified in the galectin-1 promoter region tested in this study. In this regard, it should be noted that Tax M22 has been demonstrated to be deficient for the activation of another transcription factor namely NFAT [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B68">68</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B69">69</xref>]. In addition, as the galectin-1 promoter has eight Sp1-potential sites in its 1.2 kbp region, six of which are shared with the 0.5 kbp region, Sp1 might be such a potential transcription factor. Indeed, it has been shown that Tax can interact with Sp1 and the resulting complex is important for the transactivation of PTHrP P3 and GATA3 promoters [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B70">70</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B71">71</xref>]. Alternatively, Tax may indirectly induce galectin-1 expression by maintaining a chronic activation of infected cells. In HTLV-I-infected cells, the constitutive expression of the LTR allows a weak expression of Tax. Since activated T lymphocytes express galectin-1, it may be possible that this chronic activation of HTLV-I-infected cells by Tax indirectly induces galectin-1 expression. Finally, although our results argue for an implication of Tax, it should be stated that other HTLV-I proteins might also participate in the modulation of galectin-1 expression in infected cells as elevated galectin-1 mRNA levels were detected in the S1T cell line, which poorly expresses Tax.</p><p>As cell-free virus has very low infectivity, it is assumed that HTLV-I infection is mediated by the interaction between non-infected and infected cells, although recent evidence has demonstrated that cell-free virus can infect isolated dendritic cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B72">72</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B74">74</xref>]. We have previously demonstrated that galectin-1 increases HIV-1 infectivity through stabilizing the virus adsorption step [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. In addition, galectin-1 may mediate cell-cell interaction as galectin-1 can cross-link cells. Using pseudotyped HIV-1 virions, which harbour HTLV-I gp46 envelope protein and express the luciferase reporter gene, we showed that, in both Jurkat and PBMCs, virion infection was significantly promoted in the presence of galectin-1 in a glycan binding-dependent manner, suggesting that galectin-1 increases the infectivity of HTLV-I virus particles in this system. We also used a quantitative system which mimics the mechanism involving gp46-mediated fusion in a cell-to-cell fashion. Again, galectin-1 increased this HTLV-I-induced gp46-mediated cell fusion showing that galectin-1 might also stabilize the interaction between infected and non-infected cells. Of note, no extracellular factors seemed to act upon galectin-1-mediated induction of HTLV-I LTR activity in this co-culture system as judged by results obtained with C91-PL supernatant. However, at this point, it cannot be dismissed that other possible gp46-independent cytoplasmic exchange modulated by galectin-1 might be taking place and lead to this upregulation of luciferase activity. Further experiments will be needed to assess this issue.</p><p>Although galectin-1 concentrations in our infection experiments were higher than the measured levels from the supernatant of infected cells, <italic>in vivo </italic>conditions are likely to differ from our cell culture settings. Previous studies have demonstrated that lymphoid organ tissues are sites where an important number of infected T lymphocytes are located [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B75">75</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B77">77</xref>]. Given that these tissues represent a more confined space, the concentration of galectin-1 secreted by surrounding infected cells may represent a more appropriate environment and increase the concentration of galectin-1 to effective levels. Indeed, we have previously reported that the tonsil tissue contains 10 to 20 &#x003bc;M galectin-1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. Moreover, the transmission of HTLV-I to target cells has been shown to require the formation of a virological synapse following a cell-cell contact [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. This synapse is formed by the binding of host molecules between the HTLV-I-infected T cells and the uninfected T lymphocytes, thereby facilitating virus transmission. Galectin-1 may be concentrated in the vicinity of this virological synapse and more favourably act upon infection. A final issue which needs to be taken into consideration in the current study relates to breast feeding, an important route for HTLV-I transmission. Lactose is an important constituent of breast milk and therefore could be suggested to hinder the action of galectin-1 during this route of HTLV-I transmission. Although one might then argue that galectin-1 is less important for this mode of transmission, it remains to be determined whether high lactose concentrations are also present at sites where initial HTLV-I infection does occur following HTLV-I transmission during breast feeding and where galectin-1 could modulate HTLV-I binding.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>In summary, our study demonstrates a bidirectional interaction between HTLV-I and galectin-1. The data demonstrated that expression of galectin-1 was increased in chronically HTLV-I-infected cells and that this modulation of galectin-1 expression was largely attributed to the viral transactivator Tax in NF-&#x003ba;B- and CREB-independent manners. In addition, this study showed that HTLV-I-infected cells secrete galectin-1 at a higher level than the uninfected cells and that extracellular galectin-1 facilitates HTLV-I infection and promotes higher levels of gp46-dependent cell fusion. Given that our previous studies had demonstrated that HIV-1 is also enhanced in its infectivity by galectin-1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>], other retroviruses (or even other enveloped viruses) could potentially be more infectious in the presence of galectin-1. Further studies will be needed to assess the possible universal action of this &#x003b2;-galactoside-binding protein on the replicative cycle of various pathogens.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>SG carried all RT-PCR analyses, transfection experiments and infection and syncytium formation assay and has drafted the manuscript.
