We have studied mice carrying two null alleles for SirT1, the mammalian orthologue of sir2, and found that these animals inefficiently utilize ingested food. These mice are hypermetabolic, contain inefficient liver mitochondria, and have elevated rates of lipid oxidation. When challenged with a 40&#x00025; reduction in caloric intake, normal mice maintained their metabolic rate and increased their physical activity while the metabolic rate of SirT1-null mice dropped and their activity did not increase. Moreover, CR did not extend lifespan of SirT1-null mice. Thus, SirT1 is an important regulator of energy metabolism and, like its orthologues from simpler eukaryotes, the SirT1 protein appears to be required for a normal response to caloric restriction.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="12"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Silent information regulator 2 (sir2) is a yeast gene encoding a nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>)-dependent histone deacetylase <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001759-Imai1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001759-Landry1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>.

Mitochondria were subjected to three different substrates (succinate, pyruvate&#x0002b;malate or palmitoylcarnitine) in the presence of antimycin so that H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> would be produced predominantly from complex III in all conditions. Succinate feeds into complex II directly, so the H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> produced using this substrate is not affected by the capacity of any pathways upstream of the ETC to provide RE. Mitochondria from both normal and SirT1-null liver produced similar levels of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> under this condition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001759-g006">Figure 6E</xref>). On the other hand, pyruvate&#x0002b;malate and palmitoylcarnitine first need to be oxidized through beta-oxidation and/or the TCA cycle, so the H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> produced using these substrates is affected by the capacity of these upstream pathways to provide reducing equivalents to the ETC. SirT1-null mitochondria produced higher levels of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> when using pyruvate&#x0002b;malate or palmitoylcarnitine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001759-g006">Figure 6E</xref>), suggesting that SirT1-null mitochondria have higher than normal beta-oxidation and TCA cycle capacities.

Our observations with SirT1-null liver mitochondria suggest that they are less efficient than normal in producing ATP.

In fact, our observations suggest that SirT1 is an important regulator of metabolic activity because SirT1-null mice utilize ingested calories inefficiently and because SirT1-null mice do not adapt normally to CR or to fasting.</p><p>SirT1-null mice are smaller and lethargic compared to their normal littermates but, per gram of body weight, they consume more food and oxygen. Thus, the SirT1-null animal is metabolically inefficient compared to normal. Liver mitochondria appear to have a lower capacity to produce ATP because of lower state 3 respiration capacity and higher proton leak through the inner mitochondrial membrane. Perhaps to compensate for their reduced oxidative phosphorylation capacity, mitochondria from SirT1-null liver have increased capacity for TCA cycle and beta-oxidation. This compensation seems to be successful in maintaining the level of ATP but overnight fasting resulted in much higher levels of phospho-AMPK suggesting that ATP levels are not sustained in SirT1-null mice in the face of food deprivation.</p><p>SirT1 is known to modulate the activities of several regulators of metabolism but an examination of the characteristics of the SirT1-null mouse and the expectations based on published studies yields a number of unexpected contradictions. As a negative regulator of PPAR&#x003b3;, SirT1 decreases transcription of genes involved in fat storage <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001759-Picard1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref> so the SirT1-null mice would be expected to have increased WAT depots; in fact WAT is reduced in these mice.

This does not seem to be the case as determined by measurements of the mitochondrial DNA copy number. Recent reports have indicated that SirT1 regulates insulin signaling either directly by deacetylation of IRS2 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001759-Zhang1">&#x0005b;29&#x0005d;</xref> or indirectly by derepressing PTP1B <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001759-Sun1">&#x0005b;30&#x0005d;</xref>. Both mechanisms would predict that SirT1-null mice should be insulin resistant. We found that the SirT1-null animals showed normal insulin-dependent glucose regulation. SirT1 is reported to be required for the switch from glucose to lipid oxidation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001759-GerhartHines1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref> but SirT1-null mice had no difficulty in making this switch; in fact, these animals had a higher level of lipid oxidation under AL feeding conditions. Because SIRT1 is expressed in all tissues it is difficult to extrapolate information obtained from isolated cells and organs to accurately make predictions regarding the intact animal.</p><p>The means by which CR extends lifespan is not yet clear. In yeast and <italic>D. melanogaster</italic>, Sir2 has been shown to be required for CR to increase lifespan <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001759-Rogina1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001759-Lin1">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref>. Here we show that SirT1 is also required in mammals for some responses to CR.

Second, we show that, whereas normal mice maintain their metabolic rate when subject to CR, that of the mutant mice drops dramatically. Finally, SirT1 appears to be required for CR to increase lifespan. The beneficial effects of CR on lifespan of normal mice is typically observed after 20 months of age (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001759-Bartke1">&#x0005b;31&#x0005d;</xref>). Because our CR experiment was terminated before animals reached this age, we saw no difference in survival between our CR and AL groups of normal mice. However, we had already lost two-thirds of our SirT1-null mice by the end of this experiment and CR had no obvious beneficial effect on lifespan of these mice. In fact, CR seemed to augment the early demise of SirT1-null mice. We interpret our data to indicate that SirT1-null mice are not capable of adapting to CR conditions.</p><p>Lifespan is thought to be determined by the accumulation of cellular damage arising from ROS although recent evidence from C. elegans suggests that ROS might in fact be responsible for extending lifespan (Schulz et al., 2007). It is perhaps relevant that SirT1-null mice have liver mitochondria that produce less ROS than normal. In regards to mitochondrial uncoupling, this observation is consistent with increased proton leak in these mitochondria; however, the increased leak is not due to a derepression of ucp2, as one could infer from studies in pancreatic beta-cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001759-Bordone1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>.

At this point, it is not yet clear which of the many SIRT1 substrates is/are responsible for the phenotype or which tissue(s) share the metabolic defect. A better understanding of the role of SirT1 in energy metabolism may help in designing strategies to provide the health benefits of CR without curtailing dietary energy intake.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Animals</title><p>All animal experiments were performed according to the Guidelines for the Care and Use of Animals established by the Canadian Council on Animal Care.

Daily food intake of mice was determined for several weeks and averaged by genotype. Mice were adapted to the food for at least 1 month before CR started. SirT1 mutant mice and controls were assigned to AL or CR. Cohorts were matched for sex and litter when possible. Mice from CR groups were given 60&#x00025; of average daily food intake of their corresponding genotype and mice from AL were given food unrestricted or 95&#x00025; of average to prevent obesity. Age of mice was between 5 and 7 months when CR started and the diet was sustained for up to 44 weeks.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors would like to thank the following people for allowing us to use materials: Alexander McKenzie for his Micromax activity monitoring system and Christopher Kennedy for his metabolic chambers.
