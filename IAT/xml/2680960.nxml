Antigen endocytosed via CD205 enters the MHC class I and MHC class II antigen presentation pathways and is subsequently presented to both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. Despite the known role of CD205 in antigen uptake, the nature of the ligands bound by CD205 has not been determined, and most studies have relied on the use of monoclonal antibodies as surrogate ligands. To go beyond this approach, we created a panel of CD205&#x02013;IgG fusion proteins spanning the extracellular portion of CD205 and used these to identify the physiological distribution of CD205 ligands. Our data demonstrate that two areas of the CD205 molecule, within C-type lectin-like domains (CTLDs) 3&#x000a0;+&#x000a0;4 and 9&#x000a0;+&#x000a0;10, recognise ligands expressed during apoptosis and necrosis of multiple cell types, and are additionally expressed by live cells of the dendritic cell line DC2.4. Thus, CD205 acts as a recognition receptor for dying cells, potentially providing an important pathway for the uptake of self-antigen in intrathymic and peripheral tolerance.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Dendritic cells</kwd><kwd>Apoptosis</kwd><kwd>CD205</kwd><kwd>DEC-205</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec><label>1</label><title>Introduction</title><p>CD205 is an endocytic type I C-type lectin-like molecule consisting of a single polypeptide chain; the extracellular portion contains an N-terminal cysteine-rich domain (CyR)<xref rid="fn1" ref-type="fn">1</xref>, a fibronectin type II domain (FnII), and 10 domains structurally (although not necessarily functionally) resembling C-type lectin domains (C-type lectin-like domains, CTLDs) (<xref rid="bib11 bib24 bib31" ref-type="bibr">East and Isacke, 2002; Jiang et al., 1995; McKay et al., 1998</xref>). This structure places CD205 in the Mannose Receptor (MR) family (<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">East and Isacke, 2002</xref>). The MR itself has been well characterised, and contains two distinct ligand binding sites; CTLD4 is a true C-type lectin that binds terminal mannose, fucose, <italic>N</italic>-acetylglucosamine and glucose (<xref rid="bib44" ref-type="bibr">Taylor et al., 1992</xref>), whereas the CyR is a lectin that binds terminal sulphated GalNAc-4-SO4 (<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">Fiete et al., 1998</xref>). Although structurally related, CD205 does not contain the conserved residues required for lectin and C-type lectin binding (<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">East and Isacke, 2002</xref>), and the ligands bound by CD205 have remained elusive.</p><p>The roles of CD205 in antigen uptake, processing and presentation have however been well characterised. CD205 is expressed at high levels on cortical thymic epithelium, thymic medullary DCs (CD11c+ CD8+), and subsets of peripheral DCs (CD11c+ CD8+ splenic/lymph node DCs, dermal/interstitial DCs, and Langerhans cells) (<xref rid="bib19 bib24" ref-type="bibr">Heath et al., 2004; Jiang et al., 1995</xref>). Studies of CD205 function have mostly relied on the use of monoclonal antibodies as surrogate ligands, and have demonstrated that when antigen is targeted to DCs by conjugation to an anti-CD205 antibody, the antigen is endocytosed, processed, and presented on both MHC class II and MHC class I molecules (cross-presentation) with high efficiency (<xref rid="bib6 bib28" ref-type="bibr">Bonifaz et al., 2002; Mahnke et al., 2000</xref>). The recycling properties of CD205 are responsible for this effect, which are in turn guided by motifs within the intracellular tail of CD205. A tyrosine containing FSSVRY motif is responsible for initial clathrin-coated pit-mediated endocytosis, while an acidic EDE triad motif targets CD205 to late endosomes/early lysosomes, allowing endocytosed antigen to reach the MHC class II loading machinery (<xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">Mahnke et al., 2000</xref>).</p><p>The ability of CD205 to deliver antigen to DCs for presentation on MHC class II and cross-presentation on class I has generated much interest in the use of anti-CD205-antigen conjugates as therapeutic reagents. When antigen is delivered to DCs <italic>in vivo</italic> via CD205 without an inflammatory stimulus, tolerance to the antigen is induced (<xref rid="bib6 bib18" ref-type="bibr">Bonifaz et al., 2002; Hawiger et al., 2001</xref>). This occurs by inducing deletion and unresponsiveness (anergy) in antigen specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cell populations, and the induction of regulatory T cell subsets (<xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">Mahnke et al., 2003</xref>). CD205 is therefore an attractive target for tolerisation to autoantigens, and has been used to this effect to prevent the onset of diabetes in a mouse model (<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">Bruder et al., 2005</xref>). Conversely when a maturational stimulus is co-administered with CD205-targeted antigen, long-lived immunity via antigen-specific CD4 and CD8 T cells results (<xref rid="bib6 bib7 bib18" ref-type="bibr">Bonifaz et al., 2002, 2004; Hawiger et al., 2001</xref>). This has resulted in successful vaccination against HIV gag-antigens and cancer antigens in murine disease models (<xref rid="bib8 bib29 bib46" ref-type="bibr">Bozzacco et al., 2007; Mahnke et al., 2005; Trumpfheller et al., 2006</xref>).</p><p>It has thus become clear that CD205 plays an important role in antigen uptake for presentation and cross-presentation to T cells; indeed, because antigen uptake via CD205 in the steady-state results in tolerance, this suggests that CD205 plays an important role in CD4 and CD8 T cell tolerance induction to self-antigen both in the periphery and in the thymus (<xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">Jiang et al., 1995</xref>). Given that CD205 can deliver antigens to the cross-presentation pathway, and that CD11c+ CD8+ CD205+ DCs are specialised for the cross-presentation of apoptotic cell-derived antigens (<xref rid="bib19 bib23 bib27 bib42" ref-type="bibr">Heath et al., 2004; Iyoda et al., 2002; Liu et al., 2002; Steinman et al., 2000</xref>), we hypothesised that CD205 may act as a recognition receptor for the uptake of &#x02018;self&#x02019; in the form of apoptotic cells. To test this hypothesis, we constructed a panel of CD205&#x02013;IgG fusion proteins spanning the extracellular domains of the molecule. These fusion proteins were used to test whether CD205 could bind apoptotic cells, and to identify the regions of the molecule responsible for such ligand binding. Our data demonstrate that CD205 does indeed recognise cells that are undergoing apoptosis and necrosis, and that CD205 ligands are additionally expressed by live cells of the cloned DC cell line DC2.4. Thus, CD205 may provide a mechanism for uptake and presentation of self-antigens for intrathymic and peripheral tolerance induction.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1"><label>2</label><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><label>2.1</label><title>Animals</title><p>Male and female C57BL/6 and BALB/c mice were purchased from Harlan and maintained in the Biological Services Unit at the Hammersmith Campus of Imperial College London.

Unbound/unengulfed thymcoytes were excluded from analysis on the basis of size.</p></sec></sec><sec><label>3</label><title>Results</title><p>We created a panel of six CD205&#x02013;IgG fusion proteins, depicted in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>&#x02014;the CyR and FnII domains paired together (CyRFnII-IgG), and the remaining CTLDs cloned as pairs (CTLD1+2-IgG, CTLD3+4-IgG, CTLD5+6-IgG, CTLD7+8-IgG, and CTLD9+10-IgG). cDNA encoding these domains was amplified from thymic epithelial cell cDNA, by PCR using primers with flanking restriction enzyme sites. The PCR products were inserted into the signal PIG plus vector MCS using these restriction sites; this fused the CD205 domains to a human IgG1 tail and the CD33 signal sequence. The six fusion protein plasmids, plus the empty signal PIG plus vector (pIgG), were used to transfect CHO cells. The fusion proteins were secreted in the culture supernatant, which could either be used directly in flow cytometry experiments, or could be purified via the IgG tail by protein-A affinity chromatography.</p><p>We used the CD205&#x02013;IgG fusion protein panel in a flow cytometry assay to detect the binding of individual panel members to live and apoptotic thymocytes. Thymocytes were used as a model of apoptosis for two reasons; firstly, they are extremely sensitive and undergo apoptotic cell death in response to a wide range of stimuli. Secondly, the thymus itself is a site of high CD205 expression, with the cortical thymic epithelium and medullary DCs expressing CD205 (<xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">Jiang et al., 1995</xref>). We therefore reasoned that developing thymocytes in contact with the cortical epithelium and medullary DCs express CD205 ligands. We compared the ability of the fusion protein panel to stain untreated, freshly isolated thymocytes, and thymocytes that had been induced to undergo apoptosis by incubation for 16&#x000a0;h with dexamethasone. As seen in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>, none of the CD205&#x02013;IgG fusion proteins were able to bind live thymocytes (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>A). However, CTLD3+4-IgG and CTLD9+10-IgG were able to bind apoptotic thymocytes (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>B). The interaction of these fusion proteins with their cognate ligand(s) occurs with low affinity, as paraformaldehyde fixation is required to detect the interaction (described in Section <xref rid="sec1" ref-type="sec">2</xref>). No binding was seen with the other CD205&#x02013;IgG fusion proteins, or with the pIgG control.</p><p>Having established that CTLD3+4-IgG and CTLD9+10-IgG were the only two proteins able to mediate ligand binding, we reduced our reagent panel to these two binding proteins plus a non-binding control region, CTLD1+2-IgG. We then examined whether the expression of CD205 ligand(s) was induced solely by dexamethasone, or whether other pro-apoptotic and pro-necrotic stimuli could induce expression (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>). Thymocytes were cultured for 24&#x000a0;h at 4&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C to prevent cell death (A), at 37&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C with no additional treatment (B), and with 1&#x000a0;&#x003bc;M dexamethasone (C) or 1&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g/mL anti-Fas antibody (D). All of these stimuli were able to induce both apoptosis and CD205 ligand expression. Furthermore, heating thymocytes at 56&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C for 30&#x000a0;min to induce primary unscheduled necrosis also resulted in the expression of CD205 ligands (E). This demonstrated that the expression of CD205 ligand(s) was a general feature of thymocyte death, rather than a phenomenon specifically induced by steroid treatment. Interestingly, the proportion of cells bound by CTLD3+4-IgG and CTLD9+10-IgG appeared to correlate with the proportion of annexin-V-binding cells.</p><p>Next, we examined whether de novo synthesis of proteins is required for CD205-ligand expression during apoptotic cell death. Thymocytes were incubated for 24&#x000a0;h with medium alone, 1&#x000a0;&#x003bc;M dexamethasone, or 1&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g/mL anti-Fas antibody, both in the presence and absence of 30&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g/mL cyclohexamide to inhibit protein synthesis. The thymocytes were stained with annexin-V and 7-amino-actinomycin D (7-AAD) and analysed by flow cytometry to quantify the proportion of cells undergoing apoptosis. As seen in <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>A, cyclohexamide inhibited the ability of dexamethasone to induce apoptosis. This is expected, as dexamethasone is a steroid that requires gene transcription and translation to induce apoptosis. However, cyclohexamide was not able to inhibit the progression of apoptosis induced by ligation of the Fas molecule on thymocytes. We therefore examined the binding of CD205&#x02013;IgGs to anti-Fas treated cells more closely, using a triple-stain technique.</p><p>Fas-treated thymocytes were stained with annexin-V and 7-AAD, and then stained with CTLD3+4-IgG or CTLD9+10-IgG and fixed with paraformaldehyde. The bound CD205&#x02013;IgGs were detected with FITC-conjugated secondary reagents, and analysed by flow cytometry (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>B). Live thymocytes (annexin-V<sup>&#x02212;</sup> 7-AAD<sup>&#x02212;</sup>) were weakly bound by CTLD3+4-IgG, and were not bound by CTLD9+10-IgG. Early apoptotic cells (appearing as annexin-V<sup>+</sup> 7-AAD<sup>lo</sup> cells in the triple stain where paraformaldehyde fixation is used, and as annexin-V<sup>+</sup> 7-AAD<sup>&#x02212;</sup> cells in the double stain where fixation is not carried out) were bound by both CTLD3+4-IgG and CTLD9+10-IgG (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>B); both fusion proteins were able to bind more strongly still to the late apoptotic/secondary necrotic population (annexin-V<sup>+</sup> 7-AAD<sup>hi</sup>). This, together with the data presented in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref> demonstrates that CD205 is able to bind early apoptotic, late apoptotic/secondary necrotic, and primary necrotic thymocytes; thus CD205 binds ligand(s) expressed during both necrotic and apoptotic cell death. Thymocytes treated with both anti-Fas antibody and cyclohexamide had progressed further through apoptosis than when treated with anti-Fas antibody alone (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>C)<italic>.</italic> However, the level of CTLD3+4-IgG and CTLD9+10-IgG binding to the primary apoptotic and secondary necrotic thymocyte populations is equivalent to that seen without cyclohexamide treatment. This clearly demonstrated that the expression of CD205 ligand(s) at the surface of apoptotic/necrotic cells did not require <italic>de novo</italic> protein synthesis.</p><p>We next looked at whether CTLD3+4-IgG and CTLD9+10-IgG could bind dying cells from other cell lineages. We induced primary necrosis in A20 B cells and F1 thymic epithelial cells by heating to 56&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C for 30&#x000a0;min. Both of these cell lines were specifically bound in their necrotic state by CTLD3+4-IgG and CTLD9+10-IgG (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>A and B). This demonstrated that the expression of CD205 ligand(s) during cell death was a multilineage phenomenon, and one that occurs both within the thymus and the periphery. However when we stained the immortalised DC cell line DC2.4 we found that both live <italic>and</italic> necrotic cells were bound by CTLD3+4-IgG and CTLD9+10-IgG (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>C). This was surprising, as no other cells tested had expressed CD205 ligand(s) when in a live, non-apoptotic/non-necrotic state. Staining of the JAWSII immortalised APC line demonstrated that this too expresses CD205 ligand(s) when live and non-apoptotic (data not shown), indicating that the expression of CD205 ligand(s) on live cells may be a feature of professional phagocytes. We next treated DC2.4 cells with trypsin prior to staining with CD205&#x02013;IgGs, to test whether trypsin-sensitive proteins are involved in the recognition of ligands by CD205. As seen in <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>D, CTLD3+4-IgG and CTLD9+10-IgG bind a trypsin-sensitive ligand(s) on DC2.4 cells.</p><p>Having demonstrated that CTLD3+4-IgG and CTLD9+10-IgG are capable of binding dying thymocytes (and indeed other cell types), we investigated whether these CD205&#x02013;IgGs could block the uptake of apoptotic cells by the CD205-expressing cortical thymic epithelial cell line, YO1 (<xref rid="bib48" ref-type="bibr">Williams et al., 1996</xref>). The cell line is conditionally immortalised at 33&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C by a temperature-sensitive SV40 T antigen gene under the control of the MHC H-2Kb promoter, and can be incubated at 37&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C prior to experiments to provide a more physiologically representative cortical thymic epithelial cell. Although CD205 is endocytic on immature DCs, we have recently demonstrated that this is not the case on mature DCs (<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">Butler et al., 2007</xref>). We therefore tested whether CD205 is endocytic on cortical thymic epithelial cells. YO1 cells were moved to 37&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C for three days, and then incubated with anti-CD205 antibody or anti-ICAM-1 antibody at 37&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C. The cells were washed, fixed, and permeablised, and antibody staining was detected using TRITC-conjugated secondary reagents. As seen in <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>A, the non-endocytic cell surface molecule ICAM-1 remains at the surface of the YO1 cell, whereas CD205 is endocytosed and localises to the perinuclear region of the cell. This demonstrates that CD205 is indeed endocytic on cortical thymic epithelium.</p><p>Next, we incubated dexamethasone-treated CFSE-labelled thymocytes with YO1 cells in the presence of CD205&#x02013;IgGs for 16&#x000a0;h at 37&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C, before washing the free thymocytes from the YO1 cells and analysing by flow cytometry. As seen in <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>B, CTLD3+4-IgG and CTLD9+10-IgG were unable to block the uptake of apoptotic thymocytes by YO1 cells. However, the YO1 line itself did not show a high level of phagocytic activity. We therefore tested the ability of CD205&#x02013;IgGs to block phagocytosis by BMDCs, which express CD205 and are known to phagocytose apoptotic cells and present apoptotic cell-derived antigens on MHC class II (<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">Inaba et al., 1995</xref>). As seen in <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>C, our CD205&#x02013;IgG constructs were unable to block the uptake of apoptotic thymocytes by BMDCs, or the immortalised JAWS II APC line (data not shown).</p></sec><sec><label>4</label><title>Discussion</title><p>In this study, we have used a panel of CD205&#x02013;IgG fusion proteins to determine the distribution of CD205 ligands on murine cells. We show that CTLDs 3+ 4 and 9+ 10 are able to bind cells in two different situations; whereas the cloned DC/APC cell lines DC2.4 and JAWSII (data not shown) express CD205 ligand(s) when live, thymocytes, B cells and cortical thymic epithelial cells only expressed CD205 ligand(s) when undergoing apoptosis and necrosis. Our data therefore suggest that CD205 acts as a recognition receptor for dying cells from multiple cell lineages, and hence may participate in the recognition of apoptotic cells during the uptake and subsequent presentation of apoptotic cell-derived self-antigens, thus playing a key role in the development of immunological tolerance.</p><p>In phagocytic cell systems, the recognition and engulfment of apoptotic cells is known to involve the engagement of a broad spectrum of recognition receptors at the surface of the phagocyte recognising changes at the surface of the apoptotic cell (<xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">Lauber et al., 2004</xref>). Early in apoptosis, phoshpatidylserine (PS) is externalised from the interior of the phospholipid bilayer, and is recognised by the receptor/bridging molecule pairs PS Receptor/annexin I (<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">Arur et al., 2003</xref>), &#x003b2;2-glycoprotein-I receptor/&#x003b2;2-glycoprotein-I (<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">Balasubramanian et al., 1997</xref>), Mer/growth arrest specific-6 (Gas6) (<xref rid="bib22 bib38" ref-type="bibr">Ishimoto et al., 2000; Scott et al., 2001</xref>), and &#x003b1;v&#x003b2;3/5 integrins/milk-fat globule-EGF-factor 8 (MFG-E8) (<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">Hanayama et al., 2002</xref>). Oxidised lipids are recognised by scavenger receptors (SRs) such as SR-A (<xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">Platt et al., 1996</xref>), lectin-like oxLDL-receptor I (LOX1) (<xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">Oka et al., 1998</xref>), and CD36 (<xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">Ren et al., 1995</xref>) (which also forms a bridged recognition system with thrombospoindin-1 and &#x003b1;v&#x003b2;3/5 integrins (<xref rid="bib36 bib35" ref-type="bibr">Savill et al., 1992; Rubartelli et al., 1997</xref>)). Altered sugar residues on apoptotic cells are bound by mannose binding lectin (MBL), surfactant proteins A/D, and C1q. These are in turn bound by the CD91/calreticulin (CRT) complex on phagocytes (<xref rid="bib47" ref-type="bibr">Vandivier et al., 2002</xref>). CRT is also translocated to the surface of apoptotic cells, and is bound by LDL-receptor-related protein (LRP) on the phagocyte (<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">Gardai et al., 2005</xref>). Our data indicate that CD205 may contribute to this diverse, redundant system of apoptotic cell recognition.</p><p>It was initially surprising to find that two different CTLD domain-pairs have ligand binding activity, as the other members of the MR-family contain only one CTLD domain that is primarily responsible for ligand binding, although flanking CTLDs can provide increased binding avidity (<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">East and Isacke, 2002</xref>). However CD205 is unusual within the family as it contains 10 rather than 8 CTLDs, and our data suggest that these extra domains (CTLD9+10 are a duplication of CTLD7+8 (<xref rid="bib43" ref-type="bibr">Taylor, 1997</xref>)) do play a functional role in ligand binding. It is unlikely that both of the CTLDs within each domain pair mediate ligand binding; however due to the nature of our CD205&#x02013;IgG domain-pair library the exact domain responsible for binding in each case has not been determined. Since CTLD3+4-IgG staining is consistently higher than CTLD9+10-IgG staining, this suggests that CTLD3+4-IgG and CTLD9+10-IgG may either bind distinct ligands or the same ligand with different affinities.</p><p>The finding that the proportion of cells expressing CD205 ligands was higher in secondary apoptotic/necrotic cells (annexin-V<sup>+</sup> 7-AAD<sup>hi</sup>) than in primary apoptotic populations (annexin-V<sup>+</sup> 7-AAD<sup>lo</sup>) suggests that progression of cells through death pathways results in the accumulation of CD205 ligand(s) at the surface of the dying cell. Furthermore, ligand expression during cell death does not require <italic>de novo</italic> protein synthesis. Taken together, these data suggest that CD205 ligand(s) may be translocated from the interior to the exterior of the cell during apoptosis. This is indeed the case for other molecules upregulated during apoptosis such as PS. Additionally, protein molecules normally resident within the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), such as calreticulin, calnexin, KDEL receptor, and the cellular heat shock proteins HSP-70 and HSP-90 are translocated to the surface of apoptotic cells (<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">Franz et al., 2007</xref>). Calreticulin is additionally expressed at the surface of phagocytes (<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">Gardai et al., 2005</xref>), a situation that mirrors our finding that CD205 ligand(s) are expressed by live DC2.4 cells.</p><p>Using live DC2.4 cells, we were able to demonstrate that the ligand(s) bound by CD205 are trypsin-sensitive and thus involves proteins. This could either be by the direct recognition of a protein on the apoptotic cell, or the indirect recognition via a protein bridging molecule. However, we have not been able to identify the ligands bound by CTLD3+4-IgG and CTLD9+10-IgG, as attempts to purify the ligands from either DCs or apoptotic/necrotic cells were unsuccessful (data not shown). This is likely to be due to the low affinity of the domain-pairs for their ligands, illustrated by the fact that staining could only be revealed following fixation with paraformaldehyde. This may be an inherent feature of the native CD205 molecule, or may be because the whole backbone of 10 CTLDs is required for maximal binding avidity. Indeed, the related MR is able to bind ligands through the CTLD4 region, but CTLDs4&#x02013;8 are required for maximal binding to yeast mannan (<xref rid="bib45" ref-type="bibr">Taylor and Drickamer, 1993</xref>). Furthermore, our CTLD3+4-IgG and CTLD9+10-IgG fusion proteins were unable to block the uptake of apoptotic cells by BMDCs or YO1 cortical thymic epithelial cells. Although this may be due to functional redundancy between phagocytic receptors (CD205, CD36 and &#x003b2;5-integrin knockout mice <italic>all</italic> show no defects in apoptotic cell uptake and antigen presentation (<xref rid="bib23 bib37" ref-type="bibr">Iyoda et al., 2002; Schulz et al., 2002</xref>)), it is more likely that our fusion protein dimers do not have sufficient affinity for their ligands to compete with multivalent CD205 on the phagocyte surface.</p><p>Out data differ from those of <xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr">Small and Kraal (2003)</xref>, who showed blocking of apoptotic thymocyte uptake by the antibody NLDC-145. In our hands, NLDC-145 did not block the uptake of apoptotic thymocytes by either YO1 cells or BMDCs (data not shown). Moreover, NLDC-145 binds an epitope within the CyRFnII region of the molecule, and our data with CD205&#x02013;IgG fusion proteins have shown that this region of CD205 does not play a role in binding of apoptotic cells. It is however possible that our BMDCs and the YO1 cell line rely on different receptors for cell uptake compared to the BA/10 cell line used by Small and Kraal.</p><p>The exact role of CD205 in apoptotic cell recognition and uptake remains to be fully elucidated. It is unlikely that CD205 itself engages the phagocytic machinery required for cell engulfment; indeed CD205 is expressed by non-phagocytic cell types such as T cells (<xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">Kato et al., 2006</xref>). It is more likely that CD205 forms part of a recognition synapse with other receptors capable of engaging the phagocytic machinery, such as PS-receptor (<xref rid="bib40" ref-type="bibr">Somersan and Bhardwaj, 2001</xref>). CD205 may play a role in guiding the intracellular trafficking of phagosomes to late endosomes, due to the EDE targeting motif in its intracellular tail (<xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">Mahnke et al., 2000</xref>). The ability of CD205 to bind apoptotic cells may act to include the molecule within the phagosome, rather than dictating the formation of the phagosome itself. CD205 may additionally mediate the uptake of smaller vesicular structures such as apoptotic blebs; characterisation of the ligands bound by CD205 would allow a more comprehensive view of its physiological roles.</p><p>The uptake of dying cells by CD11c+ CD8+ CD205+ DCs and the subsequent presentation and cross-presentation of antigens to CD4+ and CD8+ T cells is of crucial importance in both the induction of immunity to intracellular viral pathogens, and the induction and maintenance of tolerance to self-antigens (<xref rid="bib4 bib5 bib19" ref-type="bibr">Belz et al., 2002c, 2004; Heath et al., 2004</xref>). Our study has demonstrated that CD205 acts as a recognition receptor for dying cells. As such, CD205 is likely to be an important molecule in the induction and tolerance to self both intrathymically and within the periphery. Within the thymus, CD205 may aid the recognition and processing of dying cells by cortical thymic epithelium, and therefore influence the acquisition and presentation of antigens for positive selection (<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">Anderson et al., 1999</xref>). It may additionally contribute to the phenomenon of &#x0201c;antigen spreading&#x0201d; in the thymus, whereby medullary dendritic cells are able to acquire peripheral antigens expressed by medullary epithelial cells, possibly by the engulfment of apoptotic bodies or exosomes (<xref rid="bib14 bib16" ref-type="bibr">Gallegos and Bevan, 2004; Gray et al., 2007</xref>). This leads to efficient deletion of autoreactive T cell clones by DCs. Within the periphery, CD205-mediated acquisition of apoptotic/necrotic material has the potential to influence both peripheral tolerance and immunity.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgement</title><p>This work was funded by the Wellcome Trust.</p></ack><fn-group><fn id="fn1"><label>1</label><p>Abbreviations used: MR, mannose receptor; PLA2R, phospholipase A2 receptor; CyR, cysteine-rich domain; FnII, fibronectin type II domain; CTLD, C-type lectin like domain; CM, culture medium; PS, phosphatidylserine; 7-AAD, 7-amino-actinomycin D; APC, allophycocyanin.</p></fn></fn-group><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="bib1"><citation citation-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Anderson</surname><given-names>G.</given-names></name><name><surname>Hare</surname><given-names>K.J.</given-names></name><name><surname>Jenkinson</surname><given-names>E.J.</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Positive selection of thymocytes: the long and winding road</article-title><source>Immunol.

The extracellular domains of the CD205 molecule were cloned as pairs into the signal PIG plus vector, creating a panel of six CD205-IgG fusion proteins. (B) Three types of protein were produced by expression in mammalian cell lines&#x02014;the CyRFnII-IgG, five pairs of CTLD-IgG fusion proteins, and the signal PIG plus vector IgG1 tail (pIgG) as a control IgG (from expressing the empty vector).
