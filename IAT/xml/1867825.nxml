Achondroplasia (short-limbed dwarfism) is the most common cause of human dwarfism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>], and it accounts for 70% of dwarfism cases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>] To explore causative genetic factor(s) for the development of achondroplasia in animal models, we focused on a novel spontaneous model of long bone abnormality called <italic>lbab </italic>mouse, which was originally found in the PL/J strain at The Jackson Laboratory (TJL)[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. Homozygous mutants exhibit proportionate dwarfing of all organs and shorter long bones. The mutation has been transferred to the C57BL/6J strain to improve reproduction. The genetic locus responsible for the phenotype has previously been mapped to chromosome 1 (Chr 1) between markers <italic>D1Mit9 </italic>and <italic>D1Mit488 </italic>(53.5 cM) at TJL [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>], but the responsible gene and the nature of mutation remained unclear.</p><p>Disease gene hunting has always been time-consuming and labor-intensive. For successful map-based cloning, a complicated fine mapping of a major locus is generally essential [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. Recently, we developed an alternative, sequence-based, positional candidate cloning approach to bypass this bottleneck of cloning, and we have successfully identified several mutated genes in different mouse spontaneous mutants by applying this strategy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. Our strategy takes advantage of the availability of comprehensive murine sequence databases, polymerase chain reaction (PCR), high throughout PCR product analysis, and sequencing technologies to speed up the process of disease-related gene hunting. Interestingly, we identified a nucleotide mutation (C&#x02192;G transversion) in gene <italic>Nppc </italic>in the <italic>lbab </italic>mice. Herein, we describe the detailed process of our cloning and validation.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Body growth of <italic>lbab/lbab </italic>mice</title><p>All <italic>lbab/lbab </italic>mice housed at the University of Tennessee Health Science Center died before 7 days of age with remarkable changes in organ weight and body size (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>, Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>).

Using another panel of primers (n = 240 pairs) for PCR amplification of every exon of all candidate genes, we identified only one DNA fragment from <italic>lbab/lbab </italic>mice that was different from PL/J mice DNA. This fragment was from exon 2 of the gene ENSMUSG00000026241, representing the gene for natriuretic peptide precursor C (<italic>Nppc</italic>). The same pair of primers for this fragment was used for further genotyping as indicated in material and methods.</p><p>Because we used PL/J mice as controls for this cycle of screening, there was another concern that the sequence variation might be a polymorphism derived from the B6 strain. To address this issue, we used PCR amplification of genomic DNA from B6 mice and compared results to the PCR products from PL/J and <italic>lbab/lbab </italic>mice. The data showed that the amplified DNA fragment from <italic>lbab/lbab </italic>mice was different from both B6 and PL/J mice, while the fragments from PL/J and B6 were the same (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>). To find out which nucleotide(s) was different between <italic>lbab/lbab </italic>and PL/J controls, we sequenced genomic DNA fragments from PL/J and <italic>lbab/lbab </italic>mice. The data revealed a C&#x02192;G change from PL/J to <italic>lbab/lbab </italic>mice (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>, left panel).</p><fig position="float" id="F3"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p><bold>Schematic of the sequence changes of <italic>Nppc </italic>gene in <italic>lbab </italic>mice</bold>. <bold>A</bold>: A stretch of nucleotide sequence of <italic>Nppc </italic>in <italic>lbab/lbab </italic>and +/+ mice.

The resultant RT-PCR products were sequenced using the SpectruMedix system, and the same C&#x02192;G transversion from PL/J to <italic>lbab/lbab </italic>mice was found (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>, right panel)</p><p>To evaluate the potential consequence of this point mutation in <italic>Nppc</italic>, we examined the translated amino acid sequence of <italic>Nppc</italic>. We found that this transversion predicts the substitution of arginine (R) for glycine (G) in a conserved domain of Nppc protein (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Confirmation of mutation</title><p>We conducted further experiments to confirm the single nucleotide change in the <italic>Nppc </italic>gene. Based on our initial screening, we think that it is very likely that the C&#x02192;G change in exon 2 of the <italic>Nppc </italic>gene is causally related to the phenotypes in <italic>lbab/lbab </italic>mice. Because the <italic>lbab </italic>mutation arose from PL/J, theoretically, there should be no difference in the <italic>Nppc </italic>sequence between <italic>lbab </italic>and PL/J mice except the mutation. In addition, this single nucleotide replacement is the only change between homozygous <italic>lbab/lbab </italic>and homozygous normal PL/J mice in 122 transcripts. However, we could not completely rule out the possibility that we may have missed other mutations/polymorphisms. Moreover, one could question whether this is a spontaneous polymorphism in mouse strains or a random mutation that arose after the <italic>lbab </italic>was separated from the PL/J. Therefore, we carried out two more experiments to further ensure the association between the mutation and the disease. First, we examined sequence polymorphism in exon 2 of <italic>Nppc </italic>from nine other inbred strains (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2C</xref>). As shown in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2D</xref>, each such mixture showed multiple bands, indicating the difference between <italic>lbab/lbab </italic>and those strains. Second, we bred 200 mice from heterozygous <italic>lbab</italic>/+ parents to evaluate allele frequency in relation to the phenotype. We genotyped every offspring by using the original pair of primers that flank exon 2 of the <italic>Nppc </italic>gene. From those progeny, we found 14 <italic>lbab/lbab </italic>mice that exhibited a genotype of homozygous G/G nucleotide and a phenotype of <italic>lbab </italic>mice, while the remaining progeny had 74 homozygous C/C and 112 heterozygous C/G genotypes, all with a normal phenotype. Taken together, our data indicate that the C&#x02192;G transversion in exon 2 of the <italic>Nppc </italic>gene is associated with the phenotypes observed in <italic>lbab </italic>mice.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>For the first time, we have identified a single nucleotide mutation by high throughput screening of a large genome region without fine mapping. The initial mapping at TJL was conducted with only 27 F<sub>2 </sub>animals. Linkage of <italic>lbab </italic>was first detected on Chr 1 with <italic>D1Mit231 </italic>and <italic>D1Mit9 </italic>by using the pooled sample. DNA samples were then typed for the individual 96 animals with these two markers and three additional Chr 1 markers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. By the standard strategy of classical positional cloning, the <italic>lbab </italic>locus could be further mapped. However, with the availability of mouse genome information and a tested protocol for high throughput screening of mutations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>], we directly searched genes based on the map from TJL. With the success of finding this mutation and others [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>], we feel confident that we no longer need fine mapping for most mutations.</p><p>In this study, several lines of evidence indicate that a single nucleotide mutation of <italic>Nppc </italic>is associated with the <italic>lbab </italic>phenotype. First, <italic>Nppc </italic>is located within the genetic region of the <italic>lbab </italic>locus. Second, the <italic>Nppc </italic>mutation was the only defect detected among candidate genes and ESTs within the <italic>lbab </italic>locus from <italic>lbab </italic>mice. Because the <italic>lbab </italic>mutation was transferred from the PL/J strain to the B6 inbred strain, we evaluated the possibility of close linkages of nearby sequences from the PL/J mice by screening any sequence difference near the mutation area and later crossing with PL/J mice. There were no other differences between <italic>lbab/lbab </italic>mice and their two parental strains, so the possibility of other mutation involvement was ruled out. Third, cDNA sequence results agreed with the genomic DNA data. Last, we showed that the <italic>Nppc </italic>genotype is unique in <italic>lbab/lbab </italic>mice compared with nine other inbred strains, and the G/G <italic>Nppc </italic>genotype was closely associated with the phenotype in <italic>lbab </italic>mice.</p><p>Recently, several transgenic and knockout mouse studies have demonstrated that <italic>Nppc </italic>is critical in the prevention and rescue of achondroplasia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. A recent gene knockout study done by Chusho et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>] indicated that <italic>Nppc </italic>null mice of 129/Sv background showed severe dwarfism and early death. The <italic>lbab </italic>mice have a phenotype similar to <italic>Nppc </italic>knockout mice with two exceptions. First of all, the <italic>lbab </italic>mice develop an overall smaller body size. Second, the mutants exhibit proportionate dwarfing of all organs with the possible exception of the male reproductive tract, which appears extremely small [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. However, much precise information may be obtained by a direct comparison between <italic>Nppc </italic>null mice and <italic>lbab </italic>mice. There may still be some difference between them because of the difference not only in the nature of the mutations but also in the genome backgrounds of those two models. Accordingly, we speculate that the identified point mutation of <italic>Nppc </italic>in <italic>lbab </italic>mice belongs to a loss-of-function mutation. As a key positive regulator of endochondral bone formation, <italic>Nppc </italic>seems to express its activity mainly through natriuretic peptide receptor 2 (Npr2) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. On the other hand, a recent study indicated that <italic>Nppc </italic>counteracts the activities of fibroblast growth factor signalling, which is a major negative regulatory pathway for long bone development, in both direct and indirect ways [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>].</p><p>Murine <italic>Nppc </italic>is structurally similar to that of other species. The affected Arg at codon 117 on the <italic>Nppc </italic>domain is highly conserved among all members of the natriuretic peptide system and different species (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref>). The mechanisms for regulating Nppc expression are currently unknown. Importantly, the mutated nucleotide is also located in the common biologically active COOH-terminal 22 amino acid residue area, suggesting the critical significance of this amino acid residue in the functioning of these ligands during skeletal development.</p><p>Nppc was not in the list of candidate genes for the allelism test. According to the information on TJL webpage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>], allelisms tested were brachymorphic (bm) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>] with a ratio of disease/total of 0/42 progeny born, achondroplasia (cn) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>] with a ratio of 0/61 progeny born, osteochondrodystrophy (ocd) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>] with a ratio of 0/19 (4 unclassifiable) progeny born, and small (sml) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>] with a ratio of 0/59 progeny born. The first three loci are known to be located on Chr 19 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>], 4 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>], and 19 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>], respectively. The last one, sml, is either on Chr 6 or unknown [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. Had <italic>Nppc </italic>been considered as a candidate gene, our initial screening would have been simpler, although we feel that some work is needed to exclude mutations in the nearby genes. In addition to the known function of <italic>Nppc</italic>, the fact that there is no other mutation in nearby genes in the <italic>lbab </italic>region is supporting evidence for the potential cause of the <italic>lbab </italic>phenotype by the single nucleotide mutation in <italic>Nppc</italic>.</p><p>Identifying the <italic>Nppc </italic>mutation in <italic>lbab </italic>mice provides useful information for human achondroplasia studies. It also demonstrates that, while candidate genes should be carefully examined based on gene function, it is feasible to identify mutated genes that are roughly mapped by linkage analysis by sequence-based positional candidate cloning strategy. We speculate that this strategy will be particularly useful for familial human diseases with small numbers of patients; in those cases, researchers usually have either a rough map or name/number of the chromosome of the disease locus. Furthermore, by using functional genomics and rodent models with spontaneous mutations yielding measurable phenotypes, we can rapidly identify mutational events in a cost-effective manner.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>In the present study, a sequence-based positional candidate cloning approach was applied to identify a gene mutation in <italic>lbab </italic>mice with abnormal endochondral ossification.

After determining the quality and quantity of the DNA in an Eppendorf photometer (Eppendorf Scientific, Westbury, NY), we used DNAs for large-scale mutational screening.

Based on the Ensembl and National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) databases, primer pairs flanking the exons of known and predicted genes (including ESTs) within the <italic>lbab </italic>locus were designed using Primer3 software [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Primers were located approximately 100 bp 5' or 3' to each exon and, in general, produced 300&#x02013;400 bp amplicons. For large exons that required multiple pairs of primers, primers were designed to allow neighboring DNA fragments to overlap each other by at least 50 bps. Primer pairs were synthesized from Illumina (San Diego, CA). PCR amplification of gDNA was performed in a 96-well plate format and consisted of 30&#x02013;35 cycles at three temperatures: strand denaturation at 96&#x000b0;C for 30 sec, primer annealing at 54&#x02013;60&#x000b0;C for 60 sec, and primer extension at 72&#x000b0;C for 120 sec.
