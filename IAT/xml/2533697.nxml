Collagen is a major agonist for platelets, operating through an immunoreceptor-like signalling pathway from its receptor GPVI. Although it has recently been shown that PKC&#x003b8; positively regulates outside-in signalling through integrin &#x003b1;<sub>IIb</sub>&#x003b2;<sub>3</sub> in platelets, the role of PKC&#x003b8; in GPVI-dependent signalling and functional activation of platelets has not been assessed.</p></sec><sec><title>Methodology/Principal Findings</title><p>In the present study we assessed static adhesion, cell spreading, granule secretion, integrin &#x003b1;<sub>IIb</sub>&#x003b2;<sub>3</sub> activation and platelet aggregation in washed mouse platelets lacking PKC&#x003b8;. Thrombus formation on a collagen-coated surface was assessed in vitro under flow. PKC&#x003b8;<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> platelets exhibited reduced static adhesion and filopodia generation on fibrinogen, suggesting that PKC&#x003b8; positively regulates outside-in signalling, in agreement with a previous report. In contrast, PKC&#x003b8;<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> platelets also exhibited markedly enhanced GPVI-dependent &#x003b1;-granule secretion, although dense granule secretion was unaffected, suggesting that PKC&#x003b8; differentially regulates these two granules. Inside-out regulation of &#x003b1;<sub>IIb</sub>&#x003b2;<sub>3</sub> activation was also enhanced downstream of GPVI stimulation. Although this did not result in increased aggregation, importantly thrombus formation on collagen under high shear (1000 s<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>) was enhanced.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions/Significance</title><p>These data suggest that PKC&#x003b8; is an important negative regulator of thrombus formation on collagen, potentially mediated by &#x003b1;-granule secretion and &#x003b1;<sub>IIb</sub>&#x003b2;<sub>3</sub> activation.

Many platelet functional responses, including secretion and aggregation are reduced or abolished by broad-spectrum PKC inhibitors and enhanced by PKC activators <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003277-Harper1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>, suggesting a positive role for the PKC family in general in platelet activation. However, calcium responses are clearly negatively regulated by PKC isoforms <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003277-Strehl1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>, and we have shown by pharmacological and genetic approaches that PKC&#x003b4; is a negative regulator of platelet aggregation by modulating actin dynamics through VASP <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003277-Crosby1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003277-Crosby2">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>. Individual PKC isoforms therefore play distinct roles, both positive and negative, during platelet activation, and the effect of broad-spectrum PKC inhibition or activation reflects a balance of effects on positive and negative regulatory pathways <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003277-Harper1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Human platelets express predominantly four PKC isoforms: &#x003b1;, &#x003b2;, &#x003b4; and &#x003b8;. In addition to these, mouse platelets express PKC&#x003b5; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003277-Crosby1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003277-Wang1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>. The specific importance of each isoform is hard to assess by pharmacological approaches owing to the lack of isoform specificity of these agents. The availability of biochemical and genetic tools has allowed the functions of specific isoforms to be addressed. Using such approaches, we and others have recently demonstrated highly specific roles for individual PKC isoforms in regulating platelet function: PKC&#x003b1; is critically required for granule secretion and secretion-dependent aggregation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003277-Yoshioka1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003277-Tabuchi1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>; PKC&#x003b2; is recruited to integrin &#x003b1;<sub>IIb</sub>&#x003b2;<sub>3</sub> and positively regulates outside-in signalling <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003277-Buensuceso1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>; PKC&#x003b4;, in contrast, negatively regulates filopodia formation, and lack of PKC&#x003b4; leads to enhanced platelet aggregation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003277-Pula1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>PKC&#x003b8; is a novel (i.e. DAG-sensitive, Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>-insensitive) PKC isoform, predominantly expressed in T-cells, muscle cells and platelets <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003277-Baier1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003277-Chang1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>.

However, lack of available PKC&#x003b8;-selective inhibitors has curtailed research on the role of this isoform in human platelets. Shattil and co-workers have reported PKC&#x003b8;-deficient platelets spread poorly on fibrinogen, suggesting that PKC&#x003b8; positively regulates outside-in signalling. In addition, they demonstrated that PKC&#x003b8; does not regulate platelet activation in response to a Gq/Gi coupled agonists PAR4 agonist or to ADP <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003277-Soriani1">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref>. However, this study did not examine the role of PKC&#x003b8; in collagen-induced platelet activation.</p><p>Given the primary role played by collagen in inducing platelet activation during the very early stages of thrombosis, and the parallels between signalling downstream of the collagen receptor GPVI and that downstream of immunoreceptors, it was now important to determine the role played by PKC&#x003b8; in collagen-induced platelet activation and thrombus formation. We report that PKC&#x003b8; negatively regulates GPVI-dependent &#x003b1;-granule secretion and integrin &#x003b1;<sub>IIb</sub>&#x003b2;<sub>3</sub> activation and thereby is the only PKC isoform yet described with this function. Furthermore, loss of this negative regulation in PKC&#x003b8;<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> platelets leads to enhanced thrombus formation under flow <italic>in vitro</italic>. These results reveal a novel negative regulatory pathway in platelet activation, and have relevance to the current clinical and pharmaceutical interest in PKC&#x003b8; inhibitors.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><sec sec-type="materials" id="s2a"><title>Materials</title><p>Unless stated, all reagents were from Sigma Aldrich (Poole, Dorset, U.K.).

However, here we show that the role of PKC&#x003b8; is more complicated than this, as it negatively regulates &#x003b1;-granule secretion and inside-out signalling to integrin &#x003b1;<sub>IIb</sub>&#x003b2;<sub>3</sub>, yet positively regulates outside-in integrin signalling. In the absence of PKC&#x003b8;, thrombus formation was markedly enhanced, suggesting that PKC&#x003b8; restricts thrombus size.</p><p>First, we observed a significant reduction in PKC&#x003b8;<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> platelet adhesion and reduced spreading on fibrinogen compared to WT platelets, in agreement with Soriani et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003277-Soriani1">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref>. Interestingly, Soriani's study showed an approximately 50&#x00025; reduction in spread platelet surface area whereas our study only showed a 13&#x00025; reduction. This apparent quantitative (though not qualitative) discrepancy could result from technical differences between our experiments. We used DIC microscopy to image platelet spreading, and the surface area of platelets was measured by manually outlining each cell (approximately 25 &#x000b5;m<sup>2</sup>). Another study by McCarty et al <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003277-McCarty1">&#x0005b;26&#x0005d;</xref> that used this approach saw a similar surface area. In both McCarty's study and ours, mouse platelets rarely formed large lamellipodia when spreading on fibrinogen, (in contrast to human platelets, which form full lamellipodia on fibrinogen) and filopodia were still apparent even after 45 minutes. In contrast, Soriani et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003277-Soriani1">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref> measured the surface area by confocal microscopy of rhodamine-phalloidin stained platelets, and reported a much lower surface area (approximately 8 &#x000b5;m<sup>2</sup>). Rather than measure the surface area directly, this method measures F-actin coverage, perhaps suggesting that PKC&#x003b8; regulates actin polymerization. WT platelets spread on fibrinogen and imaged using this method do not appear to exhibit the spiky morphology we and others <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003277-McCarty1">&#x0005b;26&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003277-Thornber1">&#x0005b;27&#x0005d;</xref> observe using DIC microscopy. Our analysis suggests that PKC&#x003b8; positively regulates filopodia formation, since a smaller proportion of PKC&#x003b8;<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> platelets showed many (&#x0003e;5) filopodia compared to WT. Regardless of these quantitative differences, both of our studies qualitatively agree that PKC&#x003b8; is a positive regulator of outside-in signalling by integrin &#x003b1;<sub>IIb</sub>&#x003b2;<sub>3</sub>.</p><p>In contrast, PKC&#x003b8; negatively regulates GPVI-induced &#x003b1;<sub>IIb</sub>&#x003b2;<sub>3</sub> activation. The selective GPVI agonist, CRP, induced a concentration-dependent increase in binding of JON/A, an activation state-specific &#x003b1;<sub>IIb</sub>&#x003b2;<sub>3</sub> antibody. In PKC&#x003b8;<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> platelets this was markedly enhanced compared to WT at an intermediate concentration of CRP, though not at a higher concentration, suggesting that PKC&#x003b8; reduces expression of active &#x003b1;<sub>IIb</sub>&#x003b2;<sub>3</sub> on the platelet surface, although inhibition can be overcome as agonist stimulation increases. It has been previously reported that PKC&#x003b8; does not regulate &#x003b1;<sub>IIb</sub>&#x003b2;<sub>3</sub> activation in response to ADP or AYPGKF <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003277-Soriani1">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref>, both of which act through G protein-coupled receptors, suggesting that the regulatory role of PKC&#x003b8; may be specific to GPVI signalling.</p><p>CRP-induced aggregation was not affected by the absence of PKC&#x003b8;, however. Similarly, collagen-induced aggregation was also the same in WT and PKC&#x003b8;<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> platelets. The lack of any effect on the rate or extent of aggregation was surprising, especially in response to 1 &#x000b5;g/ml CRP. At this concentration, the rate of aggregation was submaximal and yet the extent of integrin activation strongly enhanced. It might be expected, therefore, that the increased integrin activation would accelerate aggregation. However, since the extent of aggregation in response to 1 &#x000b5;g/ml CRP was almost maximal, further enhancement of &#x003b1;<sub>IIb</sub>&#x003b2;<sub>3</sub> in PKC&#x003b8;<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> platelets can have little further effect. The apparent disparity between absolute levels of integrin activation and extent of aggregation highlights the large level in integrin reserve believed to exist in platelets. &#x003b2;<sub>3</sub><sup>&#x0002b;/&#x02212;</sup> platelets, with only 50&#x00025; of the WT levels of &#x003b2;<sub>3</sub> on their surface, have almost identical bleeding times and aggregation responses to PMA, ADP, thrombin and arachidonic acid compared to WT platelets <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003277-HodivalaDilke1">&#x0005b;28&#x0005d;</xref>. In like manner, although WT platelets show approximately 50 &#x00025; less integrin activation than PKC&#x003b8;<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> platelets at 1 &#x000b5;g/ml CRP, we should not expect this necessarily to relate to a difference in the extent of aggregation.</p><p>PKC&#x003b8; also negatively regulates &#x003b1;-granule secretion, although no difference in dense granule secretion was observed. This suggests that the release of different platelet granules is regulated by distinct mechanisms. The PKC family in general is a critical positive regulator of platelet granule secretion <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003277-Strehl1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003277-Yoshioka1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003277-Tabuchi1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>, although this positive function is likely to be mediated through conventional (Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>-dependent) isoforms <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003277-Murugappan1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003277-Yoshioka1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003277-Tabuchi1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>. Thus, it appears that the different PKC isoforms have contrasting roles in platelet &#x003b1;-granule secretion: PKC&#x003b1; is critically required for &#x003b1;-granule secretion, and PKC&#x003b8; acts to counter this action. PKC&#x003b1; is also critically important for dense granule secretion, which is not countered by PKC&#x003b8;. It has been suggested that PKC&#x003b4;, closely related to PKC&#x003b8;, may negatively regulate GPVI-dependent dense granule secretion <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003277-Murugappan1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>. This interpretation was based on the use of rottlerin, a supposedly specific PKC&#x003b4; inhibitor (though several PKC&#x003b4;-independent targets have been reported <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003277-Soltoff1">&#x0005b;29&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003277-McGovern1">&#x0005b;31&#x0005d;</xref>). However, we have previously reported that rottlerin enhances GPVI-dependent dense granule release even in PKC&#x003b4;<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003277-Pula1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>. Thus, negative regulation of GPVI-dependent dense granule release does not appear to be mediated by either PKC&#x003b4; or PKC&#x003b8;.</p><p>PKC&#x003b8; negatively regulates thrombus formation under flow over a collagen-coated surface. Binding to collagen activates GPVI, leading to integrin &#x003b1;<sub>IIb</sub>&#x003b2;<sub>3</sub> activation, which is enhanced in PKC&#x003b8;<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> platelets. The increased number of adhesive contacts between platelets may accelerate the growth of the thrombus. Thus, negative regulation of inside-out signalling by PKC&#x003b8; may be an important brake on thrombus growth at a site of injury. This effect is in contrast to the lack of effect seen in aggregation, highlighting the importance of physiological flow conditions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003277-Nesbitt1">&#x0005b;32&#x0005d;</xref>. In standard aggregometry, platelets exhibit a very large integrin reserve, whereas under flow, with higher shear force on any platelet-platelet interactions, integrin activation may be a limiting factor. Increased &#x003b1;<sub>IIb</sub>&#x003b2;<sub>3</sub> activation would therefore enhance thrombus growth. This effect may be partially countered by the slightly reduced platelet adhesion to fibrinogen and reduced subsequent spreading, perhaps leading to fewer platelet-platelet contacts. Given the large effect on integrin activation compared to the smaller effect on spreading, however, the balance of these appears to favour increased thrombus size in PKC&#x003b8;<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> platelets.</p><p>In summary, we have shown that PKC&#x003b8; negatively regulates GPVI-dependent inside-out signalling, in contrast to the positive role generally ascribed to the PKC family in general. Although enhanced integrin &#x003b1;<sub>IIb</sub>&#x003b2;<sub>3</sub> activation does not lead to increased aggregation in an aggregometer tube, PKC&#x003b8;<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> platelets display enhanced thrombus formation on collagen under flow, suggesting that, under more physiological conditions, the regulatory role of PKC&#x003b8; may restrict thrombus size. This may impact on the clinical safety of PKC&#x003b8; inhibitors.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>We are grateful to Professor Dan Littman (Skirball Institute of Biomolecular Medicine, New York, USA) for generating the PKC&#x003b8;&#x02212;/&#x02212; mice used in this study, and to Professor Isabella Screpanti (University &#x0201c;La Sapienza&#x0201d;, Rome, Italy) for supplying them.
