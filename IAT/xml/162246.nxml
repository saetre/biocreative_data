The architectural DNA- binding protein, High Mobility Group protein B-1 is a unique activator of p53. HMGB-1 protein is structured into two HMG-box domains, namely A-box and B-box, connected to a long highly acidic C-terminal domain. Here we report that both the C-terminal domain and A-box of HMGB-1 are critical for stimulation of p53-mediated DNA binding to its cognate site. Though deletion of these domains showed minimal effect in activation of p53-mediated transcription from the DNA template as compared to full-length HMGB-1, truncation of both the domains indeed showed significant reduction of transcriptional activation from the chromatin template as observed in DNA binding.

Genes that are directly regulated by p53 include GADD45, Bax, p21&#x0002f;WAF1, Cyclin G, Mdm2, IGFBP3, ACTA, MMP2, PCNA and TGF-&#x003b1; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg412c1">1</xref>). Each of these downstream effectors, which are activated by p53 during genotoxic insult contain, one or more p53-responsive sites in their promoter region. p53 contains three functionally important domains: transactivation domain, sequence-specific DNA binding domain and C-terminal oligomerization domain. The sequence-specific DNA binding domain is frequently mutated in several malignant tumors and most of the mutant forms have impaired DNA binding activities.</p><p>Post-translational modification (i.e. phosphorylation and acetylation), antibody binding and deletion of highly basic C-terminal 30 amino acid (363&#x02013;393) activates p53-mediated transactivation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg412c2">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg412c4">4</xref>). The C-terminal basic 30 amino acid (363&#x02013;393) stretch in the oligomerization domain was found to be a negative regulator of sequence-specific DNA binding of p53 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg412c2">2</xref>). The majority of the p53 activators stimulate p53 function by relieving the repression of this domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg412c5">5</xref>). The notable exception is the High Mobility Group protein B-1 (HMGB-1). It has been shown that HMGB-1 can stimulate DNA binding as well as transactivation of both full-length p53 and C-terminal deleted p53 (p53&#x00394;30), suggesting a unique mechanism of activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg412c5">5</xref>). HMGB-1 is a nonhistone chromosomal protein having architectural DNA binding properties. Apart from p53, it also activates sequence-specific DNA binding of several other transcription factors, which includes the estrogen receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg412c6">6</xref>), HOX proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg412c7">7</xref>), MTLF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg412c8">8</xref>) and the POU domain containing proteins Oct1, Oct2 and Oct6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg412c9">9</xref>). In most of these instances, it was reported that HMGB-1 enhances transcriptional activation of these proteins in transient transfection assays (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg412c10">10</xref>). Induction of transcription by MTLF was shown in an <italic>in vitro</italic> transcription assay using adenovirus major late promoter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg412c8">8</xref>). However, the mechanism of HMGB-1-mediated stimulation of DNA binding as well as transcriptional activation is poorly understood.</p><p>HMGB-1 protein contains three domains: two highly basic N-terminal domains, namely, A-box and B-box, and a long acidic C-terminal domain. The A-box and B-box functionally interact with Hox proteins, steroid hormone receptors, Oct1 and Oct2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg412c6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg412c7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg412c9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg412c11">11</xref>) and the C-terminal domain regulates the DNA binding of HMGB-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg412c12">12</xref>). Significantly, p53 directly interacts with the A-box and results in an enhancement of its DNA binding to cisplatin-modified DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg412c13">13</xref>). This provides a molecular link between DNA damage and p53-mediated DNA repair. Though HMGB-1 is not a member of the nucleosome binding family proteins, like HMGN-1&#x0002f;-2, it directly interacts with the chromatin through the linker DNA and core histones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg412c14">14</xref>). The C-terminal domain of HMGB-1 interacts with the core histone dimer H2A&#x02013;H2B (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg412c15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg412c16">16</xref>) and the A-box interacts with core histones H3 and H4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg412c16">16</xref>).</p><p>The present study examined the role of the C-terminal acidic domain and the A-box of HMGB-1 in the regulation of p53 function. The C-terminal domain and the A-box have been found to be essential for the stimulation of p53-mediated DNA binding to its cognate site. Transcription from chromatin template showed significant decrease in transcriptional activation upon truncation of the C-terminal domain and the A-box of HMGB-1. The absolute requirements of these domains are specific for the stimulation of p53-dependent chromatin transcription. Transient transfection experiments using the H1299 (p53 null) cell line also showed that the C-terminal domain and A-box are critical for the reporter gene expression specifically in the p53 context. Furthermore, deletion of the C-terminal domain and A-box of HMGB-1 did not activate p53-induced apoptosis, strengthening our hypothesis that the C-terminal domain and A-box are critical for HMGB-1-mediated p53 activation.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Plasmid constructions</title><p>Recombinant N-terminal His<sub>6</sub>-tagged truncated forms of HMGB-1, HMGB-1&#x00394;C and HMGB-1&#x00394;A were cloned by PCR-based subcloning using primers complementary to the respective 5&#x02032; and 3&#x02032; ends of the full-length human HMGB-1 (HMGB-1FL) expression clone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg412c17">17</xref>).

Since the HMGB-1 activates the C-terminal 30 residues deleted p53, the mechanism of activation is somewhat distinct and unique (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg412c5">5</xref>). In order to elucidate this mechanism it is essential to find out the role of each domain of HMGB-1 in the stimulation of p53 DNA binding. We have constructed two deletion mutants for this purpose: (i) p53 interacting A-box deleted, HMGB-1&#x00394;A and (ii) C-terminal deleted HMGB-1&#x00394;C (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg412f1">1</xref>A). These proteins were expressed and purified from <italic>E.coli</italic> (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg412f1">1</xref>B) to homogeneity. The authenticity of these proteins was confirmed by western blot analysis (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg412f1">1</xref>C) using HMGB-2 antibody. The effect of these truncated forms of HMGB-1 on p53 DNA binding was studied in an EMSA using radiolabeled 40mer double-stranded oligonucleotide containing a p53 cognate site and recombinant p53 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg412f2">2</xref>). Our EMSA analysis showed that HMGB-1FL activates p53 DNA binding by 6-fold as compared to p53 alone (lane 2 versus lanes 9&#x02013;11), whereas acidic C-terminal deleted HMGB-1&#x00394;C could not activate the DNA binding above the basal level (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg412f2">2</xref>, compare lane 2 with lanes 6&#x02013;8 and with lanes 9&#x02013;11). The A-box of HMGB-1 directly interacts with p53. Thus, in order to find out the role of A-box in the stimulation of p53-mediated DNA binding, the A-box truncated form of HMGB-1, HMGB-1&#x00394;A, was used in the DNA binding experiment. We found that the A-box deleted HMGB-1 was also unable to stimulate the p53 binding to its cognate site as compared to HMGB-1FL (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg412f2">2</xref>, compare lane 2 with lanes 3&#x02013;5 and with lanes 9&#x02013;11). However, the HMGB-1FL, HMGB-1&#x00394;C and HMGB-1&#x00394;A did not bind to the DNA sequence nonspecifically (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg412f2">2</xref>, lanes 12&#x02013;20). These results strongly suggest that the C-terminal acidic domain and A-box of HMGB-1 are crucial for the stimulation of p53-mediated DNA binding.</p></sec><sec><title>C-terminal acidic domain and A-box of HMGB-1 regulate p53-mediated transcription</title><p>Since HMGB-1 is known to function as a transcriptional coactivator and regulate the RNA polymerase II-mediated transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg412c17">17</xref>), we were interested in investigating the effect of HMGB-1 and its different domains on p53-mediated transcription <italic>in vitro.</italic> To address this, we have constructed the DNA template with five p53-binding sites (based on GADD45 promoter) by replacing Gal4 sites into a plasmid (p5GalML) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg412c19">19</xref>) comprised of adenovirus major late core promoter and a G-less cassette (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg412f3">3</xref>A). The sequence and the position of the p53 binding sites were confirmed by DNA sequencing. An <italic>in vitro</italic> DNA transcription assay using HeLa nuclear extract and increasing concentrations of bacterially expressed FLAG-tagged p53 (30&#x02013;200 ng) showed corresponding transcriptional activation from the template (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg412f3">3</xref>B), indicating that the template is appropriate for <italic>in vitro</italic> transcription studies.</p><p>Transcription from DNA template was carried out according to the protocol shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg412f3">3</xref>C. The transcription from DNA template showed that the HMGB-1FL activates p53-mediated transcription by &#x0223c;2.1- and &#x0223c;1.9-fold (for 50 and 100 ng, respectively) (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg412f3">3</xref>D, compare lane 2 with lanes 6 and 7). Interestingly, the C-terminal deleted HMGB-1, HMGB-1&#x00394;C, could minimally activate the p53-mediated transcription at 50 and 100 ng concentration, which is considerably lower than the activation brought about by HMGB-1FL (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg412f3">3</xref>D, compare lane 2 with lanes 3 and 4). As observed in the case of HMGB-1FL, a higher concentration (200 ng) of HMGB-1&#x00394;C also repressed the p53 driven transcription from DNA template (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg412f3">3</xref>D, lanes 8 and 4, respectively). Similarly, the A-box truncated HMGB-1, HMGB-1&#x00394;A, could minimally activate the transcription at 50 ng concentration (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg412f3">3</xref>E, compare lane 2 with lane 3 and lane 2 with lane 6), whereas 100 and 200 ng of HMGB-1&#x00394;A repressed the transcription as compared to p53 alone (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg412f3">3</xref>E, compare lane 2 with lanes 4 and 5).</p><p>In order to find out the specificity of HMGB-1 towards p53 in the stimulation of transcriptional activation, we have further performed <italic>in vitro</italic> transcription experiments using p5GalML template containing five gal binding sites and a subsaturation amount of Gal4VP16 as an activator. The result showed that HMGB-1&#x00394;C, HMGB-1&#x00394;A and HMGB-1FL could not activate Gal4VP16-mediated transcription from the DNA template (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg412f3">3</xref>F, compare lane 2 with lanes 3&#x02013;5, lane 2 with lanes 6&#x02013;8; Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg412f3">3</xref>G, compare lane 2 with lanes 3&#x02013;5 and compare lanes 6&#x02013;8). In agreement with the results from the DNA binding experiment these data suggest that the C-terminal domain and A-box of HMGB-1 are required to activate p53-mediated transcription from the DNA template and the stimulation of transcriptional activation by HMGB-1 is specific for p53.</p><p>The HMGB-1 is a chromatin protein and has been implicated in the maintenance and establishment of chromatin structure. These observations lead us to investigate the phenomenon in the chromatin context. The chromatin template was assembled on p<sup>(p53)</sup><sub>5</sub><sup>ML</sup> plasmid using recombinant <italic>Drosophila</italic> ACF complex (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg412f1">1</xref>E), His<sub>6</sub>-tagged mouse NAP1 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg412f1">1</xref>F), recombinant topoisomerase I and highly purified human (HeLa) core histones (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg412f1">1</xref>G) as described in Materials and Methods. The assembled chromatin was characterized by a supercoiling assay (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg412f4">4</xref>A) and partial micrococcal digestion (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg412f4">4</xref>B). The assembly reaction without ATP showed several intermediate DNA forms, whereas a complete absence of these forms was observed in the ATP-containing assembly reaction as revealed by the supercoiling assay (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg412f4">4</xref>A compare lanes 3 and 4). This suggests that the assembly is ATP dependent as expected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg412c22">22</xref>). The MNase digestion pattern of the reconstituted chromatin showed well resolved regularly spaced nucleosomes (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg412f4">4</xref>B). These results indicate that the reconstituted chromatin is appropriate for <italic>in vitro</italic> transcription experiments. The assembled chromatin template was used for the transcription experiment as shown in the protocol of Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg412f4">4</xref>C. In this protocol, prior to the activator binding step, chromatin was subjected to acetylation in the presence of p300 and acetyl CoA. It was necessary to overcome the chromatin-mediated repression, and without this step, chromatin template was completely inert to transcription. After chromatin remodeling, the HAT activity of p300 was inhibited by a specific inhibitor, Lys-CoA. The inhibition was confirmed by incubating p53, HMGB-1 and core histone with <sup>3</sup>H acetyl CoA and the inhibited enzyme in a separate reaction which showed that p53, HMGB-1 and core histones could not be acetylated by Lys-CoA treated p300 (data not shown). The ectopic addition of full-length recombinant HMGB-1 enhances the p53-dependent transcription &#x0223c;4-fold as compared to p53 alone (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg412f4">4</xref>D, compare lane 2 with lane 5), whereas addition of HMGB-1 truncated forms, HMGB-1&#x00394;C and HMGB-1&#x00394;A, could not stimulate p53-mediated transcriptional activation (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg412f4">4</xref>D, compare lane 2 with lanes 3 and 4). Similar to transcription from histone-free DNA template, HMGB-1&#x00394;C, HMGB-1&#x00394;A and HMGB-1FL could not activate Gal4VP16-mediated transcription also from chromatin template (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg412f4">4</xref>E, compare lane 2 with lanes 3&#x02013;5). These results lead to a very significant indication that the C-terminal domain and A-box of HMGB-1 play a critical role in the stimulation of p53-mediated transcription in the chromatin context (see Discussion) and the HMB-1-mediated transcriptional activation is specific for p53.</p></sec><sec><title>Stimulation of transactivation of p53 by C-terminal acidic domain and A-box of HMGB-1</title><p>The significant difference in p53-mediated transcriptional activation from chromatin template upon truncation of the C-terminal domain and A-box of HMGB-1 prompted us to examine the role of these domains in an another physiological condition, which is activation of the p53-responsive promoter in transient transfection. For this purpose, we have cloned HMGB-1 and its truncated forms in pCDNA 3.1(&#x0002b;) vector under the regulation of the CMV promoter. In order to test the ability of these constructs to activate p53-mediated (placed under the CMV promoter) transcriptional activation of a promoter containing a p53-responsive site (PG13Luc) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg412c26">26</xref>), transient transfection assays were performed using the H1299 (p53 null) cell line. The H1299 cells were transfected with plasmid expressing p53 and HMGB-1FL and its truncated forms either separately or together along with the luciferase reporter construct. The p<sup>CMV&#x003b2;gal</sup> was used as an internal control. Our results showed that there was significant activation (&#x0223c;9-fold) of the p53-responsive promoter upon cotransfection of HMGB-1FL and p53 as compared to p53 alone (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg412f5">5</xref>A). The cotransfection of HMGB-1&#x00394;C and HMGB-1&#x00394;A with p53 yielded minimal transactivation (&#x0223c;2-fold) in relation to only p53 that could be contributed by some unknown cellular factor. However, HMGB-1&#x00394;C, HMGB-1&#x00394;A and HMGB-1FL could not stimulate Gal4VP16-mediated reporter gene expression <italic>in vivo</italic> (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg412f5">5</xref>B). These observations suggest that the truncation of both the domains of HMGB-1 lead to a significant decrease in the HMGB-1-mediated activation of p53 function and this activation is specific for p53. These results further strengthen our hypothesis that the C-terminal domain and A-box of HMGB-1 are crucial for the activation of p53 function.</p></sec><sec><title>C-terminal domain and A-box of HMGB-1 induces p53-dependent apoptosis</title><p>In order to maintain the normal cellular function, p53 induces apoptosis in cells undergoing irreparable genotoxic damage by triggering the apoptotic machinery for its silent death. The factors that activate p53 function finally result in apoptosis and&#x0002f;or cell cycle arrest. Since HMGB-1 has been shown to activate p53 function from different promoters, we are interested in investigating the ultimate fate of the cell when HMGB-1 and its truncated forms are over-expressed along with p53 in the H1299 cell line. Interestingly, we found that the HMGB-1FL indeed activated p53-dependent apoptosis by 81&#x00025; as compared to p53 alone (compare Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg412f6">6</xref>D with A and I). The truncation of the C-terminal domain and A-box of HMGB-1 could not activate apoptosis above the basal (p53) level (compare Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg412f6">6</xref>D with B and C; Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg412f6">6</xref>I). These data validate the role of the C-terminal domain and A-box of HMGB-1 in the activation of p53 function.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>The highly abundant chromosomal protein HMGB-1 plays a significant role in the regulation of chromatin structure as well as transcriptional activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg412c12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg412c27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg412c28">28</xref>). It enhances the binding of several transcription factors to their cognate site resulting in the stimulation of transcriptional activation. One of these factors is p53, the tumor suppressor. Apparently, the mechanism of p53 activation by HMGB-1 is a unique one and remains less understood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg412c5">5</xref>). This study has addressed the role of different domains of HMGB-1 in the stimulation of p53-mediated DNA binding and transcriptional activation. Here we report that (i) both the C-terminal domain and A-box of HMGB-1 are essential for the activation of p53-mediated DNA binding, (ii) these domains of HMGB-1 are critical for p53-mediated transcriptional activation specifically from chromatin template assembled by the ACF complex, (iii) the stimulation of transactivation from a p53-responsive promoter also requires the C-terminal acidic domain and A-box of HMGB-1 and (iv) truncation of the C-terminal domain and A-box failed to induce p53-mediated apoptosis, strengthening our observation in physiological conditions.</p><p>The biochemical activity of p53 which is required for tumor suppression and the cellular response to DNA damage involves the ability of the protein to bind to the cognate sites and to function as a transcription factor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg412c29">29</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg412c33">33</xref>). By activating p53-mediated transcription, p53 rescues the cells from genotoxic damage. Thus, the proper regulation of p53 is essential to maintain normal cell growth and development. Most of the p53 modulator proteins stimulate the p53 function by inhibiting the self-repression (exerted by the C-terminal domain of p53) and thereby cannot activate the C-terminal domain deleted p53. HMGB-1 differs from the other p53 modulators because it can stimulate C-terminal domain deleted p53 suggesting a unique mechanism of p53 activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg412c5">5</xref>). In an another important study, it has been reported that the C-terminal domain of p53 interacts with the A-box of HMGB-1 and this interaction is required for the sequence non-specific binding of HMGB-1 to cisplatin-modified DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg412c13">13</xref>). Thus, these independent studies clearly showed that the HMGB-1 enhances the activation of p53 function without the interaction between the C-terminal domain of p53 and the A-box of HMGB-1. Interestingly, we have found that in the absence of A-box, HMGB-1 cannot stimulate the p53 DNA binding above the basal level. These data suggest a novel and unidentified mechanism of HMGB-1-mediated activation of p53 wherein A-box of HMGB-1 plays a critical role. Our result also showed that HMGB-1&#x00394;C, which lacks a C-terminal acidic domain, did not stimulate p53 DNA binding. Since the C-terminal acidic domain of HMGB-1 regulates its DNA binding properties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg412c28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg412c34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg412c35">35</xref>), these data suggest a specific role of the C-terminal acidic domain in the activation of p53 DNA binding.</p><p>The results from the DNA binding experiments lead us to address the effect of DNA binding in transcriptional activation. Though deletion of the C-terminal domain and A-box of HMGB-1 minimally effect p53-mediated transcription from DNA template, chromatinization of the same template showed the absolute necessity of these domains. At this juncture it was important to address the specificity of HMGB-1-mediated enhancement of p53 driven transcription. We have performed <italic>in vitro</italic> transcription experiments using a potent chimeric transcriptional activator, Gal4VP16. The result showed that HMGB-1 and its derivatives could not stimulate transcription from DNA template containing five Gal4 binding sites. Chromatinization of this template resulted in only &#x0223c;2-fold repression as compared to transcription from the DNA template, whereas in p53-dependent transcription, this repression is much higher (&#x0223c;6-fold) (compare Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg412f4">4</xref>D, lane 6 with Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg412f4">4</xref>E, lane 6). This could be attributed to more efficient Gal4VP16-mediated transcriptional activation. However, transcription from the chromatin template driven by Gal4VP16 also could not be stimulated further by the ectopic addition of HMGB-1 and its derivatives. This observation suggests a specific role of the C-terminal domain and A-box of HMGB-1 in the activation process wherein HMGB-1 cannot stimulate transcription globally by modulating the activity of general polymerase II factors including RNA polymerase II itself. We observed that higher concentrations of HMGB-1FL as well as the deletion constructs of HMGB-1 inhibit both DNA (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg412f3">3</xref>D, lanes 8 and 5 and 3E, lanes 8 and 4, 5) and chromatin (data not shown) transcription mediated by both p53 and Gal4VP16. Presumably, higher concentrations of these proteins sequestrates general transcription factors (e.g. TBP and TFIIA) from the transcription reaction and thereby causes the repression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg412c17">17</xref>). Furthermore, this chromatin-specific requirement of the C-terminal domain and A-box are in proper agreement with the observation that the acidic C-terminal domain and A-box of HMGB-1 are required for the stimulation of reporter gene expression in transient transfection assays (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg412f4">4</xref>D and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg412f5">5</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg412c36">36</xref>). The transient transfection assay using p53, HMGB-1 and its truncated forms showed that the deletion of both the C-terminal domain and A-box of HMGB-1 reduces the p53-responsive promoter activity by &#x0223c;4-fold (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg412f5">5</xref>A). However, HMGB-1 and its truncated forms could not stimulate Gal4VP16-mediated transactivation from the Gal-responsive promoter, G10Luc (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg412f5">5</xref>B). This observation further supports the <italic>in vitro</italic> transcription data regarding HMGB-1-mediated specific activation of p53 function. We have observed a very high activity of the Gal-responsive promoter in our transient transfection assay with Gal4VP16. This could be because of the fact that the Gal4VP16 is a highly efficient chimeric transcriptional activator, whereas p53 is a natural and comparatively less potent activator (compare Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg412f5">5</xref>A and B). Though it is not unambiguous, there is evidence suggesting that transiently transfected DNAs assemble into a physiological chromatin template. Thus, taken together, the chromatin transcription and transient transfection data argue for a chromatin-specific role of the C-terminal domain and A-box of HMGB-1 in transcriptional activation of p53. Furthermore, truncation of both the C-terminal acidic domain and A-box of HMGB-1 could not stimulate p53-mediated apoptosis suggesting the role of both the domains in activation of p53 function. Our apoptosis assay data strongly correlate HMGB-1-mediated activation of p53 DNA binding and transcription with functional consequences <italic>in vivo</italic>. This is the first example showing the role of different domains of HMGB-1 in the activation of p53 DNA binding and transcription from chromatin template linking p53-dependent apoptosis.</p><p>It is important to note that the C-terminal domain of HMGB-1 interacts with the H2A&#x02013;H2B dimer of core histone and the A-box interacts with H3&#x02013;H4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg412c15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg412c16">16</xref>). In this present context, based on our observation, we are tempted to speculate that this histone-specific interaction of HMGB-1 domains may play an important role for the regulation of several transcription factors including p53. Significantly, both HMGB-1 and p53 are post-translationally modified with several functional consequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg412c37">37</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg412c39">39</xref>). It would be interesting to examine the intriguing effect of these post-translational modifications in the context of HMGB-1-mediated activation of p53 function.</p></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="display-objects"><title>Figures and Tables</title><fig id="gkg412f1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p> Recombinant and native proteins used in the different experiments.
