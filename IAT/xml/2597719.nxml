Ectromelia virus provides a mouse model for smallpox where the virus and the host's immune response have co-evolved. Using this model, our study investigated the role of the complement system during a poxvirus infection. By multiple inoculation routes, ectromelia virus caused increased mortality by 7 to 10 days post-infection in C57BL/6 mice that lack C3, the central component of the complement cascade. In C3<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice, ectromelia virus disseminated earlier to target organs and generated higher peak titers compared to the congenic controls. Also, increased hepatic inflammation and necrosis correlated with these higher tissue titers and likely contributed to the morbidity in the C3<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice. In vitro, the complement system in na&#x000ef;ve C57BL/6 mouse sera neutralized ectromelia virus, primarily through the recognition of the virion by natural antibody and activation of the classical and alternative pathways. Sera deficient in classical or alternative pathway components or antibody had reduced ability to neutralize viral particles, which likely contributed to increased viral dissemination and disease severity in vivo. The increased mortality of C4<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> or Factor B<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice also indicates that these two pathways of complement activation are required for survival. In summary, the complement system acts in the first few minutes, hours, and days to control this poxviral infection until the adaptive immune response can react, and loss of this system results in lethal infection.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><p>As one of the most successful pathogens ever, smallpox caused death and disfigurement worldwide until its eradication in the 1970s. The complement system, an essential part of the innate immune response, protects against many pathogens; however, its role during smallpox infection is unclear. In this study, we investigated the importance of the complement system in mousepox infection as a model for human smallpox disease. We compared mice with and without genetic deficiencies in complement following infection by multiple routes with ectromelia virus, the causative agent of mousepox. Deficiencies in several complement proteins reduced survival of ectromelia infection. Sera from these same complement-deficient mice also have reduced ability to neutralize ectromelia virus in vitro. In complement-deficient mice, ectromelia virus disseminated from the inoculation site earlier and produced higher levels of virus in the bloodstream, spleen, and liver. The increased infection in the liver resulted in greater tissue damage. We hypothesize that the complement-deficient mice's reduced ability to neutralize ectromelia virus at the inoculation site resulted in earlier dissemination and more severe disease. We have demonstrated that surviving ectromelia virus infection requires the complement system, which suggests that this system may also protect against smallpox infection.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="14"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Poxviruses remain a threat to the human population despite the eradication decades ago of naturally circulating variola virus, the causative agent of smallpox.

C3 could control viral replication early at the inoculation site by directly inactivating free virus or by recruiting inflammatory cells through release of anaphylatoxins. The lack of C3 in the blood to neutralize or opsonize the virus could also result in greater viremia, thereby producing the higher titers observed in the target organs on day 7. Alternatively, C3's well-established ability to facilitate induction of antibody and T cell responses could explain the observed difference <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000249-Kapadia1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000249-Kopf1">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000249-Ochsenbein1">&#x0005b;53&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000249-Mehlhop2">&#x0005b;57&#x0005d;</xref>.

(H) The classical, lectin, and alternative pathways each initiate the complement cascade by forming a C3 convertase that cleaves C3 to C3b. Antibody triggers the classical pathway through C1q. The carbohydrate motifs on pathogens activate the lectin pathway through MBL. The classical and lectin pathways form the C4 containing convertase, C4b2a. C3 deposited from these two pathways or from spontaneous activation of C3 initiates the alternative pathway. Upon binding, the activated C3 molecule FB is cleaved to Bb by FD, which forms the alternative pathway convertase, C3bBb. The alternative pathway amplifies C3b deposition by any pathway. C3 activation leads to important antiviral effector functions. Release of the anaphylatoxins C3a and C5a recruits inflammatory cells. C3b and C4b opsonize viral particles or infected cells, leading to neutralization or destruction by phagocytosis. C3b also leads to activation of C5 and formation of the MAC which disrupts virions or infected cells.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="ppat.1000249.g005"/></fig><p>To further define if complement neutralized ECTV, sera from mice genetically deficient in a complement component or antibody were used in this assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000249-g004">Figure 4C&#x02013;4G</xref>).

The C1q subunit of C1 interacts with antibody to trigger the classical pathway. MBL, a C1q analog, initiates the lectin pathway. MBL A<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> x MBL C<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup>, C1q<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup>, and antibody-deficient (&#x003bc;MT) sera were compared (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000249-g005">Figure 5D</xref>). &#x003bc;MT or C1q<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> sera only partially neutralized ECTV, comparable to C4<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> sera. Conversely, wild-type levels of neutralization occurred independent of MBL A and C. These data suggest that natural antibody activated the classical complement pathway to neutralize ECTV.</p><p>Further analysis revealed three key points relative to natural antibody. First, heat-inactivated wild-type sera behaves like buffer alone, which indicates that natural antibody alone lacks neutralizing activity; instead, complement activity was required to neutralize ECTV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000249-g005">Figure 5A and 5G</xref>). Second, heat-inactivated wild-type sera, as a source of natural antibody, restored the neutralizing activity of &#x003bc;MT sera (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000249-g005">Figure 5F</xref>). Consistent with this finding, &#x003bc;MT or heat-inactivated wild-type serum did not effectively neutralize ECTV independently, but they did so in combination. Third, the modest but significantly greater neutralization in the normal compared to heat-inactivated &#x003bc;MT sera suggests that antibody-independent (alternate pathway) complement activation also occurred.</p><p>C3b deposited by any pathway interacts with factor B (FB) and factor D (FD) to generate the alternative pathway C3 convertase, which amplifies C3b production. Alternative pathway activation itself likely explains the neutralization observed in the &#x003bc;MT, C1q<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup>, or C4<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> sera.

Deficiency of C3, C4, or FB resulted in acute lethal infection, establishing a requirement for multiple complement pathways in host defense against this pathogen. Specifically, C3 deficiency permitted ECTV to disseminate earlier, reach a higher titer in the target organs, and induce greater liver damage. Consistent with these in vivo results, na&#x000ef;ve mouse sera neutralized ECTV infectivity in vitro, and sera lacking either classical or alternative pathway components had decreased activity. Several lines of evidence indicate that natural antibody initiated the classical complement cascade in the wild-type mouse. Substantial neutralization occurred in sera without lytic activity, which points to opsonization as the predominant mechanism of neutralization. Based on these results, we propose that natural antibody binds viral antigen to activate the classical pathway, followed by engagement of the alternative pathway's feedback loop to opsonize the virus.</p><p>The ECTV model system provides several advantages for analyzing the role of complement in poxviral pathogenesis. First, the mouse-specific pathogen ECTV has coevolved with and causes severe disease in the natural host, analogous to variola virus in humans. Second, the role of complement and the pathways involved can now be more rigorously dissected in vivo and in vitro with the availability of complement-deficient mice. Additionally, the in vitro experiments employed sera from the same strains used to characterize the effect of complement deficiency in vivo, and the neutralizing capacity in vitro paralleled the in vivo mortality. Third, viral pathogenesis, morbidity, and mortality can be assessed by multiple routes of infection and across a range of viral inoculum to demonstrate a broad requirement for complement.</p><p>Complement-deficient mice succumbed to acute ECTV infection with the majority of deaths occurring between days 6&#x02013;10. Based on time to death following footpad inoculation, C3 deficiency resembled immunodeficiencies of other important components of the antiviral response, specifically CD8<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000249-Karupiah1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000249-Fang1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>, NK cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000249-Fang2">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000249-Parker2">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>, and IFN-&#x003b3; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000249-Karupiah3">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>.

The CD40<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> and CD154<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice ultimately die &#x0223c;4 to 8 weeks post-infection. This differs from surviving C3<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice, which recovered and did not show signs of ongoing illness for up to 4 months of observation. The early death of the complement-deficient mice highlights the complement system's essential contribution to survival during the first few days of infection.</p><p>To characterize how complement protects the host from lethal infection, we analyzed the impact of C3 deficiency on the kinetics of viral spread. ECTV replication at the inoculation site and in the draining lymph node produces a viremia that seeds the primary target organs, the liver and spleen <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000249-Buller1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>. Several observations from this study increase our understanding of complement's role in controlling poxviral infection.</p><p>First, as early as day 2, C3 deficiency allowed for greater spread of ECTV from the inoculation site to the spleen. This indicates that complement is a key player in the initial hours of infection, likely to control ECTV at the inoculation site. Second, we detected higher levels of viral DNA in the blood on days 4 and 7. Consistent with our in vitro data, these results establish that C3<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice poorly control viral dissemination through the bloodstream. This higher viremia could result from increased replication in tissues and/or decreased clearance of virus from the bloodstream. Third, the liver viral titers on day 7 were &#x0223c;50-fold higher in the C3<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice. The greater viremia likely produced more extensive infection, but a delayed adaptive immune response may also have contributed to this observation. The viral titer correlated with serum levels of ALT, which suggests that ECTV caused hepatic necrosis either directly through lytic infection or indirectly through the antiviral immune response. An inflammatory infiltrate surrounded the necrosis in the C3<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice, which contrasts with susceptible Balb/c mice where necrosis occurs in the absence of a lymphocytic infiltration <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000249-Xu1">&#x0005b;62&#x0005d;</xref>. In summary, we propose that mice lacking C3 have reduced ability to control ECTV locally and in the bloodstream, leading to higher levels of infection and greater tissue damage in the liver.</p><p>Complement could delay viral dissemination by opsonizing and thereby neutralizing virions at the inoculation site or in the circulation and by promoting the inflammatory response including the recruitment of phagocytic cells. To assess if complement could directly neutralize ECTV, we examined the interaction between purified ECTV and mouse complement in vitro. Na&#x000ef;ve plasma or sera neutralized ECTV in a complement-dependent manner, even at a concentration as low as 10&#x00025;. Sera from mice deficient in specific complement components demonstrated that maximal neutralization required both the classical and alternative pathways. &#x003bc;MT sera, lacking antibody, resembled the sera deficient in the classical pathway components, C1q or C4, and addition of a natural antibody source restored neutralization activity. Opsonization led to neutralization of the majority of virus; however, the modest but significant difference between the C5<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> and C5<sup>&#x0002b;/&#x0002b;</sup> sera indicates that the MAC contributed to viral damage. Interestingly, no complement component deficiency tested fully abolished neutralization. The residual activity suggests that the classical and alternative pathways functioned independently, likely because both C4b and C3b opsonized and, consequently, neutralized ECTV. However, the system was most effective when the two pathways and the MAC worked cooperatively.</p><p>The reconstitution of the neutralization activity in the &#x003bc;MT sera with heat-inactivated wild-type sera suggests that natural antibody is important in the neutralization process. Consistent with this observation and prior studies with other viruses <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000249-Jayasekera1">&#x0005b;60&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000249-Ochsenbein2">&#x0005b;61&#x0005d;</xref>, natural antibody passively transferred into &#x003bc;MT mice lengthened survival during the acute infection. In our experiments, most &#x003bc;MT mice died early, with 100&#x00025; mortality by day 9 at the highest inoculum. The mice that survived the acute infection eventually died at &#x0223c;2 months post-infection. Our findings differ from prior studies, which described mortality at either 2&#x02013;4 weeks <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000249-Chaudhri2">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref> or 2 months <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000249-Fang1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref> post-infection. More of our mice survived the acute infection at the lower doses. This suggests that the observed discrepancy could be secondary to differences in the viral stock or dose, as both differed among the three groups. The death of the &#x003bc;MT mice, despite natural antibody treatment, indicates that B cells help control the infection by additional mechanisms.</p><p>Our in vitro experiments provide a model for understanding the fate of the viral inoculum in our in vivo experiments, since they both used the same stock of purified intracellular mature virus (IMV). To understand the spread of infection, a second infectious form must be considered. During viral replication in the host cell, extracellular enveloped virus (EEV) is produced by enveloping the IMV with an additional unique membrane derived from the Golgi complex and late endosomal compartment <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000249-Smith1">&#x0005b;63&#x0005d;</xref>. In studies of vaccinia virus, the host's complement regulators, present in the outermost membrane, protect the EEV from human and rabbit complement; in contrast, the IMV is sensitive to complement <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000249-Vanderplasschen1">&#x0005b;64&#x0005d;</xref>. Our study builds on this observation by determining the contribution of each complement activation pathway to the neutralization of IMV infectivity, and it implicates natural antibody as the primary initiating factor <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000249-Ochsenbein2">&#x0005b;61&#x0005d;</xref>. We also show that natural antibody by itself is ineffective but requires augmentation by the complement system to neutralize ECTV. Additionally, the neutralization observed with vaccinia virus and ECTV points to the IMV form being inherently susceptible to complement-mediated neutralization.</p><p>The relative importance of IMV vs. EEV during infection in vivo is not well established. However, the IMV's sensitivity to complement neutralization suggests that ECTV likely travels through areas featuring efficient complement activation, such as the blood stream, in the EEV form or within infected cells. At extravascular sites, where complement levels are lower than in circulation, infected cells may produce sufficient soluble poxviral complement regulatory protein to protect the IMV.</p><p>Most poxvirus disease models initiate infection with the complement-sensitive IMV. If complement activity in the mouse behaves as it does in vitro, then inoculated ectromelia IMV should be recognized by natural antibody and coated with C4b and C3b, resulting in neutralization of viral infectivity at the site of injection and inhibition of spread. This line of reasoning could explain why the mortality increases in the wild-type mice as the invasiveness of the route decreases <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000249-Schell1">&#x0005b;52&#x0005d;</xref>. Percutaneous inoculation would likely result in neutralization, while application to the mucosal membranes might enable ECTV to enter host cells before being neutralized by complement. Once internalized, ECTV produces its regulatory protein and EEV to evade complement and propagate the infection. Additionally, based on the in vitro data, complement deficiency would greatly limit this initial neutralization, which likely contributes to the early spread and greater mortality observed in the complement-deficient mice.</p><p>A sub-neutralizing concentration of complement opsonins could target the virion for immune adherence and phagocytosis in vivo, particularly in blood with its high complement levels. Furthermore, the liver sinusoids are lined with Kupffer cells bearing CRIg (Complement Receptor of the Ig superfamily), which mediates phagocytosis of C3-opsonized pathogens <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000249-Helmy1">&#x0005b;65&#x0005d;</xref>.

In the following hour, most of the viral antigen in the liver becomes undetectable by immunofluorescence, and viral infectivity decreases by over 90&#x00025;. This rapid removal suggests that the virus has been recognized as foreign and tagged for immune adherence and destruction. Opsonization by complement followed by uptake via the recently described CRIg provides a mechanistic explanation for these important observations made nearly five decades ago <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000249-Mims1">&#x0005b;66&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>These observations influence the interpretation of poxviral infections initiated with an IMV-rich inoculum by the intravenous route. The liver's Kupffer cells may sequester most of the inoculated virus within minutes and destroy much of it within an hour, thereby inhibiting systemic dissemination. Not only is the dose effectively reduced by &#x0223c;10-fold, but the neutralized IMV also provides the immune system with an immediate source of antigen.
