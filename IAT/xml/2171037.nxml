ADP-ribosylation factor-GTPase-activating proteins (ARFGAPs) are proposed to contribute to site-specific regulation. In yeast, two distinct proteins, Glo3p and Gcs1p, together provide overlapping, essential ARFGAP function required for coat protein (COP)-I-dependent trafficking. In mammalian cells, only the Gcs1p orthologue, named ARFGAP1, has been characterized in detail. However, Glo3p is known to make the stronger contribution to COP I traffic in yeast. Here, based on a conserved signature motif close to the carboxy terminus, we identify ARFGAP2 and ARFGAP3 as the human orthologues of yeast Glo3p. By immunofluorescence (IF), ARFGAP2 and ARFGAP3 are closely colocalized with coatomer subunits in NRK cells in the Golgi complex and peripheral punctate structures. In contrast to ARFGAP1, both ARFGAP2 and ARFGAP3 are associated with COP-I-coated vesicles generated from Golgi membranes in the presence of GTP-&#x003b3;-S <italic>in vitro</italic>. ARFGAP2 lacking its zinc finger domain directly binds to coatomer. Expression of this truncated mutant (&#x00394;N-ARFGAP2) inhibits COP-I-dependent Golgi-to-endoplasmic reticulum transport of cholera toxin (CTX-K63) <italic>in vivo.</italic> Silencing of ARFGAP1 or a combination of ARFGAP2 and ARFGAP3 in HeLa cells does not decrease cell viability. However, silencing all three ARFGAPs causes cell death. Our data provide strong evidence that ARFGAP2 and ARFGAP3 function in COP I traffic.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>ARF</kwd><kwd>ARFGAP</kwd><kwd>coated vesicles</kwd><kwd>coatomer</kwd><kwd>COP I</kwd><kwd>Golgi</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><p>Cytoplasmic coat proteins govern the transport of proteins between membrane-bound compartments of the secretory and endocytic pathways by shaping the membrane of the donor organelle into vesicular or tubular transport carriers and selecting appropriate cargo into them (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>). The well-characterized minimal machinery to form coat protein (COP)-I-coated vesicles from Golgi membranes comprises coatomer, a stable heptameric protein complex comprising &#x003b1;-, &#x003b2;-, &#x003b2;&#x02019;-, &#x003b3;-, &#x003b4;-, &#x0025b;- and &#x003b6;-COP, and the small ras-like GTPase ADP-ribosylation factor (ARF) in its GTP-bound form (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>). The GTP/GDP cycle of ARF proteins is regulated by guanine nucleotide exchange factors and GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">(6)</xref>. ARF inactivation by GTP hydrolysis relies on stimulation of a low intrinsic GTPase activity by ARF-GTPase-activating proteins (ARFGAPs). ARFGAPs form a large family of proteins that share a conserved catalytic domain of approximately 70 residues that includes a zinc finger motif, but they differ in their non-catalytic domains (for review see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>). In this pathway, ARFGAP activity triggers uncoating of COP-I-coated vesicles through GTP hydrolysis on ARF, which renders both ARF and coatomer cytosolic <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">(4)</xref>. Interestingly, regulated GTP hydrolysis on ARF is required not only for uncoating but also for cargo selection into COP I vesicles because vesicles produced in the presence of the nonhydrolysable GTP analogue, GTP-&#x003b3;-S, are depleted of protein cargo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>).</p><p>There is good evidence that a single ARF species may have multiple roles and been in different locations in the cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>). It is generally thought that ARFGAPs with restricted cellular localizations will contribute to differential regulation of ARF to enable it to function in this way. In yeast, two ARFGAPs, Gcs1p and Glo3p, provide an overlapping essential function in the COP-I-mediated Golgi-to-endoplasmic reticulum (ER) transport (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>). Several lines of evidence suggest that Glo3p makes the stronger contribution to COP-I-mediated trafficking. glo3&#x00394; mutants display a much stronger retrograde Golgi-to-ER transport defect than gcs1&#x00394; mutants <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">(12)</xref>. Glo3p but not Gcs1p is associated with yeast COP-I-coated vesicles formed <italic>in vitro</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">(14)</xref>. A mutant in <italic>GLO3</italic>, named <italic>ret4-1</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">(13)</xref>, was isolated based on a genetic selection for mutants with defects in dilysine motif-dependent Golgi-to-ER retrieval that had previously identified several coatomer subunits <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">(15)</xref>. Lastly, Nakano&#x02019;s laboratory has recently shown that GLO3 but not GCS1 can suppress the temperature-sensitive (ts)-growth defect of the <italic>arf1-16</italic> and <italic>arf1-17</italic> mutants, which display strong defects in retrograde trafficking for several cargo proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">(16)</xref>. These data provide compelling evidence that Glo3p in yeast has a critical function in COP-I-dependent traffic that cannot be complemented by Gcs1p. We have previously shown that Glo3p but not Gcs1p can interact with yeast coatomer <italic>in vitro</italic>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>). Using the two-hybrid system and <italic>in vitro</italic> binding assays, we demonstrated that this binding occurs via the &#x003b2;&#x02032;- and &#x003b3;-COP subunits of coatomer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>). All these data combined functionally tie in Glo3p tightly with the COP I pathway.</p><p>Surprisingly, in mammalian cells only ARFGAP1, which by sequence analysis can be clearly identified as a Gcs1p orthologue, has been well characterized so far. ARFGAP was the first ARF-directed GAP to be discovered <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">(19)</xref>.

Assays with Golgi membranes and recombinant proteins <italic>in vitro</italic> have suggested that ARFGAP1 is required for COP I vesicle generation, and under certain <italic>in vitro</italic> conditions ARFGAP1 can be observed as a stoichiometric component of the COP I coat, namely in vesicles produced in the presence of GTP rather than GTP-&#x003b3;-S (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>).</p><p>Significantly, however, a <italic>Drosophila</italic> mutant that lacks the fly orthologue of ARFGAP1 encoded by the <italic>Gap69C</italic> gene is viable and fertile <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">(24)</xref>, consistent with the notion that it is not an essential, key component to COP I function and that other, presumably Glo3p-type ARFGAPs can compensate for the loss of ARFGAP1 function in the fly. In this study, we aimed to identify and characterize human Glo3p orthologues.</p><p>Sixteen genes encoding ARFGAPs are found in the human genome. Using a conserved signature motif present in GLO3 proteins from all species, named the Glo3 motif, we unambiguously identify ARFGAP2 and ARFGAP3 as the two human orthologues of yeast Glo3p, and we provide their initial cell biological characterization. ARFGAP1, ARFGAP2 and ARFGAP3 are coexpressed in mammalian cells (e.g. HeLa and NRK cells). Our data strongly suggest that ARFGAP1, ARFGAP2 and ARFGAP3 co-operate to perform essential, overlapping functions in COP-I-mediated trafficking in mammalian cells.</p><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Two human orthologues of yeast Glo3p</title><p>We wished to identify a human orthologue for the yeast ARFGAP Glo3p, which in yeast has been demonstrated to have a prominent role in coatomer-mediated trafficking.

In order to identify a true orthologue of yeast Glo3p, we searched for proteins with sequence similarity beyond the ARFGAP domain. Making use of a Glo3 protein from <italic>Schizosaccharomyces pombe</italic>, we were able to identify a small conserved signature motif, named the Glo3 motif, found in 19 ARFGAP proteins from 14 different species.

Although because of its exceptional quality, the monoclonal antibody against p115 labels a considerably larger number of peripheral structures, the majority of ARFGAP2- or ARFGAP3-positive structures are p115 positive as well. Within the Golgi compartment, there are areas where closer inspection of the patterns suggests that the mammalian ARFGAP2 and ARFGAP3, and p115, respectively, are localized in a closely associated but not identical pattern. This is in clear contrast to these proteins in comparison with subunits of the coatomer complex, where most features within the Golgi complex are labelled in a remarkably identical way.</p><p>Again, this is not the case for ARFGAP2 and ARFGAP3 when compared with the well-characterized early Golgi marker GM130 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">(29)</xref> (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig03">Figures 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig04">4</xref>).

Antibodies against &#x003b3;-COP and &#x003b2;-tubulin were used to confirm equal loading of the samples. In yeast, deletion of either the GLO3 or GCS1 gene results in a relatively mild phenotype. However, deletion of both genes is lethal. Therefore, we tested the effect on cell survival of an RNAi-oligo-mediated knock-down of ARFGAP1, ARFGAP2 and ARFGAP3 either in pairs or as a combined triple knock-down (see <italic>Materials and Methods</italic> for details). No significant cell death was observed in single knock-downs or in any pairwise knock-down, compared with cells transfected with a control oligo.

In yeast, the two ARFGAPs Glo3p and Gcs1p together provide an overlapping, essential function in COP-I-dependent membrane traffic. In mammalian cells, only the Gcs1p orthologue, ARFGAP1 has been characterized so far. In this study, we provide an initial cell biological characterization of two recently identified human ARFGAPs, ARFGAP2 and ARFGAP3. We unambiguously demonstrate by sequence analysis that they are the human orthologues of yeast Glo3p, through the presence of a conserved &#x02018;signature&#x02019; motif at the carboxy terminus, the Glo3 motif. Using novel antibodies, we demonstrate that they are localized to the Golgi complex and peripheral punctate structures scattered throughout the cytoplasm in NRK cells. Both ARFGAP2 and ARFGAP3 significantly colocalize with COP I subunits in both locations, strongly suggesting that they are associated with COP I on both ERGIC/VTC structures and at the Golgi complex. Here we further show that both ARFGAP2 and ARFGAP3 are associated with COP I vesicles produced <italic>in vitro</italic> in the presence of the non-hydrolysable GTP analogue, GTP-&#x003b3;-S.</p><p>The Golgi and VTC localization of ARFGAP2 and ARFGAP3 appears to be dynamic, as treatment with brefeldin A (BFA) rapidly renders their localization completely diffuse-cytoplasmic within 2&#x02013;5 min of adding the drug, with kinetics very similar to those of &#x003b2;-COP and ARFGAP1 (unpublished data). Similarly, re-recruitment of ARFGAP2 and ARFGAP3 to Golgi membranes occurs rapidly upon washout of the drug. Future experiments will need to address the dynamics of ARFGAP2/3 using live cell imaging approaches, similar to detailed analysis that has been reported for ARFGAP1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">(20)</xref>.</p><p>The Nakano group has recently reported that Glo3p but not Gcs1p can suppress arf-Ts mutants with a severe defect in Golgi-to-ER retrieval in an allele-specific manner <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">(16)</xref>. They found that the Glo3 motif is required for suppression of the growth defect of <italic>arf1-16</italic> and <italic>arf1-17</italic>, suggesting that the motif is important for Glo3p function <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">(16)</xref>.</p><p>We had previously shown that ARFGAP2, and more weakly ARFGAP3, can interact with recombinant carboxy terminal &#x003b3;-COP &#x02018;ear&#x02019; domain in pull-down experiments from rat liver cytosol <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">(18)</xref>. Furthermore, we could show this interaction is likely to be physiologically important, as plasmid-driven overexpression of the &#x003b3;-COP &#x02018;ear&#x02019; domain in NRK cells disrupted the Golgi localization of ARFGAP2, whereas a point mutant version of the &#x003b3;-COP &#x02018;ear&#x02019; domain (W776S) in which the binding site to ARFGAP2 is abrogated had no effect <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">(18)</xref>. Here we show that the catalytic domain of ARFGAP2 and ARFGAP3 is not required for <italic>in vitro</italic> interactions with mammalian coatomer. The same phenomenon was observed for their yeast counterpart Glo3p in binding experiments using yeast cytosol. It has recently been shown that ARFGAP1 can also directly interact, albeit more weakly, with coatomer. However, this interaction involves two distinct binding sites on ARFGAP1, one in its catalytic domain and the other in the non-catalytic region (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>). Using the two-hybrid system, we were unable to detect interactions of Gcs1 or ARFGAP1 with yeast or mammalian coatomer subunits, respectively, whereas we observed strong interactions of Glo3p as well as ARFGAP2 and ARFGAP3 with coatomer subunits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>, unpublished data). We show that in the presence of GTP-&#x003b3;-S, ARFGAP2 and ARFGAP3 are able to associate with COP-I-coated vesicles whereas ARFGAP1 is barely detectable.</p><p>In most mammalian cells there are six ARFs, of which ARF1 is the most extensively studied. It has been implicated in Golgi-to-ER transport, function of the Golgi, transport from the trans-Golgi network, transport in the endocytic pathway and recruitment of paxillin to focal adhesions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">(7)</xref>. Because in mammalian genomes the number of proteins with an ARFGAP domain is considerably larger than the number of ARF proteins, it has been suggested that a number of GAPs might regulate the activities of ARF1 in a location-dependent manner.</p><p>The observed interaction of Glo3p-type ARFGAPs, namely Glo3p in yeast and ARFGAP2 and ARFGAP3 in mammals, with coatomer subunits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>; this study) may thus enable regulation of aspects of the COP I vesicle cycle, such as cargo sorting, coat formation, membrane deformation or uncoating, which may enable regulation of traffic at different intracellular sites and at specific intracellular sites. It is perhaps surprising, given the strong direct interactions of ARFGAP2 and ARFGAP3 with coatomer, that these proteins were not previously identified in purified COP I vesicle populations. Apparently, in isolated COP-I-coated vesicles produced in the presence of GTP-&#x003b3;-S (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref>; this study), neither ARFGAP2 nor ARFGAP3 are stoichiometric coat components.</p><p>There are precedents for specific interactions of ARFGAPs with other coat proteins. For example, it has been shown that AGAP1 can directly interact with the Golgi/endosome-localized AP-3 adaptor but not with the closely related AP-2 adaptor involved in endocytosis from the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref>). The related AGAP2 interacts specifically with the AP-1 adaptor to regulate trafficking from recycling endosomes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">(35)</xref> but not with AP-2. The functional significance of the direct interactions of ARFGAP2 and ARFGAP3 with coatomer with regard to protein sorting into COP I vesicles and the regulation of uncoating once the vesicles are fully assembled needs to be addressed in future experiments.</p><p>In yeast, Glo3p and Gcs1p provide an essential, overlapping function for COP-I-mediated transport <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">(12)</xref>. However, growing evidence suggests that while Gcs1p is able to maintain ARF1-regulated membrane traffic in several transport steps, Age2p and Glo3p are specialized for a transport step out of the TGN <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">(36)</xref> and COP-I-mediated transport, respectively <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">(12)</xref>. Our <italic>in vivo</italic> data demonstrate that ARFGAP2 is involved in the COP-I-dependent Golgi-to-ER transport of a model cargo, cholera toxin.</p><p>We show here that a combined knock-down of ARFGAP1, ARFGAP2 and ARFGAP3 using siRNAs is lethal in HeLa and NRK cells. Thus, our data strongly suggest that, similar to the situation yeast, Gcs1p-type and Glo3p-type ARFGAPs together provide an essential function for COP-I-mediated transport.
