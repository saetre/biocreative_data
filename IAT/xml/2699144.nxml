However, the molecular mechanism underlying the coordination remains largely unknown. In this study, we investigate how the cell cycle coordinates gastrulation cell movements in zebrafish. We present a system to modulate the cell cycle in early zebrafish embryos by manipulating the geminin-Cdt1 balance. Alterations of the cell cycle change the apoptotic level during gastrulation, which correlates with the nuclear level of antiapoptotic nuclear factor &#x003ba;B (NF-&#x003ba;B). NF-&#x003ba;B associates with the <italic>Snail1a</italic> promoter region on the chromatin and directly activates Snail1a, an important factor controlling cell delamination, which is the initial step of mesendodermal cell movements during gastrulation. In effect, the cell cycle coordinates the delamination of mesendodermal cells through the transcription of <italic>Snail1a</italic>. Our results suggest a molecular mechanism by which NF-&#x003ba;B and Snail1a coordinate the cell cycle through gastrulation.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p>During the developmental transition from a single-celled zygote to a mature biological organism, numerous cell division and differentiation events take place, resulting in embryonic growth and the formation of different tissues. Cell differentiation and tissue formation must be coordinated with the cell cycle to guarantee correct spatial and temporal generation of the body plan as well as functional organs. Gastrulation is an early developmental process leading to formation of three germ layers, endoderm, mesoderm, and ectoderm, involving a series of cellular movements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Stern, 2004</xref>). In zebrafish, gastrulation starts with internalization of mesendodermal progenitors in the dorsal/axial regions of the germ ring by single-cell delamination. Then, the delaminated cells start to migrate underneath the epiblast toward the animal pole as well as the midline, thus forming the mesendodermal cell layer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Warga and Kimmel, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Montero and Heisenberg, 2004</xref>).</p><p>Snail, a zinc finger transcriptional repressor, is important for cell delamination and migration, which are critical mesendodermal cell movement events during gastrulation. Both <italic>Drosophila snail</italic> mutants and zebrafish embryos injected with a morpholino oligo against <italic>Snail1a</italic> (Snail1aMO) display severe defects in gastrulation cell movements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Ip and Gridley, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Yamashita et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Blanco et al., 2007</xref>). In <italic>Drosophila</italic>, Snail is activated by Twist, a basic helix-loop-helix transcription activator, and Dorsal, a maternal transcription factor that is the <italic>Drosophila</italic> homologue of the vertebrate nuclear factor &#x003ba;B (NF-&#x003ba;B) subunit p65/RelA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Jiang et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Ip et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Ip and Gridley, 2002</xref>).</p><p>After dissociation from the inhibitory I&#x003ba;B/cactus and subsequent nuclear translocation, NF-&#x003ba;B can activate not only <italic>Snail</italic> but also antiapoptotic factors like the Bcl-2 family in response to apoptotic stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Zong et al., 1999</xref>). In most vertebrates, including zebrafish, apoptosis is not seen before gastrulation but thereafter plays a major role in shaping and sculpting the embryo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Negron and Lockshin, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Penaloza et al., 2006</xref>). The nearly simultaneous appearance of apoptosis and gastrulation cell movements implies a possible molecular link between these two events. Actually, inhibition of NF-&#x003ba;B function with dominant-negative I&#x003ba;B&#x003b1; in zebrafish leads to defective notochord development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Correa et al., 2004</xref>).</p><p>Cdt1, a DNA replication initiation factor, is required for loading of the minichromosome maintenance (MCM) complex onto chromatin to assemble the prereplicative complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Bell and Dutta, 2002</xref>). Once the DNA replication is initiated, DNA replication must remain inhibited within the same cell cycle to maintain the genetic stability of an organism. Geminin accumulates in the nucleus from early S phase to the end of mitosis and directly binds to Cdt1, sequestering Cdt1 from binding to the MCM complex and DNA, and preventing resynthesis of DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">McGarry and Kirschner, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Wohlschlegel et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Tada et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Yanagi et al., 2002</xref>). In higher eukaryotes, geminin serves as a major DNA replication safeguard (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Melixetian and Helin, 2004</xref>), and the balance between geminin and Cdt1 levels is critical for cell cycle control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Saxena and Dutta, 2005</xref>). In <italic>Xenopus laevis</italic> egg extracts, the stoichiometry of the Cdt1-geminin balance regulates its activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Lutzmann et al., 2006</xref>).</p><p>Progression through the cell cycle is incompatible with certain types of cell behavior like cell migration, adhesion, and changes in cell shape. In <italic>Drosophila</italic>, a serine/threonine kinase, Tribbles, inhibits the cell cycle in the prospective mesoderm by counteracting the activity of the protein phosphatase Cdc25/String. This Snail-dependent cell cycle inhibition allows cell shape changes important for mesodermal development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Grosshans and Wieschaus, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Seher and Leptin, 2000</xref>). However, the molecular mechanism underlying the coordination of the cell cycle with gastrulation is unclear. In this study, we establish a system to modulate the cell cycle in early zebrafish embryos by manipulating the geminin-Cdt1 balance. Modulations of the cell cycle in gastrulating embryos alters patterns of apoptosis, which further corresponds to abnormal activation of NF-&#x003ba;B that has an antiapoptotic function. The abnormal level of nuclear and active NF-&#x003ba;B alters the transcription of <italic>Snail1a</italic>, thus leading to defects in cell delamination at the marginal zone. Because it is the initial step of mesendodermal cell movements during gastrulation, defective cell delamination results in aberrant mesendodermal cell movements. Our results suggest a mechanism underlying the coordination of the cell cycle with mesendodermal cell movements during gastrulation, involving apoptosis, NF-&#x003ba;B, and Snail1a.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec><title>The cell cycle is modulated by manipulation of the geminin-Cdt1 balance</title><p>To investigate the mechanism underlying coordination of the cell cycle with gastrulation, we first established a tool to manipulate the cell cycle in gastrulating embryos. cDNAs encoding zebrafish geminin and Cdt1 were isolated using cDNA prepared from the shield stage zebrafish embryos. Zebrafish Cdt1 has 678 amino acids with 49%, 41%, and 42% respective identity to the proteins in <italic>Xenopus</italic>, mouse, and human, whereas zebrafish geminin consists of 241 amino acids with 54%, 46%, 39%, and 39% identity to geminin proteins in medaka, <italic>Xenopus</italic>, mouse, and human, respectively (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200806074/DC1">Fig. S1, A and B</ext-link>). At the shield stage, geminin transcripts were uniformly detected, whereas Cdt1 was more enriched in the dorsal region of the embryo (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200806074/DC1">Fig. S2</ext-link>), suggesting that cells in the dorsal region might possess higher proliferative activity.</p><p>Overexpression and knockdown of geminin in medaka fish were previously reported to decrease and increase the number of mitotically active cells, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Del Bene et al., 2004</xref>). To analyze the effect of manipulating the geminin-Cdt1 balance on the cell cycle in gastrulating zebrafish embryos, geminin and Cdt1 levels were altered by mRNA overexpression or knockdown with specific antisense morpholino oligos (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200806074/DC1">Fig. S3 A</ext-link>, GemMO and Cdt1MO). Mitotically active cells were marked using antibodies against phosphorylated histone 3 (H3P) at the shield stage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1, A&#x02013;E</xref>). In contrast to embryos injected with a control morpholino (ConMO), injection of GemMO or <italic>Cdt1</italic> mRNA increased the number of mitotically active cells. On the contrary, geminin overexpression or Cdt1 knockdown decreased the number of mitotically active cells. To investigate whether these effects on the cell cycle were dependent on direct interaction of geminin and Cdt1, a full-length mutated geminin (Gem*), in which five highly conserved amino acids responsible for Cdt1 interaction (Fig. S1 B, asterisks; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Lee et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Saxena et al., 2004</xref>) were mutated to alanine, was constructed (Fig. S3 B). The number of H3P-positive cells in embryos injected with <italic>Gem*</italic> mRNA was similar to that in the control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 F</xref>). Knockdown of another cell cycle regulator, MCM protein 5 (MCM5), a subunit of the MCM complex that is required for the assembly of the prereplication complex, resulted in a decreased number of H3P-positive cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 G</xref>). Knockdown of p21, a CDK inhibitor, offered a completely different means to modulate the cell cycle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 H</xref>). Similar cell cycle regulatory effects were observed in the 70% epiboly and 90% epiboly stage embryos when the geminin&#x02013;Cdt1 balance was manipulated (not depicted). These results indicate that the balanced interaction of geminin and Cdt1 is critical for cell cycle regulation, such that perturbation of the balance allows positive and negative modulations of the cell cycle in gastrulating embryos.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p><bold>Manipulations of the geminin&#x02013;Cdt1 balance, MCM5, or p21 function result in modulations of the cell cycle.</bold> (A&#x02013;F) Geminin and Cdt1 reciprocally direct the cell cycle.

In contrast to the control prechordal mesendodermal cells that migrated anteriorly to the animal pole, migration of cells with decreased geminin expression was strongly delayed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 J</xref>). This mispositioning of prechordal plate cells coincided with the shortened anterior-posterior axis at the bud stage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 B</xref>) and cyclopia/synophthalmia or decreased interoptic distance phenotypes at 36 h postfertilization (hpf) in embryos injected with GemMO (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200806074/DC1">Fig. S4</ext-link>).

If the cell cycle of donor cells was modulated by injection of p21MO, delayed movements of transplanted cells were also observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 O</xref>). Collectively, these data suggest that alterations of the cell cycle change mesendodermal cell movements during gastrulation.</p><p>Cell delamination is the initial step of mesendodermal cell movements during gastrulation. To test whether modulations of the cell cycle change mesendodermal cell movements during delamination, cell delamination within the embryonic shield and subsequent movements were visualized by live cell imaging. In embryos injected with ConMO, cells delaminated and moved toward both the epiblast layer and the animal pole (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200806074/DC1">Video 1</ext-link> and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200806074/DC1">Table S1</ext-link>). In contrast, although cells within the delamination region in embryos injected with GemMO still moved toward the epiblast layer at a reduced velocity, many of them could not efficiently delaminate and thus moved toward the vegetal pole together with the epiblasts (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200806074/DC1">Video 2</ext-link> and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200806074/DC1">Table S2</ext-link>).

The activity of geminin is strictly controlled in different cell cycle phases. In early S phase when DNA replication is initiated, active geminin accumulates in the nucleus to bind to Cdt1 and inhibit DNA resynthesis. The presence of nuclear geminin is maintained until the end of mitosis, during which geminin is inactivated through various mechanisms such as degradation, transient polyubiquitination, and nuclear export to release Cdt1 and license the next round of the cell cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">McGarry and Kirschner, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Wohlschlegel et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Li and Blow, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Luo et al., 2007</xref>).

The competition between geminin&#x02013;Cdt1 and geminin&#x02013;homeodomain interactions suggests that geminin could function as a molecular link between the cell cycle and cell differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Del Bene et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Li and Rosenfeld, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Luo and Kessel, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Luo et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Pitulescu et al., 2005</xref>). However, this competition does not seem to regulate mesendodermal cell delamination and movements addressed here. Among Hox proteins expressed during gastrulation in zebrafish, only Hoxb1b was found able to directly bind to geminin (unpublished data). In the gastrulating zebrafish embryo, <italic>Hoxb1b</italic> is expressed in the presumptive hindbrain, whereas <italic>Six3</italic> is expressed in the anterior presumptive neural plate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Hong et al., 2008</xref>). As neither is expressed in the marginal zone or in mesendodermal cells, they lack the spatial capability to regulate mesendodermal cell movements. In this study, we took advantage of the cell cycle controlling geminin&#x02013;Cdt1 balance to establish a system to manipulate the cell cycle in early zebrafish embryos. Stable changes of the number of mitotically active cells at different time points of gastrulation (shield, 70% epiboly, and 90% epiboly; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1, A&#x02013;H</xref>, and not depicted) indicated the ability to positively or negatively manipulate the cell cycle in gastrulating embryos. Similar cell cycle regulatory effects were also observed at later stages in the medaka fish (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Del Bene et al., 2004</xref>). In the medaka fish, injection of <italic>geminin</italic> mRNA has been shown to lead to cyclopia/synophthalmia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Del Bene et al., 2004</xref>), which were phenotypes resulting from GemMO injection in our work. However, these data are not contradictory. Two eye fields are separated by the prechordal plate mesodermal tissue. In embryos injected with either GemMO or <italic>geminin</italic> mRNA, gastrulation movements of prechordal plate cells are both defective (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2, C&#x02013;E, J, and N</xref>).</p><p>In this study, reciprocal changes between the number of mitotically active cells and that of apoptotic cells were observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figs. 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3</xref>). However, this reciprocal change could not be seen after gastrulation. Embryos injected with either GemMO or Cdt1MO, either geminin <italic>mRNA</italic> or <italic>Cdt1</italic> mRNA, all revealed an increased apoptosis at the 18 somite stage (not depicted). Similarly, embryos injected with p21MO showed a decreased number of H3P-positive cells and an increased number of apoptotic cells at the somitogenesis stage (not depicted). Two reasons could explain this discrepancy. First, it could be that after trying to keep pace with and adjust the cellular program to compensate for an abnormal cell cycle during gastrulation, cells positioned within the incorrect developmental context and with an altered intracellular program undergo apoptosis to protect the overall shape of the embryo. Alternatively, the molecular coordination between the cell cycle, apoptosis, and cell movements is perhaps not absolutely required and could potentially switch to another regulatory mechanism after gastrulation. Therefore, the mitotic and apoptotic indices may not be coordinated in developmental stages after gastrulation.</p><p>Apoptosis is only observed after gastrulation in most vertebrates, and subsequently, a proper level of apoptosis is critical for embryonic development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Negron and Lockshin, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Penaloza et al., 2006</xref>). Our data suggest an explanation for why apoptosis only begins after gastrulation. A proper level of apoptosis is a determinant for the level of nuclear active NF-&#x003ba;B that is in turn required for Snail1a activation and cell delamination. To correctly regulate apoptosis, antiapoptotic machinery including the nuclear active NF-&#x003ba;B must be adjusted to compensate for ectopic or insufficient apoptosis caused by modulations of the cell cycle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4</xref>). The dual function of NF-&#x003ba;B is important for the coordination of the cell cycle with mesendodermal cell movements. NF-&#x003ba;B both activates antiapoptotic factors in response to apoptosis and activates <italic>Snail1a</italic> transcription, which is critical for mesendodermal cell delamination. Snail1a was proven to be the key coordinator downstream of NF-&#x003ba;B because it could rescue both delayed cell movements in the cotransplantation assay and defective distribution of mesendodermal cells caused by GemMO (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 Q</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6 K</xref>).</p><p>Mesendodermal cell movements are initiated by a cell delamination process followed by cell migration. <italic>Snail1a</italic> was previously reported to be expressed in the marginal zone that is the delaminating region, the adaxial cells, and the yolk syncitial layer, but not in the migrating mesendodermal cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Blanco et al., 2007</xref>). Our cotransplantation data showed that the cell cycle cell autonomously coordinated with cell movements (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2, J, N, and O</xref>), whereas Snail1a was able to cell autonomously rescue the defective movements caused by the cell cycle modulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 Q</xref>). In addition, our time lapse videos clearly indicated defective cell delamination caused by GemMO (Videos 1 and 2). Therefore, we conclude that cell delamination is one of the steps at which the cell cycle coordinates mesendodermal cell movements. Nevertheless, it is also possible that modulations of the cell cycle change the expression of Snail1a in the yolk syncitial layer, thus contributing partially to the defective mesendodermal cell movements in a cell nonautonomous way.</p><p>Injection of <italic>geminin</italic> mRNA and Cdt1MO result in similar cell cycle alteration phenotypes. Although their phenotype of <italic>gsc</italic> transcription at the 80% epiboly stage at first appeared distinct (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2, E and G</xref>), both injections actually resulted in similar <italic>gsc</italic> phenotypes. Although injection of Cdt1MO led to an expansion of <italic>gsc</italic> transcription (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 G</xref>) or an increased tendency for dispersion, the phenotype resulting from <italic>geminin</italic> mRNA presented a bona fide dispersion of cells, thus losing their identity as axial prechordal plate precursors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2, E and N</xref>). This assumption was further proven by the injection of a lower concentration of <italic>geminin</italic> mRNA, which led to an expansion of <italic>gsc</italic> similar to embryos injected with Cdt1MO (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2, F and G</xref>).</p><p>In <italic>Drosophila</italic>, the cell cycle of mesodermal progenitors needs to be inhibited to allow the cell shape changes and mesodermal development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Grosshans and Wieschaus, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Seher and Leptin, 2000</xref>). In this study, we showed similar results in zebrafish. An artificial positive modulation of the cell cycle by GemMO, <italic>Cdt1</italic> mRNA, or p21MO led to delayed or reduced distribution of mesendodermal cells, and a negative modulation of the cell cycle led to ectopic distribution or dispersion of mesendodermal cells during gastrulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6</xref>). If distributions of Casanova-expressing endodermal cells were recovered during gastrulation, the neural markers were restored even though ectodermal geminin was still absent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig. 7, G&#x02013;N</xref>). This result suggests that the previously reported regulatory role of geminin on neural development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Kroll et al., 1998</xref>) may act, at least partially, as a secondary effect of mesendodermal cell movements.</p><p>In summary, we propose that in gastrulating embryos, cell cycle progression correlates with the level of apoptosis, which coincides to the correct activity of antiapoptotic machineries, including the nuclear level of active NF-&#x003ba;B.
