The elucidation of repair mechanisms for 5-foU will yield important insights into the biological consequences of the lesion. Recently, we reported that 5-foU is recognized and removed from DNA by <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> enzymes Nth (endonuclease III), Nei (endonuclease VIII) and MutM (formamidopyrimidine DNA glycosylase). Human cells have been shown to have enzymatic activities that release 5-foU from X-ray-irradiated DNA, but the molecular identities of these activities are not yet known. In this study, we demonstrate that human hNTH1 (endonuclease III homolog) has a DNA glycosylase&#x0002f;AP lyase activity that recognizes 5-foU in DNA and removes it. hNTH1 cleaved 5-foU-containing duplex oligonucleotides via a &#x003b2;-elimination reaction. It formed Schiff base intermediates with 5-foU-containing oligonucleotides. Furthermore, hNTH1 cleaved duplex oligonucleotides containing all of the 5-foU&#x0002f;N pairs (N &#x0003d; G, A, T or C). The specific activities of hNTH1 for cleavage of oligonucleotides containing 5-foU and thymine glycol were 0.011 and 0.045 nM&#x0002f;min&#x0002f;ng protein, respectively. These results indicate that hNTH1 has DNA glycosylase activity with the potential to recognize 5-foU in DNA and remove it in human cells.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are generated in living cells during normal cellular metabolism and in response to exogenous inducers such as ionizing radiation and chemical oxidants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf460c1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf460c2">2</xref>). ROS cause oxidative base damage to DNA and produce a wide variety of base modifications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf460c3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf460c4">4</xref>). Certain types of oxidized bases, such as thymine glycol (Tg) and 7,8-dihydro-8-oxoguanine, are cytotoxic and mutagenic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf460c3">3</xref>). Cells have repair mechanisms that prevent the cell death and mutation caused by oxidative DNA damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf460c5">5</xref>). In most organisms, oxidative damage in DNA is primarily repaired by the base excision repair systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf460c3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf460c6">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf460c8">8</xref>).</p><p>Exposure of DNA to ionizing radiation or chemical oxidants leads to the formation of several thymine hydroperoxides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf460c9">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf460c11">11</xref>). 5-Hydroperoxymethyluracil spontaneously decomposes to form 5-formyluracil (5-foU) and 5-hydroxymethyluracil (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf460c9">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf460c11">11</xref>). Recent studies revealed that 5-foU is a potentially mutagenic lesion. Kasai and co-workers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf460c12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf460c13">13</xref>) found that 5-formyl-2&#x02032;-deoxyuridine (5-fodUrd) is mutagenic to bacterial cells when added to the culture medium. Recently we found that the mutation frequency of plasmid pSVK3 containing site-specifically incorporated 5-foU is significantly increased compared with that of a normal T&#x0002f;A-containing plasmid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf460c14">14</xref>). In addition, Klungland <italic>et al</italic>. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf460c15">15</xref>) showed that the addition of 5-foU or 5-fodUrd to the culture medium promoted mutagenicity at the <italic>hprt</italic> locus in Chinese hamster fibroblast cells. It is inferred that 5-foU is incorporated into DNA and has base pairing properties different from thymine. These conclusions are supported by the findings that 5-fodUrd is incorporated into the DNA during cell growth and forms mispairs with G, C and T during DNA replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf460c16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf460c17">17</xref>). In fact, it directs misincorporation of mismatched bases opposite the lesion during DNA synthesis <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf460c18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf460c19">19</xref>).</p><p>It has been reported that <italic>Escherichia coil</italic> AlkA protein removes 5-foU from DNA <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf460c20">20</xref>). Furthermore, we recently found that <italic>E.coli</italic> enzymes Nth (endonuclease III), Nei (endonuclease VIII) and MutM form Schiff base intermediates with oligonucleotides containing 5-foU and cleave the strand at the 5-foU site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf460c21">21</xref>). These proteins coordinately prevent mutations caused by 5-foU (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf460c21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf460c22">22</xref>). There are some indications that mammalian cells have similar enzymatic activities that release 5-foU from oxidized DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf460c23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf460c24">24</xref>). However, the molecular nature of these activities has not been elucidated. The base excision repair system is highly conserved from bacteria to humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf460c3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf460c6">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf460c8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf460c25">25</xref>). Functional homologs of bacterial DNA glycosylases that act on oxidized bases have been identified in various kinds of eukaryotes. In humans, hOgg1 (8-oxoguanine DNA glycosylase), hMPG (<italic>N</italic>-alkylpurine glycosylase) and hNTH1 (endonuclease III homolog) show overlapping substrate specificity with <italic>E.coli</italic> MutM, AlkA and Nth, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf460c3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf460c6">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf460c8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf460c25">25</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf460c27">27</xref>). Recently, Hazra <italic>et al</italic>. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf460c28">28</xref>) reported the presence of two human orthologs of the <italic>E.coli nei</italic> gene in the human genome database and characterized one of their products. Based on the substrate preference, they named it NEH1 (Nei homolog). The wild-type recombinant NEH1, purified to homogeneity from <italic>E.coli</italic>, excises formamidopyrimidines from damaged DNA and 8-oxoguanine and oxidized pyrimidines, such as thymine glycol, from oligonucleotides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf460c28">28</xref>).</p><p>hNTH1 has a molecular mass of 36 kDa and is encoded by a gene located in chromosomal region 16p13.3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf460c29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf460c30">30</xref>). The helix&#x02013;hairpin&#x02013;helix motif, &#x0005b;4Fe-4S&#x0005d; cluster and lysine residue that is necessary for the formation of the Schiff base intermediate are conserved between the bacterial and human proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf460c29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf460c30">30</xref>). In addition, both proteins recognize similar substrates, Tg, dihydrouracil and 5-hydroxycytosine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf460c3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf460c31">31</xref>). These facts led us to examine whether this protein has a DNA glycosylase activity that recognizes and removes 5-foU from DNA. In this report, we show that hNTH1 has 5-foU DNA glycosylase activity. Purified recombinant hNTH1 formed a Schiff base intermediate with a 5-foU-containing oligonucleotide and cleaved it by &#x003b2;-elimination. In addition, hNTH1 excised oligonucleotides containing all 5-foU&#x0002f;N pairs (N &#x0003d; G, A, T or C), indicating that the enzyme recognizes the lesion 5-foU. This is the first identification of a human protein that has 5-foU DNA glycosylase activity.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Enzymes and chemicals</title><p>Phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, osmium tetroxide and NaBH<sub>4</sub> were purchased from Wako Pure Chemicals (Osaka, Japan).

The GST&#x02013;hNTH1 fusion protein (band A) was subsequently cleaved by thrombin to isolate the wild-type hNTH1. We observed two polypeptides of &#x0223c;36 and 34 kDa in addition to GST in the thrombin digest, indicating that thrombin cleaved at two sites in the fusion protein. Ikeda <italic>et al</italic>. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf460c29">29</xref>) showed that the 34 kDa protein is a truncated form of hNTH1 lacking 22 residues at the N-terminus. We isolated the full-length (band B) and truncated (band C) proteins by chromatography on a Mono S column (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf460f1">1</xref>). The full-length and truncated hNTH1 proteins were eluted with 390 and 470 mM NaCl, respectively. Since the truncated hNTH1 protein showed much higher 5-foU-containing oligonucleotide cleaving activity, we used the truncated form of hNTH1 for further experiments.</p><p>We performed the DNA glycosylase&#x0002f;AP lyase assay as follows. <sup>32</sup>P-labeled oligonucleotide containing 5-foU or T was annealed to the complementary strand to construct 5-foU&#x0002f;A or T&#x0002f;A base pair-containing duplex oligonucleotides, respectively. Each duplex oligonucleotide was incubated with the recombinant hNTH1 and then the reaction mixtures were electrophoresed on denaturing polyacrylamide gels.

The oligonucleotide containing a T&#x0002f;A base pair was not cleaved by these proteins. Prolonged incubation for 1 h with 24 ng hNTH1 did not cleave the T&#x0002f;A-containing oligonucleotides (data not shown). Sometimes the &#x003b2;-elimination products generated by AP lyases, e.g. endonuclease III, give rise to several separate bands in PAGE analysis, presumably because of Tris adduct formation and&#x0002f;or isomerization of the 3&#x02032;-hydroxypentenal terminus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf460c21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf460c29">29</xref>). These results indicate that hNTH1 has DNA glycosylase activity specific for 5-foU. The mobility of the cleavage product revealed that the enzyme cleaves the 5-foU-containing oligonucleotide by a &#x003b2;-elimination reaction.</p><p>It is known that hNTH1 forms a Schiff base intermediate with substrate DNA and subsequently cleaves the phosphodiester backbone of DNA via a &#x003b2;-elimination reaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf460c3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf460c6">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf460c8">8</xref>).

These results suggest that 5-foU&#x0002f;N (N &#x0003d; G, A, T or C) pairs are formed during DNA replication in <italic>E.coli</italic> cells. Therefore, we examined whether hNTH1 can recognize 5-foU in all types of base pairs in the substrate DNA. As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf460f4">4</xref>, hNTH1 cleaved oligonucleotides containing 5-foU&#x0002f;G, 5-foU&#x0002f;A, 5-foU&#x0002f;T and 5-foU&#x0002f;C, whereas none of the substrates containing T&#x0002f;G, A, T and C pairs were cleaved. These results indicate that hNTH1 does not recognize the 5-foU&#x0002f;N mismatches but the lesion itself in DNA. Next, we quantified the intensity of each band and calculated the initial velocity of the cleavage reaction (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf460f4">4</xref>B). Depending on the base paired with 5-foU, the activity of hNTH1 for 5-foU varied from 0.011 to 0.02 nM&#x0002f;min&#x0002f;ng protein.

It has been shown that 5-foU in DNA is mutagenic to <italic>E.coli</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf460c12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf460c13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf460c15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf460c21">21</xref>). To prevent mutations induced by 5-foU in DNA, proteins AlkA, MutM, Nth and Nei recognize and remove the lesion from DNA in <italic>E.coli</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf460c21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf460c22">22</xref>). Mammalian cells also possess DNA glycosylase activities that remove 5-foU from DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf460c23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf460c24">24</xref>). In this study, we have shown that hNTH1, a human endonuclease III homolog, recognizes and cleaves duplex oligonucleotides containing a 5-foU (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf460f2">2</xref>A). The specific activities of cleavage of DNA containing 5-foU and Tg were 0.011 and 0.045 nM&#x0002f;min&#x0002f;ng protein, respectively. Thus, hNTH1 shows 4-fold higher efficiency for Tg than 5-foU in DNA (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf460f3">3</xref>). Dizdaroglu <italic>et al</italic>. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf460c39">39</xref>) reported that <italic>k</italic><sub>cat</sub> values for the removal of damaged bases from oxidized DNA by hNTH1 vary by an order of magnitude. In addition, with defined oligonucleotide substrates <italic>E.coli</italic> Nth recognizes Tg with about 5-, 7-, 10- and 50-fold higher efficiency than uracil glycol, 5-hydroxycytosine, dihydrothymine and 5-hydroxyuracil, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf460c39">39</xref>). From these results we conclude that 5-foU is a major substrate of hNTH1.</p><p>DNA glycosylases are divided into two groups: monofunctional and bifunctional DNA glycosylases. Monofunctional DNA glycosylases have only DNA glycosylase activity, whereas bifunctional DNA glycosylases possess both DNA glycosylase and AP lyase activity, by which they cleave the phosphodiester backbone in DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf460c3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf460c5">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf460c8">8</xref>). In the case of bifunctional DNA glycosylases, a nucleophilic amino group derived from the protein displaces the base, forming a protonated Schiff base intermediate, and subsequently the DNA strand is cleaved as a result of &#x003b2;-elimination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf460c3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf460c6">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf460c8">8</xref>). Some of these enzymes catalyze a subsequent &#x003b4;-elimination reaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf460c3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf460c6">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf460c8">8</xref>). <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> Nth and human hNTH1 are bifunctional DNA glycosylases which catalyze &#x003b2;-elimination reactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf460c29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf460c40">40</xref>). In this study, we have shown that hNTH1 cleaves the DNA strand via a &#x003b2;-elimination reaction, as does <italic>E.coli</italic> endonuclease III (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf460f2">2</xref>A), and forms a Schiff base intermediate with the substrate oligonucleotides (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf460f2">2</xref>B and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf460f5">5</xref>). These reactions were catalyzed by hNTH1 for all substrates containing 5-foU&#x0002f;N. Since T&#x0002f;N mismatched base pairs were not recognized by hNTH1, we conclude that hNTH1 does not recognize mismatched base pairs but rather the lesion 5-foU as an oxidized pyrimidine in DNA.</p><p>Both the 5-foU residue in template DNA and 5-formyl-dUTP added to the culture medium cause mutations <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf460c11">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf460c19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf460c21">21</xref>). Thus, it is likely that 5-foU in DNA is paired with bases other than A in <italic>E.coli</italic> cells. The present experimental results indicate that hNTH1 can remove 5-foU from DNA containing 5-foU&#x0002f;N mismatched base pairs (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf460f4">4</xref>). The initial velocities (<italic>V</italic><sub>0</sub>) for hNTH1 indicate the following preferences: Tg&#x0002f;A (relative <italic>V</italic><sub>0</sub> &#x0003d; 1) &#x0003e; 5-foU&#x0002f;G (0.46) &#x0003e; 5-foU&#x0002f;T (0.41) &#x0003d; 5-foU&#x0002f;C (0.41) &#x0003e; 5-foU&#x0002f;A (0.25). Therefore, we conclude that hNTH1 removes 5-foU mispaired with G, A, T and C, in that order of preference, from DNA.</p><p>Human hNTH1 is a structural and functional homolog of <italic>E.coli</italic> Nth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf460c3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf460c29">29</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf460c31">31</xref>). Mammalian cells have been shown to possess at least two kinds of DNA glycosylase activity that remove 5-foU from DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf460c23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf460c24">24</xref>). In this study, we have demonstrated that hNTH1 has 5-foU DNA glycosylase activity. Four kinds of DNA glycosylase can act on 5-foU in DNA in <italic>E.coli</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf460c20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf460c21">21</xref>). Therefore, it is possible that mammalian cells also possess another 5-foU DNA glycosylase(s) in addition to hNTH1. Recently, Hazra <italic>et al</italic>. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf460c28">28</xref>) reported the presence of two human orthologs of the <italic>E.coli nei</italic> gene in the human genome database and characterized one of their products. Based on the substrate preference, they named it NEH1 (Nei homolog). The wild-type recombinant NEH1, purified to homogeneity from <italic>E.coli</italic>, excises formamidopyrimidines from damaged DNA and 8-oxoguanine and oxidized pyrimidines, such as thymine glycol, from oligonucleotides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf460c28">28</xref>). We also separately isolated a human homolog of <italic>E.coli</italic> Nei, named hNEI1. We found that hNEI1 recognized and efficiently cleaved oligonucleotides containing 5-foU (our unpublished results). However, further investigations will be needed to elucidate the molecular basis of the repair mechanisms for 5-foU in mammalian cells.</p></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="display-objects"><title>Figures and Tables</title><fig id="gkf460f1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p> Expression and purification of recombinant hNTH1.
