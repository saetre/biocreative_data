Amino acid and nucleotide sequence analyses have assigned the open reading frame for GSH-II, starting with the ATG near its 5' terminus. The molecular weight calculated from the predicted amino acid sequence is 35,559 daltons, being in good agreement with that of a GSH-II subunit estimated by the SDS-PAGE method. Several signal sequences conserved in the promoter regions of E. coli were found in the non-coding regions of the gsh-II gene. They include the Shine-Dalgarno sequence, the Pribnow box and the sequence conserved in the "-35 region" with a preferable spacing from each other for an efficient transcription. Downstream from the termination codon, the inverted repeat sequences were present, followed by 6 successive T's. These structural features found in the non-coding regions have suggested to be involved in regulatory functions for the gsh-II gene expression.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><supplementary-material content-type="scanned-pages"><graphic xlink:href="nar00342-0081.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="9299"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00342-0082.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="9300"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00342-0083.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="9301"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00342-0084.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="9302"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00342-0085.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="9303"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00342-0086.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="9304"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00342-0087.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="9305"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00342-0088.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="9306"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00342-0089.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="9307"/></supplementary-material></body></article>
