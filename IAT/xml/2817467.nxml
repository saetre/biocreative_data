Nrf2 expression is exquisitely regulated; Nrf2 expression is suppressed under unstressed conditions but strikingly induced under oxidative stress. Previous studies showed that stress-induced Nrf2 up-regulation results from both the inhibition of Nrf2 degradation and enhanced Nrf2 translation. In the present study, we elucidate the mechanism underlying translational control of Nrf2. An internal ribosomal entry site (IRES) was identified within the 5&#x02032; untranslated region of human Nrf2 mRNA. The IRES<sub>Nrf2</sub> contains a highly conserved 18S rRNA binding site (RBS) that is required for internal initiation. This IRES<sub>Nrf2</sub> also contains a hairpin structured inhibitory element (IE) located upstream of the RBS. Deletion of this IE remarkably enhanced translation. Significantly, treatment of cells with hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) and phyto-oxidant sulforaphane further stimulated IRES<sub>Nrf2</sub>-mediated translation initiation despite the attenuation of global protein synthesis. Polyribosomal profile assay confirmed that endogenous Nrf2 mRNAs were recruited into polysomal fractions under oxidative stress conditions. Collectively, these data demonstrate that Nrf2 translation is suppressed under normal conditions and specifically enhanced upon oxidant exposure by internal initiation, and provide a mechanistic explanation for translational control of Nrf2 by oxidative stress.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>The initiation of protein translation in eukaryotic cells is mainly regulated via two distinct mechanisms; cap-dependent ribosome scanning and cap-independent internal ribosome entry mediated by internal ribosomal entry sites (IRESs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>). Normal physiological conditions favor cap-dependent translation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>). The 7-methylguanosine cap (m<sup>7</sup>GpppN, N is any nucleotide) of mRNA is recognized by eukaryotic initiation factor 4F (eIF4F) complex, consisting of cap-binding protein eIF4E, RNA helicase eIF4A and scaffolding protein eIF4G which recruits 40S ribosome subunit via eIF3. With its associated initiation factors, the 40S ribosome subunit is believed to scan the 5&#x02032; untranslated region (UTR) until it finds the initiation codon AUG. Subsequently the 60S ribosome subunit is recruited to assemble the 80S ribosome and polypeptidyl elongation commences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>). Under various cellular and environmental stresses, however, global protein translation declines and the translation of diverse stress-responsive factors driven by IRESs is preferentially upregulated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>). The switch from cap-dependent translation to cap-independent translation has been proposed to function as an adaptive response of stress resistance.</p><p>Nrf2 (NF-E2 related factor 2) is a basic leucine zipper (bZIP) transcription factor. Nrf2 is the key factor regulating the antioxidant response. Under unstressed conditions, Nrf2 is mainly sequestered in the cytoplasm by a cytoskeleton anchoring protein Keap1 (Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>). Keap1 is also a substrate adaptor protein for Nrf2 ubiquitination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>) that promotes constant degradation of Nrf2. When exposed to oxidative stress, the abundance of stable Nrf2 proteins increases dramatically (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>). Nrf2 protein unbound to Keap1 can translocate to cell nucleus in a redox-sensitive manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>) to orchestrate the transcription of a battery of phase II detoxifying/antioxidant enzymes and phase III efflux transporters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>). As a consequence, these cells can effectively neutralize and remove excess oxidants to restore redox homeostasis. Accumulating evidences show that Nrf2 augmentation may result from redox-sensitive attenuation of Keap1-mediated ubiquitination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>) as well as enhanced translation of Nrf2 mRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>). While the regulation of Keap1-mediated Nrf2 ubiquitination has been well elucidated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>), the mechanism underlying Nrf2 translational regulation remains unknown.</p><p>In this study, we identified within the 5&#x02032;-UTR of Nrf2 mRNA a functional IRES. This IRES<sub>Nrf2</sub> contains a ribosomal binding site (RBS) and a hairpin (HP)-structured inhibitory element (IE). Importantly, the IRES<sub>Nrf2</sub>-driven Nrf2 translation appears to be redox-sensitive. Nrf2 mRNA is selectively recruited into polysomes resulting in enhanced translation of Nrf2 protein. These results reveal a novel mode of regulation of Nrf2 signaling at the level of translation via internal initiation.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Cell culture and chemicals</title><p>Human cervical squamous cancerous HeLa cells and human embryonic kidney (HEK) cells were obtained from ATCC (Manassas, VA, USA).

This Nrf2 segment was subcloned into the intercistronic region of a bicistronic vector (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>).

The 5&#x02032;-UTR of human Nrf2 (hNrf2) mRNA has been previously examined using the 5&#x02032;-RACE (rapid amplification of the cDNA ends) assay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>).

Indeed the mFold algorithm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>) predicted the presence of an elaborate secondary structure in the 128 nt (nt, &#x02212;83 to +45, with translation start codon as +1) segment of hNrf2 mRNA, with a Gibbs free energy value (&#x00394;<italic>G</italic>) of &#x02212;65.6 kcal/mol. <fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p>Schematic drawing of the structure of the 5&#x02032;-UTR of human Nrf2 mRNA and plasmid constructs.

When this pRluc-Nrf2-Fluc vector is expressed in cells, the upstream Rluc cistron is translated in a cap-dependent manner, whereas the downstream Fluc cistron can only be translated if the intercistronic sequence contains a functional IRES. As a negative control, a short linker sequence was inserted into the intercistroic region, creating a pRluc-null-Fluc plasmid.

To verify the integrity of bicistronic mRNAs, we examined the actual size of the reverse transcribed (RT)-PCR products of various constructs. When amplified by T7 and BGH primers that flank the entire ORF of Rluc-insert-Fluc, only the full-length transcripts were observed, as compared with PCR products amplified from plasmid DNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>B). DNase I pretreatment and RT in the absence of RT proved that the RT-PCR products were indeed derived from mRNAs and not from transfected plasmid DNA (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkp1048/DC1">Supplementary Figure S1</ext-link>). Similar results were obtained in PCR reactions using internal primer 1 (P1) or 2 (P2) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figures 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>B). These data strongly suggest that the integrity of Rluc-insert-Fluc transcripts is preserved <italic>in vivo</italic> and therefore rule out the possibility of spurious splicing.</p><p>An alternative explanation for the observed Fluc activity could be that this Nrf2 segment harbors a cryptic promoter that drives transcription of Fluc thus producing a monocistronic Fluc mRNA. To rule out this possibility, we tested this Nrf2 segment in a pGL3 basic vector for promoter activity. The pGL3 basic vector contains a Fluc ORF without any upstream promoter and 3&#x02032;-end enhancer. We subcloned this Nrf2 segment upstream of the Fluc ORF. When examined in HeLa cells, pGL3 basic-Nrf2 actually exhibited lower Fluc activities in comparison with pGL3 basic vector (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>C), confirming that the inserted Nrf2 sequence has no cryptic promoter activity. In contrast, the presence of a SV40 promoter in the pGL3 control vector elicited robust Fluc expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>C).</p><p>It is also possible that the observed IRES activity results from ribosomal read through and reinitiation at the Fluc ORF. To examine this possibility, we inserted a HP structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>) upstream of the Nrf2 5&#x02032;-UTR to block ribosomal read through. When pRluc-HP-Nrf2-Fluc vector was expressed in HeLa cells, negligible decrease of Fluc activities were observed in comparison with the pRluc-Nrf2-Fluc expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>D), suggesting that the observed Fluc expression is unlikely to result from ribosomal read through. Unexpectedly, pRluc-HP-Nrf2-Fluc exhibited significant decrease of Rluc expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>D). It is possible that the position of HP interferes with the termination at Rluc ORF and consequently attenuates Rluc translation. The validity of translational inhibition by the HP was further confirmed by the insertion of HP immediately upstream of the Rluc ORF (HP-Rluc-Nrf2-Fluc). In this construct, the expression of Rluc was almost completely abolished while the expression of Fluc was virtually unchanged (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>D), supporting the notion that the Fluc translation does not result from Rluc read through. Furthermore, this data provide additional evidence that in the context of the bicistronic reporter system the IRES<sub>Nrf2</sub> supports internal initiation in the absence of translation of the upstream cistron. Collectively, these data show that this Nrf2 segment contains an authentic IRES.</p></sec><sec><title>The IRES<sub>Nrf2</sub> contains an 18S rRNA binding site and an a hairpin inhibitory element</title><p>To elucidate the functional components of the IRES<sub>Nrf2</sub>, we inspected the sequence of this Nrf2 segment and observed that it contains two putative 18s rRNA binding sites (RBS). The RBS1 is located at the Nrf2 5&#x02032;-UTR with 84.6% complementarity to 18s rRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figures 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>A and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>A).

To investigate whether these sequences are involved in IRES<sub>Nrf2</sub> activity, we made progressive deletions. The &#x00394;N1 construct deleted an upstream segment of the Nrf2 5&#x02032;-UTR but spared the RBS1 and RBS2.

To examine whether endogeneous Nrf2 mRNAs are actively translated in a redox-sensitive manner, we performed a polyribosomal profile assay in HEK 293 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>). The ribosomes were fractionated by an ultracentrifugation through a sucrose gradient. In comparison with the control sample treated with solvent (H<sub>2</sub>O, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>A), 2-h treatment with 200 &#x000b5;M H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> increased the size of 60S/80S peaks and attenuated the magnitude of polysomal fractions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>B), indicating polysomal disassembly and global translational repression under oxidative stress. Likewise, 2-h treatment with 50 &#x000b5;M SFN also enlarged 60S/80S peaks and induced a severe rundown of polysomal fractions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>C). RT-PCR analyses showed that, in control cells, the hNrf2 mRNAs mainly distributed in the fractions 7&#x02013;9, equivalent to 80S monosome and low polysomal fractions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>D). Importantly, both H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> and SFN treatments shifted hNrf2 mRNAs to high polysomal fractions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>D), indicating active translation of hNrf2 mRNAs.

Our RT-PCR results were confirmed by qPCR assays.

In the present study, we identified within the 5&#x02032;-UTR of hNrf2 mRNA an IRES. Previously, an IRES has also been identified in the leading sequence of yeast AP-1 (YAP1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>), a yeast homolog of Nrf2.</p><p>The IRES<sub>Nrf2</sub> has two putative RBSs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>A and B). RBS1 is highly conserved among human, mouse (NM_010902/U20532), rat (NM_031789) and bovine (NM_001011678) Nrf2 mRNAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>A). RBS2 is conserved among human, mouse (U20532) and rat (NM_031789) Nrf2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>B). Deletion analyses showed that RBS1 but not RBS2 is required for the IRES<sub>Nrf2</sub> function both under normal and oxidative conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figures 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>). The RBS1 is complementary to the 749&#x02013;761 nt of human 18S rRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>A). It was shown previously that the 746&#x02013;784 nt of 18S rRNA in 40S ribosomal subunit was accessible to a complementary probe and thus is likely accessible to mRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>). We attempted to demonstrate that the IRES<sub>Nrf2</sub> can directly interact with the ribosome <italic>in vitro</italic>, but were unable to do so. Furthermore, we were unable to form the 48S initiation complex on the <italic>in vitro</italic> transcribed RNA from IRES<sub>Nrf2</sub> in rabbit reticulocyte lysate (RBL) in the presence of GMP-PNP (data not shown). These data does not exclude the possibility that the RBS1 is indeed participating in the IRESnrf2 function. Rather, it suggests that modifications of factors such as IRES trans-acting factors (ITAFs) or initiation factors by oxidative stress, a condition that cannot be recapitulated in RRL <italic>in vitro</italic>, would be required for proper functioning of the IRES<sub>Nrf2</sub>.</p><p>The IRES<sub>Nrf2</sub> possesses a hairpin structured IE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>A and B). High sequence homology was observed in this stem-loop segment among the 5&#x02032;-UTR of human, mouse (NM_010902) and bovine (NM_001011678) Nrf2 mRNA. Surprisingly, deletion of this stem&#x02013;loop structure robustly enhanced translation efficiency of the Nrf2 IRES (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>C). The identification of an IE within the IRES<sub>Nrf2</sub> may provide some clue to answer a long-time puzzle why cells would waste energy to constantly synthesize proteins, such as Nrf2, that are merely destined for degradation under normal cellular conditions. Our present data suggest that the antioxidant machinery operates in an efficient and economical fashion. Under unstressed conditions, the Nrf2 translation is sustained at low level of activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>D and F). In an equilibrium with Keap1-mediated Nrf2 degradation, this low-activity of constitutive translation of Nrf2 is likely sufficient for cells to keep surveillance of the slight redox fluctuation and maintain basal antioxidant activity. Upon being challenged by oxidative stress, the IE-mediated suppression may be &#x02018;overruled&#x02019; resulting in enhanced Nrf2 translation, as illustrated by the recruitment of Nrf2 mRNAs into translationally active polysomal fractions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>D and F). Magnified Nrf2 translation coupled with inhibited Keap1-mediated Nrf2 degradation could instantaneously elicit an effective antioxidant response. Further studies are needed to examine the nature and regulation of this IE.</p><p>All cellular IRES described to date require ITAFs to regulate IRES activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>). Our data suggest that the IRES<sub>Nrf2</sub>-mediated translation suppression and initiation may be regulated by ITAFs in a redox-sensitive manner. Further studies on the interaction of IRES<sub>Nrf2</sub>-ITAFs will deepen our mechanistic understanding of Nrf2 translational regulation under normal physiological versus oxidative stress conditions.</p><p>The IRES<sub>Nrf2</sub>-driven translation appears to be redox-sensitive. IRES<sub>Nrf2</sub>-mediated internal initiation can be significantly upregulated by the treatment of oxidants H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> and SFN. In contrast, treatments of reducing compounds GSH and NAC have no effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>A). Redox-sensitivity of IRES-driven internal initiation has been reported before. The IRES activity of Apaf-1 was significantly down-regulated when exposed to anoxia for 24 and 48 h (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>). Transient exposure (30 min) to 200 &#x000b5;M H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> enhanced translation mediated by the IRES of Hepatitis C virus (IRES<sub>HCV</sub>) in HepG2 and A549 cells, coupled with eIF2&#x003b1; phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>).</p><p>In the present study, treatments with H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> and SFN enhance phosphorylation of eIF2&#x003b1; (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>B). Phosphorylation of eIF2&#x003b1; at the Ser51 residue is a signature event of translational response to stress. A variety of stresses induce phosphorylation of eIF2&#x003b1;, a composite element of ternary eIF2-GTPase complex. Phosphorylation of eIF2&#x003b1; disables eIF2-GTPase, which mediates Met-<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="gkp1048i1.jpg"/></inline-formula> binding to 40S ribosome, and consequently suppresses global translation. Paradoxically, eIF2&#x003b1; phosphorylation enhances translation of some stress factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>). The precise role of eIF2&#x003b1; phosphorylation in stress-induced translational regulation is unclear, since eIF2&#x003b1; phosphorylation alone appears not sufficient to elicit internal initiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>). Under hypoxia stress, oxidative stress, viral infection, amino acid starvation and heat shock, the eIF2&#x003b1; can be phosphorylated by heme-regulated inhibitor kinase, PKR-like endoplasmic reticulum (ER) kinase (PERK), protein kinase RNA (PKR) and general control non-derepressible-2 (GCN2) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>). PERK is activated in response to ER stress and the unfolded protein response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>). Previously, it was reported that PERK could activate Nrf2 signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>). Further studies are needed to test whether PERK may facilitate Nrf2 translation under oxidative and ER stress via eIF2&#x003b1; phosphorylation.</p><p>It is very interesting to observe differential inductive effect of two phase II inducers (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> and SFN) with distinct chemical structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>). H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> can enhance both cap-dependent and cap-independent translation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>A). Similar H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> effect was also observed in the IRES<sub>HCV</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>). In contrast, SFN can selectively augment cap-independent translation but suppress cap-dependent translation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>A). It warrants further examination whether this differential effect results from distinct regulation of eIF4E phosphorylation by H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> and SFN (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>B). Phosphorylation of eIF4E enhances cap binding affinity and favors the assembly of eIF4F complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>). The eIF4E can be directly phosphorylated by Mnk1/2 (MAP kinase-interacting kinases) at the Ser209 residue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>). In addition, eIF4E can also be phosphorylated in a PI3K (phosphtidylinositol 3 kinase)-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>). Further study is needed to elucidate the signaling events underlying H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>&#x02212; and SFN-induced effect. The differential induction elicited by H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> and SFN also raised the question whether other structurally distinct phase II inducers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>) also have differential effect on Nrf2 translation. It is interesting to observe that curcumin, a &#x003b2;-diketone with Michael acceptor functionality that is known to induce Nrf2 expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>), can suppress phosphorylation of eIF4E binding protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>) and may eventually regulate eIF4E availability.</p><p>In conclusion, we characterized a novel redox-sensitive IRES in the 5&#x02032;-UTR of Nrf2 mRNA.

Importantly, the redox-sensitive translation and degradation of Nrf2 enables the cells to respond and adjust to a rapidly changing redox environment.</p></sec><sec><title>SUPPLEMENTARY DATA</title><p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkp1048/DC1">Supplementary Data</ext-link> are available at NAR Online.</p></sec><sec><title>FUNDING</title><p>The <funding-source>National Institutes of Health</funding-source> (<award-id>R01 CA94828 and NIEHS P30ES005022 to A.-N.K</award-id>., partial); Canadian Institutes of Health Research (MOP 89737 to M.H.).
