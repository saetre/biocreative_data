Four quantitative trait loci (QTLs) have been mapped in these strains for this trait. Underlying each of these QTLs must be one or more genetic differences (polymorphisms in either gene coding or regulatory regions) influencing ethanol sensitivity. Because prior studies have tended to focus on differences in coding regions, genome-wide expression profiling in cerebellum was used here to identify candidate genes for regulatory region differences in these two strains. Fifteen differentially expressed genes were found that map to the QTL regions and polymorphisms were identified in the promoter regions of four of these genes by direct sequencing of ILS and ISS genomic DNA. Polymorphisms in the promoters of three of these genes, <italic>Slc22a4</italic>, <italic>Rassf2</italic>, and <italic>Tax1bp3</italic>, disrupt putative transcription factor binding sites. <italic>Slc22a4</italic> and another candidate, <italic>Xrcc5</italic>, have human orthologs that map to genomic regions associated with human ethanol sensitivity in genetic linkage studies. These genes represent novel candidates for the LORR phenotype and provide new targets for future studies into the neuronal processes underlying ethanol sensitivity.</p></abstract><custom-meta-wrap><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; Springer Science+Business Media, Inc. 2006</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-wrap></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p>The Inbred Long Sleep (ILS) and Inbred Short Sleep (ISS) mice have a marked phenotypic difference in their hypnotic sensitivity to ethanol as measured by their loss of righting response (LORR) and have been widely used as a genetic model of intrinsic ethanol sensitivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">Collins 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">Deitrich 1990</xref>). Quantitative trait loci (QTLs) that harbor genetic differences influencing LORR, called <italic>Lores</italic> (for loss of righting due to ethanol), have been mapped in these strains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">Markel et al. 1997</xref>), and four of these QTLs have been subsequently confirmed by their capture in congenic strains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">Bennett et al. 2002b</xref>). Although these four genomic regions have been linked to the phenotype, further refinement to specific candidate genes is required to identify the genetic determinants of ethanol sensitivity in these mice.</p><p>Genetic differences underlying the QTLs can fall into one of two broad categories: coding region polymorphisms that affect the amino acid sequence of the translated protein or regulatory region polymorphisms that affect the level or pattern of expression of a gene. The coding regions of many candidate genes mapping to the <italic>Lore</italic> QTL regions have been sequenced to address the first possibility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">Ehringer et al. 2001</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">2002</xref>). This study is intended to address the second possibility by examining the transcript levels of <italic>Lore</italic> genes in these mouse strains to determine which are differentially expressed (DE). Any DE genes in QTL regions are excellent candidates to influence ethanol sensitivity in these mice; they thus merit further study.</p><p>Transcript levels were assayed in the cerebella of these strains using two different array platforms: Affymetrix oligonucleotide arrays and cDNA arrays manufactured at the University of Colorado Health Sciences Center (UCHSC) from a set of approximately 15,000 murine cDNA clones distributed by the National Institute of Aging, the NIA Mouse 15K clone set (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">Tanaka et al. 2000</xref>). The cerebellum was chosen for the study both because it is a major target of ethanol in the brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">Fadda and Rossetti 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">Wong et al. 2003</xref>), and because the sensitivity of cerebellar neurons to ethanol correlates very highly with the LORR phenotype in a number of inbred mouse strains that vary with respect to hypnotic sensitivity phenotypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">Spuhler et al. 1982</xref>).</p><p>In addition to falling within a QTL region, true DE candidate genes would harbor polymorphisms between the ILS and ISS strains in their regulatory regions that are responsible for their differential expression. In order to investigate this possibility, the genomic regions upstream of the transcriptional start sites of several DE <italic>Lore</italic> genes were sequenced. The upstream sequences were then analyzed to identify putative transcription factor binding sites that would be disrupted in one strain or the other by the SNPs that were identified. These polymorphisms are possibly the quantitative trait nucleotides (QTNs) underlying the QTL linkage scores in the genomic region and ultimately influence ethanol sensitivity in these mouse strains. Differentially expressed genes were also analyzed to identify their expression QTLs (eQTLs) to determine if any DE genes are likely to be <italic>cis</italic>-regulated, thus bolstering the case for functional effects of these promoter region SNPs.</p><p>In addition, linkage and association studies that have identified human genomic regions related to ethanol sensitivity in humans were queried to assess human orthologs of <italic>Lore</italic> genes that are DE in the cerebella of the ILS and ISS. Any genes implicated in both human and rodent genetic studies are excellent candidates to be involved in influencing ethanol sensitivity in humans.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Tissue collection and RNA isolation</title><p>Adult male Inbred Long Sleep (ILS) and Inbred Short Sleep (ISS) mice between 4 and 10 weeks old were obtained from the Institute for Behavioral Genetics (IBG, Boulder, CO). After arriving at the University of Colorado Health Sciences Center (Denver, CO), the animals were housed five to a cage for two weeks during which time they were provided food and water <italic>ad libitum</italic> in a 12-h light/dark cycle. No experimental manipulations or measurements were carried out on the mice during this time. After the acclimation period, the mice were sacrificed by cervical dislocation without prior anesthesia. Immediately after sacrifice, the brain was surgically removed and the cerebellum was dissected out and flash frozen in liquid N<sub>2</sub>. Dissection and freezing was completed within 5 min from the time of sacrifice. The tissue samples were stored at &#x02212;80&#x000b0;C until RNA isolation was carried out. The cerebella were homogenized individually in Buffer RLT (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) using a Fisher PowerGen 125 and disposable OMNI-Tips (Fisher Scientific, Hampton, NH). Total RNA was extracted from the homogenized samples using an RNeasy Midi Kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer&#x02019;s instructions including the optional on-column DNA digestion with RNase-free DNase I. The concentration of each sample was determined by absorbance at 260 nm (A260) and purity by the ratio of A260 to A280. A range of 1.9&#x02013;2.1 was considered adequately pure.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Affymetrix arrays</title><sec id="Sec5"><title>Labeling and hybridization</title><p>Total RNA from four different mice, two ILS and two ISS, was used in four hybridizations, two replicates per strain, to Mouse Expression Set 430 (MOE430) A and B arrays (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA). Five micrograms of total RNA isolated from a single ILS or ISS cerebellum were reverse transcribed into double-stranded cDNA using the SuperScript Choice system (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) and an oligo-dT primer containing a T7 RNA polymerase promoter (Proligo Primers &#x00026; Probes, Boulder, CO). The ds-cDNA was isolated and purified with the GeneChip Sample Cleanup Module (Affymetrix). The cDNA was next transcribed into biotin-labeled cRNA by incubating at 37&#x000b0;C for 4 h with HY Reaction Buffer, biotin-labeled ribonucleotides, DTT, RNase Inhibitor Mix, and T7 RNA Polymerase (Enzo Life Sciences, Farmingdale, NY). The labeled cRNA was purified using the GeneChip Sample Cleanup Module following the manufacturer&#x02019;s instructions. At this point, the cRNA was quantified and checked for quality using a &#x0201c;Lab on a Chip&#x0201d; 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent, Palo Alto, CA). Next, 20&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g of cRNA were fragmented into pieces 50-200 bases in length by incubation at 94&#x000b0;C for 35 min with high Mg<sup>2+</sup> Fragmentation Buffer (Affymetrix). The sample was then added to a hybridization solution containing 100 mM MES, 1 M Na<sup>+</sup>, and 20 mM EDTA in the presence of 0.01% Tween 20. The final concentration of the fragmented cRNA was 0.05&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g/&#x003bc;L. Next, 200&#x000a0;&#x003bc;L of the sample were hybridized to the array at 45&#x000b0;C for 16 h using a GeneChip Hybridization Oven 640 (Affymetrix). After hybridization, the hybridization solutions were removed and the arrays were washed and stained with Streptavidin-phycoerythrin using a GeneChip Fluidics Station 450 (Affymetrix). The arrays were then read at a resolution of 2.5&#x02013;3&#x000a0;&#x003bc;m using an Affymetrix GeneChip Scanner 3000 to collect the hybridization data.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Data collection and analysis</title><p>The statistical expression algorithm of the GeneChip Operating Software (GCOS) was used to scale overall chip intensities to the same level and for probe level analysis of the hybridization data. Affymetrix arrays use probe pairs consisting of a perfect match (PM) and mismatch (MM) in order to subtract background and cross-hybridization artifacts. The MM and PM probes have identical sequences except for one base change in the middle of the MM sequence. The statistical expression algorithm was used to make an absent, present, or marginal call for each probe set on the arrays. Absent calls were made for probe sets that did not have hybridization intensities above the background intensity of the array and also for probe sets with an insignificant hybridization intensity difference between the PM and MM probes.</p><p>The hybridization data were then loaded into the GeneSpring software package (Agilent). Only data from probe sets identified as &#x0201c;present&#x0201d; in at least half of the hybridizations were considered during subsequent analysis. Each measurement on the arrays was globally normalized to the 50<sup>th</sup> percentile value of all measurements on the array to normalize each chip and make the data across chips comparable. As a per-gene normalization step, the hybridization value for each gene was normalized to the median value of the gene in the ILS samples, which were arbitrarily assigned as the reference samples. Genes were then eliminated from further analysis if they had a coefficient of correlation greater than 0.95 to a hypothetical gene profile that was constant for all experiments regardless of the mouse strain used. This step was taken because genes that did not vary in expression level between the two strains were unlikely to be of interest, and so the number of genes tested was minimized to increase the power of statistical analyses. The hybridization data from each strain were then grouped and Welch&#x02019;s <italic>t</italic>-test was used to determine which genes were different in their hybridization ratios between the two strains, to a significance level <italic>p</italic> &#x02264; 0.05. Because of multiple testing, this significance threshold resulted in an expected false positive rate of 11.2% in our results.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>cDNA microarrays</title><sec id="Sec8"><title>Labeling and hybridization</title><p>The cDNA microarrays used in these experiments were manufactured in-house at UCHSC by the Gene Expression Core. The cDNA chips were constructed using 15,512 mouse clones from the National Institute of Aging 15K Mouse cDNA Clone Set (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">Tanaka et al. 2000</xref>), and these chips are referred to as the &#x0201c;NIA15K&#x0201d; arrays.

Pooled samples of total RNA were used for hybridizations to the cDNA microarrays in order to mask intrastrain variability. Each pool included RNA from five ILS mice or five ISS mice, and no individual mouse was included in more than one pool. Pool 1 was used for four hybridizations, two in which the ILS sample was labeled with cyanine-3 dye (Cy-3) and the ISS sample with cyanine-5 dye (Cy-5), and two hybridizations with the opposite dye orientation. Pool 2 was used in two hybridizations, one in each dye orientation. Pool 3 was used for three hybridizations with the same dye-labeling orientation, ILS labeled with Cy-5 and ISS labeled with Cy-3.</p><p>Equal amounts of total RNA from five individual mice of the same strain were pooled together and then directly labeled in a one-step reverse transcription reaction. Total RNA (20&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g) was combined with 5 &#x000d7; first-strand buffer, 1&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g oligo-dT20mer, 0.1 M DTT (Gibco Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA), low dTTP/dNTP mix (Amersham Biosciences, Piscataway, NJ), RNasin (Promega Biosciences, San Luis Obispo, CA), and either cyanine 3- or cyanine 5-dUTP (PerkinElmer, Torrance, CA) in 500-&#x003bc;L tubes. The reactions were heated to 65&#x000b0;C for 5 min, and then SuperScript II RNase H<sup>-</sup> Reverse Transcriptase (Gibco) was added and the mix was incubated at 42&#x000b0;C for 90 min. Five microliters of 0.5 M EDTA were added to stop the reaction and then the mixture was heated to 65&#x000b0;C for 30 min with 10&#x000a0;&#x003bc;L of 1 M NaOH to hydrolyze the RNA, followed by the addition of 25&#x000a0;&#x003bc;L of 1 M Tris to neutralize the NaOH. The Cy-3- and Cy-5-labeled probes were combined and isolated by running them through a Microcon YM-30 size-exclusion column (Millipore), washed with TE buffer, and resuspended in 11&#x000a0;&#x003bc;L of TE. After adding 10&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g of mouse COT-1 DNA (Gibco), 8&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g poly(A) RNA (Amersham Biosciences), 4&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g yeast tRNA (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO), 3.1&#x000a0;&#x003bc;L 20 &#x000d7; SSC, and 0.5&#x000a0;&#x003bc;L 10% SDS, the probe mixture was hybridized to the arrays at 42&#x000b0;C for 16 h. The microarrays were washed using dilute SSC solution to remove debris and hybridization buffer, and then scanned with a GenePix4000A scanner (Axon Instruments, Union City, CA). The Cy-3 and Cy-5 fluorescence was measured for each cDNA element, and any probes with a fluorescence level below background or less than 60% of the original spotting area were flagged as &#x0201c;absent&#x0201d; while the rest were noted as &#x0201c;present&#x0201d; by the GenePix software.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>cDNA microarray data analysis</title><p>The hybridization intensity data were loaded directly into the GeneSpring software package (Agilent). All analyses used only genes flagged as &#x0201c;present&#x0201d; in at least half of the hybridizations during scanning. All arrays were then normalized using the Lowess normalization feature in GeneSpring (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">Yang et al. 2002</xref>). Briefly, a Lowess curve was fitted to the log-intensity versus log-ratio plot using 20% of the data to calculate the fit at each point. This curve was used to adjust the control value for each measurement and minimize intensity-dependent artifacts. The control value was set to 10 for all measurements with a postnormalization value of less than 10. Next, the chips were grouped by dye-orientation and the two groups were considered separately. Genes that had a statistically significant variation (<italic>p</italic> &#x02264; 0.05) in their hybridization ratios among different experiments in the same dye orientation, as determined by Welch&#x02019;s <italic>t</italic>-test, were considered unreliable and removed from further analysis. The two dye-orientation groups were then compared and Welch&#x02019;s <italic>t</italic>-test was used to determine which genes had statistically significant differences in their hybridization ratios between the two groups. The Benjamini and Hochberg False Discovery Rate (FDR) was used for multiple test correction at an overall error rate of 5%. Probes that passed this test were considered significantly differentially expressed (DE) between ILS and ISS cerebella.</p></sec><sec id="Sec10"><title>Mapping DE genes in the mouse genome Lore QTL boundaries</title><p>The probe sets for the set of DE genes from the cDNA arrays were mapped to the Mouse May 2004 (mm5) assembly of the mouse genome using the UCSC Genome Browser (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://genome.ucsc.edu">http://genome.ucsc.edu</ext-link>) and the Blast-like Alignment Tool (BLAT) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">Kent 2002</xref>).

The regions identified delimit likely locations of <italic>cis</italic> and <italic>trans</italic> acting factors that affect that gene&#x02019;s expression and are termed expression QTLs, or eQTLs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">Bystrykh et al. 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">Chesler et al. 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">Hubner et al. 2005</xref>).</p><p>Using the most recent data set for cerebellar tissue [SJUT Cerebellum mRNA M430 (Oct04) MAS5] and the &#x0201c;Marker Regression&#x0201d; tool available from WebQTL, single-marker eQTLs were individually mapped for all DE <italic>Lore</italic> genes. The ten markers with the best likelihood ratio statistic (LRS) scores were returned for each DE gene and the <italic>p</italic> value of each linkage was determined by permutation test. Only markers with significant (<italic>p</italic> &#x02264; 0.05) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">Lander and Kruglyak 1995</xref>) linkage to a DE gene are reported. A marker linked to a DE gene and mapping within 10 Mb from its position in the mouse genome (UCSC mm5 assembly) is hereafter termed a &#x0201c;<italic>cis</italic>-eQTL.&#x0201d; This window is used to account for the fact that linkage extends several Mb in each direction on the chromosome, and the marker showing the highest linkage score is not necessarily the closest on the physical map. Multiple markers linked to the same DE gene and mapping within 25 Mb of each other are considered to be part of the same eQTL, and only the most significant marker in each eQTL is reported.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec14" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec15"><title>Differentially expressed genes</title><p>Gene expression levels in the cerebella of ILS and ISS mice were assayed with Affymetrix MOE430 arrays that contain probe sets for 1789 genes in the <italic>Lore</italic> intervals.

This reinforces the importance of a two-pronged approach to candidate gene identification because either a protein sequence or expression change may contribute to the phenotypic difference. In this case at least, it appears that these two classes of candidates do not overlap, so a survey of the QTL intervals that searched for only coding region or only expression changes would entirely miss many plausible candidates.</p><p>It is also noteworthy that the two platforms used in our experiments, the Mouse Expression Set 430 (Affymetrix) and the NIA 15K arrays, both identified only one <italic>Lore</italic> gene, <italic>Myo1d</italic>, that passed the selection criteria for differential expression. One major reason for this is that 9 of the 15 genes identified by the MOE430 arrays were not represented on the 15K arrays, thus it was impossible to confirm them on this platform. The remaining six genes had hybridization ratios on the cDNA chips that showed higher expression in the same strains identified in the Affymetrix arrays (data not shown); however, these genes did not pass the DE threshold on the 15K arrays.</p><p>The majority of the 15 expression candidates map to the <italic>Lore4</italic> and <italic>Lore5</italic> regions, partly because of the comparatively larger sizes of these intervals. Several of these new candidates have supporting evidence that makes them compelling candidates. These include the transcription factor genes <italic>Atf1</italic> and <italic>Scrt1</italic>, which have been shown to have profound influences on brain function and development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">Nakakura et al. 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">Pittenger et al. 2002</xref>). Others, including the transcribed clone BG075643, are less well characterized and have less obvious roles in neuronal function but should be examined in future studies because of their demonstrated differences in expression in these mice.</p><p>In contrast, there are only four differentially expressed candidate genes from <italic>Lore1</italic> and <italic>Lore2</italic>, both of which have been significantly narrowed using interval-specific congenic recombinant lines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">Bennett et al. 2002a</xref>). <italic>Xrcc5</italic> and <italic>Slc22a4</italic> are attractive candidates because their human orthologs map to genomic regions linked to human ethanol sensitivity.

It builds on previous efforts that have used the ILS and ISS model of hypnotic sensitivity to find DNA polymorphisms influencing this complex trait. Fifteen novel candidates for having regulatory polymorphisms affecting the LORR phenotype have been presented, and these data complement other studies that sequenced genes in these intervals to generate candidates with coding region differences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">Ehringer et al. 2001</xref>).
