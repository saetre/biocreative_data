MurG is an essential glycosyltransferase catalysing the last intracellular step of peptidoglycan synthesis. To elucidate its role during elongation and division events, localization of MurG using immunofluorescence microscopy was performed. MurG exhibited a random distribution in the cell envelope with a relatively higher intensity at the division site. This mid-cell localization was dependent on the presence of a mature divisome. Its localization in the lateral cell wall appeared to require the presence of MreCD. This could be indicative of a potential interaction between MurG and other proteins. Investigating this by immunoprecipitation revealed the association of MurG with MreB and MraY in the same protein complex. In view of this, the loss of rod shape of &#x00394;<italic>mreBCD</italic> strain could be ascribed to the loss of MurG membrane localization. Consequently, this could prevent the localized supply of the lipid II precursor to the peptidoglycan synthesizing machinery involved in cell elongation. It is postulated that the involvement of MurG in the peptidoglycan synthesis concurs with two complexes, one implicated in cell elongation and the other in division. A model representing the first complex is proposed.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Introduction</title><p>The characteristic shape of most bacteria is attributed to the peptidoglycan layer. This major constituent of the bacterial cell wall is responsible for the maintenance of the structural integrity of the cell by withstanding its internal turgor pressure. The biosynthesis of peptidoglycan is therefore essential and its role is unique to bacteria. As a consequence, enzymes involved in this complex process are used as targets for antibiotics. In <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> the assembly of peptidoglycan includes three phases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">Ha <italic>et al</italic>., 2001</xref>). Phase one begins in the cytoplasm of the bacterial cell and involves the synthesis of UDP-<italic>N</italic>-acetylmuramyl-pentapeptide (UDP-MurNAc-pentapeptide) from UDP-<italic>N</italic>-acetyl-glucosamine (UDP-GlcNAc). During the second phase, which takes place on the cytoplasmic surface of the bacterial membrane, the activity of two essential enzymes, MraY and MurG, is required. MraY catalyses the transfer of the phospho-MurNAc-pentapeptide motif of UDP-MurNAc-pentapeptide to a lipid carrier, undecaprenyl phosphate, to form the so-called lipid I. MurG (a glycosyltransferase) then catalyses the transfer of the GlcNAc motif of UDP-GlcNAc to the C4 hydroxyl MurNAc in lipid I to produce the lipid-linked &#x003b2;-(1,4) disaccharide known as lipid II. In phase three, which is called cell surface stage, lipid II is translocated to the exterior surface of the cell by an unknown mechanism and incorporated into the peptidoglycan through transglycosylation and transpeptidation reactions by penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">H&#x000f6;ltje, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">Nanninga, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">Vollmer and H&#x000f6;ltje, 2001</xref>).</p><p>As MraY and MurG are key players in the biosynthesis of the peptidoglycan layer, studying these important enzymes could furnish insights into the development of inhibitors and subsequently to further understand the mechanism of the persisting problem of resistance to antibiotics. Up to now, MurG has been the subject of several studies. It has been shown that MurG is required for cell growth and survival (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">Mengin-Lecreulx <italic>et al</italic>., 1991</xref>) and that it is conserved among eubacteria. As it has no counterpart in mammalian cells, this enzyme is interesting to evaluate as a potential antibiotic target. Recently, the crystal structure was solved (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">Ha <italic>et al</italic>., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">Hu <italic>et al</italic>., 2003</xref>) and several (high-throughput) assays for screening inhibitors of MurG have been developed and validated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">Auger <italic>et al</italic>., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">Helm <italic>et al</italic>., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">Liu <italic>et al</italic>., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b45">Zawadzke <italic>et al</italic>., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">Ravishankar <italic>et al</italic>., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">Ramachandran <italic>et al</italic>., 2006</xref>). Although these studies have elucidated the kinetic characterization of MurG, little is known about its mechanism of action at the level of morphogenesis and in particular its molecular interactions with other proteins.</p><p>Therefore, the aim of the present study was to provide a cellular characterization of MurG and to determine putative interactions with proteins of <italic>E. coli</italic>, in an attempt to elucidate its specific function in relation to cell elongation and cell division. To this end, immunofluorescence microscopy (IFM) and immunoprecipitation (IP) were applied. MurG appeared to be randomly distributed in the cell envelope with a relatively higher intensity at the division site. This mid-cell localization was dependent on the presence of the divisome. Particularly, for this position MurG required the presence of PBP3 and FtsQ. Furthermore, the results of IP using chemical cross-linking revealed the association of MurG with MreB and MraY in the same protein complex. The localization of MurG appeared also to be dependent on the expression of the <italic>mreBCD</italic> operon. This suggests that the defect in cell elongation caused by the absence of MreBCD is possibly due to the inability of MurG to position the lipid II peptidoglycan precursor.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>MurG is tightly associated with the cytoplasmic membrane</title><p>Outer and inner membranes of inside-out membrane vesicles were separated using sucrose density equilibrium centrifugation and the presence of MurG was assessed by immunoblotting using antibodies raised against this protein. MurG was shown to be present in the inner membrane fraction [inner membrane vesicles (IMVs)] corresponding to the 45% sucrose layer. This fraction was further used to study the characteristics of interaction of MurG with the inner membrane. As shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1</xref>, association of MurG with the inner membrane was not affected by chemical reagents such as 2 M NaCl, and 0.1 M Na<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub>, whereas 50 mM EDTA and 6 M urea caused a slight decrease in the intensity of the protein band. This implies that MurG is strongly associated with the inner membrane. However, MurG could be released from the inner membrane after treatment with 1% Triton X-100 as reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">Van den Brink-van der Laan <italic>et al</italic>., 2003</xref>) and upon subjection to trypsin digestion (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1</xref>). These results suggest that the interaction of MurG with the cytoplasmic membrane is predominantly of hydrophobic nature.</p></sec><sec><title>MurG localizes in the lateral cell wall as well as at the division site</title><p>The number of MurG molecules per average cell present in cell extracts of <italic>E. coli</italic> LMC500 (wild-type K-12) grown to steady state at 28&#x000b0;C in GB1 medium was determined by immunoblotting and densitometrical comparison of the MurG signal from the cell extract (total lysate) with that of a concentration gradient of purified MurG. MurG was estimated to be present in 1200 &#x000b1; 33 (<italic>n</italic> = 3) molecules per average cell (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Fig. S2</xref>).</p><p>Cellular localization of MurG in LMC500 grown at 28&#x000b0;C in GB1 and TY was examined by IFM. MurG localized as multiple distinct foci in the cell envelope (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Fig. 1A</xref>). Because MurG was mostly present in the inner membrane but almost absent in the cytosol as shown by immunoblotting (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Fig. S3</xref>), the foci must represent envelope-associated MurG. Analysis of the normalized average fluorescence intensity profile (FIP) of a total of more than 500 LMC500 cells revealed a random fluorescence distribution of MurG in the cell envelope with a relatively higher intensity at the division site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02">Fig. 2</xref>). The intensity increase at mid-cell was not a result of the constriction, i.e. doubling of membranes (compare with the FIP of a general lipid stain of the membranes with BODIPY-C12 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig08">fig. 8A</xref> of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">Bertsche <italic>et al</italic>., 2006</xref>). In addition to this mid-cell localization of MurG in TY-grown cells, a denser distribution at predivision sites (i.e. 1/4 and 3/4 positions) of the future daughter cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02">Fig. 2B</xref>) was visible. This is consistent with the proposition of random incorporation of precursors of peptidoglycan in <italic>E. coli</italic> during lateral growth with a higher synthetic activity at the middle of the cell before a constriction was visible (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">Taschner <italic>et al</italic>., 1988b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b43">Wientjes and Nanninga, 1989</xref>).</p><fig id="fig08" position="float"><label>Fig. 8</label><caption><p>Schematic representation of the possible constituents of the putative cell elongation complex in <italic>E. coli</italic>.

These cells grow well at 28&#x000b0;C in TY and show a normal MurG localization pattern (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Fig. 1B</xref>) but after a shift to 42&#x000b0;C for 2 mass doublings (MDs) they become abnormally wide and swollen and finally they start to lyse. At this restrictive temperature, MurG was evenly distributed in the cytoplasm and mid-cell localization was not detectable (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Fig. 1C</xref>). The non-functional truncated MurG could be detected by the used antibody when immunoblotting was performed. The absence of membrane localization was therefore not due to insufficient recognition of MurG by the antibody. This indicates that the carboxy-terminal 66 amino acids of MurG are essential for its membrane localization either because they may interact with membrane components or because their absence may affect the folding of MurG.</p></sec><sec><title>Mid-cell localization of MurG requires divisome components</title><p>To investigate whether the presence of MurG at mid-cell was division dependent, its localization was studied in the strain LMC509 that expresses the temperature-sensitive FtsZ84(Ts) protein, which is not able to polymerize at mid-cell and causes filamentation at the restrictive temperature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">Addinall <italic>et al</italic>., 1997</xref>). MurG showed normal mid-cell localization in this strain at 28&#x000b0;C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig03">Fig. 3A</xref>). However, at 42&#x000b0;C MurG foci were randomly distributed in the cell envelope (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig03">Fig. 3B</xref>). This suggests that the mid-cell localization of MurG is related to cell division. The earliest event in cell division is the assembly of the FtsZ-ring. This is followed by the assembly of a number of other cell division proteins at mid-cell about 1/5 of a generation time later just before the onset of the constriction process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">Aarsman <italic>et al</italic>., 2005</xref>). To examine whether the MurG mid-cell localization is dependent on an early or a late event in the process of cell division, localization studies of MurG were further performed in strain LMC510, which contains the <italic>ftsI2158</italic> that expresses a PBP3(Ts) protein. PBP3 is involved in peptidoglycan synthesis and localizes to the division site during the later stages of cell growth and throughout septation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">Weiss <italic>et al</italic>., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">Aarsman <italic>et al</italic>., 2005</xref>). At 42&#x000b0;C the PBP3(Ts) filaments showed blunt constriction where mid-cell localization of MurG was not observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig03">Fig. 3C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4">Fig. S4A</xref>). This implies that the position of MurG is dependent on the presence of PBP3.</p><fig id="fig03" position="float"><label>Fig. 3</label><caption><p>Fluorescence intensity profiles of LMC509 (FtsZ(Ts), A and B), LMC510 (PBP3(Ts), C), LMC531 (FtsQ(Ts), D) and LMC500 (wild-type, E) cells. After growth at 28&#x000b0;C in 1/2 GB1 LMC509 cells were shifted to 42&#x000b0;C for 2 MDs, and immunolabelled with anti-MurG (A, 28&#x000b0;C) and (B, 42&#x000b0;C). LMC510 and LMC531 cells were grown at 28&#x000b0;C in GB1 to steady state and shifted to 42&#x000b0;C for 2 MDs, and immunolabelled with anti-MurG. LMC500 cells were grown at 28&#x000b0;C in GB1 after which aztreonam was added and growth was continued for 2 MDs before the cells were immunolabelled with anti-MurG (E). Similar patterns shown in A were also obtained for the other temperature-sensitive strains when grown at 28&#x000b0;C in GB1.

The <italic>y</italic>-axis represents the average normalized fluorescence intensity.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="mmi0065-1106-f3"/></fig><p>For its recruitment to the division site it was described in several studies (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">Errington <italic>et al</italic>., 2003</xref>) that PBP3 requires the presence of other proteins (i.e. FtsL, FtsB, FtsQ and FtsW). FtsQ localization is believed to be indispensable for the recruitment to the divisome of the majority of the late localizing proteins. To verify whether it is also important for the positioning of MurG, localization of this latter was examined in the temperature-sensitive LMC531 strain that expresses FtsQ(Ts) in which glutamic acid (E) 125 is replaced by a lysine (K) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">Storts and Markovits, 1991</xref>). At the restrictive temperature, immunolabelling of the LMC531 filaments with anti-MurG revealed the absence of MurG at 1/4 and 3/4 positions. Besides, a dense fluorescent signal at mid-cell was not visible (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4">Fig. S4B</xref>) [absence of MurG mid-cell localization was also observed in the FtsW(Ts) strain (data not shown)]. This indicates that the position of MurG depends on the localization of FtsQ and evidently on a mature divisome. To gain more insight in the nature of this reliance, MurG localization in LMC500 was determined in the presence of aztreonam, a specific inhibitor of PBP3. This was undertaken to find out whether the appearance of MurG required the function of PBP3. Mid-cell localization of MurG was preserved in aztreonam-induced filaments after 2 MDs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig03">Fig. 3E</xref> see the distinct peak at mid-cell, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4">Fig. S4C</xref>). As reported previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">Den Blaauwen <italic>et al</italic>., 2003</xref>), most cell division proteins (including PBP3) are able to localize at mid-cell in the presence of aztreonam for at least 2 MDs, whereas the localization at future division sites at 1/4 or 3/4 positions is inhibited. MurG followed this pattern suggesting that the presence of MurG at mid-cell takes place even if the divisome is not functional.</p></sec><sec><title>MurG associates with MreB in a protein complex</title><p>As alluded to above MurG seems to form a complex with proteins that are part of the divisome. Therefore, it is possible that it could also interact, because of its localization in the cell envelope with proteins involved in lateral envelope synthesis. To assess this, IP experiments were carried out.</p><p>Membrane fractions prepared from <italic>E. coli</italic> LMC500 strain grown at 28&#x000b0;C in GB1 or at 37&#x000b0;C in TY were Triton X-100 solubilized, chemically cross-linked with the membrane-permeable dithiobis (succinimidyl propionate) (DSP), immunoprecipitated using affinity-purified anti-MurG IgG-coated magnetic beads, and analysed by immunoblotting using anti-MurG. Under non-reducing conditions (sample buffer without &#x003b2;-mercaptoethanol, incubation at 37&#x000b0;C for 5 min before electrophoresis), the results showed that MurG was cross-linked into a high-molecular-weight complex. This protein complex is visible among a smeared background in wild-type LMC500 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig04">Fig. 4A</xref>, lane 1). The dominant bands of this complex have a molecular weight of approximately 250 kDa and 120 kDa (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig04">Fig. 4A</xref>, lane 1). The band at the position of about 37 kDa is free MurG (that is not completely cross-linked in the complex). To ensure use of equal amounts of materials, a fraction of the membranes was loaded on SDS-PAGE and analysed with anti-MurG. The blot depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig04">Fig. 4</xref> (lanes 1 and 2) represents 1/10 of the membrane fraction used for the IP.</p><fig id="fig04" position="float"><label>Fig. 4</label><caption><p>Immunoblotting (IB) analysis of the protein complex with anti-MurG and anti-MreB.

The protein complex is visible among a smeared background in LMC500 (A, lanes 1 and 6). The dominant bands of this complex have a molecular weight of about 120 kDa and approximately 250 kDa. In the strain BW25113&#x00394;<italic>mraY</italic>/pMAK<italic>mraY</italic>ec (A, lane 2) the 120 kDa band is more pronounced. The band at the position of 37 kDa is free MurG. No protein complex was yielded in the control where the IP procedure was carried out without the membrane fractions (A, lanes 5 and 10). The same complexes (of 250 kDa and 120 kDa) are also seen when the immunoblot was probed with anti-MreB (A, lanes 6 and 7 respectively). In the strain &#x00394;<italic>mreBCD</italic> PA340-678 the protein complex is absent (A, lanes 3 and 8) and only free MurG is visible at the level of about 37 kDa when the detection is carried out with anti-MurG (A, lane 3). The complexes of 250 kDa and 120 kDa were undetectable in the MurG(Ts) strain GS58 (A, lanes 4 and 9). The protein band of about 37 kDa is free MurG. Performing the IP with anti-MreB resulted as well in a protein complex of approximately 250 kDa and 120 kDa in LMC500 when probing with anti-MurG or anti-MreB (B, lanes 1 and 6 respectively). The 120 kDa band was more pronounced in the strain BW25113&#x00394;<italic>mraY</italic>/pMAK<italic>mraYec</italic> (B, lanes 2 and 7). The complex was not visible in the &#x00394;<italic>mreBCD</italic> PA340-678 cells (B, lanes 3 and 8). In this strain only a MurG band at the position of 37 kDa was detected when probing with anti-MurG (B, lane 3). In the MurG(Ts) the protein complex was absent (B, lanes 4 and 9). A faint MreB band is visible when anti-MreB was used for detection (B, lane 9). To assess background binding of the secondary antibodies the incubation with the primary antibodies was omitted from the procedure. As depicted in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5">Fig. S5</xref> (see <italic>Supplementary materials</italic>) no protein bands are detected. One tenth of the membrane fraction used for the IP experiments was applied (without cross-linking) on SDS-PAGE and probed with anti-MurG (C, lanes 1 and 2). In LMC500 and BW25113&#x00394;<italic>mraY</italic>/pMAK<italic>mraYec</italic> the intensity of the band (corresponding to MurG) is comparable (lanes 1 and 2 respectively). The interaction between MurG and MreB is specific. To show this the IP procedure with the membrane fraction was performed with anti-FtsZ and the immunoblot was probed with anti-FtsZ. Only a band (&#x0223c;40 kDa) at the position of FtsZ is detectable in the presence (lane 3) and absence (lane 4) of DSP under non-reducing (lanes 3 and 4) or reducing (lane 5) conditions. The molecular weight of MurG, MreB and MraY&#x02013;&#x003b2;-lactamase&#x02013;His is 37.8, 36.9 and 71 kDa respectively. The data are representative of at least three separate experiments. Although some samples were not run in the same gel, the IB procedure (i.e. electrophoresis, blotting and ECL detection conditions) was the same for all of them.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="mmi0065-1106-f4"/></fig><p>Complexes at the position of 250 kDa and around 120 kDa were likewise obtained when the immunoblot was probed with anti-MreB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig04">Fig. 4A</xref>, lanes 1 and 2). Conducting the IP procedure with magnetic beads coated with affinity-purified anti-MreB yielded the presence of a protein complex as detected with anti-MurG and anti-MreB with a comparable high molecular weight as well (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig04">Fig. 4B</xref>, lanes 1, 2, 6 and 7), indicating that the MurG-containing protein complex could also be immunoprecipitated with MreB.</p><p>To exclude the possibility that the presence of the 250 kDa protein complex could be the result of cross-reactivity of the secondary antibodies with IgG from the beads, the IP procedure was conducted without the addition of the membrane fraction. As depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig04">Fig. 4</xref> (A: lanes 5 and 10, B: lanes 5 and 10) immunoblotting with anti-MurG or anti-MreB, respectively, did not yield any product. In addition, controls consisting of incubating the blots with only the secondary antibody to monitor the potential presence of IgG on the blot confirmed the absence of protein bands and hence background binding (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5">Fig. S5A and B</xref>). Moreover, the complex was absent when IP was performed with either anti-MurG or anti-MreB of the membrane fraction of the <italic>mreBCD</italic> deletion strain PA340-678 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig04">Fig. 4A</xref>, lanes 3 and 8, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig04">Fig. 4B</xref>, lanes 3 and 8) in which MurG is also cytosolic (see next section and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Fig. S3</xref>) and of the MurG(Ts) strain GS58 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig04">Fig. 4A</xref>, lanes 4 and 9, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig04">Fig. 4B</xref>, lanes 4 and 9). Taken together, the results provide evidence for association of MurG and MreB in the same protein complex at the periphery of the membrane of <italic>E. coli</italic>.</p><p>To assess whether this interaction was specific, the IP procedure with the membrane fraction was carried out with anti-FtsZ and the immunoblot was probed with anti-FtsZ. Although FtsZ is thought to be predominantly a cytosolic protein, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">Koppelman <italic>et al.</italic> (2004)</xref> have demonstrated that inside-out cytoplasmic membrane vesicles (IMV) contain a fraction of cytoplasmic membrane-bound FtsZ (IMV&#x02013;FtsZ). The results of this IP revealed the presence of only one band of &#x0223c;40 kDa at the position of FtsZ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig04">Fig. 4C</xref>, lanes 3&#x02013;5). This band was observed in the presence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig04">Fig. 4C</xref>, lane 3), and absence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig04">Fig. 4C</xref>, lane 4) of the cross-linker under non-reducing (lanes 3 and 4) or reducing (incubation at 100&#x000b0;C for 10 min in sample buffer containing &#x003b2;-mercaptoethanol before electrophoresis) conditions (lane 5). Hence, the absence of high-molecular-weight complexes could be explained by the effect of treatment with Triton X-100 that may have disrupted all interactions of FtsZ with cell division proteins and also a potential association of MurG with FtsZ (as MurG was not detected). Additional control experiments were also performed involving IP with anti-PBP1B. PBP1B is a bitopic membrane protein that catalyses the transglycosylation and transpeptidation of precursors in peptidoglycan synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">H&#x000f6;ltje, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">Vollmer and H&#x000f6;ltje, 2001</xref>). Western blot analysis of the IP did not yield any protein complex containing MurG or MreB (results not shown). Based on the above described IP experiments and controls it can be concluded that the association of MurG with MreB was specific.</p></sec><sec><title>MurG associates with MraY in a protein complex</title><p>MraY catalyses the transfer of the phospho-MurNAc-pentapeptide motif from UDP-MurNAc-pentapeptide to undecaprenyl phosphate leading to the formation of undecaprenyl-pyrophospho-MurNAc-(pentapeptide) (lipid I). MurG then transfers the GlcNAc motif from UDP-GlcNAc onto the lipid I, forming the disaccharide derivative undecaprenyl-pyrophospho-GlcNAc-MurNAc-(pentapeptide) (lipid II) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">Bouhss <italic>et al</italic>., 2004</xref>). Lipid II is then polymerized and cross-linked into peptidoglycan by transglycosylation and transpeptidation reactions of the PBPs. As MraY and MurG are consecutively involved in the same biosynthetic pathway, it was reasoned that an interaction between these two proteins could exist. To investigate this assumption IP was performed with membrane fractions prepared from the strain BW25113&#x00394;<italic>mraY</italic>/pMAK<italic>mraY</italic>ec using affinity-purified anti-MurG.

This strain was used due to the lack of antibodies directed against MraY.</p><p>Probing the immunoblot with anti-MurG resulted in cross-linked products among a smeared background. The prominent protein band of these products had a size of about 120 kDa (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig04">Fig. 4A</xref>, lane 2 and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig05">Fig. 5</xref>, lane 2). This band was also detected with anti-MreB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig04">Fig. 4</xref>, lane 2 and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig05">Fig. 5</xref>, lane 4). Performing the analysis with a polyclonal antibody directed against &#x003b2;-lactamase (to detect the MraY of <italic>E. coli</italic> in fusion with &#x003b2;-lactamase) revealed the presence of a band with a molecular weight of around 120 kDa in addition to a 70 kDa band that corresponded to the molecular weight of MraY&#x02013;&#x003b2;-lactamase&#x02013;His fusion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig05">Fig. 5</xref>, lane 6). As the complex was analysed under non-reducing conditions on SDS-PAGE, it might be of importance to mention that the molecular weight of the complexes might slightly diverge from the genuine mass of the separate proteins forming the complex. The 250 kDa complex could also be detected although the intensity of this band is much less than the cross-linked product in wild-type LMC500 strain and almost indistinguishable from the background. This difference might be attributed to the fact that LMC500 and BW25113&#x00394;<italic>mraY</italic>/pMAK<italic>mraY</italic>ec are distinct strains. Control experiments where the same IP procedure was carried out without the membrane fractions yielded no products (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig05">Fig. 5</xref>, lanes 1, 3 and 5) indicating that MurG and MraY interact.

In addition, a discernible packed (arcked filamentous) localization of MurG in constricting cells at the position of the future constriction sites was also observed.

As PA340-678 cells are round, it is possible that the observed abnormality in MurG localization pattern was due to the aberrant cell morphology rather than to the absence of the MreB helix. To test whether the localization of MurG would be maintained in spherical cells exhibiting a helical arrangement pattern of MreB, LMC500 cells were grown for 2 MDs in the presence of 2 &#x003bc;g ml<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> of the PBP2 inhibitor mecillinam (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">Park and Burman <italic>et al</italic>., 1973</xref>). A functional PBP2 is essential for length growth and maintenance of the diameter of the cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">Den Blaauwen <italic>et al</italic>., 2003</xref>). Therefore inhibition of PBP2 by its specific inhibitor mecillinam results in spherical growth. The round cells were subsequently labelled with anti-MurG and anti-MreB.

This revealed anormal localization (random distribution and at mid-cell) of MurG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig07">Fig. 7C</xref>). To provide more evidence for this observation, localization of MurG was examined in wild-type <italic>E. coli</italic> treated with A22. This molecule was described to be a specific inhibitor of MreB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">Iwai <italic>et al</italic>., 2002</xref>).

The authors demonstrated that MurG accumulated near mid-cell. This accumulation took place shortly after the formation of the FtsZ ring and before constriction.

As presented here, this interaction was not or slightly affected by the presence of high salts, alkaline conditions, chelating agents or strong reagents. The association of MurG with the inner membrane could only be disrupted after treatment with 1% Triton X-100 or trypsin, indicating that it is predominantly of hydrophobic nature. This is in accordance with the proposal of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">Hu <italic>et al</italic>. (2003)</xref>, who deduced from the crystal structure of MurG that the membrane association site of this protein consists of a hydrophobic patch in the N-domain surrounded by basic residues.</p><p>Immunofluorescence microscopy studies demonstrated that MurG was randomly distributed in the cell envelope with a higher intensity at the division site. The concentrated presence of MurG at the division site supports the results published earlier by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b43">Wientjes and Nanninga (1989)</xref>. Using two different and independent approaches, i.e. pulse-labelling of synchronized cultures and autoradiography of pulsed cells, the authors showed an increased localized peptidoglycan synthesis activity at the (potential) division sites. Based on immunodetection and electron microscopy techniques, a localized insertion of peptidoglycan precursors in the cylindrical cell wall and a complete new synthesis of the cell poles were observed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">De Pedro <italic>et al</italic>. (1997)</xref>. Because of its dual localization, MurG is probably essential for both the poles and the cylindrical part of peptidoglycan synthesis. A number of MurG 50&#x02013;20 foci per average cell could be estimated. With approximately 1200 MurG molecules per cell of which about 1000 are membrane bound (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Fig. S3</xref>), each focus could contain between 20 and 50 MurG molecules. Therefore, the random disposition of MurG in the cell envelope seems to concur with the idea that the insertion of precursors in the lateral wall occurs at a limited number of discrete but probably dynamic sites.</p><p>In the temperature-sensitive strain of MurG (GS58) an even distribution of MurG in the cytosol was visible. The fact that most of these cells underwent lysis after 2 MDs at 42&#x000b0;C emphasizes the involvement of MurG in the synthesis of peptidoglycan.</p><p>Prior to division, a mature divisome has to be assembled at the middle of the <italic>E. coli</italic> cell. This assembly is believed to be a multistep process. Previously, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">Aarsman <italic>et al</italic>. (2005)</xref> reported on that the recruitment of the divisome components follows a two-step model: the first step involved the formation of the Z-ring by polymerization of FtsZ at the constriction site and simultaneous localization of ZipA, FtsA and ZapA. During the second step FtsQ, FtsL/B, FtsW, PBP3, FtsN and AmiC are recruited to the constriction site.</p><p>The mid-cell localization of MurG was shown to be dependent on the presence of the mature divisome as revealed by the results of the localization studies performed with the FtsZ84(Ts) LMC509, FtsQ(Ts) LMC531, PBP3(Ts) LMC510 strains, and with the wild-type LMC500 cells in the presence of PBP3 inhibitor aztreonam. Mid-cell localization of MurG was not observed in the absence of either the first step or the second step proteins. These findings implicate that MurG might be a component of the divisome. This observation supports a model proposed previously by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">Nanninga (1998)</xref> where MurG was considered to be an essential part of the divisome. In this model the divisome is thought to be composed of subassemblies connected via FtsZ polymers. In each divisome subassembly proteins from the cytoplasm and periplasm are structurally connected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">Nanninga, 1998</xref>). In light of this, it can be proposed that MurG provides peptidoglycan lipid II precursors specific for division by being part of the divisome subassemblies. Based on the average number of cell division proteins per cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">Nanninga, 2001</xref>), an amount of about 50 subassemblies could be present. This could clarify the intense fluorescence signal of MurG observed at mid-cell.</p></sec><sec><title>Interaction of MurG, MreB and MraY proteins</title><p>Using DSP as the cross-linker a high-molecular-weight protein complex; comprising two subcomplexes of approximately 250 kDa and 120 kDa; was identified in <italic>E. coli</italic>.

Taken together, the results suggest that MurG and MreB associate with each other. This was further confirmed by the absence of this complex in cells where <italic>mreBCD</italic> was deleted.

To exhibit a helical pattern, localization of MreB was not dependent on the presence of MurG. In contrast, MurG was not able to localize in the &#x00394;<italic>mreBCD</italic> strain. As MurG was able to appear at its position when only MreB was absent, it was apparent that its localization might be dependent on the presence of the MreC and MreD. The dependency of localization of MurG on the presence of the MreCD could indicate that these proteins cooperate during the elongation process in particular the lateral cell wall synthesis. In this regard, the loss of rod shape of <italic>mreBCD</italic> deletion strain could be caused by the loss of MurG membrane localization. As a consequence, this could prevent the localized supply of the lipid II precursor to the peptidoglycan synthesizing machinery involved in cell elongation. However, the absence of MreB led also to altered morphology (spherical cells) where the MreB helix is invisible. This can be explained as follows: because the MreB helical structure is affected by the absence of either MreC or MreD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">Kruse <italic>et al</italic>., 2005</xref>), it can be postulated that MreB might be involved in the organization of these two proteins in the cell membrane and that this MreBCD complex interacts (cooperates) with other proteins (e.g. MraY and MurG) to provide precursors to build the lateral peptidoglycan, and thereby controlling the topography of cell wall morphogenesis. Provided that MreB is essential for rod shape in <italic>E. coli</italic> and in light of the results found by IP, a potential (direct or indirect) association of MurG with MreB through MraY may exist.</p></sec><sec><title>Model involving the role of MurG in the synthesis of peptidoglycan</title><p>Recently, a model in which MreB, C and D form an essential membrane-bound complex that directs longitudinal cell wall synthesis has been proposed for <italic>E. coli</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">Kruse <italic>et al</italic>., 2005</xref>).

In this complex a possible interaction of MreC with multiple PBPs (which are known to add precursors to the existing peptidoglycan by a combination of transglycosylation and transpeptidation reactions), including PBP2 was suggested as was previously reported for <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">Daniel and Errington <italic>et al</italic>., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">Van den Ent <italic>et al</italic>., 2006</xref>) and <italic>Caulobacter crescentus</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">Divakaruni <italic>et al</italic>. 2005</xref>).

In the first complex, which is implicated in cell elongation MurG interacts and/or cooperates with MraY, MreBCD, RodA and PBP2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig08">Fig. 8</xref>). In the second complex implicated in division MurG associates with other cell division proteins like FtsA, FtsQ, FtsW and PBP3. The high-molecular-weight class A PBPs, PBP1A and PBP1B, are essential for peptidoglycan synthesis (they possess transglycosylation as well as transpeptidation activity). PBP1A and PBP1B were proposed to play distinct roles in the synthesis of the cell wall where involvement of PBP1B peptidoglycan synthesis specific for division was suggested (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">Del Portillo and de Pedro, 1990</xref>). In addition, a direct interaction between PBP1B and PBP3 at the division site was recently demonstrated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">Bertsche <italic>et al</italic>., 2006</xref>) and PBP1A and PBP1B do not form a complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">Charpentier <italic>et al</italic>., 2002</xref>). Therefore, it can be speculated that PBP1A might belong to the first complex and PBP1B belong to the second complex of the model. However, further studies are needed to investigate how protein interactions (involving MurG) regulate cell elongation and cell division.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Experimental procedures</title><sec><title>Strains and growth media</title><p><italic>Escherichia coli</italic> K-12 cells were grown to steady state in glucose minimal medium (GB1) containing 6.33 g of K<sub>2</sub>HPO<sub>4</sub>.3H<sub>2</sub>O, 2.95 g of KH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, 1.05 g of (NH<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>, 0.10 g of MgSO<sub>4</sub>.7H<sub>2</sub>O, 0.28 mg of FeSO<sub>4</sub>.7H<sub>2</sub>O, 7.1 mg of Ca(NO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>.4H<sub>2</sub>O, 4 mg of thiamine, 4 g of glucose and 50 mg of required amino acids, per litre pH 7.0 at 28&#x000b0;C.
